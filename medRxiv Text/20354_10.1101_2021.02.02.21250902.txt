Abstract
Background
The Platform Randomised trial of INterventions against COVID-19 In older peoPLE (PRINCIPLE) trial
has provided in-pandemic evidence of what does not work in the early primary care management of
coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19). PRINCIPLE’s first finding was that azithromycin and doxycycline
were not effective.
Aim
To explore the extent to which azithromycin and doxycycline were being used in-pandemic, and the
scope for trial findings impacting on practice.
Design and Setting
We compared crude rates of prescribing and respiratory tract infections (RTI) in 2020, the pandemic
year, with 2019, using the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and
Surveillance Centre (RSC).
Methods
We used a negative binomial model including age-band, gender, socioeconomic status, and NHS
region to compare azithromycin and doxycycline lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), upper
respiratory tract infections (URTI), and influenza-like-illness (ILI) in 2020 with 2019; reporting incident
rate ratios (IRR) between years and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
Results
Azithromycin prescriptions increased 7% in 2020 compared to 2019, whereas doxycycline decreased
by 7%. Concurrently, LRTI and URTI incidence fell by over half (58.3% and 54.4% respectively) while
ILI rose slightly (6.4%). The overall percentage of RTI prescribed azithromycin rose by 42.1% between
2019 and 2020, doxycycline increased by 33%.
Our adjusted IRR showed azithromycin prescribing was 22% higher in 2020 (IRR=1.22, 95%CI:1.191.26, p<0.0001), for every unit rise in confirmed COVID there was an associated 3% rise in prescription
(IRR=1.026, 95%CI 1.024-1.0285, p<0.0001); whereas these measures were static for doxycycline.
Conclusion
PRINCIPLE trial flags scope for improvement in antimicrobial stewardship.

PRINCIPLE trial findings demonstrate scope for in-pandemic improvement in primary care
antibiotic stewardship
Introduction:
The Platform Randomised trial of INterventions against COVID-19 In older peoPLE (PRINCIPLE) 1 has
reported that two antibiotics, azithromycin and doxycycline, commonly prescribed to people with
possible coronavirus 2019 infections (COVID-19) in primary care shows no meaningful benefit in terms
of patient reported recovery outcomes. 2 Azithromycin was included in PRINCIPLE between 23rd May
through to 30th November 2020; doxycycline between 24th July and 14th December 2020.
However, there is no published evidence to know whether these antibiotics are being prescribed
differently in primary care during the pandemic and therefore the extent to which these findings have
potential to impact or change practice. Whilst National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
states: As COVID‑19 pneumonia is caused by a virus, antibiotics are ineffective; 3 it is entirely
understandable given the disparities in who test positive 4 and the excess mortality associated with
COVID-19 5 that general practitioners might have a lower threshold for prescribing antibiotics. NICE
suggest that where antibiotics might be used doxycycline is the first choice.
We describe whether there was any change in the prescribing of these antibiotics in primary care
during 2020, compared with the pre-pandemic year, taking into account any reduction in the incidence
of consultations for respiratory tract infections (RTI) associated with the lockdowns, advice about
where and when to seek help (e.g. NHS 111), and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). 6 We
also report if azithromycin and doxycycline were more likely to be prescribed to people with a COVID19 diagnosis.
Method:
Data source and population:
We used data from the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and
Surveillance Centre (RSC) sentinel network database. The RSC is one of Europe’s oldest sentinel
systems and recruited to be nationally representative, with a history since 1967 of publishing a weekly
report of monitored conditions – principally influenza-like-illness (ILI) and other respiratory infections
and diseases. 7 The RSC is actively involved, working closely with Public Health England (PHE) to deliver
sentinel surveillance including of COVID-19. 8
We carried out this analysis using sample of 397 general practices that met data quality standards in
RSC with a total registered list size of 4,453,626. This subset was used because their antibiotic drug
codes were carefully curated and met quality standards, and the patient group included also had near
complete socioeconomic status recording (in most samples around 2.5% are missing).
General practices in the RSC are expected to code as a problem, in their computerised medical record,
the diagnosis that the patient presents with. This is particularly so for our monitored conditions and
key data required for determining vaccine effectiveness. We feedback to practices about their data
quality via a dashboard, and do not include in our published reports those practices with monitored
events where data quality level is below threshold. 9

Reporting crude differences:
We described the monthly rate of prescribing of azithromycin and doxycycline comparing 2020 with
2019 (1/1/2020-31/12/2020 with 1/1/2019-31/12/2019). We next reported the monthly incidence of
RTIs, again comparing 2020 with 2019. We only included coded cases which were labelled as an
incident event or which were at least two weeks after any earlier recording. We compared lower
respiratory infections (LRTI), upper respiratory infections (URTI), and influenza-like-illness (ILI)
between the two years. We then summarised the rates of antibiotic use and of RTIs, providing 95%
confidence intervals (95%CI) to discern differences in rates.
Modelling the difference:
We created negative binomial models; the first pair to report if there is any difference between the
use of azithromycin and doxycycline in 2020, compared with 2019. We adjusted for age-band, gender,
socioeconomic status using the index of multiple deprivation (derived from post code), NHS region
(though we combined midlands and east regions to provide a more balanced distribution), and the
incidence of LRTI, URTI and ILI. Concerning age, the population included in PRINCIPLE was people over
50 years old with one or more comorbidities and population age 65 years or older. We therefore
included a 65 years and older age-band in our analysis as most readily compared with PRINCIPLE, but
decided to include antibiotic use across all age-bands. We report an incident rate ratio (IRR) and 95%
CI, and significance. We ran the same model using 2020 data to explore whether COVID-19 cases were
more likely prescribed azithromycin or doxycycline.
Sensitivity analysis
We conducted a sensitivity analysis to explore whether the RSC practices had higher rates of
prescription of antibiotics that the rest of England. We did this because the PRINCIPLE trial has been
widely promoted to RSC practices and this may have encouraged increased prescribing. We therefore
compared the pattern of prescribing in the RSC using national data from OpenPrescribing. 10 We also
compared the lowest prescribing rates in 2020, and average monthly rates of prescribing to see if
there were any difference in prescribing rates. As OpenPrescribing does not publish a denominator
we use the list size of all English practices published by NHS Digital as denominator. 11 Finally, we
reported from OpenPrescribing the mean difference in prescribing of these antibiotics between 2020
and 2019, comparing the first 10 months of the year, as there were only data to October 2020
available.
Ethical considerations:
This investigation used pseudonymised data held by the Oxford-RCGP RSC sentinel network. The
investigation is classified by the Health Research Authority Decision tool (http://www.hradecisiontools.org.uk/research/) as not being considered research, and not requiring formal research
ethics approval. This investigation was approved by the Oxford-RCGP RSC Joint Research and
Surveillance Centre Committee.
Results:
Crude rates of azithromycin and doxycycline prescribing:
Overall, the number of azithromycin prescriptions increased by 6.98% between 2019 and 2020, while
that of doxycycline fell by 7.02% (Supplementary file, Table S4.1). However, the pattern of
prescriptions of both antibiotics through 2020 were very different from 2019, the latter followed a
more typical pattern.

In January and February 2020 prescriptions of azithromycin and doxycycline were similar to those in
2019. However, in March 2020 both antibiotics were prescribed much more. This was coincident with
the first wave of COVID-19. From then on, the use of these antibiotics in 2020 diverged in their use.
Azithromycin was prescribed in 2020 at or above the level prescribed in 2019, the converse was true
for doxycycline (Figure 1, tables of rates S1.1 and S1.2 in Supplementary file).

Figure 1:

Prescribing of azithromycin (top) and doxycycline (bottom) by month within the
RSC. 2020 prescription of both antibiotics (red line) was very similar in January
and February to 2019 rates (blue line), then in March there was a peak of
prescribing in 2020 coincident with the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Thereafter azithromycin was prescribed in 2020 at or above the level in 2019,
whereas doxycycline was prescribed less.

The monthly incidence of patient consultations with a RTI, diagnosed by GPs and recorded in their
computerised medical records, was over 50% lower in 2020 than in 2019. For LRTI and URTI the
incidence was lower every month. For example, the year 2019 shows a typical pattern for LRTI and
URTI; the incidence is lowest at the end of the school summer holidays, peaks at the end of the year,
and then falls slowly back to its low point at the end of August (Figure 1). In contrast, the pattern of
ILI is different each year. Its peak generally follows the peak in influenza A. For example, 2019 was a
typical year with a peak incidence around or just after the year end. In comparison, 2020 showed
changes in ILI incidence largely reflecting the waves of the COVID-19 pandemic with peaks in March,
April coinciding with the first wave, and a second rise as schools go back, with this modestly increased
level continuing to year end (Figure 2, Supplementary file Table S2.3).

Unsurprisingly, with social distancing measures and lockdown, there was a lower rate of LRTI (-58.3%)
and URTI (-54.4%) consultations across all age bands. ILI consultation rates overall were slightly
increased (6.4%) between the years. However, there was a fall in ILI in males under 16 years old and
a rise in presentation of females age 16 to 64 years in 2020 compared with 2019 (Table 1).

Figure 2:

Comparison of monthly incidence of consultations for LRTI (top), URTI (middle)
and ILI (bottom) comparing 2020 (red) with 2019 (blue) in the RSC dataset. There
was a lower incidence of LRTI and URI in 2020 compared with 2019, with a small
peak when schools returned in September 2020. ILI peaked with the first wave of
the COVID-19 pandemic also with the return to school.

In 2020, the use of azithromycin increased in both genders in the 65 years and over age-band, and in
males under 16 years old, compared with 2019, the overall increase was 6.98%. Not-withstanding the
observed fall in RTI rates, there has been a concomitant rise of 0.21% (95%CI: 0.16-0.26), p<0.0001) in

the proportion of respiratory infections where azithromycin was prescribed, a 42.1% rise on the
previous year.
The converse occurred with doxycycline with a reduction in the rate of prescribing in the 65 years and
older age-band. Overall, there was a decline in prescribing of 7.02% between 2019 and 2020.
However, in relation to the fall in acute respiratory infections in 2020, there was nearly a 4% rise
(3.93% , 95%CI:[3.73-4.14], p<0.0001) of doxycycline prescribing, a 33.1% rise on the previous year.

Comparison of rates of prescription of doxycycline and azithromycin in 2020 with
2019. In people 65 years old and older there was a decrease in doxycycline use but
an increase in azithromycin prescription. LRTI and URTI incidence fell across all age
bands and both genders. ILI was much more similar between years.

After having adjusted for age, gender, socioeconomic status, NHS region and RTIs (LRTI, URTI and ILI),
the negative binomial model indicated that the frequency of azithromycin prescriptions (for any
reason) in the RSC registered population is 22% higher in 2020 compared to 2019 (IRR=1.22, 95%CI
1.19-1.26, p<0.0001, Table 2).

there was a much higher rate of prescribing to those age 65 years and over, and less to those age 16

of prescribing to the most deprived regions and in the north compared to the south. Comparing 2020
with 2019 overall there was more azithromycin prescribing for people with LRTI and URTI. During

Table 3:

Azithromycin prescribing in cases of COVID-19, for each unit rise in COVID-19 cases
there has been a 3% rise in azithromycin prescriptions. Age 65 years and older,
female gender, being more deprived, northern regions LRTI or ILI infections are all
associated with a higher rate of prescribing

For doxycycline, there was no change in the rate of prescribing comparing 2020 with 2019 (IRR=1.012,
95%CI 0.994-1;030, p=0.199). Female gender, the most deprived quintile, midlands and southwest
region LRTI and ILI were associated with higher rates of prescription in 2020 compared with 2019 (see
supplementary material table S3.1).
Adjusting for age, gender, socioeconomic status, region and RTI, there was a very small rise of 0.3% in
the rate of prescribing in doxycycline (IRR=1.0003, 95%CI 1.0002-1;0005, p<0.0001). Female gender,
the most deprived quintile, midlands and southwest region LRTI and ILI were associated with higher
rates of prescription of doxycycline (see supplementary material table S3.2).
Our sensitivity analysis showed a very similar pattern of month-by-month azithromycin and
doxycycline prescribing as OpenPrescribing (Figure 3), a national database. We used the NHS Digital
registered patient population denominator (N=60,570,367); compared with the RSC sample
denominator (N=4,453,626). We compared the rates of the lowest monthly overall prescription count
in 2020. We found a prescribing rate (per registered patient) of 0.248% for OpenPrescribing and
0.225% for the RSC for doxycycline; and 0.099% and 0.075% for azithromycin. We also compared the
year-on-year change. In OpenPrescribing azithromycin prescribing increased by 7.25% and doxycycline
reduced by 2.31%, between 2019 and 2010, compared with 6.98% and =7.02% in the RSC for
azithromycin and doxycycline respectively (Supplementary file Table S4.1).

Figure 3:

Monthly pattern of doxycycline and azithromycin, prescription counts, for 2019 and
2020 (OpenPrescribing data are only available up to October 2020).

Discussion:
Main findings:
Azithromycin prescribing, for all indications, increased by 7% in 2020 compared to 2019; doxycycline
prescribing reduced by the same amount (7%). The RSC mirrors the pattern and rate of azithromycin
prescribing reported by OpenPrescribing, whilst there was a similar pattern of doxycycline prescription
OpenPrescribing reports a smaller year-on-year decline.
Prescribing of both antibiotics peaked in the first wave of COVID-19, in March 2020, with the use of
azithromycin prescribing overall staying like last year, while there is a lower rate of doxycycline
prescribing overall. There was no equivalent peak of prescribing these antibiotics in the second wave
of COVID-19 in the autumn.
Through 2020 there has been a much lower incidence of consultations coded with a diagnosis of upper
and lower RTIs, though ILI incidence increased has been more complex. ILI incidence has mirrored
COVID-19 infection.
The rate of azithromycin prescribing, taking into account the other variables in our model, has
increased by 22% in 2020 compared to 2019. Further, as the number of COVID-19 cases increased, so

the prescribing of azithromycin increased. Doxycycline, shows a different pattern. Its rate of
prescription has not changed between 2019 and 2020, although there has been an increase in
prescriptions of around 4% for RTIs and its use marginally changes with increasing COVID-19 cases.
These observations are unsurprising given an understandable imperative in clinical practice to trial
interventions that might improve COVID-19 and are in the public eye. Furthermore, more remote
consultations have increased substantially, 12 and may make it harder for clinicians to accurately
diagnose pneumonia that has complicated COVID-19, leading to a reduced threshold to prescribe
antibiotics. However, observational studies suggest that even amongst patients hospitalised with
COVID-19, the prevalence of bacterial super-infection is low with estimates of around 3.5%. 13,14
Routine antimicrobial prescription for COVID-19 patients in the community should now change in light
of the new evidence.
Implications of the findings:
The PRINCIPLE trial has demonstrated that there is no benefit from either antibiotic in early treatment
of COVID-19 in the absence of bacterial pneumonia. There is therefore considerable scope to reduce
the prescribing of these antibiotics in primary care.
Additionally, it appears that awareness of, or involvement in the PRINCIPLE trial by RSC practices does
not seem to be associated with higher rates of prescribing than those seen in national data reported
by OpenPrescribing.
Strengths and limitations:
The strength of this analysis is that the RSC has good data quality and is able to capture routine data
about RTIs and their incidence. The network encourages our key monitored conditions to be coded as
problems with an episode type, to distinguish new from follow-up consultations. Where episode type
is not recorded, we use a time interval to distinguish incidence from follow-up cases. 15 RTI data are
extracted from practices either daily or twice weekly, with data fed back to practices via a dashboard
to try to raise awareness of data quality. 16
Comparing the use between years of azithromycin and doxycycline is complex. Firstly, azithromycin
prescribing has risen, but the same proportion by which doxycycline has fallen (7%) between 2019 and
2020. However, the incidence in the respiratory conditions they treat has fallen by a greater
proportion. Both antibiotics have had a significantly increased use in respiratory infections, with the
NICE guidance, which suggests using doxycycline first line, not seeming to be associated with an overall
increase in use.3
A larger proportion of people who consult with a respiratory infection were prescribed these
antibiotics in 2020, compared with 2019. However, the situation is further complicated by the first
two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic affecting England during 2020, with considerable uncertainty
as to what medications may be of benefit. Finally, only people aged 50years and above were eligible
for the PRINCIPLE trial, these data are from across all ages.
Conclusions:
An in-pandemic trial has studied the value of prescribing two antibiotics for people with COVID-19.
Given the lack of efficacy of azithromycin and doxycycline demonstrated in the PRINCIPLE trial we
should apply good antibiotic stewardship and use them less. The national sentinel network, the
Oxford-RCGP RSC has demonstrated that these antibiotics are being extensively used and that they

are being prescribed to a higher proportion of people with respiratory infections then in the prepandemic year. There is scope, in-pandemic, to reduce the use of doxycycline and azithromycin in
primary care.
