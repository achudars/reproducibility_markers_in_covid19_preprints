Abstract

BACKGROUND
Risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases with age, is greater in
males, and is associated with decreased numbers of blood lymphoid cells. Though the
reasons for these robust associations are unclear, effects of age and sex on innate and
adaptive lymphoid subsets, including on homeostatic innate lymphoid cells (ILCs)
implicated in disease tolerance, may underlie the effects of age and sex on COVID-19
morbidity and mortality.

METHODS
Flow cytometry was used to quantitate subsets of blood lymphoid cells from people
infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), comparing
those hospitalized with severe COVID-19 (n=40) and those treated as outpatients for less
severe disease (n=51). 86 healthy individuals served as controls. The relationship
between abundance of specific blood lymphoid cell types, age, sex, hospitalization,
duration of hospitalization, and elevation of blood markers for systemic inflammation, was
determined using multiple regression.

RESULTS
After accounting for effects of age and sex, hospitalization for COVID-19 was associated
with 1.78-fold fewer ILCs (95%CI: 2.34–1.36; p = 4.55 x 10-5) and 2.31-fold fewer CD16+

natural killer (NK) cells (95%CI: 3.1–1.71; p = 1.04 x 10-7), when compared to uninfected
controls. Among people infected with SARS-CoV-2, the odds ratio for hospitalization,
adjusted for age, sex, and duration of symptoms, was 0.413 (95%CI: 0.197–0.724; p =
0.00691) for every 2-fold increase in ILCs. In addition, higher ILC abundance was
associated with less time spent in the hospital and lower levels of blood markers
associated with COVID-19 severity: each two-fold increase in ILC abundance was
associated with a 9.38 day decrease in duration of hospital stay (95% CI: 15.76–3.01; p
= 0.0054), and decrease in blood C-reactive protein (CRP) by 46.29 mg/L (95% CI:
71.34–21.24; p = 6.25 x 10-4), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) by 11.04 mm/h (95%
CI: 21.94–0.13; p = 0.047), and the fibrin degradation product D-dimer by 1098.52 ng/mL
(95% CI: 1932.84–264.19; p = 0.011).

CONCLUSIONS
Both ILCs and NK cells were depleted in the blood of people hospitalized for severe
COVID-19, but, among lymphoid cell subsets, only ILC abundance was independently
associated with the need for hospitalization, duration of hospital stay, and severity of
inflammation. These results indicate that, by promoting disease tolerance, homeostatic
ILCs protect against morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and suggest that
reduction in the number of ILCs with age and in males accounts for the increased risk of
severe COVID-19 in these demographic groups.

Introduction

The risk of disease severity in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 increases with age and
is greater for men than for women1–9. Similar trends exist in people infected with SARSCoV10–12 or MERS-CoV13, and have been observed in laboratory animals challenged with
SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-214,15. Yet, mechanisms underlying these effects of age and
sex on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality remain poorly understood. The composition and
function of the human immune system changes with age and exhibits sexual
dimorphism16–19, with consequences for susceptibility to infection, autoimmune disease,
and response to vaccination2,16,17,20–22. Better understanding of these effects might
provide clues as to why the clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is so variable.
Survival after infection with a pathogenic virus such as SARS-CoV-2 requires not
only that the immune system control and eliminate the pathogen, but that disease
tolerance mechanisms limit tissue damage caused by the pathogen or by host
inflammatory responses23–25. Genetic and environmental factors identified in animal
models influence disease tolerance mechanisms that promote host fitness without directly
inhibiting replication of the pathogen23–28. Particular lymphoid cell types, including CD4+
T cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), are implicated in promoting disease tolerance29–
34

. SARS-CoV-2 viral load does not discriminate symptomatic from asymptomatic

infection35–38, and this discrepancy between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and severity of
COVID-19 is especially pronounced in children, who rarely manifest severe COVID-1939–
42

, but may have viral loads as high as very sick adults43,44. These observations indicate

that age-dependent, disease tolerance mechanisms influence the severity of COVID-19.

COVID-19 severity correlates with lymphopenia45–50 and with reduction in specific
blood lymphoid cell populations47,51–54. Nonetheless, assessment of lymphoid cell
abundance, in the context of a disease for which age and sex are risk factors for severity,
is complicated by differences in lymphocyte abundance with age and sex16,17. The goal
of this observational study was to determine whether abundance of any blood lymphoid
cell population correlates independently with clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods
PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS
As part of a COVID-19 observational study, peripheral blood samples were collected from
91 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection at the Massachusetts General Hospital and
affiliated outpatient clinics. Request for access to coded patient samples was reviewed
by the Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness and approved by the
University of Massachusetts Medical School IRB (protocol #H00020836). Some
demographic, laboratory, and clinical outcome data were included with the coded
samples. Samples from 86 blood donors, either collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2
outbreak or from healthy individuals screened at a blood bank, were included as controls.

FLOW CYTOMETRY
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stained with panels of fluorescent
antibodies (Table S1) and detected on a BD Celesta flow cytometer using previously
established gating strategies55. Cell subsets were identified using FlowJoTM software
(Becton, Dickson and Company). Representative gating strategies are shown in Figure
S1.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA VISUALIZATION
Data were prepared for analysis with the tidyverse56 package, and visualized using the
ggplot257 and ggpubr58 packages, within the R computer software environment (version
4.0.2)59. Multiple linear regression analysis tested for independent effects of age, sex,

and COVID-19 status on log2 transformed cell counts measured by flow cytometry, using
the lm function in R. Pairwise group comparisons were performed on estimated marginal
means generated from multiple linear regression using the emmeans package60, with
multiple comparison correction using the Tukey adjustment. Association between log2
transformed cell counts and hospitalization, in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, was
determined with multiple logistic regression including age, sex, and duration of symptoms
at time of blood collection, as additional independent variables using the glm function in
R. Group differences in age and sex were determined with pairwise, two-sided, Wilcoxon
rank-sum tests, or Fisher’s exact test, as indicated, with Bonferroni correction for multiple
comparisons.

Results
THREE GROUPS OF BLOOD DONORS
The first group of blood donors included SARS-CoV-2-infected people hospitalized for
severe COVID-19 (N = 40), among whom 33 (82.5%) were admitted to the ICU, 32 (80%)
required intubation with mechanical ventilation, and 7 (17.5%) died (Table 1). This group
had a mean age of 57.6 (range 24 to 83) and was 60% male. The second group consisted
of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 but who did not require hospitalization for COVID19 (N=51). This group had a mean age of 36.8 years (range 23-77) and was 25.5% male
(Table 1). Differences between the two SARS-CoV-2-infected groups, in terms of median
age (p = 5.22 x 10-8) and sex ratio (p = 3.66 x 10-3) (Figure S2), were consistent with the
established greater risk of severe COVID-19 in older individuals and in males1–6,8,61. The
third group included 86 SARS-CoV-2-negative controls. The age of this group spanned
the range of the two SARS-CoV-2-infected groups (mean age 50.9; range 23 to 79) and
the percentage of males (56%) was similar to that of the hospitalized group (Table 1 and
Figure S2). Available information concerning ethnicity and race of the blood donors was
insufficient for statistical comparisons among the groups (Table S2).

SARS-CoV-2 INFECTION AND LYMPHOID CELL ABUNDANCE
The effect of COVID-19 severity on lymphocyte abundance was assessed by multiple
linear regression, with age, sex, and group (hospitalized, outpatient, and uninfected), as
independent variables. After accounting for effects of age and sex, total lymphocytes
among PBMCs were decreased 1.33-fold (95%CI: 1.49–1.19; p = 1.22 x 10-6) in

comparison to uninfected controls (Table S3). The abundance of specific lymphoid cell
populations, as a fraction of total lymphocytes, was then assessed. Holding age and sex
constant, individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 had 1.78-fold fewer ILCs (95%CI: 2.34–
1.36; p = 4.55 x 10-5) and 2.31-fold fewer CD16+ natural killer (NK) cells (95%CI: 3.1–
1.71; p = 1.04 x 10-7), than did uninfected controls (Table S4 and Figure 1). After
consideration of age and sex, neither CD4+ T cells nor CD8+ T cells were depleted (Table
S4 and Figure 1). SARS-CoV-2-infected people who were treated as outpatients had no
reduction in ILCs, but 1.44-fold fewer CD16+ NK cells (95%CI: 1.93–1.07; p = 1.68 x 102

), and 1.26-fold more CD4+ T cells (95%CI: 1.06–1.5; p = 0.01), than did uninfected

controls (Table S4 and Figure 1). Estimated marginal means for uninfected, hospitalized,
and outpatient groups, adjusted for age and sex, are shown in Figure 1. After accounting
for the effect of group, the effects of age and sex on lymphoid cell abundance was
consistent with previous reports16–19, with CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and ILCs decreasing
with age, CD16+ NK cells increasing with age, and both CD4+ T cells and ILCs less
abundant in males (Table S4 and Figure S3).

ASSOCIATION OF LYMPHOID CELL ABUNDANCE WITH HOSPITALIZATION
Association between lymphoid cell abundance and hospitalization in individuals infected
with SARS-CoV-2 was determined with multiple logistic regression, including age, sex,
and duration of symptoms at the time of blood draw, as additional independent variables.
Abundance of ILCs, but not of CD16+ NK cells, CD4+ T cells, or CD8+ T cells was
associated with odds of hospitalization: the odds ratio for hospitalization, adjusted for age,

sex, and symptom duration, was 0.413 (95%CI: 0.197–0.724; p = 0.00691), or a decrease
of 58.7%, for each 2-fold increase in ILC abundance (Table 2).

HOSPITALIZATION AND MARKERS OF INFLAMMATION
The relationship between lymphoid cell abundance and duration of hospital stay, or with

regression, including age, sex, and cell abundance as independent variables. Holding
age and sex constant, abundance of ILCs, but not of CD16+ NK cells, CD4+ T cells, or
CD8+ T cells, was associated with length of time in the hospital, and with blood levels of
markers associated with systemic inflammation (Table 3). Each two-fold increase in ILC
abundance was associated with a 9.38 day decrease in duration of hospital stay (95% CI:
15.76–3.01; p = 0.0054), 46.29 mg/L decrease in blood C-reactive protein (CRP) (95%
CI: 71.34–21.24; p = 6.25 x 10-4), and 11.04 mm/h decrease in erythrocyte sedimentation
rate (ESR) (95% CI: 21.94–0.13; p = 0.047). Abundance of both ILCs and CD4+ T cells
was associated with blood levels of the fibrin degradation product D-dimer, with each twofold increase in cell abundance associated with a decrease in D-dimer by 1098.52 ng/mL
(95% CI: 1932.84–264.19; p = 0.011) and 1868.85 ng/mL (95% CI: 3375.63–362.06; p =
0.016), respectively.

DISCUSSION
This study demonstrated that, after accounting for effects of age and sex, ILCs and CD16+
NK cells, but not CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, were decreased in individuals hospitalized with
COVID-19 (Table S4 and Figure 1). Among people infected with SARS-CoV-2, higher
abundance of ILCs, but not of NK cells or T cells, was associated with decreased odds of
hospitalization, shorter duration of hospitalization, and lower blood level of factors
associated with systemic inflammation (Table 3). Considering the known homeostatic
function of ILCs55,62–65 and the host responses necessary to survive pathogenic
infection23–25, these findings support the hypothesis that loss of disease tolerance
mechanisms increase the risk of morbidity and mortality with SARS-CoV-2 infection66.
ILCs and NK cells are innate immune lymphoid cells that lack clonotypic antigen
receptors but share many developmental and functional characteristics with T
cells30,62,63,67,68. Like CD8+ T cells, NK cells kill virus-infected cells using perforin and
granzyme30,67. FcγRIII (CD16)-positive NK cells link innate and acquired immunity by
binding virus-specific immunoglobulins that target virus-infected cells for antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity69. The lack of association in this study between the
abundance of these CD16+ NK cells and odds of hospitalization, duration of
hospitalization, or blood markers of inflammation, is consistent with the paradoxical
finding that individuals with severe COVID-19 have more robust SARS-CoV-2neutralizing antibody responses70,71. Findings such as these indicate that stronger
adaptive antiviral immune responses do not necessarily result in decreased morbidity and
improved survival.

ILCs represent innate counterparts of CD4+ T cells30,67 that promote tissue
homeostasis and repair55,62–65, maintaining the integrity of epithelial barriers in the lung
and intestine29–32. ILCs with a similar marker profile to those detected in the blood are
found in human lung and bronchoalveolar fluid29, and experiments with animal models
demonstrate that these ILCs promote airway epithelial integrity and restore tissue
homeostasis in the lung after challenge with influenza virus29. Reduction in blood ILCs in
people with HIV-1 infection correlates with decrease in colon lamina propria ILCs55,
suggesting that the reduction in blood ILCs reported here with SARS-CoV-2 reflects
tissue abundance of these cells. Decreased abundance of ILCs with increasing age and
male sex (Table S4 and Figure S3) may therefore explain why morbidity and mortality
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is worse in males and more severe with older
age1–6,8,61. This conclusion is also supported by the association reported here between
ILC abundance, odds of hospitalization, length of stay in the hospital, and levels of the
markers of COVID-19 severity, CRP, ESR, and D-dimer9,72–74 (Table 3).
In conclusion, these results support the idea that the clinical outcome of SARSCoV-2 infection is at least in part dependent upon disease tolerance mechanisms,
reflected in peripheral blood counts of homeostatic ILCs, and, additionally offer potential
explanation for the effects of age and sex on risk of morbidity and mortality. The findings
of this observational study warrant establishment of prospective cohort studies to
determine whether abundance of ILCs, or of other lymphoid cell subsets associated with
disease tolerance29–34, predict clinical outcome for infection with SARS-CoV-2 or other
lethal pathogens.

Figure S1: Representative gating strategy. All cell subsets were first gated on lymphoid
cells, singlets, live/dead, and CD45+ (A). ILCs were identified as Lin-CD56-CD16-CD127+
using 14 lineage markers (B). CD16+ NK cells were identified as Lin-TBX21+CD16+ (C).
CD4+ T cells were identified as Lin+CD4+ (D), and CD8+ T cells were identified as
Lin+CD8+ (E).

Figure S2: Age and fraction male of groups included in the study with P-values from
pairwise two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum and Fisher’s exact test, respectively, with
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Box plots represent the distribution of the
data with the center line drawn through the median with the upper and lower bounds of
the box at the 75th and 25th percentiles respectively. The upper and lower whiskers
extend to the largest or smallest values within 1.5 x the interquartile range (IQR). The
notch spans roughly the 95% confidence interval around the median as given by 1.58 x
IQR/n^0.5.

Figure S3: Visualization of change in log2 abundance of lymphoid cell populations with
age as determined with the regression analysis in Table S4. Regression lines, R2, and Pvalues are all from the associated multiple regression analyses and shading represents
the 95%CI (A). Sex differences in lymphoid cell abundance shown as estimated marginal
means ±95CI generated from the multiple linear regressions in Table S4 and averaged
across age and group.
