Acute myelitis after SARS-CoV-2 infection: A case report
Abstract
We report a case of acute myelitis in a patient infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A 66-year-old man with coronavirus disease 2019 was admitted
with acute flaccid paralysis of the bilateral lower limbs and urinary and bowel incontinence. All
serum microbiological test results were negative, except for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing.
Clinical findings indicated post-infectious acute myelitis. He received treatment containing
ganciclovir, lopinavir/ritonavir, moxifloxacin, dexamethasone, human immunoglobulin, and
mecobalamin. With a diagnosis of post-infectious acute myelitis and comprehensive treatment,
paralysis of the bilateral lower extremities ameliorated. After two negative novel coronavirus
RNA nasopharyngeal swab tests, he was discharged and transferred to a designated hospital for
isolation and rehabilitation therapy.
Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019[1].
It has been confirmed that this disease is caused by a new type of enveloped RNA coronavirus B,
which is named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)[2]. As
of April 3, 2020, there were 1017914 laboratory-confirmed cases worldwide, resulting in 53188
deaths. Studies have shown that the virus has 79% homology with the SARS virus[3], and the
potential intermediate animal host remains unknown, although it has been demonstrated that this
virus did not originate directly from pangolins[4]. Researchers have confirmed that SARS-CoV-2
enters the human body through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the
surface of human cells and causes disease[5]. ACE2 is expected to be a possible target for
intervention and treatment of the disease. ACE2 receptors are found in type II alveolar epithelial

cells of the human lungs; therefore, it has become the main target of SARS-CoV-2 in the
pathogenesis of COVID-19[6]. However, in the processes of clinical diagnosis and treatment, it
has been found that many critically ill patients exhibit symptoms of multiple organ dysfunction,
in addition to lung, liver, and kidney damage being very prominent, which may be related to the
expression of ACE2 in hepatic bile duct cells and proximal renal tubules[7,8].
ACE2 receptors are also expressed on the surface of spinal cord cells[9,10]. Whether spinal cord
neurons are implicated in COVID-19 remains unknown. We report a patient with COVID-19
who suddenly developed acute myelitis after an initial high fever, suggesting that the central
nervous system (CNS) may also be attacked by SARS-CoV-2.
Case presentation
A 66-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with fever and fatigue for 2 days in Wuhan,
China. He had no contact with patients with COVID-19. He developed a fever without an
obvious cause on February 8, 2020, and his highest body temperature was 39°C, with fatigue and
without cough, asthma, and dyspnea. He visited the outpatient clinic of a local hospital in Wuhan
and was administered oral moxifloxacin hydrochloride and oseltamivir for 5 days. On February
13, 2020, he underwent chest computed tomography (CT) in the local lung hospital, which
revealed patchy changes in both lungs (Figure 1A, B). The novel coronavirus (nCoV) RNA
nasopharyngeal swab test result was positive; he was diagnosed with mild COVID-19. He was
admitted to Wuhan Cabin Hospital and treated in individual isolation. After a high fever (40°C)
at night, he developed weakness in both lower limbs with urinary and bowel incontinence,
culminating in flaccid lower-extremity paralysis. His condition deteriorated rapidly, and he was
transferred to the intensive care unit for critical care and treatment. Examination of his vital
signs revealed the following results: oxygen saturation, <93% at rest; body temperature, 37°C;

pulse, 80 bpm; respiratory rate, 18 breaths/min; and blood pressure, 81/51 mmHg. No obvious
abnormality was found on cranial nerve examination. His neurologic examination demonstrated
3/5 power with normal reflexes in the bilateral upper extremities and 0/5 power reduction with
hyporeflexia in the bilateral lower extremities. Sensation was intact in all modalities in the arms
but was globally impaired in both legs. There was a sensory level at T10 to pinprick testing, with
feelings of paresthesia and numbness below the level. The tendon reflexes of both lower limbs
decreased, and pain, temperature, and tactile sensations decreased below the level of chest 10.
Bilateral pathological signs were negative.
The routine blood, C-reactive protein, serum amyloid protein, procalcitonin, and large
biochemistry test results after admission are shown in Table 1. On admission, the
carcinoembryonic antigen level was normal, serum ferritin level was >2000 (normal range
21.81–274.6 ng/mL), and electrolytes showed no obvious abnormality, except serum iron (Table
1). Hypersensitive troponin levels were normal. Blood lipids showed low high-density
lipoproteinemia, a high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level of 0.51 (1.16–1.42
mmol/L), and interleukin-6 level of 56.72 (0–7 pg/mL). Among pathogenic microbes, the
immunoglobulin M (IgM) of Chlamydia pneumoniae, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) antibody,
influenza B virus, adenovirus, coxsackievirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, influenza A virus,
parainfluenza virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and respiratory syncytial virus all tested negative.
T cells of tuberculosis infection were negative. The results of the nCoV RNA nasopharyngeal
swab are shown in Table 2. Before treatment on February 15, 2020, chest CT showed a patchy
high-density blurred shadow in the upper lobe of the left lung (Figure 1A) and patchy groundglass shadow in the anterior segment of the upper lobe of the right lung (Figure 1B), suggesting
viral pneumonia. Cranial CT revealed bilateral basal ganglia and paraventricular lacunar

infarction and brain atrophy (Figure 2). Cerebrospinal fluid serological testing and magnetic
resonance imaging of the spinal cord were not performed for pandemic-related reasons during
hospitalization.
Based on the positive 2019-nCoV test result, he was diagnosed with COVID-19. Based on the
acute flaccid myelitis of the lower limbs, urinary and bowel incontinence, and sensory level at
T10, the diagnosis of acute myelitis was more likely. After admission, oxygen inhalation
treatment with high-flow nasal catheters was administered. Meanwhile, the patient was received
comprehensive drug therapies: ganciclovir (0.5 g once daily) for 14 days, lopinavir/ritonavir (500
mg twice daily) for 5 days, moxifloxacin (400 mg once daily) for 6 days, meropenem (1 g twice
daily) for 8 days, glutathione (1.8 g once daily) for 12 days, dexamethasone (10 mg once daily)
for 10 days, human immunoglobulin (15 g once daily) for 7 days, mecobalamin (1000 µg once
daily) for 14 days, and pantoprazole (80 mg once daily) for 10 days. On the second day after
admission, the patient's body temperature returned to normal, and the oxygen saturation was
greater than 93% at rest. There was no occurrence of adverse drug reactions or contraindications.
His muscle strength in both upper limbs recovered to grade 4/5 and that in both lower limbs was
grade 1/5. Two nCoV RNA nasopharyngeal swab test results were negative with an interval of
more than one day. Re-examination of pulmonary CT showed that the lesions were absorbed and
met the discharge criteria of COVID-19. He was then discharged and transferred to a designated
hospital for isolation and rehabilitation therapy.
Discussion
Our report is the first to present a case of post-infectious myelitis in the world, indicating that
acute myelitis may be a neurological complication of COVID-19. Microbes including M.
pneumoniae, EBV, CMV, rhinovirus, and measles are implicated in post-infectious acute

myelitis[11-13]. M. pneumoniae may be one of the most widely recognized infections. A probable
hypothesis is that infectious organisms are targeted by the immune system, which also attacks
CNS tissue because of structural similarities between the microbial cellular wall components and
neuronal receptors[14]. In this study, the IgM antibodies for common infectious organisms
including M. pneumoniae, EBV, and CMV tested negative, and the symptoms of acute myelitis
occurred after high fever and the diagnosis of COVID-19, suggesting that 2019-nCov might be
the pathogenic virus. Moreover, a recent study showed that SARS-CoV-2 can enter the human
body via ACE2 receptors on the surface of human cells and cause disease[5]. It is intriguing that
ACE2 receptors are also expressed on the membrane of spinal cord neurons[9,10], further
suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is implicated in acute myelitis based on the specific ACE2
receptors on the surface of spinal cord neurons.
Based on our study, acute paralysis is a novel neurological symptom of COVID-19. An analysis
of the clinical characteristics of 1099 patients with COVID-19 showed that common symptoms
at the onset of the disease are fever (on admission in 43.8% of patients, and after admission in
88.7% of patients) and cough (67.8%), while neurological symptoms are rare[2]. However,
patients with severe COVID-19 are likely to develop neurological symptoms (such as headache,
dizziness, hypogeusia, and neuralgia) and complications, including acute cerebrovascular
diseases, impaired consciousness, and skeletal muscular injury[15].
According to the laboratory testing, we found that lymphopenia and eosinopenia occurred in the
early stage of COVID-19. The decrease in red blood cells and hemoglobin levels showed that the
bone marrow hematopoietic system was affected by SARS-CoV-2, which is expected to be
further confirmed by large-scale retrospective analysis. ACE2 is reportedly expressed in hepatic
bile duct cells and proximal renal tubules[7,8], and hepatic and renal dysfunctions are also

detected in patients with COVID-19[16]. The liver function in our patient was obviously damaged
with normal renal function, and elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate
aminotransferase reached a peak on the 15th day after disease onset, and then recovered
gradually. Meanwhile, the levels of total protein, albumin, and HDL-C significantly decreased
with disease progression, suggesting that metabolic abnormalities contributed to the pathogenesis
of COVID-19. However, the renal function was normal in this study, which was inconsistent
with that in a previous study. It has been reported that a decreased level of serum iron in patients
with pneumonia is an independent risk factor for in-hospital death[17]. The mechanism may be
related to the influence of pathogenic microorganism infection on iron uptake. In our patient, on
the 7th day of disease onset, the serum iron level was 1.8 μmol/L and gradually increased with
the treatment. The serum iron level returned to normal when the nucleic acid test result of 2019nCov was negative. The possible role of serum iron in the 2019-nCov infection warrants further
research in the future. We believe that an overactive inflammatory response and immune damage
occurred in COVID-19 for high levels of C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, interleukin-6, and
ferritin in our patient. Immune damage and cytokines released by inflammatory storms in the
early stage of COVID-19 might explain why the spinal cord was implicated in the disease.
Conclusion
Our report is the first to present a COVID-19 case with spinal cord involvement 1 week after the
onset of fever, wherein the clinical findings indicated post-infectious acute myelitis. Acute
myelitis may be a neurological complication of COVID-19.
