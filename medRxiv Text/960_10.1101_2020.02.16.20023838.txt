Abstract
Background
China is running a national level antivirus campaign against the novel coronavirus
(2019-nCoV). Strict control measures are being enforced in either the populated areas
and remote regions. While the virus is closed to be under control, tremendous
economic loss has been caused.
Methods and findings
We assessed the pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV for all cities/regions in China using the
random forest algorithm, taking into account the effect of five factors: the
accumulative and increased numbers of confirmed cases, total population, population
density, and GDP. We defined four levels of the risk, corresponding to the four
response levels to public health emergencies in China. The classification system has
good consistency among cities in China, as the error rate of the confusion matrix is
1.58%.
Conclusions
The pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV is dramatically different among the 442
cities/regions. We recommend to adopt proportionate control policy according to the
risk level to reduce unnecessary economic loss.
Key words: city closure, highway blocking, quarantine, epidemic control, public
health, transmission risk

1. Introduction
The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has infected 66,576 people and caused 1524
deaths in China by Feb. 15, 2020 [1]. It has spread to 25 countries [1] with the
potential of further transmission [2-4]. On Jan. 30, 2020, the World Health
Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak to be “public health
emergency of international concern” [5]. The countries with local infection of 2019nCoV, such as Japan and Singapore, are implementing a moderate prevention policy
against this flu-like infectious disease, similar to the situation of Wuhan in early
January, 2020.
On the contrary, China is running a national level antivirus campaign. All of the
31 provinces and province-level municipalities in mainland China have initiated the
first-level response to public health emergencies after the city closure of Wuhan on
Jan. 23, 2020. Very strict control measures are enforced all over the country, such as
tourism ban, school closure, meeting cancelation, etc. Compared with the prevention
activities against SARS 17 years ago, traffic control and community locking are much
more stricter, let alone the unprecedented province lockdown that constraining over
58 million people locally [6].
As a result, the control of 2019-nCoV in China is very effective [6-9]. The
increases of the number of confirmed cases in most cities has dropped. No new cases
have emerged in more than half cities in China on Feb. 14. While the half-lockout of
industry, traffic, and school, etc., people are wondering how long the campaign will
last and how soon the they can return to normal life.
We evaluated the risk of 2019-nCoV outbreak in cities and regions across China
and suggested four levels of risk, highlighting that the cities with low risk should
return to the normal status in order to avoid unnecessary economic loss.
2. Methods
Data
We compiled the number of daily confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV (Fig.1) from the
platform of real time epidemic situation for every city hosted by Baidu ™ at
(https://voice.baidu.com/act/newpneumonia/newpneumonia/?from=osari_pc_1). We

downloaded the data of population and gross domestic product (GDP) for every city
in 2018 from the website of the National Bureau of Statistics of China at
http://data.stats.gov.cn/easyquery.htm?cn=E0105 (Fig. 2A & 2C). The georeferenced
data of the political boundaries of all prefecture level cities were provided by Institute
of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of
Sciences. The population density of the cities was calculated by dividing the
population by the areas of the city (Fig. 2B).

across China on Feb. 14, 2020.

Model
We used the random forest algorithm [10] and developed the following model:
Yi ~ Ni + ΔNi + Popi + Densityi + GDPi (Equation 1)
where Yi is the response level of city i to public health emergencies; Ni is the number
of cumulative confirmed cases on Feb. 14 in city i; ΔNi is the increased number of
cases on Feb. 14 in city i; Popi, Densityi, and GDPi are the population size, population
density, and GDP of city i, respectively.
The purpose of above model is to assign a response level, Yi for each city. In the
beginning, we manually assigned Yi =1 for the top 10 cities with 2019-nCoV
infection, and Yi =4 for the 10 least infected cities. Then we gave random numbers for
Yi from {1, 2, 3, 4} to the rest of cities. We built the random forest model RF using
Equation 1. RF contains the relationship between the dependent and independent
variables. We used RF to predict the Yi for every city, and used the newly calculated
Yi to update RF. We repeated the model learning process for 5-6 times until a low
error rate was reached. In practice, we first defined Yi as a continuous variable,

quantifying the trend of Y using the five explanatory variables; and then defined Yi as
a categorical variable, classifying the response level of each city. At last, we manually
assigned all cities (except for Shennongjia Forestry District, where has only 10 cases
of 2019-nCoV) in Hubei Province with the highest category, the level I. The data and
R code were posted at https://github.com/Xinhai-Li/2019-nCoV.

3. Results
Our model classified 442 cities with the four levels of response for public health
emergencies (Fig. 3). There are 16 cities, all in Hubei Province, being assigned with
the highest risk, the level I. The number of cities that were classified as risk levels II,
III, and IV are 60, 67, and 299, respectively (Fig .3).

The risk level of cities was classified using five variables, whereas the variables
had different weights in the model, quantified by importance indices in random forest
model [11] (Fig. 4).

4. Discussion
We assessed the risk level of 2019-nCoV outbreak for 442 cities in China based on
five variables. The cumulative number of confirmed cases represents the size of the
2019-nCoV outbreak. The increased number of cases indicates the dynamics of virus
transmission. Population size of a city is the key variable for epidemics, which is
directly associated with the potential outbreak size. Population density is also an
important factor, since dense population would accelerate virus transmission.
Similarly, GDP is an index of economic activities, which links to human flow and
virus transmission rate.
We used a machine learning algorithm, random forest, to classify the risk levels.
One reason is that variables such as population size, population density and GDP are
highly correlated. Random forest is very robust when multicollinearity is severe [12].
Another reason is that the numbers of cases are unbalanced among cities. In Wuhan,
there are 39,249 confirmed cases by Feb. 16, whereas other large cities have a few
hundred cases. Traditional linear models can not fit well with such a data distribution.

The purpose of our study is to provide a risk map of 2019-nCoV outbreak, so as
to facilitate decision makers to adjust virus prevention policy. It is a great challenge to
fight effectively and appropriately against a pandemic [13, 14], especially when we do
not know much about the novel coronavirus [2, 15]. Rational and proportionate
responses to such a virus outbreak are needed. At present, the strict control measures,
for the areas with minor infection (which is under control), are overreacted.
The transmission of 2019-nCoV in cities outside Hubei Province is largely
suspended [6]. From Feb.13 to Feb. 14, there are 231 cities have no new cases, and
another 39 cities have only one new case (Fig. 1B). The risk in the Tibet Autonomous
Region, Qinghai Province, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Gansu Province, and
Western Inner Mongolia Autonomous region is very low. We suggest rational,
proportionate control measures (Table 2). For example, the cities with the risk level
IV (Fig. 3) should return to normal status, under the condition of border control, in
case of imported infections from high risk areas.

There is a high probability that a few transmission clusters of 2019-nCoV would
happen after loosing the control in several provinces. Under such circumstance, the
cities where virus returned should be managed again under higher level of responses
to the public health emergencies.
Fighting against 2019-nCoV would be a long process, due to the three
characteristics of this epidemics (long incubation period, asymptomatic infection, and
high-false-negative-rate diagnosis) [6]. The transmission of 2019-nCoV is naturally
(exponentially) growing in Japan and Singapore, increasing the risk of a global
outbreak. Even after this transmission wave, 2019-nCoV might come back in every
winter. As such, proportionate control is especially important for sustainable protect
human from the infectious diseases.
