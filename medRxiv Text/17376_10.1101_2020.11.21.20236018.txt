Abstract

Epidemiological studies suggest that the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine may have
protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); and, there are now more than 15
ongoing clinical trials seeking to determine if BCG vaccination can prevent or reduce the severity
of COVID-19 (1). However, the mechanism by which BCG vaccination can induce a severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific T cell response is unknown. Here, in
silico, we identify 8 BCG derived peptides with significant sequence homology to either SARS-CoV2 NSP3 or NSP13 derived peptides. Using an in vitro co-culture system, we show that human CD4+
and CD8+ T cells primed with a BCG derived peptide developed enhanced reactivity to its
corresponding SARS-CoV-2 derived peptide. As expected, HLA differences between individuals
meant that not all persons developed immunogenic responses to all 8 BCG derived peptides.
Nevertheless, all of the 20 individuals that were primed with BCG derived peptides developed
enhanced T cell reactivity to at least 7 of 8 SARS-CoV-2 derived peptides. These findings provide
a mechanistic basis for the epidemiologic observation that BCG vaccination confers protection
from COVID-19; and supports the use of BCG vaccination to induce cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2
specific T cell responses.

Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19), an infection for which no specific vaccine is currently available (2, 3). T cells are
reported to be pivotal in mounting a successful immune response against COVID-19 as recovered
individuals exhibit SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell memory and T cell dysfunction, and imbalance has
been reported as a hallmark of severe COVID-19 (4, 5). Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been
implicated in COVID-19 with CD4+ T cells being broadly Th1-like by the secretion of cytokines
interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon gamma (IFN-) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and CD8+ T cells
also secreting TNF and IFN- as well as effecting direct target cell lysis through the secretion of
perforin and granzymes (6). Cross-reactive T cells between other human coronaviruses and SARSCoV-2 have been identified, suggesting the potential role for T cell cross-protection in COVID-19
(7, 8). Here we investigated whether cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells can arise from
Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-derived peptide sensitization.

BCG vaccine containing live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis, hereafter referred to as BCG,
typically vaccinates against tuberculosis (TB).

It can also induce cross-protection against

pathogens unrelated to TB. The cross-protective effects have shown to reduce all-cause mortality
in children and respiratory tract infections in adults (9-12). One mechanism of cross-protection is
through BCG epigenetically modifying innate immune cells in the form of trained innate immunity
lasting up to one year (13, 14). The heterologous effect of BCG vaccination on T cells has been
demonstrated in other viral infections such as murine vaccinia virus and HPV papillomatosis (1518).

Given the heterologous effects of BCG vaccination, more than 15 clinical trials are currently
underway globally to test the cross-protective effect of BCG in COVID-19, most notably the BRACE
study involving 10,000 healthcare workers in Australia and the Netherlands (1). Although reports
from these prospective trials are still forthcoming, large country-level epidemiological analyses
have shown a negative correlation between BCG vaccination status of a country and COVID-19
disease severity or case growth (19-21).
Here we show that the observed benefits of BCG vaccination in the context of COVID-19 can be
attributed, in part, to T cell cross-reactivity.

Results and Discussion

SARS-CoV-2 amino acid homology with BCG:
T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 are being increasingly characterised and recognised as pivotal in
mounting a successful immune response to COVID-19 (6). To study the extent that BCG-primed T
cells could cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 epitopes and promote viral clearance, we first performed
NCBI Protein Blast searches against the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, restricting results to BCG proteins.
Regions of protein sequence homology were identified between BCG sequences and the nonstructural proteins NSP3 and NSP13 located in ORF1ab of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1 and table S1). When
processed as 15mers for MHCII presentation, these regions exhibit up to 60% identity and 73.3%
similarity between BCG and SARS-CoV-2 (table S1). Percent identity and similarity of constituent
9mers for MHCI presentation are up to 88.8% and 100%, respectively, permitting cross-reactive
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses.

NSP3 is a papain-like proteinase that shares a macro domain with the BCG proteins: macrodomain-containing protein and UPF0189 protein. This macro-domain-containing protein is
conserved among the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex including BCG (accession number
WP_003909539.1). NSP13 is a helicase that shares homology with BCG proteins RecB nuclease
and zinc-metalloprotease-FtsH. Both RecB nuclease and zinc-metalloprotease-FtsH contain a
walker-A-motif sequence that is identical in NSP13 of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, RecB nuclease
contains two other regions of homology with NSP13 around amino acid residues 952-966 and
1093-1107. As has been previously reported, NSP13 is highly conserved between other human
coronaviruses. Thus, the T cell cross-protective potential of BCG holds not only for SARS-CoV-2 as
we have shown but potentially with other human coronaviruses that cause the common cold
(229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1) and the more serious human coronaviruses SARS-CoV and Middle
East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). NSP3 is, however, not as widely conserved
among coronaviruses (7, 22).

In order for cross-reactivity to occur between T cells that share epitope homology, a significant
degree of homology must also be paired with the capacity of an immunogenic peptide to bind
cognate MHC class I or II. Indeed, HLA binding has been reported as important in COVID-19
severity. Patients with mild COVID-19 presented MHCI molecules with a higher theoretical affinity
than those with moderate to severe COVID-19 (23). To assess the capacity of BCG epitopes to bind
HLA alleles that broadly cover the global population, we performed in silico prediction analyses of
peptide-MHC binding affinity using NetMHCIIpan 4.0 and NetMHCpan 4.1 across each region of
homology as 9mers or 15mers overlapping by 1 amino acid residue in MHCI and MHCII binding,
respectively (24). HLA alleles in the analysis were selected based on previously reported reference

sets giving maximal global population coverage (25, 26). We found that the BCG derived peptides
with homologous sequences to SARS-CoV-2 peptides exhibited broad MHC class II and MHC I
binding capacity (Figs S1 and S2).

To determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of these BCG derived peptides across diverse
HLA-types, we selected 10 healthy HLA-typed blood donors with different HLA types (Table S2b).
Based on IEDB population coverage, our collection of HLA-typed individuals gave a global MHC
Class I and II coverage of 97.21% and 99.97%, respectively (27). In addition, binding affinity
predictions of the homologous peptides to HLA alleles from the 10 HLA-typed donors used in this
study were analysed (Figs. S1 & S2). Based on homology and strong binding, a selection of eight
different 15mer peptide pairs (PP1-8) were chosen for subsequent experimentation on human
donors (Fig. 1). To determine if HLA-typing was necessary, we also tested the cross-reactive
immunogenicity of the BCG derived peptides on 10 non-HLA-typed persons.

T cell cross reactivity:
To determine if priming with BCG peptide enhances T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 peptides, we
compared CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV2 peptides using cells that were either
primed with a control peptide (invariant chain peptide, CLIP) or BCG peptide. CD3+ T cells were
isolated from donors (n=20, table S2a) and co-cultured with dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro (Fig. 3).
Individual BCG peptides were first used to sensitize and expand the BCG-specific T cells, simulating
a BCG vaccination. T cells were then rested for two days without antigen stimulation then restimulated with the SARS-CoV-2 peptides. To measure T cell responses, we performed

intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) for IFN-, TNF, IL-2, perforin; surface staining for the early T
cell activation marker CD69, and a two-colour proliferation assay to differentiate between a
primary proliferative and secondary proliferative response using a combination of both Cell Trace
Yellow (CTY) and Cell Trace Violet (CTV). A positive response was defined as an increase compared
to control.

All individuals (n=20) exhibited a positive response to at least 7 out of 8 SARS-CoV-2 peptides (Fig.
2). The enhanced positive cross-reactive response confirms the prediction of high HLA binding
affinity and we confirm these cross-reactive peptides are immunogenic as they elicit CD4+ Th1like responses and robust CD8+ responses.

Next, we assessed the degree of SARS-CoV-2 T cell reactivity enhancement conferred by BCG
priming compared to control primed T cells (Fig. 3 and Figs. S5 & S6). In CD8+ cytotoxic T cells,
IFN-, TNF and IL-2 cytokine production across all 8 peptide pairs significantly increased (Fig. 3 and
Fig. S5a). The IFN- mean fold increase in expression ranged from 2.3-fold (PP3) to 16.3-fold (PP4).
Mean fold increase in TNF expression from CD8+ cells ranged from 1.7-fold (PP6) to 23.9-fold
(PP2). IL-2 production from CD8+ cells showed a mean fold increase from 3.1-fold (PP2) to 33.1fold (PP5).

CD4+ T helper cells exhibited similarly significantly increased IFN-, TNF and IL-2 production across
all 8 peptide pairs (Fig. 3 and Fig. S6a). In CD4+ cells from responder individuals, IFN- mean fold
increase in expression ranged from 1.7-fold (PP2, PP5 & PP7) to 12.9-fold (PP8). Mean fold
increase in TNF from CD4+ cells ranged from 2.9-fold (PP8) to 14.1-fold (PP2 & PP5). IL-2
production from CD4+ cells showed a mean fold increase from 2.1-fold (PP5) to 12.3-fold (PP8).

Patterns of cytokine production were varied between individuals and peptide pairs which is
reflected in the complex pattern of T cell cytokine expression and phenotypes that BCG
vaccination is known to produce (28). Indeed, the IFN- and TNF response was mixed with some
individuals making only IFN- or TNF in response to a particular peptide pair and some being
positive for both (Fig. S8). This observation is concordant with previously reported responses in
COVID-19 (6, 7).

Since the COVID-19 CD8+ response involves the secretion of perforin and granzymes for an
effective antiviral response, we measured perforin expression by ICS. We found that CD8+ T cells
primed with BCG-derived peptides had an enhanced perforin expression upon SARS-CoV-2
restimulation when compared to control primed cells (Fig. S5b). Cross-reactive perforin
expression in responders was significantly increased across all 8 peptide pairs with a mean foldincrease ranging from 1.9-fold (PP1) to 47.2-fold (PP4). Thus, cross-reactive CD8+ T cells can effect
an antiviral response by target cell lysis.

In order to mount an effective T cell response to COVID-19, antigen-specific T cells need to
become activated and undergo clonal expansion. To assess whether T cells pre-stimulated with
BCG-derived peptides exhibit enhanced T cell activation when restimulated with SARS-CoV-2
homologues, expression of early T cell activation marker CD69 was assessed by flow cytometry.
We show that when compared to a SARS-CoV-2 primary response, the BCG primed T cells
increased CD69 expression across all 8 peptide pairs (Figs. 5c, 6c). CD69 expression in responders
showed a mean fold-increase ranging from 3.2-fold (PP1) to 29.6-fold (PP5) for CD4+ cells and

from 1.7-fold (PP1) to 10.5-fold (PP2) for CD8+ cells. These cross-reactive T cells that show
increased activation when primed with BCG peptides and restimulated with SARS-CoV-2
homologues, are able to proliferate and produce superior effector functions than those not
presensitized with BCG peptides. This may be of importance in swift and effective viral clearance
of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients.

To assess whether T cells primed with BCG derived peptides show enhanced T cell proliferation
upon SARS-CoV-2 peptide restimulation, cell proliferation dye CTY was used to assess the
proliferation after BCG priming followed by CTV to assess the proliferation after SARS-CoV-2
restimulation. All donor samples primed with a BCG peptide developed enhanced T cell
proliferation to at least 3 out of the 8 SARS-CoV-2 peptides tested (Fig. 2). The magnitude of the
enhanced proliferative response was also assessed in BCG-primed individuals who responded
SARS-CoV-2 restimulation. Specifically, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 peptide induced
proliferation in cells that were first sensitized with BCG peptide or with control peptide. In all of
the tested peptide pairs (PP1-PP8) and across both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, BCG peptide sensitized
cells developed significantly enhanced proliferation to its SARS-CoV-2 homologous peptide (Fig.
4). In the responders, T cell proliferation was enhanced in CD8+ T cells between 19% (PP3 and
PP5) to 51% (PP6) and in CD4+ T cells by 11% (PP5) to 39% (PP8). Therefore, we show that BCG
peptides have the ability to cross-protect against SARS-CoV-2 by T cell activation and heightened
T cell proliferation.

To confirm and establish the T memory cell phenotype of proliferated T cells after BCG
stimulation, the proportion of T effector memory (Tem), T central memory (Tcm) and T effector
memory re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRA) cells were determined based on CD45RA and CCR7
expression patterns on the proliferated CD4+ or CD8+ cells (Fig. S7). Across all 8 tested BCG
peptides, greater than 99% of proliferated BCG-stimulated cells exhibited Tcm, Tem or TEMRA
memory phenotype at day 16, the rest being naïve phenotype (CD45RA+, CCR7+). Of these
memory cells, Tem was the predominant phenotype of CD4+ and CD8+ cells. CD4+ cells exhibited
a minor subpopulation of Tcm and few TEMRA and CD8+ cells exhibited a minor subpopulation of
TEMRA and few Tcm. Therefore, T memory phenotypes predominate in BCG-stimulated T cells
providing an explanation for their potential to heighten recall responses.

Although the self-reported BCG vaccination status of our donors was known (n=10), we found no
significant difference in responses from BCG vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated
individuals (data not shown). The co-culture assay was not designed to test the direct ex vivo recall
response of prior BCG vaccination but rather to simulate vaccination in vitro by pre-stimulating
with BCG-derived peptides. We analysed an equal number of males and females in this study
(n=10 each) and no significant sex-specific differences were found in the parameters measured
(data not shown).

Conclusions
Collectively, our results demonstrate that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells specific for BCG derived peptides
are cross-reactive with SARS-CoV-2 peptides. These data provide a mechanistic explanation for

All donors provided written informed consent. Donors with prior known TB or COVID-19 infection
were excluded. Donors with current or recent symptoms of COVID-19 or who tested positive for
serum IgG or IgM SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by SARS-CoV-2 Colloidal Gold Immunochromatography
Assay Kit (MyBioSource) were excluded. Prior BCG vaccination status was self-reported. Twenty
donors were recruited into the study and their details summarized in table S2a,b. Whole blood
was collected by venepuncture into K2EDTA vacutainer tubes (BD) for cell isolation or serum
separator tubes (BD) for autologous serum collection.
HLA binding prediction and allele coverage:
Global allele coverage of HLA-typed donors was assessed at IEDB Analysis Resource – Population
Coverage (27). NetMHCpan-4.1 and NetMHCIIpan-4.0 were used to predict binding affinity of
homologous peptides to a globally representative collection of MHCI or MHCII alleles plus the
alleles of our HLA-typed donors using artificial neural networks (24-26). For each region of
homology, 9mers for MHCI and 15mers for MHCII overlapping by 1 amino acid underwent affinity
analysis. Affinity rank was generated that normalizes prediction score by comparing to prediction
of a set of random peptides. An affinity rank score of < 2 was called a strong binder. An affinity
rank score of ≥ 2 and 10 was called a binder. An affinity rank score of > 10 was called a nonbinder.

BCG UPF0189 protein (AHM07651.1), BCG Macro domain containing protein (WP_003909539.1),
BCG zinc metalloprotease FtsH (AMC52863.1) and human CLIP (NP_001020330.1) were obtained
from the NCBI Database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/). Sequence alignment of SARSCoV-2 and BCG homologues was performed using EMBOSS Needle Pairwise Sequence Alignment
(29).
Peptides:
15mer peptides were synthesised with an N-terminal free amine (H-) and a free acid group at the
C-terminus (-OH). Peptides were ≥ 90% pure as assessed by reversed-phase high-performance
liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) (Mimotopes). Peptide sequences used in this study can be
found in table S1 and control peptide CLIP103-117 (PVSKMRMATPLLMQA). Lyophilized peptide was
reconstituted in sterile MilliQ water with 5% (v/v) DMSO (Sigma). Final concentration of peptides
used in culture was 10g/mL and final concentration of DMSO in the cultures was 0.005% (v/v).
Monocyte derived DC production:
Human PBMCs were freshly isolated from whole donor blood in K2EDTA anticoagulant
Vacutainers (BD) using Lymphoprep density gradient medium (Stemcell) and SepMate tubes
(Stemcell). PBMCs were enumerated in a haemocytometer with trypan blue 0.4% (Sigma) and the
CD14+ CD16- monocytes were then magnetically separated using EasySep Human Monocyte
Isolation Kit and EasySep Magnet following manufacturer’s instructions (Stemcell). Freshly
isolated monocytes were then enumerated in a haemocytometer with 0.4% trypan blue and
differentiation culture was established to differentiate the monocytes into dendritic cells using
ImmunoCult Dendritic Cell Culture Kit following instructions of the manufacturer (Stemcell).
According to the protocol (Stemcell), immature DCs used in the ICS co-culture did not receive

co-culture received maturation supplement on day 5 of culture. After 7 days culture, immature
DCs were used for the ICS co-culture and mature DCs were used for the proliferation co-culture.
T cell isolation
Human CD3+ T cells were isolated from fresh whole donor blood in K2EDTA tubes using
RosetteSep HLA T Cell Enrichment Cocktail according to instructions of the manufacturer
(Stemcell). Isolated CD3+ T cells were enumerated in a haemocytometer with 0.4% trypan blue
(Sigma). CD3+ T cells were then used in the ICS and proliferation co-cultures.
ICS co-culture setup:
ICS co-culture was initiated with 100,000 freshly isolated human CD3+ T cells, 10,000 human
immature monocyte-derived DCs and 10ug/mL of BCG peptide from PP1-8 (Fig. 1) or control
peptide CLIP103-117 in a 96 well round-bottom plate (Corning) at 100uL per well of complete RPMI
(Gibco) supplemented with 10% autologous human serum, 100 U/mL penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL
streptomycin (Gibco), 2mM L-glutamine (Gibco) and 50M 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Positive
assay control received anti-human CD2, anti-human CD3, and anti-human CD28 coated MACS
iBeads at a ratio of 1 bead:2cells prepared from the human T cell activation/expansion kit as per
the manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi). Negative assay control received no peptides. Coculture was incubated at 37C in a CO2 incubator (Binder). Five days later, the co-culture was
supplemented with 40IU/mL recombinant human IL-2 (Stemcell) and reincubated. On day 7 of coculture, cells were rested by washing twice in 250uL PBS to remove peptides and resuspended in
100uL fresh complete RPMI formulated as above with no peptides and reincubated. On day 9 of
co-culture, cells were restimulated by washing twice with 250L PBS then 10,000 freshly-cultured,

immature DCs were added per well with 10g/mL of SARS-CoV-2 peptide from PP1-8 (Fig. 1) or
control peptide CLIP103-117 and 1g/mL anti-human CD28 monoclonal antibody (clone CD28.2,
eBioscience) in serum-free RPMI. Positive assay control received anti-human CD2, anti-human
CD3, and anti-human CD28 coated MACS iBeads at a ratio of 1 bead:2cells. Negative assay control
received no peptides. To pulse the DCs with peptide, co-culture was incubated for 2 hours at 37C
in a CO2 incubator (Binder). After 2 hours, media was adjusted to contain 10% autologous serum
and 1X protein transport inhibitor cocktail containing brefeldin A and monensin (eBioscience) was
added and reincubated. After 6 hours at 37C in a CO2 incubator, cells were harvested for flow
cytometric analysis by ICS. The entire culture system was setup to be autologous.
Proliferation co-culture setup:
Proliferation co-culture was initiated with 100,000 freshly isolated CD3+ T cells stained with cell
proliferation dye Cell Trace Yellow according to the manufacturer (Invitrogen), 10,000 human
mature DCs and 10g/mL of BCG peptide from PP1-8 (Fig. 1) or control peptide CLIP103-117 in a 96
well round-bottom plate (Corning) at 100uL per well of complete RPMI (Gibco) supplemented
with 10% autologous human serum, 100 U/mL penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin (Gibco),
2mM L-glutamine (Gibco) and 50M 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Positive assay control received

CO2 incubator for 7 days then harvested for flow cytometric analysis. The entire culture system
was setup to be autologous.
ICS flow cytometry staining and analysis:
After culturing, cells were stained with Live/Dead Fixable Near Infra-Red Dead Cell Stain Kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Cells were then stained with surface
markers anti-human CD3 Brilliant Violet 510 (clone OKT3, Biolegend), anti-human CD4 APC (clone
OKT4, eBioscience), anti-human CD8 Alexa Fluor 488 (clone HIT8a, Biolegend) and anti-human
CD69 Brilliant UV 395 (clone FN50, BD). After surface staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized
with Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(eBioscience). Cells were subsequently stained for intracellular markers with anti-human IFN- PE
Cy7 (clone 4S.B3, eBioscience), anti-human TNF Brilliant Violet 421 (clone Mab11, Biolegend),
anti-human IL-2 Brilliant Blue 700 (clone MQ1-17H12, BD) and anti-human perforin PE (clone BD48, Biolegend). Single colour controls were prepared using UltraComp eBeads (Invitrogen) for
single colour control antibodies and ArC amine reactive compensation bead kit (Invitrogen) for
Live/Dead single colour control. After staining, cells were resuspended in PBS and acquired on an
LSR-Fortessa X20 flow cytometer (BD) using BD FACSDiva software version 8.0.1. Samples were
analyzed in FlowJo 10.6.2. FMO controls were used to determine positive gating (Fig. S3).

defined as showing positive staining after subtraction of the primary SARS-CoV-2 response control
(CLIP103-117 primed, SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulated). A non-responder was defined as showing no
positive staining after subtraction of the primary SARS-CoV-2 response control. For statistical
analysis (Fig. 3, Figs. S5 & S6), the responders were selected as those with positive staining after
subtraction of the primary SARS-CoV-2 response control or restimulation background control
(BCG primed, irrelevant peptide CLIP restimulated). The responders then had the restimulation
background control (BCG primed and CLIP103-117 restimulated) subtracted from the corresponding
BCG primed, SARS-CoV-2 test sample and the primary SARS-CoV-2 response control to remove
any assay related background stimulation.
Proliferation flow cytometry staining and analysis:
After culturing, cells were stained with Live/Dead Fixable Near Infra-Red Dead Cell Stain Kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were then stained with surface markers antihuman CD3 PerCP (clone SK7, Biolegend), anti-human CD4 APC (clone OKT4, eBioscience), antihuman CD8 Alexa Fluor 488 (clone HIT8a, Biolegend), anti-human CD45RA Brilliant Violet 711
(clone HI100, Biolegend) and anti-human CCR7 Brilliant UV (clone 3D12, BD). Single colour
controls were prepared using UltraComp eBeads (Invitrogen) for single colour control antibodies,
ArC amine reactive compensation bead kit (Invitrogen) for Live/Dead single colour control and
Cell Trace Violet and Cell Trace Yellow single stained co-cultured cells along with unstained cocultured cells. After staining, cells were resuspended in 0.5% BSA, 2mM EDTA/PBS and acquired
on an LSR-Fortessa X20 flow cytometer (BD) using BD FACSDiva software version 8.0.1. .fcs files

showed a proliferation response when BCG primed, SARS-CoV-2 restimulated (Fig. 2) were
defined as showing positive staining after subtraction of the primary SARS-CoV-2 response control
(CLIP103-117 primed, SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulated). A non-responder was defined as showing no
positive staining after subtraction of the primary SARS-CoV-2 response control. For statistical
analysis (Fig. 4), the responders were selected as those with positive staining after subtraction of
the primary SARS-CoV-2 response control or restimulation background control (BCG primed,
irrelevant peptide CLIP restimulated). Proliferation in response to BCG priming and SARS-CoV-2
restimulation was calculated as the proportion of CD4+ or CD8+ cells that underwent proliferation
post-priming and post-restimulation (CTYloCTVlo) of total proliferated cells (CTYloCTVlo and CTYlo
CTVhigh).
Statistics:
Flow cytometry data was exported from FlowJo 10.6.2 (BD) and analysed using R Studio version
1.3.959 before being analysed in GraphPad Prism 7 (Graphpad Software Inc.). A Shapiro Wilk test
was used to determine normality followed by a two-tailed, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank
test to compare the responses of BCG primed with control primed samples from responders.

Figure S4: Flow Cytometry Gating Strategy for T cell proliferation and memory
T cell proliferation and memory gating strategy. a) Forward scatter area (FSC-A) versus side scatter
area (SSC-A) density plot gating the lymphocyte population. b) Side scatter height (SSC-H) versus
SSC-A density plot gating the single cell population. c) Live dead discrimination dye (LD Near IR)
versus SSC-A density plot gating the alive cell population. d) CD3 versus SSC-A density plot gating
the CD3+ T cells. e) The CD3+ cells are separated into CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. f) The proliferation
dyes Cell Trace Yellow (CTY) versus Cell Trace Violet (CTV) density plots are quadrant gated based
on proliferation after priming and restimulation. Q5 – CTYlow CTVhigh T cells that proliferated after
priming but not after restimulation. Q6 – CTYhigh CTVhigh T cells that did not proliferate after
priming or restimulation. Q7 CTYhigh CTVlow T cells that did not proliferate after priming but
proliferated after restimulation. Q8 – CTYlow CTVlow T cells that proliferated both after priming and
restimulation. g) The CD45RA versus CCR7 density plots of the CD4 +or CD8+ parent populations
are quadrant gated separating the Q1 - CD45RA- CCR7+ (T central memory cells), Q2 - CD45RA+
CCR7+ (Naïve T cells), Q3 - CD45RA+ CCR7- (TEMRA cells), and Q4 - CD45RA- CCR7- (T effector
memory cells). All fluorescence based gating except CTY and CTV is determined based on
fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls. CTV and CTY gating is based on the point at which the
first cell division took place visible by fluorescence dye dilution.

Figure S7| BCG-stimulated T cells express memory phenotypes.
BCG-peptide-stimulation of T cells produces > 99% T memory phenotype after 16 days co-culture.
T effector memory (Tem) is the dominant memory phenotype for both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. CD8+
T cells exhibit a subpopulation of T effector memory re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRA) with minimal
T central memory (Tcm). CD4+ T cells exhibit a subpopulation of Tcm with minimal TEMRA. a)
Composition of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell memory subpopulations in BCG UPF0189 protein25-39 (from
peptide pair 6) primed T cells, cultured for 16 days; 7 days with peptide and 9 days without
peptide. A representative sample of 5 individuals (from n = 20) from 1 peptide pair (from n=8). b)
Representative dot plots of CD45RA versus CCR7 expression of the proliferated CD4 + or CD8+ T
cells based on Cell Trace Violet dilution. T memory phenotype was characterised as three
subpopulations by expression of CD45RA and CCR7. Tem of phenotype CD45RA- and CCR7-. Tcm
of phenotype CD45RA- and CCR7+. TEMRA of phenotype CD45RA+ CCR7-. Non-memory T naïve of
phenotype CD45RA+ CCR7+.

Figure S8| TNF IFN- proportions of responder individuals.
BCG-primed individuals who responded to SARS-CoV-2-peptide restimulation mostly exhibited a
strong IFN- signature with a lower proportion of TNF, although some individuals showed a
dominant TNF response. Across individuals and peptide pairs, a variable proportion of IFN- SP,
TNF SP and IFN-, TNF DP was observed. A selection of 6 individuals CD4+ and CD8+ responses (of
N = 20 tested) against 5 peptide pairs (PP) of 8 peptide pairs tested. IFN- single positive (SP) –
proportion of cells producing IFN- and not TNF. TNF SP – proportion of cells producing TNF and
not IFN-. IFN- TNF double positive (DP) – proportion of cells producing TNF and not IFN-.
