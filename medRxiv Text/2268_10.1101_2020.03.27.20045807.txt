Abstract

46

Background

47

As the epidemic outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), general

48

population may experience psychological distress. Evidence has suggested

49

that negative coping styles may be related to subsequent mental illness.

50

Therefore, we investigate the general population's psychological distress and

51

coping styles in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak.

52
53

Methods

54

A cross-sectional battery of surveys was conducted from February 1-4, 2020.

55

The Kessler 6 psychological distress scale, the simplified coping style

56

questionnaire and a general information questionnaire were administered

57

on-line to a convenience sample of 1599 in China. Spearman’s correlation

58

was used to measure the correlations among category variables.

59
60

Results

61

General population’s psychological distress were significant differences

62

based on age, marriage, epidemic contact characteristics, concern with media

63

reports, and perceived impacts of the epidemic outbreak (all p <0.001) except

64

gender (p=0.316). Those with a history of visiting Wuhan and a history of

65

epidemics occurring in the community, more concern with media reports,

66

perceived more severe impacts and negative coping style had a higher level

67

of psychological distress, which was significantly positively correlated with

68

a history of visiting Wuhan (r=0.548, p<0.001), a history of epidemics

69

occurring in the community (r=0.219, p<0.001), and concern with media

70

reports (r=0.192, p<0.001). Coping styles were significantly different across

71

all category variables (all p <0.001), and negatively correlated with other

72

category variables (all p<0.01) except age and marriage. Psychological

73

distress was significantly negatively correlated with the coping style

74

(r=-0.573, p<0.01).

75
76

Conclusions

77

In the early stages of COVID-19, general population with epidemic contact

78

characteristics, excessive concern with media reports, and perceived more

79

severe impacts have higher levels of psychological distress. Psychological

80

distress was significantly negatively correlated with the coping style.

81

Interventions should be implemented early, especially for those population

82

with a high level of psychological distress and/or with a negative coping

83

style.

Introduction

92

The epidemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has aroused

93

widespread concern throughout society in China. Because the virus can be

94

transmitted through droplets, contact, etc. [1], cities in many regions of

95

China have closed non-essential public places, restricted mass gathering

96

activities, and enacted other control measures to effectively control the

97

spread of the virus [2]. The epidemic has had a strong impact on general

98

population's daily life. At the same time, as the epidemic continues, general

99

population gradually experience different levels of psychological distress,

100

such as nervousness, fear of infection, anxiety, depression, sleep problems,

101

and inattention [3,4]. Previous studies have reported that some psychological

102

problems often occur during similar epidemic [5,6] or other traumatic stress

103

events, such as natural disasters [7,8], disease [9], or long-term employment

104

in high stress occupations [10-12], and may last for a long time [13,14].

105

When faced with stress or traumatic experiences, general population often

106

responds differently, with some responding positively and others responding

107

negatively. Evidence has suggested that coping styles in the face of stress

108

have an impact on the quality of general population’s life [15,16], and

109

negative coping styles may be related to psychological distress or mental

110

illness such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression

111

[7,8,12]. For this reason, we conducted this study in the early stages of this

112

epidemic to investigate the general population's psychological distress and

113

coping style related to the epidemic of COVID-19 so that those who have

114

high levels of psychological distress and/or respond negatively can be

115

detected early and undergo timely intervention.

116
117

Methods

118

This study was conducted through an online survey, starting at 16:00 on

119

February 1, 2020 and ending at 24:00 on February 4, and the survey was

120

approved by the ethical review board of the West China Hospital of Sichuan

121

University. The snowball sampling method was used to invite subjects. All

122

invitees completed the questionnaire online via Questionnaire Star

123

(https://www.wjx.cn). An initial set of invitees (10 participants) was chosen

124

to ensure broad representation of age, gender, occupation, education level,

125

and city. This set of invitees then forwarded the questionnaire to 10

126

companions whom they considered suitable for the survey, and this second

127

set forwarded the questionnaire in the same way. The study included a

128

general population aged 18 years or older who volunteered to participate in

129

the study, and respondents were excluded if they reported a history of mental

130

illness and/or could not complete the online survey independently.

133

A self-made questionnaire was used to collect demographic and

134

epidemiological information of participants, including gender, age, marriage,

135

epidemic contact and concern characteristics, and perceived epidemic

136

impacts of the epidemic of COVID-19.

137
138

Psychological distress assessment

139

The Kessler 6 psychological distress Scale (K6) was used to assess the

140

psychological distress of participants; this scale has been proven to have

141

cross-cultural reliability and validity [17]. It contains six questions that ask

142

participants to rate how often they have felt ‘nervous’, ‘hopeless’, ‘restless or

143

fidgety’, ‘so depressed that nothing could cheer you up’, ‘that everything was

144

an effort’, and ‘worthless’ during the past 30 days.

145
146

Coping style assessment

147

The Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ) was used to assess the

148

participants’ coping

149

questionnaire has been proven to have good reliability and validity in

150

Chinese [18]. The SCSQ contains twenty items, with each item using a

151

four-point score (0=never, 1=seldom, 2=often, 3=always),

152

and two subscales: positive coping (12 items) and negative coping (8 items).

153

According to the average and standard deviation of the positive coping style

154

and the negative coping style scores, a Z conversion is used to calculate their

styles

during

7

the

COVID-19

epidemic;

this

155

respective standard scores, and then, the negative coping standard scores are

156

subtracted from the positive coping style standard scores to calculate the

157

tendency value of coping style. A result greater than 0 was defined as a

158

participant adopting a positive coping style when faced with stress, and a

159

result less than 0 was defined as a participant adopting a negative coping

160

style [19].

161
162

Statistical analysis

163

Differences in psychological distress (K6 score) among categorical variables

164

were tested by t-tests or one-way analysis of variance, and differences in

165

coping styles were tested by chi-squared tests. Correlations among all

166

categorical variables were measured by Spearman’s correlation. All statistical

167

analyses were conducted in SPSS version 22.0 (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA),

168

and p <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

169
170

Quality control

171

The same IP address could be used only once to complete the questionnaire,

172

which did not collect any personal information such as names, thereby

173

ensuring anonymity and honest responses. The time spent on each

174

questionnaire was monitored automatically, and the whole questionnaires

175

completed in fewer than 120 seconds were rejected as invalid.

Comparison of the psychological distress

189

The results revealed significant differences in the participants’ psychological

190

distress based on age, marriage, epidemic contact characteristics, concern

191

with media reports related to the epidemic, and perceived impacts of the

192

epidemic (all p <0.001); there were no significant differences based on

193

gender (p =0.316). As age increases and marital status changes, K6 scores

194

have a downward trend. Those with a history of visiting Wuhan and a history

195

of epidemics occurring in the community have a higher level of

196

psychological

197

psychological distress tended to increase with concern with media reports

198

related to the epidemic and perceived impacts of the epidemic. At the same

199

time, the results also show that those with a negative coping style have a

category groups (all p <0.001) (Table 3). Compared with the positive coping

211

style, the negative coping style occurred more in those between 18 and 30

212

years old, single people, those with a history of visiting Wuhan, those with a

213

history of epidemics occurring in the community, those who reported that

Discussion

239

The results of the study suggest that the general population with a history of

240

visiting Wuhan, those with a history of epidemics occurring in their

241

community, and those who perceived more severe impacts of the epidemic of

242

COVID-19 on their living situations, emotional control, and epidemic-related

243

dreams have a higher level of psychological distress than those with none or

244

little of these experiences. These findings are consistent with the findings of

245

previous studies. The traumatic stress experience during the occurrence of

246

emergency events, such as major public events or natural disasters, is often

247

related to the general population's psychological distress and subsequent

248

mental illness [5,6,8].

249

Furthermore, the study found that there were more participants who

250

exhibited a negative coping style (34.2%), especially among younger, single,

251

those with a history of epidemic contact, and those who perceived severe

252

impacts of the epidemic of COVID-19.

253

Other studies related to traumatic stress events have reported that those in

254

the general population with traumatic stress experiences were more likely to

255

adopt a negative coping style [9]. Some studies have shown that this

256

phenomenon is related to the general population's brain functional

257

connectivity [15], while others have shown that it is related to social support

258

[20,21]. The underlying mechanism of this association has yet to be

259

elucidated, which may be the result of the combined effect of the two

260

mechanisms. Further study is needed to confirm this hypothesis. More

261

importantly, the study also found that the general population with negative

262

coping styles has higher psychological distress than those with positive

263

coping styles. Many previous studies have shown that different coping styles,

264

especially negative coping styles, for trauma stress events are usually related

265

to subsequent mental illness [7,10,22]. Therefore, this part of the general

266

population with a negative coping style should be given attention and

267

follow-up, and appropriate interventions should be given if necessary.

268

Finally, this study included concern with media reports related to the

269

epidemic of COVID-19 in the analysis. Previous studies have reported that

270

post-disaster mental health problems, such as post-traumatic stress disorder

271

(PTSD), may be related to media reports in addition to direct exposure to the

272

disaster environment [23,24]. The study found that with increasing concern

273

with media reports related to epidemic, the general population’s

274

psychological distress level has also increased accordingly; this study also

275

found that the general population's coping style was negatively related to

276

concern with media reports. This result suggested that during the epidemic of

277

COVID-19, the degree of concern with media reports affected the general

278

population's psychological distress level and coping style, which might be

279

related to that media reports could affect the general population's perceptions

280

of the disease and what preventive measures they would take [25,26]; further

281

research is needed to confirm this relation.

282

In conclusion, this study found that the epidemic of COVID-19 caused

283

different levels of psychological distress. Those with epidemic contact

284

characteristics, excessive concern with media reports, and those who

285

perceived more impacts of the epidemic reported higher levels of

286

psychological distress. The psychological distress was significantly different

287

in general population and was significantly negatively correlated with coping

288

style. Therefore, appropriate interventions should be implemented early to

289

address the impacts of such epidemics, especially for those in the general

290

population with a high level of psychological distress and/or with a negative

291

coping style.

292

Limitations

293

There are several limitations in our study. First, the survey method is based

294

on network invitation rather than face-to-face random sampling, and

295

participants need to be able to use network tools. As a result, the status of the

296

general population who cannot use network tools is unclear. Second, we did

297

not assess whether and how respondents were engaging in prevention.

298

Finally, our study design is cross-sectional and thus cannot capture changes

299

in psychological distress and its predictors over the course of the COVID-19.
