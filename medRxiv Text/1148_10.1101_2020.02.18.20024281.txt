Abstract
An outbreak of clusters of viral pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV / SARSCoV-2) happened in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019. Since the outbreak,
several groups reported estimated R0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated
valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict
prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease
dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Removed) model was applied to estimate
the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt. In the first assumption, Rt
was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase
throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rt = 1.9, 2.6 or 3.1. The number
of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258 and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In
the second assumption, Rt was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high
level of transmission (Rt = 3.1, 2.6 and 1.9) to below 1 (Rt = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly
implemented public heath intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various
levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number
of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077–84,520 or 55,869–81,393.
Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an
important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China.
Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be
continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in
other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce Rt to an ideal
level and control the infection.

Introduction
2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV / SARS-CoV-2) has given rise to an outbreak of viral
pneumonia in Wuhan, China since December 2019.1,2 World Health Organization (WHO) now
has named the disease COVID-19, short for “coronavirus disease 2019”.3 Most cases from the
initial cluster had an epidemiological link to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.4 Patients
have clinical manifestations including fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle ache, confusion,
headache, sore throat, rhinorrhoea, chest pain, diarrhoea, and nausea and vomiting.5,6 As of 17
February 2020, a cumulative total of 72,436 confirmed cases (including 11,741 currently severe
cases), 6,242 currently suspect cases, a cumulative total of 1,868 deaths and 12,552 cases
discharged from hospital were reported by National Health Commission of the People’s
Republic of China (NHC) in mainland China.7 The significant increases in the number of
confirmed cases in China and abroad led to the announcement made by WHO on 30 January
that the event has already constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.8
The reproduction number, R, measures the transmissibility of a virus, representing the
average number of new infections generated by each infected person, the initial constant of
which is called the basic reproduction number, R0,9 and the actual average number of secondary
cases per infected case at time t is called effective reproduction number, Rt.10-12 Rt shows timedependent variation with the implementation of control measures. R >1 indicates that the
outbreak is self-sustaining unless effective control measures are implemented, while R <1
indicates that the number of new cases decreases over time and, eventually, the outbreak will
stop.9 Over the past month, several groups reported estimated R0 of COVID-19 and generated

valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. In particular, Imai et al.9 provided the
first estimation, using R0 of 2.6 and based on the number of cases in China and those detected
in other countries. Other authors estimated R0 to be 3.8,13 6.47,14 2.2,15 and 2.68.16 These
predictions were very alerting and suggestions have been made for very strict public health
measures to contain the epidemics.
In response to the outbreak of COVID-19, a series of prompt public health measures have
been taken. On 1 January, the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was closed in the hope of
eliminating zoonotic source of the virus.5 On 11 January, upon isolation of the viral strain for
COVID-19 and establishment of its whole genome sequences,17 RT-PCR reagents were
developed and provided to Wuhan, which ensured the fast ascertainment of infection.15 On 21
January, Emergency Response System was activated to better provide ongoing support to the
COVID-19 response.18 Ever since the outbreak, the work of intensive surveillance,
epidemiological investigations and isolation of suspect cases gradually improved. Those having
had close contacts with infections were asked to receive medical observation and quarantine
for 14 days.19 Travel from and to Wuhan City as well as other medium-sized cities in Hubei
Province has been restricted since 23 January 2020.20
The 2019-nCoV / SARS-CoV-2 has at least 79.5% similarity in genetic sequence to SARSCoV.5,17 Riley estimated that 2.7 secondary infections were generated per case on average (R0
= 2.7) at the start of the SARS epidemic without controlling.21 After isolating the patients and
controlling the infection by the authority, the value of Rt for SARS decreased to 0.25.22 As Li
et al. mentioned, it is possible that subsequent control measures in Wuhan, and elsewhere in
mainland China, have reduced transmissibility.15 A new estimation of the epidemic dynamics

taking the unprecedentedly strict prevention and control measures in China into consideration
is required to better guide the future prevention decisions.
In this article, we intended to make phase-adjusted estimation of the epidemic trend for
the 2019-nCoV / SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission in Wuhan, China under two assumptions
of Rt (maintaining high >1 or gradually decreasing to <1). We hope to depict two types of
epidemic dynamics to provide potential evaluation standard for the effects of current prevention
and control measures, and to provide theoretical basis for future prevention decisions of the
current epidemic in China.

Results
Estimation of the epidemic trend assuming that the prevention and control measures are
insufficient in Wuhan, China
Assuming the epidemic continues to develop with R0 = 1.9, 2.6 and 3.19 from 1 December 2019,
the number of infections will continue to rise (Fig. 1). By the end of February 2020, COVID19 cases would be 11,044, 70,258 and 227,989 in Wuhan, China with R0 = 1.9, 2.6 and 3.1,
respectively. Detailed calculation process is included in the Materials and Methods part.
Estimation of the epidemic trend assuming that the prevention and control measures are
sufficient in Wuhan, China
The first phase (1 December 2019–23 January 2020): It was the early phase of the epidemic
when a few prevention and control measures were implemented. The number of infections in
Wuhan, China reached 17,656–25,875 by the end of this phase with R0 as 3.1.
The second phase (24 January 2020–2 February 2020): From 23 January 2020 on, public

transportations to and from Wuhan, as well as public transportation within Wuhan were stopped.
While gathering events inside Wuhan was banned, quarantine and isolation were gradually
established in Wuhan. The number of infections was 32,061–46,905 by the end of this phase as
Rt decreased to 2.6.
The third phase (3 February 2020–15 February 2020): New infectious disease hospitals
and mobile cabin hospitals came into service and many medical and public health teams from
other provinces and cities in China arrived in Wuhan. The quarantine and isolation at
community level were further enhanced. The number of infections would reach 53,070–77,390
if Rt could be reduced sequentially to 1.9.
The fourth phase (from 15 February 2020 on): All of the most restrict public health
measures may need a longest incubation period to take effect. If Rt could be gradually reduced
to 0.9 or 0.5 in the fourth phase, the epidemic peaks and inflection points might occur in Wuhan,
China on 23 February or 19 February. The number of infections would be 58,077–84,520 or
55,869–81,393 with Rt = 0.9 or 0.5, respectively (Figs. 2-3).
Our model predicted 2,323–3,381 deaths in Wuhan, China when we assumed Rt as 0.9 and
the percent of deaths as 4%; 2,235–3,256 deaths when we assumed Rt as 0.5 at the fourth phase.
An average of 2,279–3,318 deaths were also estimated (Table 1).
When we assumed Rt as 0.9 and the percent of deaths 10% based on calculation of case
fatality rate (CFR) at early stage of the epidemic,6 our model predicted 5,808–8,452 deaths in
Wuhan, China; 5,587–8,139 deaths when we assumed Rt as 0.5 at the fourth phase. An average
of 5,697–8,296 deaths were also estimated.

Discussion
Estimations of the transmission risk and the epidemic trend of COVID-19 are of great
importance because these can arouse the vigilance of the policy makers, health professionals
and the whole society so that enough resources would be mobilized in a speedy and efficient
way for both control and treatment. We estimated the number of infections using SEIR model
under two assumptions of Rt (Rt maintaining to be >1 or Rt gradually decreasing to <1) in the
purpose of depicting various possible epidemic trends of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Two
estimations provide an approach for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in
China, depending on whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in
February 2020. Assuming the current control measures were ineffective and insufficient, the
estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without a peak.
On the other hand, assuming the current control measures were effective and sufficient, the
estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February 2020.
According to Read’s research,13 R0 for COVID-19 outbreak is much higher compared with
other emergent coronaviruses. It might be very difficult to contain or control the spreading of
this virus. If the prevention and control measures were not sufficient or some new factors
occurred (e.g. a large proportion of cases with mild or none symptoms existed in the community;
there were more zoonotic sources), the epidemic might continue to develop at a high speed.
Therefore, we depicted first the epidemic dynamics of the relatively unsatisfying circumstance
based on the R0 estimated before the unprecedented efforts of China in the containment of the
epidemics occurred and the newest documented parameters. The curve continued to go up
throughout February without any indication of dropping, indicating the need for further

enhancement of public health measures for containment of the current outbreak.
However, as mentioned by WHO in the statement on 30 January, “it is still possible to
interrupt virus spread, provided that countries put in place strong measures to detect disease
early, isolate and treat cases, trace contacts, and promote social-distancing measures
commensurate with the risk.”8 Responding to the outbreak, China has taken a series of
unprecedentedly strict measures regardless of economic losses including daily contact with
WHO and comprehensive multi-sectoral approaches to fight against the virus and prevent
further spread, showing the sense of responsibility of China to its citizens and the whole world.
Epidemic information has been released in an open, transparent, responsible and timely manner
home and abroad. Cooperation has been established with other countries and international
organizations. These measures have won full recognition of the international community,
including WHO. Specifically in Wuhan, in the early phase from beginning of December 2019
to 23 January 2020, there was no limitation of population flow and gathering. When the humanto-human transmission was confirmed, an important decision was made to isolate Wuhan from
other parts of the country. As a result, since 24 January 2020, all public transports from and to
Wuhan, as well as public transports and people’s gathering events within Wuhan, were stopped.
Since 2 February 2020, strict public health measures were taken to prevent population flow
among distinct communities whereas since 9 February 2020, public health interventions
including quarantine of each building in the urban area and each village in the rural area were
implemented in order to block the transmission chain among the household. Therefore, strong
efforts of authorities and people in Wuhan with the support of the central government and
people from all over China, as well as the WHO and the international society, may have

gradually braked COVID-19 outbreak.
Rt is therefore assumed to decrease gradually from 3.1 to 0.5 in Wuhan, China in the
current study. The trend of the estimated cases is in accordance with the trend of currently
confirmed cases. The relatively big difference in number may be due to the possible existence
of a large number of mild and asymptomatic cases and the imperfection of current diagnostic
measures. According to NHC, before 12 February 2020, the confirmed cases were diagnosed
according to contact history, clinical manifestations, chest X-ray or computer assisted
tomography (CT) and RT-PCR for COVID-19. Since 12 February 2020, the diagnosis has been
mainly based on contact history, clinical manifestation and imaging evidence of pulmonary
lesion suggestive of pneumonia, while viral detection with RT-PCR is still being performed in
a part of patients.23 After the diagnosis method was changed, a large number of cases that were
previously missed and piled up for testing were reported in Wuhan, which greatly increased the
number of existing cases and made it approaching our estimated number. A peak of the
estimated number of infections would occur in late February under this assumption. If the peak
does occur in February, the very strong measures China has taken may have already received
success in controlling the COVID-19 infection in Wuhan.
The number of deaths in the current study was estimated based on previously reported
CFRs. Chen et al. calculated it to be 11% based on 99 cases at the very early stage of the
outbreak.6 This mortality rate might not be representative of the whole patients population due
to the relatively small sample size and scarce knowledge about the virus at early stage. More
recently, Yang et al. estimated the overall adjusted CFR among confirmed patients to be 3.06%
with a sample size of 8,866.24 The number of deaths estimated accordingly might be more close

to the reality. Our estimation of number of deaths only provides a possible range based on
currently reported CFR. The actual number of deaths might be lower with more mild and
asymptomatic cases being detected and the improvement of clinical care and treatment as the
epidemic progresses.
Hubei Province, of which Wuhan is the capital city, accounts for more than 80% of newlyconfirmed cases all over the country according to NHC daily report. The current epidemic trend
in Hubei Province is similar to that in Wuhan City. Considering the high number of confirmed
cases in the province, the currently strict measures should be continuously implemented both
in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province no matter whether the peak of number of infections
would occur or not, in order to reduce Rt to an ideal level and to control the epidemic. Owing
to the timely transportation restriction in Hubei Province and other measures, the number of
newly-confirmed cases remains relatively low and has decreased for 13 days in a row in other
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in mainland China outside Hubei Province.
However, independent self-sustaining human-to-human spread is estimated to already present
in multiple major Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. 16 In
addition, pressure on transmission control caused by the population migration after Spring
Festival holidays may occur soon, especially in some densely-populated cities.25. Necessary
strict measures should still be maintained even when the current measures turn out to be
effective.
Our study has some limitations. Firstly, the SEIR model was set up based on a number of
necessary assumptions. For example, we assumed that no super-spreaders exist in the model,
but there is currently no supportive evidence. Secondly, the accuracy of the estimation model
10

depends largely on the accuracy of the parameters it used such as incubation period. With more
precise parameters obtained as the epidemic progresses, our estimation model will also be more
precise. Our estimates of the reproductive number from 3.1 to 0.5 are based on previous studies
and experience from SARS control. However, this measure may change substantially over the
course of this epidemic and as additional data arrives. Besides, using a fixed Rt value in each
phase may incur potential bias because Rt is essentially a dynamic parameter. Thirdly, these
estimated data may not be sustained if unforeseeable factors occurred. For example, if some
infections were caused by multiple exposures to animals, these estimates will be exposed to a
big uncertainty. Fourthly, the epidemic trend shows great difference between Wuhan and Hubei
Province and regions in mainland China outside Hubei Province according to the NHC reported
data. It is thus inappropriate to generalize the estimations in Wuhan to regions in mainland
China outside Hubei Province. The dynamics model for the other locations in mainland China
remains to be developed and specific parameters need to be redefined. Lastly, we do not provide
model fit information in the current study. SEIR model is a prediction model forecasting the
number of infections in the future. The data corresponding to actual situation in the future
cannot be determined and this makes model fitting almost impossible during the outbreak. We
would carry out model fitting according to the real data in pace with more information and
knowledge about the characteristics of COVID-19 and the epidemics in the future.
Despite the limitations mentioned above, the current study is the first to provide estimation
for epidemic trend after strict prevention and control measures were implemented in China.
Whether current prevention and control measures are sufficient or not may be evaluated through
the occurrence of the infection number peak in February. Rigorous measures should still be

maintained even when the current measures turn out to be effective by the end of February to
prevent further spread of the virus.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Model
We employed an infectious disease dynamics model (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and
Removed model; SEIR model) for the purpose of modeling and predicting the number of
COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China. The model is a classic epidemic method to analyze the
infectious disease which has a definite latent period, and has proved to be predictive for a
variety of acute infectious diseases in the past such as Ebola and SARS.22,26-31 Application of
the mathematical model is of great guiding significance to assess the impact of isolation of
symptomatic cases as well as observation of asymptomatic contact cases and to promote
evidence-based decisions and policy.
We assumed no new transmissions from animals, no differences in individual immunity,
the time-scale of the epidemic is much faster than characteristic times for demographic
processes (natural birth and death), and no differences in natural births and deaths. In this model,
individuals are classified into four types: susceptible (S; at risk of contracting the disease),
exposed (E; infected but not yet infectious), infectious (I; capable of transmitting the disease),
and removed (R; those who recover or die from the disease). The total population size (N) is
given by N = S+E+I+R. It is assumed that susceptible individuals who have been infected first
enter a latent (exposed) stage, during which they may have a low level of infectivity. The
differential equations of the SEIR model are given as:32,33

dS / dt = - β S I / N
dE / dt = β S I / N – σ E
dI / dt = σ E – γ I

where β is the transmission rate; σ is the infection rate calculated by the inverse of the
mean latent period; γ is the recovery rate calculated by the inverse of infectious period.
R software (Version 3.6.2) was applied for all the calculations and estimates in the current
study.
Data collection and parameter values
Estimation of the epidemic trend assuming the prevention and control measures are
insufficient
We first estimated the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China assuming the current prevention and
control measures are insufficient. In this process, S was assumed to be the population of Wuhan
City (11 million).15,34 The initial assumed number of cases caused by zoonotic exposure was 40
(I) according to Imai et al.’s estimation.9 We proposed E at 20 times of I in accordance with
Read et al.13 R was set as 0. σ was set as 1/5.2 according to the latest article by Li et at.15, which
calculated the mean incubation period of COVID-19 to be 5.2 days. Chen et al.6 calculated the
average hospitalization period of 31 discharged patients to be 12.39 ± 4.77 days. Yang et al.
calculated the median time from disease onset to diagnosis among confirmed patients to be 5.24
γ was accordingly set as 1/18 (ceiling of 12.39 + 5 is 18). R0 was chosen based on Imai et al.’s9
estimation 2.6 (1.9–3.1) assuming 4,000 (1,000–9,700) infections as of 18 January.

Estimation of the epidemic trend assuming the prevention and control measures are
sufficient
This section discussed the scenario where the current prevention and control measures are
sufficient. The set of S, E, I, R, σ and γ is the same as the first section except that we also
explored the model with E at 30 times of I to provide a possible range of number of infections.
Absence of fever in COVID-19 cases is more frequent than in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
infection.35 Such patients may be missed since the current surveillance case definition focused
mainly on fever detection. Accordingly, the possibility of E at 30 times of I can’t be excluded.
R0 in this section was chosen by phases. The first phase ranges from 1 December 2019 to
23 January 2020 and can be regarded as the early phase of the epidemic when a few prevention
and control measures were implemented. R0 was set as 3.1 consistent with Imai et al.’s
estimation of high transmission level.9 On 23 January 2020, airplanes, trains and other public
transportation within the city were restricted and other prevention and control measures such
as quarantine and isolation were gradually established in Wuhan.20 So the second phase began
on 24 January and Rt was set as 2.6 consistent with Imai et al.’s estimation of moderate
transmission level.9 2 February was the last day of the extended Spring Festival holiday and
Chinese authorities mobilized more medical resources to support Wuhan ever since.36 The
newly constructed hospital “Huoshenshan” come into service on this day37 and “Leishenshan”，
mobile cabin hospitals several days later.38 And also, more and more medical teams arrived in
Wuhan. So the third phase began on 3 February and Rt was set as 1.9 consistent with Imai et
al.’s estimation of low transmission level.9 All of these measures may need one longest
incubation period to take effect. So the last phase began on 16 February and Rt was set as 0.9
