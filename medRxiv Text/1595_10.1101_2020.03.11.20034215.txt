Abstract
Background

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) initially appeared

and has most rapidly spread in Wuhan, China. The case fatality rate is the most direct
indicator to assess the hazards of an infectious disease. We aimed to estimate the instant
fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and its affiliated Hubei Province.
Methods

We collected the daily case notification data of COVID-19 from Dec 8, 2019

to Mar 10, 2020 in Wuhan City and Hubei Province officially announced by the Chinese
authority. The numbers of daily confirmed/deaths/cured cases and the numbers of daily
cumulative confirmed/deaths/cured cases were obtained. The death time and cure time of
COVID-19 patients were calculated based on the dates of diagnosis, death and discharge
of individual cases. Then the estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were
obtained on the basis of the median death or medium cure time, respectively. Finally, the
instant fatality rate of COVID-19 was calculated according to the numbers of deaths and
cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis dates.
Results

From Jan 1, 2020 to Feb 22, 2020 in Wuhan City, the instant case fatality rate

of COVID-19 was 3.4%～19.5% and the instant cured rate was 80.0%～96.6%. The
average fatality rate reached 11.4% while the average cure rate was 88.6%. During the
same period in Hubei Province, the instant case fatality rate was 3.8%～16.6% and the
instant cured rate was 83.4%～96.6%. The average fatality rate and the average cure rate
were 9.2% and 91.8%, respectively.
Conclusions

The fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and Hubei

Province were underestimated. Wuhan showed higher fatality rate and cure rate than the
whole Hubei Province did.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19)1 initially appeared in Wuhan, China is
caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). WHO
announced that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak is a Public Health Emergency of
International Concern (PHEIC)2-4. As of Mar. 10, 2020, the number of confirmed COVID19 cases in China has reached to 80955, of which 3162 were dead, and 61567 were cured.
Wuhan City and its affiliated Hubei Province are most affected and account for at least
90% of the cases. At present the outbreak in China has been basically controlled. However,
the cases of COVID-19 have rapidly increased in other 109 countries around the world,
such as South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan, Singapore, United States and so on. As of Mar 10,
2020, the total number of patients has risen sharply to 32778 outside China, and 876
patients has died.5 The global outbreak is getting worse.
Assessing the hazards of infectious diseases is a vital important concern in
epidemiology.6 The case fatality rate, standing for the percentage of deaths from a disease
in the total number of infected-patients during the whole outbreak, is the direct one to
reflect the severity of the disease. The accurate case fatality rate of an infectious disease
could be obtained after the outbreak is over, on the basis of the numbers of confirmed
cases and deaths. Given the severity of COVID-19 outbreak situation throughout the
world, it is important to estimate and predict the fatality rate of COVID-19 in the early
stage for the hazard evaluation, which might provide the basis for the setting of public
security strategy, the allocation of health resources and the adjustment of medical
treatment work. It might be also of great help to the government's decision-making and
the public's understanding.
However, the mortality of COVID-19 published recently in some articles and the
“fatality rate” announced by authority is neither mortality nor fatality rate.7, 8 Since the

numbers of confirmed cases and deaths are constantly changing, it is impossible to get an
accurate case fatality rate until the COVID-19 outbreak is over.
We considered that the case fatality rate is a collection from successive instant case
fatality rates throughout the disease outbreak. In the present study, we established a
method to estimate the instant fatality rate of COVID-19 even the outbreak is still on. We
collected the daily case notification data of COVID-19 announced by the Chinese official.
The death time and cure time of COVID-19 patients were obtained from individual cases.
The estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were then calculated. Finally, the
instant fatality rate of COVID-19 was estimated according to the numbers of deaths and
cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis dates.

Methods
Research design
The death time and cure time of COVID-19 patients were calculated based on the dates of

diagnosis, death and discharge of individual cases. Then, the estimated diagnosis dates of
deaths and the estimated diagnosis dates of cure cases of COVID-19 were respectively
calculated on the basis of the median death time or median cure time. Finally, the instant
case fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 were obtained based on the numbers of deaths
and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis dates.

Data collection
We collected the daily case notification data of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and its affiliated
Hubei Province from Dec 8, 2019 to Feb 29, 2020.9 The data included the numbers of

single day, and then checked and corrected the data each other.
Data analysis
We collected 134 deaths and 536 cured cases. Basing on the dates of diagnosis, death and
discharge of individual cases, the death time of COVID-19 patients was the period from
diagnosis dates to death dates of the deaths, while the cure time of COVID-19 patients
was the period from diagnosis dates to discharge dates of cured cases (figure 1).

Figure 1 The relationship between death or cure times and dates of diagnosis, death and
discharge.

Death time = death date - diagnosis date
Cure time = discharge date - diagnosis date
Depending on the above death time and cure time, the diagnosis dates of deaths or cured
cases of COVID-19 on daily case notification data were estimated. The estimated
diagnosis date (EDD) of deaths is obtained from the date reported on daily case
notification data (DCND) of deaths minus mean death time (DT). The estimated
diagnostic date (EDD) of cure cases is obtained from the date reported on daily case
notification data of cure cases minus mean cure time (CT) (figure 2).

The daily fatality rate (FR) is calculated from the number of cumulative deaths (NCD)
divided by a sum of the number of cumulative deaths and the number of cumulative
cured cases (NCCC) on the same estimated diagnosis date.
FR = NCD / (NCD + NCCC)×100%
The daily cure rate (CR) is calculated from the number of NCCC divided by a sum of the
number of NCD and NCCC on the same estimated diagnosis date.
CR = NCCC / (NCD + NCCC) ×100%

cured on Jan10, 2020. The number of daily new cured patients began to increase in midJanuary, obviously increased in early and mid-February, still maintained a high level in
late February, 2020, and then decreased in the early March. The numbers of daily new
confirmed cases, daily new deaths and daily new cured cases in Wuhan City were higher
than those in Hubei Province. The characteristics in Hubei Province and Wuhan City were
similar.

Death time and cure time
After treatment, the COVID-19 patients would end up dead or cured. The time from
diagnosis to death is called death time. The time from diagnosis to discharge is cure time.
We collected the detailed dates of COVID-19 cases reported on the websites of the
National Health Commissions of China and Provincial Health Commissions of China. The
death time was calculated on the basis of the diagnosis dates and death dates of 134 dead
patients. The mean death time of COVID-19 was 9.2±6.7 days, the median death time was
8 days, and the quartile spacing was 9.2 days. According to the diagnosis dates, and
discharge dates of 536 cured cases with COVID-19, the cure time from diagnosis dates to
discharge dates was calculated. The cure time curve of the patients displayed a left skewed
distribution with a skewness of 0.85. The mean cure time was 13.6±5.6 days, the median
cure time of was 12 days, and a 95% confidence interval was from 7.4 to 21.7 (figure 5).
Based on the proportion of cumulative confirmed cases who were cured, we estimated
that the median cure time of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei was 16 days.

Estimation of diagnosis dates of the deaths and cured cases
The confirmed patients would eventually have two endpoints: death or cure. We assumed
that the dead patients died on the 8th days, the median death time, after diagnosis. The
diagnosis date of the dead patient should be 8 days prior to that date. That is, the estimated
diagnosis date (Dd) of the deaths is the date 8 days before the announced death date (Di).
Dd = D (i-8).
Similarly, we assumed that cured patients are discharged on the 16th days, median cure
time, after diagnosis. The estimated diagnosis date of the cure cases is the date 16 days
before the announced cure date [D (i -16)].
Dd = D (i-16)
We calculated the diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases basing on the median death
or cure times, respectively. Figure 6 shows the curves of the numbers of cumulative deaths
and the number of cumulative cured cases of COVID-19 on the estimated diagnosis dates.
The number of confirmed cases was equal to the sum of the number of cumulative cured
cases and the number of cumulative death toll on the same estimated diagnosis date. Since
the numbers of COVID-19 death toll on the same day was significantly less than the
numbers of cured cases, the curve of estimated confirmed COVID-19 cases which was

Instant fatality rates
The instant fatality rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City was less than 10% (3.4-9.9%) from
Jan 1 to Jan 13, 2020, and gradually increased to 14.2%-19.5% in mid to late January. In
February, the instant case fatality rate gradually decreased and stabilized at 6.5% (figure
7A). The average case fatality rate was 11.4%. The instant case fatality rate of COVID19 in Hubei Province showed the same trend of that in Wuhan City, but the case fatality
rates were lower than that in Wuhan City. The instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 in
Hubei Province was 10% (3.8-9.1%) from Jan 1 to Jan 13, 2020, then increased to 10.0%16.6% in late January, and decreased to 5.6% on February 22, 2020 (figure 7B). The

Figure 7. The instant fatality rates and cure rates (B) of COVID-19 in Wuhan City (A) and Hubei
Province (B).

Instant cure rates
The cure rate and case fatality rate are opposite since cure and death are a pair of
competing events. The instant cure rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City was between 80.0%96.6%, while the rate in Hubei Province was between 83.4%-96.6%. The instant cure rate
was lower in second half of January than that in other time. Then the rate gradually
increased. On February 22, the instant cure rate increased to 93.5 % in Wuhan, and 94.4%
in Hubei (figure 7). The cure rate was likely to continue to increase little by little after
February 22, 2020.

Discussion
The accurate case fatality rate of an infectious disease can be obtained after the outbreak
is over. At present, the outbreak of COVID-19 is ongoing throughout China and

worldwide. The numbers of confirmed cases, deaths and cured cases are constantly
changing.10 Therefore, estimating the case fatality rate is obviously challenging. However,
it is critical to balance the socioeconomic burden of infection control interventions against
their potential benefit for mankind.8 The current literatures and the official published case
fatality rates have a large deviation. Huang CL et al reported clinical features of 41
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China. As of Jan 22, 2020, 28 of 41
patients had been discharged and 6 patients (the mortality 15%) died.11 Wang D et al
reported clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirusinfected pneumonia in Wuhan, China.12 47 patients were discharged and 6 died (4.3%).
The remaining 85 patients were still hospitalized. The mortality was reported as 4.3%.
Zhang YP extracted a total of 72314 cases with COVID-19 reported China’ Infectious
Disease information System through Feb.11, 2020.13 Thereof a total of 1023 deaths
occurred among 44672 confirmed cases for an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3%. However,
he ignored a fact that there were 4740 discharged cases and 38909 hospitalized cases in
confirmed cases. At present, in official websites the case fatality rates were calculated by
dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases. These data are
neither case fatality rate, nor mortality, and might be off by orders of magnitude.8 The
confirmed cases included deaths, cured, and hospitalized patients. Some of the
hospitalized patients may end up dead in future and their data would not participate in the
calculation of the case fatality. In addition, diagnosis of viral infection will precede death
or recovery by days to weeks. The number of deaths should be compared to the past
confirmed case numbers – accounting for this delay increasing the estimate of the case
fatality rate.
We assumed that the case fatality rate of the whole outbreak process could be
regarded as a collection of many successive instant case fatality rates. The instant case

fatality rate is directly related to various factors at the time, and it is easier to analyze
various factors and take possible actions to influence the disease progress by knowing this
fatality rate in advance. This instant case fatality rate will gradually approach the case
fatality rate as time goes on till the outbreak ends gradually. The extreme instant fatality
rate can be used as an approximate value of case fatality rate within certain period of time.
This approach provides a way to accurately calculate the fatality rate, which is not affected
by hospitalized patients.
We set the instant unit of case fatality rate as a day, and calculated the daily case
fatality rate. The daily case fatality rate was equal to the daily cumulative number of deaths
divided by the number of deaths plus the number of cured patients. The number of daily
confirmed cases is equal to the number of deaths plus the number of cured cases. The
confirmed COVID-19 patients had to go through a certain period of time, which is the
death time or the cure time, and then result in the final outcomes: death or cure. The date
of deaths minus death time is the diagnosis date of deaths. Similarly, the cure date minus
the cure time is the diagnosis date of cured patients. The daily case fatality rate and cure
rates were then calculated using the cumulative number of deaths and cured cases at the
same diagnosis date. This rate varies from day to day with disease-related factors.
The outbreak of COVID-19 firstly appeared in Wuhan, where the situation was most
serious with the highest case fatality rate of China. The case fatality rate varied over time.
In the first half of January, the fatality rate was less than 10% because the outbreak was
not very serious and prevalent. It was easy for patients to see a doctor. But till the
beginning of February, the number of patients largely increased and it was difficult for
patients to receive medical care treatment. The admission and diagnosis of COVID-19
were delayed, the hospitals were crowded out, and medical condition was deteriorated. As
a result, the case fatality rate rose sharply to 20%. In February, a large number of domestic

medical resources supported Wuhan, and the medical conditions gradually improved. The
treatment concept and methods were updated, the medical level was improved, and the
treatment procedure became more and more standardized. On the other hand, the virulence
of SARS-CoV-2 may decline as the virus passes through the generations. The proportion
of severe cases decreased, and the fatality rate decreased to nearly 6.5%. Basing on this
trend, we speculate that the case fatality rate would further decline.
The trend in Hubei Province was similar to that in Wuhan, but the case fatality rate
was low. The case fatality rate in the first half of January 2020 was less than 10%. From
the second half of January to the beginning of February, it rose to 10% ~16.6%, and then
decreased to 5.6% on February 22. The fatality rate was expected to fall down further.
This study has some limitations. The major influencing factors were mean cure time
and death time. The death time was calculated based on the 134 death cases, and the cure
time was based on 536 discharged cases. They may deviate from reality and affect the
results. We suggest that the government discloses cases of infectious diseases for
scientific study to share the resources. Accurate cure time and death time was obtained, it
may help to accurately calculate the case fatality rate, and to provide a basis for prevention
and control of infectious disease.
