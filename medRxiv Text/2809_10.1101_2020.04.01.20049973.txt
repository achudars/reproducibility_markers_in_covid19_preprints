Abstract
Background
The novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV) outbreak has been a serious concern around the globe.
Since people are in tremor due to the massive spread of Coronavirus in the major parts of the
world, it requires to predict the risk of this infectious disease. In this situation, we develop a
model to measure the risk of infectious disease and predict the risk of 2019-nCOV
transmission by using data of four countries—US, Australia, Canada and China.
Methods
The model underlies that higher the population density, higher the risk of transmission of
infectious disease from human to human. Besides, population size, case identification rate
and travel of infected passengers in different regions are also incorporated in this model.
Results
According to the calculated risk index, our study identifies New York State in United States
(US) to be the most vulnerable area affected by the novel Coronavirus. Besides, other areas
(province/state/territory) such as Hubei (China, 2nd), Massachusetts (US, 3rd), District of
Columbia (US, 4th), New Jersey (US, 5th), Quebec (Canada, 20th), Australian Capital
Territory (Australia, 29th) are also found as the most risky areas in US, China, Australia and
Canada.
Conclusion
The study suggests avoiding any kind of mass gathering, maintaining recommended physical
distances and restricting inbound and outbound flights of highly risk prone areas for tackling
2019-nCOV transmission.
1. Introduction
Novel Coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) related to
Coronavirus that caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic 10 years ago,
was first detected in Saudi Arabia and it has been spreading in other countries since 2012[1].
In December 2019, China noticed few pneumonia cases relating to novel Coronavirus (2019nCOV). Told case incidence has been increasing dramatically and reached the hundreds, but
it is likely to be an under-estimate[2]. The Coronavirus menace has now been spread all over
the countries in globe. As of March 24, 2020, there were 372757 confirmed Novel
Coronavirus-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) cases in 196 countries of which 16224 death
cases were traced out worldwide[3]. This endemic of novel Coronavirus has been caused due
to the mobility and interaction of people who moved from one country to another by

outbound fights. Therefore, we argue that densely populated countries as well as cities are
more likely to be infected with novel Coronavirus because of inbound and outbound flights
and other means of transports. It implies that both in-bound and out-bound flights of
passengers are significant factors in triggering Coronavirus infection risk in more densely
populated countries than in less densely populated countries. However, previous studies did
not consider the population density factor while modeling the risk of 2019-nCOV
transmission. Recent studies estimates the risk of Coronavirus transmission from the Chinese
cities to other destinations[4,5]. More importantly, Haider et al. (2020) built a risk index
using the number of air travelers multiplied by the weight of the number of infected cases.
Apart from previous studies, our study can fill the research gap constructing a risk index that
takes population density and size, case identification rate, and the number of air travel into
account.
2 Methods
2.1 Risk Index
We present a mathematical model that assesses the risk of infectious diseases such as
Coronavirus. The model includes population size and density, the number of identified cases,
case identification rate, and passengers’ travel among different regions. Risk Index (RI) of a
certain infectious disease in a specific area aij of a country Ci where i = 1,2,3,..., n and
 1,2,3, … , ௜

is estimated for a given Calculation Period (CP) which is usually days,
weeks, months or even years. RI is unit free which makes it comparable among areas; higher
the RI, the greater the risk. Therefore, RI of an area aij is defined as

RI ij = Aij + Tij

(1)

where, Aij and Tij are the area and the travel specific risk components respectively.
2.1.1 Area specific risk
Area specific component estimates the risk of infectious diseases posed by the factors such as
the number of identified cases, population size, and case identification rate. We also consider
mobility—interaction factor to estimate the risk of spreading infectious diseases as mobility
and interaction among people contribute to spread infectious diseases according to some
studies [6–8]. So, it is expected that the higher the mobility and interaction among people in
an area, the higher the risk of spreading infectious diseases. We can call it “MobilityInteraction Effect”. The reasoning behind such hypothesis is that people have the tendency to
amass in an area which provides better environment, livelihood, education, and other
amenities. The aggregation process continues further with the economic development, forcing
people to move low density areas to high density areas. As a result, people living in high
density areas have higher mobility and interaction among themselves than the people living
in low density areas[9]. Therefore, we propose that Relative Mobility-Interaction Effect
(RMIE) can be estimated by the relative population density of that area within a country.
For an area aij , having the population density Dij in country Ci , RMIE is measured as

Now using RMIE along with the number of identified cases, case identification rate,
calculation period of risk measurement, and assuming that infectious disease spread at
geometric rate, we write the area specific risk component as

A ij =

(3).

Here, within the risk calculation period (CP),
Pi = Population of country i

Pij = Population of area/city aij of country i
I i = The total identified case of infectious disease in country i

I ij = The total identified cases of infectious disease in aij
t s = Starting time of CP
t e = Ending time of CP

t ij = Time when first case was identified in area/city aij
t i = Time when first case was identified in country i

t g = Time when first case was identified globally
Δ t g = t e − t g the duration of global identification
Δ t i = t e − t i the duration of first case identification in country i

Δ t ij = t e − t ij the duration of first case identification in area aij .
It accumulates two risk components: one is the area/city risk and the other is the country risk.
An important feature of the measure (3) is that if an area has no identified case, we can assess
area specific risk by country specific risk since through mobility-interaction effect of other
areas create pressure of spreading disease to that particular area.
2.1.2 Travel specific risk
Drawing experience from previous outbreak of infectious diseases including the recent
epidemic of Coronavirus, literatures suggest addressing the risk of travelling among different
areas and countries[10–12]. In our study, the travel specific risk component for area aij of
country Ci is measure as

Tij =

the same time duration, and A pq is the area specific component for a pq as described in
equation 3. The travel risk component incorporates contribution of other area specific risks
proportionately to the proportion of travelers from those areas. Combining equation (3) and
(4), we get the final RI as follows:

RI ij =

Some interesting features of this index are worthwhile to mention. The index says that there
is a risk of Coronavirus spreading even though the travel specific risk component becomes
zero. That means even if a country imposes air travel restriction internationally, the risk of
transmission still exists. The area specific component of the index actually portrays the
dynamics of infectious disease spreading influenced by mobility and interaction among
people. One of the important implications of the area specific component is that restricting
international movement is not sufficient to contain the risk of Coronavirus spreading in
particular and infectious diseases in general. Internal restriction is also important to suppress
transmission risk in an area which is exactly what the current situation says. In that sense, we
expect that our index has the higher probability of mimicking the current situation of
Coronavirus.
2.2 Data sources
Data on Coronavirus identified cases, population size and density, and air travel among areas
of the four countries – US, Canada, Australia and China are collected from three different
sources. First, the total number of confirmed cases (up to 26 March 2020) and the dates of
first identification of Coronavirus cases in geographic areas (territory/province/state) are
extracted from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU
CCSE) (https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/)[13,14]. Second, data on
population
size
and
geometric
area are
collected
from
the
website
https://www.citypopulation.de. Finally, because of insufficient passengers’ travel data, we
incorporate air travel data only among these areas. Air travel data are obtained from FLIRT
(https://flirt.eha.io), a flight network analysis tool developed by EcoHealth Alliance which
provides simulated passengers’ data for the final destination from different airports based on
flight schedule database of 800 airlines[12,15].
2.3 Data analysis
We have defined the calculation period (CP) from 31st December 2019 to 27th March
2020.The total number of confirmed Coronavirus cases are accumulated up to 26th March
2020 for different areas of respective countries. Population density (population per square
kilometer) of these areas is calculated by dividing population size by the respective geometric
area. At first, we calculate area specific component using equation 3. To estimate travel
specific risk component presented in equation 4, we calculate the proportion of travelers
arrived at area aij from other areas directly by using simulated data from FLIRT. In total 781

Figure 1: Risk Index of Coronavirus infection (as of 26th March 2020)
Empirical findings depict that New York State in US is the most risky area in terms of
Coronavirus infection among US, Canada, Australia, and China. As per report of 26 March
2020, about 38262 Coronavirus cases are detected in this state, and the value of RI is
0.00691484 which clearly shows the severity of infection comparing to others. Besides, some
other areas such as Hubei (China), Massachusetts (US), District of Columbia (US), New
Jersey (US) , Georgia (US), Colorado (US), Illinois (US), Michigan (US) and Maryland (US)
are ranked 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th respectively as per calculation of RI.
Besides, Quebec is ranked 20th whereas Alberta is ranked 57th among Provinces in Canada.
Moreover, Australian Capital Territory, Australia is ranked 29th followed by New South
Wales in 49th position. More interestingly, remaining Chinese Provinces are ranked at the
bottom of the table, implying less risk of Coronavirus infection in China comparing to US,
Canada and Australia.
4. Discussion
China (Hubei Province) as a breeding ground was the highest in the importation to
Coronavirus infection across the globe. Later, this pandemic rapidity of this disease has now
captured US and some other parts of the world. It has been spread at a geometric rate due to
the mobility and interaction of people through air-borne movement from one country to
another or from one city to another. In this respect, our study models a risk index to measure
the human to human Coronavirus transmission mainly caused by people's mobility and
interaction. Therefore, we recommend avoiding any mass gathering, maintaining
recommended physical distance and restricting inbound and outbound flights across different
areas/cities and countries as well.
