Abstract
Background With the spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan, Hubei Province to other areas of the
country, medical staff in Fever Clinics faced the challenge of identifying suspected cases among
febrile patients with acute respiratory infections. We aimed to describe the prevalence and clinical
features of COVID-19 as compared to pneumonias of other etiologies in a Fever Clinic in Beijing.
Methods In this single-center, retrospective study, 342 cases of pneumonia were diagnosed in
Fever Clinic in Peking University Third Hospital between January 21 to February 15, 2020. From
these patients, 88 were reviewed by panel discussion as possible or probable cases of COVID-19,
and received 2019-nCoV detection by RT-PCR. COVID-19 was confirmed by positive
2019-nCoV in 19 cases, and by epidemiological, clinical and CT features in 2 cases (the
COVID-19 Group, n=21), while the remaining 67 cases served as the non-COVID-19 group.
Demographic and epidemiological data, symptoms, laboratory and lung CT findings were
collected, and compared between the two groups.
Findings The prevalence of COVID-19 in all pneumonia patients during the study period was
6.14% (21/342). Compared with the non-COVID-19 group, more patients with COVID-19 had an

identified epidemiological history (90.5% versus 32.8%, P 0.001). The COVID-19 group had

lower WBC [5.19×109/L (±1.47) versus 7.21×109/L (±2.94), P 0.001] and neutrophil counts

＜0.001] in peripheral blood. However, the

[3.39×109/L (±1.48) versus 5.38×109/L (±2.85), P

count of lymphocytes was not different. On lung CT scans, involvement of 4 or more lobes was
more common in the COVID-19 group (45% versus 16.4%, P=0.008).
Interpretation In the period of COVID-19 epidemic outside Hubei Province, the prevalence of
COVID-19 in patients with pneumonia visiting our Fever Clinic in Beijing was 6.14%.
Epidemiological evidence was important for prompt case finding, and lower blood WBC and
neutrophil counts may be useful for differentiation from pneumonia of other etiologies.

Introduction
The first cluster of cases of pneumonia with unknown origin emerged in the city of Wuhan,
Hubei Province, China, in early December, 2019 1,2. A novel coronavirus had been isolated from
these patients, and subsequently named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) on January 12,
2020 3, and later as SARS-CoV-2. The initially confirmed cases were localized in Wuhan and
mostly associated with Huanan Seafood Wholesale market in the city 2, but soon the disease
spread rapidly to other areas of the country. On January 19, 2020, two cases in Beijing and one
case in Guangdong Province were reported 4, and subsequently more cases were reported
elsewhere 5-8.
Since the outbreak in Wuhan, as a quick response, Fever Clinics were requested to reinforce
case finding of pneumonia of unknown etiologies. Fever Clinics, mostly affiliated to the Division
of Infectious Diseases in general hospitals, had been established after SARS outbreak in 2003, and
since then served as the first line to monitor and manage acute febrile respiratory infections,
mostly seasonal influenza in recent years. For 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), this
time, patients with body temperatures≥37.2oC were asked to firstly visit Fever Clinics, where a
triage strategy was implemented 9, and probable or possible cases were identified by experts or
expert panels, and samples were sent for quick viral detection. On Jan. 21, 2020, the first case of
COVID-19 was identified in our Fever Clinic, and up to Feb. 15, 21 cases were diagnosed, with
19 cases confirmed by positive 2019-nCoV results, among 88 patients with pneumonia sent for
viral detection. As far as we know, the prevalence of COVID-19 in patients with pneumonia
visiting Fever Clinics has not been reported, and there is lack of data comparing the clinical
features between COVID-19 and pneumonia of other etiologies.
Therefore, we collected and reviewed the medical records of patients who visited the Fever
Clinic in our hospital. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 in pneumonias during
this period and to find the unique features of COVID-19 as compared to pneumonias caused by
other agents. We believe that the results of our study will add to the knowledge of COVID-19 for
practice in Fever Clinics facing newly emerging respiratory infections.
Methods
Study design and patient selection
We conducted a retrospective, single-centered study and recruited patients visiting the Fever
Clinic at Peking University Third Hospital from January 21 to February 15, 2020. Based on
epidemiological history, clinical and radiological manifestations, cases with possible or probably
COVID-19 were sent for panel discussion and then for 2019-nCoV detection by RT-PCR.
Pediatric patients were not included in our study. The study protocol was approved by the ethics
committee of Peking University Third Hospital and the data were analyzed anonymously.
Diagnostic criteria of COVID-19
The diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 were according to Guidelines for the Diagnosis and
Treatment of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection by the National Health Commission 10,
which can be accessed in the network http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/zhengcwj/list_gzbd.shtml.
Laboratory testing of 2019-nCoV in throat swabs was performed by both Beijing Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Haidian District CDC.
Severity of COVID-19 was evaluated by the following criteria: 1) Mild-moderate: fever
and/or respiratory symptoms with pneumonia in radiology examination, without signs of severe or

very severe diseases; 2) Severe: presence of one of the following: respiratory rate ≥30 beat/min;
SpO2 ≤93% at rest; PaO2/FiO2 ≤300mmHg; 3) Very severe: presence of one of the following:
severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation; shock; complicated with other organ
failure and requiring ICU admission.
Data collection
Demographic and epidemiological data were collected. Epidemiological data included: if a
patient came from Wuhan City or Hubei Province in 2 weeks; if a patient ever had contact
face-to-face with individuals from Wuhan or Hubei in 2 weeks; if a patient, in 2 weeks, ever had
contact face-to-face with individuals who had confirmed COVID-19; if the onset of pneumonia
occurred in family members in a short period. Clinical indices and symptoms on presentation were
also recorded. Data from laboratory examinations including blood routines, and CT findings were
collected. CT features were reviewed by experts of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and
Radiology.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as the mean (standard deviation) or median (25th and
75th percentiles). Categorical variables were expressed as numbers (%). To compare the
differences between groups for Continuous variables, t-test was used. To compare the differences
between groups for categorical variables, chi-square or Fisher exact test was used. Results were
considered statistically significant at P value

＜0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using

SPSS software, version 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).
Results
From January 21 to February 15, 2020, based on epidemiological evidence, fever and/or
respiratory symptoms, chest radiological findings and blood white blood cell (WBC) results,
physicians at the Fever Clinic referred 156 cases to panel discussion by multi-discipline experts.
After discussion, 110 were considered to be possible or probable cases of COVID-19, and
received 2019-nCoV real-time PCR testing, which was positive in 19 cases (confirmed cases). In
another 2 patients, though PCR testing was negative, a clinical diagnosis was made according to
epidemiological evidence, consistent clinical and CT findings (clinical cases). These 21 cases
were grouped as COVID-19 for this analysis. For the remaining cases with negative viral
detection, the diagnosis of COVID-19 was excluded based on inconsistent epidemiological,
clinical or radiological data. Among these, 22 were excluded from the analysis because of lack of
CT scan or no signs of pneumonia on CT scan, and finally 67 patients with pneumonia of other
etiologies were included for analysis as the non-COVID-19 group (see patient selection flowchart
in Figure 1).
In the study period, 2123 patients visited the Fever Clinic because of fever and/or respiratory
symptoms, and 342 patients were diagnosed to have pneumonia based on CT scan or in a few
cases on Chest X-ray. The prevalence of COVID-19 in all these pneumonia patients was 6.14%
(21/342). The prevalence of COVID-19 in cases with CT-confirmed pneumonia sent for
2019-nCoV testing was 23.9% (21/88).
The demographics and baseline characteristics of the 21 patients with COVID-19 were
shown in Table 1. The median age was 42.0 years (25th-75th percentile, 34.5-66.0 years). Men
and women were equally affected. Nineteen patients (90.5%) had a clear epidemiological history

of COVID-19. Seven patients, from 5 family clusters, had close contact with their family members.
In the two patients with unclear epidemiological link, one was a social worker contacting a
high-flow of people and his wife was confirmed to have COVID-19 by positive 2019-nCoV test
about one week later. The other one had no epidemiological history on presentation, but another
patient, who had had dinner with him, was also diagnosed to have COVID-19 later. An incubation
period was elicited from 12 patients (57.1%), ranging from 2 to 10 days with a median of 6.5 days.
Most of the patients were mild-moderate in disease severity (mild-moderate cases, n=18, 85.7%).
Three patients were classified as severe cases with SpO2 ≤93% on presentation, while no very
severe cases were identified in our series.
On presentation, most patients (85.7%) had fever with a mean body temperature of 37.8oC.
Cough (42.9%), expectoration (33.3%), fatigue (57.1%), headache or dizziness (38.1%) were
common symptoms. Other symptoms included shortness of breath, myalgia or arthralgia, sore
throat, nasal symptoms and diarrhea (Table 2). Compared with non-COVID-19 patients, a higher
proportion of COVID-19 patients had an identified epidemiological history (90.5% versus 32.8%).
Clinical symptoms were similar between cases of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19, except for
cough (Table 2).
Blood routine showed that decreased lymphocyte count was present in 38.1% of the
COVID-19 patients. More than 80% of COVID-19 patients had normal WBC and neutrophil
counts. Compared with COVID-19 patients, the total WBC and neutrophil counts were higher in
non-COVID-19 patients. Additionally, more non-COVID-19 patients had higher than normal
WBC and neutrophil counts. However, lymphocyte counts and the proportions of patients with
decreased lymphocytes were not statistically different between the two groups (Table 3).
In non-COVID-19 patients, infiltrates on the CT scan mainly involved 1-2 lung lobes, while
in COVID-19 patients, lesions involving 4-5 lobes were more common. In COVID-19 patients,
lung lesions were mostly peripheral or sub-pleural in distribution, and in severe cases were
diffusely distributed (Figure 2). In non-COVID-19 patients, 34.3% showed airway-dominant
lesions, while diffuse distribution was found in only 4.5%. The patterns of the lesions showed no
significant difference between the two groups. However, centrilobular nodules were observed in
non-COVID-19 patients but not in COVID-19 patients (Table 4).
Discussion
As of Feb 15, 2020, 57416 cases of confirmed COVID-19 were reported in 31 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities in China, among which 49030 were in Hubei Province,
while in Beijing municipality, 380 confirmed cases were reported. Since the outbreak in early
December, 2019, case finding and reporting of COVID-19 were required for medical staff in Fever
Clinics around the country. During this study period, in Beijing, as in other regions of the country,
influenza and other respiratory infections were also prevalent; it was a challenge for physicians to
identify suspected COVID-19 from patients with fever, particularly from pneumonia of varied
etiologies. Our results here provide information on the prevalence of COVID-19 in the busy Fever
Clinic of a teaching hospital and differential characteristics from non-COVID-19 pneumonias.
From January 21, 2019, when the first case of COVID-19 was identified, up to Feb.15, 2020,
2123 patients visited our Fever Clinic because of fever and/or respiratory symptoms, and 342
patients were confirmed to have pneumonia by CT scan or in a few cases by Chest X-ray. The
prevalence of COVID-19 in all these pneumonia patients was 6.14% (21/342). The prevalence of

COVID-19 in cases with pneumonia sent for 2019-nCoV testing was 23.9% (21/88).
We found that epidemiological history was extremely important for identification of
suspected cases of COVID-19 and for differential diagnosis. Over 90% of the COVID-19 patients
had clearly identified epidemiological evidence, while in non-COVID-19 patients,
epidemiological links could only be found in 32.8%. In our series, most cases were imported from
the city of Wuhan or Hubei Province, including traveling to or living in Wuhan or other cities in
Hubei, and a few had a history of close contact with individuals coming from the above areas. In
the later phase of our study, contact with family members with confirmed COVID-19 was an
epidemiological feature and five family clusters were found. A report from Chinese CDC showed
that the incidence of COVID-19 outside Hubei Province peaked in Jan 24-27 and most cases
(68.6%) had ever exposed to Wuhan or Hubei within 14 days 11. Weight of exposure history
related to Wuhan and Hubei in confirmed cases was decreasing after February 11. Consistent to
previous reports, the incubation period of our cases was in a range of 2-10 days, with a median of
6.5 days 12-14.
A unique feature of our study was the comparison between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
cases visiting the same Fever Clinic at a certain period, with the finding that the total WBC count
and the neutrophil count were different between the two groups of patients. Increased total WBC
and neutrophil counts were more common in patients with other causes of pneumonia. In contrast,
although decrease of lymphocytes was also common in our study, the difference between
COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases was not significant, probably due to the fact that
pneumonias enrolled for this analysis were mostly viral(for example, influenza) or atypical, as
classical bacterial pneumonia had been excluded by first screening/triage. Additionally, the
percentage of our patients with decreased lymphocytes was not as high as that reported in some
previous studies 2,15, perhaps due to differences in disease severity. Blood lymphopenia was
observed in up to 85% of critically ill patients with COVID-19 16. Compared with mild and
moderate cases, severe cases were more likely to have lymphopenia 2,16,17. A recent paper by Xu
and colleagues showed a lymphocyte decrease in 38% of the cases within symptom onset ≤10
days

18

, which was consistent with our data. Therefore, we speculate that persisting decrease of

lymphocytes may be an indicator of severe disease, rather than a criterion for the diagnosis of
COVID-19.
Unlike pneumonia caused by other pathogens, COVID-19 has some unique characteristics on
the CT scan. Firstly, multi-lobe involvement was more common in COVID-19 as compared to
non-COVID-19 pneumonia. The lesions, including GGO, mixed GGO and consolidation, or
patchy consolidation, were mainly distributed in peripheral and sub-pleural areas in mild to
moderate cases, while in severe cases diffuse ground glass lesions were present. In the study by
Pan and colleagues, 11.1% and 44.4% of the 63 patients showed four and five lobe involvement,
with patchy/punctate GGO and patchy consolidation being the dominant patterns on CT scan

.

Other studies also demonstrated similar CT findings .
Our study had several limitations. As a single-center, retrospective study of patients mainly
from Haidian District in Beijing, the prevalence of COVID-19 in this Fever Clinic was not
representative. The sample was small-sized and mostly mild and moderate in severity, which may
not reflect the whole picture of the disease. Furthermore, the pathogens causing pneumonia in
patients without COVID-19 were not identified, therefore we were unable to evaluate the
prevalence of other common viral pneumonias of this season, such as influenza pneumonia and

adenoviral pneumonia, making specific comparisons between different viral pneumonias
unavailable.
Conclusions
During the study period when COVID-19 was epidemic, the prevalence of COVID-19 in
patients with pneumonia visiting our Fever Clinic was 6.14%. Most of the COVID-19 cases were
mild and moderate in severity and more than 90% had identified epidemiological exposure.
Changes of WBC and neutrophil counts showed clinical significance for differential diagnosis of
pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV or other pathogens. CT findings of COVID-19 were
characteristic, including the number of affected lobes, lesion patterns and distribution, which may
be helpful for clinicians to identify suspected cases of COVID-19 from pneumonia of other
etiologies.
