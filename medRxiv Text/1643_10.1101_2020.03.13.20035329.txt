Summary
In this hospital-based case-cohort study, we found that serum urea nitrogen, TBIL,
LDH and AST/ALT ratio, several markers of extrapulmonary organ injuries, were
positively correlated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. We provide evidence for
the first time that multiple organ damage on admission influences the prognosis of
COVID-19 patients. Early hospitalization is beneficial for elevating the survival rate of
COVID-19 patients especially critical ill patients.

Abstract
Background. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggered by infection with severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been widely pandemic
all over the world. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence factors of death
risk among 200 COVID-19 patients.
Methods. Two hundred patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited.
Demographic data and clinical characteristics were collected from electronic medical
records. Biochemical indexes on admission were measured and patient's prognosis was
tracked. The association of demographic data, clinical characteristics and biochemical
indexes with death risk was analyzed.
Results. Of 200 COVID-19 patients, 163 (81.5%) had at least one of comorbidities,
including diabetes, hypertension, hepatic disease, cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary
disease and others. Among all patients, critical cases, defined as oxygenation index
lower than 200, accounted for 26.2%. Severe cases, oxygenation index from 200 to 300,
were 29.7%. Besides, common cases, oxygenation index higher than 300, accounted
for 44.1%. At the end of follow-up, 34 (17%) were died on mean 10.9 day after
hospitalization. Stratified analysis revealed that older ages, lower oxygenation index
and comorbidities elevated death risk of COVID-19 patients. On admission, 85.5%
COVID-19 patients were with at least one of extrapulmonary organ injuries.
Univariable logistic regression showed that ALT and TBIL, two indexes of hepatic
injury, AST, myoglobin and LDH, AST/ALT ratio, several markers of myocardial injury,
creatinine, urea nitrogen and uric acid, three indexes of renal injury, were positively
associated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. Multivariable logistic regression
revealed that AST/ALT ratio, urea nitrogen, TBIL and LDH on admission were
positively correlated with death risk of COVID-19 patients.
Conclusion. Older age, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities on admission
elevate death risk of COVID-19 patients. AST/ALT ratio, urea nitrogen, TBIL and LDH
on admission may be potential prognostic indicators. Early hospitalization is of great

Introduction
Since December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness patients with unclear
causes have been found in some hospitals in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.1 On
February12, 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has declared
that the official classification of the new coronavirus is severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This is a novel member of human coronavirus,
newly identified recently. World Health Organization (WHO) pronounces that the
official name of the disease caused by the virus is corona virus disease 2019 (COVID19). The main symptoms and signs of COVID-19 patients are with fever, dry cough,
dyspnea, fatigue and lymphopenia. In severe and critical patients, SARS-CoV-2
infections caused viral pneumonia may lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome and
even death.

2-4

After the first patient was reported in December 2019 in Wuhan City,

Hubei Province, China, this infecting disease broke out quickly, spread around all over
the world and was persistently evolving so far. 5 Until 6 March, 2020, 80581 cases were
confirmed to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 3016 cases died from SARSCoV-2 infection in China. In other countries, total 17024 COVID-19 patients were
confirmed and 343 patients died after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. 6
SARS-CoV-2 is mainly infected through the respiratory tract in humans. Several
groups have reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients. Except for lung
injury, infection with SARS-CoV-2 induces myocardial dysfunction, hepatic injury and
even renal failure.7 The rate of overall case-fatality was about 2.3% across China.

8

Although few deaths were found in mild COVID-19 patients, the rate of case-fatality
was obviously elevated among critical ill patients. Nevertheless, what factors influence
the prognosis and death of COVID-19 patients have not been clarified.
The aim of the present study is to analyze risk factors of the prognosis and death
among 200 COVID-19 patients. We show that older ages, lower oxygenation index and
comorbidities are death risk factors of COVID-19 patients. We demonstrate for the first

time that serum urea nitrogen, TBIL, LDH and AST/ALT ratio on admission may be
potential prognostic indicators of COVID-19 patients.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
For this study, 220 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited from Union
Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 1 to January
30, 2020. All patients were clinically diagnosed with viral pneumonia on basis of
typical clinical manifestations (fever or other respiratory symptoms) accompanied with
the obvious chest radiology changes. Union Hospital of Huazhong University of
Science and Technology is one of COVID-19-designated hospitals for the
hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. In
order to respond to national summons positively, the Second Affiliated Hospital of
Anhui Medical University enthusiastically sent to a medical team to recuse patients
with COVID-19 in Wuhan City. All patients were initially detected with real-time RTPCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, analyzed genetic sequence that matched COVID19 and confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2. Twenty patients with negative COVID19 detection results were excluded in the present research. All 200 patients with
COVID-19 were eligible in this research and we followed up the patients’ outcomes.
Each COVID-19 patients gave advanced oral consent. This study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of Anhui Medical University.
Date collection
The medical records of each patients with COVID-19 were evaluated by research
team in the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Union Hospital of
Huazhong University of Science and Technology as well as the Second Affiliated
Hospital of Anhui Medical University. Following fundamental data were collected from
the electronic medical records of each patient: demographic information, preexisting
comorbidities including chronic pulmonary disease, hepatic disease, cardiovascular
disease, hypertension, diabetes and other disease, as well as exposure history, medical

history, surgery history, signs and symptoms, chest computed tomographic (CT) scan
and laboratory test results. The date of disease onset and hospital date, as well as death
date were recorded. The onset time was defined as the date when patients’ any
symptoms and signs were found.
Laboratory testing
Patient’s pharyngeal swab specimens were collected for extracting SARS-CoV-2
RNA. Viral nucleic acid was detected via real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerasechain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay with a COVID-19 nucleic acid detection kit following
operating instructions (Shanghai bio-germ Medical Technology Co Ltd). All viral RNA
extracting and nucleic acid detection for patients were executed by the Center for
Disease Control and Prevention of Wuhan City. All medical laboratory tests, including
white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, basophil, total bilirubin
(TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), creatinine, urea nitrogen, uric acid, creatine kinase, creatine
kinase isoenzyme, oxygenation index were examined on admission. The definition of
organ injuries was that any of the biochemical indexes of liver function, renal function
or myocardial function were beyond normal range. 9 All medical laboratory tests were
analyzed by the clinical laboratory of Union Hospital of Huazhong University of
Science and Technology.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 21.0 software. Categorical
variables were expressed with frequencies and percentages. Continuous variables were
shown using median and mean values. Means for continuous variables were compared
with independent-samples t tests when the data were normally distributed; if not, the
Mann-Whitney test was used. Proportions for categorical variables were compared with
the chi-square and Fisher’s exact test. Univariable logistic regression between basic
disease or different parameter and demise was performed. Moreover, the main risks
related with demise were examined using multivariable logistic regression models

adjusted for potential confounders. Statistical significance was determined at P＜0.05.
Results
1. Demographics data and clinical characteristics
The clinical characteristics of all patients are descripted in Table 1. Of 200 cases,
99 (49.3%) patients were males. 49 (24.5%) cases were younger than 49 years, 53
(26.5%) cases between 50 to 59 years, 59 (29.5%) cases between 60 to 69 years, and
39 (19.8%) cases older than 70 years. Among all cases, 163 (81.5%) had at least one of
comorbidities, such as diabetes (68.2%), hypertension (51.5%), hepatic disease (4.5%),
cardiac disease (8.0%), chronic pulmonary disease (4.0%) and others (3.5%). The most
common symptom of COVID-19 patients was fever (88.0%), followed by diarrhea
(59.7%), fatigue (52.2%) and cough (46.3%) (Supplemental Table 1). Among all
patients, critical cases, defined as oxygenation index lower than 200, accounted for 51
(26.2%). Severe cases, oxygenation index from 200 to 300, were 58(29.7%). Besides,
common cases, oxygenation index higher than 300, accounted for 88(44.1%). The
median oxygenation index was 282.9, far below normal range. The blood routine
analysis showed that median WBC count was 5.05×109/L. As shown in Supplemental
Table 2, median neutrophil count was 3.51×109/L and median lymphocyte count was
0.88×109/L.
2. Association of demographic data, clinical characteristics and comorbidities
with death risk of COVID-19 patients
Thirty-four patients were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. The
association of demographic data with death risk of COVID-19 patients was analyzed.
As shown in Table 1, fatality rate was 16.2% in male patients and 17.8% in female
patients. Moreover, no difference on the fatality rate of COVID-19 patients was found
between smokers and nonsmokers. The influence of ages on the fatality rate of COVID19 patients is presented in Table 1. The fatality rate was 4.08% in COVID-19 patients
younger than 40 years old, 8 (15.1%) patients between 50 and 59 years old, 7 (11.9%)

patients between 60 and 69 years old, and 17 (43.6%) patients over 70 years old. The
RR was 3.698 (95% Cl: 0.825, 16.574; P=0.062) in COVID-19 patients between 50 and
59 years old, 2.907 (95% Cl: 0.632, 13.359; P=0.145) in patients between 60 and 69
years old, and 10.679 (95% Cl: 2.624, 43.459; P＜0.001) in patients over 70 years old,
respectively. The relationship between oxygenation index and death risk of COVID-19
patients was analyzed. As shown in Table 1, the fatality rate was 52.9% in critical ill
cases, 6.90% in severe cases, and 3.49% in common cases, respectively. The RR was
15.176 (95% Cl: 4.847, 47.519; P＜0.001) in critical ill cases with COVID-19 and
4.095 (95% Cl: 0.975, 17.1979; P=0.039) in severe cases, respectively. The correlation
between comorbidities and death risk of COVID-19 patients was then evaluated. As
shown in Table 1, the fatality rate was 23.0% in COVID-19 patients with at least one
of comorbidities, remarkably higher than 7.69% in COVID-19 patients without
comorbidity. The RR was 2.969 (95% Cl: 0.965, 9.131; P=0.033) in COVID-19 patients
with comorbidities. Further analysis found that the fatality rate was 50% in COVID-19
patients with chronic pulmonary disease, remarkably higher than 15.6% in COVID-19
cases without chronic pulmonary disease. The RR was 3.200 (95% Cl: 1.486, 6.890;
P=0.011) in subjects with chronic pulmonary disease. No statistically significant
association was observed between death risk and other coexisting comorbidities, such
as diabetes, hypertension, hepatic disease, cardiac disease and other chronic diseases
(Table 1).
3. Associations between biochemical indexes and death risk of COVID-19
patients
The present study found that 182 COVID-19 patients (85.5%) were with at least
one of extrapulmonary organ injuries, including 66 (33.0%) with liver injury, 45 (22.5%)
with acute kidney injury, 148 (74.0%) with cardiac injury. The association between
indexes of hepatic injury on admission and death risk was analyzed among 200 COVID19 patients. As shown in Table 2, median TBIL was 11.4 μm/L, whereas median DBIL
was 2.3 μm/L (Table 2). TBIL of 17 (8.5%) patients and DBIL of 19 (9.5%) patients

were beyond normal range. The median ALT was 23.5 U/L. ALT of 56 (28.6%) patients
were above 80 U/L (Table 2). Univariable logistic regression analysis showed that
serum ALT (OR=1.403; 95% Cl: 1.020,1.929; P＜0.05) and TBIL (OR=12.113; 95%
Cl: 1.905, 77.014; P＜0.01) were positively with death risk of COVID-19 patients.
There was no remarkable association between serum DBIL and death risk of COVID19 patients (Table 3). The relationship between renal function markers on admission
and death risk was evaluated. The results revealed that median creatinine was 66.0 μm/L
among COVID-19 patients, of which 17 (8.5%) cases were above normal range. The
median urea nitrogen was 4.5 mm/L among COVID-19 patients, of which 36 cases
(18.0%) were beyond normal range. The median uric acid was 257.0 μm/L and 17 cases
(8.5%) were above normal limits. Univariable logistic regression analysis indicated that
serum creatinine (OR=2.094; 95% Cl: 1.413, 3.102; P ＜ 0.001), urea nitrogen
(OR=4.041; 95% Cl: 2.344, 6.967; P＜0.001) and uric acid (OR=1.794; 95% Cl: 1.265,
2.546; P＜0.001) were positively with death risk of COVID-19 patients (Table 3).
Finally, the correlation between myocardial enzyme parameters and death risk was
revealed in Table 3. The median LDH, creatine kinase and AST were 274.0, 90.5, and
35.0 U/L, respectively. Further analysis showed that serum AST and LDH of half
patients were far beyond normal range. As shown in Table 2, AST/ALT ratio was 1.43
among 200 patients. The number of serum myoglobin-positive patients was 119
(59.2%), whereas the number of serum cardiac troponin Ⅰ-positive patients was 137
(68.5%). As shown in Table 3, univariable logistic regression analysis found that there
was a positive correlation between serum creatine kinase (OR=2.127; 95% Cl: 1.439,
3.147; P＜0.001), myoglobin (OR=3.624; 95% Cl: 1.590, 8.259; P＜0.001), LDH
(OR=5.929; 95% Cl: 3.116, 11.281; P＜0.001), AST (OR=2.627; 95% Cl: 1.586, 4.351;
P＜0.001), and AST/ALT ratio (OR=3.279; 95% Cl: 1.917, 5.607; P＜0.001) with
death risk of COVID-19 patients (Table 3). Multivariable logistic regression was used
to analyze the relationship between biochemical indexes and death risk of COVID-19
patients after adjustment for potential confounding factors. The results found that only
serum TBIL (OR=1.062; 95% Cl: 1.007, 1.120; P＜0.05), urea nitrogen (OR=1.589;

95% Cl: 1.273, 1.984; P＜0.001), LDH (OR=10.395; 95% Cl: 2.163, 49.957; P＜0.01)
and AST/ALT ratio (OR=3.224; 95% Cl: 1.586, 6.555; P＜0.001) were positively
associated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. However, there was no relationship
between other biochemical indexes and death risk of COVID-19 patients (Table 4).
Discussion
The present study aimed to analyze influence factors of death risk among 200
COVID-19 patients. The main findings of the present study include: (1) older age and
comorbidities are risk factors of death in COVID-19 patients; (2) lower oxygenation
index on admission elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients. (3) serum urea nitrogen,
TBIL, LDH and AST/ALT ratio on admission are potential indicators of death risk
among COVID-19 patients.
Up to March 6, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection has caused 3016 deaths all over
China. 10 As no specific drug, it is important to clarify which factors increase death risk
of COVID-19 patients. In the present study, we analyzed the association between major
demographic characteristics and death risk of COVID-19 patients. Our results showed
that no significant difference on the fatality rate was observed between males and
females. A recent study indicated that smoking increases the risk of infection with
SARS-CoV-2.

11

In the present study, we analyzed the influence of smoking on death

risk of COVID-19 patients. Unexpectedly, there was no difference on the fatality rate
between smokers and nonsmokers. A recent report showed that elderly patients with
critical COVID-19 were more likely to die. 12 The present study found that the fatality
rate was 4.08% in COVID-19 patients younger than 40 years old, 15.1% in patients
between 50 and 59 years old, 11.9% in patients between 60 and 69 years old, and 43.6%
in patients over 70 years old. Our results provide additional evidence that older age
elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients.
Several reports demonstrated that COVID-19 patients with comorbidities were at
an increased death risk. 2 Indeed, the present study showed that 161 COVID-19 patients

(80.5%) were with at least one of comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension,
hepatic disease, cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease and others. Thus, we
analyzed the association between comorbidities and death risk of COVID-19 patients.
Our results showed that comorbidities obviously elevated death risk of COVID-19
patients. Further analysis found that neither cardiac nor hepatic diseases were
associated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, COVID-19 patients
with chronic pulmonary disease, mainly COPD, obviously elevated death risk. The
present study showed that more than half COVID-19 patients were with either diabetes
or hypertension. Therefore, it is especially interesting whether these comorbidities
increase death risk of COVID-19 patients. We found that there was a trend for
hypertension and diabetes to elevate the risk of death from COVID-19 pneumonia.
These results need to be further demonstrated in a larger sample investigation.
Previous studies found that critical ill patients are more likely to die from COVID19 pneumonia.

8, 12

Among 200 COVID-19 patients, critical ill cases, defined as

oxygenation index lower than 200, accounted for 26.2%. Severe cases, oxygenation
index from 200 to 300, were 29.7%. In addition, common cases, whose oxygenation
index higher than 300, accounted for 44.1%. The present study analyzed the influence
of admission oxygenation index on death risk of COVID-19 patients. We showed that
fatality rate in critical ill cases, whose oxygenation index was lower than 200, was
52.9%, significantly higher than 6.90% in severe cases and 3.49% in common cases.
These results suggest that lower oxygenation index on admission elevates death risk of
COVID-19 patients.
Accumulating data demonstrate that angiotension converting enzyme (ACE)2, as
a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is abundantly expressed in airway epithelial cells and plays
a crucial role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 13 Recently, several groups
reported that ACE2 was expressed in renal tubular cells, hepatic cholangiocytes and
cardiocytes.

14-16

Indeed, multiple organ damage is usually accompanied at the early

stage of COVID-19 pneumonia. 17, 18 The present study showed that 85.5% COVID-19

patients were with at least one of extrapulm74.0% with cardiac injury. Thus, univariable
logistic regression was used to analyze the association between biochemical indexes of
extrapulmonary organ injury on admission and death risk of COVID-19 patients. As
expected, serum ALT and TBIL levels, two markers of liver injury, were positively
associated with fatality rate of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, creatinine, urea nitrogen
and uric acid, three serum indexes of kidney injury, had a prominently positive
association with death risk of COVID-19 patients. In addition, the increased creatine
kinase, myoglobin, LDH, AST and AST/ALT ratio, several serum markers of cardiac
injury, elevated death risk of COVID-19 patients. To exclude potential
confounding factors, multivariable logistic regression was used to further analyze the
relationship between biochemical indexes of extrapulmonary organ injuries and death
risk of COVID-19 patients. We found that serum urea nitrogen, TBIL, LDH and
AST/ALT ratio on admission were positively correlated with death risk of COVID-19
patients after adjustment for potential confounding factors. These results suggest that
extrapulmonary organ injuries on admission may be potential indicators of death risk
among COVID-19 patients. Therefore, early hospitalization is of great significance to
prevent multiple organ damage and improve the survival of COVID-19 patients.
In summary, the present study analyzed influence factors of prognosis and death
among 200 COVID-19 patients. We showed that older ages, lower oxygenation index
and comorbidities on admission elevated death risk of COVID-19 patients. Serum
urea nitrogen, LDH, TBIL and AST/ALT ratio on admission are potential indicators of
death risk among COVID-19 patients. We provide evidence for the first time that
multiple organ damage on admission may influence prognosis of COVID-19 patients.
Early hospitalization is beneficial for elevating the survival rate of COVID-19 patients
especially critical ill patients.
