Key messages
What is already known about this subject?
►► Due to their small dimensions, airborne particles are able to penetrate
through inhalation into many human organs, from the lungs to the cardiovascular
system and the brain, which can threaten our health. Research has shown that
air pollution is an important cofactor increasing the risk of mortality from
coronaviruses.
What are the new findings?
►► Evidence exists that the magnetic fraction of PM has modulated the
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Thessaloniki, and potentially in any other region
in the world.
How might this impact on policy or clinical practice in the foreseeable
future?
►► Policymakers should take care not to overestimate the effect of social
distancing interventions and should consider the impact of air pollution in current
or future epidemic waves.

ABSTRACT
Objectives To examine the impact of concentrations of ambient fine particulate
matter (PM2.5) air pollution on the incidence of COVID-19.
Methods Publicly available data of COVID-19 deaths in March/October 2020
were compared with concentrations of PM2.5 measured in previous years at
urban and suburban areas in Thessaloniki. Similar publicly available data of
PM2.5 concentrations from Tehran were gathered for comparison. Crosscorrelation and Granger causality analysis were performed in order to assess
linkage.
Results On the one hand, the mean PM2.5 concentrations in Thessaloniki were
significantly higher in the winter, however the magnetic fraction of particulate
matter in the autumn is twice its annual average, suggesting that traffic-related
emissions alone may not explain the entire variability of PM2.5. On the other
hand, it is implied that changes in coronavirus-related deaths follow changes in
airborne magnetite, with the correlation between the two data sets being
maximized at the lag time of one-month. Further insight is provided by the
monthly pattern of PM2.5 mass concentrations in Tehran. We find that air
pollution Granger causes COVID-19 deaths (p<0.05).
Conclusions A significant association has been found between PM2.5 values
and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a bunch of regions. Reported links
between pollution levels, climate conditions and other factors affecting
vulnerability to COVID-19 may instead reflect inhalation exposure to magnetic
nanoparticles. A hypothesis has been set that ubiquitous airborne magnetite
pollution, together with certain climatic conditions, may promote a longer
permanence of the viral particles in the air, thus favoring transmission.

INTRODUCTION
A large body of literature has shown that long-term exposure to high levels of air
pollution can cause premature death among the elderly and more than 3 million
cardiopulmonary mortalities per annun [1]. In this context, it has been also
suggested that air pollution is an important cofactor increasing the risk of mortality
from coronavirus. For instance, analysis of the first severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV-1 outcomes in 2003 demonstrated that in
heavily polluted regions the risk of dying from the disease was >80% higher
compared with areas with relatively clean air [2]. Furthermore, a correlation -but
not necessarily a causal link- between NO2 levels (a pollutant produced mostly
by diesel vehicles) and COVID-19 cases has been recently reported [3], while
another study supports the hypothesis that the viral infectivity is higher in
hinterland cities rather than coastal areas due to airflow conditions that prevent
dispersal of air pollution [4].
Nonetheless, while there has been ample evidence for a relationship between
long-term air pollution exposure and the severity of COVID-19 outcomes [5,6],
one aspect that has yet to be described is the effect of seasonal variances on
excess mortality from COVID-19.
Apart from mass concentration and particle size distribution of aerosols, oxidative
potential has been suggested as possible driver of both the chronic and acute
consequences on human beings [7]. In this regard, high oxidative properties of
PM have been attributed to the high iron levels in vehicles emissions [8,9]. This
adds to the intrinsic redox activity of particles originating from wood burning [10],
which probably arises from the presence of magnetite and other co-associated
metal-bearing nanoparticles in soot and smoke [11,12,13].

At the time of writing, Greece is bracing for what seems to be a second wave of
the COVID-19 pandemic after a surge in cases during late summer, especially in
northern Greece where most victims are count in hospitals of Central Macedonia.
It somehow replicates the seasonal variations of anthropogenic magnetite
reported in a forthcoming paper [14]. Consequently, we aimed to verify whether
PM2.5 may exacerbate the impact of pandemic waves.

METHODS

magnetometry as described elsewhere [14]. Briefly, cumulative 24-hour samples
were collected on PTFE PM2.5 (referring to particles smaller than 2.5 μm) filters,
using a vacuum pump, operating at a flow rate of ~2 m3/h. Seasonal arithmetic
mean concentrations were calculated over the period from February 2015 to
October 2018. The routine analysis comprises gravimetric monitoring with a
precision microbalance (±1 μg); trace element quantification using scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS); crystal
and morphological characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
The magnetic fraction was obtained after rinsing the filters in a mixed solution of
acetone and polyvinyl alcohol under the influence of an externally imposed
magnetic field gradient by means of a NdFeB magnet. Complimentarily, magnetic
nanoparticles were also detected in swab specimens collected in late autumn
2019 from the nasal mucosa of patients in the Otorhinolaryngology Clinic of the
General Hospital “Papageorgiou”. All patients gave written informed consent
before study inclusion.

To examine the potential association between PM2.5 levels and spread of
COVID-19 in big cities located in different geographical areas, statistical analysis
was performed on data from Tehran, based on Nabavi et al. [15]. The monthly
pattern of PM2.5 mass concentrations during the period (2011–2016) was
compared to confirmed deaths from COVID-19 in Iran, as reported by the
“Worldometer” website, updated with daily frequency [16]. The time-series data
were interpolated to evenly spaced observations [17]. Lead-lag relationships
were investigated by cross-correlation analysis of monthly data during the period
from March to October. Granger causality was computed by testing the null
hypotheses in the Free Statistics Software from Wessa.net [18].

RESULTS
We build on the observation of magnetic traces of in vivo human nasal swab
samples [14]. The magnetically responsive dust is made of aggregates in which
particles with rounded morphologies and a mean size around 15 nm appear
basically made of magnetite (and minor contribution of Fe3+ rich shell and
substituted heavy metals such as Cr, Mn, Co or V).
Our findings suggest that, given their tiny size < 5 μm, these combustion-derived
particles remain airborne for a long time [19], and can penetrate the airways all
the way down to the alveolar space [20]. Furthermore, inhalation of PM may
trigger susceptibility to respiratory infections, such as the SARS-CoV-2, since
nasal surfaces are suggested as initial loci of disease [21]. According to this
hypothesis, magnetite could then tentatively offer a Trojan horse docking for virus
infectivity via the Fenton-mediated hydroxyl radical production. Indeed, recent

studies revealed that iron oxide nanoparticles interact efficiently with the SARSCoV-2 spike binding proteins [22].
In this framework, we analyzed whether seasonal variations of airborne
magnetite has positive qualitative effects on coronavirus mortality. Results for
Greece are shown in Fig. 1. Two main conclusions can be drawn from this chart:
first, given the current epidemiological situation and with regards to the reopening of schools on 14th September, the decision was not insignificant at all.
The figure above shows that the country was making progress on bringing down
the curve of new coronavirus deaths until when it was necessary for families to
return to big cities from summer vacations, and consequently air pollution peaked.
It adds to evidence that adolescents can seed clusters of COVID-19 cases [23].
Secondly, the air pollution conditions may had been favorable for the virus
circulation since late September 2019, much earlier than the first reported cases.
We note that WHO declared the pandemic on 11th March 2020. Officially, a 38year-old woman who returned to Thessaloniki from Milan by air on 23 rd February
2020 became Greece’s first coronavirus. Though, a growing body of evidence
suggest that the new SARS-CoV-2 virus had already been circulating unnoticed
in the community a few months before the first reported case in Wuhan City,
China, by December 2019 [24].

airborne magnetite pollutant. The thin red bars represent the 7-period moving
average for new daily confirmed deaths from COVID-19 in Greece (data retrieved
from Worldometer database). Note that there is about a four weeks delay from
first symptoms after infection to death. The thick blue bars depict the percentage
of magnetic material estimated from PM2.5 observations at urban site in
Thessaloniki, representatively for the years 2015-2018.

It is also worth noting that during the winter and spring times the mean PM2.5
concentration in Thessaloniki exceeds the European ambient air quality standard
of 25 μg/m3 [14]. It would mean that the attributable fraction of COVID-19 mortality
due to the long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate air pollution could be as
high as 50% [5]. But when this analysis is applied to the magnetic percentage
attributed to air pollution from anthropogenic sources that peaks during the
autumn, it potentially explains the rise in incidence of the second wave of the
pandemic outbreak. Magnetic particulate matter shows maximum values during

autumn months (0.8 % wt.), compared to <0.4% in spring, meaning that doubling
the concentration of airborne pollutants leads to a ten- to 20-fold increase in the
number of deaths linked to COVID-19. This goes in line with other studies, which
have found that the association between the pollutant and the health outcome is
log-linear [25,26]. Consequently, our research strongly suggests that magnetic
parameters can be used as an efficient proxy to assess the urban atmospheric
quality and the impact of COVID-19 in Thessaloniki, and potentially in any other
region in the world. Therefore, further investigations focusing on the development
of COVID-19 outbreaks over highly polluted areas are encouraged.
For the while let us, for historical reasons, focus on Iran since the ancient Persian
and Greek cultures intermingled when Alexander the Great conquered most of
that region by 330 BC. In addition, interest arises from the fact that, when it comes
to number of new deaths per day, the third wave of coronavirus in Iran is the worst
yet (Fig. 2).

Figure 2. Two or more 'camel humps' in Iran. The thick blue bars depict the
monthly pattern of PM2.5 mass concentrations during the period (2011–2016) in
Tehran. The thin red bars represent the 7-period moving average for new daily
confirmed deaths from COVID-19 in Iran, as of 28th October 2020.

On this matter, Iran as a developing country is facing severe problems in terms
of air quality. Urban air pollution due to PM2.5 in Tehran and other regions of the
country has been reported by many researchers [15,27,28,29]. Accordingly, most
cities in Iran have PM2.5 concentrations above the WHO air quality guideline
value, which in turn are magnified by frequent desert dust storms during the
summer months as temperatures rise and rainfall reaches a minimum [30].
However, the highest amounts of PM2.5 are normally recorded during winter. The
increase of PM concentration in the cold period of the year is due not only to the
increased emissions from additional sources, such as domestic heating, but
rather also to the decrease in the thickness of the mixing layer. These episodes
have had notable health effects. As such, the highest number of deaths due to

exposure to fine particles was estimated to occur in Iran's largest city, Tehran,
where motor vehicles play a major role. Other episodes that may be linked to
human activity include the significant drop of PM in the spring caused by Tehran's
minimal traffic flow during Nowruz holidays.
The figure above depicts that the coronavirus casualties follow the seasonal
variation of air pollution closely, except that the PM2.5 waves start sometime
early. This plot is of special interest since the data can be used to validate the
causal association between pollution and COVID-19 severity. Techniques exist
for establishing the direction of causality and have previously been used primarily
in fields such as econometrics [31]. For instance, to say “one variable X Granger
causes another variable Y” means that, by using past values of both X and Y, we
can better predict future values of Y than by using only past values of Y. So the
prediction of Y is significantly improved by including X as a predictor. Let Y = daily
deaths be the potential outcome in the population of a country exposed to X =
pollution concentration. We computed Granger causality by testing the null
hypotheses of X does not Granger-cause Y and vice versa. The results of these
tests are reported in Table 1.

The correlation between the two data sets is maximized at the lag time of onemonth, which is reasonable given that there are significant delays between
infection, the onset of symptomatic disease, and recovery or death; people who
died this week were most likely infected as far back as a month ago [32]. This
implies that the changes in coronavirus-related deaths follow the PM2.5 changes.
Furthermore, according to the p-values in this table, PM2.5 values provide
statistically significant information about the future values of deaths: the p-value
of 0.04 means the null hypothesis that X does not cause Y can be rejected. On
the other hand, the p-value of 0.86 allows us to accept the null for X = f(Y). The
fact that first hypothesis was rejected and second was not means that X can be
used to forecast Y. Moreover, we have conducted a sensitivity analysis by using

mid-month values on the 15th day, and log-transformed data, and the results
remained robust and consistent. Consequently, it is safe to conclude that a
portion of the variability of the clinical syndrome of COVID-19 might be affected
by environmentally driven variance of nasal infectivity.

DISCUSSION
The relationship to COVID-19 mortality in Iran is not unexpected, considering the
significant association between patterns of PM2.5 mass concentrations and
cases of cardiovascular mortality. For example, a study of the 2008-2017 period
showed that 2009 and 2010 were the most polluted and unhealthy years, the
lowest being 2014, coincidentally during the minimum and maximum of solar
cycle 24, respectively [29]. Incidentally, note that a small amount of iron oxides
arrives as cosmic flux [33]. This relationship has significant practical implications
deserving of further research.
Despite their diversified sources of data and the methods of reconstructions, the
strikingly high congruence among the PM2.5 pollution and the COVID-19 impact
records warrants the reliability of the analysis. Further support for this causal
interpretation also comes from literature on associations of daily pollution
variations of PM2.5 and black carbon –while the same is not true for nitrogen
dioxide NO2– on daily deaths in the Boston area, U.S. [34]. It is also noteworthy
that similar Granger causal relationships have been reported between daily
values of PM2.5 pollution and new daily COVID-19 infections in Emilia-Romagna,
Italy [35]. The explanation is particularly interesting as the phenomena seem to
be global in scale. This may have possible implications for the evolution of
pandemic coronavirus in distant places of the Greek diaspora as far as California

and Australia (see Supporting Information). Therefore, the association between
PM2.5 and deaths during this pandemic is almost certainly causal. In this regard,
we note that there is growing evidence that indoor airborne transmission due to
droplets <2µm is the primary driver of the global COVID-19 pandemic [36].
Hence, the study of PM2.5 may be allied to some truths in medicine when battling
COVID-19 pandemic.
The present study has several limitations that should be considered when
interpreting its findings. First, our causal modeling is designed to handle pairs of
variables, in which only linear relationships between predictor (pollution) and
target variable (casualties) are considered, thus it may suffer from a typical
limitation when a third variable is engaged. For instance, variation of
meteorological factors (such as temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and
prevailing winds) confines the vertical distribution of air contaminants, but also
modulates human activities such as commuting choices and leisure occupation,
and would subsequently impact the relationship between PM and the spread of
infections. Consequently, the second issue is the potential of missing other
important confounding factors (Supporting Information). A third limitation of this
study is missing data. The estimate results obtained here are preliminary and
must be treated with caution when analyzing, as in our case, short time series.
This adds to the fact that the environmental study was performed at the city level,
and inference of the epidemic dynamics at the nationwide level is dubious. But
overall, limitations in data availability on the occurrence of magnetite in the
atmosphere remain the main obstacle to conducting conclusive studies on this
topic. Given the above considerations, future studies are needed involving a
larger number of observations.

Final mention must go to the fact that our results are provisional, based on
epidemiological data collected up to the end of November 2020, and a
comprehensive evaluation will need to follow after the COVID-19 pandemic. In
this regard, it is to be seen whether our initial conclusions remain appropriate and
would be relevant to the public health response to future outbreaks.
