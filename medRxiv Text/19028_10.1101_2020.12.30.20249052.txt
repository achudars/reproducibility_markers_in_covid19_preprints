(Dated: December 30, 2020)
Since March 6, when Colombia confirmed its first case of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the
country healthcare system, with a limited testing capability, has struggled to monitor and report
current cases. At the outbreak of a virus, data on cases is sparse and commonly severe cases, with a
higher probability of a fatal resolution, are detected at a higher rate than mild cases. In addition, in
an under-sampling situation, the number of total cases is under-estimated leading to a biased case
fatality rate estimation, most likely inflating the virus mortality. Real time estimation of case fatality
ratio can also be biased downwards by overlooking the delay between symptoms onset to death. In
this communication, using reported data from Instituto Nacional de Salud up to December 28, we
estimate the case fatality rate for Covid-19 in Colombia and some of its regions and cities adjusting
for delay from onset to death. We then apply the method proposed by Russell et al. [1], and use our
corrected case fatality rate to estimate the percentage of Covid-19 cases reported in Colombia as
42.95% (95% confidence interval: 42.50–43.41), which corresponds to a total of 3’661,621 estimated
Covid-19 cases in the country.

INTRODUCTION

Keeping track of active cases in a pandemic is of
paramount importance for epidemiological tracking in
the early stages of the contagion spread. In more advanced stages of a pandemic where epidemiological routes
cannot be constructed, effectively testing the population becomes a challenging task that must thrive to keep
under-reporting as low as possible. The accuracy in measuring case incidence and prevalence, as well as mortality
rates is decisive for high-quality epidemiological modelling that enables governments to propose and implement public policies to mitigate the impact of the pandemic [2–4].
Throughout the current Covid-19 pandemic, governments have mainly gathered databases of daily positive
cases and positive deaths. Due to the finite resources
of each country, tests for Covid-19 are performed only
on a subset of the total country’s population. Different
countries have different strategies to select those subsets. No matter how effective those strategies are, it
is expected that some infected people do not ever get
tested for Covid-19, and therefore are not reported into
the positive Covid-19 cases databases. This phenomenon
is known as under-reporting, and its magnitude varies
especially in relation with the effectiveness of epidemiological tracing strategies, as well as tests availability [5].
In this work we show how disease cases databases
can be used to estimate the magnitude of this under-

reporting, thus yielding better-quality figures for case incidence and mortality rates. In particular, we analyse
and report data from Colombia to assess its current situation of cumulative positive cases. Unlike seroprevalence
studies, the method that we use does not need to perform further tests than the ones already performed, and
whose results are contained in the cases databases.

Our method is based on the idea of comparing case fatality ratios (CFRs) between a target country, which in
our case is Colombia, and a benchmark country, which in
our case is the Republic of Korea. The benchmark country should be one that has a very effective testing strategy. This means that the scientific community is confident in that strategy, which also means that the benchmark country is expected to have low under-reporting.
The method answers the question of how many positive
cases would be detected in the target country if it were
using the testing strategy of the benchmark country? Related to this question, we also explain how to account for
differences between the population of the target and the
benchmark country.

This paper is divided as follows. Section II lays out the
data used for our study, and also details the method to
correct CFRs. Section III presents the estimated status
of Covid-19 in Colombia. Then section IV compares our
results with other studies, and also discusses some limitations of our study. Finally, we conclude in section V.

Cases

Since the main objective of our work is to estimate the
true number of cumulative positive cases of Covid-19 in
Colombia, in this section we explain a method to answer
the following question: for an arbitrary geographical region, can we account for under-reporting to estimate the
true number of cumulative positive cases?

The other dataset is extracted from the demographic
database maintained by the Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadı́stica (DANE) [7] . We retrieve
data containing the most recent projection for the year
2020 of the number of individuals per age group for all
regions and cities of Colombia (see fig. 2). This demographic dataset will be needed in order to assess the vulnerability of each region to Covid-19, as it is well documented that death risk strongly depends on age [8–10].

Delay adjusted case fatality rate estimate

Dividing deaths-to-date by cases-to-death to compute
the CFR (which we call from now on a naı̈ve determination of the CFR, or nCFR) tends to yield a biased result, usually underestimating its true value [11, 12]. This
happens because the outcome of active cases (i.e. recovery or death) is not known. An improved calculation of
the CFR can be done by accounting for the delay from
onset-to-death to estimate the number of cases expected
to have a known outcome.

Deaths

We use two datasets for our analysis. The first one is
the data published by the Instituto Nacional de Salud
(INS) [6], which is updated every day and reports all
known Covid-19 cases in Colombia. For each case it
provides its date of notification, location city, state or
district, current status (recovered, recovery from home,
being treated in an intensive care unit and passed away),
age, sex, country of provenance, symptom onset date,
date of death, date of diagnosis, date of recovery and the
web report date. From this information we derive the
case incidence as well as the distribution of days between
onset date and date of death for the cases that resulted in
death. For this, we need the onset date for every record
in the database, and their corresponding dates of death,
if the cases resulted in death. We also keep information
about age and location of each case. To construct the
case incidence time-series (see fig. 1) as well as the onsetto-death distribution we used data up to December 28,
2020.

FIG. 1. Covid-19 cases and deaths incidence in Colombia. Up
to December 28, 2020 there have been 1’594,497 confirmed
cases and 47,175 confirmed deaths. Notice that there is a
sudden drop at the latest days because data gathered in the
future includes cases with onset and death dates in the past.

Evaluating the delay time distribution between
onset-to-death.

We used the reported dates to calculate the time interval from illness onset to death of the confirmed 29,480
cases that resolved in death from March 16 to September 19 2020. The totality of cases in this period were
already resolved (i.e. recovered or dead). We fit the
conditional probability density f (t) of the time between
onset-to-death given death to Weibull, gamma, and lognormal distributions (as in the studies by Linton et al.
[13], Verity et al. [14]). In all cases we use the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to determine the parameters and obtain credible intervals using PyMC3 [15].
Furthermore, we include a gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE) to fit the data more tightly. We select
the best fit model by using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Table I shows estimates for the three models
plus the KDE. Although the lognormal distribution provided the best fit to data, we decided to use a gaussian

For Covid-19 the severity of the infection is highly correlated to the age of the infected individual [14], hence,
for each region or city, we evaluate age-stratified estimates of the adjusted case fatality rate, cCFRri , where r
stands for the region and i labels the age group. The age

it is shown in fig. 3, because the lognormal fit was found
to be largely inaccurate at the peak of the distribution

given by the lognormal distribution was 22.8 days (95%
CI: 22.5, 23.1), whereas with the KDE’s was 22.4 days.
As a comparison, Verity et al. [14] obtained a mean time
of 18.8 days (95% CI: 15.7, 49.7), and Linton et al. [13]
found a mean time of 15.0 days (95% CI: 12.8, 17.5).

Percentage of cases reported

The adjusted cCFR does not account for underreporting. In order to obtain an estimate of the potential
level of under-reporting in Colombia and its regions our
model follows the simple method proposed by Russell
et al. [1] further adjusting for the country demography.
We assume a baseline CFR (blCFR), taken from a benchmark country, and compare it with the estimated cCFR
for Colombia and some of its regions and cities. We do
an age-stratified analysis. If the cCFRri is higher than
blCFRi , it indicates that only a portion of the real number of cases in this age group have been reported so far.

The most recent literature offers several estimates CFR
for Covid-19. Among those adjusting or controlling for

Russell et al. [16], Shim et al. [17], Guan et al. [18]. In our
analysis, we use as benchmark country the Republic of
Korea. As baseline we use for this work the age stratified
CFR data of July 14, 2020 [19], listed in Table II, since
most of the cases from the first peak had already been
resolved by this date.

RESULTS

In our analysis we consider all regions and cities in
Colombia that have reported at least 40 fatal Covid-19
cases as of December 28, 2020. Table III shows the percentage of cases reported, the cCFR, blCFR and the total
cases and deaths for all regions of Colombia. Note that
the value of the blCFR fluctuates from region to region,
evidencing the differences in population demographics
between regions. For regions and cities with a younger
population than the average of the country, the blCFR
is lower compared to the value for the country. On the
contrary, in those regions or cities in which the fraction
of the population with age above 60 years is more significant, the blCFR is higher than the value for the country.
As an example, consider fig. 2 where the age distribution
of Amazonas, the region with the youngest population, is
compared to the age distribution of Risaralda, the region
with the oldest population. The corresponding blCFRs
mirror the demographics, with Amazonas’ blCFR being
0.5% and Risaralda’s being 1.4%.
We also present age-stratified reporting percentages for
all the regions in Colombia (with at least 40 fatal Covid19 cases) in table IV. A trend is notable: reporting percentage is much higher for the elder population, whereas

it is quite low for the young population. We hypothesise
that young people do not get tested as much as old people
because if symptomatic, they only develop mild symptoms in most cases [10, 20]. This is an important source
of uncertainty on the estimation of the virus propagation because young people are relevant vectors because
of mobility reasons, especially in cities [21, 22].
Furthermore, the framework so far exposed can be
used to evaluate reporting percentages and estimations
of cCFRs in the past by truncating the datasets. However, there is a detail that has to be handled carefully.
Notice that when we compute the cCFR, we are using
the number of death people reported up to today, and we
are using the case incidence curve reported up to today.
This means that we are in the best state of knowledge
that we can about today. However, tomorrow, we will
have a state of knowledge about today better than the
one we have today. This is because tomorrow there will
be some cases with onset symptoms dates from today
and from previous days. Similarly, tomorrow there will
be reported cases of people that died today or in previous
days. Therefore, we need to truncate the datasets based
on the report day only. Thus, if we truncate the database
a month ago, we ensure that we are reproducing the state
of knowledge that we had one month ago.
The evolution of reporting percentage confidence intervals are shown in fig. 4. Qualitatively, almost all regions
start with wide confidence intervals, and they become
narrow as more people are reported positive or dead because of Covid-19. Also, in most regions the reporting
percentage raises as time passes by. An important feature is that in some of the most inhabited regions, there
are drops on the reporting percentage about July-August.
This coincides with the peak of positive cases reported in
Colombia. Even though the number of tests also incremented on those dates, they did not match the rate at
which new cases and more importantly, new deaths rose.
These plots can also be useful to evaluate different
public policies being carried out at each region. For instance, Boyacá closed their borders early on in the pandemic [23]. Later, they opened the borders, and naturally, the number of cases grew. The peak is found to
be at the end of October and beginning of November.
Nonetheless, despite a pronounced peak, the number of
tests was enough to maintain the same reporting percentage over the course of those months, as seen in fig. 4.
Another interesting case is Amazonas, the largest state
in Colombia by area. It hit the headlines several times
because it had the largest number of deaths per inhabitant at the start of the pandemic (around May) [24]. As a
consequence, the government performed many tests (with
respect to other states), making Amazonas the state with
more performed tests per inhabitant. Despite this special
attention that the state got, its reporting percentage is
well below the average of Colombia.

DISCUSSION

An important point has to be remarked on the validity of our results. We saw that we corrected the CFR
for today with the information that we possess today. In
the future we will have more information about today,
and a better correction of the CFR for today can be estimated. To account for this lag of information we would
need to predict how many cases will be reported in future days. To perform this prediction, we need to use
information about how many people have been infected
so far. And calculating how many people have been infected so far needs the prediction of new cases. Thus, this
becomes an auto-consistent problem which falls beyond
the scope of this work. Nonetheless, the further correction that can be achieved by solving this auto-consistent
problem can be important, especially in the early stages

of the pandemic. For instance, a simple prediction of
new cases done by linear regression on the case incidence
time-series can yield statistically significant differences in
the reporting percentage that we estimate (not shown).
More accurate predictions done by fitting epidemiological
models can improve the accuracy of our last statement.

Our study compared to others

Comparing our results with the extant literature, we
find that it is qualitatively consistent (in the case of the
complete country of Colombia) with the study by Russell et al. [1]. They find a peak in the reporting percentage around May-June, but we find it centered in June
(c.f. fig. 4). This can be due to different onset-to-death
distributions taken into account: ours is deduced from a

distribution built taking into account the onset-to-death,
whereas theirs is a generalisation of a hospitalisation-todeath distribution from Wuhan. Then, the reporting percentage starts to grow in their study and ours. Furthermore, previous to May, we find an increase in the error,
whereas their study still finds low error in the estimation
of the reporting percentage. However, the magnitude of
the estimation error rapidly decreases as more deaths are
recorded. Furthermore, since our analysis includes the
demographics of Colombia and its regions, this allows to
identify their vulnerability. On average, Colombia has a
younger population than the population from China [18],
which is why our baseline CFR is lower than Russell’s,
which is 1.4%. This explains why the range of reporting
percentages is lower in our study than in theirs, where
reporting percentages reach 50% in August.
Another important resource when trying to estimate
the true number of infected Covid-19 cases in Colombia
and its regions is a seroprevalence study. In Colombia,
some seroprevalence studies were recently published. In
table V we show the results for some Colombian cities.
By dividing the reported number of deaths by an estimate of the cases given by the seroprevalence studies, we
computed the corresponding nCFR for each city. We also
added the results of seroprevalence studies for two of the

most affected zones in Europe and the New York State.
We see a high seroprevalence and low values of nCFR in
all of Colombia regions. On the other hand, European
zones show an opposite situation. In the case of New
York, the study was done just before the days with a
high number of daily deaths (29 March), which is why
the nCFR is very low. Rosenberg et al. [25] mentioned
that if they considered an average of 19 days between
onset-to-death as an average, the nCFR would be 0.6 %,
which still doubles the nCFR found in Colombia. As a
conclusion, the nCFR of Colombia deduced by seroprevalence studies in all its regions is smaller than in other
countries. We hypothesise that this could be due to the
age-distribution of the countries: Colombia’s population
is younger than USA’s, Spain’s and Italy’s.

Also, Colombian seroprevalence studies are preliminary and the methodology details is not publish yet.
Therefore, we do not know the possible biases. Particularly, the Monterı́a study [26] has a possible bias because
tested people were chosen randomly in different neighbourhoods and it is known that cities have intrinsically
heterogeneous mobility patterns [21], thus making any
uniform random samples problematic [27, 28].

Limitations

Our study makes some assumptions that directly impact the results, therefore, the figures given in this work
have to consider the following limitations:
• We do not account for comorbidities of the population which can influence the vulnerability (i.e.
the baseline CFR) of a country or a region.
The main comorbidities correlated with Covid-19
deaths are cerebrovascular disease, high-blood pressure, chronic obstructive pulmonar diseases, diabetes, among others [32].
• Also, we ignore the burden of the healthcare system

among other regional and socio-economical factors
that might influence the capacity of a country or a
region to attend all important Covid-19 cases.
• Our results are liked and biased by the baseline
CFR, which come from measured nCFRs from the
Republic of Korea. An important effect is that reporting percentage (and therefore the estimation of
seroprevalence) can change a lot for small errors in
the estimation of the baseline CFR.
• Our results ignore deaths under-counting. In
fact, as we discussed by comparing our results to
seroprevalence studies in Colombia, it seems that
nCFRs are too low when compared with many

other seroprevalence studies. Since it is expected
that mortality is higher, it is a possibility that there
is a strong death under-counting in Colombia.
• We do not take into account different strains of
Covid-19 and the different CFRs for each type [33,
34].

CONCLUSIONS

In the present study we accounted for the delay between symptom’s onset and death caused by the Covid19 disease in order to estimate its case fatality ratio in
Colombia and its regions. This estimation allows us to
calculate the total number of infected people so far in
Colombia and its regions, thus creating a clear picture of
the magnitude of the pandemic in this country. In particular, we estimate that there have been a total number of
3’661,621 infected people in Colombia, in contrast with
the confirmed 1’594,497, as of December 28, 2020. Moreover, the following are the states with the largest underreporting in Colombia: Amazonas, Magdalena, Norte de
Santander and Putumayo. Furthermore, the capital city
of Colombia, Bogotá, presents a reporting percentage
close to 48%.
A remarkable feature of the method to estimate CFRs
in Colombia and its regions was the inclusion of demographics, as Covid-19 has proven to have different mortalities for populations with different ages. Therefore, we
saw that older populations were more vulnerable than
younger ones. Indeed, our corrected CFRs have a correlation of 0.51 with the baseline CFRs, which account

for regions demographics, indicating that younger (older)
populations are expected to have lower (higher) mortalities.
Another phenomenon linked with age distributions is
that the reporting percentage is much lower in the young
population, whereas the old population presents large reporting percentage. We hypothesise that this happens
because young people usually have low to mild symptoms, and most of the time they do not require to go to
the hospital, and prefer not to take a Covid-19 test. This
behaviour is seen in every single region of Colombia.
Finally, we also compared our results to seroprevalence
studies from Colombia. Although most of those studies
have only released preliminary results, they all indicate
mortalities much lower than those reported in Europe
and the United States of America. Also, compared to
our results, the seroprevalence studies in Colombia show
lower estimates of mortality, and thus, estimate more
true cases of Covid-19 in the country than we do.

We developed a Python library that eases the extraction, load and transformation of raw data from the
INS database. The code is freely available at https:
//gitlab.com/hubrain/covid19. Also, we designed
a dashboard were we keep a daily record of how reporting percentages are changing at each region which
can be found at http://covid19.hubrain.co. Furthermore, the code to reproduce the figures and tables here presented is in https://gitlab.com/hubrain/
