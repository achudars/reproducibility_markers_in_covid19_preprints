Abstract
Since late December 2019 a new epidemic outbreak has emerged from
Whuhan, China. Rapidly the new coronavirus has spread worldwide. China
CDC has reported results of a descriptive exploratory analysis of all cases
diagnosed until the 11th February 2020, presenting the epidemiologic curves
and geo-temporal spread of COVID-19 along with case fatality rate according
to some baseline characteristics, such as age, gender and several wellestablished high prevalence comorbidities. Despite this, we intend to increase
even further the predictive value of that manuscript by presenting the odds
ratio for mortality due to COVID-19 adjusted for the presence of those
comorbidities and baseline characteristics such as age and gender. Besides,
we present a way to determine the risk of each particular patient, given his
characteristics.
We found that age is the variable that presents higher risk of COVID-19
mortality, where 60 or older patients have an OR = 18.8161 (CI95%[7.1997;
41.5517]). Regarding comorbidities, cardiovascular disease appears to be the
riskiest (OR= 12.8328 CI95%[10.2736; 15.8643], along with chronic
respiratory disease (OR=7.7925 CI95%[5.5446; 10.4319]). Males are more
likely to die from COVID-19 (OR=1.8518 (CI95%[1.5996; 2.1270]). Some
limitations such as the lack of information about the correct prevalence of
gender per age or about comorbidities per age and gender or the assumption
of independence between risk factors are expected to have a small impact on

Introduction
At the end of December of 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan has
created an alert worldwide. These cases were thought to be associated with a
seafood market, which was closed on the 1st of January 2020. At that time
there were 41 confirmed cases and one death, which occurred in a patient
with serious underlying medical conditions thus it was not clear to attribute
that death to the illness. The alert from China CDC had already been made to
the World Health Organization1-3. Potential causes for that cluster of disease,
such as influenza, adenovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV)
and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) were expunged.1,3-4 In
fact, the pathogen causing this severe illness was quickly identified as a novel
coronavirus and its genomic characterization was rapidly performed enabling
to create a suitable test method1-5. The genomic characterization showed
some relations both to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV4-6, whilst it was thought that
this new strand would be less aggressive than those two coronavirus

4-6.

Nevertheless, on the 20th of January the onset changed due to the
confirmation of human-to-human transmission 2,7-10. The first death attributed
to this novel coronavirus, named as SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 is the associated
disease), occurred on January 13, and according to the China CDC 11 the case
fatality rate (CFR) was 0.2%: 2 deaths in 1036 confirmed cases on the last
day of January 2020. Yet, 14.4% of the cases were considered severe or even
critical.

As stated on the page Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by Johns Hopkins
CSSE12 there were 79441 cases confirmed worldwide (97% on mainland
China) and the number of deaths is 2620, 95% of which have occurred in
mainland China, at 10 a.m. (Greenwich time zone) of the 24th of January. The
World Health Organization considers this outbreak a “public health emergency
of international concern”13.
The epidemiological curves of COVID-19 in China11 are thought to be of
extreme value, presenting the progression of illness in the outbreak over time
from December 8, 2019 to February 11, 2020, when there were a total of
72314 confirmed cases as the geo-temporal spread of COVID-19 presented in
figure 2 of the same paper11 to establish the epidemiological state of COVID19 in China. Moreover, the authors presented age, gender and comorbidity
case fatality rate in China in an univariate way.
Thus, our main goal is to establish the odds ratio for COVID-19 mortality,
adjusted to age and gender-specific prevalence of the morbidities reported in
the CDC paper11, namely hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
chronic respiratory disease and cancer.
The risk factors for MERS-CoV were established after analysing data collected
from the World Health organization between 2012 and 2018 14, where males
seemed to be more affected than females, and also age over 30 years-old or
the presence or comorbidities. Besides these baseline characteristics, ethnicity
also presented statistically significant odds ratios. The search performed in
Pubmed on the 21th of January 2020 using the following keywords (("odds
ratio" OR "risk ratio" OR "relative risk" OR risk)) AND (SARS-CoV OR SARS OR
MERS-CoV OR MERS OR corona OR coronavirus) and updated on the 24 th of
January 2020 produced no results for studies reporting risk factors for SARSCoV. Therefore, it is of extreme importance to briskly define the odds ratio for
mortality adjusted to comorbidities which are highly prevalent globally,
according to age and gender, in order to prevent COVID-19 specific mortality.

Material and Methods
The main goal of the present work is to compute adjusted odds ratio (OR) for
death from COVID-19 considering age intervals, gender and comorbidities as
possible risk factors. Complete data is not accessible but a thorough
description of the outbreak was made available by China CDC on the 14 th
February11. Based on these data we implemented a Monte Carlo simulation §
in the R programming language15 to create a synthetic dataset from which a
logistic regression can be computed along with ORs.
The dataset includes four variables: age, gender, comorbidities and death. All variables
are treated as qualitative and follow the same rationale expressed in the China CDC
report. Age is described by intervals of decades (0-9; 10-19; up to ≥ 80 years old) and the
comorbidities are: hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory
disease and cancer. The outcome variable, death, is dichotomous with states dead and
alive.
The

distributions, which we used to populate the dataset. However, these
distributions are described independently making it impossible to know the
exact gender frequency for each age interval. We assumed that the
distribution by gender would be similar across age intervals. To render the
gender, male or female, for each subject a random number is drawn following
a Bernoulli random experience with probability given by the gender
distribution (Figure 1).

A similar procedure is performed to attribute one comorbidity to each subject
of the dataset: a random number with five possible outcomes (four for
comorbidities and one for no disease) is drawn and the corresponding
probability is given by an adequate distribution (Figure 2).

Figure 2 - Pseudocode describing how comorbidity variable is created in the dataset. None is
0, hypertension is 1, diabetes is 2, cardiovascular is 3, respiratory is 4 and cancer is 5.

A CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file containing the comorbidity distribution
by age and gender feeds the routine. Comorbidities’ empirical prevalence can
be computed from China CDC report for all subjects, but does not allow
different values for each age interval and gender and, for that reason, we
considered that prevalence values for each comorbidity were constant across
age groups and gender. Despite this limitation, tests can be run using
worldwide prevalence for each disease. Finally, comorbidities classes were
assumed to be exclusive, i.e., no subject could have more than one
comorbidity.
After populating age, gender and comorbidities variables in the dataset, it still
misses the death variable, which highly depends on the previous items. To fill
in this variable, we used a Naïve Bayesian approach considering that age,
gender and comorbidities would be independent. Therefore, the probability,
𝑃(𝐷|𝐴, 𝐺, 𝐶), of dying given the age interval (A), the gender (G) and the
comorbidity (C) is given from
𝑃(𝐴|𝐷) 𝑃(𝐺|𝐷) 𝑃(𝐶|𝐷) 𝑃(𝐷)

𝑃(𝐷|𝐴, 𝐺, 𝐶) = 𝑃(𝐴|𝐷) 𝑃(𝐺|𝐷) 𝑃(𝐶|𝐷) 𝑃(𝐷)+𝑃(𝐴|𝐷̅) 𝑃(𝐺|𝐷̅) 𝑃(𝐶|𝐷̅) 𝑃(𝐷̅),

be computed from the China CDC report; thus, for each situation we can
calculate the probability of being dead and, therefore, to randomly draw a
value describing the status of each subject (Figure 3).

Figure 3 - Pseudocode describing how death variable is created in the dataset. Alive is 0 and
dead is 1.

Once the dataset is created, a logistic regression model is fitted taking as
dependent variable the death variable and as independent variables age,
gender and comorbidity. The values of the regression coefficients are then
transformed with an exponential function in order to obtain the adjusted OR,
which are stored. The procedure is repeated 1000 times, allowing to obtain
different datasets, each one with corresponding ORs (Figure 4). After ending
the random sampling procedure, the median is computed as well as
percentiles 2.5 and 97.5, which allows to obtain the 95% confidence interval
of ORs.

Figure 4 - Flowchart of the Monte Carlo routine employed to build synthetic datasets and
compute odds ratio.

The validation of the procedure is performed by comparing a set of probability
values that are computed both in the synthetic data and in the China CDC
report. This set of values includes the gender, death and comorbidities
probabilities as well as conditional death probabilities regarding the
comorbidities.

Results
Table 1 shows the statistics regarding the synthetic datasets and the
corresponding values from the China CDC report.
Table 1 - Relative frequencies and corresponding confidence intervals for 1000 simulated
datasets and the actual values.

Slight departures are observed in some of the frequencies (e.g. comorbidities
and CFR) but in general, the reported frequencies are within the confidence
intervals meaning that synthetic datasets are reasonably representative of the
observed data. Still, this is a limitation of the method.
Table 2 shows the adjusted odds ratio resulting from the logistic regression
model and their corresponding confidence intervals. The confidence intervals
were obtained by considering as its limits the percentiles 2.5 and 97.5 of the
OR list. At each run, only ORs that were statistically significant (p < 0.05;
except for age interval ‘40-49’ where p < 0.10 was used) were considered for
the final list, hence the actual number of iterations can differ for each OR,
which is shown in the last column (# runs) of the table.

Table 2 - Adjusted ORs for age intervals, gender and comorbidities.

Logistic models assume a reference class for each qualitative independent
variable and the ORs interpretation of the remaining classes is made relatively
to the reference. In the present case, the reference classes were: ‘0-19’ years
old, ‘female’ and ‘no comorbidities’. Therefore, the OR=1.8518 for males
means that the ratio of the odd of dying to the odd of not dying is 1.8518
times greater in males than in females. As expected ORs increase with age,
but the rate of increasing is very high. ORs for comorbidities were expected
to be greater than 1, but once again the values are somehow greater than
what one could have anticipated.
Discussion and conclusion
The objective of this work was accomplished as adjusted ORs were obtained,
which allows a direct comparison between risk factors and the assessment of
their importance for the final outcome (dying from COVID-19). Analyzing the
ORs, it can be learnt that elderly patients (above 60 years old) present the
highest risk (OR=18.8161 CI95%[7.1997; 41.5517]) to COVID-19, even

CI95%[10.2736; 15.8643], which is higher than having a chronic respiratory
disease (OR=7.7925 CI95%[5.5446; 10.4319]), but without statistical
significance since the confidence intervals overlap. In what concerns gender,
males are at risk with OR=1.8518 (CI95%[1.5996; 2.1270]).
To have a point of comparison, patients aged more than 30 years old and
affected by MERS-CoV presented OR=2.38 (CI95%[1.75; 3.22])14. And MERSCoV patients with comorbidities had OR=1.76 (CI95%[1.39; 2.22])14.
The approach adopted in this work has several limitations that must be
referred to put into perspective the results. The first aspect, is that case
fatality rate (CFR) is a feeble measure as it highly depends on the correct
number of diagnosed cases and also on the final outcome of the current cases.
Since this is an in-progress situation, CFR value is naturally uncertain, which
undermines all parameters computed from this value, and naturally, the
results obtained herein suffer from this fact.
Regarding the CFR value, another question that arose was that the China CDC
report enables two ways to compute it. All the observations may be used
(1023 deaths in 44672 confirmed cases) or the ones with comorbidities
information may be used instead (504 deaths in 20812 confirmed cases). We
opted for the latter.
Another aspect is the fact that there is neither information about the correct
prevalence of gender per age nor about comorbidities per age and gender. To
overcome this issue, we assumed homogeneous prevalence, which will
increase ORs in some classes while decreasing in others. This approximation
has a non-linear impact difficult to foresee, albeit departures from the real

case are expected to be small. Moreover, the R routine is prepared to work
with complete prevalence information and any user can test it.
We have also assumed independence between risk factors but the logistic
regression assumes the same. Therefore, the impact is not expected to be
significant.
Concerning the ability to fit a suitable logistic model, we observed that in some
cases the model did not present high values for goodness-of-fit tests (data
not shown) and some risk factors did not reach statistical significance. We
discarded the OR values in these cases, which reduced the number of runs (‘#
runs’ column in table 2) for some risk factors. Consequently, the confidence
in those values is smaller.
Finally, we ran a simulation as a means to estimate actual values, since the
available data is aggregated in groups. The comparison suggests that the
differences between simulated and reported data are acceptable. The
simulation included several runs intended to surpass this limitation.
Confidence intervals were a way of showing the uncertainty associated with
the method.
A final point of utmost importance: Equation 1 can be used to determine the
probability of dying from COVID-19 given the age interval, the gender and
comorbidity of a particular patient. The objective and quantitative risk
measurement of each patient or population is paramount to help managing
patients segments in health facilities as well as to assist in the determination
of public health policies.
