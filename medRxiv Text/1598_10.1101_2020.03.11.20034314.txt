Abstract
We model the COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic in China. We use early reported case data to
predict the cumulative number of reported cases to a final size. The key features of our model are
the timing of implementation of major public policies restricting social movement, the identification
and isolation of unreported cases, and the impact of asymptomatic infectious cases.

Keywords: corona virus, reported and unreported cases, isolation, quarantine, public closings; epidemic

Introduction

Many mathematical models of the COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic in China have been developed,
and some of these are listed in our references [4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. We develop here a
model describing this epidemic, focused on the effects of the Chinese government imposed public policies
designed to contain this epidemic, and the number of reported and unreported cases that have occurred.
Our model here is based on our model of this epidemic in [5], which was focused on the early phase of
this epidemic (January 20 through January 29) in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the early outbreak.
During this early phase, the cumulative number of daily reported cases grew exponentially. In [5], we
identified a constant transmission rate corresponding to this exponential growth rate of the cumulative
reported cases, during this early phase in Wuhan.
On January 23, 2020, the Chinese government imposed major public restrictions on the population
of Wuhan. Soon after, the epidemic in Wuhan passed beyond the early exponential growth phase, to a
phase with slowing growth. In this work, we assume that these major government measures caused the
transmission rate to change from a constant rate to a time dependent exponentially decreasing rate. We
identify this exponentially decreasing transmission rate based on reported case data after January 29.
We then extend our model of the epidemic to the central region of China, where most cases occurred.
Within just a few days after January 29, our model can be used to project the time-line of the model
forward in time, with increasing accuracy, to a final size.

Model
The model consists of the following system of ordinary differential equations:
 0
S (t) = −τ (t)S(t)[I(t) + U (t)],



I 0 (t) = τ (t)S(t)[I(t) + U (t)] − νI(t),

R0 (t) = ν1 I(t) − ηR(t),


 0
U (t) = ν2 I(t) − ηU (t).

(2.1)

This system is supplemented by initial data
S(t0 ) = S0 > 0, I(t0 ) = I0 > 0, R(t0 ) = 0 and U (t0 ) = U0 ≥ 0.

(2.2)

Here t ≥ t0 is time in days, t0 is the beginning date of the model of the epidemic, S(t) is the number of
individuals susceptible to infection at time t, I(t) is the number of asymptomatic infectious individuals
at time t, R(t) is the number of reported symptomatic infectious individuals at time t, and U (t) is the
number of unreported symptomatic infectious individuals at time t.
Asymptomatic infectious individuals I(t) are infectious for an average period of 1/ν days. Reported
symptomatic individuals R(t) are infectious for an average period of 1/η days, as are unreported symptomatic individuals U (t). We assume that reported symptomatic infectious individuals R(t) are reported
and isolated immediately, and cause no further infections. The asymptomatic individuals I(t) can also
be viewed as having a low-level symptomatic state. All infections are acquired from either I(t) or U (t)
individuals.
The parameters of the model are listed in Table 1 and a schematic diagram of the model is given in
Figure 1.

Data

We use cumulative reported data from the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of
China and the Chinese CDC for mainland China. Before February 11, the data was based on confirmed
testing. From February 11 to February 15, the data included cases that were not tested for the virus,
but were clinically diagnosed based on medical imaging showing signs of pneumonia. There were 17,409
such cases from February 10 to February 15. The data from February 10 to February 15 specified both
types of reported cases. From February 16, the data did not separate the two types of reporting, but
reported the sum of both types. We subtracted 17,409 cases from the cumulative reported cases after
February 15 to obtain the cumulative reported cases based only on confirmed testing after February 15.
The data is given in Table 2 with this adjustment.

Model parameters

We assume f = 0.8, which means that 20% of symptomatic infectious cases go unreported. We
assume η = 1/7, which means that the average period of infectiousness of both unreported symptomatic
infectious individuals and reported symptomatic infectious individuals is 7 days. We assume ν = 1/7,

which means that the average period of infectiousness of asymptomatic infectious individuals is 7 days.
These values can be modified as further epidemiological information becomes known.
A illustrated in our previous work [5], we assume that in the early phase of the epidemic, the cumulative number of reported cases grow approximately exponentially, according to the formula:
CR(t) = χ1 exp(χ2 t) − χ3 , t ≥ t0
with values χ1 = 0.15, χ2 = 0.38, χ3 = 1.0. These values of χ1 , χ2 , and χ3 are fitted to reported case
data from January 19 to January 28. We assumed the initial value S0 = 11, 000, 000, the population
of the city Wuhan, which was the epicenter of the epidemic outbreak where almost all cases in China
occurred in this time period. The other initial conditions are

These parameter formulas were derived in [5].
After January 23, strong government measures in all of China, such as isolation, quarantine, and
public closings, strongly impacted the transmission of new cases. The actual effects of these measures were
complex, and we use an exponential decrease for the transmission rate τ (t) to incorporate these effects
after the early exponentially increasing phase. The formula for τ (t) during the exponential decreasing
phase was derived by a fitting procedure. The formula for τ (t) is
(
τ (t) = τ0 , 0 ≤ t ≤ N,
(4.1)
τ (t) = τ0 exp (−µ (t − N )) , N < t,
The date N and the value of µ are chosen so that the cumulative reported cases in the numerical
simulation of the epidemic aligns with the cumulative reported case data during a period of time after
January 19. We choose N = 25 (January 25) for our simulations. We illustrate τ (t) in Figure 3, with
µ = 0.16. In this way we are able to project forward the time-path of the epidemic after the government
imposed public restrictions, as it unfolds.

Model simulation

We assume that exponentially increasing phase of the epidemic (as incorporated in τ0 ) is intrinsic
to the population of any subregion of China, after it is has been established in the epidemic epicenter
Wuhan. We also assume that the susceptible population S(t) in not significantly reduced over the course
of the epidemic. We set τ0 = 4.51 × 10−8 , t0 = 5.0, I(t0 ) = 3.3, U (t0 ) = 0.18, and R(t0 ) = 1.0, as in
Section 4. We set S(t0 ) in (2.2) to 1, 400, 050, 000 (the population of mainland China). We set τ (t) in
(2.1) to
(
τ (t) = τ0 S0 / 1, 400, 050, 000, 0 ≤ t ≤ 25,
(5.1)
τ (t) = τ0 S0 /1, 400, 050, 000 exp (−µ (t − 25)) , 25 < t,
where S0 = 11, 000, 000 (the population of Wuhan). We thus assume that the government imposed
restriction measures became effective in reducing transmission on January 25.
In Figure 4, we plot the graphs of CR(t), CU (t), R(t), and U (t) from the numerical simulation for
simulations based on six time intervals for known values of the cumulative reported case data. For each
of these time intervals, a value of µ is chosen so that the simulation for that time interval aligns with
the cumulative reported case data in that interval. In this way, we are able to predict the future values
of the epidemic from early cumulative reported case data.

Our model transmission rate τ (t) can be modified to illustrate the effects of an earlier or later implementation of the major public policy interventions that occurred in this epidemic. The implementation
one week earlier (25 is replaced by 18 in (4.1)) is graphed in Figure 6A. All other parameters and the
initial conditions remain the same. The total reported cases is approximately 4, 500 and the total unreported cases is approximately 1, 100. The implementation one week later (25 is replaced by 32 in (4.1))
is graphed in Figure 6B. The total reported cases is approximately 820, 000 and the total unreported
cases is approximately 200, 000. The timing of the institution of major social restrictions is critically
important in mitigating the epidemic.

The number of unreported cases is of major importance in understanding the evolution of an epidemic,
and involves great difficulty in their estimation. The data from January 19 to February 15 for reported
cases in Table 2, was only for confirmed tested cases. Between February 11 and February 15, additional
clinically diagnosed case data, based on medical imaging showing signs of pneumonia, was also reported
by the Chinese CDC. Since February 16, only tested case data has been reported by the Chinese CDC,
because new NHC guidelines removed the clinically diagnosed category. Thus, after February 15, there
is a gap in the reported case data that we used up to February 15. The uncertainty of the number
of unreported cases for this epidemic includes this gap, but goes even further to include additional
unreported cases.

We assumed previously that the fraction f of reported cases was f = 0.8 and the fraction of unreported
cases was 1 − f = 0.2. Our model formulation can be applied with varying values for the fraction f .
In Figure 7, we provide illustrations with the fraction f = 0.4 (Figure 7A) and f = 0.6 (Figure 7B).
For f = 0.4, the formula for the time dependent transmission rate τ (t) in (4.1) involves new values for
τ0 = 4.08 × 10−8 and µ = 0.148. The initial conditions I0 = 6.65 and U0 = 1.09 also have new values.
The other parameters and initial conditions remain the same. For f = 0.4, the total reported cases is
approximately 63, 100 and the total unreported cases is approximately 94, 700. For f = 0.6, the formula
for the time dependent transmission rate τ (t) in (4.1) involves new values for τ0 = 4.28 × 10−8 and
µ = 0.144. The initial conditions I0 = 4.43 and U0 = 0.485 also have new values. The other parameters
and initial conditions remain the same. For f = 0.6, the total reported cases is approximately 63, 300
and the total unreported cases is approximately 42, 200. From these simulations, we see that estimation
of the number of unreported cases has major importance in understanding the severity of this epidemic.

The number of days an asymptomatic infected individual is infectious is uncertain. We simulate in
Figure 8 the model with ν = 1/3 (asymptomatic infected individuals are infectious on average 3 days
before becoming symptomatic), and ν = 1/5 (asymptomatic infected individuals are infectious on average
5 days before becoming symptomatic). For ν = 1/3, τ0 = 5.75 × 10−8 , I0 = 1.48, U0 = 0.18, R0 = 2.78,
µ = 0.0765, N = 24. For ν = 1/5, τ0 = 4.90 × 10−8 , I0 = 2.38, U0 = 0.18, R0 = 3.45, µ = 0.098,
N = 24. Because the asymptomatic infectious periods are shorter, The date N of the effective reduction
of the transmission rate due to restriction measures, is one day earlier.

Table 2. A: ν = 1/3. B: ν = 1/5. The turning point is approximately day 40 = February 9 for both
cases. The final sizes of CR(t) and CU (t) are approximately the same as for ν = 1/7 in both cases.
In Figure 9, we illustrate the importance of the level of government imposed public restrictions by
altering the value of µ in formula (4.1). All other parameters and initial conditions are the same as in
Figure 4. In Figure 9A we set µ = 0.0, corresponding to no restrictions. The final size of cumulative
reported cases after 100 days is approximately 1,080,000,000 cases, approximately 270,000,000 unreported
cases, and approximately 1,350,000,000 total cases. The turning point is approximately day 65 = March

final size of cumulative reported cases after 70 days is approximately 45,300 cases, approximately 11,300
unreported cases, and approximately 56,600 total cases. The turning point is approximately day 38 =
February 7. The level and timing of government restrictions on social distancing is very important in
controlling the epidemic.

Discussion

We have developed a model of the COVID-19 epidemic in China that incorporates key features
of this epidemic: (1) the importance of the timing and magnitude of the implementation of major
government public restrictions designed to mitigate the severity of the epidemic; (2) the importance of
both reported and unreported cases in interpreting the number of reported cases; and (3) the importance
of asymptomatic infectious cases in the disease transmission. In our model formulation, we divide
infectious individuals into asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals. The symptomatic
infectious phase is also divided into reported and unreported cases. Our model formulation is based

on our work [5], in which we developed a method to estimate epidemic parameters at an early stage
of an epidemic, when the number of cumulative cases grows exponentially. The general method in [5],
was applied to the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China, to identify the constant transmission rate
corresponding to the early exponential growth phase.
In this work, we use the constant transmission rate in the early exponential growth phase of the
COVID-19 epidemic identified in [5]. We model the effects of the major government imposed public
restrictions in China, beginning on January 23, as a time-dependent exponentially decaying transmission
rate after January 24. With this time dependent exponentially decreasing transmission rate, we are able
to fit with increasing accuracy, our model simulations to the Chinese CDC reported case data for all of
China, forward in time from February 15, 2020.
Our model demonstrates the effects of implementing major government public policy measures. By
varying the date of the implementation of these measures in our model, we show that had implementation
occurred one week earlier, then a significant reduction in the total number of cases would have resulted.
We show that if these measures had occurred one week later, then a significant increase in the total
number of cases would have occurred. We also show that if these measures had been less restrictive on
public movement, then a significant increase in the total size of the epidemic would have occurred. It is
evident, that control of a COVID-19 epidemic is very dependent on an early implementation and a high
level of restrictions on public functions.
We varied the fraction 1 − f of unreported cases involved in the transmission dynamics. We showed
that if this fraction is higher, then a significant increase in the number of total cases results. If it is
lower, then a significant reduction occurs. It is evident, that control of a COVID-19 epidemic is very
dependent on identifying and isolating symptomatic unreported infectious cases. We also decreased the
parameter ν (the reciprocal of the average period of asymptomatic infectiousness), and showed that the
total number of cases in smaller. It is also possible to decrease η (the reciprocal of the average period of
unreported symptomatic infectiousness), to obtain a similar result. It is evident that understanding of
these periods of infectiousness is important in understanding the total number of epidemic cases.
Our model was specified to the COVID-19 outbreak in China, but it is applicable to any outbreak
location for a COVID-19 epidemic.
