Our goal is to inform ongoing public health policy on the design and communication of
COVID-19 social distancing measures to maximize compliance. We assessed the US public’s
early experience with the COVID-19 crisis during the period when shelter-in-place orders were
widely implemented to understand non-compliance with those orders, sentiment about the
crisis, and to compare across age categories associated with different levels of risk. We posted
our survey on Twitter, Facebook, and NextDoor on March 14​th​to March 23​rd​that included 21
questions including demographics, impact on daily life, actions taken, and difficulties faced.1 We
analyzed the free-text responses to the impact question using LIWC, a computational natural
language processing tool2, and performed a thematic content analysis of the reasons people
gave for non-compliance with social distancing orders. Stanford University’s IRB approved the
study.
In 9 days, we collected a total of 20,734 responses. 6,573 individuals provided a
response (≥30 words) to the question, “Tell us how the coronavirus crisis is impacting your life.”
Our data (Figure 1) show that younger people (18-31) are more emotionally negative,
self-centered, and less concerned with family, while middle-aged people are group-oriented
(32-44) and focused on family (32-64) (all ​p​ values < .05 corrected for multiple comparisons).
Unsurprisingly, the oldest and most at-risk group (65+) are more focused on biological terms
(e.g., health-related topics), but were surprisingly low in anxiety and high in emotionally positive
terms relative to those at lower risk.
We also content-analyzed 7,355 responses (​kappa’s ​> .75) to the question, “What are
the reasons you are not self-isolating more?” Of these participants, 39.8% reported not being
compliant, with the youngest group (18-31) having the lowest compliance rate (52.4%)
compared to the other age groups (all > 60%; all ​p ​values < .01). Table 1 describes the seven

primary themes for non-compliance. Non-essential work requirements, concerns about mental
and physical health, and the belief that other precautions were sufficient were the most common
reasons, although other rationales included wanting to continue everyday activities and beliefs
that society is over-reacting. Childcare was an important concern for a subset of respondents.
Overall, our findings suggest that public health messages should focus on young people
and 1) address their negative affect, 2) refocus their self-orientation by emphasizing the
importance of individual behavior to group-level health outcomes, and 3) target the specific
rationales that different people have regarding the pandemic to maximize compliance with social
distancing.
