Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by a novel severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 infection of host cells occurs
predominantly via binding of the viral surface spike protein to the human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.1 Hypertension and pre-existing cardiovascular disease
are risk factors for morbidity from COVID-19,2 and it remains uncertain whether the use of
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB)
impacts infection and disease. Here, we aim to shed light on this question by assessing ACE2
expression in normal and diseased human myocardial samples profiled by bulk and single
nucleus RNA-seq.
The predominant portal of entry for SARS-CoV-2 is via ACE2 expression in the upper respiratory
epithelium and lungs,3 yet ACE2 is also abundantly expressed in the intestine, kidney, heart and
testes. The observation that twenty percent of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan,
China had evidence cardiac injury resuggest a possible pathological role for myocardial ACE2
expression.4 In a single-center report of 416 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 19.7% had
evidence of cardiac injury. Moreover, the presence of cardiac injury was associated with a 5fold increase in mechanical ventilation and a 51.2% mortality rate. In this context, the potential
for a primary viral myocarditis with SARS-CoV-2 is gaining support. Prior findings of viral RNA
from SARS-CoV-1, which also infects cells via ACE2, in 35% of autopsied hearts during an earlier
SARS-CoV epidemic, lends credence to this possibility.5
Involvement of ACE2 in COVID-19 pathogenesis has led to consideration of whether inhibitors
of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) might
modulate disease progression through increased expression of ACE2.6 Indeed, trials proposing
to test the impact of both initiation (NCT04312009) and withdrawal of these agents are being
advanced during the current pandemic. This uncertainty has provoked public statements by
three leading cardiovascular societies advising continuation of these agents in the absence of
compelling new data.7
To address these questions, we assessed ACE2 expression in normal and diseased human
myocardial samples from the Penn Human Heart Tissue Biobank by bulk and single nucleus
RNA-seq. Our group has previously utilized this approach to study the transcriptional diversity
of the cell subtypes and associated gene programs in the normal human heart.8
ACE2 expression was assessed in the left ventricles of 11 individuals with dilated
cardiomyopathy (DCM), 15 individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and 16 nonfailing controls defined as individuals without any overt indication of cardiac dysfunction. The
baseline characteristics for the study population are provided in Supplementary Table 1. In an
exploratory analysis, the effects of ACEi treatment on ACE2 expression were evaluated in the
subset of patients with HCM, in which six individuals were receiving ACEi and eight that were
not prescribed an ACEi.

ACE2 expression in the heart is strongest in pericytes, which line the microvasculature, but is
also appreciable in vascular smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1a). We
also evaluated the expression of the proteases encoded by TMPRSS2 and CTSL, which facilitate
membrane fusion and viral uptake during SARS-CoV-2 infection.1,9 TMPRSS2 was minimally
expressed across all cell types, while CTSL displayed low levels of expression in all cell types
with strongest expression in fibroblasts (18.1% and 56.7% of cells in the two populations found
in non-failing controls), macrophages (39.1%), adipocytes (41.5%), and cardiomyocytes (11.4%)
(Supplementary Fig. 1). These results are in concordance with recently released single nuclei
data from Chen et al.10
Analyses of previously generated bulk RNA-seq data from these individuals show no significant
alterations in ACE2 expression in the context of dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
compared to non-failing controls (Fig. 1b). However, single nucleus RNA-seq highlighted a stark
downregulation of ACE2 expression in fibroblasts, pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle. There
was a concomitant upregulation in ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes in DCM and HCM (Fig.
1c). The complete cell subtype differential expression analysis of ACE2 in DCM and HCM
compared to non-failing controls is provided in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3, respectively. A
sensitivity analysis comparing the expression of ACE2 in left ventricles samples from individuals
with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy compared to non-failing controls after exclusion of
individuals on ACE inhibitors or ARBs is provided in Supplementary Table 4.
Since patients with DCM were on an ACEi and nonfailing controls were not on an ACEi, our
ability to examine effects of ACEi use on ACE2 expression was limited to the the patients with
HCM. Among these patients, there was a trend towards increased ACE2 expression with ACEi
treatment in all cell types (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 5), but these results were not
statistically significant. Future studies with larger patient cohorts to examine cell type specific
ACE2 expression in additional disease states and in nonfailing donors receiving an ACEi or ARB
are urgently needed. Further, it is important to note that transcriptional assessments do not
reflect the effects of RNA half-life, translation efficiency, or protein turnover. As such, it will be
important that surface localized ACE2 protein is also evaluated in future studies.
In conclusion, these data suggest that prior cardiovascular disease is a predominant driver of
cardiomyocyte-specific increased transcription of ACE2. These findings may provide a
pathological link for SARS-CoV-associated viral myocarditis.
