Abstract

Rationale: In late December 2019, an outbreak of acute respiratory illness, now officially
named as COVID-19, or coronavirus disease 2019, emerged in Wuhan, China, now
spreading across the whole country and world. More data were needed to understand the
clinical characteristics of the disease.

Objectives: To study the epidemiology, clinical features and outcomes of patients with
COVID-19.

Methods: we performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 221 patients
with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at a university hospital.

Measurements and Main Results: The median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were
male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market.
Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients
was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities. Most
common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea. On
admission, 33.0% patients showed leukopenia and 73.8% showed lymphopenia. In
addition, the severe patients suffered a higher rate of co-infections with bacteria or fungus
and they were more likely to developing complications. As of February 15, 2020, 19.0%
patients had been discharged and 5.4% patients died. 80% of severe cases received ICU
care, and 52.3% of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and
the mortality rate of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%.

Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission.
Patients with elder age, chronic comorbidities, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count,
procalcitonin level, co-infection and severe complications might increase the risk of poor
clinical outcomes.

Introduction
In late December 2019, an outbreak of acute respiratory illness, now officially named as
the COVID-19, or coronavirus disease 2019, emerged in Wuhan, China.

1 2

From

bronchoalveolar lavage samples of the infected patients, a novel beta-coronavirus (SARSCoV-2) was isolated and identified as the causative agent.

3

Current studies have

demonstrated that the COVID-19 shares over 88% homology with two bat-derived severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and batSLCoVZC21, and that bats may be the most likely natural host.

4

However, whether the

SARS-CoV-2 transmits directly from bats or through an intermediate host is still uncertain.
Although epidemiological studies indicate a common link between the initially diagnosed
patients and the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan,

5

an increasing number of later

confirmed cases have involved infected patients without history of contacting the
implicated market, nor traveling to Wuhan, 6 and the family cluster type of infections were
reported. 7 8 Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed, 6 and respiratory droplet
and contact are the main transmission routes, while recent reports also suggested the
existence of the fecal-oral transmission route. 6 9
Based on a recent large-scale epidemiological survey, the latency period of the SARSCoV-2 may extend up to 24 days, even though the proportion of patients with long
incubation period is very small, but the medium incubation period remains short at 3 days.
6

Reported illnesses have ranged from patients with little or no symptoms to patients being

severely ill and dying. 6 The main clinical manifestations include fever, cough, fatigue, and
dyspnea.

5 10 11

Compared to young and middle-aged patients with COVID-19, elder

infected patients with chronic comorbidities have an increased risk of developing organ
dysfunctions, including shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac

injury and acute kidney injury, resulting in a higher mortality rate. 10 11 However, the clinical
features between severe and non-severe cases have not yet been well described. Unlike
SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 displays a highly contagious infectiousness even during the
asymptomatic period

12

. At present, there is no effective medication nor vaccine for the

SARS-CoV-2 infection. As of February 22, 2020, the National Health Commission of
China has reported a total of 76,936 confirmed, 4,148 suspected cases and 2442 deaths
in 31 provinces across the country.

13

In addition, more than 2700 confirmed cases have

also been reported abroad in 26 different countries.14
In this study, we have performed a comprehensive exploration of the epidemiological,
clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of 221 hospitalized patients with
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, including 55 severe patients and 166 non-severe
patients of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from January 2 to
February 10, 2020.

Methods

Patients
For this retrospective, single-center study, we recruited 221 patients who were confirmed
diagnosed as COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance, from January 2 to February
10, 2020 at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. This study was
approved by the National Health Commission of China and Ethics Commission of
Zhongnan Hospital. Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission for
emerging infectious disease.

Procedures
221 patients were confirmed to be infected with COVID-19. The presence of SARS-CoV2 in pharyngeal swab specimens was detected by real-time RT-PCR using ORF1ab/N
gene PCR kit (Biogerm, Cat# SJ-HX-226-1,2, Shanghai, China) according to the protocol
described previously.

11

The diagnostic criteria for RT-PCR results were based on the

recommendation by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (China)
(http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/kyjz/202001/t20200121_211337.html). Confirmed cases were
treated with effective isolation and protective conditions, and severe and critical cases
were admitted to the Emergency Department or ICU wards.
All patients were monitored for vital signs (body temperature, heart rate, pulse oxygen
saturation, respiratory rate and blood pressure). Initial investigations included a complete
blood count, coagulation profile, and serum biochemical test (including liver and renal
function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and electrolytes). All patients were
monitored by chest x-rays or CT. Respiratory specimens, including pharyngeal swabs,
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum or bronchial aspirates were tested for other
respiratory viruses including influenza A virus (H1N1, H7N9), influenza B virus, respiratory
syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and other atypical pathogens such as
mycoplasma, chlamydia and legionella pneumophila, which were also examined with realtime RT-PCR. Routine bacterial and fungal examinations were also performed by
conventional microbial culture techniques.
Treatment strategies included: (1) effective oxygen therapy according to the severity of
hypoxemia (nasal catheter/mask oxygen inhalation, high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and
non-invasive ventilation (NIV)), (2) supportive treatment to ensure sufficient energy intake
and balance for electrolytes and acid-base levels, (3) antiviral treatment (including

(moxifloxacin hydrochloride; piperacillin sodium tazobactam sodium; cefoperazone
sulbactam et al.), (5) intravenous corticosteroid therapy is optional and based on the
clinical experiences of the doctors, (6) continuous renal replacement therapy if acute renal
impairment or failure occurs. Invasive mechanical ventilation was given to patients with
hypoxic respiratory failure

and

acute

respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support was used for the patients with
refractory hypoxemia that is difficult to be corrected by prone and protective lung
ventilation strategy.
Nucleic acid tests for SARS-CoV-2 were repeated twice and shown virus clearance before
patients discharge or discontinuation of quarantine.

Data collection
We reviewed clinical charts, nursing records, laboratory findings and chest radiography
for all patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. The data of epidemiological,
clinical, laboratory, and radiological features, treatment and outcomes were obtained from
standardized data collection forms and electronic medical records. For critically ill patients
admitted to the ICU, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Sequential (sepsis-related) Organ
Failure Assessment (SOFA), and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II
(APACHE II) scores were monitored on the day of ICU admission. Two researchers
independently reviewed the data to double check the correct of collected data. For the
data which were not available for electronic medical records, the researchers directly
communicated with patients and doctors to ascertain the data integrity. The clinical

outcomes (i.e. discharges, mortality, hospitalization) were followed up to February 15,
2020.

Definitions
The diagnostic criteria of ARDS were based on the 2012 Berlin definition.

15

Shock were

defined according to the interim guidance of WHO for novel coronavirus-China.
Hypoxemia was defined as partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO₂) over inspiratory oxygen
fraction (FiO₂) of less than 300 mmHg. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was identified and
classified by the highest serum creatinine level or urine output criteria according to the
kidney disease improving global outcomes classification. Cardiac injury was diagnosed if
serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (i.e. hypersensitive troponin I) were above the 99th
percentile upper reference limit, or newly onset abnormalities shown in electrocardiogram
or cardiac ultrasound. The severe or critical COVID-19 patients were defined according to
the following criteria: fever plus one of these conditions, including respiratory rate ≥ 30
breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, SpO2 ≤ 93% on room air, occurrence of
respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock and other organ failure. 8

Statistical analysis
All the continuous variables were determined the normality of the distribution by
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the normally distributed variables were described as the means
± standard deviation (SD) and the skewed distributed variables were expressed as the
median and interquartile range (IQR). We compared the normally distributed continuous
variables by using the Student t-test and skewed distributed variables by using the MannWhitney U test. Comparisons of categorical variables between groups were conducted

Results

Epidemiological and Clinical characteristics
The study population included a total of 221 admitted patients with confirmed COVID-19
infection in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, between January 2, 2019 and
February 10, 2020. The median age was 55.0 years (IQR, 39.0-66.5; range, 20-96 years),
and 108 of 221 (48.9%) were male. The numbers of patients with COVID-19 below the
age of 45 years, between 45-65 years and above 65 years were 73 (33.0%), 86 (38.9%)
and 62 (28.1%), respectively. Of these patients, 55 (24.9%) were severe patients and 166
(75.1%) patients were non-severe (Table 1). Of the whole study population, only 8 (3.6%)
patients with COVID-19 had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market, and 19
(8.6%) patients suffered a secondary infection during hospitalization (Table 1).

In total, 78 (35.3%) patients had 1 or more chronic comorbidities, including hypertension
(54 [24.4%]), diabetes (22 [10.0%]), cardiovascular disease (22 [10.0%]), cerebrovascular
disease (15 [6.8%]), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (6 [2.7%]), chronic
kidney disease (CKD) (6 [2.7%]), chronic liver disease (7 [3.2%]), malignancy (9 [4.1%])
and patients with immunosuppression treatment (3 [1.4%]) (Table 1).
The symptom onset date of the first patient identified was Dec 25, 2019. The most
common symptoms were fever (200 [90.5%]), followed by fatigue (156 [70.6%]), cough
(136 [61.5%]), anorexia (80 [36.2%]) and dyspnea (64 [29.0%]). Less common symptoms
included diarrhea (25 [11.3%]), pharynglagia (22 [10.0%]), headache (17 [7.7%]) and
abdominal pain (5 [2.3%]). The median duration from onset of symptoms to hospital
admission was 7.0 days (IQR, 4.0-10.0), to dyspnea was 8.0 days (IQR, 4.0-11.0), and to
ICU admission was 10.0 days (IQR, 7.0-13.0) (Table 1 and 3).
Compared to the non-severe patients (n = 166), the median age of the severe patients
was significantly older (62.0 years [IQR, 52.0-74.0] vs 51.0 years [IQR, 36.0-64.3]; P <
0.001). 35 (63.6%) of the severe patients were male, and 93 (56.0%) of the non-severe
patients were female. The severe patients were also more likely to have underlying
comorbidities (40 [72.7%] vs 38 [22.9%]; P < 0.001), including hypertension (26 [47.3%]
vs 28 [16.9%]; P < 0.001), cardiovascular disease (13 [23.6%] vs 9 [5.4%]; P < 0.001) and
cerebrovascular disease (11 [20.0%] vs 4 [2.4%]; P < 0.001) (Table 1). A higher proportion
of severe patients developed symptoms such as high fever (body temperature above 38.1
ºC, 49 [89.1%] vs 94 [56.6%]; P < 0.001), anorexia (34 [61.8%] vs 46 [27.7%]; P < 0.001)
and dyspnea (35 [63.6%] vs 29 [17.5%]; P < 0.001) (Table 1). Vital signs including heart
rate (88 [80-107] vs 80 [74-90]; P < 0.01) and respiratory rate (21 [20-26] vs 20 [19-20]; P

< 0.001) were also significantly increased in severe patients compared to non-severe
patients (Table 1).

Laboratory findings in severe and non-severe patients
On admission, the blood counts of 73 (33.0%) of the 221 patients showed leukopenia
(white blood cell count < 3.5×109/L) and 163 (73.8%) showed lymphopenia (lymphocyte
count < 1.1×109/L). There were numerous laboratory parameters were significantly
increased in severe patients (Table 2), including the white blood cell and neutrophil, the
prothrombin time, levels of D-dimer, hypersensitive troponin I, creatine kinase, creatine
kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST),
total bilirubin, serum creatinine as well as procalcitonin (Table 2, P < 0.001). Additionally,
the lymphocyte count was significantly decreased in severe patients compared to the nonsevere patients (Table 2, P < 0.001)). Of the 221 patients with COVID-19, a total of 215
(97.3%) showed bilateral and the rest (6, [2.7%]) showed unilateral chest radiographs
abnormalities, characterized by multiple patchy, ground-grass opacities and multiple lobes
of consolidation (the 1st and 2nd chest CT in Figure 1A) or honeycomb-like thickening of
the interlobular septa and sub-segmental areas of consolidation (the 1st and 2nd chest CT
in Figure 1B). Pathogenic analyses show that the severe patients suffered a significantly
higher rate of co-infections with bacteria (14 [25.5%] vs 3 [1.8%]; P < 0.001) and fungus
(6 [10.9%] vs 1 [0.6%]; P = 0.001) compared to the non-severe patients (Table 2).
Of the 55 severe COVID-19 patients, 44 (80%) of them were admitted to the ICU due to
combined moderate or severe ARDS, requiring non-invasive or invasive mechanical
ventilation therapy. The median time from onset of symptoms to ICU admission was
10.0 days (IQR, 7-13) (Table 3). On the day of ICU admission, the median GCS,

APACHE II, and SOFA scores were 15 (IQR, 11-15), 17 (IQR, 12-22) and 5 (IQR, 4-8),
respectively (Table 3), indicating critical illness. The median PaO2 level of patients in
ICU was 66 mm/Hg (IQR, 53-87) and the median of P/F (PaO2 to FiO2) ratio was 113
mm/Hg (IQR, 84-190).

Complications, Treatment and Prognosis
Common complications among the total 221 subjects included ARDS, arrhythmia, acute
cardiac injury, acute kidney injury (AKI) and shock. Compared to non-severe patients, the
percentages of severe patients with complications were significantly increased, including
ARDS (48 [87.3%] vs 0; P < 0.001), arrhythmia (22 [40.0%] vs 2 [1.2%]; P < 0.001), acute
cardiac injury (16 [29.1%] vs 1 [0.6%]; P < 0.001), shock (15 [27.3%]) vs 0; P < 0.001) and
AKI (8 [14.5%] vs 2 [1.2%]; P < 0.001) (Table 4).
Most patients (196 [88.7%]) received antiviral therapy, and a total of 64 (49.6%) patients
were given glucocorticoid treatment. The severe patients receiving antiviral therapy (50
[90.0%] vs 146 [88.0%]; P < 0.001) and glucocorticoid treatment (40(72.7%) vs 75 [45.2%];
P < 0.001) were significantly higher than those of the non-severe patients (Table 4).
Among all the severe patients, 25 of patients (45.5%) received non-invasive ventilation
(NIV) and 26 patients (47.3%) received IMV, which were significantly higher than those of
non-severe patients, respectively (45.5% vs 1.2% and 47.3% vs 0; P < 0.001) (Table 4).
In addition, 48 (87.3%) of severe patients developed ARDS, and 10 (18.2%) of them were
treated with IMV plus ECMO support and 2 AKI patients underwent CRRT. Of 10 severe
patients receiving IMV+ECMO support, 2 patients had clinical benefits and had been
discharged and 3 of them were non-survivors. The rest 5 patients were still under

treatment at the time of data collection. Figure 1A represents the chest CT was
significantly improved after receiving IMV+ECMO support.
We also analyzed the outcome of the 44 severe patients in the ICU (Table 5). Of these
patients, 23 of them (52.3%) were symptomatic relief and transferred to the general wards,
while 9 of them (20.5%) were dead, and the rest of the patients were still under treatment.
The patients with higher scores of APACHE II, SOFA and increased levels of PCT,
showed a worse prognosis (Table 5). The elder and male patients had an increased
mortality rate. The dose and duration of intravenous glucocorticoid treatment showed no
difference in outcomes of symptomatic relief and death (Table 5). Intriguingly, the patients
in the death group received a significantly enlarged volume of the fluid balance per day
(483 [IQR, 333~717] vs 60 [IQR, -164~133]; P < 0.001), and cumulative fluid volume in
total (4800 [IQR, 2500-8996] vs 270 [IQR, -1150~1200]; P < 0.001), compared to the
patients in the ICU-to-Ward transfer group.
As of Feb 15, 2020, a total of 42 (19.0%) patients had been discharged and 12 (5.4%)
patients had died, and 168 (76.0%) patients were still hospitalized. Of the 55 severe
patients, 37 (67.3%) were still hospitalized, and 7 (12.7%) had been discharged and 12
(21.8%) were dead. The mortality rate was significantly higher in the severe patients
compared to that in the non-severe patients (12 [21.8%] vs 0 [0.0%]; P < 0.001, Table 4).

Discussion
This retrospective, single-center study included a total of 221 SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia
cases from Jan 2 to Feb 10, 2020. Only 8 (3.6%) of patients had a history of exposure to
the Huanan Seafood Market, while a majority of patients without the exposure history
indicate the rapid human-to-human transmission. Based on a recent review, the estimated

mean R0, an indicator of virus transmissibility, for the SARS-CoV-2 is around 3.28, which
is higher than the WHO estimated at 1.95.16, and is also higher than that of the SARSCoV outbreak in 2003, with R0 approximately at 3.0.17
Clinical characteristic analysis shows a significantly increased age as well as elevated
numbers of underlying comorbidities in severe patients than those in non-severe patients,
indicating that the age and comorbidity may be important risk factors for poor outcome.
Contradictory to the previous report showing a higher incidence of COVID-19 in male
patients,

recent data including ours, consistently showed a similar proportion of male

and female patients with COVID-19. 11
The patients with COVID-19 also demonstrated a decreased lymphatic count comparing
to healthy people, and it was significantly decreased in severe patients compared to those
in non-severe patients. Our data show that lymphocytopenia occurred in more than 80%
of severe patients, consistent with the result of a recent cohort study. 18 Lymphocytopenia
is also a prominent feature of severe patients with SARS-CoV and MERS infection which
attribute to the necrosis or apoptosis of lymphocyte caused by the invasive viral particles.

We also analyzed the absolute number of different subsets of lymphocytes in the ICU

patients. Compared to the health population, the total numbers of T cells (312 [231-558]
vs [805-4459]; number per μl), CD4+ T cells (245 [148-297] vs [345-2350]), CD8+ T cells
(81 [64-230] vs [345-2350]), total B cells (81 [47-106] vs [240-1317]) as well as natural
killer (NK) cells (51 [21-115] vs [210-1514]) were dramatically decreased in the severe
patients (data not shown), suggesting that the severity of lymphocytopenia reflects the
severity of COVID-19. A recent study showed a significantly reduced total number of T
cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in elder and severe patients with COVID-19 21, and revealed
one possible mechanism by which the aberrant cytokine signaling including TNF-a, IL-6

and IL-10 may be mediated in T cell pro-apoptosis.

21

In addition, abnormal laboratory

findings in the severe patients also included prolonged thrombin time, increased AST/AST,
hypersensitive troponin I and serum creatine, suggesting aberrant coagulation pathway,
hepatic injury, myocardial injury, and kidney injury, respectively. The levels of PCT, a
marker suggesting the bacterial infection, were not elevated in the patients with COVID19, suggesting the viral-mediated pneumonia rather than bacteria. These laboratory
abnormalities are similar to those previously observed in patients with MERS-CoV 22 and
SARS-CoV infection. 23 24
The rates of co-infection, including other viruses, bacteria and fungus, were significantly
increased in severe patients with COVID-19 than those in non-severe patients. The coinfection rate was also higher in the death group than that of the ICU-to-Ward transfer
group, despite no significantly statistical difference due to a small number of cases
involved in. The main reasons for the increased hospital acquired infections were due to
lymphocytopenia and the reduced host immune functions in critically ill patients. These
patients bear invasive catheters including endotracheal tube, arteriovenous catheters,
urinary and gastric tubes, resulting in an increased susceptibility to secondary infections
of nosocomial multidrug-resistant pathogens, such as A. baumannii, Escherichia coli,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus. We found that 5 (55.6%) of COVID-19
patients co-infected with carbapenem-resistant A. baumanni (CRAB) in the ICU death
group, which was much higher than those (4 [17.4%]) in the ICU-to-Ward transfer group
(data not shown). The higher rate of CRAB infection makes difficulties in antibiotic
treatment, resulting in increased possibility to develop septic shock and death. 25
At present, there is no evidence showing specific drug treatment against the new
coronavirus in suspected or confirmed cases. The principles of treatment include

improvement of the symptoms and underlying diseases, active prevention of potential
complications and secondary infections. Like other viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 enters cells
through receptor-mediated endocytosis.26 Studies showed that the SARS-CoV-2 may
infect alveolar epithelial cells in lung through the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2)
receptor, which is also expressed in other tissues, such as kidney, blood vessels and
heart.26 27 Researchers using an artificial intelligence predicted that Baricitinib, an inhibitor
of AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1), might be useful to interrupt the entrance of
virus to cells and also the intracellular assembly of the virus particles.

In addition, a

case report showed that remdesivir, an adenosine analogue, has shown survival benefits
in one severe COVID-19 pneumonia patient

. The effectiveness has been verified in

vitro. 30 Now a couple of clinical trials focus on the efficacy of remdesivir, as well as other
therapeutic strategies, such as immunoglobulins, Vitamin C infusion, mesenchymal stem
cell treatment, arbidol hydrochloride plus interferon atomization, ritonavir combined with
oseltamivir,

and

methylprednisolone. 31
The corticosteroid therapy regarding the onset therapeutic time, the dosage, and duration
were still controversial in the treatment of severe SARS or SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

32

We treated corticosteroid to the patients with refractory high fever, exacerbation of
wheezing symptoms, increased interstitial exudation based on chest radiology, and high
levels of inflammatory mediators to inhibit the “cytokine storm”. Corticosteroid therapy
(methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/day) are recommended for severely ill patients with ARDS,
for as short a duration of treatment as possible.

33 34

The results showed that the early

onset use of corticosteroid may have clinical benefits, but more cases and multivariate
correlation analysis regarding the safety and efficacy were needed to verify. Our data also

suggested that excessive fluid resuscitation may increase the risk of death. One principle
of the ARDS treatments is the restricted fluid resuscitation strategy to prevent
exacerbation of pulmonary edema. 35
The limitation of this study is that among the 221 cases, most of the patients were still
hospitalized at the time of data collected. It is incomplete to assess risk factors for
outcomes. Continued observation and dynamic clinical dataset are required.

Conclusion
In this single-center case series of 221 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in
Wuhan, China, 55 severe patients (24.9%) with elder age and chronic comorbidities,
developed more than one complication. 44 (80%) of them received ICU care, and 52.3%
of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and the mortality rate
of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%. Of the 166 non-severe patients, 21.1% of them were
cured and discharged and no patients died. Older and male patients with higher APACHE
II & SOFA scores, elevated PCT level, excessive fluid volume input, as well as the delayed
use of corticosteroid might increase the risk of death.

Figure legends
Figure 1: Transverse chest CT images of the patients with COVID-19.
Case A：Transverse chest CT images from a 72-year-old man with severe COVID-19.
The 1st chest CT shows multiple ground-glass opacities in bilateral lungs on day 8 after
symptom onset. The 2ed chest CT Shows progressive bilateral ground-glass opacities and
multiple lobes of consolidation on day 14 after symptom onset, and the 3 ed images were
obtained after ECMO supportive therapy in the ICU showing recovery status on day 30
after symptom onset. Case B: Transverse chest CT images from a 44-year-old man with
mild COVID-19. The 1st chest CT shows bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas
of consolidation on day 7 after symptom onset. The 2 ed chest CT Shows bilateral groundglass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation on day 10 after symptom onset,
and the 3ed chest CT shows improved status on day 18 after symptom onset.
