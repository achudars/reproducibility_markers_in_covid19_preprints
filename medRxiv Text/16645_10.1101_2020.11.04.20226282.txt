Research In Context

33
34

Evidence before this study

35

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was recognized as the

36

causative agent of COVID-19 in early 2020. Since that time, >150 candidate vaccines are

37

reported to be under development of which 47 have entered clinical trials

38

(https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines

39

accessed Nov 4, 2020). No vaccine to prevent COVID-19 has been licensed yet for either

40

emergency or general use in North America or Europe. We searched PubMed for research

41

articles published between July 2019 and November 4, 2020, using the terms “SARS-CoV-2”,

42

“vaccine”, “clinical trial” OR “human”, AND “phase”. The same terms were used to search

43

ClinTrials.gov. No language restrictions were applied. We identified 10 peer-reviewed studies,

44

describing phase 1 or 1/2 trials using a range of novel (eg: RNA, DNA, non-replicating virus

45

vectored) and more traditional vaccine approaches (eg: inactivated virus or recombinant protein

46

± adjuvants). None of these candidate vaccines was produced in plants. These reports

47

demonstrate that several different vaccination strategies (typically delivered in two doses 14-28

48

days apart) are capable of eliciting neutralizing antibody responses. In several cases, vaccine-

49

induced cellular responses against SARS-COV-2 antigens - predominantly the spike (S) protein

50

- can also be demonstrated. Although local and systemic adverse events following vaccination

51

have varied between reports, the trials published to date suggest that each of these candidate

52

vaccines is well-tolerated in the context of an evolving pandemic.

53
54

Added value of this study

55

We report the results of the first clinical study of CoVLP, a virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine

56

that is produced by transient transfection of Nicotiana benthamiana plants. These VLPs

57

spontaneously assemble at the plant cell membrane and display SARS-COV-2 trimers of

58

stabilized pre-fusion S protein on their surface. The vaccine was administered as two

59

intramuscular doses 21 days apart at three dose levels (S protein content 3.75, 7,5 or 15g)

60

alone or adjuvanted with either CpG1018 or AS03. All formulations were well-tolerated

61

although both adjuvants increased reactogenicity. Humoral (anti-S IgG and neutralizing

62

antibodies) as well as cellular responses (IFNg and IL4 ELISpots) were detectable in almost all

63

subjects who received adjuvanted formulations 21 days after the second dose at all COVLP

64

dose levels. Both antibody and cellular responses were highest in subjects who received AS03-

65

adjuvanted formulations. Even at the lowest dose level (3.75g), the neutralizing antibody titers

66

21 days after the second dose in subjects who received the AS03-afdjuvanted vaccine were 10-

67

50-fold higher than those seen in subjects recovering from COVID-19 infection.

68
69

Implications of all the available evidence

70

Effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed to reduce the burden of disease

71

and contribute to ending the global pandemic. Although no immune correlates for SARS-CoV-

72

2 have been defined, it is likely that both arms of the immune system contribute to protection.

73

After two doses of CoVLP (3.75g+AS03), strong humoral and cellular responses were

74

induced supporting the further clinical development of this vaccine.

Longer Abstract

77

Background: The stabilized prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is produced by

78

transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. The trimeric spike glycoproteins are displayed

79

at the surface of self-assembling Virus-Like-Particles that mimic the shape and the size of the

80

virus. The candidate vaccine (CoVLP) administered alone or with AS03 or CpG1018

81

adjuvants was evaluated in a Phase 1 trial in healthy adults. (ClinicalTrials.gov number

82

NCT04450004)

83
84

Methods: The study was a randomized, partially-blinded, prime-boost 21 days apart, dose-

85

escalation Phase 1 study intended to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of

86

CoVLP at three dose levels (3.75 µg, 7.5 µg, and 15 µg) unadjuvanted or adjuvanted with

87

either CpG 1018 or AS03 in 180 SARS-CoV-2 seronegative healthy adults 18 to 55 years of

88

age. Enrollment was staggered for dose-escalation. At each dose level, the vaccine was initially

89

administered to a small number of subjects. Vaccination of the remaining subjects at the same

90

dose level and the next higher vaccine dose level was administered with approval of an

91

Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). The same procedure was followed for the

92

second vaccine administration. Monitoring of safety signals was performed throughout the

93

study with pre-determined pausing/stopping rules if there was clear evidence of harmful effects

94

such as severe adverse events (AEs) related to the treatment. The primary endpoints were the

95

safety and tolerability of the vaccine after each dose and the immunogenicity as assessed by

96

neutralizing antibody responses assessed using a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudovirion

97

assay and interferon-gamma (IFN-) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) ELISpot assays at Days 0, 21 and

98

42. Secondary endpoints were anti-spike antibody responses by ELISA and neutralizing

99

antibodies measured by live virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) assay at Days 0,

100

21 and 42 and immunogenicity with additional safety and immunogenicity endpoints planned

101

for 6-months following the last vaccination. The anti-spike and neutralizing antibody responses

102

were compared with 23 convalescent serum samples from symptomatic Covid-19 patients. We

103

performed a primary analysis at day 42.

104
105

Results: A total of 180 subjects (102 females: 78 males: average 34.3 years) were recruited to

106

the study and interim safety and immunogenicity data up to day 42 after the first dose are

107

reported here. There was no obvious CoVLP dose effect in safety outcomes for any of the

108

formulations tested and all formulations were generally well-tolerated. Most solicited local and

109

systemic AEs were mild-moderate and transient. Reactogenicity was increased in all adjuvanted

110

formulations and was generally highest in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. Local and systemic

111

adverse events were reported with similar frequency after the first and second doses in subjects

112

who received either CoVLP alone or CoVLP+CpG1018 but increased in both frequency and

113

severity after the second dose in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. CoVLP alone only elicited a weak

114

total anti-spike IgG response at the highest dose level and little-to-no neutralization antibody

115

response, even after the second dose. Cellular responses in the CoVLP alone groups (IFN and

116

IL-4) were detectable after the second dose but were still only marginally above background

117

levels. The addition of either adjuvant substantially increased both antibody and cellular

118

responses at most CoVLP dose levels and changes were most pronounced after the second

119

dose. However, a substantial neutralizing antibody response after the first dose was only seen in

120

all CoVLP+AS03 groups. After the second dose, both total anti-spike IgG and neutralizing

121

antibody titers in the CoVLP+AS03 groups were higher than those in the CoVLP+CpG1018

122

groups. The antibody titers achieved were either similar to (CoVLP+CpG1018) or at least 10-

123

times higher (CoVLP+AS03) than those seen in convalescent plasma. Administration of

124

CoVLP with either adjuvant also significantly increased the cellular responses. After 2 doses,

125

both IFN- and IL-4 responses were significantly increased in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups. In

126

the CoVLP+AS03 groups, significant increases in the cellular responses were observed after

127

the first dose while IFN-γ and IL-4 increased further in both magnitude and number of subjects

128

responding after the second dose. Again, the cellular responses in the CoVLP+AS03 groups

129

were higher than those seen in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups.

130
131

Conclusion: These data demonstrate that CoVLP administered with either CpG1018 or AS03

132

has a safety profile similar to other candidate vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. When administered

133

with either AS03 or CpG1018, several of the CoVLP dose levels elicited strong humoral and T

134

cell responses after the second dose. When administered with AS03, even the 3.75 g CoVLP

135

dose elicited neutralizing antibody titers that were ~10-times higher than those observed in

136

individuals recovering from Covid-19 as well as consistent and balanced IFN- and IL-4

137

responses. Although many CoVLP formulations were immunogenic, in the absence of

138

established correlates of protection and given the advantages of dose-sparing in the context of

139

the on-going pandemic, these findings suggest that CoVLP (3.75 g)+AS03 has a good

140

benefit/risk ratio and support the transition of this formulation to studies in expanded

141

populations and to efficacy evaluations

Shorter Abstract (Word count: 242)

145

Background: Virus-like particles (VLP) displaying recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

146

trimers were produced by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. This candidate

147

vaccine (CoVLP) was evaluated in healthy adults 18-55 years of age alone or with AS03 or

148

CpG1018 (NCT04450004).

149
150

Methods: This randomized, partially-blinded, two-dose, dose-escalation study assessed

151

CoVLP (3.75, 7.5 or 15 µg/dose) administered intramuscularly alone or with CpG1018 or

152

AS03 in SARS-CoV-2 seronegative adults (18-55 years). Primary endpoints of safety and

153

immunogenicity are reported to day 42. Neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) were assessed using a

154

VSV pseudovirus assay and cellular responses by ELISpot (IFN, IL-4).

155
156

Results: 180 subjects (avg.34.3yrs) were recruited. All formulations were well-tolerated but

157

adjuvants increased reactogenicity. Adverse events were highest in the CoVLP+AS03 groups

158

and increased in frequency/severity after dose two. CoVLP alone elicited weak humoral

159

responses but modest cellular responses were detectable after dose two. Both adjuvants

160

increased immunogenicity significantly, particularly after dose two. A significant NtAb

161

response after dose one was only seen in CoVLP+AS03 groups. The vaccine dose had little

162

impact on levels of NtAb responses achieved in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. Both adjuvants also

163

increased IFN and IL-4 responses but these cellular responses also tended to be highest in the

164

AS03-adjuvanted groups.

165
166

Conclusion: CoVLP ± adjuvants was well-tolerated. Several adjuvanted formulations

167

elicited strong humoral and T cell responses after dose 2. Even at the lowest CoVLP+AS03

168

dose, NtAb titers were ~10-times higher than in convalescent serum with a balanced IFN and

169

IL-4 response. These findings support the transition of CoVLP (3.75g+AS03) to further

170

clinical evaluation.

Introduction (Word count: 458)

173
174

A novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

175

jumped across a species barrier in China in late 2019 1,2 and spread rapidly around the globe

176

leading to the World Health Organization’s declaration of a pandemic on March 11, 2020 3. As

177

of October 11th, 2020, more than 37 million cases of Covid-19 have been reported with >1

178

million deaths 4. Although many therapeutic strategies has been tried 5,6 7, the current options

179

remain limited in both number and efficacy. Simultaneously, there has been a massive global

180

effort to develop vaccines. This effort was primed to some extent by prior experience with other

181

highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, SARS and MERS8 and the far-sighted efforts of the

182

Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to develop vaccines for a ‘short-list’

183

of pathogens with pandemic potential 9. At the time of writing, >150 vaccine candidates have

184

been announced, >30 are in clinical trials and a small number have been authorized for limited

185

use in some countries 10. These candidates are based on a wide range of traditional and novel

186

platforms including mRNA, DNA, inactivated virus, live viral vectors, recombinant proteins,

187

peptides, and virus-like particles (VLPs) 11,12. No vaccine has been approved for general use yet

188

in North America.

189
190

Adding to the complexity of this situation is the facts that no correlate of immunity has been

191

defined for any highly pathogenic coronavirus 13,14 and that such correlates might differ

192

between vaccines15. Nonetheless, a protective role for both humoral and cell-mediated

193

immunity against coronaviruses has been suggested 16,17. Antibody responses against the spike

194

(S) protein have the potential to protect from infection 18-20 and convalescent plasma with high

195

titers of anti-S antibody have therapeutic benefit in selected patients 7,21. However, a substantial

196

proportion of people who develop Covid-19 fail to generate antibodies, and data from the

197

SARS-CoV-1 outbreak of 2002–2003 22 and the current pandemic suggest that antibody

198

responses can be short-lived, disappearing within months of infection in some patients23. In

199

contrast, T cell immunity may be critical for recovery from Covid-1924,25 and was shown to

200

persist for up to 11 years after SARS-CoV-1 infection 26. T cells can provide substantial

201

protection in animal models of highly pathogenic coronavirus infection.

202
203

We report here the results of a Phase 1 study initiated in July 2020 evaluating the safety,

204

tolerability and immunogenicity of two doses, 21-days apart of 3.75, 7.5 or 15 µg of a virus-

205

like-particle vaccine candidate for Covid-19 produced in plants (hereafter called CoVLP). This

recombinant platform has been used to produce hemagglutinin (HA)-bearing VLP vaccines for

207

avian (monovalent) and seasonal (quadrivalent) influenza that induce balanced humoral and T

208

cell responses 28-31. The CoVLP vaccine was administered alone or with AS03 or CpG1018

209

adjuvants in healthy adults 18-55 years of age.

210
211

Methods (Word count: 687)

212
213

The CoVLP Vaccine and Adjuvants

214

The full-length S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, strain hCoV-19/USA/CA2/2020,

215

corresponding in sequence to nucleotides 21563 to 25384 from EPI_ISL_406036 in GISAID

216

database (https://www.gisaid.org/) was expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana plants as

217

previously described 32. The S protein was modified with R667G, R668S and R670S

218

substitutions at the S1/S2 cleavage site to increase stability, and K971P and V972P

219

substitutions to stabilize the protein in prefusion conformation. The signal peptide was replaced

220

with a plant gene signal peptide and the transmembrane domain (TM) and cytoplasmic tail

221

(CT) of S protein was also replaced with TM/CT from Influenza H5 A/Indonesia/5/2005 to

222

increase VLP assembly and budding. The self-assembled VLPs bearing S protein trimers were

223

isolated from the plant matrix and subsequently purified using a process similar to that

224

described for the influenza vaccine candidates 28.

225
226

The AS03 adjuvant, an oil-in-water emulsion containing tocopherol and squalene, was

227

supplied by GlaxoSmithKline. The CpG 1018 adjuvant, composed of cytosine

228

phosphoguanine (CpG) motifs, was supplied by Dynavax. The CoVLP vaccine and

229

adjuvants were mixed immediately prior to administration

230
231

Study design

232

The Phase 1 study was conducted at two sites in Quebec City and Montreal (Protocol available

233

in Supplemental Material). At screening, health status was assessed by medical history,

234

physical exam and clinical laboratory findings including detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-

235

2 (ElecSys: Roche Diagnostics). Healthy seronegative subjects 18-55 years of age who met all

236

inclusion criteria and no exclusion criterion were enrolled and randomized into nine groups.

237

Randomised subjects received two doses, 21 days apart of CoVLP at doses of 3.75, 7.5 or 15

238

µg unadjuvanted or adjuvanted with AS03 or CpG1018. The participants and the personnel

allocation. On Day 0 (D0: pre-first dose), D21 (pre-second dose) and D42 (post second dose),

241

serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were processed for immune outcomes

242

as described previously 28.

243
244

Safety

245

For details of safety monitoring, see the Protocol in Suppl. Materials. Briefly, enrollment was

246

staggered for dose-escalation with sentinel subjects at each dose level (n=6) and independent

247

data monitoring committee (IDMC) review of D3 safety data at 10% and 30% recruitment

248

before each dose acceleration. The same process was followed for the second vaccine

249

administration. Monitoring of safety signals was performed throughout the study (Suppl

250

Material: pp 2). Solicited adverse events (AEs) were assessed by the subjects as Grade 1 to 4

251

(mild, moderate, severe, or potentially life-threatening). Unsolicited AEs, and AEs leading to

252

subject withdrawal were collected up to D21 after each vaccination. All serious AEs (SAE),

253

Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs), and pregnancies will be collected for 6 months.

254

Potential cases of vaccine enhanced disease (VED), hypersensitivity and potential immune-

255

mediated diseases (pIMDs) are being monitored throughout the study (see Suppl. Material: pp

256

7, Tables S2, S3).

257
258

Immunogenicity assessments

259

The primary immunological outcomes were neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses measured

260

using a VSV pseudovirion assay (Nexelis Inc, Laval, QC) and IFN and IL-4 cellular responses

261

measured by ELISpot at D0, 21 and 42. Secondary immunological outcomes were total anti-

262

spike IgG responses by ELISA and NAb responses by plaque reduction neutralization test

263

(PRNT: Vismedri S.r.l., Siena, Italy) Details of these assays are provided in the Suppl.

264

Material (pp 3-5).

265
266

Antibody responses were compared with those of individuals who had recovered from PCR-

267

confirmed Covid-19 obtained from Solomon Park (Burien, WA)), Sanguine BioSciences

268

(Sherman Oaks, CA) and M Cheng (McGill University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec). The

269

severity of disease ranged from mild-moderate (n=23) to severe/critical (n=11) (Suppl.

Analysis Populations and Statistical Analysis Plan

273
274

Overall, 180 healthy SATRS-COV-2 seronegative male and female subjects 18 to 55 years of

275

age were randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio into nine treatment groups. The sample size

276

made it possible to perform the initial evaluation of the vaccine immunogenicity and detect

277

major differences in rates of AEs between groups. The sample size was not large enough to

278

detect all types, including less frequent or rare, AEs.

279
280

The analyses of all immunogenicity endpoints were based on the Per Protocol set (PP) and are

281

described in the Statistical Analysis Plan provided as Supplementary Material.

Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics

285
286

Participant demographics are presented in Table 1 and subject disposition up to D42 is

287

presented in Table 2 and in Suppl. Materials: Fig. S1: pp. 19. More women (56.7%) than men

288

(43.3%) were enrolled but the female:male ratio was the same for each CoVLP dose level and

289

in each of the overall groups (unadjuvanted CoVLP, CoVLP+AS03, CoVLP+CpG1018).

290

Subjects were mostly White (96%) with 2% each of Black or African American and Asian

291

subjects. The average age was 34.3 years. A total of 180 subjects received the first dose of

292

vaccine and 178 subjects received both doses. See Fig. S1 in Suppl. Materials for details.

Reactogenicity for all formulations was generally mild in severity (Figure 1) and of short

296

duration. Both adjuvants increased the frequency of reported AEs. The frequency and severity

297

of AEs were similar after the first and second doses in the unadjuvanted CoVLP and

298

CoVLP+CpG1018 groups but increased after the second dose in subjects who received AS03-

299

adjuvanted formulations. Details of solicited AEs and TEAEs by treatment group are provided

300

in Suppl. Materials: Tables S4-S9).

There was no consistent impact of CoVLP dose level on safety outcomes in any group. After

304

and 39.7% reporting >1 systemic event. Pain at the injection site was the most common local

305

reaction (66.5%) while headache and fatigue were reported by 25.7% and 20.7% respectively.

306

The incidence of headache and fatigue were generally higher in the adjuvanted treatment

307

groups. AEs were mostly mild-moderate Grade 1-2) and only one Grade 3 report of fatigue

308

that started the evening following vaccination and resolved the same day. After the second

309

dose, 68.5% of participants reported >1 solicited AE, 62.9% reporting a local reaction and

310

47.8% reporting >1 systemic event. Pain at the injection site was again the most reported local

311

reaction (61.2%) while headache and fatigue were reported by 33.1% and 33.1% respectively.

312

Again, most symptoms were mild but there were more moderate AEs after the second dose.

313

Nine Grade 3 solicited severe AEs (fatigue, redness at injection site, swelling at injection site,

314

feeling of general discomfort or uneasiness) were reported in 6 subjects after the second dose.

315

All but one of the Grade 3 reactions were reported by subjects who receivedAS03-adjuvanted

316

formulations. One Grade 3 reaction occurred after the second dose in the CoVLP (7.5

317

g)+CpG1018 group. All Grade 3 AEs resolved in one to four days. No clinically significant

318

lab abnormalities were reported after any dose. No SAEs, AESIs or pregnancy

319

exposures have been reported at the time of writing.

320
321

Immunogenicity: Antibody Response

322

A small number of subjects (12/180; 6.7%) had detectable pre-existing antibodies for the spike

323

protein in one or more of the assays used. As illustrated in Figure 2, unadjuvanted CoVLP

324

elicited no detectable antibody response after the first dose and humoral responses after even

325

the second dose were modest and inconsistent. Although a minor dose-effect for the

326

unadjuvanted CoVLP was seen on the anti-spike IgG response (ELISA) after the second

327

vaccination, the responses in the two NAb assays remained low and variable even at the highest

328

dose tested. Both adjuvants had a significant impact on antibody responses at all dose levels.

329

Although there was no convincing effect of increasing CoVLP dose for either adjuvant, there

330

was a trend towards increasing consistency of response in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups at the

331

higher CoVLP doses (ie: a greater response and a larger proportion of subjects responding).

332

Although both adjuvants elicited modest IgG titers after the first dose, only the groups that

333

received COVLP+AS03 formulations mounted significant NAb responses at D21 (36/60; 60%)

334

and across all dose levels (ie: overall GMT of 33.3 in the pseudovirus assay). Both adjuvants

335

induced more robust responses after the second dose with the large majority of subjects at all

336

dose levels mounting a ≥4-fold rise in total IgG (117/118; 99.1%) and in both NAb assays

337

(105/112; 93.8% in the pseudovirion assay and 106/116; 91.3% in the PRNT). At all dose

338

levels, both anti-spike IgG and pseudovirion NAb titers at D42 were 10- to 50- fold higher in

339

subjects who had received AS03-adjuvanted formulations compared to those who had received

340

CpG1018-adjuvanted formulations. For example, after the second CoVLP(3.75 g) dose, the

341

GMTs in the PRNT were 7.2 for CoVLP alone, 56.6 for CoVLP+CpG1018 and 811.3 for

342

CoVLP+AS03. Overall, the levels of NAb induced in the groups that received two doses of

343

CoVLP with an adjuvant were either similar to (CoVLP+CpG1018) or substantially greater

344

(CoVLP+AS03) than those seen in subjects 3-4 weeks after recovering from natural Covid-19

345

infection. Details of serologic response results by treatment group are presented in Suppl.

346

Materials: Tables S10-S12.

347
348

Correlation between Neutralizing Antibody Assays

349

There was a strong correlation between the VSV pseudovirion neutralization assay and the

350

PRNT for responses in all groups: r =0.85 (p < 0.0001) after the first (Figure 3A) and r = 0.68

351

(p < 0.0001) second vaccinations (Figure 3B).

352
353

Immunogenicity: T Cell Response

354

As illustrated in Figure 4, the IFN and IL-4 responses in PBMC (ELISpot) elicited by CoVLP

355

± adjuvants were more variable than the antibody responses. A substantial minority of subjects

356

in all groups had what appeared to be pre-existing IFN responses to the S protein peptide pool

357

that were, in some subjects, substantial (ie: >200 spots)33. Although low level ‘background’ IL-

358

4 activity was seen in a small number of subjects, these responses were close to the limit of

359

detection of the assay used (generally <10 spots). Unlike antibody responses, CoVLP alone was

360

able to induce a substantial IFN response and, to a lesser extent, IL-4 response in many

361

subjects after the second doses at all dose levels but that was most consistently seen at the

362

highest dose (CoVLP 15g). Both adjuvants generally increased IFN and IL-4 responses

363

above background levels after the first dose that were further and substantially increased in

364

magnitude and consistency by the second dose. Compared to unadjuvanted CoVLP, IFN

365

responses were slightly higher and IL-4 responses were slightly lower in the CpG1018-

366

adjuvanted groups but most of these differences did not reach statistical significance. Once

367

again, the IFN and IL-4 responses to the CoVLP+AS03 formulations at all dose levels were 10

368

to 50-fold higher than those seen in the equivalent CoVLP+CpG1018 groups. For example, at

the 3.75 µg dose level: median IFN and IL-4 responses at D42 were 628 and 445 in the

370

CoVLP+AS03 group and 49 and 4 in the CoVLP+CpG1018 group. Details of cellular response

373

Discussion (Word count: 1223)

374
375

This phase 1 study was designed to select the CoVLP formulation (ie: dose level ±

376

adjuvant) and the number of doses needed to generate a consistent immune response in

377

healthy adults with an acceptable safety profile. Although unadjuvanted CoVLP had the

378

lowest reactogenicity and was recognized by the immune system after the second dose,

379

the immune responses measured (i.e.:anti-spike IgG, NAb, IFN and IL-4 ELISpots)

380

were generally modest. These observations are consistent with studies of plant-derived

381

VLP vaccines bearing HA trimers of avian influenza strains 30,34 in which serologic and

382

T cell responses were observed with unadjuvanted formulations at doses >15 µg but

383

were seen at lower doses when administered with an oil-in-water adjuvant (GLA-SE)34.

384

Although we observed no dose effect with unadjuvanted CoVLP for antibody or

385

cellular responses, it is possible that higher doses of unadjuvanted CoVLP would have

386

induced stronger responses. However, two different adjuvants were incorporated into

387

this study because of their potential to induce more robust responses at a lower CoVLP

388

dose (ie: dose-sparing).

389
390

While sharing some characteristics (ie: documented immune enhancement, large safety

391

databases, previously licensed)35-38, the inclusion of both CpG1018 and AS03

392

permitted us to ask multiple questions about CoVLP performance simultaneously. In

393

the case of CpG1018, by targeting the innate toll-like receptor 9 we hoped that both

394

arms of the adaptive immune system would be engaged with induction of humoral and

395

cellular responses 39. Although the mechanism of action of oil-in-water adjuvants like

396

AS03 is still under active investigation40, the combination of squalene and tocopherol

397

(vitamin E) in AS03 has also been shown to enhance both humoral and cellular

398

responses with several different vaccine antigens 41,42.

399
400

In the current study, the adjuvants performed as expected with enhancement of humoral

401

and cellular responses to the S protein and in promoting responses at lower CoVLP

402

doses. In both dose-sparing and enhancing immune responses, AS03 appeared to be

403

more effective than CpG1018. For example, a substantial minority of the subjects who

404

received even the lowest dose of CoVLP+AS03 (3.75 µg) mounted detectable NAb

405

responses after the first dose but no similar response was seen in the CpG1018-

406

adjuvanted groups. Furthermore, the anti-spike IgG and NAb responses were

407

consistently higher at all dose levels in the AS03-adjuvanted groups compared to the

408

CpG1018-adjuvanted groups although differences did not reach statistical significance

409

at higher doses of CoVLP. The humoral response to the AS03-adjuvanted formulations

410

demonstrated no CoVLP dose effect, particularly after the second dose. Overall, the

411

differences between unadjuvanted and adjuvanted formulations and between the two

412

adjuvants were less pronounced for Th1-type cell-mediated responses than for antibody

413

responses. Nonetheless, IFN responses to adjuvanted formulations were consistently

414

higher at most dose levels than responses to CoVLP alone, particularly after the second

415

dose. Overall, IFN responses were strongest in the AS03-adjuvanted groups,

416

particularly at lower CoVLP dose levels. Of course, it is possible that the IFN

417

responses observed were mediated in part by other cells (eg: NK or CD8 T cells),

418

since the ELISpot assay captures cell-mediated responses indiscriminately44. Additional

419

flow cytometry evaluations are warranted to characterize the phenotype of these

420

cellular responses more comprehensively and in particular, to better understand the

421

relative contribution of CD4 T cells to the observed responses. The IL-4 response was

422

also consistently higher in the AS03-adjuvanted groups compared to the unadjuvanted

423

or CpG1018-adjuvanted groups. In the AS)3-adjuvanted groups, the IL4 response was

424

10-fold lower than the IFN responses after the first dose but rose to near equivalence

425

with the second dose suggesting a balanced Th1- and Th2-type response.

426
427

It is noteworthy that a substantial proportion of the subjects in this study appeared to

428

have pre-existing IFN responses to the S protein peptide pool used for PBMC

429

restimulation. Such cross-reactive T cell memory, possibly due to prior exposure to

430

common human coronaviruses has been seen in 40-60% of adults and may provide

431

some protection against highly pathogenic strains 33. Prior exposure to circulating

432

coronaviruses may also explain the small number of subjects in this study (6.7%) who

433

were ‘seronegative’ at screening based upon a commercial N-based ELISA but who

434

were sero-positive at D0 in our assays targeting the S protein.

435
436

Together, these immune outcome data suggest that CoVLP alone can elicit both

437

humoral and cellular responses that are Th1-biased to some extent and that this pattern

438

of response is reinforced when adjuvanted with CpG1018. In contrast, when CoVLP is

439

adjuvanted with AS03, the response was faster and more balanced with evidence of

440

both Th1- and Th2-type activation. Although Th2-deviated responses have been

441

implicated in VED (e.g.: early RSV vaccine)45 and are a theoretical risk for vaccines

442

targeting pathogenic coronaviruses 46, the engagement of T cells is also critical for B-

443

cell maturation and the induction of strong and durable antibody responses 47,48.

444
445

The safety profile of CoVLP alone was relatively benign at all dose levels but, as

446

expected, both the frequency and the intensity of local and systemic AEs was increased

447

with either adjuvant. Compared to the first dose, the frequency of Grade 2 or Grade 3

448

AEs also increased after the second dose in all groups that received adjuvanted

449

formulations. All AEs reported, regardless of dose level, adjuvant or initial intensity,

450

were transient and resolved rapidly. Although one subject did not receive a second dose

451

of vaccine due to a grade 3 AE (per Protocol), no subject voluntarily withdrew from the

452

study due to any AE/SAE. Overall, the reactogenicity of the adjuvanted CoVLP

453

formulations was similar to that reported for other candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in

454

early-phase clinical studies. Although hypersensitivity to plant material is a theoretical

455

risk with any plant-derived product, no subject in the current study had an allergic-type

456

reaction, consistent with Medicago’s safety database of >14,000 subjects who have

457

received one or two doses of plant-derived influenza vaccine candidates49.

459

Like any early-phase clinical trial, this study has several limitations beyond the obvious

460

concern regarding small group size when testing multiple dose levels and formulations

461

(n=20/group). For comparisons between formulations however, the small group risk

462

was mitigated by the fact that results across the three CoVLP dose levels were highly

463

consistent (n=60 for CoVLP alone or with each adjuvant). Another obvious concern is

464

the relatively limited range of immune response parameters available at the time of

465

writing. Although the data presented herein provide a ‘first look’ at the immune

466

response induced by the different formulations, the immune profiles will be further

467

investigated in the coming months. Finally, like all other early-phase trials, our study

468

assessed only the short-term (day 42) response to vaccination and the durability of

469

these responses will only become apparent as subjects are followed for longer periods

470

of time. However, based on the robust high antibody and balanced cellular responses to

471

the adjuvanted CoVLP formulations and our previous experience with plant-derived

472

VLP vaccines targeting influenza, we anticipate that the CoVLP-induced responses are

473

likely to last for at least 6 months30, 50.

474
475

In conclusion, this first trial of CoVLP alone or adjuvanted with either CpG1018 or

476

AS03 suggests that our plant-derived candidate vaccine is well-tolerated and

477

immunogenic. Its immunogenicity, particularly at low doses, is dramatically enhanced

478

by the presence of an adjuvant. Based upon the totality of non-clinical and clinical

479

results available and the obvious advantages of dose-sparing in a pandemic, a two-dose

480

schedule of CoVLP at 3.75 g/dose adjuvanted with AS03 will be carried forward into

481

further studies planned for Canada, the USA and other countries.

Figure 1 Solicited Local and Systemic AEs 7-Days After the First or Second Vaccine Dose.
Subjects were monitored for solicited local (panel A) and systemic (panel B) AEs from the time of
vaccination through 7 days after vaccine administration. There was no grade 4 (life-threatening) events.
Participants who reported 0 events make up the remainder of the 100% calculation (not shown). If any of
the solicited AEs persisted beyond Day 7 after each vaccination (when applicable), it was recorded as
unsolicited AEs.

Figure 2 CoVLP Humoral Response.
Serum antibodies of subjects vaccinated with 3.75, 7.5, or 15 µg CoVLP with or without AS03 or CpG1018
adjuvant, were measured to spike protein by ELISA (panel A) or by neutralization of pseudovirus (panel
B), or live virus (panel C). Convalescent sera from recovered COVID-19 infected mildly, moderately, or
severely ill patients were analyzed by anti-spike ELISA (n=35), and sera from mildly or moderately ill
patients and one severely ill patient were analyzed by pseudovirion neutralization assay (n=21); results are
shown in the right panels. All results are presented as reciprocal mid-point titers. Bars indicate geometric
means. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. Significant differences between days 0 and 21, or 0
and 42, for each vaccine regimen are indicated by # (#p<0.05, ##p<0.01, ###p<0.001, ####p<0.0001;

Supplementary Methods:
Vaccination Stopping Rules
Safety monitoring of safety signals were and will be performed throughout the study. Stopping rules or
conditions for stopping this clinical trial would occur if there was clear evidence of harm or harmful
effects such as SAEs related to the treatment (study vaccine). A SAE which was thought to be unrelated
to the study vaccine would not warrant stopping the trial.
The following event(s) may result in a halt to the study, for further review and assessment of the event(s):
•
•
•
•

Any death occurring during the study;
Any vaccine-related SAE during the study;
Any life-threatening (Grade 4) vaccine-related AE during the study;
If 10 % or more of subjects in a single treatment group, experience the same or similar
listed event(s) that cannot be clearly attributed to another cause:
o a severe (Grade 3 or higher) vaccine-related AE during the study;
o a severe (Grade 3 or higher) vaccine-related vital sign(s) abnormality;
o a severe (Grade 3 or higher) vaccine-related clinical laboratory abnormality.
In the case that a pre-defined safety signal is met in any treatment group, subsequent dosing will result in
at least a transient halt in the study to permit a complete evaluation of the reported event(s) and to consult
an IDMC. A decision as to whether the study can progress as planned must be made and documented in
the event of any safety signal. If a stopping rule has been met once all subjects have been vaccinated in
the study, the IDMC will be notified by a Note To File (NTF) for their information purposes.

Immunological Assay Method Details
Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 Humoral Response

SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein ELISA
Briefly, SARS-Cov2 Spike protein (SARS-Cov2/Wuhan/2019, Immune Technology Corp.) was coated
onto a flat-bottom 96-well microplate at a concentration of 1ug/mL in sodium carbonate 50mM
(overnight; 4°C). Following washing steps (PBS-Tween), plates were blocked using Blotto 5%
(Rockland Inc.) in PBS (1-2 hours; 37°C). Following washing steps, serially diluted sera (starting dilution
1/100, 4-fold dilutions, 8 dilutions, in PBS-Tween-Blotto) were added to the wells, in duplicates, and
incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Plates were washed and incubated with secondary antibody (anti-Human
IgG (H+L) antibody, Peroxidase-labeled, Seracare), diluted at 1/20 000 in PBS-Tween-Blotto and
incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Plates were washed and incubated with peroxidase substrate (SureBlue
TMB, Seracare) for 20 minutes at room temperature. Reaction was stopped using hydrochloric acid and
absorbance was read at 450nm, within 2 hours (Variaskan Flash microplate reader, Thermo Scientific).
Optical density (OD) results for the serial dilutions were used to generate a 4-parameter logistic
regression (4PL). The titer was defined as the reciprocal dilution of the sample for which the OD is equal
to a fixed cut-point value. Samples below cut-point were attributed a value of 50 (half the minimum
required dilution).

SARS-CoV-2 Pseudovirus Neutralisation Assay (PNA)
Neutralizing antibody analysis was performed using a cell-based pseudotyped virus neutralisation assay
(Nexelis, Quebec, Canada). Pseudotyped virus particles were first generated using a genetically modified
Vesicular Stomatitis Virus backbone from which the glycoprotein G was removed and luciferase reporter
introduced (rVSVΔG-luciferase, Kerafast) to allow quantification using relative luminescence units
(RLU). This rVSVΔG–Luc virus was transduced into HEK293T cells that had previously been transduced
with SARS-Cov-2 Spike glycoprotein (NXL137-1 in POG2 containing 2019-nCOV Wuhan-Hu-1;
Genebank: MN908947) from which the last nineteen amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail were removed
(rVSVΔG-Luc-Spike ΔCT).
Serial dilutions (starting dilution of 1/10; 2-fold; 8 dilutions, in complete growth media) of the heatinactivated human sera (56°C; 30min) were prepared in a 96-well plate, in duplicates. The SARS-Cov-2
pseudovirus (in complete growth media) was added to the sera dilutions to reach a target concentration
equivalent to approximately 150,000 RLU/well and mixture was incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2
supplementation for 1 hour. Serum-pseudovirus complexes were then transferred onto plates previously
seeded overnight with Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586), expressing ACE-2 receptor, and incubated at

37°C with 5% CO2 supplementation for 20-24 hours. Once incubation was completed, cells were lysed
and samples equilibrated using ONE-Glo EX luciferase assay system (Promega), incubated for 3 minutes
at room temperature, and luminescence level read using a luminescence plate reader (i3x plate reader,
Molecular Devices). The resulting RLU was inversely proportional to the level of neutralizing antibodies
present in the serum. For each sample, the neutralizing titer was established as the reciprocal dilution
corresponding to the 50% neutralization (NT50), when compared to the pseudoparticle control. The
NT50 was interpolated from a linear regression using the two dilutions flanking the 50% neutralisation.
Samples below cut-off were attributed a value of 5 (half the minimum required dilution).

SARS-CoV-2 Microneutralization CPE-based assay
Neutralizing antibody analysis was also performed using a cell-based cytopathic effect (CPE) assay
(VisMederi, Sienna, Italy). Sera sample were first heat inactivated (56°C; 30min) and then serially diluted
(starting dilution of 1/10, 2-fold; 8 dilutions, in complete growth media). Wild-type SARS-Co-2 virus
(2019 nCOV ITALY/INMI1, provided by EVAg; Genebank: MT066156) was then added at final
concentration of 25 TCID50/mL (in complete growth media), and plates were incubated for 1 hour at
37°C with 5% CO2 supplementation. At the end of the incubation, the mixture was transferred onto
duplicate 96-well microtiter plates pre-seeded overnight with Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586),
expressing ACE-2 receptor. Plates were then incubated for 3 days at 37°C with 5% CO2 supplementation.
Cytopathic effect (CPE) was then quantified using an inverted optical microscope. The
microneutralization titer (MNt) was defined as the reciprocal of the highest sample dilution that protects
from CPE at least 50% of the cells. If no neutralization was observed, samples were attributed a titer
value of 5 (half the minimum required dilution).

Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 Cell-Mediated Immune Response
Interferon-γ ELISpot
Cell-mediated immune response was evaluated using an Interferon-γ ELISpot assay (Human IFN-γ
ELISpot assay, Cellular Technology Limited (CTL), USA). Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) were rapidly thawed and allowed to rest between 2 to 3 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2
supplementation, in CTL-Test media supplemented with 1% Glutamine and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin.
Cells were enumerated and dispensed at 0.5x106 cells per well, in duplicates, onto PVDF filter plates precoated with an IFN-γ specific capture antibody. Cells were stimulated using a pool of peptides (15-mer
peptides) overlapping the full sequence of SARS-Cov-2 spike protein (USA-CA2/2020, Genbank:
MN994468.1) at a concentration of 2.19 µg/mL, for 18-24 hours, at 37°C with 5% CO2 supplementation.

After washes (PBS-Tween), biotinylated anti-interferon-γ detection antibody was added to the plates and
incubated for 2 hours at room temperature after which, following another round of washes, a streptavidinalkaline phosphatase conjugate was added and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. After
washing steps, substrate solution was added, incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes, after which
plate was rinsed and left to air-dry pending spot enumeration, using an ELISpot reader (ImmunoSpot S6
Universal Analyzer, Cellular Technology Limited). Mean of peptide pool stimulation duplicates was
calculated and normalized using the mean of the negative control replicates (control media) and
multiplied by a factor of 2 to express cells counts per million cells.

Interleukin-4 (IL-4) ELISpot
Cell-mediated immune response was evaluated using an IL-4 ELISpot assay (Human IL-4 ELISpot assay,
Cellular Technology Limited (CTL), Cleveland, OH, USA). Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) were rapidly thawed and allowed to rest between 2 to 3 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2
supplementation, in CTL-Test media supplemented with 1% Glutamine and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin.
Cells were enumerated and dispensed at 0.5x106 cells per well, in duplicates, onto PVDF filter plates precoated with an IL-4 specific capture antibody. Cells were stimulated using a pool of peptides (15-mer
peptides) overlapping the full sequence of SARS-Cov-2 spike protein (USA-CA2/2020, Genbank:
MN994468.1) at a concentration of 2.19 µg/mL, for 32-48 hours, at 37°C with 5% CO2 supplementation.
After washes (PBS-Tween), biotinylated anti-IL-4 detection antibody was added to the plates and
incubated for 2 hours at room temperature after which, following another round of washes, a streptavidinalkaline phosphatase conjugate was added and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. After

Convalescent sera description
Sera from Covid-19 convalescent patients were collected from a total of 34 individuals with confirmed
disease diagnosis. Time between the onset of the symptoms and sample collection varied between 27 and
105 days. Three samples were collected by Solomon Park (Burien, WA, USA), 20 by Sanguine
BioSciences (Sherman Oaks, CA, USA) and 11 from McGill University Health Centre. Disease severity
were ranked as mild (Covid-19 symptoms without shortness of breath), moderate (shortness of breath
reported), and severe (hospitalized). These samples were analysed in parallel of clinical study samples,
using the same assay as described above. Samples from severely ill were analyzed by serum IgG ELISA
only. Demographic characteristics are provided in Supplementary Table 1.

Adverse Event Severity Evaluation and the Monitoring of Adverse Events of Special Interest

Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI)

AESI for CoVLP Vaccine – Vaccine Enhanced Disease (VED)
Safety signal of VED after exposure to the Coronavirus-Like Particle COVID-19 Vaccine was closely
monitored and assessed by retrieving data for this AESI as follows: AEs within the system organ class
(SOC): immune system disorders and high level group term (HLGT): lower respiratory tract disorders
(excluding obstruction and infection), cardiac disorders, signs and symptoms not elsewhere classified
(NEC), vascular disorders, heart failures NEC, arteriosclerosis, stenosis, vascular insufficiency and
necrosis, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial disorders, and vascular hemorrhagic disorders. High level term
(HLT): renal failure and impairment and preferred term (PT): pericarditis, coagulopathy, deep vein
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accidents, peripheral ischemia, liver injury, GuillainBarre syndrome, anosmia, ageusia, encephalitis, chilblains, vasculitis, erythema multiforme (based on
standardized MedDRA® classification)1,2 that require inpatient hospitalization (≥ 24 hours) and have
laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection will be monitored for assessment of any potential case of
VED.

AESI for CoVLP Vaccine – Hypersensitivity Reactions
All reported events were also monitored for hypersensitivity reactions after exposure to the CoronavirusLike Particle COVID-19 Vaccine. In eight clinical studies conducted to date with the Quadrivalent VLP
Influenza Vaccine (QVLP) produced using similar plant-based technology, all reported events were
monitored for a possible hypersensitivity component (events were searched using both narrow and broad
standardized MedDRA® queries). Based on these data, there was a single case of possible early
anaphylactic reaction associated with use of QVLP in humans. A small number of subjects had potential
hypersensitivity reactions judged to be related to vaccine administration (no more than 0.3 % of subjects
in any given QVLP treatment group experienced one of these events) and the events were distributed
fairly evenly among treatment groups, including the placebo and the active comparator groups. However,
since severe reactions are considered to be an important potential risk (based on the theoretical risk that
using plants for the production of biotherapeutics may induce hypersensitivity), Medicago required that
appropriate medical treatment and supervision were available to manage any possible anaphylactic
reactions in this study. To collect data on these events, Medicago closely monitored and assessed allergic
reactions assessed by the site Investigators as related to the Investigational product as AESIs.
