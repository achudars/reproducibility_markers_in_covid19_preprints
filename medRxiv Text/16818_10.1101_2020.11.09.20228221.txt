Abstract
Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with a wide range of divergent
pathologies, and risk of severe disease is reported to be increased by a similarly broad range
of co-morbidities. The present study investigated blood metabolites in order to elucidate
how infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can lead to such a
variety of pathologies and what common ground they share. COVID-19 patient blood
samples were taken at hospital admission in two Belgian patient cohorts, and a third cohort
that included longitudinal samples was used for additional validation (total n=581). A total of
251 blood metabolite measures and ratios were assessed using nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy and tested for association to disease severity. In line with the varied effects of
severe COVID-19, the range of severity-associated biomarkers was equally broad and
included

increased inflammatory

markers

(glycoprotein

acetylation),

amino

acid

concentrations (increased leucine and phenylalanine), increased lipoprotein particle
concentrations (except those of very low density lipoprotein, VLDL), decreased cholesterol
levels (except in large HDL and VLDL), increased triglyceride levels (only in IDL and LDL), fatty
acid levels (decreased poly-unsaturated fatty acid, increased mono-unsaturated fatty acid)
and decreased choline concentration, with association sizes comparable to those of routine
clinical chemistry metrics of acute inflammation. Our results point to systemic metabolic
biomarkers for COVID-19 severity that make strong targets for further fundamental research
into its pathology (e.g. phenylalanine and omega-6 fatty acids).

Introduction
Severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, is associated with a wide range of
pathologies including ARDS1,2, lymphocytopenia3, acute kidney failure4, liver injury5 and
septic shock3,4,6. A similarly wide range of co-morbidities predisposes patients to more
severe COVID-19, and includes obesity, diabetics, hypertension and cardiovascular disease
(CVD)7–9. Studies examining the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection have implicated a wide
variety of immunological processes (reviewed in10). SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) as a cell entry point, which could at least partially
explain the diverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as ACE2 is present on many different cell
types. ACE2 has been linked to CVD, inflammation and the metabolism through the
renin-angiotensin system (RAS)11, and it has been shown to regulate amino acid
homeostasis12. The populations with increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 share
low-grade inflammation as a common feature13 and the major risk factor for severe COVID19 can be interpreted as metabolic dysregulation14. A clear need exists for a systemic
investigation into the metabolic processes underlying the diverse immunological pathways
affected by SARS-CoV-2 to better understand 1) the factors associated with risk of severe
infection, 2) the systemic effects of COVID-19, and 3) the cardiometabolic complications
following disease resolution.
Limited reports investigating specific metabolites have already been published. These
include the association to disease severity of lower levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL)15,
and cholesterol levels in high density lipoprotein (HDL) and LDL16. However, traditional HDL,
LDL and cholesterol quantification methods used in clinical settings lack the resolution to

analytically capture the lipoprotein profile17. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy can be used to address this limitation18, and enables a more systemic
investigation by simultaneously quantifying a large number of metrics relevant to the
COVID-19 setting including energy-related metabolites, amino acid and fatty acid
concentrations and glycoprotein acetylation (GlycA)19,20.
GlycA is a relatively novel serum biomarker for systemic inflammation, known to be
increased in various conditions associated with a predisposition to severe COVID-19,
including CVD21–26, type-2 diabetes27 and elevated BMI28,29. The GlycA NMR signal quantifies
a non-specific, composite signal that arises from mobile N-acetyl methyl groups of circulating
glycoproteins (predominantly alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, alpha-1-antitrypsin, haptoglobin
and transferrin)30. These glycoproteins are acute-phase reactants, meaning their glycan
structures and their concentrations change during the acute-phase response of
inflammation30. However, GlycA has also shown distinct advantages over traditional
inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) in its association to inflammatory
conditions18,31,32. Due to its more persistent and composite nature, being a read-out for
many different inflammatory processes, GlycA can be interpreted as a summary measure of
a subject’s ‘baseline’ chronic inflammatory burden33. In light of the common theme of
low-grade inflammation in populations with higher risk for severe COVID-1913 and reports of
increased CVD risk during and following COVID-1934, GlycA is of particular relevance in the
COVID-19 setting.
To elucidate how SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to such a variety of pathologies and what
common ground these pathologies share, we used NMR experiments to quantify chronic
inflammatory burden, lipoprotein particle concentrations (as well as their cholesterol and

triglyceride content), amino acid and fatty acid concentrations, and energy related
metabolites in three sample sets from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in two
Belgian hospitals, collected at time of hospital admission for COVID-19. We identified
biomarkers associated with COVID-19 severity (mild/moderate/severe/critical) and test
which of these biomarkers could be used to identify patients who will develop critical
disease during their hospital stay. For a limited set of patients, we explore longitudinal data
from samples taken at day 7 post admission, at hospital discharge and 30 days post hospital
discharge.

Methods
Ethics
This study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the University Hospitals of
Leuven (MEC, UZ Leuven, s64161 and s63881) and the ethical approval committee of the
Jessa hospital (20.75-20.05). Samples from UZL and Jessa cohorts were collected
retrospectively, while the CONTAGIOUS cohort study is a prospective observational trial for
which informed consent was obtained for all participants (clinicaltrials.gov identifier
NCT04327570).
Study populations
This study included 581 samples from 480 patients across three different cohorts. A
graphical overview of the sample sets is available in

Supplementary Figure S1. Two of the

cohorts (UZL, n=219 and JESSA, n=164) consisted of convenience samples of

left-over

diagnostic samples of unselected adult patients. All COVID-19 patients from the first wave in
Belgium (March-June 2020) for whom a left-over sample from routine biochemistry at the
time of hospital presentation was available were included. All included patients tested

positive for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time polymerase chain reaction, performed in accordance
with WHO guidelines35. Positive PCR results were obtained at time of admission sampling
(median 0 days, range -6 to 2 days for the UZL cohort, range -8 to 0 days for the JESSA
cohort, respectively). The UZL cohort consisted of plasma samples, while the samples
assayed in the JESSA cohort were serum samples. The third sample set is a subset of plasma
samples (n=198, from 97 patients) taken for the CONTAGIOUS observational clinical trial. All
consecutive patients (>18 years old) admitted to the University Hospitals of Leuven between
March 2020 and September 2020 with PCR-confirmed and/or CT-confirmed SARS-CoV-2
disease (confirmation a median of 2 days prior to admission, range 12 days to 1 day prior to
admission) were eligible for inclusion. Samples were taken at the time of admission (within
maximum 48h), at day 7, at the time of hospital discharge and 30 days after hospital
discharge (if available). Patients for whom admission samples were available within the
prospective CONTAGIOUS cohort were excluded from the retrospective UZL cohort.
Clinical measurements
Severity of infection was retrospectively classified on a scale of 1-4 by a single clinician
reviewing individual patient records using the following criteria36,37: 1) Mild cases: mild
clinical symptoms without manifestation of pneumonia on imaging throughout the duration
of disease, 2) Moderate cases: fever, respiratory symptoms, and with radiological findings of
pneumonia at any point during the disease, 3) Severe cases: meeting any one of the
following criteria during the course of their disease: respiratory distress, hypoxia
(SpO2 ≤93%), or abnormal blood gas analysis (PaO2 <60 mmHg, PaCO2 >50 mmHg) or 4)
Critical cases: meeting any one of the following criteria during the course of their disease:

respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, organ failure that requires
intensive unit care or death of the patient due to COVID-19.
In the clinical laboratory of the University Hospital Leuven (UZL patient cohort), routine
laboratory parameters were measured using Roche Cobas 8000 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)
for clinical chemistry parameters and immunoassays, Sysmex XE 5000 (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan)
for hematology parameters and ACL-TOP 700 (Werfen, Milan, Italy) for coagulation tests. In
the clinical laboratory of the Jessa hospital, laboratory parameters were quantified using
Roche Cobas 8000 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for CRP, electrolytes, kidney function, liver
function, triglycerides and ferritin, SYSMEX XN-1500 for hematology parameters, and ACLTOP 550 (Werfen, Milan, Italy) for coagulation tests.
NMR metabolomics
Nightingale Health Ltd’s (Helsinki, Finland) high-throughput 1H NMR metabolomics platform
was used to quantify 251 biomarkers and biomarker ratios. The experimental protocols have
been described elsewhere18,20. The quantified biomarkers include amino acids, lipoprotein,
fatty acids (FA) and triglyceride (TG), in addition to GlycA, creatinine and albumin
concentration, as well as ketone bodies and glycolysis related metabolites. The full list of
biomarkers quantified by NMR is available in Supplementary Table S1. In addition to directly
measured metabolic biomarkers, we also included a composite multi-biomarker
‘Infectious Disease Score’ (IDS), calculated as posited by Julkunen et al. (under review38).
Briefly, this risk score was constructed to associate to the likelihood of severe pneumonia in
eight years of follow-up, using NMR measurements taken in biobank samples.

Differences in demographic and clinical measurements between the study populations were
assessed using a T-test or Mann-Whitney U test, for normally and non-normally distributed
variables respectively, as indicated by a Shapiro-Wilke test for normality. Differences
between the datasets of categorical demographic variables were identified using Fisher’s
exact test on the contingency tables. Association to severity is reported as odds ratios in
univariate cumulative logit ordinal logistic regression on standard deviation (SD) scaled
variables. Where the proportional odds assumption was violated, as indicated by the Brant
test, the ordinal regression was performed three times, i.e. once for each contrast in the
severity scale: contrasting 1) mild versus moderate, severe and critical, 2) mild and moderate
versus severe and critical, and finally 3) mild, moderate and severe versus critical. Correction
for age and sex had minimal impact on the reported associations (data not shown).
Biomarkers with significant association to COVID-19 severity (Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)
adjusted p-value<0.05 in both the UZL and Jessa cohorts), were tested for significant (BH
adjusted p-value<0.05) differences between severe and critical cases in a third independent
cohort (CONTAGIOUS) using a Mann-Whitney U test or Fischer test (for continuous and
categorical variables, respectively). All statistical testing was conducted in R v4.0.239
(additional packages: ordinal40, brant, ggplot241).

Results
Study populations and their differences
We first tested whether there were any significant clinical differences between the two
largest patient cohorts (UZL, n=219 and JESSA, n=164,

Table 1). The demographics of the

cohorts were largely comparable, with the exception of slightly higher prevalences of
diabetes and CVD in the UZL cohort. Several clinical laboratory measurements taken at

admission were also different between the two cohorts: average white blood cell count,
neutrophil count and eosinophil count, as well as CRP levels, ferritin levels and activated
partial thromboplastin time were significantly higher in the Jessa cohort, whereas slightly
higher sodium, potassium and calcium concentrations are noted in the UZL cohort. Some of
these differences could be explained by differences in laboratory settings (e.g. UZL
quantified total calcium, while Jessa quantified ionized calcium) or patient follow-up (UZL did
not consistently quantify ferritin in every sample). We then aimed to identify which
biomarkers consistently associated to COVID-19 severity, despite these differences between
the study cohorts.
Identifying metabolic biomarkers for COVID-19 severity
Using ordinal regression on sd-scaled clinical and NMR measurements, 130 biomarkers were
found to be significantly associated to disease severity in both the UZL and Jessa patient
cohorts (full results in

Supplementary Table S2). At admission, only eight of the measured

demographic and clinical biomarkers were found to be significantly associated to COVID-19
severity in both patient cohorts (age, CVD status, O2 saturation, creatinine and eGFR, CRP,
and lymphocyte and eosinophil count) (Figure 1). Some demographic parameters expected
to associate to severity based on previous reports (e.g. sex, BMI and diabetic status),
trended towards association but fell short of statistical significance in both cohorts
simultaneously.
Of the 251 metabolites and metabolite ratios quantified by NMR, 122 associated with
COVID-19 severity in both cohorts. In line with the clinical associations, NMR evidence of
inflammation (GlycA, albumin, and the GlycA/albumin ratio) and kidney function (creatinine)
showed strong associations with COVID-19 severity (Figure 2). These metrics are important

components of Julkunen et al’s ‘Infectious Disease Score’ (IDS), which can partly explain the
IDS’s strong association to COVID-19 severity (odds ratios of 4 and 4.5 for the UZL and Jessa
cohort, respectively). Of the 9 quantified amino acids, phenylalanine (Phe) and leucine (Leu)
show consistent association to severity. Valine and total branched-chain amino acid
concentrations were associated to severity in the UZL cohort, but not the Jessa cohort. Other
notable associations only observed in a single cohort include glutamine (Gln), tyrosine (Tyr)
and Histidine (His) (Figure 3).
Concentrations and content of analytical lipoprotein subclasses associated well with
COVID-19 severity. Overall, higher lipoprotein concentrations and higher cholesterol content
was associated with less severe disease, with the notable exception of VLDL particles and of
the larger HDL particles. Higher triglyceride content of lipoprotein particles was associated
with disease severity, but only for IDL and LDL (Figure 4). While increased absolute
phospholipid content in HDL, IDL and LDL is associated with less severe disease, this
contrasted to the relative phospholipid to total lipid ratios in HDL, IDL and LDL, which were
associated with higher disease severity. Relative lipoprotein content ratios (including relative
cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, free cholesterol, and triglyceride to total lipid ratios) otherwise
showed

Quantification of FA showed increased poly-unsaturated FA (PUFA) content was associated

showed stronger and more consistent associations with COVID-19 severity than Omega-3 FA.
Both total Omega-3 FA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) showed opposite associations in the

two examined cohorts (OR 0.72 and 0.80 in UZL, OR 1.2 and 1.4 in Jessa, for Omega-3 FA and
DHA ratios to total FA, respectively).
Validation in CONTAGIOUS cohort
To further validate our results, we tested which of the 130 biomarkers that were consistently
associated with severity showed significant differences between severe and critical disease
severity classes in admission samples (n=72) from a third, independent, patient cohort
(CONTAGIOUS, clinical and demographic parameters at admission, comparisons to UZL and
Jessa cohorts,

Supplementary Table S3). In total, 72 severity-associated biomarkers (5

clinical, 68 NMR) showed statistically significant differences at admission between patients
with severe and critical disease (n=48 and n=24, respectively), with strong correlations
between some of the quantified moieties (Figure 6). Selected biomarkers are presented in

Figure 7: albumin, GlycA/albumin ratio and IDS retained their association to disease in the
CONTAGIOUS setting that does not include patients with mild or moderate disease.
Phenylalanine was the only amino acid that retained its significance in this context. Omega-6
FA, PUFA and PUFA/MUFA ratio findings were consistent with our earlier observations.
Again, HDL cholesterol content was significantly lower at admission in the more severe
COVID-19 cases, and this difference was only evident in the small HDL sizes.
Longitudinal associations
For the CONTAGIOUS cohort of severe and critically afflicted patients (n=97), longitudinal
samples were available taken at day 7 post admission (D7, n=38), at hospital discharge
(Dis, n=41), and 30 days post discharge (Dis+30, n=47). Compared to samples taken at
admission, most severity-associated biomarkers worsened at D7, and return to admission
levels at time of hospital discharge (full results in Supplementary Table S4). At 30 days post

discharge, clinical biomarkers for severity (CRP, Ferritin) returned to healthy levels (Figure 8).
Likewise, GlycA as well as the GlycA/albumin ratio dropped below admission levels by day 30
post hospital discharge and returned to concentrations observed in healthy controls
reported in demographic studies38,42. Choline, phosphatidylcholine and phosphoglyceride
concentrations, which were significantly associated to severity (Figure 5), showed no change
during the first seven days of hospitalization and up until discharge, but were found to be
significantly increased 30 days post discharge.

Discussion
We performed the first in-depth characterization of circulating metabolites in SARS-CoV-2
infected patients across the spectrum of disease severity. In left-over diagnostic samples
taken at time of hospital admission of two independent cohorts (n=219 and n=164), we
identified a metabolic profile associated to COVID-19 severity. This metabolic fingerprint of
COVID-19 is relevant to four aspects of COVID-19 related research: first, we provide further
metabolic evidence of the association between COVID-19 severity and inflammation.
Second, our amino acid profiling confirms observations of altered energy requirements of
hyperinflammatory immune cells of COVID-19 patients43,44 and suggests an alternative
explanation for the low occurrence of severe COVID-19 cases in phenylketonuria patients45.
Third, we refine existing reports on the association between lipoprotein particles, their
cholesterol content, and COVID-19 severity15,16 by investigating size-specific lipoprotein
subclasses and their content. Finally, we add to the literature relating COVID-19 severity to
fatty acid concentrations in the blood, and observe an association with linoleic acid that is inline with mechanistic evidence46.

Metabolic evidence of inflammation, i.e. increased GlycA levels and reduced albumin levels,
was associated with increased severity (Figure 2). Many populations reported as high-risk for
developing severe COVID-197 share low-grade chronic inflammation as a common feature13.
Increased GlycA concentrations have been reported in populations with co-morbidities
related to increased risk of severe COVID-197,9 such as advanced age24, diabetes47, obesity48,
and CVD21–23,33. GlycA association to severity is further strengthened by calculating the GlycA
to Albumin ratio (Figure 2). While routine clinical chemistry metrics of acute inflammation
such as CRP and ferritin showed stronger associations to severity than GlycA (Figure 1),
GlycA has higher basal healthy control levels38,42, higher longitudinal stability compared to
CRP49 and is associated with inflammatory disease severity even in CRP negative patients32,
which could be of when investigating the longitudinal effects of COVID-19 (Figure 8).

hyperinflammatory immune cells43 of COVID-19 patients44, our results confirmed higher
serum pyruvate concentration to be associated with increased COVID-19 severity (Figure 2).
The observed associations of amino-acid concentrations with severity could be interpreted
in a similar light (Figure

3): the lower serum glutamine (GLN) concentration in severe

COVID-19 could represent increased GLN catabolism in visceral tissues to accommodate the
energy requirements of hyperinflammatory cells50 through anaplerosis. Our findings suggest
that in mild cases, ongoing branched chain amino acid (BCAA) oxidation contributes to
sufficient availability of GLN, while in severe cases BCAAs accumulate in serum as their
oxidation is inhibited in favor of cytosolic aerobic glycolysis. Other than leucine,
phenylalanine also showed a consistently significant association with COVID-19 severity
(with borderline significance observed for tyrosine, Figure 3). Phenylalanine’s association to

severity is in line with reports of low occurrence of severe COVID-19 outcomes among
phenylketonuria patients, which was previously ascribed to this population’s lower rates of
vitamin D deficiency as a result of the protein substitutes in their diet45.
Our results confirm reports of low lipoprotein particle concentrations of LDL15, HDL, and
their cholesterol content16 in severe COVID-19. However, these early reports were limited
both in the scope of the considered lipoprotein particles (only examining HDL and LDL) and
in the degree to which these particles are characterized (only quantifying their cholesterol
content). The 1H NMR panel assayed in the present study comprehensively characterizes the
range of lipoprotein particle densities and sizes, and provides an in-depth profile of each of
the particle subclasses. We expand on existing observations to show that not all HDL sizes
associate to severity: very large and large HDL particles, and their lipid and cholesterol
content, showed no significant association to severity (Figure 4), while small HDL was among
the strongest and most consistent associations to COVID-19 severity. Decreased small HDL
has been reported to be associated with higher all-cause mortality risk51, though these
findings contrast to associations noted in CVD studies. In the CVD context, large HDL is
inversely associated to CVD risk, while small HDL typically shows no such association52.
Similarly opposite to what is reported in the CVD context, our findings show increased LDL
concentration, as well as its phospholipid and cholesterol content, is associated with
decreased severity. Triglyceride associations to COVID-19 severity are similar to what’s
observed in CVD and diabetes53: high TG levels in IDL, LDL and VLDL and low TG levels in
HDL, though this latter association does not reach significance in our cohorts (Figure 4).
While the altered cholesterol profile of severe COVID-19 can be interpreted as metabolic
evidence of inflammation, it can also be construed as evidence of a genetic predisposition to

severe infection, similar to what’s been shown for HDL cholestrol54. Relevant to the
hyperinflammatory state13 frequently identified as a “cytokine storm” in COVID-1955, a
meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies has shown a genetic link between
cytokine activity and the serum concentration of apolipoprotein B, serum cholesterol and
the cholesterol and phospholipid content of IDL, LDL and VLDL56, all of which are shown to
be lower in severe COVID-19 cases in our results. This interpretation in terms of a
predisposition to severe infection finds additional support in the observed association at
admission between severity and the blood biomarker score for infectious disease risk, which
was constructed by Julkunen et al. from biobank samples to associate to the likelihood of
severe pneumonia and severe COVID-19 during eight years of follow-up38.
Higher relative PUFA content and PUFA to MUFA ratio were consistently associated with
lower severity, in contrast to increased MUFA levels (Figure 5). Linoleic Acid concentration
and total omega-6 fatty acid content (absolute concentration and relative to total FA
content) were lower in severe COVID-19 cases in our cohorts. Conflicting reports exist on
PUFA association with inflammation, and omega-6 FA have been linked to increased
inflammation in the airways57. Considering a recent report showed that linoleic acid (a PU
omega-6 FA) tightly binds to the spike glycoprotein which is used by SARS-CoV-2 to bind the
ACE2 receptor to gain entry into host cells46, the association between less severe COVID-19
and higher omega-6 PUFA levels could therefore be a mechanistic effect, rather than an

phosphoglycerides and choline levels, in agreement with other findings58 (Figure

5).

Furthermore, analysis of longitudinal follow-up samples of severe and critical patients
showed no changes in these concentrations during hospitalization (Figure 8), but a marked
increase of these concentrations was observed in samples taken 30 days after hospital
discharge. This, combined with the convenience with which the 1H NMR spectrum can be
measured and how many of the captured biomarkers are relevant to COVID-19 severity,
leads us to suggest that the NMR analysis technique is well-suited to prospective
longitudinal studies aiming to elucidate the long-term effects of COVID-19.
We point out several strengths and limitations of our study. The studied populations had
significant differences in demographics and clinical characteristics, and differences in sample
type (serum vs plasma) between our two largest cohorts discourage the merging of their
experimental results, even after accounting for the batch effects introduced by differences
in sample handling between the different cohorts. However, this does lend a high degree of
confidence to the results that were consistently observed in all three cohorts. Availability of
longitudinal follow-up samples was limited to the CONTAGIOUS cohort of patients with
severe infection. It is worth noting that, to our knowledge, this is the first study using 1H
NMR metabolomics in severe viral infection. As such, without comparable results from
studies on other infections, we cannot attribute the results reported in this study exclusively
to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We suspect that e.g. a study into the metabolic associations of
severe pneumonia could yield similar results, in light of the strength of the association of
severity with the infectious disease multi-biomarker score from Julkunen et al38. Many of the
associations to severity noted here could be interpreted as general signs of inflammation
and robust correlation network analysis on paired NMR metabolomics, cytokine

quantification and transcriptomics, while contrasting severe COVID-19 to severe (viral)
pneumonia without SARS-CoV-2 infection, would allow for a more fine-grained
interpretation of the results.
COVID-19 is reported to have many diverse effects and complications, many of which can be
related to low-grade inflammation. Our study of systemic metabolic biomarkers reveals that
the metabolic fingerprint of COVID-19 severity consists of a pervasive inflammatory
signature, not unlike reported associations with CVD risk or long-term risk of pneumonia.
The broad range of biomarkers reflects the wide range of COVID-19 symptoms and comorbidities, and these biomarkers should be further investigated for their translational
potential, and their precise role in the COVID-19 pathology.
