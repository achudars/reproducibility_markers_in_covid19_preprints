Abstract:
In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia known as 2019 novel
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. This new type of
pneumonia is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission. Among the
different disease types, cancer patients are often recalled to the hospital for treatment
and disease surveillance, and the majority of cancer treatments such as
chemotherapy and radiotherapy are immunosuppressive. This prompts us to consider
if cancer patients were at an elevated risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
A total of 1,524 cancer patients who were managed at our tertiary cancer
institution – Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University were reviewed during the period
of Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 17, 2020. It was found that cancer patients had an estimated
2-fold increased risk of COVID-19 than the general population. We identified twelve
patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, with two recorded deaths (16.7%),
albeit one patient passed away from a COVID-19 unrelated cause. Interestingly, only
five of these patients were ongoing treatment at the time of contracting the virus,
suggesting that hospital visitation was the likely factor contributing to the elevated
incidence in cancer patients. Moreover, we also observed that the incidence of severe
COVID-19 was not higher than in the general population. Consequently, for cancer
patients who require treatment, proper isolation protocols must be in place to mitigate
the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia known as 2019 novel
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei, China. This new type of
pneumonia is linked to the severe adult respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), and is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission, patients

transmission appears to be the main route of transmission for SARS-CoV-2.2
According to a recent report of 138 hospitalized patients from a single institution
(Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University), it was indicated that hospital-acquired
transmission accounts for 41.3% of these admitted patients (29% were hospital staff
and 12.3% were in-house patients), thereby highlighting that the hospital environment
may be a hotspot for viral spread.3 Among the different disease types, cancer patients
are often recalled to the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance, and therefore,
they may be at an elevated risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the majority of
cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy are immunosuppressive.
Here, we report the incidence and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer
patients who were managed at a tertiary cancer institution in Wuhan.
We collected the data of all patients from Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 17, 2020 (data
cut-off date) who were admitted to the Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology,
Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. In total, 1,524 cancer patients were included
in our study; the three commonest cancer diagnoses were gastrointestinal (N = 394,
35.9%), thoracic (N = 326, 21.4%), and head and neck cancers (N = 204, 13.4%).
Among them, 12 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia (four by the

real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-CoV-2 and
eight by the clinical criteria of fever and radiological computed tomography changes;
Table 1). We estimated that the infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in cancer patients from
our single institution at 0.79% (95% CI = 0.3–1.2). This was higher than the
cumulative incidence of all diagnosed COVID-19 cases that was reported in the city of
Wuhan over the same time-period (0.37%, 41,152/11,081,000 cases, data cutoff on
Feb 17, 2020).
Clinical details on the cancer history and COVID-19 pneumonia are summarized
in Table 1. Among the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, 58.3% (7 of 12) were non-small
cell lung carcinoma patients. Five (41.7%) were on-going treatment with either
chemotherapy +/- immunotherapy (N = 3) or radiotherapy (N = 2; one patient was
undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy). Two patients (0.17%) developed severe
adult respiratory distress syndrome (SARS), but none of the on-treatment patients
required intensive-level care. Four patients (33.3%) have been discharged, and two
deaths were recorded; one patient died from a COVID-19 unrelated cause.
It is hypothesized that cancer patients may be susceptible to an infection during
a viral epidemic due to their compromised immune status, which may be induced by
the treatment of the cancer.

Based on our single institution data, we observed that

cancer patients from the epicenter of a viral epidemic indeed harbor a higher risk of
SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 1.89-3.02) when compared to the
general community. Nonetheless, only less than half of these infected patients were
undergoing active treatment for their cancers. It is arguable that a third of the patients

were terminally admitted for best supportive measures, and these patients are likely
immunosuppressed. Regardless, our findings do imply that hospital admission and
recurrent hospital visits are potential risks for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and these
factors may account for the increased incidence among cancer patients. We therefore
propose that aggressive measures are undertaken to reduce frequency of hospital
visits during a viral epidemic going forward. For cancer patients who require treatment,
proper isolation protocols must be in place to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2
infection.
