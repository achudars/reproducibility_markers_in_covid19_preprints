Abstract

2

Objectives

3

The four seasonal coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 are frequent causes of respiratory infections and

4

show annual and seasonal variation. Increased understanding about these patterns could be informative about

5

the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.

6

Methods

7

Results from PCR diagnostics for the seasonal coronaviruses, and other respiratory viruses, were obtained for

8

55,190 clinical samples analysed at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, between 14

9

September 2009 and 2 April 2020.

10

Results

11

Seasonal coronaviruses were detected in 2,130 samples (3.9%) and constituted 8.1% of all virus detections.

12

OC43 was most commonly detected (28.4% of detections), followed by NL63 (24.0%), HKU1 (17.6%), and 229E

13

(15.3%). The overall fraction of positive samples was similar between seasons, but at species level there were

14

distinct biennial alternating peak seasons for the Alphacoronaviruses, 229E and NL63, and the

15

Betacoronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1, respectively. The Betacoronaviruses peaked earlier in the winter season

16

(Dec-Jan) than the Alphacoronaviruses (Feb-Mar). Coronaviruses were detected across all ages, but diagnostics

17

were more frequently requested for paediatric patients than adults and the elderly. OC43 and 229E incidence

18

was relatively constant across age strata, while that of NL63 and HKU1 decreased with age.

19

Conclusions

20

Both the Alphacoronaviruses and Betacoronaviruses showed alternating biennial winter incidence peaks, which

21

suggests some type of immune mediated interaction. Symptomatic reinfections in adults and the elderly

22

appear relatively common. Both findings may be of relevance for the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

24

The world is seeing a pandemic by a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of the disease COVID-19.

25

The pandemic has unprecedented effects on societies globally. Although SARS-CoV-2 is new to mankind, six

26

other coronaviruses are known to infect humans. This includes the four seasonal coronaviruses (CoVs): 229E,

27

NL63, OC43 and HKU1, which are found globally and in immunocompetent hosts usually cause mild to

28

moderate upper-respiratory tract disease [1-5]. In contrast, infections with two other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV

29

and MERS-CoV, have severe clinical presentation and substantial mortality [6]. The human coronaviruses are

30

found in two genera of the subfamily orthocoronavirinae. The genus Alphacoronavirus includes 229E and NL63,

31

whereas the genus Betacoronavirus includes OC43 and HKU1 (subgenus Embecovirus), SARS-CoV and SARS-

32

CoV-2 (subgenus Sarbecovirus), and MERS-CoV (subgenus Merbecovirus) [7].

33

Here we use results from routine clinical diagnostic tests on approximately 55,000 patient samples to analyze

34

the epidemiology of the seasonal CoVs in Stockholm, Sweden. Better knowledge about the epidemiology of the

35

seasonal CoVs could potentially inform about the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.

36

Methods

37

Samples and metadata

38

Data from routine diagnostics were obtained from the laboratory information system at the Department of

39

Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. The majority of samples analyzed

40

were obtained from the Stockholm Region (2.2 million inhabitants), where the laboratory provides diagnostic

41

services to six of seven major hospitals, and outpatient care to approximately to half of the population. PCR

42

diagnostics for the seasonal CoVs were performed using accredited in-house assays [8] or the Allplex

43

Respiratory Panels 2 and 3 (Seegene Inc., Seoul (South Korea)), see supplement for details on virus diagnostics.

44

The associated metadata contained the laboratory results, date of sample collection, specimen type, age and

45

sex of the patient. The study was reviewed and approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (registration

46

no. 2020-03001).

47

Statistical analyses

48

Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp LLC, College Station (TX, USA)). Point

49

estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of proportions and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using logistic

50

regression with 200 bootstrap replications. To avoid selection bias, odds ratio for co-detections were calculated

51

across the subset of samples with complete records and at least detection of one respiratory pathogen [9].

52

Results

53

Basic characteristics of samples and results from CoVs diagnostics

54

During 14 September 2009 until 2 April 2020, a total of 135,922 samples were obtained for respiratory virus

55

diagnostics. Of these, 55,190 samples had been analyzed for an extended virus panel which included the four

56

seasonal CoVs. There were 2153 detections of seasonal CoVs in 2,130 of the 55,190 samples (3.9%; 95% CI:

57

3.7%-4.0%), representing 8.1% (95% CI: 7.7%-8.4%) of all virus detections. The annual number of CoV-positive

58

samples increased over the study period as a result of increased testing, but the fraction of positive samples

59

decreased (Figure 1A and B, respectively). Among the 2,130 CoV-positive samples the most common species

60

detected was OC43 (28.4%), followed by NL63 (24.0%), HKU1 (17.6%), and 229E (15.3%). In addition, 15.9% of

61

the CoV-positive samples were positive for OC43/HKU1 in the Allplex assay, which does not distinguish

62

between the two. In 23 samples (1.1% of all positive samples), two different species of CoVs were detected.

63

Information about the sex of the patients was available for 55,102 samples (99.8%). CoV-positive results were

64

significantly more common in men (55.1% of positive samples, 95% CI: 54.7%-55.5%, OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.06-

65

1.26).

66

Alternating biennial incidence and peak incidence month of seasonal CoVs

67

The number of samples analyzed for CoVs (and other respiratory viruses) showed seasonal variation with peaks

68

in the winters (Figure 1A). The number of CoV positive samples showed even more pronounced winter peaks.

69

The overall fraction of samples positive for any species did not show any marked season-to-season variation

70

across the duration of the study (Figure 1B). This is in stark contrast to the incidence of detection of the four

71

CoV species, which all showed distinct biennial patterns (Figure 2). Interestingly, a pattern of alternating peak

72

seasons was observed for the two Alphacoronaviruses, 229E and NL63. This pattern was even more striking for

73

the two Betacoronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1. Due to the biennial alternating patterns, 229E and HKU1 had peak

74

incidence in winter seasons starting in odd number years (2009/2010, 2011/2012, etc), whereas NL63 and

75

OC43 peaked in seasons starting in even number years (2010/2011, 2012/2013, etc).

76

Next, we investigated the variation of CoV detections over the calendar year by averaging over the entire study

77

period. When all four species were combined, the lowest activity was observed from July to October. There

78

was a steep increase in CoV detections in November, and a peak in December. However, the peaks for the

79

individual species occurred in different months (Figure 3).

80

In summary, there were two patterns in the incidence of the four species of seasonal CoVs appeared to show

81

two different types of interactions. Firstly, both the two Alphacoronaviruses (229E and NL63) and the two

82

Betacoronaviruses (OC43 and HKU1) peaked in alternating seasons. Secondly, the Betacoronaviruses peaked

83

earlier in the winter season than the Alphacoronaviruses.

84

Infections with seasonal CoV across age strata

85

Information about the age of patients with CoV-positive results was available for 55,063 (99.8%) samples. For

86

age strata with patients younger than 20 years, more than 60% of samples had been analyzed with the

87

extended respiratory virus panel, which included the seasonal CoVs. In contrast, less than 40% of samples were

88

tested for CoVs in all the older age strata, and in particular the oldest patients (≥90 years) (Figure 4A). The

89

fraction of samples positive for any CoV was highest in the two youngest age strata and was the lowest in the

90

age stratum 80-89 years; however, it is important to note that CoV infections were diagnosed in all age strata

91

(Figure 4A). The fractions of positive samples in the different age strata also showed some variation over

92

seasons (supplement figures S1 and S2). We separately investigated the age distributions of each of four CoV

93

species (Figure 4B-E, and supplement figures S1, S2). NL63 and HKU1 showed a tendency to decline with age,

94

while detection of 229E and OC43 was more similar across the age strata.

95

Co-detection of CoVs with other respiratory viruses

96

Of 2,130 samples positive for any CoV, matched results for analyses of the full panel of other respiratory

97

viruses were obtained for 1,953 samples. At least one additional respiratory virus was identified in 737 samples

98

(34.6%, 95% CI: 32.6-36.7%), and two or more other respiratory viruses were identified in 128 samples (6.0%,

99

95% CI: 5.0-7.1%). Co-detections were most common in the two youngest age strata (0-1 and 2-5 years),

100

accounting for 76.1% of samples positive for CoV and a co-detected virus. The four viruses that were most

101

commonly co-detected with CoVs were: RSV (9.2%), RV (7.2%), BoV (6.8%) and AdV (4.7%) (Figure S3); the co-

102

detections appeared less common than expected by chance. Thus, the odds ratio was significantly reduced for

103

co-detection of CoVs with RSV (0.56, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.66) and AdV (0.52, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.66), and non-

104

significantly reduced for RV 0.83 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.12) and BoV 0.95 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.15). However, more than

105

half (59.4%) of the samples were submitted for analysis IAV, IBV, and RSV only. In these samples, IAV was

106

detected in 14.6% of samples, compared to detection of IAV in 4.6% of samples with request for the extended

107

respiratory virus panel. Thus, co-detection of the seasonal CoVs with RSV and the influenza viruses might be

108

underrepresented in this material due to selection bias.

109

Discussion

110

In this study we comprehensively have investigated the epidemiology of the four seasonal coronaviruses (229E,

111

NL63, OC43, and HKU1) using PCR results from more than 55,000 clinical samples analyzed 2009–2020 in

112

Stockholm, Sweden. We found that CoV infections were detected in around 4% of samples, but due to

113

considerable seasonal variation the proportion positive samples varied from <1% in Aug–Sept, to close to 8% in

114

Dec–Jan. All four seasonal CoVs showed biennial winter incidence peaks, with alternating peak seasons for the

115

two Alphacoronaviruses, 229E and NL63, and the two Betacoronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1, respectively. This

116

novel finding suggests some type of immunological interaction or interference. The fraction of CoV-positive

117

samples was the highest among children aged 0-5 years, but infections occurred in all age strata, which

118

suggests that symptomatic reinfections among adults and the elderly are not uncommon. Our results

119

concerning the epidemiology of seasonal CoVs have implications for the likely future endemic presence of

120

SARS-CoV-2 and extend the knowledge gained by earlier studies [9-11].

121

We report that the four species of seasonal CoVs appeared to show two different types of interactions. Firstly,

122

both the Alphacoronaviruses (229E and NL63) and the Betacoronaviruses (OC43 and HKU1), respectively,

123

peaked in alternating winter seasons. Secondly, the circulation of the Betacoronaviruses peaked earlier in the

124

winter season than that of the Alphacoronaviruses. The biennial pattern of the seasonal CoVs that we report is

125

in line with earlier reports from the temperate zone of the Northern Hemispere [1, 4, 11-13]. Importantly,

126

these studies also found that Alphacoronaviruses and Betacoronaviruses, respectively, tended to peak in

127

alternating seasons, matching our findings. However, only Kissler et al. [11] and Nickbakhsh et al. [9] make a

128

point of this finding and draw inference about possible immunological interactions and their implications for

129

the future of SARS-CoV-2, but the studies did not include Alphacoronaviruses or HKU1, respectively. Thus, we

130

extend their findings by showing that the both genera show similar interactions, which indicates that this is a

131

general property of CoVs. Furthermore, it is reassuring that the biennial alternating pattern is found in different

132

continents and countries in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere, as this indicates that the

133

interactions are not a local phenomenon in our study setting in Stockholm, Sweden. It should be noted that the

134

effect may be limited to the temperate zone as biennial seasonality is not noted in a study from southern China

135

[2].

136

The alternating biennial cycles of the two Alphacoronaviruses and the two Betacoronaviruses warrants further

137

investigation. It could be a chance event, but more likely is due to some type of anti-phase synchronization

138

[31], which could be generated even by weak cross-immunity. With regard to immunity, although IgG

139

antibodies against CoVs are present in almost all adult individuals [14], early studies showed that CoV

140

infections commonly occur despite a prior presence of neutralizing antibodies [13, 15, 16]. Moreover, a

141

substantial number of reinfections of NL63 were detected in a recent study with repeated sampling over a

142

season in community setting [17]. Indications of frequent reinfections with all four seasonal coronaviruses

143

were also provided by a recent serological study from the Netherlands [18], as did our study, with infections

144

occurring in all age groups. Immunologic interaction between the seasonal CoVs has been suggested as a cause

145

of the dominance of NL63 and OC43 in infants [19].

146

The prevalence of seasonal CoV infection worldwide and possibility of immunological interference by seasonal

147

CoVs with each other has raised hopes of potential protective effects against SARS-CoV-2-infection or

148

modulation of COVID-19 disease [20]. However, despite the presence of cross-reactive binding antibodies

149

between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, cross-neutralization appears to be rare [21], even though these viruses are

150

relatively closely related. All of these findings are interesting in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,

151

because T-cells reactive to SARS-CoV-2 have been detected in samples from donors sampled before the

152

pandemic [22, 23], as well as in seronegative exposed persons [24]. This could possibly be due to cross-

153

immunity between the seasonal CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 [9, 11].

154

As we find a higher prevalence of seasonal CoV infections in younger age groups, recent seasonal CoV infection

155

and some level of cross-reactive immunity with SARS-CoV-2 might at least partially explain the apparently

156

lower attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 in young children compared to older persons [25, 26]. At the same time,

157

reinfection by seasonal CoVs clearly occurs throughout life and any potential cross-protection might be short-

158

lived [18], implying that the magnitude of the cross-protective effect might be small.

159

We found that OC43 was the species that was most commonly detected, which is in line with earlier studies [1-

160

4, 9, 12, 27, 28]. The odds ratio for positive samples in our study was significantly lower for females than males.

161

This gender difference is interesting in relation to COVID-19, as male patients have a higher risk of severe

162

disease and death than females [29, 30]. We noted CoV infections across all age strata, although the highest

163

prevalence was observed among children. Collectively, our results indicate that symptomatic CoV reinfections

164

among adults and elderly are not uncommon, though we did not formally exclude the possibility that they had

165

primary CoV infections through serological testing.

166

Our study has some limitations. In particular, it is a retrospective study that utilizes results from routine clinical

167

diagnostics. It is difficult to exclude that there have been changes in the strategies and prioritization for

168

diagnostics of respiratory infections over the study period. For example, there have been some changes in the

169

platforms used for virus diagnostics during the study period that may have modified the sensitivity of CoVs

170

detection. Also, information about clinical presentation and disease severity were not available. However, all

171

samples were from clinical diagnostics, which means that the symptoms were severe enough to prompt

172

sampling. Another limitation is that more than half of the adults were tested only for IAV, IBV, and RSV, and not

173

the full virus panel. It is likely that CoV infections have been underdiagnosed among the adults and the elderly

174

because they were not tested for. The main strengths of the study are the large sample size and the long study

175

period.

176

To conclude, the notable yearly alternation within genera, and the temporal spacing in peaks between genera,

177

suggest a possible immunological interaction or interference. We further identify a distinct difference in the

178

timing of the seasonal peaks, with the Alphacoronaviruses peaking months after the Dec-Jan peak observed for

179

the Betacoronaviruses. Our findings have implications both for better understanding seasonality and

180

interaction in coronaviruses generally and for the likely future endemic presence of SARS-CoV-2, and thus merit

181

further immunological studies.
