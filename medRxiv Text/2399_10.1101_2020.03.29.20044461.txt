Abstract:
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan,
China and has resulted in the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic. As of March 1, 2020, 79,968 patients
in China and 7169 outside of China had tested positive for COVID-19 and a mortality rate of 3.6%
has been observed amongst Chinese patients. Its primary mode of transmission is via respiratory
droplets from coughs and sneezes. The virus can remain viable for up to three days on plastic and
stainless steel or in aerosols for upto 3 hours and is relatively more stable than the known human
coronaviruses. It is stable in faeces at room temperature for at least 1-2 days and can be stable in
infected patients for up to 4 days. Heat at 56°C kills the SARS coronavirus at around 10000 units
per 15 minutes. Thus, temperature is an important factor in survival of COVID-19 virus and this
article focuses on understanding the relationship between temperature and COVID-19
transmission from the data available between January-March 2020.

Temperature changes and COVID-19 transmission.
Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. Ever since, the disease was first identified
in 2019 in Wuhan, China, it has spread worldwide quickly. The World Health Organization
(WHO) declared the 2019-2020 coronavirus outbreak a pandemic and a Public Health Emergency
of International Concern (PHEIC). As of March 20, 2020, more than 240,000 cases have been
reported, and more 10,000 people have lost their lives [2]. When the SARS outbreak happened in
2002-2003, SARS-CoV spread to approximately 30 countries only [3]. However, the current
outbreak of COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2 has spread to 176 countries or territories which suggests
the enhanced ability of viruses to be aerosolized [2]. Environmental factors such as atmospheric
temperature modulates the survival and spread of virus aerosols. It was shown that survival of

influenza viral aerosols is reduced at higher temperatures [4]. In this study, we aimed to ascertain
the relation between atmospheric temperatures and the COVID-19 disease recovery rates across
the globe.
Methods:
i) Data Collection:
The data used in this study comes from Chinese medical community website DXY
reporting COVID-19 cases at the province level in China [5]. The data for countries and regions
outside mainland China is collected from an interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19
in real time [6]. DXY updates case counts every 15 minutes in all provinces in China while other
countries' case counts are manually updated in a web-based dashboard from centres for disease
control and prevention (CDC) of Taiwan, Europe, the World Health Organization (WHO), the
government of Canada, and the Australian government [6].
ii) Regression for understanding correlations:
The location of confirmed, death and recovered cases was obtained from the coordinate
points through NGS coordinate conversion and transformation tool (NCAT) [7]. The respective
temperature information for each location was obtained from Raspisaniye Pogodi (RP)
temperature channel, Petersburg, Russia having license for the activity in hydrometeorology and
adjacent fields. The website provides six day temperature forecasts and information on the actual
temperature, observed at ground stations where the forecasts are completely updated twice a day
(05:30 and 17:30 UTC) [8]. Temperature reports were downloaded for each location for the day
range of 01/22/2020-03/16/2020 which were correlated with the number of confirmed positive
cases, deaths and recoveries. The ggpairs() function from the GGally package was used to create
a plot matrix to see how the variables relate to each other [9]. The coefficient errors provide a
variation of the estimated coefficients from the actual average while the t-value measures how
many standard deviations the estimated coefficient is from zero. Residuals describe how well does
the model fit the data and a bell curve distribution is an ideal for any linear fit [10]. Residuals,
coefficients, degrees of freedom, R-squared and F-statistic values are provided in Table 1.
Results:
i. Countries including China, Iran, Italy, Germany and France showed maximum impact
with COVID-19 transmission and morbidity:
The data retrieved from 01/22/2020-03/16/2020 showed 81033 confirmed positive cases
of COVID-19 infection in China, 27980 in Italy, 7272 in Germany, 6650 in France and 14991

cases in Iran (Figure 1 & supplementary file 1). In the same period of time, China reported 3217
deaths, while France, Iran, Italy and Spain reported 148, 853, 2158, and 342 deaths respectively
(Figure 2 & supplementary file 1). China, Italy and Iran were highly impacted by COVID-19
mortality. A speedy recovery was also seen in China with 67910 cases, while Iran and Italy with
4590 and 2749 cases recovered by 03/16/2020 (Figure 3 & supplementary file 1). Hubei province
in China was hit worse with 3099 deaths followed by Henan and Heilongjiang provinces with 22
and 13 deaths respectively (Figure 4, Left), while the state of California was severely affected in
the United States of America (US) with 7 deaths reported (Figure 4, Right).
ii. Changes in temperature shows no significant correlation with cases transmitted, deaths
or recovered:
Linear regression describes the relationship between a response variable of interest and one
or more predictor variables by separating the signal from the noise [11]. Correlation analysis
between temperatures, cases confirmed positive, dead and recovered was performed separately for
overall countries in the month of January, February and March of 2020. For cases confirmed
positive, dead and recovered, a total number of cases was used as a variable value while an average
of temperature (degree celsius (°C)) for each of the months was used as a variable temperature
value. Comparing overall cases for temperature, no significant correlation between temperatures
and cases confirmed positive, dead or recovered was observed (Figure 5A), however, a strong
correlation (~0.9) was observed between cases confirmed and deaths for each of the three months.
To further investigate effects of temperature, country (Australia) with highest average temperature
(January~18°C, February~17°C, March~16°C) was compared separately with the country
(Canada) with lowest average temperature (January~-3°C, February~-5°C, March~-2°C) for the
month of March 2020 (Figure 5B: Top Left and Top Right). Again, no significant correlation
between temperatures and cases confirmed positive, dead or recovered was observed, however, an
interesting correlation pattern was seen where a drop in correlation (~0.5) was found between cases
confirmed and recovered in Australia and a drop in correlation (~0.3) was found between cases
confirmed and deaths in Canada. China being the earliest and highly affected country with
COVID-19 transmission, separate correlation plots were generated between temperatures and
cases confirmed positive, dead or recovered for the months January-March 2020 (Figure 5B:
Bottom Left, Bottom Right; Figure 5C: Left). While no significant correlation between
temperatures and cases confirmed positive, dead or recovered was observed, a strong correlation
between cases confirmed and recovered (~0.9), and cases confirmed and deaths (~1) was recorded.
Finally, a correlation matrix (Figure 5C: Right) for the month of March 2020 for the US was
generated and again no significant correlations were observed between any of the selected
variables.
iii. Regression model predicts rise in number of deaths in China, US Australia and Canada:

A multiple regression analysis was performed to create a model for predicting deaths from
cases confirmed and an average temperature of certain locations. A strong correlation between
cases confirmed with deaths and cases confirmed with recovered was observed, so a robust
regression model was expected. Although, we found insignificant correlations between
temperatures and cases confirmed positive, dead or recovered, considering it as one of the variables
in multiple regression model won't make a significant difference. A significant P value and F score
was obtained (Table 1 and Figure 6: Left) stating robustness of the generated model. For the month
of March 2020, Australia reported a total of 377, Canada reported 415, China reported 81033 and
the US reported a total 4632 confirmed positive cases. The average temperatures of Australia,
Canada, China, and the US in March was ~16, -0.2, 8.4 and 9.2°C respectively. Considering a 1°C
rise on each of these temperatures for April 2020 and combining them with their respective
confirmed positive case numbers for March 2020, predictions for the number of deaths were made
from the regression model (Figure 6: Right).
Discussion:
Data analyzed from 01/22/2020-03/16/2020 for COVID-19 confirmed positive, death and
recovered cases identify an increasing number of cases being recovered (~83%) especially in
China, while Iran and Italy showed a slow recovery with 30% and 37% recovery rates respectively.
China reported the highest percent deaths (~3.96%) in the world. Although a strong correlation
between cases confirmed with recovered, and cases confirmed with deaths was observed, changes
in temperature showed no significant correlation with cases transmitted, deaths or recovered for
the period 01/22/2020-03/16/2020. However, an interesting finding was observed wherein a drop
in correlation was found between cases confirmed with recovered in Australia (average
temperature ~16°C) and cases confirmed with deaths in Canada (average temperature ~-2°C).
Finally, a multiple regression model was generated using predicted April 2020 temperatures with
confirmed positive cases for March 2020 for Australia, Canada, China, and the US to predict the
number of deaths in April 2020. The generated model predicted ~14, 16, 3972 and 223 more deaths
for countries Australia, Canada, China, and the US respectively. This data and model signifies
urgency of confining COVID-19’s pandemic spread with the predicted rise in number of deaths.
