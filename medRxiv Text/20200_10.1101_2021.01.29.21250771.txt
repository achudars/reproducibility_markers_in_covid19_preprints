ABSTRACT
SARS-CoV-2 represents an unprecedented public health challenge with many unknowns remaining

51

regarding the factors that impact viral pathogenicity and the development of immunity after infection.

52

While the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 resolve their

53

infection with few complications, a significant number of individuals experienced prolonged symptoms

54

lasting for weeks after initial diagnosis. Persistent viral infections are commonly accompanied by

55

immunologic dysregulation, especially within the cellular immune compartment. However, it is unclear

56

if persistent mild-to-moderate COVID-19 impacts the development of virus-specific cellular immunity.

57

To this end, we analyzed the development of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity in convalescent

58

COVID-19 patients who experienced eight days or fewer of COVID-19 symptoms, or symptoms

59

persisting for 18 days or more. We observed that the duration of COVID-19 symptoms minimally

60

impacts the magnitude, antigen specificity, and transcriptional profile of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular

61

immunity within both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell compartments. Furthermore, we observed that

62

reactivity against the structural N protein from SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent COVID-19 patients

63

correlates with the amount of reactivity against the seasonal human coronaviruses 229E and NL63.

64

These results provide additional insight into the complex processes that regulate the development of

65

cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and related human coronaviruses.

INTRODUCTION

73

SARS-CoV-2 is a recently emerged novel single-stranded RNA virus that was initially identified as the

74

causative agent of a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China in early December, 2019 [1-3]. This initial

75

outbreak has since developed into an unprecedented world-wide pandemic, resulting in an estimated 96

76

million infections and 2 million deaths as of January 2021 . The multi-faceted illness associated with

77

SARS-CoV-2 infection – COVID-19 – is characterized by inflammation of the respiratory tract, fever,

78

musculoskeletal pain, and cough [4-6]. While SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity is

79

evident in the majority of patients following the resolution of acute infection and appears to persist for at

80

least 6-8 months [7, 8], the role of this adaptive immune response in regulating viral replication and

81

disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Furthermore, little is known about how variations in the complex

82

clinical manifestations of COVID-19 impact the development of SARS-CoV-2 specific immunologic

83

memory.

84
85

A notable feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection is that COVID-19 symptoms can persist for weeks or

86

months after initial manifestation even in patients not requiring hospitalization or other medical

87

interventions [9, 10]. This is especially evident in older adults with underlying chronic medical

88

conditions but has been extensively documented in patients across a wide age range [10]. Even in young

89

adults, nearly 20% of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection fail to return to full normal daily

90

activities 14-21 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and/or a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in an

91

outpatient setting [11]. Although replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 has been difficult to detect in

92

individuals with protracted COVID-19 symptoms, recovered patients continue to shed detectable SARS-

93

CoV-2 RNA in their upper respiratory tract and in their stool for weeks after initial diagnosis [12-14].

94

Furthermore, indirect immunologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antigen persistence has been observed,

95

most notably reflected in the maturation profile of SARS-CoV-2 specific memory B cells [15].

96
97

The presence of persistent viral antigen and/or infection-attendant inflammation is associated with

98

immune dysregulation in many viral infections [16]. This is most prominently manifested within the

99

cellular immune compartment where persistent antigen stimulation and/or inflammatory cytokine

100

exposure can lead to a progressive loss of T cell effector function and suppression of pathogen-specific

101

cellular immunity [17, 18]. While this phenomenon has been well documented in chronic viral diseases

102

such as HBV/HCV and HIV [18], it is currently unclear if the persistence of mild-to-moderate COVID-

103

19 symptoms is associated with the development of a dysfunctional or sub-optimal cellular immune

104

response.

105
106

To fill this knowledge gap, we examined the relationship between the duration of COVID-19 symptoms

107

and the magnitude and functional profile of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity in individuals

108

recently recovered from mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Using an IFN-γ ELISPOT assay, we observed

109

that patients with protracted COVID-19 symptoms exhibited similar levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific

110

cellular immunity overall as individuals who rapidly resolved their symptoms; although prolonged

111

COVID-19 symptoms were associated with slightly elevated responses against SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a

112

and ORF7a. Furthermore, no defect was observed in the magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike specific

113

CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response in individuals with prolonged COVID-19 symptoms when assessed

114

using flow cytometry, and the transcriptional profile of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 T cells was observed

115

not to be impacted by the duration of COVID-19 symptoms. Finally, while significant levels of cellular

116

immunity against the seasonal human coronaviruses 229E and NL63 were observed in all convalescent

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.29.21250771; this version posted February 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

117

COVID-19 patients analyzed in the study, the magnitude of this immune response did not correlate with

118

the duration of COVID-19 symptoms. However, a significant negative correlation was observed

119

between patient age and the overall magnitude of 229E/NL63 reactivity across all donors, and the level

120

of 229E and NL63 Spike reactivity did correlate with reactivity against the structural N protein from

121

SARS-CoV-2. These data suggest that prolonged symptomatic COVID-19 does not significantly impact

122

the development of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity or cellular immunity against related

123

seasonal human coronaviruses in patients with mild/moderate disease, but that prior infection with

124

seasonal human betacoronaviruses may selectively influence the development of N specific SARS-CoV-

125

2 cellular immunity.

RESULTS

141

Convalescent COVID-19 patient selection and characterization. The objective of this study was to

142

determine the impact of COVID-19 symptom duration on the magnitude and functional profile of

143

SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity. To this end, subjects were identified within the SUNY Upstate

144

Convalescent COVID-19 Plasma Donor protocol who experienced a PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2

145

infection and from whom PBMC were obtained 14 to 30 days following the resolution of COVID-19

146

associated symptoms (Figure 1A). A total of 84 subjects were identified within the parental protocol

147

who fulfilled these selection criteria, of which 33 were selected for further analysis (Table 1). Within

148

this group of 33 donors, 14 subjects were classified as having a “short” period of COVID-19 associated

149

symptoms (0-8 days), while 19 subjects were classified as having a “long” duration of COVID-19

150

associated symptoms (18-61 days). No correlation was observed between subject age and the duration of

151

self-reported COVID-19 symptoms (Figure 1B), and all subjects were otherwise healthy at the time of

152

PBMC collection.

154

Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity stratified by COVID-19 symptom duration.

155

To determine if the magnitude and antigen-specificity of SARS-CoV-2 elicited cellular immunity is

156

impacted by the duration of COVID-19 symptoms, PBMC from the 33 subjects selected above were

157

analyzed using an IFN-γ ELISPOT assay. Overlapping peptide pools spanning the Spike, N, M, ORF3a,

158

and ORF7a proteins from SARS-CoV-2 were used in this analysis (Supplemental Table 1). SARS-

159

CoV-2 specific cellular immunity – defined as a subject having more than 50 IFN-γ producing SARS-

160

CoV-2 specific cells per 106 PBMC - was observed in 85.7% (13/14) of subjects classified as having a

161

short duration of COVID-19 symptoms, while 94.7% (18/19) of subjects with a long duration of

162

COVID-19 symptoms exhibited a positive response (Table 1). However, no difference in the total

163

SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immune response was observed between these two groups when stratified

164

by the duration of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms (Figure 2A, Supplemental Figure 1). When

165

further stratified by viral antigen, no difference in the level of reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 Spike, N,

166

and M was observed between individuals with either a short or long duration of COVID-19 symptoms

167

(Figure 2B). A statistically significant higher level of ORF3a and OFR7a reactivity was observed in

168

individuals with longer periods of COVID-19 symptoms than in individuals with a short period of

169

COVID-19 associated symptoms (Figure 2B), but most of these responses fell under the 50 SFC/106

170

PBMC threshold for positivity (Table 1).

171
172

To further define the profile of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity and how it stratifies by

173

COVID-19 symptom duration, we assessed the multi-parametric antigen reactivity pattern captured in

174

our ELISPOT analysis. Most individuals included in this analysis exhibited cellular immunity against

175

two-or-more SARS-CoV-2 antigens, with 71.3% of individuals with a short period of COVID-19

176

symptoms and 68.4% of individuals that experienced a long period of COVID symptoms exhibiting a

177

multivalent antigen response (Figure 2C). The most common multi-antigen reactivity pattern observed

178

in individuals with a short duration of COVID-19 symptoms was a trivalent response against SARS-

179

CoV-2 Spike, N, and M proteins (Figure 3C). In contrast, the most common antigen reactivity pattern

180

observed in individuals with a long duration of COVID-19 symptoms was a tetravalent response against

181

SARS-CoV-2 Spike, N, M and ORF3a.

186

prolonged symptoms) that were determined to have high levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular

187

immunity were stimulated with a SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein peptide pool and the level of SARS-CoV-

188

2 specific cellular immunity quantified by flow cytometry. SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD8+ and CD4+ T

189

cells were identified by their respective upregulation of CD25/CD69 or CD134/CD69 following peptide

190

stimulation. A robust population of SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD8+ T cells were identified in the subjects

191

selected for analysis (Figure 3A, Supplemental Figure 2), although the abundance of these cells did

192

not significantly differ when stratified by the duration of COVID-19 symptoms (Figure 3B). The

193

magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein specific cellular immunity measured by IFN-γ ELISPOT

194

correlated well with the CD8+ T cell SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity as quantified by flow

195

cytometry (Figure 3C). In addition to this SARS-Cov-2 Spike protein specific CD8+ T cell response, a

196

quantifiably more robust CD4+ T cell response was observed in all donors (Figure 3A, Supplemental

197

Figure 2), with most subjects exhibiting a ~50% higher frequency of SARS-CoV-2 Spike reactive CD4

198

T cells than CD8 T cells (Supplemental Figure 3). Again, the overall magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2

199

specific CD4+ T cell response was not impacted by the duration of COVID-19 symptoms. However,

200

there was a very poor correlation between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein specific CD4+ T cell response as

201

quantified by flow cytometry and the SARs-CoV-2 Spike reactivity as quantified by IFN-γ ELISPOT,

202

highlighting the differential utility of the two assays.

Transcriptional characterization of SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD4+ T cells. Persistent antigen

simulation is known to result in transcriptional- and functional-dysregulation of pathogen-specific T

cells and loss of effector function [19]. While no significant difference in the abundance of SARS-CoV-

207

2 reactive CD4 and CD8 T cells were noted in the convalescent COVID-19 patients included in this

208

study when stratified by symptom duration, we wished to confirm that the functional transcriptional

209

profile of SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD4+ T cells was not negatively impaired in individuals experiencing

210

prolonged COVID-19 symptoms. Therefore, we sorted SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein reactive CD4 T cells

211

from the 10 donors highlighted above and subjected them to transcriptional profiling. An average of

212

2,322 SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD4+ T cells were isolated from each donor (range 106 – 4,497) and were

213

subjected to mRNA sequencing analysis.

214
215

As expected, the cells recovered in this analysis expressed high levels of canonical CD4+ T cell gene

216

products (CD3E, CD4, CD40LG) along with the activation markers used to identify/isolate the cell in

217

the flow cytometry assay (Figure 4A). The sorted SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4+ T cells expressed high

218

levels of canonical Th1-assocaited gene products (IFNG, TNF, TBX21), but appreciably lower levels of

219

Th2/Th17 associated transcripts (Figure 4B). However, no differentially expressed genes were

220

identified between the samples when segregated by symptom duration, and no appreciable difference

221

was observed in the global transcriptional profile between the two groups (Figure 4B). These results

222

suggest that the duration of COVID-19 symptoms minimally impacts the resultant transcriptional profile

223

of SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD4+ T cells in patients recently recovered from mild/moderate COVID-19.

224
225

Persistent COVID-19 symptoms do not correlate with seasonal coronavirus reactivity. Cellular

226

immunity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens has been observed in PBMC samples collected prior to the

227

emergence of the virus in December 2019 [19-21]. This has been primarily attributed to cross-reactive

228

cellular immunity elicited by seasonal human coronaviruses such as 229E and NL63 which widely

229

circulate and share some degree of antigen similarity with SARS-CoV-2 [19]. While the impact of pre-

230

existing/cross-reactive cellular immunity on the clinical progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains

231

unclear, we endeavored to determine if the presence of seasonal human coronavirus specific cellular

232

immunity in convalescent COVID-19 patients correlated with the duration of self-reported symptoms,

233

and if the magnitude of seasonal human coronavirus cellular immunity correlated with SARS-CoV-2

234

specific cellular immunity.

235
236

To this end, we utilized overlapping peptide pools spanning the Spike proteins of the human seasonal

237

coronaviruses 229E and NL63 to stimulate PBMC from the same donors described above in a parallel

238

IFN-γ ELISPOT assay. While the majority of subjects exhibited reactivity against the Spike protein from

239

both 229E and NL63, persistent COVID-19 symptoms did not statistically impact magnitude of 229E

240

(Figure 5A) or NL63 (Figure 5B) Spike protein reactivity as assessed by IFN-γ ELISPOT. While the

241

magnitude of 229E and NL63 reactivity within a given subject correlated with each other, the magnitude

242

of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein reactivity observed in a given subject does not correlate with their

243

reactivity to Spike from 229E or NL63 (Figure 5C), suggesting that these cellular populations may be

244

distinct in convalescent COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, despite the lack of correlation between

245

NL63/229E Spike reactivity and SARS-CoV-2 Spike reactivity, the presence of either NL63 or 229E

246

Spike reactivity did correlate with reactivity against the SARS-CoV-2 N protein (Figure 5C). Finally,

247

while we noted no significant association between the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular

248

immunity and donor age in our study (Supplemental Figure 4), a significant negative correlation was

249

observed between the total magnitude of 229E and NL63 reactivity and subject age in our dataset

250

(Figure 5D).

DISCUSSION

256

In this study, we examined the relationship between the duration COVID-19 symptoms and the

257

magnitude and functional profile of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity in individuals recently

258

recovered from mild/moderate COVID-19. We observed that patients with prolonged COVID-19

259

symptoms overall exhibited similar levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity as individuals

260

who rapidly resolved their symptoms. No defect was observed in the magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2

261

Spike specific CD4 and CD8 T cell response in individuals with prolonged COVID-19 symptoms when

262

assessed using flow cytometry, and the transcription profile of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 T cells was

263

observed not to be influenced by the duration of COVID-19 symptoms. Finally, while significant levels

264

of cellular immunity against the seasonal human coronaviruses 229E and NL63 was observed in all

265

convalescent COVID-19 patients analyzed in the study, the magnitude of this immune response did not

266

correlate with the duration of COVID-19 symptoms. These data suggest that prolonged symptomatic

267

COVID-19 does not significantly impact the development of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity in

268

patients with mild/moderate disease.

269
270

The development of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity has been ubiquitously observed following

271

the resolution of COVID-19 symptoms and may be a more sensitive immunologic indication of SARS-

272

CoV-2 infection than conventional seroconversion [22, 23]. Indeed, higher levels of both cellular and

273

humoral immunity have been observed in patients after the resolution of severe COVID-19 than

274

following mild or asymptomatic infections [24]. However, the quality of the cellular immune response

275

generated after severe COVID-19 is of uncertain quality, as severe COVID-19 is associated with severe

276

T cell dysregulation, exhaustion, and inflammatory cytokine production [25, 26]. As we did not observe

277

any appreciable deficit in either the quantity or the quality of the SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immune

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.29.21250771; this version posted February 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

278

profile in the individuals analyzed in our study, we feel that it is reasonable to hypothesize that the

279

immunologic mechanisms underpinning severe COVID and persistent mild COVID-19 are distinct and

280

may differentially impact the development of virus-specific cellular memory.

281
282

While it was not unexpected to observe cellular reactivity against coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV-

283

2 in the convalescent COVID-19 patients analyzed in our study, the lack of correlation between the

284

magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein reactivity and reactivity against Spike from the seasonal

285

coronaviruses 229E and NL63 was unexpected. Preexisting cellular immunity against common seasonal

286

human coronaviruses – such as 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1- has been highlighted as the most likely

287

explanation for the relativity high frequency of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular

288

immunity prior to the appearance of the virus [19-21]. Additionally, it is notable that the level of 229E

289

and NL63 Spike reactivity did correlate with the amount of SARS-CoV-2 N reactivity in convalescent

290

COVID-19 patients analyzed in our study. This result is consistent with other previously published

291

reports that suggest that coronavirus infections – including infection with seasonal betacoronaviruses

292

and SARS-CoV - may preferentially result in durable cellular memory against the structural N protein

293

that cross-reacts with SARS-CoV-2 [21]. In addition to providing insight into the mechanisms driving

294

the development of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity, this observation may provide guidance as

295

to which antigens may be most amenable in the development of a universal coronavirus vaccine.

METHODS

302

Study design: Convalescent COVID-19 patients were recruited for this study at the SUNY Upstate

303

Medical University Clinical Research Unit starting in March 2020 under the SUNY Upstate

304

Convalescent Plasma Donor Program [27]. This study was reviewed by the SUNY Upstate Medical

305

University IRB, reviewed approved by the Western Institutional Review Board (IRB # 1587400), and

306

performed under informed consent. All subjects were adults 18 year of age or older who had previously

307

tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and who were symptom-free for at least 14 days prior to enrollment.

308

Information regarding the timing and duration of acute COVID-19 symptoms – such as fever, shortness

309

of breath, sore throat, cough that impacted activity, and fatigue that impacted activity -were self-

310

reported. Lingering symptoms such as loss of taste and smell, mild cough or tickle in the throat, or

311

lingering fatigue that did not impact their daily activity were not considered part of the acute illness and

312

therefore not included in the length of illness. For asymptomatic donors identified via contract tracing

313

protocols the date of positive RT-PCR test was used for the start and stop date of symptoms. Samples

314

were de-identified following collection, and researchers conducting assays were blinded to clinical data

315

until final comparative analysis. PBMC were collected and processed using Vacutainer CPT Cell

316

Preparation Tubes (BD) and stored in vapor phase liquid nitrogen prior to analysis.

IFN-γ ELISPOT: Cryopreserved PBMC were thawed, washed twice, and placed in RPMI 1640

319

medium (Corning, 10040CM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated Fetal Calf Serum (Corning, 35-

320

010-CV), L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), and Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco, 15140-122). Cellular

321

viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion and cells were resuspended at a concentration of

322

5x106/ml and rested overnight at 37°C. After resting, viable PBMC were washed, counted, and

323

resuspended at a concentration of 1x106/ml in complete cell culture media. 100 μl of this cell suspension

was mixed with 100 μl of the individuals peptide pools listed in Supplemental Table 2 and diluted to a

325

final concentration 1 μg/mL/peptide (DMSO concentration 0.5%) in complete cell culture media. This

326

cell and peptide mixture was loaded onto a 96-well PVDF plate coated with anti-IFN-γ (3420-2HW-

327

Plus, Mabtech) and cultured overnight. Controls for each donor included 0.5% DMSO alone (negative)

328

and anti-CD3 (positive). After overnight incubation the ELISPOT plates were washed and stained with

329

anti-IFN-γ-biotin followed by streptavidin-conjugated HRP (3420-2HW-Plus, Mabtech). Plates were

330

developed using TMB substrate and read using a CTL-ImmunoSpot® S6 Analyzer (Cellular

331

Technology Limited). All peptide pools were tested in duplicate and the adjusted mean was reported as

332

the mean of the duplicate experimental wells after subtracting the mean value of the negative (DMSO

333

only) control wells. Individuals were considered reactive to a peptide pool when the background-

334

subtracted response was >50 Spot Forming Cells (SFC)/106 PBMC. All data were normalized based on

335

the number of cells plated per well and are presented herein as SFC/106 PBMC.

336
337

Flow Cytometry: Surface staining for flow cytometry analysis was performed at room temperature in

338

PBS supplemented with 2% FBS. Aqua Live/Dead (ThermoFisher, L34957) was used to exclude dead

339

cells in all experiments. Antibodies and dilutions used for flow cytometry analysis are listed in

340

Supplementary Table 2. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a BD FACSAria II instrument and

341

analyzed using FlowJo v10.7 software (Treestar).

activation markers CD134 and CD69 and isolated by flow cytometric sorting using BD FACSAria II

348

instrument. Cells were sorted directly into 350 μl RLT+ buffer (Qiagen, 1053393) supplemented with

349

1% 2-ME and RNA isolated using a RNeasy Micro spin column (Qiagen, 74004). cDNA was generated

350

using a SMART-Seq HT Kit (TaKaRa, 634455), and the final Illumina-compatible DNA sequencing

351

libraries were prepared using an Illumina Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation kit. RNA, cDNA, and

352

DNA during the library preparation process were quantified using Agilent Bioanalyzer, and final

353

libraries were sequenced using a 75 cycle High Output NextSeq 500/550 v2.5 reagent kit at the SUNY

354

Upstate Molecular Analysis Core. Raw reads from FASTQ files were mapped to the human reference

355

transcriptome (Ensembl, Home sapiens, GRCh38) using Kallisto [28] version 0.46.2. Transcript-level

356

counts and abundance data were imported and summarized in R (version 4.0.2) using the TxImport

357

package [29] and TMM normalized using the package EdgeR [30, 31]. Differential gene expression

358

analysis performed using linear modeling and Bayesian statistics in the R package Limma [32].

Statistical analysis: Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism v8 Software (GraphPad

361

Software, La Jolla, CA). A p-value <0.05 was considered significant.
