ABSTRACT
Objective: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has infected millions worldwide and impacted
the lives of many folds more. Many clinicians share new Covid-19 related resources, research, and ideas
within the online Free Open Access to Medical Education (FOAM) community of practice. This study
provides a detailed content and contributor analysis of Covid-19 related tweets among the FOAM
community.
Design, Setting, Participants: Twitter was searched from November 1st, 2019 to March 21st, 2020 for
English tweets discussing Covid-19 in the FOAM community. Tweets were classified into one of 13 prespecified content categories: original research, editorials, FOAM resource, public health, podcast or
video, learned experience, refuting false information, policy discussion, emotional impact, blatantly false
information, other Covid-19, and non-Covid-19. Further analysis of linked original research and FOAM
resources was performed. 1000 randomly selected contributor profiles and those deemed to have
contributed false information were analyzed.
Results: The search yielded 8541 original tweets from 4104 contributors. The number of tweets in each
content category were: 1557 other Covid-19 (18·2%), 1190 emotional impact (13·9%), 1122 FOAM
resources (13·1%), 1111 policy discussion (13·0%), 928 advice (10·9%), 873 learned experience (10·2%),
424 non-Covid-19 (5·0%), 410 podcast or video (4·8%), 304 editorials (3·6%), 275 original research
(3·2%), 245 public health (2·9%), 83 refuting false information (1·0%), and 19 blatantly false (0·2%).
Conclusions: Early in the Covid-19 pandemic, the FOAM community used Twitter to share Covid-19
learned experiences, online resources, crowd-sourced advice, research, and to discuss the emotional
impact of Covid-19. Twitter also provided a forum for post-publication peer review of new research.
Sharing blatantly false information within this community was infrequent. This study highlights several
potential benefits from engaging with the FOAM community on Twitter.

Millions of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have been reported globally since the first
known case in December 2019.[1-3] Covid-19’s worldwide impact has been recognized through its
classification as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).[4] Covid-19’s rapid spread
has spurred healthcare workers, researchers, and members of the public to search for accurate and up-todate information online. The rate of new Covid-19-related research, however, has challenged
conventional methods of scientific knowledge dissemination (e.g. peer reviewed journals) which do not
always publish on rapid timelines.[5] In response, clinicians worldwide have turned to social media to
debate new research while sharing their experiences and resources.[6]
Social media use among clinicians is not a new phenomenon. In the past decade an online community of
practice has developed with the goal of sharing ideas, research, and learned experiences through freely
published online resources.[7,8] Termed “Free Open Access to Medical Education” (FOAM), this
movement has become a valuable resource for healthcare professionals and medical learners.[8-11] In
addition to relaying explicit medical knowledge it may also be an effective medium for transmitting tacit
knowledge (experiential or process based knowledge).[12,13] Compared to traditional peer reviewed
journals, FOAM has variable publication and editorial processes relying heavily on post-publication peer
review.[14]
Optimizing knowledge translation is important during a pandemic as critical decisions need to be made
with limited evidence and potentially practice-changing research can be published at any time. Within the
FOAM community, Twitter is the most widely used social media platform to share ideas and discuss new
research on Covid-19.[6] On Twitter, contributors generate ‘tweets’ of up to 280 characters in length that
can be tagged with searchable hashtags (#) and can include images, website links, and documents. While
the important role of Twitter during Covid-19 has been recognized by the scientific community,[6]
detailed characterization of its use, strengths, and limitations, including accuracy of content, are needed.

The objective of this study was to characterize Covid-19 related Twitter use by the FOAM community,
and to describe its content, trends, and contributors. In addition, the potential role of Twitter in spreading
misinformation was assessed. This research represents an important first step in evaluating Twitter as a
platform for knowledge translation during rapidly evolving healthcare crises.

METHODS
Research ethics board approval for research involving publicly available data is not required at our
institutions. Our protocol was registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) prior to initiation of data
collection (https://osf.io/3tx96/). The original data is also published on OSF. The study has been reported
in keeping with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)
statement.[15] Patients or the public were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting, or dissemination
plans of our research.

Search strategy
We searched Twitter on March 21st, 2020 for tweets with relevant hashtags from November 1st, 2019 to
March 21st, 2020 using a commercially available hashtag collating tool, Tweet Binder (Pamplona, Spain).
Hashtags were selected by consensus of the authors, several of whom were clinician members of the
FOAM community. Tweets were included if they contained both a hashtag commonly used by healthcare
professionals to discuss FOAM topics (#FOAMed or #meded or #POCUS or #FOAMcc or #medtwitter),
and a hashtag used to discuss Covid-19 (#Covid19 or #coronavirus or #Covid or #Covid-19).
Alternatively, two Covid-19 FOAM specific hashtags were also included (#Covid4MDs or
#CovidFOAM). The search strategy was not case sensitive.

Tweet analysis
We extracted the following data: total number of original tweets (original text or image content), retweets
(a reposted tweet without modification), reach (number of unique people who saw the tweet), impressions

(number of times a tweet was liked or retweeted), total number of contributors (accounts creating tweets),
and median original tweets per original contributor.
The content of all original, English-language tweets was analyzed independently by one of 5 authors (MP,
SB, KW, NN, RP). To assess interrater reliability, a duplicate extraction of 100 tweets was performed by
all extractors. We assigned each tweet to one of 13 pre-determined ‘content categories’ created after
consensus discussion between authors: 1) peer reviewed original research study related to Covid-19,
excluding editorials, commentaries, or perspective articles; 2) editorial, commentary, or perspective
article published in a journal or repository relevant to Covid-19; 3) FOAM resources pertaining to the
care of Covid-19 patients; 4) public health agency website or university website (eg. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention); 5) medical podcast or video relevant to Covid-19; 6) personal or learned
experience caring for Covid-19 patients; 7) a statement or discussion refuting blatantly false or misleading
information regarding Covid-19; 8) a discussion about policy or public health measures related to Covid19; 9) a discussion of the personal or emotional impact of Covid-19; 10) a tweet that provided blatantly
false or misleading information (these were flagged and reviewed in duplicate by two senior authors [RP
and RU] to provide consensus on this classification); 11) a tweet asking for advice, or for others to share
experience caring for Covid-19 patients; 12) other Covid-19 related tweets that did not fit in the other
categories; 13) non-Covid-19 related tweets. The overall best fitting category was selected if multiple
classifications were possible, and consensus discussion was allowed if needed. Once categorized, we
calculated the number and percentage of tweets in each content category by day and week.

Contributors, original research, and FOAM content
We determined the demographics of Covid-19 FOAM contributors by reviewing 1000 random profiles of
the contributors whose Tweets were captured in the search strategy, extracting: the number of followers,
total tweets, country of residence, and contributor source (institution, nurse, staff physician, resident
physician, medical student, respiratory therapist, pharmacist, other healthcare professional, non-healthcare

professional, non-clinician researcher, healthcare-related group). The profiles were randomized and
selected using the randomize function in Microsoft Excel. We performed a similar analysis on the
contributor profiles whose tweets were flagged as blatantly false or misleading.
To evaluate the dissemination of original research via Twitter, we analyzed the journal of publication,
country of corresponding author, article type (epidemiological study, intervention study, diagnostic study,
basic science, case series or other), and the median number of days between online publication (either
pre-publication or online) and tweet for each included article. To ensure a focus on new research being
conducted on Covid-19 (as opposed to previous coronavirus infections), we excluded research articles
published before 2020.
We also identified tweets that linked to FOAM resources and the source (website), type of resource,
number of tweets including the resource, and the median number of days between FOAM publication
online and the tweet.

Data analysis
We saved the extracted data in Microsoft Excel 2013 (Washington, USA) and analyzed it using R version
3.6.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing). When appropriate, we assessed the distribution of our data
using a Shapiro-Wilks test and calculated the mean (+/- standard deviation) for normally distributed data
and median (1st and 3rd interquartile range) for data that was not normally distributed. A post-hoc MannWhitney U test was performed to compare the days between publication of original research or FOAM
resource and tweet. A post-hoc Mann-Kendall trend test with a Bonferroni correction was used to assess
for a trend in percentage of total tweets represented by each content category per week. Interrater
reliability was assessed using a Fleiss’ Kappa. Statistical significance was set at a p-value of less than or
equal to 0·05.

The first Tweet matching the search criteria was on January 19th, 2020, and from then until to March 21st,
2020, 74,758 original tweets and retweets from 52,917 contributors were created. Of these, 8819 (11·8%)
were original tweets created by 4104 contributors, and 65,490 (88·2%) were retweets (Table 1). We
excluded 278 tweets because they were not written in English or contained broken links. Of the remaining
8541 (11·4%) original tweets, 5494 were stand-alone tweets, 1039 were replies, and 2008 were retweets
with comments (Figure 1). The original tweets and retweets reached 95,072,663 Twitter users and had a
total of 388,701 likes or replies. Contributors to original tweets had a median number of 489 (IQR 144,
1601) followers and published a median of 1 (IQR 1, 2) original tweets. The Shapiro-Wilks test rejected
the null hypothesis of normal distribution for the number of followers per contributor, number of original
tweets per original contributor, and number of days between online publication and tweet for FOAM
resources or studies p value of < 0·0001.

Content analysis
The number of tweets per day in each content category are displayed in Figure 2. The tweets per week are
displayed in Supplementary Table 1. Most Covid-19-related tweets (1,557 or 18·2%) did not fall into one
of the pre-determined categories. There were 1122 tweets sharing FOAM resources including blog posts
(13·1%), 275 sharing peer-reviewed original research articles (3·2%), 304 sharing non-research journal
articles (editorials, commentaries, or perspectives) (3·6%), 410 sharing podcasts or videos (4·8%), and
245 linking to public health agencies or university websites (2·9%). There were also 1190 tweets
discussing emotional impact (13·9%), 1111 tweets discussing public policy (13·0%), 928 tweets asking
for advice pertaining to Covid-19 patients (10·9%), and 873 tweets about learned or personal experience
caring for Covid-19 patients (10·2%). In addition, there were 83 tweets refuting false information (1·0%),
19 tweets providing blatantly false or misleading information (0·2%) and 424 non-Covid-19 related
tweets (5·0%). There was no significant change in the percentage of total tweets represented by each
content category over time (see supplementary materials). Overall, interrater reliability was fair with a
kappa of 0.31. A selection of representative tweets are provided in Table 2.

Their median number of followers was 728 (IQR 189, 1145).

Dissemination of original research
There were 275 tweets that linked to 157 unique peer reviewed original research articles. Of these, 23
were published before January 1st, 2020 and were excluded from analysis. The 134 remaining studies
included 18 epidemiological studies (13·4%), 4 intervention studies (3·0%), 4 diagnostic studies (3·0%),
10 basic science studies (7·5%), and 98 case series or other (73·1%). The top 5 most common countries of
corresponding authors were China (57, 42·5%), United States of America (29, 21·6%), Australia (11,
8·2%), United Kingdom (15, 11·2%), and Italy (8, 6·0%). The top 5 most common journals of publication
were The Lancet (20, 14·9%), The Journal of the American Medical Association (18, 13·4%), The Lancet
Respiratory Medicine (9, 6·7%), The New England Journal of Medicine (8, 6·0%), and The Medical
Journal of Australia (8, 6·0%). The median number of days between publication and tweet was 2 (IQR 1,
5). A table with the individual studies is included in the supplementary materials.

There were 1122 tweets containing links to FOAM resources (websites, blogs, infographics, or attached
files). The top 10 FOAM resources included in original tweets were “onepagericu.com” (47, 4·2%),
“emcrit.org” (32, 2·9%), “esicm.org” (28, 2·5%), “sccm.org” (23, 2·0%), “butterflynetwork.com” (17,
1·5%), “rebelem.com” (13, 1·2%), “elso.blog” (12, 1·1%) “insightplus.mja.com.au” (12, 1·1%),
“ultrasoundtraining.com.au (12, 1·1%), “intensiveblog.com (11, 1·0%), and “propofology.com” (11,
1·0%). The median number of days from publication of a FOAM resource to dissemination on Twitter
was 1 (IQR 0, 3). Many of the resources that were shared were singular attachments that did not contain a
link to a FOAM website, blog or resource. These included 79 documents (eg, hospital Covid-19
protocols), 83 unsourced infographics, and 27 webinars (including participant notes). The median number
of days between publication of FOAM resources and tweet was shorter than for original peer reviewed
research (1 vs. 2, p < 0·0001)

DISCUSSION
Covid-19 is not the first pandemic where Twitter has played an important role in sharing information. The
H1N1 pandemic and Ebola epidemic were widely discussed on Twitter, with millions of original
tweets.[16,17] When compared to the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, however, the number of tweets discussing
Covid-19 tweets has increased exponentially, surging in early March 2020 (Figure 2).[17] For context, at
that time Europe had Covid-19 cases across the continent, with several hundred deaths in Italy alone.[18]
North America also had its first significant outbreak in Washington, USA.[19] Although the FOAM
community has contributors worldwide, most tweets were created by North American contributors, which
may account for the temporal association between Twitter use and western outbreaks of Covid-19.
Given the immediacy and reach of social media, the FOAM community may be ideally situated to share
medical resources during a pandemic. We found that more than 1 in 4 tweets contained a link to a Covid19 resource. Compared to traditional publication peer review, the publication and editorial processes of
FOAM resources varies.[14,20,21] FOAM relies on transparent and open post-publication peer review

where other contributors can discuss, critique, and sometimes even contribute to resources.[8,11] One
illustrations of effective post-publication peer review during the Covid-19 pandemic has been the Internet
Book of Critical Care (IBCC) chapter on Covid-19.[22] From March 2nd to April 16th, 2020 the IBCC
received over 2·1 million views, with over 180 comments contributing to post publication peer
review.[23] This has led to numerous revisions of the chapter to incorporate new evidence. To consolidate
and share the vast amount of information being generated during a pandemic, open post-publication peer
review may help balance timely dissemination of content whilst ensuring its accuracy and quality.
In addition to the speed and reach of FOAM publication, social media may be particularly effective in
sharing tacit knowledge.[12,13] This stems in part from its ability to facilitate discussions and storytelling, which are key components of tacit knowledge translation.[13] During Covid-19, the geographic
progression of disease from Asia, to Europe, to North America allowed for clinicians to share their
experiences managing Covid-19 patients. In total, 9·8% percent of original tweets shared learned
experiences and 10·8% represented individuals asking for crowd-sourced advice. Many of these early
tweets pertained to the diagnosis of Covid-19 infection, ultrasound use, airway management, personal
protective equipment, and mechanical ventilation. These resources may have helped clinicians and
organizations to prepare for Covid-19.
With the unprecedented amount of new Covid-19 research being published, it seems increasingly difficult
to find accurate and reliable content online. This has been termed an “infodemic’ by the WHO.[24]
Although Twitter might contribute to this through the indiscriminate sharing of information, it can also
flag important new research and give clinicians a forum to openly critique it. In our study, we found that
contributors rapidly tweeted new Covid-19 research, with a median time between publication and tweet of
2 days. The majority were published in high-impact journals and included important early studies on
Covid-19. The immediacy of discussion and rebuttal provided through Twitter also may be valuable,
especially when many studies are first being published as pre-prints and have not undergone peer review.
For example, when Gautret et al. published their initial pre-print advocating for the use of

Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin as a treatment for Covid-19,[25] many FOAM contributors called
for more rigorous studies with patient-important outcomes before widespread adoption (Table 2). Their
criticisms were substantiated with recent studies showing increased adverse events and a potential
association with mortality for hydroxychloroquine.[26,27]
Contributing to and participating in the FOAM community is not without risks and the unwritten rule is
caveat emptor (buyer beware). Across social media, the potential for receiving misinformation is real and
significant.[28] In this study, 19 contributors contributed blatantly false or misleading information;
however, this represented only 0·2% of the total number of tweets in this analysis. Whereas blatantly
misleading tweets are relatively easy to identify, a significant concern is when a reader is misled through
either misrepresentation of opinion as fact, sensational anecdotes, or providing content without context. A
recent study Kouzy et al. found that 1 in 4 tweets about Covid-19 across Twitter (no FOAM hashtags)
contained misinformation.[29] We suspect the rate of subtle misinformation in the FOAM community is
higher than the 0·2% found in this study; however, given that the community’s collective goal is to share
legitimate knowledge, it is likely lower than the broader Twitter community.
FOAM has the potential to decrease the knowledge translation gap during Covid-19; however, resources
may be of variable quality.[30] Readers are responsible for critically appraising online content; however,
locating quality resources to begin with can be a challenge. The Social Media Index (SMI) provides a list
of FOAM websites that are both impactful [31] and high quality,[32] analogous in some ways to a
journal’s impact factor. When reading these resources, the Academic Life in Emergency Medicine
(ALiEM) AIR tool or revised METRIQ tool have been validated to help determine the quality of
content.[33,34]

Limitations
Our study has several limitations. Although a broad hashtag search strategy was used, some FOAM
hashtags were not included. As well, many Twitter contributors do not add hashtags to all of their Tweets,

meaning that some tweets that would have been relevant were missed. Additionally, although the search
was up to date as of March 21st, 2020, the necessary time for analysis and manuscript preparation means it
does not reflect current Twitter use. As well, interrater reliability was only fair, likely related to the fact
some tweets fell into several categories. This may account for the reason why a fair proportion of tweets
were classified as “other Covid-19”. Finally, during initial months of Covid-19 the largest number of
cases were in Asia and Europe,[1,35] yet the study was limited to English tweets, potentially selecting for
a North American or Anglo-biased perspective.

Conclusions
In the age of social media, many clinicians use Twitter to share resources and ideas with the goal of
improving care for their patients. Twitter is effective in disseminating information; however, it comes
with challenges in ensuring content is accurate and relevant. This study represents a first step in
understanding Twitter use among the FOAM community during the Covid-19 pandemic. Further work is
required to improve Twitter as a knowledge translation tool both for Covid-19 and future global crises,
such that misinformation and bias is minimized, and factual knowledge dissemination maximized. Covid19 has united clinicians around the world, and perhaps more than ever, effective strategies for sharing
new ideas, accurate information, and quality research are needed.
