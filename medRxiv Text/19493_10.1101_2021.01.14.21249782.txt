Key points
Question. To identify transmission characteristics consistent with timing and extent of SARSCoV-2 infection among inmates in Marion Correctional Institution.
Findings. Mathematical and statistical modeling finds three scenarios that are consistent with
the observed widespread infection in Marion Correctional Institution: i) very high transmissibility
corresponding to a basic reproduction number in the double digits, ii) an initial super-spreading
event involving exposure of several hundred inmates, iii) undetected circulation of virus prior to
the first documented case among inmates.
Meaning. High transmissibility, super-spreading events, and challenges with disease surveillance
all attest to the vulnerabilities of prison populations to SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract
Importance. Incarcerated individuals are a vulnerable population for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Understanding SARS-CoV-2 dynamics
in prisons is crucial for curbing transmission both within correctional facilities and in the surrounding community.

Objective. The purpose of this study was to identify transmission scenarios that could underly rapid, widespread SARS-CoV-2 infection among inmates in Marion Correctional Institution (MCI).

Design. Publicly available data reported by the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and
Corrections (ODRC) was analyzed using mathematical and statistical models.

Setting. We consider SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics among MCI inmates prior to and
including April 16, 2020.
Participants. This study uses de-identified, publicly available SARS-CoV-2 test result data
for MCI inmates.

Exposures. Inmates at MCI were considered exposed to potential infection with SARS-CoV2.

Main outcome and measures. Results from mass testing conducted on April 16, 2020
were analyzed together with time of first reported SARS-CoV-2 infection among MCI inmates.
Results. Rapid, widespread infection of MCI inmates was reported, with nearly 80% of
inmates infected within three weeks of first reported inmate case. These data are consistent
with i) a basic reproduction number greater than 14, together with a single initially infected
inmate, ii) an initial super-spreading event resulting in several hundred initially infected inmates,
together with a basic reproduction number of approximately three, and iii) earlier undetected
circulation of virus among inmates prior to April.

Conclusions and relevance. Mass testing data are consistent with extreme transmissibility, super-spreading events, or undetected circulation of virus among inmates. All scenarios
consistent with these data attest to the vulnerabilities of prisoners to COVID-19.

Introduction

Incarcerated individuals are a vulnerable population for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Factors contributing to SARS-CoV-2 transmission in prisons include
shared housing, crowding, inability to social distance, challenges for hygiene, and more. Transmission can be extensive: as of November 6, 2020, various testing protocols across states and
jurisdictions have identified 169,286 COVID-19 cases among prisoners and 38,438 cases among
prison staff in the United States [1]. Outbreak sizes within facilities can be high: infections in more
than 80% of prisoners at Marion Correctional Institution (MCI) in Ohio have been identified1 , and
similarly high levels of infection have been observed in correctional facilities under other jurisdictions [3]. The vulnerability of prisoners to COVID-19 and the potential for the penal system to
serve as hot spots for transmission have been noted by many authors [4–8].
These outbreak sizes indicate widespread SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Perhaps even more remarkable is the apparent intensity of transmission within prisons. Here we analyze publicly available
COVID-19 time series data from the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections (ODRC).
This analysis highlights the extreme potential for transmission in prisons, as well as the need for
high quality, publicly available data on COVID-19 in correctional facilities.

Data and Methods

Case data. Mass RT-PCR testing at MCI of all inmates and partial testing of staff was conducted
on April 16, 2020. Total number of inmates and number of inmates and staff at MCI testing positive
for SARS-CoV-2 over time were obtained from public ODRC reports [2]. To account for lags in
data entry, we accumulate the cases reported at MCI over April 16-23, 2020 as a single mass testing
data point.
Mathematical model. We use a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) framework to
model SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in MCI. Under the standard SEIR model, the proportions of individuals in the susceptible (St ), exposed (Et ), infectious (It ), and recovered (Rt ) compartments (at
time t) satisfy the following system of differential equations:
Ṡt = −βSt It ,
(2.1)

Ėt = βSt It − αEt ,
I˙t = αEt − γIt ,
Ṙt = γIt ,

where the positive parameters β, α, and γ denote the infection rate, the incubation rate, and the
recovery rate.
Statistical analysis. We derive a likelihood function for observing n positives out of N incarcerated individuals on day u as follows. Using the Dynamic Survival Analysis approach of [9], we
treat St as an improper survival function. Given observation up to time T > 0, the time TE that
an individual becomes infected and enters the E compartment follows the conditional probability

The July 21 ODRC report [2] reports that 2023 inmates had recovered from COVID-19. We take the May 5,
2020 listing of 2453 inmates at MCI as the denominator.

Note that the random variables TE , TI − TE , and TR − TE are mutually independent, and that
TI − TE and TR − TE are exponentially distributed with rates α and γ.
Mass testing yields the number of individuals who test positive and the total number of tests
administered on the day of mass testing. To use these data, let TN denote the time when virus
first becomes undetectable in an individual. We then describe the epidemic process by the pair of
random variables (TE , TN ). Let ε = TN − TE . Then, the conditional probability of an individual
testing positive on the day of the mass testing (at time u) is given by

We fix ε = 21 days, corresponding to detectable virus for three weeks following an individual
becoming infectious [10, 11]. We set 1/α = 5.1/ log(2) days (corresponding to a median incubation
period of 5.1 days [12]), and assume a mean infectious period 1/γ of 5.6 days [13].

Results

Reported outbreak time course. According to ODRC reports [2], the first identified COVID19 case at MCI was an infected staff member on March 29. Following this initial primary case,
precautions such as cohorting and modified movement were enacted in order to restrict mixing and
reduce transmission.2 The first COVID-19 case among inmates was identified on April 3. Mass
RT-PCR testing of all inmates and partial testing of staff was conducted on April 16. By April 20,
SARS-CoV-2 infection had been identified in 79% (1950/2453) of inmates and 35% (154/446) of
staff.3 A time series of COVID-19 cases at MCI is shown in Figure 1.
2

As stated in the publicly available ODRC report from March 30, 2020: “Based on a staff member reporting a
positive COVID test, MCI is operating under modified movement and the population is being separated by unit along
with other precautionary measures. Every inmate at MCI is monitored daily and has their temperature taken along
with a check for symptoms. Currently, there are no inmates symptomatic for COVID-19.”
3
These numbers come directly from data on the ODRC website. There is a lag of a few days between when mass
testing occurred (April 16) and when jumps in case counts are reported in the ODRC data (April 18 and April 19
for inmates; April 20 for staff). This lag may reflect delay in data entry.

Basic reproduction number and initial exposure size. To examine what values for the basic
reproduction number R0 are consistent with such rapid spread, we turn to the SEIR model (system
(2.1)). In order for mass screening to identify 80% of the population as positive for COVID-19 on
April 16, at least 80% of the population must have been infected by that date. Figure 2 shows
the time needed to infect 80% of the population in the SEIR model as a function of the basic
reproduction number (R0 ) and the initial number of exposed individuals (E0 ). While R0 values of
two or larger are able to eventually infect 80% or more of the population, for modest R0 values this
can take on the order of months. Reproduction numbers larger than 14 are needed before outbreaks
originating from a single exposed individual are able to generate infection levels in a three week
span that are consistent with those reported for MCI.
An alternative explanation is that the outbreak involved more than one initially infected
prisoner. From Figure 2, we see that for a
fixed R0 value, increasing E0 decreases the time
needed to infect 80% of the population. However, an initial condition of E0 > 471 is needed
for an outbreak with R0 = 3.27 to infect 80%
of the population within three weeks.
Time of initial outbreak circulation. A
third possibility is that SARS-CoV-2 was circulating among prisoners prior to April 3. Figure
3 shows the log-likelihood (2.6) for observing
the mass testing results in MCI according to the
SEIR model (2.1) as a function of R0 and the
outbreak onset date, with E0 fixed at one. The Figure 2: Time to infect 80% of population in
outbreak onset date and R0 are indistinguish- SEIR model with median incubation period of 5.1

Discussion

The official reports from ODRC describe widespread infection of MCI inmates with SARS-CoV-2
within the span of three weeks. Our analysis indicates three (non-exclusive) possible explanations
for this rapid spread: (i) values for the basic reproduction number that are far higher than the
R0 values between two and three that have been estimated for non-prison settings in the United
States [13], (ii) initial exposure of a large number of infected prisoners, consistent with an extreme
super-spreading event, and (iii) early, undetected circulation of SARS-CoV-2 among prisoners prior
to April 3. All three possibilities speak to the vulnerabilities of the prison population for COVID-19.
The permissive conditions for spread within correctional facilities, the challenges for disease
surveillance and care in these settings, and the inextricable link between COVID-19 within correctional facilities and disease spread in the broader community, have been eloquently discussed by
others [4–8]. None of these issues can be adequately addressed without collection and analysis of
data regarding COVID-19 in prisons. Officially reported data such as those considered here can
already be used for statistical and mathematical analyses [14, 15]. Further data collection and dissemination, for example distinguishing symptomatic versus mass testing and including both positive
and negative test results, would facilitate additional analyses that would deepen our understanding
of transmission. We urge health departments and corrections departments to undertake collection
of accurate data and to make these data available for analysis. These efforts are imperative for
preventing COVID-19 spread in prisons.
