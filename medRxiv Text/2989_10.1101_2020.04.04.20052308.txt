Abstract
Objectives: To estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 in the early stage of
the epidemic and predict the expected number of new cases in Shahroud, Northeast of Iran.
Methods: The R0 of COVID-19 was estimated using the serial interval distribution and the
number of incidence cases. The serial interval was fit with a gamma distribution. The probable
incidence and cumulative incidence in the next 30 days were predicted using the assumption that
daily incidence follows a Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. Data analysis
was done using “earlyR” and “projections” packages in R software.
Results: The maximum-likelihood value of R0 was 2.7 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1 to 3.4)
for the COVID-19 epidemic in the early 14 days and decreased to 1.13 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.25) by
the end of the day 41. The expected average number of new cases in Shahroud is 9.0±3.8
case/day, which means an estimated total of 271 (95% CI: 178-383) new cases in the next 30
days.
Conclusions: It is essential to reduce the R0 to values below one. Therefore, we strongly
recommend enforcing and continuing the current preventive measures, restricting travel, and
providing screening tests for a larger proportion of the population.

Introduction
At the time of writing this manuscript, the novel coronavirus and the COVID-19 pandemic has
already spread to 207 countries worldwide [1, 2] , and the number of infected cases continues to
escalate. The Islamic Republic of Iran was the first Middle East country to report a case of death
due to coronavirus (19 February 2020) and is currently among countries with the highest
prevalence of COVID-19. By 3 April 2020, there were 53,183 confirmed cases in Iran, 3,294 of
which had already deceased [3]. Given the rapid spread of the virus, the government immediately
responded by establishing more than 40 laboratories to enhance the testing capacity, and
consequently, there was a sudden spike in the reported number of positive cases. The first cases
were immediately reported to the Health Department, and preventive protocols were developed
and put in place to limit the further spread of the infection. These included cancelling in-person
classes in schools and universities as of 25 February 2020, and switching to online platforms, as
well as public awareness campaigns that encourage citizens to minimize face-to-face contact and
promote social distancing. Nonetheless, the timeframe from 20 March to 2 April 2020 coincides
with the ‘Norouz Spring Holidays’ in Iran. During this time, there is significantly higher rates of
social activities, visiting family and friends, trips, shopping, and festivals. This is while the
epidemic has already spread throughout the country and beyond. Therefore, close monitoring and
evaluation is necessary to investigate the efficiency of control measures, determine the potential
community transmission patterns, and predict the progression of the epidemic and the trajectory
of the epidemic curve.
One useful epidemic measure which can help investigate the transmissibility of infection is the
reproduction number. The basic reproduction number (R0) is the average expected number of
new cases infected by a primary case and must be estimated early during an epidemic [4] . R0,

can be affected by various factors such as the probability of transmission upon contact between
an infected case and a susceptible person, the frequency of contact, the duration of infection in a
person, and the proportion of immune people in the population [5] . The serial interval (SI) of an
infection is the mean duration between symptom onset of two successive cases (the primary case
and secondary case). The force of infection (denoted λ), which describes the rate at which
susceptible people acquire a given infection, is another useful parameter when implementing
preventative measures [6] .
According to the latest report of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education in Iran, the
incidence rate of COVID-19 has been highest in Semnan Province (118 cases per 100000
persons) the highest incidence rate in Iran by April 01 was seen in Shahroud County [7] .
Shahroud, in Shahroud County and Semnan Province, is a city located in the northeast of Iran
with a population of about 218628 in 2016 [8] . The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Iran
was identified on February 19 in Qom which is about 550 km from Shahroud (Figure 1) [9]. Four
days later (February 23, 2020), nasopharyngeal and throat swabs of five suspected cases in
Shahroud were submitted for viral nucleic acid testing, and two tested were positive. One of
these primary cases was a 74-year-old woman who had been hospitalized on February 10, with
chief complaints of fever and cough, and a travel history to Qom. This indicates that the
epidemic probably started almost one month before it was known to the public. Given the high
incidence rate of COVID-19 in the region, the aim of this report is to estimate the R0 of the
COVID-19 in the early stage of the epidemic and predict the trajectory of the epidemic and new
cases in Shahroud.

Methods
The protocol of this study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of
Shahroud University of Medical Science (IR.SHMU.REC.1398.160). The study was conducted
at Imam Hossein hospital which is currently the only specialty hospital designated to COVID-19
patients in Shahroud. In the past month, all walk-in and referral cases have first been screened.
Of these, suspected cases have been admitted and tested for the infection testing. For testing, two
respiratory tract samples (throat and nasopharyngeal swabs) are collected and submitted for viral
nucleic acid testing. All positive cases are systematically recorded in a designated registry which
is used for follow-up and contact tracing.
In this study, we used an informative prior distribution for the SI, which was estimated as 7.5
±3.4 days for COVID-19 in Wuhan, China [10] , fit with a gamma distribution.
We calculated the likelihood-based R0 using a branching process with Poisson likelihood.
Bootstrapping with 1000 times resampling was used for obtaining the distribution and
confidence interval (CI) of R0.
We then used the estimates of R0, SI, and daily incidence to simulate the trajectories and project
the future daily cumulative incidence where the main assumption was that the model follows a
Poisson distribution [11] . For each date

 2,

the number of incident cases ௧ was drawn from

a Poisson distribution with mean ௧ ∑௧௦ୀଵ ௧ି௦ ௦ , where ௧ is the instantaneous reproduction
number, ௦ is the discrete SI distribution and ௧ି௦ is the incidence at time step t – s.
For a 30-day projection, we used a uniform distribution of 0.8 to 1.5 for R0 and Bootstrapping
with 1000 times resampling. [11, 12] Data analysis was performed using the “incidence”,
“earlyR”, “ggplot2” and “projections” packages in R (3.6.3) software.

Results
During the first 41 days of the epidemic (20 February to 31 March 2020), a total of 1055
suspected samples were tested for COVID-19 in Shahroud, and 405 (40.1 percent) of them tested
positive. The daily distribution of these confirmed cases is illustrated in Figure 2.
Using the SI distribution, the maximum likelihood value of R0 was estimated at 2.7 (95% CI, 2.1
to 3.4) which is indicative of a propagated epidemic (Figure 3). To stabilize this estimate, we
used a 2-week time window, and the maximum likelihood value of R0 decreased to 1.28 (95%
CI: 1.14 to 1.43) for day 30 (20 March 2020) and 1.13 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.25) for day 41 (31
March 2020).
The predicted number of new cases for the next 30 days (one month after ending the Norouz
Spring Holidays), based on decreasing function of R0 between 1.3 and 0.8, is demonstrated in
figure 5 (A, B, C). The overall predicted average number of new cases will be 9.0±3.8 cases per
day in the next 30 days. In figure 5-B, the daily average of predicted incident cases was
smoothed for the time span. The next 30-day projected cumulative incidence in Shahroud is
shown in figure 5-C; approximately 271 (95% CI: 178-383) new cases will be infected in the
next 30 days.

Discussion
The R0 of an infection is commonly used to characterize its transmissibility during an epidemic.
The trend of R0 over time provides a measure of the effectiveness of control and prevention
strategies in the community, and to control an epidemic, the goal is to reduce and keep R0 below
the value of 1 [13] . In the present study, the estimated R0 of 2.7 (95% CI, 2.1 to 3.4) during the
early stage of the epidemic is in line with previous estimates [10, 14-16] . However, higher
estimates of R0 have been reported in larger populations [17, 18] . For precise estimation of R0,
certain conditions must be met which include the precise detection of cases in the early stages of
the epidemic, restricting the calculation to a small timeframe [12] , and choosing the appropriate
estimation method [13, 19] . For precise detection of cases, all suspected cases (according to the
screening protocol) and cases who have had close contact with confirmed cases should undergo
viral nucleic acid testing. In Shahroud, there were 1055 suspected cases, and 405 of them tested
positive. However, in the early stages of the epidemic in Iran, there was limited capacity for
testing, and the calculated R0 may be an underestimation.
The results of this study showed that R0 has decreased temporally. This pattern, which is
promising for controlling an epidemic, is due to interventions enforced by the health system
starting from the early days of the epidemic. Some of the most important measures were public
education to promote social distancing and encouraging people to stay home. In addition, two
other basic measures were taken in Shahroud: 1) At the time of hospital discharge, all patients
and their caregivers were provided with counseling and training on how to be isolated at home
for 14 days, and families received information about how to care for patients; 2) Active contact
tracing with follow-up of patients' family members and friends, work colleagues, and other
possible contacts and referral of suspected cases to medical centers [9].

According to our 30-day projection, there should be a decrease in R0, and in the next 30 days,
271 cases is expected. This can be due to spreading of disease by unidentified asymptomatic
cases and increasing the number of tests performed on outpatients following the improvement of
laboratory facilities. So, we strongly recommend measures to identify these cases.
This study can inform health policymakers of the success of the preventive measures and
interventions. It also emphasizes the need for these measures to be continued along with stricter
limitations in transportation until the transmission chain is broken and the epidemic is
successfully controlled.
The main strengths of this study include its careful design, taking throat and nasopharyngeal
swabs for testing of all suspected cases, and systematic recording of positive cases. Limitation
were that testing was only done for those admitted into the hospital, as well as potential
limitations in the calculation of R0,
In conclusion, the R0 of COVID-19 in Shahroud was considerably high at the onset of the
epidemic, but with preventive measures and public education, it has been reduced to 1.13 (95%
CI: 1.03-1.25) within 41 days. This reduction highlights the success of preventive measures in
place, but we must be prepared for the doubling of cases over the next month. We strongly
recommend performing mass screening of suspected cases, implementing travel restrictions
especially during Spring holidays, and expanding coronavirus testing to the community. After
the ending the holidays, longer and stronger limitations needed.
