Abstract
Objective: This paper studied the relationship between personality traits and mental
health conditions of medical personnel to provide a basis and reference for the
implementation of targeted education on mental health.
Methods: A self-report inventory, the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), was used to
investigate the mental health status of 548 medical personnel dealing with the new
coronavirus pneumonia in eight provinces and cities of China.
Results: The overall mean SCL-90 score and mean values of factors (somatization,
obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism) of the medical
personnel were significantly higher than in the norm group (p < 0.05), while their
average interpersonal sensitivity score was significantly lower (p < 0.01). In addition,
personal factors affecting the mental health status of medical personnel were identified.

( all p < 0.05).
Conclusion: The overall mental health status of medical personnel responding to new
coronavirus pneumonia is generally higher than that of the norm group in China. The
results of this study should contribute to measures to alleviate the psychological
pressures on medical personnel dealing with the new coronavirus epidemic in China.

Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) is a pathogenic coronavirus often referred to
as the novel coronavirus. On January 12, 2020, WHO officially named the disease
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The first case of COVID-19 was reported in
Wuhan in China on December 12, 2019 [1-2] as causing severe acute respiratory
infection (SARI). Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses known to cause illnesses
such as cold and more serious diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome
(MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). COVID-19 is a new strain of
coronavirus that has never been found in the human body before [3-4].
COVID-19 patients typically show symptoms such as fever, coughing, shortness of
breath, and difficulty in breathing. In more severe cases, the disease can lead to
pneumonia, severe acute respiratory failure, kidney failure, and even death [5]. There
is as yet no specific treatment for COVID-19. Patients mainly receive symptomatic
treatment and care for the prevention of complications, while supplementary medical
services

The

rate of COVID-19 infections has increased rapidly in a short period of time. As of
February 17, 2020, the number of confirmed cases exceeded 70,000, with 1,770
deaths [6]. In addition, the disease can cause secondary infections, which has created
a huge burden and pressure for the prevention and treatment of the disease in various
places. At present, more than 30,000 medical personnel from various medical teams
across the country have provided support in Wuhan [7]. Though the help from these
medical personnel has relieved the local pressure for medical care to save critically ill
COVID-19 patients, there have been serious infections among the medical staff in
Wuhan and other places in Hubei Province. At present, over 3000 medical personnel
have been infected, which has greatly increased the psychological pressure they
experience. In the face of the catastrophic health emergency of COVID-19, medical
personnel have been affected by different kinds of subjective and objective factors
and confront several mental health problems. Mental illness is a form of human stress
response, an explanatory, emotional, and defensive response within the human body,
and a physiological response of the human body to the impact of needs or injuries.
Therefore, this study aims to analyze the psychological state of medical personnel

dealing with COVID-19 and its influencing factors in order to provide an objective
basis for the prevention of further transmission, interventions, and countermeasures
for COVID-19.
1. Research Subjects and Methods
1.1 Subjects
This study adopted convenience sampling to recruit research subjects. From
January 25 to February 16, 2020, 560 medical personnel from 12 hospitals in eight
provinces and cities across the country were enrolled as research subjects. Inclusion
criteria:  work experience ≥ 1 year;  has given informed consent and agreed to
participate in this study.
1.2 Methods
1.2.1 Survey tools  Survey of demographic characteristics of medical personnel,
including 18 questions related to the following aspects: province, hospital, department,
occupation, gender, age, highest education level, work experience, level of expertise,
marital status, children, living status, whether you have participated in training for
handling of public health emergencies, whether family members support your
working on the front line against coronavirus, whether you have supported in affected
areas in Hubei, designated hospitals, department of infectious diseases, fever clinics
or emergency department, level of concern whether you and your family have been
infected, degree of suspicion that you were infected when coronavirus-related
symptoms occurred, and whether you have received medical observation recently.

The SCL-90 self-report inventory: The SCL-90 inventory, compiled by Derogatis in
1975, includes 10 factors and a total of 90 items. Each factor reflects the symptoms
and pain of a patient in a certain aspect, and the distribution of symptoms can be
understood through the factor scores. The 10 factors include somatization,
obsessive-compulsive, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid
ideation, psychoticism, sleep, and diet. Each item was scored using a 5-point Likert
scale, ranging none, mild, moderate, moderate to severe, to severe. The total score is
the sum of the scores of the 90 items. In previous studies, the homogeneity reliability
of the total SCL-90 scale was 0.97, and the homogeneity reliability of each sub-scale

was also greater than 0.68. The test-retest reliability was greater than 0.7, and the
content validity was above 0.85, which suggest sound reliability and validity.
1.2.2 Survey methods and medical ethics: The study used online questionnaires
for data collection. Researchers conducted surveys upon the completion of general
training. All procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of Harbin Medical
University(HRBYKD-A26). The research purpose and methods were explained to
subjects to seek their cooperation. Online informed consent forms were signed by
participants. They were informed that their participation was completely voluntary,
and they could withdraw from the study at any time. The link of the online
questionnaire was then sent to a total of 560 medical personnel via the Internet.
1.2.3 Statistical methods:
(1) In this study, data analysis was performed after logical checks using the
statistical software SPSS 22.0. A p-value less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) was considered
statistically significant.
(2) Statistical description: The mean value, standard deviation, and frequency
were used to describe the demographic data of medical personnel, while the mean
value and standard deviation were used to describe the scores for the mental health
status of medical personnel responding to COVID-19.
(3) Statistical inference: Multivariate linear regression was adopted to analyze the
impact of the demographic data of medical personnel on their mental health status.
2. Results
2.1 General information of medical personnel
A total of 560 questionnaires were distributed, and 548 valid questionnaires were
recovered, for an effective recovery rate of 97.90%. These 548 questionnaires were
completed by medical personnel from eight provinces and cities in China, namely
Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Tianjin, Sichuan, Shanxi, and
Shandong. Details of the respondents’ personal information are given in Table 1.

Stepwise linear regression was performed using the total score of mental health
status as the dependent variable and 17 items of personal information as independent
variables. The 17 items include: hospital, department, occupation, gender, age, highest
education level, work experience, level of expertise, marital status, any children,
living status, whether you have participated in training for handling of public health
emergencies, whether family members support your working on the front line
against coronavirus, whether you have supported in affected areas in Hubei,
designated hospitals, department of infectious diseases, fever clinics or emergency
department, level of concern whether you and your family have been infected, degree
of suspicion that you were infected when coronavirus-related symptoms occurred, and
whether you have received medical observation recently. Values were assigned to
independent variables using the method shown in Table 3. The α-values for importing
and exporting a variable in the regression equation were set to 0.10 and 0.15,
respectively. Factors affecting the mental health and status of medical personnel based
on their significance from high to low are: the degree of suspicion that they were
infected when the novel coronavirus-related symptoms occurred, the level of concern
whether they and their family members have been infected, age, whether they have
supported in affected areas in Hubei Province, designated hospitals, and other places
for the novel coronavirus, and whether family members support them working on the
front line (p < 0.05). Details of the regression results are listed in Table 4.

3.1 Comparison of SCL-90 factor scores between medical personnel and the national

COVID-19 is a fulminant infectious disease. As it is highly contagious, many
people are frightened by it and even talk fearfully about coronavirus, which can also
be observed in front-line medical staff. The results of the study have shown that the
overall mean of the SCL-90 and the mean values of the factors (somatization,
obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism) of medical
personnel were significantly higher than that of the norm group (p < 0.05), while the
average score of the interpersonal sensitivity factor of medical personnel was
significantly lower than that of the norm group (p < 0.01). More specifically, medical
personnel are most of the people closest to COVID-19 patients, so they are at high
risk of exposure to the disease. Moreover, they have a deep understanding of the
dangers of COVID-19, so they are prone to anxiety and fear. The infection protection
procedures for COVID-19 are highly complex and medical staff need to constantly
change clothes and replace protective equipment, so they are more likely to establish
obsessive-compulsive behaviors. Medical personnel, especially young medical staff,
have less experience in the field and in dealing with difficulties and hardships in life.
Therefore, when they suddenly encounter such sudden public health events, they tend
to suffer anxiety and phobic anxiety, leading to physical and mental problems. That is
why scores of the factors somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety,
and psychoticism were significantly higher than in the norm group. This result
suggests that psychologists and team leaders should pay more attention to the anxiety,
phobic anxiety, and psychoticism issues of the medical personnel in a team. The
average score for the interpersonal sensitivity factor of medical personnel was
significantly lower than that of the norm group. This shows that in the event of an
infectious disease epidemic, the majority of medical personnel are united and have
good professional strengths and qualities for self-regulation and self-protection. The
results of this study show partial consistency with the studies of the mental health
status of front-line medical personnel for SARS in 2003 [9].
3.2 Analysis of influencing factors of the mental health status of medical personnel
The results of this study have shown that the factors affecting the mental health
status of medical personnel based on the significance from high to low are: the degree

of suspicion that they were infected when the novel coronavirus-related symptoms
occurred, the level of concern whether they and their family members have been
infected, age, whether they have supported in affected areas in Hubei Province,
designated hospitals, and other places for the novel coronavirus, and whether their
family members support them working on the front line. Specific reasons are given in
the following sections.
3.2.1 Degree of suspicion that they were infected when the novel coronavirus-related
symptoms occurred, the level of concern whether they and their family members have
been infected, whether they have supported in affected areas in Hubei Province,
designated hospitals, and other places for the novel coronavirus, and whether family
members support them working on the front line
COVID-19 patients are the main source of transmission of the disease. Patients
with latent infection (i.e., asymptomatic infection) may also constitute a source of
infection [10]. Medical personnel are in frequent close contact with patients during
their treatment and care, hence the high risk of infection [11]. Among 138 patients
admitted consecutively from January 1 to 28, 2020, to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan
University, the proportion of medical personnel was as high as 29% [12]. A
retrospective analysis of 1099 confirmed COVID-19 patients from 552 hospitals in 31
provinces (diagnosis as of January 29) found that the proportion of medical staff was
2.09% [13]. Therefore, medical staff are at high risk of infection and are under great
psychological pressure. If they become infected as a result of supporting affected
areas in Hubei and COVID-19 designated hospitals, it will not only affect their
physical and mental health but also that of their families. Therefore, with the
emergence of symptoms and the increase in the level of concern, the mental health
status of clinical medical staff may deteriorate. Furthermore, if their families do not
support them working on the front line against the disease, then the psychological
burden of the medical staff will also increase due to the resulting sense of conflict
with professional ethics, resulting in further impact on their physical and mental
health.

3.2.2 Age: We found that the higher the age, the higher the mental health score and
the more psychological problems. Based on the age distribution of patients across the
country, all ages have no resistance to the novel coronavirus, and a person of any age
can be infected as long as virus transmission conditions are met [14]. An analysis of
4021 confirmed patients nationwide (diagnosis date as of January 26) also shows that
people of all ages are generally vulnerable to the disease, of whom 71.45% are aged
30 to 65 years [14]. As people get older, the risk of exposure to the disease may
increase in people with underlying illness such as asthma, diabetes, and heart diseases
[15]. Therefore, older medical personnel have more psychological stress when dealing
with COVID-19 patients. It is advised that older medical personnel receive
psychological counseling before and during work to help them adjust their status as
soon as possible. Despite all the above, this study believes that after such a
“smokeless” war against the novel coronavirus, the psychological quality of medical
personnel can be improved to a certain extent.
4. Conclusion
In the face of the catastrophic health emergency caused by COVID-19, medical staff
have been affected by different kinds of subjective and objective factors. Their mental
health problems are a form of human stress response, an explanatory, emotional, and
defensive response within the human body, and a physiological response of the human
body to the invasion of needs or injuries. In this special environment, their work, life,
and emotions tend to be regularly abnormal. Due to the requirements for isolation and
disinfection, medical personnel need to wear several layers of protection clothing.
This increases the intensity of their work and requires great physical energy, causing
severe hypoxia and physical symptoms such as headache and muscle soreness. Other
symptoms such as obsessive-compulsive symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity,
depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety, hostility, and paranoid ideation are all normal
psychological reactions in the handling of emergencies and environmental stimuli. In
face of a disaster, persons with good mental health will tend to actively take measures
such as catharsis, transference, compensation, relaxation, humor, self-consolation, and
rational response. The results of this study show that the overall mental health of

medical staff is generally poor when dealing with COVID-19. Psychological tests
show that people have a process of adaptation to catastrophic emergencies, from
initial rejection, shock, and fear, to habituation, acceptance, and calm, to co-existence
and living together, which is a regular process. In the face of such a sudden disaster as
COVID-19, these psychological symptoms have manifested in both doctors and
patients. For medical personnel, it is particularly important to pay attention to mental
health conditions while fulfilling their responsibilities. In future research, it is worth
exploring how to strengthen the monitoring of mental health conditions of medical
personnel and establish an active, systematic, and scientific psychological defense
system under such special circumstances.
5. Research Limitations and Future Research Plans
In this study, the applicability of the results is limited by the nature of
cross-sectional studies, and because of its use of convenience sampling from 12
hospitals in eight provinces and cities of China. In subsequent research in this project,
a longitudinal study should be conducted that uses a wider sample and measures the
mental health status of medical personnel from multiple dimensions, which can help
better identify the mutual influence between demographic data and mental health
status.
