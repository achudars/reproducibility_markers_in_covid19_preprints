Abstract:
Background
In January 19, 2020, first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia
(COVID-19) was confirmed in Chongqing municipality, China.
Methods
In this retrospective, descriptive, multiple-center study, total of 267 patients with
COVID-19 confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in Chongqing from Jan 19 to Feb 16,
2020

were

recruited.

Epidemiological,

demographic,

clinical,

radiological

characteristics, laboratory examinations, and treatment regimens were collected on
admission. Clinical outcomes were followed up until Feb 16, 2020.
Results
267 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to 3 designated-hospitals in
Chongqing provincial municipality from January 19 to February 16, 2020 were
enrolled and categorized on admission. 217 (81.27%) and 50 (18.73%) patients were
categorized into non-severe and severe subgroups, respectively. The median age of
patients was 48.0 years (IQR, 35.0-65.0), with 129 (48.3%) of the patients were more
than 50 years of age. 149 (55.8%) patients were men. Severe patients were
significantly older (median age, 71.5 years [IQR, 65.8-77.0] vs 43.0 years [IQR,
32.5-57.0]) and more likely to be male (110 [50.7%] vs 39 [78.0%]) and have
coexisting disorders (15 [30.0%] vs 26 [12.0%]). 41 (15.4%) patients had a recent
travel to Hubei province, and 139 (52.1%) patients had a history of contact with
patients from Hubei. On admission, the most common symptoms of COVID-19 were
fever 225(84.3%), fatigue (208 [77.9%]), dry cough (189 [70.8%]), myalgia or
arthralgia (136 [50.9%]). Severe patients were more likely to present dyspnea (17
[34.0%] vs 26 [12.0%]) and confusion (10 [20.0%] vs 15 [6.9%]). Rales (32 [12.0%])
and wheezes (20 [7.5%]) are not common noted for COVID-19 patients, especially
for the non-severe (11 [5.1%], 10 [4.6%]). 118 (44.2%). Most severe patients
demonstrated more laboratory abnormalities. 231 (86.5%), 61 (22.8%) patients had
lymphopenia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. CD4+T cell counts
decrease was observed in 77.1 % of cases, especially in the severe patients (45, 100%).

53.1% patients had decreased CD+3 T cell counts, count of CD8+T cells was lower
than the normal range in part of patients (34.4%). More severe patients had lower
level of CD4+ T cells and CD+3 T cells (45 [100.0%] vs 29[56.9%], 31 [68.9%] vs 20
[39.2%]). Most patients had normal level of IL-2, IL-4, TNF-α and INF-γ, while high
level of IL-6 and IL-17A was common in COVID-19 patients (47 [70.1%], 35
[52.2%]). Level of IL-6, IL-17A and TNF-α was remarkably elevated in severe
patients (32 [84.2%] vs 15 [51.7%], 25 [65.8%] vs 10 [34.5%], 17 [44.7%] vs 5
[17.2%]). All patients received antiviral therapy (267, 100%). A portion of severe
patients (38, 76.0%) received systemic corticosteroid therapy. Invasive mechanical
ventilation in prone position, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal
cannula oxygen therapy was adopted only in severe patients with respiratory failure
(5[10.0%], 35[70.0%], 12[24.0%]). Traditional Chinese medicine was adopted to
most of severe patients (43,86.0%).
Conclusion:
Our study firstly demonstrated the regional disparity of COVID-19 in Chongqing
municipality and further thoroughly compared the differences between severe and
non-severe patients. The 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients from 3 designed
hospitals of Chongqing is 1.5%, lower than that of Hubei province and mainland
China including Hubei province. However, the 28-mortality of severe patients was
relatively high, with much higher when complications occurred. Notably, the
28-mortality of critically severe patients complicated with severe ARDS is
considerably as high as 44.4%. Therefore, early diagnosis and intensive care of
critically severe COVID-19 cases, especially those combined with ARDS, will be
considerably essential to reduce mortality.

occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China1. A novel coronavirus named the 2019
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was soon isolated on January 12, 2020 and identified
as the causative pathogen of this pneumonia2. On February 21, 2020, National Health
Commission of the republic of China re-named this 2019-nCo-infected pneumonia as
2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease (COVID-19). Person-to-person transmission of
COVID-19 in hospital and family settings is reported to be accumulating3. As of
February 16, 2020, there are 70548 laboratory-confirmed cases and 1770 death cases
in China, including 551 confirmed cases in Chongqing. The first laboratory-confirmed
case of COVID-19 in the Chongqing municipality is reported on January 19, 2020.
Coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses
belonging to the family Coronaviridae, which can be transmitted between animals and
humans. The 2019-nCoV is the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus2.
Coronavirus infections cause illness ranging from the mild cold to severe respiratory
diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), with mortality rates of 10% for SARS-CoV and
37% for MERS-CoV4. So far, a few patients of COVID-19 have developed severe
pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction
syndrome (MODS) and had died5.
Recently, there are some studies demonstrating the clinical characteristics and
epidemiology of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan or throughout China5-8. As Chongqing
is reported to be one of the major cities imported passengers from Wuhan in China
from December 16, 20199. Given the regional disparity of COVID-19, we aim to
describe epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features, treatment,
and prognosis of COVID-19 patients in Chongqing municipality, and compare the
differences between non-severe and severe patients, which may unravel risk factors
associated with 28-day mortality and further suggest a specific therapeutic
intervention for patients with COVID-19 in Chongqing municipality, China.

laboratory-confirmed cases with COVID-19 in Chongqing was performed in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 267 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
patients admitted to 3 designated-hospitals (Qianjiang central hospital of Chongqing,
Chongqing three gorges central hospital and Chongqing public health medical center)
in Chongqing provincial municipality from January 19 to February 16, 2020 were
enrolled and categorized on admission. Patients with COVID-19 were diagnosed
based on the World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance10 and categorized
into severe and non-severe COVID-19 according to the American Thoracic Society
guideline. ARDS was defined according to the Berlin definition11. Informed consent
was yielded due to the anonymous analysis of clinical data in retrospective study. This
research was approved by the institutional ethics board of the Second Affiliated
Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (No.2020-09), Chongqing public health
medical center (No.2020-015-01-KY), Chongqing three gorges central hospital
(No.2020-13) and Qianjiang central hospital of Chongqing (No.2020-07).
Sample collection
Respiratory specimens, including nasopharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid (BALF), or anal swab specimens were collected at admission to detect the
presence of 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction
(RT-PCR) assay in designated authoritative laboratories of local centers for disease
control and prevention12. Bacterial, fungal, and pathogenic microorganism test in
respiratory and blood samples was routinely performed. Cytokines and lymphocyte
subsets in peripheral blood were measured by fluorescence-labeled flow cytometry
(Beckman, Cell Lab Quanta SC)
Data Collection
The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment and
outcomes data from confirmed COVID-19 patients’ medical and nursing records were
obtained and analyzed. The date of disease onset was defined as the day when the
symptoms were noticed. Clinical outcomes were followed up to February 16, 2020.
Data were entered into a computerized database and were checked by two physicians.
Statistical analysis

Continuous variables were expressed as the means and standard deviations (SD) or
medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) as appropriate. Categorical variables were
presented as the counts and percentages. Independent group t tests were used for
comparison of means for continuous variables when the data were normally
distributed; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney U test was used. Proportions for categorical
variables were compared using the χ2 test or Fisher exact test. Data analyses were
performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software and SPSS 19.0 software. A value of p<
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Epidemiology and clinical characteristics
Of all 309 patients enrolled as of February 16, 2020, 42 patients were excluded due to
incompleteness of crucial data in original reports. None of medical staff were infected.
Hence this study includes 267 patients with COVID-19 from 3 designed-hospitals in
Chongqing municipality, China.
The epidemiological and clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1. The median age
of the patients was 48.0 years (IQR, 35.0-65.0), with 129 (48.3%) of the patients were
more than 50 years of age. 149 (55.8%) patients were men. Most of cases (80.1%) had
no smoke history. In our study, only 41(15.4%) patients had underlying comorbidities
including overweight and obesity (30 [11.2%]), diabetes (26 [9.7%]), respiratory
system disease diseases (25 [9.4%]), hypertension (20 [7.5%]), cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular disease (13 [4.9%]), digestive system disease (12 [4.5%]) and
malignant tumor (2 [0.7%]). 41 (15.4%) COVID-19 patients had a recent travel to
Wuhan or Hubei province, 139 (52.1%) patients had a history of contact with patients
from Wuhan or Hubei, 18 (6.7%) patients had definite contact with the patients
infected by confirmed COVID-19 patients from Wuhan or Hubei province. No
definite epidemiological link was found in the 69 (25.8%) patients. There is only one
patient in our study had definite direct exposure to Huanan seafood market.
On admission, the most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever 225(84.3%),
fatigue (208 [77.9%]), dry cough (189 [70.8%]), myalgia or arthralgia (136 [50.9%]).
Less common initial symptoms included nasal congestion (53 [19.9%]), pharyngalgia

(41 [15.4%]), dyspnea (43 [16.1%]), chill (30 [11.2%]), confusion (25 [9.4%]). A
portion of patients initially presented with symptoms of digestive system such as
anorexia (46 [17.2%]), diarrhea (10 [3.7%]) nausea or vomiting (6 [2.2%]).
Abnormal signs of physical examination on admission, including throat congestion (6
[2.2%]), tonsil swelling (3 [1.1%]) and enlargement of lymph nodes (3 [1.1%]), are
relatively rare. Notably, for auscultation of abnormal breath sound, rales (32 [12.0%])
and wheezes (20 [7.5%]) are not common noted for COVID-19 patients in Chongqing,
especially for the non-severe patients (11 [5.1%], 10 [4.6%]). The median durations
from symptoms onset to laboratory diagnosis and hospital admission were 4 days
(IQR, 2.0-8.0) and 7 days (IQR, 3.0-10.0) respectively.
Laboratory and radiologic results
The Laboratory and radiologic findings are shown in Table 2. On day of hospital
admission, most patients had normal level of leucocytes (134 [50.2%]) and
neutrophils (146 [54.7%]) counts, with 118 (44.2%), 231 (86.5%), 61 (22.8%)
patients had lymphopenia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively.
Among the 96 patients underwent for lymphocyte subsets detection, decreases in CD4
positive T cell counts were observed in 77.1 % of cases, especially in the severe
patients (45, 100%). More patients (53.1%) had decreased CD positive 3 T cell counts,
the level of CD8 positive T cells was lower than the normal range in part of patients
(34.4%). The average level of haemoglobin was in normal range (135.0 [95.0-165.0]).
Few patients had myocardial zymogram abnormality, which showed elevated level of
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase isoenzyme
(CKMB) in 21.3%, 18.7% and 12.4% of patients, respectively, which indicates a
degree of cardiac injury. Few patients presented mild live function abnormality, with
elevated level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20 [7.5%]), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) (19 [7.1%]), total bilirubin (6 [2.2%]), direct bilirubin (7
[2.6%]) or indirect bilirubin (3 [1.1%]). Other dysfunctions in kidney and coagulation
were rare, with mild increases of creatinine and D-dimer in 1.5% and 7.1% of
patients.

Regarding the infection index, 25.3%, 15.9% and 41.5% of patients had higher level
of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR), respectively. Furthermore, there are 67 patients detected for cytokines in
peripheral blood. Most patients had normal level of IL-2, IL-4, TNF-α and INF-γ,
while high level of IL-6 and IL-17A was common in COVID-19 patients (47 [70.1%],
35 [52.2%]).
Of all patients who underwent radiologic examination (X-ray or CT), most of patients
presented as pneumonia with bilateral ground-glass opacity (43.3%) or unilateral
ground-glass opacity or patchy shadowing (41.1%), co-existed with consolidation or
fibrous stripes-like shadows (5.6%). Pneumothorax or hydrothorax occurred rarely (1
[0.4%], 1 [0.4%]). 36 cases (15.6%) had no obvious radiological abnormality.
Additionally, Figure1-3 demonstrates the representative radiologic images of patients
with non-severe and a patient with severe COVID-19 in Chongqing.
Comparison of non-severe and severe patients
On admission, 217 (81.27%) and 50 (18.73%) patients were categorized into
non-severe and severe subgroups, respectively. Compared with non-severe patients,
severe patients were significantly older (median age, 71.5 years [IQR, 65.8-77.0] vs
43.0 years [IQR, 32.5-57.0]) and more likely to be male (110[50.7%] vs 39[78.0%]).
Compared with non-severe cases, more severe cases are smokers (31[62.0%] vs
22[10.1%]). Severe patients were more likely to have coexisting disorders (15[30.0%]
vs 26[12.0%]), including overweight or obesity (14[28.0%] vs 16[7.4%]),
hypertension (13[26.0%] vs 7[3.2%]), diabetes (12[24.0%] vs 14[6.5%]), respiratory
disease (10[20.0%] vs 15[6.9%]). Respiratory rate, heart rate, and mean arterial
pressure did not differ markedly between non-severe and severe cases on admission.
No significant differences in the exposure history between the two groups were
observed (all p>0.05).
Fever and cough were still the most common symptoms in both non-severe
(186[85.7%], 155[71.4%]) and severe cases (39[78.0%], 34 [68.0%]). Compared with
the non-severe patients, severe patients were more likely to present dyspnea
(17[34.0%] vs 26[12.0%]) and confusion (10[20.0%] vs 15 [6.9%]) symptoms. Few

severe patients presented with mild symptoms such as myalgia or arthralgia (37[74.0]
vs 99[45.6%]), which should be more noteworthy to avoid delayed or missed
diagnosis. The rales and wheezes were more common in severe cases as compared
with non-severe cases (21 [42.0%] vs 11[5.1%], 10[20.0%] vs 10[4.6%])).
Compared with non-severe patients, most severe patients demonstrated more
laboratory abnormalities, including lower level of lymphocytes (46[92.0%] vs 185
[85.3%]), leukocytes (31[62.0%] vs 87[40.1%]), thrombocytes (19[38.0%] vs 42
[19.4%]) and albumin (44[88.0%] vs 19[8.8%]), as well as higher level of D-dimer
(13[26.0%] vs 6[2.8%]), C-reactive protein (29 [58.0%] vs 16 [12.5%]),
procalcitonin(14[28.0%] vs 10 [9.9%]), lactate dehydrogenase (18[36.0%] vs
39[18.0%]), creatine kinase (18[36.0%] vs 32[14.7%]), myoglobin (7[33.3%] vs1
[1.8%]) and troponin (3[14.3%] vs 0[0%]). As for lymphocyte subsets, significantly
more severe patients had lower level of CD4 positive T cells and CD3 positive T cells
(45[100.0%] vs 29[56.9%], 31[68.9%] vs 20[39.2%]). More severe cases had lower
level of CD8 positive T cells (20[44.4.0%] vs 13[25.5%], p=0.051), while no
significant difference was shown. Further comparison the inflammatory cytokines
between severe and non-severe patients showed that the level of IL-6, IL-17A and
TNF-α was remarkably elevated in severe patients (32[84.2%] vs 15[51.7%],
25[65.8%] vs 10[34.5%], 17[44.7%] vs 5[17.2%]).
Treatment and complications
All patients were treated in isolated wards, among whom critically severe patients
were treated in intensive care unit with negative pressure wards. The treatment,
complications and outcomes are shown in Table 3. All patients received antiviral
therapy (267, 100%), including interferon, opinavir, arbidol, ribavirin. Most
non-severe patients received antiviral therapy only for pharmacotherapy. Few
non-severe patients (7, 3.2%) with bacterial infection evidence received empirical
antibiotic treatments (moxifloxacin and others), while more severe patients received
antibiotic treatments (36, 72.0%). 5 severe patients received antifungal therapy
(caspofungin) (5, 10.0%). None of non-severe patients received systemic
glucocorticoid therapy, while a portion of severe patients (38, 76.0%), without

obvious immune deficiency, received systemic corticosteroid therapy, usually
methylprednisolone 40-80mg for 3-5 days. There is only one critically severe patient
who received 120mg methylprednisolone. A total of 35 patients (70.0%) received
immunopotentiators (thymalfasin 1.6mg/day) or immunoglobulin treatments and 13
severe patients (26.0%) received vasopressors for shock rescue.
Few non-severe patients received ordinary oxygen therapy, delivered by nasal cannula
or face mask at 1-4 liters per minute (41, 18.9%). Oxygen therapy including invasive
mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula
oxygen therapy (HFNC) was adopted only in severe patients with respiratory failure
(5[10.0%], 35[70.0%], 12[24.0%]). It is worth noting that 3 critically severe patients
received invasive mechanical ventilation in prone position, and the oxygenation
improved remarkably. Moreover, traditional Chinese medicine was adopted to most of
severe patients (43,86.0%). Currently, none of patients received extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy, kidney replacement therapy or convalescent
plasma therapy. However, 3 critically severe patients are going to receive ECMO after
professional assessment. And, two discharged COVID-19 patients promised to donate
convalescent plasma for critically severe patients’ further treatment. As compared
with non-severe cases, severe cases suffered higher rates of any complications
(27[54.0%] vs 8[3.7%]) during hospital admission. The most common complications
were ARDS (33, 12.4%), secondary to shock (13, 4.9%) and acute cardiac injury (3,
1.1%), especially more common for severe patients (ARDS, 54.0%; septic shock,
22.0%; acute cardiac injury, 6.0%). Notably, in our study, all of the critically severe
cases are complicated with ARDS of different severity, and 4 death cases died of
severe ARDS.

Clinical outcomes
By February 16, 2020, the health commission of Chongqing announced that among
551 confirmed COVID-19 patients in Chongqing, 207(37.57%) patients were
discharged, 5 patients (0.91%) were died and 339(61.52%) patients were still in

hospital for treatment， lower than that of Hubei province and mainland China
including Hubei province (Fig.4). In our study, 103(38.6%) patients had been
discharged and 4(1.5%) patients had died, and all other patients were in hospital. The
percentages of patients being admitted to the ICU was 19.9%. The median length of
hospital of COVID-19 patients is 15 days (IQR, 11.5-16.0), with longer length of
hospital of severe patients than that of non-severe patients (20 days [IQR, 17.5-23.25],
14 days [IQR, 11.0-16.0]).
For severe patients, the duration from admission to developing ARDS is only 3 days
(IQR, 2.0-5.0), and the 28-mortality of severe patients was 8.0% (4/50), with much
higher when complications occurred (14.8%, [4/27]). Notably, the 28-mortality of
critically severe patients complicated with severe ARDS is considerably as high as
44.4% (4/9). Therefore, early diagnosis and intensive care of critically severe
COVID-19 cases will be considerably essential to reduce complications and mortality.

Discussion
In December 2019, COVID-19 firstly occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to worldwide1. On January 30, the World
Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a public health
emergency due to this rapid infection spreads. However, as one of the major cities
imported passengers from Wuhan in China9, the regional characteristics of COVID-19
in Chongqing municipality were not reported so far. Our presents study, to our
knowledge, firstly portrayed the epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological,
laboratory characteristics, treatment regimens and clinical outcomes of COVID-19
patients in Chongqing municipality, China. And we further compared the numerous
differences between severe and non-severe patients in Chongqing municipality. The
28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients from 3 designed hospitals of Chongqing
municipality is 1.5%, approximately consistent with the official fatality rate 0.91%,
lower than the 28-day mortality of mainland China including Hubei province (2.51%
[1770/70548]), reported by national official statistics as for February 16th, 2020

Recently, there are some studies described the cases of hospitalized patients with
COVID-19 in Wuhan or worldwide. First study including 41 cases of COVID-19 in
Wuhan, in which most patients had a direct history of exposure to Huanan Seafood
Wholesale Market of Wuhan, with high mortality rate (6/41, 15%) in this study5. An
extended descriptive study from 99 cases in the same hospital further revealed the
epidemiology and clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 in Wuhan6. Another study
from 138 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan found that 26% of patients
received intensive care unit (ICU) care and further compared the differences between
severe cases received ICU care with non-severe cases who did not receive ICU care7.
Two more researches including COVID-19 cases based on the big data from the
whole country delineated the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of
COVID-19 in nationwide8,13. The clinical courses and outcomes of critically ill
COVID-19 patients was recently reported14.
In our study, the majority critically severe patients are older and male, consistent with
gender difference in previous researches6,13,14. The high susceptibility of males is
similar to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection15,16. Although, only few of patients
in Chongqing are smokers, more severe cases are smokers. Previous study
demonstrated that the gene expression of ACE2, receptor of 2019-nCov, is
significantly higher in smoker's lung. ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types
related to smoking history and actively expressed in remodeled AT2 cells of smokers.
Thus, smoking history may indicate a poor prognosis due to its different infection
paths with non-smokers17.
Compared with patients who had a definite direct exposure to Huanan seafood market
in Wuhan, the epidemics in Chongqing has transmitted to the coexistence of imported
cases and local sporadic or clustered cases. As the strong epidemic control in Hubei
was implemented, clustered cases or family aggregation cases gradually compose the
majority of confirmed cases in Chongqing. Although small part of patients in
Chongqing had coexisting chronic disease, relatively less frequent than that of
patients in Wuhan6, severe patients were more likely to suffer from underlying
comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases),

resulting in the deficiency in innate and adaptive immunity of these patients. Among
the common comorbidities, we found a significant portion of patients in Chongqing
suffered from overweight and obesity, which is more common in severe patients.
Obesity-induced chronic inflammation status is well documented to contribute to the
progress of multiple diseases18. Large epidemiological studies have shown that BMI
was associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and
length of hospital stay, which has already been used in lung injury prediction score
(LIPS) to help physicians identify at-risk patients for developing ALI19. Therefore,
elderly male patients with a history of smoke and underlying comorbidities are at
increased risk of becoming critically severe if they are suffered from COVID-19
infection, which deserves more attention and intensive care treatment.
As the sequence of 2019-nCoV showing 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence
of SARS-CoV, and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV20, the clinical
characteristics of COVID-19 infection bear resemblance to SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV infection. Dominant symptoms at onset of COVID-19 in Chongqing
were still fever, dry cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and myalgia or arthralgia is more
common in the Chongqing patients. The absence of fever, especially hyperpyrexia,
may increase the difficulty to identify and diagnosis COVID-19 in clinical practice if
too much attention was given to fever detection only. Moreover, in our study, a
significant proportion of patients in Chongqing initially developed with atypical
symptoms, such as upper respiratory tract symptoms (eg, nasal congestion and
pharyngalgia) and gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, anorexia, diarrhea and nausea), and
even had no obvious symptoms, which is inconsistent with previous study reporting
upper respiratory tract and intestinal signs and symptoms are rare in Wuhan province5.
Therefore, the atypical patients and asymptomatic carriers deserves more attention to
avoid delayed or missed diagnosis. Moreover, rales and wheezes are scarcely noted
when lung auscultation was performed, due to the lack of sputum or mucus, especially
for non-severe patients. Further comparison between the severe and non-severe
patients found that severe patients are more likely to suffer from dyspnea and
confusion symptoms on disease onset, which may suggest severe complications such

as respiratory failure or septic shock, and is of great value of early identification of
critically severe cases. The median durations from symptoms onset to laboratory
diagnosis and hospital admission were 4 days and 7 days, with obvious longer time
for severe cases, which may lead to the poor outcome due to delayed medical
interventions. In general, COVID-19 in severe cases progresses rapidly to lethal
complications (ARDS, septic shock, acute cardiac injury, refractory metabolic
acidosis and so on), even leading to death. Our study demonstrates that the median
interval from symptoms onset to ARDS of severe cases was much shorter than that of
non-severe cases. It has been demonstrated that poor populations always endured a
disproportionate burden of disease and death from infectious diseases like influenzas21.
A great number of death cases in our study were poorly-educated elders with chronic
comorbidities, their illness deteriorated rapidly to severe ARDS within several days,
presented as suddenly occurred severe hypoxaemia, malignant arrhythmia, cardiac
and respiratory arrest, unfortunately death, despite of timely rescue including invasive
ventilation and other advanced medical interventions. Therefore, early diagnosis and
management of critically severe COVID-19 cases, especially poorly-educated elderly
male with chronic comorbidities, should be vigorously advocated.
Regarding to laboratory tests, consistent with most reports, peripheral
lymphocytopenia is the most crucial and common feature for COVID-19 infection. In
our study, most patients suffered from varying degrees of lymphocytopenia, especially
for critically severe patients. Lymphocytopenia is also a prominent feature for patients
with SARS-CoV, H1N1, MERS-CoV virus infection22-25. Progressive lymphopenia is
reported to occurred early in the course of SARS and reached its lowest point in the
second week in most patients, then, lymphocytes count commonly recovered in the
third week25. In terms of lymphocyte subsets, the counts of total T cells, CD4 positive
and CD8 positive T cells had reduced in COVID-19 patients on admission. Counts of
total T cells and CD3 positive T cells were significantly lower among severe patients,
accompanied by an obvious declining tendency in CD8 positive T cells, indicating an
adverse outcome. Pathological findings from the biopsy of COVID-19 death patient
implied that overactivation of T cells, manifested by increase of highly

proinflammatory Th17 and cytotoxic CD8 T cells, partially accounts for the severe
immune injury in death patient26. The phenomenon that T cell counts reduced and
functionally exhausted has been reported in previous study, which indicates high risk
for further deterioration of COVID-1927. In our study, a progressive decline of
lymphocytes and CD4 positive T cells was observed during the deterioration of illness.
Thus, the dynamic profile of lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets are of great value
for disease progression and outcomes prediction. Early studies have shown that
2019-nCoV infection increased the release of both inflammatory and
anti-inflammatory cytokines from T-helper-1 (Th1) and T-helper-2(Th2) cells,
differing from SARS or MERS-infection induced proinflammatory cytokines
secretion28,29. Our study demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-17A
were elevated in mostly patients, with significant higher level of IL-6, IL-17A and
TNF-α in severe patients, indicating an underlying relationship between pulmonary
inflammation and lung damage in 2019-nCoV patients. So far, the cytokines storm’s
effects on viral pneumonia are considerable complex and their clinical roles in severe
lung injury have not been extensively documented, therefore, further investigations
are needed to elucidate immune and inflammation response in 2019-nCoV
pathogenesis, which is of crucial importance for efficient treatments. Few of patients
presented as elevated levels of infectious parameters, but other abnormalities were
less common. While, severe patients obviously manifested more prominent
abnormalities, suggesting multiple organ dysfunction and poor outcomes. Additionally,
severe cases suffered from lower albumin and hemoglobin, suggesting the importance
of nutrition supportive treatments. As for radiologic presentations, more attention
should be paid to the cases without obvious radiological abnormalities on admission,
so as to avoid the miss or delayed diagnosis. Therefore, it is crucial important to take
symptoms, laboratory findings, radiologic findings into account to make an integrated
and thorough judgment. The MuLBSTA score, an efficient early warning model for
predicting mortality in viral pneumonia30, needs further validation in the future
practice.

Currently, no specific treatment available has been advocated for coronavirus
infection. As most of patients in Chongqing were non-severe, antiviral therapy was
commonly adopted among these patients. Empirical antibiotic therapy was merely
administered to few patients with bacterial infection evidence, and ordinary oxygen
therapy was supplied only if hyoxemia occurred. As for the severe cases,
comprehensive treatment is important. Mechanical ventilation is the main respiratory
supportive treatment for critically ill patients, which should be administered as soon
as possible if the normal oxygenation cannot maintain. Treatments were focused on
supportive therapy, which focuses on limiting further lung damages through a
combination of lung-protective ventilation to prevent ventilator-associated lung injury
and conservative fluid therapy to prevent the hyperpermeability of alveolar
endothelial and epithelial barriers and promote lung edema resorption.
Although, systematic corticosteroid treatment is not routinely recommended for
COVID-19 patients31, while based on the pathological findings of COVID-19 biopsy

that pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation26, low dosage of intravenous
methylprednisolone (usually 20-80mg for 3-5 days) was still provided to some severe
patients at early stage of the illness to suppress lung inflammation and hasten
radiographic improvement. Immunopotentiator and γ-immunoglobulin should be
administered to enhance immune responses and pathogen clearance based on the
patient’s condition. Notably, traditional Chinese medicine formulae was extensively
utilized in critically severe patients after precise and professional evaluation. Two
discharged COVID-19 patients promised to donate convalescent plasma for critically
severe patients’ further treatment. Previous Meta-Analysis reported that patients with
H5N1 influenza pneumonia who received influenza-convalescent human blood
products may have experienced a reduction in the risk for death32. Convalescent
plasma may reduce the mortality of SARS coronavirus and severe influenza
infection33. On the contrary, high-titre anti-influenza plasma was reported to confer no
significant benefit over non-immune plasma for treating patients with severe influenza
A34. Transfusion of convalescent plasma into 84 patients with Ebola virus disease was

not associated with a significant improvement in survival35. Therefore, it is still too
early to judge the efficiency of these therapy, much more studies are still needed
In summary, our study firstly demonstrated the regional disparity of COVID-19 in
Chongqing and further thoroughly compared the differences between severe and
non-severe patients in Chongqing municipality, China. The 28-day mortality of
COVID-19 patients from 3 designed hospitals of Chongqing municipality is 1.5%,
approximately consistent with the official fatality rate 0.91%, lower than that of Hubei
province and mainland China including Hubei province. Early isolation, early
diagnosis, early management, combined with the strong epidemic control in Hubei
and the effective prevention of local cluster outside Hubei might collectively
contribute to the marked reduced 28 day-mortality in Chongqing municipality.
However, for severe patients, the 28-mortality was relatively high, with much higher
when complications occurred. Notably, the 28-mortality of critically severe patients
complicated with severe ARDS is considerably as high as 44.4%. Thus, early
diagnosis and intensive care of critically severe COVID-19 cases, especially those
combined with ARDS, will be considerably essential to reduce mortality.
