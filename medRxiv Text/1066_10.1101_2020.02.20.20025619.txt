Abstract
Background
Previous studies have showed clinical characteristics of patients with the 2019 novel
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the evidence of person-to-person transmission.
Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the
clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close
contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus
carriers.

Methods
Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of
COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from
Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were
laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of
the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and
chest CT scans were reviewed.

Findings
None of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms before nucleic
acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, etc.)
during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of
ground-glass chest and 5 (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The
remaining 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during
hospitalization. These 7 cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P = 0.012) than
the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The
median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive
nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21
days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we
observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members,
which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Interpretation
The asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill
during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks
and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted
the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus
nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests
may also be recommended to the patients discharged.

Introduction
The epidemic of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infections that
developed in Wuhan, Hubei Province has spread to other provinces in China. As of 16
February 2020, 51, 857 patients with COVID-2019 have been reported and 1, 121
deaths were confirmed in China 1. To date, accumulated evidence has indicated
person-to-person transmission both in hospital and family settings2-6. Since January
23, 2020, the source city was locked down to suppress the spread of the disease;
however, the massive human movement during the traditional Chinese New Year
holidays might have fueled the spread of the disease. At present, there were at least
10,000 cases in other provinces, mostly identified through symptoms plus recent
travel history to Hubei province, China.

Genetic analysis of COVID-19 revealed that the virus was similar to severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 7. Unlike SARS-CoV, transmission of
COVID-19 occurs during the prodromal period when those infected are mildly ill, and
carry on usual activities, which contributes to the spread of infection 8,9. According to
the report on “Diamond Princess”, among the 1,723 tested travelers, 189
asymptomatic individuals were positive for the COVID-19 virus as of 17 February
2020 10, which indicated that a large number of asymptomatic carriers and mild
patients remain undiscovered in the community. It is crucial to identify and isolate
asymptomatic carriers and mild patients in order to contain the outbreaks in later
stages.

Here, we conducted an epidemiological investigation among close contacts of
COVID-19 patients in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China and identified 24
asymptomatic carriers. We sought to delineate the clinical characteristics and the
transmission potential of asymptomatic infections.

Study design and patient
All screening-identified asymptomatic COVID-19 cases in Nanjing were admitted to
the Second Hospital of Nanjing, the only hospital to admit for COVID-19 patients of
the city, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020. We retrospectively reviewed documents on
epidemiological investigation and medical records. Asymptomatic carriers were
screened from close contacts both in clinic and in community. Close contacts were
defined as: 1) cohabiting family members of the COVID-19 patient or suspected
patient; or 2) individuals who were exposed to the COVID-19 patient within 2 meters
for more than 1 hour within 2 days before the symptom onset of the patient. Nucleic
acid test was performed on the same day when the contacts were tracked. This study
was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Second Hospital of
Nanjing (approval number 2020-LS-ky003). Written informed consent was obtained
from each enrolled patient.

Data source
Upon admission, detailed contact history of each case was collected, including their
travel history in Hubei, the date/time of suspected contact, the symptom onset after
contacting with the confirmed patient, and information of other family members.
History of smoking and coexisting disorders was also collected.

For each case, computed tomography (CT) was performed upon admission.
Laboratory assessments include whole blood count, blood chemistry, coagulation test,
liver and renal function, electrolytes, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate
dehydrogenase and creatine kinase. Pharyngeal swab specimens were collected on
admission day and every other day thereafter for the COVID-19 virus test. All
samples were processed simultaneously at the Department of Clinical Laboratory of
Second Hospital of Nanjing. The symptoms presented on each case during their
hospitalization were recorded in this study, including fever, cough, nasal congestion,
dizziness, fatigue, arthralgia, etc. The virus clearance was defined as 2 continuous

negatives of nucleic acid tests.

Laboratory Nucleic Acid Test
Pharyngeal swab specimens, as described above, were tested for COVID-19 by using
qRT-PCR kits (BGI Genomics, Beijing, China) recommended by the Chinese Center
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) following WHO guidelines 11. The total
nucleic acids were isolated from 200μl virus preservation solution containing throat
swabs through automatic nucleic acid extraction system (BioPerfectus technologies
company). The primers and probe set for open reading frame1ab (ORF1 ab) were as
follows: forward primer 5’-AGAAGATTGGTTAGATGATGATAGT-3’; reverse
primer 5’-TTCCATCTCTAATTGAGGTTGAACC-3’; and probe
5’-FAM-TCCTCACTGCCGTCTTGTTGACCA- BHQ1-3’. The human GAPDH
gene was used as an internal control (forward primer
5’-TCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAGCAGG- 3’; reverse primer
5’-CAGCGTCAAAGGTGGAGGAGT- 3’; probe
5’-VIC-CCTCAAGGGCATCCTGGGCTACACTBHQ1- 3’).

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as the medians and interquartile ranges (IQR).
Categorical variables were summarized as the counts and percentages in each category.
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were applied to continuous variables, and Fisher’s exact
tests were used for categorical variables. All analyses were conducted with STATA/SE
14.0.

Result
Demographic characteristics
The demographic characteristics of the 24 asymptomatic cases are shown in Table S1.
None of the cases were healthcare workers and 8 (33.3%) had a history of recent
travel to Hubei (Case 1 and 5 were residents of Hubei (marked with blue arrows),
Case 3, 4, 6, 9, 13 and 17 have travelled to Hubei (marked with blue boxes), and the
period in Hubei might be the suspected contact time. The suspected contact time of
other cases who stay in Nanjing was marked with gray boxes according to the
epidemiological investigation). The diagnosis date of each case showed that the
number of cases who have been to Hubei decreased since Jan 28, 2020 (Figure S1).
Individuals of all ages were involved in the COVID-19 asymptomatic infection with
age ranging from 5 to 95 years old (median: 32.5 years) whereas 20.8% (5/24) of the
cases were aged below 15 years. Eight cases (33.3%) were males. Two cases had a
history of smoking (Case 1 and Case 13), and 2 were diagnosed with diabetes and
hypertension (Case 8 and Case 13).

Symptoms
Five cases (Case 2, 4, 5, 6, and 10, Figure 1) had symptoms during hospitalization.
All the five cases developed fever without chills, with body temperatures fluctuating
from 36.5°C to 38.0°C, but none presented high fever (body temperature >39°C).
Cases 4, 6 and 10 were free of other symptoms. Case 2 also had cough, fatigue and
nasal congestion, and Case 5 presented cough, fatigue, dizziness and arthralgia.
Several cases also developed transient symptoms during hospitalization, including
chills (Case 8), diarrhea (Case 21 and 22) and rashes (Case 16 and 18), that were
discussed by clinical expert panel and considered as an infusion reaction of
intravenous immunoglobulin, side effects of lopinavir/ritonavir and
darunavir/cobicistat, respectively; and were therefore not grouped as cases with

symptoms caused by COVID-19.

Radiologic and laboratory findings
On admission, all 24 cases had a chest CT scan. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical
findings of chest CT images of ground-glass or patchy shadows in the lungs (Figure
S2). Five (20.8%) cases showed stripe shadows in lungs, an atypical image finding.
CT scans of the rest 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal images. Four (16.7%) of the 24
cases had lymphopenia (<0.8 × 109 cells/L) on admission. Leukopenia was also
observed in 4 cases. Elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate
aminotransferase, creatine kinase, C-reactive protein and D-dimer were uncommon
(Table S1). During hospitalization, Case 2 and Case 5 developed leukopenia. Seven
cases presented an elevated level of serum lactose dehydrogenase, among whom 3
were accompanied with an increased level of C-reactive protein (Figure S3).

Treatment and clinical outcome
Antiviral therapy was given to 21 cases (87.5%) as initiated therapy, in which, one
case also received antibiotics therapy, antifungal therapy plus immunoglobin therapy;
and immunoglobin therapy was also given to 2 cases. All these cases were treated
with interferon atomization. None of the cases developed severe pneumonia, requiring
systemic corticosteroids treatment, mechanical ventilation, or admission to ICU, and
none died (Table S1). As of Feb 18, 2020, a total of 18 cases (75.0%) had the virus
cleared (2 continuous negatives of nucleic acid tests), among whom 9 cases were
discharged from the hospital while the rest 9 were kept in hospital for further
observation. Six cases (Case 3, 8, 13, 16, 19 and 23) had nucleic acid tests reversed to
positive after one negative result. Of particular concern, Case18 showed positive
again even after the continuous negative of nucleic acid tests. Five cases (Case 7, 9,
11, 14 and 24) had the virus cleared within a short time. The communicable period,
defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day
of continuous negative tests, ranged from 1 to 21 days (median: 9.5 days, IQR,

3.5-13.0 days, Figure S4, Table S1). Due to the censored data of 6 cases and the
indeterminate date of the exact first infection, the communicable period was
underestimated.

The characteristics of asymptomatic plus CT normal patients
We found that 7 (29.2%) cases had normal CT images and no symptoms during
hospitalization. As compared with other cases, these 7 cases were younger (median,
14.0; P = 0.012) (Table S2). There were no differences in other characteristics
between these 2 groups, possibly due to the limited sample size. The blood test of
these 7 cases showed no obvious abnormity. The median communicable period of the
7 patients was 4.0 days (IQR, 2.0-15.0).

The transmission evidence of the asymptomatic COVID-19 carrier - the
family-based transmission of Case 13
We reviewed the medical records and epidemiological history of each case and of
their family members if they were admitted in hospital for confirmed or suspected
COVID-19 infection. In the family of Case 13, Relative 1 (wife of Case 13) first
visited the hospital (Figure 2). Relative 1, a 64-year-old otherwise healthy woman,
developed fever (the highest temperature was 38.7°C), cough, fatigue and vomiting on
Jan 30, 2020. Three days later (Feb 2, 2020), she visited the hospital and was tested
positive for the COVID-19 virus. Then, epidemiological investigations and nucleic
acid tests were conducted on her son (Relative 2), daughter-in-law (Relative 3) and
Case 13. Relative 2 and 3 had developed respiratory symptoms before investigation
and were demonstrated positive for the COVID-19 virus. Nucleic acid test was also
positive for Case 13, but he had no symptoms during admission. Through
epidemiological investigation, Case 13 admitted his travel history to the city of
Huanggang, Hubei province on Jan 19-20, 2020. Relative 1, 2 and 3 are all local
Nanjing residents and denied the history of contact with any confirmed or suspected
COVID-19 patient, except for Case 13, in the recent 14 days. During hospitalization,

Case 13 had no symptoms but remained positive for the COVID-19 virus till Feb 18,
2020, which indicated that the communicable period could be as long as 29 days
(from 21 Jan to 18 Feb, 2020). Among the 3 infected family members, Relative 1
developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia and was admitted to the ICU on Feb 6, 2020.
Relative 2 and 3 demonstrated clearance of the virus on Feb 18, 2020. In brief, Case
13, an asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers transmitted the virus to his cohabiting family
members, and 1 of the infected individuals developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia
and was admitted to ICU.

Discussion
In the present study, we provided epidemiological and clinical data of 24
asymptomatic COVID-19 infections identified from the screening of close contacts in
Nanjing, Jiangsu Province. These asymptomatic cases were mildly ill as compared to
those previously reported in Wuhan, Hubei5,12,13. None of the 24 cases developed
severe pneumonia as of Feb18, 2020, and only 5 cases showed typical symptoms
during hospitalization. Similar to previous studies13,14, fever, cough and fatigue were
the main symptoms. Lymphopenia and leukopenia, previously associated with disease
severity 5,13,15, were uncommon in the asymptomatic cases of the present study.
Interestingly, we found that young cases (< 15 years old) were prone to be
asymptomatic even during hospitalization and to have a normal CT image, which
partially suggested that nucleic acid testing would be crucial to identify asymptomatic
infections in young close contacts.

Notably, we provided evidence for transmission from an asymptomatic infector to
close contacts that led to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. These findings indicate that
asymptomatic carriers can result in person-to-person transmission and should be
considered a source of COVID-19 infection. It is also implicated by the report of the
“Diamond Princess” that large numbers of asymptomatic or mild patients might have
been hiding in the community. Therefore, it is of great public health significance to

strictly monitor close contacts via multiple nucleic acid screenings to contain potential
outbreaks. Of particular, since massive movement returning to the work place and the
school is in progress, active contact tracing and strict health monitoring should remain
an important strategy in China, or worldwide. Guidance of self-protection, active
isolation of close contacts (either at home or centralized) should be continuously
highlighted. Isolation and multiple virus nucleic acid detections are also
recommended for discharged COVID-19 patients.

Our study was conducted in Nanjing, a city with adequate medications and public
health interventions. The included cases were identified from systematic screening of
the close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) both in clinic and in
community. All asymptomatic carriers were admitted to and treated in the Second
Hospital of Nanjing, and therefore the study population has strong representativeness
of the whole city. We collected the contact history and followed longitudinal nucleic
acid tests of the close contacts during their hospitalization, which provided a relatively
reliable communicable period of asymptomatic cases. However, it is notable that the
real communicable period was longer than was calculated, due to the censored data of
6 patients and the indeterminate date of the exact first infection. This study is limited
by the small sample size and lack of data on nucleic acid tests before the diagnosis
date. Large-scale multicenter studies are needed to verify our findings.
