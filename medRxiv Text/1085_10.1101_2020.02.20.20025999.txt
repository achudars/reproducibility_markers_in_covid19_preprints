ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 China coronavirus started in Dec 2019 was challenged by the lack of
accurate serological diagnostic tool for this deadly disease to quickly identify and isolate
the infected patients. The generation of COVID-19-specific antibodies is essential for such
tasks. Here we report that polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were generated by
immunizing animals with synthetic peptides corresponding to different areas of
Nucleoprotein (N) of COVID-19. The specificities of the COVID-19 antibodies were
assessed by Western Blot analysis against NPs from COVID-19, MERS and SARS.
Antibodies were used for immunohistochemistry staining of the tissue sections from
COVID-19 infected patient, as a potential diagnostic tool. A Sandwich ELISA kit was
quickly assembled for quantitation of the virus/NP of COVID-19 concentrations in the
vaccine preparations. Development of POCT is also aggressively undergoing.

Recently, a novel coronavirus, named COVID-19, broke out from Wuhan, China, had spread
rapidly around the country and now the rest of world. The pneumonia symptoms manifested
by this virus are similar to that of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which lead to acute
respiratory syndrome. Until Feb 14th, 2020, 63,932 people confirmed to be infected by
COVID-19 with 1,596 deaths in China1. Comparatively, SARS-CoV infected a total of more
than 8,000 persons with 774 deaths in 37 additional countries in 20032. More seriously, the
infections among doctors and family clusters demonstrated that it could transmission among
humans3-6, more aggressively than what were observed with the SARS outbreak in 2003.
Making the issue even worse, the virus could be widely transmitted by asymptomatic
virus-carriers to people in close contact7 and some of the patients will still carry the virus
even after they recovered from the diseases. RT-PCR has been used since the first day to
screen the suspected and now used for confirmation of diagnosis for COVID-19 infection due
to the lack of immunologic diagnostic assays for the new virus8. Molecular diagnosis requires
both special laboratory setting and very skilled laboratory personnel, which are both highly
limited in Wuhan and the heavily hit surrounding epidemic areas. False negative rate was
alarming at 30-40% with RT-PCR of throat swabs due to many different reasons. It is urgent
to develop rapid, fast and simple screening tools to find the “moving source of virus” and
quarantine them.
COVID-19 contains Nucleoprotein (N-protein), Spike glycoprotein (S-protein), Envelope
protein (E-protein) and Membrane protein (M-protein)9. Ideally, developing antibody against
the S protein will be the best approach since S plays very important roles in virus entering by
binding to the target receptor on the cell surface. However, S protein is a heavily glycosylated
protein10 and many groups have tried to express the COVID-19 S protein in mammalian cells
with limited success. On the other hand, N-protein is produced at very high levels in the virus
infected cells and is considered to be a good candidate for clinic diagnosis11.
Based on our past success experiences of generating neutralizing monoclonal antibodies
against EV71 virus and human DKK2 using synthetic peptides as immunogens12,13, we
identified a few sequences in COVID-19’s NP that could be linear epitopes with promising
antigenicity on the outer surfaces of NP. In this report, we present that, in events like this

outbreak of COVID-19 virus, using synthetic peptides as immunogens may offer us a way to
develop serological diagnostic tools in a timely manner. Our work also demonstrated that by
working closely with scientists, clinicians, biotechnology contract research organization (CRO),
IVD manufactures companies, NGOs and many different government agencies, together we
could quickly translate the genomic information of emerging pathogens to many useful
research and diagnostic tools to combat the deadly diseases such as the on-going global
crisis of OCVID-19 virus.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Peptides synthesis and antibody generation
Peptides were synthesized at DentriPro Bioscientific Ltd. Each peptide was chemically
linked to the carrier protein mcKLH through a sulfide-linker.
Balb/c mice and New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with KLH-conjugated
synthetic peptides. Bleeds were tested for titers against unconjugated peptides and purified
NP by ELISA.
Splenocytes from the immunized mice were fused with the mouse myeloma cell line
SP2/0 and cultural supernatant from individual hybridoma clones were screened against NP
by ELISA. Bulk mAbs were produced using stationary bioreactors. The concentrations of
purified IgG were determined by their absorbance at OD280.

non-fat milk for 2 h, then stained with primary antibodies for 1h, then detected with
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 50 min. After final wash, the blots were analyzed
using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Life Technologies).

Immunohistochemistry Staining
Following Novolink Polymer’s instruction, dewaxed lung tissue sections were immersed in
0.3% H2O2 to reduce the background of endogenous peroxidase, incubated with the primary
antibodies for 60 min at 37 °C, treated with enhancer for 30 min at 37 °C, then probed with
HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 mins at 37 °C. The DAB substrate was used to
develop the color, followed by counter-staining and dehydrating the sections. The sections
were examined under microscope.

Sandwich ELISA and Rapid Immunochromatographic Assay(RICA)
Anti-COVID-19 NP rabbit pAbs were conjugated with biotin according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
For Sandwcih ELISA, as described previously14,15, each well was coated with different rabbit
anti-COVID-19 NP pAbs and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS. Samples were diluted in 3%
BSA-PBS and incubated in the wells for 1 h, probed with the Biotin-conjugated rabbit
anti-COVID-19 NP pAbs diluted in 3% BSA-PBS, then detected with HRP-Streptavidin. After
washes, chromogenic HRP substrate TMB was added and the reaction was stopped with 0.1
M H2SO4 and absorbance was measured at 450 nm.
For RICA, Anti-COVID-19 NP rabbit pAb (Pept-4) was dispensed on a nitrocellulose
membrane as a “test” (T) line, and goat anti-rabbit IgG was fixed as a “control” (C) line.
Quantum Dots (QD) pre-coated with a layer of silica were covalently conjugated with the
Anti-COVID-19 NP rabbit pAb (Pept-3) and distributed on a glass fiber. The sample pad,
conjugate pad, nitrocellulose membrane, and absorbent pad were attached to a lamination
pad and cut to fit in a plastic cartridge. Sera were diluted with Tris buffer containing 1%
NP-40 and two drops of the sample were loaded to the test strip and wait for 15 minutes
then scanned with SkanFlexi X200 with the associated software to calculate the
concentration of the antigen based on the intensities the T and C lines.

RESULTS
Design and synthesis of peptides as immunogens for generation of COVID-19-specifc
antibodies
NPs of coronavirus are shared with very high homology between all seven coronaviruses.
Cross-reactivity among NPs of human coronaviruses were reported by Yu’s group16. In this
study, 5 linear sequences, SDNGPQSNQRNAPRITFG (Pept-1,a.a.2-19),
PSDSTGSNQNGERSGARSKQ (Pept-2, a.a.20-39), PGSSRGTSPARMAGNGGDAALA (Pept-3,
a.a.199-220),

PKKDKKKKADETQALPQRQKK (Pept-4, a.a.368-388) and GGSADSTQA (Pept-5,

a.a.413-419) were selected as the potential linear epitopes on the outer surfaces of
COVID-19 NP.
Normally, the rotations/conformations of the very ends of proteins are more close to the ones

of the synthetic peptides so the antibodies generated with synthetic peptides corresponding to

the NT and CT of the target protein have higher possibilities to bind to the native target proteins.

Pept-1 (SDNGPQSNQRNAPRITFG) is located at the very end of N terminal and Pept-5
(GGSADSTQA, a.a.413-419) are the last 9 amino acids of COVID-19 NP. Pept-1 shares 88.9%
identify with the SARS NP, and no homology to the MERS’ and the other 4 coronaviruses’ NP.
Pept-5 is 100% identical in COVID-19 and SARS, no homology with the rest 5 viruses. The
other three sequences were selected based more on the specificity and immunogenicity
other than the locations in the protein. Pept-2 has only 70% identity to SARS’s in amino acid
composition but are not in continued sequence and the antibodies generated by Pept-2 will
have the highest possibility to be COVID-19 specific. Pept-3 has 77% homology with SARS and
50% identity to MERS at the very end of NT of the peptide. Pept-4 has the strongest
immunogenicity and its NT has very high homology with both SARS and MERS.

Generations of pAbs and mAbs to COVID-19 NP.
Five groups of mice, 3 mice per group, were immunized with the 5 KLH-peptides
respectively. On day 12, the tail bleeds were collected and examined by ELISA against both
the corresponding peptides and the full length COVID-19 NP. As shown in Table 1-1, the
mice immunized with Pept-4-KLH not only generated strong immune responses against the

immunizing peptide, but also developed antibodies bound to COVID-19 NP. On day 13, the
spleenocytes were isolated from the immunized mice and fused with SP2/0 mouse myeloma
cells to generate mouse hybridoma cells.
Weak immune reactions against corresponding peptides were observed with mice
immunized with Pept-1-KLH or Pept-3-KLH but no significant reactions with the full length
COVID-19 protein were observed. Immunization with Pept-2-KLH and Pept-5-KLH failed to
induce any significant immunization responses at such short time of period.
Started the same time, three groups of New Zealand White rabbits (two each) were
immunized with Pept-2-KLH, Pept-3-KLH and Pept-4-KLH respectively. On day 21, sera were
examined against the NP by ELISA. As shown in Table 1-2, similar to what been observed in
mice, rabbits immunized with Pept-4-KLH generated the best immune responses against the
COVID-19 NPs, while moderate antibody titers were also observed in rabbits immunized
with Pept-2-KLH and Pept-3-KLH. All animals’ titers increased significantly from day 21 to day
28, but some reached plateau after day 28. Polyclonal antibodies were purified using Protein
A column for preparation of conjugations and pairing.

Screening of mouse anti-COVID-19 monoclonal antibodies
On day 21, culture supernatants from 752 stable monoclonal hybridomas were screened
against NPs, and more than 100 positive clones were obtained. On day 25, the culture
supernatants not only were tested for the stable productions of monoclonal ant-COVID-19
NP antibodies but also examined their cross-reactivity towards the NPs from SARS and MERS
(Partial of the data were shown in Table 1-3). As you can see, clone 6F10 mAb had the
highest titer against COVID-19’s NP with minimal cross-reactivity to SARS’s NP, and no
significant reactivity to MERS’s NP. On the contrary, clone 3A3 and 1F7 reacted equally well
to NPs from COVID-19, SARS and MERS. Clone 3A10 and 8C3 recognized NPs from COVID-19
and SARS, but not the one from MERS. Our data suggested that even with such short of
sequence, there could be many different antigen epitopes that can generate different mAbs
with different specificities.

As shown in Fig.2A and 2B, tested against purified recombinant NPs from COVID-19, SARS
and MERS, both rabbit pAbs (Pept-3) and mAb 6F10 (Pept-4) reacted with COVID-19 NP very
well with a clear band around 50 kDa while the rabbit pAbs showed some extend level of
cross-reactivity with NPs from SARS and MERS (recombinant MERS was GST-tagged). Most
importantly, mouse mAb 6F10 showed very good specificity to COVID-19 NP with minimal
cross-reactivity to the ones from SARS and MERS.
The biopsy samples of pulmonary sarcoidosis (after ablation) were collected from patients
either confirmed with COVID-19 virus infection by RT-PCR or diagnosed with non-specific
lung infection. The biopsy samples were stained with anti-COVID-19 pAbs (Pept-2). As shown
in Fig. 2C and 2D, under the microscope view (400X), there were four cells with very
distinguish dark-brown staining in the COVID-19 infected patient’s biopsy tissue. The staining
was evenly distributed in the cytosol with inclusion body appearances. No nuclear staining.
Those four stained cells were located inside the alveolar cavity, and look like macrophages.
No brown staining was observed in the negative control sample from the patient with
non-specific infection.

Development of Sandwich ELISA and rapid mmunochromatographic assays
i

The 96-well plate were coated with different NP pAbs, and paired with different Biotin-labeled

NP pAbs. The best combination was coating with anti-COVID-19 NP pAbs (Pept-3) and paired with

Biotinylated anti-COVID-19 NP pAbs (Pept-4).

A Sandwich ELISA kit was quickly assembled for quantitation of inactivated COVID-19
NP/virus concentration in vaccine. The assay kit had a limit of detection around 100ng/mL
with a linear range between 200-1600ng/mL (see Fig. 3A).
To race against the time, more than 6 different immunochromatographic technology
platforms were attempted, including

As shown in Fig. 3B, the limit of detection of

different aspects has been aggressively pursuing.

In this report, we demonstrated that, in event like this outbreak when only the gene
sequence information was available, we could design and synthesis the peptides as the
immunogens to quickly generate both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies for
development of diagnostic tools against the emerging diseases. Polyclonal anti-COVID-19 NP
antibodies were successfully used as pathology tool for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. The
Sandwich ELISA kit has been used to help the vaccine developers to monitor the virus
expression levels in the cultures in the process of optimization of manufacture parameters.
