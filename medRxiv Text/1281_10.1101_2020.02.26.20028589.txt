Abstract

Importance

Heart

injury can

be easily induced by viral infection such

as adenovirus

and

enterovirus. However, whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes heart

injury and hereby impacts mortality has not yet been fully evaluated.

Objective

To explore whether heart injury occurs in COVID-19 on admission and hereby

aggravates mortality later.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A

single-center

retrospective

cohort

study

including

188

COVID-19

patients

admitted from December 25, 2019 to January 27, 2020 in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital,

China; follow up was completed on February 11, 2020.

Exposures

High levels

of heart injury indicators

on admission

(hs-TNI; CK; CK-MB; LDH;

α-HBDH).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Mortality in hospital and days from admission to mortality (survival days).

Results

Of 188 patients with COVID-19, the mean age was 51.9 years (standard deviation:

14.26; range: 21~83 years) and 119 (63.3%) were male. Increased hs-TnI levels on

admission tended to occur in older patients and patients with comorbidity (especially

hypertension). High hs-TnI on admission (≥ 6.126 pg/mL), even within the clinical

normal range (0~28 pg/mL), already can be associated with higher mortality. High

hs-TnI was associated with increased inflammatory levels (neutrophils, IL-6, CRP, and

PCT) and decreased immune levels (lymphocytes, monocytes, and CD4

and CD8

T

cells). CK was not associated with mortality. Increased CK-MB levels tended to occur

in male patients and patients with current smoking. High CK-MB on admission was

associated

with

higher

mortality.

High

CK-MB

was

associated

with

increased

inflammatory levels and decreased lymphocytes. Increased LDH and α-HBDH levels

tended to occur in older patients and patients with hypertension. Both high LDH and

α-HBDH on admission were associated with higher mortality. Both high LDH and

α-HBDH were associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased immune

levels. hs-TNI level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r=

Conclusions and Relevance

Heart injury signs arise in COVID-19, especially in older patients, patients with

hypertension and male patients with current smoking. COVID-19 virus might attack

heart

via

inducing

inflammatory

storm.

High

levels

of

heart

injury

indicators

on

admission are associated with higher mortality and shorter survival days. COVID-19

patients with signs of heart injury on admission must be early identified and carefully

managed by cardiologists, because COVID-19 is never just confined to respiratory

injury.

Introduction

Viral infection is a common cause of heart injury such as myocarditis. It is well

known that adenovirus, enterovirus and herpesvirus are the most common infectious

etiologies for heart injury [1]. Since coronavirus-related carditis was first reported in

1980

[2],

increasing

studies

noted

that

coronavirus

is

an

uncommon

but

unneglectable pathogen for heart injury. For instance, we found the coronavirus of

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 in China had no

obvious connections with heart injury. However, it was reported that the coronavirus

of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2012 in Saudi Arabia could cause

acute myocarditis and heart failure [3].

Methods

Study population

From Dec 25, 2019 to Jan 27, 2020, 188 COVID-19 patients admitted to Wuhan

Jinyintan Hospital (Hubei, China) were selected. All enrolled patients were definitely

diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia according to the previously reported criteria

[7]. Patients with missing clinical information were excluded. Age of the enrolled

patients ranged from 21 to 83 years old. Up to Feb 11, 2020, follow up in hospital

was completed for all patients. One hundred and forty-five patients were cured and

discharged while 43 patients deceased in hospital. This research was approved by the

Review Board of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. Written informed consent was waived

because this research was retrospective observation and deindividuation.

Data collection

Data were retrieved from electronic medical records. Demographic and clinical

parameters

included

age,

exposure,

history of family infection, smoking status, comorbidity, initial symptoms and signs,

vital signs on admission, complications on admission and drug treatment regimen.

Primary outcome was mortality in hospital. Days from admission to death (survival

days) were also calculated for deceased patients. Whether transfer to intensive care

unit (ICU) was recorded as a secondary outcome.

Survival days were obviously shorter for deceased patients with high hs-TNI (median:

7 days) when compared to patients with low and moderate hs-TNI (median: 11 and

8.5 days, respectively), although it was hard to reach statistical significance because

the deceased cases in the three groups were extremely uneven distribution.

As shown in Table 3, increased CK-MB levels were more likely to occur in male

patients and patients with current smoking. High CK-MB on admission (≥ 18 U/L) was

associated with higher mortality (34.9%). High CK-MB was significantly associated

with increased inflammatory levels (WBC, neutrophils, CRP and PCT) and decreased

lymphocytes levels. High CK-MB was independent of acute respiratory symptoms and

respiratory failure (P> 0.05). CK was not associated with mortality (Supplementary

table 1).

As shown in Table 4, increased LDH levels were more likely to occur in older

patients and patients with hypertension. High LDH was significantly associated with

acute respiratory symptoms and respiratory failure (P< 0.05). High LDH on admission

(median: 11 days, both), although it was hard to reach statistical significance because

the deceased cases in the three groups were extremely uneven distribution.

As shown in Table 5, increased α-HBDH levels were more likely to occur in older

patients and patients with hypertension. High α-HBDH was significantly associated

with acute respiratory symptoms and respiratory failure (P< 0.05). High α-HBDH on

admission (≥ 305 U/L) was associated with higher mortality (53.4%). High α-HBDH

was significantly associated with increased inflammatory levels (WBC, neutrophils,

IL-6, CRP and PCT) and decreased immune levels (lymphocytes, monocytes, T cells

and CD4

T cells).

As shown in Figure 1, the higher hs-TNI on admission was, the shorter survival

days would be. hs-TNI level on admission was significantly negatively correlated with

survival days (r= -0.42, 95% CI= -0.64~-0.12, P=0.005). The higher LDH on admission

was, the shorter survival days would be. LDH level on admission was significantly

negatively

correlated with survival

days (r= -0.35, 95% CI= -0.59~-0.05, P=0.022).

CK-MB and α-HBDH were not significantly correlated with survival days (both P>

0.05).

Discussion

In this study, we first assessed the associations between heart injury indicators

and mortality in COVID-19 patients. hs-TNI is a biomarker released into blood once

myocardial necrosis. Aberrant hs-TNI usually specifically indicates acute myocardial

infarction

[8].

In

(aberrant hs-TNI > 28 pg/mL), which was consistent to the previous reports [9, 10].

More importantly, we found high hs-TnI on admission (≥ 6.126 pg/mL), even within

the clinical upper normal limit (≤ 28 pg/mL), already can be associated with higher

mortality.

Therefore, we suggest the clinical upper normal limit of hs-TNI should be lowered for

Lancet

on

The

in 2018 [11], that reclassification of hs-TNI for acute coronary syndrome in

emergency departments in order to improve clinical outcomes.

CK-MB

which

reflect

myocarditis and myocardial infarction. After acute myocardial infarction, CK-MB will

begin to increase at 2-4 hours, peak at 12 hours, and return to baseline within 48-72

hours

[12, 13]. In our study, we found

CK-MB increase

tended to occur in

male

patients and patients with current smoking. Approximately 10.1% COVID-19 patients

had CK-MB exceeding clinical upper normal limit (24 U/L) on admission. High CK-MB

on admission (≥ 18 U/L), even within the clinical upper normal limit (≤ 24

U/L),

already was associated higher mortality. These results proved heart injury such as

viral myocarditis or myocardial infarction indeed occurred in COVID-19 on admission

and predicted adverse clinical outcomes.

LDH and α-HBDH are two kinds of myocardial enzymes. LDH and α-HBDH mainly

exist

in

myocardia

and

would

be

into

blood

injury.

Although LDH and α-HBDH increases are relatively less specific in heart injury, they

also

play

important

helping

roles

in

recognition

of

myocarditis

or

myocardial

infarction [14, 15]. In our study, we found increases of LDH and α-HBDH were more

likely to occur in older patients and patients with hypertension. Both high LDH and

α-HBDH on admission were associated with higher mortality. In addition, we found

high LDH and α-HBDH were associated with more acute respiratory symptoms such

as breathlessness, chest distress or pain, dyspnea or respiratory failure on admission.

This result also implied that the increases of LDH and α-HBDH might not be specific

due to heart injury. LDH and α-HBDH increases might not merely be induced by heart

injury, but also be induced by lung or other organs injury. Nevertheless, LDH level on

admission was significantly negatively correlated with survival days.

The

potential

mechanism

for

COVID-19-caused

heart

injury

might

be

virus-induced inflammatory storm. Inflammatory cells infiltration and inflammatory

cytokines release can directly lead to apoptosis or necrosis of myocardial cells [16,

17]. In our study, we found high levels of heart injury indicators were associated with

increased

levels

of

inflammatory

cells

(WBC

and

neutrophils)

and

inflammatory

cytokines (IL-6 and CRP). Therefore, we speculated that COVID-19 infection would

cause

heart

injury

such

as

myocarditis

or

myocardial

infarction

by

inducing

inflammatory cells infiltration and inflammatory cytokines storm. Early and special

anti-inflammatory

myocardium [18]. Another potential mechanism for COVID-19-caused heart injury

might be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)–mediated direct injury to heart.

ACE2 as a human cell receptor had a strong binding affinity to the Spike protein of

2019-nCoV, namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)

[19].

ACE2

[20].

Therefore,

SARS-CoV-2 of COVID-19 might directly attack heart by binding ACE2 on myocardial

cells.

Some limitations existed in this study. First, we only assessed heart injury from

the perspective of

serum myocardial

enzymes

and protein. It would be

better if

echocardiography and electrocardiograph were also measured in this study. Secondly,

it would be better if we could assess heart injury-specific mortality in the future

study with a larger sample size. Thirdly, we have not been able to obtain myocardial

patients.

myocardial injury from the golden standard of pathology. Although the first autopsy

of COVID-19 patient was completed and pulmonary pathology was obtained on Feb

16,

2020

in

Wuhan

Jinyintan

Hospital

(China),

it

remains

a

long

way

to

remind

clinicians to focus on cardiac pathology for COVID-19 infection. Our present results

also can remind pathologists to pay attention

to cardiac pathology in the future,

especially for those deceased COVID-19 patients who had high heart injury indicators

on admission.

Conclusions

In summary, heart injury signs arise in COVID-19 on admission and would be

associated

with

subsequently

higher

and

earlier

mortality.

COVID-19

virus

might

attack heart via inducing inflammatory storm or attack heart directly. Clinicians must

beware of heart injury indicators for COVID-19 patients, especially for those with

older

age,

hypertension

and

current

smoking.

In

order

to

maximally

prevent

or

rescue heart injury-related mortality in COVID-19, cardiologists must participate in

early and special managements for patients with COVID-19.
