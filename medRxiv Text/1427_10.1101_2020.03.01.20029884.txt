ABSTRACT
Background
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to expand across the world.
Though both the number of cases and mortality rate in children and adolescents is reported to be
low in comparison to adults, limited data has been reported on the outbreak with respect to
pediatric patients. To elucidate information, we utilized crowdsourced data to perform a
preliminary epidemiologic analysis of pediatric patients with COVID-19
Methods
In this observational study, data was collected from two open-access, line list crowdsourced online
databases. Pediatric cases of COVID-19 were defined as patients ≤19 years of age with a laboratory
confirmed diagnosis. The primary outcomes were case counts and cumulative case counts.
Secondary outcomes included days between symptoms onset and first medical care and days
between first medical care and reporting. Tertiary outcomes were rate of travel to Wuhan, rate of
infected family members and rates of symptoms.
Results
A total of 82 patients were included. The median age was 10 [IQR: 5-15] years. Patients from
mainland China (outside Hubei) accounted for 46.3% of cases, while the remaining 53.7% of cases
were international. Males and females accounted for 52.4% and 32.9% of cases, respectively, with
the remaining 14.6% being designated as unknown. A male skew persisted across subgroup
analyses by age group (p=1.0) and location (inside/outside China) (p=0.22). While the number of
reported international cases has been steadily increasing over the study period, the number of
reported cases in China rapidly decreased from the start point. The median reporting delay was 3
[IQR: 2-4.8] days. The median delay between symptom onset and first seeking medical care was

1 [IQR: 0-3.25] day. In international cases, time to first seeking medical care was a median of 2.5
days longer than in China (p=0.04). When clinical features were reported, fever was the most
common presentation (68.0%), followed by cough (36.0%).
Conclusions
The number of reported international pediatric COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing. COVID-19
infections are, to-date, more common in males than females in both the children and adolescent
age groups. Additionally, this male predominance remains the case both inside and outside of
China. Crowdsourced data enabled early analysis of epidemiologic variables in pediatric patients
with COVID-19. Further data sharing is required to enable analyses that are required to understand
the course of this infection in children.

INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is rapidly expanding across the world and
presents a significant public health emergency with the potential of becoming pandemic. 1 As of
March 1, 2020, cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over 60 countries. In early stages of
epidemics with emerging pathogens, real-time analysis of accurate and robust epidemiological and
clinical data is essential to developing interventional strategies and guiding public health decisionmaking.2,3 Such data can provide insight into infectivity, routes of transmission, disease severity,
and outcomes, thus enabling epidemiologic modelling and improved public health responses.4,5
Line list data, which includes individual patient-level data on important epidemiological and
clinical variables, is rarely available early during an outbreak with a novel pathogen.5 However,
recognizing the utility of such data and its ability to provide for real-time analyses, multiple
academic groups have been curating line list data using crowdsourcing and openly sharing the data
with the scientific community.4,5 Crowdsourcing enables the collection of data from multiple
platforms including health-care-oriented social networks, government and public health agencies,
and global news sources.
Sun et al. recently reported the first epidemiological analysis of crowdsourced data in 507 COVID19 patients.5 However, the number of reported pediatric cases, at least in the early stages of this
outbreak, is limited. In a recent analysis, of the 44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China, only
2.1% were in pediatric patients (≤19 years of age).6 The reason for this remains unknown but may
be due to underreporting of pediatric cases, as well as a combination of biologic and epidemiologic
factors. During both the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, a limited number of cases with milder symptoms, fewer
hospitalizations, and less mortality were observed in children as compared to adults.7–9

As children and adolescents represent a unique patient group, pediatric specific analyses of
epidemiologic data may enable a better understanding of COVID-19 in these patients and provide
situational-awareness to the pediatric health community. In this study, we analyzed pediatric cases
of COVID-19 outside Hubei province, China collected from two crowdsourced curated individual
line list data. We present early data on case counts, travel history, time between symptom onset,
seeking medical care, and reporting, and symptomatology.

METHODS
Study Design
In this observational study, we collected data on children and adolescent cases of laboratory
confirmed COVID-19 from two open access crowdsourced line list databases sets through March
1, 2020. Due to the format of reporting age, as well as significant lack of any age data for most
patients, cases from within Hubei province of China were not able to be analyzed. As such, only
cases from outside the Hubei province in China and international cases were included. However,
patients who lived in Hubei and were repatriated were included in the analysis.
The methods of data curation for each of the used line lists has been previously published.4,5 In
brief, the data curated by Sun et al. for China was collected from DXY.cn, a social network for
Chinese health-care professionals, which provides real-time coverage of COVID-19 with deidentified patient data reported directly by public health agencies or state media. 5 Each report is
linked to an original source to allow for authentication. In addition, for international cases, data
was curated from media sources and national health agencies. Their data is updated regularly and
is freely available on the website of the Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological + Sociotechnical systems website of Northeastern University. The second data set by Xu et al. (Open

COVID-19 Data Curation Group) of confirmed COVID-19 cases was curated from multiple
sources including World Health Organization (WHO) reports, national departments of health, and
Chinese local, provincial, and national health authorities. 4 Their data is freely available online via
Google Drive.
As only de-identified patient data from publicly available databases was used in this study, no
patient consent was obtained, and no ethical approval was required. This study is reported in
compliance with Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
(STROBE) Statement guidelines for observational studies (Supplement 1).
Data Collection
Data on pediatric patients were collected from both of the line lists. This included age or age range,
sex, location, date of symptom onset, date of seeking medical care, and date of COVID-19
reporting. When available, travel history, information on infected relatives, and symptomatology
were also collected.
After collecting cases from both databases, overlap of patients was assessed using age, location,
and the three above mentioned dates. In the event of suspected duplicate patients, one case was
removed from the dataset.
Study Definitions and Outcomes
Pediatric cases of COVID-19 were defined as patients ≤19 years of age with a laboratory
confirmed diagnosis of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.5 The definition of a
laboratory confirmed cases is a patient blood or respiratory tract sample positive for SARS-CoV2 by quantitative RT-PCR, or presence of viral genome highly homologous to reference sequence
for SARS-CoV-2. Due to the format of data reporting from some Chinese provinces employing

age ranges instead of raw age, the following classifications were employed for this study: children
(0-≤12 years of age) and adolescents (13-≤19 years of age).
The primary outcome of this epidemiologic analysis was case counts and cumulative case counts.
Secondary outcomes included days between symptoms onset and first visit to hospital or clinic,
and days between first visit to hospital or clinic and reporting. Tertiary outcomes included rate of
travel to Wuhan, China, rate of family members with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, and rates of
symptoms.
Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables were reported as frequency (%) and continuous variables as median
(interquartile range). Subgroups analyzed included age range, sex, and location. Case counts were
compared between subgroups using Fisher’s exact test. Weekly case counts were analyzed using
the date of reporting. Differences in delays between symptoms onset and first visit to hospital or
clinic and days between first visit to hospital or clinic and diagnostic confirmation were compared
between subgroups using Wilcoxon test. All statistical analyses were performed using R (version
3.6.1 (2019-07-05)) with a p-value of <0.05 being considered as significant.

RESULTS
After combing the two line lists, a total of 100 pediatric cases were identified. Pediatric cases
represented 3.0% of Sun et al.5 line list and 0.5% of the Xu et al.4 line list. Following removal of
18 duplicates, a total of 82 pediatric patients were included in this analysis. The date range of cases
was January 21, 2020 to February 28, 2020. Patients from mainland China (outside Hubei
province) accounted for 38 (46.3%) cases, while the remaining 44 cases (53.7%) were
international. Within China, Yunnan province accounts for the most cases (n=8, 21.1% of cases in
China). A breakdown of cases within China by province is presented in Supplement 2. Outside

China, Japan has the most pediatric cases included in this analysis (n=15), accounting for 34.1%
of all international cases. In total, cases from 14 countries were included (Table 1).
The median age of patients was 10 [IQR: 5-15] years. The distribution of patients by age is
presented in Figure 1. No significant differences in age were detected between cases inside and
outside China (10 [IQR: 5-15] inside vs. 9 [IQR: 5-15.5] outside; p=0.91). For 13 patients (15.9%),
only an age range was available. To include these patients in further analyses, cases were split into
two age groups based on how data was reported in the line lists. There were 53 children (65.6%)
between 0-12 years and 27 adolescents (32.9%) between 13-19 years, with 2 missing age range
data (2.4%).
Males accounted for 52.4% of included cases, females accounted for 32.9% and 14.6% were
unknown (Table 2). When broken down by age range, no significant differences were observed
between the proportion of cases between age groups (p=1.0), with a male skew of cases seen within
both (Table 2). When compared by location, males accounted for 52.6% of cases within China and
57.3% outside China (p=0.22).
A timeline of cases and cumulative cases is presented in Figure 2 by age range and Figure 3 by
location. In both children and adolescents, weekly cases peaked between January 20-26, 2020. The
number of reported cases continued to drop reaching a low in mid-February, then undergoing a
rapid increase sustained through to the end of the study period, driven by new international cases.
Within China, the number of weekly cases steadily decreased from the beginning of the study,
with no new cases added to the databases since February 3-9, 2020. The number of cumulative
international cases has been constantly increasing over the study period with a more rapid increase
in recent weeks.

The median delay between first visit to hospital/clinic and reporting was 3 [IQR: 2.0-4.8] days
(n=14). No significant differences in this delay time was observed for subgroups of age (p=0.29)
or location (inside/outside China) (p=0.67).
The median delay between the onset of symptoms and first visit to hospital/clinic was 1 [IQR: 03.3] day (n=20). There was no significant difference with respect to age subgroup (p=0.93).
However, within China this delay was significantly shorter with a median duration of 1 day [IQR:
0-2.5] versus 3.5 [IQR: 1.5-7] days abroad (p=0.04).
A total of 14 (17.1%) cases were in patients who lived in Wuhan, China and were repatriated.
Among the remaining 68 cases, 25 (30.5%) patients had a history of travel to Wuhan. No
information on travel history was available for the other 43 (52.4%) patients.
A total of 29 (35.4%) patients were noted to have an infected family member. In one adolescent
case in Japan, the patient was the son of a physician who had earlier tested positive for the virus.
Data on patient symptomatology was available in 25 (30.5%) of the cases. Fever was the most
common symptom, present in 17 (68.0%) of those cases, while 2 (8.0%) cases were asymptomatic.
Cough was reported in 9 (36.0%) cases. A breakdown of patient symptoms is presented in Table
3. Data on disease severity, need for hospitalization or intensive care support, and patient outcome
was not available for analysis.

DISCUSSION
Real-time analysis of crowdsourced individual line list data provides a tool for monitoring
outbreaks with novel pathogens in early stages, as witnessed with Ebola. 5,10 Though this data is
often difficult to obtain at the start of an outbreak, thanks to the efforts of multiple academic teams
in curating line list data from multiple sources, we have been able to gain some insight into the

current COVID-19 outbreak in children.4,5 Though this data cannot replace official data and
analyses provided by national and international health agencies, it can enable rapid analysis of data
and dissemination of key information in the preliminary stages of an outbreak when minimal other
data is available, and, as applied in this study, early data on specific subsets of patients.5
This study combined data from two crowdsourced line lists to obtain a sample of pediatric patients
with COVID-19 in order to gain some preliminary insights into the outbreak in children and
adolescents. Cases in these patients represented only a small proportion of each line list.
Reports from both the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO on the
current COVID-19 outbreak, have found pediatric patients represent a small proportion of all
cases, with an attack rate of 2.4%.6,11 Children with COVID-19 appear to have milder symptoms
as noted by a severe case rate of 2.5%, with only 0.2% developing critical illness. 11 Similar finding
of limited cases and milder symptoms in children was observed in both SARS and MERS
outbreaks.7–9 However, whether the limited number of pediatric COVID-19 cases is due to less
susceptibility or milder presentation leading to missed detection remains unknown. Of note, initial
screening criteria of COVID-19 in China focused on cases of suspected pneumonia. 12
The mild nature of pediatric cases is likely multifactorial. Age related differences in innate
immunity13,14, in which monocytes and macrophages may play an important role controlling an
emerging viral pathogen, may be partially responsible for the milder observed symptoms and
asymptomatic cases. Others have suggested that respiratory tract health, including less exposure
to pollution, as well as lung epithelial cell senescence and immunosenescence of immune cells of
the respiratory system may play a role.15 Cai et al. reported that while COVID-19 viral shredding
in respiratory specimens is longer in children than adults and also observed in the stool specimens,

the virus was not detected in serum samples.16 The absence of viremia likely contributes to the
lack of serve illness in pediatric cases.
In both MERS and SARS outbreaks, children were less likely to develop severe respiratory distress
seen in adults, experiencing a pneumonia or common cold symptoms.7–9 Exposure of young
children in China to other coronaviruses, such as OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1,17 may impart
some immunity not reinforced in older individuals, explaining partial protection against COVID19 in this population.18,19
Comorbidities have been reported to be associated with severity of COVID-19 infection.20,21 As
children generally have less comorbidities, this may also in part explain the lack of serious
infections in children and contribute to decreased detection. Moreover, behavioral differences and
limited travel as compared to adults may have also explained the limited number of cases early in
the outbreak.5
In our data set, children under 10 years old made up a near equal proportion of included cases.
This is different than data presented in a recent Chinese CDC report which showed a slightly
greater number of cases in those over age 10 (416 aged 0-9 vs. 549 aged 10-19).6 Whether this is
due to the availability of cases in the line lists or a higher detection of cases in young children
outside China is unclear, however, this should be monitored going forward. In general, infants and
young children are often at increased risk of poor outcomes from respiratory infections, 22 which
has not yet been witnessed with COVID-19 from reported aggregate data.6
Interestingly, a significant male skew in cases was observed in pediatric patients throughout the
analysis. This sex skew was not observed among children in SARS or MERS. In adults, cases of
COVID-19 are reported to be skewed towards men also.5,6 However, explanations applied to
adults, such as the high prevalence rates of smoking23 and comorbidities (i.e. cardiovascular

disease and diabetes)24,25 in Chinese men as compared to women, would not apply to children.
Though adult females produce more robust inflammatory responses as compared to men, the
opposite is true in infants and children.26 Young males produce stronger inflammatory responses
than females.26 However, females, beginning at birth and persisting throughout adulthood, have
higher numbers of CD4+ T cells and higher CD4/CD8 T cell ratios26, though the potential impact
of this on COVID-19 infections is unknown.
In respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) related illness, a common respiratory tract infection in young
children, prevalence rates are reported to be the same in males and females, however, males are
more likely to suffer from more severe infections requiring hospitalization.27–29 We hypothesize
that a similar pattern may be observed with COVID-19, with males developing more symptoms,
thus leading to increased detection and reporting in these patients.
In this analysis, the male skew persisted through subgroup analysis by age, with no difference in
the rate of infected males in children versus adolescents. As such, the impact of the protective
effects of estrogen receptor signaling in females observed in SARS may be minimal,30 as we expect
a more balanced sex ratio in younger children as compared to older pubescent females.
To account for the skew in the sex ratio in the Chinese population as a potential confounder, we
compared the rate of cases by sex inside and outside China, finding no significant differences.
Larger epidemiologic studies are needed to confirm this sex skew in children and adolescents
COVID-19 cases and, if persistent, further investigations are needed to understand this
phenomenon.
The weekly counts of reported cases in this study showed unique trends based on geographical
region. In China, a rapid drop from a peak at study initiation on January 20 to no new cases after
February 9 was observed. Within Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, all notifiable cases after

January 22 were in patients ≥ 15 years of age. 20,21 In the study by Sun et al., they used January 18
as the date when media and public awareness of COVID-19 became more pronounced, followed
by significant governmental efforts aimed at containment. 5 No cases in this data set were reported
before this date. Whether the decrease in new cases in China is due to reporting difficulties/lack
of case inclusion in the line lists or effectiveness of Chinese public health interventions aimed at
slowing the spread of the virus, or a combination of both, is unclear.
Internationally, the number of reported cases has steadily increased with a faster pace in recent
weeks. We expect that this trend will continue, especially as testing becomes more readily
available in new countries. In Figure 3A, a small dip in reported cases in the last few days of
February is observed. We believe that this is primarily due to the delay in reporting, which was
calculated to be a median of 3 days from the first medical visit in this study. As such, we expect
to see the number of cases in the last week increase in the coming days.
Though analyzed based on a small subset of included patients, patients in China were found to first
receive medical attention a median of 2.5 days sooner after initiation of symptoms than those
abroad. We hypothesize that this is due to heightened awareness of COVID-19 in China and
perception of decreased risk of COVID-19 infection among those abroad. However, this is
opposite of the trend observed by Sun et al., which may be due to a higher number of international
travelers in their data set.5
Data on patient symptoms was only available for 25 patients. Fever was the most common
presentation, followed by cough, with only 2 being asymptomatic. However, how representative
this small sample is remains unclear. Moreover, as this data was not collected directly for the
purpose of this analysis, we cannot verify if a systematic review of symptoms was performed.
Nonetheless, our data was similar to a case series of COVID-19 in 10 children, which observed

13

fever in 80% and cough in 60%. While the WHO has noted that COVID-19 appears to present
differently from SARS, fever followed by cough, was the most common presentation of SARS in
children.7,11 Further progression of COVID-19 illness in children developing more severe
symptoms requires further data and analysis from the limited number of severe cases reported.
The WHO Joint Mission reported that many pediatric cases were identified through contact tracing
in households with infected adults and reported many pediatric patients had only mild symptoms. 11
A report by Chan et. al on COVID-19 clusters found in one household that 5 adults had
symptomatic infections, while a child present in the residence tested positive for COVID-19 but
was asymptomatic.31 An infected family member was commonly reported in the present study,
including a case of a physician transmitting the infection to his son. In another report, household
exposure was reported found to be 70% in 10 pediatric COVID-19 patients.16
Based on the obtained data, we suggest that in the presence of active community transmission in a
region, children presenting with a fever of unknown cause or with a fever in the presence of
common cold or pneumonia symptoms should be tested for COVID-19 and influenza A and B.
Additionally, as transmission between child to adult has been reported16, pediatric healthcare
providers should take appropriate precautions when caring for a child with suspected COVID-19.
This study has several limitations. First, it presents data from a limited sample of total pediatric
cases of COVID-19. As noted by Sun et al., line list data is available for only a small number of
Chinese provinces, while aggregated data on number of cases and mortality is provided by all. 5 As
such, cases from some provinces, including Hubei which is the center of the initial outbreak, were
not able to be included. Cases in this study may also be those in whom the disease was severe
enough to seek medical attention or identified by contact tracing, and as such, many minor cases
may have been missed and symptomatology data skewed.5 Additionally, crowdsourced data

would be less likely to capture mild cases as curated via the applied data collection modalities. 5
Missing data was common for many of the included variables. Further efforts should be made to
collect follow up data on patient outcomes.
Limited data in children with respect to travel history or exposure prevented any estimation of
incubation time. Sun et al. reported a median incubation time of 4.5 days [IQR: 3.0.5.5] 5, while
others using their data and other data sets have reported incubation rates of 5-6 days.21,32–34 In a
case series of 10 children, Cai et al. observed a longer incubation than observed in adults, with a
mean of 6.5 days (range 2-10 days) from exposure to symptoms.16 Further efforts should be made
in the coming weeks to study transmission and estimate incubation time in pediatric patients to
improve public health guidance.
As the outbreak progresses and the curated line lists continue to grow, further analyses of pediatric
epidemiologic data should be performed regularly. To that end, the authors have established the
Pediatric CO-VID19 Open Data Analysis Group, an international collaborative effort to study the
disease in children and adolescents. However, line lists curated by academic teams will struggle
to keep pace with the rapid increase in number of cases as COVID-19 trends towards pandemic.
We encourage coordinated efforts between national and international health agencies and
academia to produce line lists of patients which in turn will better enable the medical community
to develop effective interventions against COVID-19.

CONCLUSIONS
The number of reported COVID-19 cases in pediatric patients is rapidly increasing around the
world. To date, COVID-19 infections are significantly more common in males than females in
both children and adolescents inside and outside of China. When symptomatic, fever is the most
