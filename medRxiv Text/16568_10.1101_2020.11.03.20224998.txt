Abstract
We aimed to summarize reliable medical evidence by the meta-analysis of all published
clinical trials that investigated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of vaccine candidates
against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and medRxiv
databases were used to select the studies. 7094 articles were identified initially and 43 were
retrieved for more detailed evaluation. 5 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials
were selected. A total of 1604 subjects with either vaccines or placebo infections were included
in the meta-analysis within the scope of these articles. According to the results, there is an
increase in total adverse events for subjects with either low (95% CI: 1.90-4.29) or high (CI:
2.65-5.63) dose vaccination. The adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccine are mainly local ones
including pain, itching, and redness, and no significant difference was identified in the systemic
reactions. All adverse effects were transient and resolved within a few days. Moreover, the
neutralizing and IgG antibody levels post different dose vaccinations were all significantly
increased at day 14/21 (P = 0.0004 and P = 0.0003, respectively) and day 28/35 (P < 0.00001) in
vaccine groups compared to placebo controls. Besides, the levels of neutralizing and IgG
antibodies were also elevated significantly at from day 14 to 35, versus day 0 (All P < 0.001). In
conclusion, our analysis suggests that the current COVID-19 vaccine candidates are safe,
tolerated, and immunogenic, which provides important information for further development,
evaluation, and clinical application of COVID-19 vaccine.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly spread globally [1]. On 11 March 2020, the World
Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. As of November 3rd,
2020, there have been more than 46 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 1
million deaths worldwide. SARS-COV-2 infected individuals experience a wide range of
symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue [2]. COVID-19 patients with
severe pneumonia have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and changes in heart and
liver function as a secondary or related consequence of disease, which could lead to multiple
organ failures and death [3].
Vaccine is one of the best armamentaria in public health especially where no effective
treatment is available against infectious disease. Due to the global pandemic, the vaccines are
urgently needs to protect people against COVID-19. To date, more than 120 COVID-19
preclinical candidate vaccines have been developed globally, and 10 of them are in human trials
(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines).

The

safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity results of the phase 1/2 trials of multiple vaccines,
including RNA-based vaccines (e.g. BNT162b1/2 and mRNA-1273) and adenovirus-vectored
vaccines (e.g. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and non-replicating adenovirus type-5/26), have been
published or made available on preprint servers [4-6]. In addition, there are a great amount of
vaccine candidates, such as a series of DNA vaccines and inactivated vaccine BBIBP-CorV, that
have been reported to protect non-human primates against SARS-CoV-2 with varying efficacy [7,
8].
To our knowledge, no comprehensive meta-analysis has been published focusing on the
safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of current COVID-19 vaccine candidates, although
numbers of basic research and clinical trial results have been announced. Our study will be the
first one summarizing and analyzing the aforementioned clinical findings of current vaccine
candidates to acquire more accurate conclusions, providing important guidance for the
development and clinical application of COVID-19 vaccine.

The study was designed according to the standards set forth by the PRISMA (Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement [9, 10]. We searched
systematically in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and medRxiv using the key words
“COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2” and “vaccination” or “vaccine” to identify all published and
pre-publication studies from the database inception to October 20, 2020. The search is limited in
English language papers.

Study selection
We included randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Study inclusion criteria
were: healthy adults (18 years and older) without history of SARS-CoV (via on-site inquiry) or
SARS-CoV-2 infection (via serological and nucleic acid test); Before vaccination or placebo and
at days 14, 21, 28 or 35 after injections, subjects were asked to record any injection local adverse
reactions (e.g. pain, itching, redness, swelling and induration) and systemic adverse reactions
(e.g. coughing, diarrhea, fatigue, fever and headache), and subjects received routine laboratory
blood tests and antibody tests included the neutralizing antibody and the specific IgG-binding
antibody titers.
Injections of the viral vaccines [1× 10¹¹/ mL or 5× 10¹ / mL Ad5 vectors-viral particles, or
2.5, 5, and 10 μg antigen protein content per dose SARS-CoV-2 strain vaccine, or 5 μg and 25 μg

doses of rSARS-CoV-2 with or without Matrix-M1 adjuvant (50 μg dose), or 3 μg/0.5 mL and 6

μg /0.5mL inactivated SARS-CoV-2 whole virion], RNA vaccine (10 μg, 30 μg and 100 μg per

dose), or placebo, were given to participants intramuscularly in the arm.
Reviews, editorials, letters, animal studies, case reports, commentaries, reviews and
conference abstracts were excluded. Studies were excluded if there was an overlap in subjects
with another study within the same analysis. Thus, if some subjects could possibly have been
included in different phase trial, they were only included once in any given analysis. Therefore,
there was no overlap in populations included in our meta-analyses.

Data extraction and quality assessment
Our data was extracted by three investigators (P.Y., P.A., Y.L.) independently, and
disagreements were resolved by their consensus or consultation with the third author. For each
study, we collected the journal, date of publication, first author, sample size, study design,

population demographics (including ethnicity, sex ratio, and age range or mean age), the number
of vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects, outcomes, adverse reaction, and adjusted measures of
the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CI).
Risk of bias was assessed for the domains suggested by the Cochrane Handbook of
Systematic Reviews [11], specifically emphasizing sequence generation, allocation concealment,
blinding, outcomes assessment, and selective reporting for the 5 included trials. We did not
detect clear publication bias, because the number of included studies was small.

Outcomes
Main outcomes measures of our meta-analysis included safety and immunogenicity of the
vaccine. According to the adverse reaction extracted from the original studies, the safety
outcomes were evaluated as individual conditions including local adverse reactions (pain, itching,
redness, swelling, induration) and systemic adverse reactions (coughing, diarrhea, fatigue, fever,
headache, nausea and vomiting, pruritus, muscle pain, joint pain and malaise or anorexia).
Similarly, immunogenicity outcomes were evaluated by abnormal hemoglobin, alanine
aminotransferase and total bilirubin, IgG or other specific antibody responses to the receptor
binding domain, and neutralizing antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2.

Data synthesis and statistical analysis
For 5 included studies, the differences in frequency of adverse events and change of antibody
levels and laboratory parameters with vaccination versus placebo or baseline were pooled,
stratified across studies, and analyzed using random-effects or fixed effect models with inverse
variance weighting. Random-effects models were used when the I2 statistics to estimate the
proportion of variation attributable to between-study heterogeneity more than 50% or p < 0.1.
And fixed effect models were used when I2 less than 50% or P > 0.5. Separate models were
constructed for low and high dose vaccination, 14/21 and 28/35 days of follow-up. The
magnitude of heterogeneity was estimated using the I2 statistic, an estimate of the proportion of
the total observed variance that is attributed to between-study variance.
Pooled effects on adverse events and abnormal hemoglobin, alanine aminotransferase and
total bilirubin levels were presented as odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% CI. Pooled
effects on antibody levels were presented as weighted mean differences with corresponding 95%

CI. We considered P < 0.05 significant. Throughout, values were presented as mean ± SD unless
otherwise stated. Additionally, we used a funnel plot to evaluate the publication bias. Analyses
were performed using the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager (version 5.2, Cochrane
Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark).

Results
Characteristics of the Studies
Of 4223 articles from PubMed, 187 articles from the Cochrane Library, 2684 articles from
EMBASE, and 2736 from medRxiv identified initially, 43 were retrieved for more detailed
evaluation, Subsequently, 5 studies that included 1604 subjects were finally included in the
analyses (Figure 1). The baseline characteristics of the included 5 randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trials including the design and methods were summarized (Table 1). Studies
included subjects with healthy adults over 18 years old. The vaccination procedures were similar
in these studies, including the injection site, the period of follow-up, primary and secondary endpoint events, and the recorded adverse reactions. Three studies designed a single injection and
two studies designed two to three vaccinations. The included 5 studies utilized a range of vaccine
doses from 2.5 μg to 100 μg per dose with at least two to three dose gradients. The risk of bias
was low in the majority of studies, with a detailed assessment available (Figure 2).

Effect of vaccination on adverse reactions
For the meta-analysis, we separated the adverse events based on vaccine vs. placebo injection
as reported by individual studies. In general, we observed there was an increase in total adverse
events for subjects with low dose vaccine injection [OR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.90-4.29, P < 0.00001]
(Figure 3). Especially, the local reactions were significantly enhanced in subjects with low dose
vaccine groups [OR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.07-4.00, P = 0.03] (Figure 3). However, the systemic
reactions were no significantly changed between vaccine and placebo groups [OR: 1.28; 95% CI:
0.67-2.43, P = 0.46]. There were high amounts of heterogeneity about total adverse events and
local reactions and a lower amount of heterogeneity of systemic reactions in these studies (I2 =
79%, 73%, and 10%; Figure 3).
The similar data indicated total adverse events [OR: 3.86; 95% CI: 2.65-5.63, P < 0.00001]
and local reactions [OR: 4.80; 95% CI: 2.36-9.78, P < 0.00001] were significantly increased in

subjects with high dose vaccine injection compared to placebo injection (Figure 4). And the
systemic reactions also show no significant alteration in subjects with high dose vaccination [OR:
1.81; 95% CI: 0.91-3.59, P = 0.09] (Figure 4). Modest to high amounts of heterogeneity were
showed in analyses of total adverse events, local reactions and systemic reactions (I2 = 53%,
53%, and 80%; Figure 4).
In low dose vaccine subgroup analyses showed total local events were significantly higher in
vaccine groups than placebo groups [OR: 2.72; 95% CI: 1.36-5.47, P = 0.005] (Figure 5).
However, any local reactions, including pain, itching, redness, swelling and induration, were no
significantly changed between the two groups (All P > 0.05, Figure 5). There were low to
modest amounts of heterogeneity about all local reactions besides pain among these studies (I2=
86%, 0%, 12%, 0% and 48%; Figure 5). In analysis of systemic reactions, we have only
analyzed some common systemic reactions in all studies. There were significantly increased of
fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain and malaise/anorexia in subjects with low dose vaccine
injections compared to placebo injections (All P < 0.05, Figure 6). There were no significantly
changed in coughing, diarrhea, fever, pruritus, nausea and vomiting in vaccine groups with lose
dose compared to placebo groups (All P > 0.05, Figure 6). There were also low to modest
amounts of heterogeneity about all systemic reactions (I2 = 0% to 51%; Figure 6).
In high dose vaccine subgroup analyses, total local events, pain, itching and swelling were
also significantly enhanced in vaccine groups (All P < 0.05, Figure 7), but redness and
induration was no changed between the two groups [OR: 2.57; 95% CI: 0.76-0.72, P = 0.13; OR:
1.51; 95% CI: 0.16-14.64, P = 0.72] (Figure 7). Low to high amounts of heterogeneity were
showed in the analyses of systemic reactions (I2 = 0% to 67%; Figure 7). Total systemic event,
fatigue, fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, muscle pain, joint pain and malaise/anorexia (All
P < 0.05) besides coughing, diarrhea and pruritus (All P > 0.05) were also significantly higher in
vaccine groups than placebo groups (All P < 0.05, Figure 8). And there were no amounts of
heterogeneity about all systemic reactions (All I2 = 0%) besides fatigue, muscle pain and total
events (I2 = 65%, 14% and 5%;) among these studies (Figure 8).

Effect of vaccination on neutralizing and IgG antibody responses
The neutralizing antibody levels post different dose vaccinations were all increased at day
14/21 (p = 0.0004) and day 28/35 (P < 0.00001) in vaccine groups compared to placebo controls,

so the total neutralizing antibody levels were also significantly increased (P < 0.00001, Figure 9).
Low to modest amounts of heterogeneity were showed in the analyses (I2 = 0%, 56% and 40 %;
Figure 9).
And the specific antibody or IgG levels were significantly increased at day 14/21(P = 0.0003)
and day 28/35 (P < 0.00001) in vaccine groups as well, compared to placebo controls (Figure
10). No amounts of heterogeneity were obtained in the analyses (All I2 = 0%). The total specific
antibody or IgG levels were also significantly increased in vaccine groups compared to placebo
controls (P < 0.00001, Figure 10). A modest amount of heterogeneity were observed in the
analyses (I2 = 49%, Figure 10).
In the comparison between pre- and post-vaccinations, not only the levels of neutralizing
antibody but also that of specific antibody or IgG were also enhanced at day 14, 21, 28 and 35,
versus day 0 (All P < 0.001, Figure 11, 12). Low amounts of heterogeneity were related to both
analyses, at days 14/21 and days 28/35 (I2 = 0% to 37%, Figure 11, 12).

Effect of vaccination on laboratory parameters
In the laboratory parameters, the hemoglobin, alanine aminotransferase and total bilirubin in
subjects with vaccine groups were similar as placebo groups (All P > 0.05, Figure 13). No
amount of heterogeneity were identified related to three laboratory parameters in the analyzing
studies (All I2 = 0%, Figure 13).
Discussion
Immunotherapy is considered as an effective strategy for the prophylaxis and treatment of
various infectious diseases, which requires the artificial triggering of the immune system to
eliminate pathogens [12].
A vaccine that elicits the production of S protein neutralizing antibodies in the vaccinated
subjects is the eventual aim for the all efforts that are devoted in the development of COVID-19
vaccine. To achieve this aim, multiple strategies have been applied. The most straightforward
approach in vaccine production is to assemble SARS-CoV-2 S protein or its subunits with
adjuvants directly. By this strategy, COVID-19 vaccines to elicit neutralizing antibody and
immune cell (e.g. TH1 T cell) responses have been produced by multiple programs worldwide
[13-15]. Another option is to utilize nucleoside-modified RNA (modRNA) including BNT162b1

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.03.20224998; this version posted November 4, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

[4, 16] and BNT162b2 [17] that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and
the full-length S protein with 2 proline mutations for maintaining the prefusion conformation,
respectively, as vaccine candidates. Besides, other types of vaccines including DNA-based
vaccine candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2 S protein [18] and live attenuated vaccines with NS1deleted RBD domain [19] has also been generated and examined.
Here, we have discussed data from 5 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies
including 1246 cases received COVID-19 vaccine candidates and 358 subjects received placebo
controls. So far, although it is still a small number for meta-analysis, it is the first meta-analysis
to examine the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of current COVID-19 vaccine candidates.
In the present study, the following conclusions were drawn.
1) Generally, to all analyzed vaccine candidates in our study, the majority of adverse events
reported were mild or moderate in severity and no serious adverse reactions were reported.
Additionally, all adverse effects were transient and resolved within a few days. However, it is
important to emphasize that, no matter low or high dose of vaccination, vaccine recipients
showed a significant increase in total adverse event versus controls. Furthermore, this elevation
in total adverse event is mainly contributed by the significant increase of local adverse reactions.
The total systemic adverse reactions displayed no significant difference among individuals
vaccinated with or without COVID-19 vaccine, although some subdivision parameters may
exhibit significant alterations. The total events of systemic reactions in low and high dose
vaccination in Figure 6 and 8 were not consistent to the results in Figure 3 and 4. One main
reason was that the total events in Figure 6 and 8 was only pooled some items at one follow-up
timepoint and one dose injection not all the systemic reactions observed in studies, so they were
not same with the results of polled all items about systemic reactions in Figure 3 and 4.
Therefore, based on current observations, the COVID-19 vaccine candidates are overall safe and
tolerated for clinical application.
2) All vaccine candidates exhibit excellent immunogenicity. 2-5 weeks post vaccination, both
neutralizing and IgG antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 S protein increased significantly
in convalescent plasma samples. The specific immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 were
constantly observed in individuals who received COVID-19 vaccine candidates, compared with
no matter placebo-controls or the baseline before vaccination.

3) Multiple vaccinations, but not injection dose, are a key factor that determines the
immunogenicity of current COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Multiple vaccinations of COVID-19
vaccine candidates always show greater immunogenicity than single vaccinations. In two
included studies that give 2-3 injections, multiple vaccinations induced an increase around 10100 times greater than single ones. When compared with convalescent serum, repeated
vaccinations may result in GMT levels multiple folds greater than those in symptomatic
outpatients with COVID-19 and approach comparable levels to those in hospitalized patients
with COVID-19. In contrast, our analyses suggest that both low and high dose of vaccination can
induce promising neutralizing and IgG antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, meta-analysis results indicate great achievements in the development of safe,
tolerated, immunogenic vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. However, this review has several
limitations.
1) Some of the included studies exposed some methodological flaws, thereby introducing
high risk of biases into these trials, that is, some trials failed to include the subjects at greatest
risk for serious COVID-19, and outcome assessors after long-term period of follow-up.
Moreover, some trials included insufficient number of samples without the wide ethnic and age
varieties, which meant there was a potential risk of overestimating positive outcomes. Thus,
further studies are required to increase the size of participant numbers, extend the follow-up time
from 4-5 weeks to at least 3-4 months, and consider more population factors including adding
older adults, people with coexisting conditions, and individuals with ethnically and
geographically diversity.
2) We only include randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Data from these
articles can generate the most unambiguous results; however, there are multiple single-blind or
placebo-free studies that are excluded unfortunately. For example, Sahin et al. reported that
BNT162b1 elicited robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and strong antibody responses in a
placebo-controlled, observer-blinded phase I/II vaccine trial [16]. Similarly, Folegatti et al. also
demonstrated ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 with SARS-CoV-2 S protein as a safe, tolerated, and
immunogenic vaccine in a single-blind, randomized controlled trial [14]. The studies on nonhuman mammalian species have also been excluded although [13, 15, 20]. These studies
obtained promising results in animals in the perspective of immunogenicity and lung protection
through using replication-incompetent recombinant serotype 5 adenovirus carrying a codon-

optimized gene encoding S protein [20], insect cell-produced pre-fusion trimer-stabilized SARSCoV-2 S protein [15], and CHO-expressed SARS-CoV-2 S1-Fc fusion protein [13]. We are
aware of 5 includes was restricted to published studies and may therefore be affected by
publication bias. Thus, It is urgently needed to carry out more randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled studies, include a large number of studies in a broad geographical scope, in
order to obtain a more comprehensive view of the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of
current COVID-19 vaccine candidates as a result.
3) Another one is the lack of some key data since detailed patient information was not given
in all studies, especially regarding to SARS-CoV-2 anti-Spike (S) protein IgG and neutralizing
antibody responses, and biochemical indicators of immune responses that are obtained by blood
routine, blood biochemical, urine routine, and other test methods. To examine the complete
physiological and biochemical indexes of all participants should be an important part in
following trials.
4) Although there was no time restriction in literature search, we only collected English
language papers. Due to the possibility that the language restriction may narrow the breadth of
our search, more languages (e.g. Chinese, Spanish, Japanese, French, and Russian) and database
(e.g. MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process, and Scopus) should be applied in literature search
in the following studies.
In summary, our study is the first meta-analysis summarizing the current progress in the
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. The results from our analysis implicate excellent safety,
tolerability, and immunogenicity of all included COVID-19 vaccine candidates, providing great
confidence for the following development and clinical application of COVID-19 vaccines.
Therefore, our study suggests that, although there are limitations in current studies such as the
short follow-up time and small sizes of subjects, with the conduction of large-scale clinical
efficacy trials, the successful development of safe, effective, durable, and deployable to large
populations COVID-19 vaccines to end the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will be a near
possibility.
