Abstract: In this paper a modified mathematical model based on the SIR model used which can
predict the spreading of the corona virus disease (COVID-19) and its effects on people in the
days ahead. This model considers all the death, infected and recovered characteristics of this
disease. To determine the extent of the risk posed by this novel coronavirus; the transmission rate
( ଴  is utilized for a time period from the beginning of spreading virus. Particularly it includes a
novel policy to capture the Ro response in the virus spreading over time. The model estimates
the vulnerability of the pandemic according to John H. Cochrane’s method with a prediction of
new cases by estimating a time-varying ଴ to capture changes in the behavior of SIR model
implies to new policy taken at different times and different locations of the world. This modified
SIR model with the different values of ଴ can be applied to different country scenario using the
real time data report provided by the authorities during this pandemic. The effective evaluation
of ଴ can forecast the necessity of lockdown as well as reopening the economy.

1. Introduction:
Mathematical modeling of the any disease spreading is a very important tool to predict the
possible number of infected people as well as the spreading scenario.[1], [2], [3], [4]. As every
disease have its own specific biological characteristics so to tackle real life situations, the
established models need to be modified with respect to the specific cases.[5], [6].In December
2019, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in China and then rapidly spread all over
the world [7]. The World Health Organization (WHO) renamed the epidemic disease caused by
2019-nCoV as strain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on 11
February 2020 [8], [9].This is a new virus and the world is facing a new situation [10] as there is
no vaccine has made to combat this virus. In this situation, on 30 January 2020, World Health
Organization (WHO) declared it to be a Public Health Emergency of Global Concern [11]. As of
20 May 2020, the disease was confirmed in more than 4998097 cases reported globally and there
are 325304 death cases reported. World health Organisation (WHO) declared it a pandemic
situation caused by coronavirus spreading [12].
In this paper, the literature review consists of some relevant mathematical models which tried to
describe the dynamics of the evolution of COVID-19. Some of the phenomenological models
tried to generate and assess short-term forecasts using the cumulative number based on reported
cases. The SIR model is a traditional one to predict the vulnerability of a pandemic and also can
be used to predict the future scenario of coronavirus cases. However, this model is modified [13],
[14] including other variables to calibrate the possible infection rate with time being.
Coronavirus transmission (how quickly the disease spreads) is indicated by its reproduction
number ( ଴ , pronounced as R-nought or r-zero), which indicates the actual number of people to
whom the virus can be transmitted by a single infected case. WHO predicted (on Jan. 23) ଴ ,
would be between 1.4 and 2.5. Other research measured Ro with various values somewhere
between 3.6 and 4.0, and 2.24. The long-used value of Ro is 1.3 for flu and 2.0 for SARS
[15][2]. In this research, firstly SIR model is simulated taking a constant value of ଴  0.5 to
observe the response. Since reducing the face to face contact among people and staying home in
lockdown can improve in reducing the further infection rate, ଴ is taken as a time varying
constant rather than a fixed one to observe the overall scenario of coronavirus spreading.
The organization of the paper is as follows: A brief study of some mathematical models
correlated to coronavirus spreading is extracted in section 2, literature review part, section 3
contains the Modeling of coronavirus spreading .Section 4 is the result and discussion part and
section 5 concludes the paper.

2. Literature Review:
The SIR epidemic model which is used in this work is one of the simplest compartmental models
firstly used by Kermack and McKendrick (1927).Compartmental model denotes mathematical
modeling of infectious diseases where the population is separated in various compartments for
example, S, I, or R, (Susceptible, Infectious, or Recovered). Many works have been undergone
during the coronavirus pandemics utilizing the compartmental models [16], [17] and Imperial

College COVID-19 Response Team (2020) provides a useful overview of this classic model to
show that these models can be applied to understand the current health hazards. Much interest
has been generated among economists to identify the impact of current pandemic on economic
sectors by exploring compartmental models along with standard economic models using
econometric techniques. [18], [19].
It was argued by the economists that many of the parameters controlling the move among
compartments are not structural however it depends on individual decisions and policies. For
example, according to Eichenbaum et al. [20] and Farboodi, Jarosch and Shimer [21], the
number of new infections is a function of the endogenous labor supply and consumption choices
of individuals which is determined by the rate of contact and by the standard decision theory
models where the rate of contact is amenable. Similarly, the death rates and recovery rates are
not just clinical parameters. Moreover, it can be used as functions of policy decisions for
example by expanding emergency hospital capacity may increase the recovery rate and decrease
death rates. Also, in this case the fatality ratio is a complex function because it depends on many
clinical factors. Therefore, the selection-into-disease mechanisms are themselves partly the
product of endogenous choices [22].
Moreover, concerning with the identification problems of compartmental models
economists Atkeson [23] and Korolev [24] have found that these models lack many set of
parameters that is able to fit the observed data efficiently before the long-run degradable
consequences. Some of the researchers Linton [25] and Kucinskas [26] used time-series models
utilizing the econometric tradition other than using compartmental models.

However, many of the economists are pushing the study of compartmental models in a multitude
of dimensions. Acemoglu et al. [27] and Alvarez et al. [28] identified that the optimal lockdown
policy for a planner who wants to control the fatalities of a pandemic while minimizing the
output cost of the lockdown. Berger et al. [29] examine the role of testing and case-dependent
quarantines. Bethune and Korinek [30] estimate the infection externalities associated with
COVID-19. Bodenstein et al. [31] examine a compartmental model with a multi-sector dynamic
general equilibrium model. Other researchers like Garriga, Manuelli and Sanghi [32],Hornstein
[33], and Karin et al. [34] study a variety of containment policies. Toda [35], estimated a SIRD
model to explores the optimal mitigation policy that controls the timing and intensity of social
distancing. Flavio Toxvaerd[36] also developed a simple economic model emphasizing on
endogenous social distancing.
Furthermore, many of the economists commented that coronavirus infection transmission cannot
be a biologically induced constant rather it can be varied with human behavior and the change in
human behavior can be predicted in response to changing social policies. Another form of multirisk SIR Model with assumed a targeted lockdown period provided by the economists Daron
Acemoglu et al [37] which is an epidemiology models with economic incentives. The authors of
this paper argued about the herd immunity that might be much lower if the super spreaders like
people in hospitals, emergency service providers, bus drivers, etc are set to immune first.

Therefore, in this paper we use John H. Cochrane’s methodology by allowing the infection rates
changeable over time by imposing social distancing among people. Moreover, we tried to focus
on the reproduction rate ଴ which is not a constant but varies with time based on the
demographic and policy heterogeneity.

3. Mathematical SIR Model:
According to the conventional SIR model, for the N number of constant populations, each of
whom may be in one of five states with respect to time implies that:

௧

௧

௧

௧

௧



Where the parameters denote:
S = Susceptible,
I = Infected,
R = Resolving,
D = Number of dead from pandemic,
C = Number of recovered people,
N = Total number of population.
While a susceptible person can be affected by the disease when comes in contact with an
infectious person.

A. Modified-SIR model:
The SIR model is used to predict the vulnerability of any type pandemic which may not be
applicable to coronavirus cases since this model assumes the reproduction rate as a constant. The
virus seems to be diminished when all affected people will be recovered which is practically not
possible. The affected people by corona virus are highly contagious to other people who come in
contact to them. Thus, the spreading of coronavirus infection is increasing day by day. Therefore,
a mathematical model of the spreading of it can help predicting its vulnerability and while to take
some efficient measures to lowering the contact rate.
The modified behavioral SIR model is presented by [38]:

Where, β= Number of contacts per day. Again, lowering the rate of further reproduction does not
stop the pandemic immediately. The modified version of SIR model shows exponential decays of
reproduction rate other than fixed timeframe to be diminished. A person who can be affected
meets β number of people in a day. Therefore, 1/N of the total population is becoming infected
by coronavirus each day, so that ௧ ௧ / is the number of infected people each day.The
parameters varies over time to capture behavioral or policy changes such as social distancing.
Therefore, the modified SIR model can be parameterized in terms of the ଴ reproduction rate.
଴

 /γ

The number of infection spreading from infected person = number of possible contacts ( per day)
× the number of days the affected people remain infectious.
In the SIR model, β is a constant and hence we use a constant ଴ reproduction rate. Eventually
the exponential growth of the disease then the growth can be confined by the reducing the
number of susceptible people in the total number of population. Moreover, each of the infected
people is considered to be recovered people after certain time. But in actual scenario it is not
happening because of the death from coronavirus infection. In the actual SIR model lowered β
was used. However, by lowering the reproduction rate ଴ , the further spread of coronavirus can
be suppressed.

B. Cochrane’s Behavioral SIR Model [39]:
After the lockdown most of the people reduced their contacts which decrease the proportionally
of the increased number of infectious people. Since β is the rate of susceptible person so that a
logarithmic function can be used as it can't be negative.

The logarithmic function was used to get the idea in the early declines while super spreading

C. Parameter estimation according to Cochrane’s method:
Let us assume the total number of populations is 1 million. In this model we used the same
parameter value as used by the researcher Chad and Jesús [38]. Hereby,

γ =0.2 which is used for 5 days of remain infectiousness in an average,
θ=0.1 implies that 10 days in an average to get infected by coronavirus for which it may cause

is the most acute response, which can be elaborated by utilizing different R ଴ values.

The standard SIR model simulation with those above-mentioned parameters values is as follow:

From the graph, the first day starts with only one infected person then the infection rate in the
graph increases exponentially with the increasing number of new infected people while it shows
the pick value at almost half the population. However, after 25 days of the infection spreading
the herd immunity begun while the maximum number of infected people was found. The number
of sick people who are resolving peaks after few days. The pandemic period is over 2 months
and it is expected to go away after that. While everyone of the total 1 million populations get
infected and that results into 0.8% or 8000 death.
Furthermore, the behavioral modified SIR model simulation, the system reacts by reducing the
transmission rate meaning that the varied values of R ଴ function.

Figure 3: Behavioral SIR model with varied R ଴ [39]

The graph shows that about 4000 people will be infected but not the total 1 million populations.
The pandemic gets going exponentially (blue line), while the infection rate reach 1000 per
million there is a noticeable acute reduction in the further reproduction rate indicated in black
colored dashed line.
Moreover, the transmission rate R ଴ is asymptotes in this model, with a decline in the number of
infection rate as well as less number of death cases per day. In this process, it may take a long
period to achieve herd immunity if all the initiatives taken in order to lessening contacts are
stopped. Assuming the reproduction rate is asymptotes to R ଴  1, the following graph shows:

Figure 4: Behavioral SIR model with Varied R ଴

This simulation graph shows an aggressive response, α is increased by a factor of 5 showed in
the dashed line (red) in the first graph. In this graph from the vertical scale it is clear that, the less
people are vulnerable to the infections implies that the overall rate of infection is comparatively
low. Being stricter about the social gathering and possible contacts the situation doesn’t change
since the reproduction or transmission rate is still asymptotes, such that R ଴ declines to one.
However, in such scenario, we get low infection rate on daily basis. After reducing the number
of infected people over time, letting R ଴ varies over time and α is increasing by a factor of 2 for
100 days the following graph shows:

Therefore, the simulation of modified SIR model (when people care about the death rate rather
than the reproduction of infection rate) gives the following graph:

Since after a few weeks’ deaths occur by the infections is found steady over time. Then the
situation is considered under control. After letting people go back to the normal life with no
restriction, the situation may get back with more severe affects. Then the coronavirus pandemic
might be uncontrolled with high deaths in the first wave while by taken possible measures and
consciousness of people to avoid contact can reduce the infection rate and death rate.
Furthermore, after lowering the death rate people ease up and a second wave of infection rate
appears so forth. Therefore, the reproduction rate R ଴ cannot be constant as it varies with the
behavioral change of people and policy taken to control the pandemic.

5. Conclusion:
The COVID-19 is a current global issue which spread in almost every country of the world and
caused restriction to the free movement of people resulting a massive economical loss
worldwide. Transmission rate (R ଴ ) is the number of newly infected individuals derived from a
single case is the factor that can calibrated the reproduction rate of coronavirus utilizing the SIR
model. In the traditional SIR model, taking Ro as a constant cannot predict the actual scenario of
coronavirus spreading. The value of R ଴ can be different for different places and time period.
Moreover, Ro can be changed with the behavioral changes of people because of the adopted
policies by respective authorities. Therefore, in this research R ଴ is not considered a constant
rather it is used as a time varying function. By taken the possible measures to reduce the social
contact R ଴ can be minimized with the time causing less death and forecasting to reopen the
economy.
