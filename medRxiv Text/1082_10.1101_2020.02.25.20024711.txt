Abstract
Background. The clinical presentation of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov)
infected

pneumonia

(NCIP)

resembles

that

of

other

etiologies

of

community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We aimed to identify clinical laboratory
features to distinguish NCIP from CAP.
Methods. We compared the ability of the hematological and biochemical
features of 84 patients with NCIP at hospital admission and 316 patients with
CAP. Parameters independently predictive of NCIP were calculated by
multivariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was
measured to evaluate the discriminative ability.
Results. Most hematological and biochemical indexes of patients with NCIP
were significantly different from patients with CAP. Nine laboratory parameters
were identified to be highly predictive of a diagnosis of NCIP by multivariate
analysis. The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell
distribution width (RDW) with an AUC of 0.88 and Hemoglobin (HGB) with an
AUC of 0.82. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO),
hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC)
had fair discriminatory ability. Combinations of any two parameters performed
better than did the RDW alone.
Conclusions. Routine laboratory examinations may be helpful for the
diagnosis of NCIP. Application of laboratory tests may help to optimize the use
of isolation rooms for patients when they present with unexplained febrile
respiratory illnesses.

Introduction
Chinese people are facing unprecedented panic induced by the outbreak
of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) infected pneumonia (NCIP) in Wuhan,
China since December 2019 [1]. Currently, during Spring Festival travel rush,
millions of people leave Wuhan city, and the 2019-nCov would spread quickly
especially along with people coming out from Wuhan. By 10 Feb 2020, a total
of 3,7626 people have been confirmed NCIP in China [2].
The NCIP is considered a relative of the deadly Middle East respiratory
syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
coronaviruses. They are characterized by pneumonia symptoms, such as fever,
radiographic evidence of pneumonia, respiratory symptoms and possibly
transmitted from animal to human [3-5]. The public health authorities proposed
NCIP definitions that combined clinical features (e.g., fever, cough, and
anhelation) with epidemiological factors (e.g., travel to a seafood and wet
animal wholesale market in Wuhan or direct contact with another patient with
NCIP)

to

improve

diagnostic

accuracy

[6,

7].

Unfortunately,

these

epidemiological features are not specific and have poor positive predictive
value during the outbreak.
The NCIP appears to cause symptoms similar to other etiologies of
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) based on clinical data from 41 NCIP
patients [3], and can spread from humans to humans [3, 8]. Distinguishing
NCIP from other etiologies of CAP is one of the major challenges of the NCIP
outbreak. Despite recommendations that examining hematological and
biochemical parameters as part of the diagnostic workup for NCIP [3, 9], it is
urgent to evaluate the ability of these features to accurately discriminate cases
of NCIP from cases of CAP. Thus, we conducted the current study aiming to
evaluate the ability of routine laboratory tests for distinguishing NCIP from

other etiologies of CAP and help health workers to effectively, quickly and
calmly deal with NCIP.

Materials and Methods
Patients and Data collection
To determine the ability of routine laboratory tests, measured at hospital
admission, to differentiate NCIP from CAP due to other causes, we compared
the hematological and biochemical data of NCIP patients and CAP patients.
The 84 NCIP patients presented to our hospital from Dec 26, 2019, to Jan 30,
2020. The patients were laboratory confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by
real-time RT-PCR. The CAP group consisted of 316 patients who visited our
hospital from January 2018 to December 2018. These patients had ≥2
symptoms and signs of CAP and had evidence of pneumonia revealed by the
emergency department physician or internal medicine consultant. Healthy
controls included 120 healthy people who made the physical check-up in our
hospital from Dec 13, 2019, to Dec 17, 2019. The clinical data collection from
patients was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhongnan Hospital of
Wuhan University. Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics
Commission for emerging infectious diseases.
Hematological and serum biochemical examination
Routine hematological and serum biochemical examination was ordered
at the discretion of the physicians and were measured using standard methods
in our hospital. Fasting whole blood from every patient was collected in an
EDTA anticoagulant-treated tube and analyzed within 30 minutes of collection.
Routine peripheral blood cells, including hemoglobin, lymphocytes, and
monocytes, were analyzed. Routine serum biochemical parameters, including

alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), AST/ALT
ratio, total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), unconjugated bilirubin (UBIL),
total protein (TP), ALB, globulin (GLB), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT),
alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bile acid (TBA) were measured.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS version 22.0
software. Statistical analysis for the results was performed using the
Mann-Whitney U test for only two groups or using one-way analysis of
variance when there were more than two groups. The receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC
curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability [10]. Higher
AUC were considered to show better discriminatory ability as follows: excellent,
AUC of ≥0.90; good, 0.80 ≤ AUC<0.90; fair, 0.70 ≤ AUC< 0.80. A p-value <0.05
was considered statistically significant.

Results
The mean values of laboratory indexes at the time of hospital admission in
NCIP patients and CAP patients were demonstrated in table 1 and figure 1.
Both NCIP patients and CAP patients had lower mean lymphocyte counts and
platelet counts than healthy control. NCIP patients had significantly lower
mean values for WBC, neutrophil, eosinophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, red cell
distribution width (RDW), platelet counts, and ALP than did patients with CAP.
NCIP patients had significantly higher mean values for hemoglobin, hematocrit,
ALB, ALT, and AST than did CAP patients. There were no significant
differences in mean values of erythrocyte mean levels of globulin (GLB),

γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and total bile acid (TBA) between NCIP
patients and CAP patients.
The proportion of patients with abnormal laboratory features are
presented in table 2. Both NCIP patients (81.0%) and CAP patients (59.5%)
had lymphopenia. A significantly higher proportion of NCIP patients presented
reduced WBC and eosinophil, normal basophile, and increased AST, whereas
a significantly higher proportion of CAP patients had decrease of RBC,
hemoglobin, hematocrit, ALB and increase of neutrophil, monocyte and RDW.
Multivariate analysis demonstrated the laboratory indexes independently
discriminating NCIP from CAP. The OR of the factors to predict NCIP versus
CAP were shown in table 3. The ROC curves and AUC (figures 2)
demonstrated that RDW (AUC, 0.88) and HGB (AUC, 0.82) had good
discriminatory ability. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO),
hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC)
had fair discriminatory ability. Furthermore, the cutoff value for RDW could be
13.35 that provided a reasonable sensitivity (79.8%) or specificity (85.1%).
When ROC curves were calculated for combinations of these three
parameters, improvement in AUC was presented, with the maximum AUC
being 0.90.

Discussion
This study indicates that several hematological and biochemical
abnormalities occur more frequently in CAP patients than in NCIP patients.
The statistically significant difference in mean values was noted for most
laboratory features tested except the GLB, GGT and TBA. However, to be

useful in diagnosis, the overlap in the distribution of the results for patients with
NCIP and those with CAP must be small.
2019-nCov spread quickly in China since the first official announcement in
December 2019 by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission [11, 12]. Possibly,
the Spring Festival travel rush that millions of people were on the way home
and 2019-nCov would spread fast especially along with people coming out
from Wuhan. Because the confirmation diagnosis of NCIP now mainly relies on
PCR assays for the detection of 2019-nCov [13], initial medical examination of
potential NCIP depends primarily on clinical, radiographic, and epidemiological
features [9]. Physicians and public health workers keep struggling with the
difficult task of evaluating patients for NCIP presenting with unknown febrile
respiratory illnesses. As a result, public health authorities went on revising
NCIP definitions to improve the accuracy of diagnosis.
Our findings demonstrated that nine laboratory features independently
predictive of discernibility between NCIP and CAP. The identification of the
RDW, HGB and RBC count as the best discriminatory ability, with an AUC of
0.89, 0.81 and 0.78, respectively. The discriminatory ability likely results from
elevated RBC and HCB while low RDW seen in NCIP. Our study also
highlighted laboratory parameters that are common in both NCIP and CAP and
therefore not useful in differentiating the 2 diseases. Lymphocytopenia is
characteristic and of similar magnitude for both NCIP and CAP. However,
lymphocytopenia in NCIP was also accompanied by depletion of EO and
normal BASO, whereas it was accompanied by reduced RBC, elevated
neutrophil count and monocyte count in CAP.
Because the CAP cohort did not have laboratory indexes over time, trends
in laboratory values were unable to perform after hospital admission.
Therefore, more significant differences in the laboratory indexes might occur

later in the illness, between patients with NCIP and patients with CAP. Our
findings indicate that simple laboratory tests may help to distinguish NCIP from
CAP. Application of these tests together with epidemiological data may be
helpful to avoid misdiagnosis of NCIP as CAP, shorten the time of isolation of
patients with respiratory symptoms.
