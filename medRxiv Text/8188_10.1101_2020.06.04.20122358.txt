ABSTRACT
Antibodies testing in the coronavirus era is frequently promoted, but the underlying statistics behind their validation has
come under more scrutiny in recent weeks. We provide calculations, interpretations, and plots of positive and negative
predictive values under a variety of scenarios. Prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity are estimated within ranges of values
from researchers and antibodies manufacturers. Illustrative examples are highlighted, and interactive plots are provided in the
Supplementary Material. Implications are discussed for society overall and across diverse locations with different levels of
disease burden. Specifically, the proportion of positive serology tests that are false can differ drastically from up to 3% to 88%
for people from different places with different proportions of infected people in the populations while the false negative rate is
typically under 10%.

1 Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic1 is wreaking havoc on physical2, 3 , mental4 , economic5–7 , and general societal health8, 9 . Potential
treatments for Covid19 currently have limited evidence of efficacy1 . Thus, it is critical to develop agents to prevent the spread
of coronavirus, such as vaccines. Although research and development on vaccine candidates is ongoing10, 11 , widespread
availability of a safe and effective vaccine is not expected for months or even years12–14 . Simultaneously, there is increasing
evidence of asymptomatic infection and spread15 . With scarce testing supplies16 , many people, blind to their prior infection
status or lack thereof, are self-isolating; the current situation has even consequently been derided as Schroedinger’s virus17 .
Without a vaccine, excitement about antibodies testing is growing.18 Theoretical benefits of identifying individuals with
antibodies abound. Daily activities such as shopping, traveling, and dining could begin to resume, alleviating currently acute
social and economic effects of the pandemic. Hoping to implement these potential benefits, some politicians have considered
issuing immunity passports for people who are cleared by an antibodies test19 . Yet, serology testing is not a panacea, and is
associated with concerns about its use20–23 . Proposals for implementing serology testing programs and understanding their
benefits and limitations are available24, 25
Given the increase in testing, proper interpretation of the results is critical with implications for medicine, public policy,
and personal action. The goal of this paper is to estimate, quantify and visualize uncertainty in the predictive values and false
positive rates of serology testing candidates available at the time of writing. Graphical displays of predictive values feature a
range of scenarios. Section 2 reviews key metrics for serology tests. Section 3 summarizes and visualizes metrics in general
and for serology tests operating under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Section 4 applies the concepts to specific
locations in the United States (US). Section 5 discusses limitations and implications. Finally, Section 6 details our statistical
and graphical methods.

2 Background
This section outlines key statistical definitions related to serology testing. Readers familiar with testing characteristics may
skip to Section 3. Definitions are included in the Supplementary Material.Additional details on these concepts and examples
relevant to serology may be found elsewhere25–28 .
Two properties of serology tests quantify how well the tests perform in on samples in a lab with known antibody status,
Sensitivity is the probability that a serology test correctly classifies a sample with antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. According to
the FDA, sensitivity of a test refers to its “ability to identify those with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 ” and “can be estimated by
determining whether or not it is able to detect antibodies in blood samples from patients who have been confirmed to have
COVID-19 with a nucleic acid amplification test.” Specificity, is the probability that a test correctly classifies uninfected
samples as lacking antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, the specificity of a test refers to its “ability to identify those without
antibodies to SARS-CoV-2” and is “estimated by testing large numbers of samples collected and frozen before SARS-CoV-2 is

known to have circulated”. Sensitivity and specificity are pretest quantities, or validation metrics primarily meaningful before
a serology test is taken. Sensitivity and specificity are defined by equations (3) and (4) in the Supplementary material. In this
article, we will use these definitions unless specified otherwise.
Rather, people who confront serology tests are likely interested in post-test probabilities, including positive predictive value
(PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). PPV is the probability that a person with a positive serology test indeed has a prior
infection with and antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. NPV is the probability that a person who tests negative lacks antibodies for and
has not yet been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Definitions and calculations for NPV and PPV are in the Supplementary Material.
PPV and NPV are more relevant to patients and clinicians in interpreting serology test results than sensitivity and specificity.
The complements of the predictive values are probabilities that test results of each type are false. The False Positive Rate
(FPR), the complement of PPV, is the proportion of people who test positive that are actually lacking a prior coronavirus
infection. Similarly, the false negative rate (FNR), the complement of NPV, is the proportion of people who test negative that
actually had a prior infection with coronavirus. The FPR (FNR) can be interpreted as the proportion of positive (negative)
serology tests are false positives (negatives). Equations for FPR and FNR are provided in the supplementary material.

3 Results
This section reports values for the statistics described in section 2 to help contextualize serology test results. Prevalence
estimates are reported in Section 3.1. Graphical displays of NPV and PPV for the range of values under study are found in
Section 3.2. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and FPR for tests under study are reported in 3.3.
3.1 Prevalence Estimates
Due to the lack of available diagnostic tests in the US, official counts of Covid-19 cases are likely undercounted29, 30 .
Additionally, people with asymptomatic infections are unlikely to seek medical care or diagnostic testing and are likely excluded
from official counts. Consequently, reliable prevalence estimates are limited. Prevalence, which affects predictive value
estimates, can be considered unknown, and varies over time.
Emerging research is beginning to estimate population prevalence. Over the period from March 31 to April 7, by one
estimate31 , the prevalence by state ranged from about 0.4% in Alaska, Hawaii, Kentucky, and West Virgina to 8.5% in New
York with a median prevalence of 0.9%. Another estimate30 from April 11 found infection proportions within states spanning
from 0.1% in rural states to 7.0% in New York, and an overall US prevalence of 1.2%. A third group proposes a method29 with
estimates that could indicate a prevalence of up to 10% of the population as of April 4, 2020. A collection of case studies is
highlighted in Section 4. In brief, the prevalence of Covid-19 in specific cities, states, and counties estimates during the early
stage of the pandemic in the spring of 2020 ranged from less than 1% to about 30% in especially hard hit areas, such as Boston
and New York City. According to more recent estimates as of September 2020 by the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention32 , most states had seroprevalence estimates ranging from 1% to 10%. As of the writing of this paper, only four
states have estimates below 1% and five have estimates exceeding 10%.
3.2 General Interpretation in the Context of Antibodies Testing
In this section we investigate ranges of plausible values of sensitivity, specificity for antibodies tests available and and prevalence
for relevant areas and compare the predictive values. Predictive values are of interest based on minima of 80% sensitivity and
90% specificity to reflect reported values for FDA-authorized serology tests and described in Section 3.3. In general, the false
negative rate is low and false positive rate is highly variable for available serology tests.
Figure 1 is a plot of NPV for these specificity, and sensitivity values and prevalence ranging from 1% to 30%, the range
currently reported elsewhere as discussed in Sections 3.1 and 4. Under these scenarios, the minimum NPV was 91.3%,
indicating that the false negative rate was less than 10% in all scenarios. Thus, NPV should be high, and FNR should be low for
all serology tests within similar ranges for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence. In other words, negative serology tests have a
high likelihood of accurately reflecting a lack of antibodies in the general population of non-infected individuals.
By contrast, figure 2 shows a corresponding plot spanning a wide range of plausible PPV values. PPV increases with
prevalence and is low with lower rates of antibodies in the population. At fixed prevalence values, specificity also quickly
increases PPV with prevalence. Higher sensitivity improves PPV, although the growth of PPV with increases in sensitivity is
less pronounced than with increases in specificity at a given prevalence. For example, an area with 10% prevalence would have
47.1% PPV for a test with 80% sensitivity and 90% specificity, 66.7% PPV for a test with 90% sensitivity and 95% specificity,
and 91.3% PPV for a test with 95% sensitivity and 99% specificity. Equivalently, the false positive rates would be 52.9%,
33.3%, and 8.7%. In areas with a 30% infection rate, the same tests would yield respective PPVs of 77.4%, 88.5% and 97.6%,
and false positives of 22.6%, 11.5%, and 2.4%. Yet, if the prevalence is 1%, then PPV could reach 49.0% for 95% sensitivity
and 99% specificity or fall as low as 7.5%, indicating that only 7.5% of people with positive serology tests in fact possess

antibodies. Put another way, for tests with 80% sensitivity and 90% specificity in locations with 1% prevalence, about 93% of
people with positive serology tests would be expected to lack antibodies for SARS-CoV-2!

Figure 1. Plot of NPV by prevalence (0 to 0.3), specificity (0.9 to 1), and sensitivity (0.8 to 1). The bar on the right with
sensitivity is denoted by color, with lighter colors denoting lower sensitivity and darker colors denoting higher sensitivity. All
parameters are reported as decimals ranging from 0 to 1. NPV values exceeded 0.9 for all input parameters.
3.3 Analysis of Individual Antibodies Tests
As of May 22, 2020, the FDA had allowed 13 serology tests to operate under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)33 . By
November 24, 2020, the total number of tests with EUA had increased34 to 89, and EUA had been revoked for two prior tests.
However, some of the updated results are repetitive, with many companies reporting test characteristics for IgG, IgM, and
Combined(IgG/IgM). In these cases, to balance space and conciseness with completeness, we reported the combined tests only.
Characteristics of these 61 distinct tests appear in Table 1. Sensitivity estimates range from about 88% to 100%, with 95%
confidence limits ranging from about 74% to 100%. Specificity estimates range from about 95% to 100%, with confidence
bounds ranging from 88% to 100%.
Figures 3 and 4 highlight the relationship between PPV and prevalence for each of the 11 serology tests granted an EUA by
the US FDA in the spring of 2020 that retained approval in November 2020. Similar figures for the remaining 50 tests are
provided in the Supplementary material. The figures illustrate the known relationship that PPV should be lower in populations
with lower prevalence28 , and that PPV increases more rapidly with increasing specificity than with increasing sensitivity.
At low prevalence, such as 1%, many tests exhibit low PPV and high rates of false positives (Table 1). The upper limits of
false positive rates for 45 (74%) tests exceed 60% and 49 (80%) tests exceed 50% given 1% prevalence. Thus, in regions with
1% prevalence, scenarios having 50% or more percent of positive serology tests corresponding to people lacking SARS-Cov-2
antibodies would be within the realm of reasonable expectations. In addition, some tests with estimated specificity below 97%
have not only poor estimated false positive rates, but report high precision. Tests by Cellex, Megna, Biohit, JiangSu, and TBG
are estimated to have about 80% false positives at 1% prevalence, with even the lower bounds on their FPR exceeding 66%.
In such low prevalence populations, on average, anywhere between 6 and 9 out of 10 positive tests by these companies are
expected to be false.
Results for all tests improve with prevalence, but overall false positive rates remain concerning. Although only nine point
estimates for false positive rates exceed 20% assuming 10% prevalence, which is higher than most currently estimated infection
rates30–32 , the upper bound for false positive rates exceed 20% for 39 out of 61 tests. Moreover, only 15 (25%) tests from six
companies – Abbott (3 of 4 minus Alinity IgG, Ortho-clinical (IgG and PanIg), Siemens (all 6 varieties), BeckmanCoulter

Table 1.

Statistics for FDA authorized serology tests with EUA
All numbers are percentages. Interval estimates for sensitivity and specificity are 95% confidence intervals reported by the FDA33 . Interval estimates for the
false positive rates are minimum and maximum values of all possible false positive rates calculated at the specified prevalence level for the corresponding test
based on all possible estimates of sensitivity and specificity within the 95% confidence intervals.
∗ n refers to the number of samples used to calculate the pretest probabilities. The number on the left refers to the number of samples with infected with
SARS-COV-2 that were tested to estimate sensitivity. The number on the right refers to the number of control samples used to estimate specificity.
Test types are shortened as followed. “G” denotes IgG, “M” denotes IgM, “C” denotes combined IgG/IgM, and “P” denotes Pan-IgG.

Figure 2. Plot of PPV by prevalence (0.01 to 0.3), specificity (0.9 to 1), and sensitivity (0.8 to 1). Sensitivity is denoted by
color, with lighter colors denoting low sensitivity and darker colors denoting higher sensitivity. All parameters are reported as
decimals ranging from 0 to 1. PPV varied widely based on different parameters, ranging from 0.07 to 1.
(IgG and IgM), BioMerieux (IgG) and Roche – have upper bounds on false positive rates below 10% when the prevalence is
10%. In other words, 46 out of 61 tests could reasonably produce at least 1 false positive out of 10 positive tests if the regional
prevalence is 10%.
Estimates or confidence bounds of exactly 100%, reported for many, are shown for completeness. These estimates should
be interpreted with caution, as tests establishing sensitivity and specificity were done on small samples33 , which may lack
sufficient precision20, 35 for estimation when these quantities are expected to be close to 1. For example, while specificity
estimates of the tests by Ortho-Clinical were validated based on samples of around 400, estimates of 100% sensitivity by Abbott
and Roche or 100% specificity by Euroimmun and Mt. Sinai were validated on samples of less than 100. Yet, as shown by the
definitions and equations in the Supplementary Material, perfect (100%) specificity implies perfect PPV and perfect sensitivity
implies perfect NPV. In these cases, it is especially important to consider the entire range of values for PPV and FPR. Indeed,
while tests by Mt. Sinai and Euroimmun have point estimates and lower interval estimates of 0% false positives, upper interval
estimates climb to about 86%. Even at 10% prevalence, if the true specificity is closer to the lower 95% confidence limit, then
false positive rate of Euroimmun and Mt. Sinai would be above 35%, rendering over a third of positive serology test results as
likely false positives.
The test by Roche pharmaceuticals, advertised as highly accurate,36 , indeed has high PPV and low false positive rates even
at 1%, with an upper limits for the false positive rate of 25.2%.The Roche test is the only test available by the end of May
2020 that could have reasonably claimed to expect more true positive results than false positive results in populations with low
prevalence (1% or less). However, it would have still been reasonable to expect that up to one quarter of positive test results
could have come from patients lacking antibodies to SARS-COV-2. Given the sample size33 of 29 for calculating sensitivity, the
associated uncertainty could be compounded in the estimates of PPV and FPR, rendering the upper bounds critical to measure
and understand. Even six months later, only one test, (Simens Atellica IgG) has improved on this figure, with the smallest
upper confidence limit for FPR of 24.5% at 1% prevalence and a corresponding FPR point estimate of about 9%.

4 Application to Specific Locations
In this section, we evaluate PPV and FPR for a set of areas with three local studies of seroprevalence, in California, New
York, and Boston. When rigorous prevalence estimates are unavailable, we use the proportion of positive tests as surrogates

Prevalence

prevalence values are included from 0% to 5% by 0.2%.

for prevalence for the purpose of estimating the rates of false positives in these studies. Rationale for and limitations of this
approach along with a sensitivity analysis are discussed in the Supplementary Material.
4.1 Santa Clara County
An early seroprevalence study was conducted in Santa Clara County.However, after extensive scrutiny, the authors provided
updated estimates. Based on the updated preprint37 , the estimated prevalence adjusted for test performance characteristics were
1.2% (95%CI 0.7-1.8%) unweighted and 2.8% (95CI 1.3-4.7%) for weighted estimates based on demographic characteristics in
Santa Clara County. Reanalyses38, 39 reported updated seroprevalence ranges of 0.27% and 3.21%38 and 0% to 2.1%39 . An
estimate of prevalence in California from March 31 to April 7 is 0.9%31 . Estimates of sensitivity and specificity vary37–39 ;
we use the Bayesian posterior estimates39 combining information from all sources as 99.5% specificity with a 95% posterior
interval of (98.8%,99.8%) and 81.8% sensitivity (64.2%.91.0%)
Predictive values in the Santa Clara Study nearly spanned the entire range of probabilities. Using prevalence values
reflecting prior estimates ranging from 0% to 5%, the PPV in Santa Clara County at the time of the study ranges from 0% to
96% (Figure 5). Prevalence near the low but nonzero end of the updated estimates (e.g. 0.2%)38, 39 correspond to PPV ranging
from about 9.7% to to 47.7%, indicating that between about 26 and 46 of the 50 positive tests could be false. For prevalence
near the high end of the updated estimates (4.7%)37 ranges from 73.0% to 95.8%, or 2 to 14 false positives. Reanalyses estimate
smaller upper bounds on prevalence (2.1%39 and 3.2%38 ), which PPV ranges of 52.2% to 92.3% or 63.9% to 93.8%. These
estimates correspond to false positive counts ranging from 2 to 24 or 3 to 18.
4.2 New York
On April 23, Govornor Andrew Cuomo announced results from a serology study in New York40 . Seropositivity rates were
13.9% for the state overall and differed by region. New York City, Long Island, Westchester and Rockland, and elsewhere in
New York, respectively, had 21.2%, 16.7%, 11.7%, and 3.6% seropositive. Specificity for the test was reported to be in the
range of 93-100%41 , and sensitivity was not listed. However, the test was attributed to Wadsworth Center by the New York
State Department of Health; the Wadsworth test parameters are reported33 in Table 1. Results were then updated42 on May 2.
At that time, 12.3% of the population of New York state was reported to have Covid-19 antibodies based on a test of 15,000
people. By region, these figures ranged from 1.2% seropositive in North Country to 19.9% in New York City. We estimate the
PPV for all combinations of values reported in all of these sources assuming the same serology tests were used in both studies.
Figure 6 shows the range of PPV based on each of these possible values of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence. New York
City and Long Island had the highest prevalence and highest PPV, ranging from 74% to 98% and 60% to 97% in all scenarios.
Statewide and other areas are in the middle: 60% to 96% for Rockland, 65% to 97% for statewide. By contrast, PPV can be as
low as 30% for the rest of the state, assuming a prevalence 3.6%, if the specificity is 93% or as high as 87% if sensitivity is
at the upper limit of the confidence interval reported in the EUA33 . Even worse, areas with low prevalence42 such as North
Country (1.2%), Central NY (1.9%), and Capital District (2.2%) had PPV estimates ranging from 12% to 69%, 18% to 78%
and 21% to 81% In other words, the false positive rate in New York ranged from 2% to 88% depending on the region and
assumed prevalence under consideration and uncertainty in the sensitivity and specificity.

Figure 6. PPV for Antibodies test in New York Overall and by Region33, 40–42

4.2.1 Chelsea, Massachusetts

Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital conducted a seroprevalence study in the city of Chelsea22 and reported that
31.5% of participants tested positive. The researchers on the Chelsea study reported specificity exceeding 99.5%. However,
the manufacturer, BioMedomics, which is not part of the labs with EUA in Section 3.3, reports a sensitivity of 88.66% and
specificity of 90.63%,43 .
Assuming prevalence of 31.5% and specificity and sensitivity values reported by Biomedomics43 , PPV was only about 81%.
This means that in this sample of 63 positives, about 51 are expected to be true positives and about 12 are expected to be false
positives. Thus, the prevalence estimate in Chelsea reported in the press based on this sample alone is likely to be too high.
In addition, participants were recruited by a convenience sample of people outside on a particular street, which may not be
representative of the general population in Chelsea.

5 Discussion
Antibodies tests can yield two possible errors with different implications25 . Consequences of false negative test results would
likely relate to failing to remove negative effects of limitations during the pandemic. For example, assuming that antibodies
indeed confirm protection, then people with antibodies who test negative would be safe to return to work but their negative test
might convince them to remain at home. This would prolong the negative mental and physical effects of social isolation as well
as economic effects to individuals and society overall. Fortunately, the false negative rate was under 10% in all scenarios.
Unfortunately, the false positive rate can be shockingly high. Based on the prevalence estimated throughout the US and
serology studies in California, New York and Boston, the FPR of antibody test results range from 2% to 88%. Point estimates of
tests ests with an EUA44 reached 86% and upper limits reached 93% when the prevalence is 1%. Tests with low PPV and high
FPR can be dangerous by giving patients with positive tests a false sense of security. Ironically, these people may then increase
their risk of contracting Covid19 if they relax their use of protective measures, such as mask wearing and social distancing.
The timing of the test may impact the result, as discussed in the supplementary material. Briefly, seroconversion is the
process during which antibodies develop after infected by Covid19 become detectable in the blood; the seroconversion duration
could complicate the consideration of interpretation of serology test results. After infection, patients took about 3-40 days to
develop detectable antibodies45, 46 . Typically after 14 days, most patients will develop antibodies. If the testing period is within
14 days, the sensitivities of the tests will be lower.
The number and implication of false positives is growing with large organizations encouraging widespread serology testing.
Quest Diagnostics is offering tests by Abbott, Ortho-Clinical and Euroimmun for purchase47 . The tests can have up to 86% FPR
in locations with 1% prevalence. Even at 10% prevalence, over one-third of positives could be false. OneBlood, a non-profit
blood donation and distribution organization, is encouraging large scale blood donation and then testing samples for antibodies
using the OrthoClinical total test48 . As discussed in section 3.3, the OrthoClinical test could have a false positive rate of over
50% with 1% prevalence or nearly 10% if the prevalence is 10%. Further, OneBlood is planning to use blood samples testing
positive for antibodies as convalescent plasma. In fact, on August 23, the FDA granted EUA for convalescent plasma in patients
hospitalized with Covid-1949 . As shown in this paper, single serology tests of the general population in low prevalence areas
could yield a large number of false positives, which could inadvertently harm patients. Using all samples that test positive
could mean that large numbers of samples falsely considered to contain convalescent plasma which would become inadvertent

placebos for patients actively struggling with Covid-19.
More recently, with the impending approval of vaccine candidates, there is a need to determine the prioritization of
groups throughout the dose distribution process. In some discussions50 , patients who previously contracted covid-19 could be
considered lower priority for receiving vaccine until after the uninfected public. Given the false positives discussed in serology
tests in this paper, it would be imprudent to determine past disease status by widespread serology testing alone. In this case,
uninfected individuals who falsely test positive on serology tests would be denied the vaccine in a timely manner and therefore
would have to wait longer for the opportunity to vaccinate and protect themselves from the virus. We recommend against using
single serology tests to screen for prior infection. In fact, the length of protection from reinfection is unknown for individuals
with prior exposure either to the disease itself or via vaccination.
One recommendation for individuals who test positive is to consider a follow-up antibody test51 . For instance, if the FPR is
50%, assuming independent tests, the probability of two false positives drops in half (25%). The FDA includes a calculator for
PPV of individual and combined tests33 . Follow-up tests are common in other diseases with low PPV screening methods, such
as mammograms for breast cancer52 . For instance, one could use a highly sensitive test with sensitivity/specificity, say, 99%
and 90 %, respectively, as the initial test, and then followed up a highly specific test with sensitivity/specificity of 90% and
99% respectively, as the second test. Then, the FPR (i.e.,1-PPV) would drop from 81.9% to 10% for a place with prevalence
at 1%. For a place with high prevalence at 10%, the FPR could drop from 47.6% to 1% Another idea is to test all contacts
for antibodies and use their results as evidence to support or refute the original serology test. Pursuing contacts of additional
seropositive individuals may increased contact tracing and testing, which can either hinder growth of future outbreaks or divert
scarce resources from higher risk contacts25 . Moreover, increased testing brings cost and feasibility concerns.
There are some additional limitations of our paper. For instance, some of the information may become outdated quickly.
Tests operating under an FDA EUA will likely increase over time. For instance, Abbott Alinity was added to the original
12 tests made available by FDA under EUA in early May 2020 while writing the first draft of this paper. At the time, the
FDA noted that at least 160 serology tests were available before the FDA increased its oversight53 . This implies some of the
antibody tests on the market might even have lower sensitivity or specificity than those included in this paper and therefore
have even higher FPR. Indeed, between the original paper submission in June 2020 and this revision in December 2020, two
tests, AutoBio and ChemBio, had their FDA EUA revoked54, 55 . Notably, valaues for BioRad and Ortho-Clinical changed, and
Diasorin added an IgM test along with its earlier IgG test. Similarly, if an infected patient takes the test before antibodies are
developed, then the sensitivity will be lower. An extended discussion is included in the Supplementary Material. At the same
time, prevalence may increase over time at least for some of the cities or towns. A reference to prevalence estimates calculated
by the CDC and current as of the writing of this revision is provided32 . Importantly, neither the results nor the interpretation for
serology tests generalize to diagnostic tests. The Supplementary Material provides a brief discussion.
In conclusion, serology tests for the novel coronavirus generally have low false negative rates and highly volatile false
positive rates. While false positive rates decrease with increasing prevalence, current prevalence estimates remain low in most
areas of the US. With increasing serology testing and likely increased reporting of testing results, it is critical to understand
these values and interpret test results properly. We hope that this context and interpretation can aid doctors, patients, researchers,
and policy makers in informed decision making, which may even save lives.

6 Methods
We collected reported sensitivity and specificity values of serology tests with EUA approval by the US FDA. Prevalence
estimates were also collected to determine an appropriate range for the plots. These values were combined to produce estimates
of PPV and NPV for a variety of input parameter values. We then honed in on specific FDA tests and areas that have conducted
serology tests to provide estimates and uncertainty for PPV and false positive rates.
All programs utilized R version 3.6.156 . PPV and NPV were calculated using package MKmisc57 . Plots were created
with packages plotly58 and ggplot259 . Figures 1 and 2, as higher dimensional plots, were designed to allow interactive
visualization. Code to generate the plots and view them in an interactive mode may be downloaded from our github repository
at https://github.com/nbrownst/AntibodiesPredictiveValues.
