Abstract

25

The ongoing novel coronavirus pneumonia COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, has engendered

26

numerous cases of infection and death. COVID-19 diagnosis relies upon nucleic acid detection;

27

however, current recommended methods exhibit high false-negative rates, low sensitivity, and

28

cannot identify other respiratory virus infections, thereby resulting patient misdiagnosis and

29

impeding epidemic containment. Combining the advantages of target amplification and long-read,

30

real-time nanopore sequencing, we developed nanopore target sequencing (NTS) to detect SARS-

31

CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses simultaneously within 6–10 h. Parallel testing with approved

32

qPCR kits of SARS-CoV-2 and NTS using 61 nucleic acid samples from suspected COVID-19

33

cases confirmed that NTS identified more infected patients as positive, and could also monitor for

34

mutated nucleic acid sequence or other respiratory virus infection in the test sample. NTS is thus

35

suitable for contemporary COVID-19 diagnosis; moreover, this platform can be further extended

36

for diagnosing other viruses or pathogens.

Introduction

39

An ongoing novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) outbreak originating in Wuhan, China in

40

December 2019 has subsequently spread across China and worldwide, resulting in numerous cases

41

of infection and death1. Usually, COVID-19 has an incubation period of 2–7 days2 with no obvious

42

symptoms, during which time the virus can spread from infected to uninfected individuals.

43

Therefore, early accurate diagnosis and isolation of patients is key to controlling the epidemic.

44

Nucleic acid detection is the golden standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. Real-time reverse

45

transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is the most recommend testing method for

46

detecting the causative virus, SARS-CoV-23. qPCR is specific, rapid, and economic, but cannot

47

precisely analyze amplified gene fragment nucleic acid sequences; thus, positive infection is

48

confirmed by monitoring one or two sites (depending on manufacturer guidelines). However, qPCR

49

exhibits high false-negative rates and low sensitivity in clinical application4, with only 30–50%

50

positive detection ratio. False-negatives facilitate epidemic spread through delayed patient isolation

51

and treatment, and patients mistakenly considered uninfected or cured following misdiagnosed

52

treatment results. Another recommend detection method, sequencing, is widely applied for

53

pathogen identification and monitoring virus evolution5, 6 including SARS-CoV-27, but requires

54

expensive equipment, operator expertise, and > 24 h turnaround time, rendering it unsuitable for the

55

current crisis.

56

Several intelligent methods for RNA virus detection have developed including combining

57

toehold switch sensors8, which can bind to and sense virtually any RNA sequence, with paper-based

58

cell-free protein synthesis for Ebola and Zika virus detection9, 10, and the SHERLOCK method

59

based on CRISPR/Cas13a for Zika or Dengue virus detection11. A rapid SHERLOCK method with

60

visual results can detect SARS-CoV-212 and toehold switch biosensors could theoretically be

61

developed for rapid and high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, the requirement of

62

specific RNA regions as targets may negatively affect detection rates because target region

63

mutation may limit target availability.

64

Moreover, pneumonia and fever may be caused by other respiratory viruses13. Cross-infection

65

during the diagnosis process both spreads SARS-CoV-2 and subjects COVID-19 patients to other

66

respiratory viruses. In severe cases, comprehensive analysis of infecting viruses is necessary.

67

Therefore, a rapid, accurate, and comprehensive detection method is needed to inform clinical

68

treatment and control cross-infection to reduce mortality.

69

Currently, COVID-19 infection and death rates in Hubei province are the highest in China.

70

Being located at the center of this epidemic, we developed a nanopore target sequencing (NTS)

71

method combining the advantages of target amplification and long-read, real-time nanopore

72

sequencing for detecting SARS-CoV-2 with higher sensitivity than standard qPCR, simultaneously

73

with other common respiratory viruses and mutated nucleic acid sequence within 6–10 h.

Results

76

NTS design for SARS-CoV-2 detection. NTS is based upon amplification of 11 virulence-related

77

and specific gene fragments (orf1ab) of SARS-CoV-2 using a primer panel developed in-house,

78

followed by sequencing the amplified fragments on a nanopore platform. To enhance sensitivity, we

79

focused on virulence-related genes as targets without limitation to the sites currently recommended

80

by Chinese or American Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in qPCR methods (Fig. 1). Because

81

this method can precisely determine nucleic acid sequences, positive infection can be confirmed by

82

analyzing output sequence identity, coverage, and read number.

83

To realize detection of pivotal SARS-CoV-2 virulence genes, we focused on the virulence

84

region (genome bp 21,563–29,674; NC_045512.2), encoding S (1273 amino acids; AA), ORF3a

85

(275 AA), E (75 AA), M (222 AA), ORF6 (61 AA), ORF7a (121 AA), ORF8 (121 AA), N (419

86

AA), and ORF10 (38 AA) proteins. We also considered the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase

87

(RdRP) region in orf1ab (Fig. 1). For the virulence regions, 11 fragments of 600–950 bp were

88

designed as targets, fully covering the 9,115 bp region (Fig.1), amplified by 22 specific primers

89

designed considering primer-primer interaction and annealing temperature, and potential non-

90

specific binding to human and common bacterium and fungi genomes. To improve the sensitivity

91

orf1ab region amplification, we designed two pairs of nested primers to amplify 300–500 bp

92

regions to avoid amplification failures owing to site mutation. Finally, the 26 primers were

93

combined to develop the SARS-CoV-2 primer panel (Supplementary Table 1).

94

For sequencing, we chose a nanopore platform that could sequence long nucleic acid fragments

95

and simultaneously analyze the data-output in real-time. This allowed confirmation of SARS-CoV-

96

2 infection within a few minutes after sequencing by mapping the sequence reads to the SARS-

97

CoV-2 genome and analysis of output sequence identity, coverage, and read number. Moreover, the

98

accurate nucleic acid sequence generated using our pipeline could indicate whether the virulence-

99

related genes were mutated during virus spreading, thereby rapidly providing information for

100

subsequent epidemiological analysis. Additionally, as the MinION nanopore sequencer is portable,

101

NTS is also suitable for front-line clinics.

106

samples (cDNA reverse-transcribed from an uninfected respiratory flora throat swab) at 10, 100,

107

500, 1000, and 3000 copies/mL. NTS for all test samples was performed on one MinION sequencer

108

chip. Sequence data were evaluated at regular intervals using our in-house bioinformatics pipeline.

109

By mapping output reads on the SARS-CoV-2 genome, all reads with high identity were calculated

110

for each plasmid concentration. For 10 min and 1 h sequencing data, reads mapped to SARS-CoV-2

111

significantly differed from those of negative controls in all replicates at concentrations ranging from

112

3000 to 500 (Fig. 2a), and 3000 and 10 (Fig. 2b) copies/mL, respectively. This result confirmed that

113

high-copy samples could rapidly yield sufficient valid sequencing data for diagnosis, and by

114

extending the sequencing time, valid sequencing data could also be obtained from low-copy

115

samples. Notably, as more sequencing data could be achieved with additional sequencing time

116

(Supplementary Fig. 1) and clinical samples may exhibit higher complexity, thus, 10 min (for quick

117

detection) and 4 h (for final evaluation) sequencing times were used in subsequent evaluation of

118

NTS in clinical samples.

119

Evaluation of the target distribution of these valid data revealed that in higher copies samples

120

(1000 and 3000 copies/mL), all targeted regions could be detected (Fig. 2c, d). However, in lower

121

viral concentration samples (from 10 to 500 copies/mL), some targeted regions were lost (i.e., no

122

reads mapped; Fig. 2c, d), indicating that for low-quality or low-abundance samples, comprehensive

123

fragment amplification is difficult. Therefore, for accurate results, NTS cannot label a sample as

124

positive for infection by monitoring only one or two sites, as is customary for qPCR; rather, the

125

results from all target regions should be considered.

126

Accordingly, we determined a scoring rule by referring to previous judgment rules14-16. Firstly,

127

we counted the number of output reads with high identity to the SARS-CoV-2 genome, indicative

128

of high credibility for identification as SARS-CoV-2. By calculating the ratio of the counted valid

129

read numbers of the test sample to those of the negative control (with “0” in the negative control

130

calculated as “1”), we defined that a ratio of ≥10 indicates a positive result for that fragment,

131

scoring 1; ≥3 to 10 fold is inconclusive, scoring 0.4; and <3 is negative, scoring 0. Scores were

132

summed to obtain the NTS score. We considered that a sample in which at least 50% fragments (6

133

fragments) are inconclusive or 2 fragments are positive (comparable to qPCR results) could be

134

defined as a positive infected sample (e.g., NTS score >2.4); 3–6 inconclusive fragments or 1

135

positive fragment indicated a highly suspect (inconclusive) sample (e.g., NTS score of 1.2–2.4); and

136

< 3 inconclusive or no positive fragments could be defined as negative sample (NTS score <1.2).

137

To determine the NTS LoD, we used the defined rules to evaluate each replicate in the

138

simulated test. As the standard plasmids contain only 6 designed fragments (half of 12 designed

139

fragments for SARS-CoV-2), we defined the scoring as NTS score >1.2 indicates positive

140

detection, 0.6–1.2 is inconclusive, and < 0.6 reflects negative detection. We calculated the score of

141

the lowest concentration (10 copies) at different times according to this scoring method and judged

142

the positive detection rate. The results (Supplementary table 2) showed that 3/4 of the 10 copies of

143

the standard plasmids can be judged positive from 1 h. This result is consistent with the significant

144

comparation (Fig. 2b), that the data for 10 copies standard plasmids is also significantly different

145

from the negative control from 1h. This result shows that our scoring system is reliable for

146

evaluating NTS test results, and the LoD (3/4 replicates positive) was determined as 10 copies/mL

147

with 1h sequencing data (1,372 to 43,967 reads per sample in a run with 24 samples).

SARS-CoV-2 detection using qPCR vs NTS. We performed clinical sample testing at the first-

152

the epidemic. On February 6 and 7, 2020, we parallel tested these 45 samples in two batches using

153

NTS (two chips) and qPCR (kit 2; Fig. 1). The 4 h sequencing output data (Fig. 4a) revealed that all

154

19 samples defined as positive by qPCR were recognized SARS-CoV-2-infected by NTS,

155

indicating good inter-test concordance. Among 15 qPCR-inconclusive samples, 11 were recognized

156

as SARS-CoV-2-infected, 3 as negative, and 1 inconclusive by NTS. Among 11 qPCR-negative

157

samples, 4 were recognized SARS-CoV-2-infected, 4 as inconclusive, and 3 as negative by NTS.

158

Overall, NTS identified a total of 34 positive samples in 45 suspected samples, 15 more than qPCR.

159

Evaluation of output data after 10 min sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 2) revealed that 21 of 45

160

suspected samples were recognized as SARS-CoV-2-infected by NTS. For these samples, the 10

161

min and 4 h results were comparable, indicating that NTS could rapidly detect many positive

162

samples.

163

However, as the tested 45 samples were from early outpatients without detailed records, suitable

164

clinical data, such as chest computed tomographic scans, were not available to support the results.

165

Therefore, we next evaluated samples retained from hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-

166

19 subjected to qPCR testing (kit 1, Fig. 1) on February 11 and 12, 2020. We randomly selected 16

167

samples for NTS testing on February 20, 2020. 4 h sequencing (Fig. 4b) identified all 16 positive

168

samples, whereas only 9 samples were positive by qPCR. At the time of this writing, among these 7

169

samples that qPCR negative or inconclusive, electronic records indicated that subsequent qPCR

170

testing of 4 of these 7 patients revealed two (R04 and R09) as positive whereas two (R06 and R07)

171

remained inconclusive. This result confirmed that NTS could identify more positive cases than

172

qPCR. Three positive samples were identified by 10 min sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 2),

173

indicating that NTS could rapidly detect positive samples with high concentration of virus.

174

Evaluation of the positive target distribution for each sample (Fig. 4) showed that samples

175

positive by both NTS and qPCR appeared to have higher nucleic acid quality or abundance, because

176

NTS yielded more positive fragments. For qPCR-inconclusive samples, NTS yielded few, scattered

177

positive target fragments, suggesting that low sample nucleic acid quality or abundance rendered it

178

difficult to draw clear conclusions by qPCR based on evaluation of only two sites. Moreover,

179

contamination of individual viral fragments did not affect NTS results. For example, although the

180

negative control of the first chip in Fig. 4 appears to have been contaminated with a fragment

181

containing the N gene, we could exclude the contamination using a high threshold, and/or base the

182

final conclusions on the 11 remaining sites. However, negative control contamination in qPCR

183

would invalidate the results of the whole experimental batch.

184
185

SARS-CoV-2 mutation analysis. Mutation screening of 19 samples from outpatients indicated as

186

infection-positive by both NTS and qPCR identified single nucleotide mutations at seven sites in

187

four samples (Table 1), three of which (S_519 of C1, N_822 of C2, and S_2472 of E3) harbored

188

silent mutations. One variant (ORF8_251: T→C), encoding an AA change from Leu to Ser, was

189

identified in the three samples. The ORF8_184 mutation in sample E3 also reflected a Val to Leu

190

missense mutation. Comparison with the 67 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes reported in the

191

GISAID database prior to February 8, 2020 revealed that ORF8_251 contained C in 20, T in 48, and

192

Y in 1 genome, indicating its diversity in different strains. Additionally, single genomes contained

193

C or S at ORF8_184 whereas the remaining 67 had G, indicating that despite some inter-strain

194

diversity, G→C transversion was rare. The remaining silent variants were not identified in the

195

GISAID database, suggesting that the virus may harbor mutations as yet uncharacterized by existing

196

genome-wide sequencing methods.

NTS panel for respiratory virus identification. The inability of current clinically utilized SARS-

199

CoV-2 qPCR kits to identify the species of co-infecting viruses combined with the high false-

200

negative rate of qPCR compromises early patient triage, resulting in wasted urgent medical

201

resources and enhancing potential cross-contamination during the diagnosis process.

202

Distinguishing different types of respiratory viral infections has attracted worldwide attention.

203

To extend the scope of NTS-based virus detection, we designed a respiratory virus primer panel

204

for amplification of 10 respiratory viruses including bocavirus, rhinovirus, human

205

metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus,

206

influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and influenza C virus. We collected target gene candidates

207

utilized for virus identification in the literature, then collected all complete and partial target gene

208

sequences for these viruses available at GenBank (through November 1, 2019). Though multiple

209

nucleic acid sequence alignment of each gene, the conserved regions were chosen as candidate

210

regions for amplification. Using similar constraints as for SARS-CoV-2 target region selection, we

211

chose 20 target amplification regions (300–800 bp) for these 10 respiratory viruses (Supplementary

212

Table 3) capable of accurately distinguishing virus in addition to identifying virus species. We

213

designed 59 primers including some nested primers for amplification of these regions, comprising

214

the respiratory virus primer panel (Supplementary Table 4).

215

To verify the performance of this panel in NTS, we selected five virus-positive samples

216

(influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus), the

217

viruses in the clinical throat swabs were previously confirmed using a China Food and Drug

218

Administration (cFDA) approved kit (Health Gene Technologies, China) based on multiplex PCR

219

and capillary electrophoresis analysis. The five samples were mixed to create a mock virus

220

community and used to test the NTS virus detection capacity. NTS 10 min sequencing data

221

(Supplementary Table 5) successfully detected four of five viruses (influenza A virus, influenza B

222

virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus); the remaining one virus with lower load could be

223

detected with 2 h sequencing data, confirming the suitability of NTS with the respiratory virus

224

primer panel for identification of other respiratory viruses.

225

To verify the ability of NTS to detect SARS-CoV-2 and 10 kinds of respiratory viruses in a

226

single assay, 13 of the 45 suspected COVID-19 outpatient samples were subjected to simultaneous

227

detection analysis. Five replications of the plasmid containing the SARS-CoV-2 S and N genes

228

served as the positive control and Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer was used as the negative control (in

229

duplicate). For each sample, cDNA samples were separately amplified using the respiratory virus

230

and the SARS-CoV-2 primer panels, then all amplified fragments were pooled. After the addition of

231

barcodes, amplified fragments from all 20 samples (13 cases, 7 controls) were subjected nanopore

232

sequencing on one chip. Analysis of the results (Table 2) revealed that E11 was co-infected by

233

influenza A virus H3N2 and SARS-CoV-2.

234
235
236

Discussion

237

Herein, we developed an NTS method able to simultaneously detect SARS-CoV-2 and 10

238

additional types of respiratory viruses within 6–10 h, at LoD of 10 copies/mL with at least 1 h

239

sequencing data. The detection region of SARS-CoV-2 was composed of 12 fragments covering

240

nearly 10 kb of the genome, resulting in markedly higher sensitivity and accuracy than those of

241

qPCR kits currently in clinical use. Notably, 22 of 61 suspected COVID-19 samples that were

242

negative or inconclusive by qPCR testing were identified as positive by NTS. Moreover, NTS

243

enabled the detection of virus mutations; in particular, we detected a nucleotide mutation in SARS-

244

CoV-2 that was undetected in the genomic data in the current GISAID database. Although this was

245

a silent mutation, its presence suggests that the virus may have undergone mutation during the

246

spreading process. Additionally, NTS was verified as capable of detecting all five pre-added

247

respiratory viruses in a single detection. This method also detected a co-infected case (SARS-CoV-

248

2 and human influenza A virus H3N2) using a clinical specimen, illustrating the ability of NTS to

249

detect and distinguish respiratory viruses. Together, our findings indicate that NTS is highly

250

suitable for the detection and variation monitoring of current COVID-19 epidemics, directly from

251

clinical samples with same-day turnaround of results.

252

At the time of this writing, the COVID-19 epidemic remains very severe. Accurate, rapid, and

253

comprehensive nucleic acid detection methods are needed to allow patients with suspected infection

254

to be isolated and treated as soon as possible, and to accurately confirm whether the patient is cured,

255

to prevent continued epidemic spread caused by misdiagnosis. The LoD of NTS was shown to be as

256

low as 10 copies/mL, rendering it 100-fold more sensitive than qPCR (e.g., some kits describe

257

LoDs of 1000 copies/mL) and thus likely to decrease the high false-negative rate plaguing current

258

detection methods. In addition, the detection of co-infection may allow the prevention of disease

259

progression from mild to severe or might be useful to inform clinical treatment. Overall, NTS

260

combines sensitivity, broad detection range, same-day rapid turnaround time, variation monitoring,

261

and low cost (compared with whole-genome sequencing), making it the most suitable method for

262

the detection of suspected viral infections that cannot be effectively diagnosed by other methods.

263

Moreover, the MinION, the smallest Oxford Nanopore sequencer, is smaller than a cellphone; when

264

equipped with a laptop computer for data processing, it thus allows rapid performance of NTS in

265

various environments with low equipment cost. For data analysis, cloud analysis may also be

266

introduced for high-throughput detection17, 18.

267

Several limitations of the current NTS method should be noted. Because the designed amplified

268

fragments are 300–950 bp in length, which constitute suitable lengths for detection by a nanopore

269

platform as nucleic acid fragments < 200 bp cannot be readily detected19, 20, thereby, the sensitivity

270

of NTS for detecting target COVID-19 fragments in highly degraded nucleic acids may be

271

hampered. Additionally, although the turnaround time of NTS is longer than that of qPCR or other

272

possible nucleic acid detection methods (e.g., SHERLOCK12), 6–10 h is considered acceptable for

273

clinical use; moreover, NTS is already the fastest strategy based on sequencing methods to date and

274

can detect variations directly from clinical samples. Whereas the detection throughput of NTS is not

275

high at present, the NTS method can be integrated into widely used automated or semi-automated

276

platforms to improve the detection throughput in the future21-23. In addition, because PCR is

277

included in NTS, processes involving opening the lid of the PCR tubes may cause mutual

278

contamination between samples24, 25. However, this situation also is inevitable in current nucleic

279

acid detection methods (e.g., qPCR) or other nucleic acid detection schemes (e.g., SHERLOCK11, 12

280

or toehold switch biosensor9, 10) that also involve PCR. The introduction of integration systems or

281

sealed devices such as microfluidics may avoid this situation26, 27. At present, our processes of

282

sequencing data analysis and interpretation of results are not mature; nevertheless, as the number of

283

test samples increases, additional test results will be collected and the process continuously

284

optimized to obtain more accurate results.

285

Notably, the comparison of NTS and qPCR results indicated a high false-negative rate in the

286

latter. This result highlights the need for extreme vigilance, as patient misdiagnosis (including

287

patients admitted and discharged) will lead to spread of the epidemic and greater public health

288

threat. Suspected or negative results reported by the current qPCR methods should be subjected to a

289

more accurate method for secondary confirmation; for this, we consider NTS as the most

290

recommended solution currently available. The situation of co-infection, which has been reported in

291

our previous study13, also warrants continued attention. Based on the current centralized treatment

292

strategy, the lack of screening for multiple viruses may lead to large-scale cross-contamination and

293

confound clinical diagnosis and treatment. Alternatively, NTS represents and effective strategy that

294

can rapid and accurate distinguish SARS-CoV-2 and multiple respiratory viruses at both the species

295

and subtype level, and could be applied as a spot check in centralized clinics. Finally, the NTS

296

method for respiratory virus detection might be extended to detect more viruses and other pathogens

297

through the design of additional primer panels.

298
299

Methods

300

Primer panel design for SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 primer panel was designed to

301

simultaneously detect virus virulence- and infection-related genes and variants thereof. The 21,563–

302

29,674 bp genome region, containing the genes encoding S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8,

303

N, and ORF10, was selected as a template to design a series of end-to-end primers. The region

304

encoding ORF1ab was selected as a template to design a nested primer for higher sensitivity

305

detection of SARS-CoV-2. All primers were designed using online primer-blast

306

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.c/tools/primer-blast/) and the specificity of all primers was verified

307

against Homo sapiens, fungi, and bacteria. Finally, we downloaded and selected N, S, rdrp, and E

308

gene sequences of SARS-related viruses available at GenBank through January 1st, 2020 (accession

309

NC_045512). Multiple sequence alignment of SARS-CoV-2 against SARS-related viruses was

310

performed using Clustal W (version 1.83) for each gene individually and the alignment was used for

311

in-silico evaluation of specificity of the designed primers to SARS-CoV-2. All the specific primers

312

were collected to form the SARS-CoV-2 primer panel.

313
314

Primers panel design for 10 kinds of respiratory virus detection. The target genes for each virus

315

were selected based on previous literature retrieval and all complete and partial gene sequences

316

available in GenBank through November 1, 2019 were downloaded. The list for each target gene

317

was manually checked and artificial sequences (e.g., lab-derived, synthetic) along with sequence

318

duplicates was removed, resulting in a final list. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using

319

Clustal W (version 1.83) for each gene individually and the variation rate of each base was

320

calculated using an in-house pipeline. The final primers for each virus were manually selected

321

following the previous metrics28 for multiplex PCR design with an expected amplicon length range

322

from 300 to 800 bp.

324

LoD of the NTS test. Individual NTS libraries were prepared from a virus-negative nasopharyngeal

325

swab spiked with plasmids containing synthetic S and N genes of COVID-19 at concentrations of 0,

326

10, 100, 500, 1,000, and 3,000 copies/mL, with four replicates at each concentration. The NTS

327

libraries were prepared as described above and sequenced using MinION for 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2

328

h, and 4 h. The sequencing data were processed as described for virus identification. The LoD was

329

determined when the concentration of reads mapped to COVID-19 was significantly higher than

330

that for the negative control in 3/4 replicates.

(10 μM), and 10 μL 2× Phusion U Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher, USA)29, 30.

335

Amplification was performed in a C1000 Thermocycler (Bio-Rad, USA) using the following

336

procedure: 1 cycle at 94 C for 3 min and 30 cycles at 95 C for 10 s, 55 C for 50 s, and 68 C for

337

5s, followed by a final elongation step at 68 C for 5 min. The product of the first-step was purified

338

with 0.8× AMpure beads (Beckman Coulter, USA) and eluted in 10 μL Tris- EDTA (TE) buffer.

339

Then, 5 μL eluate was used for second-step PCR with 5 μL barcoded primer (10 μM) and 10 μL 2×

340

Phusion U Multiplex PCR Master Mix. The barcode sequence was from the Nanopore PCR barcode

341

kit (EXP-PBC096; UK) and all primer oligos and full-length S and N gene fragments were

342

synthesized by Genscript (China). The products of second-step PCR from the different samples

343

were pooled with equal masses. TE buffer was assayed in each batch as a negative control.

344

Sequencing libraries were constructed using the 1D Ligation Kit (SQK-LSK109; Oxford Nanopore,

345

UK) and sequenced using Oxford Nanopore MinION or GridION.

346
347

Nanopore sequencing data processing. Basecalling and quality assessment for MinION

348

sequencing data were performed using high accuracy mode in Guppy (v. 3.1.5) software; for

349

GridION, the process was conducted using MinKNOW (v. 3.6.5) integrated in the instrument.

350

Sequencing reads with low quality and undesired length were discarded. Then, Porechop31 (v. 0.2.4)

351

was used for adaptor trimming and barcode demultiplexing for retained reads.

352
353

Mapping tool and mapping database. BLASTn32 (v. 2.9.0+) was used to map the reads of each

354

sample against the virus genome reference database. All virus genomic sequences were downloaded

355

from NCBI Refseq FTP and the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was added to the BLAST database

356

subsequently. The taxonomy of each read was assigned according to the taxonomic information of

357

the mapped subject sequence.

358
359

Sequence correction and candidate mutation calling. Sequence correction was performed using

360

medaka33 (v. 0.10.5), which is a tool to create a consensus sequence of nanopore sequencing data.

361

For each target sequencing region, 30 consensus sequences were generated using medaka’s default

362

settings through the medaka_consensus program. Subsequently, the consensus sequences were

363

aligned to the reference sequence of target sequencing regions using the multiple sequence

364

alignment tool ClustalW34 (version 1.83). The variants within certainty regions (except sequence

365

homopolymeric regions and primer binding sites)35 and with appropriate coverage (covered by at

366

least 90% consensus sequences and at least 50% uncorrected reads) were accepted as candidate

367

nucleotide mutations.

368
369

Interpretation of NTS results. The sequenced data were obtained at regular intervals after

370

sequencing, then filtered to obtain valid reads. For determining whether the target was positive,

371

interpretation was performed using the previous rule with modification14-16. In brief, if the read

372

matches the design fragment, the read will be counted. The mapping score was determined as 1, 0.4,

373

or 0 when the ratio of count number in the sample to the negative control of each target was > 10,

374

between 3–10, or < 3. The total mapping score of each target was summed and samples with > 2.4

375

total mapping score were defined as positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection; 1.2 to 2.4 total mapping

376

score indicated an inconclusive result, and < 1.2 total mapping score was considered to indicate

377

negative for infection. For determination of the other 10 kinds of common respiratory virus, a

sample was considered positive for the virus if positive for at least one designed site, otherwise it

379

was negative.

381

Total nucleic acid extraction from clinical specimens. Clinical throat swab specimens were

382

collected in 10 mL of Viral Transport Medium (Becton Dickinson, USA) from 45 suspected

383

COVID-19 outpatients, and 16 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at Renming Hospital of

384

Wuhan University in Wuhan during February 2020. All throat swabs were sent to a clinical

385

laboratory and processed immediately. Swabs were vortexed in 1 mL of TE buffer and centrifuged

386

at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and 200 μL of the specimen was retained

387

for total nucleic acid extraction. Total nucleic acid was extracted from 200 μL of pre-treated

388

samples using the Sansure SUPRall DNA Extraction Kit (Changsha, China) following the

389

manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted total nucleic acid was stored at 70 °C until qPCR or NTS

390

testing.

391
392

qPCR for confirmation of SARS-Cov-2 infection. The total isolated nucleic acid was used for

393

qPCR assay following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, qPCR was carried out in a 25 μL

reaction system using a novel coronavirus qPCR kit (kit 1, Huirui, China) with 5 μL total nucleic

395

acid, or 20 μL reaction system using the 2019-nCoV qPCR kit (kit 2, BioGerm, China) with 5 μL

396

total nucleic acid. For kit 1, amplification was performed using a Quantstudio Dx Real-time PCR

397

system (Thermo Fisher, USA) with the following procedure: 1 cycle at 50 C for 15 min and 95 C

398

for 5 min, and 35 cycles at 95 C for 10 s, 55 C for 40 s. The FAM and ROX fluorescence

401

35.2 to 39.2 was recognized as inconclusive, and one of the genes being undetected or Ct ≥ 39.2

402

was recognized as negative. For kit 2, amplification was performed in a CFX96 Thermocycler (Bio-

403

Rad) using the following procedure: 1 cycle at 50 C for 10 min and 95 C for 5 min, and 35 cycles

404

at 95 C for 10 s, 55 C for 40 s. The FAM, HEX, and CY5 fluorescence channels were used to

405

detect Orf1ab, E, and N genes, respectively. This kit only utilized the results of the Orf1ab and N

406

gene to reach a conclusion. Successful amplification of both genes and Ct value ≤35 was recognized

407

as positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection; only one site with Ct value ≤35 or both genes between Ct 35

408

to 38 was taken as inconclusive, and no successful amplification or Ct ≥ 38 was recognized as

409

negative for infection.
