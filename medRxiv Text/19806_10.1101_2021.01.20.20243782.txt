Abstract
COVID-19 testing is not accessible for millions during this pandemic despite our best efforts.
Without greatly expanded testing of asymptomatic individuals, contact tracing and subsequent
isolation of spreaders remains as a means for control. In an effort to increase RT-PCR assay
testing for the presence of the novel beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 as well as improve sample
collection safety, GenTegra LLC has introduced two products for saliva collection and viral
RNA stabilization: GTR-STMTM (GenTegra Saliva Transport Medium) and GTR-STMdkTM
(GenTegra Saliva Transport Medium Direct to PCR). Both products contain a proprietary
formulation based on GenTegra’s novel “Active Chemical ProtectionTM” (ACP) technology that
gives non-dilutive, error-free saliva sample collection using RNA stabilization chemicals already
dried in the collection tube.
GTR-STM can be used for safer saliva-based sample collection at home (or at a test site).
Following saliva collection, the sample-containing GTR-STM can be kept at ambient
temperature during shipment to an authorized CLIA lab for analysis. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in
GTR-STM is stable for over a month at ambient temperature, easily surviving the longest
transit times from home to lab. GTR-STM enhances patient comfort, convenience, compliance
and reduces infectious virus exposure to essential medical and lab professionals.
Alternatively, the GTR-STMdk direct-into-PCR product can be used to improve lab throughput
and reduce reagent costs for saliva sample collection and testing at any lab site with access to
refrigeration. GTR-STMdk reduces lab process time by 25% and reagent costs by 30%
compared to other approaches. Since GTR-STMdk retains SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA stability for
three days at ambient temperature, it is optimized for lab test site rather than at home saliva
collection. SARS-COV-2 viral RNA levels as low as 0.4 genome equivalents/uL are detected in
saliva samples using GTR-STMdk. The increased sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection can
expand COVID-19 testing to include asymptomatic individuals using pooled saliva.

Introduction
The global COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,
continues to ravage countries, with the United States bearing the brunt of the attack, and other
nations bracing for a second wave (1-3). Testing and contact screening are the primary tools
necessary to prevent and contain the infection within communities (4-8).
Rapid strides have been made in advancing molecular and antigen-based testing, which
measure viral RNA and surface protein respectively (9-12) for the SARS-CoV-2. Significant
progress has been achieved on three fronts, all of which play a significant role in improving
patient comfort, patient convenience, and therefore, patient compliance. One major
advancement is the shift away from complicated nasopharyngeal (NP) sampling to simpler
saliva sampling.
CDC guidance recommends nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs for collection of samples for SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR testing (13). NP sample collection can be uncomfortable, is not suitable for
self-collection, and puts the health care professional at risk of infection (14,15). Some of the
challenges for collection of NP sample include: (i) Difficulty in collection as the NP probe must be
inserted deep into the nostril causing discomfort to the patient and often a gag/cough
response. (ii) An element of risk for the trained healthcare professionals authorized to collect
the NP sample (15,16). (iii) Shortages in availability of swabs and personal protective
equipment for testing, a situation that led to significant under-testing of US populations at risk
during the first few months of the pandemic (17,18). (iv) Requiring significant increases in the
numbers of trained (currently insufficient) healthcare personnel to staff sample collection sites for
testing to expand to mass screening.
In contrast to NP swabs, saliva is a convenient, safe, and effective sample for SARS-CoV-2
testing, even for children (19-22). This makes it possible to have home saliva collection kits in
which patients self-collect the saliva in a sampling tube, which is then mailed to a CLIAcertified laboratory for testing and analysis. Recently, the FDA has approved saliva as an
alternate sample for COVID-19 testing (23). Saliva yields diagnostic test results comparable to
NP swabs (22). The ease of collection of saliva makes it ideal for the expansion of repeated
testing programs in schools, workplaces, and for frequent travelers.

Overview of Existing Saliva Sample Collection and Transport Media Products
Most saliva sampling and transport media products currently marketed require a two-step
process for saliva collection. First, approximately 1mL of saliva must be expectorated (spat)

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.20.20243782; this version posted January 25, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

into the sample tube. Second, an additional 1mL to 1.5mL of a sample-stabilizing liquid,
supplied by the manufacturer, must be added to the saliva in the sampling tube (the rationale
for this step is to preserve viral RNA integrity, and is discussed in detail in the next section).
The second step above; addition of sample-stabilizing liquid, adds problems that may adversely
affect the quality of downstream laboratory results. (i) Reliance on an untrained user to add the
secondary liquid introduces the potential for error. If missed, the quality of the sample and
therefore the integrity of the test result may be compromised due to viral RNA degradation in
transport. (ii) More problematic is the fact that the initial viral load in 1mL of collected saliva will
be diluted by the additional stabilizing liquid, reducing the detectability of samples with low viral
loads, increasing the potential to yield false negative results. (iii) The dilution problem will be
particularly acute when mass screenings for SARS-CoV-2 are extended to asymptomatic
individuals in schools, workplaces, and to travelers, many of whom may have low or very low
levels of virus in saliva. Dilution of these samples by adding a secondary liquid can cause low
positive samples to be missed. (iv) The issue of false negative results due to sample dilutive media
will also be a severe problem with the adoption of pooled testing, where multiple samples may be
combined with a low level positive in a pool, thereby impacting the Limit of Detection (LoD) of
the assay.

Assay Sensitivity and False Negative RT-PCR Test Results Due to viral RNA
Degradation
Unlike a DNA sample (such as from a human genome test), which is very stable and maintains
its molecular integrity under a variety of harsh conditions, RNA in saliva, which is RNAse-rich,
is notoriously unstable and easily degraded. This accounts for the wide variation in test results
reported in terms of high false negatives and LoD’s. To address this problem, assay protocols
typically incorporate two additional steps before starting the PCR reaction. (i) Immediately after
sample collection viral RNA stabilization media is added to ensure RNA integrity in the test
samples. (ii) An aliquot of the diluted specimen is withdrawn, and the RNA is then subjected to
an amplification process to ensure that sufficient quantities are available to serve as a PCR
reaction template.
These additional sample treatment steps automatically bring with them more possibilities for
error, potentially impacting the quality and accuracy of the test result. The ultimate solution is
to find a way to eliminate these steps, by directly adding the undiluted and non-pre-treated
saliva to the PCR reaction.

Non-Dilutive Saliva Transport Media, With Less Pre-Analytical Processing Steps
Two devices that address the limitations of saliva sample collection described above are GTRSTM and GTR-STMdk. They were developed by GenTegra LLC, a Pleasanton, Californiabased company focused on developing products for ambient temperature stabilization and
storage of RNA, DNA, proteins, and other biomolecules. The company’s Active Chemical
Protection™ (ACP) technology incorporates a proprietary combination of small molecule
inhibitors, cytotoxins, antioxidants, metal chelators, and anti-microbials to provide total
protection for viral RNA at ambient temperatures. Proprietary ACP chemistry reduces saliva
viscosity, inactivates contaminating RNases, and comprises ingredients that inactivate viruses
and bacteria. The formulation renders the sample safe for transportation and testing.
Furthermore, ACP is guanidinium-free, which makes it compatible with lab automation and selfsterilizing PCR instrumentation.
Both the GenTegra sample collection devices incorporate a non-dilutive dried media
formulation at the bottom of the collection tube that eliminates sample dilution when oral fluid
(saliva) is added by simply expectorating into the tube. The ionic and non-ionic denaturants in
GTR-STM and the enzymes in GTR-STMdk inactivate the virus by disrupting the lipid envelope
of the virus, rendering the saliva safe for transportation and testing. In order to further sterilize
the saliva samples, the saliva in both GTR-STM and GTR-STMdk can be heated at 95C for 15
minutes while still maintaining the integrity of the viral RNA for downstream RT-PCR analysis.
Unlike EUA-approved home saliva kits available on the market, no additional liquid medium need be
added to the saliva sample collected. The dried saliva transport medium in GTR-STM and GTRSTMdk dissolves upon contact with the saliva, thereby stabilizing the viral RNA. GTR-STM and
GTR-STMdk makes a more concentrated and more stable RNA sample available for PCR, likely
improving the assay LoD.
The distinct features and benefits of the two products are described below.

ready to process. They are then disinfected by heating at 95°C for 15 minutes in order to
further protect lab personnel. The next step is a crucial prerequisite for successful RT-PCR.
Aliquots (100 to 400 uL) of the sample are subjected to extraction using appropriate
commercially available reagents (process time = nearly one hour). Then, 3.75 to 5uL of the
extracted RNA sample is amplified in a total reaction volume of 10uL to 15uL of RT-PCR mix
(process time = nearly one hour) followed by analysis. The entire lab test process including
and up to recording of results in the system takes about four hours. (Note: the time from lab
workflow process to actual delivery of assay results to patients varies from lab to lab and may
take more than 24 hours after sample receipt.)
The workflow using GTR-STMdk is summarized in Figure 1, right side. Here, following saliva
collection at the lab, the samples are kept at ambient temperature for 60 minutes to enable
complete dissolution of the dried chemicals and activation of pre-dried Proteinase K (process
time = nearly one hour). The samples are then heated for 15 minutes at 95C (process time =
nearly 15 minutes). This step will kill any residual Proteinase K that could potentially interfere
with Taq polymerase during RT-PCR and simultaneously disinfect the samples to ensure lab
personnel safety. The samples are then cooled at 4C for five minutes before adding directly
into the RT-PCR reaction system for assay and analysis (process time = nearly one hour).
Since there is NO extraction and pre-amplification step, the entire process up to recording of
results in the system takes about three hours.

Results
CDC guidelines suggest using N1 and N2 primers for amplification in the RT-PCR assay for
SARS-CoV-2. We ran a comparative analysis of N1 and N2 primer data using SARS-CoV-2RNA spiked saliva and established by ANCOVA that the data obtained from either primer (N1
or N2) were statistically equivalent (Supplement S1). Therefore, due to cost and time
considerations, all studies reported in this paper (except Figure 6) were performed using only
the N1 primer from CDC.

CT of 32.4 CT (Std Dev, ±0.3), and Saliva Samples in GTR-STM gave a mean CT of 32.7 CT (Std Dev,
±0.2).
Study setup
Experimental Sample: A contrived GTR-STM sample (n=9) was prepared by spiking 1mL
of saliva with 2 genome equivalents/uL of -gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Control sample: A contrived non-GTR STM (“Saliva”) (n=3) sample was prepared by
spiking 1mL of saliva with 2 genome equivalents/uL of gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2
virus.
Sample Extraction: RNA was extracted from 200uL of sample from both control and
stressed samples following manufacturer’s instructions for MagMAX Viral RNA
(ThermoFisher) manual protocol and eluted with 50uL of elution buffer.
Quantification: Amplify 5uL of extracted RNA from each sample in triplicates with
TaqPath master mix (ThermoFisher) and CDC’s N1 Primer (IDT).

Saliva has a high concentration of RNase (24). When saliva samples containing SARS-CoV-2
are collected at home and shipped to the remote testing site, there is the likelihood that during
transport at ambient temperatures, the viral RNA could be degraded due to exposure to raw
saliva. However, the presence of proprietary ACP chemistry in GTR-STM protects and
stabilizes the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (Figure 3).

for 10 days. Matched spiked control saliva samples were stored at -80C. No viral RNA was extracted
from saliva without GTR-STM as the viral RNA is degraded immediately on spiking the saliva with
SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Saliva in GTR-STM spiked with viral RNA and stored for up to ten days at 25C,
yielded ~100% recovery (Figure 2, blue bars) compared to -80C control (Figure 2, maroon bars). The
pass/fail criteria for saliva in GTR-STM is 38.2 CT. Average CT for control (-80C) GTR-STM samples
spiked with SARS-CoV-2 RNA is 35.2 ±0.4 and 36.6±0.3 for GTR-STM saliva samples spiked with
SARS-CoV-2 RNA stressed at 25C.
Study setup
Experimental Sample: 1 mL of Saliva sample added to dry GTR-STM + 3.0 geq/uL of
SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (BEI Resources). The viral RNA-containing saliva sample was
incubated at 25C for up to 10 days.
Control sample: 1mL of RNAsecure water spiked with 3.0 geq/uL viral RNA and stored at
-80°C.
Sample Extraction: RNA was extracted from 100uL of experimental & control samples
with QIAamp Viral RNA kit and eluted with 100uL of elution buffer.
Quantification: 5uL of RNA was quantified with CDC’s SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay for
N1 primer.

The stability studies were further extended using heat-inactivated whole SARS-CoV-2 virus
(sourced from BEI resources) spiked into saliva in GTR-STM. When spiked into saliva with
GTR-STM, the heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus was stable for up to 36 days at 25C, and up
to seven days at 56C, prior to RNA extraction and RT-qPCR analysis (Figures 4 and 5).

Figure 4: Stability of Saliva-spiked heat inactivated SARS CoV-2 virus stored in GTR-STM
devices vs non-GTR-STM (“Saliva”) tubes at 25C. Heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA
(BEI Resources) at 500 genome equivalents/uL was spiked into 1mL of saliva kept either in GTRSTM collection devices or non-GTR-STM (“Saliva”) tubes, and stored at 25C for 36 days.
Matched spiked control saliva samples in both kinds of tubes were stored at -80C. The pass/fail
criteria are set at 32 CT value. 200uL of the sample is used at each time point to extract viral
RNA with the MagMAX kit with a final elution volume of 50uL. The CT value of the viral RNA
extracted with MagMAX viral RNA kit is normalized to input volume of 200uL (volume of sample
used for RNA extraction). All GTR-STM samples gave excellent recoveries when compared to
their matched -80C control. Both the -80C and the 25C samples for the non-GTR-STM
(“Saliva”) is above the pass/fail line even in the -80C control samples indicating that the viral
RNA is degraded by the Rnase in the short time (less than half hour) that the saliva sample is
defrosting before RNA extraction is performed.
Study setup
Experimental Samples: 1 mL aliquots of saliva contrived with SARS-CoV-2 at 500
genome equivalents/uL (BEI Resources) were placed into either GTR-STM devices or
non-GTR-STM (“Saliva”) tubes and stored at ambient (25C) for up to 36 days.

Control sample: 1 mL aliquots of saliva contrived with SARS-CoV-2 at 500 genome
equivalents/uL (BEI Resources) were placed into either GTR-STM devices or non-GTRSTM (“Saliva”) tubes and stored at -80C for up to 36 days.
Sample Extraction: RNA extracted from 200uL of experimental and control samples with
MagMAX viral RNA kit at days 10, 15, 20, 25, and 36 and eluted in 50uL of elution buffer.
Quantification: 5uL of RNA was quantified with CDC’s SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay for
N1 primer.

SARS-CoV-2 virus samples stored in GTR-STM retained original viral RNA integrity (CT levels
below the “Pass/Fail” level) for up to 36 days at ambient temperature, and the CTs values were
comparable to controls stored at -80C (Figure 4). In stark contrast, the samples stored in nonGTR-STM (“Saliva”) tubes did not meet the “Pass/Fail” CT level criterion at day 10 at ambient
or on subsequent days. The ambient stability difference between GTR-STM and non-GTRSTM (“Saliva”) samples was shown to be statistically significant by ANCOVA (Supplemental
Data, S2).
Surprisingly, under non-GTR-STM (“Saliva”) storage, even the -80C stored samples showed
inconsistent retention of CT levels below “Pass/Fail.” It is likely that in these frozen samples,
SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA degradation occurred even during the very short five-minute thaw at
4C prior to RT-PCR.
Figure 5 shows an accelerated stability study by storing samples at an elevated temperature of
56C.

at 56C and -80C, with all CT levels below the “Pass/Fail” criterion. This 56C stability for
seven days implies equivalent temperature stability at ambient (25C) for stored samples of
approximately 60 days, based on the Arrhenius equation for temperature dependence of
reaction rates. Regression analysis performed (t-statistic test, P<0.05, R-squared value 0.625)
based on the seven days data suggests that saliva containing SARS-CoV-2 virus collected in
GTR-STM potentially be extrapolated to show stability at ambient temperature more than 214
days (Supplemental Data, S3).
The stability data in Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate the utility of GTR-STM as a saliva sample
collection device in a home setting, allowing for sufficient time from collection,
shipping/transportation, and RT-PCR assay under highly variable temperature conditions.
Even though GTR-STM media contains components known to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, to
ensure an added measure of safety of lab personnel, incoming sample specimens must be
pre-heated at 95C for 15-30 minutes to inactivate any residual live SARS-Cov-2 that may be
present (25, 26). Figure 6 shows that SARS-CoV-2 viral-spiked saliva samples in GTR-STM
can be preheated at 95C for up to 30 minutes prior to RT-PCR without adversely affecting
assay sensitivity.

Figure 6: Effect of disinfection of gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 spiked saliva samples
collected in GTR-STM by preheating at 95C. Gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus (BEI
Resources) at 2,000 (i.) and 2.0 (ii.) genome equivalents/uL was spiked in 1mL of saliva kept in GTR-STM,
and heated at 95C for up to 30 minutes. Matched spiked control saliva samples were kept at ambient
temperature. The viral RNA was extracted with QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit and quantified with all three
CDC primers, N1, N2 and RNase P. The pass/fail criteria of 29.22 CT values for 2,000 genome
equivalent/uL and 40.74 CT values for 2.0 genome equivalents/uL were computed from the average of both
N1 and N2 primers only at ambient temperature and not for RNaseP.
Study setup
Experimental Samples: Saliva sample was contrived with 2,000 and 2.0 geq/uL gammairradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus per uL. 1mL each of contrived samples were added to GTRSTM, heated at 95C for up to 30 minutes.
Sample Extraction: RNA was extracted from 50uL of sample with QIAamp viral RNA kit
and eluted in 50uL of elution buffer.
Quantification: 5uL of RNA was quantified by CDC’s N1, N2 and Rnase P primer sets.

The data in Figure 6 showed that pre-heating of viral samples for 15 minutes or up to 30
minutes at 95C gave CT values that were consistent with ambient samples using CDC’s N1,
N2 or Rnase P primers for quantification. The N2 primer yielded higher CT values than N1.

Perhaps the N1 primer binds to a more stable section of the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and
therefore could be better suited to obtain greater sensitivity in RT-PCR testing for COVID-19.
All the above results (shown in Figures 2 - 6) clearly establish that GTR-STM is a valuable
home saliva sample collection device since it (i) retains SARS-CoV-2 activity for 36 days at
ambient temperature following sample collection and transportation to a testing lab, (ii) retains
SARS-CoV-2 activity for up to seven days at 56C, which translates to approximately 60 days
at ambient temperature, (iii) can withstand heating conditions up to 56C that may be
encountered perhaps unexpectedly at transit points during shipping, and (iv) maintains viral
RNA stability during disinfection by heating for up to 30 minutes at 95C.
GenTegra-Direct into PCR Media (GTR-STMdk) - For Lab Saliva/Sputum collection in
Clinical Diagnostics Laboratory Settings
While the GTR-STM device solves the problem of dilution described earlier, diagnosticians are
still left with the additional complication of the required extraction of viral RNA prior to PCR.
Eliminating this step would significantly lower reagent costs per test, while also improving
assay turnaround times, particularly when processing thousands of test samples. This second
complication has also been resolved successfully with an improved device, GTR-STMdk.
Based on feedback from CLIA-lab partners, the “direct-into-PCR” product GTR-STMdk,
eliminates the crucial 60 minute- pre-extraction and RNA amplification step. This is a
significant advance as it saves up to 25% of workflow process time and reduces the added
costs of non-PCR reagents. The key difference between GTR-STM and GTR-STMdk is the
addition of Proteinase K pre-dried along with the RNA stabilization chemistry. Proteinase K
degrades the viral coat, releasing the RNA and therefore eliminating the need of pre-extraction
for RNA amplification.
The following experiments were performed with gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus spiked
saliva samples kept in GTR-STMdk, where the focus was to push the COVID-19 testing
envelope in terms of improving process workflow and reagent cost efficiencies and increased
sensitivity of SAR-CoV-2 detection. All experiments were conducted with clinically realistic low
levels of SARS-CoV-2 spiked into saliva of 0.4 geq/uL and 2.0 geq/uL.
Figure 7 demonstrates the effect of sample and reaction volumes on RT-PCR data using GTRSTMdk, an important consideration pointed out by CLIA lab partners. Since reagents account
for one third of lab test costs, any reduction in total reaction volume used during the RT-PCR
step, particularly when millions of samples are assayed, would yield substantial cost savings in

Figure 7: GTR-STMdk Sample Volume Titration in RT-PCR. 500uL of saliva spiked with
2.0 geq/uL of gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus added to GTR-STMdk was incubated at 56C for 5
minutes followed by 95C for 5 minutes. Direct into PCR was performed with 3.75uL to 5.0uL of GTRSTMdk sample added to 10uL to 15uL of mastermix and amplified with CDC’s N1 primer. The pass/fail
criteria set to Matched Extracted RNA samples at 37.2 CT.
Study setup
500uL of saliva contrived with gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus, 2 geq /uL, was
added to GTR-STMdk device. Six replicates each with; (i) 5uL of sample to 10uL of
TaqPath RT-PCR master mix, (ii) 3.75uL of sample to 10uL of master mix, (iii) 5uL of
sample to 15uL of master mix (ThermoFisher volume).
Experimental Samples were added directly into the RT-PCR assay after first heating for
five minutes at 56C, followed by 15 minutes at 95C, and then cooling for 5 minutes at
4C (“Direct into PCR” in Figure 8).
Control Samples were extracted with QIAamp viral RNA kit from 100uL of saliva sample.
The extracted RNA was eluted in 100uL of Elution Buffer (CT, STMdk Extracted), then
subjected to RT-PCR (‘Matched Extracted RNA” in Figure 7)
Quantification: 3.75uL to 5uL of RNA was quantified with CDC’s SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR
assay for N1 primer.

The results show that similar CT values were obtained using a total RT-PCR volume of
13.75uL comprising 3.75uL test sample and 10uL of reagent master mix versus 20uL
comprising 5uL test sample versus 15uL reagent master mix. Thus, potential savings in
reagent costs of up to 30% could be realized using GTR-STMdk.
The practical utility of the GTR-STMdk device was further explored to account for variable
volumes of saliva samples collected on site. COVID-19 patients may experience difficulties in
generating sufficient saliva volumes due to their weakened condition. Figure 8 shows RT-PCR
data in which contrived saliva sample volumes of 50uL, 100uL, 500uL and 1,000uL were
placed inside GTR-STMdk devices.

Figure 8: Saliva Volume Titration in GTR-STMdk. Various volumes (50uL to 1 mL) of saliva,
spiked with gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus (BEI Resources) at 0.4 genome equivalents/uL (Right
Panel) or 2.0 genome equivalents/uL (Left Panel), were kept in GTR-STMdk before direct RT-PCR
assay. The pass/fail criteria are set to the QIAamp extracted STMdk control samples for 2.0 geq/uL

Various volumes, 50uL, 100uL, 500uL and 1,000uL of Contrived Saliva at 0.4 geq/uL and
2.0 geq/uL of gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 (BEI Resources) added to STMdk devices.
Experimental Samples were heated for 5 minutes at 56C, then heated for 5 minutes at
95C, cooled for 5 minutes at 4C, then subjected to direct RT-PCR.
Control Samples were extracted with QIAamp viral RNA kit from 100uL of saliva sample.
The extracted RNA was eluted in 100uL of Elution Buffer (CT, STMdk Extracted).

Quantification: 5uL of RNA was quantified with CDC’s SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay for
N1 primer.

At both the low and high doses of SARS-CoV-2, samples at all saliva volumes tested gave CT
values below the “Pass/Fail” criterion. Therefore, the GTR-STMdk device would be suitable for
use with saliva sample volumes as low as 50uL and as high as 1mL.
Also, compared to the samples in Figure 7, the direct to PCR samples in Figure 8 were
heated for 15 minutes at 95C without first being heated at 56C for five minutes. The
elimination of the 56C step had no impact on CT “Pass/Fail” results at both SARS-CoV-2 virus
levels - 0.4 geq/uL and 2.0 geq/uL.
As shown in the process workflow chart in the Introduction in Figure 1, in a typical clinical lab
situation, so long as the saliva samples in GTR-STMdk are kept at ambient temperature for
one hour before processing, only the 95C heating step would be required. The 56C step may
be needed in a point of care diagnostic situation when saliva is collected and processed
immediately.
Figure 9 shows RT-PCR data of saliva samples spiked with gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 at
0.4 geq/uL (Panel A) and 2 geq/uL (Panel B) in the direct-to-PCR GTR-STMdk device, with NO
pre-extraction or -amplification. The samples were further assayed on days 1, 2 and 3 following
storage at ambient temperature.

Experimental Sample: 500uL of Contrived Saliva at 0.4 geq/uL and 2.0 geq/uLof gammairradiated SARS-CoV-2 (BEI Resources) added to STMdk devices. They were stored at
4C and 25C.
Control Sample: Two controls were set up in this experiment. One for direct into PCR
was placed at 4C in order to keep the Proteinase K active under ideal conditions and
another set of controls for determining the amount of viral RNA that is to be expected for
the direct into PCR sample. The later was determined by extraction of the viral RNA from
this sample with QIAamp viral RNA kit (true control). Controls are 500uL of Contrived
Saliva at 0.4 geq/uL and 2.0 geq/uL of SARS-CoV-2 (BEI Resources) added to STMdk
devices. QIAamp extraction of viral RNA was from 100uL of -80C control saliva samples
and eluted with 100uL of elution buffer.
Sample Treatment: 50uL aliquots from each experimental and control sample were
withdrawn on days 1, 2 and 3, heated for 15 minutes at 95C, cooled for 5 minutes at
4C, then subjected to RT-PCR
Quantification: 5uL of RNA was quantified with CDC’s SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay for
N1 primer.

At both the low and high doses of SARS-CoV-2, all samples gave CT values below the
“Pass/Fail” criterion up to three days. Saliva samples contrived with heat inactivated or
gamma-irradiated virus kept in GTR-STMdk beyond three days at 25C had CT values above
the “Pass/Fail” threshold.
Independent studies by an external collaborator with SARS-CoV-2 infected clinical samples
from COVID-19 patients collected in GTR-STMdk have demonstrated stability of the SARSCoV-2 viral RNA for up to nine days at 4C (data not shown). Therefore, the GTR-STMdk
device is ideally suited for sample collection at testing sites, such as clinical labs, where the
device can be quickly refrigerated following saliva sample collection.

Discussion and Concluding Remarks
Many countries, including US, are still in the grips of the COVID-19 pandemic while other
countries are experiencing a resurgence or a potential second wave. Mass screening for the
presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the general population has become an imperative. GTR-STM and
GTR-STMdk provide essential technological advances in COVID-19 testing, by enhancing the
ease of sample collection, increasing assay sensitivity, improving safety and facilitating lab
workflow while enabling lower costs and faster turnaround times.
Saliva sampling is a safer, more convenient and practical alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs.
GenTegra has been on the forefront of developing dried-media sample collection devices for a
variety of testing applications, and this technology has been logically extended to develop two
non-dilutive saliva collection products, GenTegra GTR-STM and GTR-STMdk. GenTegra’s
proprietary Active Chemical Protection chemistry is particularly applicable to SARs-CoV-2 PCR
assays where prevention of RNA degradation and preservation of stability during transport
from sample collection to lab test sites is essential to ensuring high test accuracy and
sensitivity.
GTR-STM, while a simple device, has the following attributes: (i) direct collection of saliva by
expectoration into a tube containing dried stabilizers to avoid sample dilution, (ii) use of
stabilizers that are generally known to inactivate infectious virus, and (iii) SARS-CoV-2 stability
for up to 60 days at ambient temperature. At the test site, the viral RNA in the sample would
need to be extracted and amplified before PCR analysis. Due to its ability to retain viral RNA
stability for several weeks at ambient temperature, GTR-STM would be ideally suited for
home-based sample collection after which the sample containing devices may be
shipped and transported worldwide at temperatures up to 56C to authorized CLIA labs..
GTR-STMdk incorporates Proteinase K into the saliva sample collection device itself,
eliminating the Proteinase K addition step at the testing site, which reduces potential avenues
for error. In addition, the sample can be directly subjected to RT-PCR without the need for
RNA pre-amplification. The benefit of NOT requiring RNA extraction and amplification at the
test site provides a substantial improvement to throughput by reducing test turnaround times.
In SARS-CoV-2 spiked saliva samples collected in GTR-STMdk, virus levels down to 0.4
geq/uL can be detected using as little as 3.75uL of sample volume and 30% less quantity of
expensive PCR assay reagents. The device is also effective with saliva collection volumes as
low as 0.05 mL, minimizing difficulty for patients struggling to provide a usable sample when
under stress. GTR-STMdk is ideally suited for sample collection at locations proximal to

the testing site as it requires sample storage at 4C. Storage of GTR-STMdk saliva samples
at the testing site at 4C extends stability up to nine days (confidential personal communication

In this report, the saliva used was from a commercially available source. Studies are in
progress in GenTegra labs as well in collaboration with CLIA lab partners to confirm these data
using individual human saliva samples. We have provided a conservative estimate for assay
sensitivity, pending a more formal determination of test Limit of Detection (LoD) for samples
collected in GTR-STM and GTR-STMdk.
The switch to dry chemical saliva sample collection devices GTR-STM and GTR-STMdk, can
achieve significant improvements in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing throughput efficiencies.
Saliva sampling with GTR devices also greatly enhances patient convenience, safety, reduces
testing costs and reporting times for test results. The enhancement to accuracy, sensitivity and
PCR assay turnaround times using GTR devices can greatly expand the number of
asymptomatic individuals that can be tested on a regular basis while facilitating testing on
pooled samples. The numerous sample testing advances provided by GTR devices are
essential to support COVID-19 testing for all, with the ultimate critical goal to better control the
ongoing pandemic until a safe and efficacious viral vaccine and therapies becomes widely
available.

Materials and Methods
Study setup for each set of experiments is given in the respective legend below each Figure.
Neat saliva samples were prepared by contriving commercially purchased saliva, (Lee
BioSolutions, cat #991-05-P-250) with SARS-CoV-2 virus to the desired concentration. Heatinactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus (BEI Resources, cat #NR-52286) at 1.12e^6 geq/uL and
gamma-irradiated virus (BEI Resources, cat #NR-52287) at 1.7e^6 geq/uL. Unless otherwise
stated in the respective Figure, a total of 1000 uL of contrived saliva was added to GTR-STM
tubes and 500 uL of contrived saliva was added to GTR-STMdk tubes. GTR-STM tubes were
gently mixed at room temperature for 5 minutes or until the pellet had gone completely into
solution. GTR-STMdk tubes were allowed sit for 1 hour at room temperature.
GTR-STM was tested by extraction with either QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, cat
#52906) or MagMAX Viral RNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher, cat #AM1939) and compared with
either PBS or neat saliva as controls. Samples extracted with QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit
always contained either 50 or 100 uL of sample volume and were normalized by eluting in
either 50 or 100 uL of elution buffer, depending on the sample volume. Samples extracted with
MagMAX Viral RNA Isolation Kit followed a modified protocol and always contained 200 uL of
sample volume and were eluted in 50 uL of elution buffer. The eluted viral RNA was then
quantified with RT-qPCR (see below).
Two different heating methods were tested with contrived saliva in GTR-STMdk. First, samples
were heated at 56C for 5 minutes, before being heated at 95C for 5 minutes. The second
method tested was heating at 95C for 15 minutes to deactivate the Proteinase K in the
solution. The second method was sufficient in deactivating the Proteinase K before RT-qPCR
and provided similar results to the first method, so the 56C for 5 minutes step was removed.
Viral RNA samples from contrived saliva in GTR-STM and contrived saliva in GTR-STMdk
were both quantified with RT-qPCR using a StepOnePlus™ Real Time PCR System
(ThermoFisher Scientific). Samples were prepared, according to the CDC 2019-Novel
Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, by mixing 5 uL of viral RNA
with 3.5 or 5 uL of TaqPath™ 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG (ThermoFisher, cat #A15299),
8.5 uL of HyPure™ Molecular Biology Grade Water (HyClone™, cat #SH30538.03), and 1.5 uL
of CDC combined primer/probe mix (Integrated DNA Technologies, cat #10006713). CDC
primer/probe mix includes N1, N2, and RNASEP. Samples were plated in triplicates into a 96-

at 2 minutes, and 45 cycles of 95C at 3 seconds and 55C at 30 seconds.
Criteria for determination of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in RT-PCR Assay: Based on FDA
guidance, samples were considered positive if the CT value was less than the “Pass/Fail”
criterion of Mean CT + 3CT, and negative if above the “Pass/Fail” criterion.
