Abstract
Public health preparedness for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is challenging in the
absence of setting-specific epidemiological data. Here we describe the epidemiology of
seasonal human coronaviruses (sCoVs) and other cocirculating viruses in the West of Scotland,
UK. We analyzed routine diagnostic data for >70,000 episodes of respiratory illness tested
molecularly for multiple respiratory viruses between 2005 and 2017. Statistical associations with
patient age and sex differed between CoV-229E, CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63. Furthermore, the
timing and magnitude of sCoV outbreaks did not occur concurrently and coinfections were not
reported. With respect to other cocirculating respiratory viruses, we found evidence of positive,
rather than negative, interactions with sCoVs. These findings highlight the importance of
considering cocirculating viruses in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19. Further work is
needed to establish the occurrence/degree of cross-protective immunity conferred across
sCoVs and with COVID-19, as well as the role of viral coinfection in COVID-19 disease severity.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, Acute respiratory infections, Disease surveillance, Coinfection, Virusvirus interactions

Introduction
In March 2020, the WHO declared the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
caused by a human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) which emerged in China in December 2019, a
pandemic [1]. Predicting the public health impact of pathogens with recently acquired human-tohuman transmissibility is a challenge. Currently, the fate of COVID-19 remains unclear;
understanding the likely age and seasonal profiles of infection risks will be critical to inform
effective surveillance and control strategies.

During the early phase of an outbreak, in the absence of detailed country-specific knowledge,
preliminary risk estimates may be gauged from endemic pathogens with similar modes of
transmission. The infection incidence and levels of severe illness associated with COVID-19
remains unclear. In this instance, epidemiological data on seasonal human coronaviruses
(sCoVs) may provide valuable information about individuals and seasonal conditions favored by
an invading coronavirus.
To date, emergent zoonotic human coronaviruses associated with high case-fatality ratios have
not achieved persistence in the human population. Severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and spread rapidly around the globe before being
successfully contained in 2003 [2]. Conversely, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(MERS-CoV) has continued to cause sporadic cases predominantly in healthcare settings since
its discovery in 2012, but has not demonstrated sustained community transmission [3]. In
contrast, CoV-229E, CoV-NL63, CoV-OC43 and CoV-HKU1 are common cocirculating sCoVs
predominantly associated with mild infection of the upper respiratory tract [4].
A key determinant governing the invasion and persistence success of a new pathogen is the
abundance of susceptible hosts. Such population susceptibility may be difficult to define due to
pre-existing cross-protective immunity in individuals previously exposed to antigenically related
pathogens, as demonstrated for pandemic influenza A H1N1 in 2009 [5]. Furthermore, the
potential for heterologous interactions among taxonomically broad groups of respiratory viruses
is also recognized [6-11]. A good epidemiological understanding of cocirculating viruses will
provide valuable information on the potential for immune, or otherwise mediated, virus-virus
interactions and consequences for population susceptibility.
To date, epidemiological knowledge surrounding sCoVs has been limited for many settings
owing to their historic association with mild illness. However, some laboratories have adopted

sCoV testing as part of routine multiplex diagnostic screens [12-15], following an increased
recognition of the associated disease spectrum. We previously reported on the comparative
epidemiologies of acute viral respiratory infections, and the potential for virus-virus interactions,
based on multiplex RT-PCR testing in the West of Scotland [6, 16]. Here we provide further
detail on sCoVs differentiated at the species level (sCoV types) over an extended timeframe
and discuss key potential implications for COVID-19 virus emergence in Scotland, United
Kingdom (UK).
Methods
The study population
Routine molecular testing for CoV-229E, CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63 using multiplex real-time
RT-PCR methods was conducted between 1st January 2005 and 30th September 2017 by the
West of Scotland Specialist Virology Centre (WoSSVC) in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde,
the largest Scottish Health Board serving a population of ~1.2 million [17]. The respiratory virus
screen also simultaneously detected influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial
virus, human adenoviruses, human rhinoviruses, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza
virus types 1-4. The CoV-HKU1 assay was discontinued in 2012 due to low levels of detection.
Most clinical specimens (91%) were obtained from the upper respiratory tract (the majority
being nasal and/or throat swabs).
During the study period, 107,174 clinical respiratory samples, from 64,948 individual patients,
were received by WoSSVC for testing. For patients with two or more samples submitted (24.5%
of patients), the PCR test data were aggregated into individual episodes defined as a 30-day
period from the collection date of the first sample. This generated 84,957 episodes of
respiratory illness for analysis. Most episodes, 93% out with the three major waves of pandemic

influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus circulation in the UK (summer 2009, influenza seasons of
2009/10 and 2010/11), were tested for all eleven groups of respiratory virus. Of 84,957
episodes of respiratory illness, 10,438 were not tested for coronavirus (98% during the three
major waves of pandemic influenza) and thus were excluded from analyses centered on sCoVs
[18]. Among the remaining 74,519 episodes of illness, a further 278 were either tested for CoVHKU1 or the coronavirus was untyped; these episodes were excluded from analyses
differentiating sCoV type. See Figure 1 for a summary of the data subsets.
Statistical modelling analyses
Of 74,241 patient episodes of respiratory illness with sCoV subtyping, 8,912 patients
experienced multiple episodes over the study timeframe. In such cases, we retained the first
observed episode to remove patient-level clustering, leaving 56,276 patient observations for
analysis (Figure 1). We used multivariable logistic regression to investigate associations
between each sCoV type (CoV-229E, CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63) and patient age (categorical),
sex (binary), healthcare service (binary), time period with respect to the three major waves of
pandemic influenza in the UK (categorical; pre-pandemic: January 2005 – April 2009,
pandemic: May 2009 – February 2011, post-pandemic: March 2011 – September 2017) and
season (categorical). Statistical interactions between patient covariates and healthcare service
were assessed. An alpha level of 5% was used to determine statistical significance of all model
coefficients. The fitted models, incorporating age-healthcare service interactions were used to
generate average predicted probabilities of virus detection by age and healthcare setting.
In addition, we used multivariable logistic regression to investigate interactions between each
sCoV and other groups of respiratory viruses at the within-host scale. These analyses were
based on 16,991 virus-positive episodes of respiratory illness, retaining the first observed
episode of illness for patients with multiple episodes. Virus-negative patients were excluded to

eliminate the influence of Berkson’s bias, which may lead to spurious inference of diseasedisease associations when estimated from routine healthcare data [19]. Specifically, these
analyses tested whether the odds of a given virus (‘exposed’) coinfecting with a given sCoV
differed from the average odds among the remaining groups of viruses (‘non-exposed’), thereby
assessing non-random mixing among the virus population.
Three models were fitted, one for each of CoV-229E, CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63 (response
variables). The analyses adjusted for patient age, sex, primary or secondary/tertiary healthcare
service, time period with respect to pandemic influenza (as above), and the monthly
background prevalence of the sCoV (response variable) to eliminate spurious virus-virus
associations owing to unrelated sources of seasonality. Holm’s method was used to correct pvalues for multiple comparisons (ten virus-virus interaction hypotheses per model).
All analyses were conducted in R software version 3.4.4 [20]. Logistic regression modelling was
conducted using the ‘glm’ function and predicted probabilities were computed using ‘ggaverage’
from the ‘ggeffects’ package [21].
Results
How common are seasonal coronaviruses among people with respiratory illness?
Among 84,957 episodes of respiratory illness, 79.0% were sampled at secondary/tertiary
healthcare services (hospital inpatients and outpatients), and 21.0% from primary healthcare
services (general practice [GP]). The sex distribution was approximately equal, with 51.6% of
patients’ female, and the median age was 33.1y (IQR; 1st quartile - 3rd quartile=5.6y-59.1y).
Seasonal coronaviruses (sCoVs) were detected in 4.0% (2,958/74,519) of tested patients
overall, contributing to 10.7% (2,958/27,734) of all respiratory virus detections. Figure 2
summarizes the contribution of sCoVs to the total viral detections in the patient population

during each influenza season (October – May) from 2005 to 2016. The most common virus
detections overall among virus-positive patients were influenza (range: 13.4% to 34.0%,
excluding pandemic influenza waves of 2009/10 and 2010/11) and RSV (range: 10.1% to
21.9%) followed by sCoVs (range: 7.7% to 17.4%) (Figure 2).
Numbers of sCoV detections increased post pandemic influenza (March 2011 – September
2017) likely owing to enhanced virological testing of acute respiratory illnesses; overall numbers
of sCoV detections rose from 545 pre-pandemic to 2072 post-pandemic. However, a decrease
in prevalence among the tested population was observed, from 4.27% to 3.70%, and with
varying patterns at the individual sCoV level (supplementary Table S1). The most prevalent
detection was CoV-OC43, both pre- and post-pandemic (supplementary Table S1). CoV-HKU1
was present at a very low prevalence of 0.3% overall (124 out of 36,652 episodes tested until
the assay was discontinued in 2012) and was therefore excluded from further analyses.
In whom are seasonal coronaviruses most frequently detected?
Despite a greater number of sCoV detections among patients admitted to hospital, the
prevalence among those tested was greater among patients attending GP’s (5.3%; 673/12,670)
than hospitals (3.7%; 2,285/61,849). Figure 3 summarizes age distributions. Cases of sCoV in
children under five and the elderly were disproportionately represented among patients
admitted to hospital, compared to a more uniform distribution among GP attendees, closely
following the overall tested population (Figure 3A). A different sex bias was found among adults
depending on the healthcare setting; more female cases (primary care) versus males
(secondary/tertiary care) (Figure 3B). This pattern was consistent when comparing % detections
among positive patients across sCoV types: 59.2% (CoV-229E), 55.6% (CoV-OC43) and 59.8%
(CoV-NL63) of cases detected in primary care were female, whilst 54.7% (CoV-229E), 51.1%

(CoV-OC43) and 56.7% (CoV-NL63) cases detected in secondary/tertiary care were male
(supplementary Table S2).
The median age varied from 20.9y (IQR=2.7y-50.2y) for CoV-NL63, to 39.9y (IQR=5.0y-62.5y)
and 43.3y (IQR=16.5y-60.4y) for CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E, respectively. The age-specific
prevalences of sCoVs among the tested population are summarized in supplementary Tables
S3-S4; a greater variation across ages was found for CoV-229E (Coefficient of Variation
[CV]=40.4%) and CoV-NL63 (CV=33.8%) compared to CoV-OC43 (CV=13.6%) for primary
care, with less variation for secondary/tertiary care (CV=29.96% for CoV-229E and CV=28.0%
for CoV-NL63, compared to CV=17.10% for CoV-OC43).
Statistical modelling analyses further confirmed differences in age and sex associations
according to sCoV type, and a greater chance of sCoV detection among GP attendees than
patients admitted to hospital (supplementary Tables S5-S7). No evidence of significant effect
modification between patient age or sex and healthcare service setting was found (statistical
interaction terms p>0.05; results not shown). Figure 4 summarizes average age-specific
predicted probabilities with statistical interactions incorporated. In summary, we observed a
trend towards increasing probability of CoV-229E with age (Figure 4A), greater probabilities of
CoV-OC43 at the extremities of age (Figure 4B), and decreasing probability of CoV-NL63 with
age (Figure 4C). These age patterns were broadly consistent across patient sex and healthcare
settings; although we note that 95% confidence intervals overlapped across all ages except for
the hospital setting. A borderline significant sex effect was found for CoV-229E, with detections
more likely among males (supplementary Table S5).

Do seasonal coronaviruses exhibit similar seasonalities?
Figure 5 shows the monthly prevalences of sCoVs detected among the patient population.
These are winter pathogens in the UK, on average peaking between January and March.
However, there were notable variations between sCoV types and between years. Overall, CoVOC43 was the most prevalent detection among the tested population in each influenza season.
Differences were also observed in periodicities; prior to the first wave of pandemic influenza in
2009, CoV-229E peaked biennially, but subsequently exhibited longer inter-peak periods,
particularly between 2013 and 2016.
In contrast, CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63 generally exhibit annual periodicity of varying magnitude.
A considerable degree of synchrony is observed in the timing of the peak prevalence of CoVOC43 and CoV-NL63 for most seasons, whereas CoV-229E was more distinctive in its temporal
pattern. For example, low levels of CoV-229E in 2007 coincided with high magnitudes of CoVOC43 and CoV-NL63, whilst the largest prevalence of CoV-229E in 2010 coincided with low
magnitudes of CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63.
Do coronaviruses interact with other respiratory viruses?
The cocirculation of sCoVs with other common respiratory raises the potential for ecological
interactions, altering infection risks and the dynamics of population transmission. Our data did
not permit analysis of potential within-host interactions among different sCoVs because of an
absence of sCoV coinfections. We did, however, evaluate the potential for within-host
interactions between sCoVs and other common respiratory viruses.
To do so, we analyzed the non-random mixing of respiratory viruses among virus-positive
patients using multivariable logistic regression. We found a greater propensity for CoV-OC43 to
coinfect with RSV (OR=1.68, 95% CI=1.05-2.63, uncorrected p=0.027), AdV (OR=2.93, 95%

CI=1.87-4.5, uncorrected p<0.001), and PIV3 (OR=2.38, 95% CI=1.28-4.17, uncorrected
p=0.004) (supplementary Table S8). The associations with AdV and PIV3 were supported
following correction of p-values for multiple comparisons (p<0.001 and p=0.036 respectively).
No evidence of interactions with other respiratory viruses was found for either CoV-229E or
CoV-NL63. Assessment of parainfluenza virus (PIV) types was limited by small numbers of
coinfections; these viruses were aggregated at the genus level for the CoV-229E analysis, and
PIV2 was excluded from the CoV-NL63 analysis. See supplementary Tables S9-S10 for details.
The finding for PIVB must be treated with caution owing to 95% CI overlapping 1. Average agespecific predicted probabilities of sCoV coinfection for individuals with and without coinfection
with each specific respiratory virus is given in Table 1.
Discussion: Implications for COVID-19
The likely long-term impact of the recently emerged COVID-19 is a topic currently shrouded in
uncertainty for countries worldwide. At the time of writing, global cases are mounting, with
evidence of community transmission for a growing number of countries. In the absence of
setting-specific data, an epidemiological understanding of related and unrelated co-circulating
pathogens is prudent to guide preliminary estimates of who is at risk and when, and to develop
research priorities pertaining to population susceptibility. Epidemiological knowledge of
seasonal human coronaviruses (sCoVs) is lacking for many settings due to an absence of
inclusion in routine diagnostic testing. Here, we described several key features of sCoVs based
on a unique dataset derived from multiplex PCR diagnostic testing of a large, well-defined
population over a thirteen year period.
It is well known that sCoVs cocirculate endemically with other common respiratory viruses, and
coinfections are frequently observed [11, 12, 16]. In the West of Scotland, sCoVs typically peak

in winter months alongside influenza viruses and RSV, as previously described [12]. The
common occurrence of sCoVs during periods of high influenza activity highlights the importance
of considering these viruses in the differential diagnosis of viral respiratory infections. This is
particularly pertinent in the context of COVID-19 emergence; cocirculating viruses are
associated with a broad spectrum of clinical presentation overlapping that of COVID-19, raising
the potential for a large number of undiagnosed or misclassified cases in settings lacking the
capacity for multiplexed testing. Currently in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Scotland, the
majority of COVID-19 testing is being conducted in the hospital setting, where all cases of
respiratory illness are simultaneously tested for influenza, RSV, adenovirus and mycoplasma
pneumoniae using a multiplex panel, and severely ill patients receive a full multiplex that
includes sCoVs.
Sex-specific numbers of sCoV differed by healthcare setting; we observed a trend towards
female sCoV cases for primary care, but male sCoV cases for secondary/tertiary care. This
finding may reflect sex differences in healthcare seeking behaviors and/or illness severity. In
terms of sex differences in detection odds (a proxy for infection risk), a statistically significant
sex effect was found for CoV-229E, with a greater odds among males than females. This
finding is consistent with previous reports of a male bias for CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63 among
the hospital setting [12], and in relation to influenza hospitalizations and mortality in the context
of acute respiratory infections more generally [22, 23]. It has been proposed that differences in
sex hormones may explain variation in respiratory infection susceptibility, with testosterone
exerting an immunosuppressive effect in males, and with estrogen playing a protective role in
females [24, 25]. We note however our analyses do not control for potential confounding factors
such as smoking or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

A greater number of sCoV cases were observed in children under five years of age and the
elderly, particularly among patients admitted to hospital. This pattern is consistent with overall
testing trends, and may therefore reflect the healthcare seeking behavior of concerned parents,
clinician testing practices, and/or the burden of other respiratory agents, rather than a greater
risk of infection. However, it should be borne in mind that these analyses were based on a
patient population; the true community burden of mild and/or asymptomatic infections is likely to
be much higher [26]. When aggregated into epidemiological groupings, age-specific
probabilities of virus detection varied across sCoV types.
In contrast to that observed for sCoVs, there are relatively few COVID-19 cases thus far in
children [27]. In the context of our study population, COVID-19 is closely related to CoV-OC43
(both betacoronaviruses), the most prevalent sCoV detection among patients under five. It is
possible that pre-existing cross-immunity confers protection and/or attenuates the severity of
COVID-19 leading to fewer tested/hospitalized children. The comparatively lower proportion
positive and detection odds for school-aged children compared to younger children may
potentially reflect a sustained level of CoV-OC43 immune-mediated protection, whereas waned
immunity is expected to leave adults more vulnerable to coronavirus infections [27]. Assuming
some degree of cross-immunity with COVID-19, our data are consistent with an expected fewer
cases of COVID-19 in children but more cases among the adult population. Immunosenescence
may exacerbate low levels of protective immunity in the elderly [29, 30].
Three key features of our data seemingly support the proposition of cross-immunity. Firstly, the
contrasting age patterns of detection probabilities between closely related CoV-229E and CoVNL63 (both alphacoronaviruses) may reflect niche segregation. Secondly, closely related CoV229E and CoV-NL63 also displayed asynchronous seasonality, in contrast to CoV-OC43 and
CoV-NL63, supporting a competition dynamic. Although our data did not permit in depth

analysis of CoV-HKU1, others have reported differences in the timing of peak detections with
CoV-OC43 (both betacoronaviruses) [12]. Thirdly, coinfections among sCoVs were not
recorded in this study population, although detected by others albeit at a very low frequency
[12]. More work is needed to establish whether low coinfection frequency among sCoVs
supports an immune-mediated competition for hosts, or whether this reflects a limitation of
diagnostic data which only captures a snapshot of an individual’s infection.
To our knowledge, evidence of immunological cross-protection between human coronaviruses
is lacking, and reports of antigenic cross-reactivity are inconsistent. The potential for serological
cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and sCoVs has been shown by some [28, 29] but not
others [30]. And although confinement of cross-reactivity at the coronavirus genus level is
possible, consistent with the greater genetic relatedness of these viruses [31, 32], more general
cross-reactivity between CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E has also been found [33]. Population
serological surveys will be critical for establishing the true burden and age distribution of sCoV
infections in the community and the potential for cross-protective immunity.
It should be borne in mind that the implications of population levels of cross-immunity are likely
to vary according to the local epidemiological context. We note the predominance of CoV-OC43
detections previously observed in a comparatively urban but different Scottish patient
population [14], a pattern more generally consistent at the Scottish national level [27]. Other
trends observed within our study population are consistent with the Scottish national level, such
as peak levels of CoV-229E detection in 2010 coinciding with low levels of CoV-NL63 and CoVOC43 [27]. A predominance of CoV-OC43 has also been observed in Sweden [16], suggesting
a potential consistency in sCoV dominance over wider geographical areas. However,
differences are also apparent; for example, the relatively common detection of CoV-HKU1 in a

different Scottish population [14] in contrast to ours, as also suggested in a recent report on
respiratory virus detections in France [28].
Our study also highlights the potential for interactions between sCoVs and other respiratory
viruses. In previous extensive analyses of virus-virus interactions, we found a strong signal of
positive interactions at the within-host scale between human coronaviruses overall and
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (AdV) and parainfluenza viruses (combining types
1 and 3; human respirovirus genus) [6]. Here, our more in-depth analysis corroborates positive
interactions at the sCoV type level. For CoV-OC43, the most prevalent in this study population,
our results support our earlier findings of a higher propensity of coinfection with RSV, AdV and
PIV3 than with other respiratory viruses. Note, these analyses were based on routine diagnostic
testing and therefore the directionality of effects could not be determined. The association with
RSV was not supported following a correction for multiple comparisons, although previous
studies also report a high proportion of sCoV coinfections with RSV [12, 34]. The role of viral
coinfections in the severity of acute respiratory illness remains a controversial topic [28-32].
Further work is needed to establish the role of viral coinfections in COVID-19 severity.
Conclusions
The public health impact of COVID-19 is likely to vary according to the epidemiological context
and healthcare infrastructure of the population. Our findings suggest continued monitoring of
cocirculating respiratory viruses will be important for guiding accurate case ascertainment,
research priorities surrounding population susceptibility, and for assessing the comparative
population and healthcare burden of COVID-19 in the context of multiple cocirculating
respiratory pathogens. Further work is needed to identify the mechanism of interactions
between human coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses, and the role of viral coinfections in
COVID-19 severity and burden.
