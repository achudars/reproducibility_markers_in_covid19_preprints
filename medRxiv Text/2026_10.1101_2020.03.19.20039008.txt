ABSTRACT
Background: To identify safe and effective medical countermeasures (e.g.,
antivirals/antibodies) to address the current outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19)
Methods: Comprehensive literature searches were developed by an experienced librarian for
MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and biorxiv.org/medrxiv.org; additional searches for
ongoing trials and unpublished studies were conducted in clinicaltrials.gov and the Global
Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON). Title/abstract and full-text screening,
data abstraction, and risk of bias appraisal were carried out by single reviewers.
Results: 54 studies were included in the review: three controlled trials, 10 cohort studies, seven
retrospective medical record/database studies, and 34 case reports or series. These studies
included patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARs, n=33), middle east respiratory
syndrome (MERS, n=16), COVID-19 (n=3), and unspecified coronavirus (n=2). The most
common treatment was ribavirin (n=41), followed by oseltamivir (n=10) and the combination of
lopinavir/ritonavir (n=7). Additional therapies included broad spectrum antibiotics (n=30),
steroids (n=39) or various interferons (n=12). No eligible studies examining monoclonal
antibodies for COVID-19 were identified. One trial found that ribavirin prophylactic treatment
statistically significantly reduced risk of MERS infection in people who had been exposed to the
virus. Of the 21 studies reporting rates of ICU admission in hospitalized SARS or MERS
patients, none reported statistically significant results in favour of or against antiviral therapies.
Of the 40 studies reporting mortality rates in hospitalized SARS or MERS patients, one cohort
study (MERS) and one retrospective study (SARS) found a statistically significant increase in
the mortality rate for patients treated with ribavirin. Eighteen studies reported potential drugrelated adverse effects including gastrointestinal symptoms, anemia, and altered liver function in
patients receiving ribavirin.
Conclusion: The current evidence for the effectiveness and safety of antiviral therapies for
coronavirus is inconclusive and suffers from a lack of well-designed prospective trials or
observational studies, preventing any treatment recommendations from being made. However,
it is clear that the existing body of evidence is weighted heavily towards ribavirin (41/54 studies),
which has not shown conclusive evidence of effectiveness and may cause harmful adverse
events so future investigations may consider focusing on other candidates for antiviral therapy.

INTRODUCTION
Purpose and Research Questions
The Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Branch of the Public Health Agency of Canada
(PHAC) submitted a query on the effectiveness and safety of antiviral, antibody, or other
medical countermeasures for the treatment of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) through the
Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network (DSEN).
They requested the DSEN Methods and Application Group in Indirect Comparisons (MAGIC)
Team conduct a rapid review on this topic with an approximate 2-week timeline.
The overall objective of this rapid review was to identify safe and effective medical
countermeasures to address the current outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). In order
to focus the research question to increase feasibility, we proposed the following key research
questions:
1. What is the effectiveness and safety of any antiviral and/or monoclonal antibody
treatment currently available to treat (COVID-19)?
2. What is the effectiveness and safety of currently available antiviral therapies used to
treat other coronavirus infections?

METHODS
Overall methods
The rapid review conduct was guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions1 along with the Rapid Review Guide for Health Policy and Systems Research2.
The team used an integrated knowledge translation approach, with consultation from the
knowledge users from the Public Health Agency of Canada at the following stages: question
development, literature search, study inclusion, interpretation of results, and draft report. After
the report is submitted to the Public Health Agency of Canada, a manuscript will be prepared for
publication and we will invite our knowledge users to join us as coauthors. We will use the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement3 to
guide the reporting of our rapid review results; a PRISMA extension specific to rapid reviews is
currently under development.

Literature search
Comprehensive literature searches addressing both research question 1 (RQ1) and research
question 2 (RQ2) were developed by an experienced librarian for MEDLINE, EMBASE, the
Cochrane Library, and biorxiv.org/medrxiv.org databases. Grey (i.e., difficult to locate or
unpublished) literature was located using keyword searches of relevant terms (e.g. coronavirus,
SARS, etc.) in clinicaltrials.gov and GIDEON (Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology
Network). Additionally, the final set of included articles was cross-referenced with a list studies
provided by our knowledge users from the Public Health Agency of Health as part of the scoping
process for this review. The full MEDLINE search strategy and grey literature search keywords
can be found in Appendix 1.

Study designs:
•

•

The following study designs were eligible for RQ1:
o

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs

o

Non-randomized studies (e.g., non-randomized trials, interrupted time series,
controlled before after)

o

Observational studies (e.g., cohort, case control, cross-sectional)

o

Case studies, case reports, and case series

o

Pre-clinical (animal) studies

The following study designs were eligible for RQ2:
o

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs

o

Non-randomized studies (e.g., quasi-RCTs, non-randomized trials, interrupted time
series, controlled before after)

o

Observational studies (e.g., cohort, case control, cross-sectional)

Time periods (for RQ1 and RQ2): All periods of time and duration of follow-up were eligible.
Other (for RQ1 and RQ2): Only studies published in English were eligible for inclusion, due to
the short timelines for this review. Relevant studies written in languages other than English and
relevant studies of an ineligible design (e.g., trial protocol, literature review) will be excluded but
reported in an appendix of possibly relevant articles (Appendix 2).

Study selection
For both level 1 (title/abstract) and level 2 (full-text) screening, a screening form was prepared
based on the eligibility criteria and pilot-tested by the review team using 25 citations prior to
level 1 screening and 10 full text articles prior to level 2 screening. Agreement between
reviewers was sufficiently high (>75%) in both cases so no further pilot-testing was required.
Full screening was completed by a single reviewer for both level 1 and level 2 using
Synthesi.SR, the team’s proprietary online software [https://breakthroughkt.ca/login.php].

Data items and data abstraction
Items for data abstraction included study characteristics (e.g., study period, study design,
country of conduct), patient characteristics (e.g., mean age, age range, co-morbidities),
intervention details (e.g., type of intervention, dose, timing of treatment), comparator details
(e.g., comparator intervention, dose), and outcome results (e.g., hospitalizations due to
coronavirus, adverse events, mortality) at the longest duration of follow-up.
A standardized data abstraction form was developed to capture data on the above listed items.
Prior to data abstraction, a calibration exercise was completed to test the form amongst the
entire review team using two randomly selected full-text articles. Following successful
completion of the calibration exercise, included studies were abstracted by single reviewers.

Risk of bias appraisal
Risk of bias appraisal was carried out by single reviewers using Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB)
tool4 for controlled trials and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale5 (NOS) for cohort or case-control
studies.

Synthesis
Included studies were synthesized descriptively including summary statistics and detailed tables
of study characteristics and results. Tables of study results are organized according to study
design and where available, information on relevant subgroups were highlighted.

RESULTS
Literature Search
The database search returned a total of 4,491 citations, while the grey literature searches
returned 305 citations, and 8 additional citations were identified from the articles provided by our
knowledge users from the Public Health Agency of Canada for level 1 screening. A total of
4,567 citations were excluded after level 1 screening and a further 81 citations were identified
as ineligible for the current review but potentially of interest to knowledge users, leaving 156
potentially relevant articles to be passed to level 2 screening. The full-text for 29 articles could
not be obtained in time to be screened for this review and were added to the inventory of
potentially relevant articles. Of the 127 articles screened at level 2, 74 were passed to data
abstraction. During data abstraction a further 20 articles were excluded due to lack of relevant
outcomes, leaving 54 articles included in this review (Figure 1).

Characteristics of included studies
Of the 54 studies included in this review three were controlled trials6-8, 10 were cohort studies918
, seven were retrospective medical record/database studies19-25, and 34 were case reports or
case series26-59 (Table 2). All of the included studies were published between 2003 and 2020
with the majority conducted in Hong Kong (n=14), followed by China (n=12), Saudi Arabia
(n=10), Canada (n=5), South Korea (n=4), Taiwan (n=3), and one each from France, Germany,
Greece, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States. Sample sizes for the studies ranged
from single patients in the case reports to groups of >1000 patients in the cohort studies.
Overall, the majority of studies (n=33) dealt with treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS), followed by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS; n=16), COVID-19
(n=3) and two studies treated unspecified coronavirus.

The majority of studies were conducted in adult populations (n=52), one case report31 and one
case series36 included infant and pediatric populations, respectively. Four case
reports/series29,45,46,48 specifically included immunocompromised patients and one case study34
included a pregnant woman with MERS; however, the majority of study populations included
patients with comorbid conditions (n=33). Common comorbidities included diabetes, heart
disease, hypertension, and renal failure (Appendix 3). The most common antiviral studied was
ribavirin (n=41), followed by oseltamivir (n=10) and the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (n=7).
Additional therapies used in the studies included a variety of broad spectrum antibiotics (n=30),
steroids including hyrdcortisone, methylprednisone, or prednisolone (n=39) or various
interferons (n=12; Appendix 3). No animal or human trials investigating monoclonal antibodies
for the treatment of COVID-19 were found in this rapid review. All of the studies recruited from
or reported on hospitalized populations and the most commonly reported outcome was mortality
(n=40), followed by ICU admission (n=21) and adverse events (n=18).

Risk of Bias Results
The 34 case reports/series and 7 retrospective studies included in this review were not
assessed for risk of bias due to the inherent bias in the type of study design. The 3 trials were
assessed with the Cochrane RoB tool4 and the 10 cohort studies were assessed using the
NOS5. The risk of bias in the 3 included trials was overall difficult to judge due to a lack of
adequate descriptions of study methods (Figure 2). All three of the trials were at high or unclear
risk of bias on the following components: random sequence generation, allocation concealment,
and blinding of participants/personnel (Appendix 5). The cohort studies were of fair quality
overall; most of the studies suffered from a lack of representative sampling (n=8), failed to
demonstrate that the outcomes of interest were not present at the start of the study (n=8), or
failed to adequately ensure the comparability of cohorts (n=4; Figure 3). The complete NOS
results are provided in Appendix 5.

Studies of COVID-19
Three studies examining patients infected with COVID-19 were included in this review: one case
report35 and two case series56,57.
The case report35 included a 35-year-year old man, the first American diagnosed with COVID19. He, he was initially treated with vancomycin and cefepime which are standard treatments for
suspected community-acquired pneumonia. Upon lab-confirmation of COVID-19 infection, the
antibiotics were stopped and the patient was started on Remdesivir 7 days after initial admission
to hospital. At study end, the patient remained hospitalized with the majority of symptoms
resolved (see appendices 3 and 4 for complete details).
The two case series56,57 were conducted in China and included 4 and 138 patients, respectively.
All patients were hospitalized and initial diagnosis was made based on WHO Criteria later
confirmed by lab-testing of the patient specimens. The case series included an approximately
even number of male and female (55% v 45%) patients ranging in age from 19 to 68 years old,

with a variety of co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney or liver
disease, COPD, and diabetes (Appendix 3). In one case series57, patients (n=4) were treated
with a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, Arbidol (umifenovir), antibiotics, Shufeng Jiedu Capsule
(Traditional Chinese Medicine), and intravenous immunoglobulins (Appendix 4). At study end
(15 days),) two patients tested negative for COVID-19 and were subsequently discharged from
the hospital and two patients remained hospitalized, one of whom still required mechanical
ventilation (Appendix 4). In the larger case series56, 124 patients were treated with oseltamivir
combined with antibiotic therapy in 89 patients and combined with glucocorticoids in 62 patients
(Appendix 4). Over the course of the study, 34 patients treated with oseltamivir were admitted to
the ICU, 17 of which required invasive mechanical ventilation. At study end (19 days),) 47
patients had been discharged and 6 patients died, all of whom had been admitted to ICU
(Appendix 4).
Ongoing human trials for COVID-19
Four currently ongoing randomized controlled trials proposing to test treatments for COVID-19
were identified through keyword searches of clinicaltrials.gov. All four trials are being carried out
in China, three are investigating antiviral medications (lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol (umifenovir),
darunavir, cobicstat, and, ASC09/ritonavir) and one trial is investigating a combination of
lopinavir/ritonavir with Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCM). At the time of this writing two of the
trials have started recruiting patients (further details in Table 3).

Effectiveness Outcomes
Infection Prevention
One of the included trials7 examined the effectiveness of ribavirin combined with
lopinavir/ritonavir compared to no treatment as a prophylactic measure for healthcare workers
highly exposed to MERS through unprotected exposure to a patient with pneumonia later

confirmed to be caused by MERS-CoV. None of the subjects in the prophylaxis arm
(ribavirin/lopinavir/ritonavir) developed MERS while 6 subjects in the control arm were infected
with MERS as confirmed by rPT-PCR testing. The risk of infection was statistically significantly
lower in the prophylaxis arm (adjusted odds ratio: 0.405, 95% CI 0.274 to 0.599, p=0.009;
Appendix 4).
ICU Admission
Of the 21 studies reporting this outcome, one was a randomized trial6 comparing ribavirin
supplemented with hydrocortisone to ribavirin alone; three were cohort studies14,15,17 comparing
oseltamivir to steroid treatment alone, ribavirin with continuous steroid treatment to ribavirin with
high-dose ‘pulse’ steroids, and ribavirin to steroid and/or antibiotic treatment; three were
retrospective studies19,20,25 examining the effectiveness of ribavirin and oseltamivir alone or in
combination with other drugs; and 14 were case reports/series33,34,37,40,42,44,45,47,50,51,53,55-57
examining ribavirin, oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir alone or in combination with steroids or
antibiotics. None of the trials, cohorts, or retrospective studies demonstrated statistically
significant results between any of the comparisons (i.e., in favour of or against the effectiveness
of ribavirin, oseltamivir or lopinavir/ritonavir) in reducing the risk of ICU admission for patients
with SARS or MERS. The case reports and series were similarly inconclusive, none of the study
authors reported a particular advantage for patients with COVID-19, SARS, or MERS treated
with ribavirin, oseltamivir, or lopinavir/ritonavir.
Special populations
One case series45 included 4 patients with hematological malignancies that acquired MERS
infections. The patients were all treated with oseltamivir and one patient required admission to
the ICU due to worsening symptoms. One case report34 of a pregnant woman with MERS
described initially attempting treatment with antibiotics but the patient did not respond and was
transferred to ICU where antiviral treatments were initiated but the patient continued to
deteriorate and died. In a case series36 of 4 pediatric patients with SARS, all 4 were treated with
ribavirin and 2 patients required mechanical ventilation during the course of their illness.
Mortality
Mortality was reported in two of the included trials (ribavirin), all 10 cohort studies (ribavirin,
lopinavir/ritonavir, oseltamivir), all seven retrospective studies (ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir,
oseltamivir), and 21 case reports or case series (ribavirin, oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir). The
comparative studies (trials and cohorts) failed to find statistically significant results indicating
that none of the antivirals they examined were effective in reducing mortality for SARS or
MERS. One cohort study10 of MERS patients found that treatment with ribavirin and interferons
significantly increased 90-day mortality risk (adjusted odds ratio: 2.27, 95% CI 1.20-4.32). The
patients in this cohort were generally older (median age 57 (IQR 47-70)) and had a number of
underlying chronic conditions including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung, renal, or
liver disease and malignancy including leukemia or lymphoma which may in part explain the
increased risk. One retrospective study20 of SARS patients found the 21-day mortality rate was
significantly higher in a cohort of patients treated with ribavirin compared to matched historical
controls (6.5%, 95% CI 1.9% to 11.8%). Patients in this study were largely middle aged (34 to
57 years of age); however a large proportion of patients that died (approximately 80%) had
underlying conditions such as diabetes or cancer.

The two case series56,57 and one case report35 that included patients with COVID-19 that used
Remdesivir (1 patient), lopinavir/ritonavir (4 cases) and oseltamivir (124 cases) reported 6
deaths in the cohort treated with oseltamivir.
Special Populations
The four cases reports/series29,45,46,48 that included immunosuppressed patients with MERS (5
patients) and unspecified coronavirus (2 patients) reported 3 deaths all in patients with
hematological malignancies treated with foscarnet (n=1) and oseltamivir (n=2). One patient with
HIV and 2 patients with hematological malignancies that acquired MERS were treated with
ribavirin and oseltamivir respectively and survived after being hospitalized for their illness (38
and 28 days respectively). The case report34 of a pregnant woman with MERS treated with
oseltamivir and later ribavirin succumbed to septic shock 8 days after admission to hospital. The
two case series31,36 that included pediatric patients treated with ribavirin reported no mortality at
study end.

Safety Outcomes
Adverse Events
One of the included trials7, seven of the cohort studies9-11,13-15,17, three of the retrospective
studies20,21,25, and seven case reports/series28,38,39,42,43,50,51 reported treatment related adverse
events while two retrospective studies and three case reports/series reported that no treatment
related adverse events occurred. In the trial7 examining the effectiveness of
ribavirin/lopinavir/ritonavir compared to no treatment as a prophylactic measure for healthcare
workers, treatment-related adverse events were widely reported in the prophylaxis arm,
including: GI symptoms (diarrhea n=9, nausea n=9, stomatitis n=4), anemia (n=9), leucopenia
(n=8) and hyperbilirubinemia (n=20). All adverse effects occurred during prophylactic therapy
and resolved shortly after conclusion of treatment with no further intervention. Overall, the most
commonly reported adverse events were anemia (n=12 studies) and altered liver function (n=5
studies) in patients treated with ribavirin. Other treatment related adverse events included
gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting), changes in kidney function, cardiac events
(e.g., bradycardia, atrial fibrillation), hyperglycemia, and changes in mental status (e.g.,
confusion, anxiety). It should be noted however, that in the studies reporting cardiac adverse
events, hyperglycemia, and mental status changes patients were receiving steroids as well as
ribavirin.
Special Populations
None of the studies that included special populations reported treatment-related adverse
events.

DISCUSSION
The Public Health Agency of Canada commissioned a rapid review to address the urgent
question of the effectiveness and safety of antiviral or antibody therapies in the treatment of
coronavirus. A comprehensive literature search of both electronic databases and grey literature
sources resulted in 54 studies of various antiviral treatments in patients diagnosed with COVID-

19, SARS, or MERS; however, no animal or human studies of monoclonal antibodies could be
found.
Overall the results of the included studies proved inconclusive on the effectiveness of antiviral
drugs in treating coronavirus infections and prevent any particular treatments from being
recommended for use. There is a low quality of available evidence that largely consists of case
reports and case series, with few observational studies, and even fewer trials. There were
however important safety signals identified in the included studies, particularly the possible
development of anemia and altered liver function in patients receiving ribavirin treatment. It is
similarly difficult to recommend a particular antiviral drug as a promising candidate for further
investigation due to the variable quality and inconclusive results of the current evidence. This
review does show however that the existing body of evidence is weighted heavily towards
studies of ribavirin which has shown no particular efficacy in treating coronavirus and may in
fact cause harmful adverse effects. Future investigations into potential antiviral therapies for
coronavirus may be best served by pointing their attention to other drug candidates.
There are several limitations to the review methods employed here, single screening and
abstraction for example, however they were selected to thoughtfully tailor our methods
according to our knowledge user needs and the urgent nature of the request to provide timely
results.

CONCLUSIONS
The current evidence for the effectiveness of antiviral therapies for coronavirus is not conclusive
and suffers from a lack of well-designed prospective trials or observational studies. None of the
interventions examined in this review can be recommended for use in patients with coronavirus.
Similarly, no firm recommendations can be made for or against these interventions from a safety
perspective due to a lack of conclusive evidence. Some important safety signals potentially
related to ribavirin use were identified (anemia, altered liver function) but also require further
investigation to clarify their relation to the drug.
