Abstract
Background: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China since
late December 2019. Crude case fatality ratio (CFR) with dividing the number of known deaths by
the number of confirmed cases does not represent the true CFR and might be off by orders of
magnitude. We aim to provide a precise estimate of the CFR of COVID-19 using statistical models
at the early stage of the epidemic.
Methods: We extracted data from the daily released epidemic report published by the National
Health Commission P. R. China from 20 Jan 2020, to 1 March 2020. Competing risk model was
used to obtain the cumulative hazards for death, cure, and cure-death hazard ratio. Then the CFR
was estimated based on the slope of the last piece in joinpoint regression model, which reflected the
most recent trend of the epidemic.
Results: As of 1 March 2020, totally 80,369 cases were diagnosed as COVID-19 in China. The
CFR of COVID-19 were estimated to be 70.9% (95% CI: 66.8%-75.6%) during Jan 20-Feb 2, 20.2%
(18.6%-22.1%) during Feb 3-14, 6.9% (6.4%-7.4%) during Feb 15-23, 1.5% (1.4%-1.6%) during
Feb 24-March 1 in Hubei province, and 20.3% (17.0%-25.3%) during Jan 20-28, 1.9% (1.8%-2.1%)
during Jan 29-Feb 12, 0.9% (0.8%-1.1%) during Feb 13-18, 0.4% (0.4%-0.5%) during Feb
19-March 1 in other areas of China, respectively.
Conclusions: Based on analyses of public data, we found that the CFR in Hubei was much higher
than that of other regions in China, over 3 times in all estimation. The CFR would follow a
downwards trend based on our estimation from recently released data. Nevertheless, at early stage
of outbreak, CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously because of limited data source on true
onset and recovery time.

Introduction
On December 8, 2019, the first pneumonia cases with unknown etiology was identified in Wuhan
city, Hubei province, China [1]. Subsequently, World Health Organization (WHO) appointed an
expert group arrived in China to guide the epidemic management. On January 8, 2020, the pathogen
of this unexplained infected pneumonia was isolated by Chinese researchers, now known as severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [2-4], which resembled to the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1]. On January 25, 2020, WHO released the
Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) situation report-5 and stated that the new coronavirus epidemic
has posed a very high risk to China and a high risk to both regional level and global level [5]. On
February 20, 2020, WHO officially named this disease caused by the new coronavirus
SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19 [6]. As of March 1, 2020, a total of 80,369 confirmed cases and 2,915
death cases with COVID-19 infection were reported from 31 provinces (autonomous regions,
municipalities) in China [2].
To date, in the first forty days since identification of the COVID-19 (Jan 8th-Mar 1th, 2020),
considerable new knowledge about this coronavirus have been generated, such as person-to-person
transmission [7], clinical characteristic [8-10], prediction on the incubation period, basic
reproductive number, total case number, and epidemic trend [11, 12]. However, key question about
the CFR, an important epidemiological indicator for reflecting and predicting the severity of the
disease, of the COVID-19 epidemic remains unsolved. Timely and accurate estimates of the CFR
are critical for predicting the outbreak dynamics and health care capacity needed, to tailor
appropriate and effective measures for disease control, public safety, and allocation of health
resources.
At the early stage of COVID-19 outbreaks, given the limited and incomplete data (for the epidemic
is still ongoing), the CFR is a crude estimated as by dividing the number of known deaths by the
number of confirmed cases with COVID-19 in previous papers [8-10]. Nevertheless, these results

are subject to large errors because future deaths are not taken into account, instead, which might be
off by orders of magnitude. Diagnosis of viral infection will develop to two competing risk
outcomes, recovery or death, by days to weeks and the denominator of CFR, the number of
confirmed cases, at the cross-sectional level should consider the loss of those recovered [13]. Hence
in this study we aim to provide a precise estimate of the case fatality ratio of COVID-19 epidemic at
present.

Methods
Data sources
We extracted the daily released epidemic report published by the National Health Commission P. R.
China from 20 Jan, 2020, to 1 March, 2020 [14]. For each day, the number of new admissions,
cumulative number of cases, number of new deaths, cumulative number of deaths, newly cured
patients, and cumulative number of cured patients were obtained.

Statistical analysis
Although it did not include any individual patient data, the CFR estimated using the competing
risks model in the survival analysis [15]. Following the standard non-parametric competing risks
theory, the daily hazards for dying and cure, treated as competing risks, are each estimated, and the
other endpoint are treated as censoring.
For each day i, we captured the number of new admissions (ni), cumulative number of cases (Ni),
number of new deaths (di), cumulative number of deaths (Di), newly cured patients (ci), and
cumulative number of cured patients (Ci).
Other parameters listed below:
t: the survival time during the admission-to-cure or death;

θk, equaled to Λk2/Λk1, denoted for the cure-death hazard ratio for each day k.

P(J), J=1 denoted for the ultimate case fatality ratio, J=2 denoted for the ultimate case cure rate.
For up to day k, the cumulative hazards for death, cure, and cure-death hazard ratio were obtain. If
the ratio is constant θ over the study period, then it follows that P(J=2)=θP(J=1). Since
P(J=1)+P(J=2)=1, we P(J=1)=1/(1+θ). Therefore, if the ratio is a constant θ during a period then the
ultimate CFR in that period is defined as 1/(1+θ). To investigate the relationship between cure-death
hazards was linear or non-linear, the cure-death hazard plot was shown. If non-linear relationship
was discovered, joinpoint regression will be used [16].

Results
Data description
As of March 1, 2020, a total of 80,369 cases were diagnosed as COVID-19 in China. Total number
of death cases and cured cases of COVID-19 were 2,803 and 33,757 in Hubei province, and 112

and 10,761 in other provinces in China, respectively. The number of deaths and cures in Hubei,
including Wuhan, accounted for 96.2% and 75.8% of the whole country, but the proportion of
deaths and cures was quite different, which reminded us to separate the fatality rate of Hubei and
other areas (Fig. 1).

CFR estimation of the COVID-19
In the joinpoint regression, the relationship between cure-death hazards were nonlinear for both
Hubei and other provinces (Fig. 2). With the slope (cumulative cured hazard/cumulative death
hazard) of joinpoint fitting increased, the corresponding CFR estimation gradually decreased. Our
CFR estimation was calculated based on the slope of the last piece in joinpoint regression model,
which reflected the most recent trend of the epidemic. As shown in Fig. 3, the CFR of COVID-19
were estimated to be 70.9% (95% CI: 66.8%-75.6%) during Jan 20-Feb 2, 20.2% (18.6%-22.1%)
during Feb 3-14, 6.9% (6.4%-7.4%) during Feb 15-23, 1.5% (1.4%-1.6%) during Feb 24-March 1
in Hubei province, and 20.3% (17.0%-25.3%) during Jan 20-28, 1.9% (1.8%-2.1%) during Jan
29-Feb 12, 0.9% (0.8%-1.1%) during Feb 13-18, 0.4% (0.4%-0.5%) during Feb 19-March 1 in
other provinces of China, respectively.
Discussion
Based on public available daily data, we found that the CFR of COVID-19 changes with time and
decreases continuously both in Hubei and other provinces.
The most current estimate of the CFR of 1.5% in Hubei for COVID-19 is lower than that of
SARS-CoV (9.2%) and that of MERS-CoV (34.4%) [17]. Consistent with our results, Chinese
researchers reported comparable CFR estimations of 11% among 99 patients in Wuhan Jinyintan
Hospital [9] and 15% among 41 patients in Wuhan [10]. However, others reported markedly lower
CFR (1.4%) among 1,099 patients from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities and
4.3% among 138 patients in Wuhan Zhongnan Hospital [8]. It should be noted that these CFR

estimates were cross-sectional, which were calculated by dividing the number of known deaths by
the number of confirmed cases at certain time point[18]. As contrast, WHO Collaborating Centre
for Infectious Disease Modelling and MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis published
their 4th edition Report: Severity of 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV), which showed a markedly
higher estimation of CFR to be 18% (95% CI: 11%-81%) for cases detected in Hubei [19].
This estimated CFR of COVID-19 was much higher in Hubei Province than that of other area in
China. Several possible reasons could be able to explain this discrepancy. Firstly, high proportion of
severe cases among the confirmed patients potentially contributes to high proportion of death in
Hubei Province [8-10]. Patients with serious symptoms were prioritized to be admitted to the
hospital. Secondly, insufficient medical resources including clinicians, nurses as well as facilities,
including diagnosis toolkits at the outbreak of COVID-19 in Hubei directly resulted the
deterioration of disease course. It is reasonable to assume that huge amount of mild cases or
early-stage cases have developed into more serious conditions before they were able to be admitted
and appropriately treated. Thirdly, under-detection of mild or asymptomatic cases also resulted in
higher CFR, which may be further aggravated after the outbreak, due to that the daily capacity of
virus testing in Hubei has already reached the limit. Fourthly, as the COVID-19 initially outbroke in
Wuhan, Hubei, other regions of China and foreign countries gained critical time to develop
epidemic control strategy and reallocate medical resources. However, this delay of epidemic in
other regions and foreign countries may also result in the delay of fatal cases arising and reporting,
which rendered the lower CFR in other regions of China comparing with Hubei Province.
We observed obvious decreasing trends of CFR for COVID-19, with distinct turning points for in
Hubei and other areas respectively. From Jan 23, 2020, several unprecedentedly strict and effective
measures were carried out, especially the lockdown of Wuhan, Hubei, including suspended public
transportation, forbidden pubic gathering, postponed school and enterprise opening, and furnished
kinds of medical resources to prevent further disease transmission [20]. Based on our estimation
and recently released data, we concluded that the CFR would follow a downwards trend.

Actually, the extent of underreporting varied over time, cities and countries [13]. In fact, in order to
break the capacity limit of virus lab testing and achieve a better control of this epidemic, Hubei
Province has included the clinically diagnosed cases into the confirmed cases to be published
starting from February 12, 2020. Clinically diagnosed cases are confirmed by a combination of
travel history, symptoms and CT image rather than the virus lab test. So there are 14,840 new
confirmed cases (including 13,332 clinically diagnosed cases) in Hubei province was reported in
February 12, 2020, abided by the diagnosis and treatment scheme for the new coronavirus
infections (pilot version 5) [21]. In this case, our CFR estimated will decrease due to the update of
diagnosis standard.
The competing risk model, for estimating the CFR in the early stage of COVID-19 epidemic, is
applicable to any disease for which the final outcome is not known for a proportion of patients [18].
Using published daily summary data when individual data is not available, provides a powerful
sample to estimate CFR and to predict the future trend of disease epidemic.
Nevertheless, several limitations should be considered. First, our analyses were based on public
summary data with a lack of individual level of time to death or cure, characteristics at baseline,
such as age, gender and chronic disease status. Therefore, the heterogeneity of CFR among the
subgroups is not able to be investigated. Neither is it easy to find the most susceptible population of
COVID-19 to whom better protections should be provided. However, previous studies have found
that males older than 65 years with multiple comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases are the
most vulnerable population than others, suffering with both the highest incidence of confirmed
patients and the highest CFR [8-10]. Second, currently in our study, it is difficult to adjust the
influence of the lag of the real case numbers resulting from insufficient medical resources in Hubei
Province. With the development of the epidemic, this lag will be alleviated and then we can get a
more precise idea of the severity of this COVID-19 epidemic.

Based on analyses of public data, we found that the adjusted CFR in Hubei was much higher than
that of other regions in China, over 3 times in all estimation. The CFR would follow a downwards
trend based on our estimation and recently released data. Nevertheless, at early stage of outbreak,
CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously because of limited data source on true onset and
