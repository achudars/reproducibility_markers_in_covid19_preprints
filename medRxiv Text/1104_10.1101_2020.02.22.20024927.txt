Abstract

Background: Radiologic characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
infected pneumonia (NCIP) which had not been fully understood are especially
important for diagnosing and predicting prognosis.
Purpose: To summarize the clinical and radiologic characteristics of NCIP cases and
analyze the association of radiologic findings with mortality cases.
Material and methods: We retrospective studied 27 consecutive patients who were
confirmed NCIP, the clinical characteristics and CT image findings were collected,
and the association of radiologic findings with mortality of patients was evaluated.
Results: 27 patients included 12 men and 15 women, with median age of 60 years
(IQR 47-69). 17 patients discharged in recovered condition and 10 patients died in
hospital. The median age of mortality group was higher compared to survival group
(68 (IQR 63-73) vs 55 (IQR 35-60), P = 0.003). The comorbidity rate in mortality
group was significantly higher than in survival group (80% vs 29%, P = 0.018). The
predominant CT characteristics consisted of ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral
sides involved (86%), both peripheral and central distribution (74%), and lower zone
involvement (96%). The median CT score of mortality group was higher compared to
survival group (30 (IQR 7-13) vs 12 (IQR 11-43), P = 0.021), with more frequency of
consolidation (40% vs 6%, P = 0.047) and air bronchogram (60% vs 12%, P = 0.025).
An optimal cutoff value of a CT score of 24.5 had a sensitivity of 85.6% and a
specificity of 84.5% for the prediction of mortality.
Conclusions: 2019-nCoV was more likely to infect elderly people with chronic
comorbidities. CT findings of NCIP were featured by predominant ground glass
opacities mixed with consolidations, mainly peripheral or combined peripheral and
central distributions, bilateral and lower lung zones being mostly involved. A simple
CT scoring method was capable to predict mortality.

Key words: 2019 novel coronavirus; pneumonia; CT findings; mortality.

Introduction

In December, 2019, a series of pneumonia cases linked to a seafood and wet animal
wholesale market emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China

[1]

. Deep sequencing analysis

from lower respiratory tract samples indicated a novel coronavirus, which was named
2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)

[2]

. By 4 Feb 2020 a total 24,324 cases have

been confirmed infection nationwide with 3,219 severe cases, 490 death cases, and
another 23,260 suspected cases

[3]

. Reports have also been released of exported cases

in many other countries. WHO had determined this situation should be deemed a
public health emergency of international concern on 30 Jan 2020

[4]

. Symptoms of

2019-nCoV infected pneumonia (NCIP) include fever and/or respiratory illness,
lymphopenia, and radiologic abnormality

[5-7]

, among these clinical features,

radiologic characteristics of NCIP are especially important for diagnosing and
predicting prognosis. We herein summarize the clinical and radiologic characteristics
of 27 confirmed cases and analyze the association of radiologic findings with
mortality cases.

Methods

Patients
This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Hubei
Public Health Clinical Center, the central Hospital of Wuhan, and written informed
consent was waived. Between 1 January 2020 and 25 January 2010, 27 consecutive
patients who fulfilled the clinical criteria for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
infected pneumonia (NCIP) established by the WHO interim guidance

[8]

and

discharged with recovered symptoms or died in hospital were included. Diagnosis of
NCIP was made by positive test for 2019-nCoV viral RNA, in throat-swab specimens
collected from patients by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) using standard RTPCR protocol at Hubei Provincial Center for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC). Clinical characteristics together with chest imaging
manifestations of each confirmed cases were recorded, if available.
All patients were treated with intravenous ribavirin 0.5g twice daily and/or oral
oseltamivir 75 mg, twice daily. Antibiotics, including levofloxacin, moxifloxacin,
sulbactam and cefoperazone, piperacillin and meropenem were used. Some patients
also received glucocorticoid and/or intravenous immunoglobulin administration.

CT scans
The technical parameters included 64-section scanner with 1 mm collimation at 5 mm
intervals. All CT examinations were performed with the patient in the supine position
and with breath-holding following inspiration, without administration of contrast
material. Images were obtained with both mediastinal (width 350 HU; level 40 HU)
and parenchymal (width 1500HU; level -600 HU) window settings.

Imaging evaluation
Two experienced pulmonologists (YML, WY) reviewed the images independently,
with a final finding reached by consensus when there was a discrepancy. CT findings
included ground glass opacity, consolidation, air bronchogram and nodular opacities.

Ground glass opacity (GGO) was defined as hazy areas of increased opacity or
attenuation without concealing the underlying vessels. Consolidation was defined as
homogeneous opacification of the parenchyma obscuring the underlying vessels. Air
bronchogram was defined as a pattern of air-filled (low-attenuation) bronchi on a
background of opaque (high-attenuation) airless lung. Nodular opacities were defined
as focal round opacities either solid nodules or GGOs (diameter ≤ 3 cm). The
presence of lymphadenopathy was defined as a lymph node ≥1 cm in short-axis
diameter.
The CT scans were scored on the axial images referring to the method described
previously

[9]

. The extent of involvement of each abnormality was assessed

independently for each of 3 zones: upper (above the carina), middle (below the carina
and above the inferior pulmonary vein), and lower (below the inferior pulmonary
vein). The location of the lesion was defined as peripheral if it was in the outer
one-third of the lung, or as central otherwise. The CT findings were graded on a
3-point scale: 1 as normal attenuation, 2 as ground-glass attenuation, and 3 as
consolidation. Each lung zone, with a total of six lung zones in each patient, was
assigned a following scale according to distribution of the affected lung parenchyma:
0 as normal, 1 as < 25% abnormality, 2 as 25–50% abnormality, 3 as 50–75%
abnormality, and 4 as > 75% abnormality. The four-point scale of the lung
parenchyma distribution was then multiplied by the radiologic scale described above.
Points from all zones were added for a final total cumulative score, with value ranging
from 0 to72 (Figure 1).

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as median (interquartile range, IQR) and
compared with the Mann-Whitney U test or Wilcoxon test; categorical variables were
expressed as number (%) and compared by χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test if appropriate.
A two-sided α of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical
analyses were done using the SPSS (version 16.0).

Results

As shown in Table 1, the 27 patients diagnosed as 2019 novel coronavirus
(2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (NCIP) included 12 men and 15 women, with
median age of 60 years (IQR 47-69). 17 patients discharged in recovered condition
with twice negative test for 2019-nCoV viral RNA in throat-swab specimens and 10
patients died in hospital. The median age of mortality group was higher compared to
survival group (68 (IQR 63-73) vs 55 (IQR 35-60), P = 0.003). The comorbidity rate
in mortality group was significantly higher than in survival group (80% vs 29%, P =
0.018), especially comorbid hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac disease. 12 patients
developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and required non-invasive ventilator
mechanical ventilation, 11 of whom died, and one 36 years old man (oxygenation
index: 184 mmHg) recovered after treatment. There were no significant differences
between survival group and mortality group with respect to patient sex and symptoms.
The CT features, including the location, extent and distribution of involvement
of each abnormality were shown in table 2. The median days of CT scans were 8 (IQR
5-11) before symptom onset in all patients. The predominant CT characteristics
consisted of ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral sides involved (86%), both
peripheral and central distribution (74%), and lower zone involved (96%). Ground
glass nodular opacities were found in a 2 cases on admission in survival group and
progressed to multiple patchy ground glass opacities on reexamination (Figure 2).
Lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion were relatively seldom seen (0% and 4%).
The median CT score of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (30
(IQR 7-13) vs 12 (IQR 11-43), P = 0.021), with more frequency of consolidation (40%
vs 6%, P = 0.047) and air bronchogram (60% vs 12%, P = 0.025) (Figure 3).
In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (Figure 4), an optimal
cutoff value of a CT score of 24.5 had a sensitivity of 85.6% and a specificity of 84.5%
for the prediction of mortality. The area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve was 0.901 (95% confidence interval: 0.873, 0.928).
Initial and reexamined CT features in survival group were compared in Table 3.

11 patients reexamined CT scans on day 15 (IQR 9-18) after symptom onset, the
morphology of the lesions, the location, extent and distribution of involvement of
each abnormality were not significantly changed compared to those on admission. In
mortality group, CT scores progressed rapidly in a short time (12 (IQR 5-24.5) vs 20
(IQR 15-46), P = 0.042), with more lung zones being involved (Table 4).

Discussion

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the
common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel
coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans
[10]

.

[5, 6]

The 2019-nCoV causes symptoms similar to SARS based on recent clinical data
, and is capable of spreading from human to human and between cities, with very

contagious characteristic

[11]

. The mortality of the 27 included patients infected by

2019-nCoV was 37%, which is much higher than that reported 2% on 4 Feb 2020

[3]

.

Giving the priority of 2019-nCoV detection to severe cases because of shortness of
test kits in our hospital initially and potential false negative results of 2019-nCoV
viral RNA detection in mild cases might account for this discrepancy. Consistent with
recent reports, our results suggest that 2019-nCoV is more likely to infect elderly
people with chronic comorbidities as a result of the weaker immune functions of these
patients

[5, 6]

, and 2019-nCoV-associated death is also related to elder age and

underlying illnesses, especially hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac disease.
Consistently with several recent reports regarding to CT findings of 2019-nCoV
infected pneumonia (NCIP) [12-14], our results showed that CT manifestations of NCIP
were featured by predominant ground glass opacities (GGO) (67%) mixed with
consolidations (30%), mainly peripheral (26%) or combined peripheral and central
distributions (74%), bilateral (86%) and lower lung zones (96%) being mostly
involved. Merely consolidation, central distribution only, pleural effusions or
lymphadenopathy were relatively rarely seen. Initially the CT images might be GGO
nodules or patchy GGO mostly peripherally distributed then consolidations and
extensive distributions were seen when pneumonia progressed. Consolidation, air
bronchogram, extensive distribution as well as multiple involved lung zones were
more common in mortality group, suggesting a more severe clinical course for these
abnormalities can be pathologically correlated with diffuse alveolar damage and
similar conclusions can be drawn in H1N1 pneumonia, N5N1 pneumonia, H7N9

pneumonia and SARS

[9, 15-17]

. As members of the same virus family, NCIP shared

much common ground with MERS and SARS in CT features. Subpleural and basilar
airspace lesions with GGOs and consolidations were conspicuous CT characteristics
of all three kinds of virus pneumonia, but pleural effusions are more common in
patients who died of MERS [18-21].
Comprehensively evaluated the CT features of NCIP, we calculated the CT score
of each patient. The CT scores were much higher in mortality group compared to
survival group (30 (IQR 7-13) vs 12 (IQR 11-43), 0.021), P = 0.021) on admission. In
mortality group the scores markedly increased in a short time (12 (IQR 5-24.5) vs 20
(IQR 15-46), P = 0.042), suggesting a progressive course of NCIP. Although the CT
scores were not diminished, they maintained a relatively stable level for a period of
time in survival group (12 (IQR 6-12) vs 12 (IQR 6-15), P = 0.237), suggesting that it
might take a long time to recover in chest imaging when NCIP was under controlled.
We found an optimal cutoff value of a CT score of 24.5 (sensitivity of 85.6% and
specificity of 84.5%) to predict mortality. We hope the simple scoring method
according to CT scans may help triage patients and screening patients who need more
aggressive treatment and closely monitoring. However, the efficacy of such approach
to decrease mortality remains to be validated in future studies.
Although a definite diagnosis of NCIP cannot be achieved by using imaging
features alone for most viral pneumonia imaging patterns share similarity, the CT
features summarized above might be helpful in differentiation various pathogens of
pneumonia and in triage patients.
There were limitations in our study. First it was a retrospective study including
only 27 inpatients, while outpatients and suspected but undiagnosed cases for
deficiency of detection kits of 2019-nCoV and potential false negative results were
ruled out. Second, not all information was collected because a significant part of
patients had not rechecked CT scans. Then, it was pulmonologists, although they are
experienced, who evaluated CT images. Finally there was a lack of information
regarding interobserver agreement, because the study emphasis on the final consensus
interpretation rather than independent reading.

Figure Legends

Figure 1. A sample scoring on CT images of a 63-year-old woman from mortality
group demonstrated a total score of 63. It was calculated as: for upper zone (A), 3
(consolidation) × 3 (50-75% distribution) × 2 (both right and left lungs) + 2 (ground
glass opacity) ×1 (< 25% distribution) × 2 (both right and left lungs); for middle zone
(B), 3 (consolidation) × 2 (25-50% distribution) × 2 (both right and left lungs) + 2
(ground glass opacity) × 2 (25-50% distribution) × 2 (both right and left lungs) ; for
lower zone (C), 3 (consolidation) × (2 (25-50% distribution of the right lung) + 3
(50-75% distribution of the left lung))

+ 2 (ground glass opacity) × (2 (25-50%

distribution of the right lung) + 1 (< 25% distribution of the left lung)).

Figure 2. Two cases of CT images from survival group showed ground glass nodular
opacities on admission and progressed to multiple patchy ground glass opacities on
reexamination. The CT images of a 60-year-old woman on admission showed
peripherally distributed focal ground glass nodular opacities in only right lung (A) and
rechecked CT images showed expanded area of patchy ground glass opacities in both
right and left lungs with reticular and interlobular septal thickening on 7 days later (B).
Unilateral ground glass nodular opacity was found on CT images of a 64-year-old
man from survival group (C) and progressed patchy ground glass opacities as well as
interlobular septal thickening were seen after 4 days (D).

Figure 3. CT images of a 76-year-old woman from survival group showed pure
ground glass opacities with predominant peripheral distribution in middle and lower
lung zones (A-C). Air bronchogram, together with extensive of consolidations and
ground glass opacities were found in the CT images of a 72–year-old woman from
mortality group (D-F).
