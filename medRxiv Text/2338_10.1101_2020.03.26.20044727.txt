Abstract
Background: COVID-19 outbreak poses an unprecedented challenge for societies,
healthcare organizations and economies. In the present analysis we coupled climate data with
COVID-19 spread rates worldwide, and in a single country (USA).
Methods: Data of confirmed COVID-19 cases was derived from the COVID-19 Global Cases
by the CSSE at Johns Hopkins University up to March 19, 2020. We assessed disease spread by
two measures: replication rate (RR), the slope of the logarithmic curve of confirmed cases, and
the rate of spread (RoS), the slope of the linear regression of the logarithmic curve.
Results: Based on predefined criteria, the mean COVID-19 RR was significantly lower in warm
climate countries (0.12±0.02) compared with cold countries (0.24±0.01), (P<0.0001). Similarly,
RoS was significantly lower in warm climate countries 0.12±0.02 vs. 0.25 ± 0.01 than in cold
climate countries (P<0.001). In all countries (independent of climate classification) both RR and
RoS displayed a moderate negative correlation with temperature R= -0.69, 95% confidence
interval [CI], -0.87 to -0.36; P<0.001 and R= -0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.87 to -0.36;
P<0.001, respectively. We identified a similar moderate negative correlation with the dew point
temperature. Additional climate variables did not display a significant correlation with neither
RR nor RoS. Finally, in an ancillary analysis, COVID-19 intra-country model using an inter-state
analysis of the USA did not identify yet correlation between climate parameters and RR or RoS
as of March, 19, 2020.
Conclusions: Our analysis suggests a plausible negative correlation between warmer climate and
COVID-19 spread rate as defined by RR and RoS worldwide. This initial correlation should be
interpreted cautiously and be further validated over time, the pandemic is at different stages in
various countries as well as in regions within these countries. As such, some associations may be
more affected by local transmission patterns rather than by climate. Importantly, we provide an

Research in context
Evidence before this study
The coronavirus, COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV 2, challenges healthcare
organizations and economies worldwide. There have been previous reports describing the
association between seasonal climactic variance and SARS-CoV 1 as well as the MERS
infections, but the association with SARS-CoV 2 and climate has not been described extensively.
Added value of this study
Our analysis demonstrates a plausible negative correlation between warmer climate and COVID19 spread rate as defined by RR and RoS worldwide in all countries with local transmission as of
March 9, 2020. This initial correlation should be interpreted cautiously and be further validated
over time. Importantly, we provide an online surveillance dashboard available at
(https://covid19.net.technion.ac.il/) for further dynamic tracking of climate effect on COVID-19
disease spread rate worldwide and on intra-country analysis between USA states.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our findings of decreased replication and spread rates of COVID-19 in warm climates may
suggest that the inevitable seasonal variance will alter the dynamic of the disease spread in both
hemispheres in the coming months. However, we warrant a cautious interpretation of these
findings given the fact that we are in the initial steps of this outbreak in many “warm” climate
countries, the high variance of the data and the dynamic changes in the disease surveillance and
the lack of correlation based on the limited data in the US. We hope that the online tool coupling
COVID-19 data with climate data will assist in tracking the disease and tailoring the needed
measures to contain it.

Introduction
The coronavirus, COVID-19 pandemic, challenges healthcare organizations and economies
worldwide. As of March 20, 2020, a total of 260,476 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed and
11,289 deaths. Transmission of COVID-19 is community-based unlike previous coronavirus
outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or the Middle
East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that were both mainly transmitted in the hospital
setting1,2. Recent reports show that patients infected with COVID-19 are at high risk for severe
morbidity (5% intensive care unit admissions) and mortality (1.4%)3, although highly dependent
on age and prior comorbidity4. The reproduction number (R0), which defines the average number
of cases directly generated by one case, for COVID-19 is estimated to be between 1.5-3.55,6 and
the reproduction efficacy may be influenced by cultural habits, population density and the
country specific mitigation methods such as quarantine strategies as well as travel control
measures7-9. An additional key factor that is of specific interest world-wide and a source for
controversy is the effect of the climate on COVID-19 transmission10.
The spatio-temporal transmission of respiratory viruses such as influenza is highly
associated with meteorological factors such as temperature, humidity and rainfall, with peak
incidence occurring during winter11. The SARS-CoV epidemic in Beijing (2003) peaked during
the early spring time and disease spread rate correlated with climate variables12. Similarly,
SARS-CoV spread in Hong Kong (2003) was shown to negatively correlate with higher
temperatures13.Unlike the SARS-CoV, the highest global seasonal occurrence of the MERS-CoV
occurred during spring-summer periods in countries with warm climate such as Saudi-Arabia14,15
and high temperatures as well as low humidity were associated with increased disease spread rate

Given the variant vulnerability of different strains of coronavirus to climate, specifically
temperature, there is a major global uncertainty regarding the continuing spread of COVID-19
during the coming months. Currently, the World Health Organization assumption is that COVID19 spread will not be ameliorated during the summer period17. A surveillance tool assessing the
correlation between the spread rate of COVID-19 and climate variables will be instrumental for
societies, governments and health organizations worldwide. Analyzing the interaction between
disease spread rate and climate may allow implementation of differential and precise mitigation
measures for disease spread prevention, to tune healthcare routine ambulatory services and
preparation strategies and to minimize the unnecessary dreadful impact of excessive quarantine
strategies on psychosocial health and economies. Online dashboards have proven useful for
global COVID-19 tracking. We have two aims in the current study. First, to compare the
distinctive transmission efficacy of COVID-19 in countries with cold and warm climate based on
the initial disease diagnosis trends worldwide. We consider this to be a cautious test case for
examining the correlation between climate and COVID-19 disease spread. The second and more
important aim, is to create an online up-to-date surveillance tool simultaneously presenting
COVID- 19 spread rate with relation to climate parameters.
Methods:
Data of confirmed COVID-19 cases was derived from the Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases
by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University
(JHU)18up to March 19, 2020. Countries with less than 50 diagnosed patients as well as
countries not categorized as local transmission according to the WHO situation report as of
March 9 were excluded in order to minimize confounding of imported disease transmission.

We prospectively defined “warm” and “cold” climate countries according to the following
criteria: A “Cold” climate country was defined as a country with average temperatures below
15˚ Celsius degrees (<77˚ Fahrenheit) during the month of March10 and latitude line north of
40˚. A “Warm” climate country was defined as a country with average March temperatures
above 15˚ Celsius degrees (≥77˚ Fahrenheit). Based on the assumption that Italy has experienced
an unproportionally high local disease spread not essentially affected by weather (in a similar
manner to the Wuhan outbreak) we tested our model with and without the addition of Italy. We
did not include China in our analysis given the unique circumstances associated with the country
being the origin of the outbreak, the lag between outbreak and detection that may confound
spread as well as the drastic mitigation steps applied. We assessed disease spread by two
measures: The Replication Rate and the Rate of Spread.
Replication rate (RR) was defined as the slope of the logarithmic curve of the natural logarithm
of the number of cases diagnosed in each country, starting from the day in which the total
number of diagnosed cases was ≥30. The choice of 30 for the point we start counting diagnosed
cases was chosen as a cut-off based on 2 standard deviations from the mean diagnosed patients in
countries with imported cases only (based on WHO situation report at March 5, 2020) We
calculated the slope of a sliding window of size (dT), where we chose dT=3. Let 𝐶𝑡 be the
number of validated cases of COVID-19 for each country at day t.
𝑅𝑒𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒 =

𝑙𝑛(𝐶𝑡+𝑑𝑇 ) − 𝑙𝑛(𝐶𝑡 )
.
𝑑𝑇

Rate of Spread (RoS) was calculated based on the method presented by Sajadi et al.10 . It is
calculated by running a linear regression of ln(Confirmed Cases) on time, and taking RoS to be
the slope coefficient of the regression. We used a 7-day sliding window, as in Sajadi et al. 10.

The calculation of the RoS was conducted by using a window for regression that does not
include any missing values. From the RoS one can estimate the doubling time of cases:

Doubling Time = ln(2) ∗ 𝑅𝑜𝑆.19

Databases used
Country population data was taken from the United Nations website, the Department of
Economic and Social Affairs Population
(https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/index.asp).COVID-19 diagnostic test
numbers were taken from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing updated for March, 20, 2020.
Climate data was derived from www.weatherbase.com and based on country capital historical
average climate for the month of March (based on weather data at and missing data was added
from en.climate-data.org). Average temperature, precipitation in mm, morning and evening
humidity, dew point (the temperature to which air must be cooled in order to reach saturation
with water) and wind speed (km/h) were collected. All analyses conducted are presented and
available at https://github.com/covid19climate/COVID-19-Climate.

Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables are reported as mean ± SEM. Group differences in continuous variables
were tested using the Student t-test. Correlation between weather parameters was conducted
using Pearson and Spearman correlation were calculated according to data distribution. A value
of P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was conducted using
GraphPad Prism 6 and R studio gplot2 package.

Results
Based on the inclusion criteria of the study, 13 countries (including Italy) fulfilled the criteria for
“cold” climate countries and 7 countries fulfilled the criteria for “warm” climate countries. Four
countries did not meet the “cold” nor “warm” criteria (Table 1). Confirmed COVID-19 cases
according to country climate classification demonstrated a slower dynamics of case
accumulation in “warm” countries. The data presented was analyzed according to the data
available via CSSE as of March 19, 2020. The cumulative number of cases in a logarithmic scale
is shown in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1. In order to quantify the disease spread, the
replication rate (the slope of the logarithmic graph smoothened for a period of 3 days) was
calculated for each country (Figure 2) as well as the rate of spread the slope of the linear
regression calculated for a period of 7 days (Figure 3). Mean replication rate (RR averaged over
all time windows available for each country) was significantly lower in “warm” climate
countries (0.12 ± 0.02) compared with “cold” countries (0.24 ± 0.01), (p<0.0001). The COVID19 rate of spread (the slope of the linear regression of the logarithmic graph of cumulative cases)
was significantly lower in “warm” climate countries (0.12 ± 0.02) compared with “cold” climate
countries (0.25 ± 0.01). This difference in replication rate translates into a 2.8 times slower
estimated doubling time in “warm” climate countries (7.26±1.56 days) compared with “cold”
climate countries (2.89±0.16), P=0.046.
We used correlation analysis in order to describe the relation between climate parameters
and the RR (Table 1) and RoS (Table 2) in a non-dichotomized data set (without separation to
warm and cold climate countries). Both RR and RoS displayed a moderate negative correlation
with temperature R= -0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.87 to -0.36; P<0.001 and R= -0.72,
95% confidence interval [CI], -0.87 to -0.36; P<0.001, respectively (Figures 4A and Figure 5A).

Climate variables such as precipitation, morning and evening humidity, and wind speed did not
display a significant correlation with both RR and RoS (Figure 4 and 5). In addition, Both RR
and RoS displayed a moderate negative correlation with the dew point R= -0.56, 95% confidence
interval [CI], -0.82 to -0.10; P=0.02 and R= -0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.85 to -0.19;
P=0.008, respectively (Figure 4C and 5C). Given the robust outbreak in Italy, most probably due
to non-climate factors, we examined the discussed climate-RR/RoS correlations without the data
of Italy. The correlation of RR with temperature and dew point in the dataset excluding Italy was
R=-0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.87 to -0.35; P=0.001 and R=-0.59, 95% confidence
interval [CI], -0.84 to -0.17 (P=0.02). The correlations of RoS to temperature and dew point
remained significant as well. Therefore, we conclude that the correlations described above were
unaffected by the inclusion or exclusion of Italy in the analysis. Furthermore, to exclude an
effect of our pre-selected climate classification to “warm” and “cold” on the correlation between
RR/RoS to climate parameters we also examined the correlation after we added countries that
fulfilled our non-climate dependent criteria (USA, Japan, Greece and South Korea). Both RR and
RoS significantly correlated with temperature (RR: R=-0.64, P<0.001; ROS: R=-0.67, P<0.001)
and dew point (RR: R=-0.60, P=0.002; RoS: R=-0.63, P=0.001) and did not correlate with other
climate parameters (similar to the correlation pattern described above without these additional
countries).
To examine the correlation with alternative parameters that might affect the RR or RoS
we tested the correlation between country population size and the degree of disease spread
(Supplementary Table 1). Both RR and RoS did not correlate with country population size. In
addition, there was no significant difference between country population size in “cold” climate
and “warm” climate countries. Finally, the number of COVID-19 tests taken may affect disease

detection and thus may confound RR and RoS. However, we did not find a significant
correlation between COVID-19 RR and RoS and the number of tests or the number of tests per
1000 persons. Neither was the number of tests taken significantly different between “cold” and
“warm” climate countries.
Finally, we conducted an additional analysis, of intra-country correlation, within the USA
between climate parameters and RR/RoS. Given the lag of disease spread in the USA, as of
March, 19,2020 the cumulative patient number was limited. The RR and RoS for the USA are
calculated based on limited data and this analysis was conducted aiming at future tracking on
climate outbreak dynamics in the USA using the study’s dashboard as the number of cumulative
cases is dynamically evolving (Supplementary Table 2). As of March 19, 2020, we did not find
significant correlations between RR and RoS with any of the climate parameters evaluated
(Supplementary Table 3 and 4).

Discussion
In this study we analyzed the spread rate of the novel COVID-19 pandemic in relation to climate
variables. We identified a significant moderate negative correlation between the rate of COVID19 RR and RoS and increasing temperature and dew point. Furthermore, by dichotomizing
countries into “warm” and “cold” climate (based on predefined average March temperature
</>15 degrees Celsius and latitude) categories we identified a significantly lower RR and RoS in
warm climate countries compared with cold climate countries. These findings persisted
irrespective of whether Italy was included in our analysis or not, whether we used country
dichotomization by climate criteria or included all countries irrespective of climate
classification. Intra-State analysis of American (USA) data did not identify a significant
correlation Our results were devised by developing an online surveillance tool (available at

https://covid19.net.technion.ac.il/) coupling continuously updated COVID 19 data (available at
the CCSE website20) with climate variables . We hope this tool will aid healthcare providers and
policymakers in dynamically tracking the disease and tailoring the mitigation steps designed to
slow down COVID-19 spread.
Knowledge on COVID-19 RR and RoS is sparse and interpretation is complex as
it can be affected by a multitude of regional/national factors including amongst others, age
distribution, cultural habits, testing & screening strategies, applied mitigation measures as well
as local policy regarding administered care21. We found that the climate variable beside
temperature, with the strongest correlation to RR and RoS was dew point, whereas precipitation,
humidity and wind-speed did not appear to be significantly related to RR and RoS (Figure 4 and
5). Dew point temperature was previously shown to strongly associate with respiratory viruses
spread rate and was recently found to explain approximately one third of the variation in
transmission of enteroviruses across USA22,23. The dew point depends on both temperature and
humidity and it is defined as the temperature to which air must be cooled at constant pressure for
saturation to occur. Dew point may influence evaporation of aerosols containing COVID-19.
Doubling time in our assessment was only marginally different between warm and cold
countries, due to the high variance in RoS in warm countries.
Animal studies have suggested much lower transmission rates of influenza virus in high
humidity and/or high temperature conditions24.Our findings of lower RR and RoS in warm
climate may suggest that the seasonal climate variation will influence disease spread dynamics
globally in the coming months. Colder temperatures may provide better conditions for virus
survival outside the human body, with longer viral viability on contaminated surfaces and
fomites. The SARS-CoV survives longer in colder and less humid conditions on contaminated

surfaces25. In preliminary findings, Bannister Tyrrell et al have demonstrated that higher average
temperature was strongly associated with lower COVID-19 incidence26.
We developed this interactive online surveillance tool that tracks the correlation between
the global climate parameters and COVID-19 as a service to leadership, healthcare providers and
the general public. It is readily reproducible, updates virtually online and enables examination of
the correlation between the various climate variables and COVID-19 replication rate over time.
The code was written using the Jupyter notebook environment via Google Colaboratory enabling
researchers from countries with lesser available computing resources to run and execute their
version of the code freely in the cloud. We hope it will serve healthcare organizations and
leadership in deciding which mitigation steps to further take while also accounting for climatic
alterations.
The COVID-19 outbreak occurred during the winter season mostly in the northern
hemisphere and the correlation of outbreak spread rate and climate is continuously studied. A
recent study pinpointed to the observation that several regions with COVID-19 outbreaks
occurred within the same latitude range, in areas with low temperatures and high humidity as of
March 5, 202010. A preliminary clue for a possible association between temperature and COVID19 was reported online from Bannister-Tyrrell et al.27 Our results in the current study may
strengthen the rationale to further assess the association between climate parameters and
COVID-19 outbreak spread rate. Given the preliminary association identified in our study as
well as by others, between the latter parameters, we advocate for prospective surveillance of
disease trajectories in relation to contemporary climate data.
There are several strengths in our findings. Our data is updated through March 19 2020,
by which many countries imposed international restrictions, ensuring that our findings are more

representative of local spread rather than imported cases. Moreover, we chose to look at data
beyond patient 30 (for countries and USA states), further ensuring that the diagnosed cases are
from local spread. We demonstrated that average temperature as well as dew point, were
negatively correlated with the RR and RoS in the worldwide analysis. Twenty four countries
were included in our analysis which aids in generalizing these findings worldwide as the
pandemic rages on. In addition, we demonstrated that potential confounders such as the
population size, the number of tests and the number of tests/1000 persons did not significantly
correlate with RR or RoS. Finally, our results are easily reproducible and the developed tool will
help track the dynamic changes and reassess the correlation between climate and disease spread
in the future.
The current study has several limitations. Different mitigation steps were undertaken by
each included country during different times affecting the spread of COVID 19 in ways we
cannot account for. However, since these mitigation steps have a lag period of approximately14
days (based on the virus incubation time) they may only marginally affect our analysis. Also, as
most of our “cold” climate countries are located in Europe, it important to note that ground travel
within the European Union was unrestricted until very recently, a variable which may increase
the imported spread rate. The lack of standardized criteria for diagnostic testing for COVID-19
between countries affects the incidence and cumulative count. Be that as it may, number of tests
performed in each country did not correlate with the RR and RoS. We used the climate
parameters of the capital city of each country (and state in the USA) to represent each country in
its entirety in order to calculate the RR and RoS as more detailed locations of COVID-19
diagnoses in each country were not available to us, thus local spread within the country was not
accounted for . An additional limitation that may warrant further research is the reliance on

historical average temperatures. Further research and update of the surveillance tool will allow
tracing these dynamic trends in relation with real-time temperature and the appropriate time lag
consistent with COVID-19 incubation period. Finally, our results might further be confounded
by the varied socioeconomic status of the participating countries as well as social context.
COVID-19 RR and RoS are affected by a multitude of factors. As the pandemic is
spreading across the world with an alarmingly increasing toll of diagnosed cases as well as
deaths, our findings of decreased RR and RoS in warm climates may suggest that the inevitable
seasonal variance will alter the dynamic of the disease spread in both hemispheres in the coming
months. However, we warrant a cautious interpretation of these findings given the fact that we
are in the initial steps of this outbreak in many “warm” climate countries, the high variance of
the data and the dynamic changes in the disease surveillance and the lack of correlation based on
the limited data in the US. The current evidence from our study, does not justify any
modification of governmental mitigation strategies in countries with warm climates. We hope
that the online tool coupling COVID-19 data with climate data will assist in tracking the disease
and tailoring the needed measures to contain it.
