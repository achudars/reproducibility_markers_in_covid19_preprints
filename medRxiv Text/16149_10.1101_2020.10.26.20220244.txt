ABSTRACT

21

Aged population with comorbidities demonstrated high mortality rate and severe clinical

22

outcome in the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, whether age-

23

adjusted Charlson comorbidity index score (CCIS) predict fatal outcomes remains uncertain.

24

This retrospective, nationwide cohort study was performed to evaluate patient mortality and

25

clinical outcome according to CCIS among the hospitalized patients with COVID-19

26

infection. We included 5,621 patients who had been discharged from isolation or had died

27

from COVID-19 by April 30, 2020. The primary outcome was composites of death,

28

admission to intensive care unit (ICU), use of mechanical ventilator or extracorporeal

29

membrane oxygenation. The secondary outcome was mortality. Multivariate Cox

30

proportional hazard model was used to evaluate CCIS as the independent risk factor for death.

31

Among 5,621 patients, the high CCIS (≥3) group showed higher proportion of elderly

32

population and lower plasma hemoglobin and lower lymphocyte and platelet counts. The

33

high CCIS group was an independent risk factor for composite outcome (HR 3.63, 95% CI

34

2.45-5.37, P < 0.001) and patient mortality (HR 22.96, 95% CI 7.20-73.24, P < 0.001). The

35

nomogram demonstrated that the CCIS was the most potent predictive factor for patient

36

mortality. The predictive nomogram using CCIS for the hospitalized patients with COVID-19

37

may help clinicians to triage the high-risk population and to concentrate limited resources to

38

manage them.

INTRODUCTION

40

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared as a pandemic by the

41

World Health Organization in March 20201, and as of July 31, 2020, 16,864,828 people have

42

been affected by the virus and 663,580 deaths were reported worldwide2. The Korean Centers

43

for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) and relevant organization prepared policies for

44

management for the COVID-19 outbreak as soon as the first case of COVID-19 was reported

45

in Korea3. The Korean government not only performed extensive confirmatory tests for those

46

who are suspected to have the disease but also implemented strict social distancing to prevent

47

further transmission of disease. As the results, mild cases among young and healthy

48

population were diagnosed as COVID-19 by screening tests but subsequent case fatality rate

49

revealed lower than those reported worldwide. As of July 31, there were 14,269 confirmed

50

cases of COVID-19 and 300 deaths in Korea (case fatality rate of 2.1% in Korea vs. 3.9% in

51

average worldwide)4.

52

Nevertheless, there were some population with higher morbidity and mortality during

53

COVID-19 outbreak. The situation reports from KCDC demonstrated that higher mortality

54

among the patients with advanced age4. It is reasonable to think that the patients with

55

advanced age show higher mortality because of reduced immunity and higher comorbidities

56

such as diabetes or chronic kidney disease. Previous reports suggested old age and multiple

57

comorbidities are independently associated with higher mortality5-7. However, most of the

58

studies demonstrated individual category of disease such as diabetes or coronary heart disease

59

as a risk factor but not weighted the effect of age and severity of multimorbidity as predictors

60

of poor clinical outcomes.

61

Age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index score (CCIS) has been developed and

62

validated to predict the risk of mortality for use in longitudinal studies8. The score can be

63

calculated from a weighted index consisted of age and the number and seriousness of

64

comorbid diseases. The CCIS has been widely used to predict 10-year mortality among

65

hospitalized patients8. The CCIS also has been validated in a various disease conditions such

66

as acute stroke9,10, leukemia11, end stage renal disease12,13, and hip fracture14,15.

67

Recently, KCDC released COVID-19 database to the public. The database contains the

68

clinical and epidemiologic data of 5,628 confirmed cases as well as their clinical outcome

69

until April 30, 2020. We evaluated patient mortality and clinical outcome according to CCIS

70

among the hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Korea.

72

RESULTS

73

Baseline characteristics of the Korean COVID-19 cohort

74

The baseline characteristics of 5,621 patients are shown in Table 1. The mean duration from

75

diagnosis to death or release from isolation was 25.6 days. The patients in 50s was the largest

76

age group followed by those in 20s (Figure 1). The 3,304 (58.8%) patients were female.

77

Female was predominant throughout all age groups except those younger than 20.

78

Hypertension (21.3%) and diabetes mellitus (12.3%) were the most common two

79

comorbidities. It was followed by dementia (4.2%), chronic heart disease (3.2%), malignancy

80

(2.5%), asthma (2.3%), chronic liver disease (1.5%), congestive heart failure (1.0%), chronic

81

kidney disease (1.0%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0.7%), and connective tissue

82

disease (0.7%) (Figure 1). The patients with low systolic blood pressure (BP) (<120mmHg)

83

and diastolic BP (<80mmHg) were 1317 (24.0%) and 2113 (38.5%), respectively. Among

84

5621 confirmed cases, asymptomatic infection comprised of 25.8%. Among symptomatic

85

patients, three most common symptoms were cough (41.7%), sputum (28.8%), and febrile

86

sense (23.2%).

87

The median score of CCIS was 2 (IQR, 0-3). The number of patients in CCIS score 0, 1-2, 3-

88

4, ≥5 group was 1,890 (33.6%), 1,791 (31.9%), 1,399 (24.9%), and 541 (9.6%), respectively.

89

Compared to the low CCIS group (<3), the high CCIS group (≥3) showed higher proportion

90

of elderly patients and medical comorbidities. Presence of dyspnea, altered mentality, and

91

nausea/vomiting at admission were more frequent in the high CCIS group. In addition, the

92

number of lymphocyte and platelet count and plasma hemoglobin (Hb) level were

93

significantly lower in high CCIS group compared to low CCIS group.

94
95

Clinical outcomes according to CCIS

96

Composite events occurred in 368 patients (6.6 %) during the follow up period including 234

97

(4.2 %) deaths, 187 (3.3 %) admission cases of intensive care unit (ICU), 52 (0.9 %) cases of

98

mechanical ventilation, and 11 (0.2%) cases of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation

99

(ECMO) application. The composite outcomes occurred more frequently in high CCIS

100

groups showing 178 patients (32.9 %) in CCIS ≥5 followed by 135 (9.7%) in CCIS 3-4, 36

101

(2.0%) in CCIS 1-2, and 19 (1.0%) in CCIS 0 (Table 2). The mortality rate was also higher in

102

high CCIS groups demonstrating 154 patients (28.5%) in CCIS ≥5 followed by 68 (4.9%) in

103

CCIS 3-4, 11 (0.6%) in CCIS 1-2, and 1 (0.1%) in CCIS 0 (Figure 2).

109

< 0.001), body mass index (BMI) <18.5 kg/m2 (HR, 2.36 [95% CI 1.49–3.75], P < 0.001),

110

presence of dyspnea (HR, 2.88 [95% CI 2.16–3.83], P < 0.001), lymphopenia (HR, 2.15 [95%

111

CI 1.59-2.91], P < 0.001), and anemia (HR, 1.80 [95% CI 1.33-2.43], P < 0.001) (See Figure

112

3 and Supplementary Table S1 online).

113

Then, we analyzed the risk factors for mortality (see Supplementary Figure S1 online). The

114

patients older than 70 years old demonstrated higher mortality risk compared younger

115

patients. The patients with high CCIS ≥3 also showed higher risk for mortality compared to

116

low CCIS group. When we assessed the risk factors for mortality in univariate analysis, old

117

age ≥70 years, male sex, high CCIS ≥3, anemia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia were

118

significantly associated with higher mortality rate. In multivariate Cox proportional analysis,

119

risk of mortality was higher in patients with CCIS ≥3 (HR, 22.96 [95% CI 7.20 - 73.24], P <

120

0.001), male sex (HR, 1.55 [95% CI 1.05–2.29], P = 0.027), BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 (HR, 2.88 [95%

121

CI 1.66–4.99], P < 0.001), presence of dyspnea (HR, 2.90 [95% CI 1.96–4.29], P < 0.001),

122

lymphopenia (HR, 2.61 [95% CI 1.75-3.89], P < 0.001), anemia (HR, 2.08 [95% CI 1.40-

123

DISCUSSION

137

In this study, we described the effect of age and comorbidity upon composites of severe

138

clinical outcomes (death, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or ECMO) among the

139

hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The patients with high CCIS showed older age, lower

140

plasma level of Hb, and lower lymphocyte and platelet counts. The high CCIS (≥3) group

141

was an independent risk factors for composite outcome (HR 3.63, 95% CI 2.45-5.37,

142

p<0.0001) and patient mortality (HR 7.05, 95% CI 2.13-23.33, p=0.0014).

143

Korean COVID-19 cohort demonstrated large proportion of younger population with age <50

144

(34.7%) and asymptomatic confirmed cases (25.7%). The patients without any comorbidities

145

(CCIS 0) comprised of 33.1% of total population. Median CCIS was 2 for the Korean

146

COVID-19 cohort. Previous report from Wuhan, China demonstrated higher proportion of

147

younger population with age <50 (56.0%) as well as greater proportion of the patients

148

without any comorbidities (76.3%)16. The brief report from Danish population also

149

demonstrated that higher proportion of confirmed cases without any comorbidities (CCIS 0,

150

65.0%)17. On the other hands, previous papers from United States of America demonstrated

151

higher proportion of older people (mean age of 61.0) and lower proportion of the patients

152

without existing comorbidities (27.4%)18. In Italy where one of the highest case fatality rates

153

were reported, the non-survivor demonstrated advanced age (79.6±0.9 years vs. 64.7±0.4

154

years, p=0.0001) and higher CCIS (4.3±0.15 vs. 2.6±0.05, p=0.0001) compared to survivors5.

155

The observed differences of baseline characteristics among various countries may be related

156

not only to patient demographics but also the degree of performing active screening tests

157

against asymptomatic population.

158

Our study is the first large nationwide cohort study to demonstrate that CCIS is the best

159

predictor for severe clinical outcome in the patients with COVID-19. Previous paper by Chen

160

et al. demonstrated that advanced age is the strongest risk factor for a fatal outcome6. In

161

addition to advanced age, preexisting comorbid conditions including coronary heart disease

162

and cerebrovascular disease, shortness of breath, and levels of procalcitonin and aspartate

163

aminotransferase were related to fatal outcome. However, previous study by Zhou et al.

164

presented only advanced age but not comorbidity was an independent risk factor for

165

mortality19. Another study by Ji et al. also evaluated the risk factors for progression risk of

166

pneumonia in COVID-19 patients20. They showed that presence of comorbidities and

167

advanced age both contribute to higher risk of disease progression. Korean group also

168

recently published the paper about the impact of comorbidities upon the mortality7,21.

169

However, these studies did not use CCIS to calculate the weight of the comorbidities. There

170

were several studies suggesting CCIS as an independent risk factor for hospitalization or

171

patient mortality among the patients with COVID-1917,18,22. However, to our knowledge,

172

there was no study showing prediction model of fatal outcome using CCIS.

173

In the same vein with previous studies, the advanced age >50 years old demonstrated high

174

risk of mortality and ICU admission. The previous study performed by Sung et al. showed

175

relatively young patients under age 50 recovered without oxygen therapy or ICU care23. On

176

the other hands, the patients of ≥50 years of age demonstrated high case fatality rate reaching

177

14% in the patients over 80 years old. Our study also confirmed that advanced age itself is an

178

independent factor for composites of severe clinical outcome.

179

There are some limitations to our study. First, the nationwide database from KCDC only

180

offered limited data. For example, there are no information about chest radiograph findings or

181

laboratory findings such as C-reactive protein or serum creatinine. Therefore, we could not

182

adjust potential risk factors in our study. Second, due to the nature of survey without

183

collecting actual previous medical history from ICD-10 diagnosis code, some information

184

about comorbidities are missing. Therefore, we modified some categories of chronic illness

185

included in the original CCIS. For example, we scored all forms of coronary artery disease

186

including myocardial infarction and chronic heart disease with a score of 1. Previous report

187

also demonstrated the usefulness of modified form of CCIS in prediction of clinical outcome

188

in renal patients24. In addition, the information about some chronic conditions such as

189

peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease or peptic ulcer disease were missing. We

190

calculated CCIS based on the available data excluding those categories of missing data.

191

Therefore, CCIS in our cohort may be underestimated than actual CCIS. Lastly, there can be

192

ethnic or racial difference in clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Therefore, our result may not

193

be applicated to the different ethnicity or population. However, recent paper suggested that

194

racial difference did not contribute to different clinical outcome22. Nevertheless, there should

195

be a validation test in each population using our predictive tool before clinical application.

196

In conclusion, our study provided convenient predictive tool using CCIS for the hospitalized

197

patients with COVID-19 to calculate the risk of severe clinical outcome at admission. The

198

CCIS together with initial symptom and laboratory findings may lead us to triage the patients

199

most likely to progress and concentrate our efforts to save their lives.

METHODS

202

Study design and participants

203

This is a retrospective cohort study using the nationwide COVID-19 database provided by

204

KCDC. A total of 5,628 patients were included in the database who had been confirmed to

205

have COVID-19 and had received treatment from 100 hospitals until April 30, 2020. Among

206

them, 7 patients who were confirmed for COVID-19 after death were excluded, and a total of

207

5,621 patients were included in the analysis. According to the definition provided by the

208

KCDC25, the confirmed case was defined as a patient who had been confirmed to be infected

209

with COVID-19 by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay or virus

210

isolation from nasal and/or pharyngeal swab specimens regardless of the clinical symptoms.

211

The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the

212

Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, Seoul, Korea (HKS 2020-06-025). The informed consent

213

was waived due to retrospective nature of the study.

214
215

Data collection

216

Clinical and epidemiological data were collected in a retrospective manner and were

217

anonymized before release. Demographic data including age by decade, sex, survival status,

218

and duration of isolation were collected. Information about whether the patient was admitted

219

to ICU or applied mechanical ventilator or ECMO were also collected. The BMI, systolic and

220

diastolic BP, heart rate, and body temperature at initial visit were also measured and reported.

221

The clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 were reported including febrile sense,

222

cough, sputum, sore throat, rhinorrhea, myalgia, shortness of breath, headache, altered

223

consciousness/confusion, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea. Laboratory assessments consisted of

224

plasma Hb, white blood cell, lymphocyte, and platelet count. The categories of comorbidities

225

were assessed including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure, chronic heart disease,

226

asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy, chronic

227

liver disease, connective tissue disease, and dementia. The CCIS was calculated using the

228

method described in the previous study8,24. Due to lack of available data, all kinds of chronic

229

heart disease were considered to have congestive heart failure and all forms of chronic liver

230

disease were considered to have mild liver disease. The presence of peripheral vascular

231

disease, cerebrovascular disease, peptic ulcer disease, hemiplegia, end-stage renal disease, or

232

acquired immunodeficiency syndrome could not be known from the current database. All

233

kinds of malignancy were considered non-metastatic.

234
235

Study outcomes

236

The primary endpoint was defined as the composite of death, admission to ICU, application

237

of mechanical ventilation or ECMO. The secondary endpoints were patient mortality and

238

ICU admission rate. The primary and secondary endpoints were compared between low and

239

high CCIS groups. Finally, we established a prediction model for patient mortality through

240

risk factor analysis.

241
242

Statistical Analysis

243

The baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared among CCIS groups. We

244

divided the patients into 4 groups according to CCIS: CCIS 0, 1-2, 3-4, and ≥5. The normally

245

distributed numerical variables were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation, whereas

246

variables with skewed distributions were expressed as the median and interquartile range.

247

Statistical comparisons between continuous variables were performed with an independent

248

Student t-test or one-way analysis of variance for more than two group. For the data without

249

normal distribution, the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test for two groups or Kruskal Wallis Test for

250

more than two groups were performed. The χ2 test and Fisher exact test were applied to

251

categorical variables as appropriate.

252

The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare composite events-free survival curves, and

253

differences were assessed utilizing the log-rank test. We used univariate and multivariate Cox

254

proportional hazard model to estimate risk factors associated with composite outcome and

255

patient mortality. Age was excluded from the multivariate analysis because of its potential

256

interaction with CCIS. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to

257

evaluate the risk factors for ICU admission or use of mechanical ventilation. We used

258

categorical variables to assess independent risk factors for clinical outcomes as follows: age

259

group of <50 (reference), 50-69, and ≥70 years, female (reference) vs. male, BMI ≥18.5

260

A nomogram to predict 14-day and 28-day mortality risk of the patient was built based on the

266

variables found in multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. In the nomogram, CCIS was

267

used as a variable as a continuous variable to check the impact per CCIS. The maximum

score of each variable was set as 100. The performance of the nomogram was measured

269

based on the C-index. The nomogram was validated in calibration plots with 1,000 bootstrap

270

samples in which the estimated survival probability was compared with the observed value.

271

All statistical analysis was performed by using R version 4.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical
