Abstract

40

Importance

41

Novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected nearly half a billion people across the world and is

42

highly contagious. There is a need for a novel mechanism to block viral entry and stop its

43

replication.

44

Background

45

Spike protein N terminal domain (NTD) of the novel SARS-CoV-2 is essential for viral entry

46

and replication in human cell. Thus the S1 NTD of human coronavirus family, which is

47

similar to a galectin binding site - human galactose binding lectins, is a potential novel target

48

for early treatment in COVID-19.

49

Objectives

50

To study the feasibility of performing a definitive trial of using galectin antagonist –

51

Prolectin-M as treatment for mild, symptomatic, rRT-PCR positive, COVID-19.

52

Main outcomes and measures

53

Cycle threshold (Ct) value is number of cycles needed to express fluorescence, on real time

54

reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Ct values expressed for RNA polymerase

55

(Rd/RP) gene +Nucleocapsid gene and the small envelope (E) genes determine infectivity of

56

the individual. A digital droplet PCR based estimation of the Nucleocapid genes (N1+N2) in

57

absolute copies/μL determines active viral replication.

58

Design and intervention

59

Pilot Feasibility Randomised Controlled Open-Label, parallel arm, study. Oral tablets of

60

Prolectin-M were administered along with the best practice, Standard of Care (SoC) and

61

compared against SoC. Voluntarily, consenting individuals, age >18 years, and able to

62

provide frequent nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were randomly allocated by

63

REDCap software.

64

The intervention, Prolectin-M was administered as a multi dose regime of 4 gram tablets.

65

Each tablet contained 2 grams of (1-6)-Alpha-D-mannopyranosil mixed with 2 grams of

66

dietary fibre. Each participant took a single chewable tablet every hour, to a maximum of 10

67

hours in a day. Tablets were administered only during the daytime, for total of 5 days.

68

Results

69

This pilot trial demonstrated the feasibility to recruit and randomize participants. By day 7,

70

following treatment with Prolectin-M, Ct value of Rd/Rp + N gene increased by16.41 points,

71

95% (CI – 0.3527 to 32.48, p=0.047). Similarly, small envelope (E) gene also increased by

72

17.75 points (95% CI;-0.1321 to 35.63, p = 0.05). The expression of N1, N2 genes went

73

below detectable thresholds by day 3 (Mann Whitney U = 0.000, p<0.029).

74

rRT-PCR testing done in the clinic on day 1, 7, and 14 had 3 participants (60%) turn negative

75

by day 7 and all turned negative by day 14 and stayed negative until day 28. In the SoC group

76

2 participants had zero detectable viral loads at baseline, 2 participants tested negative on day

77

14, and the last participant tested remained positive on day 28. There were no serious

78

adverse events, and all participants were clinically asymptomatic before day 28 with reactive

79

immunoglobulin G (IgG).

80

Trial relevance

81

This pilot study proves that it is feasible and safe to perform a trial using a Galectin

82

antagonist in COVID-19. This is a novel mechanism for blocking viral entry and its

83

subsequent replication.

Introduction

89

SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 40 million people worldwide and is responsible for over 1.1

90

million deaths.1 Several treatments have been authorized by regulators around the globe and

91

none of them have been able to lower its infectivity.2 SARS-CoV-2, a new member of the

92

coronaviruses known to infect humans,3 is a single-stranded RNA-enveloped virus, with a

93

large number of glycosylated S proteins covering its surface.4 These proteins mediate viral

94

cell entry following a S protein binding on host cell surface.5

95

During viral infection, the target cells activate the S protein, by cleaving it into S1 and S2

96

subunits.6 The S1 subunit is further divided into a N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-

97

terminal domain (CTD). The CTD is known to bind the human angiotensin converting

98

enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors while NTD seeks gangliosides on cell surface to stabilize cell

99

adhesion.7,8

100

SARS-CoV-2 belong to betacoronaviridae family, which includes mouse hepatitis

101

coronavirus (MHV). The S1-NTD structure, described in the mouse hepatitis coronavirus

102

(MHV), demonstrates a similar structural fold as the human galactose binding lectins

103

(galectins).9 Galectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins, involved in many physiological

104

functions, such as inflammation, immune responses, cell migration, autophagy and

105

signalling.10 They are also involved immunogenicity, i.e. cell recognition, between human

106

cells and infective pathogens; viruses, bacteria, and parasites.11

107

Prolectin – M is an orally administered polysaccharide. Polysaccharides competitively bind

108

to the N-terminal tail of human galectin-3 through a proline isomerization.12 Galetin-3 (Gal-

109

3) is 1 among the 15 galectins described in humans and also a ubiquitous human galectin

110

expressed in various disease pathogenesis pathways.13,14 The objective of this trial is to

111

demonstrate the feasibility of a large randomised controlled clinical trial, and a possible

112

mechanism of action for galectin antagonists as treatment in COVID-19.

113

Viral culture studies of SARS-CoV-215 indicate, that date of onset of symptoms and cycle

114

threshold levels relate to infectivity; a cycle threshold of <25 is considered to be infectious.16

115

17

116

reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) product, to cross a determined

117

threshold.

118

Most rRT-PCR approved kits, report Ct values for the RNA dependent RNA polymerase

119

(Rd/Rp), envelope (E) protein and nucleocapsid genes. All three genes are reported together

120

for higher sensitivity. The droplet digital PCR measures expression of only nucleocapsid

121

genes (N1&N2) as an absolute number in copies/uL.18 We hypothesized that blocking S1

122

NTD using a galectin antagonist can affect viral replication in nasopharyngeal,

123

oropharyngeal, gastrointestinal tract, and potentially clear the virus from the person to make

124

them non-infectious in a shorter time.19

125

For this pilot study we considered a rising number in the Ct values, along with a reduction in

126

the number of copies/µL of the nucleocapsid gene as a measure of our endpoint. However, in

127

future clinical trials Prolectin-M should be tested using an endpoint that measures the effect

128

on time to recovery in days as well as the reduction of infectivity.20,21 A galectin antagonist

129

could treat COVID-19 patients early in the disease pathogenesis and prevent spread of

130

SARS-CoV-2 within the community.22

REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-based software platform

138

designed to support data capture for research studies, providing 1) an intuitive interface for

139

validated data capture; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3)

140

automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages;

141

and 4) procedures for data integration and interoperability with external sources.

142

This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010

143

extension to randomized pilot and feasibility trials.25 The study was registered at

144

clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04512027) and the Clinical Trials Registry of India

145

(CTRI/2020/09/027833). Study protocol and all documents were reviewed by Institutional

146

Ethics Committee – Narayana Health and approved (NHMEC Ref. No. S44/ 2020), on 31st of

147

August 2020. The study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the

148

Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and local regulatory requirements.

149

Before enrolment and allocation to the study arms, informed consent for participation in the

150

study was obtained in writing from all participants. The participant also signed a form,

151

declaring that they received the correct information and gave informed consent for voluntary

152

participation in the trial, before being randomized.

153

Participants

154

This single center trial enrolled hospitalized, eligible, and consenting participants between the

155

ages of 18 and 45. All patients had to have an instrumental diagnosis for COVID-19; a

156

positive rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 obtained from an outpatient collection of

157

nasopharyngeal swabs. Other inclusion criteria were the presence of symptoms that were not

158

older than 72 hours and an ability to provide consent to undergo repeated collection of throat

159

and nasal swabs over the 7-day period. Samples were collected pre randomization, during

160

drug administration on days 3 and 5 and 7.

161

Exclusion criteria included oxygen saturation at admission ≤96%, high temperature ≥1000 F

162

(≥37.50C) not controlled on oral doses of acetaminophen, known history of diabetes on oral

163

medications or insulin therapy or interleukin-6 levels ≥ 3times of laboratory reference range

164

and / or significantly elevated levels of CRP, serum ferritin or d-dimer or a Lymphocyte /

165

monocyte ratio ≤3 or neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio ≥5 or platelet count ≤150,000 cells per

166

microliter. Previously tested positive and recovered for SARS-CoV-2. Also participants on

167

any chronic medications for more than 4 weeks before randomization or active malignancy or

168

having any co-morbidity that increases risk of rapid disease progression were excluded.

169

Objectives

170

The primary aim was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and feasibility of administering

171

Prolectin-M versus the SoC for 5 days. The primary endpoint was a change in absolute count

172

of Nucleocapsid gene and a rising Ct value, estimated from serial samples of RNA extracted

173

from a nasopharyngeal swab. The swab was collected in all participants on days 1 (day of

174

randomisation), 3, 5, and 7. Clinical progression was estimated on a 7-point scale recorded on

175

days 7, 21, and 28. A 2-point change was defined as clinical progression.

176

7-point severity score (ordinal scale):

177

1. Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities

178

2. Not hospitalized, limitation on activities.

179

3. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen.

180

4. Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen.

181

5. Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices.

Randomization and Treatments

186

Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a 4 gram tablet of Prolectin-M; a

187

(1-6)-Alpha-D-Mannopyranose, and SoC (Treatment group) or SoC (Control group) via a

188

web-based secure centralized system (REDCap). An independent statistician provided a

189

computer-generated assignment randomization list and blocked with varying block sizes

190

unknown to the investigators.

191

Prolectin-M was administered orally once every hour up to a maximum dose through the day

192

of 40 grams or 10 tablets a day. The intention was to mimic the viral replication cycle of 8 –

193

10 hours26 and also to ensure that the participant is consuming the tablets during the day

194

under supervision of a research nurse. Each subject was encouraged to keep the tablet in their

195

mouth for 1- 2 minutes before it dissolved and swallowed. During a mealtime, breakfast,

196

lunch, tea, and dinner, the subject had to wait for 30 minutes after the last meal before taking

197

the next tablet. This was to avoid any potential drop in blood glucose as the tablets could

198

block absorption of carbohydrates consumed in the meal.

199

Procedures

200

Patient follow up was maintained for 28 days from the day of randomisation. A sample was

201

considered negative when no Ct value was determined, and no amplification curve was

202

observed or if the Ct value was >29 for all three targets.

203

A nasopharyngeal / oropharyngeal swab was transported to the research laboratory for RNA

204

extraction in a viral transport media (#MG20VTM-3, MagGenome). All RNA extractions

205

were carried out using the QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit (# 52904, Qiagen) following the

206

standard instructions as per the kit protocol.

207

For each blinded sample the Ct value for Rd/Rp and N, E gene, genes were reported.

208

rRT PCR: The extracted RNA was analysed on a rRT PCR platform: TRUPCR® SARS-

209

CoV-2 RT qPCR KITV2 (#3B3043B BlackBio Biotech) SARS-CoV-2. To determine the

210

efficiency of the PCR, Ct values obtained from a series of 5 template DNA dilutions of at

211

least 3 different samples were graphed on the y-axis versus the log of the dilution on the x-

212

axis.The Ct values assumed by the following equation were employed to calculate the

213

logarithm of the recombinant gene copy numbers from: Ct= slope × log (Gene

214

Copy Number) +1 where I in the formula acts as the intercept of standard curve.27

215

Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR): The RNA was also analysed on the

216

Droplet Digital PCR (BioRad, USA). This platform is FDA approved for emergency use

217

authorization in COVID-19.18 The test is a partition-based endpoint single well RT-PCR test.

218

The ddPCR was combined with rRT PCR because of its higher sensitivity and precision in

219

low viral abundance samples and for the ability to provide absolute copy numbers and any

220

resistance to inhibition often seen in rRT-PCR testing.

221

The analytic sensitivity was calculated as 0.260 cp/µl to 0.351 cp/µl (cp = copies) for genetic

222

markers,SARS-CoV-2N1andN2genes, and an internal control human RPP30

223

gene. The laboratory remained blind to treatment allocation throughout the analysis. On day

224

28, all participants were tested for serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin G

225

(IgG) titres (values ≥1.00 as reactive) using VITROS® COVID-19 antibody tests.28

226

Adverse events were recorded from time of signature of informed consent and graded

227

according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0.29 Causality

228

was assessed by the investigators for any serious adverse events.

229

Statistical Analysis

230

Only 10 subjects were randomised and no formal sample estimation was done. Ct values and

231

absolute copy numbers were compared using parametric, unpaired repeated t test with

232

Welch’s correction or non-parametric Mann Whitney U test. A two-tailed, p<0.05, was

233

considered statistically significant.

234

Results

235

All 10 participants were included for final analysis. All participants consented and were

236

randomised within 2 days of their symptom onset. All patients allocated to treatment arm

237

received their medications. Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics are summarized

in Table 1. 8/10 participants were female with a median (range) age of 27.5 (39, 25) years. In

239

the control arm 3 patients did not have detectable viral RNA, when tested in the research lab.

240

Table 2 shows changes that occurred over the follow up period. All treated participants

241

showed rising Ct values from day 3. Difference in mean change in Ct values for the Rd/Rp &

242

N genes, between treated and control group, was 16.41 (95% CI – 0.3527 to 32.48, p=0.047,

243

Welch’s t test, two tailed). Difference in Ct values of E gene, 17.75 (95% CI;-0.1321 to

244

35.63, p = 0.05, unpaired t test with Welch’s correction, 2 tailed). Figures 2a & 2b show

245

estimation plots for differences seen in Ct values. Figure 3 shows the change in copies/µL of

246

the nucleocapsid (N1+N2) gene. A Mann Whitney test indicated that the drop in copy

247

numbers among the treated participants was significant compared to the control group; U =

248

0.000, p<0.029. Individual patient wise change in absolute copy numbers is shown in

249

supplementary figure panels.

250

rRT-PCR testing done in the clinic on day 1, 7, and 14 and had 3 participants (60%) turn

251

negative by day 7 and all turned negative by day 14 and stayed negative until day 28. In the

252

SoC group 2 participants had zero detectable viral loads at baseline, 2 participants tested

253

negative on day 14, and the last participant tested remained positive on day 28.

254

None of the participants experienced any serious adverse event. One participant in the

255

treatment arm had Grade 1 diarrheal episode (CTAE ver. 5.0). No intervention was need, but

256

Prolectin-M was reduced to 5 tablets per day. All participants were fit for discharge on day

257

14 and with no restrictions except for 2 subjects in the control arm, who tested positive even

258

on day 14. No one had re admission when followed up at day 21 and 28.

259

Discussion

260

This is the first ever reported randomised controlled trial of a galectin antagonist against

261

SARS-CoV-2. Blocking N terminal domain (NTD) of S1 subunit, present on spike protein, is

262

seen to have significantly lowered viral gene expression. All five participants in treatment

263

group demonstrated a rapid drop by day 3 in copies/µL of Nucleocapsid protein gene.

264

A higher Ct value correlates with lower risk of infectiousness, as reported from a cohort in

265

England{ref}, There was rise in Ct >29, for genes, Rd/Rp, N and E genes in the treated

266

group. However, participants in control group (001 & 007), remained potentially infective

267

even on day 7 and day 14.

268

The detection of anti-spike protein IgG on day 28, is an expression of humoral response

269

against the virus.30 The N protein is highly immunogenic compared to the S protein and in the

270

absence of glycosylation sites on it results in N-specific neutralizing antibody production

271

early in the stage of acute infection. All participants in the active arm of the trial had a

272

reactive IgG. This trial achieved its primary objective of demonstrating the effect of

273

Prolectin-M on lowering viral infectiousness. The method used to recruit and randomize

274

patients, enabled safe administration of the oral drug which demonstrated an ability to block

275

viral replication.

276

Strengths of this study are randomisation, concealed allocation, and one hundred percent

277

compliance to treatment, and all procedures in the protocol. There was no incidence of any

278

serious adverse events. A higher cut off value for either cycle threshold or copy numbers on

279

ddPCR as an eligibility criteria could have demonstrated a more significant treatment effect.

280

Hence future trials will need to use either a pre-determined lower (<16) baseline Ct value or a

281

higher copy number for ddPCR.

282

Galectin antagonists can potentially prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells.19 A larger

283

clinical trial will give us the evidence needed to understand its true clinical benefit. Due to

284

the excellent safety profile of galectin antagonists, additional methods of delivery, such as an

285

intravenous, or subcutaneous injection should be examined for a reduction in the number of

286

systemically expressed copies of the virus. In addition, Prolectin-M could be very effective as

287

a prophylactic to stop the community spread of the disease. The results from this pilot and

288

feasibility trial sets the stage for a definitive large randomised controlled clinical trial using

289

polysaccharides as galectin antagonists in order to study their potential role as a Post

290

Infection Immunisation (PII) which could lower the basic reproduction number (Ro) of the

291

disease by lowering the levels of contagiousness and transmissibility.
