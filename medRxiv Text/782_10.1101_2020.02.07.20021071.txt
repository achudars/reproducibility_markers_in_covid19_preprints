Abstract: Estimating the key epidemiological features of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
epidemic proves to be challenging, given incompleteness and delays in early data reporting, in
particular, the severe under-reporting bias in the epicenter, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. As a
result, the current literature reports widely varying estimates. We developed an alternative geostratified debiasing estimation framework by incorporating human mobility with case reporting
data in three stratified zones, i.e., Wuhan, Hubei Province excluding Wuhan, and mainland
China excluding Hubei. We estimated the latent infection ratio to be around 0.12% (18,556
people) and the basic reproduction number to be 3.24 in Wuhan before the city’s lockdown on
January 23, 2020. The findings based on this debiasing framework have important implications
to prioritization of control and prevention efforts.
One Sentence Summary: A geo-stratified debiasing approach incorporating human movement
data was developed to improve modeling of the 2019-nCoV epidemic.

Main Text:
Originating from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, the 2019-nCoV epidemic has spread across
China and 23 other countries, as of February 2, 2020 (1–3). As part of the national effort to
contain the outbreak, an emergency lockdown measure was implemented city-wide in Wuhan on
January 23, 2020, one day before the Chinese New Year Eve. However, according to official
account, at least five million people already travelled from Wuhan to other parts of China before
the city’s lockdown, causing many 2019-nCoV cases outside of Wuhan.
Estimating the key epidemiological parameters of 2019-nCoV has become a research
priority with significant clinical and policy relevance. However, due to the limited emerging
understanding of the new virus and its transmission mechanisms, results are largely inconsistent
across studies. For example, estimates of the basic reproductive number range from 2.2 to 3.1
based on data collected in the early stage of the epidemic (1, 3–5). Attempts were also made to
estimate the size of the epidemic, and forecast the progression of the epidemic with rather
different conclusions (1, 4, 5).
Lacking accurate accounting or sampling of the ground truth as for the number of latently
infected and undiagnosed infectious (L&I) persons is the primary cause for the widespread
discrepancy in these estimates and forecasts. In particular, for the 2019-nCoV, one fundamental
challenge is the under-screening and under-reporting biases in the early stage of the epidemic in
its epicenter, Wuhan, due to limited testing and treatment resources while facing a major
outbreak with a sudden onset. Note that this challenge is not unique to 2019-nCoV; see related
discussions for SARS and other coronavirus outbreaks (6, 7).

the lockdown, and the confirmed 2019-nCoV case reporting data in these destinations. The
estimation of the latent infection ratio enabled additional epidemiological modeling work such as
calculating the 2019-nCoV’s basic reproduction number and inferring the actual size of the
epidemic in Wuhan.

To tackle this major challenge, we developed a geo-stratified debiasing estimation
framework based on the following observation. On the contrary to Wuhan, other places in China
have ample screening and treatment resources in relative terms, and started various stringent
surveillance programs after the Wuhan lockdown, to screen and monitor people who travelled
from Wuhan to these places. As such, the chance of under-screening and underreporting is much
lower outside Wuhan, especially outside Hubei Province. Our approach stratifies mainland
China into three zones, i.e., Wuhan, Hubei Province excluding Wuhan, and mainland China
excluding Hubei (Fig. 1). Incorporating data capturing the size of the population-level movement
from Wuhan to the destinations in other zones with the official confirmed 2019-nCoV case
counts in these destinations, we obtained a reliable estimate of the latent infection ratio, defined
as the proportion of L&I persons among the population, in Wuhan before the lockdown. In turn,
this estimate enabled us to derive the basic reproductive number, the number of L&I persons in
Wuhan before and after the lockdown, and assess the progression of the epidemic nationally.
Results
Fig. 2A shows the relationship between the number of people traveling from Wuhan during the
period of January 16, 2020 to January 22, 2020, and the number of confirmed cases in 12
representative provinces and municipalities during the period of January 23, 2020 to January 29,
2020. The lag between these two time intervals was introduced to accommodate the commonlyassumed 7-day incubation period for 2019-nCoV (3). These representative provinces and
municipalities are those that had received at least 30,000 travelers from Wuhan within a threeweek window starting on January 1, 2020 and ending on January 22, 2020, prior to the
lockdown.
Similarly, Fig. 2B presents the same relationship for 14 cities within Hubei Province.
These cities had received at least 100,000 travelers from Wuhan. From Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B, we
observe a statistically significant positive linear relationship between the number of travelers
from Wuhan and the cumulative case count in most provinces and cities. For two provinces,
Zhejiang and Jiangsu (in Fig. 2A), and two Hubei cities, Xiaogan and Huanggang (in Fig. 2B),
we observe superlinear growth in the cumulative case counts, explainable by the known
significant secondary local transmissions. Fig. 2C presents zone-level aggregated results.

Under our proposed geo-stratified debiasing framework, the latent infection ratio among
the people traveling from Wuhan to other destinations in mainland China excluding Hubei within
a three-week window prior to the lockdown, is estimated as 0.12% (95% CI: 0.09%-0.15%).
Based on this latent infection ratio, we inferred that there were in total 18,556 (95% CI: 14,13422,978) L&I persons in Wuhan before the lockdown, under the assumption that this latent
infection ratio remained the same for people traveling from and remaining in Wuhan. Among
these L&I persons, 10,887 (95% CI: 8,292-13,481) stayed in Wuhan on January 23, 2020, when
the lockdown was initiated, and the remaining 7,669 (95% CI: 5,842-9,497) traveled to other
parts of mainland China. Among the traveling L&I persons, 4,644-7,549 went to other places in
Hubei Province, and 1,198 to 1,947 to places outside Hubei.
We followed a similar geo-stratified debiasing process, relying on more reliable case
counts outside of Hubei to estimate the basic reproduction number R0 for 2019-nCoV. Our R0
estimate is 3.24, indicating that on average one infected case is expected to generate 3.24
secondary infected cases prior to isolation or death. This value is within the range of that of the
2003 SARS epidemic (2-5) (8), and higher than that of influenza (2-3) (9) and Ebola (1.5-2.5)
(10). Compared to the WHO’s estimate (1.4-2.5) and other recently reported estimates (2.2-3.1)
of 2019-nCoV (1, 3–5), our estimate is at the high end. This can be partially explained by the
fact that most published estimates are based on all confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, including the
Wuhan case counts, prone to the under-screening and underreporting biases. When considering
the possibility of a large number of infected and infectious individuals who will not develop
clinical disease, the actual value of R0 could be even higher.
Building on the estimated latent infection ratio, R0, and the number of L&I persons in
Wuhan when the lockdown started, we developed a customized epidemiological model to
simulate the progression of the 2019-nCoV epidemic after the lockdown of Wuhan (see
supplementary materials for details). Given the stringent nature of the lockdown measures and
the continuing underreporting bias in Wuhan, the characteristics of the epidemic within and
outside Wuhan were treated differently.

Discussion
This report introduces a geo-stratified approach for estimating the latent infection ratio in Wuhan
with the presence of severe under-screening and underreporting biases. The estimated latent
infection ratio enabled us to conduct further epidemiological investigations to better understand
the ongoing 2019-nCoV epidemic.
Our findings have important implications with respect to the development of 2019-nCoV
control and prevention policies in mainland China. First, the previous estimates of R0 are likely
to have resulted in an underestimation of the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV, mainly due to the
under-reporting bias during the early phase in Wuhan. Second, the actual epidemic size in
Wuhan and Hubei is larger than what has so far been reported based on confirmed case data.
Third, for parts of Mainland China outside Hubei the risk of further outbreaks is likely to be
limited, as long as locally occurring cases of secondary and tertiary transmissions can be
detected and isolated effectively. The recent quarantine lockdown of Wenzhou was in response
to detection of large numbers of secondary transmissions.
It is absolute key for being able to prevent this epidemic from becoming a pandemic that
cases of clinical disease are detected and isolated as early as possible. In addition, all high-risk
contacts need to be traced to identify secondary transmissions. The public health surveillance
system in China is facing tremendous challenge give the population size and sensitivity of the
system is to be enhanced. It is therefore paramount that available resources are used optimally.
An understanding of the spatial distribution of the L&I persons is critical in this context, since
they are the reservoir of clinical cases and of secondary transmission, although to a lesser extent
than clinical cases. The annual migration around the Lunar New Year compounded the situation
in that it immensely increased movements across the country. The human movement data

utilized in this study provides a robust data source for estimating the likely dissemination of
2019-nCoV cases across the country (Fig. 3B), providing important epidemiological information
that is much less affected by delayed- or under-reporting bias. The management of the epidemic
over the coming weeks when people travel back from their hometowns to their work places will
be critical for being able to bring it under control. We recommend that the national and local
authorities process real-time human movement data through mathematical models to forecast the
spatio-temporal dynamics of further 2019-nCoV outbreaks across Mainland China. This will
allow developing early detection, isolation and quarantine strategies tailored to the very dynamic
epidemiological situation, as well as identify potential problems in the implementation of local
disease control policies and inform the design of any necessary adjustments.

Materials and Methods
Daily counts of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases
The daily counts of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases were collected from the National Health
Commission of the People’s Republic of China through its website accessible at
http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqtb/list_gzbd.shtml.
Additional information about these confirmed cases was retrieved from the websites of the
official provincial and municipal health commissions throughout mainland China. A listing of
these websites is provided by the National Health Commission of People’s Republic of China at
http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqfkdt/gzbd_index.shtml.
Human movement data
The human movement data used in the study consists of aggregated statistics provided by
the two largest telecommunications operators in China, covering the daily counts of the number
of mobile phone users traveling from Wuhan and reaching other destinations outside of Wuhan
in mainland China, between January 1, 2020 and January 22, 2020. Given the very high mobile
phone user penetration rate in China and the 80% market share held by these two operators, these
statistics are expected to be representative of the actual size of the human migration originating
from Wuhan. Note that some users may have returned to Wuhan before traveling outbound
again. These users were counted more than once in the human movement dataset.
Due to the sensitive nature of the telecommunications data records, data processing and
aggregation was conducted in-house in the telecommunications operators’ secure computing
environment by their own staff, without any participation from the author team. The applicable
law of “Provisions on Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunications and Internet
Users (Mainland China)” (11), and the guidelines from the Global System for Mobile
Communications Association (GSMA) on the protection of privacy in the use of mobile phone
data, were followed (12). The authors have access to only exported data aggregated at the
provincial and municipal level. No personal information was processed in the analysis of this
study. This study was approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Review Board of Chinese
Academy of Sciences Institute of Automation (approval #IA-202001).
Estimation of latent infection ratio
Among all mainland China provinces and municipalities, we first chose those to which there
were at least 30,000 people traveling from Wuhan between January 1, 2020 and January 22,
2020. From this selected list of 12 provinces and municipalities, Zhejiang Province and Jiangsu
Province were excluded from our latent infection ratio estimation because of known substantial
secondary local transmissions, given that the first objective of our study is to estimate the latent
infection ratio in Wuhan during the early stage of the epidemic. For the remaining 10 provinces
and municipalities, to accommodate the commonly-assumed 7-day incubation period for 2019nCoV, we calculated the ratio between the count of confirmed cases between January 23, 2020
and January 29, 2020, and the number of people travelling from Wuhan during the period of
January 16, 2020 and January 22, 2020. Table S1 presents these counts and the calculated ratios.
Seven provinces and municipalities offered detailed information concerning secondary local
transmissions when publishing daily case counts. Table S2 presents the cumulative data for these
places.

The estimated latent infection ratio (0.12%) as reported in the main manuscript was
calculated from the data reported in Tables S1 and S2, following the estimation model presented
below.
Let 𝐶" denote the number of cumulative confirmed cases in province 𝑖, and 𝑁" the number
of people traveling from Wuhan to province 𝑖. Mainland China has 31 provinces. Given the
available data from the 10 selected provinces/municipalities, the latent infection ratio, the
proportion of latently infected and undiagnosed infectious (L&I) persons in all people traveling
from Wuhan, 𝑙, were calculated following the standard approach for ratio estimation (13), as
follows.

where 𝑟 denotes the slope of the fitted linear relationship of (𝑁" , 𝐶" ), and 𝑝 the average
proportion of non-secondary cases (see Table S2), estimated around 0.776.
The resulting estimated latent infection ratio is 0.12% (95% CI: 0.09%-0.15%). Using this
ratio, we in turn estimated that there were 18,556 (95% CI: 14,134-22,978) L&I persons (out of
15.34 million population) in Wuhan before the city’s lockdown. Among these L&I persons,
7,670 traveled to other destinations in Mainland China while the rest 10,886 remained in Wuhan.
The SEIRDC model
The standard SEIR model assumes four categories of persons: Susceptible, Exposed
(corresponding to the latently infected cases in the main manuscript), Infectious, and Recovered.
To investigate the 2019-nCoV epidemic, we adopted a the SEIRDC model (14), which enhances
the standard SEIR model by introducing an additional category of persons, Dead, and an
auxiliary variable 𝐶(𝑡) that tracks the cumulative number of infectious persons during the
outbreak. Furthermore, to take into account human movements, we customized the SEIRDC
model for two epidemic areas: Wuhan and non-Wuhan (mainland China excluding Wuhan). The
model is as follows.

where 𝑆(𝑡), 𝐸(𝑡), 𝐼(𝑡), 𝑅(𝑡), and 𝐷(𝑡) denote the number of susceptible, exposed, infectious,
recovered and dead persons, respectively, in Wuhan. 𝑁(𝑡) denotes the total population size. The
variables with subscript 𝑝 indicate that they are for the non-Wuhan area. Variable 𝑝(𝑡) denotes
the migration rate, the proportion of people moving from Wuhan to the non-Wuhan area. In the
formulation, 1/𝑘 is the incubation period (7 days), 1/𝛾 the infectious period (9 days), and 𝛿 =
𝛾𝐶𝑃𝐹/(1 − 𝐶𝑃𝐹) is the death rate, which is estimated by the fatality rate 1.5%. These values
were adopted from the WHO documents (3). We set December 4, 2019 as the starting date of the
outbreak. By adopting the epidemiological characteristics reported in (1), we inferred the
parameters for this customized SEIRDC model to fit our estimated number of L&I persons in
Wuhan before the city’s lockdown. Following (4), the basic reproduction number 𝑅@ = 3.24 was
obtained by fitting the growth of the confirmed case counts in mainland China excluding Hubei
by January 22, 2020. The model-predicted epidemic size of 2019-nCoV is presented in Fig. 3 in
the main manuscript.
