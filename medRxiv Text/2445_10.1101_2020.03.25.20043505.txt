Abstract
In recent days, Covid-19 coronavirus has been an immense impact on social, economic fields in the
world. The objective of this study determines if it is feasible to use machine learning method to
evaluate how much prediction results are close to original data related to Confirmed-NegativeReleased-Death cases of Covid-19. For this purpose, a verification method is proposed in this paper
that uses the concept of Deep-learning Neural Network. In this framework, Long short-term memory
(LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) are also assimilated finally for training the dataset and the
prediction results are tally with the results predicted by clinical doctors. The prediction results are
validated against the original data based on some predefined metric. The experimental results
showcase that the proposed approach is useful in generating suitable results based on the critical
disease outbreak. It also helps doctors to recheck further verification of virus by the proposed
method. The outbreak of Coronavirus has the nature of exponential growth and so it is difficult to
control with limited clinical persons for handling a huge number of patients with in a reasonable
time. So it is necessary to build an automated model, based on machine learning approach, for
corrective measure after the decision of clinical doctors. It could be a promising supplementary
confirmation method for frontline clinical doctors. The proposed method has a high prediction rate
and works fast for probable accurate identification of the disease. The performance analysis shows
that a high rate of accuracy is obtained by the proposed method.

Introduction
It is now known that the coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia occurred in the city of Wuhan, China,
at the end of 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) identified and named novel coronavirus
as “2019-nCoV” which was later declared as Public Health Emergency of International Concern on
January 30, 2020 and further on March 11, 2020 this Covid-19 was characterized as Pandemic [1].
Epidemics of two betacoronaviruses, named as, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-COV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-COV) affected more than
10,000 people in cumulative order in the past two decades[2]. According to the Centres for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), this novel coronavirus has some similarities with SARS-COV and
MERS-COV. These diseases are spread through respiratory droplets from one human being to other.
Symptoms as fever, cough, and shortness of breath after a period ranging from 2 to 14 days are
observed as the outcomes of the disease [3].

Human to human contacts are considered to be responsible for community spread of this disease in
exponential growth. Hence social detachment of people should be followed necessarily to combat
COVID-19 from the front line as well as in backend also. Control measures are to be imposed from
the government side to implement social detachment of people. Preventive measures may include
actions such as locking down the countries, closing and/or minimizing travel connections amongst
the countries and within the cities as well, enforcing quarantine and hospitalization of infected
individuals, suspending schools, offices, shopping malls, restaurants etc. Curfew imposed in the
affected countries is facing potentially huge economical loss. As this disease spreads rapidly, timing
is an important factor for controlling the disease as early as possible. Hence, from the initial stage
an enormous level of monitoring is required for the authorities in order to handle the epidemic
situation. All over the world Scientists are doing 24 hours for finding the vaccine of the disease.
For assisting health planning for Covid-19, Machine Learning framework is proposed in this paper.
This will confirm the confirmed cases, negative cases, recovered cases, and death cases considering
the cases present in the dataset. The proposed prediction model ensures that it follows the original
result regarding this epidemic situation so that enormous economic loss, community spread, amount
of social detachment of people may be detected and also accurate decision can be taken
accordingly. This method will ensure government authorities to yield preventive measures based on
our next work for forecasting the occurrence of this disease in future.
In this paper, data mining concepts are exploited for obtaining prediction of confirmed, negative
cases, recovered cases, and death cases where Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is also employed.
The real cases and prediction cases are compared based on some predefined metric. A combined
model consisting of Long short-term memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is applied to
the dataset finally for training and testing purpose. A comparative study is drawn amongst the
performance of proposed three models-LSTM-RNN, GRU-RNN, and LSTM-GRU-RNN.

Related Work
In [4], an AI based approach is proposed as an alternative to epidemiological model for monitoring
transmission dynamics for Covid-19. This AI based approach is executed by implementing modified
stacked auto-encoder model. This model performs real-time forecasting of the confirmed cases of
Covid-19 across China. This model is applied on the dataset collected from January, 11 to February
27, 2020 given by World Health Organization (WHO). Use of latent variables in the auto-encoder and
clustering algorithms helps in investigating the transmission procedure by grouping the
provinces/cities.
In [5], a methodology called Group of Optimized and Multisource Selection (GROOMS) is suggested
which ensembles a collection of five groups of forecasting methods. Classical time-series forecasting
methods as well as machine learning methods are implemented where small available dataset are
passed from top to down through optimization processes. This will prepare the best winning models
for panel section with lowest error. A polynomial neural network and corrective feedback (PNN+cf)
is assimilated and implemented in this paper. Experimental results indicate that the combined
approach PNN+cf outperforms well over other approaches in terms of Root Mean Squared Error
(RMSE) performance measure parameter.

A computation and analysis based on Suspected-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model is provided
in [3]. Based on the dataset available from January 11 to February 10 2020, it estimates of the main
epidemiological parameters, i.e. the basic reproduction number (R0) and the infection, recovery and
mortality rates, along with their 90% confidence intervals are provided. Computations on SIRD
model, this R0 parameter value turn out to be 2.5. Experimental results forecast declining mortality
rate that in turn help government authorities to impose safeguards.

Performance Measure Metrics
To identify best candidate model from its peers, it is necessary to put concentration on comparison
of measures of the algorithm’s performance. In this paper, following parameters are used for
measuring algorithm’s performance1.

Accuracy identifies the overall effectiveness of the algorithm. It is formulated as follows [6]Accuracy=(tp+tn)/(tp+tn+fn+fp)

(1)

where tp denotes true positive, fp – false positive, fn – false negative, and tn
– true negative counts.

2.

Root-mean-square-error (RMSE)

is a standard performance measure used for time series

forecasting purpose. It is formulated as follows [7]-

RMSE= √(∑ே௜ୀ଴  ’ / N )

(2)

Where Xi is the real value and Xi’ is the predicted value.

Proposed Models
In this paper, a prediction of confirmed cases, negative cases, released, and deceased cases of Covid19 corona virus are obtained using a Recurrent Neural Network method. A Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) is kind of neural network architecture that considers both sequential and parallel
information processing. Incorporating memory cells to neural network; it is possible to simulate the
operations similar to human brain [8]. Following diagram depicts the general structure of a RNN.
Another RNN called Bidirectional RNN (BRNN) accesses future and past context in both directions.
There are alternatives from RNN depending on the gating units, such as Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) RNN and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) RNN.
Traditional RNN lacks of considering context based prediction, which can be overcome by
introducing Long short-term memory (LSTM). LSTM has a good potential to regulate gradient flow
and enable better preservation of long-range dependencies [7].
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is quite similar to LSTM, where the gating units of GRU control the flow
of information inside the unit, without considering separate memory cells[9]. Like LSTM, GRU lacks
of having memory cells in it and it has a lesser number of gates are required and the gates are
activated using current input as well as previous output. As compared to LSTM, GRU has better
convergence rate due to the reduction of parameters and in some cases GRU outperforms well over
LSTM models[10] .

For predicting confirmed, negative, released, deceased cases in Covid-19, dataset from kaggle[11]
contains cases from 20th January 2020 to 12th March 2020, are used for training and testing three
models.
At first, Data are pre-processed by eliminating missing values, irrelevant values. Then data
transforming operations are performed so that it can be given as input to the Deep Learning Models.
In this paper, three models are implemented and applied on the dataset for verifying the given
prediction results with respect to available data set. The prediction results are measured with
respect to performance measure metrics such as- accuracy and RMSE. The accuracy of these three
models can be improved by choosing proper parameter values. The default parameters may not
provide the maximum performance. Hyper-parameter setting is necessary to improve the accuracy
level. However, the RMSE value should be optimised as to signify a better model. It is to be noted
here that the dataset contains cases for confirmed, negative, released, dead patients. It is tested in
clinical laboratory in presence of clinical doctors. This methodology is performed for each of these
individual cases separately. The Figure 1 denotes the proposed methodology.

detailed explanation with respect to each of these models is provided along with their
implementation in the process. The explanation specifies performance of all these models with
respect to categories such as, confirmed, negative, deceased, released cases are also presented one
after another.

method that could recheck occurred cases of COVID-19 automatically. The data driven RNN based
model is capable of providing automated tool for confirming, estimating the current position of this
pandemic, assessing the severity, and assisting government and health workers to act for good
decision making policy. It could be a promising supplementary rechecking method for frontline
clinical doctors. It is now essential for improving the accuracy of detection process.
