Abstract
Massive research efforts have been made in response to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019)
pandemic. Utilization of clinical data can accelerate these research efforts to fight against the
pandemic since important characteristics of the patients are often found by examining the clinical
data. To provide shareable clinical data to catalyze COVID-19 research, we present Columbia
Open Health Data for COVID-19 Research (COHD-COVID), a publicly accessible database
providing clinical concept prevalence, clinical concept co-occurrence, and clinical symptom
prevalence for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. COHD-COVID also provides data on hospitalized
influenza patients and general hospitalized patients as comparator cohorts. The data used in
COHD-COVID were obtained from Columbia University Irving Medical Center’s electronic
health records. We expect COHD-COVID will provide researchers and clinicians quantitative
measures of COVID-19 related clinical features to better understand and fight against the
pandemic.

BACKGROUND & SUMMARY
The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has threatened the health of tens of millions of
people all over the world. The global pandemic caused by COVID-19 has sparked massive
research efforts in the fight against the novel disease, including characterizing the disease and
clinical progression, identifying risk factors for hospitalization, and finding drugs that can be
repurposed to lessen disease severity1-3. Utilization of clinical data from different institutions,
hospitals, and nations can accelerate these research efforts since important characteristics of the
patients are often found by examining the shared clinical data. Although many studies sharing
epidemiological data4,5, public health6, and social measures7 for COVID-19 research have been
conducted, publicly accessible clinical data on COVID-19 remain limited despite the immediate
need8.
Columbia Open Health Data (COHD) provides open access to prevalence and co-occurrence
statistics on conditions, drugs, procedures, and demographics derived from structured electronic
health records (EHR) from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) 9, which serves
the large and diverse population of New York City (NYC) and its surrounding areas. Since its
deployment, COHD has accelerated biomedical research by providing two informative resources,
prevalence and co-occurrence statistics, and their derived association metrics 9-11.
New York City has been one of the first epicenters of the disease in the United States since the
first COVID-19 patient was confirmed on February 29, 202012. As one of the largest hospitals in
NYC, CUIMC has admitted more than 4,000 patients as of September 1, 2020. With the aim to
provide shareable clinical data to catalyze future COVID-19 research, we extend our efforts on
COHD and present Columbia Open Health Data for COVID-19 Research (COHD-COVID), a
publicly accessible database providing clinical concept prevalence, clinical concept prevalence
ratio between cohorts, clinical concept co-occurrence, and clinical symptom prevalence for
COVID-19 patient cohort and comparator cohorts (hospitalized influenza patient cohort and
general hospitalized patient cohort) derived from CUIMC’s electronic health records. In addition
to providing accessible data, we also developed COHD-COVID web application programming
interface (API) for easy access and better usability (available at http://covid.cohd.io).
METHODS
We use the term “concept” to refer to clinical entities and events such as conditions (i.e., diagnosis),
drugs, and procedures. The concepts and their names are defined by the Observational Medical
Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). When concepts are referenced in
this paper, the name of the concept is styled in italics (e.g., Disorder of respiratory system) to
distinguish the formalized concepts from regular text. We also styled entities in the OMOP CDM
(e.g., person_id column in condition_occurrence table) in italics.
Figure 1 depicts the overall workflow to create COHD-COVID. Columbia’s clinical data
warehouse has been converted to the OMOP CDM on a regular basis. We first filtered the EHR
data according to the cohort definitions, then EHR for each patient’s inpatient visits were identified.

Condition, drug, and procedure concepts were obtained from the identified visits. Concept
prevalence, concept prevalence ratio, concept co-occurrence, and symptom prevalence analyses
were followed using the obtained concepts. To protect patient privacy, we excluded rare concepts
observed in 10 or fewer visits and perturbed the true counts using Poisson randomization.
Perturbed counts generated by the Poisson randomization process do not show statistically
significant difference from the true counts9. The resulting data were stored in a MySQL database
and made publicly available via a web API (http://covid.cohd.io/).
Data Source
We utilized EHR data from the CUIMC’s clinical data warehouse, where inpatient and outpatient
data dating back to 1985 are stored. CUIMC has converted its clinical data warehouse to OMOP
CDM on a regular basis. Since CUIMC covers New York City and the surrounding area, which
has a diverse population of 8.2M people and was an early COVID-19 epicenter, the EHR data
from CUIMC can provide a diverse and large sample of COVID-19 patients.
Three different patient cohorts were used in this study. The COVID-19 cohort was defined as
hospitalized patients aged 18 or older with a COVID-19 related condition diagnosis and/or a
confirmed positive COVID-19 test during their hospitalization period or within the prior 21 days.
Patients identified with the COVID-19 cohort definition from March 1, 2020 to September 1, 2020
were used for the COVID-19 cohort. The influenza cohort was similarly defined as patients aged
18 or older who had at least one occurrence of influenza conditions or pre-coordinated positive
measurements or positive influenza testing in the prior 21 days or during their hospitalization
period. The general cohort was defined as all hospitalized patients aged 18 or older. Patient visits
from calendar years 2014 to 2019 were included for the influenza and general cohorts. The
COVID-19 cohort was divided into sub-cohorts stratified by sex (male vs. female) and age (adult
(18-64) vs. senior (65+)) for further investigation. The COVID-19 and influenza cohort definitions
were adapted from the cohort definitions created by the Observational Health Data Science and
Informatics’ (OHDSI) international network study for COVID-19 3.
Patients belonging to the cohorts based on the three cohort definitions above were identified using
the unique person_id from the person table in the OMOP CDM. Condition, drug, and procedure
concepts observed in these patients during inpatient visits were extracted from the
condition_occurrence, drug_exposure, and procedure_occurrence tables in the OMOP CDM,
respectively. Inpatient visits of patients and the concepts in these visits were identified using
visit_occurrence_id and person_id, along with the visit_concept_id from the visit_occurrence
table. We used visit-based count instead of patient-based count in the following analyses for robust
comparison between cohorts lie in different observation window. For example, if we use patientbased count, the patients included in cohorts with longer observation window are likely to have
more concepts than the patients in cohorts with shorter observation window, which could inject
bias into the metrics used in the analyses. Thus, we used visit-based count that cannot be affected
by the length of observation window to reduce the bias.

Concept Prevalence and Concept Prevalence Ratio Analysis
We calculated the concept prevalence in each cohort as detected from the EHR. The concept
prevalence is defined as Eq(1):
𝑃 =

|𝑇 |
|𝑇 |

𝐸𝑞(1)

where 𝑃 is the prevalence of concept C in cohort H, 𝑇 is the set of unique inpatient visits of
patients in cohort H observed with concept C, and 𝑇 is the set of unique inpatient visits of patients
in cohort H. We also calculated hierarchical concept prevalence by defining 𝑇 as the set of unique
visits of patients observed with concept C or any of concept C’s descendant concepts as defined
in the concept_ancestor table in the OMOP CDM. For example, the hierarchical count for
Ibuprofen (OMOP concept ID 1177480) not only includes entries where the specific concept
Ibuprofen was used, but also includes entries using other descendant concepts, such as Ibuprofen
600 MG Oral Tablet (OMOP concept ID 19019073). Taking hierarchical relationships into
account mitigates some of the issues with coding variations across time and practices as different
concepts with minor semantic differences can be aggregated into higher-level concepts.
The concept prevalence ratio indicates how frequently concept C occurs in cohort A relative to
cohort B. The natural logarithm of the concept prevalence ratio is defined as Eq(2):
𝐿𝑅(𝐶

) = 𝑙𝑜𝑔 (

,

𝑃
)
𝑃

𝐸𝑞(2)

where 𝐿𝑅(𝐶 , ) is the log ratio of the prevalence of concept C for cohort A to cohort B, 𝑃 is
prevalence of concept C in cohort A, and 𝑃 is prevalence of concept C in cohort B. Hierarchical
concept prevalence ratio can be calculated by using hierarchical concept prevalence 𝑃 and 𝑃 .
Concept Co-occurrence Analysis
Concept co-occurrence represents how frequently a specific concept pair appears in a cohort. We
defined concept co-occurrence prevalence as Eq(3):
,

𝐶𝑂
,

,

𝑇
=
|𝑇 |

𝐸𝑞(3)
,

where 𝐶𝑂
is the co-occurrence prevalence of concepts 𝐶 and 𝐶 in cohort H, 𝑇
is the set
of unique visits of patients observed with concept 𝐶 and 𝐶 in cohort H, and 𝑇 is the set of
unique visits of patients in the cohort H. We also calculated hierarchical concept co-occurrence
using the hierarchy of concepts as described above.

COVID-19 Symptom Prevalence Analysis
Since clinical symptoms often include multiple granular clinical concepts, a set of related concepts
for a symptom is required to calculate the prevalence of the symptom. For example, dyspnea,
which is one of the major symptoms of COVID-19, can be detected as standard concept Dyspnea
or Acute respiratory distress in different patients. The two concepts do not have any hierarchical
relationship and thus will not be aggregated by the hierarchical prevalence analyses. Thus, a
concept set containing both Dyspnea and Acute respiratory distress is needed for accurate
calculation of the prevalence of cough symptom. We defined symptom prevalence as Eq(4):
𝑃 =

⋃

𝑇
|𝑇 |

𝐸𝑞(4)

where 𝑃 is prevalence of symptom S in cohort H, 𝑇 is the set of unique visits of patients
observed with concept 𝐶 , 𝑇 is the set of unique visits of patients observed in the cohort H, and s
is the number of the unique concepts in the concept set for symptom S. Hierarchy between concepts
is not considered in the symptom prevalence analysis since a concept set of a symptom already
reflects hierarchy for that symptom.
We used concept sets for 11 major symptoms of COVID-19 (Cough, Chills, Abdominal pain,
Diarrhea, Dyspnea, Fatigue, Fever, Myalgia, Nausea and vomiting, Tachypnea, and Throat pain)
that have been defined by OHDSI to calculate symptom prevalence. The concepts included in each
symptom are available in figshare13.
Data Records
The results of all analyses, concept definitions, and concepts included in each symptom are
available as tab-delimited flat files in figshare13. The results of the concept prevalence ratio
analysis were not included in the record since they can be directly computed from concept
prevalence available in the record. The COHD-COVID API (http://covid.cohd.io/) provides the
results of concept prevalence and concept co-occurrence analyses. The prevalence and cooccurrence are relative to a maximum of 1.0 (1.0 = 100%) and all concepts are referenced by their
OMOP standard concept ID. Brief descriptions for the flat files are:

Descriptive statistics
We analyzed CUIMC’s EHR data by calculating concept prevalence, concept prevalence ratio,
concept co-occurrence, and symptom prevalence for three different cohorts, including the COVID19 cohort. Summary statistics of the cohorts are provided in Table 1.
Concept prevalence and concept co-occurrence analysis on the COVID-19 cohort contain 1,066
concepts and 49,666 concept pairs, respectively, covering 290 condition, 705 drug, and 71
procedure concepts. Concept prevalence and concept co-occurrence analysis on the influenza
cohort contain 1,392 concepts and 58,469 concept pairs, respectively, covering 510 condition, 756
drug, and 126 procedure concepts. Concept prevalence and concept co-occurrence analysis on the
general cohort contain 11,250 concepts and 1,297,928 concept pairs, respectively, covering 4,362
condition, 3,428 drug, and 3,460 procedure concepts. Descriptive statistics of the results from the
two analyses for each cohort are summarized in Table 2 and 3.

Data quality analysis
Assessing data quality of EHR data is critical for its effects on secondary analysis for research in
the healthcare and medical domains14. We calculated the sum of non-randomized counts of all
concepts on a monthly basis for the COVID-19 cohort and on a yearly basis for the general and
influenza cohorts. For each of the condition, drug, and procedure domains, we examined the total
counts of concepts with the number of visits to detect any issues regarding data quality and
temporal plausibility of the EHR data we used in the study15.
Figure 2 shows the total counts across all concepts in the (a) condition domain, (b) drug domain,
(c) procedure domain, and (d) the total visits per month between March 2020 and August 2020 for
the COVID-19 cohort. The total counts of conditions, drugs, procedures and total visits all show
steep increases in March and April 2020, when the number of COVID-19 cases surged in NYC,
as shown in (e)16. The total counts of all domains and the total visits decreased starting May as the
number of COVID-19 patients in NYC decreased.
A change in the EHR system can affect the quality and characteristics of EHR data collected for
secondary research. CUIMC changed its EHR system as of February 1 st, 2020 from Allscripts to
Epic, which might affect the COVID-19 cohort data and its characteristics as compared against the
influenza and general cohorts, which were collected prior to the EHR change. To detect the impact
of the change, we performed a t-test for all concepts reported in the COVID-19 cohort between
the counts from a pre-Epic period (January 1, 2020 – January 31, 2020) and from a post-Epic
period (February 1, 2020 – Feb 29, 2020). The post-Epic period was chosen to minimize the
inclusion of dates when COVID-19 would have impacted clinical practices in NYC. The counts
of concepts were recorded on a daily basis. We considered there to be no difference between the
two periods if the counts for the concept from the two periods are the same (i.e. all 0 counts for
the two periods). Of all 1,066 unique concepts reported in the COVID-19 cohort, 119 (11.2%)
concepts show a statistically meaningful difference (p-value ≤ 0.01) between the pre- and postEpic periods. The p-values of the t-tests for all individual concepts are available in figshare 13 to
allow users to factor in these data quality considerations for each concept.
Figure 3 shows the total counts per year across all concepts in the (a) condition domain, (b) drug
domain, (c) procedure domain, and (d) the total visits per year between 2014 and 2019 for the
general cohort and influenza cohort. The total counts of conditions, drugs, procedures and total
visits per year for the two cohorts show consistent trends.
The annual mean and standard deviation of concept prevalence and concept co-occurrence for the
general and influenza cohorts are available in figshare13 to assess the temporal variance of each
concept and concept-pair. The mean and standard deviation of annual concept prevalence and cooccurrence should only be compared to each other to assess stability of the concept over the given
time period of the dataset.

USAGE NOTES
In this section, we show several motivating use cases to demonstrate the utility of COHD-COVID.
Use case 1: Concept prevalence analysis on the three cohorts
Concept prevalence analysis on the three cohorts can be used to find clinical characteristics of the
COVID-19 cohort. Figure 4 shows the prevalence of 10 (a) condition and (b) drug concepts in the
COVID-19 cohort, influenza cohort, and general cohort. We chose the 10 most prevalent condition
and drug concepts in the COVID-19 cohort for this use case. For drug concepts, we chose the most
prevalent drug ingredient concepts using hierarchical analysis to count multiple drugs having
different brand names, dosages, and formulations but based on the same ingredients together. The
condition concepts were chosen without hierarchical analysis to identify the top 10 specific
conditions. Comparing the prevalence of these concepts between the COVID-19 cohort and the
influenza or general cohorts provides contexual clues whether the concept is associated with
COVID-19 or if its common among hospitalized patients. From Figure 4 (a), we can confirm that
Fever, Cough, Dyspnea, and Acute lower respiratory syndrome were more highly prevalent in the
COVID-19 cohort than the two comparator cohorts. Acetaminophen was the most prevalent drug
ingredient used for COVID-19 patients, which aligns with the high prevalence of Fever. We can
see that Hydroxychloriquine, which was one of the drugs widely administered to COVID-19
patients17, showed high prevalence in the COVID-19 cohort.
Use case 2: Concept prevalence analysis on the COVID-19 cohort and its sub-cohorts
Concept prevalence analysis on the COVID-19 cohort and its sub-cohorts can be used to find
clinical characteristics of the sub-cohorts. Figures 5 and 6 show the prevalence of 10 (a) condition
and (b) drug concepts, respectively, in the COVID-19 cohort stratified by gender and age. The 10
condition and drug concepts were the top 10 most prevalent concepts in the full COVID-19 cohort
without stratification (the same concepts and prevalence calculation methods as in Use Case 1).
Figure 5 (a) shows that the senior cohort had higher prevalences in all 10 condition concepts than
the full and adult cohorts. We can also confirm that Essential hypertension and Hypoxemia were
particularly more prevalent in senior COVID-19 patients.
Use case 3: Concept prevalence ratio analysis
Concept prevalence ratio analysis can be used to unveil how often specific concepts appeared in
the COVID-19 cohort compared to the comparator cohorts. For example, Table 4 shows the top
10 condition concepts that showed the highest concept prevalence ratio for the COVID-19 cohort
relative to the general cohort and influenza cohort. High ratio of the concepts related to delivery
was observed due to unusual spike of delivery events during the pandemic period from March
2020 to August 2020. It is interesting to see the high prevalence ratio of Cerebral infarction in the
COVID-19 cohort compared to the influenza cohort, corroborating reports from several studies
that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be more likely to cause
thrombotic vascular events, including stroke, than other coronavirus and seasonal infectious
diseases18,19.

Use case 4: Concept co-occurrence analysis of the COVID-19 cohort
Potential associations between specific concepts of interest can be found by co-occurrence analysis.
For example, Table 5 shows the top 10 most frequently co-occurring concepts with Acute lower
respiratory tract infection in the COVID-19 cohort. We used non-hierarchical concept cooccurrence in this use case. The concepts associated with SARS-CoV-2 tests (i.e. Disease due to
Coronavirus, Radiologic examination, chest; single view, and Infectious agent detection by nucleic
acid (DNA or RNA); severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) showed high cooccurrence prevalence ratio with Acute lower respiratory tract infection. Hydroxychloroquine also
showed high co-occurrence prevalence ratio with Acute lower respiratory tract infection.
Use case 5: COVID-19 Symptom prevalence analysis
Symptom prevalence analysis can be used to examine symptom-level characteristics of the cohorts.
Figure 7 shows symptom prevalence of the 11 major COVID-19 symptoms for all three cohorts.
The COVID-19 cohort showed higher prevalence in dyspnea, fever, and cough symptoms than the
other two comparator cohorts, which aligns with the known characteristics and symptoms of
COVID-19 patients20.

LIMITATIONS
There are several limitations to this work that should be noted. One of the limitations is that
analyses performed in this work can be affected by the factors lying in the data acquisition process
(e.g., change of the EHR system, and human biases and errors during entry). For example, coding
trends and patterns (i.e., the trend and pattern of frequently used concepts) can be changed by a
shift in system. Another limitation is that multiple visits from the same patient can be used to
calculate the metrics in the analyses since we used visit-based count instead of patient-based count
for the analyses. This could affect the results of the specific concepts appeared in the patients who
made unusual visiting pattern.
The EHR data used in this study were obtained from a single site: the CUIMC campus of
NewYork-Presbyterian (NYP). Even though NYP is the largest hospital in NYC covering the city
and its surrounding area, we admit that performing the analyses based on the EHR data across
multiple institutions and nations will be beneficial since multiple sites can diversify the population,
improve accuracy, increase power and sensitivity to rare conditions, validate results by comparing
across sites, and reduce variance that might exist in specific location. Since the OMOP CDM
provides the fundamentals to perform the same analyses on clinical data across different sites, we
hope to collaborate with future studies sharing clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients and
to generate a larger, richer, and more robust database that can be leveraged in translational research
for COVID-19.
