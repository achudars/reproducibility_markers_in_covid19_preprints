Abstract
Convalescent plasma with severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
antibodies (CCP) may hold promise as treatment for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
We compared the mortality and clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19 who received
200mL of CCP with a Spike protein IgG titer ≥1:2,430 (median 1:47,385) within 72 hours of
admission to propensity score-matched controls cared for at a medical center in the Bronx,
between April 13 to May 4, 2020. Matching criteria for controls were age, sex, body mass index,
race, ethnicity, comorbidities, week of admission, oxygen requirement, D-dimer, lymphocyte
counts, corticosteroids, and anticoagulation use. There was no difference in mortality or
oxygenation between CCP recipients and controls at day 28. When stratified by age, compared to
matched controls, CCP recipients <65 years had 4-fold lower mortality and 4-fold lower
deterioration in oxygenation or mortality at day 28. For CCP recipients, pre-transfusion Spike
protein IgG, IgM and IgA titers were associated with mortality at day 28 in univariate analyses.
No adverse effects of CCP were observed. Our results suggest CCP may be beneficial for
hospitalized patients <65 years, but data from controlled trials is needed to validate this finding
and establish the effect of ageing on CCP efficacy.

Introduction:
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1), a highly
transmissible enveloped positive-strand RNA virus (2), is the causative agent of the Coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (3). The first case was reported in December 2019, and by
November 2020 more than 61 million infections were reported worldwide, with one fifth of the
cases and deaths occurring in the United States (U.S.) (4). In April 2020, New York City (NYC),
especially the borough of the Bronx, was an early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the
U.S. (5, 6). Since then, an antiviral that reduced duration of illness (7), Remdesivir, received
FDA approval on October 22, 2020, and corticosteroids, which reduced mortality in severely ill
patients in a large randomized clinical trial and prospective meta-analysis (8, 9), have become
standard of care. As of November 2020, there is no approved therapy for COVID-19 that reduces
mortality of hospitalized patients with respiratory manifestations of severe or life-threatening
disease.
Convalescent plasma (CP) obtained from recovered persons was deployed for previous
respiratory pandemics, including 1918 and 2009 influenza and Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) (10-13). Given the lack of established therapies for COVID-19, CP
containing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (CCP) was proposed as a therapeutic option early in the
pandemic (14). As of November 2020, it has shown a possible benefit in multiple studies. In
early case series, CCP-treated patients exhibited viral clearance and reductions in inflammatory
markers (15-19). Observational studies comparing CCP-treated patients to retrospective controls
showed a reduction in mortality in non-intubated patients and/or those transfused within 72 hours
of hospitalization with high titer CCP (20-24). Analysis of a subset of more than 3,000 CCP
recipients in an open label study found a dose-response whereby non-intubated patients who

received high titer CCP had lower mortality than those who received low titer CCP (22). Several
randomized controlled trials (RCT) have not shown a benefit of CCP, but were limited by
premature termination due to a lack of patients to recruit (25, 26). One trial found CCP had an
antiviral effect, but there was no effect on mortality (27), another found a reduction in mortality,
albeit with a very small sample size (28), and another was terminated due to the presence of
neutralizing antibodies in CCP recipients at the time of transfusion, despite being on track to
meet the primary endpoint (29). A recent double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter RCT did
not show an effect of CCP on mortality (30). Evidence of safety and possible benefit led the
FDA to issue an emergency use authorization (EUA) for CCP use in hospitalized patients with
COVID-19 on August 23, 2020.
We treated 103 patients at Montefiore Medical Center (MMC), a 1,491-bed tertiary
medical center in the Bronx, New York with serious or life-threatening COVID-19 with CCP
between April 13 and May 4, 2020 and conducted a propensity score matched study. Herein, we
report mortality and clinical and laboratory findings of CCP recipients compared to matched
controls.

Results
Baseline characteristics of CCP recipients and retrospective controls
One hundred and three (103) patients were enrolled in the Mayo Clinic expanded access protocol
(EAP) (31) and treated with one 200 mL unit of CCP within 72 hours of hospital admission.
Clinical status and mortality on day 28 post-transfusion was compared to retrospective
propensity score matched controls identified by querying the electronic medical record (Figure
1). Analysis included 90 CCP recipients and 258 controls after exclusion of twelve patients who
did not meet the eligibility criteria because of mechanical ventilation for > 24 hours or CCP
transfusion > 72 hours after admission, and one patient with missing data (Figure 1). Compared
to controls, CCP recipients were younger (median 66 vs 72 years, P = 0.002), had higher BMI
(28 vs 27 kg/m2, P = 0.05), and lower rates of congestive heart failure (18 vs 29%, P = 0.03), and
chronic kidney disease (29 vs 41%, P = 0.03). At baseline, a lower proportion of CCP recipients
were on low-flow oxygen support (68 vs 81%, P < 0.0001) and a higher proportion required
mechanical ventilation (20 vs 6%, P < 0.0001), had lower baseline lymphocyte counts (0.8 vs 1.0
x 109/L, P = 0.001), and received systemic corticosteroids (93 vs 63%, P < 0.0001)
(Supplemental Table 1). After propensity score matching, 73 CCP recipients and 73 control
patients were well balanced for all matching variables except in a subgroup analysis stratified by
age; CCP recipients ≥ 65 years had lower lymphocyte counts than controls (median, 0.8 vs 1.0
x109/L) (Table 1, Supplemental Figure 1).

Convalescent plasma SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers
Of the 200 mL units of CCP administered in this study, 95 of 103 were obtained from 46 persons
who donated CP at MMC in April 2020. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG endpoint titers were

measured in CCP obtained from these donors using the MMC in-house research full-length spike
protein ELISA (32). Median IgG, IgM and IgA titers were, respectively, 1:47,385 (interquartile
range [IQR], 21,870 – 65,610; n = 46), 1:810 (IQR, 810 – 2,430; n = 43) and 1:90 (IQR, 90 –
270; n = 43). Median NAb titer by pseudovirus neutralization assay was 1:938 (IQR, 407 –
2,784; n = 42). There was a direct correlation between NAb titer and spike protein IgG
(Spearman r = 0.78, P < 0.0001), IgM (r = 0.58, P < 0.0001) and weakly with IgA (r = 0.29, P =
0.05) titers (Supplemental Figure 2). For the eight patients who did not receive MMC donor
CCP, 7 received units that tested as ‘reactive’ by the New York State Department of Health
(NYSDOH) Wadsworth Center’s SARS-CoV-2 Microsphere Immunoassay for antiNucleocapsid antibody detection (33), and one received CCP with a spike protein IgG titer of
1:320 measured by the in-house spike protein ELISA assay at Mount Sinai Hospital (34) .

Comparison of clinical outcomes of CCP recipients and controls
There was no difference in mortality between 73 CCP recipients and 73 propensity score
matched controls by day 28 (P = 0.47, Kaplan-Meier log rank test) (Figure 2). To account for the
potential interaction between age and CCP treatment (P = 0.11, interaction term), analysis was
stratified by age. Compared to matched controls, CCP recipients < 65 years had lower mortality
by day 28 (P = 0.04, Kaplan-Meier log rank test), whereas the mortality of CCP recipients and
matched controls ≥ 65 years did not differ significantly (P = 0.61, Kaplan-Meier log rank test)
(Figure 2). There was no difference in mortality between groups when CCP recipients and
controls were stratified by baseline oxygen requirement (Supplemental Figure 3).
There was no significant difference between CCP recipients and matched controls in allcause mortality at 28 days (31.5 vs 38.4%; odds ratio [OR], 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI],

0.37 – 1.46; P = 0.37) (Figure 3). When stratified by age, CCP recipients < 65 years had a 4-fold
decrease in mortality (8.8 vs 29.4%; OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.05 – 0.95; P = 0.04) and a 4-fold
decrease in deterioration in oxygenation or mortality (11.8 vs 35.3%; OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.06 –
0.87; P = 0.03). There was no significant difference in mortality of CCP recipients ≥ 65 years
(52.6 vs 45.9%; OR, 1.07; P = 0.89) (Figure 3, Table 1). Among the 103 CCP recipients,
mortality at day 28 was associated with time from symptom onset to transfusion (OR, 1.12; 95%
CI, 1.01 – 1.24; P = 0.04), earlier week of admission (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.00 – 5.00; P = 0.05)
and being Hispanic/LatinX in ethnicity compared to not being Hispanic/LatinX (OR, 8.33; 95%
CI, 1.69 – 33.3; P = 0.009), adjusted for age, sex, BMI, race, ethnicity, comorbid conditions,
week of admission, duration of symptoms, baseline oxygen requirement, corticosteroids,
anticoagulation use, D-dimer and lymphocyte counts (Table 2). There was no significant
association between CCP NAb or spike protein IgG titers and mortality or oxygenation status in
CCP recipients.
Multivariable analysis of 90 CCP recipients and 258 controls adjusted for covariates age,
sex, BMI, race, ethnicity, comorbid conditions, week of admission, baseline oxygen requirement,
corticosteroids, anticoagulation use, D-dimer and lymphocyte counts did not show any difference
in outcome between the two groups. When stratified by age, CCP recipients < 65 years had lower
mortality or deterioration in oxygenation but this was not statistically significant (OR, 0.23; 95%
CI, 0.04 – 1.19; P = 0.08) (Supplemental Figure 4). Additionally, multivariable analysis
indicated that age, use of mechanical ventilation at baseline, use of systemic corticosteroids, not
being on anticoagulation in patients ≥ 65 years and earlier week of admission were associated
with mortality at day 28 adjusted for covariates (Supplemental Table 2). Corticosteroid use was

associated with mortality in patients receiving low-flow oxygen at baseline (adjusted OR, 2.68;
95% CI, 1.27 – 5.68; P = 0.009) when analysis was stratified by baseline oxygen requirement.

CCP safety and adverse events
There were no adverse reactions, including no instances of transfusion-related acute lung injury
or transfusion-associated circulatory overload attributable to CCP administration.

CCP recipient SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody titers
We measured CCP recipient spike protein IgG, IgM, and IgA in remnant serum samples obtained
before (D -1) and after transfusion (Figure 4). Baseline spike protein IgG, IgM and IgA were
significantly higher in patients mechanically ventilated at enrollment (P = 0.009, P = 0.01, P =
0.02, respectively) and those who died by day 28 (P = 0.02, P = 0.02, P = 0.002, respectively)
(Supplemental Table 3, Figure 4, Supplemental Figure 5). There was no association between
baseline antibody titers and time from symptom onset to transfusion or time from hospital
admission to transfusion. Plateau in median IgG after CCP administration was reached earlier in
patients  65 than < 65 years, mechanically ventilated at baseline versus not, and those who died
by versus those alive at day 28 (Figure 4). Baseline IgA was higher in patients  65 than those <
65 years (P = 0.04) (Supplemental Table 3).
There was a direct association between mortality at day 28 and baseline (D -1) IgG (OR,
1.4; 95% CI, 1.04 – 1.78; P = 0.03), IgM (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 – 1.92; P = 0.048) and IgA
(OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.11 – 1.91; P = 0.007) in the univariate analyses but not in the multivariable
analysis adjusted for covariates (Table 2). Baseline spike protein IgG titer was significantly
correlated with D-dimer (r = 0.46; P = 0.0002; n = 60) (Figure 4). In addition, there was a direct,

albeit weak correlation between baseline spike protein IgG titer and detected viral load measured
by cycle threshold (Ct) value of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcriptase-polymerasechain-reaction (RT-PCR) (r = 0.39; P = 0.002; n = 57) (Figure 4). There was no correlation
between Ct value and age, duration of illness, or D-dimer.

CCP recipient inflammatory and hematology measures
There was no significant difference in change in lymphocyte counts, D-dimer, or CRP between
day 0 and 28 in CCP recipients compared to controls (data not shown).

Discussion
CCP has been used as an investigational treatment for COVID-19 since the early days of the
pandemic. Numerous observational studies report safety and signals of possible efficacy of CCP
in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (15, 20, 22-25, 35, 36). Here, we report the mortality
and clinical outcomes of a cohort of 73 patients with severe to life-threatening COVID-19 who
were transfused with one unit of CCP by 72 hours of hospitalization and 73 propensity score
matched controls. There was no significant difference in mortality or improvement in
oxygenation in CCP recipients compared to controls. Although treated within 72 hours of
hospitalization, CCP treated patients had symptom duration of 5-9 days and multiple indicators
of severe or life-threatening disease including lymphopenia, elevated D-dimer levels, and the
need for supplemental oxygen. In this regard, our findings are similar to those of other studies in
which there was no benefit of CCP in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 (25, 27, 30).
Nonetheless in a subset of patients stratified by age, CCP recipients < 65 years had significantly
lower mortality and deterioration in oxygenation by day 28 than controls. Age and duration of
symptoms were independently associated with mortality at day 28 in CCP recipients. There were
no adverse reactions directly attributable to CCP.
There was no evidence of benefit of CCP in patients ≥ 65 years. Age, a well-documented
risk factor for COVID-19 severity and mortality (37, 38), was significantly associated with
mortality in unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Patients ≥ 65 years had a higher frequency of comorbid conditions, higher D-dimer, CRP and SARS-CoV-2 IgA values, and lower lymphocyte
levels than those < 65 years, all of which are markers of severe disease (39-44). Notably in
published case-control studies in which CCP was associated with reduced mortality, median ages
of patients were < 60 years (21, 23, 45), and in the large open label Mayo Clinic study in which

12

there was a signal of reduced mortality in patients who received high titer CCP, 44% of the
cohort was < 60, 70% was < 70 years, and CCP was less effective in those > 80 years (22). In
addition, a small RCT comparing 80 patients randomized to CCP versus standard of care posted
on the pre-print server on November 29th, 2020 found a benefit of CCP in patients < 67 years,
but not in the entire cohort with a median age of 61 years (46). These data along with ours
suggest that ageing may have a detrimental effect on CCP efficacy.
In a case-control study that also did not show a signal of CCP efficacy, Rogers et al.
found a higher rate of hospital discharge in patients ≥ 65 years (47). In their study, 14% of CCP
recipients were black/African American, 31% were Caucasian/white, 42% were
Hispanic/LatinX, and 34% had hypertension, 25% had diabetes, and all received two units of
CCP. Our cohort was older, more severely ill, and came from racial/ethnic populations at higher
risk for severe COVID-19 and death (48): 26% of CCP recipients were black/African American,
9% were Caucasian/white, 51% were Hispanic/LatinX, which was associated with mortality in
our multivariable analysis, and 82% had hypertension, 42% had diabetes, and all received one
unit of CCP. This suggests social determinants of health may have adversely affected clinical
outcomes of our cohort.
Reflecting practice at the peak of the pandemic at our center, the majority of patients in
our cohort received corticosteroids and corticosteroid use was associated with mortality in those
requiring low flow oxygen. In another propensity score matched study, corticosteroids use was
also associated with higher mortality (49). Among CCP recipients ≥ 65 years in our study, 98%
received corticosteroids concurrently with or before CCP. More CCP recipients than controls
also received corticosteroids in the Rogers et al. study, which did not find evidence of CCP
benefit (47). In addition, although not statistically significant, a higher proportion of CCP

recipients than controls received corticosteroids in the Li et al. RCT, in which there was not a
signal of CCP efficacy and the median age was 70 years (25). Corticosteroid use has been
associated with lower mortality in patients with COVID-19 who require mechanical ventilation
(8, 9), and not in the early course of the disease (9, 50). Viral clearance was slower in patients
with SARS and MERS who received corticosteroids (51, 52) and corticosteroid use was
associated with lower anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and neutralization
titers in COVID-19 patients (53). Thus, we wonder if corticosteroid use further impaired the
immune status of elderly patients in our cohort, who already had lower lymphocyte counts. Data
from ongoing RCTs is needed to evaluate the effect of covariates, including corticosteroids on
CCP efficacy.
The ability of CCP to affect the course of COVID-19 is most likely a function of viral
neutralization early in disease (14, 54). The Mayo Clinic study analysis found that high titer
CCP, as defined by signal to cut off ratio on the OrthoV platform, reduced COVID-19 mortality
relative to low titer CCP (22). In a propensity score matched study, compared to controls, CCP
with a RBD IgG titer ≥1:1,350 reduced mortality in non-intubated patients transfused within 72
hours of hospital admission (21). Although titers in our study cannot be directly compared with
titers in other studies, CCP used in our study had high titer spike protein IgG and a median
neutralizing titer of 1:938 based, respectively, on a highly specific full length spike protein
ELISA (55-57) and a pseudovirus neutralization assay that correlates with live virus (plaque
reduction) neutralization (42, 57, 58). Nonetheless, although there was a possible signal of
efficacy in the sub-group < 65 years who received CCP within 72 hours of hospitalization, this
was not the case in patients ≥ 65 years, who were more severely ill based on baseline data. It is
possible elderly patients may require more than one dose of 200 mL of CCP, but two units did

not mediate an effect in the Rogers et al. cohort (47). While there are theoretical concerns of
antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of
anti-viral antibodies (59, 60), ADE was not reported in other CCP treatment studies and the
levels of spike protein antibody with neutralizing capability in CCP in this study make it very
unlikely. Given the high mortality of COVID-19 in patients ≥ 65 years and lack of evidence of
CCP efficacy in this group in our study and others (25, 61) there is a need for more data on the
effect of aging on CCP efficacy in COVID-19 .
Consistent with other reports associating SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer with disease
severity and/or mortality (53, 62-64), spike protein IgG at enrollment was directly associated
with mortality among 60 CCP recipients who had remnant sera available. Although we observed
post-transfusion increases in spike protein IgG in patients < 65 years or who were not intubated,
this cannot be distinguished from endogenous antibody without comparison to untreated
controls. While we did not measure post-transfusion viral loads, pre-transfusion antibody titers
correlated with RT-PCR Ct values (inversely correlated with viral load). Thus, as in other studies
(53, 65), endogenous antibody may have already contributed to viral control in CCP recipients.
The Gharbharan et al. RCT was terminated early when it was discovered majority of the study
patients had neutralizing titers at enrollment equivalent to donor CCP (29), although the study
appeared on track to meet its expected endpoint. Patients in the PLACID RCT (27) who received
CCP had earlier conversion to viral RNA negativity, despite having low levels of neutralizing
antibodies at enrollment. In the ConPlas-19 RCT (26), in which 49% of the patients had positive
SARS-CoV-2 IgG at enrollment, CCP did not confer benefit, but there was a trend towards
reduced mortality. Nonetheless, in our study as in others (27, 66), antibody titers and symptom
duration associated with disease severity and a lack of evidence of CCP efficacy. This

underscores the longstanding principle that convalescent antibody therapy is most likely to be
effective early in the course of viral respiratory diseases (14) as shown for COVID-19 in
propensity score matched studies (23, 49) and a recently published outpatient RCT (66).
A strength of our study is that it includes patients over the age of 65 years, who represent
a population with disproportionately higher COVID-19 mortality. To date, studies of CCP and
other potential therapies for COVID-19 in patients negatively affected by social determinants of
health are lacking. The Bronx has a higher poverty rate than the other New York City (NYC)
boroughs (5, 67) and our cohort was comprised predominantly of Hispanic or Latinx and black
or African American populations who were severely affected by the surge conditions in NYC
and experienced higher COVID-19 mortality (68-71). We attempted to control for hospital surge
capacity and social determinants of health that can significantly contribute to COVID-19
outcome (72) by including week of admission, race, and ethnicity as propensity scores.
A major limitation of this study is its retrospective and non-randomized study design. The
retrospectively identified controls differed in baseline characteristics from the cases, most
notably in baseline oxygen requirement, proportion of corticosteroid use and baseline
lymphocyte counts, suggesting a mismatch in severity of illness due to selection bias. While
propensity score matching and multivariable analysis with adjustments were done to correct for
confounding variables, there likely were additional latent and unmeasured variables that were not
adjusted for. In addition, time-dependent variables such as hospital bed capacity during surge
conditions and advances in clinical practice, such as use of proning techniques, lung protective
ventilation strategies, improvement in sedation, may not have been accounted for in our analysis,
despite matching and adjusting for baseline week. In addition, poor or absent documentation of
oxygen requirement and inconsistencies in obtaining inflammatory markers during the height of

the pandemic resulted in missing data, precluding a more complete analysis. Finally, since we
could not obtain antibody data for controls, we cannot assess CCP effects on antibody levels.
In summary, we report that CCP administration within 72 hours of hospitalization
demonstrated a possible signal of reduced mortality in patients < 65 years. Similar to others, we
found CCP was safe with no adverse events directly attributable to transfusion (21, 73, 74).
Although our data suggest possible effects of age, disease severity, and corticosteroid use on
CCP efficacy, prospective, randomized, controlled trials are needed to establish CCP efficacy
and the effect of these and other covariates. Antibody-based therapies, including CCP have now
shown promise in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 (66, 75). However, nearly a year
into the pandemic, effective therapies for hospitalized patients are still urgently needed,
particularly for those who are elderly and at high risk for mortality. If effective in any group of
hospitalized patients, CCP will have immense impact on healthcare resources and public health
during this ongoing pandemic (76). CCP is rapidly available compared to other pharmaceuticals
or vaccines and may be a more feasible option in surge conditions and/or resource limited
settings (24).

Methods
Patient enrollment
One hundred and three (103) adult patients with laboratory (nasopharyngeal PCR)-confirmed
COVID-19 were enrolled in the Mayo Clinic expanded access treatment protocol (31) to receive
CCP between April 13 and May 4, 2020. Hospitalized patients were referred to the study team by
hospitalists and/or infectious diseases consultants and were deemed eligible to receive CCP if
they had been hospitalized for  3 days or were symptomatic for 3 to 7 days prior to transfusion
and had severe and/or life-threatening COVID-19 disease. Patients who were on mechanical
ventilation for more than 24 hours were excluded. Severe disease was defined as respiratory
symptoms with hypoxemia requiring ≥ 5 liters of nasal cannula oxygen support. Life-threatening
disease was defined as respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, and/or
multiple organ dysfunction or failure. Ninety-one patients received CCP by day three of
hospitalization. Patients or their legally authorized representatives provided informed consent
prior to treatment.

Convalescent plasma procurement and transfusion
After obtaining informed consent, blood was collected between March and April 2020 from
otherwise healthy adult volunteers residing in Westchester County, Rockland County and the
Bronx, NY who had recovered from COVID-19. Potential donors had a documented positive
nasopharyngeal swab by PCR for SARS-CoV-2 during illness and had been asymptomatic for
≥14 days prior to sample collection. Serum was obtained by venipuncture (BD Vacutainer,
serum), aliquoted, heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes and stored at -4°C prior to antibody
screening by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Donors with SARS-CoV-2 spike

protein titers >1:1,000 were referred for apheresis at the New York Blood Center (NYBC). CCP
from 46 MMC donors and 8 donors from the general NYBC pool was administered to patients in
the study.
Plasma recipients were transfused with 1 unit (~ 200 mL) of ABO-type matched CCP
over 2-3 hours and monitored before, during and after infusion for signs of transfusion-related
reactions per standard transfusion protocol.

Controls and data collection
We identified 1,347 non-CCP recipients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR admitted to MMC
between April 13 and May 4 by querying the electronic medical record (EMR). Since most CCP
was administered by day 3 post-admission, baseline day was set at day +2 post-admission in
non-CCP recipients. Of the 1,347 identified patients, the CCP recipients and 986 non-CCP
recipients were excluded because they required < 5 L or no baseline oxygen support, or had a
missing baseline oxygen value (n = 903), or were intubated for > 24 hours at baseline (n = 47), or
had missing data (n = 36). This resulted in a retrospective control group of 258 non-CCP
recipients (Figure 1). We collected age, sex, BMI, race, ethnicity, comorbidities, medications,
laboratory findings, and day of death or discharge from CCP-treated and control patients.
Additionally, we collected duration of symptoms and hospital day of transfusion from CCPtreated patients from the EMR. Specific laboratory values and clinical characteristics were
obtained from EMR by using Structured Query Language.
For both control and CCP recipients, patient oxygen support was evaluated at day 0 and
28 post-CCP and the corresponding day post-admission for controls as follows: low-flow oxygen
through nasal cannula or non-rebreather mask (5 - 15 liter), high-flow nasal cannula or non-

invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation. If a patient’s oxygen requirement
increased or the patient died prior to the time-point of interest, patient’s oxygenation status was
considered to have worsened. Initial cycle threshold (Ct) value from the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR
assay performed on a single platform was queried retrospectively for CCP recipients.

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG, IgM and IgA titers before and after transfusion of CCP
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-binding IgG, IgM and IgA titers were determined by ELISA using
remnant sera obtained from baseline (Day -1 (D-1)) and 1, 3, 7 days after patients received CCP
(D1, D3 and D7, respectively). Briefly, microtiter plates (Costar, Corning, NY) were coated with
25 µl of 2 µg/ml purified spike protein (55, 56, 77) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight
at 4C, washed with 1X PBS/0.1% Tween (PBS-T), blocked with 3% (v/v) milk (Bio-Rad)/PBST for 1 hr at room temperature (RT), washed, and incubated with heat inactivated sera for 2 hrs
at RT. Plates were then washed, incubated with isotype-specific horseradish phosphatase (HRP)
labeled goat anti-human (GAH) IgG (Thermo Fisher), IgM, or IgA (Millipore Sigma) for 1 hr at
RT. Following final washes, plates were incubated with ultra-TMB ELISA substrate (Thermo
Scientific) and color development was stopped by addition of 0.5 M sulfuric acid (Sigma
Aldrich). Well absorbances at 450 nm (A450) were determined using a Cytation 5 (BioTek). The
endpoint titer was determined as the highest dilution to give a signal three times the background
A450 (wells with no sera).

rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 S Neutralization assay
The neutralization assay was done as previously described (57). Briefly, CCP samples were
serially diluted and incubated with pre-titrated amounts of virus for 1 hr at RT, plasma-virus

mixtures were added to 96-well plates (Corning) containing monolayers of Vero cells, incubated
for 7 hr at 37°C/5% CO2, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS, washed with PBS,
and stored in PBS containing Hoechst-33342 (1:2,000 dilution; Invitrogen). Viral infectivity was
measured by automated enumeration of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive cells from
captured images using a Cytation 5 automated fluorescence microscope (BioTek) and analyzed
using the Gen 5 data analysis software (BioTek). The serum half-maximal inhibitory
concentration (NC ) was calculated using a nonlinear regression analysis with GraphPad Prism
50

software.

Study outcomes
The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at day 28 post-CCP. The secondary outcomes were
improvement in oxygenation status or mortality at day 28 post-CCP. Exploratory outcomes were
associations between pre-CCP SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and mortality at day 28.

Statistics
Patient characteristics and outcomes were reported as frequencies and proportions for categorical
variables, and median and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables. Differences
between groups (e.g., CCP versus non-CCP) were determined by student t-test or Mann Whitney
U test for continuous variables, and Chi-square or Fischer’s exact tests for categorical variables,
as appropriate.
For the outcome analysis, we performed 1:1 propensity score matching using the nearest
neighbor matching without replacement on 90 case and 258 control patients to optimize balance
of baseline characteristics for assessing the independent effect of CCP on oxygenation and

survival. The distribution of O2 requirement prior to matching showed that the cases had higher
oxygen requirement (P < 0.001). The primary matching criteria included age, sex, race, ethnicity,
BMI, week of admission, D-dimer, lymphocyte count, corticosteroids use, anticoagulation use,
hypertension, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery
disease, hyperlipidemia with exact matching on baseline oxygen requirement and age group
(categorical, < 65 vs ≥ 65 years). Propensity scores were calculated using a logistic regression
model. After 1:1 propensity score matching, the analysis included 73 cases and 73 controls and
the variables were not significantly different between CCP recipients and controls based on an
omnibus test (P = 0.80) (78). The all-cause mortality at day 28 post-CCP was depicted by
Kaplan-Meier curves. Differences between groups were compared using the log-rank test.
Stratification analyses were done by age < 65 vs ≥ 65 years and by baseline oxygen requirement.
Corticosteroids and anticoagulation use were not well balanced in the subgroups and were
further adjusted for in age-stratified analysis.
As a sensitivity analysis, factors associated with oxygenation status at day 28 were
evaluated by proportional odds model, and mortality at day 28 was evaluated using logistic
regression model. Adjusted OR and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated. To
identify variables that predicted mortality in CCP group, we performed a stepwise model
selection using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) in a logistic regression model with age,
sex, BMI, race, ethnicity, comorbidities, week of admission, time from symptom onset to
transfusion, baseline oxygen requirement, anticoagulation, corticosteroid use, D-dimer, and
lymphocyte count. Log-transformed SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody titers were individually
added to select models to evaluate their association with each outcome. A two-sided P-value of <
