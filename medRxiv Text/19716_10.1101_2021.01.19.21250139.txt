Abstract
Background: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has disproportionately impacted the Latinx
community in the United States. Environmental risk factors, including community level pollution
burden and exposure to smoking and secondhand smoke, have not been evaluated in relation to
risk for infection with COVID-19.
Methods: We evaluated self-reported infection rates of COVID-19 in three, preexisting,
longitudinal, Latinx family cohorts in the San Francisco Bay Area from May through September
2020 (N=383 households, 1,875 people). All households were previously recruited during
pregnancy and postpartum at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) and UCSF
Benioff before the pandemic. For the COVID-19 sub-study, participants responded to a 15minute telephonic interview where we assessed food consumption patterns, housing and
employment status, and history of COVID-19 infection based on community and hospital-based
testing. We also evaluated secondhand smoke exposure based on previously collected selfreported data. Environmental pollution exposure was determined from census tract residence
using California’s EnviroScreen 2.0 data. Non-parametric tests and multiple logistic regression
were used to assess possible associations and independent predictors of COVID-19 infection.
Results: In the combined Latinx, Eating and Diabetes Cohort (LEAD) and Hispanic, Eating and
Nutrition (HEN) cohorts there was a 7.6% household infection rate (14/183) with a lower rate of
3.5% (7/200) in the Telomeres at Birth (TAB) cohort. Larger household size increased risk for
infection (OR, 1.43 (95%CI 1.10-1.87)) in the combined LEAD/HEN cohorts and increasing
number of children trended towards significance in the TAB cohort (OR 1.82, 95% CI 0.983.37). Any exposure to secondhand smoke in the household also trended towards increasing risk
after adjusting for household size and other exposures (OR 3.20, 95%CI 0.80-12.73) and (OR
4.37, 95% CI 0.80-23.70). We did not find any associations between neighborhood pollution
level based on census track location and risk of infection. Furthermore, we found weak evidence
between dietary exposure and risk of COVID-19 infection after adjusting for possible
confounders.
Conclusion: Crowding as indicated by household size increases risk for COVID-19 infection in
Latinx families. Exposure to secondhand smoke may also increase risk for COVID-19 through
increased coughing, respiratory impairment and increased travel of virus on smoke particles.
Public policy and health interventions need to ensure that multiunit residential complexes
prevent any exposure to secondhand smoke.

Background
COVID-19 in USA Latinx
The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has infected over 23.6 million individuals in the United
States and more than 394,495 have died (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020).
COVID-19 disease disproportionately affects US racial and ethnic minorities (Tai et al., 2020).
The Latinx community comprises 18% of the United States population but 33% of the confirmed
COVID-19 cases and 20% of all deaths (Rodriguez-Diaz et. al., 2020). Pediatric COVID-19
infection rates are also higher in US racial and ethnic minorities (Ranabothu et al., 2020). As of
fall 2020, there were 161,387 school-aged children with COVID-19 in the United States, 42% of
whom were Latinx children compared to 32% non-Hispanic White and 17% non-Hispanic Black
(Leeb et al. 2020). In California, Latinx’s children account for 47.9% of the state’s children, yet
represent 68.5% of all child COVID-19 cases and 50% of deaths (California Department of
Public Health, 2020).
Risk Factors in Latinx communities
Latinx adults comprise a large proportion of the country’s workforce but hold mostly low-paying
employment lacking benefits (Tran, 2019). When COVID-19 shelter-in-place began, 16.2% of
Latinx workers had the option to work from home in comparison to the 29.9% of White workers
(US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019). Household vulnerability increases risk for COVID-19
infection based on factors, such as crowding and the presence of multi-generational households
(Khazanchi et al., 2020). California Latinx households are more likely to reside in homes with
non-family members compared with non-Latinx households (Latino Caucus, 2017).
COVID-19 Environmental and Dietary Factors
Extended exposure to air pollution, including secondhand smoke, can increase infection risk and
mortality from COVID-19 by compromising respiratory health and increase risk for chronic
cough (Costello et. al., 2020; Fell et al., 2018; Roth, 2020; Harvard TH Chan School of Public
Health, 2020). Communities of color, including Latinx families, are more likely to be residing in
areas of high pollution than White counterparts (American Lung Association, 2020).

Shelter-in-place orders have also adversely impacted global nutritional health as individuals are
more likely to be consuming poorer-quality diets with more unhealthy eating practices (Ghosh,
2020; Khubchandani et al., 2020). Poor nutrition, including low levels of Vitamin D and
selenium, can increase susceptibility to illness including potentially risk of novel coronavirus
infection (Rhodes et. al, 2020; Bae et al., 2020). Western nutrition consisting of foods high in
saturated fats, sugars and refined carbohydrates activate the innate immune system while
deactivating the adaptive immune system resulting in inflammation and diminished defense
against viruses, including potentially COVID-19 (Butler et. al, 2020).
In our COVID-19 risk study, we sought to assess the relationship between environmental risk
factors including secondhand smoke exposure and nutritional health and COVID-19 infection in
an urban, inner-city Latinx population.
Methods
Recruitment
Families in the present study are part of three, longitudinal cohort studies of Latinx families: the
Hispanic Eating and Nutrition Study (HEN) (original N=201) (Kjaer et al, 2019; Wojcicki et al.,
2011), Latinx, Eating, and Diabetes Study (LEAD) (original N=97) (Ville et al., 2017; Wojcicki
et al. 2018), and the Telomeres at Birth Study (TAB) (original N= 424). HEN and LEAD
mothers were recruited during pregnancy primarily at Zuckerberg San Francisco General
Hospital (ZSFG) with a minority from UCSF Benioff whereas TAB participants were recruited
in the post-partum unit before hospital discharge (mostly at UCSF Benioff and the remaining at
ZSFG). Participants for these three studies have been followed over the course of 13, 8, and 1-2
years, respectively. Specifics of the studies have previously been described (Kjaer et al., 2019;
Wojcicki et al., 2011; Ville et al., 2017; Wojcicki et al., 2018).
We contacted participants in HEN, LEAD, and TAB telephonically from May through
September 2020 to partake in this COVID-19 sub-study. Participants gave their language
preference (Spanish or English) and were told information about the COVID-19 study by the
bilingual research coordinators (ADM, ME and MR) and the principal investigator (JW). Those

who chose to participate gave verbal consent for the 15-minute interview. We assessed COVID19 symptoms and lab-based testing, food consumption patterns during COVID-19, and current
employment and housing status. Participants received a $15 gift card to Amazon or Target as
compensation for study participation. The Committee on Human Research (CHR), the UCSF
Institutional Review Board approved all aspects of the study.
We used the CalEnviroScreen 3.0 (California Office of Environmental Health Hazard
Assessment, 2018) to assess levels of pollution by census tract in the state of California.
Specifically, CalEnviroScreen 3.0 determines California communities disproportionately
affected by pollution by examining pollution burden score and percentile.
Procedures
All participants were asked if they had symptoms consistent with COVID-19 from the start of
lockdowns in March 2020 until the time of the interview (May-September 2020). COVID-19
symptoms that we asked about included cough, fever, muscle aches, stomach-ache, diarrhea,
vomiting, sore throat, shortness of breath, COVID toes or loss of smell or taste.
All participants were asked if anyone in their household had undergone a COVID-19 test at a
doctor’s office, hospital or testing site. Households were determined to be positive for COVID19 if anyone reported a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR test), and/or symptoms
including loss of taste/smell. Other questions focused on household crowding including
household size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms and number of household members sharing
bedrooms and bathrooms. We also assessed the number of working days each week for
household members, and COVID-19 specific risk factors including the use of face masks in
public and the frequency of public transportation use.
At the baseline assessment of all families, we collected maternal primary language use (English,
Spanish, or bilingual) and education level (primary or less than a high school diploma, high
school diploma, some college or more). We also annually collected information on exposure to
secondhand smoke in the household. We were able to use the address of residence at the time of
the COVID-19 sub-study to find the CalEnviroScreen3.0 score for each participant to identify

the extent to participants were impacted by pollution including PM2.5 exposure, pesticide use,
diesel particulate matter and drinking water contamination (California Office of Environmental
Health Hazard Assessment, 2018).
Statistical Analysis
We combined HEN and LEAD cohorts for a total of 183 participants for analysis as recruitment
specifics and demographics of these cohorts are similar (both recruited at ZSFG primarily with
similar exclusion and inclusion criteria) (Kjaer et al., 2019; Wojcicki et al., 2011; Ville et al.,
2017; Wojcicki et al., 2018). The TAB cohort was analyzed separately and only participants
who identified as Latinx were included in the analysis (n=200). Data was assessed for normality
using graphical tests of normality and statistical tests including the Shapiro-Wilk and the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. As the data were not normally distributed, we used non-parametric
tests of association including the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the chi-square test to assess
measures of association for continuous and categorical data.
Variables that were significant in bivariate analysis at p<0.10 were included in multivariable
analyses. Other variables that have been shown to be associated with COVID-19 infection based
on biological plausibility were also included in models even if they did not meet the statistical
threshold. We ran separate analyses for the HEN/LEAD versus the TAB cohorts. We conducted
secondary multivariable analyses for both HEN/LEAD and TAB that included dietary factors
that were significant at p<0.20 as one of our primary outcomes of interest was the relationship
between nutritional health and COVID-19 infection. These models tended to be smaller as some
of the data was missing for food frequency and dietary recall. All analyses were conducted using
Stata 15.1.
Results
Of the 183 families in the combined HEN/LEAD cohorts, there were 14 families with cases
(7.6%) of COVID-19 reported. The TAB Cohort had 200 families and 7 cases of COVID-19
(3.5%) (Tables 1 and 4).
Socio-demographics

Larger household size was associated with COVID-19 infection in HEN/LEAD cohorts
6.2±2.7 versus 4.9±1.6 (p=0.02; Table 1). More family members sharing
bedrooms was also associated with increased risk for infection 2.9±1.5 versus 2.5 ±
1.2 (p=0.03; Table 1). Increasing number of people eating together approached statistical
significance for COVID-19 infection (p=0.07; Table 1). For the TAB cohort, a higher number of
children in the household was associated with increased risk for infection 3.3±1.3 versus 2.4±
1.1 (p=0.03; Table 4). A greater number of individuals eating together was
protective against infection (2.7±0.8 versus 3.8±1.2; p=0.01; Table 4). We did not find any
association between COVID-19 infection and maternal high school diploma, primarily Spanish
language use or Mexican origin (versus Central American or other Hispanic ethnicity) for
HEN/LEAD nor the TAB cohorts.
COVID-19 Prevention and Risk Associated Practices
We did not find statistically significant differences between COVID-19 prevention practices,
such as wearing masks and risk for infection (Tables 1 and 4). There was also no association
between COVID-19 and frequency of practices associated with elevated risk such as public
transportation use. Having household members working outside of the house trended towards
statistical significance in the TAB cohort with a higher percentage of families with a household
member infected working outside the home (100% versus 75.1%; p=0.13; Table 4).
Diet
We found a higher percentage of fast food consumption (>=2x/month) in HEN/LEAD among
those infected with COVID-19 with a trend towards statistical significance (66.7% versus 39.6%;
p=0.07; Table 1). Higher consumption of Mexican tortas (a fast food sandwich) was also greater
among those who were infected versus uninfected (>=2x/month), 25.0% versus 10.9%; (p=0.15;
Table 1). Beans were consumed more frequency by families with COVID-19 infection compared
to those families without COVID-19 infection (91.7% versus 70.8%; p=0.12; Table 1).
In the TAB cohort, there was a trend towards higher consumption of 100% fruit juice among
those infected with COVID-19 versus uninfected although results were not statistically
significant (66.7% versus 36.8%; p=0.14; Table 4). Other dietary intake factors including

consumption of fast food, sugar sweetened beverages and 100% fruit juice were not associated
with COVID-19 infection.
Secondhand Smoke Exposure and Environmental Pollution
There was a higher percentage of exposure to secondhand smoke in HEN/LEAD in those
families with COVID-19 infection (28.6% versus 18.2% for those uninfected) although the
differences were not statistically significant in bivariate analysis (p= 0.34; Table 1). We did not
find any association between pollution burden score or pollution burden percentile as indicated
on the Enviroscreen 3.0 related to COVID-19 infection (Table 1)
In TAB, a higher percentage of those with exposure to secondhand smoke had someone in the
household with COVID-19 (42.9% versus 11.4%; p=0.01; Table 4). There was no association
between pollution burden score or percentile as per Enviroscreen 3.0 and COVID-19 infection
(Table 4).
Multivariable findings
Independent predictors for COVID infection in HEN/LEAD include a higher number of
household members in the house (OR 1.43,95% CI 1.06-1.93; p= 0.02; Table 2). Increased
exposure to secondhand smoke trended towards statistical significance after adjusting for other
factors including number of household members, number of household members eating together
and number sharing a bedroom (OR 3.20, 95% CI, 0.80-12.73; p= 0.099; Table 2).
For the TAB cohort independent predictors for COVID-19 infection included a higher number of
household children (OR 1.82, 95% CI 0.98-3.37; p=0.06). Exposure to any secondhand smoke
trended towards statistical significance (OR 4.37, 95%CI 0.80-23.70; p=0.09; Table 5). There
was no association between risk of infection and any use of public transportation and maternal
education after adjusting for exposure to secondhand smoke and number of the children in the
household.
We did not find any association between dietary intake including consumption of sugarsweetened beverages, 100% fruit juice, Mexican tortas and beans with risk for COVID-19

infection after controlling for other risk factors including crowding associated ones and
secondhand smoke exposure (Tables 3 and 6).
Discussion
Household Crowding
Similar to previous studies, we found that household crowding is associated with COVID-19
infection. Since the start of the pandemic, most COVID-19 transmission occurs in the context of
close interpersonal interactions in the home (Rader et. al, 2020). In counties where there are high
levels of overcrowding, there is a strong association between COVID-19 infection and
overcrowding in the home (Richwine et. al, 2020). Overcrowding occurs when people in a home
surpass the home’s capacity to supply privacy, shelter, and space as per the WHO definition
(WHO Housing and Health Guidelines. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2018). Implications
of overcrowding include increased likelihood of infection and a greater prevalence of respiratory
ailments (California Department of Public Health, 2021). The most vulnerable populations for
crowding and housing difficulties include with mental illness, chronic health conditions, history
of trauma, immigrants, and ethnic/racial minorities (Anderson et. al, 2013; Braubach, 2011;
Dohler et. al, 2016; Jones, 2010). Similar to US-based studies, black, Asian and ethnic minorities
in the United Kingdom report increased risk for COVID-19 associated with household crowding
(Soltan et. al, 2020). Investment in adequate housing in the San Francisco Bay Area could reduce
risk for infection in high-risk populations including parts of the Latinx community, that have a
higher rate of household crowding.
Public Health Measures and Interventions to Reduce Household Crowding
Public health measures to reduce overcrowding have traditionally been at the individual level
(Shaw, 2004). Interventions for COVID-19 should minimize the number of contacts people with
COVID-19 infection have, particularly household contacts. In China, the government provides
COVID-19 infected individuals with space to quarantine outside the home and access to free
meals, internet, and telephone, thus limiting COVID-19 household transmission (Lai et. al.
2020). In California, hotels have been used as temporary housing locations for high-risk
populations, including homeless and health care workers at risk of COVID-19 infection but these
interventions have not extended to the general population (State of California, 2021).

Enforcing housing guidelines and codes may be a mechanism to address overcrowding and
ensure appropriate ventilation in units; however, there must be a safety net to help families
should they need to be relocated due to housing code violations (Krieger et. al, 2002).
Secondhand Smoking (SHS) and Environmental Pollutants
Secondhand smoke and environment exposures such as pollution increase risk for respiratory
illness (San Francisco Tobacco Free Project, 2016; Zeng et. al, 2019). Secondhand smoke
consists of more than 7,000 different chemicals from smoke exhaled by a smoker and additional
smoke from the cigarette (Center for Disease Control, 2020; San Francisco Tobacco Free
Project, 2016). In the United States, approximately 40,000 deaths per year are attributed to
secondhand smoke in non-smokers (San Francisco Tobacco Free Project, 2016). We found
increased risk associated with exposure to secondhand smoke in both cohorts although these
results only trended towards statistical significance. Future studies are needed with larger
sample sizes to confirm our findings. There was no association between COVID-19 infection
and environmental pollution exposures as indicated by census track data.
Secondhand smoke may facilitate transmission of COVID-19 as the virus attaches to particles
expelled by smokers and can travel longer distances (Curley, 2020). Viral particles can travel up
to six times farther than if the virus was simply in the air in the absence of smoke (Curley, 2020).
Furthermore, smokers tend to exhale more forcefully, and COVID-19 infected smokers could
have more particles pushed from their lungs to travel greater distances (Ries, 2020). Previous
studies suggest that Latinx households residing in multi-unit housing are exposed to secondhand
smoke at very high levels (Baezconde-Garbanati et. al, 2011) with children being the most
vulnerable (Zeng et. al, 2019). With pandemic stay-at-home orders in the greater Bay Area,
families may have limited options in a confined space particularly if a household member
smokes or there is smoking within a multi-unit residence.
Public Health Measures to Address Secondhand Smoke
Families living in densely packed urban areas or in multi-housing units that do not restrict
smoking can be impacted by secondhand smoke exposure (Pickett et. al, 2006). In California,

more than 60 cities and counties have 100% smoke free multi-housing units where smoking is
prohibited in privately-owned as well as publicly-owned residences. Bay Area municipalities
with 100% smoking free laws include Berkeley, Daly City, South San Francisco, Pacifica, and
Palo Alto (African American Nonsmokers Foundation, 2020). About two dozen municipalities in
California have laws partially restricting smoking in multi-housing units. Municipalities with
partial smoking restrictions are less stringent than the 100% smoking free laws as smoking is
restricted in some private units of multi-unit housing, yet do not mandate multi-unit homes to be
100% smoke-free (African American Nonsmokers Foundation, 2020). Municipalities in the Bay
Area with partial smoking laws include Fremont, Marin County and Pinole (African American
Nonsmokers Foundation, 2020).
Secondhand smoking is a concern in residential housing in San Francisco, where many of our
participants live (San Francisco Tobacco Free Project, 2016). In 2010, Health Code Article 19F
passed in San Francisco preventing smoking in shared areas in multi-unit buildings but allows
smoking in individual units and outdoors on private patios or balconies and on street curbs near
multi-unit complexes (San Francisco Tobacco Free Project, 2016). As such secondhand smoke
can easily seep between units through walls, ventilation systems, windows and doors. With the
growing usage of e-cigarettes, San Francisco has begun prohibiting vaping in any location where
there is no usage of traditional cigarettes with the law, SF Health Code Article 19N (2014) as
second hand vapor also has respiratory health impacts (San Francisco Tobacco Free Tobacco
Laws, 2019). However, second hand vapor can similarly travel between units in multi-unit
residential complexes.
In December 2020, San Francisco chose not to revise Health Code Article 19F and as such there
is no legislation in San Francisco to prohibit smoking inside private dwellings in complexes with
three or more units (Moench et. al, 2020; San Francisco Board of Supervisors, 2020). Although
Senate Bill-322 will continue to allow landlords to place smoking bans, residents in many multiuse units will continue to face exposure to secondhand smoke and potential increased risk for
COVID-19 in the context of COVID-19 exposure (Moench et. al, 2020; San Francisco Board of
Supervisors, 2020). Similarly, other East Bay and Peninsula cities where our participants reside

including Oakland, San Jose and Vallejo do not have any legislation restricting smoking in
multi-housing units.
In the context of COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates, families spend an increased amount of
time at home, with a greater risk for second-hand smoke exposure in the household if neighbors
or other household members smoke. There is greater urgency to reform smoking and housing
laws to protect residents in multi-unit dwellings.
Dietary Risk Factors for COVID-19
We did not find any statistically significant dietary risk factors for COVID-19 after adjusting for
crowding indices and exposure to secondhand smoke in multivariable models. In bivariate
analyses, increased consumption of beans/frijoles, Mexican tortas, fast food and 100% fruit juice
were associated with increased risk for infection. Families consuming more beans/frijoles
trended towards having COVID-19 infection more frequently than those eating beans with less
frequency possible as a marker of socioeconomic status. Beans are more likely to be
incorporated in the diet of individuals who are less socioeconomically privileged than in the diets
of people with greater resources (Medina et. al, 2020). Having beans in the home tends to
provide a sense of food security (Khor et. al, 2018). Future studies should investigate possible
links between frijoles/bean consumption, food insecurity, and COVID-19 infection.
Obesity is a major risk factor for COVID-19 and has shown to increase the risk of infection and
overall death as increased adiposity negatively impacts immune function and host defenses
(Popkin et. al., 2020; Milner et al., 2012). Latinx adults have higher rates of obesity compared
with whites; 44.8% versus 42.2% (CDC, 2020). As the novel coronavirus pandemic resulted in
changing eating behaviors and decreasing quality of diets in part due to food insecurity, there
may be greater risk for infection in families with higher consumption of fast foods, sugar
sweetened beverages or other food stuffs associated with obesity and metabolic disease
(Khubchandani et. al, 2020). Increased blood sugar levels in non-diabetics has also been linked
to more severe symptoms and poorer outcomes of COVID-19, such as ICU admission,
ventilation and death (Isler, 2020).

We found no statistically significant relationship between fast food, Mexican tortas and 100%
fruit juice consumption and COVID-19 infection, but the families in our cohorts who ate fast
food more than twice a month had more COVID-19 infection relative to individuals who ate fast
food less frequently. Fast food and 100% fruit juice consumption are associated with increased
risk for overweight and obesity and metabolic disease due to the high amount of sugar and fats in
these foods and future studies should investigate possible associations with risk for COVID-19
infection and COVID-19 progression (Janssen et. al, 2018). Our sample size was small for this
study and future studies should be conducted with larger population groups.
In previous studies, community exposure activities, including restaurant or coffee shop dining,
increase risk for COVID-19 infection (Fisher et al, 2020). In a study using cellphone data from
10 urban areas, restaurants were one of the riskiest places for COVID-19 transmission (Carey,
2020). Adults testing positive for COVID-19 infection were twice as likely to have dined at a
restaurant 14 days before coming ill compared to those testing negative (Fisher et. al, 2020).
Consumption of fast food, such as Mexican tortas or American style fast food, may be
synonymous with increased exposure to individuals outside the household or may suggest risk
associated with eating at restaurants.

Limitations and Conclusions
Limitations of this study include small sample size and number of COVID-19 infections. We
also did not directly test participants for COVD-19 but relied on self-reported results including
recall of COVID-19 related symptoms. Our assessment of secondhand smoke exposure was
collected annually and not directly before the start of COVID-19 in some cases and
environmental pollutant exposure was based on census track location, not at the household or
individual level. Lastly, we did not directly assess other forms of tobacco exposure including the
effects of e-cigarettes (vaping) on COVID-19 infections. While the prevalence of cigarette
smoking including vaping is lower among Latinxs than other racial and ethnic groups, the odds
of smoking increases with acculturation among the Latinx community (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, 2019; Wang et. al, 2019). Future COVID-19 policy measures in the San
Francisco Bay Area should include better implementation of housing guidelines to assure
adequate space and ventilation as well as greater inclusion of all individuals for benefits related

secondhand smoke exposure should restrict any exposures in multi-unit dwellings by banning
any smoking in multi-unit dwellings in San Francisco and other Bay Area cities that do not have
existing smoking bans.
