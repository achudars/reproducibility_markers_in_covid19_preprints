What is already known on this topic

22

Many infectious diseases present an environmental pattern in their incidence.

23

Environmental factors, such as climate and weather condition, could drive the space and time

24

correlations of infectious diseases, including influenza.

25

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be transmitted through

26

aerosols, large droplets, or direct contact with secretions (or fomites) as influenza virus can.

27

Little is known about environmental pattern in COVID-19 incidence.

28

What this study adds

29

The significant association between COVID-19 daily incidence and temperature was

30

confirmed, using 3 methods, based on the data on COVID-19 and weather from 31

31

provincial-level regions in mainland China.

32

Environmental factors were considered on the basis of SEIR model, and a modified

INTRODUCTION

63

In December 2019, an outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province,

64

China, and then were declared as an international public health emergency by the World Health

65

Organization (WHO) on January 30 2020. The disease was officially named as coronavirus disease

66

2019 (COVID-19) and the newly emerged virus was named as SARS-CoV-2 in February 2020.1

67

Previous studies on early cases showed that the disease severity of COVID-19 with a 2.3%

68

case-fatality rate,2 is much lower than Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute

69

Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).3 However, as Li et al. reported,4 the number of COVID-19 cases

70

doubled every 7.4 days between December 2019 and January 2020, indicating COVID-19 might be

71

more infectious than SARS and MERS. In March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was declared as a

72

global pandemic for the coronavirus rapidly expanded throughout China and to 116 other countries and

73

territories worldwide.

74

Many infectious diseases present an environmental pattern in their incidence. A few studies on

75

environmental issues, such as climate and weather condition, indicated that environmental factor could

76

drive the space and time correlations of infectious diseases.5-7 Based on analysis on climate predicators,

77

James D et al. found that humidity and temperature are optimal indicators in predicting influenza

78

epidemics in tropical regions.8 Temperate regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are

79

characterized by highly synchronized annual influenza circulations during their winter months

80

respectively.5 7 8 In the United States, an epidemiological study indicated that lower specific humidity

81

is related to the occurrence of pandemic influenza, which is consistent with earlier finding in laboratory

82

experiments.9 Absolute humidity, the actual mass of water vapor, is identified as a main cause of

83

seasonal influenza epidemics.10 The influenza presents significant seasonal fluctuation in temperate

84

monsoon climate regions as the absolute humidity varies greatly in summer and winter, which could

85

help the multiplication of virus.

86

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be transmitted through

87

aerosols, large droplets, or direct contact with secretions (or fomites) as influenza virus can.11 However,

88

the environmental pattern remains to be elucidated in COVID-19 incidence. Based on dynamical

89

equations, susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) modeling has been developed and used to

90

estimate key epidemic parameter to better characterize mechanism for the epidemic dynamics.12-14

91

Therefore, we explored the association between daily incidence and climate conditions using locally

92

weighted regression and smoothing scatterplot (LOESS) and distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs)

93

based on the data on COVID-19 and weather from 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China,

94

between Jan 20 and Feb 29, 2020. Furthermore, we took account of environmental factors on the basis

95

of SEIR model, and developed a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (M-SEIR) model

96

to characterize the climate impacts on epidemic dynamics.

city at the end of 2019 and rapidly spread across mainland China. Thus, population dynamic factors,

105

including birth rate and death rate, were not considered here. Finally, daily incidences among the 31

106

provincial-level regions and Wuhan city were calculated by dividing the number of new confirmed

107

cases by the population size at the end of 2018 respectively, and was reported per 100,000 population.

108

Daily temperatures (T) and relative humidity (RH) of 344 cities of the corresponding period were

109

collected from the meteorological authority in mainland China. Means of temperatures and absolute

110

humidity were further calculated for every provincial-level region. The Clausius-Clapeyron relation

111

equation was used to calculate absolute humidity (AH) as following:

17.67T

112

6.112 × e T + 243.5 × RH × 2.1674
AH =
273.15 + T

113

Data on climate conditions and population were retrieved from official reports previously released

114

in mainland China. Therefore, the ethical review was not required.

115

Statistical analysis

116

Trends of climate factors and daily COVID-19 incidence indicators, including the incidence and the

117

common logarithm of numbers of newly confirmed cases (lgN), were analyzed with locally weighted

118

regression and smoothing scatterplot (LOESS) in 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China from

Jan 20 to Feb 29, 2020.

125

and absolute humidity means of the sites in Hubei Province outside of Wuhan, were calculated as a

126

representative of Hubei Province data.

127

To better understand the potential environmental driver of COVID-19, we took account of

128

environmental factors on the basis of SEIR model and constructed the M-SEIR model to simulate the

129

COVID-19 outbreak dynamic in Wuhan after travel restriction was put into force. Further sensitivity

130

analysis was performed for quantitative risk assessment to evaluate the relationships between

131

environmental parameter and COVID-19 incidence.

141

80,981 cases of COVID-19 (cases of decrease in accounting not removed) was confirmed in 31

142

provincial-level regions in mainland China, between Jan 20 and Feb 29, 2020. Out of 80,981 cases,

143

68,034 (84.01%) were diagnosed in Hubei Province. Daily number of new confirmed cases and daily

144

incidence in mainland China were presented in Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1. Daily number of

145

cases peaked on Feb 12 and then it decreased, due to the adjustment in the diagnostic criteria of Hubei

146

Province. And the number of cases and the incidence in China (outside of Hubei Province) have begun

147

to decline early in Feb.

152

daily incidence indicators (daily incidence and lgN) increased as the absolute humidity rose and

153

declined slightly when absolute humidity reached approximately 7 g/m3 (Figure 3). Analysis for Hubei

154

Province (outside of Wuhan) and Wuhan showed highly similar results (Supplementary Figure 1 and

155

Supplementary Figure 2). Differences lay in the fact that cases clinically diagnosed without nucleic

156

acid testing had been counted as confirmed cases in Hubei Province since Feb 12, which might increase

157

potential bias in the model.

of Hubei Province), Hubei Province (outside of Wuhan) and Wuhan were presented as

160

three-dimensional plots in Figure 4 , compared with a reference value of 0 ºC. The plots showed

161

significant effect on COVID-19 incidence of temperature. In mainland China (outside of Hubei

162

Province), the highest RR (1.71, 95% CI: 1.28-2.27) was observed at a cold temperature (-6 ºC),

163

suggesting the COVID-19 incidence were most likely to increase at -6 ºC. The RR of 0.59 (95% CI:

164

0.44-0.78) at 6 ºC rose to 1.06 (95% CI: 0.96-1.18) when temperature dropped to -6 ºC. However, no

165

statistical significance was found in lag-specific relative risk at lag 2 to lag 4, suggesting no delayed

166

effect at any temperature. For example, the relative risk maintained at lag 2-4, as lag-specific RR was

167

1.14 (95% CI: 0.90-1.44) at lag 2 and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.86-1.33) at lag 4 when temperature was -6 ºC. In

168

Hubei Province (outside of Wuhan), RR was significantly higher at 8°C (RR 1.22, 95% CI: 1.07-1.38)

169

and 10 °C (RR 1.92, 95% CI: 1.21-3.03) in lag 0. Conversely, lag-specific RR ranged from lag 0 to lag

170

7 at 8-10 °C, suggesting positive delayed effect on decreasing COVID-19 incidence during the

171

condition. In Wuhan city, the highest RR 1.04 (95% CI: 0.92-1.17) without significance was observed

172

at approximately 9 ºC. However, the incidence was more likely to decrease with immediate and

173

delayed effect at a lower or higher temperature than 9 ºC. For example, RR was in a range of 0.64 (95%

174

CI: 0.46-0.87) to 0.88 (95% CI: 0.73-0.99) at lag 0 to 5 days when the temperature was 4 ºC and

similar results were observed when the temperature was 16 ºC.

181

humidity of 4 g/m3 (RR: 1.13, 95%CI:1.02-1.27), indicating COVID-19 incidence was more likely to

182

increase during the condition. When absolute humidity rose to 5 g/m3, values of lag-specific RR were

183

in range of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.36-0.99) to 0.62 (95% CI: 0.41-0.93) at lag 3 to lag 5 (Supplementary

184

Figure 3), indicating a strong delayed effect on COVID-19 incidence at absolute humidity of 5 g/m3. In

185

Hubei Province, immediate effect on reducing COVID-19 incidence was observed when absolute

186

humidity ranged from 4.5 g/m3 (RR 0.40, 95% CI: 0.19-0.84) to 5.5g/m3 (RR 0.65, 95% CI: 0.44-0.96)

187

(Supplementary Figure 4). However, no significant difference was observed in absolute humidity in

188

Wuhan city (Supplementary Figure 5).

189

Considering the environmental impacts, we constructed the M-SEIR model to simulate the

190

dynamic of COVID-19 by using the system dynamic section in AnyLogic software. SEIR dynamic

191

transmission model compartmentalized the population into four states including susceptible, exposed,

192

infected, and recovered, and further analyzed the relationships and interconnection using stock and set

193

parameters, flows and table function (Figure 5A; Supplemental video 1). We set the initial values of

194

the parameter and incorporated the temperature index in Wuhan city from Jan 20 and Feb 29, 2020,

195

into the modified SEIR model. Supplemental table 3 presented the comparison of modified SEIR

196

model in our study and classic SEIR models in similar studies. The four curves were stratified by types

197

of state, and showed a similar pattern: the population size increased early in epidemic and then

198

decreased as the period ends (e.g., due to recovery). As the M-SEIR model predicted, the number of

199

infections would peak around Mar 5, reaching the inflection point, and the COVID-19 outbreak in

200

Wuhan would be expected to end by late April (Figure 5B; Supplemental video 1). Furthermore, a

201

sensitivity analysis on the transmission rate adjusted by temperature indicated high stability of our

202

M-SEIR model (Figure 5C; Supplemental video 2). We set the transmission rate from 0 to 1 with a

step of to 0.1, and conducted the simulations to reduce the bias involving in the model, parameters, and

204

functional relationships. Finally, we found that the transmission rate decreased with the increase of

205

temperature, leading to the decrease of infection rate and outbreak size.

206

207

DISCUSSION

208

We inferred that the number of new confirm COVID-19 cases in mainland China peaked on Feb 1,

209

2020. COVID-19 daily incidence were lowest at -10

210

incidence was observed at the absolute humidity of approximately 7 g/m3. We found significant

211

association between temperature and COVID-19 daily incidence due to the immediate and delayed

212

effect observed using DLNMs. As predicted in M-SEIR model, the COVID-19 outbreak would peak

213

around March 5, 2020 and end in late April in Wuhan. Additionally, we found that transmission rate

214

decreased with the increase of temperature, leading to further decrease of infection rate and outbreak

215

size. Therefore, temperature drive the space and time correlations of COVID-19, and it can be used as

216

an optimal predicator.

℃ and highest at 10 ℃,while the maximum

217

In this study, we inferred the significant association between temperature and COVID-19 daily

218

incidence using LOESS, DLNMs and M-SEIR model, suggesting that temperature plays an important

219

role in the outbreak of COVID-19 and can be used in predicting the potential spread of COVID-19.

220

Lower and higher temperatures may be positive to decrease the COVID-19 incidence, which help to

221

shed new light on the environmental drivers of COVID-19 in China. Our results are in line with the

222

findings in SARS. Based on data on SARS and climate in 4 cities, Tan et al. found that temperature is a

223

powerful indicator for SARS-CoV transmission, in which the risk of increased daily incidence differed

224

between the effects of high and low temperatures.16 Additionally, Lowen’s laboratory work evidenced

225

that temperature affect the virus spread of aerosol using a guinea pig model.17 However, the

226

temperature DLNM in Hubei Province, showed different patterns from those in mainland China and

227

Wuhan city, as COVID-19 relative risk rose at a moderate temperature.

228

In our analysis, we failed to observe a significant relationship between absolute humidity and

229

COVID-19 incidence based on the data of mainland China. However, absolute humidity has been

230

reported as a strong correlation with influenza epidemic, due to the seasonal pattern that influences the

231

multiplications and spread of influenza.9 18 19 In another study on MERS, caused a lethality of more

232

than 35%, confirmed that the activity of MERS-CoV in droplet or aerosol, decreases significantly as

233

absolute humidity increases though the mechanism is not yet clear.20 The difference between our study

234

and previous finding may result from the fact that absolute humidity remained stable in a region during

235

a very limited period. Additionally, rapid and strong actions taken by the government could biased our

236

study. Despite of the negative consequence in our study, further studies on absolute humidity are

237

required to perform.

238

Combination of infectious disease dynamics model and environmental patterns is required to

239

better explain the relationship between environmental factors and infection.21 Dynamic transmission

240

model was usually performed to predict the genesis and development trend of infectious diseases as

241

well as to evaluate the effect of intervention but few dynamic transmission models included

242

environmental factors for the increasing uncertainty. However, to reveal the dynamic of an infectious

243

disease, it would be much better to take account of environmental impact on the basis of dynamic

244

transmission model.22 23

Environmental factors, characterized by lag effects and threshold effects, can target at two objects,

246

host and virus, during infectious disease outbreak. On one hand, human activity patterns and immunity

247

can be influenced by environmental factors. But the effect caused by environmental condition was

248

limited during the COVID-19 outbreak, due to the absence of extreme weather and specific immunity

249

for a newly emerging virus. On the other hand, environmental impacts on the SARS-CoV-2 are more

250

significant than the host population because the transmission and virulence of the virus varies in

251

different conditions. Finally, environmental impacts on transmission of virus should be characterized in

252

the dynamic model, because infectiousness estimated in the traditional dynamic model is actually a

253

confounding effect with environmental effect. It is necessary to take account of environmental issues

254

on the basis of dynamic transmission model so that the impacts could be isolated and qualified. A

255

dynamic model is not only compatible with the infectious disease transmission mode for virus itself,

256

but also can be well coupled with surveillance data on environmental issues.24 Consequently, we

257

constructed a M-SEIR model to correct the potential deviation of temperature to simulate the dynamic

258

epidemic of COVID-19. The M-SEIR model predicted that the outbreak would reach its peak reach an

259

inflection point around March 5, 2020, which is consistent with the actual situation based on data

260

released by the NHC.25-29 And it is expected that the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan would end in late

261

April. In addition, we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the temperature-adjusted transmission rate.

262

Finally, we found transmission rate decreased with the increase of temperature, leading to further

263

decrease of infection rate and epidemic size.

264

Our analysis is subject to limitations. First, the COVID-19 dynamics are determined by multiple

265

factors, including virus, climate, socio-economic development, population mobility, population

266

immunity, and urbanization. However, not all those factors were considered in this study. Second, the

267

parameters of M-SEIR models were optimized, based on the previous analysis which might be biased

268

by the lack of official data and the adjustment of diagnostic criteria in the outbreak. Third, it’s an

269

ecological analysis in very short period so that we cannot avoid the bias caused by other ecological

270

factors changed over time.

271

272

Conclusions and public health implications

273

Temperature is an environmental driver of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Lower and higher

274

temperatures might be positive to decrease the COVID-19 incidence. As predicted in M-SEIR model,

275

the COVID-19 outbreak would peak around March 5, 2020 and end in late April in Wuhan.

276

Modified-SEIR models help to better evaluate and identify national and international prevention and

277

intervention targeted COVID-19. The COVID-19 outbreak would not last for a long period of time

278

with the increase of temperature, but the scale of the outbreak would be influenced by the measures

279

taken among countries.
