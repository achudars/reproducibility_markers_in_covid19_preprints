Abstract
Background: The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has infected tens of

thousands of patients in China. Studies have forecasted future trends of the incidence of 2019nCoV infection, but appeared unsuccessful. Farr’s law is a classic epidemiology theory/practice
for predicting epidemics. Therefore, we used and validated a model based on Farr’s law to
predict the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China and 2 regions of high-incidence.
Methods: We extracted the 2019-nCoV incidence data of China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City
from websites of the Chinese and Hubei health commissions. A model based on Farr’s law was
developed using the data available on Feb. 8, 2020, and used to predict daily-incidence of 2019nCoV infection in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City afterward.
Results: We observed 50,995 (37001 on or before Feb. 8) incident cases in China from January
16 to February 15, 2020. The daily-incidence has peaked in China, Hubei Providence and Wuhan
City, but with different downward slopes. If no major changes occur, our model shows that the
daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV will drop to single-digit by February 25 for China and Hubei
Province, but by March 8 for Wuhan city. However, predicted 75% confidence intervals of dailyincidence in all 3 regions of interest had an upward trend. The predicted trends overall match
the prospectively-collected data, confirming usefulness of these models.
Conclusions: This study shows the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV in China, Hubei Province and
Wuhan City has reached the peak and was decreasing. However, there is a possibility of upward
trend.

The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus
(2019-nCoV) in China has infected about
38,800 patients, and claimed 1113 lives.
Studies have forecasted future trends of the
infection incidence of coronavirus,1 but
appeared unsuccessful, likely owing to the
recently-implemented
aggressive
2
interventions. Farr’s law is a classic
epidemiology theory/practice for predicting
epidemics.3,4 Therefore, we used and
validated a model based on Farr’s law to
predict the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV
infection in China and 2 regions of highincidence.

time. Assuming the future ratio 1’s and 2’s
would be the same as the mean of the past
five dates and ratio 2’s the same as the
mean of the last 10 days, we predicted the
ratio 1’s and daily incidence. Statistical
analyses were conducted using Stata
(version 15) and Joinpoint (NCI). All P values
were two-sided and a P<.05 was considered
statistically significant. The study is exempt
from institutional review board’s review
due to the use of publically available and
de-identified data.
Results | The daily-incidence was available
for China from January 16 to February 11,
2020, for Wuhan and Hubei from January
11 to February 11. Among various data
transformation formats, natural-logarithmtransformed incidence data were of normal
distribution, without significant log-linear or
linear association. The mean of ratio 2
before February 8, 2020 was 0.944 (quartile
0.886-1.051) for China, 0.982 (quartile
0.744-1.317) for Wuhan and 0.948 (quartile
0.768-1.207) for Hubei Province. The future
incidence was predicted based on the mean
or quartiles of ratio 2 and subsequently
inferred ratio 1’s. The daily-incidence
significantly decreased after February 8 in
all regions, and would continue decreasing
until reaching zero on February 25. Given
the lower quartile (25%) of ratio 2, the
incidence may reach zero by February 20,

Methods | We extracted the 2019-nCoV
incidence data of China, Hubei Province and
Wuhan City from websites of the Chinese
and Hubei health commissions, respectively.
The model was developed based on the
data available on Feb. 8, 2020, and
compared with the prospectively collected
data afterward. According to prior
reports,4,5 the ratio 1 was the ratio of a
given day’s incidence over that of the day
before. Dividing the ratio 1 of one day and
the day before resulted in ratio 2. The
possible normality of the ratio 2 was
examined using Skewness and Kurtosis tests
after various data transformations. After
identifying the best-fit data transformation
format, we examined the potential linear
and log-linear associations of incidence with

while based on the upper quartile (75%) of
ratio 2, the daily-incidence will keep
increasing and reach 3000 on February 25
(Figure). Hubei Province and Wuhan City
had a similar downward trend (Table). The
prospectively collected daily-incidence after
February 8 appeared to fall in the predicted
quartiles in all 3 selected regions.
Discussion | Mostly using Farr’s law, we
estimated the quartiles of 2019-nCoV dailyincidence in China, Hubei Province and
Wuhan City, and predicted the dailyincidence of these regions. Our results
imply that the daily-incidence has reached
its peak and will likely decrease
continuously in China, Hubei Province and
Wuhan City, while the predicted 75% CI of
their daily-incidence had an upward trend.
Therefore,
governments,
healthcare
providers and residents should be
cautiously optimistic, and recognize the
potential upward trend of daily-incidence. A
rapid growth in daily-incidence may occur
when the residents of high-prevalence
regions, such as Hubei Province, return to
their workplaces in low-prevalence regions
at the end of Chinese New-Year holidays.
Extreme caution thus should be used to
prevent such an upward trend.
Limitation
includes
possible
oversimplification of the disease’s natural
history by this model. However, our
prospectively-collected data and recent
works proved the usefulness of the Farr’s
law.5 This simple yet powerful method has
also successfully predicted the trends in
incidence of opioid overdose in the U.S.4
