Abstract
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, which was first identified
in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has rapidly spread all over China and across the
world. By the end of February 2020, the epidemic outside Hubei province in China
has been well controlled, yet the next wave of transmission in other countries may
have just begun. A retrospective modeling of the transmission dynamics would
provide insights into the epidemiological characteristics of the disease and evaluation
of the effectiveness of the strict measures that have been taken by central and local
governments of China. Using a refined susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR)
transmission model and a new strategy of model fitting, we were able to estimate
model parameters in a dynamic manner. The resulting parameter estimation can well
reflect the prevention policy scenarios. Our simulation results with different degrees
of government control suggest that the strictly enforced quarantine and travel ban

have significantly decreased the otherwise uncontrollable spread of the disease. Our
results suggest similar measures should be considered by other countries that are of
high risk of COVID-19 outbreak.

Summary
Background
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, which was first reported
in Wuhan and rapidly spread across the world, has been well controlled in China but
is only starting to take off in other countries. Here we provide a retrospective
modelling analysis of the transmission dynamics in China and evaluated the
effectiveness of the strict government control strategies.

Methods
We considerably refined the original susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR)
transmission model, and used the publicly available data from Jan 13rd to Feb 29th for
model fitting and parameter estimation in a dynamic manner considering effect of
prevention policies. We then used the estimated model parameters to simulate the
epidemic trend and transmission risk of the disease with various degrees of
government control.

Findings
The severity rate and the fatality rate remain unchanged during the whole epidemic.
While government intervention had a moderate effect on the incubation rate (σ), the
recovered rate (γ) endured several fold increase. Strikingly, a significant decrease in
the infectious rate (β ) was observed. Without government control, peak infected
cases in Wuhan would reach 7.78 million (70% of the whole population) and total
deaths could reach 319000 based on the current mortality rate (4.1%).

Interpretation
Our simulation results with different degrees of government control suggest that the
strictly enforced quarantine and travel ban have significantly decreased the
otherwise uncontrollable spread of the disease. Our results suggest similar measures
should be considered by other countries that are of high risk of COVID-19 outbreak.

Research in context
Evidence before the study
A global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been posing significant
threats to public health worldwide. By the end of February 2020, 87645 confirmed
cases are reported around the world, including 7330 severe cases and 2994 fatalities.
We searched PubMed and preprint archive for papers published up to Feb 29th, 2020,
using keywords “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “2019-nCoV”, and “novel coronavirus.”
We found several researches on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19; however,
only one preprint predicted the effect of government intervention in China with
incomplete epidemiological data.

Added value of this study
Since the epidemic is already close to its end in China except Wuhan city, we have
the opportunity to carry out a relatively complete retrospective analysis. We
optimized the SEIR model using a dynamic fitting approach, taking into account the
government measures and reached a much more precise fitting of the data
comparing to other studies published. We showed that the severity rate and the
fatality rate remain unchanged during the whole epidemic, suggesting the only
effective way to control the disease is to control the number of infections. While
government intervention had a moderate effect on the incubation rate (σ), it is

essential for increasing the recovered rate (γ), and for decreasing and stabilizing the
infectious rate (β). We also simulated the scenarios with various degrees of
government control which could be a useful tool to predict the necessity of
government intervention. An interactive online application was made available to the
public on Feb 24th, 2020.

Implications of all the available evidence
The COVID-19 outbreak has already been effectively controlled in China; however,
the risk of rapid global explosion is extremely high due to the high transmissive rate
of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The quarantine measures adopted by the Chinese
government are essential for the control of the COVID-19 epidemic.

Introduction
The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already
become an epidemic of global scale. Two months ago, on Dec 30th 2019, the first
confirmed case was officially reported by local authorities of Wuhan city, China1,2.
The pathogen was soon identified as a new coronavirus on Jan 7th 2020 and
tentatively named 2019-nCOV2,3 and later renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses4. However, strict control measures, including the
lockdown of Wuhan city did not take effect until Jan 23rd, by which time several
million people have already travelled outside Wuhan for the upcoming Chinese New
Year, spreading the disease all over China. By the end of January, confirmed cases
were reported by several other countries, leading to the declaration of Public Health
Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by WHO5 on Jan 30th. For the whole
month of February, rigorous prevention and control measures were taken by the
Chinese government and the whole country is literally in a lockdown state. The
necessity of these strict measures has been questioned both domestically and
internationally concerning the devastating effects on the global economy; and there
is also severe debate over when these control measures, including travel bans and

public gathering bans, should be lifted. However, the effectiveness of these strict
control measures has not been systematically evaluated using epidemiological data.
Here we provided a retrospective modelling-based evaluation of the effectiveness of
government control measures on COVID-19 in China. Using a well-recognized
susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, we fitted the public data by
taking the effect of prevention policies into consideration and achieved an almost
perfect fit for the real data. Key epidemiological parameters including incubation rate
(σ), infectious rate (β ) and recovered rate (γ) and were estimated in a dynamic
manner. These estimates were then used to parameterize our model and different
outcome scenarios were simulated with various degrees of government control. An
interactive web-based Shiny application based on our modelling is now available
online (http://compbio.nju.edu.cn/ncov2019/). Our findings may provide a useful
tool for analyzing the impact of control measures and predicting the transmission
dynamics in other countries.

Methods
Data collection
Daily cumulative number of confirmed cases, dead cases and recovered cases (from
Jan 13rd, 2020 to Feb 29th, 2020) infected by COVID-19 were collected from the
Tencent social networks (https://news.qq.com/zt2020/page/feiyan.htm); the daily
number of severe cases were obtained from official websites of the National Health
Commission of China and of health commissions of provinces, municipalities and
major cities. Overseas data were obtained from the official website of WHO
(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-repor
ts/). All collected data were double checked. By finalizing this manuscript, the period
of data coverage starts from mid-January to the end of February 2020.

Model, parameter estimation and simulation
The susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) compartmental model is one of
the best models to describe the epidemic of diseases with a latent phase like the
SARS-CoV-2. We adopted the following ordinary differential equation (ODE) model to
simulate the epidemic of COVID-19 for each investigated population:

where S, E, I, and R were the number of susceptible, latent (or exposed), infectious,
and removed individuals (including recovered individuals and death) at time t
and N

is the size of population. We assume that N is constant

in a investigated population. In the SEIR model, the infectious rate, β , controls the
rate of spread which represents the probability of transmitting disease between a
susceptible and an infectious individual. The incubation rate, σ, is the rate of latent
individuals becoming infectious (average duration of incubation is 1/σ). Recovery
rate, γ, is the rate of infectious individuals removed from the transmission system,
which is determined by the average duration of infection.
We suppose that the epidemic spreading trend of COVID-19 suffered the first period
of free propagation (before Jan 23rd, 2020) and then under the health policies
intervention. Therefore, there is no one-fit-all set of parameters to fit the model with
the aggregate data. Instead, we assume that the model parameters dynamically
changed during the epidemic course and was dependent on the degree of prevention.
Based on such an assumption, we inferred the model parameters in a stepwise
manner at each time point, using the latest officially confirmed infected data. We
then investigated the pattern of parameter dynamics and correlated these with
various prevention measures in different populations. As expected, the pattern of

estimated parameter (especially the infectious rate β) dynamics can well reflect the

Statistical analysis
If not specified, all statistical analyses and data visualization were done in R (version
3.6.2). We used non-parametric tests to assess differences among different group
(Wilcoxon test to compare two groups and Kruskal-Wallis test to compare three or
more groups). We used R packages such as ggplot2 and plotly for graphics.

Results
Since the impact of an epidemic depends on both the number of persons infected
and the spectrum of clinical severity, we first analyzed the change of severity rate
and the fatality rate over time and found that both parameters remain unchanged
over the investigated phase for each province and are not affected by the strictness
of control measures (Fig. 1), indicating that total number of severe cases and deaths
are largely determined by the total number of infections, thus supporting the
importance and urgency of outbreak prevention and control of transmission.

The susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) transmission model is one of
the best models to describe the epidemic of diseases with a latent phase. However, it
is only accurate under conditions of no intervention. In the real world, various
degrees of intervention have been adopted; as a result, the SEIR model does not
truly reflect the spread of the epidemic. To solve this discrepancy, we optimized the
model in a stepwise manner at each time point, using the latest official confirmed
infected data to fit the SEIR model. We thus obtained dynamic changes of the three
model parameters: infectious rate (β), incubation rate (σ) and recovered rate (γ) (Fig.

2A). As expected, incubation rate (σ) shows little to none change over time (Fig.
2B,C). In this regard, the average duration of incubation is estimated to be 5.9 days
based on data in Wuhan, which is generally in agreement with existing reports7–10.
While recovered rate (γ) shows a slow but steady increase over time (Fig. 2D), the
infectious rate dramatically changed during the whole outbreak process (Fig. 2B,E).
The national infectious rate clearly peaked around Jan 23rd, the day of Wuhan
lockdown and has continued to drop ever since. This trend is more apparent when
analyzing the data of Wuhan city alone (Fig. 2E). The curve for other cities displayed
a continuous descending trend from the beginning of the available data point
(around Jan 20th, the city of Nanjing was shown as an example in Fig. 2E), when strict
control measures have already been in place. In Wuhan, the recovery rate (γ) has
continued to increase with more than 2-fold change which is probably due to the
dramatic improvement of medical conditions, such as the immobilization of
thousands of physicians from all over the country and immediate establishment of
several new hospitals in Wuhan. These data indicate a significant correlation
between the infectious rate (β ) and the recovery rate (γ) with prevention and control
measures.
Next, we simulated the possible outcome scenarios with different degrees of
government prevention. Assuming there is a direct correlation with the value of
infectious rate and the strictness of prevention measures (as shown in Fig. 2), we
simulated the outbreak dynamics in different prevention scenarios using different

estimated parameters in Wuhan (Fig. 3A). In the case of low to no prevention (with
high infectious rate at the early stage), the peak of predicted infection cases would
eventually reach ca. 7.78 million, covering 70% of the whole population of Wuhan
city. The number of potentially infected individuals dramatically reduce as the
infectious rate decreases upon prevention interventions (Fig. 3B). These data suggest
that strict prevention is vitally important to reduce the peak of infection cases.
Using a similar approach, we next modeled all the publicly available data on several
different countries that already have considerable amounts of confirmed cases and
predict their epidemic curve with various degrees of government control, assuming
similar transmission properties of the virus in different counties (Fig. 4).In Singapore,
where only mild government intervention existed, a surprisingly continuous decrease
in the infectious rate (β ) and increase in the recovery rate (γ) was observed, implying
the potential inhibitory effect of warm climate on the spreading of the virus; whereas
the situation in Italy, Korea, and Iran are quickly deteriorating. For Japan, although
the infectious rate (β) is getting better, the recovery rate (γ) is not, implying either a
latency in hospitalization or lack of dedicated medical resources.

Discussion
By the end of February 2020, two months after its outbreak in Wuhan, the COVID-19
epidemic has already spread to more than fifty countries. Areas with a high risk of
exponential outbreak include Japan, South Korea, Italy, Singapore and Iran. Since the
situation in China has already been well controlled, a retrospective evaluation of the
epidemiological characteristics and transmission dynamics would provide valuable
insights that might help with disease control decisions world-wide. To our knowledge,
our work is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of government control on the
spread of COVID-19 using a modelling approach.
In agreement with others11–14, we found the SEIR-like models to be the most

appropriate model for analyzing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. However,
the traditional approach for fitting the SEIR model is based on the overall trend data
of the epidemic using hypothesized parameters and thus the model do not well fit
the real-life data (i.e. the real-life data trend does not conform to the ideal SEIR
model curve). The main reason is that the traditional approach does not take into
account the impact of prevention and control strategies on the epidemic dynamics.
In this study, we adjusted the SEIR model to objectively reflect the impact of
prevention and control strategy on the infectious rate. Nonetheless, our study has
several major limitations. Firstly, we were not able to derive a generalized model with
finalized parameters to fit the overall epidemic spreading. Instead, the model
parameters were estimated in a dynamic manner in our study. This is in line with the
observation of dynamic transmission properties of the virus15. Secondly, the
significance of the model largely depends on the accuracy of estimated parameters.
Although there is not a golden standard so far to evaluate the accuracy of our model
parameters, the estimated duration of incubation (1/σ) from our model-derived
parameter incubation rate (σ) is highly in agreement with previous estimations by
other studies7–10, and the dynamic values of the infectious rate (β ) is within the range
of the recent estimation by Yang et al.14. These observations suggest our approach
for model parameter estimation is plausible. Thirdly, our epidemic forecast was
somehow sensitive to our prediction of parameters which were estimated from their
overall dynamic patterns. Nonetheless, such forecasting would still be accurate in a
short period. In this regard, artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired methods14,16 may be
alternatives to epidemiological models for the real-time forecasting of transmission
dynamics of COVID-19.
The fact that the severity and the fatality rate remain unchanged during the whole
epidemic course suggests that the biology of the virus itself did not change over time;
this is in line with genetic sequencing results that few mutations are identified
among virus samples collected from different generations of patients17,18. However, it
is hard to predict whether this feature of the virus will change as it spread in other

countries. The significantly higher reported fatality rate in Wuhan city and Hubei
province comparing to other regions are probably due to the shortage of medical
supplies and the underestimation of total cases of infection. The lessons in Wuhan
also taught us that if the outbreak in a heavily populated metropolitan area is not
well controlled soon enough, rapid saturation of the hospital capacity is inevitable
and devastating. Therefore, the only effective way is to control the epidemic is to
mitigate transmission (infectious rate) and this has proved to be successful in China.
There is no doubt that the capability of management and control of COVID-19
transmission heavily rely on the preparedness of a country’s health system. While it
remains debatable whether large economy bodies in Asia such as South Korea and
Japan should adopt similar control measures as the Chinese government; in less
developed countries with insufficient medical resources and absence of a pandemic
preparedness plan, a mild response might be inadequate to deal with such an
outbreak. Extreme quarantine and transport control measures similar to China
should be considered to mitigate local transmission following confirmed importation.
In conclusion, we have constructed an SEIR model and fitted all the publicly available
China COVID-2019 data in a dynamic manner, and get a fairly accurate model of the
whole process of the epidemic in China. We estimated the overall fatality rate to be
0.68% outside of Hubei province. Through simulation, we also evaluated the
importance and effectiveness of strict government control enforced by Chinese
authorities. It is clear that the control measures, both in Wuhan and nationwide,
have significantly reduced transmissibility. Considering the potential threat of fast
worldwide COVID-19 outbreak to public health and global economy, more strict
government controls are advised based on the China experience.

Figures
Figure 1. The severity rate and the mortality rate of COVID-19 in mainland China from
Jan 13rd to Feb 29th, 2020. Heatmaps showing the severity ratio (A) and the mortality
rate (B) in different provinces or municipalities of mainland China. The monotonic
distribution of data over time was assessed by Mann-Kendall trend tests. P-values
adjusted were corrected with the Benjamini-Hochberg method in order to control
the false discovery rate. “*” indicates an adjusted p-value < 0.001. Scatter plots
showing the positive correlation of the number of severe cases (C) or mortality (D)
and infected cases on Feb 29th, 2020.

Figure 2. Parameter estimation of the SEIR transmission model. (A) Heatmap
showing the dynamic change of estimated parameters of the SEIR model over time.
In order to compare data among different cities, only relative values are shown in the
heatmap. Data for example cities (in red) are shown in (C-E). (B) Fold changes of the
three parameters of the SEIR model. Dynamics of estimated σ (C) or γ (D) parameters
over time in Wuhan. (E) Dynamics of estimated β parameter over time in the
population of mainland China (left), Wuhan city (middle) and Nanjing city (right). In
this figure, the modeling analysis was performed in the populations of the Hubei
province, mainland China as well as the top 44 cities of the whole mainland China.
Dash lines indicate the date of lockdown of Wuhan.

Figure 3. Simulation of epidemic spreading in Wuhan starting with different
prevention scenarios. (A) Simulation analysis showing the predicted confirmed
individuals based on estimated values of the β parameter at different time points. β
values are high at the early stage and low at the late stage, as indicated in the color
legend. Arrow shows the change of epidemic curve under different prevention
scenarios. (B) Relationship between the estimated β parameter and the peak of
predicted confirmed individuals using the corresponding β value.

Figure 4. Analysis of the COVID-19 data outside of China, with a focus on the
outbreak in February. The reported infected cases (A) and mortality (B) in the top five
countries and the Diamond Princess ship in February 2020. Heatmaps show the
dynamic change of estimated parameters β (C) and γ (D) of the SEIR model over time.
