Abstract

22

Background: At present, PCR-based nucleic acid detection cannot meet the demands

23

for coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) diagnosis.

24

Methods: 214 confirmed COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the General

25

Hospital of Central Theater Command of the People’s Liberation Army between

26

January 18 and February 26, 2020, were recruited. Two Enzyme-Linked

27

Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits based on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid

28

protein (rN) and spike protein (rS) were used for detecting IgM and IgG antibodies,

29

and their diagnostic feasibility was evaluated.

30

Results: Among the 214 patients, 146 (68.2%) and 150 (70.1%) were successfully

31

diagnosed with the rN-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively; 165 (77.1%) and

32

159 (74.3%) were successfully diagnosed with the rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs,

33

respectively. The positive rates of the rN-based and rS-based ELISAs for antibody

34

(IgM and/or IgG) detection were 80.4% and 82.2%, respectively. The sensitivity of

35

the rS-based ELISA for IgM detection was significantly higher than that of the

36

rN-based ELISA. We observed an increase in the positive rate for IgM and IgG with

37

an increasing number of days post-disease onset (d.p.o.), but the positive rate of IgM

38

dropped after 35 d.p.o. The positive rate of rN-based and rS-based IgM and IgG

39

ELISAs was less than 60% during the early stage of the illness 0-10 d.p.o., and that of

40

IgM and IgG was obviously increased after 10 d.p.o.

41

Conclusions: ELISA has a high sensitivity, especially for the detection of serum

42

samples from patients after 10 d.p.o, it can be an important supplementary method for

Introduction
The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1),

48

which emerged in Wuhan, China, is caused by a novel coronavirus named severe

49

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (2-4). As of March 1, 2020,

50

more than 80,000 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported in China (5), and the

51

disease has spread over 58 countries in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America

52

(1). On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a Public

53

Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

54

SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses

55

(4) that are able to infect humans. Genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2

56

identified it as a Beta coronavirus and showed it is closely related (with 96% identity)

57

to Bat CoV RaTG13, but distinct from SARS-CoV (6). SARS-CoV-2 has a

58

receptor-binding domain (RBD) structure similar to that of SARS-CoV. Functionally

59

important ORFs (ORF1a and ORF1b) and major structural proteins, including the

60

spick (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, are also well

61

annotated (7). According to previous reports, the M and E proteins are necessary for

62

virus assembly (8, 9). The S protein is important for attachment to host cells, where

63

the RBD of S protein mediates the interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2

64

(ACE2) (6). The S protein is located on the surface of the viral particles and has been

65

reported to be highly immunogenic (10). The N protein is one of the major structural

66

proteins of the virus and is involved in the transcription and replication of viral RNA,

67

packaging of the encapsidated genome into virions (11, 12), and interference with cell

68

cycle processes of host cells (13). Moreover, in many coronaviruses, including

69

SARS-CoV, the N protein has high immunogenic activity and is abundantly expressed

70

during infection (14-16). Both S and N proteins may be potential antigens for

71

serodiagnosis of COVID-19, just as many diagnostic methods have been developed

72

for diagnosing SARS based on S and/or N proteins (10, 14-17).

73

Currently, diagnosis of COVID-19 is confirmed by RNA tests with real-time

74

(RT)-PCR or next-generation sequencing. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2

75

mainly infects the lower respiratory tract, and that viral RNA can be detected from

76

nasal and pharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (3, 6, 18). However,

77

the collection of the lower respiratory samples (especially BAL) requires both a suction

78

device and a skilled operator. A previous study showed that except for BAL, the sputum

79

from confirmed patients possessed the highest positive rate, ranging from 74.4% to

80

88.9%. The positive rate of nasal swabs ranged from 53.6% to 73.3%, and throat swabs

81

collected 8 days post-disease onset (d.p.o.) had a low positive rate, especially in

82

samples from mild cases (19). The viral colonization of the lower respiratory tract and

83

the collection of different respiratory specimens cause a high false negative rate of real

84

time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) diagnosis.

85

Therefore, with the current tests it is difficult to achieve a meaningful assessment of

86

the proportion of symptomatic patients that are infected, and a rapid and accurate

87

detection method of COVID-19 is urgently needed. Serological assays are accurate

88

and efficient methods for the screening for many pathogens, as specific IgM and IgG

89

antibodies can be detected with ELISA, which has relatively high throughput capacity

and less stringent specimen requirements (uniformly serum collection) than

91

RNA-based assays.

92

The present study was conducted to evaluate the performance of rN-based and

93

rS-based ELISAs to detect IgM and IgG antibodies in human serum against

94

SARS-CoV-2. A total of 214 clinical serum samples from confirmed COVID-19

95

patients and 100 samples from healthy blood donors were tested with the rN-based

96

and rS-based ELISAs.

Patients and samples

100

A total of 214 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, hospitalized in the General

101

Hospital of the Central Theater Command of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA)

102

between January 18 and February 26, 2020, were recruited. The general information

103

was extracted from electronic medical records. All of the patients were

104

laboratory-confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR using pharyngeal swab

105

specimens, and at a median of 15 d.p.o. (range, 0–55 days). Serum samples from 100

106

healthy blood donors were selected as controls. This study was approved by the

107

Hospital Ethics Committee of the General Hospital of the Central Theater Command

108

of the PLA ([2020]003-1) and the written informed consent was waived for emerging

111

The recombinant nucleocapsid (rN) protein-based ELISA kit (Lizhu, Zhuhai,

112

China) was used for the detection of IgM or IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2. For

113

IgM detection, ELISA plates were coated with monoclonal mouse anti-human IgM (μ

114

chain) antibody. Serum sample (100 μL, diluted 1:100) was added to the pre-coated

115

plates, and plates were incubated at 37 ℃ for 1 h. Three replicates of each sample or

116

control were included on each plate. After washing, 100 μL horseradish peroxidase

117

(HRP)-conjugated rN protein of SARS-CoV-2 was added. Then, the plate was

118

incubated at 37 ℃ for 30 min, followed by washing. TMB substrate solution (50 μL)

119

and the corresponding buffer (50 μL) were added, and samples were incubated at

120

37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 50 μL of 2 M sulfuric acid,

121

and the absorbance value at 450 nm (A450) was determined. The cutoff value was

122

calculated by summing 0.100 and the average A450 of negative control replicates.

123

When A450 was below the cutoff value, the test was considered negative, and when

124

A450 was greater than or equal to the cutoff value, the test was considered positive.

125

For IgG detection, ELISA plates were coated with rN protein. Serum sample (5 μL)

126

diluted in 100 μL dilution buffer was added to the plates. After incubation and

127

washing, HRP-conjugated monoclonal mouse anti-human IgG antibody was added to

128

the plates for detection. The other operation steps were performed as described above

129

for IgM detection. The cutoff value was calculated by summing 0.130 and the average

130

A450 of negative control replicates. When A450 was below the cutoff value, the test was

131

considered negative, and when A450 was greater than or equal to the cutoff value, the

132

test was considered positive.

133

rS-based ELISA

134

The rS-based ELISA kit (Hotgen, Beijing, China) was developed based on the

135

RBD of the recombinant S polypeptide (rS). For IgM antibody testing, serum samples

136

(diluted 1:100) and negative and positive controls were added to the wells of the

137

rS-coated plates in a total volume of 100 μL, and plates were incubated at 37 ℃ for

138

30 min. After five wash steps with washing buffer, 100 μL of diluted HRP-conjugated

139

anti-human IgM antibodies was added to the wells, and samples were incubated at 37 ℃

140

for 30 min. After five wash steps with washing buffer, 50 μL of TMB substrate

141

solution and 50 μL of the corresponding buffer were added, and samples were

142

incubated at 37 ℃ for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 50 μL of 2 M

143

sulfuric acid, and A450 was measured. The IgG antibody was determined by a standard

144

ELISA procedure as described above, except that serum sample was diluted 1:20, and

145

the detector was HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG. The cutoff values of IgM and IgG

146

were calculated by summing 0.250 and the average A450 of negative control replicates.

147

When A450 was below the cutoff value, the test was considered negative, and when

148

A450 was greater than or equal to the cutoff value, the test was considered positive.

149

Statistical analysis

150

Categorical variables were expressed as the counts and percentages and compared

151

using the chi-square test, while the Fisher exact test was used when the data were

152

limited. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22.0. A two-sided

153

P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

156

Performance of serological assays by rN-based and rS-based ELISA

157

The serum samples were collected from 214 COVID-19 patients who were

158

confirmed by qRT-PCR and hospitalized in the General Hospital of the Central

159

Theater Command of the PLA. Of the 214 serum samples, 146 (68.2%) and 150

160

(70.1%) were identified as positive by the rN-based IgM and IgG ELISAs (Table 1),

161

respectively. IgM and/or IgG means that one of them or both were detected in serum

162

samples; 172 (80.4%) serum samples were positive by rN-based ELISA (Fig. 1). The

163

numbers of positive results with IgM, IgG, and IgM and/or IgG detected by rS-based

164

ELISA were 165 (77.1%), 159 (74.3%), and 176 (82.2%), respectively (Table 1 and

165

Fig. 1).

166

To study the production of antibodies in COVID-19 patients, we analyzed the

167

positive rates of IgM and IgG in serum samples of all patients post-disease onset.

168

Based on the number of days from disease onset to serum collection, patients were

169

divided into seven groups: 0–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, 21–30, 31–35, and >35 d.p.o.

170

The median number of d.p.o. of serum sample collection was 15 (range, 0–55 days).

171

The positive rates of IgM and IgG detected by the rN- and rS-based ELISAs in

172

different groups are shown in Table 1. For rN-based ELISA, a clear increase in IgM

173

and IgG positive rates was observed (Fig. 2a). The positive rates of IgM and IgG were

174

low at 0–5 d.p.o. and 6–10 d.p.o., and the positive rate of IgM was higher than that of

175

IgG at 6–10 d.p.o. and much lower after 35 d.p.o. (Fig. 2a), illustrating the dynamic

176

pattern of acute viral infection where IgG concentrations rise as IgM levels drop. The

177

IgM and/or IgG positive rate was 88.9% at 11–15 d.p.o., and more than 90% at later

178

stages of the disease (Table 1).

179

For rS-based ELISA, a similar trend of IgM and IgG positive rates was observed

180

(Fig. 2b). The positive rate of IgM is a little higher than that of IgG at different

181

disease stages, except >35 d.p.o., possibly due to the higher sensitivity of rS-based

182

IgM detection (77.1%) than IgG detection (74.3%) (Table 1).

183

To verify the specificity of the ELISA assays, 100 samples from healthy blood

184

donors were analyzed. No positive result was found in both rN- and rS-based IgM and

185

IgG ELISAs.

186

Comparison of rN- and rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs for diagnosis of

187

SARS-CoV-2

188

The sensitivity of the rS-based IgM ELISA was significantly higher than that of

189

the rN-based ELISA (P < 0.05). No significant difference between rS- and rN-based

190

ELISAs was observed for detecting IgG and total antibodies (IgM and IgG) (Fig. 1).

191

The positive rates of the rN- and rS-based ELISAs for the detection of IgM and/or

192

IgG in serum samples collected from patients at different stages of the disease are

193

shown in Table 1. Within 15 d.p.o., for detecting IgM, which is an important marker

194

for early infection, rN- and rS-based ELISAs detected 57.9% (66/114) and 63.2%

195

(72/114) of patients, indicating that the performance of the rS-based IgM

196

immunoassay seems better than that of the rN-based assay, but there is no statistical

197

difference between the two results. The positive rate of the rS-based ELISA for IgM is

198

significantly higher than that of the rN-based ELISA at 16–20 d.p.o(Table 1). No

199

significant difference between the two antigen-based ELISAs was observed for IgM

200

detection in other groups. For IgG detection, there was no significant difference

201

between the two kits in all groups.

202

In this study, the rN- and rS-based ELISAs for detecting IgM and IgG in 214

203

COVID-19 patients were evaluated (Table 2). In total, the detected positive rate

204

(174/214, 81.3%) for IgM by the two kits was significantly higher than that of the

205

rN-based ELISA kit alone (68.2%; P < 0.01), but was not significantly different from

206

that of the rS-based kit alone. For IgG, 172 of 214 (80.4%) were identified positive by

207

both kits. This sensitivity is significantly higher than that detected by only the

208

rN-based ELISA (70.1%, P < 0.05) and is not significantly different from that of the

209

rS-based ELISA.

Discussion

212

The recent outbreak and rapid spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pose

213

a great threat of a pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 to the world. Diagnostic methods

214

are the frontline strategy for recognizing this disease. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 can be

215

detected using RT-PCR, but inadequate access to reagents and equipment, the

216

requirement to upscale lab facilities with restrictive bio-safety levels and technical

217

sophistication, and the high rate of false negative results caused mainly by an

218

unstandardized collection of respiratory specimens have resulted in low efficiency of

219

in-time detection of the disease. Although previous studies have shown that

220

virus-specific IgM and IgG levels allow for serologic diagnosis of SARS (15, 20), less

221

amount of data on the serologic diagnosis using antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are

222

available.

223

In this study, we evaluated immunoassays for the detection of antibodies against

224

SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, we evaluated IgM and IgG production and their diagnostic

225

value. rN- and rS-based ELISAs were used to detect IgM and IgG in serum samples

226

of confirmed COVID-19 patients. The results revealed that the rS-based ELISA is

227

more sensitive than the rN-based one in the detection of IgM antibodies (Fig. 1). We

228

speculate that this difference is due to the relatively high sensitivity and early

229

response to the S antigen compared to the N antigen in patients with COVID-19. We

230

divided the patients into different groups according to the number of d.p.o. and

231

observed an increase in the IgM and IgG positive rate with time, except the IgM

232

positive rate decreased at >35 d.p.o. (Fig. 2). This dynamic pattern is consistent with

233

that observed in acute viral infection, with the IgG concentration rising gradually as

234

IgM levels drop after one month post-disease onset. The positive rates of IgM and IgG

235

antibodies in samples tested by the rN- and rS-based ELISAs were about 30%–50% in

236

the 0–5 d.p.o. and 6–10 d.p.o. groups (Table 1 and Fig. 2). This may be due to the low

237

antibody titers in early stages of the disease. Our results showed that IgM and/or IgG

238

of SARS-CoV-2 might be positive (88.9% by rN-based ELISA, 90.7% by rS-based

239

ELISA) at 11–15 d.p.o. (Table 1), which is to a certain extent in accordance with a

240

previous publication about SARS, which reported that detection of antibodies to

241

SARS-CoV could be positive as early as 8–10 d.p.o. and often occurs around day 14

242

(15). We observed a decreased positive rate of IgM at > 35 d.p.o.; unfortunately, we

243

could not collect the samples from these patients after discharge. Combined, rN- and

244

rS-based ELISAs for IgM and IgG detection were more sensitive than the rN-based

245

ELISA alone, but there was no significant difference when compared with the

246

rS-based ELISA. Therefore, combined use of rN- and rS-based ELISAs is not

247

recommended for COVID-19 diagnosis; however, if an ELISA kit coated with a

248

cocktail of N and S polypeptides shows better results, further evaluation is needed.

249

This study demonstrated that rN- and rS-based ELISAs can be an important

250

screening method for COVID-19 diagnosis, with high sensitivity, especially for the

251

analysis of serum samples from patients after more than 10 d.p.o. However, the

252

rS-based immunoassay is recommended for early screening of suspected COVID-19

253

patients with negative PCR test results. The ELISA serodiagnosis can be a

254

supplementary method to RT-PCR for COVID-19 diagnosis. ELISA can be used to

255

quickly screen all febrile patients effectively, as large-scale confirmation or exclusion

256

of patients is essential for controlling the disease.
