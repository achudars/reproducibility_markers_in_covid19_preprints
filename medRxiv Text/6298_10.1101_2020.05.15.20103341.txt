Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections can cause
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which manifests with a range of severities from mild
illness to life threatening pneumonia and multi-organ failure. Severe COVID-19 is
characterized by an inflammatory signature including high levels of inflammatory cytokines,
alveolar inflammatory infiltrates and vascular microthrombi. Here we show that severe
COVID-19 patients produced a unique serologic signature, including increased IgG1 with
afucosylated Fc glycans. This Fc modification on SARS-CoV-2 IgGs enhanced interactions
with the activating FcγR, FcγRIIIa; when incorporated into immune complexes, Fc
afucosylation enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines by monocytes, including IL-6
and TNF. These results show that disease severity in COVID-19 correlates with the presence
of afucosylated IgG1, a pro-inflammatory IgG Fc modification.

Antibody responses to viral infections in humans are varied and of widely divergent clinical
significance. Pre-existing, reactive antibodies or antibodies that are formed early during infection
can bind to virus particles, forming immune complexes that can neutralize or mediate clearance of
the virus. On the other hand, immune complexes can also promote inflammation and exacerbate
symptoms of disease. How antibodies within immune complexes modulate infection depends, in
part, on their Fc domain structure. Fc structure, in turn, dictates interactions with Fcγ receptor
(FcγRs) that are expressed by a variety of cells that are activated during infection1.

Antibody isotypes, IgG, IgA, and IgM are a primary determinant of Fc-structure and thus of
activity. Initial B cell responses are characterized by the production of IgM antibodies. Production
of class-switched IgA and IgG antibodies follows, IgA playing a central role in mucosal immunity
while IgG is the dominant isotype involved in systemic antiviral immunity. IgG functions are
governed by interactions between immune complexes and effector immune cells that express
FcγRs, the receptors for IgG. The balance of FcγRs that are engaged by immune complexes
determines the degree of the inflammatory effector cell response. Activating, low-affinity FcγRs
(FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa) transduce inflammatory signaling through immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
activation motifs (ITAMs); in health, ITAM signaling is balanced by immunoreceptor tyrosinebased inhibition motif (ITIM) signaling through the inhibitory FcγR, FcγRIIb2, 3.

The strength of interactions between immune complexes and various FcγRs is determined by
structural diversity within IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4) and post-translational
modifications of their Fc domains4. Importantly, individuals produce distinct structural repertoires
of IgG Fc domains, with some producing highly activating/pro-inflammatory repertoires enriched
for features such as IgG1, IgG3 and/or reduced core-fucosylation of the IgG1 Fc domain. Others
produce IgG repertoires characterized by higher levels of IgG2 and/or sialylated Fcs that have
reduced activating/inflammatory FcγR signaling potential2. It remains unknown whether there are
any specific structural features of antibodies produced by mild or severe COVID-19 patients.

To address this, we performed a multi-dimensional analysis of antibodies from adult patients with
severe (hospitalized) or mild (outpatient) SARS-CoV-2 infections, or from SARS-CoV-2

seropositive children, with a focus on antibody features that are known to augment effector
functions. Overall, we found that severe COVID-19 was distinguished by increased production of
IgG1 antibodies with significantly reduced Fc fucosylation (high afucosylation) and elevated IgG3
in patients who were treated in the ICU, both of these antibody forms being pro-inflammatory in
nature. Within SARS-CoV-2 immune complexes, afucosylated Fc structures triggered activation
of NK cells and production of inflammatory cytokines by primary monocytes including IL-6 and
TNF.

Results

Severe COVID-19 patients display specific antibody signatures
43 hospitalized PCR+ COVID-19 patients, divided into those treated in the ICU (n=21) or on the
floor (n=22), along with 18 PCR+ COVID-19 outpatients were studied (Extended Data Table 1).
In addition, because children are rarely diagnosed with COVID-19, and almost never develop
severe COVID-19 despite being susceptible to productive infections

5, 6, 7, 8

we reasoned that it

would be informative to study SARS-CoV-2 antibodies produced by children. To this end, we
screened approximately 800 remainder sera from pediatric patients in a large Northern Californian
health care system and identified 16 that were positive for antibodies against the receptor binding
domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein; all positive samples from children were
validated in a secondary screen against the full-length spike protein, as previously described 9.

To characterize serologic correlates of disease severity, we first profiled anti-RBD
immunoglobulin isotype titers in sera from COVID-19 patients or from seropositive children.

Among the study subjects, severe COVID-19 patients (ICU and floor) had significantly higher
serum titers of IgM and IgA RBD-binding antibodies compared to both mild COVID patients and
seropositive children. The titers of anti-RBD IgG antibodies were not significantly different
amongst the groups (Fig.1a, 1b).

Next, we defined the determinants of anti-RBD IgG effector function in the COVID-19 patients
and seropositive children. The absolute abundance of IgG subclasses was characterized by mass
spectrometry. We observed that the abundance of various subclasses was similar between groups,
with a small but significant increase in IgG3 produced by COVID-19 patients who were in the
ICU (Fig. 2a). Anti-RBD IgG1, the most abundant IgG subclass, was next characterized for posttranslational modifications of the Fc using well-established mass spectrometric methods

10, 11, 12

.

The relative abundance of N-glycan modifications were characterized, including fucose, bisecting
GlcNAc, galactose and sialic acid. Notably, anti-RBD IgG1 from severe COVID-19 patients was
significantly reduced in core fucosylation when compared with anti-RBD IgG1 from mild COVID19 patients or from seropositive children (Fig. 2b, 2c). We validated the ability of reduced
fucosylation to separate patients with severe COVID-19 from those with mild disease using
receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis (global area under the ROC curve (AUC) 0.74 [95% CI
0.62–0.86], p= 0.0031) (Fig. 2d). Of all post-translational modifications, IgG1 Fc fucosylation was
a uniquely strong marker of severe COVID-19 using ROC analysis (Extended Data Fig. 1). When
we analyzed the six afucosylated Fc glycoforms that were quantified, those without a bisecting Nacetyl glucosamine (F0N0) were specifically increased in severe COVID-19 (Fig. 2e).

Overall, these data showed a unique antibody signature associated with COVID-19 severity based
on multiparametric characterization of SARS-CoV2-specific humoral responses comprising
isotype titers, IgG subclasses and IgG1 Fc-glycan structures. Severe COVID-19 patients were
more likely to produce significantly higher titers of anti-RBD IgM and IgA isotype antibodies,
increased IgG3 subclass (ICU patients) and increased afucosylated (F0N0) Fc glycoforms relative
to patients with mild COVID-19 (Fig. 3). The IgG3 subclass and afucosylated IgG1 modifications
are features that increase Fc interactions with activating/pro-inflammatory FcγRs 2.

Fc afucosylation is stable over time in severe COVID-19
The afucosylated IgG1 Fc was the most prominent feature distinguishing severe and mild COVID19 in our cohorts. To begin to dissect the regulation of this antibody modification we first asked
whether infection itself triggered a significant change in Fc glycoforms. To do this, we performed
a longitudinal analysis of Fc glycoforms on RBD-reactive IgG1 from paired sera drawn at acute
(T1) and later time points. Paired samples were selected from individuals who were positive for
IgG at T1 and late time points were drawn 2, 3- or 4-weeks post T1. No significant changes were
found in the levels of F0N0, bisection or galactosylation over time but the amount of sialylation
was significantly reduced between T1 and week-4 samples (Supplementary Figure 4a). This
suggested that infection triggered an acute increase in Fc sialylation that declined over time as new
IgGs were produced but this was not the case for other glycoforms. In contrast to SARS-CoV-2
infection, it was previously observed that acute dengue virus infections can trigger production of
highly afucosylated IgGs that decline in the weeks following infection12. To further probe whether
anti-RBD Fc glycoforms were associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load, we performed correlation

analyses between anti-RBD Fc glycoforms and SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels from nasopharyngeal
swabs taken during acute infection. We observed no correlation between any Fc glycoforms and
viral RNA load as determined by the cycle threshold (CT) value (Supplementary Figure 4b). In
all, these data did not support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 virus infection regulated F0N0 Fc
glycans during infection.

Fc afucosylation is elevated in males

Studies have previously shown that antibody glycans may be influenced by age and sex 13, 14, 15, 16.
We therefore performed a multivariate regression analysis on samples from hospitalized COVID19 patients from the Stanford Hospital Center (n=30, F=14, M=16) to determine whether age
and/or sex may have played a role in regulating the abundance of Fc glycans. We observed that
sex was significantly correlated with Fc afucosylation (p=0.0007) and age was not a confounding
variable. Males had significantly higher levels of anti-RBD F0N0 Fc glycoforms over females
(Figure 4a). To determine the generalizability of this finding, we studied samples from a second
cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated in Northern California Kaiser Permanente
hospitals (n=81, M=55, F=26). In this larger cohort, males also had significantly elevated antiRBD F0N0 Fc glycoforms over females (p=0.019) (Figure 4b). A similar sex associated difference
in levels of afucosylation was not observed in mild COVID-19 patients (n=27, F=14, M=13)
(Figure 4c). No other Fc glycoforms segregated by sex in any of the cohorts (Extended Figures 4ce). Further, age did not correlate with any of the characterized anti-RBD Fc glycoforms (Extended
Figure 5). Overall, these data showed that males with severe COVID-19 produced higher levels of
afucosylated, anti-RBD IgG1 antibodies over females.

Afucosylated SARS-CoV-2 immune complexes can promote FcγRIIIa interactions and
inflammatory cytokine production

Afucosylation of IgG1 Fc confers 5-10-fold higher affinity for the activating FcγR, FcγRIIIa on a
monomeric basis (and higher affinity in the context of a multivalent complex), relative to
fucosylated IgG1 17. FcγRIIIa is present on monocytes, macrophages and NK cells at baseline and
can enhance cell activation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production and cytotoxic effector cell
activity 18, 19. Thus, distinct levels of fucosylation within SARS-CoV-2 immune complexes would
be expected to modulate their binding to FcγRIIIa and activating ITAM signaling17. To determine
whether serum IgGs from study subjects differed in their capacity to bind FcγRIIIa, we measured
the apparent dissociation constant of purified serum IgGs from severe COVID-19 patients with a
range of fucose levels, to recombinant FcγRIIIa (F158). IgGs from patients with RBD IgG1
afucosylation >20% conferred ~3-fold higher affinity to FcγRIIIa over IgGs with medium
afucosylation and 5-6 fold over IgGs with low IgG1 afucosylation (<10%). Further, RBD IgG1
afucosylation levels correlated with the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of IgGs for FcγRIIIa
(p<0.0001)(Figures 5a, 5b). To further characterize this using homogenous Fc structures, we
expressed the anti-SARS-CoV2 RBD monoclonal antibody (mAb) CR302220,

21

as a fully

fucosylated IgG1 or as a variant with 32.6% afucosylated Fc, as determined by mass spectrometry;
these variants differed in apparent kD for FcγRIIIa by ~7-fold (Figure 5b). Next, we performed an
ELISA to measure binding by IgGs from individual sera to FcγRIIIa. 38 sera were selected that
represented the range of afucosylation over the sample set. Consistent with the binding results

using purified IgGs, we observed that the amount of anti-RBD IgG1 afucosylation correlated with
binding to FcγRIIIa (p<0.0001) (Figure 5c).

To determine whether these binding differences were physiologically relevant to activation of
primary immune cells that express FcγRIIIa, we next performed in vitro stimulation assays. We
first assessed activation of NK cells by immune complexes composed of patient IgGs and RBD.
NK cell degranulation, measured by CD107a-positive staining, correlated with the abundance of
anti-RBD afucosylation in immune complexes (p=0.0279) (Figure 5d). We next measured the
ability of immune complexes with different levels of Fc afucosylation to stimulate cytokine
production by primary monocytes. Immune complexes were formed from pooled IgGs mixed with
SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticles; these complexes were added to primary cells from separate donors.
IgG pools were derived from patients with high (>20%) or low (<10%) anti-RBD IgG1
afucosylation and were matched for SARS-CoV-2 IgG binding titer (Supplementary Figure 6).
Highly afucosylated immune complexes triggered increased production of proinflammatory
cytokines, principally IL-6, TNF and IL-1 compared to immune complexes with low
afucosylation (Figure 5e, Supplementary Figures 7a). To better define the role of Fc fucosylation
alone on the differential activation of monocytes, we performed this assay with immune complexes
made from SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticles along with anti-RBD mAb 3022 variants that differed
only in Fc fucosylation, as described above. This modification had no impact on anti-spike binding
(Supplementary Figure 6). Cytokines including IL-6, TNF and IL-1 were significantly enhanced
after incubation of monocytes with afucosylated mAb 3022 complexes (Figure 5f, Supplementary
Figures 7b).

Overall, differences in core IgG1 afucosylation impacted FcγRIIIa binding and, within SARSCoV-2 immune complexes, enrichment of afucosylated Fc structures could promote production of
cytokines including IL-6, TNF and IL-1 by primary monocytes. Thus, severe COVID-19 patients
were more likely to produce a pro-inflammatory form of IgG antibody (Extended Data Fig. 6).

Discussion

These studies show that specific pro-inflammatory antibody forms, characterized by IgG3 and
IgG1 with F0N0 glycoform modification are elevated in more people with severe COVID-19. This
was in contrast to patients with mild symptoms and seropositive children. We also found that male
sex, in particular, was associated with high Fc afucosylation in severe COVID-19. Because prior
studies in healthy adults have not found a sex-associated variation in IgG1 afucosylation, this
correlation may arise from additional variables that were not identified in this study13, 14, 15.

Low affinity activating FcγR pathways (FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa) are often required for potent
immunity mediated by passively transferred antibodies against viral pathogens22 and, indeed, one
or both of these receptors likely has a role in protective antibody functions against SARS-CoV-2.
The balance of activating to inhibitory FcγR signaling that promotes protective immunity and the
thresholds for activating FcγR signals that may promote inflammatory pathology will be an
important topic for future investigations into immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the data
shown here raise the possibility that immune complex-mediated activation of inflammatory FcγR
pathways and the associated cytokine production is one “hit” that can promote progression to

severe COVID-19. A limitation of the present study is the absence of in vivo experimental data to
define this due to the current lack of a humanized FcγR animal model for COVID-19 that would
enable such mechanistic studies. In vivo models with well characterized FcγR-IgG interactions and
signaling outcomes will be essential for defining the role of antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 immunity
and disease. Interestingly, prior studies have found high levels of afucosylated IgG1 in patients
with severe dengue virus infections and elevated maternal anti-dengue afucosylation predicted risk
for dengue disease in their infants10, 12. Mechanistic studies have shown that afucosylated antidengue immune complexes and the associated enhancement in FcγRIIIa ITAM signaling can
modulate diverse aspects of dengue virus-host interactions10, 12.

These studies show that production of pro-inflammatory IgG antibodies was more common in
severe cases of COVID-19. Future longitudinal studies including analysis of pre- and postinfection samples will be needed to determine whether these Fc structures can be used as a preinfection biomarker for risk of progression to severe COVID-19.

Binding of polyclonal IgGs was determined by biolayer interferometry. The overlay of binding
traces for a donor from each group representing varying degree of anti-RBD core afucosylation;
low (0-10%), medium (10-20%) and high (>20%) is shown. The kinetic constants were obtained

analyte as shown (solid circles). The fits are indicated by solid lines. The assay was performed
twice and shown are representative traces from one experiment. (b) A strong positive correlation
(Pearson correlation coefficient r=0.86) was observed between the apparent dissociation constant
(KD,app) of FcγRIIIa (CD16a) and anti-RBD IgG1 core afucosylation in COVID-19 patients
(n=13) as determined by biolayer interferometry. The binding of anti-RBD monoclonal antibody,
CR3022 with different core afucosylation levels is also shown (red). The mean data and the
standard error of the mean (SEM) have been graphed. (c) Correlation between the level of antiRBD IgG1 Fc afucosylation and binding to FcγRIIIa. Binding of serum antibodies (n=38) to

‘foldon’ from T4 fibritin to promote oligomerization in lieu of the native trans-membrane (TM)
domain; a human rhino virus 3C (HRV 3C) protease cleavage site; a C-terminal His8 tag.
Mammalian codon-optimized gene fragments were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies,
Inc.) and cloned using Gibson Assembly (New England BioLabs) into a CMV/R promoter driven
mammalian expression vector between XbaI and BamHI restriction sites.

Both the constructs were transiently transfected into Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as
per the manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly, Expi293F cells at a density of 3106 viable
cells/ml maintained in Expi293 expression medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were transfected
with expression plasmids complexed with ExpiFectamine 293 transfection reagent. 18 hours posttransfection, the cells were supplemented with a cocktail of transfection enhancers. The cultures
were incubated for four days, following which the culture supernatants were harvested by
centrifugation for protein purification. The supernatants were incubated with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS (Gibco))-equilibrated Ni-nitriloacedic acid (NTA) resin (GE HealthCare) for 2h at
4°C under mild-mixing conditions to facilitate binding. The proteins were subsequently eluted
using 500mM imidazole (in PBS, pH 7.4) under gravity flow. The eluted fractions were pooled,
buffer exchanged into PBS (pH 7.4) and concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal units (EMD
Millipore) to a final concentration of ~1mg/ml. Protein purity was assessed by sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Size exclusion chromatography was
used to determine the oligomeric state of the purified proteins under non-denaturing conditions at
room temperature on a Superdex-200 analytical gel filtration column and data was acquired on
UNICORN 7 software (Cytiva). For molecular weight estimations, the column was calibrated
using broad range molecular weight markers (Cytiva) (Figure S1).

MAb 302221 was a kind gift from I. Wilson (The Scripps Research Institute) and was produced
in Expi293F cells, as described above. For production of afucosylated mAb 3022, 200M of
fucosyl transferase inhibitor 2F-Peracetyl-Fucose (Sigma Aldrich) was added to the culture after
transfection. Supernatants were harvested 5 days after transfection and antibody purifications
were done over Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare). Antibodies were bufferexchanged into PBS pH 7.4 and concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal units (EMD
Millipore).

ELISAs
Screening ELISA
A rapid, high-throughput screening ELISA was performed on a total of 789 pediatric samples to
test seropositivity following a modified version of a protocol described previously. Briefly, round
bottom 96 well plates (Immunolon 2HB (Thermo Scientific)) plates were coated with 50l of RBD
at 2g/ml in PBS for 1h at room temperature (RT). Next, the plates were blocked for an hour with
3% non-fat milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST). All serum samples from COVID-19
patients, the pediatric cohort and the negative controls were heated at 56C for 1h, aliquoted and
stored at -80C. For the first round of screening, all samples were diluted 1:50 in 1% non-fat milk
in PBST. 50l of the diluted sera was added to each well and incubated for 2h at RT. Following
primary incubation with the sera, 50l of 1:5000 diluted horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated
goat anti-Human Ig Fab (Southern Biotech) was added and incubated for 1h at RT. The plates were
developed by adding 50ul/well of the chromogenic substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)
solution (Millipore Sigma). The reaction was stopped with 0.2N sulphuric acid (Sigma) and

absorbance was measured at 450nm (SPECTRAmax 250, Molecular Devices). The plates were
washed 5 times with PBST between each step and an additional wash with PBS was done before
developing the plates. Samples were considered seropositive against RBD if their absorbance value
was greater than the mean plus four standard deviation (SD) of all negative controls (n=130).

Validation ELISA of seropositive pediatric samples
The serum samples from the pediatric cohort, which showed seropositivity against RBD were
validated by a second round of screening against the full-length SARS-Cov-2 spike protein (S).
As described above, plates were coated with 50ul of 2ug/ml S protein in PBS. Following blocking
and wash, the plates were incubated with a 5-fold dilution series of RBD positive sera (50l)
starting at 1:50 for 2h at room temperature. All the subsequent steps were followed as described
above. Sera from children and COVID-19 patients were considered positive if they reached a
threshold of the average value of 130 historical negative controls plus six standard deviations. The
specificity of the assay was also tested on control sera from 12 subjects with documented seasonal
coronavirus infections collected in early 2019.

Isotyping by ELISA
Sera were diluted 5-fold starting at 1:50 and ELISAs were performed as described above. The
various secondary antibodies used for isotyping were 1:5000 dilutions of HRP-conjugated Goat
Anti-Human IgG Fc (Southern Biotech), Mouse Anti-Human IgM (Southern Biotech) and Goat
Anti-Human IgA Fc (Southern Biotech).

Human recombinant CD16a (Sino Biological) was immobilized at 3ug/ml (50ul/well) in PBS at
4C overnight, followed by an hour of blocking with 3% non-fat milk in PBST. 50ul of 1:50 diluted
sera from pediatric seropositive (n=11), PCR+ and seropositive (n=22) and healthy controls (n=5)
were added to each well and incubated for 2h at 37C. Subsequently the plates were incubated for
1h at 37C with 1:5000 dilution of HRP-conjugated Goat Anti-Human IgG Fc (Southern Biotech)
secondary antibody, developed as described previously with TMB and absorbance was recorded
at 450nm.

Clinical cohorts and samples
Remnant sera from pediatric subjects and from PCR+ COVID-19 patients were obtained from
Kaiser Permanente Northern California. The sera were collected for a variety of clinical tests at
one of 75 distinct hospitals or outpatient clinics across 17 counties in Northern California between
March 30th, 2020 to April 19th, 2020. Additional serum samples from PCR+ COVID-19 patients
were from the Stanford ICU Biobank (protocol #28205) or from (protocol #NCT04331899)

25.

Characterization of these samples was performed under a protocol approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Stanford University (protocol #55718).

Samples from people with seasonal coronavirus infections were collected at the University of
Chicago. Samples were de-identified serums of healthcare workers that had respiratory illnesses,
were swabbed, and tested positive for common cold Corona virus infections in 2019 (U. Chicago
protocol # 09-043-A).

Historical controls and healthy controls: 30 samples from a US cohort was enrolled at the
Rockefeller University Hospital in New York City in 2012 in accordance with a protocol approved
by the Institutional Review Board of Rockefeller University (protocol #TWA-0804), in
compliance with guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical
Practice guidelines, and was registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01967238).

Blood

samples were drawn from healthy adult volunteers between the ages of 18-64. 50 samples were
obtained from a Ugandan cohort of women and children enrolled in PROMOTE (NCT 02163447),
a randomized clinical trial of novel antimalarial chemoprevention regimens in Eastern Uganda 26.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Makerere University School of
Biomedical Sciences, the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology, and the
University of California San Francisco. Written informed consent was obtained from all study
participants. 50 samples were obtained from children under 18 years of age enrolled in a study of
acute febrile illness in Nepal. The study was approved by the Nepal Health Research Council,
Kathmandu University Institutional Review Board, and Stanford University Institutional Review
Board (protocol #29992).

IgG Fc glycan and IgG subclass analysis
Methods for relative quantification of Fc Glycans and IgG subclasses have been previously
described11, 12. Briefly, IgGs were isolated from serum by protein G purification. Antigen-specific
IgGs were isolated on NHS agarose resin (ThermoFisher; 26196) coupled to the protein of interest.
Following tryptic digestion of purified IgG bound to antigen-coated beads, nanoLC-MS/MS
analysis for characterization of glycosylation sites was performed on an UltiMate3000 nanoLC
(Dionex) coupled with a hybrid triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer, the 4000 Q

Trap (SCIEX). MS data acquisition was performed using Analyst 1.6.1 software (SCIEX) for
precursor ion scan triggered information dependent acquisition (IDA) analysis for initial
discovery-based identification.

For quantitative analysis of the glycoforms at the N297 site of IgG1, multiple-reaction monitoring
(MRM) analysis for selected target glycopeptide was applied using the nanoLC-4000 Q Trap
platform to the samples which had been digested with trypsin. The m/z of 4-charged ions for all
different glycoforms as Q1 and the fragment ion at m/z 366.1 as Q3 for each of transition pairs
were used for MRM assays. A native IgGs tryptic peptide (131-GTLVTVSSASTK-142) with
transition pair of, 575.9+2/780.4 was used as a reference peptide for normalization. IgG subclass
distribution was quantitatively determined by nanoLC-MRM analysis of tryptic peptides following
removal of glycans from purified IgGs with PNGase F. Here the m/z value of fragment ions for
monitoring transition pairs was always larger than that of their precursor ions to enhance the
selectivity for unmodified targeted peptides and the reference peptide. All raw MRM data was
processed using MultiQuant 2.1.1 (SCIEX). All MRM peak areas were automatically integrated
and inspected manually. In the case where the automatic peak integration by MultiQuant failed,
manual integration was performed using the MultiQuant software.

Binding affinity measurements using biolayer interferometry (BLI)
Total IgGs were purified from sera of 13 COVID-19 patients Protein G beads. The binding
affinities of patient IgGs and high and low afucosylated 3022 mAbs were determined by biolayer
interferometry (BLI) using an OctetQK instrument (Pall ForteBio). Human recombinant CD16a
(Sino Biological) was captured onto the amine reactive second-generation (AR2G) biosensors

using the amine reactive second-generation reagent kit (Pall ForteBio). The CD16a bound sensors
were dipped into a concentration series (3.33M, 1.7M, 0.832M and 0.33M) of IgGs in PBST
to determine the binding kinetics. An equal number of unliganded biosensors dipped into the
analytes served as controls for referencing. The traces were processed using ForteBio Data
Analysis Software version 8.0.3.5 and corrected for non-specific binding. The data was fitted
globally to a simple 1:1 Langmuir interaction model.

NK cell degranulation assay
PBMCs were isolated from whole blood collected from healthy blood donors post-plateletpheresis
(Stanford Blood Center) using SepMate Isolation Tubes (STEMCELL). Cells were plated in a 96well round-bottom plate (CELLSTAR) at a density of 3106 cells/mL of complete RPMI-1640
media supplemented with 1X penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine, 1mM sodium pyruvate, and 1X
MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco), and 1ng/mL
IL-15 (STEMCELL) and rested overnight at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 incubator (Panasonic). The
following morning, cell culture media was replaced with complete RPMI containing anti-CD107a
antibody (BioLegend; clone H4A3). PBMCs were promptly stimulated for 6hr at 37°C with
immune complexes formed by incubating purified patient IgG with SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding
domain protein at a molar ratio of 30:1 for 1hr at room temperature. 1hr into stimulation, culture
media was supplemented with 1X Brefeldin A (BioLegend) for the remaining 5hr of culture. Cells
were then isolated, stained for cell viability using Live/Dead Fixable Staining Kit (Thermo Fisher)
(1:60 dilution) as well as CD3 (clone OKT3), CD11c (clone S-HCL-3), CD14 (clone 63D3), CD16
(clone 3G8), CD56 (clone HCD56), and HLA-DR (clone L243) surface markers (BioLegend) (all
at 1:30 diluton). After staining, cells were fixed and acquired using an Attune NxT flow cytometer

(Invitrogen). NK cells were defined as viable CD3-CD14-CD16+CD56+HLA-DR- cells
(Supplementary Figure 1). NK cell degranulation was measured and reported as the fold change
of NK cells positive for CD107a over control.

Monocyte stimulation and cytokine measurements
Monocytes were isolated from healthy donor blood (Stanford Blood Center) using RosetteSep
Human Monocyte Enrichment Kit (STEMCELL) per manufacturer instructions. Monocytes were
cultured at a density of 2×106 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 1X non-essential
amino acids, sodium pyruvate, penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (Gibco), and 10% fetal bovine
serum (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Immune complexes were formed by incubating a dilution
series of COVID-19 patient IgGs or anti-spike 3022 mAbs to SARS-CoV-2 spike-expressing
delta-G-VSV pseudovirus for 1 hour at room temperature. Monocytes were incubated with the
various immune complexes or the pseudovirus only for 18 hours at 37 oC in a 5% CO2 incubator.
After 18 hours, cell-free supernatants were collected and proinflammatory cytokine concentrations
were measured using a LEGENDplex bead array (BioLegend) per manufacturer instructions.

Statistical analysis
R statistical package version 1.2.1335 was used to generate the radar plots and perform
multivariate linear regression analysis. All other data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 8.0
software. Investigators were blinded to study subjects diagnoses during screening; COVID-19
patients and children were not known by investigators at the time of ELISA screening for RBD
reactivity of serum or by investigators involved in relative quantitation of Fc glycoforms and IgG
subclasses by mass spectrometry.
