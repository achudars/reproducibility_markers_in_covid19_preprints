Abstract
An effect of weather on sars-cov-2 transmission is regularly proposed as a putative cause of
unexplained fluctuations of covid-19 new cases, but clear data supporting this hypothesis
remains to be presented. Here I measured longitudinal time-series correlations between
outdoor temperature, humidity and covid-19 reproduction number (Rt) in the 50 U.S. states
(+DC). In order to mitigate the confounding influence of varying social restriction measures,
the analysis spans a 5-month period during summer and autumn 2020 when restrictions were
comparatively lower and more stable. I used a cross-covariance approach to account for a
variable delay between infection and case report. For a delay near 11 days, most U.S. states
exhibited a negative correlation between outdoor temperature and Rt, as well as between
absolute humidity and Rt (mean r = -0.35). In 21 states, the correlation was strong (r < -0.5).
Individual state data are presented, and associations between cold and/or dry weather
episodes and short-term new case surges are proposed. After identifying potential confounding
factors, I discuss 3 possible causal mechanisms that could explain a correlation between
outdoor weather and indoor disease transmission: behavioral adaptations to cold weather,
respiratory tract temperature, and the importing of outdoor absolute humidity to indoor spaces.

Introduction
A full year after the start of the covid-19 epidemic, the fluctuations of contamination numbers
through time remain only partially understood and often unpredictable, putting populations and
health systems at risk, and challenging social restrictions policies [1].
An influence of weather on covid-19 transmission was repeatedly assessed early in the
pandemic (review in [2]), but wider acceptance of such a “weather effect” could still benefit
today from stronger evidence. Here l investigated correlations between outdoor temperature,
humidity and covid-19 spread, using longitudinal data for the 50 U.S. states (+Columbia
district), during summer and autumn 2020.
The present work is mainly exploratory and descriptive, with the objective to stimulate further
investigations by expert scientists (e.g. epidemiologists, virologists, atmospheric science and
air quality specialists).

Methods
Covid-19 data. I used daily new covid-19 cases counts (new cases, NC) collected for the 50
states (+ DC) by the Covid Tracking Project [3] (i.e. positiveIncrease variable in original
dataset).
Raw new case counts were 7-day averaged in order to smooth day-of-week fluctuations (e.g.
lower case counts on weekends). Delay-free symmetric averaging (from day-3 to day+3) was
applied:

𝑁𝐶# 𝑑 =
7

𝑁𝐶(𝑑)
+.-

Delay from infection to case report. New cases reported on a given date have been infected
several days before. This delay can be estimated considering the following elements:
o the delay from exposure to symptom onset is typically 5 days, but can vary from 2 to
11 days [4].
o the optimal time for RT-PCR testing (lowest false-negative) is 3 days after symptom
onset [5]
o in U.S., average reported delay between testing and result was 3-4 days (JuneSeptember 2020 data [6]).
o on the other hand, antigen tests should be conducted within 7 days of symptom onset,
and can provide same-day results [7].
o the new case data in the Covid Tracking Project dataset is not reported by date of
testing, but rather by date of publication by the state administration, and states have
variable reporting delays (see faq in [3]).

Hence the delay from infection to case report (ICR) might be as short as ~5 days for a test with
same-day result performed early after infection (e.g. systematic testing of asymptomatic people
such as university students). On the opposite, the delay can potentially attain 3 weeks for
symptomatic cases tested one week or so after symptom onset, in a state with testing and/or
reporting delays. In between these extreme values, I estimated the ICR delay in the Covid
Tracking Project dataset was most probably within 12 ± 5 days, depending on each state’s
testing and reporting swiftness. Conversely, new cases reported on a given date were assumed
to reflect contaminations about 12-day old.

Disease spread. If one is interested in quantifying disease spread (under the putative
immediate influence of an environmental factor), a relevant estimator of transmission is not
new case count per se (NC, which depends on the state’s accumulated transmission history),
but rather the effective reproduction number Rt. Rt is the average number of new infections
caused by a single infected individual. Several precise Rt computation methods exist, based
on refined models (see [8] and [9]). Here I simply estimated Rt as the ratio of new infections to
the concurrent infectious cases that got infected on the previous generation. Covid-19
generation time being close to one week [9], I used:

𝑅𝑡(𝑑) ≈

𝑁𝐶# (𝑑)
𝑁𝐶# (𝑑 − 7)

Note that, as Rt is based on reported cases and not current infection numbers, its value, as
was the case for NC, reflects transmission with a ~12 days delay. Rather than time-shifting Rt
values to (day-12) upon calculation (as is done elsewhere, e.g. [10]), I voluntarily left Rt
estimates in the same time frame as the new cases data, for easier graphical presentation of
results.

Weather data. I used daily average temperature (T, outdoor) and relative humidity (RH,
outdoor), as reported for each US county in the covid-19-open-data dataset [11] (variable
names in original dataset : average_temperature and relative_humidity).
According to the dataset information, this weather data was compiled from multiple NOAA
stations for each county : “The reported data corresponds to the average of the nearest 10
stations within a 300km radius” [11]. Additionally, the dataset contains single daily T and RH
values for each state, which are the values I used in the present work. To my knowledge, it is
unfortunately not indicated how these aggregated values by state were derived from county
values.
As RH levels are not directly comparable when temperature varies, two other daily variables
were computed from RH and T:

- Absolute humidity (AH, outdoor) is the quantity of water contained per air volume, in g/m3. As
cold air cannot contain as much water vapor as hot air, AH depends on T and RH and was
computed as follows:

𝐴𝐻 = 2.16679

𝑅𝐻 𝑃𝑤𝑠
𝑇 + 273

𝑃𝑤𝑠 = 611.6441 × 10

#.BCD-EF G
G,HIJ.#HF-

with:
AH: absolute humidity (g/m3)
RH: relative humidity (0 to 1)
T: temperature (°C)
Pws: water vapor saturation pressure (Pa)
Note that here, daily mean AH is directly computed from daily mean T and RH, which is not
100% correct, as hourly T and RH (not available) should first be converted to hourly AH before
averaging.
I included outdoor AH in the analysis because it was already identified as a factor (along T) of
more frequent respiratory diseases [12], and it can be a proxy to indoor RH (see discussion).
- Wet-bulb temperature (WBT, outdoor) is the temperature experienced by wet objects: if the
surrounding air is not saturated with water vapor (RH < 100%), evaporation of water from a
wet object cools down the object below ambient air temperature. Hence WBT is lower than T,
and the drier the air is (low RH), the lower is WBT. Here, WBT is used as a candidate proxy to
the temperature of the upper respiratory tract for people breathing outdoor, as cold and dry air
cools down mucosa [13] and potentially affects biological processes therein [14,15]. Daily WBT
was estimated from daily T and RH using the empirical formula in [16].
T, WBT and AH were then 7-day averaged using the same method as for covid-19 cases.

Study period. Strong social restrictions, such as applied during lockdowns (e.g. business
closure, stay-at-home orders) are known to have spectacular effects on disease transmission.
These human-policy effects are hypothesized to add-up with (or possibly overcome) any
putative weather effect. Hence, for the present work, I excluded periods when the strength of
restriction policies are known to have varied significantly. Most US states lifted “first-wave”
lockdowns between late April and late May 2020, with a few states lifting later in early June
[10]. More recently, “3rd wave” surges forced states to progressively put back strong
restrictions, during November or December 2020 depending on states (as reported in the press
e.g. [17] and [18]). The interval period chosen here, from June 15th 2020 to November 15th
2020, is supposed to have seen relatively lower and more stable restrictions levels in most
U.S. states.

Statistical approach. For each state, I computed the Pearson product-moment correlation
coefficient (noted r) between each weather variable (T, WBT, AH) and covid-19 Rt, across the
whole 5-month study period (i.e. n = 154 days). Before computing r, state Rt data was shifted
by a delay from 1 to 30 days, in order to observe the effect of assumed ICR delay. This
approach is similar to normalized cross-covariance (e.g. xcov() Matlab function), but here the
delayed variable (Rt) is never clipped at the end of the time series, i.e. n = 154 data value pairs
is always verified. Note that this implies that for long delays, covid-19 case counts from late
November and early December were included.
The resulting 5-month r values indicate whether disease transmission followed weather
variation over the study period as a whole. r can vary form -1 to 1, and the closer r is to -1 or
1, the stronger the correlation (negative or positive correlation, respectively). Correlation
strength was evaluated based on Cohen’s guidelines on effect sizes [19]:
o strong correlation:
o moderate correlation:
o weak correlation:

0.5 £ | r |
0.2 £ | r | < 0.5
| r | < 0.2

Note that with n = 154, any | r | ³ 0.15 is in theory significant to the p < 0.05 level. However,
data are smoothed time series containing some auto-correlation that should be removed before
assessing correlation significance. For the present exploratory work, I did not go further into
significance testing at this point. Effect size as estimated through r value convey more
information than significance thresholding for describing the results below.
In order to evaluate short-term correlation between weather variable and Rt, I also computed r
in 31-days sliding windows, with again a variable delay applied on Rt series. These 1-month r
values help precise at which time-scale, and on which sub-period, the correlation between
weather and Rt is observed.
I used Matlab® for all analyses and graphics.

Results

Figure 1 - Correlation results for all U.S. states.
Figure 1 presents synthetic correlation results. Thin lines represent individual states. Thick
lines show mean of 51 states. Note that as most detected correlations are negative (i.e. r < 0),
vertical axes have been flipped upside-down for easier visualization of later results. 5-month
correlations show that Rt was most often negatively correlated with weather variables (T,
WBT, AH) over the full study period. Strongest mean correlation were measured for an ICR of
11, 10 and 11 days respectively (r = -0.35, -0.36, -0.35). | r | near 0.3 suggest moderate
correlations strength by common standards [19], but some states had stronger or weaker
correlations (strongest correlation -0.77, -0.77 and -0.75 for T, WBT and AH respectively).

1-month sliding window correlation provides a time-series of r values for each state, that
was averaged in the present figure (mean for 124 windows of 31 days). Thus each thin line is
the mean r for a given state, as a function of ICR, and thick line is the mean of means. These
short-term correlations show a similar peak in correlation strength, for an ICR delay of 11 days
(mean r: -0.23, -0.27 and -0.25 for T, WBT and AH, respectively). For very short or very long
delays, 1-month correlations tend to disappear (r » 0), which was not the case for 5-month r.

21 states with strongly negative weather-Rt correlations (r £ -0.5 )
In the following state-specific figures, the state’s time-series for new cases, Rt, T, WBT and AH
are plotted on the left. Results of correlations (5-month and mean 1-month) are plotted on the
right, as a function of ICR delay. The ICR value within 12±5 days that yielded the most negative
r value (5-month or 1-month, T or WBT or AH) was chosen to shift displayed new cases and
Rt time-series horizontally. On the bottom left, the state’s 1-month r time-series for the
displayed ICR is shown. Note that, as previously, vertical axes are flipped upside-down for
weather variables and r plots, for easier comparison between Rt and weather data. States are
presented in decreasing correlation strength order. States with weak or no correlation will be
described in another section.

New York state (NY)
I first describe correlation values (right panel). In NY state, the strongest 5-month correlations
with Rt were found for an ICR of 12 days, with r values of -0.77 for T and WBT and -0.74 for
AH. 1-month correlations showed a marked peak for similar delays (r = -0.47, -0.50 and -0.50
at 13, 13 and 12 days, for T, WBT and AH, respectively). Looking at time series (left panels)
through the study period as a whole, Rt showed an overall increasing trend, while T, WBT and
AH decreased over the period (n. b. series are flipped vertically). These general trends explain
the negative 5-month r, regardless of the assumed ICR delay. More interesting is the smallerscale parallelism between Rt and weather data. Such “phase correlation” causes the marked
peak in mean 1-month r around 12 days delay, as well as the additional “boost” in 5-month r
value.

In concrete terms, NY state experienced two main covid-19 surges during the study period. A
first significant surge (a) happened around Oct 1, with new daily cases increasing from ~800
on Sep 20 to ~1400 on Oct 10. This translates into a peak in the Rt curve, culminating at Rt =
1.6 on Oct 1. This surge can be related to a cold weather episode around Sep 19, when outdoor
temperature temporarily fell from 18°C to 11°C (AH simultaneously fell from 12 to 6 g/m3). The
second surge (b) happened around Nov 10 (Rt = 1.8, daily new cases increasing from ~2500
to ~5000). There was again a corresponding cold episode, around Oct 31 (i.e. 10 days before),
with temperature falling from 13°C to 3°C (and AH from 9 to 4 g/m3). The parallelism is not
perfect, and smaller anomalies do not always coincide between Rt and weather data (Rt
inevitably contains some amount of noise, see discussion). The lowest left panel shows the
evolution of 1-month r (for ICR = 12 d.), for Rt vs. T, WBT and AH.
In NY the variation of WBT and AH was very similar to T, yielding very similar r values (both
long- and short term), regardless of the chosen weather variable. Thus from NY state data, it
is unclear whether temperature or humidity should be considered a more likely driver of
infections.

Washington state (WA)
Strongest 5-month correlation (r = -0.76) was found for T vs Rt, assuming a 9-day ICR (on the
lower side of the assumed 12±5 days realistic range for ICR). T had an overall U-shaped
evolution (on inverted axes) that was also found in Rt (except for Nov). Results are less clear
for WA than for NY, as short-term correlation for WBT and AH were stronger for a 13-14 days
ICR. Linking weather and Rt episodes is also less easy, but I still note that a steep decrease
in T and AH from Oct 5 to Oct 25 (from 17 to 3°C and 9 to 4 g/m3, (a) to (b) on figure) was
followed by an Rt increase from 1.0 on Oct 16 to 1.6 on Nov 6, i.e. with a 11-12 days delay.
This corresponds to the main case surge observed in WA during the study period, with daily
cases increasing form ~650 mid-Oct to ~2500 mid-Nov.

New Mexico (NM)
Rt was best correlated with AH, for an ICR of 7 days (at the lower limit of realistic range for
ICR). As a visual translation, both AH and Rt exhibited an overall V- or W-shaped evolution
over the 5-month period, with a marked AH peak (a) on Jul 25 (12 g/m3) that corresponds to a
minimal Rt of 0.6 on Aug 2 (i.e. 8 days later). Interestingly, during summer, AH or WBT appear
as more consistent predictors of Rt than T (see lower left panel). Contrary to NY or WA, finding
graphic correspondence between sharp weather episode and Rt peaks (as a visual support for
correlation results) was not so easy during the autumn.

Ohio (OH)
Long- and short-term correlations congruently suggested ICR = 11 days, for all 3 weather
variables (strongest r: -0.75 for AH). r values have another peak when correlating with ~26-day
offset, which goes beyond realistic ICR delays. This “rebound” is presumably caused by
periodic phase correlation (both Rt and weather tended to oscillate in OH). The main covid-19
event in OH was a prolonged exponential increase in new cases starting around Sep 26, with
Rt remaining within 1.2-1.5 for the following 6 weeks. In the meantime, daily new cases
increased exponentially from ~1000 to ~7500. This durable increased covid-19 transmission
level from late Sep (a) was preceded by an equivalent decrease in T (dropping and remaining
below 18°C) and AH (below 12 g/m3) on Sep15, i.e. 11 days earlier.

California (CA)
Rt was most strongly correlated with AH (r = -0.73, for ICR = 12 days). 5-month results for T
and WBT, as well as 1-month results, were less clear. As noteworthy episodes in CA that can
illustrate correlation results, there was a short surge (a) around Aug 13 (Rt = 1.5) that could
correspond to a local dry episode around Aug 1, and (b) the sustained surge starting around
Nov 5 (Rt remaining above 1.3 for 3 weeks) coincided with AH dropping below 7 g/m3 (and T
below 17°C) near Oct 24, i. e. 12 days earlier.

Nevada (NV)
5-month r indicated strongest correlations for ICR = 13 days, with similar values for T, WBT
and AH (r = -0.68, -0.67 and -0.64, respectively). 1-month r were less congruent. 3 short covid19 surge episodes with Rt ~ 1.5 happened on Jul 16, Sep 26 and Nov 7 (a, b, c). Each one
was preceded by an episode where AH attained very low values: 2.8 g/m3 on Jul 7, 2.4 g/m3
on Sep12 and 1.6 g/m3 on Oct 29, respectively. Note that these events would correspond within
realistic, but different ICR delays (9, 14 and 9 days respectively). Also note that there were 2
other dry episodes during the study period (on Aug 2 and Oct 5) that were not followed by
comparable Rt peaks.

Arizona (AZ)
Strongest 5-month correlation was observed between Rt and WBT (r = -0.68 for ICR = 7 days,
a barely realistic short delay). Short-time correlations were not congruent, suggesting even
shorter ICR delays for T and WBT. There was a very short-lived and high Rt = 2.1 peak on Sep
16 that could correspond to a cold peak (WBT = 12°C on Sep 12), but the 4-days implied ICR
delay, although not impossible, is considered unrealistic. More convincingly, the highest AH
over the whole period in AZ (11 g/m3) was reached on Jul 25 (a), followed 12 days later by the
lowest Rt (0.5 on Aug 6). I found no other sharp graphic association between weather and case
count data in AZ.

Florida (FL)
Long- and short-time correlation data were congruent in FL, suggesting a rather long ICR delay
of 14-15 days. Stronger 5-mth correlation was observed for AH vs. Rt (r = -0.67). There
unfortunately are a few “spikes” in FL new case counts that make Rt series noisier than
average. Still, I note the following events: after the summer decrease, case started to increase
again from the first week of October (a), with Rt remaining close to 1.2 for the following 7 weeks.
This could correspond to AH dropping durably below 20 g/m3 around Sep 19 (i.e. about 15
days earlier). Also, a further transient drop (b) of AH down to 14 g/m3 (and T down to 22°C)
around Nov 2 was followed by a peak of Rt up to 1.5 on Nov 18, i.e. 16 days later.

Pennsylvania (PA)
T, WBT and AH had equal 5-month r = -0.65 for ICR delay = 11-12 days, and the peaks in 1month r were congruent. As for previous states, to illustrate graphical translation of correlation
results, the association between 3 cold-dry events (a, b, c) and Rt peaks is proposed on figure.
The last of these Rt peaks is the strong case surge of November in PA, with cases increasing
from ~2200 to ~7000 (Rt = 1.7 on Nov 10).

Oregon (OR)
WBT and T had the strongest 5-month correlation with Rt (r = -0.65), for ICR = 12 days again.
AH had a slightly weaker correlation overall (r = -0.58). 1-month correlations results were less
clear, with r-value oscillations. I proposed 3 weather-Rt associations on figure (a, b, c), the last
one corresponding to a large case surge in November. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that
OR saw significant weather variations during August, that do not seem to correspond to any
strong Rt variations.

Colorado (CO)
Rt vs. T or WBT correlations suggested an ICR of 6 days (r = -0.6), which is considered
unrealistically short. AH correlation rather suggest ICR = 10 days (r = -0.57). Among noteworthy
episodes, there was (a) a surge around mid-September (Rt = 1.8 on Sep16), with cases surging
from ~250 to ~600. This could correspond to a cold anomaly around Sep 11, but again 5 days
is a very short delay. More convincingly, the Oct-Nov prolonged surge from ~600 to ~5000
daily cases, with Rt settling near 1.4-1.5 for 6 weeks, could correspond to AH falling below 3
g/m3 from Sep 28 (b).

North Carolina (NC)
Rt vs. AH returned the strongest 5-month correlation (r = -0.56 for ICR = 13 days), while mean
1-month correlation was strongest for T (r = -0.56 for ICR = 11 days).
3 peak correspondences are proposed on figure (a, b, c).
(Note: an isolated spike of 6142 new cases on Sep 25, probably from backlog reporting, was
removed from NC analysis because it caused a strong Rt peak which disrupted correlation
results).

Massachusetts (MA)
T was the weather variable most strongly correlated with Rt (r = -0.56 for ICR = 10 days). Mean
1-month r rather suggest ICR = 11-12 days, and 1-month r were weak to null during the summer
(see lower-left panel). 2 peak associations are proposed on figure (a, b).
(Note: a negative spike of -7757 new cases on Sep 25, most probably caused by state data
correction, was removed from MA analysis).

New Jersey (NJ)
in NJ, peak short-term (1-month) correlations were stronger than peak long-term (5-month)
correlations, indicating that cold and/or dry episodes tended to correspond to Rt peaks, but that
the weather change over the study period (U-shaped) did not match Rt trend so well.
Correlation was strongest for AH vs. Rt (mean 1-month r = -0.56, ICR = 10 days). 3 peak
associations are proposed on figure (a, b, c).

Georgia (GA)
AH had the strongest correlation with Rt (r = -0.55), with a long ICR of 17 days. Even stronger
r could be attained for time-shifts > 25 days, but these are considered unrealistic infection-tocase-report delays. In GA, most of the summer saw a decrease in Rt after a large surge started
in June. AH and WBT increased in parallel. The dynamics changed around Oct 2, with Rt reincreasing to 1 and remaining stable for 5 weeks (a). This could correspond to T and AH
stepping down from Sep 17 (below 22°C and 16 g/m3, respectively). Dynamics changed again
with a new surge (b) culminating on Nov 16 (Rt = 1.4), which coincides with a cold-dry episode
around Nov 2 (i.e. 14 days earlier).

Kansas (KS)
As is the case for NJ, 1-month r attain more negative values than 5-month r (strongest

New Hampshire (NH)
New case counts are very low in NH, resulting in noisier Rt than in other states. However,
correlations congruently indicated an ICR delay of 11 days (r = -0.54 for T, with very similar
values for WBT and AH). 2 main peak correspondences are proposed (a, b).

Wyoming (WY)
Correlations for the 3 weather variables were not congruent in WY. T and WBT did not exhibit
any peak for 5-month correlation, and 1-month correlations suggested different ICR depending
on the considered variable. A stronger correlation was observed for AH (5-mth r = -0.52 for
ICR = 7 days). When plotting data, parallelism can be observed between AH and Rt during the
summer (a, b, c), but less so after Sep 15. Later, a peak in Rt around Nov 9 could be linked to
a cold episode around Oct 25, but with a longer assumed ICR delay of 15 days (d).

Vermont (VT)
Cases counts were even lower in VT than in NH, resulting in Rt with larger volatility (hence the
enlarged Rt scale for this state). However, there was good congruence between short and
long-term correlations when assuming an ICR of 12-13 days. 2 main peak associations are
proposed (a, b). These are essentially the same cold-dry events as in neighbor states of NY
and NH.

Louisiana (LA)
5-month r between Rt and T attained -0.5 for ICR = 15 days, indicating good match between
overall (U-) shape variation of both variables. The decrease of Rt after the June-July surge was
paralleled by T increasing until mid-July (but not after that, whereas Rt decreased further until
mid-August). More recently, there was a rapid case surge in LA, culminating at estimated Rt =
3.4 on Nov 15 (daily cases increased from ~800 to ~2200 “only” because the Rt peak was
short-lived), that can be related to a cold event on Nov 1. However, an older cold episode
around Oct 2 did not seem to affect Rt values (Rt scale enlarged for this state).

Utah (UT)
In UT, 5-month r attained -0.5 for correlation of T vs. Rt, assuming an ICR of 7 days. Shortterm correlation rather suggested an ICR close to 10 days. 2 main surges happened in UT: the
first (a) around Sep 16 (Rt = 1.9), that could be related to a cold event on Sep 11 (but with a
short assumed ICR of only 6 days). The second surge (b) happened around Nov 7 (Rt = 1.5),
possibly corresponding to another cold episode around Oct 26 (more realistic ICR = 12 days).
There were important AH variation during the summer in UT that could not easily be related to
corresponding Rt variations.

23 states with moderately negative weather-Rt correlations (-0.5 < r £ -0.2 )
The weather-Rt correlations in these states was less strong than for previous states, but remain
mainly congruent with previous results. When associations between weather episodes and Rt
peaks were useful to illustrate correlation results, they were labeled in the following figures by
letters (a-e). Note that letter alignment are for realistic ICR (12±5 d.), but as previously, were
not constrained to respect the single ICR value chosen on the right panel, as effective ICR
might vary through time for a given state.
(Supplementary note for TX: two strong spikes of 17820 and 71734 new cases, on Sep 22 and
Nov 1, probably caused by backlog reporting, were removed from TX analysis because they
caused strong Rt peaks which disrupted correlation results).

Maine (ME)
in ME, 5-month correlation between weather and Rt was negative and moderate (r ~ -0.4),
reflecting a general trend towards higher Rt and colder, drier weather through the study period.
However, 5-month r plots showed no clear peak around 12-day ICR. Moreover, mean 1-month
r could be negative or positive (by similar amplitudes) depending on the assumed ICR. When
looking at Rt and weather data, there are a few matching episodes, especially for low Rt values
(a, b), but also strong discrepancies (X). Namely, large Rt peaks around Aug 15 and Oct 27
could not be related to any cold-dry episode within realistic IRC delay. Note that when new
case counts are very low (e.g. <100, as is the case for ME before November), case data is
potentially more sensible to new large covid-19 clusters, making Rt variations less deterministic
and more stochastic.

peak matches (a-d) could be observed until mid-September. However, a clear weather change
towards colder and drier air around Sep 16 (X) could not clearly be related to any strong Rt
change in KY, and the 1-month r drops to ~zero in the autumn (lower left panel).

North Dakota (ND)
Surprisingly, correlation between weather and Rt over the full study period was positive in ND
(r ~ 0.15 to 0.4 for realistic ICR delays). Indeed, while T and AH decreased from June to
November (inverted axes), Rt also showed an overall tendency to decrease, contrary to most
other states (note that as long as Rt remains > 1, case counts still increase through time). On
the other hand, mean 1-month r show a more typical negative peak, especially for AH (r = 0.31 for ICR = 11 days), and one can associate Rt peaks with weather episodes (a-e). In other
words, Rt did increase after short-term cold-dry anomalies, but in ND this effect apparently
came “on top” of an overall Rt decreasing tendency. Some elements might explain the Rt
overall decrease: (1) very low case count (<100) early in the period might favor high Rt if large

Correlation results in SD were very similar to ND, i.e. overall positive correlation between Rt
and weather variables, but negative short-term correlation (r = -0.26 for AH vs. Rt, for ICR =

there were also notable discrepancies in SD: a late-August surge (Rt = 2) was not preceded
by any strong weather change, and a very cold episode in late October (smoothed daily T = 5°C) was not followed by a strong Rt increase within realistic ICR delay.

lacking. As a result, 5-month r remained close to zero (-0.2 < r < 0), as did mean 1-month r (0.1 < r < 0.1). WI data as a whole did not support the moderate to strong negative correlations

Discussion
Associating short weather episodes with local Rt peaks in individual states is interesting, but
certainly has its limits. The main result of the present study is rather based on the convergence
of these local correlations, as initially presented in Fig. 1 (p.6): (1) Rt was most often negatively
correlated to weather variables such as T, WBT and AH and (2) this correlation was stronger
for time shifts of around 11 days, i.e. delays that are congruent with estimated time between
infection and case report (ICR, see methods).
A spurious correlation between weather and Rt could be due to weather becoming naturally
colder through autumn, and Rt coincidentally increasing, as U.S. approached a 3rd wave
nationally. 5-month correlation remaining moderately negative for all tested ICR, from 1 to 30
days (Fig. 1, top) is the expression of such overall, mildly informative covariation between
weather and Rt. However, the peak of 5-month correlation around 10-11 days of delay cannot
be explained by such a confounding covariation. Even more striking is the result that mean 1month r becomes moderately negative *only* for ICR around 11 days (Fig. 1, bottom).
Another spurious effect could be that Rt and weather coincidentally oscillate with similar time
periods, and the peak in correlation for a given state would only express the phase shift
between unrelated periodic signals. Under this hypothesis, the phase-shift value should be
essentially random, and different from state to state. This not what was found here, as pooled
national data shows a convergence of phase shifts across states (Fig. 1).
The detailed observation of weather vs. Rt in a given state sometimes shows striking
parallelism between weather record and time-shifted Rt data (see e.g. New York state on p.8),
but the parallelism is never perfect, and sometimes hardly visible. This is not surprising as (1)
covid-19 and weather variables were collected from unrelated sources with different methods,
and hence are expected to contain different noise/error patterns. Moreover, (2) even if there is
a causal mechanism linking weather to covid-19 Rt, weather is not expected to have a direct,
linear effect on transmission (see below). Last, (3) even though the study period was selected
for comparatively low social restriction changes, it is probable that restrictions varied to some
extent, and also that people’s behaviour adapted to the report of local surges, which could have
a self-leveling effect on observed Rt.
Hypothetical causal mechanisms. There is an apparent paradox in finding correlations
between Rt and outdoor weather data, while it is now commonly admitted that a majority of
covid-19 transmissions are airborne, and occur indoors [1]. Here I list 3 putative mechanisms
(via T, WBT and AH, respectively) that might link outdoor weather with indoor disease
transmission. These proposed mechanisms are admittedly speculative at this point, and not
exclusive: 2 or 3 of them might be at play simultaneously, or alternatively according to the time
period and temperature range. Maybe only one of these mechanisms operates, but correlations
are observed for all three weather variables because they are physically related (see equations
in Methods section). It is also possible that none of the following causal hypotheses hold, and
that other mechanisms are at play.

(i) Outdoor temperature (T) might have at least two effects on human behaviour that can play
an important role in indoor airborne transmission. First, as weather becomes cold (e.g.
progressively through autumn, or on an episodic “cold wave”), a significant proportion of
population might actively avoid long periods of time outdoors, and thus spend a larger
proportion of their time indoors. Collectively, this can concentrate viruses in indoor air, and also
individually increases the probability to encounter contaminated air. Moreover, while staying
indoors, people might be less prone to ventilate their home or office room frequently if the
outdoor temperature is very cold, for thermal comfort reasons. Both of these possible
behavioral effects are not expected to have a linear relationship with T: for example, avoidance
of outdoor space and indoor ventilation appears likely when outdoor T drops from 10 to 0°C,
but less so from 30 to 20°C. However, by looking back at state results, one can observe Rt
peaks associated with colder episodes for a wide range of outdoor temperatures, from below
0°C (e.g. MN, ND, ID) to above 20°C (e.g. FL, VA, KY, MO).
(ii) Outdoor wet-bulb temperature (WBT) is a compound variable integrating both T and RH
[16], and can be understood as a proxy to upper respiratory tract temperature of people
breathing outside (see Methods). A low tract temperature might in turn facilitate penetration of
the virus through several cellular effects (e.g. [14,15], and other mechanisms cited in [2]). As
such, outdoor WBT might be of importance to (rare) outdoor disease transmission, e.g. in
crowded outdoor spaces (e.g. streets, queues, etc.). On the other hand, an effect of low outdoor
WBT on indoor transmission is not straightforward if indoor spaces are heated for comfort. Still,
an effect might exist due to the mobility from indoor to outdoor environment. If, after “catching
viruses” in a contaminated room, people go outside in cold, dry air (e.g. for daily commuting),
the viruses deposited in their upper respiratory tracts might beneficiate from a cooling mucosa,
and see facilitated conditions for infection. Similarly, before entering a building filled with
contaminated indoor air, if a person breathed cold, dry air outside, it is possible that her/his
respiratory mucosa remains cold and “fragile” to virus penetration for a certain amount of time,
before warming up.
(iii) A less speculative and more general mechanism implies absolute humidity (AH). Note that
like WBT, AH is calculated from T and RH, and as such is a compound of 2 primarily collected
variables. However, unlike WBT, AH ultimately reflects a basic physical property of air: simply
the amount of water per air volume, in g/m3.
In first approximation, indoor air initially comes from the outdoor air reservoir. During the cold
season, indoor air is often heated for comfort, hence indoor and outdoor T become very
different. This is not the case for AH: in the absence of secondary indoor water vapor sources,
AH is conserved from outside to inside [20]. Thus, AH is the only outdoor variable of the 3
analyzed here that is conserved indoors.
Indoor heating is known to “dry air”, but this refers to RH, not AH. For example, outdoor air at
10°C and 80% RH contains about 7.5 g of water per m3 (the maximum it could contain, i.e. at
100% RH, would be 9.4 g/m3). If this outdoor air is simply drawn indoors and heated to 20°C
(thermal expansion is neglected here), the amount of water does not change. AH remains ~7.5
g/m3, but as 20°C air could potentially contain up to 17.3 g/m3 of water vapor, RH is now 43%
only.

From the previous example, it appears that outdoor AH not only is conserved inside, but also
determines indoor RH for a given indoor temperature. Low RH has been reported to increase
sars-cov-2 and other viruses stability [21], so this could be a first causal mechanism linking
outdoor AH and indoor infection probability: the virus survives better in dry indoor air.
Moreover, if the indoor temperature is held constant by heating, AH also directly determines
indoor WBT. Building on the same reasoning as for the previous mechanism (ii), low AH coming
from outside would lower indoor RH, which despite regulated indoor T would lower indoor WBT,
resulting in a cooler, more fragile respiratory mucosa as individuals breathe dry indoor air. This
could be a second possible causal link between outdoor AH and indoor infections.
Focusing back on outdoor weather, it is noteworthy that, as hot air can physically contain much
more water vapor than cold air, a primary determinant of outdoor AH in the first place is outdoor
T, and this translates into an important covariation between both environmental variables. The
question is to know whether an effect of outdoor T on Rt operates through human behaviour
(mechanism i) or through AH and its effects on indoor RH and WBT (mechanism iii/ii). In the
vast majority of investigated states, AH and T correlations with Rt were of very similar strength.
AH appeared as a better Rt predictor than T in a few states only (e.g. NM, CA, FL, WY),
whereas T was a better predictor than AH in TX. Overall, it seems the present results are not
sufficient to conclude on which of the proposed mechanisms is more likely, and to understand
if T or AH is a better candidate as primary driver of indoor transmission.
Limitations. The present results are highly dependent on the quality of raw data. New covid19 case counts are manually collected from states’ public data [3], which can contain variable
delays between states, but also even within a state, if the reporting policy changed through
months in the pandemic. Large, prolonged surges can amplify issues, with increasing testing
delays [6] or reporting backlogs, that add up to variable ICR delays, between and within states.
The method used here is quite sensible to “spikes” in the data, as outliers have a heavy
contribution to product-moment sums as computed in Pearson’s r. Here I chose to remove only
the most disrupting spikes in 3 states (NC, MA, TX), otherwise sticking to the raw covid-19 new
cases data (+ 7-day averaging). Other approaches with systematic, stronger smoothing are
possible [see e.g. 10] and might allow higher correlation coefficients.
In states with small populations and/or very low case counts, Rt becomes more dependent on
individual, stochastic cluster emergences, which can hide any potential weather determinism
of transmission. For this reason, I do not expect that the present approach translates as well
to infra geographic levels, e.g. counties.
State meteorological records from the COVID-19 Open-Data [11] were used as-is, and would
also benefit from a careful re-examination. Ideally, hourly T and RH should be used to compute
hourly AH and WBT before averaging to daily values. Also, the way individual weather station
data are aggregated to yield state summary variables should be carefully considered by
specialists, and maybe weighted by local county population. Such weather data quality-control
might also contribute to revealing stronger correlations than what I report here, or higher
homogeneity across states.

As each state most probably has its own epidemiological parameters (population density,
mobility, compliance to social distancing policies, behavioral reaction to local surge reports,
behavioral reaction to weather change, etc.), it should not be expected that the observed
weather/Rt correlations superpose or line-up well between states (but this would deserve
further investigation). There are a lot of unaccounted-for local factors that can shift or distort
any effect of weather on disease transmission. Here we only tried to mitigate one of the most
powerful factors, i.e. social distancing policy changes, by choosing the mid-June to midNovember period as the scope of the present study. Investigating how an effect of weather on
Rt partially persists or disappears altogether during periods of stricter restrictions (e.g. current
winter) would need further investigation, ideally including detailed data on the time course of
social restriction measures by state.
For the same reasons, the present approach can be tried on other countries, but is expected
to work better (1) in countries with limited and/or relatively stable restriction measures and (2)
at aggregation levels large enough to yield significant (ideally >500) daily case counts. These
two factors guided the choice of U.S. as a model nation for the present study.
Last, an hitherto overlooked confounding factor could be transmission from state to state. If the
population has frequent inter-state mobility, a state with high infection levels could cause rise
of infections in neighbor states. This phenomenon would presumably lower the level of local
correlation between weather and Rt, hence contribute to deteriorate the present results.
However, this dependency between neighbor states could also cause some level of
autocorrelation in inter-state correlations. In other words, observing similar weather and similar
Rt in 2 neighbor states should probably not be considered as 2 fully independent observations
of a “weather effect”, if there was significant inter-state mobility.
Applications. If a weather-Rt causal relationship gets confirmed by further investigations,
there is a potential for predicting case count evolution about 10 days in advance, from the
observed current daily weather data. In fact this would not be “forecasting”, only a way to catch
up with the virus and “nowcasting” current transmission level (rather than retro-calculating Rt
from case counts with a ~2-week delay as is currently done). However, looking at the present
results, and the confounding factors at play, such current transmission estimation from weather
data might only be in terms of increased/decreased risk of infection, at best. This still could
prove quite useful to try to outrun the continuing unpredictability of local pandemic surges.
Another prospective question is whether specific actions could be proposed to mitigate a
possible increased infection risk during cold/dry weather episodes. Generic actions such as
stricter social restriction measures during these weather episodes could be a first, debatable
avenue. Concentrating strict measures (e.g. stay-at-home orders, business closure) on short
high-risk periods could allow for a more normal social and economic life the rest of the time.
More specific countermeasures (e.g. supplemental indoor water vapor sources, indoor RH
monitoring) and adapted behaviors (e.g. avoidance of shared indoor spaces specifically during
cold/dry weather episodes) can be imagined, but should be based on better understanding of
the mechanism underlying the observed correlations.
