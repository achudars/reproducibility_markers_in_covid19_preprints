Abstract

31

Background The outbreak of the recently emerged novel corona virus disease 2019

32

(COVID-19) poses a challenge for public health laboratories. We aimed to evaluate

33

the diagnostic value of serological assay for SARS-CoV-2.

34

Methods A newly-developed ELISA assay for IgM and IgG antibodies against N

35

protein of SARS-CoV-2 were used to screen the serums of 238 admitted hospital

36

patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from February 6 to

37

February 14, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by real time RT-PCR on

38

pharyngeal swab specimens.

39

Findings Of the 238 patients, 194 (81.5%) were detected to be antibody (IgM and/or

40

IgG) positive, which was significantly higher than the positive rate of viral RNA

41

(64.3%). There was no difference in the positive rate of antibody between the

42

confirmed patients (83.0%, 127/153) and the suspected patients (78.8%, 67/85) whose

43

nucleic acid tests were negative. After the patients were defined to the different stages

44

of disease based on the day when the test samples were collected, the analysis results

45

showed that the antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial

46

onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. After 10

47

days, the antibody positive rates jumped to above 80% from less than 50%. On the

48

contrary, the positive rates of viral RNA kept above 60% in the first 11 days after

49

initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased. In addition, half of the

50

suspected patients with symptoms for 6-10 days were detected to be antibody positive.

51

Interpretation The suspected patients were most likely infected by SARS-CoV-2.

52

Before the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms, nucleic acid test is important for

53

confirmation of viral infection. The combination of serological assay can greatly

54

improve the diagnostic efficacy. After that, the diagnosis for viral infection should be

55

majorly dependent on serological assay.

Introduction
A novel betacoronavirus 1 named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus

59
60

2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a recent cluster cases of respiratory illness named corona

61

virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in multiple regions of the world, and it leads to a

62

serious public health problem especially in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China since

63

December 2019. 2 By March 1, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases have been

64

identified globally both in China and other 58 countries spanning Asia, Europe,

65

Oceania, North and South America, and Northeast Africa. It is evidenced that

66

SARS-CoV-2 can transmit rapidly from person to person, which is evidently found in

67

hospital and family settings. 3-5
The SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronaviruses

68
69

(CoVs). 6-8 Sequence and phylogenetic tree of CoVs analysis indicates that

70

SARS-CoV-2 is genetically distinct from SARS-CoV and is more closely related to

71

bat-SL-CoV ZC45 and bat-SL-CoV ZXC21. 1 SARS-CoV-2 owns a similar

72

receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV. 1 A typical CoV contains four

73

main structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N)

74

proteins. The S protein homotrimers are required for attachment to host receptors, 9

75

and both the M protein and the E protein play important roles in virus assembly. 10,11

76

The N protein is responsible for packaging the encapsidated genome into virions, 12,13

77

and acts as a viral RNA silencing suppressor that is beneficial for the viral replication.

78

14

79

overexpressed during infection, 15 indicating that N protein should be a potential

Furthermore, the N protein has high immunogenic activity and is profusely

80

source of a diagnostic antigen for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Many diagnostic

81

methods based on the N protein have been developed for SARS-CoV detection. 16-18

82

In addition, different CoVs possess special structural and accessory proteins, such as

83

HE protein, 3a/b protein, and 4a/b protein. 19

84

Both nucleic acid test and serological assay are commonly used for infectious

85

disease screening and diagnosis. In the present case of SARS-CoV-2, nucleic acid test

86

has been being routinely used to detect causative viruses from respiratory secretions

87

by real-time RT-PCR in China. However, the nucleic acid tests appeared to have a

88

high false negative rate because of several unavoidable reasons, including the

89

sensitivity of the detection kits that have not been well assessed, sampling location

90

and technique, etc. A large number of clinically-suspected patients, whose nucleic

91

acid tests were negative, are unable to get timely confirmed-diagnosis and hospital

92

treatment, which potentially promotes the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and leads to a rapid

93

disease progress of the suspected patients.

94

In this study, a newly-developed IgM and IgG antibody detecting Enzyme-linked

95

immunosorbent assays (ELISA) based on a recombinant fragment of SARS-CoV-2 N

96

protein were used to detect IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in serum of 238

97

admitted hospital patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. The

98

results strongly indicated that the suspected patients were infected. We also analyze

99

the diagnostic value of the IgM and IgG testing in COVID-19, even in the early stage

100
101

of disease.

Methods

103

Patients and samples

104

All consecutive patients (n=238) with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2

105

infection who have been tested by real-time RT-PCR for viral infection and were

106

being treated in General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA from February

107

6 to February 14, 2020, were enrolled. The general information (age, sex, vital signs,

108

coexisting disorders), clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics data of the

109

patients on admission were extracted from electronic medical records. Among the 238

110

recruited patients, 153 patients were laboratory-confirmed cases, who were tested

111

positive for viral RNA by real time RT-PCR assay on pharyngeal swab specimens, and

112

the remaining 85 patients having negative results for real time RT-PCR assay were

113

clinically diagnosed as highly-suspected cases according to the notice on the issuance

114

of strategic guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. 20 The serum

115

samples were collected once from each recruited patient. Meanwhile, the serum

116

samples from 70 ordinary patients and 50 healthy blood donors were randomly

117

selected as the controls. The study was approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee

118

and written informed consent was waived for emerging infectious diseases.

119

Real time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Assay

120

Pharyngeal swab specimens were collected from patients and placed into a

121

collection tube with 200 μL of virus preservation solution. Total RNA was extracted

122

using the respiratory sample RNA isolation kit (Shuoshi, Shanghai, China). After

123

vortex, 50 μL of cell lysates were transferred into another collection tube. The

124

collection tube was centrifugated at 1000 rpm/min for 5 min after standing at room

125

temperature for 10 minutes. 5 μL RNA was prepared and used for real time RT-PCR.

126

Real time RT-PCR was performed using the nucleic acid testing kit (Daan,

127

Guangzhou, China) for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The open reading frame 1ab

128

(ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N) were simultaneously selected as the two

129

target genes. The human GAPDH gene was used as an internal control. The specific

130

primers and probes set for ORF1ab and N were as follows: ORF1ab-forward primer

131

5'-ACCTTCTCTTGCCACTGTAGC-3'; ORF1ab-reverse primer

132

5'-AGTATCAACCATATCCAACCATGTC-3'; and the probe

133

5'-FAM-ACGCATCACCCAACTAGCAGGCATAT-BHQ1-3'; N-forward primer

134

5'-TTCAAGAAATTCAACTCCAG-3'; N-reverse primer

135

5'-AGCAGCAAAGCAAGAGCAGCATC-3'; and the probe

136

5'-VIC-TCCTGCTAGAATGGCTGGCAATGGCG-BHQ1-3'. The real time RT-PCR

137

experiment was thoroughly performed according to kit’s instructions. The reaction

138

mixture contains 17 μL of reaction buffer A, 3 μL of reaction buffer B, and 5 μL RNA

139

template. The real time RT-PCR assay was performed under the following conditions:

140

incubation at 50 °C for 15 min and 95 °C for 15 min, 45 cycles of denaturation at

141

94 °C for 15 s, and extending and collecting fluorescence signal at 55 °C for 45 s. A

142

cycle threshold value (Ct-value) ≤ 40 was defined as a positive test result, and a

143

Ct-value > 40 was defined as a negative test.

144

Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)

146

kit (Lizhu, Zhuhai, China ), which was established for detecting IgM or IgG antibody

147

against N protein of SARS-CoV-2. For IgM detection, ELISA plates were previously

148

coated with mouse anti-human IgM (μ chain) monoclonal antibody. 100 μL diluted

149

(1:100) serum sample was added into the pre-coated plates with three replicating

150

wells for each sample and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The heat-inactivated positive

151

and negative serum were included on each plate. After washing, 100 μL horse radish

152

peroxidase (HRP) conjugated recombinant (rN) protein of SARS-CoV-2 was added.

153

Then the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min followed by washing. 50 μL of

154

TMB substrate solution and 50 μL of the corresponding buffer were added and

155

incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 50 μL of 2 M

156

sulfuric acid, and the absorbance value at 450 nm (A450) was determined. The cut off

157

value was calculated by sum of 0.100 and average A450 of negative control replicates.

158

A450 less than cut off value was defined as a negative test, and A450 greater than or

159

equal to cut off value was defined as a positive test.

160

For IgG detection

，ELISA plates were previously coated with rN protein. 5 μL

161

serum sample diluted with 100 μL dilution buffer were added into the plates. After

162

incubation and washing, HRP-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG monoclonal

163

antibody was added into the plates for detection. The other operation steps were

164

performed as described in the above IgM detection. The cut off value was calculated

165

by the sum of 0.130 and average A450 of negative control replicates. A450 less than cut

166

off value was defined as a negative test, and A450 greater than or equal to cut off value

167

was defined as a positive test.

Statistical analysis

169

Continuous variables were described as the means and standard deviations or

170

medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) values. Categorical variables were expressed

171

as the counts and percentages. Independent group t tests were applied to continuous

172

variables that were normally distributed; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney test was used.

173

Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square tests, while the Fisher exact

174

test was used when the data were limited. Statistical analyses were performed using

175

Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0 software. A two-sided

176

α of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

179

Demographics and patient characteristics

180

The serum samples were collected from 238 admitted hospital patients with

181

confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection in General Hospital of Central Theater

182

Command of PLA from February 6 to February 14, 2020. The clinical characteristics

183

of the patients were shown in Table 1. The median age was 55 years (IQR, 38.3-65),

184

and 138 (58.0%) of the patients were men. Hypertension (63 [26.5%]), diabetes (25

185

[10.5%]), and cardiovascular disease (24 [10.1%]) were the most common coexisting

186

disorders. Of these patients, the most common symptoms at illness onset were fever

187

(206 [86.6%]), dry cough (128 [53.8%]), and fatigue (78 [32.8%]). A small number of

188

patients possessed the symptoms of abdominal pain (1 [0.4%]), vomiting (3 [1.3%]),

189

and dizziness (4 [1.7%]). On admission, leucocytes were below the normal range in

190

41 (17.2%) patients and above the normal range in 21 (8.8%) patients. 125 (52.5%)

191

patients had lymphocytes below the normal range and no patients were found to have

192

lymphocytes above the normal range. Neutrophils were below the normal range in 28

193

(11.8%) patients and above the normal range in 32 (13.4%) patients. According to CT,

194

235 (98.7%) patients showed ground-glass opacity and/or patchy shadowing.

195

According to the positive or negative results of real time RT-PCR assay for

196

pharyngeal swab specimens, the enrolled patients were divided into two groups: the

197

confirmed group and the suspected group. There were no statistical differences of

198

baseline characteristics of the two groups patients.

199

Performance and validation of ELISA assays for viral specific IgM and IgG

200

antibodies

201

Each serum sample of 238 patients were respectively tested for IgM and IgG

202

antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by using newly-developed ELISA kits based on N

203

protein of SARS-CoV-2. The IgM and/or IgG could be detected in 194 serum samples,

204

and the positive rate ( 81.5% ) was significantly higher than that of SARS-CoV-2

205

RNA detected by real time RT-PCR, which was 64.3% (153/238) (Fig.1A).

206

Importantly, there were no difference in positive rates of IgM and/or IgG between the

207

confirmed patients (83.0%, 127/153) and the suspected patients (78.8%, 67/85)

208

(Fig.1B), suggesting that the clinically suspected patients, who were viral RNA

209

negative detected by RT-PCR, were mostly infected.

210
211

To verify the specificity of the ELISA assays, the serum samples from 70
randomly-selected ordinary patients and 50 healthy blood donors were simultaneously

212

detected. Four samples from the ordinary patients were identified as antibody positive

213

(including one dual positive sample, two IgM-positive samples, and one IgG-positive

214

sample) and no positive was found in the samples of healthy blood donors (Fig.1A).

215

These results confirmed the specificity of the IgG and IgM ELISA assays.

216

Dynamic analysis of ELISA and RT-PCR assays

217

To study the diagnostic value of ELISA assay for virus-specific antibodies,

218

especially in the early stage of the disease, we tried to analyze the positive rates of

219

ELISA and RT-PCR assays in the different stages of disease. To this end, each patient

220

was assigned to different days after initial onset of symptoms based on the time when

221

the pharyngeal swab specimen was detected to be positive or the last recoded

222

detection was still negative, or the blood was collected. The positive rates of viral

223

RNA, IgM and/or IgG were compared in every day after initial onset of symptoms

224

(Table 2). Due to a small number of samples in each individual day, we pooled the

225

samples in which the positive rates were similar in consecutive days. Thus, the disease

226

process were divided into five phases of 0-5, 6-10,11-12, 13-15 days and more than

227

16 days after initial onset of symptoms (Table 3 & Fig.2). The data showed that

228

positive rates of IgM and/or IgG were very low in the first five days after initial onset

229

of symptoms because there was no antibody produced in most of patients in this early

230

stage, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. Day 11 after initial onset

231

of symptoms is a key time point because the positive rates of IgM and/or IgG jumped

232

to above 80% from less than 50% at this time point. The dynamic pattern is consistent

233

with SARS-CoV infection. 21 On the contrary, the real-time RT-PCR was more

234

effective for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection than ELISA in the early stage of disease.

235

The positive rate of viral RNA detected by RT-PCR was maintained above 60% in the

236

first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased with the rapid

237

increase of positive rate of antibodies. These results demonstrated that ELISA-based

238

IgM and/or IgG detection should be used as a major viral diagnostic test for the

239

patients with symptoms for more than 10 days. Because about 50%

240

clinically-suspected patients with symptoms for 6-10 days were detected to be

241

positive by ELISA-based IgM and/or IgG detection (Table 4), the combination of

242

ELISA and RT-PCR assays will greatly improve the detection efficacy, even in the

243

early stage of COVID-19 infection.

244
245
246

Discussion
The outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) poses a

247

challenge for public health laboratories, especially for clinical laboratories of the

248

hospitals in Wuhan, China. Although serological assay is a frequently used method for

249

viral infection screening and diagnosis, there are few reports about serological assay

250

in detection of SARS-CoV-2 up to now. In this study, we report the application of the

251

SARS-CoV-2 N protein-based ELISA for detection of IgM and IgG antibodies in the

252

admitted hospital patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. The

253

results showed that the positive rates of IgM and IgG were significantly higher than

254

that of viral RNA detected by real-time RT-PCR on the pharyngeal swab specimens of

255

all enrolled patients. This result is further supported by the fact that the suspected

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.06.20031856; this version posted March 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

256

patients had the same positive rate of antibody as the confirmed patients. These data

257

strongly demonstrated that the clinically suspected patients were mostly infected by

258

SARS-CoV-2.

259

In this study, the serum samples were collected in a time period of 9 days from

260

the patients in different stages of disease. The positive rates of nucleic acid test and

261

serological assay in total populations cannot reflect their diagnostic value in

262

surveillance and control of the disease, because the production of antiviral antibodies

263

will decrease the positive rates of the nucleic acid test as the disease progresses. In

264

order to objectively determine the disease stage of the patients, we used the initial

265

onset of symptoms of the patients as the start time point. Based on the day when the

266

test sample was collected, all patients were defined to the different stages of disease.

267

The resulted dynamics patterns of positive rates of viral RNA and antiviral antibodies

268

proved the rationality of the disease stage definition. Our analysis identified the 11th

269

day after initial onset of symptoms as a key time point in the disease process when

270

most infected patients produce antiviral antibodies. After this time point, the diagnosis

271

for viral infection should majorly depend on serological assay. Before this time point,

272

nucleic acid test is important for confirmation of viral infection. The combination of

serological assay can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy.

According to the rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of

275

SARS-CoV-2 currently implemented in China, 20 a confirmed case of COVID-19

276

patients exclusively depends on the positive result of nucleic acid test or virus gene

277

sequencing. Although this is a preliminary ELISA assay for SARS-CoV-2, our study

strongly demonstrate that serological assay is very important for surveillance and

279

control of the current COVID-19, especially in Wuhan of China, where a lot of

280

patients are waiting to be confirmed at present. Moreover, most of patients had

281

symptoms for more than 11 days.
