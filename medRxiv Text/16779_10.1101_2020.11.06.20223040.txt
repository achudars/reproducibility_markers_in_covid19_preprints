ABSTRACT
During the novel coronavirus pandemic, also known as SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19
pandemic, frontline healthcare professionals suffered psychological as well as pathological
trauma due to the lack of preparation to cope with this unforeseen situation. The protocols to
prevent the spread of this disease proved to be less effective than anticipated. In these
circumstances, improvement of the existing triage system was felt and an AUDIO-VISUAL
TRIAGE (AVT) system was introduced to enhance confidence as well as increase the safety
of frontline healthcare professionals. The current analysis was performed from March 21,
2020, to April 28, 2020, until the completion of sixty response forms, at Bahria Town
International Hospital, Lahore. Thirty participants (Group A) deployed on visual triage and
other thirty (Group B) on AVT for screening suspected cases of COVID-19 infection.
Anxiety levels were measured by using the GAD-7 scoring system and the participants of
both groups were periodically tested for COVID-19 infection by PCR. Independent t-test was
used to evaluate the significance of different variables at a confidence level of 95%. The
result of the current study revealed the effectiveness of AVT for the screening of COVID-19
patients. There was a statistically significant increase in anxiety levels and severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection rate in group A as compared to
group B. Almost all participants in group A wanted to shift their place of work or ready to
quit the job if they were forced to perform their duties at the same visual triage. AVT system
for COVID-19 screening found to be more safe and less stressful than visual triage. It is not
only a simple and effective way to prevent the spread of diseases but also boosted the
confidence of frontline healthcare professionals to fight against coronavirus spread.

INTRODUCTION
The pandemics are frightening for everyone, especially for healthcare workers. The
most important aspect of dealing with the pandemic is to protect and save the healthcare
workers so that they can treat the rest of the people effectively (Mason et al; 2020). Triage is
the forefront of an emergency department of an acute hospital which becomes more
fundamental during the pandemics. keeping in view the COVID-19 prevailing situation, a
new Triage system to filter and classify the patients reaching hospital with suspected corona
virus infection was developed, named as “AUDIO-VISUAL TRIAGE” system abbreviated as
AVT. The recent alarming situation of corona virus infection that has spread to 196 countries
around the globe and resulted in failure of routine triage of Emergency Department (Habibi et
al; 2020).

Visual Triage System
From the beginning of rapid increase in coronavirus cases every hospital in Pakistan
placed a screening triage named as visual triage system outside the main entry door. So a
two-stage triage is introduced, first a visual triage (outside at entry door) & a routine triage
(inside Emergency Department). But at visual triage, healthcare providers felt scared and
threatened due to proximity with the patients and their attendants. As a result, they became
reluctant and even some of them refused to perform duties at visual triage desk.
Audio-Visual Triage System
Keeping this in mind, an Audio System was added to visual triage that resulted in an
AVT. Protocols of AVT included, a medical personal sits on TRIAGE DESK (with glass
barrier sheet on it) wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) at a distance of more than 6
feet from the PATIENT DESK. Both desks are connected with Non-touchable MIC
SYSTEM for communication (fig 1,2). An Assessment Form with the scoring system is filled
by the triage medical staff member and further management of the patient is based on the
score achieved (Sivan et al; 2020). In doubtful cases, to reduce the chance of wrong decision
(which can be devastating for the whole hospital), an Emergency Doctor re-assess the case
and decides accordingly. Then Pathways for the patient management is developed according
to the available facilities of the respective hospital and the instructions of Government. The
suspected or confirmed cases are either treated in Isolation wards or Referred to respective
Centre (designated by The Government) with all the facilities.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of sixty (n=60) participants was recruited to study the effectiveness of AVT
System, in the current cross-sectional comparative study. They were further divided into two
groups. Participants of group A were performing their duty on visual triage while those of
group B were on AVT system for screening the COVID-19 suspected patients. Participants of
both groups were provided with the same quality of PPEs. Those participants having previous
psychological illness, frequently used to use the washroom, had non-serious attitude and poor
compliance with the protocols of wearing PPEs were excluded from the study. After a week
every participant was tested by PCR for COVID-19 infection. Questionnaires were
distributed among the participants and the response form was collected for further analysis.
The study was approved by the ethical review committee of Bahria Town International
Hospital Lahore (31.5204° N; 74.3587° E), Pakistan. For the assessment of anxiety, GAD-7
scoring system was used and outcomes were assessed according to the Spitzer et al., 2006
scoring system. The GAD-7 score is calculated by assigning scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, to the
response categories of 'not at all', 'several days', 'more than half the days', and 'nearly every
day', respectively, and adding together the scores for the seven questions. Scores of 5, 10, and
15 are taken as the cut-off points for mild, moderate and severe anxiety, respectively. Using
the threshold score of 10, the GAD-7 has a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 82% for
GAD. It is moderately good at screening three other common anxiety disorders - panic
disorder (sensitivity 74%, specificity 81%), social anxiety disorder (sensitivity 72%,
specificity 80%) and post-traumatic stress disorder (sensitivity 66%, specificity 81%)
Apart from the GAD-7 scoring, another question, related to job satisfaction, was
asked. The data were statistically analyzed with the help of independent t-test using SPSS
Software (version 22). In addition, the p-values of less than 0.05 remained statistically
significant.
RESULTS
The result of the current study revealed the effectiveness of AVT for the screening of
COVID-19 patients. Total of sixty (n=60) participants were allocated equally in two groups.
Group A were performing their duties on visual triage with male to female ratio was 21:9
(mean age 28.3 ± 4.01) whereas group B were indulged in screening COVID-19 patients on
Audio-Visual Triage (male to female ratio 22:8, mean age=26.56 years). (table-1). The
significantly increased levels of anxiety in group A were found as compared to group B
(p=0.025).

DISCUSSION
Triage is an important area of an Emergency Department of any acute Hospital. In
this process, patients are classified according to the severity of their diseases so that the
acutely sick and more serious patients are seen before the less serious (Bruijns et ak; 2008).
Normally, the severity of the disease is assessed in a Triage Room of hospital where the most
senior nurse asks about the presenting complaints of patients and checks the vitals of patients
before allocating any Category / Class to them. Most of the triage systems have five
Categories or Classes. Patients of Category I are the most serious patients, to be seen straight
away and patients of Category V are less urgent and would be seen at the last. There are few
Triage systems in the world e.g.; Manchester Triage, Australian Triage and Canadian Triage
(FitzGerald et al; 2020). But these Triage systems are useful only for classifying patients having
routine diseases but cannot be used during disasters like COVID-19 pandemic (Bazyar et al;
2020). If traditional triage criteria are used in pandemics, it can result in the contamination of

the Emergency Department and ultimately the whole hospital which may need to be
fumigated. Moreover, the Triage staff is liable to be infected and feel threatened which can
result in a sensation of frustration and decrease job satisfaction (Forsgärde et al; 2013). An
AVT proved to be a simple and effective solution to minimize the elevated psychological
stress and more effective triage system in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover,
the pandemics do not give much time for preparation (by the Medical & nonmedical teams)
and require big budgets as well as resources by the government. There is a need of increase
number of healthcare workers, their training to deal with the pandemic disease, availability of

big isolations areas, equipment, accessories and logistics in a short time (Kumar et al; 2020).
These become more difficult to manage in poor economic countries. But by taking simple
and cost-effective measures like AVT system, for screening suspected subjects, can boost the
combating capabilities of frontline healthcare professionals against SARS-CoV-2 virus
spread.
CONCLUSION
The AVT system is more safe and effective strategy to prevent the spread of COVID19 infection as patients are directed to their respective areas, without compromising the
management. So it can be concluded AVT system should be recommended for all the
hospitals dealing with suspected cases of Corona virus infection as it has been found
practical, safe and confidence booster for frontline medical fighters on the basis of results of
the current study.
LIMITATIONS
The residence of participants located at different places like hostels or homes. There
would be a chance of virus transmission in participants form their residence.
