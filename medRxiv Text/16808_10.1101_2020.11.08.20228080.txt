Abstract:
The global pandemic of the novel coronavirus that started in Wuhan, China has affected more than
50 million people worldwide and caused more than 1263,787 tragic deaths. To date, the COVID19 virus is still spreading and affecting thousands of people. The main problem with testing for
COVID-19 is that there are very few test kits available for a large number of affected or suspicious
individuals. This leads to the need for automatic detection systems that use artificial intelligence.
Deep learning is one of the most powerful AI tools available, so we recommend creating a
convolutional neural network to detect COVID-19 positive patients from chest radiographs.
According to previous studies, lung X-rays of COVID-19-positive patients show obvious
characteristics, so this is a reliable method for testing patients, because X-ray examination of
suspicious patients is easier than rt-PCR. Our model has been trained with 820 chest radiographic
images (excluding data augmentation) collected from 3 databases, with a classification accuracy
of 99.45% (training accuracy of 99.70%), sensitivity of 99.30% and specificity of 99.40 %, proved
that our model has become a reliable COVID-19 detector.

1. Introduction
The novel coronavirus pandemic which originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has caused
worldwide panic. The virus, which caused this COVID-19 pandemic, was called severe acute
respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 or SARSCoV-2. It has been declared as a pandemic by the
World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th March 2020 [1]. It infected more than 50 million
people and died Charges are in thousands. New cases appear every day, this Brings huge
challenges to healthcare professionals Find a cure and stop the spread. Even health care systems
in developed countries It is about to collapse due to the increase in number. So far, there is no
specific immunization or treatment for COVID-19. However, there are many continuous clinical
preliminary evaluations of potential drugs. As of November 2, 2020, approximately 48,030,327
cases of infection have been confirmed in more than 216 countries, of which 1,223,171 have died,
34,465,814 have recovered, and 12,252,984 have mild and 88,358 critical cases were found [2, 3].
The distribution of COVID-19 cases between 28th August 2020 and 10th October 2020 are shown
in the form of a bar graph in Fig 1. Their health requires patients in the intensive care unit. a lot of
the country has activated a complete lockdown to prevent Disease spread. The current standard
diagnosis of COVID-19 is the use of Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rt-PCR). It is based
on PCR technology [4], which is used to amplify and simultaneously detect or quantify a targeted

DNA molecule on real-time basis. Reverse transcriptase real-time PCR formats can detect and
quantify RNA molecules of the test organism in the sample on real time basis.

It uses a different thermo cycler than the conventional PCR. But, the major problem for rt-PCR is
that it is very expensive, 5-10 times more than the cost of conventional PCR. So, some hyperendemic regions or countries are unable to provide the large number of rt-PCRs required for testing
tens of thousands of suspected COVID-19 patients. This poses a possibility of some people to
spread the virus without knowing they are infected. Radiographic examinations that are available
in time are another major symptom tool of COVID-19. Most COVID-19 cases have comparable
bright spots on radiographs, including intersecting, multifocal, ground-glass opacity with edges or
spreading backwards, mainly in the lower projections in the early stages, and firm lungs in the
early stages. [5-9] To address this problem of scarcity of apparatus, Computed Tomography or CT
scan imaging has been used to detect the virus. Tao Ai et al. [10] reported a highest sensitivity of
97% based on detection from chest CT images of 1014 patients in Wuhan City, China. Fang et al.
[11] reported the highest sensitivity of 98% based on chest CT images of 51 patients. Gozes et al.
[12] employed deep learning methods for detection of COVID-19 positive patients using chest CT
scan images. Shi et al. [13] developed and employed a machine learning based algorithm on a large
COVID-19 CT scan images dataset for screening purpose. Wang et al. [14] developed a Residual
CNN based neural network and achieved an accuracy of 92.4. Apostolopoulos et al. [15] employed
transfer learning technique for classification of COVID-19, pneumonia and normal patients’ chest
X-rays and the best accuracy achieved was 96.78%. [16] proposed a framework based on Capsule
Network, known as the COVID-CAPS, for COVID-19 identification using X-ray images. The
proposed COVID-CAPS achieved 95.7% accuracy, 90% sensitivity, 95.8% specificity, and
0.97Area Under the Curve (AUC). Ayrton [17] used a small dataset of 339 images for training and

testing using ResNet50 based deep transfer learning technique and reported the validation accuracy
of 96.2%
However, there are drawbacks of CT scan imaging which includes the considerably longer time
required for the test than X-ray imaging [18] Also, availability of high-quality CT scanners may
be scarce in certain underdeveloped regions, which can make the timely detection of COVID-19
patients very difficult or impossible. On the flip side X-ray diagnosis is the most common imaging
technique and it is widely used for clinical care and epidemiological studies. So, using X-ray
imaging for COVID-19 detection can speed up the timely screening of patients. Also adding to the
fact that since March 2020, the amount of publicly available X-ray images of COVID-19 positive
patients has increased, it enables us to study the medical images for possible patterns for the
automatic diagnosis of corona virus infection.
Deep Learning applications have evolved over the past few years and the problem at hand seems
to be something that can be addressed using the deep learning techniques for highly accurate
screening of COVID-19 patients. Deep Learning is a machine learning technique that teaches a
computer how to learn by examples, something which humans often do. So artificial “neural
networks” are built so that the computer can learn through the examples (dataset) we provide. Deep
Learning is commonly used for object detection, classification, segmentation, lesion detection
problems in medical imaging. These datasets can be obtained from biomedical imaging techniques
like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), radiographic image (X-Rays), Computed Tomography
(CT), ultrasonography, endoscopy among others. Also, images of slides like histopathological and
cytological slides are used as data for cancer detection based deep learning models. These models
help in near perfect detection of diseases like breast cancer, diabetes, tumor, skin infections, etc.
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a special application of deep learning that is used
mostly for recognition, classification and segmentation purposes. As the name suggests, there must
be at least one layer that performs convolution operation instead of general matrix operations. This
makes the neural network different from general neural networks. CNN’s are actually perceptron’s
with multiple layers and simplified architecture. They have layers like activation, convolution,
softmax, identity, classification etc. The use of artificial Intelligence will aid radiologists in
detecting COVID-19 positive patients which is highly desired since it might be difficult for them
to visually analyze the X-rays and distinguish patients.
So, motivated by the dire need to develop a way to help fight the disease by detecting patients who
are COVID-19 positive and to help the research community who provided with the open source
databases, we developed COV-19Net, a Convolutional Neural network tailored to distinguish
between COVID-19 positive and normal patients through chest X-Ray images. This can aid the
medical practitioners fighting against the COVID -19 pandemic by detecting cases faster.
Examples of chest radiographic images of a COVID-19 positive patient and a tested negative
patient are shown in Fig 2a and Fig 2b respectively.

The rest of the paper has been organized into sections. Section 2, Materials and Methods, describes
the architecture of the neural network used, the dataset and the implementation procedures. Section

2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Convolutional neural network (CNN) [19] is a network architecture for deep learning. CNN is
deep Artificial neural network is mainly used for image classification, clustering them through
similarity and performing Object recognition in the scene. CNN consists of one or more
convolutional layers, and then follow Like one or more fully connected layers in a standard
multilayer neural network, it learns directly from the image. A CNN can be trained to perform
image analysis tasks, including classification, target detection, segmentation and images
processing.

This whole process of creating CNN is done by three layers

Convolutional Layer
Pooling Layer
Fully Connected Layer.

2.1 Convolutional Layer
Convolutional layers are a key component of convolutional neural networks, and are always at
least their first layer. Its purpose is to detect whether there is a set of features in the image received
as input. This is done through convolution filtering: the principle is to "drag" the window

representing the feature on the image, and calculate the convolution between the feature and each
part of the scanned image. Then think of features as filters: in this context, the two terms are
equivalent. The convolutional layer therefore receives several images as input and uses each filter
to calculate the convolution of each image. The filter corresponds exactly to the function we want
to find in the image. We obtain a feature map for each pair (image, filter), which tells us the
location of the feature in the image: the higher the value, the more similar the corresponding
location in the image is to the feature.

Fig. 3: Example of Convolutional Layer

2.2 Pooling Layer
Usually we will add a pooling layer among two convolutional layers in a standard convolutional
neural network structure. The usage of pooling layer is to rapidly decrease the size of data in the
middle layers so that we can reduce the amounts of calculations which results from a smaller
number of parameters and weights of each neuron. Through this approach, the problem of
overfitting can also be efficiently controlled. The pooling layers can work independently with the
MAX function, which can form the well-known max-pooling layers. One of the most popular
instances of a pooling layer is layer with filters of size 2 * 2. This kind of pooling layer with stride
2. The depth, height as well as width of input will be reduced to the half of their original size, and
thus the total size of output can be reduced to just 25% of the original size.
2.3 Fully Connected Layer
This type of layer receives an input vector and produces a new output vector. To do this, it applies
a linear combination and then possibly an activation function to the input values received. It takes
the output of the previous layers, “flattens” them and turns them into a single vector that can be an
input for the next stage.

3. Material and Methods
In this section we will describe the datasets used, the architecture of the COV-19Net and the
Implementation Procedure in the creation of the COV-19Net.

3.1 Collection of Dataset
For the training and evaluation of the COV-19Net we have collected chest radiographic images
from 3 open source databases: 1) GitHub open source dataset by Chowdhury et al. [20] 2) Dataset
from GitHub by Cohen et al. [21] 3) Positive radiographic images (CXR and CT) were carefully
chosen from Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM) [22] COVID‐19
DATABASE. All the images obtained were resized to 64x64x3 pixel size. We used 410 images of
COVID-19 positive patients and 410 images of COVID-19 negative patients. Data augmentation
was employed on the images to increase the data and the techniques used were rescaling, vertical
flipping, horizontal flipping, rotating, zooming, intensity shift and shear intensity shift (shear angle
in counter-clockwise direction) which gave us a dataset of total 2870 images of each class (COVID
positive and negative), i.e. a total of 5740 images. The training images were 70% of total images
and the rest 30% comprised the validation set. There is only a very small amount of data available
through more than a couple of million people have been tested and diagnosed. This suggests the
need for more open source data for building even better networks for the detection of COVID- 19
through Artificial Intelligence and for studying trends in the X-Ray images.
3.2 COV-19Net Architecture
A CNN network is composed of 3 types of layers namely, Convolution, Pooling and Dense Layer
or Fully Connected Layers. The convolution layer has filters of a specified size with learnable
parameters and these filters are convolved or mathematically speaking, cross-correlated with the
input image (which is a matrix too). The output is another matrix. Now the shape of the output
matrix depends on the input matrix size, the padding and the number of filters used for convolution.
Padding means adding a row and column to the input matrix all of whose components are zeroes.
This is done to make the height and width of the output matrix the same as that of the input matrix.
Padding, hence is of two types ‘same’ and ‘valid’. ‘Valid’ padding essentially means no padding
at all, while padding type ‘same’ means the padding is done such that the height and width of the
input and output matrices are the same. The depth or number of channels of the output matrix is
the same as the number of filters used for the convolution. Striding means the number of pixels to
be shifted by the kernel for operation (convolution or pooling). For example, if stride is 1, the
kernel is shifted one pixel at a time for convolution or pooling operation. Pooling Layers are
usually of two types namely, average pooling and max pooling. It is basically a dimensionality
reduction or feature extraction step. In Max Pooling the kernel size is swept through the input
matrix and the max of the numbers inside the matrix is selected and put in the output matrix, or in
Average Pooling the average of the numbers is calculated inside the kernel size and put in the
output matrix. In both cases normally the striding is done according to the size of the pool kernel.
An activation function is used just before the Pooling operation, like sigmoid activation, tanh
activation or ReLU activation or softmax activation for multiclass problem. A simple example of
max and average pooling is shown in Fig 4.

Fig. 4: Example of Max and Average Pooling.

After the final Convolution or Pooling operation, the matrix, say, is of shape (l, m, n), it is flattened
out that is it is converted to a vector of shape (l x m x n, 1). Next these are connected to the final
set of layers of the CNN called the Dense Layers or the Fully Connected layers because all neurons
of the flattened layer are connected to all neurons of the Fully Connected Layers. These layers are
essentially the same as in other types of neural networks. The final fully connected layer is also
the final layer of the CNN and has number of neurons as number of outputs required. For multiclass problem, the number of outputs is equal to the number of classes and the activation is
softmax. For binary classification problem, the number of outputs is 1 in case of sigmoid activation
and 2 in the case of softmax activation.
The COV-19Net Convolutional Neural Network is composed of 3 convolution layers, 2 max
pooling layers, and 2 fully connected Dense Layers and is as shown in the flowchart of Fig 5. The
layer by layer details of COV-19Net are presented as follows:
➢ Layer 1: This is a convolution layer where the input image of size 64x64x3, is convolved
with 32 filters of kernel size 3x3, without any padding, stride=1 and ReLU activation.
➢ Layer 2: This is a 2D Max Pooling layer of shape 2x2, without padding and strides = 2.
➢ Layer 3: This is the second convolution layer with 32 filters of kernel size 3x3, without any
padding, stride=1 and ReLU activation.
➢ Layer 4: This is a 2D Max Pooling layer of shape 2x2, without padding and strides = 2.
➢ Layer 5: This is the third and final convolution layer of 32 filters and kernel size of 3x3,
without any padding, stride=1 and ReLU activation. The output of this layer is flattened
out to form a 4608x1 vector
➢ Layer 6: This is the first fully connected layer or dense
➢ Layer of 128 units and ReLU activation.
➢ Layer 7: This is the second fully connected layer and final layer of the COV-19Net
consisting of 1 unit with sigmoid activation function.

3.3 Implementation
The network was trained using our dataset by giving random weight initialization. The inputs were
of shape 64x64x3. We used Adam optimization [23] and the hyper-parameters used were constant
learning rate of 0.001, batch size of 32, steps per epoch 100 and number of epochs 20. Further we
implemented data augmentation due to shortage of resources to train our model and the types of
augmentation used were: rescaling, rotating, zooming, vertical flip, horizontal flip, intensity shift
and shear intensity shift (shear angle in counter-clockwise direction). The proposed COV-19Net
model was implemented through the Keras framework using TensorFlow[24] backend.

4. Results and Implementation
The parameters measured for the proposed COV-19Net are accuracy, specificity, precision, recall
or sensitivity and f1 score which are calculated for both the training set and the validation set. First,
we need to define the terms True Positive (TP), False Positive (FP), True Negative (TN) and False
Negative (FN) for defining the aforementioned parameters. In a binary classification model let
there be two classes positive and negative. If the model classifies an image to belong to the positive
class and the image actually belongs to the positive class, meaning the classification is correct,
it is called True Positive. If the model classifies an image to belong to the negative class whereas
actually the image is part of the positive class, it is called False Positive. If the model classifies an
image to belong to the negative class and the image actually belongs in the negative class it is
classed True Negative. If the model classifies an image to belong to the positive class but actually
the image is part of the negative class, it is called to be False Negative.
Now the formulae for Accuracy, Specificity, Precision, Recall or Sensitivity and F1 Score are
given as follows:
𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 =

The model was trained for 200 steps epoch for 20 epochs. The values of all the mentioned
parameters and the loss obtained after Epoch 20 on training set and validation set are provided in
Table 2. The values of accuracies obtained on the Training set and the Validation set being so close
to each other suggests low variance and the high value of accuracy suggests low bias. So, our
COV-19Net gives almost impeccable results and can be thought of as an ideal model for use by
the medical practitioners for faster detection of COVID-19 positive patients from chest

Zhang et al. [25] achieved best sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 87.84% on their neural
network, Narin et al. [26] used transfer learning on a variety of models and achieved best mean
accuracy of 98% on ResNet50 model, and Apostolopoulos et al. [15] also employed transfer
learning and achieved best accuracy of 96.78% on VGG-19 network. To summarize, a comparison
of other existing models and the proposed COV- 19Net is shown in Table 3. From Table 3, it is
clear that the proposed COV-19Net outperforms all existing models and is a very reliable model
for COVID-19 detection. Along with the higher accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and F1 scores
than all existing models, the other advantages of the COV-19Net include that the model is an endto-end model that is there is no feature extraction or feature selection steps; the model uses more
widely available lung X-Ray images for predictions which is a more efficient method that RTPCR tests since enough test kits are not available for the rapidly growing population of COVID19 infected patients.

5. Conclusion and Future Work
In this research, we proposed the convolutional neural network COV-19Net as an effective
computer-aided diagnosis method for COVID-19 detection. Since this method uses chest X-ray
images for prediction and is an end-to-end system, this method is also more effective, which means
there are no feature extraction and/or selection steps. It is vital to quickly detect infected patients
to take necessary actions and preventive measures, and in the rapidly growing population of
infected patients, fighting the pandemic becomes particularly important. If more clinical data are
available, the COV-19Net model can be further verified and its effectiveness can be better judged.
We hope that our model has high accuracy and sensitivity, as well as cost-effective and fastimplemented procedures, so it can help society fight this pandemic and reduce suffering. In
addition, the model can also help clinicians detect the difference in X-rays between COVID-19
positive and COVID-19 negative patients and help them fight the virus. Our future work will focus
on collecting X-ray data from more patients and incorporating it into our model for better
performance.
