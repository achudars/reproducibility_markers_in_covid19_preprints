Abstract:

24

To explore the SARS-CoV-2 early pandemic in Algeria, a dataset comprising forty-three

25

genomes originating from SARS-CoV-2 sampled from Algeria and other countries worldwide,

26

from 24 December 2019 through 8 March 2020, of which, were thoroughly examined. While

27

performing a multi-component analysis regarding the Algerian outbreak, the toolkit of

28

phylogenetic, phylodynamic, haplotype analyses and genomic analysis were effectively

29

implemented. We estimated the TMRCA in reference to the Algerian pandemic and

30

highlighted both the introduction of the disease originating in France and the missing data

31

depicted in the transmission loop. Most importantly, we unveiled mutational patterns,

32

recombination events and the relatedness regarding the Algerian sequences to the dataset. Our

33

results revealed the unique amino-acid replacement L129F in the orf3a gene in

34

Algeria_EPI_ISL_418241. Additionally, a connection between Algeria_EPI_ISL_420037 and

35

sequences originating from the USA was observed through a USA characteristic amino-acid

36

replacement T1004I in the nsp3 gene, found in the aforementioned Algerian sequence. Lastly,

37

we assessed the Algerian mitigation measures regarding disease containment using statistical

38

analyses.

Author summary:

41

A novel human coronavirus, specifically SARS-CoV-2, emerged in China in late 2019. In

42

Algeria, the contact tracing revealed the introduction of the disease originated in France,

43

however, the intricate dynamics regarding the disease remain unexplored. In this study, we

44

attempt to portray our perspective regarding the evolutionary, genetic and epidemiological

45

aspects of the early pandemic in Algeria during the spring of 2020, through the use of time

46

scaled phylogeny, phylodynamic and mutational pattern characterization and exploration.

47

Additionally, we assessed the efficiency of the implemented mitigation measures using

48

statistical analysis. The results supported the virus introduction from France and highlighted

49

an Algerian characteristic amino-acid replacement in addition to a relatedness to the USA

50

sequences. Moreover, we revealed an indirect contamination among the three sampled patients.

51

Therefore, our analysis is a starting point for further investigations and emphasize the

52

importance regarding intensive sequencing and genome exploration for mitigation measures

53

implementation, and both drug and vaccine development.

Introduction:

56

Historically, the emergence of SARS /Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome dates back to 2002,

57

and MERS/the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome epidemic erupted in 2012. In late 2019, the

58

third highly pathogenic human coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan, China, as the

59

epicenter and cause of a pneumonia outbreak [1]. The novel virus was aptly identified as a

60

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 /SARS-CoV-2, and the primary cause of the

61

coronavirus disease 19/COVID-19 [2]. Owing to travel, it subsequently spread worldwide and

62

was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization/WHO, and today is considered a

63

major public health concern [3]. Similarly to MERS coronavirus and SARS coronavirus, the

64

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus and Sarbecovirus subgenus, and related to

65

SARS coronavirus with roughly 80% identity at the nucleotide level [1]. Moreover, it is likely

66

bat originated, whereas the intermediate host if any, remains blurred, despite different

67

hypotheses [4].

68

In Algeria, 25 February marks the first imported case and was registered in the southern

69

portion of the country, in which an Italian employee tested positive. This was well contained,

70

and no additional cases were reported until the beginning of March, which currently, is

71

considered as the onset of an outbreak in Blida in Northern Algeria, as two more cases were

72

recorded following a visiting family member from France [5]. In the present study, we aim to

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.19.20235135; this version posted November 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this

73

understand the dynamics associated with the transmission in reference to the first three

74

diagnosed cases in Blida, of which, is the epicenter of the pandemic in Algeria and further

75

characterize the identified Algerian SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Notably, this is of major

76

importance regarding disease containment and both vaccine and drug development. Therefore,

77

a dataset representing forty-one SARS-CoV-2 sequences comprising the three Algerian

78

sequences deposited and freely available from the GISAID database were analyzed. To

79

effectively manage the sequencing procedure, we employed the Beast v1.10.4 package for

80

evolutionary, phylodynamic, and phylogeographic investigations, and, additionally,

81

implemented POPART software to create a haplotype network analysis, to demonstrate

82

introductions, local transmissions, and to further understand the disease spread and evolution.

83

Additionally, both MEGA X and DnaSP v6.12.03 were used for further genome exploration.

84

The results emphasized the absence of recombination within our dataset. We noted a similarity

85

regarding the codon usage pattern across the Algerian sequences when compared with the

86

reference sequence. Similarly, a mutational heterogeneity in both the nucleotide and protein

87

levels across the Algerian genomes was clearly observed, highlighting both negative and

88

positive selection. Additionally, the present outcome undeniably supports the disease

89

introduction from France. However, it likely demonstrates a relationship to USA sequences

90

and distinctly, highlights how missing unsampled data linking the three diagnosed infections

91

were not a result of direct contamination among the three patients and implies undiagnosed

92

infections during the early stage of the outbreak.

Results:

95

Evolutionary phylogenetic, phylogeographic and phylodynamic analyses:

96

The resultant log files from both the strict and the lognormal uncorrelated relaxed clock

models were analyzed using the tracer. The posterior density regarding the lognormal standard

98

deviation excludes zero indicating no rate variation. Thus, the strict clock model was rejected

99

in favor of the relaxed clock model. The date of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of

100

the global pandemic and its 95% highest posterior density interval (HPD) was 17/12/2019

101

[2019-12-08, 2019-12-23] under the exponential growth tree prior. Whereas, it was 16/12/2019

102

[2019-12-02, 2019-12-23] when using the Bayesian skyline plot model. Similarly, the

103

estimated MRCA regarding the Algerian pandemic was 20/02/2020 [2020-02-13, 2020-02-27]

104

and 21/02/2020 [2020-02-15, 2020-02-28] under the respective aforementioned tree priors.

105

The SARS-CoV-2 estimated evolutionary rate was 0.001 [0.001 and 0.002] under both tree

106

priors.

107

Furthermore, based on the maximum clade credibility tree (MCC) (Fig 1), the three

108

Algerian sequences formed a monophyletic clade (Posterior probabilities: PP=1 and PP=0.99)

109

and were closely related to sequences from France (PP=0.99). Thus, indicating the disease

110

introduction originating from France and migrating to Algeria then spreading through local

111

transmissions. However, the Algerian sequence hCoV-19/Algeria/G0860_2262/2020 was

112

considered as an outgroup vis-à-vis hCoV-19/Algeria/G0640_2265/2020 and hCoV-

113

19/Algeria/G0638_2264/2020) implying missing sequences.

Likewise, phylogeographic analyses confirmed China as the origin of the pandemic

148

(Fig 2A). Moreover, while relying on the Bayesian stochastic search variable selection /BSSVS

149

and Bayes factor calculation, there was very strong supportive evidence mounting in support

150

of the disease introduction from France to Algeria, substantiated by a Bayes factor = 42.04

151

(Figs 2B and 2C). Overall, the route depicting its global spread was first demonstrated to have

the lowest to its highest value, respectively.

175

To obtain an overview regarding the demographic history within the dataset, we relayed

176

to both parametric and non-parametric models, respectively. The exponential growth model

177

demonstrated an increase in reference to the population size with a growth rate estimation of

178

0.06/day and a 95% HPD interval of [0.03, 0.09], thus the doubling time was predicted to be

179

11.7 days (Fig 3A). From another perspective, the skyline plot model displayed a logistic

180

growth with a plateau phase beginning 15 February (Fig 3B).

Genome analyses:

198

Based on p-distance pairwise calculations within and among the various groups defined

199

by sequence locations, the Algerian sequences group exhibited a mean genetic distance of

200

0.01% (SE=0.0001). Notably, nucleotide divergence among sequences from different locations

201

ranged between 0.02% and 0.05%. The lowest divergence was observed among the Algerian

202

sequences and, also sequences originating from France, Czech Republic, Netherlands, and

203

South Africa (SE=0.001). In contrast, the Algerian sequences and sequences originating from

204

the USA, Canada, and Saudi Arabia exhibited the highest divergence (0.05%, SE=0.0001)

205

(Table S1).

206

Moreover, codon usage pattern analysis pertaining to the compositional characteristics

207

in the Reference sequence and the Algerian sequences demonstrated the value of overall G+C

208

content in ORF1b and S genes is 37%, while in ORF1a and E genes is 38%, the higher values

209

are observed in M and N genes with 43% and 47%, respectively. However, the lowest value

210

representative of the GC content in the second codon position (G+C2) was observed in the E

211

gene (33%), and the maximum percentage in the N gene (50%). Whereas the minimum

212

estimation of the GC composition in the third codon position (G+C3) was discovered in the

213

ORF1b gene (24%) and the greatest proportion in both M and N genes (36%). Hence, the

214

viruses used more AT% over GC%. The effective number of codons (ENC) values within the

215

aforementioned genes ranged between 42.11 and 54.65 indicating a weakened codon bias.

216

Similarly, the codon bias index (CBI) values varied between 0.36-0.40 and were in accordance

217

with ENC results. Additionally, P values ≧ 0.05 were in favor of the null hypothesis assuming

218

no codon bias (Table 1).

221

Additionally, the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analyses exhibited a

222

similar pattern within both the reference sequence and the Algerian sequences with slight

223

differences in the values. Overall, A3s and T3s were the most frequent nucleotides in the

224

preferred codons and the least recurrent in the underrepresented ones among all investigated

225

genes. In the ORF1a gene, among the twenty-six preferred codons, seventeen resulted with U

226

while eight were A-ending and only one was G-ending. In consideration of the ORF1b gene,

227

out of the twenty-seven preferred codons, sixteen were U-ending and eleven A-ending.

228

Likewise, for the S gene, twenty-seven overrepresented codons englobed sixteen U-ending,

229

nine A-ending and two G-ending. Similarly, sixteen overrepresented codons were observed in

230

the E gene, eight counted as U-ending, five A-ending, two C-ending, and only one ended with

231

a G. The M gene had twenty-three preferred codons comprising nine U-ending, eight A-ending

232

five C-ending, and one G-ending. Lastly, regarding the N gene, twenty-five preferred codons

233

were identified resulting in eleven U-ending, eight A-ending, five C-ending and one G-ending

234

(Fig 4 and Tables S2-5).

274

Thereafter, pairwise Ka and Ks values were calculated representative of each gene.

275

Only the Algerian and reference sequence data are depicted in Table S6. In the ORF1a gene,

276

Ka/Ks ratios among each Algerian sequence and the reference sequence was < 1, indicating a

277

purifying selection. Notably, when there is no variation (Ka=Ks=0), the (ω) ratio cannot be

278

calculated (Algeria_EPI_ISL_418241 and Algeria_EPI_ISL_418242). Additionally, an

279

infinite value was observed when Ks=0 and Ka>Ks (Algeria_EPI_ISL_418241 and

280

Algeria_EPI_ISL_420037) which likely is in favor of a positive selection. In parallel, in

281

consideration of the ORF1b gene, positive selection was observed in all sequence pairs except

282

Algeria_EPI_ISL_418241 and Algeria_EPI_ISL_418242, in which the ratio was not

283

calculable. Across the S gene, a positive selection was found when comparing the Algerian

284

sequences to the reference sequence while the ka/ks ratio was not computable in the pairwise

285

comparison regarding the comprehensive Algerian sequences. Similarly, in reference to the E

286

gene, in which a positive selection was perceived when comparing Algeria_EPI_ISL_418241

287

to Algeria_EPI_ISL_418242, and Algeria_EPI_ISL_420037 to the reference sequence,

288

whereas the Ka/Ks ratio was impossible to calculate in the remaining pairwise comparison. In

289

consideration of the reliance to Ka and Ks values (ka=ks=0), a neutral evolution was observed

290

in the M gene. However, the N gene exhibited a strong negative selection for all sequence pairs

291

except in the cases of Algeria_EPI_ISL_418241 and Algeria_EPI_ISL_418242, including

292

Algeria_EPI_ISL_418242 and the reference sequence where ka=ks=0.

294

Hereafter, based on Rambaut et al genome lineage attribution, the Algerian sequences

295

fall within the lineage B1, together with the French sequences [6]. Additionally, both amino

296

acid replacements and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for each sequence compared to

297

the reference sequence (NCBI RefSeq NC_045512) are summarized in Table 2. Strikingly, in

Linkage disequilibrium:

Recombination is characterized by a negative correlation between the distances among SNPs

and the LD measures (D' and r2). When plotting both the squared coefficient of correlation r2

310

and the normalized linkage disequilibrium coefficient D' versus the distance between the

311

polymorphic sites calculated in bases, no clear pattern of LD decay was observed (Fig 5A and

312

relationship was performed. The Pearson correlation coefficient between D' and the distance

314

was -0.01 and a coefficient of determination R2=0.0001, while between r2 versus the distance,

315

the correlation coefficient was equal to -0.005 and R2=0.002. Furthermore, distances between

316

sites in perfect LD (|D'|=1 and r2 >0.8) ranged between 1 and 26,409 bases, emphasizing the

317

independence regarding the LD from the distance (Table S7). All results exclude

318

recombination among SARS-CoV-2 studied genomes.

Discussion:

396

To investigate the early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Algeria, we performed a thorough

397

analysis of forty-one SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes comprising all available Algerian

398

sequences (n=3), in addition to sequences from France (n=6), Belgium (n=2), South Africa

399

(n=1), Netherlands (n=1), Czech Republic (n=1), Spain (n=3), Italy (n=2), Argentina (n=1),

400

India (n=1), Switzerland (n=1), Austria (n=1), USA (n=3), Portugal (n=1), Germany (n=2),

401

Canada (n=1), Australia (n=3), Pakistan (n=1), Saudi Arabia (n=1), England (n=1), China

402

(n=4) and Thailand (n=1).

403

Our estimations regarding the TMRCA of the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic under a

404

relaxed molecular clock with both the exponential growth and the skyline plot tree priors were

405

in accordance with anterior studies performed on smaller or bigger datasets, since they are

406

encompassed within their 95% HPD [7,8]. Similarly, the resultant TMRCA dates of the

407

Algerian pandemic under the aforementioned tree priors, respectively, were estimated to

408

20/02/2020 [2020-02-13, 2020-02-27] and 21/02/2020 [2020-02-15, 2020-02-28]. These

409

results are coherent, as the restriction measures in Algeria began from mid-March [5]. The

410

evolutionary rate of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the present study was equal to 0.001

411

substitution/site/year which is the exact substitution rate reported previously early in the

412

pandemic [2,9].

413

In parallel, both the phylogenetic and the phylogeographic analyses supported the

414

disease first originating in France and shortly thereafter migrating to Algeria, (PP=0.9 and

415

BF=42.04) as previously demonstrated through contact tracing [5]. Interestingly, areas in

416

which missing data was clearly obvious was made apparent through phylogenetic

417

reconstruction. Moreover, the phylogeographic analysis highlighted the route of spread

418

regarding the pandemic originating from the epicenter, China, throughout Asia, then onto

419

Europe and finally to Africa. Despite the small size of the dataset, it is in accordance with the

420

large SARS-CoV-2 phylogeographic analysis performed in Nextstrain [10].

421

Additionally, the phylodynamic analyses revealed a growth factor of 0.06/day

422

(23.9/year) resulting in a doubling time of 11.6 days which is aligned with similar estimates

423

performed early in the pandemic [11,12]. Moreover, the Bayesian skyline plot revealed a

424

logistic growth regarding the effective population size in the early pandemic (from 24

425

December up through the 8 March). This may likely be justified, since, at the beginning of this

426

time-lapse, only a few sequences were uploaded to the GISAID database. Moreover, at this

427

stage, the disease qualified as an Wuhan outbreak, and not many genomes were sequenced

428

worldwide [13,14]. From mid-January up through mid-February, more sequences were

429

available from China and only minute sequences from other countries. Inexplicably, very few

430

genomes were accessible, whether from China nor from the rest of the world in the waning two

431

weeks of February. This period represented the silent global spread of SARS-CoV-2 including

432

Algeria, since asymptomatic individuals were not considered regarding sampling [15].

433

Overall, The Algerian SARS-CoV-2 sequences displayed a lower genetic diversity with

434

genomes from different geographic origins revealing little differentiation. The same results

435

were observed in a recent study among 18,514 sequences including the Algerian genomes [16].

436

Furthermore, when comparing the Algerian sequences to the reference sequence, the codon

437

bias analysis revealed very similar results amid the forgoing genomes. Low GC values were

438

observed in all investigated genes (ORF1a, ORF1b, M, N, S and E), whether in the global

439

composition or both the second and the third codon positions. Moreover, ENC values in

440

different genes ranged between 42.11 and 54.65, whereas CBI estimates fluctuated between

441

0.37 and 0.58, thus, indicating the potential bias regarding slight codon usage. These results

442

are aligned with anterior studies performed on SARS-CoV in the same context implying a low

443

bias regarding codon usage among RNA viruses with little variation between genes due to their

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.19.20235135; this version posted November 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this

444

high mutation rate [17]. From another viewpoint, the RSCU pattern across the Algerian and

445

the reference genomes were very similar with slight differences regarding the values in all

446

genes, in addition to a preference for U-ending codons in the overrepresented codons. Once

447

more, as per anterior reported studies regarding the SARS-CoV-2 codon usage, the pattern is

448

more or less conserved independently from the geographical provenance [18,19]. Globally, the

449

ω ratio across all genes was often times either impossible to calculate (ka=ks=0) or had extreme

450

values (∞ when ks=0 and 0 when ka=0), of which is due to insufficient nucleotide variations

451

characteristic in the early phase of the pandemic [12,20]. Moreover, the small data panel of the

452

Algerian sequences (n=3) is a drawback regarding the comprehension of the selection pressure

453

pattern within Algeria, of which, is an important implication in diagnostics, therapy, and

454

vaccine development. In view of the fact in which Algeria was under complete travel

455

restrictions since the 15 March, the number of cases kept increasing, indicating local

456

transmissions, thus these local viral variants may potentially represent a distinct strain [21].

457

Complementary to this, several common non-synonymous mutations were detected

458

among the Algerian sequences and the related French sequences. This included T85I in the

459

nsp2 gene, P423L in the nsp12 gene, D614G in the S gene, and Q57H in the ORF3a gene.

460

Notably, these mutations were detected within eighty-four countries and thus considered as

461

positively selected [22–24]. Interestingly, unique non-synonymous mutations were detected.

462

To cite and example, T1004I replacement in the nsp3 gene was detected in the sequence

463

Algeria_EPI_ISL_420037. This mutation was spotted as a unique mutation in the USA in the

464

early stages of the pandemic, sequences from 19 January to 15 April, and was not reported

465

elsewhere. Since we know three Algerian sequences were derived from locals without any

466

travel history, we can conclude the individual who contaminated Algeria_EPI_ISL_420037

467

had either a travel history to the USA or was in close contact with an individual who introduced

468

the disease to France originating from the USA [25]. Strikingly, in Algeria, _EPI_ISL_418241,

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.19.20235135; this version posted November 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this

469

H26Y, L129F, and L73F mutations were identified in nsp14, ORF3a and E genes, respectively.

470

According to a recent study regarding SARS-CoV-2 mutations, the H26Y mutation was

471

defined as a low-frequency non-synonymous mutation of a second phase infection (sequences

472

between 18 April – 17 May), nevertheless, it was detected in our sequence sampled on the 2

473

March. Moreover, the L129F non-synonymous mutation in the ORF3a gene was proven to be

474

characteristic only in reference to our Algerian sequence among 2,782 analyzed sequences and

475

is considered under negative selection [26]. Additionally, L73F amino acid replacement was

476

revealed in the E gene, in which this mutation was reported in Australia and consequently, is

477

the alteration of the DLLV motif (change to DFLV). Distinctly, it may delay Tight Junction

478

formation and therefore may hypothetically affect viral replication and/or infectivity [27].

479

Notably, only the sequence Algeria_EPI_ISL_418242 exhibited an identical

480

mutational pattern regarding the protein level when compared with the related French

481

sequences (identical to EPI_ISL_437689 and EPI_ISL_416498). Furthermore, the haplotype

482

network analysis was in accordance with the aforementioned results and displayed a median

483

vector between both the Algerian and the French sequences, in addition to the two Algerian

484

sequences Algeria_EPI_ISL_420037 and Algeria_EPI_ISL_418242, indicating unsampled

485

data. This conformed to a French study on tracing the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to France,

486

which included all the French sequences and the Algerian sequences. We observed how

487

Algeria_EPI_ISL_420037 didn’t cluster with the two other Algerian sequences. Moreover, the

488

branch length which was proportional to nucleotide substitution indicated clearly unsampled

489

data between Algeria_EPI_ISL_418242 and Algeria_EPI_ISL_418241 [28]. Unsurprisingly,

490

the three Algerian sequences were classified in the B.1 lineage which is the common circulating

491

virus in both Europe (France) and North America (USA) [29].

492

Among these findings, our results supporting the absence of recombination among

493

SARS-CoV-2 in the early phase of the pandemic and are in accordance with a previous study

494

performed on 37566 SARS-CoV-2 sequences [30]. However, VanInsberghe and colleagues

495

were able to detect five putative recombinant genomes among 47,390 unique sequences,

496

despite the low recombination percentage (0.007%), thus, providing evidence regarding the

497

increase of recombination possibilities in parallel to the pandemic expansion [31].

498

In the present study, we demonstrated the evolution representing the Algerian pandemic

499

in a consistent manner reflecting the effectiveness of varied implemented measures. Moreover,

500

the moderate correlation between the number of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases and the

501

population density in each Algerian city implies the spread of the virus is primarily dependent

502

on the awareness of the community and the respectful compliance regarding social distancing,

503

as lower infection cases in relatively high population density cities were observed and vice-

504

versa. To cite an illustration, Adrar, a city located in the southern portion of Algeria, has a

505

population density of 1.03 habitant/km2 and as of 27 July, the number of confirmed cases is

506

350, whereasas, in Jijel, situated in the Northern area of Algeria, the number of confirmed cases

507

is 246 cases for 265.5 habitant/km2. This is complementary to an epidemiological study

508

conducted to assess the mitigation measures implemented in Algeria in the early SARS-CoV-

509

2 pandemic (dated 26 April), which demonstrated the efficiency based on the basic

510

reproduction number R0 before and after the implementation of the preventive strategy [5].

511

Overall, we explored the evolution, genetic, and the epidemiological aspects regarding

512

the Algerian SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase of the pandemic, aptly demonstrating the

513

introduction of the disease and the heterogeneity of the genomes. Additionally, our research

514

findings revealed a unique amino-acid substitution and a closeness to USA sequences by

515

characterizing the mutational pattern. Statistically, we assessed the effectiveness regarding the

516

mitigation majors implemented against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Admittedly, the main

517

drawback regarding our study was the size of the Algerian data panel. Thus, we emphasized

the importance of massive sampling and sequencing in disease comprehension and increased

519

efforts regarding drug and vaccine development.

520
521

Materials and methods:

522

Sequence selection and maximum likelihood phylogeny:

523

Forty-one sequences originating from the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic including the three

524

Algerian genomes were retrieved from the GISAID database [13,32]. All data samples were

525

acquired and prepared prior to 8 March 2020, which is the latest collection date in reference to

526

the Algerian sample (Table S8). Therefore, sequences were aligned by MAFFT using default

527

parameters [33]. Subsequently, a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was implemented in

528

IQTREE webserver, under the HYK+G4 substitution model, with ultrafast bootstrapping [34,

529

35] .

530
531

Temporal

532

Phylogeographic analysis in discrete space:

533

To effectively assess the clock-likeliness regarding the data, the aforementioned maximum

534

likelihood resultant tree was used as an input file in TempEst [36]. A regression analysis of

535

root-to-tip genetic distance against sampling time demonstrated a strong positive

536

correlation/correlation coefficient= 0.76 while a moderate association was observed /R2=0.57,

537

indicating the suitability of the dataset for a phylogenetic molecular clock analysis.

538

Subsequently, the tip dated phylogenetic tree was generated using the Beast v1.10.4 package

539

and employing the HKY+G4 substitution model. Moreover, both strict and lognormal

540

uncorrelated relaxed clock models were tested [37, 38]. In consideration of population size and

541

growth, the parametric coalescent exponential growth model assuming an exponential increase

542

543

population sizes for each coalescent interval was applied as priors [39, 40]. To estimate both

544

the MRCA of the Algerian sequences including the time stretching back to the Algeria MRCA

545

/TMRCA, a taxon set comprising the Algerian sequences was created. The MCMC chains were

546

operational for 100 million generations and sampled every 10,000 generations, with 10%

547

discarded as burn-in. Subsequently, the effective sampling sizes /ESS>200 were examined

548

using TRACER v1.6.0 [41]. In parallel, the date of the most recent common ancestor/MRCA

549

regarding the pandemic in addition to the evolutionary rate was estimated. Furthermore, the

550

Maximum clade credibility tree/MCC was annotated by means of TreeAnnotator v1.10.4 and

551

visualized in FigTree v1.4.4 [21]. Additionally, a phylogeographic analysis was performed.

552

The samples’ spatial data/location of isolation was used to infer the geographical spreading

553

patterns of the virus by combining the Bayesian stochastic search variable selection/BSSVS

554

with a standard symmetric substitution implemented using Beast v1.10.4. [42]. Thereafter, the

555

MCC tree was loaded in SpreaD3 v0.9.7 to visualize and analyze the transmission routes, and

556

the log file to calculate the Bayes Factor/BF [43].

557
558

Genome investigations:

559

MEGA X was first used to calculate the pairwise genetic distances employing the p distance

560

parameter [44]. Subsequently, the DnaSP v6.12.03 package was applied in reference to further

561

genome exploration, beginning with polymorphic region assessment. Furthermore, the

562

presence of insertions or deletions (InDels) was estimated based on the diallelic model.

563

Thereafter, for each of the following genes: ORF1a, ORF1b, S, E, M, N, several indices of

564

codon usage bias were calculated, comprising the frequency of the nucleotides G+C at the

565

second and third position (G+C2, G+C3s) and the GC contents in the coding region (G+Cc).

566

the effective number of codons (ENC) used to measure the degree of the codon usage bias. The

567

ENC values range from twenty (when only one codon is used for each amino acid) to sixty-

568

one (when all synonymous codons are used for each corresponding amino acid). Generally, a

569

significant codon usage bias in a coding region is indicated by an ENC value less than or equal

570

to 35 [45]. Codon Bias Index (CBI) was used to estimate the codon usage bias based on the

571

fraction of preferred codons used in a gene, and its values range from zero (uniform use of

572

synonymous codons) to one (only preferred codons are used) [46]. Additionally, the relative

573

synonymous codon usage (RSCU) evaluating the ratio of the observed frequency to the

574

expected one for each codon assuming all codons for a particular amino acid are used equally.

575

An RSCU value <1.0 represents a negative codon usage bias while RSCU >1.0 implies a

576

positive bias, and a value equal to one is interpreted as no bias. To assess the significance of

577

the codon usage bias, a scaled chi-square test (SChi2) was performed. Only the results of the

578

SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence and the Algerian sequences were reported. Likewise, to

579

assess the selective pressure at the protein level, (ω) the ratio of the non-synonymous mutation

580

rate (Ka) to the synonymous mutations (Ks) was evaluated within each gene for each sequence

581

pair according to Nei and Gojobori [30,47]. When several nonsynonymous mutations which

582

promote changes with physiochemically different amino acids occur, they show a tendency to

583

be deleterious to the protein, and thus they are improbable to become fixed in the population

584

leading to a negative selection resulting in Ka<Ks (ω<1). Contrariwise, when advantageous

585

nonsynonymous substitutions strike, they are likely to become fixed in the population, and thus

586

amino acid changes in the protein are enhanced (ω>1). Thereafter, linkage disequilibrium

587

between nucleotide variants was estimated. All polymorphic sites were analyzed to test the

588

recombination among SARS-CoV-2 genomes within the dataset. The linkage disequilibrium

589

(LD) decay signal which is a recombination characteristic was examined. When recombination

590

occurs, it will disrupt linkage between SNPs, the more distant SNPs will be affected faster and

591

the significance of the results was based on Both the two-tailed Fisher's exact test and the chi-

592

square test with Bonferroni correction (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001) [48, 49].

Lastly, we subjugated the Algerian sequences and three different French sequences selected

594

based on an ulterior study conducted by Gámbaro and colleagues to the CoV-GLUE webserver

595

to highlight the differences among them and the related French sequences and further to reveal

596

the lineage of the Algerian genomes and the amino-acid variations [6, 28 ,50].

597
598

Haplotype network analysis:

599

Prior to haplotype network analysis, RDP 4 software was used for recombination detection,

600

thus, the median-joining network method implemented in POPART software was employed

601

with default setting/epsilon=0 [51–53].

602
603

Epidemiological analysis and preventive measures assessment:

604

In summary, to draft an overview encapsulating the evolution of the pandemic in Algeria, the

605

cumulative number of the infected recovered and death cases were collected from the Johns

606

Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (27 July 2020) [54].

607

Subsequently, the linear, exponential, and the logarithmic trend lines were compared, and the

608

best model was chosen based on the R2 values. Furthermore, the cumulative confirmed cases

609

for each of the forty-eight Algerian cities were collected from the official Algerian ministry of

610

health website [55]. Additionally, the population density data regarding all Algerian cities was

611

retrieved from the Wikipedia website [56]. Thereafter, the correlation coefficient was

612

calculated between the density and the number of confirmed cases.
