Abstract
Background: Severe patients with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia progressed
rapidly to acute respiratory failure. We aimed to evaluate the definite efficacy and safety of
corticosteroid in the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia.
Methods: Forty-six hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia hospitalized at
Wuhan Union Hospital from January 20 to February 25, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed.
The patients were divided into two groups based on whether they received corticosteroid
treatment. The clinical symptoms and chest computed tomography(CT) results were compared.
Results: A total of 26 patients received intravenous administration of methylprednisolone with
a dosage of 1-2mg/kg/d for 5-7 days, while the remaining patients not. There was no significant
difference in age, sex, comorbidities, clinical or laboratory parameters between the two groups
on admission. The average number of days for body temperature back to the normal range was
significantly shorter in patients with administration of methylprednisolone when compared to
those without administration of methylprednisolone (2.06±0.28 vs. 5.29±0.70, P=0.010). The
patients with administration of methylprednisolone had a faster improvement of SpO2, while
patients without administration of methylprednisolone had a significantly longer interval of
using supplemental oxygen therapy (8.2days[IQR 7.0-10.3] vs. 13.5days(IQR 10.3-16); P<0.001).
In terms of chest CT, the absorption degree of the focus was significantly better in patients with
administration of methylprednisolone.
Conclusion: Our data indicate that in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early, lowdose and short-term application of corticosteroid was associated with a faster improvement of
clinical symptoms and absorption of lung focus.

Introduction
Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in late December 2019,
originating in Wuhan, China and then transmitted in Hubei Province, throughout China and
even other countries[1,2]. This ongoing outbreak has already been declared by World Health
Organization(WHO) as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). As of
February 28, there are 78,824 confirmed cases, 7,952 severe cases and 2,788 confirmed deaths
across China[3]. COVID-19 is a beta-coronavirus, presenting as viral pneumonia with high
infectiousness through respiratory droplets or direct contact and appears to have greater
infectivity and a lower-case fatality rate when compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome(MERS)[4,5]. Moreover, the pathological
features of COVID-19 pneumonia greatly resemble those seen in SARS and MERS, and show
diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, desquamation of pneumocytes and
hyaline membrane formation, indicating acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS)[6].
Corticosteroid are widely used as therapy for ARDS and have been used to treat SARS with
proof of efficacy, which could significantly decrease the mortality of severe SARS patients[7,8].
However, there is no evidence-based medical evidence to confirm the definite efficacy and
safety of corticosteroid in the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. To address this issue,
we have performed a retrospective study on the clinical and radiographic outcomes of
treatment with or without corticosteroid for a cohort of patients with severe COVID-19
pneumonia.

Patients and methods
We studied patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia from January 20 to February 25,
2020 at the isolation ward of Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
Union Hospital is sentinel general hospital located in the endemic areas of COVID-19 in Wuhan,
Hubei Province, and is designated by the government for the treatments of COVID-19 infection.
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong

University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. Verbal consent was obtained from
patients before the enrollment.
Diagnosis of 2019-nCoV pneumonia in this study were diagnosed according to the WHO
interim guideline[9]. Throat swab sample of the patients was collected and COVID-19 was
confirmed by real-time RT-PCR assay using a 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection kit according to
the manufacturer protocol (Shanghai bio-germ Medical Technology Co Ltd)[10]. The clinical
classification according to the coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan (trial
version 5) developed by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China, and
those meet any of the followings were diagnosed as severe case: (1) respiratory distress,
respiratory rate per min≥30; (2) in the resting state, means oxygen saturation≤93%; (3) arterial
blood oxygen partial pressure/oxygen concentration≤300mmHg (1mmHg = 0.133kPa). (4) other
conditions such as older than 60 years, with complication of hypertension, diabetes, coronary
disease, cancer, pulmonary heart disease, structural lung disease and immunosuppressed
individuals.
The demographic characteristics, comorbidities, symptoms, clinical parameters, laboratory
indexes and chest computed tomographic (CT) scan findings were extracted from electronic
medical records. The vital signs of the patients (temperature, heart rate, blood pressure,
respiratory frequency and oxygen saturation [SpO2]) were monitored daily; The blood tests
(complete blood count, liver and renal function, C-reactive protein, Inflammatory factors and
lactate dehydrogenase) were examined every 3 days; The chest CT scan was performed every
7-10 days. Assessment criteria of this study was the dynamic changes of the indexes mentioned
above.
The Statistical Packages for Social Sciences, version 19.0 (SPSS) were used for data analysis
with P < 0.05 as the criterion for significance. Continuous variables were reported as means and
standard deviations, or medians and interquartile range (IQR) values. Categorical variables were
reported as counts and percentages. Continuous variables were compared using Student’s ttests, Mann-Whitney U test and categorical variables were compared using Fisher’s exact tests.

Results
A total of 46 hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were diagnosed and
included in this study, the age, sex, comorbidities, clinical and laboratory parameters on
admission for the are shown in Table 1. Their average age was 54 years (IQR 48-64), and 26
(57%) were males. Of these patients, 18 (32.1%) had at least one of the following underlying
disorders: hypertension (14[30.8%]), diabetes (4[8.7%]), cardiovascular disease (6[13.0%]),
Chronic pulmonary disease(3[6.5%]), cerebrovascular disease(2[4.3%]), and malignancy
(2[4.3%]). The median and interquartile range of the main clinical and laboratory parameters
are as following: body temperature 37℃(36.8,38.4) ℃, heart rate 86bpm (74,96), BP
132(121,141)/77(70,85)mmHg, respiratory frequency 26bpm(21,31), SpO2 at rest 91% (86,92),
and white blood cell(WBC) 7.74(5.24,9.96) G/L, neutrophil(PMN) 5.53(3.85,7.87) G/L,
lymphocyte(LYM) 0.86(0.58,1.15) G/L, C-reactive protein(CPR) 61.5(14.4,109.9) mg/L,
procalcitonin(PCT) 0.55(0.14,1.09) mg/L, interleukin-2(IL-2) 2.77(2.32,3.55) pg/ml, interleukin4(IL-4) 2.17(1.87,2.61) pg/ml, interleukin-6(IL-6) 18.4(10.4,53.0) pg/ml, interleukin-10(IL-10)
6.7(3.9,8.1) pg/ml and ferroprotein(FER) 787(300,1057) µg/L. Three(5.4%) patients died during
the hospitalization: a 89 years old man with the end stage of prostate cancer died because of
multiple organ failure; a 51 years old woman with diabetic foot and gangrene died at 2 days
after the amputation surgery; a 49 years old man died of respiratory failure. All of the other 43
patients were successfully cured and discharged.
Oxygen therapy, antiviral therapy(a-interferon, Kaletra[lopinavir/ritonavir]),
immunoenhancement therapy (thymosin), prevention of bacterial infection, relieving cough
eliminating phlegm and nutritional support were commonly used for all of the 46 patients;
while, 26 of them received extra low-dose methylprednisolone treatment with the dosage of 12mg/kg/d for 5-7 days via intravenous injection. The specific dosage and duration of
methylprednisolone for the patients were determined according to the clinical manifestations,
leucocyte count, lymphocyte count, inflammatory index and lesion range. There was no
significant difference of age, sex, comorbidities, clinical or laboratory parameters between
patients with and without methylprednisolone administration(Table 1). Among the 3 deaths, 2

happened in the patients with methylprednisolone administration and the other one did not
receive methylprednisolone treatment.
Among the 46 patients, 27 patients suffered from fever(≥37.3℃) on admission, and 15
patients received methylprednisolone therapy, while the remaining patients not. The dynamic
change of the body temperature for the 27 patients was shown in Figure 1A. The number and
percentage of the patients whose body temperature decreased to the normal range on
different day from treatment beginning was reported as follows(methylprednisolone therapy
vs. no methylprednisolone therapy ): day 2, 7(46.7%) vs.2(16.7%); day 3, 13(86.7%) vs.4(33.4%);
day 4, 13(86.7%) vs.5(41.7%); day 5, 14(93.3%) vs.7(58.3%); day 6, 15(100%) vs.9(75%); day 7,
15(100%) vs.7(58.3%); day 8, 15(100%) vs.10(83.3%); day 9, 15(100%) vs.12(100%); The average
number of days required for no fever was significant shorter in the patients with
methylprednisolone therapy (2.06±0.28 vs. 4.39±0.70, P=0.010, Figure 1B).
The median of SpO2 at rest was similar between patients with and without
methylprednisolone therapy on admission. Due to the low SpO2, all of the 46 patients received
oxygen therapy. The daily SpO2 of each patient was shown in Figure 2A. The average SpO2 of
every day was compared between patients with and without methylprednisolone therapy, as
shown in Figure 3B, the methylprednisolone therapy group had a faster improvement of SpO2:
day 2, 11(42.3%) vs.4(20.0%); day 3, 17(65.4%) vs.4(20.0%); day 4, 16(61.5%) vs.4(20.0%); day 5,
18(69.2%) vs.7(35.0%); day 6, 22(84.6%) vs.12(60%); day 7, 25(96.2%) vs.14(70.0%); Moreover,
patients without methylprednisolone therapy had significantly longer interval of using
supplemental oxygen therapy than those with methylprednisolone therapy (8.2days[IQR 7.010.3] vs. 13.5days(IQR 10.3-16); P<0.001).
The main laboratory parameters had similar trends between patients with and without
methylprednisolone therapy during the hospitalization. The WBC, PMN, LYM, CPR, PCT 0.55, IL2,IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 were not significantly different between the two groups on day 6 after the
treatment (Table 2). However, in terms of chest CT scan on day 7 and 14, we found the
absorption degree of the focus was significantly better in the patients with methylprednisolone
(Figure 4).

Discussion
The pathological process of severe COVID-19 pneumonia is the inflammation reaction
characterized by destruction of deep airway and alveolar[6]. It is currently considered that the
lung injury is not only associated with direct virus-induced injury, but also COVID-19 invasion
triggers the immune responses that lead to the activation of immune cells(monocyte,
macrophage, T and B-lymphocyte) to release a large number of pro- and anti-inflammatory
cytokines including TNF, IL-1β, IL-6 and so on. Overwhelming secretion of cytokines causes
severe lung damage, which manifest as extensive damage of pulmonary vascular endothelial
and alveolar epithelial cells as well as increased pulmonary vascular permeability, leading to the
pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation[11,12]. Histologic examination has shown
diffuse alveolar damage and mucinous exudate, which similar to acute respiratory distress
syndrome[6].
For the patients of severe COVID-19 pneumonia, aggravation of symptoms always occurs
during 5-7 days after onset[13]. Therefore, it is important to strengthen the treatment for
suppression of pro-inflammatory response and control of cytokine storm at this stage. A
majority of patients can survival and recover if they overcome this period. Corticosteroid are
the classical immunosuppressive drugs, which are important to stop or delay the progression of
the pneumonia and have been proved to be effective for treatment of ARDS[14,15]. In addition
to immunosuppressive activities, corticosteroid have an anti-inflammatory role to reduce
systemic inflammatory, decrease exudative fluid in the lung tissue, promote absorption of
inflammasome and prevent further diffuse alveolar damage, which can relieve hypoxemia and
effectively protect the lung to prevent further progression of respiratory insufficiency[16].
Meanwhile, corticosteroid can induce a decrease in body temperature and help alleviate the
poisoning symptom caused by hyperthermia.
In the present study, the patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia had markedly
increased inflammatory markers such as CRP, IL-6 and FER, which signified occurrence of the
inflammatory reaction phase. Meanwhile, most patients developed fever, cough, dyspnea and
markedly decline in oxygen saturation, which are the early clinical manifestations of ARDS.

Based on these, we believed there was the indictor for corticosteroid admission to treat these
patients. Judging from the results, early application of low-dose corticosteroid could improve
the treatment effect, presenting as improvement of hypoxia and fever symptom, shorten the
disease course, and accelerating focus absorption. Benefited from condition monitoring and
refined management, no serious complications caused by corticosteroid happened in these
patients.
In addition to the timing of treatment, it is also important to master the treatment
duration and choose appropriate corticosteroid formulations and dosage. The basic principles
of corticosteroid formulations selection lie in the following two aspects: a short half-life and
strong penetrating ability. The corticosteroid formulation used in our cohort was
methylprednisolone, a median effect corticosteroid with a half-life of 12-36, which has been
proved to be associated with a better intensity of immunosuppression[17]. In our experience,
the dosage, duration and route of methylprednisolone administration was 1-2mg/kg/d for 5-7
days via intravenous injection. Nevertheless, the specific dosage and duration for individual
patient was determined on the clinical manifestations, leucocyte and lymphocyte count,
inflammatory index and lesion range.
Corticosteroid treatment-induced complications is the other main concern. The most
common complication caused by corticosteroid is secondary infection(fungi and bacteria)[18].
In our experience, once the secondary infection occurs in patients with severe COVID-19
pneumonia, sensitive and full-dose antibacterial drugs should be immediately added. The
majority of patients are prone to secondary bacterial infection due to exudate accumulation in
the lungs, that push the prophylactic use of antibiotics such as moxifloxacin, levofloxacin and
cephalosporins. Secondly, the use of immune regulators(human immunoglobulin) can enhance
the immune function of the patients. In our experience, human immunoglobulin was usually
used in the critical patients with a dosage of 10-20 g/d for 7-10 days as the pulse therapy.
Thirdly, thymosin secreted by thymic epithelial cells can promote the maturation of Tlymphocytes and regulate function of cellular immunity. We suggest using thymosin during
hospitalization and the course of treatment can be determined according to the results of
lymphocyte test. Fourthly, ensure adequate caloric, protein and vitamins intake and maintain

the electrolyte and acid–base balance. The other common complication is hyperglycemia[19];
therefore, continual blood glucose monitoring is recommended, and antidiabetic agents
should be used when necessary. The uncommon complications caused by corticosteroid are
gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, venous thrombosis, hypokalemia and so on, all of these
should be paid attention by us[20]. The prudent use of corticosteroid and preventive measure
are essential to prevent deterioration in elder patients with these comorbidities.
This study has several limitations. First, the study was a retrospective single center
observational research with a small size and no external validation cohort, therefore,
unmeasured confounders may influence the accuracy of the results. Secondly, the study has not
included the mid- and long-term outcome of the cohort after discharge, and continued followup observation was needed.
In conclusion, our data indicate that in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early,
low-dose and short-term application of corticosteroid was associated with a faster
improvement of clinical symptoms and absorption of lung focus.
