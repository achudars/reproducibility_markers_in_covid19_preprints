Abstract
Due to its excessively high capacity for human-to-human transmission, the 2019 novel

coronavirus disease (COVID-19), first reported in Wuhan in China, spread rapidly to the

entire nation and beyond, and has now been declared a global public health emergency.

Understanding the transmission pattern of the virus and the efficacy of transmission

control measures is crucial to ensuring regional and global disease control. Here we
propose a simple model based on exponential infectious growth, but with a time-

varying, largely damping, transmission rate. This model provides an excellent fit to the

existing data from the 102 countries and regions which have reported cases for more

than 6 days, and, we think, has largely captured the transmission patterns of the COVID-

19 outbreak under a variety of intervention and control measures. We found that the

damping rate, defined as the rate of the exponential decline in transmission rate, ranged

from -0.125 to 0.513 d-1 globally (a negative damping rate represents acceleration in

spread). The estimated peak time (when the fastest spread occurs) and the final number

of infections were found to be greatly affected by the damping rate. Successful control

measures, such as those implemented in China and South Korea, have resulted in a clear

pattern of exponential damping in the viral spread (also shown during the 2003

outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS). The damping rate, therefore,
could be used as an indicator for the efficacy of implemented control measures. Our
model suggests that the COVID-19 outbreak is currently accelerating worldwide,

especially rapidly in certain countries (e.g. USA and Australia) where exponential

damping is yet to emerge. Consistent with the message from the World Health

Organisation (WHO), we thus strongly suggest all countries to take active measures to
contain this global pandemic. Slight increments in the damping rate from additional

control efforts, especially in countries showing weak or no exponential damping in

COVID-19 transmission, could lead to a radically more positive outcome in the fight to
contain the pandemic.

Introduction
The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which can cause acute pneumonia, was first

reported in Wuhan in December 2019, the capital of Hubei Province in central China (1,

2). Due to the excessively high rate of human-to-human transmission, the virus has

quickly spread across all provinces of China and all countries of the world (3). In order to

contain this outbreak, governments and healthcare authorities across the globe have

taken a series of strict public health measures. Wuhan and all major cities in Hubei, for

instance, were sealed off, human movement and traffic prohibited, quarantine imposed
on all potentially exposed people, makeshift hospitals quickly built to receive and cure

for infected patients. After implementation for just one month, these control measures

effectively contained the spread of this highly infectious novel coronavirus in China (4),

and were considered therefore highly efficient by the World Health Organization

(WHO)(5). As the first wave of the pandemic has passed beyond China, COVID-19 now

begins to rage worldwide, sweeping across all continents except Antarctica (6). For

effective monitoring and containment of the pandemic, it is crucial to understand the
patterns of its rapidly changing and localised transmission and promptly evaluate

whether the currently implemented control measures are adequate to ‘flatten the curve’.
Traditional epidemiological models, such as the SIR and SEIR models, explain the

rapid increase in the number of infections by the presence of a large susceptible

population exposed to infection, and the decline of infection by the depletion of the

susceptible population (7). Such a model structure is questionable for capturing the
spread of COVID-19 due to the massive size of regional and global susceptible

populations (easily running into tens or hundreds of millions of residents in a region).

The relatively limited infection, albeit excessively high when focused solely on the sheer
number of infections, as well as the resultant mortality, have rather small effects on the

demography of regional and global populations, unless a large fraction of the population
eventually contracts the virus. In addition, the parameterisation of such models is also
unreliable for a novel virus where its pathology and transmission pathways remain

unclear with little data support. As such, we here propose a population ecology model

with a time-varying infection rate to capture the transmission patterns of COVID-19. The

advantage of this phenomenological model is that it does not rely on detailed pathology,
yet can still provide an accurate and rapid assessment of COVID-19 transmission

patterns under implemented control measures. The rate of exponential damping in

transmission rate, as will be shown, provides a real-time evaluation of the efficacy of any

implemented control measures.
Methods and Results

Assuming the population is large yet the outbreak limited, so that its impact on the

demographic dynamics of the population itself is negligible, we could capture the

number of infected cases 𝑁𝑁(𝑡𝑡) over time using an ordinary differential equation,

𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝑡𝑡)/𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 𝑟𝑟(𝑡𝑡)𝑁𝑁(𝑡𝑡)(1 − 𝑁𝑁(𝑡𝑡)/𝐾𝐾), where 𝑟𝑟(𝑡𝑡) is the time-dependent transmission

rate and 𝐾𝐾 the carrying capacity of the number of infections (set as 70% of the entire

population, but please note, in most cases the final number of infections is much lower

than 𝐾𝐾, so we have essentially ignored its effect on the outbreak). We estimated the

transmission rate as 𝑟𝑟(𝑡𝑡 + 1/2) = ln�𝑁𝑁(𝑡𝑡 + 1)� − ln(𝑁𝑁(𝑡𝑡)), where 𝑡𝑡 is measured in

days. Notably, 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝑡𝑡)/𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 > 0 represents the acceleration of the epidemic spread, while

𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝑡𝑡)/𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 < 0 the deceleration and damping dynamics. We define the damping rate (𝑎𝑎)
as the rate of the exponential decline in the transmission rate 𝑟𝑟(𝑡𝑡); that is, 𝑟𝑟(𝑡𝑡) =

𝑒𝑒 −𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎+𝑏𝑏 . An effective control measure should, arguably, result in the deceleration of the
spread at a high damping rate (large positive 𝑎𝑎), while inadequate control measures

could lead to a low damping rate (small positive 𝑎𝑎 close to zero) and even the

acceleration of the spread (𝑎𝑎 < 0). The solution to the above differential equation is

𝑁𝑁(𝑡𝑡) = 𝐾𝐾𝑁𝑁0 𝑒𝑒

when ignoring K’s effect. Thus,

increases at the fastest pace (𝑑𝑑2 𝑁𝑁(𝑡𝑡)/𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 2 = 0) and can be calculated by solving the

equation 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝑡𝑡)/𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + 𝑟𝑟(𝑡𝑡)2 (1 − 2𝑁𝑁(𝑡𝑡)/𝐾𝐾) = 0 (appr. 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝑡𝑡)/𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + 𝑟𝑟(𝑡𝑡)2 = 0). In this
simple model, the transmission pattern of an outbreak can be captured solely by the

transmission rate 𝑟𝑟(𝑡𝑡) itself, which reflects the compound effects of the natural
transmission rate under implemented control measures.

To illustrate our model, we first compiled the daily numbers of COVID-19 infections

from the website of the NHCC (www.nhc.gov.cn) for the period of 10 January to 3 March

2020 in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, and the whole of China. Evidently, our model

provided an excellent fit to the data, unveiling a clear pattern of COVID-19 transmission
(Fig.1). The transmission rates in Wuhan, Hubei (but excluding Wuhan), and the rest of

China outside Hubei, all began to decline exponentially at around the same damping rate
(about 0.16 d-1) after the large-scale control measures implemented by the Chinese

authorities from 23 January (red lines in the left panels of Fig.1). Exponential damping

was more obvious outside Wuhan after 12 February (at a rate of 0.32 d-1; see the blue
lines in the left panels of Fig.1). Such exponentially damping patterns have accurately

captured the spreading dynamics of COVID-19 in China (see right panels of Fig.1), and
thus could be considered a reliable monitoring indicator of the effectiveness of those

control measures implemented in other global regions for controlling the COVID-19
outbreak.

Using the daily infection numbers from 20 January to 16 March 2020, from the WHO

website (www.who.int), we analysed the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in the

three worst affected countries (South Korea, Iran and Italy). We found that the

transmission rates of COVID-19 in these three countries were all declining exponentially

over time, with South Korea experiencing the highest damping rate, similar to that of

China (around 0.16 d-1), while the other two countries lagged behind at a much lower
damping rate, especially Italy (Fig.2). Using the current exponential function of the

transmission rate, we estimated the peak of COVID-19 spread at 18 March 2020 (95%

CI: 17-26 March) in Iran, and 6 April 2020 (95% CI: 24 March-10 May) in Italy, while the
peak in South Korea has passed at 1 March 2020. According to our model, the final

number of infected cases in South Korea could reach up to 8,895 (95% CI: 8,593-9,377),

in Iran 42,781 (95% CI: 28844-87335), and in Italy 370,841 (95% CI: 116,538-617,355).
We further calculated the damping rate for all 102 countries and regions that have

reported 7 or more days of infection, from which we also estimated the peak time since

first local infection, and the final number of infections (Table S1). Results suggest a large
variation in the damping rate of COVID-19 transmission across the world (Fig.3a), from

effective control (a>0.14 d-1) in 14 countries, to outbreak acceleration (a<-0.01 d-1) in
India, USA, Canada, Australia, Singapore and Thailand (Table S1).

For 100 countries with more than 6 days of infection, we assessed the effect of 1‰

and 5‰ increments in their observed damping rates on reducing the peak time and the
final number of infections. There were strong negative relationships between the

damping rate and the peak time since first infection (black open circles in Fig.3b), and
between the damping rate and the final number of infections (black open circles in

Fig.3c). In countries with low damping rates, the slight increase in the damping rate by
1‰ or 5‰ could drastically reduce the peak time (blue and green open circles,

respectively, in Fig.3b) and the final number of infections (blue and green open circles,

respectively, in Fig.3c). In countries with high damping rates, such minor increments in

the damping rate have trivial effects (Fig.3b-c).

For the entire world outside China, the spread of COVID-19 has been increasing

exponentially at a constant transmission rate (0.17 d-1) with its damping pattern yet to
emerge (the damping rate is close to zero; see the two bottom panels in Fig.2). The

pandemic (excluding China) can only be contained if global control efforts, especially
with extra efforts in countries showing no clear signs of exponential damping, can

suppress the transmission rate 𝑟𝑟(𝑡𝑡) to decline by a sufficient damping rate (see red

lines in Fig.3b-c). To contain the disease by the end of 2020 (one new case every 10

days) in the world (excluding China), we need to reduce the current transmission rate

with a clear exponential damping rate of a=0.057 d-1, with the estimated peak time in 11
April 2020 and the final number of infections of 3,829,338 people.

Discussion
The data from China and South Korea show that it is possible to contain the spread of

COVID-19; this is signalled by the exponential damping of the transmission rate (Fig.1;

the two top panels of Fig.2). Such exponential damping is also evident from the data of

the 2003 SARS outbreak in mainland China, Hong Kong and the entire world (data from

the website of WHO, Fig.S1). This implies that exponential damping in disease

transmission could be a universal pattern of successful infectious disease containment.

The damping rate of virus transmission reflects the effectiveness of implemented control
measures over the natural infection rate of the disease, and its variation across countries
therefore reveals whether the current implemented local/regional measures are

adequate (see Fig.1, Fig.2 & Fig.3). By estimating the time-varying transmission rate and
its damping rate, our model provides a simple theoretical framework for monitoring the
spread of an outbreak and assessing the efficacy of implemented control measures in
real time. This is important for regional decision-makers and global governance to

reflect upon, in order to modify any implemented control measures and practices in

time.

Our analysis shows that, at the moment, the pandemic is accelerating exponentially

around the world (Fig.2) and an overall damping pattern is yet to emerge. Theoretically,
our model can be used for rapid evaluation of the pandemic outbreak in real time and

assessment of any intervention measures. To this end, control measures from countries
and regions that have already shown exponential damping in their transmission rates
could be communicated and compared by the WHO for better local disease control

worldwide. Additional control measures should be implemented in countries showing

no signs of exponential damping; however, slight improvement of the current control

measures can bring about drastic improvement on outbreak control in countries already
showing weak exponential damping in transmission. Globally, our analysis suggests that
an additional control effort to bring a minimum damping rate of 0.057 d-1 is needed to

effectively control this COVID-19 pandemic below 4 million infections within 2020.
