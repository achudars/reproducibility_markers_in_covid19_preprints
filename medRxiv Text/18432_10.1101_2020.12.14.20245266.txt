Abstract
Background
Indomethacin, a well-known non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), has in
addition broad spectrum anti-viral activity in the laboratory including on SARS-Cov-2
virus. This trial is to observe the likelihood of efficacy and safety of Indomethacin in
treating RT-PCR positive Covid patients
Materials and Methods
The study was done in two groups. In the first group of the study, where mild and
moderate patients were involved, Propensity Score Matching was used as a methodology
to compare Indomethacin and paracetamol based treatments in addition to the standard
protocol for treating covid-19 patients.. Blood chemistry was collected before and after
the treatment. The patients were monitored every day for clinical parameters. In this
part, a patient developing hypoxia was the end point. In the second group, severe patients
admitted with hypoxia were treated with Indomethacin in addition to Remdesivir, and
the end point was the requirement of mechanical ventilation/admission to ICU.
Results
It was observed that patients treated with Indomethacin had a reduction in the
number of days to become afebrile, reduction in cough and myalgia by half compared to
the paracetamol set. Only one out of 72 patients in the Indomethacin arm of the first group
required supplementary oxygen while 28 of the 72 patients required supplementary
oxygen in the paracetamol arm. No one in the second group deteriorated enough to
require mechanical ventilation. There wea no evidence of adverse reaction to
indomethacin or deterioration of renal or liver function.
Conclusion
Indomethacin, along with standard care, seems to provide faster symptomatic
relief and prevent progression of pneumonia in Covid-19 patients. It should be considered
to replace paracetamol when there is no contraindication for its use.

1.0 Introduction
SARS–Cov-2, or Covid -19, which belongs to the family of coronavirus, has led to a
pandemic the likes of which the world has not seen in a hundred years. Though the mechanism
of the virus-host interaction and the possible treatment have been the subject of several hundred
studies, effective and safe treatment regime or a vaccine is yet to emerge. Drug repurposing
may be a possible solution for immediate treatment, and scores of drugs have been suggested
from various perspectives [1,2]
The drugs that could be used for the treatment of Covid-19 can be classified into three
categories: Antivirals, anti-inflammatory and supporting therapies. Antiviral action can further
be broadly classified into three categories [3]. The first category of anti-virals is the fusion
inhibitors, or virus-entry preventers. These essentially prevent the fusion of the virus and the
penetration into the human cell cytoplasm [3]. Enzymes such as the Angiotensin-Converting
Enzyme (ACE-2) and the Transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2), play important roles in
endocytosis. One of the key factors in virus entry is the protease activation of S glycoprotein.
Cathepsin L activity is crucial in this step and inhibiting Cathepsin L inhibits the entry of SARSCov-2 by 76 % [4]. The drugs of choice as fusion-inhibitors so far are Baricitinib, Camostat
mesylate and Umifenovir. But none has shown the required efficacy for treatment.
Proteases such as Mpro, Ppro and 3C-like cysteine proteases play a central role in the
replication and transcription processes. During replication and particle assembly, viral
proteases cleave polyproteins expressed by the virus to produce a number of essential NonStructural Proteins (NSPs). Hence, protease-inhibitors are a popular class of antiviral
candidates [3]. The end result of viral transcription is the production of a negative sense RNA
that is used for replication. The formation of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a
crucial enzyme in the replication process, is another target for drug discovery. Two sets of drugs
have been tried to blunt this step. Ritonavir-Lopinavir combination, for example, works to block
the formation of NSPs. They are protease inhibitors. Another set of drugs, such as Remdesivir
and Favipiravir, interferes with the RdRp thus, inhibiting virus replication.
Pro-inflammatory cytokine production is a natural process during an immune response.
An important step in the control of the disease is the elimination of virus-infected cells. If this
step, which naturally follows virus entry and replication, is defective or prolonged, several proinflammatory cytokines are generated in an uncontrolled fashion resulting in what is popularly
called a “cytokine storm” [5]. Several Interleukins are involved in a “cytokine storm”, the
foremost among them are IL-6, IL-1 [5] and IL -17 [6]. IL-17 also seems to have a role as the
interaction partner of SARS-Cov-2. Anti-inflammatory drugs targeting the production of these
Interleukins are an important choice for treatment.
1.1 Indomethacin as a drug for SARS-Cov-2

The first paper that showed the anti-viral property of Indomethacin was in 2006 [7].
The following is an account of the role of Indomethacin in the pathogenic cycle. The viral entry
can be inhibited by down regulating ACE2 and TMPRSS2 [8]. Using an open source code,
Gene2Drug, Napolitano et al., [8] found that Indomethacin indeed down regulates ACE2 by
suppressing the genes in the ACE2 pathway. The other factor, as stated earlier, is the inhibition
of Cathepsin L activity for fusion. Ragav et al. [9] showed that Indomethacin inhibits Cathepsin
L activity and no other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug has any role in the Cathepsin L
activity. Hence, theoretically, Indomethacin could be a major candidate as a fusion inhibitor.
The role of Nsp7, a cofactor of Nsp12 for RNA synthesis, has been highlighted by
Frediansyah et al. [2]. Gordan et al. [6] identified PGES-2 as the “interactor” with Nsp7 and
Indomethacin being a Prostaglandin E synthase 2 (PGES-2) inhibitor, is a candidate for
blocking RNA synthesis. That it blocks RNA synthesis was also shown by Amici et al. [7].
The anti-inflammatory effect of Indomethacin is well understood. IL-6, a key
Interleukin, and its surrogate C- Reactive Protein (CRP), are raised in Covid-19 patients.
Indomethacin is known to reduce IL-6 by inhibiting the synthesis of PGES-2 [10]. The role of
Indomethacin in lowering IL-6 in SARS-CoV-2 patients has been highlighted by Russel et al.
[11]. Indomethacin has been used successfully to prevent cytokine reaction in kidney transplant
patients receiving OKT3 therapy [12,13].
There is experimental evidence of the effectiveness of Indomethacin in vitro against
SARS-CoV-1 by Amici et al. [6]. Direct evidence for SARS-Cov-2 is provided by Xu et al.
[14]. They have shown the antiviral effect of Indomethacin in vitro, in cellulo and in Coronainfected canine model, though they state that Indomethacin does not reduce infectivity, binding
or entry into target cells. Such a conclusion comes from an earlier study [7] and needs to be
verified as the mechanisms suggested for blocking virus fusion are very robust.
Though there have been suggestions in many of the above-mentioned publications, no
proper clinical trial to evaluate Indomethacin has been carried out. In a very recent paper,
Gordon et al [6] showed, through retrospective data analysis, that Indomethacin drastically
reduces the need for hospitalization. Two recent studies [15,16] have shown the effectiveness
of Indomethacin in treating a few SARS-Cov-2 patients with severe co-morbidities. However
the sample size in these studies is small and a larger well-planned study was required to validate
these findings. This study stems from such a requirement.
2.0 Materials & Methods
Two centres were identified for the clinical trial. In both the centres (Narayana Medical
College, Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India, and Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences,
Wardha, Maharashtra, India) patients who tested RT-PCR positive for Covid-19 were recruited
for an open labelled single arm study for the efficacy and safety of Indomethacin after obtaining
Ethics Committee clearance and consent from the patients. Though a double arm Randomized

Clinical Trial would have been ideal, we felt that ethically it is unfair to deny patients
Indomethacin as our pilot study had shown positive results [15,16]. Patients who opted for
Indomethacin were recruited and in order to have a control arm, patients who opted out of
Indomethacin and who received paracetamol instead were also monitored with the same blood
tests and for other clinical parameters. Though technically it is not a double arm randomized
clinical trial, it is now accepted that Propensity Score Matching [17] mimics Randomized
Control Trial (RCT). Hence, Propensity Score Matching was applied to match patients in these
two arms. The two sets of patients were treated in the same ward of the hospital, by the same
set of physicians and during the same period.
Indomethacin replaced paracetamol and was given along with standard care which included
hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin, Azithromycin and vitamins. If patients developed hypoxia,
and if the clinician felt the need, they were shifted to a corticosteroid-based regimen. One of
the key factors in the study is the development of hypoxia. The standard care drug regimen was
a protocol assigned by the Indian Council of Medical Research and it was mandatory for both
the arms to follow this regimen. Nevertheless, other studies have shown that
hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin have variable effect in treating Covid-19 patients [18, 19].
A total of 82 patients were recruited from both the centres (75 patients from the first and 7 from
the second). In the second centre, 75mg SR (Sustained Release) Indomethacin was administered
due to non-availability of 25mg. These cases are called ‘mild and moderate’ in this study,
according to WHO clinical progression score (score 4 – hospitalized moderate disease). A total
of 109 hospitalized patients on paracetamol instead of Indomethacin formed the control arm.
In the second centre, an additional 22 patients, considered as ‘severe’ cases, were recruited.
Twenty-one of them were administered supplementary oxygen on admission and one patient
required supplementary oxygen subsequently. Though, according to WHO score, an ordinal
score 6 (high flow oxygen) is severe, many of the patients were in high flow oxygen on the
second day. Hence, all the patients in this group are called severe in this study. These patients
were treated with Indomethacin 75mg SR for five days along with Remdesivir (as part of the
standard treatment). They were analysed separately as a single arm with the end point being
deterioration to a score of 7.
The following were the investigations conducted on admission: CT scan of the lungs,
Liver Function Test, Kidney Function Test, C-Reactive Protein and D-Dimer. The blood
chemistry was repeated on discharge and the well-being of the patients monitored for fourteen
days. The patients were monitored for oxygen saturation, fever, cough and myalgia during the
five-day treatment or till recovery. The patients were deemed to have recovered
symptomatically if the temperature dropped below 990F for two days and cough reduced to
score 2 on a one-to-ten scale (1 – no cough, 2-3 – cough sometimes, 4-6 – cough with the ability
to do things, 7-8 persistent cough, and 9-10 great deal of discomfort). Myalgia was left to the

patient discretion to report and the patient was discharged with a consistent SpO2 value of above
94.
Propensity Score Matching was carried out for the first set of mild and moderate
patients using the open-source software R. Age, gender, comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes
or both), CT-score (out of 40) on admission, C-Reactive protein on admission, presence or
absence of dyspnea were considered as covariates. A logistic regression function with
Iteratively Weighted Least Square, the default algorithm in R for the command ‘glm’, was used
to identify the weights. The Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit test returned a p-value of
0.729, thus ascertaining a good fit. Fischer scoring algorithm converged in 4 iterations and the
deviance check also confirmed a good fit. Propensity Scores were calculated and the matching
carried out using ‘MatchIt’ command of R. A greedy algorithm with ‘nearest’ as the option for
search and a caliper of 0.12 was arrived at by trial and error. Out of a total of 82 patients in the
Indomethacin arm, 72 patients were matched with the patients from the paracetamol group,
which had 109 patients. In order to understand the impact of the sample size, the response rate
for paracetamol was assumed to be 0.8 and that for Indomethacin to be 0.96. The sample size
was calculated using R with an alpha value of 0.05. Marginal power was 0.84, above the
minimum recommended limit of 0.8 [20]. Post-hoc calculations based on the actual result gave
a marginal power of 0.99.
The calculated propensity scores for Indomethacin and paracetamol groups are shown in Fig.
1. A good match of propensity scores is evident.
Balance plots in Fig. 2 for all the covariates and the jitter plot in Fig. 3 bring out clearly the
relation between the control and treatment group after matching.

Indomethacin was hypothesized to be associated with symptomatic relief, namely the
number of days for becoming afebrile, days for reduction of cough to two in an ordinal scale
(occasional) and relief from myalgia. These were monitored and the results are shown in Fig.

In order to rule out the association of temperature on admission, days for becoming
afebrile was plotted against temperature on admission and shown in Fig. 9. One can conclude
from Figs. 9 and 10 that the temperature on admission or the CT score on admission probably
has no relation to the patient recovery.

The two key questions in this study are: How many patients developed hypoxia and required
steroids treatment, and how many had a prolonged stay (more than 14 days) in the hospital.
We split the patients requiring supplementary oxygen into two categories. The first category
consisted of patients admitted with shortness of breath and oxygen saturation more than 95%
and requiring supplementary oxygen subsequently during the hospital stay due to drop in
saturation. This statistic is given in Fig. 11. Interestingly, only one patient in the Indomethacin
arm required supplementary oxygen at 2L/min for two days.

The other set is of patients who had no shortness of breath on admission but developed hypoxia

who had vomiting and nausea on admission and during treatment, had a brief period of hypoxia
but did not require supplementary oxygen.

Fig. 13 gives the probability of developing hypoxia using the Kaplan-Meier survival model.
Patients in the paracetamol arm required supplementary oxygen even after four-five days of
treatment. The hazard ratio of the Indomethacin arm compared to the paracetamol arm, using
the Cox-proportional-hazards model, is a low 0.00218 with a 95 % CI being (0.00015 to 0.03)

Fig. 13 Kaplan-Meier curves for the probability of developing hypoxia
The results from the software R for a Cox proportional hazards model is shown in fig.14. It
can be seen that apart from the indomethacin (treatment) and shortness of breath at admission
(SOB), CT-score and to a lesser extent C-Reactive protein (CRP.A) have significance for the
development of hypoxia. The effect of CT score is further explained by Fig. 15

Patients with prolonged stay in the hospital in the paracetamol arm were analysed for hazard
ratio. Development of hypoxia seems to be the only significant factor with a hazard ratio of 5.2
(95 % CI [1.27 to 21.6].
One of the key roles for Indomethacin is to act as an anti-inflammatory drug. The
change in CRP for the Indomethacin arm is given in Fig. 16. The paracetamol arm, in which 39
out of 72 patients were treated with methylprednisolone along with paracetamol, is not included
for comparison.

Fig. 16 Change in CRP after indomethacin treatment
Patients were followed up after 14 days by telephone since they were discharged early after 6
days in the Indomethacin arm. None of them reported any significant symptom. On the otherhand, most patients of the paracetamol arm were in hospital for ten to fourteen days
A group of 22 patients, as mentioned earlier, on 75mg SR of Indomethacin, with more
severe Covid-19, was also monitored in the study. The patients’ profiles are given in the
preceding figures. The number of days for recovery to WHO ordinal scale for clinical
improvement 4 (no oxygen) are given in Fig. 17. Twenty-one patients were discharged on or
before 14 days and one patient, who had acute pancreatitis, was discharged after 17 days. Most
importantly, no patient required ICU admission. We did not compare this group to a similar
one with paracetamol.

3.2 Safety profile of Indomethacin:
Though Indomethacin was approved in 1965, there have been concerns about its safety
[21]. Patients were tested for Serum Urea and Creatinine, SGOT and SGPT before and after
the treatment and the results are given in Figs 19-22.

All these figures show no deterioration after five days of Indomethacin except in one patient
with CKD where the creatinine increased by 0.5 mg/dL. No other side-effects were reported by
the patients or the attending physicians. Acute pancreatitis was seen in one patient in the severe
group on admission. Indomethacin was continued for five days in that patient and he was
discharged on the 17th day after recovery. The prolonged stay was due to the pancreatitis rather
than respiratory problem.
4.0 Discussion
The patients in the Indomethacin arm were found to have faster recovery compared
to the paracetamol arm. As can be seen from Fig.8, many patients felt symptomatic relief with
just two doses. Days for complete symptomatic recovery is three/four days in the former arm,
compared to seven/eight days in the latter arm for symptomatic relief. Interestingly, even for
severe cases, the symptomatic improvement is remarkable. The severe cases had received
Indomethacin Sustained Release 75mg as against 25mg regular preparation twice a day in the
mild and moderate cases. Age and CT-Score were observed to have no relation on the days for
recovery.
The other objective of this study was to monitor the deterioration of patients to hypoxia.
Of the eleven patients who complained of shortness of breath on admission in the Indomethacin
arm only one was administered mild flow (2L/min) O2 for two days to give symptomatic relief.
On the other hand, all the five patients in the paracetamol group who had shortness of breath
on admission required supplementary oxygen. The results of the rest of the patients during the
hospital stay are even more striking. A large proportion (34%), who did not have breathlessness
on admission, but developed hypoxia requiring oxygen. Though they recovered, many had a
prolonged stay in the hospital. None in the Indomethacin arm developed hypoxia.
Supplementary oxygen was provided when Room Air (RA) SpO2 fell below 93% and the
patient felt the need. Even more interesting is Fig. 13. The lone case which required oxygen in
the first set was only after one day (second day after admission). Patients in the second arm,
even after three-four days of treatment. deteriorated to hypoxia. Further analysis reported in
Fig. 14 reveals that CT-Score and CRP at admission apart from shortness of breath at
admission are factors in the second arm to develop hypoxia. Interaction between CRP at
admission and CT score did not produce significant outcome. On the other hand, in the
Indomethacin arm, with only one patient developing hypoxia CT-Score and other factors were
overwhelmed by the treatment.
The hazard ratio for the indomethacin arm is 0.00218 with a 95% Confidence Interval
of [0.00016, 0.031]. Lastly, prolonged stay in the hospital, beyond 14 days, is also a strong
function of hypoxia at admission for the paracetamol arm. None in the Indomethacin group had
a prolonged stay in the hospital. In the paracetamol arm twenty three patients had a prolonged

stay. This conclusion is very important as the hospital infrastructure is not stretched by
prolonged stay.
Reduction of C-Reactive Protein (CRP), a marker for inflammation, is plotted for
patients in the Indomethacin arm. About 10% of the patients, who had low CRP levels on
admission, had an elevated CRP after five days. Their follow-up after 14 days revealed no
symptoms. This needs further investigation. Such a trend was not observed in the severe cases.
Though the drug is five decades old, safety and adverse reactions were monitored
through day-to-day observations and blood biochemistry. No patient developed nausea or
vomiting, or gastro-intestinal bleeding in the form of malena. One patient admitted with
nausea, vomiting and loose motions continued to have the symptoms during the treatment. She
recovered after five days. She also developed mild hypoxia briefly but did not require
supplementary oxygen.
There was no deterioration of renal or liver functions in the Indomethacin arm except
in one patient with chronic kidney disease where the creatinine went up by 0.5% mg% from 1.2
mg%..
The study uses Propensity Score Matching, an accepted methodology in observational
studies. Ethically, we felt that the study design is fair; it is close to RCT and blinded trials have
been questioned for their inability to answer clinical questions [22]. Though the matched scores
are acceptable on one metric, clinicians would like to view it on the actual covariates. Further
insights are provided in Figs. 4 to 7. One can conclude from these figures that the patient profile
distribution is similar in both the arms and the severe cases have higher CT-Scores and CRP.
The use of Indomethacin in 22 patients falling under the severe category was analysed
separately, They received Indomethacin 75mg Sustained Release for five days along with
Remedisvir for five days. Although these patients were hypoxemic on admission, they showed
rapid symptomatic relief. However, they took longer time to recover from hypoxia and these
patients could be discharged by 14 days except the patient with pancreatitis who stayed for 17
days. The cause of pancreatitis was not clear but Indomethacin was also given to him for 5
days. It is unlikely that Indomethacin caused the pancreatitis as the drug is under trial for
treatment for acute pancreatitis [23]. Nevertheless, none of them required addition of steroids
or transfer to the ICU or ventilator support.
The anti-inflammatory action of Indomethacin is well known [24]. SARS-Cov-2
produces severe disease not due to cytopathic action, but due to inflammation [25].
Indomethacin is a unique drug with anti-viral and anti-inflammatory actions. It is unfortunate
that early publications cautioned the use of NSAIDs for Covid-19 [26].

Our study does not differentiate the anti-viral and anti-inflammatory actions of
Indomethacin. But the patients in the Indomethacin arm of the study became rapidly
asymptomatic, and had far less probability of developing hypoxia (Fig.13) compared to the
paracetamol arm. The major drawback of the study is that Indomethacin was not used alone for
Covid-19 treatment.
5.0 Conclusions
A registered clinical trial for assessing the efficacy and safety of Indomethacin for RTPCR positive Covid-19 patients was carried out at two different centres. Propensity Scores were
used to match with the paracetamol group. Symptomatic relief of Indomethacin patients was
remarkable compared to the paracetamol group. Only one of the 72 patients required
supplementary oxygen, while 28 out of 72 patients in the paracetamol group required oxygen
supplement. The odds ratio of 0.022 sums up the statistical significance of the results. A set of
22 patients administered supplementary oxygen on admission did not deteriorate to warrant
ventilation. Indomethacin should replace paracetamol in the treatment protocol for Covid-19
in the absence of specific contraindication
