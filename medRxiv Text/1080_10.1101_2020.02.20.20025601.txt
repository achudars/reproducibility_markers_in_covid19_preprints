Key Points
Question What can we learn from the clinical manifestations and pathological
features of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)?
Findings In this review, we found COVID-19 was transmitted in a more diverse way
than Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Fever, cough and Malaise/Fatigue
were the most common symptoms. We also found that the SARS-CoV-2 has the same
cell entry receptor ACE2 as SARS-CoV, and they have similar pathological
mechanisms like Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Meaning This review aims to give people a more comprehensive understanding of
COVID-19 and to continuously improve the level of prevention, control, diagnosis
and treatment.

Abstracts
Importance In 2002-2003, a severe pulmonary infectious disease occurred in
guangdong, China. The disease was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 17 years apart, also happen in China, and also a novel
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), this epidemic has posed a significant hazard to people’s
health both China and the whole world.
Objective Summarized the latest epidemiological changes, clinical manifestations,
auxiliary examination and pathological characteristics of COVID-19.
Evidence Review PubMed database were searched from 2019 to 2020 using the index
terms “novel coronavirus” or “COVID-19” or “2019-nCoV” or “SARS-CoV-2”

and synonyms. Articles that reported clinical characteristics, laboratory results,
imageological diagnosis and pathologic condition were included and were
retrospectively reviewed for these cases. This paper adopts the method of descriptive
statistics.

，

Results 34 COVID-19-related articles were eligible for this systematic review Four
of the articles were related to pathology. We found that Fever (86.0%), cough (63.9%)
and Malaise/Fatigue (34.7%) were the most common symptoms in COVID-19. But in
general, the clinical symptoms and signs of COVID-19 were not obvious. Compared
with SARS, COVID-19 was transmitted in a more diverse way. The mortality rates of
COVID-19 were 2.5%, and the overall infection rate of healthcare worker of
COVID-19 was 3.9%. We also found that the pathological features of COVID-19
have greatly similar with SARS, which manifested as ARDS. But the latest
pathological examination of COVID-19 revealed the obvious mucinous secretions in
the lungs.
Interpretation The clinical and pathological characteristics of SARS and COVID-19
in China are very similar, but also difference. The latest finds of pathological
examination on COVID-19 may upend existing treatment schemes, so the early
recognition of disease by healthcare worker is very important.

Introduction
In December 2019, a group of unidentified pneumonia patients was found to be linked
to a seafood wholesale market in wuhan, China[1]. By analyzing samples from

pneumonia patients, we identified a previously unknown subcoronavirus, which we
named 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). WHO has officially named the virus
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease
corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19)[2]. By Mar 8, 2020, more than 105586 cases of
COVID-19 pneumonia had been reported in countries and regions around the world

the cumulative death toll stands at 3584[3]. The United States, Australia, Germany,

transmission[3-11]. COVID-19 is transmitted primarily through droplets and contact,
recent studies[4, 12] showed that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in stool samples of patients,
which makes it possible for gastrointestinal transmission.
Seventeen years ago, a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) happened in
Guangdong Province, China, and soon spread to other countries and regions[13-16] .
By the end of the outbreak, 26 countries had reported 8,098 possible SARS cases and
774 deaths[14]. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are both enveloped RNA viruses and
widely distributed in humans, other mammals and birds. Recent studies analysis
showed that the novel coronavirus had 78% nucleotide homology with human
SARS–CoV[17, 18]. As. more and more COVID-19 cases are diagnosed, we find that
SARS and COVID-19 share many similarities in clinical manifestations,
epidemiology, and mode of transmission. At present, while the epidemic in China is
gradually under control, Europe and the Middle East have shown a rapid spread of the
epidemic. For example, the number of infections in South Korea, Italy, Iran and other

countries has soared recently[3]. So far, our understanding of COVID-19 remained to
be limited, Especially in pathology. This report summarizes the initial clinical
description and Pathological discovery of SARS and COVID-19 in different countries.
We also compared the pathological features of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to
provide a reference for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 by describing and
emphasizing the characteristic changes of SARS-CoV.

Methods
This study aimed to summary the case of COVID-19 on clinical features,
epidemiological findings, laboratory and imageological examination, pathological
studies and treatment options in different countries.
Search strategy
This study was a review that was conducted in 2020. Searches were done in scientific
databases of PubMed, based on the combination of related keywords based of Mesh
terms (Table 1). One researcher (Y.Q.M), a professional clinician searched PubMed
for all published articles regarding COVID-19 up to March 9, 2020. A second
researcher (W. L), a professional clinician with expertise in systematic reviews,
repeated the first reviewer’s search independently. Both searches agreed completely.
All steps of searches were done based on the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. The searches were
limited to papers published in the English and Chinese language. Institutional review
board approval and informed consent were not obtained given that the study was a

systematic review of the literature, we limited our study to published information and
did not engage with any human subjects.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria were original articles, retrospective case series and case report
of COVID-19 infection, including clinical features, epidemiological findings,
laboratory and imageological examination, treatment options or pathological studies.
Exclusion criteria were unavailable full text, no target observations and other article
types, Other article types included review articles, comment, news, etc. Also
conference articles were excluded. The data extraction of categories, including the
author’s name, publication year, countries, age, sex, clinical features, epidemiological
findings, laboratory and imageological examination, treatment options, pathological
studies, etc. After data extraction, we summarized and reported the findings in tables
and figures according to the objectives of the study. Two researchers (Y.Q.M and W.L
who were specialist physicians) reviewed each of these articles in detail. Each
researcher identified every article that concerned clinical characteristics or pathologic
studies of COVID-19 infection. These search results are submitted to third parties
(J.W.P who was a professionally trained physician), who review discrepancies and
make decisions in the event of disagreement.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages, and
continuous variables were described using a range, median and interquartile ranges
(IQR) values, Mean and standard deviation (SD).

Results
As of March 9, 2020, we identified 34 studies, Among them, 33 articles[2, 4-11,19-42]
come from the PubMed database, and one article[43] about pathology comes from a
Chinese journal (Figure 1). Three of the articles were related to pathology[41-43]. The
characteristics of 34 studies are shown in Table 2. Articles on the characteristics of
COVID-19 mainly came from China, as well as from countries with a small number
of current case reports, such as the United States, Germany, Australia, Vietnam,
Thailand, Japan, Canada, Brazil, Nepal and South Korea.
Demographic and clinical characteristics
Demographic and clinical characteristics are shown in Table 3. In COVID-19, we
found 3.9% were health workers, and 51.7 % were male (male: female=1.07:1). The
most common clinical manifestation of COVID-19 were Fever (86.0%), Cough
(63.9%), Malaise/Fatigue/Confusion (34.7%), Sputum production (28.9%), Shortness
of breath

(19.7%)

and Myalgia

(18.8%),

whereas diarrhea (5.7%) and

Nausea/vomiting (6.1%) were rare. 26.7% of patients in COVID-19 had at least one
underlying disorder (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, Cardiovascular disease, etc).
Imaging and laboratory findings at presentation
Table 3 shows the laboratory and Imaging findings In COVID-19. In these review we
found the most common, patterns on chest imaging findings were ground-glass
opacity (60.9%) and pulmonary consolidation or exudation (37.0%), 19.5% were
unilateral pneumonia and 68.8% were bilateral pneumonia. 64.2%, 29.1% and 24.3%

of patients had lymphopenia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively.
Treatment and outcomes
Table 3 shows the treatment and outcomes. In this review we found that in
COVID-19, oxygen therapy, antiviral therapy, antibiotic therapy, the use of
corticosteroids or immunoglobulin were in 56.1%, 51.2%, 62.9%, 22.0% and 16.8%
of patients, respectively. Another 1.4% and 2.5% of people use of extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation and continuous renal-replacement therapy. The death toll and
severe patients of COVID-19 were 18.4% and 2.5%.
Mode of transmission
Before the closes of Huanan seafood market on January 1, 2020. people contracted
the disease mainly through contact with host animals carrying the virus[24],
Subsequently, infected people spread the virus to their families, communities through
human-to-human transmission and contact transmission. Other countries are also
seeing increasing numbers of travel-related imported cases and human-to-human
transmission.
Pulmonary pathology
Table 4 summarizes the pulmonary pathological features of COVID-19. The
pathology showed that the manifestations of COVID-19 were similar to SARS. But
the latest pathological examination of COVID-19 revealed the obvious mucinous
secretions in the lungs.

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are both belong to the β coronavirus family, which
share 78% of their nucleotide homology[18]. As more and more confirmed cases of
COVID-19 have been reported, we found that SARS and COVID-19 have great
similarities in clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations and chest imaging.
Infectious source
Current studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is mainly related to wildlife trafficking
in Huanan seafood market in China. A study by Chan et al found that SARS-CoV-2 is
most closely related to coronaviruses found in horseshoe bats in China[44].The SARS
outbreak in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in 2012
have demonstrated the possibility of coronavirus transmission from animals to
humans[45, 46].
It is currently believed that whether SARS or COVID-19, the main source of
infection is people infected with coronavirus. in the early report of 41 confirmed cases
of COVID-19, 27 reported exposure to the Huanan seafood market[24]. But since the
closure of the seafood market on Jan 1, 2020, more and more new cases have been
reported to be associated with contact with confirmed patients which stress the
importance of human-to-human transmission. However, it's worth noting that there
were some people uninfected in close contacts with SARS or COVID-19[12, 13, 16].
Therefore, whether genetic susceptibility exists or not needs further study.
Route of transmission
In this study, we found COVID-19 were mainly transmitted by droplets and
contact, showing human-to-human transmission, family aggregation spread and

nosocomial infection. It is worth noting that COVID-19 has a more diverse mode of
transmission that can manifest itself as asymptomatic infection[7], something that has
not previously been seen in SARS[47]. Because of the absence of symptoms, it is
difficult to detect and isolate carriers in time, which makes it more difficult to control
the spread of the disease[47, 48]. Recent studies have found that SARS-CoV-2 can be
detected in the feces of patients, indicating that the possibility of fecal-oral
transmission[4, 12]. There have been reports of infections in newborns[2], but more
studies are needed to confirm the presence of vertical transmission. A study of nine
pregnant women[2] which tested the amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs
and breast milk of six patients for SARS-CoV, all of which were negative and did not
support mother-to-child transmission. Human-to-human, asymptomatic infection and
possible mother-to-child transmission and fecal-oral transmission are the causes of the
widespread spread of the disease. So, the early recognition of COVID-19 in different
countries can reduces transmission risk and increases understanding of SARS-CoV-2,
to inform national and global response actions.
Susceptible population
Through the summary analysis of the pneumonia, we found that COVID-19 had
a general susceptibility, However, it should be noted that cases[2] of infection in
pregnant women, newborns, infants and children have been reported successively. The
reason was considered to be related to the special immune tolerance state of pregnant
women during pregnancy[2] and the low immune function of children and infants[48].

the low body defense against infection, it is easy to develop severe pneumonia once
infected with COVID-19[12, 21].
Clinical manifestations, auxiliary examination and treatment
Through the study of COVID-19 in different countries, we found that pneumonia
were mainly characterized by fever, accompanied by different degrees of cough,
dyspnea, fatigue and discomfort. However, the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 were
not obvious. COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms are easy to be overlooked, so it
is necessary to take active and effective isolation measures for suspected patients or
close contacts as early as possible. Furthermore, laboratory tests showed that patients
with COVID-19 may had lymphopenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, along
with elevated levels of liver enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase.
On imaging, COVID-19 was mainly manifested as multiple ground-glass
shadows. A CT scan of 29 patients with COVID-19 revealed a single or multiple
patchy frosted glass shadow with septum thickening in typical case of COVID-19.As
the disease progresses, the lesion increases and the scope expands, and frosted glass
shadows coexist with solid or striated shadows[29]. An imaging study of 81 people
found that abnormal chest imaging could occur even in asymptomatic patients and
progressed rapidly from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral within 1-3 weeks[26]. Since
the early imaging changes of COVID-19 were not obvious, high resolution chest CT
examination should be performed as soon as possible for suspected patients to clarify.
At present, the treatment of COVID-19 is lack of specific drugs and mainly focuses
on support treatment. Therefore, early detection, early isolation, early diagnosis and

early treatment are the key measures to control infectious diseases. Our clinical and
pathological review of COVID-19 can help healthcare worker to formulate a timely
therapeutic strategy for similar patients and reduce mortality
Pathological characteristics
SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as a sister virus to SARS-CoV, a SARS-related
coronavirus (SARSr-CoV). SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to infect
human respiratory epithelial cells through the interaction of viral S proteins and
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors on human cells[26,

49]

. Therefore, it is

speculated that they may have the same pathological changes. The early pathology of
SARS found[50,

51]

that SARS-CoV widespreadly existed in the epithelium of the

digestive tract, the epithelium of the distal convoluted tubules of the kidney, and the
sweat glands of the skin, suggesting that in addition to respiratory transmission,
SARS might also be transmitted through contact between the patient's feces, urine and
skin. which also provided a new way to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. In
addition, Ding et al[50, 51] also found SARS-CoV in systemic endocrine gland, Because
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have the same mechanism of action, they can cause
rapid production of multiple cytokines in body fluids after infection with
microorganisms, leading to acute respiratory distress and multiple organ failure. This
also explains why most covid-19 patients have mild symptoms at the onset of the
disease, while some are suddenly worse after being diagnosed in hospital, which may
be related to the body producing too many cytokines after the disease, leading to
"cytokine storm" in the body.

Xu et al[42] and Tian et al[41] found diffuse alveolar injury, transparent membrane
formation and pulmonary edema in the early pulmonary puncture pathology of
COVID-19 patients, which was similar to the pathological manifestations of SARS.
However, it is worth noting that the pathology of COVID-19 also shows fibromyxoid
exudation and the formation of thick “mucus plugs”. The first autopsy, performed by
liu's team[43], found a large amount of sticky secretions spilling out of the alveoli, with
fibrous cords visible. As of February 25, Liu's team completed a preliminary
anatomical diagnosis of three of the 11 cases, all of which found mucinous secretions
in the lungs of the deceased. This finding is a warning for clinical treatment. If the
mucus components are not dissolved, oxygen alone may not achieve the goal, and
sometimes may be counterproductive to increase the hypoxia of patients.

Limitations
This study has several limitations, first, among those cases, most patients are still
hospitalized at the time of paper published. Therefore, it is difficult to accurate assess
number of deaths and severe cases, and risk factors for poor outcome. so continued
observations of the process and prognosis of the disease are needed. second,So far,

，

many foreign reports on COVID-19 have been individual cases making comparisons
difficult. This paper mainly uses descriptive analysis to review and summarize the
case.

The source, intermediate host, transmission route and incubation period of
SARS-CoV-2 are not fully understood. Knowledge of the virus remains elusive and
unpredictable. Therefore, early pathological examination is the most direct means to
uncover the true face of SARS-CoV-2. Now the outbreak of COVID-19 constitutes an
