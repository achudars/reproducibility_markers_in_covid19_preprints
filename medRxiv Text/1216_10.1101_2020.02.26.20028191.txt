Abstract
Background: A recently developing pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 was
originated in Wuhan, China, and has quickly spread across the world. We reported the
clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19 in a single center.
Methods: Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2
infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospitalâ€™s electronic medical records
according to previously designed standardized data collection forms.
Results: All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and the great proportion of them
were diagnosed as severe illness when admitted. Most of the death cases were male
(65.9%). More than half of dead patients were older than 60 years (80.5%) and the
median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of death cases had comorbidity (76.8%),
including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes

(18.3%),

cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Respiratory failure remained the
leading cause of death (69.5%), following by sepsis syndrome/MOF (28.0%), cardiac
failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%). Furthermore,
respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhage, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100%,
89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients, respectively. On the admission,
lymphopenia (89.2%), neutrophilia (74.3%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3%) were
usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of >5
(94.5%), high systemic immune-inflammation index of >500 (89.2%), increased
C-reactive protein level (100%), lactate dehydrogenase (93.2%), and D-dimer
(97.1%). A high level of IL-6 (>10 pg/ml) was observed in all detected patients.
Median time from initial symptom to death was 15 days (IQR 11-20), and a
significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p=0.002), alanine

aminotransferase (p=0.037) and time from initial symptom to death were interestingly
observed.
Conclusion: Older males with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe
disease, even die from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory failure is the main cause
of COVID-19, but either virus itself or cytokine release storm mediated damage to
other organ including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hemorrhage should be taken
seriously as well.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
As the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus, severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 causes a cluster of severe respiratory disease
which is similar to another two fatal coronavirus infection caused by SARS-CoV and
Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Through searching
PubMed and the China National knowledge infrastructure databases up to February
20, 2020, no published article focusing on hospitalized dead patients was identified.

Added value of this study
We conducted a single-center investigation involving 82 hospitalized death patients
with COVID-19 and focused on their epidemiological and clinical characteristics. 66
of 82 (80.5%) of patients were older than 60 years and the median age was 72.5 years.

The bulk of death cases had comorbidity (76.8%). Respiratory failure remained the
leading cause of death, following by sepsis syndrome/MOF, cardiac failure,
hemorrhage, and renal failure. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte
ratio, high systemic immune-inflammation index, and increased levels of
proinflammatory cytokines.

Implications of all the available evidence
SARS-CoV-2 causes a cluster of severe respiratory illness which is similar to another
two fatal coronavirus infection caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Death is more
likely to occur in older male patients with comorbidity. Infected patients might
develop acute respiratory distress and respiratory failure which was the leading cause
of death, but damages of other organs and systems, including cardiac, hemorrhage,
hepatic, and renal also contribute to the death. These damages might be attributable to
indirect cytokines storm initiated by immune system and direct attack from
SARS-CoV-2 itself.

Introduction
In December 2019, the first acute respiratory disease caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, and recently officially named as
Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organization (WHO)
occurred in Wuhan, China.1,2 Person-to-person transmission has been identified
through respiratory droplets or likely feces.3-5 By February 14, 2020, more than
60,000 confirmed cases and close to 2,000 dead cases have been documented in China,
with hundreds of imported patients found in other countries.4-7

Generally, the incubation period of COVID-19 was 3 to 7 days. Fever, cough, and
fatigue were the most common symptoms.1 Approximately 20-30% of cases would
develop severe illness, and some need further intervention in intensive care unit
(ICU) .8,9 Organ dysfunction including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),
shock, acute cardiac injury, and acute renal injury, can happen in severe cases with
COVID-19.1,8,9 It has been reported that critical ill patients were more likely to be
older, had underlying diseases, and were more likely to have a symptom of dyspnea.9
Oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, intravenous antibiotics and antiviral therapy
were usually applied in clinical management, but presently there were no effective
drugs for improving the clinical outcome of COVID-19, especially for severe
cases.1,8,9

ARDS, a rapidly progressive disease, is the main cause of death for the patients
infected with previously recognized corona virus infection such as SARS-CoV and
Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).10,11 In this context, it
was initially considered that lung is the most commonly damaged organ by

SARS-CoV-2 infection since human airway epithelia express angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection.12,13 However,
increasing clinical cases indicated cardiac, renal and even digestive organ damage in
the patients with COVID-19,9 which is consistent with the findings that kidney, colon
and the other tissues also express ACE2 besides airway epithelia.14,15 The above
clinical phenomenon and basic research suggest more complicated pathogenesis of
COVID-19. Hence, analyzing clinical characteristics of death cases with COVID-19
is urgently needed to improve the outcome of infected patients.

Methods
Data collection
We

of

laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 dead patients from January 11, 2020 to February 10,
2020 in the Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University. The confirmed diagnosis of
COVID-19 was defined as a positive result by using real-time reverse-transcriptase
polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) detection for routine nasal and pharyngeal swab
specimens. This study received approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the
Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China (approval number:
WDRY2020-K038). The Research Ethics Committee waived the requirement
informed consent before the study started because of the urgent need to collect
epidemiological and clinical data. We analyzed all the data anonymously.

The clinical features, including clinical symptoms, signs, laboratory analyses,
radiological findings, treatment, and outcome, were obtained from the hospitalâ€™s
electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data

collection forms. Laboratory analyses included complete blood count, liver function,
renal function, electrolytes test, coagulation function, C-reactive protein, lactate
dehydrogenase, myocardial enzymes, procalcitonin, and status of other virus infection.
Radiological analyses comprised of X-ray and computed tomography.

The date of onset of symptoms, initial diagnosis of COVID-19, and death were
recorded accurately. The incubation period was defined as the time from the contact
of transmission origin to the onset of different symptoms and signs. Onset survival
time was defined as the period between the onset of different symptoms and signs and
the time of death. To increase the accuracy of collected data, two researchers
independently reviewed the data collection forms. We also directly communicated
with patients or their family members to ascertain the epidemiological and symptom
data.

Inflammation markers
Inflammation markers were calculated using specific parameters of blood tests.
Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated by dividing the absolute
neutrophil count by the lymphocyte count. Systematic inflammatory index (SII) was
defined as platelet count Ã— neutrophil count/ lymphocyte count (/Î¼L). Interleukin
(IL)-6 was detected using Human Cytokine Standard Assays panel (ET Healthcare,
Inc., Shanghai, China) and the Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive analyses were used to determine the patientsâ€™ epidemiological and clinical
features. Continuous variables were presented as median and interquartile range
(IQR), and categorical variables were expressed as the percentages in different
categories. The Chi-squared test or Fisherâ€™s exact test was adopted for category
variables. The association between the different clinical variables and the time from
initial symptom to death was evaluated using Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation coefficient.
Statistical analyses in this study were performed with use of STATA 15.0 software
(Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). A two-sided p value less than 0.05
was considered statistically significant.

Results
From January 11, 2020 to February 10, 2020, a total of 1,334 patients with a diagnosis
of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were recorded in the Renmin Hospital, Wuhan
University, while 6.2% (82/1334) of patients with this disease were dead. In the same
period, the rate of mortality for all causes and non-COVID-19 in this hospital, were
2.3% (162/7119) and 1.4% (80/5785), respectively. The mortality rate of COVID-19
was higher than that of non- COVID-19 (p<0.001).

The epidemiological features and underlying diseases were shown in table 1. All
patients were local residents of Wuhan, and only 2 patients acknowledged a contact
with the patients confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection. All the patients denied a
history of contact with wildlife or Huanan seafood market visit. The great proportion
of them were diagnosed as severe illness when admitted (77/82). Median incubation
time was 7 days (IQR 5.0-10.0). Most of the death cases were male (65.9%), older
than 60 years (80.5%) and the median age was 72.5 years (IQR 65.0-80.0). The bulk

of death cases had comorbidity (75.6%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart
disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer
(7.3%). 30 out of 82 dead patients (30.5%) had 2 or more underlying diseases.

We analyzed the causes of mortality of patients with laboratory-confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection (table 2). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of
death (69.5%), following by sepsis syndrome/multiple organ dysfunction syndrome
(MOF) (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%).
Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhage, hepatic, and renal damage were found
in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients, respectively. A majority of
patients (75.6%) had 3 or more damaged organs or systems following the infection
with SARS-CoV-2.

As shown in table 3, fever (78.0%), cough (64.6%), and shortness of breath (63.4%)
were the main common symptom. Diarrhea was observed in 12.2% of patients. All
patients had bilateral involvement of chest radiographs. On the admission,
lymphopenia (89.2%), neutrophilia (74.3%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3%) were
usually observed. All the patients had increased C-reactive protein level (100%), and
most patients had a high NLR >5.0 (94.5%), SII index of >500 (89.2%), lactate
dehydrogenase (93.2%), D-dimer (97.1%), cardiac troponin I (86.7%), and
procalcitonin (81.2%). Insufficient cell immunity with reduced CD3+ (93.1%), CD8+
(98.3%), CD6+CD56+ (100%) cell count, and high level of circulating IL-6 (100%)
were observed in patients.

Furthermore, in the last 24 hours of the death, lymphopenia (73.7%), neutrophilia
(100%), and thrombocytopenia (63.2%) were continuously present. Increased
C-reactive protein level, high NLR, increased lactate dehydrogenase, and increased
D-dimer were found in all patients. The incidence of neutrophilia was increased from
74.3% to 100%, and the incidence of lymphopenia was reduced from 89.2% to 73.7%.
The incidence of high creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were increased from 15.3%
to 45.0%, and 48.6% to 85.0%, respectively. High level of IL-6 (>10U/L) remained in
all detected patients. More than half had a pH value of less than 7.35 (52.9%), and a
pO2 value of less than 60 mmHg (70.6%) (table 4).

As shown in table 3, a total of 14 patients (17.1%) were treated in ICU. Patients
received oxygen therapy (100%), mechanical ventilation (40.2%), including 4
invasive mechanical ventilation (4.8%). All patients received intravenous of
antibiotics and anti-virus medications, and systematic corticosteroids were used in 29
patients (35.3%).

The median time from initial symptom to death was 15 days (IQR 15-20) and a
significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p=0.002), alanine
aminotransferase (p=0.037) and time from initial symptom to death were interestingly
observed (figure 1A-C).

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the clinical characteristics of dead
patients with COVID-19. The mortality of 6.2% from current study was lower than
that of SARS infection in 2003. However, the mortality rate from this center is a little

bit higher than previously reported.9 We speculated the reason might be that fewer
patients in our study were transferred to the ICU in time when their condition rapidly
worsened. On the other hand, limited death cases, less than 15 patients were included
in their cohort,8,9 while much more death cases were included in the present study.

Our study firstly focused on the epidemiological characteristics of dead patients with
COVID-19. Several factors were responsible for the death of these patients included
in this study. A majority of patients were older than 60 years in our study, and a
borderline significant association between age and time from initial symptom to death
were interestingly observed. These results are consistent with that older age was more
likely occurred in critically ill patients.16 Moreover, we found underlying diseases
such as hypertension, heart disease and diabetes were very common in our death cases,
and 30.5% of patients had 2 or more comorbidities. These features are consistent with
previous report that patients with underlying diseases more likely developed to severe
illness.9 Cancer patients is comprised of 7.3% in our cohort, much higher than cancer
morbidity, suggest that cancer patients more likely develop to severe disease, even
death. These results are consistent with the findings from a national wide analysis in
China.17 Immune deficiency to virus infection seems to be the common features in
older males with comorbidities.

We further analyzed the cause of death case with COVID-19 and found that
respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death. It has been reported that the
binding receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 is mainly expressed in blood vessels and
lung alveolar type II (AT2) epithelial cells,13 Similar to the SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can directly attack ACE2-expressing cells.13 Indeed,

pathological findings indicated that infected lungs with SARS-CoV-2 present as
ARDS, pulmonary edema with hyaline membrane formation, evident desquamation of
pneumocytes.18 Therefore, our finding that respiratory failure is the leading cause of
death, is consistent with the underlying pathological mechanism of COVID-19.

Besides respiratory failure, cardiac failure, hemorrhage, renal failure and even MOF
were also recognized as the cause of death by COVID-19 in our study. Laboratory
findings also revealed cardiac, hepatic, and renal damage in some of patients. We also
observed a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase, alanine
aminotransferase and time from initial symptom to death. These clinical phenomena
could be explained by virus itself attack and cytokine release storm (CRS) mediated
tissue damage. First, ACE2 expression is also found in the kidney, heart, and liver etc,
therefore SARS-CoV-2 could invade the cells of above tissues, reproduce and damage
these organ.14,15 Second, virus infection and subsequent tissue damage either in the
lung or other target organ could elicit immune cells to produce pro-inflammatory
cytokines, namely CRS, ultimately injury the tissue and cause target organ failure.
Obviously, increased amounts of cytokines, including IL-1Î², IL-6, and monocyte
chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), are associated with severe lung injury in patients
infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.19,20 A recent study showed high levels of
IL-1Î², interferon Î³-induced protein 10 , and MCP-1 occurred in serum of patients
infected with SARS-CoV-2, which probably leaded to the activation of T-helper-1
cell response1. In the present report, high level of IL-6 of more than10U/L and
C-reactive protein were detected in all patients, even in the last 24 hours prior to
death.

We also depicted the immune status of COVID-19 patients with severe illness. Most
of patients in our study presented as neutrophilia and lymphopenia on admission,
specifically reduced CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cell counts were observed in some
patients. A high NLR was also observed on the admission and 24 hours before the
death. These results, consistent with the previous findings found in the patients with
severe illness, suggest perturbation of immune system contribute the pathogenesis of
SARS-CoV-2. These observations could be also explained why older males with
comorbidities likely succumb to COVID-19.

Our study has some limitations. Firstly, some patients did not receive timely
supportive interventions such as admission to ICU, because increasing number of
severe patients occurred in a short period. However, present data could partially be
scenario where COVID-19 patients progress in a natural pathophysiology rather than
outcome from intervention by treatment. Secondly, consecutive detection of cytokines
was lacking, which fail to truly monitor the severity of CRS. Thirdly, organ damage
could originate from a history of medication including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, antibiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine which are associated with renal or
liver injury.21,22 In our study, all patients received intravenous of antibiotics and
anti-virus drugs.

Overall, from the point of view of the causes of death, we presented the clinical
characteristics of patients with COVID-19. Lung injury begins with an insult to the
lung epithelium mainly attacked by SARS-CoV-2 itself because of ACE2 expressed
in the lungs, which leads to most common respiratory failure. Other organs or tissues,
more or less, are potentially damaged through direct attack from SARS-CoV-2. In

addition, damages of multiple systems including the lungs, might originate with
systemic damage due to CRS following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Considering the
pandemic potential and moderate threaten of COVID-19 for population with multiple
underlying diseases, further studies are required to focus on pathology and
pathophysiology of tissue injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially on the
activation process of immune response and cytokines storm.
