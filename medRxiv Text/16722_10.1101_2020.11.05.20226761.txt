Abstract

21

Background

22

The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute

23

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly heterogenous. Studies have

24

reported that males and some ethnic groups are at increased risk of death from COVID-

25

19, which implies that individual risk of death might be influenced by host genetic

26

factors.

27

Methods

28

In this project, we consider the mortality as the trait of interest and perform a genome-

29

wide association study (GWAS) of data for 1,778 infected cases (445 deaths, 25.03%)

30

distributed by the UK Biobank. Traditional GWAS failed to identify any genome-wide

31

significant genetic variants from this dataset. To enhance the power of GWAS and

32

account for possible multi-loci interactions, we adopt the concept of super-variant for the

33

detection of genetic factors. A discovery-validation procedure is used for verifying the

34

potential associations.

35

Results

36

We find 8 super-variants that are consistently identified across multiple replications as

37

susceptibility loci for COVID-19 mortality. The identified risk factors on Chromosomes

38

2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 16, and 17 contain genetic variants and genes related to cilia dysfunctions

39

(DNAH7 and CLUAP1), cardiovascular diseases (DES and SPEG), thromboembolic

40

disease (STXBP5), mitochondrial dysfunctions (TOMM7), and innate immune system

42

downregulated gene after infecting human bronchial epithelial cells with SARS-CoV2.

Conclusions

44

Eight genetic variants are identified to significantly increase risk of COVID-19 mortality

45

among the patients with white British ancestry. These findings may provide timely

evidence and clues for better understanding the molecular pathogenesis of COVID-19

and genetic basis of heterogeneous susceptibility, with potential impact on new

Introduction

61

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by the severe

62

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pneumonia was first

63

reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, followed by an outbreak

64

across the country [1, 2]. As of September 8th, 2020, the pandemic of COVID-19 has

65

rapidly spread worldwide and caused over 27 million infected cases and 891,000 deaths

66

(3.3%) according to JHU COVID-19 dashboard [3]. Currently, the effective therapeutic

67

measures available to counteract the SARS-CoV-2 are limited. While studies have been

68

dedicated to investigating the clinical features, epidemiological characteristics of

69

COVID-19 [4-11], and genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 [12], few are through

70

the lens of statistical genetics and the host genetic factors contributing to COVID-19

71

remain largely enigmatic [13, 14]. Moreover, the severity of COVID-19 and course of the

72

infection is highly heterogenous. The majority of COVID-19 cases only have mild or no

73

symptoms, while some of the patients develop serious health outcomes. A UK cross-

74

sectional survey of 20,133 patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 showed that

75

patients with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, or chronic respiratory

76

diseases were at higher risk of death [15]. More importantly, evidence has shown that

77

males and some ethnic groups have increased risk of death from COVID-19 [16-20].

78

These observations suggest that there might be host genetic determinants which

79

predispose the subgroup of patients to more severe COVID-19 outcomes. Undoubtedly,

80

there is an urgent need for understanding host genetic basis of heterogeneous

81

susceptibility to COVID-19 and uncovering genetic risk factors. Current studies mainly

82

focus on investigating associations between host genetic factors and infection or

83

respiratory failure [13, 14]. Obviously, infection may only be partially explained by

84

genetic factors since exposure to the virus could be more important. Here, we consider

85

the mortality as the trait of interest for our analysis.

86

As of early August 2020, UK Biobank [21, 22] has released the testing results of

87

COVID-19 for 12,428 participants, including 1,778 (14.31%) infected cases with 445

88

deaths related to COVID-19. This dataset accompanied by already available health care

89

data, genetic data and death data offers a unique resource and timely opportunity for

90

learning the host genetic determinants of COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and

91

mortality.

92

In this project, we perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) exploiting the

93

concept of super-variates in statistical genetics to identify potential risk loci contributing

94

to the COVID-19 mortality. A super-variant is a combination of alleles in multiple loci in

95

analogue to a gene. However, in contrast to a gene that refers to a physically connected

96

region of a chromosome, the loci contributing to a super-variant is not restricted by its

97

spatial location in the genome [23-25]. The rationale behind our analysis is two-fold:

98

First, COVID-19 infections require environmental exposure and the genetic contribution

99

may be limited relative to the environmental exposure, and the mortality may have a

100

stronger genetic effect. Second, COVID-19 is a complex syndrome, which may reflect

101

interacting genomic factors, and our analysis with super-variants enables leveraging gene

102

interactions beyond the additive effects.

105

Sample processing and genotype quality control

106

We analyze the COVID-19 data released by UK Biobank (Category ID: 100091) [22] on

107

August 3rd, 2020, which include in total 1,778 of COVID-19 infected cases. Here, we

108

consider an infected case as a sample with any positive PCR test result or a death with

109

virus found. Among infected cases, 445 of them were reported death caused directly or

110

indirectly by COVID-19 and the remainder of 1333 patients are survivors. In our

111

analysis, to limit the potential effect of population structure, we focus on samples from

112

white British ancestry. After standard sample quality controls, there remain 1096 of

113

COVID-19 infected participants, of which 292 were deaths (26.64%) and 804 were

114

survivors. Their imputed genotype data (Field ID: 22801-22822) and clinical variables

115

including gender and age (Field ID: 31, 34) are all accessible from UK Biobank [21].

116

Our analysis makes use of imputed single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets from

117

UK Biobank. SNPs with duplicated names and positions are excluded. After standard

118

genotyping quality control, where variants with low call rate (missing probability ≥ 0.05)

119

and disrupted Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p-value < 1x10-6) are removed, we retain in

120

total 18,617,478 SNPs. We divide the whole SNP dataset into 2734 non-overlapping

121

local sets according to the physical position so that each set consists of SNPs within a

122

segment of physical length 1 Mb.

123

Statistical analysis

124

We consider the concept of super-variant for GWAS. A super-variant is a combination of

125

alleles in multiple loci, but unlike a gene that refers to a physically connected region of

126

chromosome, the loci contributing to a super-variant can be anywhere in the genome [24,

127

25]. The super-variant is suggested to be powerful and stable in association studies as it

128

aggregates the strength of individual signals. In addition, it accounts for potential

129

complex interactions between different genes even when they are located remotely. To

130

identify significant super-variants, a local ranking and aggregation method is adopted.

131

Chromosomes are divided into local SNP sets. Within each set, random forest technique

132

is utilized to obtain the so-called depth importance measure of each SNP which leads to a

133

ranking of SNPs in terms of their importance. Top SNPs within each local set are then

134

aggregated into a super-variant. In addition, two modes of transmission, dominant and

135

recessive modes are both considered for the super-variant identification. We refer the

136

readers to [25] for details.

137

Our analysis considers the following discovery-validation procedure. The complete

138

dataset is randomly divided into two sets, one for discovery and the other for verification.

139

Each set consists of 146 deaths and 402 survivors. We apply the aforementioned ranking

140

and aggregation method for super-variant identification on the discovery dataset. After

141

the discovery of the super-variants, we then investigate their associations with the death

142

outcomes of COVID-19 through logistic regression in the verification and complete

143

datasets. Age and gender are considered in the regression analyses as confounders to

144

remove potential bias. We use 1.83x10-5 (i.e., 0.05/2734) as the threshold for super-

145

variant-level association on the discovery dataset since 2,734 SNP sets are considered. A

146

super-variant is verified if its logistic regression coefficient achieves the level of 0.05

147

significance on the verification dataset and super-variant-level significance on the

148

complete dataset.

149

To ascertain the stability of the associations, we repeat the above procedure for 10 times,

150

and retain the verified super-variants and their contributing SNPs. Finally, for super-

151

variants that are consistently verified across multiple runs, we conduct Cox regressions

152

with adjustment for age and gender in the complete dataset to further validate their

153

associations.

154
155

Results

156

We find 216 different verified super-variants across 10 repetitions of the discovery-

157

validation procedure. More importantly, there are two super-variants, chr6_148 and

158

chr7_23, identified in 4 out of 10 repetitions. In addition, there are 6 super-variants,

159

chr2_197, chr2_221, chr8_99, chr10_57, chr16_4 and chr17_26 identified in 3 out of 10

160

repetitions. According to the binomial distribution, the probability of a super-variant

161

being verified in 4 (3) out of 10 repetitions by chance is at most 0.00096 (0.0105) if p-

162

value in the verification dataset is assumed to be uniformly distributed.

163

In terms of the SNPs contributing to these 8 super-variants, there exist SNPs selected

164

multiple times across different repetitions. Specifically, for chr6_148, SNP rs117928001

165

is a contributing SNP in all 4 times when this super-variant is verified, and there are other

166

94 contributing SNPs selected 3 times. Similarly, for chr7_23, SNP rs1322746 is a

167

contributing SNP in 3 repetitions when this super-variant is verified, and other 4 SNPs

168

are selected 2 times. For super-variant chr2_197 which is identified in 3 out of 10

169

repetitions, SNPs rs34011564 and rs71040457 are both contributing SNPs in all 3 times.

170

For chr8_99, SNPs rs4735444 and rs531453964 are contributing SNPs of verified super-

171

variants in all 3 repetitions. SNPs rs117217714, rs2176724, rs9804218 and rs2301762 are

172

contributing SNPs for chr17_26, chr2_197, chr10_57 and chr16_4 in all 3 repetitions

173

when these super-variants are verified, respectively. We calculate minor allele frequency

174

(MAF), odds ratio (OR), and p-value for the contributing SNPs of the 8 super-variants

175

based on the complete dataset. See Table S1 in Additional file 1 for the details of all

176

contributing SNPs which are selected in at least 2 repetitions.

177

We use SNPs which are selected in at least 2 repetitions to representatively form 8 super-

178

variants according to the same mode of transmission (dominant/recessive) when they are

179

discovered. Table 1 gives their effects estimated from univariate logistic regression and

180

Cox regression with adjustment for sex and age in the complete dataset. For the logistic

181

regression, all of them achieve super-variant-level significance (i.e., p-value < 1.83x10-5).

182

The strongest signal in terms of p-value is given by chr7_23 (p-value = 9.5x10-9), and the

183

largest odds ratio appears at chr17_26 (OR = 4.237). For the Cox regression, the largest

184

individual hazards ratio (HR) appears at chr17_26 (HR = 2.956) as well, and the smallest

185

individual p-value is given by chr2_221 (p-value = 5.2x10-9). Table 2 lists the details of

186

representative contributing SNPs with high selection frequency and important gene

187

mapping results of the 8 super-variants. Figure 1 shows that the survival probabilities of

188

the patients with identified super-variants remarkably drop during the first 20 days since

189

testing, suggesting of risk genotypes. Figure 2 presents the survival probabilities stratified

190

by the number of super-variants. The HR of super-variants is 1.778 with 95% CI being

191

[1.593, 1.985], and the associated p-value is 1.1x10-24, while the p-values of sex and age

192

are 1.2x10-2 (HR = 1.489, male) and 2.9x10-18 (HR = 1.107), respectively. The survival

193

probability of patients with more than 3 super-variants dramatically decreases to around

194

0.6 during the first three weeks.

195

In addition, we use a chi-square test for independence to investigate whether there are

196

any gender differences among distribution of these 8 super-variants as well as differences

197

among distribution of contributing SNPs. For super-variants, chr2_197 has p-value

198

0.0579 when all samples are considered. The frequency of presenting this super-variant

199

among males and females is 18.09% and 22.93%, respectively. For contributing SNPs,

200

rs4346407 on chromosome 2 has p-vale 0.050 when all samples are considered, and SNP

201

10:56525802_CT_C has p-value 0.0078 when only death cases are considered. The

202

distributions of these two SNPs are given in Table 3.

203
204

Discussion

205

As the COVID-19 pandemic creates a global crisis of overwhelming morbidity and

206

mortality, it is urgent and imperative to provide insights into how host genetic factors link

207

to clinical outcomes. With the timely release of UK Biobank COVID-19 dataset, we

208

perform a GWAS study for detecting genetic risk factors for COVID-19 mortality.

209

However, due to the limited sample size, the traditional single SNP GWAS has low

210

power in signal detection which is evidenced by the Manhattan plot shown in Figure 3.

211

This traditional association analysis is also conducted on the same samples with white

212

British ancestry and controlled for gender and age. As demonstrated, the traditional single

213

SNP analysis method is unable to detect any genome-wide significant association with

214

commonly used threshold 5x10-8, which motivates us to consider the concept of super-

215

variant for GWAS study.

216

Although the identified super-variants are similarly distributed in males and females, the

217

results presented in Table 3 suggest that males tend to present more minor alleles for two

218

contributing SNPs rs4346407 and 10:56525802_CT_C which potentially increase their

219

risk of COVID-19 mortality. Such a phenomenon of higher risk for males has been

220

reported in recent studies [17, 18, 26, 27].

221

The identified super-variants are mapped to annotated genes. The most interesting signal

222

appears on chromosome 2 in the super-variant chr2_197. Within this super-variant, SNPs

223

rs200008298, rs183712207, and rs191631470 are located in gene DNAH7. This gene

224

encodes dynein axonemal heavy chain 7, which is a component of the inner dynein arm

225

of ciliary axonemes. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include cilia

226

movement and microtubule motor activity. A recently published paper showed that gene

227

DNAH7 is the most downregulated gene after infecting human bronchial epithelial cells

228

with SARS-CoV2 [28]. The authors of that study speculated that the down-regulation of

229

gene DNAH7 causes the reduction of function of respiratory cilia. Our results suggest that

230

COVID-19 patients with variations in gene DNAH7 have higher risk for dying from

231

COVID-19. We hypothesize that the disruption of DNAH7 gene function may result in

232

ciliary dysmotility and weakened mucociliary clearance capability, which leads to severe

233

respiratory failure, a likely cause of COVID-19 death [29]. In addition, within the super-

234

variant chr2_197, SNPs rs4578880 and rs113892140 are located in gene SLC39A10,

235

which encodes a zinc transporter. This gene plays an important role in mediating immune

236

cell homeostasis. It has been reported to facilitate antiapoptotic signaling during early B11

237

cell development [30], modulate B-cell receptor signal strength [31], and control

238

macrophage survival [32].

239

Signal at super-variant chr16_4 is also related to cilia. This super-variant consists of a

240

single SNP rs2301762, which is located in gene CLUAP1. This gene encodes clusterin-

241

associated protein 1. It is an evolutionarily conserved protein required for ciliogenesis

242

[33], and its GO annotations include intraciliary transport involved in cilium assembly.

243

Our findings evidence the importance of respiratory cilia functioning properly in

244

COVID-19 patients, which may be an important site in host-pathogen interaction during

245

SARS-CoV2 infection of airways [34] as well as a potential therapeutic target [35].

246

It is noteworthy that both super-variants chr2_197 and chr16_4 are related to cilia, which

247

plays a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies have reported that the angiotensin-

248

converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptors on oral and nasal epithelium cells are the main

249

portal for SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission [36, 37]. Viral proliferation in the

250

airway disrupts the structure and function of ciliated epithelium, causes ciliary dyskinesia

251

and leads to lower respiratory tract infection [38]. Moreover, it has been reported that

252

dysfunctions in olfactory cilia lead to loss of smell (anosmia), a COVID-19 associated

253

symptom, and coronavirus hijacks the ciliated cells and causes deciliation in the human

254

nasal epithelium [39].

255

Chr2_221 consists of 3 SNPs. SNP rs71040457 is located in the downstream of gene

256

DES (distance = 3322 bp) and the upstream of gene SPEG (distance = 4917 bp). Gene

257

DES encodes a muscle-specific class III intermediate filament. Its GO annotations

258

include protein binding, structural constituent of cytoskeleton, and regulation of heart

259

contraction. Gene SPEG encodes striated muscle enriched protein kinase, whose

260

functions are related to protein kinase activity and muscle cell differentiation. Mutations

261

in both gene DES and SPEG are reported to be associated with cardiomyopathy [40-42].

262

Several studies have reported cardiomyopathy in COVID-19 patients [43, 44], and acute

263

myocardial damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 greatly increases the difficulty and

264

complexity of patient treatment [45].

265

Chr7_23 is composed by five intergenic variant SNPs. Among them, SNP rs55986907 is

266

an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) of gene TOMM7 in multiple tissues,

267

including whole blood, lung, adipose, thyroid, skin, nerve, and esophagus based on the

268

Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database. The gene product of TOMM7 is a subunit

269

of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane, and plays a role in regulating the

270

assembly and stability of the translocase complex [46]. A study discussed that intra and

271

extracellular mitochondrial function can be impacted by SARS-CoV-2, which may be

272

related to the hyper-inflammatory state termed as the “cytokine storm” found in COVID-

273

19 patients, with contributions to the progression and severity of the disease [47]. Super

variant chr6_148 contains 101 SNPs. Eighty-nine of them are located in gene

275

STXBP5and six of them are located in gene STXBP5-AS1. On the one hand, gene

276

STXBP5 encodes a syntaxin 1 binding protein. Its GO annotations include

277

neurotransmitter release and regulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Genome-wide

278

association studies have found the association between STXBP5 and Von Willebrand

279

factor (VWF) plasma level in humans [48, 49], which is a predictor for the risk of

280

myocardial infarction and thrombosis. A study showed that gene STXBP5 inhibits

281

endothelial exocytosis and promotes platelet secretion, and the variation

282

within STXBP5 is a genetic risk for venous thromboembolic disease [50]. COVID-19

283

leads to excessive inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and stasis,

284

which may predispose patients to venous and arterial thrombotic disease [51]. On the

285

other hand, studies have revealed that STXBP5-AS1 encodes a long noncoding RNA,

286

which inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via preventing the

287

phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway against

288

STXBP5 expression in non-small-cell lung carcinoma and gastric cancer cells [52, 53].

289

Our results suggest that the variations within STXBP5/STXBP5-AS1 and the interaction

290

between them may result in increased risk of death among COVID-19 patients through

291

the mechanism related to endothelial exocytosis.

292

Chr17_26 is composed by three intergenic variant SNPs. Among them, SNP rs60811869

293

is an eQTL of gene WSB1 in Artery-Tibial tissue based on the GTEx database. Gene

294

WSB1 encodes a member of the WD-protein subfamily, which is highly expressed in

295

spleen and lung [54]. Its related pathways include innate immune system and Class I

296

MHC mediated antigen processing and presentation. This gene has been reported to

297

function as a Lnterleukin-21(IL-21) receptor binding molecule, which enhances the

298

maturation of IL-21 receptor [55]. Variations in this gene may result in disrupted

299

functions of immune system and lead to higher death rate among COVID-19 patients.

300

Super-variant chr10_57 contains 11 SNPs and all of them are located in gene PCDH15.

301

This gene is a member of the cadherin superfamily, which encodes a Calcium-dependent

302

cell-adhesion protein. Gene PCDH15 is essential for maintenance of normal retinal and

303

cochlear function.

304

Super-variant chr8_99 is composed by 7 SNPs. All the SNPs are located in gene CPQ,

305

which encodes carboxypeptidase Q. GO annotations of this gene include protein

306

homodimerization activity and carboxypeptidase activity.

307

Although the roles of genes PCDH15 and CPQ in viral infection remain largely unclear,

308

our results warrant future investigation to learn the relationship between genetic

309

variations and the severe COVID-19 outcomes.

310

Our study is restricted by the limited sample size. We anticipate a continuous

311

accumulation of data in the following months and plan to iterate our analysis whenever

312

more data become available. Furthermore, we currently focus on the population with

313

white British ancestry of UK Biobank in the analysis, validating the identified risk factors

314

in independent populations from other resources or ethnic groups worth further

315

investigation.

316
317

Conclusions

318

We identify 8 potential genetic risk loci for the mortality of COVID-19. These findings

319

may provide timely evidence and clues for better understanding the molecular

320

pathogenesis of COVID-19 and genetic basis of heterogeneous susceptibility, with

321

potential impact on new therapeutic options.

Figure 3: Manhattan plot of traditional single SNP association analysis based on samples

527

with white British ancestry only and controlled for gender and age. The red horizontal

528

line corresponds to the commonly adopted genome-wide significant level at 5x10-8, and

529

the blue horizontal line gives to the suggestive significant level at 1x10-5. Top SNPs
