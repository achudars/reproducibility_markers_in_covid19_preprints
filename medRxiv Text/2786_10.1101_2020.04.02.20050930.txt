Estimation of the probability of reinfection with COVID-19 coronavirus by
the SEIRUS model
Victor Alexander Okhuese
Department of Mathematics, Nasarawa State University, Keffi – Nigeria
Abstract
With sensitivity of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test used to detect the presence of the
virus in the human host, the global health community has been able to record a great number of
recovered population. Therefore, in a bid to answer a burning question of reinfection in the
recovered class, the model equations which exhibits the disease-free equilibrium (𝑬𝟎 ) state for
COVID-19 coronavirus was developed in this study and was discovered to both exist as well as
satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability with a basic reproductive number
𝑅0 = 0 for and endemic situation. Hence, there is a chance of no secondary reinfections from the
recovered population as the rate of incidence of the recovered population vanishes, that is, 𝐵 = 0.
Furthermore, numerical simulations were carried to complement the analytical results in
investigating the effect of the implementation of quarantine and observatory procedures has on the
projection of the further spread of the virus globally. Result shows that the proportion of infected
population in the absence of curative vaccination will continue to grow globally meanwhile the
recovery rate will continue slowly which therefore means that the ratio of infection to recovery
rate will determine the death rate that is recorded globally and most significant for this study is the
rate of reinfection by the recovered population which will decline to zero over time as the virus is
cleared clinically from the system of the recovered class.

1. INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic may have hit the world in a large scale as predicted in
Victor (2020) and Batista (2020), the ratio of the death to recovery rate has seemingly been a
positive proportion. However, with the sensitivity of the PCR, the presence or the absence of the
virus in a previously infected host is detectable and as the recovery rate has seem to be encouraging
considering the absence of any curative vaccine, the question in every quarters to health workers,
the Center for Disease Control and the World Health Organization has been if reinfection could
occur after a COVID-19 patient has recovered clinically?
A recent study by Victor (2020), Nesteruk (2020) and Ming and Zhang (2020) focuses on the
epidemic outbreak cased by COVID-19 coronavirus due to the global trend of the pandemic with
its origin from mainland China. In his study, Nesteruk (2020) used the popular SIR (SusceptibleInfectious-Removed) model to obtain optimal values for the model parameters with the use of
statistical approach and hence predicated the number of infected, susceptible and removed persons
versus time. This model approach by Nesteruk (2020) has been a major breakthrough in modelling
disease control as used by several authors (Ming and Zhang, (2020) and Victor (2020) among
others). However, although there exist a global interest in knowing the rate of infection that will
occur over time globally, in this study we adopt solutions from Victor (2020) and Victor and
Oduwole (2020) for a new deterministic endemic model (Susceptible – Exposed – Infectious –
Removed – Undetectable – Susceptible: SEIRUS) originally developed for the control of the
prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Africa.
The resulting equations are a system of coupled homogenous differential equations for projecting
the rate of detection of the presence of the virus in the clinically prescribed recovered population.
Numerical experiments with relevant simulation showing how the variation of the reproductive
number (R0) affect the number of infected individuals is carried out as well as a projection for the
rate of reinfection by the recovered class. Conscious effort through evaluating the new
deterministic SEIRUS model is done to reduce the reproductive number (R0) to zero for a possible
halt of the spread of the disease thereby leading to an endemic equilibrium to eradicate the disease
in a later time in the future.

In summary, this study aims to use the new deterministic endemic SEIRUS compartmental model
of the COVID-19 coronavirus dynamics which combines quarantine/observatory procedures and
behavioral change/social distancing in the control and eradication of the disease in the most
exposed sub-population to predict the chances of reinfection by the recovered class in the
population.
The wide spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus and the lack or inefficiency of purposeful and result
based intervention is a great call for other empirical and scientific interventions which seeks to
review strategic models and recommendations of social and scientific research for disease control.
Although previous studies have been tailored towards the epidemiology and the disease-free
equilibrium where the reproductive number of the infectious population is at its barest minimum,
this study seeks to study the evaluative impact of the endemic equilibrium of a new endemic
deterministic model while taking into consideration that possibility of the recovered population
being Undetectable and fit to be moved to the Susceptible compartment which will therefore imply
a zero secondary infection of the disease globally.
Also, this research work will contribute significantly to recent research findings by Victor (2020),
Nesteruk (2020) and Ming and Zhang (2020) as well as inform government, non-government
organizations as well as policy maker’s decision on sustainable policies to prevent the spread of
the disease based on specific age groups of the active population.

2.1 MODEL ASSUMPTIONS
The following assumptions as suggested in Victor (2020) and Victor and Oduwole (2020) helps in
the derivation of the model:
1. There is no emigration from the total population and there is no immigration into the
population. A negligible proportion of individuals move in and out of the population at a
given time.
2. Maturation (or maturity) is interpreted as the period between infection to the period of
symptoms observation (days 1 to 14)
3. The susceptible population are first exposed to a latent class where they can infected or
not.
4. Some infected individuals move to the removed class when they are quarantined for
observatory procedures.
5. The recruitment from the 𝑆-class into the 𝐸-class is through contacts from population in
the I-class to the S-class
6. The recruitment into the 𝑅-class from the 𝐼-class at a rate 𝜎.

7. The recruitment into the 𝑈-class from the 𝑅-class depends on the effectiveness of the
quarantine and observatory procedure at a rate 𝜌.
8. Death is implicit in the model and it occurs in all classes at constant rate 𝜇. However, there
is an additional death rate in the 𝐼 and 𝑅 classes due to infection for both juvenile and
adult sub-population denoted by 𝜑 and 𝜛 respectively.

2.2 MODEL DESCRIPTION
This study uses the deterministic endemic model where a susceptible class is a class that is yet to
be infected, but is open to infection as interactions with members of the 𝐼-class continuous. An
infected individual is one who has contracted the coronavirus and is at some stage of infection. A
removed individual is one that is confirmed to have the virus with its expected symptoms and is
under quarantine while following relevant observatory procedures. A member of the undetectable
class is one that has been removed and does not secrete the virus anymore and has been satisfied
by the WHO standard to be in the undetectable class.
The following diagram describes the dynamic of SEIRUS framework, and will be useful in the
formulation of model equations.

However,
𝑠+𝑒+𝑖+𝑟+𝑢 = 1

(15)

Equations (10) to (14) are the model equations in proportions, which define prevalence of
infection.

3.2 EXISTENCE AND UNIQUENESS OF DISEASE FREE EQUILIBRIUM STATE
(𝑬𝟎 ) OF THE SEIRUS MODEL
The disease-free equilibrium (DFE) state of the endemic SEIRUS model is obtained by setting the
left hand sides of equations (10) – (14) to zero while setting the disease components 𝑒 = 𝑖 = 𝑟 =
𝑢 = 0 leading to equations (15) – (16) below
0=

𝜋(1 − 𝑠)

0=𝑠

(15)
(16)

And substituting (16) into (15) we have;
0=

𝑁

Which

makes
0=𝜋

Then taking (15) where 𝑠 = 0 or
0 = 𝜇 − 𝜇𝑠 − 𝑠 2

(17)

𝐴𝑠 2 + 𝐵𝑠 + 𝐶𝜇 = 0

(18)

Simplifying further gives,

where 𝐴 = 1, 𝐵 = 𝜇 and 𝐶 = −𝜇
−𝜇 ± √𝜇 2 + 4𝜇 −𝜇 ± (𝜇 − 2)

2
∗

Therefore, the solution for the simultaneous equations (18) is given by
(𝑠1∗ , 𝑠2∗ ) = {(0,0), (−1, −𝜇 − 1)}

(19)

Ignoring the native values of 𝑠1∗ and 𝑠2∗ and other stringent conditions, there exist a unique trivial
and disease-free equilibrium states at (𝑠1∗ , 𝑠2∗ ) given by (0,0). The solution (19) satisfies equation
(18) identically.

3.3 STABILITY ANALYSIS OF DISEASE FREE EQUILIBRIUM STATE (𝑬𝟎 )
RECOVERED POPULATION
In the event where patients recover from the COVID-19 coronavirus, it is assumed so far that they
are disease-free at least from 14 days after their last clinical test shows that they have clinically
recovered from the virus. Hence, in order to study the behavior of the systems (10) – (14) around
the disease-free equilibrium state 𝐸0 = [0,0,0,0,0], we resort to the linearized stability approach
from Victor (2020) gives us a Jacobian 𝐽𝐸0 transformation of the form;

Hence, according to (Gerald, 2012, p255), the Determinant of the Jacobian Matrix 𝑱𝑬𝟎 is given by
the recursive definition for a 5 × 5 matrix defined as;
𝐷𝑒𝑡(𝐽𝐸0 ) = 𝑎11 𝑑𝑒𝑡(𝐽𝐸0 11 ) − 𝑎12 𝑑𝑒𝑡(𝐽𝐸0 12 ) + 𝑎13 𝑑𝑒𝑡(𝐽𝐸0 13 ) − ⋯ ± 𝑎5 𝑑𝑒𝑡(𝐽𝐸0 5 ) (21)
And from (20)
𝐷𝑒𝑡(𝐽𝐸0 ) > 0

Similarly from the Trace of the Jacobian matrix (𝑱𝑬𝟎 ) given in equation (20) we have that
𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒(𝑱𝑬𝟎 ) = −

5𝜋
− (𝜎 + 𝜇 + 𝜑) − (𝜌 + 𝜇 + 𝜛) − (𝜇 + 𝜀) > 0
𝑁

(23)

Hence, since 𝐷𝑒𝑓(𝑱𝑬𝟎 ) > 0 and 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒(𝑱𝑬𝟎 ) < 0 which does satisfy the prescribed threshold
criteria based on Gerald (2012), then the disease free equilibrium (𝑬𝟎 ) for COVID-19 coronavirus
does satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability for the recovered population.
This implies that as a pandemic as declared by WHO (2020) the COVID-19 coronavirus does not
have a curative vaccine yet and precautionary measures are advised through quarantine and
observatory procedures. Therefore, for the recovered population the chances reinfection appears
to be uncertain though closely impossible unless regular clinical test is not accurately administered.

3.4 COMPUTATION OF THE BASIC REPRODUCTIVE NUMBER (𝑹𝟎 ) OF THE
MODEL
The Basic Reproductive number (𝑅0 ) is deﬁne as the number of secondary infections that one
infectious individual would create over the duration of the infectious period, provided that
everyone else is susceptible. 𝑅0 = 1 is a threshold below which the generation of secondary cases
is insuﬃcient to maintain the infection in human community. If 𝑅0 < 1, the number of infected
individuals will decrease from generation to next and the disease dies out and if 𝑅0 > 1 the number
of infected individuals will increase from generation to the next and the disease will persist.
To compute the basic reproductive number (𝑅0 ) of the model with incidence rate for the recovered
population assumed to vanish such that 𝐵 = 0 and we employ the next generation method as
applied by Diekmann et. al., (2009), Van den Driessche and Watmough (2002).

Solving the characteristics equation for the eigenvalues 𝛾1,2, where 𝑅0 is the maximum of the two
eigenvalues 𝛾1,2. Hence the Basic Reproductive number is the dominant eigenvalues of 𝐹𝑉 −1.
Thus we have that
𝑅0 = 0

(26)

The Basic Reproductive number (𝑅0 = 0) by Equation (33) shows that with no incidence rate in
the recovered population, there is no chances secondary infection by COVID-19 coronavirus
patients who have been clinically declared negative and free from the virus with the virus
completely cleared from their system. Hence although there currently exist no clinical vaccine for
the cure of COVID-19 coronavirus, with Equation (33) there is a high chance of no case of
reinfection after clinical recovery from the virus.

4. DESCRIPTION AND VALIDATION OF BASELINE PARAMETERS FOR
GLOBAL CASES OF COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS
According to the WHO (2020), the total cases of COVID-19 coronavirus worldwide stands: about
900,000, with a total of about 190,000 recovery and the current total deaths is about 44,000 from
about 172 countries.

4.1 NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS OF THE MODEL
The age-structured deterministic model (10) – (14) was solved numerical using Runge-KuttaFehllberg 4-5th order method and implemented using Maple Software. The model equations were
first transformed into proportions, thus reducing the model equations to ten differential equations.
The parameters used in the implementation of the model are shown in Table 1 below. Parameters
were chosen in consonance with the threshold values obtained in the stability analysis of the
disease free equilibrium state of the model.

Hence from Equation (26) the Reproductive Number 𝑅0 = 0 means there is a 100% chances of
zero secondary reinfection from the recovered compartment of the COVID-19 patient group when
a re-infectious population interact by contact with the susceptible population.

Figure 2: Chart of the rate of reinfection of the recovered compartment from COVID-19
Figure 1, clearly shows that the infectious rate will continue to rise steadily over a long period of
time and there after begin to slide in a normal trajectory if no vaccine is in place. However, with
the various make shift treatment, social distancing and quarantine strategy being adopted the
recovery rate will keep rising slowly but steadily over a long period of time. Therefore, as the
recovery rate continues to grow steadily the number of recovered population who have been
clinically declared free of the virus by the Polymerase Chain Reaction test will be also declared
un-infectious as long as the virus is completely cleared from their system (see Figure 2) and the
rate of detection will vanish, making the rate of secondary infection 𝑅0 = 0 as long as the incidence
rate 𝐵 = 0.

CONCLUSIONS
The model equations which exhibits the disease-free equilibrium (𝑬𝟎 ) state for COVID-19
coronavirus exist and hence satisfies the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability when
the basic reproductive number 𝑅0 = 0 for and endemic situation. This implies that as a pandemic
as declared by WHO (2020) the COVID-19 coronavirus does not have a curative vaccine yet and
precautionary measures are advised through quarantine and observatory procedures. The basic
reproductive number was found to be 𝑅0 = 0 and hence shows that there is a high chance of no
secondary infections from the recovered population as the rate of incidence of the recovered
population vanishes, that is, 𝐵 = 0.
Furthermore, numerical simulations were carried to complement the analytical results in
investigating the effect of the implementation of quarantine and observatory procedures has on the
projection of the further spread of the virus globally. Result shows that the proportion of infected
population in the absence of curative vaccination will continue to grow globally meanwhile the
recovery rate will continue slowly which therefore means that the ratio of infection to recovery
rate will determine the death rate that is recorded globally and most significant for this study is the
rate of reinfection by the recovered population which will decline to zero over time as the virus is
cleared clinically from the system of the recovered class..
However, unless there is a dedicated effort from individual population, government, health
organizations, policy makers and stakeholders, the world would hardly be reed of the COVID-19
coronavirus and further spread is eminent and the rate of infection will continue to increase despite
the increased rate of recovery until a curative vaccine is developed.
