ABSTRACT
Respiratory disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia first
emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and spread rapidly to other
provinces and other countries. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for
SARS-CoV and has been suggested to be also the receptor for 2019-nCoV. Paradoxically, ACE2
expression in the lung protects mice from SARS-CoV spike protein induced lung injury by
attenuating the renin-angiotensin system. In the intestine, ACE2 also suppresses intestinal
inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and
ecology of the gut microbiome. Upon analysis of single cell-RNA sequencing data from control
subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we found that ACE2
expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection,
innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein
translation, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation. In summary, we
suggest that ACE2 may play dual roles in mediating the susceptibility and immunity of 2019nCoV infection.

Patients infected by 2019-nCoV can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and
sepsis. However, there is mounting evidences that the gastrointestinal tract may be an alternative

route for 2019-nCoV infection. One (3%) of the first 41 reported cases had diarrhea [1]. In
another report describing a familial cluster, 2 of the 6 family members (33%) developed
diarrhea[2]. Furthermore, positive 2019-nCoV was detected from the stools of a patient with
loose of bowel movement in the United States [3].

There have been many studies on the proteins associated with host entry by the SARS-CoV.
Cleavage of Spike protein by tissue factor Xa is required for the infectivity of SARS-CoV [4].
Rivaroxaban is an oral anticoagulant used to combat acute pulmonary embolism with or without
deep-vein thrombosis [5]. As an Xa inhibitor, it may thus offer protection for 2019-nCoV
pneumonia. Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the SARS-CoV receptor [6]. It also
has been linked to 2019-nCoV infection; ACE2 interacts with the Spike protein and mediates
2019-nCoV infection of the type II alveolar cells of the lung [7].

Paradoxically, although ACE2 mediates viral entry to the host, its deficiency worsens lung injury
by activating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in experimental models [6]. The circulating
RAS regulates blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. Local tissue-based RAS exacerbates
pulmonary hypertension, acute lung injury and experimental lung fibrosis [8]. Thus, blocking of
the Angiotensin II receptor type I (AT1R) was associated with reduced SARS-CoV spike protein
mediated lung injury [6] and reduced pulmonary hypertension in experimental models [9]. The
AT1R blocker valsartan has recently been reported to improve clinical outcomes for patients
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) complicated with pulmonary hypertension
(DOI:10.1183/13993003.congress-2019.PA2469). In the PARADIGM-HF trial, valsartan and the

neprilysin inhibitor prodrug sacubitril (Valsartan/sacubitril, branded Entresto by Novartis) also
significantly reduced mortality and hospitalization for patients with heart failure [10].

Apart from the lung, ACE2 is also associated with gut function. ACE2 expression in the gut
epithelial cells is required for maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide
expression and the ecology of gut microbiome in the intestine [11, 12]. We had previously
generated a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from control subjects and those with colitis or
IBD [13]. Using this dataset, we examined ACE2 expression and found that it was specifically
and highly expressed by the colonocytes (Figure 1 A-B). Compared with other epithelial
subtypes, colonocytes overexpressed genes regulating viral entry, budding and releasing from the
host cells (VAPA, CHMP4C, CHMP1A, CHMP2B, CHMP4B, CHMP1B, VPS37B, PDCD6IP,
VPS4B, CHMP3, VPS28, CHMP2A, PVRL2, CDH1, and MVB12A). Genes involved in nucleic
acid sensing and type I, type III interferon signaling (R2RX4, DDX58, NLRC5, IFNAR2, IFNGR1
and IFNGR2), pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine (IL18, IL32, CXCL16, CXCL3, CXCL2,
CXCL1, CCL28, CCL20) production, antigen presentation via MHC class I molecules (HLA-A,
HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-E) and cytokine receptors (IL2G, IL10RB, and IL6R) were also
enriched in colonocytes (Figure 1C).

Given that ACE2 plays dual roles in mediating viral entry and preventing tissue injury [6, 11, 12,
14], we analyzed genes that are co-expressed with ACE2 in the colonic epithelial cells. In total,
3420 and 2136 genes were positively and negatively correlated with ACE2 expression,
respectively (Supplementary table 1 and Figure 2A). In Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, genes
positively correlated with ACE2 expression were enriched in viral infection and egress (viral

budding via host ESCRT complex, positive regulation of viral release from host cells, viral entry
into host cells), innate immune responses (type I interferon signaling pathway and toll-like
receptor signaling pathway), NK and T cell cytotoxicity (interferon-gamma-mediated signaling
pathway, regulation of natural killer cell mediated immunity, positive regulation of T cell
mediated cytotoxicity), energy metabolism (triglyceride biosynthetic process, pyruvate metabolic
process, NADH metabolic process, mitochondrial electron transport), inflammation and
apoptosis (positive regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling and positive regulation
of apoptotic signaling pathway). In contrast, genes negatively correlated with ACE2 were
enriched for humoral immunity (positive regulation of B cell activation, antibacterial humoral
response, mature B cell differentiation, B cell receptor signaling pathway, immunoglobulin
production), protein translation (ribosomal big and small subunit assembly and translational
initiation), phagocytosis (Fc-epsilon receptor signaling pathway, Fc-gamma receptor signaling
pathway involved in phagocytosis, phagocytosis recognition) and classical pathway of
complement activation (Figure 2B).

Discussion
Here we report the expression pattern of ACE2 in the human intestine at single-cell resolution.
Our data suggest that ACE2 is specifically expressed by colonocytes and positively associated
with viral entry and egress, consistent with observations that the gastrointestinal tract is a
potential route for 2019-nCoV infection. In supportive of the view that ACE2 expression
prevents intestinal inflammation [11, 12], bioinformatic analysis suggested that genes regulating
type I and type III innate immunity, NK and T cell mediated cytotoxicity and energy metabolism
are positively associated with ACE2 expression. By contrast, humoral immunity, phagocytosis

and complement activation are negatively associated with ACE2 expression. These findings may
facilitate concurrent and future investigations of the nature and function of the immune system at
systemic and local levels in patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia.

Notably, SARS-CoV spike protein engagement downregulates ACE2 expression and activates
the RAS [6]. Given that hypertension is common in severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia [1], it is
highly likely that the RAS is activated in the lungs of patients with severe pneumonia. The Xa
inhibitor Rivaroxaban [5] and the AT1R blocker valsartan (DOI:10.1183/13993003.congress2019.PA2469) are effective in relieving pulmonary injury and embolism in experimental models
and clinical trials, their efficacy in treating 2019-nCoV may worth consideration. Dipyridamole
is another anti-coagulation drug. In a pilot trial, dipyridamole administration promoted mucosal
healing and improved clinical symptoms in patients with colitis or IBD [13]. More importantly,
published clinical studies [15-20], including those conducted in China (DOI:
CNKI:SUN:XIYI.0.2010-12-026;[21]; CNKI:SUN:YXLT.0.2014-32-031), have demonstrated
that dipyridamole has broad spectrum antiviral activity against virus infections. It may also be
worth investigating the therapeutic effects of dipyridamole in patients infected by 2019-nCoV.

Helsinki Declaration. Informed written consents from the legal guardians of all participants were
obtained before conducting these procedures.

Single cell RNA sequencing data analysis
Colonic biopsies from 17 children (6 control, 6 colitis, 2 ulcerative colitis, 3 Crohn's disease)
were subjected to single-cell suspension preparation, 5 ' gene expression libraries construction,
and 10x Genomics single-cell RNA sequencing [13]. Cellranger v2.1 pipeline (10x genomics)
was utilized to demultiplex the cellular barcodes and align reads to the human transcriptome
(build GRCh38). The unique molecular identifier (UMI) count matrix was converted to Seurat
object using the R package Seurat v2.3.4 [22]. After quality control and data normalization,
dimension reduction and cell clustering were performed [13]. Different cell types were identified
by mapping canonical marker genes in the two-dimensional t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor
embedding (tSNE) map [13].

Co-expression analysis
Normalized single-cell RNA expression data was used for co-expression analysis. Pearson's
correlation analysis was performed between each gene in the single-cell transcriptome and ACE2.
Significantly correlated genes were chosen (p-value<0.05) for downstream GO enrichment
analysis via GENEONTOLOGY at http://geneontology.org/. GO terms with False Detection
Rate (FDR) <0.05 were selected.
