Abstract

24

Background: Monitoring the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of the disease is

25

useful in determining whether there is sustained transmission in a population. In this

26

study, we examined Rt of COVID-19 and compared its transmissibility between different

27

intervention periods in Hangzhou and Shenzhen.

28

Methods: Daily aggregated counts of confirmed imported and local cases between

29

January 1, 2020 and March 13, 2020 were analysed. A likelihood function was

30

constructed to estimate Rt, accounting for imported cases.

31

Results: Although Hangzhou had fewer number of cases than Shenzhen, Shenzhen had

32

higher proportion of imported cases than Hangzhou (83% vs 29%). Since the epidemic of

33

COVID-19 in Shenzhen was dominated by imported cases, Rt was kept below unity

34

through time. On the contrary, Rt was greater than unity in Hangzhou from 16 January to

35

7 February due to the surge in local cases. Credits to the Wuhan lockdown and outbreak

36

response measures following the local lockdown, Rt decreased steadily and dropped

37

below unity in mid-February.

38

Conclusion: The lockdown measures and local outbreak responses helped reduce the

39

potential of local transmission in Hangzhou and Shenzhen. Meanwhile, cities with similar

40

epidemic trend could have different transmission dynamics given the variation in

41

imported cases.

Backgrounds

46

Coronaviruses are a diverse group of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA

47

viruses that belongs to the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales [1]. The diseases

48

caused by these viruses are zoonotic in nature, which can be transmitted between animals

49

and human [2]. In human, coronaviruses mainly cause respiratory tract infections with

50

severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)

51

being two notable examples. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus that has not

52

been previously identified in human emerged and caused an outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei

53

province, China [3]. The disease responsible for the outbreak has been officially named

54

by the World Health Organization as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Common

55

clinical manifestation of COVID-19 includes fever, fatigue, dry cough, shortness of

56

breath and muscle ache [4,5]. In severe cases, COVID-19 may progress to pneumonia or

57

even death. Symptoms such as headache, dizziness, sputum production, haemoptysis,

58

diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are less common but occasionally reported. According to

59

the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 is mainly spread from

60

person-to-person via respiratory droplets, but may also be spread from contact with

61

infected surfaces or objects [6]. At the moment, there is no vaccine nor specific antiviral

62

treatment approved for COVID-19.

63

The current global scale health crisis triggered by COVID-19 began on 31 December

64

2019, the day the World Health Organization was notified of several severe and unusual

65

cases of pneumonia in Wuhan. Despite the suspected source of transmission (Huanan

66

Seafood Wholesale Market) was shut down the next day, number of cases continued to

67

expand at an alarming rate [7]. Health experts soon identified the cause of the disease as

68

being a novel coronavirus that can be spread via airborne droplets and announced the

69

discovery on 7 January 2020. Two days later, the first related death was recorded in

70

Wuhan; meanwhile, the disease spread outside Hubei as people travel around and outside

71

the country, especially during "Chunyun", a 40-day period when Chinese people going

72

home to celebrate the Lunar New Year holidays. On 13 January 2020, Thailand reported

73

the first lab-confirmed case of COVID-19 outside mainland China and health authorities

74

of 19 other countries confirmed cases over the following days [8]. By 31 January 2020, a

75

total of 9,826 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed around the globe and the figure

76

surpassed 10,000 the next day.

77

To halt the spread of the virus, the Chinese government imposed a complete lockdown in

78

Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province on 23 January 2020 aiming to quarantine the

79

epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak [9]. All public transportation, including buses,

80

railways, flights, and ferry services, was suspended and residents were forbidden from

81

leaving the city without permission from the authorities. Later, the government tightened

82

its quarantine measures and imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine on people returning

83

to the capital from holidays. Meanwhile, a number of countries have imposed restrictions

84

on entry by travellers from China in response to the epidemic. Several early

85

investigations have shown that the shutdown of cities largely reduced the spread of

86

infections to other cities in China and other countries around the world [10-13].

87

Time-varying reproduction number (Rt) is defined as the average number of secondary

88

cases infected by a primary case at time t. Rt is a common measure for monitoring the

89

disease evolution in a population especially when some control measures have been

90

carried out to mitigate an epidemic. Rt below unity indicates a single case is unable to

91

produce more than one secondary case on average and the disease can unlikely be

92

sustained in a population over time. In this case, the outbreak can be regarded as under

93

control at time t [14]. In this study, we examined the transmission dynamics of COVID-

94

19 during the first wave of epidemic and compared its transmissibility between different

95

intervention periods in Hangzhou and Shenzhen, two Chinese cities with different

96

transmission dynamics of imported cases.

97

Methods

98

Setting

99

Hangzhou and Shenzhen are two major Chinese cities in terms of economy, population

100

and transportation. Hangzhou is the capital city of Zhejiang Province and one of the most

101

populous cities in East China. In 2018, the city's resident population was 9.8 million with

102

an estimation of 4 million floating population [15]. With 16,424 km length of highways,

103

well-developed railway transportation and 286 civil aviation routes between 160

104

domestic cities, the passenger traffic of Hangzhou was over 20 million in 2018 [16].

105

Similar to Hangzhou, Shenzhen is also a new-growing city characterized by high-

106

technology industry, large population of “migrant workers” and well-developed

107

transportation network. Located in Guangdong Province, it covers an area of around

108

2,000 km2 and is the most populous city in South China. In 2018, the number of people

109

living in Shenzhen was estimated to be 25.7 million, among whom less than half were

110

long-term residents [17].

111

Wuhan, the source city of COVID-19, was lockdown on 23 January 2020. On the same

112

day, Hangzhou and Shenzhen declared first-level public health emergency in response to

113

the outbreak. Measures including promotion of personal hygiene, cessation of crowd

114

gathering activities, 7-day home quarantine of people from Hubei, restrictions of public

115

transports and mandatory quarantine for close contacts were adopted. On 4 February

116

2020, a lockdown was imposed in Hangzhou and only one person per household is

117

allowed to leave their home every two days. Public gatherings such as funerals and

118

weddings were banned; all public venues and work places were closed. On 7 February

119

2020, all living communities in Shenzhen were requested to lockdown in order to contain

120

the local outbreak [18].

121

Data collection

122

We obtained the daily aggregated data of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases in

123

Hangzhou and Shenzhen between January 1, 2020 and March 13, 2020 from the National

124

Health Commission and other official websites [18-20]. The date of illness onset (defined

125

by the first appearance of COVID-19 related symptoms) was used to construct the

126

epidemic curves. Cases with travel history to other provinces (with ≥1 case reported) 14

127

days prior to symptoms onset are defined as import cases.

128

Estimation of reproduction numbers

129

Since the COVID-19 was seeded by the imported cases in many cities outside Hubei, the

130

estimation equation from Thompson et al. [21], an alternative to Wallinga and Teunis

131

[22], was used, accounting for the risk of imported cases [23].

132

The total number of reported cases (I(t)) on day t (t = 0, 1, 2, 3…) is the sum of imported

133

cases (hI(t)) and local cases (hL(t)). The total number of infections on day t can be

134

computed as

135

∑

t
s =1

ws I (t − s) = ∑ s =1 ws [hL (t − s) + hI (t − s)] ,

136

given ws is a discretized probability distribution function of the serial interval of COVID-

137

19. The expected number of local cases, E[hL(t)], is

138

E[hL (t )] = Rt ∑ s =1 ws [hL (t − s) + hI (t − s)] .

139

Assuming the number of local infections follows a Poisson distribution, a likelihood

140

function, L(·), can be formed as follows

t

L ( Rt ) = ∏

⎟
⎠

142

where nL(t) is the observed numbers of local cases on day t.

143

We used Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to estimate the Rt series based on

144

the observed epidemic curves. Using an early estimate of serial interval [13], we assumed

145

the length of the serial interval follows a lognormal distribution with a mean of 4.4 days

146

and a standard deviation (SD) of 3 days. The sensitivity of results to shorter serial interval

147

of 2.0 days (SD: 2.8) [24] and longer serial interval of 7.5 days (SD: 3.4) [25] was tested.

148

A random walk Metropolis algorithm was used to obtain the posterior distributions of Rt.

149

Step sizes were selected to obtain acceptance proportions of 20 to 40%. Twenty thousand

150

MCMC iterations were used as the burn-in period and subsequent 100,000 iterations were

151

used to obtain the estimates. The median and 95% credible intervals (CIs) were

152

calculated to summarize the estimates. The analysis in this study was carried out using

153

software R (version 3.6.3).

154

Results

155

The temporal distribution of cases and Rts in Shenzhen and Hangzhou were shown in

156

Figure 1 and Figure 2 respectively. Shenzhen had the first imported case with illness

157

onset on 1 January, whereas Hangzhou had the first imported case with illness onset on

13 January. From 1 January to 13 March, there were a total of 169 and 417 confirmed

159

cases in Hangzhou and Shenzhen respectively. Both cities had their peak incidence of

160

cases in the week between 22 and 29 January and the epidemics died out in mid-February.

161

In general, although Hangzhou had a fewer number of cases than Shenzhen, Hangzhou

162

had a lower percentage of imported cases than Shenzhen (29% vs 83%). Due to the

163

epidemic in Shenzhen was dominated by imported cases, local Rt was kept below unity

164

through time. In the early phase of the epidemic, Rt was maintained to be around 0.2 to

165

0.4, indicating a low risk of local transmission despite the rapid increase in daily number

166

of cases before the lockdown of Wuhan (i.e. on 23 January). After the lockdown of

167

Wuhan and the initialization of measures in response to the outbreak, local transmission

168

was well-controlled as indicated by a low estimated value of Rt (i.e. < 0.2).

169

In contrast, Rt was larger than unity in Hangzhou from 16 January to 7 February. Before

170

the lockdown of Wuhan, Rt obtained ranged from 1.9 to 3.8, indicating a high risk of

171

local transmission. Credits to the Wuhan lockdown and outbreak response measures

172

following the local lockdown, Rt dropped steadily and was 1.14 (95% CI: 1.04 to 1.25) on

173

4 February. After that, Rt kept decreasing slightly and dropped below unity on 10

174

February, indicating the outbreak was controlled in Hangzhou.

175

Sensitivity analysis was used to assess the robustness of estimated Rt to different serial

176

interval durations (Figure 3). While a variation in the length of serial interval did not

177

affect the estimated Rts in Shenzhen overall, a moderately increased Rt was observed for

178

Hangzhou during the first week when a longer serial interval was assumed.

180

Monitoring the transmission dynamics as well as the Rt of the disease is useful in 1.

181

determining whether there is sustained community transmission in a population and 2.

182

evaluating whether the control measures taken are adequate to control the local

183

transmission at a specific time [26-28]. In this study, we estimated the imported-cases-

184

adjusted Rt of COVID-19 in the first wave of epidemic in Hangzhou and Shenzhen, two

185

Chinese cities with different transmission dynamics of imported cases. According to our

186

results, the disease transmissibility in both cities gradually decreased over time especially

187

after the lockdown of Wuhan. Credits to the community lockdown, the transmission was

188

interrupted within a short period of time in Hangzhou. In line with Lai et al. [29], inter-

189

city travel restrictions and other social distancing interventions could slow down the

190

epidemics outside Wuhan.

191

We showed that local transmission of COVID-19 seeded by imported cases was not

192

sustained in Shenzhen and we speculated it was likely due to the decrease in number of

193

local susceptibles during Chunyun. Of the 13 million residents in Shenzhen, around 65%

194

of its population were migrants which ranked top in China, and most of the residents have

195

returned to their home towns starting from 10 January for celebration of Lunar New Year

196

[17,30]. Given the number of local susceptibles decreased as a large number of residents

197

left Shenzhen during Chunyun, fewer transmission chains could be established during

198

this period even though Shenzhen is highly connected to Wuhan for most of the times.

199

Tian et al. [11] indicated that Chinese cities that implemented control measures before

200

officials confirmed the first case were more likely to have fewer cases. Even though the

201

first case in Shenzhen was confirmed on 19 January (illness onset on 3 January), we

202

believe Shenzhen is an exception owing to its special population characteristics. In line

203

with Kucharski et al. [31], the case study of Shenzhen supported that introducing one to

204

several cases to a new city may not necessarily lead to an outbreak.

205

Comparing with Shenzhen, Hangzhou is not just a highly populated city with fewer

206

migrants, but is also geographically closer to Wuhan. By implementing strict control

207

measures before cases emerged, local transmissions were comparatively easier to be

208

seeded in Hangzhou. Compared to the transmission dynamics in Wuhan [31], Rt in

209

Hangzhou displayed a consistently declining trend staring from mid-January. This may

210

be due to the increased awareness on the use of personal protective measures against

211

COVID-19 after noticing the unknown pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan in early January

212

through social media. Similar transmission dynamics was also reported in Shaanxi

213

province [32].

214

In this study, we showed that even though more cases were reported in Shenzhen when

215

compared to Hangzhou, they exhibited different transmission dynamics of COVID-19

216

when the risk of imported cases was accounted in the estimation. With more local cases

217

emerged during the initial phase of the epidemic, the disease sustained in Hangzhou

218

before the lockdown of Wuhan and the initiation of outbreak response. For cities or

219

provinces with a large proportion of imported cases, failing to differentiate them from

220

local cases during Rt calculation may lead to overestimation of transmissibility in a local

221

population [33], and thus, affect the planning of mitigation measures. The importance of

222

accounting for imported cases has been demonstrated in another study that looked into

223

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in Saudi Arabia [21].

224

Our study has several major limitations. Recent studies have successively reported that

225

some patients infected with COVID-19 might infect others before their symptom onset
10

226

[24,34]. Disease transmission during the pre-symptomatic stage implies the possibility of

227

having a negative value of serial interval. This would affect the formulation of estimation

228

equation since the distributional assumption did not gave it a corresponding probability.

229

Alternatively, a generation interval could be used but it is usually hard to be estimated

230

due to unobserved infectiousness onset. Nevertheless, our sensitivity analysis

231

demonstrated that the variation of serial interval within a reasonable range did not affect

232

our main conclusion. Another limitation is the underreporting of confirmed cases due to

233

the unavailability of virological testing in the early stage of epidemic. According to an

234

early investigation [35], an estimate of 75thousand individuals were found to be

235

infected in Wuhan as of 25 January and we believe similar underreporting was likely to

236

occur in our setting. With detailed data available on reporting rates and serological

237

surveillance, our analytic frame can be extended to a more complex context that

238

incorporates these factors. In addition, our estimates shall be refined if more updated

239

knowledge of the pathogen is available.

240

In conclusion, we showed the lockdown measures and local outbreak responses helped

241

reduce the potential of local transmission in Hangzhou and Shenzhen. The low

242

transmission intensity of COVID-19 in Shenzhen in early January was likely due to the

243

decrease in number of local susceptibles as residents left the city for Chunyun. We also

244

highlighted that cities with similar epidemic trend could have different transmission

245

dynamics given the variation in imported cases.
