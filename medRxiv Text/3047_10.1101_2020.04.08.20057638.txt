Abstract. It has been three months since the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic
outbreak. Many research studies were carried to understand its epidemiological
characteristics in the early phase of the disease outbreak. The current study is yet another
contribution to better understand the disease properties by parameter estimation of
mathematical SIR epidemic modeling. The authors use Johns Hopkins University‚Äôs dataset to
estimate the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 for representative countries (Japan,
Germany, Italy, France, and Netherlands) selected using cluster analysis. As a by-product,
the authors estimate transmission, recovery, and death rates for each selected country and
carry statistical tests to see if there are any significant differences.
Keywords: COVID-19, SIR model, parameter estimation, basic reproduction, doubling
period, clustering
Introduction
Officially named as COVID-19, the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak was
identified first time in Wuhan, China in the late December 2019. It is recognized as a severe
respiratory illness similar to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. A review article (Fan, Zhao, Shi,
& Zhou, 2019) published on March 2, 2019 foresees future SARS- or MERS-like
coronavirus disease to originate from bats find it most likely to start in China.
Shortly it was characterized as a pandemic and World Health Organization (WHO)
declared it to be ‚ÄúPublic Health Emergency of International Concern‚Äù on 30 January 2020.
As of April 8, 2020, over 1,436,833cases of COVID-19 are reported to WHO, from over 209
countries and territories around the world with more than 82,421 fatalities and about 303,721
recovered.

Obtaining epidemiological characteristics such as basic reproduction number, incubation
period, infectious period, and death rate are crucial in better understanding the pandemic
outbreak. Shortly after the first statistics made available, various research studies of COVID19 carried to estimate these parameter values see e.g. (Wu & McGoogan, 2020) (Lai, Shih,
Ko, Tang, & Hsueh, 2020). The study (Zhao, et al., 2020) from January 2020 estimates the
basic reproduction number ‡¨¥ to range from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 5.71 (95%CI: 4.247.54) using ‡¨¥

is the intrinsic growth rate. Another early work (Read,

Bridgen, Cummings, Ho, & Jewell, 2020) estimates R0 to be 3.11 (95%CI, 2.39-4.13) using
deterministic SEIR metapopulation model. The same work estimates the transmission rate ,
to be 1.94 (95%CI, 1.25‚Äì6.71) and infectious period to be 1.61 days (95%CI, 0.35‚Äì3.23)
within Wuhan, China. The review of twelve recent works shows that R0 ranges from 1.4 to
6.49, with a mean of 3.28, a median of 2.79 and interquartile range (IQR) of 1.16 (Liu,
Gayle, Wilder-Smith, & Rockl√∂v, 2020). While early reports of Chinese Center for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest the infectious period to be 9 days, another recent
work (You, et al., 2020) reports the mean infectious period to be 10.91 days (SD=3.95).
For various mathematical models formulated to forecasting the development of the
disease and estimating the parameters we refer to (Rabajante, 2020) and references therein.
Our goal in this article is to estimate death rates for COVID-19 for selected representative
countries and use these parameters to estimate recovery rates and basic reproduction numbers
from a deterministic mathematical model. We then compare these results to see if there are
any significant differences among countries.
This rest of the paper is organized as follows, we introduce the methodology including
data, the mathematical model, and parameter estimation technique. Then comes the results
section where we report our findings. Finally, we end with discussion section where we
interpret the findings and provide recommendations for future research.

This study uses Johns Hopkins University‚Äôs COVID-19 data made available at GitHub
repository (JHU, 2020). The dataset includes confirmed, recovered, and death cases for
almost all countries of the world over the period of January 22, 2019 to March 23, 2020 on a
daily basis. The epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in the USA, South Korea,
Italy, France, China, and Iran are studied and this list of selected countries is based on cluster
analysis.

We note that this is a system of autonomous nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The
nonlinearity term

 is due to law of mass-action, which is the reason for the absence of non-

trivial closed form. However, computer assisted numerical approximations are available.
There are variations of this model where one may include new classes such as exposed and
quarantine and may also consider demographic characteristics such as birth and natural death
rates etc. As our parameter estimations well fit to the current model, we decided to keep it as
is.
Empirical Model Specification

Clustering
Before applying the statistics model ( Least square) and SIR methods , this study verifies the
cluster analysis. As reported above, there are over 184 countries where the COVID-19
outbreak occurred so far. Analyzing each country separately and reporting results in a
research article is not very convenient. Therefore, we decided to run cluster analysis to first
group the countries according to similarity of confirmed cases and then select one
representative country from each cluster.

Here, cluster analysis carried using country

recovery rates () and the country doubling periods of the confirmed cases. The last equation

which can be rewritten in the discretized version as

‡¢ö         .
Both  and  can be computed from the dataset and can be obtained as the slope of the
equation. Before the confirmed case gets very large, one can safely assume that    which
together with the second equation of  gives

We conduct -means cluster analysis which is sensitive to outliers. Hence, we first cleared
outliers from our data using box plot analysis, then used the elbow method to determine the
number of centroids. Finally, the cluster analysis is carried for the normalized variables, zscores, and one representative is selected from each cluster. Moreover, we did not completely
avoid the outliers, instead selected two representative countries one with too high recovery
rate and one with too high doubling period. Once the list of representative countries are
selected, we turn to parameter estimation and prediction.

Parameter estimation
To estimate the parameters

, ,  for

the



system one usually considers nonlinear

least square analysis. However, models are simplified versions of real life systems and are
not always behave well with parameter estimations. What we will do is to estimate

,

parameters using simple linear regression. Then, use these point estimates in the SIR model
to estimate

.

More specifically, we use ‚Äòscipy.integrate.ode‚Äô function of python

programming language to simulate S(t), I(t), and R(t) where we let initial values as
S(0)=country population, I(0)= the first observed number of cases in the country, and
R(0)=0. Then, we call ‚Äòscipy.optimize.curve_fit‚Äô function for least-square fitting of the
theoretical model solution to the observed daily number of confirmed cases and recovered
individuals.
Analysis and results
The countries with fewer data resulted in unrealistic doubling periods and/or almost zero
recovering rates, these countries were eliminated. Eliminating countries with doubling period
more than 10 resulted in 152 countries left. On the other hand, if we eliminate those countries

with very small (<0.0001) recovery rate we are left with only 67 countries. The eliminated
countries are those with few data reports or with missing data for recovered individuals.
Further remaining outliers were cleared using box plot analysis which resulted in 54
countries left. The final box plot results for the 54 countries are shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1. Box plots of recovery rates and case doubling periods

In Figure 2, we see the distributions of both doubling periods and recovery rates. In particular,
we see that the mean doubling period for 54 countries is 3.60 (95%CI: 3.22-3.99).

Elbow method summary is shown in Figure 3.
Here we see that there are five points with sum of
squared distances more than 1. However, since the
total remaining countries are only 54 we decided
to fix the number of clusters to 4.
The bar charts of the z-scores of the variables for

each cluster is shown in Figure 4 and the list of
countries in each cluster is given in Table 1.

Discussion and Conclusion
In this article we considered The Kermack and McKendrick SIR model to estimate COVID-19
19
epidemiological characteristics using Johns Hopkins University dataset over the period from
m
January 22 to March 22. Our approach is purely data-driven without relying any parameters

reported before. 183 countries were divided into 5 clusters classifies according to recovery rates

and case doubling periods and one country was selected from each cluster as a representative.
ve.
The summary of parameter estimation results are given in Table 2. Here we see that the death
th
rate

varies from 0.0035 to 0.1202 with least being Germany and the highest being Italy. One
ne

may expect the similar estimates in within the respective clusters. The reason for such a
significant difference in death rates requires further investigation.

When it comes to parameter estimation using nonlinear epidemic models the recovery rate

is

usually taken to be the inverse of infectious period. However, estimation results reveal, see Table
2, that this rate is varies from 0.0018 to 0.0284 for the representative countries of four clusters.
Taking the inverses yield the range from 35 days to 555 days which is much higher than the
infectious period reported before, see.e.g. (CDC), (You, et al., 2020). This indicates that recovery
rate should not be taken as the inverse of infectious period provided the dataset (JHU, 2020) is
accurate.
As for the basic reproduction number ‡¨¥ , we have 2.36, 2.67, 4.20, 8.47, and 35.74 for the
countries Italy, Japan, France, Netherlands, and Germany respectively. While the first four
estimates are in line with earlier reports of

_0 for COVID-19, we find _0 estimate of 35.74 for

Germany very high. This is consistent with the Germany low death rate of 0.0035 found as death
rate appears in the reciprocal of basic reproduction formula.
One of the limitations of the study is the model, SIR, being theoretical. As a theoretical
model, the forecasting of the pandemic progression from SIR might be misleading. For our five
representative countries we provided the three hundred day simulation in the appendix. What we
see from the simulations that the COVID-19 pandemic is more likely to start slowing down
within 100-150 days starting from January 22. Looking at the times series of Susceptible
individuals we see that over 80% of countries will be affected by the pandemic. However, we
note that our model ignores any kinds of preventative situations and as such it is very likely that
the total affected case will be much lower. It is possible to consider various improvements of the
model where one can include other compartments such as Exposed or Quarantined individuals
and consider non-autonomous system where the transmission rate is controlled according to the
public awareness such as social distancing, self-quarantines, wearing masks etc.
