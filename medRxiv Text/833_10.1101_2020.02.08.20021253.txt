Background: The 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan, China has attracted world-wide attention.
As of February 11, 2020, a total of 44730 cases of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia
associated with COVID-19 were confirmed by the National Health Commission of China.
Methods: Three approaches, namely Poisson likelihood-based method (ML), exponential
growth rate-based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed dynamic
model-based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled
reproduction numbers.
Results: A total of 71 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 67
dates of infections were identified among 5405 confirmed cases outside Hubei as reported by
February 2, 2020. Based on this information, we find the serial interval having an average of
4.41 days with a standard deviation of 3.17 days and the infectious period having an average
of 10.91 days with a standard deviation of 3.95 days.
Conclusions: The controlled reproduction number is declining. It is lower than one in most
regions of China, but is still larger than one in Hubei Province. Sustained efforts are needed to
to below one in order to end the current epidemic.

1. Introduction
On December 29, 2019, Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province in Central China, has
reported four cases of pneumonia with unknown etiology. Since then, the outbreak has rapidly
worsened over a short span of time and has received considerable global attention. On
January 7, 2020, the pathogen of the current outbreak was identified as a novel coronavirus
(2019-nCoV), and its gene sequence was quickly submitted to WHO (The coronavirus was
renamed COVID-19 by WHO on February 12).1,2 On January 30, WHO announced the
listing of this novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCP) as a “public health emergency of
international concern”. As of February 11, 2020, the National Health Commission (NHC) of
China had confirmed a total of 44730 cases of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCP)
associated with the COVID-19 in Mainland China, including 1114 fatalities and 4771
recoveries.
Since January 19, 2020, strict containment measures, including travel restrictions, contact
tracing, entry or exit screening, non-hospital isolation, quarantine, awareness campaigns and
others, have been implemented by the Wuhan Government and quickly adopted by other
cities within China with the aim to minimize virus transmission via human-to-human contact.
Similar measures were previously employed in China in 2009 to tackle the outbreak of H1N1
including mandatory quarantine of anyone who has had close contact with confirmed patients.
This article investigates the change in the basic reproduction number  and controlled
since the outbreak of COVID-19. We have found that the estimated
reproduction number

Province.

2. Data
Data were collected from provincial/municipal health commissions in China as well as
through ministry of health in other countries and regions with details of each confirmed case
including case ID, region, age, gender, date of symptom onset, date of diagnosis, history of
traveling to or residing in Wuhan, and, if any, related remarks such as contact identification,
cases and case-related information. In addition, the collected dataset also contains date of
infection and chains of transmission of infection which can be inferred from travel or
residency history in Wuhan and other relevant information, if available, as follows:
(1) If the individual has not been to Hubei Province recently, but were exposed within a
four-day period (i.e., the individual has had contact with a confirmed case of NCP on a certain
day), then the corresponding date of infection is inferred as the middle of the exposure period;
(2) If the individual has travelled to Hubei Province but has returned within four days, then
the date of infection is inferred as the middle of the travelling period;
(3) If the individual has not been to Hubei Province recently, but in close contact with an
imported case from Hubei, then the individual is identified to be infected by this imported
case;
(4) If the individual has not been to Hubei Province recently, but in close contact with a
local case who was clearly infected before that individual, then this individual is identified to
be infected by the corresponding local case.
Note: if the individual has been to Hubei Province, the transmission history would not be
recorded despite the existence of contact tracing information.

3. Inference about the Serial Interval and Infectious Period
In this study, serial interval is defined as the time difference between dates of infection of
successive cases in a chain of transmission (different textbooks may have different
definitions). Infectious period is the duration of which an infected individual can transmit
pathogens to a susceptible host. In this study, infectious period is defined as the time
difference between date of infection and date of diagnosis as there is strong evidence showing
that a diseased individual remains contagious even during the incubation period, and would
be immediately isolated upon positive diagnosis hence losing the transmissibility. Both are
key quantities that depict an epidemic and are essential to estimate the basic/controlled
reproductive number,  / . Among 139 chains of transmission identified from 5405
confirmed cases outside Hubei as recorded by February 2, 2020, none of them have their
dates of infection acquired, but 71 of them have their dates of symptoms onset available.

Hence, the corresponding serial intervals were approximated by the differences in dates of
symptom onset rather than the actual dates of infection, see Figure 1.

Figure 1: Histogram of serial interval with the average of 4.27 days before correction.
We can see that some serial intervals are negative which is certainly impossible by definition.
However, noting that the serial intervals were approximated from the dates of symptoms onset,
this suggests that the negative values could be caused by different lengths of incubation
period between individuals. Here a simple correction is implemented by resetting the negative
values to zeros. This shifts the average of the serial intervals to 4.41 days and the standard
deviation to 3.17 days after corrections, see table 1. Note that the serial interval of
SARS-nCoV in Hongkong was 8.4 days on average.3 In addition, a total of 67 cases in the
collected data were able to identify the corresponding dates of infection. Figure 2 plots the
histogram of infectious period while Table 2 shows the numerical summary.

We found that there were no significant demographical differences between the subset of
cases used to estimate serial interval and infectious period and the cases in the full dataset.
Therefore, the inference made on serial interval and infectious period based on the
corresponding subsets should be able to represent the full dataset.

4. Estimation of Basic/Controlled Reproduction Number
Definition
The reproduction number  is defined as the (average) number of new infections generated
by one infected individual during the entire infectious period in a fully susceptible
population.4 It can be also understood as the average number of infections caused by a typical
individual during the early stage of an outbreak when nearly all individuals in the population
are susceptible. The basic reproduction number reflects the ability of an infection spreading
under no control. When the size of susceptible population is limited, the quantity, effective
reproduction number  , is used instead of  . Similarly, the quantity, controlled
, should be used to describe the ability of disease spreading when
reproduction number
interventions (such as quarantine, isolation, or traffic control) are taking place. Hence a good
measure of any intervention is to reduce
. Note that the disease will decline and eventually
die out if
 1.

Methods
The basic reproduction number can be estimated through a variety of models.5 In this section,
as shown below.
we have compared three most popular estimates of  /
(1) Poisson Likelihood-based (ML) method
Let  be the number of reported new confirmed cases on day  . Suppose that the serial
interval has a maximum of  days and the number of new cases generated by an infected
individual is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution with parameter  .6 The probability
that the serial interval of an individual in  days is  , which can be estimated from the
empirical distribution of serial interval or by setting up a discretized Gamma prior on it. Thus,
the likelihood function can be reduced into a thinned Poisson

(2) Exponential growth rate-based (EGR) method
At the early period of an epidemic, the number of infected cases rises exponentially. Suppose
the exponential epidemic growth rate (Malthusian coefficient) is , which can be estimated
by fitting a least square line to the daily number of reported new confirmed cases in a
log-scale, namely, log  . Let   denote the probability density function of serial

Therefore, the quantities  and

which suggests an improvement in the current situation. This is possibly due to the
effective interventions and prompt actions by the local and central governments to minimize
compared to other
further spreading. We also notice that EGR yields smaller estimates of
methods. This might be because the number of infected patients does not grow exponentially
after such strict containment measures.

6. Discussion
The dataset used in this study is based on the confirmed cases reported by NHC China.
However, during the period of data collection, the official guidelines for diagnosis and
treatment were updated four times. The criteria of confirmation have evolved from the
original “whole genome sequencing of the respiratory excretion” to “positive viral nucleic
acid results by the RT-PCR of the respiratory excretion or viral gene sequence”, and, most
currently, the inclusion of positive nucleic acid results of the blood sample. In the meanwhile,
the confirmation process is simplified by removing the accreditation process by the national
expert committee for confirmed cases. The fourth edition granted the accrediting authority to
the municipalities. 11 In addition, the medical resources in Hubei Province especially in
Wuhan have been enhanced remarkably. All of these changes might result in a temporary
surge of confirmed cases and lead to an overestimation of
, especially in Hubei Province.
Furthermore, the current containment measures mainly aim to cut the transmission from
human to human via droplets of respiratory. However, other transmission pathways, including
fecal-oral transmission and aerosol transmission, could not yet be excluded based on current
values would remain high in the
evidence. If other transmission mechanisms do exist, the
future unless further measures would intersect these transmission pathways.
