Abstract
Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly respiratory
infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
(SARS-CoV-2) with multiple organ injuries. The aim of this study was to analyze
SARS-CoV-2-induced acute liver injury (ALI), its association with death risk and
prognosis after discharge.
Methods: Three-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients were recruited. Clinical
data were collected from electronic medical records. ALI was evaluated and its
prognosis was tracked. The association between ALI and death risk was analyzed.
Results: Of 355 COVID-19 patients, 211 were common, 88 severe, and 51 critical ill
cases, respectively. On admission, 223 (62.8%) patients were with hypoproteinemia,
151(42.5%) with cholestasis, and 101 (28.5%) with hepatocellular injury. As expected,
ALI was more common in critical ill patients. By multivariate logistic regression,
male, older age and lymphocyte reduction were three important independent risk
factors predicting ALI among COVID-19 patients. Death risk analysis shows that
fatality rate was higher among patients with hypoproteinemia than those without
hypoproteinemia (RR=9.471, P<0.001). Moreover, fatality rate was higher among
patients with cholestasis than those without cholestasis (RR=2.182, P<0.05).
Follow-up observation found that more than one hepatic functional indexes of
two-third patients remained abnormal 14 days after discharge.
Conclusions: ALI at early stage elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients.
SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI has not recovered completely 14 days after discharge.
Key words: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2);
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); acute liver injury (ALI).

1 Introduction
Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus-induced respiratory infectious
disease was found in Wuhan city of central China [1]. This novel coronavirus was
named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. SARS-CoV-2-induced disease was
named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization
(WHO). Since 2020, COVID-19 has been rapidly pandemic all over the world [2].
Until 31 March, 2020, more than 700,000 cases were infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, more than 33000 patients died from COVID-19 all over the world [1].
SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted by droplets or direct contact and infected
through respiratory tract [3]. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by feces [4].
Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), expressed mainly in pulmonary
epithelial cells, and probably cardiomyocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells, has
been identified as functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [5-7]. The main symptoms and
signs of COVID-19 patients include fever, companied by dry cough, dyspnea,
diarrhea, fatigue and lymphopenia [8-13]. Although only a few cases died in mild
COVID-19 patients, death risk was abruptly increased among critical ill patients with
the fatality rate even more than 50% [14]. A large number of clinical data revealed
that infection with SARS-CoV-2 not only caused severe acute respiratory syndrome
but also multiple organ injuries, including lymphocyte reduction, myocardial
dysfunction and even acute renal failure [15-17]. Nevertheless, the clinical
characteristics of acute liver injury (ALI) caused by SARS-CoV-2 are rarely described.
In addition, the clinical significance of SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI and its prognosis
need to be clarified.
The objective of the present study was to analyze SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI, its
association with death risk and prognosis after discharge. Our results showed that
male elderly COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia were more susceptible to ALI. We
found that ALI at the early stage elevated death of COVID-19 patients. We provide

the first evidence that SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI has not recovered completely 14
days after discharge.

2 Methods
2.1 Study design and participants
In the present study, 200 patients, who were confirmed to be infected with
SARS-CoV-2 using real-time RT-PCR, were recruited from Union Hospital of
Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan city. Another 155 patients,
who were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 using real-time RT-PCR, were
recruited from the Second People’s Hospital of Fuyang City in Anhui province. The
Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University sent a medical team to the
Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology to recuse
COVID-19 patients. The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University sent
a specialist group to tthe Second People’s Hospital of Fuyang City to guide
COVID-19 treatment. All COVID-19 patients were clinically diagnosed on basis of
typical clinical manifestations accompanied with characteristic chest radiology
changes. No patients with COVID-19 died in the Second People’s Hospital of Fuyang
City. All patients were cured and discharged. At last, 150 cured patients with
COVID-19 were performed follow-up examinations 14 days after discharge in the
Second People’s Hospital of Fuyang City, biochemical indexes and blood routine
among patients were detected again. All COVID-19 patients were eligible in this
study. Each COVID-19 patient gave advanced oral consent. The present study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of Anhui Medical University (2020-5).
2.2 Data collection
The medical record of each COVID-19 patient was evaluated. Following data
were collected from the electronic medical records: demographic information,
preexisting comorbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatic
disease, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes and other disease. Patient’s
signs and symptoms, and laboratory test results were also collected. The dates of

onset, admission and death were recorded. The onset time was defined as the date
when patients’ any symptom and sign were found.
2.3 Laboratory testing
Patient’s pharyngeal swab specimens were collected for extraction of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect viral nucleic acid using a
COVID-19 nucleic acid detection kit following experimental instructions (Shanghai
bio-germ Medical Technology Co Ltd). Viral RNA extraction and nucleic acid
detection were executed by either the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of
Wuhan City or the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Fuyang City. Hepatic
function

indexes

included:

Alanine

aminotransferase

(ALT),

aspartate

aminotransferase (AST), AST/ALT ratio, total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin
(DBIL), indirect bilirubin (IBIL),
total protein, albumin, globulin, albumin/globulin ratio, alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
glutamyl transferase (γ-GGT), total bile acid (TBA), and oxygenation index were
examined on admission. All laboratory tests were analyzed by the clinical laboratory
of either the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology or
the Second People’s Hospital of Fuyang City.
2.4 Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 21.0 software. Categorical
variables were expressed with frequencies and percentages. Continuous variables
were shown using median and mean values. Means for continuous variables were
compared with independent-samples t tests when the data were normally distributed;
if not, the Mann-Whitney test was used. Proportions for categorical variables were
compared with the chi-square and Fisher’s exact test. Univariable logistic regression
between basic disease or different parameter and demise was performed. Moreover,
the main risks related with demise were examined using multivariable logistic
regression models adjusted for potential confounders. Statistical significance was

＜

determined at P 0.05.

3 Results
3.1 Demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients
The clinical characteristics of 350 COVID-19 patients were analyzed. As shown
in Table 1, common case, defined as oxygenation index higher than 300, was 60.3%.
For severe case, whose oxygenation index was from 200 to 300, was 25.1%. For
critically ill case, whose oxygenation index was lower than 200, was 14.6% (Table 1).
The demographic characteristics of 350 COVID-19 patients were then analyzed. Of
350 COVID-19 patients, males accounted for 53.5% and females accounted for 46.5%
(Table 2). There were 103 patients younger than 40, 137 cases aged between 40 and
60, and 115 patients older than 60 (Table 2). As shown in Table 2, 145 patients were
with diabetes, 125 with hypertension and 16 with hepatic diseases. Finally, blood
lymphocytes were analyzed among COVID-19 patients. As shown in Table 2, 61.1%
(217/355) patients were with lymphopenia.
3.2 Association between the severity and ALI among COVID-19 patients
The association between the severity and ALI was analyzed among COVID-19
patients. As shown in Table 1, all hepatocellular injury markers, including total
bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, ALT and AST, were higher in critically ill
patients than those of common cases. By contrast, total protein, albumin and
albumin/globulin ratio, three markers of hypoproteinemia were lower in critically ill
patients than those of common cases. Despite of no difference on serum TBA,
alkaline phosphatase and glutamyl transferase, two markers of cholestasis, were
higher in critically ill patients than those of common cases. The association between
oxygenation index and hepatic functional indexes was analyzed. As shown in Figure 1,
there was a weak negative correlation between oxygenation index and ALT, AST,
AST/ALT, and glutamyl transferase. By contrast, there was a weak positive
correlation between oxygenation index and albumin among COVID-19 patients
(Figure 1).
3.3 Male elderly COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia are more susceptible to ALI

The effects of demographic characteristics on hepatic functional indexes were
analyzed. As shown in Table 2, the levels of direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, ALT,
alkaline phosphatase and glutamyl transferase were higher in males than in females.
By contrast, the level of albumin was lower in males than in females. Further analysis
showed that the levels of total bilirubin, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and glutamyl
transferase were higher in patients older than 60 than those of younger patients. By
contrast, the level of albumin was lower patients older than 60 than those of younger
patients (Table 2). The effects of comorbidity on hepatic functional indexes were then
analyzed. As shown in Table 2, alkaline phosphatase was slightly increased in
COVID-19 patients with hypertension as compared with those without hypertension.
Further analysis showed that the levels of alkaline phosphatase and glutamyl
transferase were slightly increased in COVID-19 patients with diabetes as compared
with those without diabetes. By contrast, the level of albumin was slightly decreased
in COVID-19 patients with diabetes as compared with those without diabetes. Of
interest, there was no significant association between hepatic functional indexes and
comorbidity with liver disease (Table 2). Finally, the association between blood
lymphocytes and ALI was analyzed among COVID-19 patients. As shown in Table 2,
the levels of ALT and glutamyl transferase were higher in COVID-19 patients with
lymphopenia than those without lymphopenia. By contrast, the levels of albumin and
globulin were lower in COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia than those without
lymphopenia (Table 2). Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze risk
factors of ALI among 355 COVID-19 patients. As shown in Supplemental Table 1, the
ORs of males were 2.884 (95% Cl: 1.812, 4.591; P<0.001) for cholestasis and 4.047
(95% Cl: 2.367, 6.921; P<0.001) for hepatocellular injury, respectively. Further
analysis showed that the ORs of older age were 1.593 (95% Cl: 1.593, 1.979; P<0.05)
for cholestasis and 3.739 (95% Cl: 2.078, 6.727; P=0.001) for hypoproteinemia,
respectively. The association between blood lymphocyte count and ALI was analyzed
among COVID-19 patients. The ORs of lymphopenia were 2.003 (95% Cl: 1.241,
3.233; P=0.004) for cholestasis, 3.218 (95% Cl: 1.969, 5.260; P=0.001) for

hypoproteinemia, and 2.292 (95% Cl: 1.329, 3.953; P=0.003) for hepatocellular injury,
respectively (Supplemental Table 1). The association between comorbidities and ALI
was analyzed among COVID-19 patients. The ORs of diabetes were 1.727 (95% Cl:
1.014, 2.941; P=0.044) for cholestasis, 1.829 (95% Cl: 1.010, 3.312; P=0.046) for
hypoproteinemia, respectively. No significant relationship was observed between ALI
and comorbidity with hypertension and hepatic disease among COVID-19 patients
(Supplemental Table 1).
3.4 ALI at early stage elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients
The effects of ALI at the early stage on death risk are presented in Table 3.
Among 223 COVID-19 patients with hypoproteinemia, 14.3% were died. The fatality
rate was higher among COVID-19 patients with hypoproteinemia than those without
hypoproteinemia (14.3 % vs 1.5%; RR=9.471, 95% Cl: 2.307, 38.880; P<0.001).
Among 151 COVID-19 patients with cholestasis, 13.9% were died. The fatality rate
was higher among COVID-19 patients with cholestasis than those without cholestasis
(13.9 % vs 6.4%; RR=2.182, 95% Cl: 1.129, 4.218; P<0.05). As shown in Table 3,
there was no significant association between hepatocellular injury and death risk
among COVID-19 patients.
3.5 Hepatic functional indexes remain abnormal 14 days after discharge
The prognosis of SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI was tracked 14 days after discharge.
As shown in Table 4, no significant change was observed between hepatic functional
indexes on 14 days after discharge and those on admission. Although the percentage
of patients with hypoproteinemia was lower on 14 days after discharge than on
admission (18.7% vs 51.9%, P<0.001) (Supplemental Table 2), 16.7% albumin, 1.3%
pre albumin and 6.7% albumin/globulin ratio remained below normal range (Table 4).
As shown in Table 4, the percentage of patients with serum ALT elevation was higher
on 14 days after discharge than on admission (31.3% vs 19.5%, P<0.05). In addition,
patients with serum IBIL elevation was higher on 14 days after discharge than on
admission (4.5% vs 10.0%, P<0.05). No significant difference on the percentages of

patients with abnormal value for direct bilirubin, TBA, alkaline phosphatase, glutamyl
transferase and AST was observed when admission and 14 days after discharge (Table
4). Further analysis showed that no significant difference on the percentages of
patients with cholestasis and hepatocellular injury was observed when admission and
discharge, while the percentages of patients with hypoproteinemia was significantly
reduced on 14 days after discharge as compared with on admission (Supplemental
Table 2).
Discussion
The present study aimed to analyze SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI, its association
with death risk and the prognosis after discharge. The major findings of this study
include: (1) ALI is more common in the critically ill COVID-19 patients; (2) Male
elderly COVID-19 patients with diabetes and lymphopenia are more susceptible to
ALI; (3) ALI at the early stage elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients; (4) Hepatic
functional indexes of two-third COVID-19 patients remain abnormal 14 days after
discharge.
Accumulating data demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused multiple
organ injuries, including myocardial dysfunction, lymphopenia and even acute renal
failure [15-17]. In the present study, we described ALI among COVID-19 patients.
ALI was determined by measuring biochemical indexes, such as ALT, AST, direct
bilirubin and indirect bilirubin, several hepatocellular injury markers, total protein,
albumin and globulin, three protein metabolic indexes, alkaline phosphatase, TBA and
glutamyl transferase, three markers of cholestasis. Our results showed that 39.6%
COVID-19 patients were with cholestasis, 51.9% with hypoproteinemia, and 39.0%
with hepatocellular injury on admission. We found that direct bilirubin, indirect
bilirubin,

ALT

and

AST,

four

indexes

of

hepatocellular

injury,

and

alkaline phosphatase and glutamyl transferase, two markers of cholestasis, were
higher in critically ill patients than those of common cases. By contrast, total protein
and albumin were lower in the critically ill patients than those of common cases.

These results provide evidence that ALI on admission is associated with the severity
of COVID-19 patients.
Several studies found that elderly COVID-19 patients had more severe
symptoms and signs than younger cases [18, 19]. The present study analyzed the
influence of gender and age on SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI. We showed that the levels
of serum total bilirubin, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and glutamyl transferase were
higher in males than in females. By contrast, serum albumin level was lower in males
than

in

females.

Further

analysis

showed

that

total

bilirubin,

ALT,

alkaline phosphatase and glutamyl transferase were higher in older patients than
younger ones. By contrast, albumin and globulin were lower in older patients than
younger ones. According to several clinical reports, COVID-19 patients with
comorbidities had worse prognosis [14, 20]. Indeed, this study found that 40.8%
COVID-19 patients were with diabetes, 35.2% with hypertension, and 4.5% with liver
disease. To explore the influence of comorbidities on ALI, the present study analyzed
hepatic functional indexes among different groups. Our results showed that
alkaline phosphatase was slightly higher in COVID-19 patients with hypertension
than those without hypertension. In addition, alkaline phosphatase and glutamyl
transferase were slightly higher in patients with diabetes than those without diabetes.
By contrast, albumin was slightly lower in patients with either diabetes or
hypertension than those neither diabetes nor hypertension. Unexpectedly, comorbidity
with liver disease did not influence hepatic functional indexes of COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytopenia is one of the important early manifestations during the pathogenesis
of COVID-19 [21, 22]. This study analyzed the influence of lymphocytopenia on
SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI. We found that almost all hepatic functional indexes were
worse among patients with lymphocytopenia than without lymphocytopenia. To
exclude potential confounding factors, multivariable logistic regression was used to
further analyze the impact of gender, age and comorbidities on SARS-CoV-2-induced
ALI. We found that male, older age, comorbidity with diabetes and lymphocytopenia

were independent risk factors of cholestasis. In addition, older age, lymphocytopenia
and comorbidity with diabetes were independent risk factors of hypoproteinemia.
Moreover, male and lymphocytopenia were independent risk factors of hepatocellular
injury. Taken together, the present study provide evidence that male, older age,
comorbidity with diabetes and lymphocytopenia are major risk factor of ALI among
COVID-19 patients.
The influence of ALI on the prognosis of COVID-19 is unclear. The present
study analyzed the impact of ALI on death risk of COVID-19 patients. Our results
showed that the fatality rate was higher in COVID-19 patients with hypoproteinemia
than those without hypoproteinemia. Moreover, the fatality rate was higher in
COVID-19 patients with cholestasis than without cholestasis. Our results suggest that
hypoproteinemia and cholestasis at the early stage elevate death risk of COVID-19
patients. It is especially interesting whether SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI recovers in a
short time after discharge. In the present study, 150 COVID-19 patients were followed
up and measured hepatic functions 14 days after discharge. Unexpectedly, no
significant difference on the values of serum direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, TBA,
alkaline phosphatase, glutamyl transferase and AST was observed when admission
and 14 days after discharge. Although serum albumin level was rebounded on 14 days
after discharge, 17% COVID-19 patients remained below normal range. Our results
indicate that hepatic functional indexes of two-third COVID-19 patients remain
abnormal 14 days after discharge. Therefore, further follow-up is required to further
evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection causes permanent liver injury.
The mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 evokes ALI remains unclear.
Accumulating data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes multiple organ injuries,
such as lymphopenia, myocardial dysfunction and acute renal failure [9, 15-17, 25]. In
the present study, we showed that oxygenation index, an index of respiratory function,
was positively correlated with serum albumin. By contrast, there was a weak negative
correlation between oxygenation index and ALT, AST, AST/ALT, and glutamyl

transferase among COVID-19 patients. These results suggest that respiratory failure
may contribute, at least partially, to SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI. Several studies
demonstrated that ACE2, as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, was expressed in
cholangiocytes and hepatocytes [26, 27]. Therefore, this study does not exclude that
SARS-CoV-2 evokes ALI partially through infecting liver. It is required to further
explore whether human liver is another target of SARS-CoV-2 injection.
In summary, this study aimed to investigate SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI among
355

COVID-19

patients

from

two

hospitals.

Our

results

revealed

that

SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI was more common in critically ill patients. In addition,
male elderly COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus and lymphopenia were more
susceptible to ALI. We provide evidence that ALI at the early stage elevates death risk
of COVID-19 patients. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI has not recovered
completely 14 days after discharge. Therefore, it is necessary to further evaluate
whether SARS-CoV-2 infection causes permanent liver injury.
