Summary
Backgrounds Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus epidemic has emerged in
Wuhan city, China and then rapidly spread to other areas. As of 20 Feb 2020, a total
of 2,055 medical staff confirmed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused
by SARS-Cov-2 in China had been reported. We sought to explore the
epidemiological, clinical characteristics and prognosis of novel coronavirus-infected
medical staff.
Methods In this retrospective study, 64 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus-infected
medical staff admitted to Union Hospital, Wuhan between 16 Jan, 2020 to 15 Feb,
2020 were included. Two groups concerned were extracted from the subjects based on
duration of symptoms: group 1 (≤10 days) and group 2 (>10 days). Epidemiological
and clinical data were analyzed and compared across groups. The Kaplan-Meier plot
was used to inspect the change in hospital discharge rate. The Cox regression model
was utilized to identify factors associated with hospital discharge.
Findings The median age of medical staff included was 35 years old. 64% were
female and 67% were nurses. None had an exposure to Huanan seafood wholesale
market or wildlife. A small proportion of the cohort had contact with specimens (5%)
as well as patients in fever clinics (8%) and isolation wards (5%). Fever (67%) was
the most common symptom, followed by cough (47%) and fatigue (34%). The median
time interval between symptoms onset and admission was 8.5 days. On admission,
80% of medical staff showed abnormal IL-6 levels and 34% had lymphocytopenia.
Chest CT mainly manifested as bilateral (61%), septal/subpleural (80%) and
ground-glass (52%) opacities. During the study period, no patients was transferred to
intensive care unit or died, and 34 (53%) had been discharged. Higher body mass
index (BMI) (≥ 24 kg/m2) (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03-0.73), fever (HR 0.24; 95% CI
0.09-0.60) and higher levels of IL-6 on admission (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.11-0.87)
were unfavorable factors for discharge.
Interpretation In this study, medical staff infected with COVID-19 have relatively
milder symptoms and favorable clinical course, which may be partly due to their

medical expertise, younger age and less underlying diseases. Smaller BMI, absence of
fever symptoms and normal IL-6 levels on admission are favorable for discharge for
medical staff. Further studies should be devoted to identifying the exact patterns of
SARS-CoV-2 infection among medical staff.

Introduction
In December, 2019, a group of novel atypical pneumonia patients with uncertain
etiology but mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market emerged in
Wuhan, China [1]. A later confirmed pathogen of this previously unknown pneumonia
was described as a novel coronavirus, currently named as severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2; previously known as 2019nCoV), was
ascertained by unbiased sequencing analysis of lower respiratory tract samples from
early cases on 7 Jan 2020, following which the protocol of real-time
reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for this novel
coronavirus had also been developed [2-7]. In fact, the epidemics of the two other
novel coronaviruses, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have
posed a huge threat to public health in the past two decades [8, 9]. SARS-Cov-2 in
this outbreak, like the previous two viruses, is also categorized within the same genus
of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae within the family Coronaviridae, but shows a
strong affinity for human respiratory receptors [10, 11].

By 11 Feb 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to the SARS-Cov-2 has
caused more than 40,000 laboratory confirmed cases and 1,023 deaths among them in
China [12]. Sufficient evidence indicated that the COVID-19 clustered within
close-contact human groups, such as family and hospital settings [13-17]. The
SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has transmitted throughout China and to other countries due
to massive population movements before the Lunar New Year [14], and consequently
escalated as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern declared by World
Health Organization (WHO) [18]. As of 4 Mar 2020, more than 90,000 confirmed
cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been identified globally [19].

Information pointing to the epidemiology and clinical features of general confirmed
cases has been accumulating. The previous studies enrolling 41, 99 and 138

confirmed cases admitted to Wuhan, respectively, provided an insight into
epidemiological characteristics, clinical manifestations, treatment measures and
clinical outcomes of these patients [1, 20, 21]. In particular, a recent study in Zhejiang
province, China indicated that the symptoms of patients outside of Wuhan perhaps are
relatively mild versus symptoms of initial cases in Wuhan [10]. Meanwhile, a new
finding from a national wide descriptive report drew a huge amount of attention,
which declared that the total number of confirmed novel coronavirus-infected medical
staff was as high 1,716 as of 11 February 2020, with a peak incidence occurring on 28
January 2020 [12]. Hospital-related transmission are one of the causes for infection of
health-care workers [21], especially in the early stages of COVID-19 epidemic when
there was a lack of knowledge about transmission approaches of SARS-CoV-2, as
well as in the period when facing a shortage of protective materials. Nonetheless, the
predominant cause of the infection and the failure of protection among health workers
remains to be investigated [12].

Despite the increased attention towards protecting medical staff from infection,
information regarding the epidemiology and clinical features of medical staff
confirmed with COVID-19 is scarce. This single-centered, retrospective study aimed
to describe epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiographic features, treatment,
and prognosis of a group of medical staff confirmed with COVID-19 who were
admitted to Union Hospital, Wuhan. We hope the findings in the present study will
provide an insight into the prevention and treatment of this novel coronavirus for the
global community.

cases with SARS-Cov-2 infection conforms to the WHO interim guidance [7]. Details
regarding laboratory confirmation protocol for SARS-CoV-2 were described by
previous studies [1, 21]. Throat-swab specimens were screened for SARS-CoV-2 and
other respiratory viruses (influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, etc.) by real-time
RT-PCR assays. A total 64 medical staff, who were confirmed by SARS-CoV-2
real-time RT-PCR test on respiratory secretions collected by throat swab and
undergone serial chest CT scans following their admission to isolation wards of Union
Hospital between 16 Jan and 15 Feb, 2020, were enrolled.

This retrospective study was approved by the Ethics of Committees of Union Hospital,
Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Written
informed consent was waived due to the rapid emergence of this infectious disease.

Data collection
The epidemiological data, medical and nursing records, laboratory examinations,
chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were reviewed and abstracted with
concerted efforts of experienced clinicians. Data were collected at the time of
symptoms onset, presentation for medical advice and in-patient admission. The
clinicians who had experience of treating patients with confirmed SARS-Cov-2
infection reviewed and collected the medical records of patients, and preliminarily
collated the data. The clinical data were extracted through a standardized form for
case report as previously described [23]. Epidemiological data, including exposure
histories before symptoms onset (whether there is a history of exposure to the Huanan
Seafood Wholesale Market, or wildlife), and close contact with laboratory-confirmed
or suspected cases of COVID-19 in a work environment (fever clinics, or isolation
wards), specimens (pharyngeal swab, blood, sputum specimens, etc.) or family
members with COVID-19 were collected. In addition, information about preventive
medication among medical staff was also collected.

We have also collected the data on demographics, clinical manifestations, laboratory

examinations and radiological studies. These included age, sex, occupation (doctor, or
nurse), body mass index (BMI ≥24, or <24 kg/m2), current smoking status (yes, or no),
disease severity (non-severe, or severe), date of symptom onset, symptoms before
hospital admission (fever, cough, fatigue, sore throat, myalgia, sputum production,
difficulty breathing or chest tightness, chill, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and chest pain),
coexisting conditions (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, etc.), laboratory testing indicators
on admission (leucocyte count, lymphocyte count, platelet count, D-dimer, creatinine,
creatine

kinase,

lactose

dehydrogenase,

alanine

aminotransferase,

aspartate

aminotransferase, hemoglobin, ferritin, C-reactive protein, Amyloid A, total bilirubin,
procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and lymphocyte
subsets, etc.), radiologic assessments of chest CT (lung involvement, lung lobe
involvement, predominant CT changes, predominant distribution of opacities, etc.),
treatment measures (antibiotics agents, antiviral agents, traditional Chinese medicine,
immune globulin, thymosin, corticosteroids and oxygen therapy), and complications
(e.g. pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury, acute
kidney injury, shock, etc.). All CT images were analyzed by two radiologists (J.L. and
F.Y., who had 5 and 21 years of experience in thoracic radiology, respectively)
utilizing the institutional digital database system without access to clinical and
laboratory findings. Images were reviewed independently, and final decisions were
reached by discussion and consensus. We estimated the time interval from symptom
onset to admission with maximum information available - that is, all the exact date of
initial symptoms provided by the patients. Then the aggregated data was sent to data
analysis group. Prior to statistical analysis, the aggregated data were cross - checked
by group members to guarantee the correctness and completeness of data.

Outcomes
The clinical outcomes and prognosis were continuously observed up to 24 Feb 2020.
We defined the primary outcomes as discharge. The discharge criteria of inpatients
included all the following three conditions [24]: (1) body temperature return to normal
for more than 3 days and respiratory symptoms improvement; (2) resolution of lung

involvement demonstrated by chest CT; (3) two consecutive RT-RCR tests, with
sampling interval of more than 1 day, showing a negative result. Secondary outcomes
consisted of hospital discharge rate and length of hospital stay. Given that treatment
and monitoring of some patients in our study were still ongoing, a fixed time-interval
of observation was not applied to these clinical outcomes.

Statistical analysis
This study devoted to report the epidemiological, clinical characteristics and
prognosis of medical staff confirmed with COVID-19. Continuous variables were
checked for distribution normality by means of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,
following which they were summarized as either means with standard deviations (SD)
or medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) as appropriate. Counts and percentages
were utilized to describe categorical variables. Given the cut-off point at 10th day of
symptoms onset proposed by previous studies [1, 21], we assigned the patients into
either one of two groups based on duration of symptoms: group 1 (≤10 days) and
group 2 (>10 days). We applied a Kaplan-Meier plot to inspect the change of hospital
discharge rate. The proportional hazard Cox regression model was utilized to
ascertain factors associated with hospital discharge. Univariate models with a single
variable once at a time were first fitted. The statistically significant risk factors as well
as age and sex were, then, included into a final multivariate Cox regression model.
The hazards ratios (HRs) along with the 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were
calculated.

Statistical tests were two-sided with significance set at α less than 0.05. We performed
all data analyses by R software version 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical
Computing).

During the study period, epidemiological and clinical data were collected on 64
medical staff with laboratory-confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection from Wuhan Union
Hospital, of whom 62 (97%) provided an exact date of symptom onset and only 1 case
(2%) was severe. The patients aged between 23 and 63 years old, and median age was
35 years (IQR 29-43 years). The median age in group 1 was 37 years (IQR 32-44
years), and in group 2 it was 30 years (IQR 27-36 years). More than half of the cohort
were female (64%) and nurse (67%). There were 7 (11%) overweight cases (BMI ≥
24 kg/m2) and only 1 was current smoker.

Among the 64 medical staff recruited, no one had an exposure to Huanan seafood
wholesale market or wildlife, while 4 (6%) medical staff had family members
confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. During patient care, 5 (8%) and 3 (5%) cases
had contact with patients in fever clinics and isolation wards, respectively, and 3 (5%)
had direct contact with specimens collected from confirmed patients. 10 (16%) of 64
medical staff have used preventive medications (Table 1).

Clinical features
The median duration between symptoms onset and admission was 8.5 (IQR 4.3-15.0)
days of the entire cohort; 5.0 (IQR 3.0-7.0) days in group 1 and 18.0 (IQR 14.0-24.0)
days in group 2. There were 8 (13%) cases, most of whom were assigned to group 1,
with one or more co-morbidities: 3 (5%) had hypertension, 2 (3%) had uterine
fibroids, and one (2%) each had diabetes, depressive disorder, thyroid nodules or
abdominal lymphatic tuberculosis. The three most common symptoms were fever
(67%), cough (47%) and fatigue (34%). The relatively less common symptoms were
sore throat, myalgia, difficulty breathing or chest tightness, sputum production,
headache, chill, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and chest pain (Table 1).

Table 2 shows the laboratory and radiographic findings of 64 medical staff with
confirmed COVID-19. On admission, the blood counts of 11 (17%) cases showed
leukocytopenia and only one (2%) showed leukocytosis. 22 (34%) presented with

lymphocytopenia and 7 (11%) presented thrombocytopenia. Most cases demonstrated
normal levels of D-dimer, creatinine, and creatine kinase, but elevated C-reactive
protein and amyloid A levels were presented in 45% and 59% of cases, respectively.
Elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (13%) and aspartate aminotransferase
(9%) were less common. A small proportion (3%) of cases had abnormal
procalcitonin serum level (>0.5 ug/L). Notably, 47 (80%) of cases had high levels of
IL-6 (>2.9 pg/ml). Medical staff of group 1 had more prominent laboratory
abnormalities (i.e., leukocytes, lymphocytes, platelet, alanine aminotransferase,
amyloid A and IL-6) as compared with those in group 2.

As evidenced by Table 2 which illustrate the radiological findings in the study cohort
on chest CT, 58 (91%) of 64 cases showed abnormalities (Figure 1). 39 (61%) had
bilateral lung involvement (Figure 1, A and C). The right lower lobe (70 %) and left
lower lobe (64%) were the most common involved lobes. Ground glass opacity was
regarded as the predominant abnormality on chest CT (Figure 1, A and B) observed in
33 (52%) of cases, meanwhile subpleural distribution was predominant as identified
in 51 (80%) (Figure 1, C). Thickening of the adjacent pleura, nodules, emphysema,
pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were relatively rare. CT scans also found that
19 (30%) of medical staff had one or more chronic lung lesions with a static picture
on serial CT examinations (Figure 1, D).

Treatment measures and prognosis
Of the study participants, no person was transferred to an intensive care unit for
mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. 9 (14%) patients
needed an electrocardiograph monitoring, among whom 8 were in group 1. Empirical
intravenous antibiotic treatment was administered in 55 (86%) patients. All the
patients were given empirical antiviral therapy. Meanwhile, 13 (20%) were offered
traditional Chinese medicine, 23 (36%) patients were given immune globulin, 33
(52%) were given thymosin, and 7 (11%) received corticosteroids. As for oxygen
therapy, 32 (50%) used nasal cannula and only 2 (3%) used face mask, while no one

needed invasive mechanical or ventilation extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. As
a whole, despite the negligible difference of antiviral treatment between two groups,
most of the cases who received electrocardiogram monitoring, antibiotics, immune
globulin, thymosin and oxygen therapy belonged to group 1, whereas the proportion
given traditional Chinese medicine was higher in group 2 (Table 3).

By 24 Feb, 2020, 34 (53%) of the cases have been discharged and none had died, the
remaining cases were still in hospital to receive supportive therapy. The median length
of hospital stay was 12.5 (IQR 9.0-19.8) days in total, 18.0 (IQR 13.0-20.5) days in
group 1 and 9.0 (IQR 6.0-11.0) days in group 2 (Table 3). The overall median
discharge time (i.e. equal to the time that half of the patients left the hospital) was 20
days (Figure 2A).

It should be noted that the endpoint of Cox model was discharge, and patients who
continued to be hospitalized as of 24 Feb 2020 would be regarded as censored data.
The HR metric derived from multivariate Cox regression model was utilized to
ascertain factors significantly associated with the endpoint of patients infected with
SARS-CoV-2. Results of the final multivariate Cox regression model showed that
larger BMI (≥ 24 kg/m2) (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03-0.73), fever symptoms (HR 0.24;
95% CI 0.09-0.60) and increased IL-6 levels (> 2.9 pg/ml) on admission (HR 0.31;
95% CI 0.11-0.87) were unfavorable factors for hospital discharge (all HRs <1 and all
P-values <0.05) according to Cox regression mode (Figure 2B).

Discussion
By 20 Feb, 2020, 476 hospitals across China had reported, in total, 2,055
laboratory-confirmed cases of medical staff with SARS-CoV-2 infection, of which the
majority (88%) were from Hubei province [25]. According to China-WHO joint
investigation report, most of the infections among medical staff occurred in the early
stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, when there was a lack of knowledge

about transmission approaches and experience to fight with the SARS-CoV-2 [25].
Despite the outbreak of COVID-19 occurring in few scattered hospitals (e.g. 15
medical staff were infected at one hospital in Wuhan), hospital-related transmission is
not the main transmission feature of COVID-19 in China [25]. Our findings advocate
this viewpoint. According to our data, a small proportion of 64 novel
coronavirus-infected medical staff had a direct contact with specimens of patients (5%)
as well as patients in fever clinics (8%) and isolation wards (5%) during patient care.
In addition, none of the 64 medical staff had an exposure to Huanan seafood market
or wildlife, and 4 (6%) had family members with confirmed COVID-19. The exact
mode of medical staff infection remains unclear. The findings are consistent with
previous reports [12, 25].

The demographic characteristics and clinical manifestations of medical staff with
confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan were not exactly the same as general confirmed
patients included in recent studies [10, 12, 26]. In our study, most of the novel
coronavirus-infected medical staff analyzed were females and nurses, and had a
smaller median and range of age. The medical staff infected with SARS-CoV-2 have
similar signs and symptoms with general confirmed infection patients [12, 26]. The
infected medical staff tended to manifest on chest CT with bilateral, subpleural
ground-glass opacities, which is consistent with the recent radiological reports on
COVID-19 pneumonia [27-30]. Furthermore, abnormal D-dimer levels as well as
abnormal functions of kidney, heart and liver was relatively rare among medical staff
with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In our study, only one of 64 medical staff with SARS-CoV-2 infection was severe
case, none developed acute respiratory distress syndrome or transferred to intensive
care unit. More than half of the cases were discharged by 24 Feb, 2020. Previous
studies suggested that 13.8% of the general confirmed patients were severe cases,
among whom older age, male sex, chronic diseases are more common [25, 31, 32, 33].
Contrarily, our study revealed that medical staff have relatively milder symptoms,

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033118; this version posted March 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

which may be partly due to their medical expertise, younger age and less underlying
diseases.

Medical staff with symptoms onset for less than 10 days by the time of admission
were compared with those with symptoms of more than 10 days. We found that
medical staff with symptoms for less than 10 days had more prominent laboratory
abnormalities on admission, and they also experienced relatively worse clinical course
and longer hospital stay. Furthermore, the median time between symptoms onset and
admission of infected medical staff in this study was 8.5 days, longer than general
population as described in recent publications [10, 21]. We believe that mild cases of
infected medical staff without an early hospitalization was mainly because they made
admirable concessions to provide the limited-number of isolation wards for infected
patients with worse conditions during the peak time of COVID-19 epidemic in
Wuhan.

Predictors of hospital discharge among infected medical staff were identified by Cox
model. Smaller BMI, absence of fever and normal levels of IL-6 on initial stage were
favorable factors for recovery and discharge. A recent study revealed that fever was
identified in only half of the patients on presentation but increased to nearly 90% after
hospitalization [26]. Elevated IL-6 levels were observed in 80% of infected medical
staff on admission, which is associated with inflammatory response [34, 35]. To
explore how absence of fever and IL-6 levels on initial stage affect the length of
hospital stay and discharge of medical staff with SARS-CoV-2 infection, further
studies are needed.

Given that epidemiology and clinical features of medical staff infected with
SARS-CoV-2 is unclear, our study provides an insight to prevention and treatment of
medical staff at risk of COVID-19 infection. So far, more than 40,000 medical
personnel outside Hubei province gathered in Wuhan for the battle against the
epidemic, and China has attached great importance to infection prevention among

medical staff [25]. Although some safeguards have been introduced in the aspects
including salary, injury suffered on the job, rest, and psychological adjustment for
medical staff, the next step will continue to strengthen the promotion of these
measures. Meanwhile, some potential problems remain to be solved, such as unclear
patterns of infection, mental health care for medical staff [36], and the possibility of
airborne transmission from aerosol production by medical practices in health care
facilities [25]. A recent study from Singapore found that surface environmental and
personal protective equipment contamination caused by respiratory droplets and fecal
shedding from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the environment is
a potential viral vector [37]. Further investigations should be devoted to identifying
the exact patterns of SARS-CoV-2 infection among medical staff.

Limitations of this study
We acknowledge some limitations of this study. First, only 64 for medical staff with
confirmed COVID-19 from a single hospital in Wuhan were included. However, the
population from which they were sampled was large and we did not include all of the
cases during the study period. In fact, there are 2,055 laboratory-confirmed cases of
COVID-19 in medical staff as of 20 Feb 2020 [25]. This limitation in our study may
result in deviations in epidemiological and clinical observation characteristics. We
hope that the findings presented here will encourage a more comprehensive
assessment of SARS-Cov-2 infection in for medical staff. Second, more detailed
information, particularly regarding specific causes of SARS-CoV-2 infection among
for medical staff, was unavailable at the time of analysis; however, this is a
retrospective, observational study and the data used in this study only provide a
preliminary insight into epidemiological features and clinical outcomes of a group of
for medical staff confirmed with COVID-19. Further research on this regard is
needed.

The study medical staff have relatively milder symptoms and favorable clinical course,
which may be partly due to their medical expertise, younger age and less underlying
diseases. Smaller BMI, absence of fever symptoms and normal IL-6 levels on
admission are favorable for recovery and hospital discharge for medical staff infected
with COVID-19. Further investigations should be devoted to identifying the exact
mode of COVID-19 among medical staff.
