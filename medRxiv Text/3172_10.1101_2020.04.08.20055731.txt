ABSTRACT

INTRODUCTION

The ongoing pandemic of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global surge
in laboratory testing for the virus. The gold
standard approach to detecting an active viral
infection is the use of RT-qPCR. This approach requires the isolation of viral RNA
from respiratory specimens, such as nasopharyngeal swabs.

In December 2019, the first reports of a new
pathogenic virus causing severe respiratory illness
emerged (1). Early investigations determined that
this new disease was caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Due to the rapid transmission and spread of the disease, the WHO declared this outbreak a global pandemic on 31st
January 2020 (2). Because of the wide spectrum
of presentations, from asymptomatic and
subclinical infections to pneumonia and acute
respiratory distress syndrome, many of which
resemble other common respiratory infections,
laboratory testing is essential for establishing the
diagnosis of COVID-19. Once infected
individuals are identified through laboratory
testing, they can be isolated and managed
appropriately, along with identification and
quarantine of their contacts. The increased
demand for laboratory testing has led to global
shortages of all the required supplies, from
personal protective equipment such as N95
masks, to swabs, and even the reagents required
for viral RNA extraction.

We developed a method using a widely available lysis buffer coupled with solid-phase reverse immobilization (SPRI) beads to extract
viral RNA from swabs collected in viral
transport medium (VTM) which can be performed manually or on a Hamilton STAR liquid-handling robot. Using a WHO recommended, laboratory-developed RT-qPCR for
SARS-CoV-2, we validated this method in a
CAP-accredited laboratory, against the IVDlabelled bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG
automated extraction platform.
Our method demonstrates a comparable sensitivity and specificity, making it suitable for
large-scale testing and monitoring of suspected COVID-19 cases and health care
workers. This is especially important as the
world faces critical shortages of viral RNA
extraction reagents for the existing commercial extraction systems.

Today, most laboratories performing extraction
of RNA from samples rely heavily on commercially available kits due to their ease of use and
standardization across laboratories. When these
kits become scarce, many laboratories will have
to turn to alternative methods, but often lack the
expertise or the resource to test and validate
those alternative methods. The underlying princiKeywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, RNA

polethylenglycol (PEG) under high salt conditions. It was first described for DNA 45 years ago
(1) and later adapted to the isolation of viral RNA
from tissues (2). Modern iterations of this procedure such as Ampure XP add carboxyl-coated
paramagnetic beads to the PEG solution, thus
greatly accelerating the precipitation as well as alleviating the need for time-consuming centrifugations, enabling automation of this process on liquid handling robots (3). This method is highly efficient in recovering even minute amounts of nucleic acids from larger volumes, such as shown in
the precipitation of single-cell genomes (4,5).
Here, we exploited the use of paramagnetic beads
and readily available lysis buffers in combination
with a RT-qPCR assay based on the SARS-CoV2 E gene assay, first described by Corman et al.
(6). The method presented here provides a means
to extract RNA from swabs of suspected
COVID-19 cases that can be readily implemented in many laboratories, without relying on
scarce extraction kits.
RESULTS
RLT buffer used in 1:1 ratio with VTM is efficient at lysing respiratory viruses
Retrospective, residual nasopharyngeal specimens that previously tested positive or negative
for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) using the Cepheid GeneXpert Flu/RSV kit or the Fast Track
Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 21 PCR
(FTD-RESP21) were extracted with our new approach on a Hamilton STAR liquid handling robot with 8 CO-RE channels. In brief, we added
150 µl of buffer RLT to 150 µl of viral transport
medium for inactivation of the virus. We precipitated the contained RNA using 300 µl of Ampure XP beads, performed an extensive wash and
eluted the RNA in 20 µl. For comparison, the
same samples were extracted using the IVD-labelled bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG automated extraction platform, using 200 µl of VTM
and eluted in 40 µl. We used 5 µl of the eluates of
both extraction methods in our in-house LDTRSV RT-qPCR assay.
Across 47 total samples tested, the extraction
method had 91% sensitivity, 100% specificity and
96% accuracy (Table 1) with 2 false negatives. All
results produced by the new method were within
<2 Cq of the validated in-house protocol (7).
Two samples that gave false negative results had
Cq values ≥35, suggesting that the slightly lower
sample volume that is fed into the extraction
leads to slightly reduced sensitivity.

Addition of carrier RNA increases recovery of
viral RNA
Various manufacturers supplement their extraction kits with non-specific carrier RNA at high
amounts (up to 3 µg, Qiagen) to create a crowding or “pull-down” effect in samples with low endogenous amounts of RNA. It is also speculated
that carrier RNA act as a protectant against
RNAses contained in biological samples.
We extracted RNA from freshly harvested MS2
phage spiked into 150 µl of VTM in the presence
of 0 and 1 µg carrier RNA (Qiagen) and observed
an increase of the amount of MS2 RNA detected
(Figure 1), as well as a reduced variation between
samples, when extracted on our liquid-handling
system.
When adding between 0 and 1 µg carrier RNA in
0.25 µg increments directly into the one-step RTqPCR reaction assay detecting a SARS-CoV-2
positive control, we observed a decrease in Cq directly correlated to the amount of carrier RNA
(Pearson r=0.985, Figure 2) present in the reaction. For all subsequent experiments we added
0.5 µg of carrier RNA per extraction sample,
mixed into the RLT buffer.
The sensitivity of the assay was further increased
by extending the drying step of the extraction
protocol. After increasing the drying step to at
least 7 min, no inhibition of MS2 detection was
observed.

method
After establishing the protocol and implementing
a version extracting 96 samples at a time on a
Hamilton STAR, we tested 94 clinical samples
side-by-side using the Biomérieux easyMAG system and the proposed method (Table 2). Apart
from one sample that tested weakly positive at Cq
38 for the validated method, all positive samples
were correctly identified, with a Cq difference of
<1 Cq. More importantly, only 3 out of 94 samples exhibited PCR inhibition as determined by
the successful detection of the internal control.
Overall, the PCR inhibition rate was 3.2% for the

Many of the commercially available kits for the
extraction of RNA from samples are based on
long-standing and well-known principles. Our results show that the commonly available buffer
RLT can lyse RSV, SARS-CoV-2 and bacteriophage MS2 reliably when used in a 1:1 ratio.
The precipitation effect of PEG solution and size
of precipitated fragments is driven by the ratio of
PEG to the nucleic acid solution. Therefore, we
established this method with a relatively high 1:1
ratio of Ampure XP beads to lysed sample, which
is known to precipitate fragments larger than
200 bp. While this approach is more reagent consuming, it guarantees the capture of even small
fragments of viral RNA from potentially degraded samples and is likely a contributing factor
to the observed sensitivity. Future iterations of
this protocol could focus on cost-reduction by
minimizing the amount of costly Ampure XP
beads by substituting parts of the volume with
ethanol or isopropanol, which do not show a ratio-dependent size-selection of nucleic acids.
Our results show that the addition of carrier
RNA is a double-edged sword. While the addition increases the extraction efficiency and consistency, we hypothesized that an excess of carrier
RNA may inhibit the reverse transcription. Indeed, we observed a small negative effect of carrier RNA on the detection of a transcript when

directly added to the RT-qPCR reaction. Until
more experiments are done to fully understand
the intricacies of this effect, we opted for a compromise between increased capture efficiency and
consistency and a weak suppressive effect on the
reverse transcription efficiency. When applying
these conditions to 204 clinical samples, we only
observed a 2.5% inhibition of the RT-qPCR, indicating that our method is suitable for large-scale
use in testing laboratories.
CONCLUSIONS
In this manuscript, we demonstrate the feasibility
of using reagents commonly available in molecular biology and next-generation sequencing laboratories for the extraction of SARS-CoV-2 viral
RNA for the diagnosis of COVID-19. This
method has a comparable sensitivity and specificity with commercially available reference assays,
especially when considering that the reference
method uses 220 µl of sample, whereas this
method only uses 150 µl. This method can be
performed manually, with a throughput of maximum 48 samples in 90 minutes. In order to increase throughput and reproducibility and reduce
human error, it can be implemented on many laboratory liquid-handling robots. In our hands, we
were able to process 96 samples in 60 minutes.
We made 2 methods for a Hamilton STAR liquidhandling system available on GitHub, processing
either 24 or 96 samples per run. Future versions
will make use of on-deck parallelization and offer
a throughput of at least 192 samples in 60 min.
METHODS
RNA extraction using SPRI beads
150 µl of VTM specimens were mixed with an
equal volume of buffer RLT (Qiagen) containing
6.7 µg/µl carrier RNA (Qiagen) and incubated at
RT for 5 min. 300 µl of AmpureXP paramagnetic
beads (Beckman Coulter ) were added to the sample and incubated for 6 min while mixing, either
with a pipette or on a shaker at 1,600 rpm. The
beads were captured by incubating the plate for
8-10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the
bead pellet washed twice with 300 µl of freshly
prepared 80% ethanol. During the first wash, the
pellet was resuspended and incubated on the
magnet for 6 minutes. No mixing was performed
during the second ethanol wash. The pellet was
air-dried and the absence of ethanol visually confirmed. The RNA was eluted by adding 23 µl of
RSB (Illumina) and transferring 20 µl of eluate to
a fresh plate.

RT-qPCR detection of RSV
RT-qPCR assay was performed using a laboratory-developed test as described previously (7).
RT-qPCR detection of SARS-CoV-2
We used the QuantiFast Pathogen +IC (Qiagen)
kit for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene
and the internal control on a 7500 Fast RT-PCR
instrument (Applied Biosystems). The master
mix was created using 2.5 µl 5x QuantiFast Pathogen master mix, 0.1 µl 100x QuantiFast RT mix,
0.25 µl 50x ROX dye solution and 0.9 µl RNAsefree water and 3.5 µl primer-probe mix (to final
concentration of 0.2 µM and 0.4 µM, respecitvely). The following primers and concentrations were used:
E_Sarbeco-F1: 5’–ACAGGTACGTTAATAGTTAATAGCGT-3’ (0.4 µM)
E-Sarbeco-R2: 5’-ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA-3’ (0.4 µM)
E-Sarbeco-P1:
5’-FAM/ZEN-ACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGCGCTTCG-IaBkFQ-3’
(0.2 µM)
7.5 µl of master mix were mixed with 5 µl of extracted RNA and incubated at 50°C for 20 min,
followed by 5 min at 95°C and 45 cycles of 15 s
at 95°C and 30 s at 60°C.
