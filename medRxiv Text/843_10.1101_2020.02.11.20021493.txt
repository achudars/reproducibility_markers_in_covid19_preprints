INTRODUCTION

27

The outbreak of NCP caused by the novel coronavirus, designated as 2019-nCoV,

28

started in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 1. As of Feb. 5, 2020, at least 24324 cases

29

and 490 deaths have been identified across China and other countries

30

30, 2020, WHO has declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV constitutes a Public

31

Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and issued this advice as

32

temporary recommendations under the International Health Regulations (IHR).

33

. On Jan.

Clinical features varied in different cases, and some patients showed

34

asymptomatic infection

35

transmission of 2019-nCoV

36

transmit virus to other contacts, which makes it more difficult to control the spread of

37

the virus 2. Rapid and accurate detection of 2019-nCoV is in urgent need due to the

38

rapid spread and increasing number of NCP patients 6. Studies have shown that

39

pneumonia is the common complication of 2019-nCoV infection

40

that it mainly infects the lower respiratory tract. Until recently, the diagnosis of the

41

cases in the published studies was mostly from the lower respiratory tract specimens 7.

42

However, collection of the lower respiratory samples (usually BALF) requires both a

43

suction device and a skilled operator, also painful for the patients. So, BALF samples

44

are not feasible for the routine laboratory diagnosis and monitoring of the 2019-nCoV.

45

Instead, collection of a nasal swab, throat swab and sputum is rapid, simple and safe.

2,6-8

. Recent studies have confirmed the human to human
. More importantly, asymptomatic cases could

, which suggests

6,7

46

Accordingly, elucidating the diagnosis accuracy of different sample types is

47

crucial for the laboratory diagnosis and monitoring the viral shedding of 2019-nCoV.

48

Moreover, no data on the difference of viral shedding between the upper and lower

49

respiratory tract specimens is currently available. In this study, we aim to investigate

50

the diagnostic accuracy of the upper respiratory samples, and compare the viral

51

distribution and shedding between the mild and severe cases. We believe our results

52

would help the laboratory staff and physicians in the diagnosis and treatments of

53

patients with 2019-nCoV.

METHODS

57

Patients and samples

58

213 Guangdong CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) confirmed

59

2019-nCoV infected patients who were hospitalized in Shenzhen Third People’s

60

hospital between Jan 11 and Feb. 03, 2020 were included. A total of 866 samples from

61

respiratory tracts of the patients including nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum and

62

BALF were collected upon admission and various time-points thereafter. Sample

63

collection dates were divided into 0~7, 8~14 and ≥ 15 d.a.o groups, and patients were

64

divided into severe and mild cases according to the guidelines of 2019-nCoV

65

infection from the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.

66

The study was approved by the Ethics Committees from Shenzhen Third People’s

67

Hospital (SZTHEC2016001).

68

Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction

69

Viral RNAs were extracted from the samples using the QIAamp RNA Viral Kit

70

(Qiagen, Heiden, Germany), and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain

71

reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed using a China Food and Drug Administration

72

(CFDA) approved commercial kit specific for 2019-nCoV detection (GeneoDX Co.,

73

Ltd., Shanghai, China). The specimens were considered positive if the Ct value was ≤

74

37.0, and negative if the results were undetermined. Specimens with a Ct higher than

75

37 were repeated. The specimen was considered positive if the repeat results were the

76

same as the initial result and between 37 and 40. If the repeat Ct was undetectable, the

77

specimen was considered negative.

78

Quantification of hypoxia and lung injury

79

Quantification of hypoxia and lung injury was carried out as previously reported

80

In brief, the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) in arterial blood taken from the patients

81

at various time-points after hospitalization was measured by the ABL90 blood gas

82

analyzer (Radiometer). The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is calculated by the

83

following formula: FiO2 = (21 + oxygen flow (in units of l/min) × 4) / 100. The

84

PaO2/FiO2 ratio (in units of mmHg) is calculated by dividing the PaO2 value with the

85

FiO2 value.

86

Statistics analyses

87

The unpaired, two-tailed t-test was used to determine whether differences in the Ct

88

values were statistically significant. The Fisher exact test analysis was used to analyze

89

positive rate. A p-value lower than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

90

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism.

RESULTS

99

Patients and sample profile

100

Altogether, 866 respiratory specimens from 213 patients were collected, including

101

205 throat swabs, 490 nasal swabs, 142 sputum and 29 BALF. Of these patients, 37

102

were in severe or critical conditions, and the rest were mild cases (Table 1). The

103

median age of severe cases is 65, and ranged from 34 to 81. Most of the patients

104

belonged to the 45-64 (43.2%) and ≥ 65 (51.4) years of age groups (Table 1). For the

105

mild cases, the median age is 47 with a range of 2 to 86. Unlike the severe cases, most

106

of the mild cases belonged to the 15-44 (42.05%) and 45-64 (42.05%) years of age

107

groups. The male ratio (62.2%) seems like higher than female in severe cases, but

108

there is no statistical difference. Moreover, the sex ratio is similar in both groups of

109

severe and mild cases. The median d.a.o of collection of the first specimen were 7 and

110

4 for the severe and mild cases, respectively (Table 1). The median number of

111

specimens collected from each patient was 3 (range 1-23).

112
113

Detection of 2019-nCoV in different respiratory sites NCP cases

114

The collected different types of specimens from 2019-nCoV confirmed cases were

115

divided into three groups based on the collection time, including the 0~7 d.a.o, 8~14

116

d.a.o and ≥ 15 d.a.o groups. The qPCR assay was performed for each specimen and

117

the results were shown in table 2. For the 0~7 d.a.o group, the sputum sample showed

118

the highest positive rate in both severe (88.9%) and mild (82.2%) cases, follow by

119

nasal swabs (73.3%, 72.1%) and then the throat swabs (60.0%, 61.3%). In the mild

120

cases, the positive rates from nasal swabs and sputum were similar. BLAF collected

121

during 8~14 d.a.o in the severe cases showed 100% positive, while negative in the

122

BALF of three mild cases. The sputum collected during 8~14 d.a.o also show the

123

highest positive rate among the upper respiratory samples in both severe and mild

124

cases, much higher than the nasal and throat swabs. Of note, the positive rate of throat

125

swabs is only 50% in severe and 29.6% in mild cases. BALF, sputum and nasal swabs

126

collected from severe cases ≥ 15 d.a.o showed similar positive rate. In mild cases, the

127

positive rates of sputum and nasal swabs were similar, much higher than the throat

128

swabs. In addition, the Ct values were significantly lower in sputum from severe

129

cases.

130
131

Profiles of viral shedding in severe and mild NCP cases

132

Serial samples from both upper (including throat swabs, nasal swabs and sputum,

133

marked in red) and lower (BALF, marked in blue) respiratory tract from 13 NCP cases

134

were collected and analyzed. The patients were grouped into severe (N=10, marked in

135

red) and mild (N=3, marked in blue) cases and the detection results were shown in

136

Figure 2. Viral RNAs could be detected in the upper respiratory tract samples

137

collected during 3 and 21 d.a.o, and detected in BLAF at 23 d.a.o with high viral load.

138

In severe cases, viral RNAs were detected in all the BALF samples as early as 6 d.a.o,

139

and upper respiratory samples from 10 (10/11) cases. In case 2, although the Ct value

140

was low in BALF, viral RNAs were not detected in all the upper respiratory samples.

141

Meanwhile, for some severe cases (cases 06 and 07), viral RNAs were not detected in

142

all the upper respiratory samples. As to the 3 mild cases, the viral RNAs was only

143

detected in the upper respiratory samples, not in the BLAF. Moreover, the duration of

144

viral shedding is longer in most of the severe cases.

145
146

Computed tomography (CT) scan may serve as an important make up for the

147

diagnosis of NCP

148

The epidemiological and clinical features of cases 02, 07 and 13 from whom viral

149

RNA were not detected in the first three or all the upper respiratory samples were

150

analyzed in detail (Table 3 and Fig 2). Case 02 was a female aged 65 with

151

hypertension, and case 07 was a male aged 34 without any underling diseases. Both

152

them had a travelling history to Wuhan. The CT scan of the two cases showed

153

multiple ground-glass opacities in bilateral lungs. The PiO2/FiO2 and Murray score

154

were 188 and 2 for case 02, 306 and 1.5 for case 07, which indicated a lung injury.

155

For the two cases, no viral RNAs were detected in the upper respiratory tract but

156

positive in the BALF. Cases 13 was a male 36 without any underling diseases. Due to

157

the exposure history 8, CT scan and viral screen were done. The CT scan of the this

158

case also showed typical ground-glass opacity in the lung, suggesting a viral

159

pneumonia (Fig 2). However, no viral RNAs were detected until the fourth upper

160

respiratory samples.

161
162
163

DISCUSSION

164

According to our results, apart from the BALF collected during 8~14 d.a.o which

165

possessed the 100% (12/12) positive rate, sputum samples showed the highest positive

166

rate in all stages post 2019-nCoV infection, and followed by nasal swabs. The positive

167

rate of throat swab varied in the severe and mild cases. For the severe cases, the

168

positive rates were similar in samples collected 0~7 and 8~14 d.a.o, while low in

169

samples collected ≥ 15 d.a.o. For the mild cases, it showed the highest positive rate in

170

samples collected 0~7 d.a.o, however, very low positive rate in samples collected

171

8~14 and ≥15 d.a.o. The results indicate that sputum may serve as the most sensitive

172

samples for the virus detection, and followed by nasal swabs. However, a recent study

173

found that only a small portion (28%) of NCP cases showed sputum production 7. As

174

a result, nasal swabs may be the most widely applicable samples for virus detection.

175

On the contrary, throat swabs were not recommended for the viruses detection,

176

especially the samples collected 8~14 and ≥ 15 d.a.o from mild cases, which may

177

result in a large proportion of false negative results.

178

Laboratory detection of viral RNA in the respiratory samples of suspected

179

individuals is now considered one of the criteria for the diagnosis of NCP, and the

180

samples from upper respiratory tract were regularly used (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yzy

181

gj/s7653p/202002/3b09b894ac9b4204a79db5b8912d4440.shtml). However, as shown

182

in our study (Fig 1), viral RNAs could not be detected in the upper respiratory

183

samples from some severe cases (cases 02, 06 and 07), while positive in the BALF.

184

Moreover, in some patients like cases 04 and 13, the viruses were not detected in the

185

first three samples, mostly in the 0~7 d.a.o. The results suggest that the suspected

186

patients especially those with exposure history and clinical symptoms might not be

187

excluded from NCP despite that viral RNA was not detected in the upper respiratory

188

samples. Since human to human transmission of 2019-nCoV have been proved in

189

recent studies

190

spread of the virus. Under such circumstances, CT scan might provide important

191

make up for the diagnosis of NCP patients. For example, although no viral RNAs

192

were detected in the first three or all the upper respiratory samples from cases 02, 07

193

and 13, the CT scans showed typical viral pneumonia linked to NCP 7,11,12, and finally

194

2019-nCoV were identified. Another notification is that, during the antiviral treatment,

195

even though we did not detect the viral RNA in the upper respiratory tract, while it

196

was still positive in the BALF samples of some patients (cases 01, 06 and 07).

197

Therefore, detection of the viral RNA in the BALF might be necessary for the

198

monitoring of viral shedding, especially the patients in severe conditions.

199
200

,we must pay more attention to these people, in case of further

2,3,6,8

Studies have shown that 2019-nCoV could utilize Angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor to infect the host as SARS-CoV did

.

11,13

201

Interestingly, BALF samples from the severe cases possessed 100% positive rate,

202

while in contrast, no viral RNAs were detected in the three BALF samples from mild

203

cases. Although the sample size was small, it also suggests that the viral distribution is

204

associated with diseases severity. More importantly, why the viruses in some

205

individuals retained in the upper respiratory tract merits further elucidation.

206

Our study also has some limitations. Firstly, all the included cases were

207

CDC-confirmed NCP patients, which may result in bias of sample selection.

208

Meanwhile, studies have shown that 2019-nCoV caused asymptomatic infection in

209

some individuals

210

Secondly, most of samples were collected after antiviral treatment, which may

211

influence the viral shedding. Third, the number of BALF samples was limited,

212

especially for the mild cases. So, it is necessary to include more BALF samples to

213

draw a more precise conclusion on the differences of viral shedding between the

214

severe and mild cases.

2,7,8

, and information of such patients is missing in our study.

215

In conclusion, sputum is most accurate for laboratory diagnosis of NCP, followed

216

by nasal swabs, while throat swabs was not recommended for the diagnosis. Detection

217

of viral RNAs in BLAF is necessary for the diagnosis and monitoring of viruses in

218

severe cases. In addition, CT scan could serve as an important make up for the

219

diagnosis of NCP. The NCP cases are rapidly increasing, and we hope that this study

220

could provide useful information for the diagnosis and control of the 2019-nCoV

221

infection.
