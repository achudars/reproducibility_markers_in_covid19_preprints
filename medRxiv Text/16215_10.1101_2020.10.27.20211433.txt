Abstract
Background
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that has rapidly expanded to become a pandemic,
resulting in millions of deaths worldwide. The cytokine storm is caused by the release of
inflammatory agents and results in a physiologic disruption. Tocilizumab is an IL-6
receptor antagonist with the ability to suppress the cytokine storm in critically ill
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Methods
This was a multi-center study of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, admitted between
3/13/20 and 4/16/20, requiring mechanical ventilation. Parameters that were evaluated
included age, sex, race, usage of steroids, inflammatory markers, and comorbidities.
Early dosing was defined as a tocilizumab dose administered prior to or within one (1)
day of intubation. Late dosing was defined as a dose administered greater than one (1)
day after intubation. A control group that was treated only with standard of care, and
without tocilizumab, was utilized for comparison (untreated).

Findings
We studied 118 patients who required mechanical ventilation. Eighty-one (81) received
tocilizumab, compared to 37 who were untreated. Early tocilizumab therapy was
associated with a statistically significant decrease in mortality as compared to patients
who were untreated (p=0.003). Dosing tocilizumab late was associated with an
increased mortality compared to the untreated group (p=0.006).

Interpretation
Early tocilizumab administration was associated with decreased mortality in critically ill
SARS-Co-V-2 patients, but a potential detriment was suggested by dosing later in a
patient’s course.

Introduction

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, first identified in Wuhan, China in late 20191, that has
rapidly expanded to become a worldwide pandemic. The spectrum of symptomatic COVID – 19
disease ranges from mild, nonspecific influenza-like symptoms, to a second stage characterized
by progressive hypoxia and pulmonary infiltrates. The most severe stage of the illness,
characterized by the production of multiple cytokines, results in end organ dysfunction,
hypercoagulability and increased mortality. While no specific therapy has been identified and
validated in clinical trials, tocilizumab has been suggested as a possible immunomodulatory
agent to offset what has been referred to as the cytokine storm2.

Numerous studies have reviewed the utility of tocilizumab with varying results2-7.
This study was designed to identify the utility and timing of tocilizumab dosing for critically ill
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Methods

This study was conducted by Metro Infectious Disease Consultants (MIDC), a fully integrated
infectious disease (ID) private practice composed of 108 ID physicians. This was a multi-center
study evaluating patients requiring mechanical ventilation for a SARS-CoV-2 infection who were
admitted between 3/13/20 and 4/16/20. Patients were evaluated retrospectively and
concurrently through chart review and direct interactions with the prescribing MIDC physician.
This study was independently approved by Western IRB. Tocilizumab was prescribed at the
discretion of the ID physician with consideration of local hospital treatment protocols.
Parameters for evaluation included the patient’s age, sex, race, date of admission, usage of
steroids, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZ) in combination, and remdesivir
therapy. Comorbidities evaluated included age greater than sixty (60) years old, diabetes,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchospastic illness, chronic cardiac or renal disease,
immunodeficiency or neoplastic disease. The tocilizumab dose was recorded by the timing of
administration in relation to the date of hospital admission and mechanical ventilation (MV).
Early dosing was defined as a tocilizumab dose administered prior to or within one (1) day of
intubation. Late dosing was defined as a dose administered greater than one (1) day after
intubation. Markers of inflammation including ferritin, D-dimer, LDH, and CRP were recorded at
the time of dosing for the treatment group and time of intubation for the control group. Patient
dispositions were recorded as discharged from the hospital or expired.

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics for baseline patient characteristics, clinical variables, and outcomes were
summarized using means and standard deviations for continuous variables and counts and
percentages for categorical variables. Continuous outcomes were evaluated using t-tests. Chisquared tests or Fisher Exact tests were used to evaluate categorical outcomes. Potential
confounding variables including age, gender, race, and comorbidities were adjusted for using
propensity score methods. Propensity scores, defined as the probability of being in either
intervention group, were calculated from a regression model with the dose timing (early vs late)
as the outcome and baseline demographic and clinical variables of each participant as predictor
variables. To adjust the sample for these baseline confounding variables, the propensity scores
were converted to weights ("inverse probability of treatment weights", or IPTW), and the
outcomes were then compared using weighted versions of the Chi-Square test or Fisher’s exact
test for categorical outcomes or a weighted version of the t-test for continuous outcomes. Pvalues for both the unadjusted and weighted versions of the tests are reported.
To confirm robustness of the propensity score weighted test results, multivariable regression
models were also fit for each outcome, adjusting for baseline patient demographic variables.
Statistical significance for all methods was defined as a p-value ≤ 0.05.

Results
One hundred eighteen (118) hospitalized patients who required mechanical ventilation were
evaluated from 23 hospitals in 4 states and were treated by 25 individual MIDC physicians
(Table 1). Of these, eighty-one (81) patients received tocilizumab with 37 treated early and 44
late. An additional 37 control patients were treated with standard of care only, excluding
tocilizumab therapy (untreated).

The average age for all patients was 58.2 years, 62.3 for untreated patients, and 56.3 for those
treated with tocilizumab. Seventy-five (63.6%) of the patients were male. Forty-five (38%)
patients were White and 73 patients (62%) were Non-white. Comorbidities were present in 82
(69.5%) patients. Seventy-six (64.4%) patients received steroid therapy, and 116 (98.3%)
received HCQ and AZ in combination at standard doses. Inflammatory markers were elevated in
all patients. Table 1 shows the baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of all the
patients who were included in the study, as well as the comparisons of those who received
tocilizumab and those that were untreated. Both the unadjusted and propensity score weighted
results show no significant differences in any baseline demographic or clinical characteristics
between patients who received tocilizumab and patients who did not.

Outcomes
Overall, sixty-one patients (51.7%) expired, 40 of which received tocilizumab and 21 were
untreated (p=0.285). Table 2 shows the logistic regression model with mortality as the outcome
and tocilizumab therapy, steroid use, and demographics as predictor variables. These results
confirm the propensity score weighted results, showing no significant difference in the odds of
mortality for all patients receiving tocilizumab regardless of timing compared to patients who
were untreated, holding all other covariates constant (OR [95% CI] = 0.828 [0.34, 1.98], p =
0.670).

Of the 37 patients who received tocilizumab early, six (16.2%) expired, compared to 21 (56.8%)
of the 37 untreated patients (p=0.002). Table 3 shows the results of a logistic regression model
with mortality as the outcome and early tocilizumab therapy, steroid use, and demographics as
predictor variables. These results confirm the propensity score weighted results, as early
tocilizumab therapy was associated with a statistically significant decrease in mortality as

Discussion
We present a multi-center, multi-state, observational study that displays a real-time evaluation
of tocilizumab usage in community hospitals for critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Most
therapeutic agents presently utilized for SARS-CoV-2 have recommended guidelines suggesting
the most efficacious timing for administration8-9.This timing has not been defined for
tocilizumab secondary to conflicting data on mortality benefits. With a paucity of clinically
effective SARS-CoV-2 therapies available, the timing of a therapeutic dosing window for
tocilizumab is essential. This study suggests that early tocilizumab administration is associated
with a mortality benefit in a critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patient population.
Multiple reports have previously reviewed the impact of tocilizumab therapy on mortality.
Results have varied significantly with several publications failing to show a mortality benefit.
These studies suffer from a retrospective design, a potential type 2 error, and/or lack of a
control group. Minimal data comparing the timing of tocilizumab dosing to mechanical
ventilation is available. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial not yet published showed no
statistically significant mortality benefit5. The timing of tocilizumab was not reported, but
addressed in their discussion. Fewer treatment failures (progression to mechanical ventilation,
ICU admission, or death) occurred in the tocilizumab treated group than patients who received
placebo. This suggests that the timing of tocilizumab administration is critical to a patient’s
outcome. In contrast, several trials have shown a positive clinical impact when tocilizumab is
given prior to intubation, or when oxygenation requirements markedly increase. A randomized,
placebo-controlled trial, yet to be released, claims that tocilizumab reduces the need for
mechanical ventilation in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients10.

Mortality rates for patients requiring mechanical ventilation are significant and have varied
from 24.5%-79%11-12. Overall, 51.7% of the patients in our study expired. A statistically
significant mortality differential was characterized by the timing of the tocilizumab
administration. Patients who received an early tocilizumab dose showed a statistically
significant decrease in mortality as compared to patients who were untreated (16.22% vs.
56.76%, p < 0.001), after adjusting for demographic characteristics and steroid use. As has been
delineated in other studies, non-white and elderly patients were more likely to succumb to
their illness. Although we did not identify any secondary infections in our patient population,
several authors have reported an increase with tocilizumab therapy13.

A statistically significant increase in mortality was associated with tocilizumab administration
later than one day after intubation (p=0.006). This suggests that the administration of
tocilizumab is not only ineffective, but potentially deleterious, if given later in a critically ill
patient’s course. The etiology of this potentially enhanced decompensation is unclear.
Explanations for this outcome include selection bias of a more critically ill population, higher
levels of IL-614, or an inability to diminish the cytokine storm due to a delay in treatment. The
results of this relatively small series should be interpreted cautiously, as further randomized
studies will be needed to define this predisposition.

With a disease process that is difficult to control and predict, timing of effective therapies is
essential. A delay in tocilizumab therapy is associated with a statistically significant increase in
mortality regardless of sex, age, race, steroid therapy, or the presence of comorbidities.
Accordingly, in an effort to optimize favorable outcomes, hospitals will need to identify barriers
to early dosing. While the etiology of delay for individual patients is difficult to define, several
have been identified. These include lack of drug availability, restrictive protocol requirements,
or lack of consensus between consulting physicians. This data should hopefully stimulate our
clinical and administrative colleagues to work collaboratively to reduce these obstructions to
care.
Our study has certain limitations. This study was observational and we did not formally
evaluate patients for hepatitis B or latent tuberculosis. Although no baseline characteristics
were statistically significant between our groups, patients who received tocilizumab were also
treated with antibiotics, anticoagulants, and steroid therapy in varying combinations.
Accordingly, it is difficult to identify the most clinically influential modality or optimal
therapeutic combination.
To date, no prospective randomized studies analyzing the combination of all potential COVID
treatment modalities within a specific therapeutic window have been published. Pending the
availability of this data, our study provides guidance to clinicians striving to identify the most
efficacious timing for tocilizumab therapy. The presented data supports a mortality benefit of

We strongly encourage the use of tocilizumab earlier in the COVID-19 treatment spectrum.
