Abstract:
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global epidemic crisis with tens of thousands conﬁrmed cases surfacing everyday. The infection rates in households, oﬃces and public
places are quite diﬀerent from those in encompassed spaces such as airplanes, trains and cruise
ships.
Studying the behavior of COVID-19 in conﬁned spaces like Diamond Princess cruise is of great
importance to understand the disease progression and to manage the epidemic. We propose a
novel mixture model to estimate the infection distribution and total infected number after 14
days of quarantine based on PCR test data performed on the Diamond Princess cruise.

Results:
In contrast to the oﬃcially reported 634 individuals with PCR-positive results after the 14 day

quarantine, which as of April 27, 2020 had increased to 712, we conclude that this number should
be at least 1000. The discrepancy might be caused by the false-negative result of the PCR test
or the occurrence of infection after the test.

Background
Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, the epidemic has progressed
rapidly in China and all over the world. As of June 2020, COVID-19 has emerged in more
than two hundred countries and has caused an unprecedented global epidemic crisis with tens of
thousands of new conﬁrmed cases every day. One of the most well-known COVID-19 outbreaks
is the eruption on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The high contagiousness of COVID-19 on
the Diamond Princess cruise has attracted global attention.
The Diamond Princess cruise ship started on January 20, 2020 in Yokohama, Japan and
returned there on February 3, after visiting Kagoshima, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Taiwan, and Okinawa (Sekizuka et al., 2020). During this period, an 80-year-old passenger who disembarked
on January 25 in Hong Kong, had presented with symptoms of a cough since January 23 and
was conﬁrmed positive for COVID-19 on February 1. The Japanese authorities doubted the
widespread infection before the cruise ship went back, and asked the quarantine oﬃcers to investigate the health status of all passengers and crew members from on February 3-4 (Sekizuka
et al., 2020). On February 5, there were 2,666 passengers and 1,045 crew members on board. To
prevent further spread of the virus, the Japanese authorities asked 3,711 individuals, including
passengers and crew members, to stay onboard in Yokohama to carry out a 14-day isolation
period until February 19. During the 14-day quarantine, all passengers were required to stay in
their own cabins, but crew members were not fully isolated in order to maintain limited services

on the ship.
A conﬁrmed case of COVID-19 infection was deﬁned as a case with a positive result for
testing in respiratory specimens. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR) or nested polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing data (Sakiko et al., 2020) from
February 5 to 20, including number of tests and number of testing positive cases each day, are
publicly available. However, possibly due to the testing policy adjustment, the data on February
11 and 14 are not available. It is expected that the infection rates in the cruise were higher
than those in any open places in other countries or districts. This might be caused by the
conﬁnement of the cruise, where individual isolation of all those aboard was not possible. Since
the occurrence of the infection on Diamond Princess, at least 25 other vessels were also found
high numbers of conﬁrmed cases (Mallapaty et al., 2020). For example, in one Antarctic cruise,
approximately 60% of passengers were conﬁrmed cases (James et al., 2020). These unprecedented
highly infectious events had harmful impacts on the cruise industry and resulted in an economic
loss of more than one billion US dollars. Moreover, on April 18, 2020, French Defense Minister
Florence told lawmakers that more than 1,000 of the 2,300 people aboard the Charles de Gaulle
aircraft carrier had tested positive (Jeﬀrey et al., 2020). COVID-19 cases were also observed
on multiple aircraft carriers in USA. Therefore, the research on the transmissibility pattern of
COVID-19 on highly populated conﬁned spaces like the Diamond Princess is indispensable.
The collected data on the Diamond Princess have unique features because at the beginning,
the upper-respiratory specimens were collected from symptomatic passengers, crew, and their
close contacts for PCR testing. Starting February 11, due to the expansion of laboratory capacity,
quarantine oﬃcers systematically collected respiratory specimens from all passengers by age
group, starting with those aged 80 years and older as well as individuals with comorbidities,
such as diabetes or a heart condition. This means the PCR testing was conducted according to
individual characteristics and not at random. Therefore, it is desirable to use diﬀerent techniques

to model the two-part data separately. It is critical to know how the infection varies from
quarantine onset in order to avoid being infected. A sensible estimate of infection distribution
plays a vital role in epidemiology studies. Our goal is to model the infection patterns of Diamond
Princess such as estimating the number of infected individuals when released on February 20
and the infection onset distribution on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. To the best of our
knowledge, current global research on cruise ships have scant statistical analyses on transmission
of COVID-19, thus ongoing eﬀorts to model epidemic data from the Diamond Princess will
provide important information on how the spread of COVID-19 in a cruise ship diﬀers from
that in open spaces. Understanding the extent of transmission of novel coronavirus in a closed
environment has major implications for controlling and anticipating the trajectory and impact
of this pandemic, and for the prevention and control of similar diseases in general. A better
understanding of the virus transmission pattern might also give some insights on how to prevent
the transmission of virus, making the cruise travel safer in the future.
Daily time series of RT-PCR test data from February 5 to February 20 can be found in Table 1
of Mizumoto et al.(2020), including the number of tests, number of testing positive cases, number
of cases in presence or absence of symptoms, etc (Mizumoto et al., 2020). However, the infection
time and the infection rate were unknown. Data from February 11 and February 14 were not
available in the original data sources. We carefully address this missing data problem in our
statistical analysis. At the beginning, PCR tests had been conducted mainly for symptomatic
groups and their high-risk close contacts, and then for almost all persons in the second week.
As of February 20, a total 3063 respiratory specimens were tested with 634 positive, including
one quarantine oﬃcer, one nurse, and one administrative oﬃcer. Of these 634 cases, 313 were
female and 321 were male. 476 cases had age 60 years or older (Mizumoto et al., 2020). For
convenience, the daily time series data with number of tested individuals and individuals with
positive results are provided in Table 1.

In this article, we propose a cure mixture model to characterize the epidemic infectious pattern
of Diamond Princess ship, which combines Weibull distribution assumption for the infection time
with logistic form of the selective probability. Based on the maximum likelihood approach, the
infection distribution and the estimated total number of infections on Diamond Princess at the
end of 14 days quarantine are given. We conclude that undocumented infections might exist
based on our analysis.

Statistical methods
In this Section, we provide an obvious lower bound estimation of the number of infected
individuals and a more sophisticated statistical method to estimate this number and the infection
distribution using the daily time-series data described in Table 1. Let f (x) and F (x) be the
density and cumulative distribution functions of infection onset time X calculated from February
4, respectively. Therefore Fi = F (i) is the probability of the infection onset time occurring before

day i starting from February 4. For example, F1 represents the probability of testing positive
on February 5. According to the non-decreasing property of the distribution function, Fi should
satisfy the constraint F1 ≤ F2 ≤ · · · ≤ F14 .
First, we may hypothetically assume that no PCR tests were performed in the ﬁrst 13 days of
quarantine. On February 20, the last quarantine day, 52 individuals were selected by the oﬃcer
on the ship for testing and 13 positives were found. Therefore the infection rate is 13/52 = 25%.
Out of the n = 3711 passengers and crew members, we expect to see 3711 ∗ 0.25 = 928 PCR
positive results. In reality, the selection of individuals for PCR test in the ﬁrst week was not
random. Symptomatic individuals, elders and closely related individuals were selected ﬁrst.
Therefore, 928 should be a lower bound estimation of total PCR-positive individuals after the
end of quarantine, as these 52 should be less likely to be PCR-positive compared to the ship as
a whole. We will give a full explanation of the larger estimation of N theoretically below.
Next we shall show statistically that a non-random sampling was implemented in the selection
for PCR test. Suppose there is no selection bias, i.e., a random sampling was used. Let Let ni and
Ni be the number of tested positive cases and number of tests at day i respectively, and Xij be the
infection time of the jth subject who was tested at day i, j = 1, 2, . . . , Ni ; i = 1, 2, . . . , 14. Instead
of observing the exact infection time Xij , we can only observe the number of tested positive
individuals ni , which is equal to

with non-decreasing constraints on F1 ≤ F2 ≤ · · · ≤ F14 , we can solve the above constrained
optimization problem using the well-known pool adjacent violators algorithm (PAVA) invented
by Ayer et al.(1955), which has been implemented in R packages like Iso or isotone. Easily we can
ﬁnd again F̂14 = 0.25. Therefore the estimation of the number of PCR-positive patients remains
the same. However, frequency and estimated probability on each day have a large discrepancy,
especially in the ﬁrst week. This demonstrates that the random selection process was violated.
Next we provide a novel mixture modeling strategy that fully utilizes the non-random sam-

pling method adapted in the Diamond Princess cruise during the 14-day quarantine. Although
COVID-19 is a very contagious disease, some people may be immune to it. Naturally the cure
rate model discussed by Farewell (1982), for example, can be used.
At each day i, we suppose that tested individuals are a mixture of a proportion of λi susceptible individuals who eventually get infected and a proportion of 1 − λi who are not susceptible
to COVID-19 and never get infected on the cruise. This means,

Xij ∼ λi f (x) + (1 − λi )I(x = ∞),

j = 1, . . . , Ni ; i = 1, . . . , 14.

Motivated by the priority in choosing symptomatic or high-risk groups, the suspectable probabilities in the ﬁrst week maintained a high level deﬁned as λ, which is estiamted approximately
equal to 1 by MLE method. Since symptomatic and vulnerable individuals were tested ﬁrst and
some sick individuals disembarked at the end of ﬁrst week, it is expected that the proportions
of non-susceptible individuals became larger as time went by. In other words, starting from the
second week, λi , i = 8, 9, ..., 14 contain a downward trend. We suppose the mixture proportion λi
varies across i in the logistic form to add model ﬂexibility. And we assume a Weibull distribution
for F which is commonly used in epidemical modelling. Speciﬁcally, suppose

Application to Diamond Princess Cruise Ship
We apply the proposed parametric mixture model to PCR test data performed on the Diamond Princess and maximum likelihood estimators of parameters are obtained. We used a parametric bootstrap approach to derive conﬁdence intervals of the unknown parameters. Speciﬁcally,
we generated 500 bootstrap samples based on the parametric mixture model with estimated parameters. The 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) were derived through normal approximation, where
the estimated standard errors were calculated as the standard deviation of bootstrap sample
estimators.
Using the mixture modelling strategy, the maximum likelihood estimators by maximizing the
joint log-likelihood with time series daily report data are θ̂1 = 1.599 (95% CI [1.395, 1.804]),
θ̂2 = 0.148 (95% CI [0.136,0.164]), θ̂3 = −0.183 (95% CI [−0.434, 0.069]), θ̂4 = −0.242 (95%
CI [−0.274, −0.209]). The density function f (x) and cumulative distribution function Fi can be
estimated by the Weibull distribution with estimated parameters. λi Fi can be obtained along
the same line, where λ̂i is the estimated proportion of susceptible individuals incorporated in the
PCR test at day i.
Based on our novel mixture model, the estimated total infected number N at the end of
quarantine is 1036, with 95% conﬁdence interval [970, 1103]. We estimated N by combining
the total tested number 3063 before February 20 with 3711−3063=648 individuals whose test
results were unknown. The estimated number 1036, is larger than the obvious lower bound
estimation 928 in the previous section, which is in accordance with our expectation. Figure
2 displays the estimated Weibull density function that speciﬁcally shows the infection pattern
among susceptible individuals on the cruise. It is easy to see from Figure 2 that the infection

Figure 2: Fitted Weibull density function of infection time
rate among susceptible individuals rises at the ﬁrst three to four days, and reaches the maximum
at February 8, then decreases gradually. The infection rates in the ﬁrst week were much higher
than those in the second week.
Figure 3 visualizes the ﬁtted infection proportions (black solid line) along with the scatter
points of daily observed infection proportions ni /Ni . We can see from Figure 3 that the estimated
positive ratios ﬁt the observed positive-test rates ni /Ni quite well, because the daily estimates of
infection proportion increased rapidly in the ﬁrst week and went down day by day in the second
week. We obtained the mean infection time among susceptible individuals was at day 6.06 of
the quarantine. Moreover, in this scatter plot, we used red and blue to demonstrate the total
number of tests Ni > 100 or not, respectively. We found the estimated infection proportions
were a better ﬁt for Ni > 100. This is not surprising because more weights should be given to
points where Ni > 100 with larger numbers of tested individuals. Points where Ni < 100 with
small tested individuals might cause statistical instability. It is worth pointing out that only 6

on that day to be as high as 50%. The small sample problem causes the instability in statistical
analysis.

Discussion
According to the public available data released by Johns Hopkins University, there were 712
conﬁrmed cases on Diamond Princess cruise ship as of April 6, 2020. Our “obvious" estimate of
928 by using the last day quarantine data and mixture modelling based estimation of 1036 by
taking the biased selection process into account both suggest that the number of PCR-positive
individuals should be larger than the reported one. Below is some evidence that may potentially
support our ﬁndings of the larger estimated N .

Hung (2020) recruited 215 passengers from Hong Kong who had been on board the Diamond
Princess cruise ship. All 215 participants had been found to be negative for SARS CoV-2 by
PCR 4 days before disembarking and were transferred to further quarantine in a public estate
in Hong Kong, where they were recruited. Participants were prospectively screened by quantitative PCR and other detection methods during the quarantine. Of these 215 participants, nine
individuals were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR or serology while they were considered
to be “uninfected" on the cruise. The unprecedented spread of COVID-19 owes its high transmissibility of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. A large fraction of infections
is asymptomatic and many others result in mild symptoms that could be mistaken for other
respiratory illnesses (Perkins et al., 2020). Especially at the beginning of global spread in February when epidemiological recognition of viruses was insuﬃcient, accuracy of medical tests for
COVID-19 were limited. There are several infected individuals who had tested negative several
times before ﬁnally being conﬁrmed positive. Reported by Daily Shincho, a doctor treated coronavirus infections at the National Center for Global Health and Medicine of Japan claimed that
the sensitivity of PCR test was about 70%. Sensitivity is an index to measure the proportion
of positives, in terms of 70%, 30% of actual positives may be judged as false negatives. In fact,
there were a series of people in Japan and abroad who tested positive after disembarking, even
though they tested negative on board. Any passengers and crew members might test negative
at their ﬁrst examination and stayed on board until quarantine ended. The conﬁned virus transmission environment on a cruise provides high risk of infection within these people, particularly
for asymptomatic individuals who passed unnoticed even when they disembarked at the end of
quarantine.
Using data before February 16, a recent paper by Zhang et al.(2020) used their estimated
reproductive number R0 to estimate total number of 1514 conﬁrmed cases. This, together with
our ﬁndings, indicates that other transmission routes may be neglected, such as aerosol trans-

mission via the central air conditioning system or drainage systems (Zhang et al., 2020). These
factors point to a potentially large reservoir of unobserved infections.
Our statistical methods focus on exploring the information contained in the data, without
regard to the impact of unnoticed incidents. For example, it should be noted that some asymptomatic cases may be missed due to the imperfect sensitivity of the PCR test. As pointed by Zhao
et al.(2020), PCR-based viral RNA detection is currently the main way to diagnose COVID-19
infections in practice. Many cases strongly epidemiologically linked to novel coronavirus exposure
with typical lung radiological ﬁndings remained RNA negative in their upper respiratory tract
samples (Zhao et al., 2020). In addition, Arevalo-Rodriguez et al.(2020) suggest that repeated
testing in patients with suspicion of COVID-19 infection is necessary given that up to 29% of
patients could have an initial RT-PCR false-negative result. False negative rate of PCR based
SARS-CoV-2 tests has been studied, recently, by Zhao et al.(2020), Liu et al.(2020) and Kucirka
et al.(2020). We recommend that serological testing results on the Diamond Princess members
can be included to make sure how many subclinical infections there really were.
The generalizability of transmission in conﬁned circumstances of the cruise revealed how
COVID-19 could spread in the community. Data from the early phase of local outbreaks are
particularly powerful for predicting the impact of this virus. Based on our statistical analysis, we
conclude that novel coronavirus spread in the cruise ship is easier and faster than that in open
spaces. This result, together with extensive pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission
of COVID-19, suggests that a large number of unobserved infections might exist. Mizumoto
et al.(2020) have estimated that 17.9% of the conﬁrmed cases on Diamond Princess cruise were
asymptomatic. After closure of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market on January 1 2020, within
240 cases with no exposure to it, 200 individuals (83%) reported had no direct contact with any
individuals with respiratory infections (Ferretti et al., 2020), implying that many individuals were
infected by pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals. To analyse 40 primary-secondary

pairs both with known onset of symptoms, Ferretti et al.(2020) found that nearly 37% of them
belong to pre-symptomatic transmission. Direct transmission through a contact might occur at
a time before awareness of taking conservatory measures. Meanwhile, exposure of the infected
mainly depends on symptom-based surveillance all over the world. Many individuals linked to an
identiﬁed source can be discovered by retrospective analysis. Tracing back to presumed exposure
or a location where virus spread is a good approach to explore more unnoticed infections.

Conclusion
In this paper we have explored two statistical methods and mainly focused on a novel mixture
model to quantify the infection distribution and the susceptible proportions among daily tested
people. Since the daily numbers of infected cases are not observable, it is worth pointing out that
our statistic modelling and inference play an important role to estimate them accurately. Based
on these estimates, the number of estimated cumulative infections at the end of quarantine is
larger than the reported number 712. The novel coronavirus spread in the cruise ship is easier
and faster than that in open spaces. The conﬁned circumstances on the cruise are more beneﬁcial
to the transmission of virus. The high contagiousness of undocumented human infections also
can result in both nosocomial and community transmission. Thus under the overall control of
the current epidemic situation, long-term and continuous preventive measures are paramount to
avoide the second outbreak of the epidemic.
