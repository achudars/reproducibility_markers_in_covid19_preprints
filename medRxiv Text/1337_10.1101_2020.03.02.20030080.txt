Abstract
Backgrounds: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia hit Wuhan, Hubei
Province, China and spread to the rest of China and overseas. The emergence of this virus coincided
with the Spring Festival Travel Rush in China. It is possible to estimate total number of cases of
COVID-19 in Wuhan, by 23 January 2020, given the cases reported in other cities and population
flow data between cities.
Methods: We built a model to estimate the total number of cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020,
based on the number of cases detected outside Wuhan city in China, with the assumption that if the
same screening effort used in other cities applied in Wuhan. We employed population flow data from
different sources between Wuhan and other cities/regions by 23 January 2020. The number of total
cases was determined by the maximum log likelihood estimation.
Findings: From overall cities/regions data, we predicted 1326 (95% CI: 1177, 1484), 1151 (95% CI:
1018, 1292) and 5277 (95% CI: 4732, 5859) as total cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on
different source of data from Changjiang Daily newspaper, Tencent, and Baidu. From separate
cities/regions data, we estimated 1059 (95% CI: 918, 1209), 5214 (95% CI: 4659, 5808) as total
cases in Wuhan in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on different sources of population flow data
from Tencent and Baidu.
Conclusion: Sources of population follow data and methods impact the estimates of local cases in
Wuhan before city lock down.

Introduction
In December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown causes were reported in Wuhan,
Hubei Province, China [1]. On 7 January 2020, a novel coronavirus, named COVID-19, was
identified as the cause of this outbreak [2]. This COVID-19 virus shares the common characteristics
of coronavirus and is expected to become more virulent when establishing efficient human-to-human
transmission [3]. The emergence of this virus coincided with the Spring Festival Travel Rush in
China. It was estimated that there would be around 3 billion trips made in China during the period of
10 January to 18 February 2020 [4]. Some researchers have pointed out the risk of regional and
global disease spreading during the Spring Festival Travel Rush [5]. However, due to the small
number of severe patients reported by mid-January and most cases were linked to the Huanan

Seafood Market of Wuhan city, neither international nor regional travelling restrictions were
implemented to Wuhan at the early stage of this outbreak. On 13 January 2020, the first exported case
from Wuhan was reported in Thailand and the case numbers dramatically increased after the
diagnostic kits became available in mid-January. As of 23 February 2020, there were 77042
laboratory confirmed cases and 2445 deaths (46.93% and 75.91% in Wuhan) [6]. In recognition of a
wide-spreading outbreak, the government has suspended all public transportations inside Wuhan city
since 23 January 2020, and some regional travelling restrictions were also implemented by other
cities [3].

Objective
At early stage of this outbreak, the cases might have been seriously underreported due to the lack of
diagnostic kits and insufficient screening for all suspected cases. Several efforts have been made to
estimate the case numbers using different modelling approaches, and the estimates range from 1732
to 4000 during the period of 17-20 January [7,8,9].

In this study, we aimed to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, utilizing the cases
exported to other large cities of mainland China and different sources of the population flow data
between Wuhan and these cities. The estimates were made by 23 January 2020 (before the
suspension of public transportations in Wuhan). We assumed that the exported cases were less likely
underreported, as stringent temperature screening was implemented at airports and railway stations.
We compare these estimates to daily numbers of confirmed cases exported from Wuhan in
surveillance data to evaluate the extent of underreporting.

Data
We obtained daily number of inbound and outbound domestic passengers travelling by air, train or
road to/from Wuhan from three data sources:
1) Tencent’s LBS (location-based services) database (see: https://heat.qq.com/). According to
location data of Tencent’s mobile software users, population flow number during 10 December
2016 and 24 January 2017 was generated, between Wuhan and twenty-five cities/regions (Anhui,
Beijing, Chongqing, Fujian, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Hebei,
Heilongjiang, Henan, Hunan, Hubei(Outside Wuhan), Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Jilin, Liaoning, Ningxia,
Shandong, Shanghai, Sichuan, Tianjin, Yunnan, Zhejiang). Please note that the cities in Hubei
here means all cities in Hubei other than Wuhan.

2) Baidu map database (see: https://qianxi.baidu.com/). According to location data of Baidu’s
mobile software users, population flow number from 1 to 20 January 2020 was generated,
between Wuhan and twenty-seven cities/regions (Anhui, Beijing, Chongqing, Fujian, Gansu,
Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hunan, Hubei(Outside
Wuhan), Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Jilin, Liaoning, Ningxia, Shandong, Shanghai, Shanxi, Shannxi,
Sichuan, Tianjin, Yunnan, Zhejiang).
3) The news platform. It has reported that there were 4.1 million outbound passengers from
Wuhan in the first ten days of the Spring Festival Travel Rush (10-19 January 2020) via railways,
highways and airways [10].
We equally divided the data to get an average daily population flow.

As shown in Fig 1, we also collected daily numbers of exported cases from Wuhan to other cities in
China, and all secondary cases of family or hospital clusters were excluded from analysis [11]. Eight
cases from Guangdong were excluded due to the lack of traveling history to Hubei prior to illness
onset. As for rest 371 cases that not specified as secondary case, we assume that the probability of a
single case being an imported case is θ, and each case is independent from each other. Then all of
these unspecified cases follow a binomial distribution (n, θ), where θ represents the probability that a
case is exported from Wuhan. Since the most cases detected outside Wuhan are imported cases, by
23 January 2020 [12], we estimated daily numbers of imported COVID-19 cases from Wuhan based
on different level of probability θ (1,0.9,0.8), see Table S1 in appendix.

Methods
Daily number of diagnosed cases of COVID-19 infection in China was assumed to follow a
Binomial distribution [7], as in Eqn (1), where n is total number of cases and p is probability of
finding any cases overseas.

The probability p can be derived from dividing daily outbound international passengers of Wuhan by
the population size that the Wuhan airport serves and multiplying by the average time of case
discovery, see Eqn (2).

Similarly, we used exported cases from Wuhan to predict numbers of local imported COVID-19
cases. We assumed a population of 19 million (catchment population) travelling through the airport,
railway stations and highways in Wuhan, and a 10-day delay on average, which accounted for the

time interval between the timings of infection and case reported [7]. Furthermore, it was assumed
that all cases in other cities/regions outside Wuhan are detected. If cases are missed in other
cities/regions, our forecast will underestimate the real number of cases.
Apart from predict number of COVID-19 cases through overall data, we also tried to forecast
number of COVID-19 cases base on separate city/region’s data since more details may convey more
information. A parameter λ was set as total COVID-19 cases. Based on the data obtained from each
city/region, we estimated the λ, which is the most likely to make these results appear by calculating
maximum of log-likelihood.

is the total log-likelihood. The k represents the total number of cities/regions

calculated. The n, p represents the number of cases reported overseas and probability of finding any
cases overseas respectively. After obtaining λ, since residuals of log maximum likelihood estimation
follows Chi-square distribution [13], 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of log-likelihood, l, can be
calculated. Then we can extrapolate a 95% CI about COVID-19 cases.
In addition, we analyze the correlation between the two data sources. We found that Pearson
Correlation Coefficient of Baidu and Tencent data is 0.9943 (95% CI: 0.9871, 0.9976). We assumed
a linear relation between the Baidu data and Tencent data, see Eqn (4). Then we tested null
hypothesis H0 that

Result
As for separate cities/regions data, based on different data sources, we summed the total population
flow from Wuhan to other cities/regions and the total number of cases in those cities. Then we
estimate total number and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) about COVID-19 cases. We predicted
1326 (95% CI: 1177, 1484), 1151 (95% CI: 1018, 1292) and 5277 (95% CI: 4732, 5859) as total
cases in Wuhan by 23 January, based on different source of data, see Table 1.
As for separate cities/regions data, we estimated total number of cases, λ, by using the maximum
log-likelihood estimation (MLE) approach based on the population flow data from Tencent and
Baidu, see Fig 2 (a,b). Then we estimated 95% confidence interval (95% CI) about COVID-19 cases.
We predicted 1059 (95% CI: 918, 1209), 5214 (95% CI: 4659, 5808) as total cases in Wuhan by 23
January 2020, based on different sources of population flow data, see Table 2.

In addition, as for the correlation analysis between data from different sources, we got result that
estimated coefficient

equals 0.23,

equals 689.11 and p-value was less than 2e-16. Then we

rejected the null hypothesis H0 under 99.99% CI, which suggests that two sources of data are likely
to have a linear relation.

Discussion
Recent study by Imai et al. estimated that a total of 4000 (95% CI: 1000-9700) cases in 18 January
2020 [8] and Leung et al. estimated that 1343 (95% CI: 547-3446) cases had onset of symptoms in
Wuhan during 1-17 January 2020 [9]. In general, compared with the total number of confirmed cases
provided by the government, which is 495 [14], Imai et al. and Leung et al. predicted larger number
of cases [7,9]. This is partly because the screening effort targeting population from Wuhan in other
cities is much more effective than the local screening effort in Wuhan due to the worsen situation.
Based on three different sources of population flow data, we generated the total COVID-19 cases
prediction closest to the official report through Tencent data. Baidu Data provided closest result to
the forecast by Imai et al. [8]. Meanwhile, in sensitivity analysis, Table 1 and Table 2 show that
slight fluctuations of probability that a case is exported from Wuhan will have little impact on the
forecast.

Estimates of the population outflow provided by news, Baidu and Tencent show substantial
fluctuation, resulting in wide predictions. We found that Baidu and Tencent data show significant
linear relation, which verified each other that the general pattern of data is reasonable. After simple
linear transformation, two sets of data become similar (see Fig 3). One possible reason for the
phenomenon is that different institutions have various definition about the number of people flow
form one city to another. Methods includes people who travel to other city through Wuhan in the
population flow may provide much larger figure than those only calculate people only originally
depart from Wuhan. At the same time, multiple round trips may also affect the count. Another
possible reason is that Baidu and Tencent would fail to track whole amount of population flow since
not everyone uses mobile phone software from Baidu and Tencent.

Imai et al. suggested that by further improving the definition and testing of COVID-19 cases, and
further expanding the scope of epidemic monitoring, the gap between the estimated number and
official reported cases will be further narrowed. According to our results, statistics of population flow
also play significant roles in prediction. At present, many researches use data from Baidu and

Tencent platforms [9,15,16]. It is not clear which data source can be used to make the most accurate
prediction yet, while it is possible for forecasts based on a single data source to be inaccurate. To
sum up, it is necessary to make a comprehensive analysis based on different statistics before reaching
any conclusions.

Conclusion
Population flow data were used in estimating the size of the epidemic of COVID-19 in Wuhan,
China before the lock down. We found that population flow data from different sources may lead to
significantly different estimates, although all estimates suggested much larger sizes than officially
reported. Using cases reported off-site to estimate the size (course) of the epidemic in the epicenter is
a common technique and will be used in future epidemics, especially when the epicenter lacks
medical resources thus cases are under-reported. We argue that reliability of estimates of population
flow data should be taken into consideration.
