Abstract
Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a critical role in spreading COVID-19. To protect
public health, we designed and fabricated electrospun nanofibrous air filters that hold promise for
applications in personal protective equipment and indoor environment. Due to ultrafine nanofibers
(~300 nm), the electrospun air filters had a much smaller pore size compared to the surgical mask
and cloth masks (a couple of microns versus tens to hundreds of microns). A coronavirus strain
was used to generate aerosols for filtration efficiency tests, which can better represent SARS-CoV2 than other agents used for aerosol generation in previous studies. The electrospun air filters
showed excellent performance by capturing up to 99.9% of coronavirus aerosols, which
outperformed many commercial face masks. In addition, since NaCl aerosols have been widely
used in filtration tests, we compared the filtration efficiency obtained from the coronavirus
aerosols and the NaCl aerosols. The NaCl aerosols were demonstrated as an eligible surrogate for
the coronavirus aerosols in the filtration tests, when air filters and face masks with diverse pore
sizes, morphologies, and efficiencies were used. Our work paves a new avenue for advancing air
filtration by developing electrospun nanofibrous air filters for controlling SARS-CoV-2 airborne
transmission. Moreover, the removal efficiency of the NaCl aerosols can be reasonably translated
into understanding how air filters capture the coronavirus aerosols.

Introduction
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has raised serious public health concerns. More evidences have
highlighted the importance of the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of
COVID-19.12 Aerosols (< 5 m) can suspend in the air for a long duration, accumulate in a closed
environment, remain infectious (the half-life of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols is 1.1 h),3 and thus
involve in the long-range transmission of airborne diseases. Therefore, there is an urgent need to
control the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

One accepted strategy to control the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is to wear face masks
and respirators as personal protective equipment (PPE). However, cloth masks do not always have
satisfactory aerosol removal efficiency, droplet repulsion, and/or breathability.4 SARS-CoV-2 in
the indoor environment can also potentially spread through heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning (HVAC) systems,5 and effective air filtration is promising to control the spread of
airborne diseases. However, most air filters used in residential, commercial, and industrial
buildings (minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) <13) other than high-efficiency
particulate air (HEPA) filters used in healthcare facilities only capture larger particles like dusts,
mold spores, or bacteria but not airborne viruses.6 Nanotechnology holds promise for developing
effective, scalable, and affordable air filters for both mask/respirator and HVAC system
applications.

Electrospinning has emerged as a new technology to synthesize non-woven nanofibrous
membranes that are ideal for air filtration.7-11 During electrospinning, a polymer solution is ejected
into a strong electric field to form fine nanofibers. Electrospun air filters have a reduced pore size

(submicrometers to several micrometers) than conventional filters, which enable effective capture
of small airborne particles. The large porosity of electrospun air filters can also reduce air pressure
drop in filtration as well as enhance the breathability of masks/respirators.12 More importantly,
electrospinning is operated under a strong electric field (i.e., 1-5 kV cm-1), and it produces filters
with retained surface and volume charges that can last for weeks or even months. The presence of
the retained charges can significantly promote aerosol capture through electrostatic attraction.13
Electrospun nanofibrous membranes have shown excellent performance for removing aerosols
generated from polystyrene beads, NaCl, and bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus epidermidis,
Staphylococcus aureus).12, 14-18

To date, many studies have evaluated the filtration efficiency of air filters and face masks by using
surrogate aerosols instead of coronavirus aerosols.12, 14-20 However, it remains elusive whether the
reported filtration performance can be used to understand coronavirus control because of distinct
properties between the surrogate and coronavirus. Moreover, developing electrospun air filters for
capturing viral aerosols is still at its nascent stage and no report is available yet. In this work, we
systematically compared the filtration efficiency of coronavirus and NaCl aerosols for a broad
spectrum of electrospun air filters and face masks, and concluded that NaCl is an eligible surrogate
for coronavirus during aerosol filtration tests for the first time. Murine hepatitis virus A59 (MHVA59), a -coronavirus in the same family as SARS-CoV-2, was selected for aerosol generation
and filtration. In addition, we developed advanced electrospun air filters for capturing coronavirus
aerosols that outperformed many commercially available face masks.

Fabrication of electrospun air filters
We used a customized electrospinning system21 to prepare electrospun air filters, by
electrospinning a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, 15 wt %, Arkema KYNAR® 761) solution onto
a layer of polypropylene fabrics (PP, dissembled from VWR® basic protection face mask, 414004680). The feeding rate of the working solution, electric field, and electrospinning duration was at
0.6 mL h-1, 1 kV cm-1, and 20 or 30 min, respectively. The fabricated electrospun air filters were
designated as PVDF20 and PVDF30, respectively. To increase the binding between coronavirus and
air filters by electrostatic attraction and promote virus removal efficiency, a positive or negative
charged polyelectrolyte, i.e., poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) or poly(vinylphosphonic acid) (PVPA),
was coated onto PVDF20, and the fabricated filters were denoted as PVDF20/PEI and
PVDF20/PVPA, respectively. Details of electrospinning, PVPA synthesis, and coating were
described in the Supporting Information (SI).

Characterization of electrospun air filters and face masks
A three-layer non-woven surgical mask, a three-layer woven cotton mask, and a one-layer woven
polyester neck gaiter were selected as representative commercial face masks because of their wide
availability, extensive use, and distinct properties. The fiber diameter and elemental mapping of
the electrospun air filters and the face masks were determined by scanning electron microscopy
with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), PEI or PVPA coating was characterized
by attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, mean flow
pore size was examined by a gas liquid porometry method, and pressure drop was determined with
a face velocity of 5.3 cm s-1. Details are included in the SI.

Determination of filtration efficiency for coronavirus and NaCl aerosols
The filtration efficiency was evaluated by a customized aerosolization setup (CH Technologies,
Inc., Figure S1). Briefly, the aerosols were generated by a high output Blaustein Atomizer (BLAM)
with four jets, and high-rate air flow (~1.5 L min-1) sheared liquid flow (15 mL h-1) of a NaCl
solution (0.1 M) or MHV-A59 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, ~106 gene copies mL-1) into tiny
droplets including aerosols. The BLAM produced aerosols with a whole size distribution of 200
nm-3.5 m, and ~90% of the aerosols were ranged between 200 to 400 nm based on the number
of aerosols. A single pass atomization (no air circulation) mode was applied to ensure the least
damage of viruses during aerosolization. A portion of the aerosols with a controlled flow rate of
0.5 standard liter per minute next passed through a fitted air filter/face mask mounted on a
stainless-steel holder and an impinger sequentially, and each filtration test (i.e., filter-on) was
conducted for 30 min. The rest aerosols were captured by a HEPA filter under vacuum. NaCl or
MHV-A59 aerosols that penetrated through the filter/mask were retained by the impinger in
ultrapure water or PBS (4 mL), respectively. Control experiments (i.e., filter-off) with the same
setup and operational conditions were also conducted, except that no filter was installed in the
holder. Each filter-on and filter-off experiment was conducted at least for duplicates, and filtration
efficiency, including mean, max, and min values, was calculated from the difference of the amount
of the testing agent (NaCl or MHV-A59) in the impinger between filter-off and filter-on
experiments over the amount of the testing agent in the impinger in the filter-off experiment.
Details of quantifying the testing agent in the impinger and calculating the filtration efficiency are
shown in the SI.

Electrospun air filters had small fiber diameters and pore sizes.
Comparing with the commercial face masks, the electrospun PVDF filters fabricated in this study
were with much smaller fiber diameters and pore sizes (Figures 1 and S2). Specifically, the fiber
diameter of PVDF20, PVDF30, PVDF20/PEI, and PVDF20/PVPA ranged 0.2-1.3 m. Compared to
PVDF20, PVDF30 showed a similar fiber diameter and pore size (t-test, both p>0.05), but its
increased thickness induced a slightly higher pressure drop (0.23±0.00 versus 0.20±0.00 inches
of water column (inch wc)). Both elemental mapping and FTIR characterization indicated the
successful coating of PEI or PVPA onto the electrospun PVDF air filters (Figures S3 and S4). The
fiber diameter of PVDF20/PEI and PVDF20/PVPA did not change (t-test, both p>0.05) in
comparison with PVDF20. However, PEI and PVPA were observed to block pores in air filters.
For PVDF20/PVPA, its pores were partially blocked (Figure S2d), leading to a smaller pore size
than PVDF20 (t-test, p=0.006). For PVDF20/PEI, some pores especially the small ones were
completely blocked (Figure S2c), but the mean pore size was comparable with that of PVDF20 (ttest, p=0.27). Both PVDF20/PEI and PVDF20/PVPA showed an increased pressure drop of 1.19±
0.59 and 0.38±0.04 inch wc than PVDF20.

Among the three commercial face masks, the middle layer of the surgical mask, which is the
effective filtration medium, showed the smallest fiber diameter of 5.7±2.8 m, while the neck
gaiter showed the largest fiber diameter of 12.0±1.0 m. A larger fiber diameter corresponded to
a larger pore size: all the electrospun filters had a mean pore size ≤ 2.7 m, all the commercial
masks had the mean pore size ≥ 17.5 m, and the largest mean pore size of 102.1±4.4 m was
observed for the neck gaiter. The positive correlation between the filter fiber diameter and the pore

size agreed with previous studies.22 The filters with a larger fiber diameter and pore size showed a
lower filtration efficiency for airborne particles.23 Therefore, we expect that electrospun air filters
would outperform the commercial face masks for removing airborne coronavirus particles. Due to
a large pore size, the surgical mask, cotton mask, and neck gaiter has a low pressure drop of 0.06
±0.01, 0.06±0.01, and 0.01±0.00 inch wc, respectively.

All the electrospun filters had an average filtration efficiency ≥ 95.7%, while the commercial face
masks showed an average filtration efficiency of 44.9% for the neck gaiter, 73.3% for the cotton
mask, and 98.2% for the surgical mask, respectively (Figure 2). The aerosol removal efficiency

indeed increased with the decrease of the mask pore size.22, 23 Increase of electrospinning duration
and thickness of the air filters enhanced coronavirus aerosol removal (99.9% and 99.1% for
PVDF30 and PVDF20, respectively), though there was a marginal decrease of the pore size of
PVDF30 compared to PVDF20. Polyelectrolyte coating did not promote electrospun air filters for
removing coronavirus aerosols, and the average filtration efficiency for PVDF20/PEI and
PVDF20/PVPA was 99.1% and 95.7%, respectively. We speculate that coronavirus aerosol capture
was dominated by interception, impaction, or diffusion, instead of the long-range force of
electrostatic attraction, since the size of the aerosols and electrospun filter pores are close. The fact
that PVPA coating reduced the aerosol removal efficiency may indicate coronavirus aerosols are
negatively charged under the experimental condition, and electrostatic repulsion might play a role
in filtration. The PP fabric for supporting the electrospun membrane removed a very limited
amount of aerosols (0-30%), suggesting that the electrospun layer determines the performance of
virus capture. Details are included in the SI.

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to evaluate the filtration efficiency of the air
filters/face masks by using aerosols of a coronavirus rather than surrogates. A previous study used
bacteriophage MS2 to produce aerosols, and it revealed that the surgical mask removed 98.3-100%
of the viral aerosols.19 However, MS2 is a non-enveloped virus with an average size of 27 nm,
which is very different from SARS-CoV-2 with an envelope structure and a virion size of 50-200
nm.24 In addition, that study only tested the filtration of aerosols with a size of several microns
(2.6 and 6.0 m), while the filtration efficiency of smaller aerosols is still unknown.19 Aerosol
particles with a size of 100-500 nm can suspend in air for extended duration and they are most
penetrating for mechanical filters,25, 26 but filtration of viral aerosols with those sizes has not been

studied yet. The surgical mask was reported to remove 76-90% of silica or NaCl aerosols with a
size around 300 nm,4,

27

and the efficiency was lower than that in our study for capturing

coronavirus aerosols with a dominant size between 200 to 400 nm. The difference between the
filtration efficiency could be caused by distinct physicochemical properties (e.g., size, geometry,
surface charge, and elasticity) of viral and inorganic particles/aerosols. Compared to the aerosols
produced from inert agents,4, 19, 27 MHV-A59 aerosols used in our study can best represent SARSCoV-2 aerosols.

NaCl aerosols served as an eligible surrogate for evaluating the filtration efficiency of
coronavirus aerosols.
The filtration efficiencies for removing coronavirus and NaCl aerosols were compared for PVDF20,
PVDF30, and the commercial face masks (Figure 2). For electrospun air filters, the cotton mask,
and the neck gaiter, using MHV-A59 or NaCl aerosols did not lead to significant difference in
filtration efficiency (t-test, all p>0.05). The filtration efficiency of NaCl aerosols for the surgical
mask was significantly lower than that of MHV-A59 aerosols (t-test, p=0.00001). Therefore, NaCl
aerosols can serve as a good surrogate for coronavirus aerosols in evaluating the filtration
efficiency for different air filters and face masks, because the removal efficiency for NaCl aerosols
was lower or equivalent to that for coronavirus aerosols. Since tests with pathogenic viral aerosols
require high biosafety levels, NaCl aerosols are more easily to handle and they have been
frequently used for filtration tests.4, 28-30 NaCl and bacteriophage phiX174 aerosols were used to
test the filtration efficiency of the N95 respirator and the surgical mask, and a similar or lower
filtration efficiency was also observed for NaCl aerosols compared to phiX174 aerosols.20
However, phiX174 is a non-enveloped virus with a virion size of 27 nm, which may not well
represent SARS-CoVo-2. In addition, both the N95 respirator and the surgical mask had relatively
high filtration performance, regardless of the type of aerosols used.20 The conclusion that NaCl
aerosols can act as a surrogate for viral aerosols based on the tests of high-performance filters may
not be valid for low-performance filters. Our study has addressed this concern by demonstrating
NaCl aerosols are a valid surrogate for coronavirus aerosols for both high- and low-performance
filters.

Implication
Our study is the first to demonstrate that electrospun air filters hold promise for providing efficient
protection against airborne coronavirus particles. Cloth masks (e.g., cotton mask and neck gaiter)
are most commonly used during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to the surgical mask and N95
respirator;31 but our study along with previous research revealed the a low filtration efficiency of
the cloth masks.19, 27 Therefore, wearing the surgical mask or other masks with an equal or higher
filtration efficiency should be encouraged to protect people from SARS-CoV-2 airborne
transmission and infection. However, at the beginning of the pandemic, the shortage of the surgical
mask and the N95 respirator was frequently reported, and it calls for an urgent need to advance air
filter development for PPE. Meanwhile, it is highly desirable to develop innovative and efficient
air filters for the HVAC system that can prevent the long-range transmission and accumulation of
coronavirus aerosols. Electrospinning is an economically feasible and industrially viable
technology to fabricate highly efficient air filters,32, 33 and our study underscores its great potential
for controlling the spread of coronavirus aerosols. More attractively, small-scale electrospinning
apparatuses can provide a rapid response to the pandemic and produce highly tailorable filters with
desired performance for individuals and small communities.34, 35 By integrating with additive
manufacturing (i.e., 3D printing),36 it is easy to design and fabricate customized masks, respirators,
and HVAC air filters based on the needs onsite.

Our study has also validated the eligibility of NaCl as a surrogate of coronavirus in aerosol
filtration tests, by comparing the filtration efficiency for a broad spectrum of air filters and face
masks with different pore sizes and ranges of efficiency. Research outcome can be translated into
understanding how to leverage filtration for controlling coronavirus airborne transmission when

NaCl aerosols were tested. Precautions should be paid to using our conclusion for interpreting
other research results, because we do not know yet how the charge and size of coronavirus aerosols,
the charge of filters, and other experimental conditions (e.g., flow rate of aerosols) impact the
surrogate validity of NaCl for coronavirus. Future work should explore these items.
