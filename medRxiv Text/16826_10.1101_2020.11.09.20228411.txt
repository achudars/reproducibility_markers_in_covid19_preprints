Abstract
Background: Detailed understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, the cause of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been hampered by a lack of quantitative antibody
assays.
Objective: To develop a quantitative assay for IgG to SARS-CoV-2 proteins that could
readily be implemented in clinical and research laboratories.
Methods: The biotin-streptavidin technique was used to conjugate SARS-CoV-2 spike
receptor-binding-domain (RBD) or nucleocapsid protein to the solid-phase of the
ImmunoCAP resin. Plasma and serum samples from patients with COVID-19 (n=51) and
samples from donors banked prior to the emergence of COVID-19 (n=109) were used in the
assay. SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were followed longitudinally in a subset of samples and were
related to total IgG and IgG to reference antigens using an ImmunoCAP 250 platform.
Results: Performance characteristics demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 99% specificity at a
cut-off level of 2.5 µg/mL for both SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Among 36 patients evaluated in a
post-hospital follow-up clinic, median levels of IgG to spike-RBD and nucleocapsid were
34.7 µg/mL (IQR 18-52) and 24.5 µg/mL (IQR 9-59), respectively. Among 17 patients with
longitudinal samples there was a wide variation in the magnitude of IgG responses, but
generally the response to spike-RBD and to nucleocapsid occurred in parallel, with peak
levels approaching 100 µg/mL, or 1% of total IgG.
Conclusions: We have described a quantitative assay to measure IgG to SARS-CoV-2 that
could be used in clinical and research laboratories and implemented at scale. The assay can
easily be adapted to measure IgG to novel antigens, has good performance characteristics and
a read-out in standardized units.

Introduction
Serological assays that quantify antibodies specific for severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 represent an important tool in the investigation of the
epidemiology and immunology of this novel coronavirus, the cause of the coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) pandemic [1-3]. Many studies have reported on antibodies specific for
SARS-CoV-2, however most of the assays used in these studies have had qualitative and/or
semi-quantitative read-outs and very few have used standardized units (eg, µg/mL) [4-12].
The ImmunoCAP assay developed by Phadia/Thermo Fisher is often considered the goldstandard for quantitative detection of IgE antibodies to allergens in both clinical and research
laboratories. The platform was designed for IgE detection but can also be used to quantify
other antibody isotypes/subclasses including IgG and IgG4 [13, 14]. The assay has high
accuracy, consistency and reproducibility and has a read-out in standardized units (ie, IU/mL
for IgE and μg/mL for IgG and IgG4) [15]. A major strength of the ImmunoCAP is that
antibodies specific for multiple antigenic targets can readily be assessed in parallel. With the
emergence of the coronavirus pandemic we asked whether the ImmunCAP could be used to
measure IgG to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Here we describe a novel assay that takes advantage
of the biotin-streptavidin technique to link commercially available SARS-CoV-2 proteins to
the high-capacity absorbent solid-phase of the ImmunoCAP [16, 17]. The assay was
developed using plasma and serum samples from established COVID-19 patients and also
samples from control subjects banked prior to the pandemic. Our results suggest that the
ImmunoCAP-based approach has good performance characteristics and offers several
advantages over many commercial assays currently in use.

COVID-19 patients and controls
De-identified plasma samples from 15 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were available
through the clinical laboratory for initial assay development carried out under the Common
Rule. Paired serum and plasma samples were available from 36 patients with COVID-19 seen
in outpatient post-hospitalization follow-up clinic as part of a University of Virginia (UVA)
Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved investigation. Serum samples were available
from 17 patients at various longitudinal time points during inpatient admission for
management of COVID-19 as part of a UVA IRB-approved investigation. Of these 17
patients, 8 also had a sample available from a subsequent outpatient follow-up clinic. Serum
from allergic and non-allergic adults (n=109) obtained prior to December 2019 as part of a
UVA IRB-approved investigation were used as reference controls.

IgG ImmunoCAP assays
The biotin-streptavidin technique was used to link target antigens to the solid-phase of the
ImmunoCAP assay. Biotinylation was performed using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin
(ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA). Briefly, to 500 µL of 2 mg/mL protein solution, 60 µl of
2 mg/mL of biotin was added. Mixtures were placed in the dark and incubated for 4 hours at
room temperature. The biotinylated proteins were dialyzed against PBS at 4˚C for 24 hours
with three buffer changes. In initial optimization experiments, different amounts of
biotinylated spike-RBD and nucleocapsid proteins were conjugated to the solid phase (4 µg,
2 µg, 1 µg, 0.5 and 0.25 µg). Subsequent experiments used 1.25 µg of SARS-CoV-2 protein
to generate each ImmunoCAP. For the α-Gal assay, 2 µg of biotinylated α-Gal-HSA was
used to generate each ImmunoCAP. Total IgG was measured according to manufacturer’s
instructions using a 1:200 benchtop dilution. Assays were carried out with an ImmunoCAP
250 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Statistical analysis
Antibody levels were non-normally distributed and were compared by Mann-Whitney U test.
The cut-off threshold of the assay as well as sensitivity and specificity of the assay for spikeRBD and nucleocapsid was determined using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve
analysis. Correlation between concentration of the monoclonal antibody CR3022 and assay
read-out were determined using simple linear regression. All analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism V8.4 (San Diego, CA).

The assay was initially developed using plasma from 15 de-identified patients hospitalized
with COVID-19 who had been confirmed to have IgG to SARS-CoV-2 with the FDA-EUAapproved Abbott Architect i2000 immunoassay. To measure IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2,
streptavidin-linked immunosorbents were prepared using 1.25 μg of biotinylated spike-RBD
or nucleocapsid protein, as determined in preliminary optimization experiments (online suppl.
Fig. 1). Dilution curves carried out at 1:100, 1:500, 1:2,500, 1:12,500 and 1:62,500
(accounting for the 1:100 onboard dilution) exhibited parallelism for both SARS-CoV-2
proteins (Fig. 1A). Observed values with the nucleocapsid ImmunoCAP assay generally
aligned with the results of the Abbott assay, which used nucleocapsid on the solid phase, in a
head-to-head comparison (Fig. 1B). Initial results using matched plasma and serum from
seroconverted patients showed negligible differences, demonstrating both types of specimens
can be used in this assay (online suppl. Fig. 2). To address the quantitative accuracy of the
assay we utilized a monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 IgG1 antibody (CR3022) [5]. The
concentration of CR3022 mAb [5] used in the assay correlated closely with the assay read-out
(R2=0.97, P<0.001) (Fig. 1C).
To determine an optimal cut-off limit and non-specific binding in the assay, samples from
COVID-19 patients (n=41) and samples from allergic and non-allergic donors banked prior to
the emergence of COVID-19 (n=109) were assayed using ImmunoCAPs conjugated with
SARS-CoV-2 protein and also unconjugated “naked” streptavidin ImmunoCAPs. The
COVID-19 samples were obtained from the 15 hospitalized patients described above, as well
as 26 patients evaluated in an outpatient follow-up clinic following hospitalization for
COVID-19 [18]. IgG binding to naked streptavidin ImmunoCAPs was observed at low levels
in both COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 samples (online suppl. Fig. 3). To account for this
background binding, the result obtained with the streptavidin ImmunoCAP was henceforth

subtracted from the result obtained using viral antigen for each sample that was assayed. At a
cut-off threshold of 2.5 µg/mL the assay had 100% sensitivity and 99% specificity in receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for both the spike-RBD and nucleocapsid assay
(Fig. 1D). Of note, this value is only marginally different from the value of 2 µg/mL which is
the lower end of the assay’s measuring range according to the manufacturer’s instructions
and within the range in which the assay exhibited parallelism in dilution experiments (Fig.
1A).
Application of the assay in COVID-19 cases followed longitudinally
Next, we used the assay to measure IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 proteins in 17 patients
hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 in which longitudinal blood draws were
available. None of these patients had received convalescent plasma and the majority had
severe disease as reflected by admission to the intensive care unit and a requirement of
mechanical ventilation (online suppl. Table 1). Among these patients, the seroconversion rate
was 88% for spike-RBD (15 of 17 patients) and 83% for nucleocapsid (14 of 17 patients),
considering the whole duration of the study (Fig. 2). Of note, none of the patients who failed
to seroconvert had samples available at time points later than 14 days post-symptom onset.
IgG to both spike-RBD and nucleocapsid proteins generally occurred in parallel, were
positive within 10-12 days after symptoms onset and decreased over time (Fig. 2 and online
suppl. Fig. 4).
Levels of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 in relation to non-SARS coronaviruses and reference antigens
We next sought to determine how levels of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 (spike-RBD) in the subacute (defined as day 14 to 28 post-symptom onset) and convalescent (post-hospitalization,
median=70 days post-symptom onset) phase compared to baseline levels of IgG to the spike

S1 protein of two non-SARS coronaviruses (HCoV). We focused on HCoV-229E and HCoVOC43 as these two coronaviruses represent important causes of community upper respiratory
viral infections [19]. We also assessed two reference antigens that were expected to be
recognized by high levels of IgG. Tetanus toxoid represents an antigen to which most
individuals are routinely immunized and galactose-α-1,3-galactose (α-Gal) is an
oligosaccharide of non-primate mammals which is the target of abundant IgG in
immunocompetent humans [20]. The results revealed that levels of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 in
patients with severe COVID (in the sub-acute and convalescent phase) were higher than
levels of IgG specific for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, and also tetanus toxoid or α-Gal
(Mann-Whitney, P<0.01 for each comparison) (Fig. 3A). Total IgG levels trended higher in
the COVID-19 patients but this did not achieve significance (Mann-Whitney, P=0.16).
Responses to SARS-CoV-2 in the sub-acute phase represented nearly 1% of total IgG (Fig.
3B). Interestingly, IgG to α-Gal represented <0.1% of total IgG in both cases and controls, a
level lower than previously reported [20]. Finally, this analysis allowed us to explore the
effects of pre-existing immunity to HCoV on the magnitude of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 that
developed in COVID-19 patients. Baseline levels of IgG to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43
spike S1 were paired with the highest value for IgG to SARS-CoV-2 that was observed in the
sub-acute phase. Samples with the lowest levels of IgG to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43
appeared to have relatively higher levels of IgG to SARS-CoV-2, though this analysis was
limited by sample size considerations (Fig. 3C).
Discussion/Conclusion
The majority of serologic studies of COVID-19, and also commercial assays for measuring
IgG to SARS-CoV-2, have been limited by a lack of quantitative information about anti-viral
antibodies in standardized units. Here we have shown that the ImmunoCAP assay, which is

well known for its strong performance characteristics for IgE measurement and is used in
clinical and research labs across the globe, can be readily adapted for the quantitative
measurement of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The assay has high sensitivity and specificity
and, unlike the majority of commercial assays, has a read-out in standardized units (µg/mL).
A particular strength of the assay is that antibodies to multiple antigens, including novel
antigens that have been linked to the solid phase by the biotin-streptavidin technique, can be
run in parallel in a single run. Applying the assay, we have shown that peak levels of IgG to
SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and nucleocapsid can approach or exceed 100 µg/mL, equivalent to
~1% of total IgG, in the sub-acute phase of infection before waning over time. This level
significantly exceeded steady-state levels that were detected to major representative antigens,
ie - IgG to tetanus toxoid, α-Gal and also to HCoV. The timing and trajectory of anti-SARSCoV-2 IgG in our assay generally fit with prior reports, with levels peaking within 3 weeks of
symptom onset and showing a significant decrease within 3 months [5, 21, 8, 22]. Although
preliminary, our data also raise interesting questions about the role that pre-existing immunity
to HCoV could play in affecting the development of IgG to SARS-CoV-2.
The current investigation of COVID-19 cases primarily included serum/plasma samples from
those cases that were severe, as reflected by intensive care admission status and mechanical
ventilation history. We acknowledge that the performance characteristics of the assay may
differ when studying mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. To date we have not compared
the results from ImmunoCAP with results of neutralizing antibody assay. This is an important
next step, however it has been convincingly reported that IgG to spike-RBD correlates with
results using neutralization assays [23, 24]. Our data also suggests that non-specific binding
(background) in this system is ~1-3 µg/mL. This may be higher than background values
observed in other assay systems, however, we have addressed this by accounting for binding

to unconjugated streptavidin ImmunoCAPs for each sample. Acknowledging these
limitations, the assay we have described has several strengths compared to many of the
serological approaches currently being used in COVID-19 research and patient care. The
ImmunoCAP-based assay we have described can readily be adapted to study IgG to SARSCoV-2 and also a host of other antigens by using the streptavidin-biotin technique. The assay
has good performance characteristics, has a quantitative read-out in standardized units and
could be used by laboratories across the globe that routinely use the ImmunoCAP.

Fig. 1. (A) Dilution curves for IgG to SARS-CoV-2 spike-RBD and nucleocapsid (5-fold dilutions,
n=5). (B) Comparison of results of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid using ImmunoCAP and Abbott
assay (n=10). (C) Concentration response curve using the anti-spike-glycoprotein S1 monoclonal
antibody CR3022 (2-fold dilutions carried out in triplicate ± SD). (D) IgG to SARS-CoV-2 spikeRBD and nucleocapsid in COVID-19 patients (n=41) and controls (n=109).
Fig. 2. Longitudinal sampling of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 spike-RBD (A) and nucleocapsid (B) with
ImmunoCAP in 17 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. All samples after day 40 were obtained
from a post-hospital follow-up clinic.
Fig. 3. (A) Levels of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 spike-RBD, non-SARS coronaviruses and reference
antigens with ImmunoCAP, and also total IgG, among controls (n=29) and COVID-19 patients
sampled in the sub-acute (n=15, denoted in red) or convalescent (n=36, denoted in orange) phase. (B)
IgG levels expressed in relation to total IgG (C) Relationship between IgG to SARS-CoV-2 at the
sub-acute time point and IgG to non-SARS HCoV.
