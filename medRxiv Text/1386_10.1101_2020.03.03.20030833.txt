Abstract
Background. With the emergence of 4rd generation transmission, the prevention and
treatment of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has entered a new period.
We aimed to report several changes in the clinical characteristics at admission of
patients with COVID-19.
Methods. Clinical records and laboratory results of patients suffering from COVID-19
were retrospectively reviewed and matched with the admission dates to analyze the
changes in characteristics at the onset of illness.
Results. Of the 89 affected patients, 31 [34.8%] patients were admitted from January
16 to 22, and 58 [65.2%] were admitted from January 23 to 29. Patients were admitted
with more systemic symptoms, such as fever (21 [67.7%] of 31), fatigue (13 [41.9%]
of 31), and myalgia (7 [22.6%] of 31), before January 23. More patients (10 [32.3%] of
31) admitted before January 23 had a small amount of sputum production compared
with a smaller proportion (4 [6.9%] of 58) of the patients admitted after January 23.
Other symptoms, such as cough, nausea, diarrhea, and chest tightness, were not
significantly different between the two groups. In addition, the group admitted before
January 23 had a larger proportion of patients with reduced lymphocyte (13 [54.2%] of
24), CD3 (11 [54.4%] of 21), and CD8 (9 [42.9%] of 21) counts and elevated serum
amyloid A (SAA, 18 [75%] of 24).
Conclusions. The initial symptoms of recently infected patients seem more insidious,
indicating that the new coronavirus may gradually evolve into a virus similar to
influenza and latent in asymptomatic carriers for a long time.

Introduction
Since December 2019, there has been an outbreak of large-scale pneumonia cases of
unknown cause in Wuhan, China.1-2 RT-PCR analyses and electron microscope
observations detected a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (formerly known as
2019-nCoV).3 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by SARS-CoV2, has been confirmed to have obvious person-to-person transmission among close
contacts.4-5 As of February 25, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases and a total of
2700 deaths have been identified globally.6 As the epidemic spreads to many countries,
COVID-19 poses a severe threat to global health. In the early stage of the epidemic, the
most common clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 at the onset of illness
manifested as fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue, with or without sputum production
and diarrhea.7 Therefore, detecting and confirming infected cases in a timely manner
and applying scientific treatment as soon as possible is extremely essential to reduce
the mortality of COVID-19. Since the emergence of 3th and even 4rd-generation
transmission4 and signs of asymptomatic carrier transmission of COVID-19,8 the
prevention and control of COVID-19 has entered a new period. Consequently, it is
urgent to carefully observe the changes in patients' initial symptoms. As the designated
hospital for patients with severe infection, we have been receiving COVID-19 patients
in the newly opened unit since January 16. After the government announced a state of
emergency and closed access to Wuhan city on January 23, the number of suspected
patients who came to our unit increased rapidly. As of January 29, we received 89
patients confirmed with COVID-19. Surprisingly, during the consultation, we found
that the clinical characteristics of patients admitted after January 23 began to differ from
those of patients admitted before, which brings new challenges for the diagnosis of
suspected patients. To prevent and control the epidemic scientifically, this study aimed
to describe the clinical and laboratory characteristics of COVID-19 patients from the
perspective of clinical doctors and to compare the initial clinical features between
patients infected in different periods.

Study design and patients
The research protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee at Renmin
Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, China). All research procedures adhered to the
tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The design of the study was analytical,
observational and retrospective. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the New
Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (2nd edition) of China and
was indicated by suspected symptoms, chest CT results and SARS-CoV-2 positivity by
use of quantitative RT-PCR. We reviewed clinical charts, nursing records, and
laboratory findings for 89 patients admitted from January 16, 2020, to January 29, 2020,
who had confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19. Patients were assigned into two groups
according to their admission date to analyze the differences in patients’ features at
admission over time.
Data collection
The epidemiological data and clinical symptoms of the patients were collected by
revising the clinical status (routine blood, CRP, SAA and CD3, CD4, CD8 cells) on the
first day of admission from the medical records. Due to incomplete tests for some
patients, some types of laboratory results are missing. Three researchers reviewed the
data collection forms to double check the data independently.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables are described with frequencies and percentages. Quantitative
variables are described with the mean (SD) or, if they were not normally distributed,
the median. Comparisons of quantitative variables between groups were performed
using the independent-sample t test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. Categorical variables
were expressed as numbers (%) and compared by χ² test or Fisher’s exact test between
the first group and the second group. A two-sided p-value less than 0.05 was considered
statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 21.0.
Results
By January 29, 2020, 89 patients were identified as having COVID-19 and admitted to
our hospital. As shown in Table 1, patients were assigned into two groups according to

their admission date. Thirty-one [34.8%] of the infected patients were admitted to the
hospital from January 16 to 22 (before Jan. 23, first group), and 58 [65.2%] were
admitted from January 23 to 29 (after Jan. 23, second group). There was no significant
difference in age distribution between the two groups of patients (Table 1). Most of the
infected patients were women (45 [77.6%] of 58) in the second group but there were
fewer female patients (14 [45.2%] of 31) in the first group (Table 1). The result in the
second group is not similar to that from previous studies.7, 9 We speculate that this may
be related to the small sample size, since there is no evidence that women are more
vulnerable to infection as the COVID-19 spreads.
In terms of the initial symptoms, more symptoms appeared in patients from the first
group (Table 2), such as fever (21 [67.7%] of 31), fatigue (13 [41.9%] of 31), and
myalgia (7 [22.6%] of 31). Several patients (10 [32.3%] of 31) admitted before January
23 had a small amount of sputum production, but only a few people in the second group
had this symptom (4 [6.9%] of 58). Other symptoms, such as cough, nausea, diarrhea,
and chest tightness, were not significantly different between the two groups.
For hematology, the first group had a larger proportion of patients with reduced
lymphocyte (13 [54.2%] of 24), CD3 (11 [54.4%] of 21), and CD8 (9 [42.9%] of 21)
counts but elevated SAA (18 [75%] of 24) in peripheral blood. Other data, such as CRP,
did not show obvious differences between the two groups, suggesting that patients
admitted earlier may have had more severe infection and immune disorders (Table 3).
Discussion
We report here the admission characteristics of 89 patients with confirmed COVID-19.
All patients were admitted to the designated hospital in Wuhan from January 16 to
January 29, 2020. As is known, patients and health-care workers can make a
preliminary diagnosis of infectious diseases by accurately grasping the initial symptoms,
which is extremely crucial for screening suspicious cases. In the early stage of SARSCoV-2 transmission, the clinical features of patients with COVID-19 at symptom onset
mostly manifest as fever, dry cough, myalgia and fatigue, with or without diarrhea.7, 9
However, based on the characteristics of virus mutations and generational transmission,

infected patients in different periods may have diverse admission characteristics. Since
the 3rd and 4rd-generation transmission and even asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV2 have appeared,4, 8 it is urgent to distinguish the differences in clinical manifestations
of COVID-19 patients at admission during diverse infection periods.
In this study, we observed a small proportion of female patients admitted before January
23, considering that the sample size is not large, it is difficult to account for this
phenomenon. However, surprisingly, there were several differences in admission
symptoms between the two groups. Some common systemic symptoms of COVID-19,
such as fever, fatigue, sputum and myalgia, were more prominent in the patients
admitted before January 23, but they were more insidious in patients admitted later.
However, there is still no convincing evidence to predict whether the transmission and
pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 will weaken during transmission. As the "close
relatives" of SARS-CoV-2, previous studies have shown that the interpersonal
transmission of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were constantly changing. Therefore, the
clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in different periods should be observed in detail.
Research has confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by binding to angiotensin
converting enzyme II (ACE2),10-12 and ACE2 is highly expressed in nasopharyngeal
cells.13 More importantly, current research detected a high viral load in the nasopharynx
soon after symptom onset.14 Theoretically, the nasopharynx is the first virus-infected
organ, but through observation, we found that infected individuals rarely show upper
respiratory symptoms early in infection, and throat dryness only presented in a few
patients. Research and clinical findings seem to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be
colonized in the nasopharynx but has failed to be recognized in the early stage. As a
result, SARS-CoV-2 could hardly be removed by self-cleaning responses such as
sneeze and runny and could not be cleared immediately by the local immune system;
thus, the initial symptoms of COVID-19 are insidious. Our previous study also
indicated that clinical symptoms of COVID-19 deviate from the CT results, and the
outcome follows the clinical features.15 This further illustrates the critical need to
correctly identify the symptoms of COVID-19 at admission. Recently, possible

asymptomatic carrier transmission has been reported.8 All of these results indicated that
the less obvious respiratory symptoms in early infected patients may be due to the
existence of pathogenic latency of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, our study found that a larger proportion of the patients admitted earlier had
decreased lymphocyte, CD3 and CD8 T cell counts in the peripheral blood. Reduced
CD3 and CD8 T cells counts in the context of excessive activation of these cells have
been shown to contribute to the severity and mortality of COVID-19 by causing severe
immune damage. 16 The contrasting elevated SAA also reflects the infection levels of
patients in various periods. Overall, changes in symptoms and laboratory results at
admission reflect that SARS-CoV-2 may be undergoing a certain degree of
modification, and infection in patients seems to be more insidious. Therefore, we
propose that it may be of great significance in guiding the diagnosis and prevention of
COVID-19 in the future if respiratory samples, especially lower respiratory samples,
could be collected to detect the content of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 in patients infected
at different periods.
More notably, as of now, 3 unique patients have appeared in our unit. All of them
reached the discharge standard (SARS-CoV-2 negativity detected on different days),
but a re-examination of their throat swabs showed positive infection days after
discharge. One of them was the first confirmed medical staff in our hospital, and this
patient has been isolated for more than 20 days after reaching the discharge standard;
the remaining 2 patients were isolated 14 days after discharge. These data indicate that
the current knowledge of COVID-19 is still insufficient. As the generations of
transmissions increase, the clinical manifestations of patients with COVID-19 are
changing. The presence of asymptomatic infection also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may
gradually evolve into a virus similar to influenza,17 or it may be latent in humans for a
long time. However, the limitation of this article is that the number of cases is small so
that there may be bias.
