ABSTRCT

30

Given the scale and rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

31

(SARS-CoV-2, known as 2019-nCov) infection (COVID-19), the ongoing global

32

SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has become a huge public health issue. Rapid and precise

33

diagnostic methods are thus immediately needed for diagnosing COVID-19,

34

providing timely treatment and facilitating infection control. A one-step reverse

35

transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) coupled with

36

nanoparticles-based biosensor (NBS) assay (RT-LAMP-NBS) was successfully

37

established for rapidly and accurately diagnosing COVID-19. A simple equipment

38

(such as heating block) was required for maintaining a constant temperature (63°C)

39

for only 40 min. Using two designed LAMP primer sets, F1ab (opening reading frame

40

1a/b) and np (nucleoprotein) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were simultaneously amplified

41

and detected in a 'one-step' and 'single-tube' reaction, and the detection results were

42

easily interpreted by NBS. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP-NBS was 12

43

copies (each of detection target) per reaction, and no cross-reactivity was generated

44

from non-SARS-CoV-2 templates. Among clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients,

45

the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (33/33) in the oropharynx swab

46

samples, and the assay's specificity was also 100% (96/96) when analyzed the clinical

47

samples collected from non-COVID-19 patients. The total diagnosis test from sample

48

collection to result interpretation only takes approximately 1 h. In sum, the

49

RT-LAMP-NBS is a promising tool for diagnosing the current SARS-CoV-2

50

infection in first line field, public health and clinical laboratories, especially for

51

resource-challenged regions.

INTRODUCTION

55

In late December 2019, an unexpected outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory

56

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, known as 2019-nCov) emerged in Wuhan,

57

Hubei province, China, which had previously not been reported in animals or humans

58

(1). By press time, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a huge

59

epidemic in China and other 88 countries/territories, and there have been 98,129

60

globally confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), including 3, 380

61

deaths (World Health Organization, COVID-19 Situation Report-46) (2). As the

62

current outbreak of COVID-19 continues to evolve, COVID-19 has become a serious

63

global health concern because of the possible fatal progression and rapidly growing

64

numbers of new cases (3). Herein, it is urgently necessary to devise as many specific

65

detection assays as possible to provide early, rapid and reliable diagnosis of

66

COVID-19.

67

Diagnosis of COVID-19 based on clinical symptoms, especially in the early

68

stages of this disease, is extremely difficult as there are no characteristic initial

69

manifestations of COVID-19 (4). Although genome sequencing had high accuracy for

70

diagnose of COVID-19, it was not applicable in rapid diagnosis for clinical

71

large-samples because of its longer sequencing time and high requirements for

72

experimental equipment (5). In the current outbreak of COVID-19, real-time reverse

73

transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was employed to detect

74

SARS-CoV-2 in public health and clinical laboratories because it a specific and

75

sensitive diagnostic method for detection the novel coronavirus (6). However,

76

rRT-PCR technique strongly relies on complex apparatus, skilled personnel and a

77

stable power supply, the total run time of rRT-PCR test is several hours from the

78

clinical specimens to result reporting. In particular, some regions where outbreaks of

79

COVID-19 emerge usually do not provide sufficient infrastructure for good rRT-PCR

80

diagnostic services, especially for field laboratories and resource-limited settings (7).

81

Hence, there is an urgent requirement for easy-to-use, more rapid and simpler

82

detection techniques for diagnosis of COVID-19.

83

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), which is the most popular

84

isothermal amplification assay, is able to offer a diagnostic testing option for this

85

scenario (8). The details of LAMP mechanism have been described by previous

86

publications (9). Using the LAMP-based protocols, nucleic acid amplification is

87

conducted under isothermal conditions (e.g., in a heating block) with high efficiency,

88

specificity and speed, eliminating the use of precision thermal cycler for thermal

89

change (9, 10). The LAMP technique is highly specific, because recognition of target

90

sequence by six or eight independent regions is required (11). Thus far, LAMP

91

combined with reverse transcription assay (RT-LAMP) had been developed for the

92

detection of multiple respiratory RNA viruses (e.g., influenza viruses, middle east

93

respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) (12).

94

Regarding these traits of LAMP technique, development of a LAMP-based assay for

95

diagnosis of COVID-19 can overcome the shortcomings posed by rRT-PCR methods,

96

and facilitates rapid diagnosis and surveillance of COVID-19.

97

Up to now, two informal published LAMP assays have been developed for

98

diagnosis of COVID-19, and preliminarily evaluated using clinical or stimulated

99

respiratory samples (13, 14). Unfortunately, only a genetic sequence (Open reading

100

frame 1a/b; F1ab) was amplified and detected in the two systems, an unreliable

101

diagnosis result may be obtained when the two COVID-19 LAMP assays detected a

102

sample with high homology sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., bat severe acute

103

respiratory

104

monitoring techniques (e.g., agarose gel electrophoresis, SYBR dyes and PH

105

indicator), which were non-specific for COVID-19 LAMP products, were employed

106

for confirming the two COVID-19 LAMP results. In addition, the electrophoresis is a

107

time-consuming and tedious procedure, and the judgment of color change of reaction

108

vessel by unaided eye is potentially subjective. Therefore, there is a continuous

109

command for devising the new LAMP-based assays, which are capable of

110

simultaneously detecting multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2, providing more rapid and

111

objective result, and facilitating simpler diagnosis.

(Figure 1 and 2). Two target sequences, including F1ab and nucleoprotein gene (np),

115

were simultaneously amplified in an isothermal reaction, and detected in a test step.

116

We will expound the basic COVID-19 RT-LAMP principle, optimize the reaction

117

parameters (e.g., amplification temperature), and demonstrate its feasibility.

119

RESULTS

120

COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS design

121

In the LAMP system (Figure 1), FIP (forward inner primer) initiates the isothermal

122

amplification, and the new strand derived from FIP primer was displaced by the F3

123

(forward primer) synthesis (Step 1). Then, 2 primers, including BIP (backward inner

124

prime) and B3 (backward primer), annealed to the newly produced strand (Step 2),

125

and displacement enzyme (Bst 2.0) extended in tandem generating a dumb-bell form

126

product (Step 3). Thus, the stem-loop stem product can server as the template for the

127

second stage of the LAMP reaction (exponential amplification). The LB* primer

128

(backward loop primer), which was labeled with biotin at the 5' end, could anneal to a

129

distinct product derived from the exponential LAMP reaction stage (Step 4). The LB*

130

product also severed as the template for next amplification by LF* (forward loop

131

primer), which was modified at the 5' end with hapten (Step 5). As a result, a

132

double-labeled detectable product (LF*/LB* product) was formed, and one end of the

133

LF*/LB* product was labeled with hapten, and the other end with biotin (Step 6, 7).

134

One hapten is assigned to one primer set, which provide the possibility for multiplex

135

LAMP detection.

136

A representative schematic of COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS assay were displayed

137

in Figure 2. In the COVID-19 RT-LAMP system, fluorescein (FITC) was assigned to

138

F1ab primer set, and digoxigenin (Dig) for np primer set. Hence, F1ab-LF* and

139

F1ab-LB* primers were labeled at the 5' end with FITC and biotin, and np-LF* and

140

np-LB* for Dig and biotin, respectively (Figure 2A). With the assistance of AMV

141

(avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase), the RNA (SARS-CoV-2 template)

142

was converted to cDNA, which acted as the material for subsequent LAMP

143

amplification (Figure 2B). After 40 min at 63°C, F1ab-LAMP products were

simultaneously labeled with FITC and biotin, and np-LAMP products for Dig and

145

biotin (Figure 2C).

146
147

The principle of NBS visualization of COVID-19 RT-LAMP results

148

As shown in the Figure 3, the result readout of COVID-19 RT-LAMP assay was

149

exhibited using the NBS. The details of NBS was shown Figure 3A (Seen in

150

'Materials and Method' section). For visualization of COVID-19 RT-LAMP results

151

using NBS, aliquots (0.5 µl) of reaction mixtures were deposited into the sample

152

region (Figure 3B, step 1), and an aliquot (80 µl) running buffer then was deposited

153

on the same region (Figure 3B, step 2). At the detection stage, running buffer moves

154

along NBS through capillary action, and rehydrates the SA-DNPS immobilized in the

155

conjugate pad. The end of F1ab-RT-LAMP products labeled with FITC was captured

156

by the anti-FITC antibody located in TL1 region (Test line 1), and the end of

157

np-RT-LAMP products with Dig was captured by anti-Dig antibody located in TL2

158

region (Test line 2). The other ends of F1ab- and np-RT-LAMP products, labeled with

159

biotin, bind streptavidin-conjugated color nanoparticles for visualization (Figure 3B,

160

step 3). The excess streptavidin-conjugated color nanoparticles were captured by

161

biotinylated bovine serum albumin immobilized in CL (Control line), which

162

demonstrated the working condition of NBS (Figure 3B, step 3). The interpretation of

163

the COVID-19 RT-LAMP results using NBS was shown in Figure 3C.

164
165

Confirmation and detection of F1ab-, np- and COVID-19 RT-LAMP products

166

The positive vessels of F1ab-, np- and COVID-19 RT-MCDA assay were visualized

167

as light green using VDR (Visual detection reagent), while the reaction tubes of

168

negative and blank controls remained colorlessness (Figure S1, top row). Using NBS,

169

TL1 and CL were observed on the detection region for positive F1ab-RT-LAMP

170

results, and TL2 and CL for positive np-RT-LAMP results. TL1, TL2 and CL

171

simultaneously appeared on the detection region of NBS for positive COVID-19

172

RT-LAMP results. Only CL appeared on the analysis area of NBS for negative and

173

blank controls of F1ab-, np- and COVID-19 RT-LAMP results (Figure S1, bottom

row). These results indicated that F1ab- and np-LAMP primer sets were available for

175

establish the COVID-19 RT-LAMP NBS assay for rapid and reliable detection of

176

SARS-CoV-2. The parameter of optimal temperature for COVID-19 RT-LAMP

177

technique also was tested, and reaction temperature of 63°C was used for performing

178

the COVID-19 RT-LAMP amplification (Figure S2 and S3).

179
180

Sensitivity of COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS assay

181

The COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS was able to detect down 12 copies (each of

182

F1ab-plasmid and np-plasmid) (Figure 4). Two target genes were detected and

183

identified in a one-tube reaction (Figure 4A). The COVID-19 RT-LAMP results

184

using NBS were in consistent with turbidity and VDR detection (Figure 4B and 4C),

185

while traditional monitoring techniques (VDR and turbidity) could not facilitate

186

multiplex analysis. Furthermore, the sensitivity of COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS assay

187

was in conformity with F1ab- and np-RT-LAMP assay (Figure 4, S4 and S5).

188

The optimal duration time of COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS assay at the isothermal

189

stage also was determined, and the template level at the detection limit appeared three

190

red lines (TL1, TL2 and CL) when the RT-LAMP reaction was carried out only 30

191

min at 63°C (Figure S6). For the RNA template detection, a reverse transcription

192

process (10 min) is essential, thus a COVID-19 RT-LAMP reaction time of 40 min

193

was recommended for detection of clinical samples. Therefore, the whole diagnosis

194

process of COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS, including sample collection (3 min), rapid

195

RNA extraction (15 min), RT-LAMP reaction (40 min) and result interpretation (<2

196

min), was finished approximately 1 h (Figure 5).

197
198

Specificity of RT-LAMP-NBS assay

199

The positive COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS results were obtained only from positive

200

controls (120 copies each of F1ab-plasmid and np-plasmid) (Table S1). The negative

201

results were observed in all pathogens of non-SARS-CoV-2 (virus, bacteria and fungi),

202

in which only a red band (CL) was observed in the biosensor detection regions,

203

indicating no cross-reaction with non-SARS-CoV-2 templates (Table S2).

204

Application of the RT-LAMP-NBS assay in clinical samples

205

Of the total of 129 respiratory samples, which were initially analyzed using rRT-PCR

206

in Sanya People's Hospital in 2020, were enrolled in this report. Particularly, only the

207

RNA templates were used after rRT-PCR performance. Among all the enrolled

208

COVID-19 patients (33), the sensitivity of COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS assay 100%

209

(33/33). The specificity was 100% (96/96) for COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS assay

210

among non-COVID-19 patients, which were diagnosed as having pneumonia with

211

confirmed pathogen in clinical laboratory of SanYa People's Hospital. These

212

preliminary results revealed that the proposed COVID-19 RT-LAMP-BS assay had a

213

high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

214
215

Discussion

216

An ongoing epidemic by SARS-CoV-2, starting in last December 2019 in Wuhan,

217

China, is a huge public health concern (15). As of today (9 March 2020), 98 129 total

218

confirmed cases have been documented, with 80 711 cases in China and the

219

remaining cases distributed other 88 countries/regions in every continent (WHO,

220

COVID-19 Situation Report-46) (16). Hence, there has been an immediate

221

requirement for early, rapid and reliable diagnostic tests in the current outbreak. Such

222

detection techniques are required not only in these countries where SARS-CoV-2

223

infection are spreading but also in countries/regions threated by SARS-CoV-2

224

infection, even in countries/regions where COVID-19 have not yet been emerged.

225

Here, we reported a novel LAMP-based test for simple, rapid and reliable

226

diagnosis of COVID-19, name COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS. Our assay merged

227

LAMP

228

nanoparticles-based biosensor, and facilitated the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a

229

one-step, single-tube reaction. Only simple apparatus (e.g., a water bath or a heating

230

block) were need to maintain a constant temperature (63°C) for 40 min. Compared

231

with the developed COVID-19 RT-LAMP assays, the RT-LAMP results in this report

232

were visually and objectively indicated by NBS, which was a simple and easy-to-use

233

platform, avoiding the requirement of complex process (e.g., electrophoresis), special

234

reagents (e.g., PH indicator) and expensive instrument (e.g., real-time turbidity) (13,

235

14). Total analysis procedure could be complete approximately 1 h, including sample

236

collection (3 min), rapid RNA extraction (15 min), RT-LAMP reaction (40 min) and

237

result interpretation (< 2 min). Considering these traits, COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS

238

assay is a rapid, economical and technically simple method, offering a measure of

239

practicality for field and clinical laboratories, especially for resource-challenged

240

settings.

241

Two RT-LAMP primer sets, including F1ab-RT-LAMP and np-RT-LAMP

242

primer sets, were specifically designed recognizing eight regions of target genes

243

(Figure 6), guaranteeing the high specificity for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The data of

244

analytical specificity revealed that no false-positive results were produced from

245

non-SARS-CoV-2 templates, and positive results were obtained from positive control

246

and SARS-CoV-2 templates (Table S1). Moreover, two targets (F1ab and np genes)

247

could be simultaneously amplified and detected in a 'one-step' RT-LAMP reaction,

248

which further guaranteed the assay's reliability. Thus, our approach could effectively

249

avoid the undesired results yielded from the developed COVID-19 RT-LAMP assays

250

that only amplified and detected a target gene (e.g., F1ab) (13, 14).

251

The data of analytical sensitivity validated that RT-LAMP-NBS assay is

252

sufficiently sensitive for diagnosis of COVID-19. Us this protocol, detection limit of

253

COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS was 12 copies each of F1ab-plasmid and np-plasmid,

254

which is in conformity with assay's sensitivity generated from F1ab-RT-LAMP-NBS

255

and N-RT-LAMP-NBS detection (Figure 4, S4 and S5). The COVID-19

256

RT-LAMP-NBS assay did not improve or decrease the analytical sensitivity when

257

compared with the signlex analysis (F1ab-RT-LAMP and np-RT-LAMP assays). In

258

this report, we did not compare the sensitivity results obtained from COVID-19

259

RT-LAMP-NBS with rRT-PCR assay, because the quality of commercially available

260

test kits for SARS-CoV-2 detection remains uneven. These commercial rRT-PCR

261

assays used in Sanya People's Hospital produce uninform results when they were

262

applied to analyze the 10-fold diluted plasmid templates. For detection the RNA

263

templates extracted from respiratory samples, 100% (33/33) of clinical samples

264

examined by rRT-PCR exhibited completely consistent diagnosis, and analytical

265

specificity was also 100% (96/96) for COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS when analyzing

266

the RNA templates from non-SARS-CoV-2 infection patients.

267
268

Conclusion

269

The one-step single-tube COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS assay devised in this report

270

offers an attractive diagnosis tool for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The nearly

271

equipment-free platform of COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS makes it applicable for

272

resource-limited laboratories (e.g., field laboratories), and the diagnosis results are

273

easy to interpret. The high specificity, sensitivity and feasibility of COVID-19

274

RT-LAMP-NBS assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2, and its low cost and ease of use

275

make the target assay a valuable diagnosis tool for use in field, clinic, public heath

276

and primary care laboratories, especially for resource-poor regions.

294

Two RT-LAMP primer sets (F1ab-RT-LAMP and np-RT-LAMP) were designed

295

according the LAMP mechanism using a specialized software (PrimerExplore V5),

296

which targeted F1ab and np gene of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank MN908947,

297

Wuhan-Hu-1) (Figure 6). Then, a Blast analysis of the GenBank nucleotide database

298

was performed for the F1ab- and np-LAMP primers to validate sequence specificity.

299

The more details of primer design, locations, sequences and modifications were

300

shown in Figure 6 and Table S2. All of the oligomers were synthesized and purified

301

by RuiBo Biotech. Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) at HPLC purification grade.

302
303

Reverse transcription LAMP reaction (RT-LAMP)

304

The conventional RT-LAMP (F1ab- and np-RT-LAMP) was carried out in a one-step

305

reaction in a 25-µl mixture containing 12.5 µl 2×isothermal reaction buffer [40 mM

306

Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 40 mM KCl, 16 mM MgSO4, 20 mM (NH4)2SO4, 2 M betaine and

307

0.2 % Tween-20], 8 U of Bst 2.0 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), 5 U of the

308

310

LF*, LB and LB*, 1.6 µM each of FIP and BIP and template (1µl for the standard

311

plasmid).

312

The COVID-19 RT-LAMP was also performed in a one-step reaction in a 25-µl

313

mixture containing 12.5 µl 2×isothermal reaction buffer [40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8),

314

40 mM KCl, 16 mM MgSO4, 20 mM (NH4)2SO4, 2 M betaine and 0.2 % Tween-20],

315

8 U of Bst 2.0 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), 5 U of the avian

316

myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 1.4 mM dATP, 1.4 mM dCTP,

317

1.4 mM dGTP, 1.4 mM dTTP, 0.25 µM each of F1ab-F3 and F1ab-B3, 0.25 µM each

318

320

and np-LB*, 0.6 µM each of np-FIP and np-BIP and template (1µl for the each

321

standard plasmid, 5µl for samples).

322

The monitoring techniques, including real-time turbidity (LA-320C), visual

323

detection reagents (VDR) and NBS, were employed for confirming the RT-LAMP

reactions and optimizing the reaction parameters (e.g., reaction temperature and

325

isothermal time).

326
327

Sensitivity of the RT-LAMP-NBS assay

328

Two standard plasmids (F1ab-plasmid and np-plasmid) were commercially

329

constructed by Tianyi-Huiyuan Biotech. Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China), which contain the

330

F1ab and np sequences, respectively. Ten-fold serial dilutions (1.2×104 to 1.2×10-2

331

copies) of F1ab-plasmid and np-plasmid were used to evaluate assay's sensitivity. The

332

plasmid concentration at detection limit level was employed for testing the duration

333

time required by COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS assay.

334
335

Specificity of the COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS assay

336

The specificity of the COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS assay was examined by detecting

337

the templates extracted from various pathogens, including viruses, bacteria and fungi

338

(Table S1).

339
340

Feasibility of COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS using clinical samples

341

Respiratory samples were collected from COVID-19 infection patients in SanYa

342

People's Hospital, Hainan, which were defined according to standard diagnosis and

343

treatment criteria of COVID-19 (Trial Version 6). The RNA templates extracted from

344

respiratory samples were used after clinical and laboratory diagnosis, which was

345

conducted using the RT-qPCR kit (Recommended by the China CDC). Collection of

346

these RNA templates and analysis of them were approved by SanYa People's Hospital.

347

5 µl RNA was used as templates for preforming the COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS test.
