Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes acute, highly
transmissible respiratory infection in both humans and wide range of animal species. Its rapid
spread globally and devasting effects have resulted into a major public health emergency
prompting the need for methodological interventions to understand and control its spread. In
particular, The ability to effectively retrace its transmission pathways in outbreaks remains a
major challenge. This is further exacerbated by our limited understanding of its underlying
evolutionary mechanism. Using NGS whole-genome data, we determined whether inter- and
intra-host diversity coupled with bottleneck analysis can retrace the pathway of viral
transmission in two epidemiologically well characterised nosocomial outbreaks in healthcare
settings supported by phylogenetic analysis. Additionally, we assessed the mutational
landscape, selection pressure and diversity of the identified variants. Our findings showed
evidence of intrahost variant transmission and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 after infection These
observations were consistent with the results from the bottleneck analysis suggesting that
certain intrahost variants in this study could have been transmitted to recipients. In both
outbreaks, we observed iSNVs and SNVs shared by putative source-recipients pairs. Majority
of the observed iSNVs were positioned in the S and ORF1ab region. AG, CT and TC nucleotide
changes were enriched across SARS-COV-2 genome. Moreover, SARS-COV-2 genome had
limited diversity in some loci while being highly conserved in others. Overall, Our findings
show that the synergistic effect of combining withinhost diversity and bottleneck estimations
greatly enhances resolution of transmission events in Sars-Cov-2 outbreaks. They also provide
insight into the genome diversity suggesting purifying selection may be involved in the
transmission. Together these results will help in developing strategies to elucidate transmission
events and curtail the spread of Sars-Cov-2

Introduction
The emergence of a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) in the Wuhan district of China, and its rapid spread and increasing death toll
resulted in a public health emergency of international concern in just under two months (Zhu
et al., 2020, WHO, 2020). In South Africa, the first officially diagnosed case of SARS-CoV-2
was reported on March 5, 2020. The strict public health mitigation strategies and nonpharmaceutical interventions played a critical role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in

South Africa, lowering the new cases reported each day to approximately 1500 (as of October
23, 2020; https://www.nicd.ac.za/diseases-a-z-index/covid-19/surveillance-reports/). While
South Africa marks a significant decline in SARS-CoV-2 cases, understanding the patterns of
transmission and underlying selection pressures within and between susceptible host populations
remain critical to control and prevent further outbreaks.

Phylogenetic inference has mainly been used together with epidemiological investigations to
elucidate transmission events and retrace transmission pathways (He et al., 2020, Lauring,
2020, Bajaj and Purohit, 2020, Guo et al., 2020), however, reports of these investigations using
phylogeny only represent the dominant viral lineage and thus provide limited resolution in
transmission analyses (Mavian et al., 2020). Whole genome analyses integrating withinhost
diversity have been proposed as a better alternative in order to capture the complete genetic
architecture including divergent, transient and deleterious variants in viral populations
represented within a given host(Sanjuan et al., 2004). Indeed, several studies have already
revealed the existence of large numbers of withinhost viral populations in SARS-CoV-2
(Wolfel et al., 2020, Shen et al., 2020, Lythgoe et al., 2020, Butler et al., 2020). Genomic and
quasispecies analyses showed large numbers intra-host nonsynonymous mutations in
nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases (Zhou et al., 2020a,

Siqueira et al., 2020). Intrahost single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) were were also observed in
bronchoal-veolar lavage fluid samples of of 8 SARS-CoV-2 patients(Shen et al., 2020). And
Wang et al. (2020) reported samples carrying the same consensus sequences exhibiting
different iSNVs. Interestingly, Shen et al. (2020) could not confirm the transmission of iSNVs
across two confirmed source-recipient pairs in the Wuhan area, suggesting either the effect of
strong purifying selection or stochastic occurrence of variants within the host(Shen et al.,
2020). It therefore remains unclear whether intrahost single-nucleotide variants can enhance
resolution of transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.

Furthermore, it has been reported that majority of variants identified tend to be a result of
stochastic effects and selection pressure thus without any functional effect. Others, however,
in combination with the host genetic profile, can produce viral genotypes with altered
pathogenicity and improved host adaptation (Lucas et al., 2001, Gojobori et al., 1990). It is
therefore important to understand the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2, the implication of
identified mutations and evolutionary pressure on the virus beyond interhost single nucleotide
variantion level. This is particularly due to the fact that little is currently known about the
evolutionary dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 owing to the differential evolution of the virus
across distinct populations.

Leveraging our existing genomic and epidemiology data (Giandhari et al., 2020, Pillay et al.,
2020) from two well characterized nosocomial Sars-Cov-2 outbreaks in healthcare settings
with advances in whole genome analysis, we performed indepth analysis of the transmission
patterns and pathways of Sars-Cov-2. We further describe in detail the distributions of inter
and intrahost single-nucleotides variants and characterize evolution of the virus across the
SARS-CoV-2 genome. We show that combining withinhost diversity and bottleneck

estimation presents a major tool to retrace the pathway of viral transmission in an Sars-Cov-2
outbreaks.

Methods
Sample Collection and Detection of SARS-CoV-2
Data analyses in this study comprised of 109 SARS-CoV-2 cases from two nosocomial
outbreaks from within healthcare settings in the Kwazulu-Natal province of South Africa. The
first outbreak was a 4 weeklong outbreak where phylogenetic analysis supported the hypothesis
of a single introduction leading to multiple chains of transmission within the hospital. The
second outbreak occured a little later but still at a time of relatively limited community
transmission within in a specific section of the hospital. The clustering was supported by
phylogenetic analysis, but the precise introduction of the virus was not clear, and the precise
chains of transmission were not elucidated. The CH1 outbreak has been further described in
detail by (Giandhari et al., 2020, Pillay et al., 2020) and in a genomic epidemiology report by
Lessels et al. (2020) (https://www.krisp.org.za/news.php?id=421). Clinical specimens from the
one hundred and nine symptomatic cases were tested COVID-19 and infection status was
confirmed using comparative real-time qPCR

onto a 500-cycle MiSeq Nano Reagent Kit v2 nano v2 Miseq reagent kit and run on the Illumina
MiSeq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) as previously described (Pillay et al., 2020)

Assembled sequence and iSNV analysis
Consensus genomes used in the study were generated following a standard bioinformatics
protocol available at (protocols.io/private/CD7108C5B73211EA89B10A58A9FEAC2A)
(Cleemput et al., 2020). We used a modified version (NC_045512.3) of the NC_045512.2
reference strain from the Swiss Institute for Bioinformatics (SIB) available at
https://github.com/jsan4christ/Sars-Cov2-Refs/blob/master/NC_045512.2-sib.gb, to call and
annotate variants. We used LoFreq v.2.1.5 (Wilm et al., 2012) to call variants from the mpileup
files generated using samtools software (version 1.8) (Li et al., 2009). Only variants called at
a sequencing depth of ≥10 reads and with a minor allele frequency of ≥5% were considered for
further downstream analysis. Positions with more than one minor allele were filtered out to
minimize the false discovery of variants. Variants not found in coding regions of the genome
were also filtered out. Variants were then annotated using snpEff v. 4.5 (Cingolani et al.,
2012b) and variation effects filtered using SnpSift v.4.3t (Cingolani et al., 2012a).

Genetic Diversity
We estimated genetic diversity and the non-synonymous to synonymous diversity ratios using
SNPGenie (Nelson et al., 2015). The between-group mode of SNPGenie was used to evaluate
the mean dN and dS between the outbreaks while default mode (SNPGenie.pl) was used to
estimate diversity for sites in protein-coding sequences of each sample from the associated
VCF reports.

Transmission Analyses
To determine the iSNVs shared between related cases and the possibility of transmission, we
compared variant calling results of putative source-recipient pairs of samples. For CH1, we
leveraged known source-recipient pairs while all samples were treated as a potential source and
potential recipient in the CH3 outbreak due to a lack of putative source-recipient links. We then
applied the betal-binomial model, as implemented in the BB Bottleneck software (Sobel
Leonard et al., 2017), to estimate the founding population of the virus in the recipient. The beta
binomial model is superior to the mutation counting method in its ability to account for variant
calling thresholds and stochastic viral replication dynamics within the recipient hostv(Sobel
Leonard et al., 2017). To generate the source-recipient frequencies required as input to BB
bottleneck, we followed the approach described by (Sapoval et al., 2020). Briefly, for the
source, where the alternative allele frequency was > 0.5, the reference allele was taken as the
minor allele and the frequency as 1 – AF (Allele Frequency). We considered the minor allele
from the source as the reference or alternate allele, for the recipient,. In case the minor allele
does not exists, the position was assigned a frequency of 0. Finally, all positions had to be
supported by atleast 10 reads to be considered both for the source and recipient.

Results

This study included a total of 109 SARS-CoV-2 cases. Clinical characteristics of individuals
are reported in Supplementary Table 1. The 109 cases were further categorized by outbreak as
CH1 (35/109, 32%) and CH3 (74/109, 68%). Of the 35 samples collected from CH1 that were
available for our analysis, 13 (37.1%) had putative transmission linkages that were
phylogenetically supported(Figure 1a). Samples from the beginning of the CH3 outbreak
(24/74, 32.4%) that were part of the epidemiologically investigation were grouped by
department and social networks (Figure 1b). Phylogenetic analysis further grouped these

Allele frequencies and mutational landscape in SARS-CoV-2 genes
All 109 whole-genome sequences analyzed yielded near full-length genomes with coverage
greater than 90% and the average read depth ranged from 158.71 – 5046.56 (Supplementary
Table 2). The read depth did not have any impact on the minor allele frequency. In total, 2552
iSNVs were identified across 109 CH1 and CH3 samples at MAF >5% (Figure 2A). The
majority of these nucleotide changes occurred in CH1 than CH3 samples, with the exception
of GC (42 vs 49) and GT (111 vs 130). We also observed 940 SNVs, with different mutational
patterns to iSNVs. These include CT (n= 412), AG (n=201), GA (n=100) as the most prevalent.
The frequency of the SNVs was high in CH3 samples compared to CH1. In terms of location
in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, a large fraction of iSNVs and SNVs were found within the S
gene and non-structural proteins of the ORF1ab gene, specifically in the NSP3 protein
(Supplementary Table 3).

The 3492 iSNVs and SNVs were further categorized as 2376 non-synonymous, followed by
997 synonymous, and 119 nonsense (stop lost/gained) (Table 1, Supplementary Table 3). Of
the observed iSNVs, the majority of non-synonymous (1121 vs 652), synonymous (392 vs 278)
and nonsense (71 vs 63) were found in the CH1 samples compared to CH3 samples. In contrast,
a large fraction of non-synonymous (421 vs 182), synonymous (264 vs 63) SNVs were found
in the CH3 than in CH1 samples, with the exception of CH1 nonsense SNV (7 vs 3). The iSNVs
were distributed in 11 protein-coding viral genes with variable frequencies, with ORF1ab gene
harbouring the majority of non-synonymous and synonymous variants compared to other
genes. Figure 2B shows that the most frequent iSNVs were found in the non-structural proteins
(NSP)8 (A12240G in 24/109 samples), NSP14 (G18181T in 22/109 samples), S (T21667G in
21/109 samples), NSP9 an NSP13 had A11556T and A13003G in 20 samples, respectively.
We also observed a high density of polymorphic SNVs A23403G (109/109 in S gene),
C14408T (109/109 in NSP12), C3037T (104/109 in NSP3) in the analyzed samples. Other
genes (E, M and N) and proteins (NSP10, NSP11, NSP16, NSP5, NSP4, NSP7, ORF10, ORF6,
ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF8) were well conserved, with frequencies <5% for both iSNVs and
SNVs.

Here, we used consensus mutations to explore the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2
within and across samples of thirteen in-hospital patients and healthcare workers (HW). In our
report into a nosocomial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections at one of the private hospitals in
Durban, phylogenetic inferences showed that inpatient-3 (P3, source) infected by the index
patient sustained the chains of transmission generating secondary clusters of recipients
including HW4 and P7. These findings were supported by common mutations (C241T,
C3037T, C14408T, A23403G) found in the viral consensus sequences of (P3, Cluster1) and its
putative recipients (P5, P7, P20, P27 and P29) (Table 2). In addition, P5, P20, P27 and P29
also developed an additional mutation C16376T. Similar mutations were found in the
secondary clusters 2 (HW4), and 3 (P7) with additional mutations found in consensus
sequences of patient P26 (A16561C) and X1 (C2997T) in cluster 3. Development of additional
mutation could be attributed to multiple transmitted strains, selection pressure within the host
or some positions being prone to mutations.

Transmission dynamics of shared intrahost variants between samples
Here, we investigated whether minor alleles with a frequency of 5% or higher observed varied
between the epidemiologically infered source and recipients and whether these can be
indicative of transmission events within the CH1 and CH3 hospital outbreaks. From the thirteen
CH1 samples analyzed, we observed 615 iSNVs. The CH1 iSNVs consisted of 442 nonsynonymous, 146 synonymous and 27 nonsense variants (Supplementary Table 3). We
assessed the evidence for the transmission of shared iSNVs between samples. We found that
HW4 (source) was most likely to have transmitted eleven iSNVs to the recipient P11 and three

of which were positively selected for and later established as SNV (Figure 3A, Table 3). In
addition, P7 potentially passed on nine iSNVs to P23 (Figure 3B) and sixteen to X1. Of those
sixteen, three were later established as SNVs (Figure 3C). Furthermore, P3 shared seven iSNVs
with P5 (Figure 3D) and P7 (Figure 3E). P3 was likely to have transmitted four iSNVs to P10,
one of which later established as an SNV (Figure 3F). There were eleven shared iSNVs
between P3 and P20, with two later established as SNVs (Figure 3G). P3 shared nine iSNVs
with P29, with three later established as SNVs (Figure 3H). In contrast, there was no evidence
of shared iSNVs between P3 (source) and recipient P27. Similarly, sources HW4 did not share
any iSNVs with the recipient P15. Thirty five (i)SNVs were shared by two or more samples
(Supplementary Figure S1). These findings are consistent with the results from the bottleneck
analysis, albeit a much smaller founding population estimated to range from one to three (Table
3). Based on these findings, we see that three of the eleven pairs are were not directly related
and could potentially have alternate infection sources.

We also explored CH3 samples for co-occurring iSNV as indicative of transmission events in

leveraged pairwise sample comparison and bottleneck estimations to explore putative

transmission events within and between departments and social networks. Thus we generated
5402 potential source-recipient pairs from seventy four patients and explored the presence of
source iSNVs as iSNVs or SNVs in the respective recipient. Among observed iSNVs, the
majority of pairs (4151/5402) had no shared iSNVs while 1251/5402 pairs had one or more
iSNV (Figure 4A). In terms of nucleotide position of shared iSNVs, we observed two positions
21665 and 21667 found in 227 and 440 pairs that exhibited strong signals for shared iSNVs,
respectively (Figure 4B). Other noticeable positions with strong signals for shared iSNVs were
25653 and 25666, respectively. In CH3 samples, HW7 was identified as the most likely source
of infection by the epidemiological investigation supported by phylogenetic inference.
However, this was not supported by number of shared iSNVs and bottleneck estimates. HW7
shared not more than 2 iSNVs with the cases that were clustered together by phylogeny.
(Supplementary Table 4)(Figure 1C). HW19 and HW20 were from the same household and
shared upto eighteen iSNVs. They also had bottleneck estimates of 3 in the direction HW19 to
HW20 and estimated size of 6 when swapped around (HW20 to HW19), suggesting that HW20
was the more likely source of infection to HW19. HW25 also shared 17 and 20 iSNVs with
HW19 and HW20 suggesting possible transmission of the virus from HW19 to HW25.
Overall, these findings suggest that certain intrahost variants in this study could have been
transmitted to recipients; however, most intrahost variants occurred after transmission.

selected for and therefore established as clade or lineage defining. Using the upset plot (Figure
2C), we further captured the intersections between iSNVs and SNVs in the CH1 and CH3
datasets to identify frequently and universally occurring iSNVs. 10 mutations occurred in CH1
and CH3 independently. We also found 37 and 63 iSNVs that occurred as SNVs in atleast one
CH1 and CH3 sample, respectively. Variants T20135A and A14523G occurred as iSNVs and
SNVs in both outbreaks. Figure 2D shows the Shannon diversity observed along the SARSCoV-2 genome. iSNVs progressing to SNV are likely of interest for further research.

Selection pressure in the SARS-CoV-2 genome
To assess impact of selection pressure on transmission dynamics and establishment of the virus
within and between hosts, first, we estimated the nucleotide diversity (π) and genetic
complexity (Sn) of CH1 and CH3 samples using pairwise comparison for each protein-coding
gene. We observed median diversity (median = 0.00004) within the samples analyzed with
diversity varying between 0 and 0.001. We then analysed diversity by comparing the nonsynonymous to synonymous ratios (πN/πS) to determine the nature of selection pressure
affecting the sample’s nucleotide diversity from both outbreaks. CH3 samples exhibited a low
mean Sn (KS test: p-value < 10−8) and mean π (KS test: p-value < 10−8) compared to CH1
samples (Figure 5A & B). We further compared the non-synonymous and synonymous
diversity ratios between the two outbreaks. CH1 ratios were significantly higher (median
πN/πS: 0.0004) than CH3 ratios (median πN/πS: 0.00003 and KS test: p-value < 6.8−4) (Figure
5C & D). We classified our samples according to selection pressure on the viral population
withinhost. In CH1, 8% (3/35) of the samples exhibited neutral selection, 31% (11/35) were
under positive selection while the majority, 60% (21/35), were under purifying selection. We
observed a similar trend in CH3 with 8% (6/74) under neutral selection, 21% (16/74) under
positive selection and 70% (52/74) under purifying selection. Diversity analysis of ORFs

within the genome revealed positive selection in N, ORF1ab, ORF3a and S (Figure 5E).
Overall, our diversity results correlate with the high conservation (>90%) observed between
SARS-COV-2 genomes (Khan et al., 2020). We also applied the between-group mode of
SNPGenie to further compare the diversities between CH1 and CH3 at a consensus level. The
highest dN/dS ratios between group were observed in N (9.12) followed by S, ORF7a (>3),
ORF3a (>2) and ORF9b (>1) (Table 4). Overall, there was no significant difference between
the nature of selection pressure observed across the two outbreaks (KS test, p-value = 1).
However, the genome-wide πN/πS ratios suggest that SARS-COV-2 intrahost and interhost
diversities in the population are mostly under purifying selection.

Discussion
In the present study, we assessed the utility of intrahost diversity in the elucidation of
transmission events between hosts. We confirmed that our analysis could bring better
resolution to transmission events. The synergy of intrahost diversity and bottleneck estimation
brough more support to the introduction of virus and direction of transmission between sourcerecipient pairs in both outbreaks. Of the 11 source-recipient pairs from CH1, eight shared
intrahost variants, suggesting person to person transmission of intrahost variants was possible
in SARS-COV-2. In addition, these transmission patterns were further supported by bottleneck
analysis, with estimated bottleneck sizes between 1 and 3. Likewise, three pairs without any

shared iSNVs also lacked bottleneck supports suggesting that infact, these pairs might not be
related as initially implied by the epidemiological investigation and phylogenetic inference.
Futhermore, using shared iSNVs and bottleneck estimates between CH3 source-recipient pairs,
we brought additional support to the epidemiologically infered transmission patterns that were
originally not clear from phylogenetic analysis. We show that indeed HW7 is a probable source
of introduction of the virus, but also highlight HW10, HW11, HW15 and HW16 as possible
candidates. We also show that HW20 most likely infected HW19 using bottleneck estimates.
The narrow transmission bottleneck observed in these outbreaks may be attributed to a small
number of virions that crossed the host cell barrier and established infection or deleterious
stochastic dynamics within the respiratory tract (Wang et al., 2020). Another reason for narrow
transmissions could be attributed to the merging or adaptive evolution of the virus, which could
potentially affect the virus’s antigenicity and pathogenicity (Berngruber et al., 2013). Some
samples however, had very high bottleneck estimates above 50 virions (mean deviation range
of 57 to 1000).

In order to understand the impact of selection pressures on the patterns of variation represented
in the transmission events, we assessed the frequency and diversity of inter- and intra-host
variants identified . We found an excess of AG, CT, TC and GA mutations in both iSNVs and
SNVs across all samples analyzed. In addition, we found that ORF1ab gene harboured the
majority of non-synonymous and synonymous variants compared to other genes. Between the
outbreaks, CH3 samples has a low mean Sn and mean π compared to CH1 samples.
Furthermore, there was evidence of unique or shared iSNVs between the samples in both
outbreaks. In both outbreaks, the mutational spectrum of new mutations seems enriched in AG,
CT, TC and GA mutations. S gene had the largest fraction of iSNV and SNV mutational
patterns, followed by ORF1a protein such as NSP3 and NSP12. Particularly, S gene was

dominated by GA and AT mutations, NSP3 by CT, GA, TA and TC mutations and NSP12 had
CA dominance, both for iSNVs and SNVs. Mutations GT in the NSP14; GC and TG in the S
were also common in the SARS-COV-2 genome. These findings are consistent with previous
studies that found enrichment of CT mutations in the ORF1a gene (Di Giorgio et al., 2020,
Sapoval et al., 2020). It has been suggested that the CT mutation enrichment in the SARSCOV-2 genome is likely driven by host response to counter the virus through the APOBEC
and ADAR deaminase activity. These studies also note that mutation changes in AG and TC
in the SARS-COV-2 genome were mediated by the actions of ADARs while GA mutations
were derived from APOBEC-mediated C-to-U deamination (Di Giorgio et al., 2020, Sapoval
et al., 2020, Roth et al., 2019, Porath et al., 2014). These findings suggest that S gene and
ORF1ab gene had higher substitution rates and observed changes of the SARS-COV-2 genome
might be hyper-edited by APOBEC and ADAR.
When assessing the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 within the two outbreaks, we found
that ORF1ab, N, ORF3a and S were relatively diverse (Figure 5E). Diversity analysis between
the two the two oubreaks further showed signals of strong positive selection in the N gene, S
and ORF7a. Positive selection was also seen in ORF3a and ORF9b (Table 4). On the other
hand, ORF1ab, OFR14 and M exhibited purifying selection suggesting that these gene products
did not undergo adequate immune pressure resulting in amino acid changes. This is consistent
with other studies that reported strong evolutionary pressure in N, S and ORFs regions (Zhou
et al., 2020b, Cagliani et al., 2020) causing them to evolve faster. It has been shown that
ORF1ab encodes proteins involved in SARS-CoV pathogenesis, virulence, virus-cell
interaction and alterations of virus-host responses by modifying cellular signaling and gene
expression (Graham et al., 2008). ORF1ab has also been reported to encode 16 non-structural
proteins that are highly conserved (Khan et al., 2020). ORF3a, localized in the Endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) and Golgi region, is a transmembrane protein responsible for activating the

PKR-like ER kinase signaling pathway to protect viral proteins against ER-associated
degradation. Rapid accumulation of non-synonymous mutations in the ORF3a gene could
increase the fitness of the viral population and help to escape host immune response, making
it hard to eliminate and promoting viral spread (Issa et al., 2020, Minakshi et al., 2009).
In summary, we showed that combining withinhost diversity and bottleneck estimates can
bring greater resolution to transmission analyses by providing insights into both chains of
infection and direction of transmission. We also showed a complex landscape of intrahost
diversity and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 after infection, with a predominance of purifying
selection explaining the small number of shared intrahost variants inspite of larger estimated
founding population. This study therefore enhanced our understanding of potential viral
transmissions within and across SARS-CoV-2 cases and shed light on the use of intrahost
variants and bottleneck estimates to retrace the pathway of viral transmission in a population.
Results obtained from this study strongly support additional research on the role of the
observed intrahost variants in SARS-COV-2 antigenicity and pathogenicity to shed light on
biological mechanisms driving the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 and complicated disease
progression.
