Abstract
The clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is highly
variable with the vast majority recovering uneventfully but a small fraction
progressing to severe disease and death. Appropriate and timely supportive care
can reduce mortality and it is critical to evolve better patient risk stratification
based on simple clinical data, so as to perform effective triage during strains on
the healthcare infrastructure. This study presents risk stratification and mortality
prediction models based on usual clinical data from 544 COVID-19 patients
from New Delhi, India using machine learning methods. An XGboost classifier
yielded the best performance on risk stratification (F1 score of 0.81). A logistic
regression model yielded the best performance on mortality prediction (F1 score
of 0.71). Significant biomarkers for predicting risk and mortality were identified.
Examination of the data in comparison to a similar dataset with a Wuhan cohort
of 375 patients was undertaken to understand the much lower mortality rates in
India and the possible reasons thereof. The comparison indicated higher survival
rate in the Delhi cohort even when patients had similar parameters as the Wuhan
patients who died. Steroid administration was very frequent in Delhi patients,

especially in surviving patients whose biomarkers indicated severe disease. This
study helps in identifying the high-risk patient population and suggests treatment
protocols that may be useful in countries with high mortality rates.

Introduction

1

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global health emergency of international concern.
Originating in Wuhan, China, the disease has spread to the rest of the world.
As of December 17, 2020, WHO states that about 10 million confirmed cases of
COVID-19 have been detected in India alone, making the number of cases in the
country 15% of the total cases worldwide and the second largest affected nation
after the United States. Due to the sudden spike in the number of cases, healthcare
systems across the world including India’s are under tremendous pressure for
making tough decisions in resource allocation among affected patients. Early
risk stratification through identification of key biomarkers is essential because it
helps in the understanding of the relative severity among infected patients and
hence guides decisions in the scare medical resource setting.
COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory infection with symptoms that
include fever, dry cough, nasal congestion and breathing difficulties [1, 2]. In
more severe cases, it can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome,
cardiac arrest, sepsis, kidney failure and death [3, 4]. WHO classifies the risk
into the following categories: critical, severe, and moderate/mild. By definition,
critical patients require ventilation, severe patients require supplemental oxygen,
moderate patients have pneumonia but do not require oxygen, and mild patients
only have upper respiratory tract disease. The cause of death is generally
respiratory failure, but few deaths have been caused by multiple organ failure
(MOF) or chronic comorbidities [2, 5]. Those at a higher risk are the elderly and
people with comorbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes [6, 7].
However, symptoms at onset are relatively mild and a significant proportion of
patients do not show apparent symptoms prior to the development of respiratory
failure [2, 5]. Clinically, this makes it difficult to predict the progression of
severity in patients until respiratory failure develops. Early risk prediction and
effective treatment can reduce mortality and morbidity as well as relieve resource
shortages [8]. Artificial intelligence based solutions may help in clinical decisionmaking by providing predictions that are accurate, fast, and interpretable. Recent
studies have used various machine learning algorithms for analysing COVID-19
patients’ clinical data and providing disease prognosis [9, 10]. Hao et al. [11]
examined COVID-19 patients admitted in Massachusetts to predict level-of-care
requirements based on clinical and laboratory data. They compared machine
learning algorithms (such as XGBoost, Random Forests, SVM, and Logistic
Regression) and predicted the need for hospitalization, ICU care, and mechanical
ventilation. The most effective features for hospitalization were vital signs, age,
BMI, dyspnea, and comorbidities. Opacities on chest imaging, age, admission
vital signs and symptoms, male gender, admission laboratory results, and diabetes
were the most effective risk factors for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation.

Xie et al. [12] used multivariable logistic regression for the classification task
through identifying SpO2, Lymphocyte Count, Age and Lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) as the set of important features. A nomogram was created based on these
features to deliver the probability of mortality. Ji et al. [13] built a scoring model,
named as CALL, for prediction of progression risk in COVID-19 patients from
Chinese hospitals. They used Multivariate Cox regression to identify risk factors
associated with progression, which were then incorporated into a nomogram for
establishing a prediction scoring model. Comorbidity, older age, lower lymphocyte
count, and higher lactate dehydrogenase were found to be independent high-risk
factors for COVID-19 progression. Yan et al. proposed an interpretable mortality
prediction model for COVID-19 patients [14]. They analysed blood samples of
485 patients from Wuhan, China, and created a clinically operable single tree
through XGBoost. The model used three crucial features Lactate Dehydrogenase
(LDH), lymphocyte (%) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP). The decision rules with
the three features and their thresholds were devised recursively. This provided an
interpretable machine learning solution with at least 90% accuracy. Karthikeyan
et al. [15] analysed the same dataset through comparing various machine learning
algorithms. XGBoost feature selection and neural network classification yielded
the best performance with the important biomarkers selected as neutrophil (%),
lymphocyte (%), LDH, CRP and age. However, no detailed studies on risk
stratification have not been done on Indian cohorts.
Most machine learning based risk stratification and mortality prediction algorithms analysed patients from China or the United States of America. Studies
have suggested that the virus has different strains around the globe due to mutations [16–20]. Moreover, the physiologic response to the virus and the eventual
course of disease depends on regional factors such as population characteristics
and hospital practices. Hence, the studies are not universally applicable and it
is critical to examine cohorts from India to aid the Indian healthcare systems.
In this study, patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from MAX group
of hospitals in New Delhi, India were examined to identify the key features
affecting severity and mortality. The machine learning models built using these
key features aid in risk stratification and mortality prediction. The mortality
rate in the Indian population is low compared to China and other countries.
Hence a comprehensive comparison between the cohorts from New Delhi and
Wuhan has been done, and analysis with respect to treatment protocols were
explored to identify possible factors for such a difference [14].

Data acquisition and Participants

The data in this study was collected from patients with confirmed diagnosis of
COVID-19 at MAX group of Hospitals in New Delhi, India between June 3rd
and October 23rd, 2020. The patient records were collected and anonymized
at the data warehouse of CSIR-IGIB. A total of 544 patients with a clear final
outcome were considered in our study. Among these, diagnostic lab reports were

available as a time series of test results. The data collected contains 357 distinct
parameters (or biomarkers) that include vitals, symptoms, co morbid conditions
and lab reports from 161 different tests along with the medicines administered
for treatment. Multiple tests were recorded for each patient during their stay at
the hospital, varying from 1 to 134 records per patient.

Patients were categorized into risk levels-based on the severity of their condition
during their stay at the hospital. Although a description of the severity of each
patient is not available, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disorder that effects
the lungs, the amount of care provided to a patient with respect to respiratory
support was considered as an indicator of severity. Considering the size of
the dataset and the levels of respiratory support provided all the patient were
categorized into two levels mild and severe where all patients who died or who
were under some form of respiratory support or whose condition was specifically
mentioned to be severe were categorized into severe/high risk group and all the
remaining patients were put under mild/low risk group. The resulting dataset
follows the data distribution as shown in Table 1.
The 15 most frequent tests corresponding to 38 biomarkers were selected for
analysis based on the availability of data. Five biomarkers WBC count, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte monocyte ration (LMR), neutrophil
monocyte ratio (NMR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were manually calculated from various blood cell counts available owing their reported importance
in predicting mortality due to COVID [21, 22]. 209 unique co-morbid conditions
were observed in patients in our study. To analyse them without exploding the
number of features and to avoid an increase in chances of over fitting due to
increase in dimensionality, we grouped all the encountered co-morbid conditions
into 7 groups based on the area or organ that the condition effects as shown
in Table S1. Four more groups: diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and
cancer were considered due to their reported importance in mortality risk due
to COVID-19 [7]. This information was encoded into 11 binary features, each
representing one group where a sample assumes a value one if the patient has
one or more co-morbid conditions that fall into that group. To incorporate and
analyse the effects of medical prescriptions the information regarding prescription
of steroids and antiviral drugs was encoded into two binary features.
This leads to 70 unique parameters measured which include 11 grouped
co-morbid conditions, 14 clinical parameters, 2 RT-PCR genomic parameters
and 43 lab test results. An exhaustive list of categorical parameters can be
found in Table S1 and continuous parameters can be found in Table S2. To
evaluate the significance of each parameter considered for risk stratification and
mortality prediction, we calculated the p value using the Chi-Squared test [23]
for the categorical features and using the ANOVA f-value test for the continuous
features.

Comparison with Wuhan cohort

127

In our study, we evaluated how machine learning models trained on non-Indian
cohorts perform in predicting mortality on the Indian cohort. We used the best
performing model reported by Karthikeyan et.al [15] for predicting mortality
using data from Wuhan, China [14] to examine its applicability on the Indian
cohort. The Wuhan cohort comprises of data collected from 375 patients who were
admitted to Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. The model evaluated is a neural network
trained to predict mortality from CRP, LDH, neutrophil (%) lymphocyte(%)
and age. For predicting mortality in Indian Cohort using the same model, we
selected 3092 datapoints where at least 3 of the required 5 features were present.
KNN imputation was done to take care of the missing features.
We also explored the differences between Wuhan and New Delhi cohorts in
key biomarkers across survivors and the dead [14, 15, 24]. We choose mortality as
the indicator for comparison as it does not depend on subjective labelling. The
feature density histograms were analyzed to examine the variations in biological
parameters across survivors and the dead between cohorts of Wuhan and Delhi.
The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (K-S test) [25] was used to analyze variations
in the density distributions of the important biomarkers between both classes
across cohorts. The K-S test is a non-parametric test that quantifies the distance
between the empirical distributions of samples sampled from two distributions.

before [14, 15]. Each sample has a dimensionality equal to the number of unique
parameters measured across all lab tests considered for the analysis. The values

in a sample are filled in with the test results that a particular sample represents
and the rest of the values are left empty. These parameter values that are left
empty are imputed with the nearest value of the parameter from the patient’s
past test results. Some samples may still have missing parameters if a patient
does not undergo a particular test. Such missing values are imputed with the
median of the respective parameter across the train set. Patient demographics
and vitals data were recorded once per patient and were added to each sample
where they are kept the same for all the samples of a particular patient. This
leads to 15648 samples from 544 patients where each sample contains 70 unique
parameters. The resulting dataset follows the data distribution as shown in
Figure 2.
To build and validate machine learning models we split patients with respect
to the day of outcome. 429 patients with clear outcome by 11 September 2020
were considered for model development, and the remaining 115 patients were
considered as a part of a holdout test set. This method of splitting is adopted as
models developed will be used to aid future patients where it is known that the
COVID-19 and responses of its infected patients may change with time [16–19].
The day wise distribution of samples in both the train and test sets for risk
stratification and mortality prediction is shown in Figures S1 and S2, respectively.

Among the 70 features chosen for analysis, selecting the most influential biomarkers for risk stratification and mortality prediction by eliminating redundant or
unimportant parameters is crucial to avoid over-fitting when the size of the
dataset is small. Moreover, a lower number of features would mean cheaper and
faster tests for efficient risk profiling given the high influx of patients on a daily
basis and subsequently increased efficiency of the decision-making process of the

healthcare systems.
The relative importances provided by an XGBoost classifier fit on the training
data for a particular task is used as the measure of importance for selecting
features. XGBoost is a powerful decision-tree-based ensemble algorithm that
uses a gradient boosting framework and estimates features that are the most
discriminative of model outcomes [26]. The relative importance of each feature
is determined by its accumulated use in each decision step in each tree of the
ensemble.
The number of features to utilize for model training was obtained by iteratively
training an XGboost model on a collection of the top K most important features
while increasing K by 1 in each iteration. The collection of features that achieved
the best performance for 5-fold cross validation on the training set was considered
as the set of key features to train the final models. The feature importances were
obtained separately for the binary risk stratification and mortality prediction
models. The classification performance for selecting the optimal set of features is
evaluated using AUC score for risk stratification and average precision score for
mortality prediction. Average precision score is used for mortality prediction due
to the heavy imbalance of samples representing fatal cases in mortality prediction.

After obtaining the collection of important features, duplicates that arose due
to the elimination of less important features were removed from the train set.
The set was then normalized to a range of 0-1 using min-max scaler to avoid
any biases due to differences in scales across parameters. The train set was then
resampled using the SMOTE algorithm to reduce bias that may arise due to
the class imbalance observed. The SMOTE algorithm was chosen to generate
synthetic samples of the minority class due to its good performance. Various
algorithms were trained and compared on the resampled dataset to classify the
samples depending on the task, either risk stratification or mortality prediction,
with their respective feature set. We also built another set of models trained on
only patient vitals to gauge the prediction performance that can be achieved
with data acquired before blood test results.

The hold out test data of 115 patients was normalized with min-max scaler to a
range of 0-1 using the min-max statistics obtained from the training set. Then
the models built were evaluated on the test set. We report the F1-scores of the
algorithms as the mean and standard deviation of performance of trained models
from 5-fold cross validation on the test set. F1-score is preferred over AUC and
accuracy as it is better in measuring performance when data imbalance exists.
The model achieving the best performance was then tested and analysed on the
set of samples corresponding to each individual day for a period of 14 days before
the final outcome to observe relevant trends.

Evaluation Metrics

227

The following metrics were recorded to assess the predictive performance of the
supervised models. Formulae for the calculation of all metrics are given below.
Here, TP, TN, FP, and FN stand for true positive, true negative, false positive
and false negative rates, respectively.
AUC (Area under ROC curve):AUC measures the area under the receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots true positive rate against false
positive rate. AUC is also commonly used in situations where the data has
imbalanced classes, as the ROC measures performance over many different
thresholds.
• True Positive Rate (TPR):This measures how often the model predicts that
a patient will survive when the person survives.

• False Positive Rate (FPR): This measures how often the model predicts
that a patient survives when the person actually does not survive:

F1 Score: The F1 score measures the harmonic mean of precision of recall and is
often preferred to accuracy when the data has imbalanced classes:

Patient Characteristics

A comparison of different clinical features between low and high-risk patients
was carried out. Tables S1-S4 show the differences in categorical and continuous
features between high and low risk groups, and between survivors and the dead.
The KS test showed that none of the continuous features followed a normal
distribution and hence the medians and interquartile ranges are reported. The
patients’ age ranged between the age of 9 and 98 years with the median age 58
(48-66) years. The median age for the high-risk patients was 61 (53-68) years
while for the low-risk patients it was 53 (41-64) years. Out of the 544 patients,
164 (30.15%) were females while 380 (69.85%) were males. The blood clotting

(D-Dimer, Ferritin), inflammation (CRP, LDH) and immune features (NLR,
LMR, NMR, PLR and IL6) were significantly different for the low and high-risk
groups. However, a significant overlap was observed in most of the parameters
both when comparing the high-risk vs. low-risk and survived vs. dead categories
precluding the possibility of the development of simple classification models.

Machine learning models for predicting mortality based on patients’ blood
parameters have been reported, however, it is necessary to ascertain whether
these models are generalizable. Karthikeyan et.al. [15] built a neural network that
predicted mortality in Wuhan cohort with an accuracy of 96.5%±0.6% using only
five parameters, age, lymphocyte (%), neutrophil (%), LDH and CRP. The same
model when tested on the Indian cohort (current dataset) predicted mortality
with an accuracy of only 58%. The drop in performance of the model when tested
on the Indian group shows that there is a significant difference between the two
cohorts. Figure 3 demonstrates that the Neural Net was performing much better
in identifying the patients who died (precision 84.85%) over those who survived
(precision 49.54%). This suggests that the patients who were expected to die
based on the findings from Wuhan data were actually surviving in the Indian
Cohort.
To understand the difference between cohorts, we compared the feature
density histograms of Indian and Wuhan cohorts (Figure 4). It was observed
that survival of patients with LDH in the range 500-1000 is much higher in Delhi
compared to Wuhan. It can also be observed that there are almost no survivors
with an LDH value greater than 800 in the Wuhan cohort while patients with

LDH values of even about 1000 have survived in Delhi Cohort. The survivability
of patients with CRP greater than 50 is higher in the Indian cohort compared to
Wuhan. Similar conclusions can be drawn with Indian patients having relatively
lower lymphocyte (%) and higher neutrophil (%). This is interesting as the
likelihood of survival with higher neutrophil (%) or lower lymphocyte (%) is
much lower [27].
Figure 5 shows various matrices with two sample K-S statistics that measure
pairwise distances between distributions of important biomarkers of survivors
and the dead across Indian and Wuhan cohorts. It is observed that the distance
between distributions of the Indian Recovered (IR) and Indian Dead (ID) is
significantly lower compared to the distance between the distributions of the
Wuhan Recovered (WR) and Wuhan Dead (WD) for all the five biomarkers.
This is mainly due to the differences between distributions of recovered across
Delhi and Wuhan as the distance between the cohorts of the dead is low and the
distance between cohorts of the recovered is high. From this, it is evident that
many Indian patients who were at high risk of death according to the insights
from other cohorts have survived.
It is observed that the distance between WD and ID distributions is low,
especially in neutrophils (%), LDH and lymphocytes (%). The high survivability
of patients with extreme neutrophil and lymphocyte percentages is consistent
with the lower mortality rates observed in the Indian population compared to
several other countries. Identification of possible reasons for such a phenomenon
would enable minimization of mortality in other countries as well.

XGboost was used to rank features based on the contribution of each features
to the performance in risk stratification. Figure S3 shows the list of the top 25
features sorted in descending order with respect to their relative importance in
risk stratification. The 11 features that were selected to train the models in the
order of their importance are absolute neutrophil count, LDH, lymphocyte (%),
neutrophil(%), record of diabetes comorbidity, ferritin, INR, interleukin-6(IL-6),
oxygen saturation level, absolute eosinophil count and packed cell volume. Figure
S4 shows the density distributions for the top 4 features identified.
Comparison of the performance of various algorithms showed XGboost algorithm to perform the best with an F1-score of 0.810±0.01 as seen in Figure 6. The
model also yielded better AUC (0.833±0.01) and average precision (0.891±0.01)
(Table S5). The confusion matrix of predictions from an XGboost model trained
on the entire train set is shown in Figure S5. We also evaluated how the performance of model changes with days to outcome, where the day of outcome is
either the day of discharge from the hospital or the day of death. Figure 7 shows
that the performance of the risk stratification model decreases as the samples
approach the day of outcome. This suggests that the feature difference between
low risk and some high-risk patients who are recovering is decreasing towards
the day of outcome. However the performance of the mortality prediction model
increases towards the day of outcome. Hence, selective use of these two models
depending on the number of days from infection may be effective.

Further, we trained and evaluated models with only patient vitals, comorbidities, and medication information to evaluate the predictive performance
that can be achieved without lab test results. Figure S6 shows the F1 scores
of various models that were built to use only these patient information. The
random forests algorithm performed the best with an F1 score of 0.76±0.02. The
important features selected were administration of steroids, oxygen saturation
levels, record of diabetes, thyroid problems, presence of any other comorbidities,
weight, temperature, respiration rate, hypertension, and BMI.

As a part of the study, we also compared the differences in neutrophil and
lymphocyte percentages across patients who were administered steroids and
patients who were not to understand if the treatment protocols followed in India
medical systems has an effect on the lower mortality rates. Of the 544 patients
involved in the study 338 (62.13%) patients were administered steroids. It was
observed that Methylprednisolone was the most widely administered steroid
that was given to 262 different patients, followed by Dexamethasone given to 89
patients. Prednisolone was administered to 11 patients while Hydrocortisone and
Triamcinolone were given to only one patient. It is to be noted that there were
instances where a single patient was administered with more than one of these.
Figure 8 shows the density histograms of neutrophil and lymphocyte percentages
for survivors and mild patients. It is observed that a higher proportion of
the survivors and mild patients who were administered steroids had extreme
neutrophil and lymphocyte percentages indicating that administration of steroids
may have had an impact in patient outcome.

Discussion

359

COVID-19 has spread around the globe and the need for fast and effective resource
allocation is urgent, but very few studies have examined Indian cohorts. Studies
show the effect of regional factors such as patient characteristics and method of
treatment on their response to the infection. Hence, it is critical to analyse Indian
patients to aid the healthcare systems of the second highest COVID-19 hit nation
in the world. In this study, we analysed 15648 samples of 544 patients, with
confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, at MAX group of hospitals in New Delhi, India.
Each sample contains 70 unique parameters including the grouped comorbid
conditions, patient vitals, patient demographic information, and lab test results.
We found that existing mortality prediction models trained on Wuhan cohort
cannot be directly used for mortality prediction on the Indian cohort due to
cohort specific differences in response to COVID-19. We observed greater overlap
between dead and survivors’ parameter/biomarker distributions in the Indian
cohort than in Wuhan. It was observed that KS distance between distributions
of WR and IR for neutrophil and lymphocyte percentages is comparatively high
while the distance between the distributions of the dead (WD, ID) across the
cohorts was low. This shows that the increased overlap in the distributions in
the Indian cohort is primarily due to survivors. Patients in India recovered even
when their neutrophil and lymphocyte percentages reached levels similar to the
levels of patients who died in Wuhan. While the observed differences could be
due to better healthcare or a less severe immune response, a probable reason
for the low mortality in the Delhi cohort may be the inclusion of steroids and
immunosuppressant drugs in the treatment protocols by the Government of India
early on in the timeline of the pandemic. Studies have shown that use of steroids
like Dexamethasone lowered COVID-19 fatalities significantly when administered
to patients who require supplemental oxygen [28–31]. We observed a relation
between the usage of these drugs and the survival of patients with extreme
lymphocytes and neutrophils counts, which are associated with mortality(Figure
8) [14, 15, 24, 32, 33].
Machine learning models for risk stratification and mortality prediction were
developed based on features extracted from Indian cohort. The important
features for risk stratification included blood parameters, diabetes comorbid
condition and oxygen saturation level. On the other hand, mortality prediction
is dependent only on blood parameters. Blood coagulation parameters (ferritin,
D-Dimer and INR), immune and inflammation parameters (IL6, LDH and
Neutrophil(%)) are common features for both risk and mortality prediction.
Features for mortality prediction also included NLR, WBC and Trop I. Some
of these features have been identified as predictors of the progression of the
COVID-19 disease [12, 14, 15, 24, 33–39].
The best performing model for risk stratification on the Indian dataset was
the XGboost classifier, which acheived an F1-score of 0.81±0.01 while Logistic
regression yielded the best performance for mortality prediction with an F1-score
of 0.71±0.02. We also examined the performance of these algorithms when
trained on a dataset comprising of only vitals and clinical attributes, as these are

features that can be acquired quickly and may aid in the initial decision-making
process. The best performing models gave an F1 score of 0.76±0.02 for risk
stratification and 0.34±0.3 for mortality prediction. The low performance of these
models shows the importance of blood parameters in describing the progression
of COVID-19.
We observed that the progression of COVID-19 infection is accompanied
by hemocytometric changes with respect to the numbers of days to outcome
(Figures 9,10). The final day of outcome was considered as it is a more stable
reference point compared to the day of admission as a patient may be identified
and admitted late in the progression of the disease. The patients who died
showed elevated levels of D-Dimer, Ferritin and NLR, while lymphocyte (%)
levels dropped. The separation of the biomarkers’ values between the two classes
is observed to be consistent through the course of the disease. This shows their
significance in making predictions. Interestingly, the mortality prediction model
performed better when nearing the day of outcome whereas the performance
of the risk stratification model decreased as we move towards the day of the
outcome. The differences between the survivors and the dead increase as the
time progresses as survivors recover from the conditions whereas patients who
die do not, making it easier for any predictive model to classify. The performance
of risk stratification decreases as we move towards the day outcome because
as patients recover the differences between low risk and high-risk candidates
converge, making it more difficult for the model to classify. The proposed models
are based on the data collected from the Delhi region in India. This may introduce
regional biases and therefore, needed to be tested across multi-center. Our study
provides a preliminary assessment of the clinical course and outcome of Delhi
patients. We intend to test these models in the future on larger data collected
from multi-hospitals located in different geographic locations in India. As more
data becomes available, the whole procedure can easily be repeated to obtain
better models and more insights. Although we had a pool of about 70 clinical
measurements, here our modelling principle is a trade-off between the minimal
number of features and the capacity for good prediction, therefore avoiding
overfitting. Nevertheless, studies done on other cohorts have also identified these
features as key predictors [33].
The major strength of our study is the inclusion of a relatively large group
of confirmed COVID-19 cases from India. The findings from this study will
not only help in clinical decision-making in Indian healthcare setting but will
also help healthcare systems worldwide with understanding of progression of
severity and the role of steroids in patient survival. This study enables to move
in the direction of building accurate risk and mortality prediction models and in
identifying significant trends in clinical course and in exploring the impact of
individual steroids on COVID-19 patients.

and hence in optimal use of the healthcare infrastructure. It is likely that cohortspecific difference may emerge due to the difference in demographic conditions
and healthcare setting. This necessitates the development of population specific
solutions. There is also a need to study the effectiveness of certain treatment
protocols affecting mortality. Our study presents the first data collection effort
to develop predictive models and to study feature differences and the effect of
steroids in the Indian population. Risk stratification and mortality prediction
models yielded good performance and F1-scores of 0.81 and 0.71 respectively.
Haematological parameters are important features for risk stratification and
mortality prediction models. The analysis showed that steroids might have
played a role in patient survival with extreme neutrophils or lymphocytes. This
may indicate the effectiveness of the use of steroids in managing COVID19, and
possibly explain the effectiveness of the treatment protocols being followed by the
Indian medical systems. This study would help accelerate the decision-making
process in healthcare systems for focused and efficient medical treatments.
