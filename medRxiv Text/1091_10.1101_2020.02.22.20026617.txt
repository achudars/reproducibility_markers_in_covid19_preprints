Abstract

48

A respiratory illness has been spreading rapidly in China, since its outbreak in

49

Wuhan city, Hubei province in December 2019. The illness was caused by a novel

50

coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

51

Clinical manifestations related to SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from no symptom to

52

fatal pneumonia. World Health Organization (WHO) named the diseases associated

53

with SARS-CoV-2 infection as COVID-19. Real time RT-PCR is the only laboratory

54

test available till now to confirm the infection. However, the accuracy of real time

55

RT-PCR depends on many factors, including sampling location and of methods,

56

quality of RNA extraction and training of operators etc.. Variations in these factors

57

might significantly lower the sensitivity of the detection. We developed a

58

peptide-based luminescent immunoassay to detect IgG and IgM. Cut-off value of this

59

assay was determined by the detection of 200 healthy sera and 167 sera from patients

60

infected with other pathogens than SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the performance of this

61

assay, we detected IgG and IgM in the 276 sera from confirmed patients. The positive

62

rate of IgG and IgM were 71.4% (197/276) and 57.2% (158/276) respectively. By

63

combining with real time RT-PCR detection, this assay might help to enhance the

64

accuracy of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction

68
69

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, labeled as severe acute respiratory

70

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) the Coronavirus Study Group [1], has been

71

identified as the causative agent of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2]

72

outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province of China [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. This disease spread

73

rapidly by human-to-human transmission [4] from Wuhan to other regions [8],

74

resulting in more than 44,000 COVID-19 cases in mainland China based on the

75

statistical data until Feb 12, 2020 [9]. Additionally, a total of 78 cases were identified

76

in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and more than 400 cases were identified in

77

Thailand, Japan, South Korea, United States, Vietnam, Singapore, Nepal, France,

78

Australian and Canada [9]. So far, the number of infected people is still growing

79

significantly.

80

Given that effective anti-viral therapeutics are unavailable currently, the first line

81

of defense is to identify infected-patients as early as possible. Currently, laboratory

82

diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 has been carried out by detecting viral RNA in throat swab

83

samples based on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay

84

(real-time RT-PCR assay). This real-time RT-PCR method is sensitive and does not

85

require live virus present in the specimen. Despite these advantages, such method can

86

give results that are falsely-negative or falsely-positive due to several limitations, such

87

as quality of specimen collection, multi-steps of RNA preparation and virus mutation.

88

Another most widely used method is a serological test for the presence of antibodies

against viral proteins. Like sever acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and

90

Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 are enveloped

91

positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses [5, 10]. Genomic analysis of

92

SARS-CoV-2 reveals four major structural proteins including Spike (S) protein,

93

Nucleocapsid (N) protein, Envelope (E) protein, and Membrane (M) protein, as well

94

as a number of accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins [5, 10]. In this study, we

95

developed a magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (MCLIA) which has

96

good specificity for immunological reaction and high sensitivity for detecting serum

97

immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM against SARS-CoV-2.

Human sera

100

A total of 276 sera were collected from 276 inpatients from three designated

101

hospitals, Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Yongchuan Hospital Affiliated

102

to Chongqing Medical University (CQMU), and The Public Health Center, in

103

Chongqing, China. These patients were confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCov by

104

real time RT-PCR detection of virus RNA. Among these sera samples, 168 were

105

taken from patients with fever symptom. The time points of sampling range from day

106

2 to day 27 from the onset of fever. Ninety-nine of these patients reported exposure to

107

persons with confirmed infection latter. The 200 normal human sera were collected

108

from healthy people more than 1 year before 2019-nCov outbreak. 167 sera from

109

patients with infection with other pathogens were collected from the Second Hospital

110

Affiliated to CQMU and Children’s Hospital Affiliated to CQMU. These pathogens

Synthetic peptide-based luminescent immunoassay.

122

We developed a luminescent immunoassay for the detection of 2019-nCov

123

antibody using synthetic peptide antigens as the immunosorbent. Twenty peptides,

124

deduced from the genomic sequence from GenBank (NC_045512.1), were

125

synthesized as candidate antigens from the orf1a/b, spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N)

126

proteins. Each kind of peptide was labelled with biotin and the biotinylated peptide

127

was purified and used to bind to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. For antibody

128

assay, serum samples (100μl/each sample) were mixed with the beads carrying

129

corresponding peptides for 10 min at 37°C. Beads were washed 5 times, reacted to the

130

antibody conjugate, again washed 5 times, and reacted to substrate. Reactivity was

131

determined by a luminescence reader (Peteck 96-I, Bioscience, China).

133

Cut-off value of the test was determined as the mean luminescence value of the

134

200 normal sera plus 5 folds of SD. Sera from 276 COVID-19 patients 167 patients

135

with irrelevant pathogens were used to evaluate the performance of the assay. The

136

luminescent immunoassay was performed as described above. Results were

Evaluation of Synthetic peptide-based MCLIA for SARS-CoV-2

141

Twenty synthetic peptides, derived from the amino acid sequence of ORF1a/b,

142

Spike (S) protein and Nucleocapsid (N) protein, were used to develop MCLIA for

143

detecting IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. To screen these peptides, 5

144

sera from confirmed patients and 10 normal sera were used to react with these

145

peptides respectively. Among these peptides tested, one from S protein showed the

146

best performance. We used the assay based on this peptide for the following study. To

147

determine the cut-off value of this assay, serum samples from 200 healthy blood

148

donors who donated blood 1-2 years ago were first tested. The mean

149

chemiluminescence (CL) values for IgG and IgM were 0.152±0.109 and 0.151±0.107,

150

respectively (Fig.1). Cut-off value for IgG and IgM detection were determined as 0.7

151

and 0.7 respectively.

To test the specificity of the assays, the serum samples from 167 people infected

155

Streptococcus pneumonia, Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Candida

156

albicans, Staphylococcus aureus were tested. The mean chemiluminescence (CL)

157

values for IgG and IgM in non-SARS-CoV-2 infected people were 0.121 ± 0.062 and

158

0.120 ± 0.065, respectively (Fig.1A-B). These results showed that no cross-reactivity

159

was observed for these 20 pathogens, indicating a very good specificity.

160

To test stability of this MCLIA based serological diagnosis method, serum

161

samples with different concentrations were measured 10 times (Fig 2. A, B, C, D),

162

coefficient of variation (CV) of IgG and IgM detection in different concentration

163

samples were all below 6% (Fig 2. E, F), which meant a perfect stability of this assay

164

in IgG/IgM detection. Furthermore, series dilutions for 6 serum samples(3 for IgG, 3

165

for IgM) were performed and S/co values were collected, regression analysis revealed

166

S/co value range from 1 to 200 linear reflected serum antibody concentration (IgG,

167

R2= -0.902, P<0.001, Fig 3A; IgM, R2= -0.946, P<0.001, Fig 3B), assured the

168

rationality in further quantitative comparison based on S/co values.

169

Serological Diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with confirmed infection

170

IgG and IgM were further examined by MCLIA in serum from 276 patients with

171

confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The median age of these patients was 48 years

172

(IQR, 37-56; range, 0.66-84years), and 151/276 (54.71%) were men. The mean (CL)

173

values for IgG were 18.62± 32.87, ranging from 0.05-194.56; IgM were 5.50±22.60,

174

ranging from 0.04-318.16. Majority (197/276; 71.4%) of patients were positive for

175

IgG antibody against the SARS-CoV-2, while 57.2% (158/276) patient were positive

176

for IgM antibody against the SARS-CoV-2. Overall, 225 patients showed positive for

177

IgM or IgG test and the total positive rate reached 81.52% (225/276) (Table1).

178
179

Discussion

180

We developed a luminescent immunoassay for IgG and IgM against

181

SARS-CoV-2, which, to our knowledge, was the first such assay allowed us to study

182

the antibody response to the newly identified coronavirus. This assay was based on a

183

peptide from S protein, screened out from 20 candidate peptides deduced from the

184

genomic sequence. Using synthetic peptide as antigen helps to enhance the stability

185

and repeatability of an assay, and theoretically would be more specific than using

186

virus as antigen. Indeed, this peptide showed a very good specificity in our assay:

187

none of the 167 sera from patients infected with other pathogens than SARS-CoV-2

188

reacted with this peptide. This high specificity may be attributed to the relatively low

189

homology of this region to other coronaviruses (data not shown).

190

Real time RT-PCR was the only test to confirm the infection of SARS-CoV-2 till

191

now. We detected both IgM and IgG in the same sera from the 276

192

infection-confirmed patients. IgG was detected in 71.4% (197/276) of all the sera,

193

higher than the detection rate of IgM (57.2%, 158/276). A combination the two

194

antibodies enhanced the detection rate to 81.5% (225/276). Different sensitivity of the

195

detection of IgG and IgM had been reported in SARS [11]. IgG can be detected as

196

early as 2 days after the onset of fever. IgM was not detected earlier than IgG, similar

197

to the situation in MERS [12], which limits its diagnostic utility. It was reported that

198

20%-50% SARS patients cannot be confirmed by RT-PCR [13], and this elicited a

199

speculation that there might be a comparable part of infection cannot be detected by

200

real time RT-PCR. Failure of detection by real time RT-PCR can be caused by the

201

problems from sampling, RNA extraction and PCR amplification, while detecting

202

antibodies in serum sample avoid a large part of these problems.
