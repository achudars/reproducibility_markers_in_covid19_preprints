Abstract
Introduction: Outbreaks of infectious diseases trigger an increase in scientific research and output.
Early in outbreaks, evidence is scarce, but it accumulates rapidly. We are continuously facing new
disease outbreaks, including the new coronavirus (SARS-nCoV-2) in December 2019.The objective of this
study was to describe the accumulation of evidence during the 2013-2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in
the Pacific and the Americas related to aetiological causal questions about congenital abnormalities and
Guillain-Barré syndrome.
Methods: We hypothesised that the temporal sequence would follow a pre-specified order, according
to study design. We assessed 1) how long it takes before findings from a specific study design appear, 2)
how publication of preprints could reduce the time to publication and 3) how time to publication evolves
over time.
Results: We included 346 publications published between March 6, 2014 and January 1, 2019. In
the 2013-–2016 ZIKV outbreak, case reports, case series and basic research studies were published first.
Case-control and cohort studies appeared between 400–700 days after ZIKV was first detected in the
region of the study origin. Delay due to the publication process were lowest at the beginning of the
outbreak. Only 4.6% of the publications was available as preprints.
Discussion: The accumulation of evidence over time in new causal problems generally followed a
hierarchy. Preprints reduced the delay to initial publication. Our methods can be applied to new
emerging infectious diseases.

Introduction

1

Outbreaks of infectious diseases trigger an increase in scientific research and output. Early in
outbreaks, evidence is scarce, however, it accumulates rapidly as time progresses. As we are continuously
facing new disease outbreaks, as we do at the moment with the emergence of the new coronavirus
(SARS-nCoV-2), understanding the accumulation of evidence is vital. Here, we describe the
accumulation of evidence during the Zika virus outbreak and summarize the lessons learnt.
Causality is a principal theme in epidemiological research. Establishing that an exposure causes a
specific health outcome is based on evidence and may inform guidance about public health measures.
The concepts and types of evidence required to conclude that an association is causal are the subject of
ongoing debate. Vandenbroucke proposed a hierarchy of evidence based on the best chance for discovery
and explanation of phenomena [1]. Observations published in case reports and case series, or findings in
data and literature drive discovery. Verification of these discoveries happens in observational studies and
in randomized controlled trials, given that exposures can be randomized. The value of evidence used for
public health guidance is thought to follow an inverse pattern of the hierarchy for discovery; here, case

reports and other anecdotal evidence is considered to be evidence that provides the least certainty on an
effect or association. Cohort studies, randomized controlled trials and case-control studies are considered
to provide evidence with a higher certainty (Figure 1).
The Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in the Pacific and the Americas between 2013-–2016 presented
several aetiological causal questions. In 2013—2014, ZIKV caused an outbreak in French Polynesia [2, 3].
During this period, investigators documented some severe neurological conditions, including 40 people
with Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). GBS is usually a rare sporadic condition. Often triggered by
infection, an autoimmune response affects the peripheral nerves, leading ascending paralysis, which can
be fatal if it involves the respiratory nerves [4]. At the time, the reports did not attract much attention
and the investigators refrained from making a causal connection because dengue was also circulating at
the time [3]. In November 2015, the ministry of health in Brazil reported a cluster of births affected by
microcephaly in the north east. Microcephaly is a birth defect, indicative of impaired brain development,
which can be caused by congenital infection. At around the same time, ZIKV had been identified for the
first time in Brazil [5]. In December 2015, the Pan American Health Organization announced heightened
surveillance owing to an “increase of congenital anomalies, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other
neurological and autoimmune syndromes in areas where Zika virus is circulating” [6]. The World Health
Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 1
February 2016 because of the severity of these clinical conditions and their temporal association with
ZIKV circulation [7]. Retrospective assessment of the French Polynesia outbreak identified an increase in
adverse congenital outcomes as well [8]. The PHEIC and the extensive outbreak catalysed the research
on ZIKV. Early public health guidance about the prevention of ZIKV infection and its potential
consequences was based on limited evidence, however [9].
Systematic reviews were developed to address the PHEIC recommendation for research about the
causal relationships between ZIKV infection and adverse congenital outcomes, including microcephaly
and between ZIKV and autoimmune outcomes, including GBS [10]. The reviews organized the findings
around a ‘causality framework’ with ten dimensions derived from those proposed by Bradford
Hill [10, 11]. An expert committee reviewed the evidence collected by these systematic reviews up to May
2016 and reached the conclusion that “the most likely explanation of the available evidence” was that
ZIKV is a cause of adverse congenital outcomes and a trigger of GBS [12]. This review has been kept up
to date as a living systematic review, by periodically incorporating new results [13, 14]. The additional
evidence has reinforced the conclusions of causality.
A temporal sequence for the emergence of evidence was already hypothesised during the planning of
the systematic reviews in early 2016 (Figure 1). Acknowledging that ‘astute observations’ of new causes
of disease often start an aetiological investigation [15], case reports and case series were eligible for
inclusion in the systematic reviews. These study designs are often excluded from systematic reviews
because they are the lowest level of the “hierarchy of evidence” that applies to evaluation research.
Vandenbroucke proposed a reverse hierarchy for discovery in which ‘anecdotal’ forms of evidence are at
the top [1]. Cross-sectional, case-control and retrospective follow-up studies follow because they are
quickest study designs that include a control group. Prospective cohort studies take longer to set up and
RCTs only provide additional information if a treatment or vaccine is available. In addition to
epidemiological studies, basic and clinical laboratory science start early in the search for causes.

Included studies/Review methods

We analysed records of studies that were included in published systematic reviews [10] and two
updates [13, 14] of the relationships between ZIKV and congenital abnormalities and GBS. The methods
of the original review and updates are described elsewhere [10, 13]. The included studies reported
evidence about any of the questions of the causality framework, based on the Bradford Hill dimensions of
causality. Until January 18, 2017, we included epidemiological and basic research study designs; after
that date we continued the review of evidence from epidemiological study designs only (Figure 2). Here
we analyse studies collected until January 1, 2019.

We included 346 publications published between March 6, 2014 and January 1, 2019 (Table 2 and
Figure 4). Up to January 18, 2017, we included 171 publications. Most publications were epidemiological
study design (94/171), 77 out of 171 studies were basic research studies (either research on animal
models or in vitro laboratory-based research). Between January 18, 2017 and January 1, 2019, we
restricted our search to publications of epidemiological study design, and included another 175
publications. For 220/269 epidemiological studies, a date of ZIKV introduction was known. The time
between received and published was reported in 204 out of 346 studies. In 16/204 of these studies there
was no publication delay, usually because the first publication date was as a preprint.

Figure 5A shows the comparison of publications published between the PHEIC and the end of the
second review period (January 18, 2017). We saw the first case reports and case series published after 44
and 77 days, respectively. Basic research emerged rapidly after the PHEIC. In this period, a limited
number of case-control studies was available. The earliest publication of a case-control study for GBS,
was a result of a retrospective study looking back at the French Polynesia outbreak [8]. The median total
time to publication was longer for more robust study designs (cohort studies, case-control studies). We
see a similar pattern for epidemiological studies if we consider the data up to January 1, 2019 and
consider the time to publication between the regional introduction of ZIKV and the publication date
(Figure 5B).

Four out of seven basic research studies published in the first quarter of 2016 appeared as preprints
(on www.bioRxiv.com) and had a median publication delay of zero days (Figure 6). The median
publication delay increased with time to 107 days (IQR: 66–107 days) by the fourth quarter of 2016.
During the same period for epidemiological study designs, the median publication delay increased from
19 days (IQR: 14–22) in the first quarter of 2016 to above 97 days (IQR: 63–138) from the fourth quarter
of 2016. In the last quarter of 2018, the publication delay rose to 264 days (IQR: 144–392). On average,
the publication delay accounted for 20% (IQR: 11–33%) of the total time from the PHEIC to first
publication.

In the 2013–2016 ZIKV outbreak, case reports and case series are the first study designs to emerge.
Basic research studies appeared rapidly after this. Publication of more robust epidemiological study
designs, such as case-control and cohort studies, appeared between 400–700 days after ZIKV was first
detected in the region of the study origin. The delay due to the publication process of basic research and
epidemiological research was lower at the beginning of the outbreak. A year after the declaration of the

Strengths and weaknesses of the study

136
137

138

A strength of this study is the pre-specified hypothesis about the time to publication of aetiological
research and the use of data from systematic reviews that had screened and selected studies that
addressed the causal relationship between ZIKV infection and its adverse outcomes. We calculated
additional measures related to the time to publication of research, including delays due to the
publication, and thus the time that could have been gained by publishing preprints.
The limited information extracted about each study was a limitation. The time between introduction
of ZIKV and the actual publication of a research study is dependent on factors both within and between
study designs. There is substantial variation in the time to publication within the study designs. We did
not quantify several factors that likely influence this duration such as the size of the outbreak, the
research capacity or outbreak preparedness. Small outbreaks or small population sizes limit the
opportunity to enrol sufficient patients with adverse outcomes, and unless involved in
multi-centre/multi-region studies, these regions are less likely to produce high quality epidemiological
studies. The same holds true for regions with limited research capacity, such as appropriate diagnostic
facilities and expertise. Outbreak preparedness likely increased over time, with funding increasing after
the PHEIC, meaning that initiation of studies started relatively late for regions that were affected
earliest by the outbreak. Countries that were affected later in time by ZIKV, might have already had
surveillance and diagnostic methodology in place.
The publication delay is a proxy measure, which could not be calculated for all studies; for only 59%

(204/346) studies the “received date” was provided. It is unclear whether these data are missing at
random. Furthermore, the recorded publication delay could only be calculated for the journal in which a
study was published. The true publication delay includes the time taken up by rejection and
resubmission. The publication date also ignores dissemination of the findings at conferences or within
collaborations. However, here the information is only available to a limited audience. The timing of
ZIKV introduction is also a proxy measure, which does not capture the first actual case, but signals the
moment at which the health authorities and the research community noted the introduction in that
region and thus serves its purpose as a proxy for when research start intensifying. Phylogenetic data
suggest that ZIKV was often introduced months before formal detection and notification [18].

The sequence of emergence of evidence about causality was not exactly as hypothesised (Figure 1).
While case reports and case series were the first types of study to be published, findings from animal
research were also published quickly. This finding might have been influenced by the more frequent use
of preprints to disseminate laboratory research than clinical science [19]. In our study, the time taken to
publication of case-control studies and cohort studies was similar, particularly for studies of congenital
outcomes. Case-control studies are widely assumed to be quicker to organise and conduct than cohort
studies [1, 15]. In the ZIKV outbreak, one case-control study about GBS was published soon after the
PHEIC declaration because it used data already collected from the earlier ZIKV outbreak in French
Polynesia. An important consideration is the short duration of pregnancy. The cohorts that were fastest
to produce results, were cohorts that were already in place for other disease (Dengue, influenza) [20].
Follow up of the outcomes of a disease exposure in pregnancy takes a matter of months. It might
therefore not be possible to extrapolate this finding to other conditions in which the outcome takes years
to develop.
The rapid, and sustained, publication of a large body of research about ZIKV is a rich resource for
meta-research about causality. The declaration of the Ministry of Health of Brazil in November 2015 [5]
and the declaration of the PHEIC by WHO in February 2016 [7] catalysed the ZIKV research effort
across many different disciplines and resulted in an increase in research funding and a WHO-initiated
research agenda [21]. Some of the observed patterns in study design and time publication are influenced
by the type of outcome. Investigation of GBS, which is very rare, estimated at 4/10.000 ZIKV
infections [22], is likely to be restricted to case-control as cohort studies would take too long to enrol
enough participants.
We provide empirical evidence about publication delays during an outbreak of an emerging infection.
WHO and others have encouraged rapid dissemination and timely open access to data to help the
response during public health emergencies [23]. The ZIKV outbreak and 2013–2016 Ebola virus outbreak
in West Africa, emphasised the need for rapid sharing of data. However, the publication delay returned
to an average observed in across disciplines within a year after the declaration of the PHEIC; the age of
the average preprint before it is published by a journal across different scientific disciplines is 166
days [24]. In medical research, publication of preprints is still underused [19] but the launch of the
MedRXiv preprint server (www.medRxiv.org) in June 2019 might signal a change.

Looking back at the ZIKV outbreak and how evidence accumulated on the adverse outcomes will
provide guidance for a next outbreak. It provides insight in how evidence accumulates in new causal
questions. Specifically for disease outbreaks, we can increase preparedness by the lessons learnt from the
Zika virus outbreak. Especially, since disease outbreaks or disease re-emergence continue to happen due
to extraneous pressure such as shifts in climate, population growth and increased movement of people
either due to displacement or voluntary movement [25].
In a disease outbreak with adverse outcomes that are new or incompletely understood, the full
spectrum of evidence needs to be assessed to establish causality. Early in an outbreak, we need anecdotal
evidence to drive discovery and explanation [1]. Studies across the different scientific disciplines are

informative while we wait for robust epidemiological studies. Here, different frameworks can help us
assess the evidence such as Bradford Hill dimensions [11]. We rely on a wide spectrum of evidence in line
with how Krieger et al. phrase it: “Robust causal inference instead comprises a complex narrative,
created by scientists appraising, from diverse perspectives, different strands of evidence produced by
myriad methods.” [26]. Rapid consensus on causality is often needed to form public health guidance.
Not all outbreaks generate the same emerging causal questions, thus deconstructing other causal
problems based on study design and timing of evidence will provide more insight in how evidence
accumulates. The ZIKV outbreak in the Americas was unique by its size; making rare
non-pathognomonic outcomes visible. Also, the 2015–2017 outbreak in the Americas benefited from the
outbreak in 2013 in French Polynesia. Much data was collected there, and retrospective analyses
confirmed the association between ZIKV infection and adverse outcomes [8]. This resulted in the
publication of a case-control study on GBS, rapidly after the declaration of the PHEIC [8]. Likewise,
Cauchemez et al. used a modelling approach to estimate the risk of adverse congenital outcomes in
French Polynesia retrospectively [27].

As the SARS-nCoV-2 outbreak continues to unfold, we will apply the same methodology as discussed
here to keep track of the accumulation of evidence, the delay in publication and the use of pre-print
publishing.

Conclusion

221
222
223

224

The accumulation of evidence over time in new causal problems seems to follow a hierarchy where
case reports and case series were rapidly followed by basic research. During the ZIKV outbreak, robust
epidemiological studies, such as case-control studies and cohort studies, took 400–700 days to appear.
Causal inference based on a wide spectrum of evidence is therefore essential for early public health
guidance in emerging causal problems. Publishing preprint does reduce the delay, and especially in
epidemiological research this is an underused tool.
