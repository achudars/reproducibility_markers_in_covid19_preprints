ABSTRACT
Lasting immunity will be critical for overcoming the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, factors that drive the development of
high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and how long those antibodies persist remain unclear. Our objective
was to comprehensively evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a clinically diverse COVID-19 convalescent
cohort at defined time points to determine if anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persist and to identify clinical and
demographic factors that correlate with high titers. Using a novel multiplex assay to quantify IgG against four
SARS-CoV-2 antigens, a receptor binding domain-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 inhibition assay, and a
SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay, we found that 98% of COVID-19 convalescent subjects had anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies five weeks after symptom resolution (n=113). Further, antibody levels did not decline three months
after symptom resolution (n=79). As expected, greater disease severity, older age, male sex, obesity, and higher
Charlson Comorbidity Index score correlated with increased anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. We demonstrated
for the first time that COVID-19 symptoms, namely fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea and low appetite, correlated
consistently with higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Our results provide new insights into the development
and persistence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

INTRODUCTION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was isolated in January 2020 after an outbreak
of 44 cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, China (1). SARS-CoV-2 causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), which ranges from no symptoms to a flu-like illness to severe respiratory distress syndrome and death (2).
As of December 2020, there have been over 78 million cases worldwide and over 1.7 million deaths (3), with
devastating effects on health, economies, and societies (4).

Lasting immunity, often estimated by persistent antibodies, will be critical for overcoming the COVID-19
pandemic, but our understanding of the development of persistent anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is still emerging.
In severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by the related SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV),
anti-viral antibodies persist in the majority of patients for at least 3 years after disease (5-7). Less is known about
SARS-CoV-2, but a few reports suggest that immunity may last at least 6 months (8-10). However, other reports
(11-14) suggest that antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can decline in the first few months (15), with some patients
becoming seronegative (16, 17). This variation in findings may be due to differences in antibody detection
methods, small sample sizes, use of different time points for different subjects, and varying levels of disease
severity. For example, disease severity is a known correlate of antibody levels and persistence (15, 18, 19), and
different studies include different proportions of mild or severe disease or do not report disease severity levels.
Also, different methods are used to detect antibody titers, and neutralizing titers tend to be low more often than
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels (20, 21). Of course, small sample size is a well-known cause of variable data.
In addition to mixed findings regarding antibody persistence, many studies do not evaluate clinical correlates of
antibody titers and none have evaluated COVID-19 symptoms as potential correlates. Thus, a standardized
approach to evaluating anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with uniform time points, multiple antibody tests, and
incorporation of clinical and demographic data, including COVID-19 symptoms, would shed light on the
development of antibody-based immunity in COVID-19.

To this end, we broadly evaluated the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 in a clinically diverse COVID-19
convalescent population at five weeks and three months after symptom resolution using three different types of
assays: a novel multiplex assay that evaluates IgG levels against four SARS-CoV-2, one SARS-CoV, and four
circulating coronavirus antigens, a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD)-angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE)2 binding inhibition assay, and a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. We then correlated
antibody titers with a variety of clinical and demographic factors including COVID-19 symptoms. Similar to
previous studies, we found that disease severity, older age, and male sex correlate with higher anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibody titers. We also identify fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea and low appetite as symptoms that correlate with
higher antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate persistence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies three
months after symptom resolution.

RESULTS
We recruited 120 COVID-19 convalescent subjects into the University of Wisconsin (UW) COVID-19
Convalescent Biorepository. Seven subjects were excluded from this study due to erroneous blood collection
timing (n=1), receipt of convalescent plasma (n=3), or partial consent (n=3). Two additional subjects were
excluded from longitudinal evaluation due to a blood draw >14 days from the 3 month time point. Of the included
subjects, blood was collected from 113 at 5 weeks (range 29-48 days, median 36 days, IQR 35-39 days) and from
79 at 3 months (range 85-102 days, median 91 days, IQR 90-93 days) post-symptom resolution. Eighty-one
percent of COVID-19 convalescent subjects had a primary care appointment within two years of the first blood
draw and/or a hospital admission note that included past medical history and medications. Subjects ranged in age
from 19-83 years and had a variety of COVID-19 manifestations (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1). As
expected (18, 22), hospitalized subjects were more likely to be older and male with more comorbidities such as
vascular disease, but were less likely to have asthma (Table 1). Additionally, hospitalized subjects were more
likely to have fever and were less likely to have chest tightness, sore throat, or headache than non-hospitalized
patients. There was no detectable correlation between race, ethnicity, area of deprivation index (ADI), body mass
index (BMI), cancer, immunosuppressing medications, or other COVID-19 symptoms and hospitalization,
potentially due to low sample size.

We used a multiplex approach to evaluate IgG levels against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, RBD of S, N
terminal domain (NTD) of S, and nucleocapsid (N), as well as the S protein of SARS-CoV and four seasonal
coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E) in subjects five weeks post-COVID-19
symptom resolution. As shown in Figure 1A, COVID-19 convalescent subjects have significantly higher IgG
levels against all 4 SARS-CoV-2 antigens compared to SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects. Further, 98% of COVID-19
convalescent subjects had higher binding in at least one test than any naive subject. Finally, IgG levels against S
from SARS-CoV and the seasonal betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, but not the seasonal
alphacoronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, were higher in COVID-19 convalescent subjects compared
to naive controls.

We then evaluated the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 in a more functional manner. Since the RBD of S
binds to ACE2, enabling viral entry (23), we quantified the ability of sera to inhibit RBD binding to ACE2.
Compared to SARS-CoV-2 naive sera, COVID-19 five week convalescent sera had a much greater ability to
inhibit ACE2 binding to RBD (Figure 1B). Further, in a neutralizing assay using live SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19
convalescent sera had higher neutralizing antibody (Nab) titers compared to SARS-CoV-2 naive sera, although
15% of COVID-19 convalescent subjects did not have Nab titers above naive controls (Figure 1C). Overall, Nab
titers correlated well with IgG levels against SARS-CoV-2 antigens, as well as with ACE2 binding inhibition
(Figure 1D).

Together these data suggest that the vast majority of COVID-19 patients have antibodies five weeks postsymptom resolution that are able to bind to SARS-CoV-2 proteins, inhibit RBD-ACE2 binding, and neutralize
SARS-CoV-2. Also, IgG titers, particularly against S and RBD, and RBD-ACE2 binding inhibition better
differentiate between COVID-19 convalescent and naive individuals than the neutralizing assay, but may
overestimate protective antibodies.

We then evaluated if antibody titers at five weeks post-symptom resolution varied with disease severity in our
cohort. As shown in Figure 2, hospitalized subjects had higher antibody levels than non-hospitalized subjects
according to all of our tests. Moreover, in general, antibody titers increased with COVID-19 severity (Figure 2).
We next evaluated if clinical and demographic factors apart from disease severity correlated with antibody titers.
Since multiple variables correlate with hospitalization (Table 1), a marker of severe disease, we analyzed nonhospitalized subjects only. As shown in Table 2, older age, male sex, higher BMI and a Charlson Comorbidity
Index score >2 correlated with higher antibody titers in non-hospitalized subjects for all or most tests. However,
race, ethnicity, ADI, active cancer, diabetes mellitus, vascular disease, asthma, immunosuppressive medications
and inhaled/intranasal steroids did not correlate with antibody titers in general (Supplementary Table 1). Also, in
non-hospitalized subjects, fever, low appetite, abdominal pain, and diarrhea correlated with higher antibody levels

measured by every test, whereas cough, body aches, headache, nausea, and vomiting only correlated with some
antibody tests and chills, shortness of breath, chest tightness, sore throat, loss of taste or smell, and runny or
stuffed nose correlated with no or almost no antibody tests (Table 3). Together, these data suggest that several
demographic and clinical factors, including COVID-19 symptoms, correlate with increased antibody titers against
SARS-CoV-2.

Finally, we evaluated the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in our COVID-19
convalescent subjects at three months post symptom resolution. We found that in our cohort as a whole, IgG
levels against SARS-CoV-2 S, NTD, RBD or N did not decline, nor did RBD-ACE2 binding inhibition or Nab
titers from five weeks to three months post-symptom resolution (Figure 3). Titers against SARS-CoV and seasonal
coronaviruses also did not fall (Supplementary Figure 2). However, when hospitalized and non-hospitalized
subjects were analyzed separately (Figure 3), IgG levels against S and N rose slightly in hospitalized subjects
(area under the curve: 4,525,184 +/- 796,452 versus 5,247,312 +/- 811,346 and 5,765,064 +/- 588,170 versus
7,004,295 +/- 654,857, respectively) and Nab titers decreased slightly in non-hospitalized subjects (titers: 49 +/11 versus 37 +/-10) over time. Together these data suggest that, in general, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
persist at least three months after symptom resolution, particularly in the most severely ill patients.

DISCUSSION
We have demonstrated that the vast majority of COVID-19 convalescent subjects generate antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2 that can inhibit ACE2 binding, neutralize live SARS-CoV-2, and persist at least three months postCOVID-19 symptom resolution. Further, we demonstrated that greater disease severity, older age, male sex,
higher BMI, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score, fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea and low appetite all
correlate with higher antibody titers using a variety of tests.

Although we detected IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in the majority of COVID-19 convalescent subjects, there was
some variability among tests (Figure 1). Using a multiplex assay, IgG levels against S and RBD, but not NTD or
N, showed an impressive difference in titers between COVID-19 convalescent and control sera. Similar strong
results were observed for the RBD-ACE2 binding inhibition assay. Thus, these three tests could be developed
into a diagnostic test with very high sensitivity and specificity. Of note, two COVID-19 convalescent subjects
had similar values to naive subjects in all three tests. It is unknown if these subjects had false positive SARSCoV-2 PCR tests, if they did not make antibodies, or if our tests were insufficiently sensitive to detect their
antibodies. Further studies are needed with more asymptomatic subjects and larger sample sizes to better evaluate
these tests.

All of the antibody tests correlated well with Nab titers (Figure 1), a gold standard for protective antibodies. This
correlation is encouraging, suggesting that our other antibody assays are measuring relevant antibodies without
the cost, hazards, time, and expertise needed for neutralizing assays. However, similar to related studies (20, 21),
more COVID-19 convalescent subjects had antibody titers no higher than naive controls using the neutralizing
assay as compared to other assays. It is unknown if these subjects truly lack protective antibodies or if the
neutralization assay is insufficiently sensitive. Future studies are needed to standardize neutralizing assays and to
determine truly protective levels of Nab titers.

In addition to the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent sera five weeks postsymptom resolution, we saw a small increase in antibodies that bind to the spike protein of seasonal
betacoronaviruses (OC43 and HKU1), but not seasonal alphacoronaviruses (NL63 and 229E) (Figure 1), perhaps
because SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus (23). Moreover, antibodies that bind to the spike protein of all of the
seasonal coronaviruses appeared to slightly rise from five weeks to three months post-symptom resolution
(Supplementary Figure 2). A similar “back boost” phenomenon has been reported for other viruses (24) and could
represent cross-reactivity of newly developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies or stimulation of memory B cells that
originally developed in response to circulating coronaviruses. In contrast, the higher titers against SARS-CoV S
seen in COVID-19 convalescent subjects (Figure 1), which did not change over time (Supplementary Figure 2),
are probably due to cross-reactive anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, since it is extremely unlikely that the Wisconsin
cohort was exposed to SARS-CoV. The clinical implications of these phenomena are unclear and warrant further
investigation.

Similar to recent reports (18, 19, 25-27), we demonstrated that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were highest in
patients with the highest disease severity (Figure 2). We also found that in non-hospitalized patients, higher
antibody levels correlated with older age, male sex, higher BMI, and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score
(Table 2). All of these factors correlated with severe disease in our cohort as measured by hospitalization (Table
1) except for BMI, which has been reported by others to be associated with severe disease (28). Thus, nonhospitalized subjects with these high-risk characteristics might have had relatively severe disease that our methods
could not measure, driving the higher antibody titers. Alternatively, these characteristics could contribute
specifically to increased antibody levels. However, both older age and obesity appear to impair antibody responses
(29), and there is no broadly generalizable increased antibody response in males (30). Of note, the correlation
between anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers with age, sex, and obesity has been previously reported (19, 31), but
we are the first to report a correlation with the Charlson Comorbidity Index score.

In addition to disease severity, we report for the first time that specific COVID-19 symptoms, namely fever, low
appetite, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, consistently correlate with higher antibody titers (Table 3). Other
symptoms did not correlate consistently or at all including shortness of breath, which a previous study of 68
COVID-19 convalescent subjects who donated plasma at various times post-infection found was associated with
higher antibody titers (20). Fever and low appetite are signs of a systemic inflammatory response, suggesting that
such an inflammatory response may be key for developing a strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response. The
link between diarrhea and abdominal pain and the antibody response is intriguing. SARS-CoV-2-induced diarrhea
may directly exacerbate inflammation and disease severity (32). Thus, diarrhea simply may be a marker of severe
disease, which is associated with higher antibody titers. However, we did not see increased diarrhea in our
hospitalized patients (Table 1). Another possibility is that diarrhea, which is typically caused by enteric viral
infection and damage (32), may directly enhance the antibody response, perhaps by activating inflammatory cells
throughout the gut. However, at this time, the mechanism by which diarrhea might enhance antibody titers is
unknown and requires further investigation.

Finally, we found that antibodies persist from five weeks until three months after symptom resolution (Figure 3).
Some antibody levels even continued to rise slightly during this time period, although Nab titers fell slightly in
non-hospitalized subjects. Our findings are discrepant from some studies, which reported falling IgG titers against
SARS-CoV-2 within a few months of symptom onset (11-17). However, these studies all had smaller sample
sizes, particularly at later time points, or the fall in titers was observed in subjects with mild or asymptomatic
disease. Very recently, a small drop in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers in 121 COVID-19 convalescent subjects
from ~30 to ~148 days post-symptom onset was reported (33). It is hard to compare our observations with theirs,
since clinical characteristics of their subjects were not described. However, our findings are consistent with
preliminary reports of persistent antibody titers at least 6 months after disease (8-10). Further studies are needed
at later time points, combined with clinical correlates and data about re-infection, in order to assess long-term
protective antibody-based immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

There are a few caveats to our studies. First, COVID-19 symptoms were self-reported up to a month after
symptom resolution, which could lead to recall error. Additionally, some of the medical records were incomplete
with no recent primary care or admission note in the charts of 19% of subjects and 14% missing BMI data. This
gap would be biased toward non-hospitalized patients. Also, our population was relatively homogeneous with
regard to race and ethnicity. However, our study is strong in that it includes a wide breadth of COVID-19 severity
in 113 subjects with consistent time points and multiple types of antibody tests.

In sum, we report that antibody-based immunity against SARS-CoV-2 lasts at least three months post-symptom
resolution and that antibody titers consistently correlate with specific COVID-19 symptoms (fever, low appetite,
abdominal pain, and diarrhea) and clinical and demographic features (older age, male sex, higher COVID-19
severity, higher BMI, and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score). Future work is needed to determine which
antibody titers are protective against re-infection and how long those titers last.

METHODS
Human Subjects
COVID-19 convalescent sera and data were obtained from the UW COVID-19 Convalescent Biorepository and
control sera collected prior to 2019 were obtained from the UW Rheumatology Biorepository (34), which includes
subjects with and without rheumatologic disease, and from the NIH clinical protocol VRC200. All subjects
provided informed consent. For the COVID-19 Convalescent Biorepository, all individuals 18+ years old who
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR at UW Health were invited to participate until 120 subjects were
recruited. Clinical and demographic data were collected by survey upon recruitment. Additional data and blood
were collected 5 weeks and 3 months +/- 10 days post-symptom resolution. Age, sex, address (to determine ADI
(35)), medications, lab values, height and weight (to calculate BMI), medical problems, and date of most recent
primary care appointment were abstracted from the UW Health electronic medical record (EMR). Race, ethnicity,
tobacco use, COVID-19 symptoms, and date of symptom resolution were self-reported by questionnaire.
Hospitalization and intubation status for COVID-19 were obtained by questionnaire and EMR abstraction.
COVID-19 severity was scored as critical (4, intubated), severe (3, hospitalized but not intubated), moderate (2,
fever defined as temperature >100°F, chills, productive cough, or shortness of breath, but not hospitalized), or
mild (1, none of the above). Charlson Comorbidity Index Scores were calculated (36). Subjects were excluded
from this study if they received convalescent plasma, if blood was collected more than 14 days from the intended
time point, or if they did not provide consent for all aspects of the study.

IgG binding to coronavirus antigens (multiplex assay)
Plates (96 well) printed with SARS-CoV-2 S protein, RBD of S, NTD of S, and N protein as well as S from
SARS-CoV, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E, in addition to bovine serum albumin
(BSA) were supplied by Meso Scale Discovery (MSD, Rockville, USA). Plates were blocked for 60 minutes with
MSD Blocker A (5% BSA) followed by washing. Then, sera were applied to the wells at 4 dilutions (1:100, 1:800,
1:3200 and 1:12,800) and incubated with shaking for 2 hours. Plates were washed and SULFO-TAG labeled antiIgG (MSD) was applied to the wells for 1 hour. Plates were washed, enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)

substrate (MSD) applied, and light emission (as a measure of bound IgG) read with the MSD Sector instrument.
BSA readings were subtracted from CoV antigen readings. Area under the curve values for each sample were
used for statistical analysis with zero values (3 samples for anti-NTD) depicted as ten in graphs for optimal
visualization using the log scale.

RBD-ACE2 binding inhibition assay
Plates (384 well) precoated with RBD were supplied by MSD. Plates were blocked for 30 minutes with MSD
Blocker A, washed, sera applied at 1:10 dilution, and incubated with shaking for 1 hour. SULFO-TAG labeled
ACE2 was applied to the wells, incubated for 1 hour, and washed. ECL substrate was applied, and light emission
(a measure of RBD-ACE2 complex) was read by the MSD Sector instrument. The amount of light emitted in
wells containing no sample (assay diluent only) was considered the maximal binding response. Reduction of ECL
response from the maximal binding response was directly proportional to the extent of competitive binding
activity.

Neutralization assay
Vero E6/TMPRSS2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf
serum, HEPES, amphotericin B, and gentamicin sulfate. Sera (100µl) were diluted in cell culture solution with 2fold serial dilutions from 5x to 2560x. Virus (SARS-CoV-2/UW-001/Human/2020/Wisconsin) was diluted in cell
culture solution to an adjusted titer of 100 plaque-forming units (PFU) per 60µl. Diluted sera (60µl) and diluted
virus (60µl) were mixed in wells of 96-well U-bottom plates in duplicate. Plates were incubated at 37ºC for 30
minutes. Culture supernatant was aspirated from Vero E6/TMPRSS2 cells plated in 96 well dishes and replaced
with the mixtures of serially diluted sera and virus (100µl/well, in duplicate) followed by incubation at 37°C with
5% CO2 for 3 days. Crystal violet stain was added to wells to stain for living cells. Neutralization titers were
determined by the maximum fold dilution at which the serum samples could completely prevent cell death as
determined by eye. Some duplicates diverged by a single fold dilution in their neutralization titer. In this situation,

the lower dilution was used as the neutralization titer. Sera with cell death at all dilutions were assigned a dilution
value of 1 for analysis purposes.

Statistics
Antibody levels were compared between COVID-19 convalescent and control sera using a t test or among subsets
of COVID-19 convalescent sera by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s, Dunnett’s, or Dunn’s multiple comparisons
tests as appropriate. Welch’s correction was used for all tests when there was unequal variance. Serum anti-SARSCoV-2 antibody levels at five weeks and three months post symptom resolution in the same subjects were
compared using paired t tests. Correlations between antibody titers obtained by different tests were estimated by
Spearman rank correlation coefficients. The relationship between clinical and demographic factors (age, sex, race,
ethnicity, ADI, BMI, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, active cancer, diabetes, vascular disease, asthma,
immunosuppressive medications, inhaled/intranasal steroid, symptoms, and intubation status) and having been
hospitalized for COVID-19 were examined using the Pearson’s chi-squared test for categorical variables and
Kruskal-Wallis test for non-normally distributed continuous data. Similar analyses were performed in nonhospitalized COVID-19 recovered individuals alone to correlate antibody levels with clinical and demographic
features. Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, USA) and STATA version 16
(College Station, USA). For all analyses, p<0.05 was considered significant.

Figure 1. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 convalescent subjects five weeks post-symptom
resolution. A. Sera from COVID-19 convalescent (black dots, n=113) and SARS-CoV-2 naive (gray dots, n=87)
subjects were analyzed with a multiplex assay to quantify IgG that bound to seasonal HCoV-OC43, HCoVHKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E spike (S) protein, SARS-CoV S, and SARS-CoV-2 S, N terminal domain
(NTD) of S, receptor binding domain (RBD) of S, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. Graph depicts IgG levels reported
as area under the curve (AUC). Unpaired t test with Welch’s correction was used to compare COVID-19
convalescent vs. naive means for each antigen. B. Fold reduction of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2
binding to RBD was assessed with a RBD-ACE2 binding inhibition assay for COVID-19 convalescent (n=113)
and naive (n=88) sera and a t test with Welch’s correction was used to compare means. C. Neutralizing antibody
(Nab) titers were compared by t test with Welch’s correction for COVID-19 convalescent (n=113) and naive
(n=30) sera. D. Nab titers were compared with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels and RBD-ACE2 binding inhibition
for COVID-19 convalescent subjects (n=113). Spearman correlation coefficient (ρ) and p value are listed. For all
panels, bars represent mean and ****p<0.0001.

Figure 2. Patients with more severe COVID-19 have higher antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2. IgG levels
against SARS-CoV-2 S (A), NTD (B), RBD (C), and N (D) determined by multiplex assay, as well as fold
reduction of RBD-ACE2 binding (E), and neutralizing antibodies (F) in COVID-19 convalescent sera five weeks
post-symptom resolution were compared for non-hospitalized (NH) versus hospitalized (Hosp.) subjects by t test
and compared among subjects with differing COVID-19 severity scores by ANOVA. Anti-NTD, anti-RBD, and
fold reduction of RBD-ACE2 binding were compared by Welch's ANOVA with Dunnett's test. Anti-S and antiN were analyzed by ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test, and neutralizing titers were analyzed by
Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with Dunn's multiple comparisons test. For all panels: n=19 Hosp., 94 NH, 12 with
severity score 1 (no fever, chills, productive cough, shortness of breath, or hospitalization), 82 with score 2 (fever,
chills, productive cough, or shortness of breath, but no hospitalization), 12 with score 3 (hospitalized, but not
intubated), 7 with score 4 (intubated); lines indicate mean +/- SEM; *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001,

Figure 3. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 persist three months after COVID-19 symptom resolution. Sera
from COVID-19 convalescent subjects (n=79) collected 5 weeks (w) and 3 months (m) after symptom resolution
were subjected to multiplex assay to detect IgG that binds to SARS-CoV-2 S, NTD, RBD and N antigens (A), to
RBD-ACE2 binding inhibition assay (B), and to SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay (C). Dots, lines, and asterisks
in red represent non-hospitalized (n=67) and in blue represent hospitalized (n=12) subjects with lines connecting
the two time points for individual subjects (*p<0.05 and **p<0.01 by paired t test).
