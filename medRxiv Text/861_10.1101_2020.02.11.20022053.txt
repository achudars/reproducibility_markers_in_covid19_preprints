SUMMARY
An increasing number of cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) infected with 2019-nCoV have
been identified in Wuhan and other cities in China, since December 2019. We analyzed data on the 17
confirmed cases in Dazhou to provide the epidemiologic characteristics of NCP outside Wuhan. Among
them, 12 patients were still quarantined in the hospital, 5 patients were discharged NCP patients
according to the national standards. Compared with non-discharged NCP patients, the discharged NCP
patients had younger ages. Moreover, discharged NCP patients had higher heart rate, lymphocytes
levels and monocytes levels than non-discharged NCP patients on admission to the hospital. Notably,
all of 17 patients had abnormal increased C-reactive protein levels, and 16 patients had abnormal
computed tomography images. This study provided some information that younger age, higher
lymphocytes levels and monocytes levels at the diagnoses of 2019-nCoV may contributed to faster
recovery and better therapeutic outcome.

INTRODUCTION
An outbreak of acute respiratory illness, now named as novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP)1, in
Wuhan, Hubei, China since December 2019 has become a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern (PHEIC)2. The pathogen of NCP is a 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)3, possibly
originated from wild animals in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Until 10 February 2020, a total
number of 40, 261 NCP cases in China has been diagnosed, including 909 deaths4. Internationally, the
patients of NCP have been confirmed in 25 countries and 5 continents4. Human-to-human transmission
is the cause of most infections5,6. The main clinical manifestations of NCP patients are fever, cough,
myalgia5,7,8. Notably, some cases have mild illness onset symptoms without fever. Acute respiratory

distress syndrome (ARDS), RNAaemia, acute cardiac injury, and death could occur in severe patients5.
However, there are few reports on the clinical manifestations of 2019-nCoV in cases or cured patients
outside Wuhan. We aimed to report clinical characteristics of 17 cases with diagnosed 2019-nCoV
infection in Dazhou, Sichuan.

METHODS
Patients were admitted to the Dazhou Central Hospital from 22 January 2020 to 10 February 2020, with
final follow-up for the study on 11 February 2020. Clinical data were collected from the hospital
electronic record system. Suspected 2019-nCoV infection cases were hospitalized and quarantined.
Sample of throat swab were obtained from the patient and sent to the Dazhou Center for Disease
Control and Prevention to detect 2019-nCoV by applying quantitative polymerase chain reaction
analysis5. Meanwhile, computed tomography was used for the suspected patients. The study was
approved by the ethics committee of the Dazhou Central Hospital with written informed consent from
the patients (IRB00000001-20001).
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The
data between groups with variables were compared by χ2 test or Fisher's exact test, and one-way
analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test. All means were reported with the corresponding standard
deviation in tables. The P values < 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.

RESULTS
The median age of the 17 patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection was 45 years (range from 22 to
65; 9 males and 8 females). Among them, 12 patients were still quarantined in the hospital (mean age,

49.4 years; range from 32 to 65; 5 males and 7 females), the remaining 5 patients were discharged NCP
patients according to the national standards (mean age, 34.8 years; range from 22 to 48; 4 males and 1
females) (Table 1). Until 11 February 2020, no difference was observed in duration of hospitalization
between non-discharged NCP patients and discharged NCP patients (P=0.852). Nine patients worked or
visited Wuhan before the onset of the 2019-nCoV epidemic. Four patients had closely contacted with
family members who diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection. Two patients took the train that passed
through Wuhan. Two patients had unknown epidemic area contact history (Table 1).
Eight of the twelve non-discharged NCP patients had a fever before hospitalized (mean±SD,
6.6±3.8 days). Other symptoms included cough (83.3%), fatigue (41.7%), myalgia (16.7%) and
diarrhea (16.7%) (Table 1). Four of five discharged NCP patients had a fever before hospitalized
(mean±SD, 5.3±3.3 days). Other symptoms including cough (60%), fatigue (60%), myalgia (60%) and
dizziness (40%) (Table 1). Compared with non-discharged NCP patients, discharged NCP patients had
higher heart rate (P=0.043), lymphocytes levels (P=0.005) and monocytes levels (P=0.019) on
admission to the hospital (Table 1-2). All patients had abnormal increased C-reactive protein levels
(Table 2).
All seventeen patients had chest computed tomography at the admission of hospital. Seven
non-discharged NCP patients showed patchy shadows or ground glass opacity (58.3%). Other five
patients had either multiple interstitial changes in bilateral lobes or multilobed infectious lesions of
both lungs (41.7%). Among discharged NCP patients, one patient had ground glass opacity (20%),
three patients showed lung infections or inflammatory lesions (60%) and the youngest patients (22
years) had no abnormalities in the lungs (20%) (Figure).

DISCUSSION
2019-nCoV is a betacoronavirus, like SARS and MERS, and it had infected hundreds of thousands of
people since December 2019. There are currently no specific treatments available for 2019-nCoV.
Therefore, the main treatment is optimized supportive care to reduce symptoms and maintain organ
function in severe diseases9,10.
In our single-center case series of 17 hospitalized patients, it provided information on the
epidemiology of the disease outside Wuhan. Routes of infection had no significant difference between
discharged NCP patients and non-discharged NCP patients, but most patients had contact history with
the epidemic area or close contacts with diagnosed patients. Two non-discharged NCP patients have
been living long-term in Dazhou and have no contact history with epidemic area, which implied other
possible infective routines.
In our study, the discharged NCP patients had younger ages compared with non-discharged NCP
patients and no difference in gender distribution was observed. Our study was different from other
reports which reveal that male are more likely to be infected7. Our data also suggested that age may be
a risk factor for poor recovery. In addition, discharged NCP patients showed higher lymphocytes levels
and monocytes levels on admission to hospital, which suggested immune deficiency nay be also a risk
factor for poor outcome in patients. The result was inline with other study that higher level of
lymphocyte was presented in the intensive care unit patients compared with that in non- intensive care
unit patients8. Although C-reactive protein levels was abnormal increased in both discharged NCP and
non-discharged NCP patients, no significant difference was presented in the two groups. Similar results
was observed in lung distribution of patchy shadows or ground glass opacity. This study provided some
information that younger age, higher lymphocytes levels and monocytes levels at the diagnoses of
