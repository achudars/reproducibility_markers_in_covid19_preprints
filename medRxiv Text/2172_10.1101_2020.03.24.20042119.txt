Hospital of Wuhan, China. Clinical features, chronic comorbidities, demographic data, and
laboratory and radiological data were reviewed. The outcomes of patients with severe
pneumonia and those with non-severe pneumonia were compared using the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) to explore clinical
characteristics and risk factors. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to screen
optimal predictors from the risk factors and the predictive power was verified by internal
validation.
Results: A total of 377 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study,
including 117 with severe pneumonia and 260 with non-severe pneumonia. The independent
risk factors for severe pneumonia were age [odds ratio (OR): 1.059, 95% confidence interval
(CI): 1.036–1.082; p < 0.001], N/L (OR: 1.322, 95% CI: 1.180–1.481; p < 0.001), CRP (OR:
1.231, 95% CI: 1.129–1.341; p = 0.002), and D-dimer (OR: 1.059, 95% CI: 1.013–1.107; p =
0.011). We identified a product of N/L*CRP*D-dimer as having an important predictive
value for the severity of COVID-19. The cutoff value was 5.32. The negative predictive value
of less than 5.32 for the N/L*CRP*D-dimer was 93.75%, while the positive predictive value
was 46.03% in the test sets. The sensitivity and specificity were 89.47% and 67.42%. In the
training sets, the negative and positive predictive values were 93.80% and 41.32%,
respectively, with a specificity of 70.76% and a sensitivity of 89.87%.
Conclusions: A product of N/L*CRP*D-dimer may be an important predictor of disease
severity in patients with COVID-19.

Introduction
Since last December, a growing cluster of pneumonia cases caused by the 2019 novel
coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The virus rapidly spread from
Wuhan to the surrounding provinces and cities, which attracted worldwide attention and
public panic1-3. Eventually, the pneumonia was designated as coronavirus disease-19
(COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020. The
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses declared that the virus was officially
classifiable as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on
the same day. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus beta coronavirus of the Coronaviridae
family, which includes the deadly SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronaviruses4-6. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 displays roughly an 89% homology
with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% homology with human SARS-CoV7. It is highly
contagious and has a high mortality rate8. As of 22:00 on March 10, 2020, there were 80,933
confirmed cases, 4,794 severe cases, and 3,140 deaths in China as well as 35,606 confirmed
cases and 975 deaths collectively among all other countries.
The disease is prone to causing respiratory symptoms, such as high fever, dyspnea, and cough.
It may rapidly develop into severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),
multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and death9. As the number of patients with COVID-19
increases, so too does the number of severe cases. Thus far, there are no drugs approved or
verified that are specific to the virus10, 11. Thus, the treatment of patients critically ill with
COVID-19 is becoming one of the main challenges facing clinicians and there is a need adopt
reliable predictors of the severity of COVID-19 to identify and treat the most severe patients
in the early stage. This study therefore sought to explore the adoption of a factor for the
prediction of severity in patients with COVID-19 and provide evidence of its use for the
screening of severely ill patients.

Methods
Patients
Patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, which is a
tertiary teaching hospital and which is responsible for the treatment for patients of COVID-19,
as assigned by the Chinese government. All of the patients were local residents of Wuhan and

had contact with people who had been confirmed (or suspected) to have contracted the illness.
The relevant laboratory examinations, common pathogen detection, and chest computed
tomography (CT) scans were completed. Each patient also underwent the SARS-CoV-2
nucleic acid swab test, with some patients testing positive and others testing negative. The
immaturity of the methods and an incorrect sampling method used for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic
acid detection may have contributed to the false-negative results. High-resolution CT scans
with a scan layer thickness of 5 mm and a reconstruction of a 1- to 1.5-mm thick layer are
recommended for the radiological examination of COVID-19. The included patients were
clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 according to the WHO’s interim guidance12. For
patients who were suspected to have the illness, two senior respiratory doctors made the
diagnosis together.
The study participants were divided into two groups: patients with severe pneumonia and
those with non-severe pneumonia. Patients with the following clinical signs were considered
to have severe pneumonia: fever or suspected respiratory infection plus either a respiratory
rate of greater than 30 breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, or SpO2 of less than 90% on
room air. Patients with ARDS, sepsis, or septic shock were also included. Those patients
without the above severe signs were included in the non-severe pneumonia group. Patients
with other viral, bacterial, and fungal infections upon admission and those with missing data
were excluded. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Wuhan Central Hospital.
As the study is a retrospective study and does not involve patients' privacy, the informed
consent can be exempted
Data collection
Chronic comorbidities, demographic data, laboratory examinations, and chest CT scans were
reviewed using electronic medical records. Data on white blood cell (WBC) count and
lymphocyte (L), neutrophil (N), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), serum albumin (ALB), serum creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), D-dimer,
and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were included. These data were acquired by physicians
and were the results of an examination on the first day after admission. All of the data were
checked by another researcher to ascertain their accuracy.
Internal validation
Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 fashion to undergo training and hold-out test sets.
The predictors were trained in the training group and the optimal cutoff value was obtained.

This internal validation assessed the value for predicting the severity of with COVID-19.
Statistical performance for the classifier was measured by calculating sensitivity, specificity,
and negative and positive predictive values.
Statistical analysis
The continuous variables were either presented as means and compared using t-tests if they
were normally distributed or were described using medians. The Mann–Whitney U test was
used for comparisons. Categorical variables were presented as count (%) and compared by
the chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess risk
factors of severe pneumonia. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to
filter predictors, and internal validation was used to validate the predictive value of predictors.
A two-sided α value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. We used
the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA)
for statistical analysis.

Results
Baseline characteristics
Between January 1 and February 28, 2020, a total of 393 patients with COVID-19 were
enrolled, but only 377 eligible participants were finally included in our analysis. Among them,
there were 172 (45.62%) patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results, 106
(40.93%) patients with non-severe pneumonia, and 66 (56.41%) patients with the severity of
COVID-19. The basic characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1. The
patients with severe pneumonia tended to older. Also, patients with chronic comorbidities,
such as high blood pressure (HBP), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), coronary heart disease
(CHD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, accounted for a larger proportion of the
population in the severe pneumonia group. Relative to those with non-severe pneumonia,
patients with severe pneumonia had significantly high serum WBC count and N, CRP, Cr,
BUN, D-dimer levels and lower albumin and lymphocyte levels. The ratio of neutrophils to
lymphocytes (N/L) was significantly higher in patients with severe pneumonia. In addition,
no significant differences in ALT, AST, or time between onset and admission were apparent.
Risk factors of severe pneumonia

To further determine the independent risk factors of severe pneumonia, we performed a
logistic regression analysis. The results indicated that, after adjusting for confounding factors
such as gender, T2DM, HBP, CHD, Cr, BUN, and ALB, the independent risk factors for
severe pneumonia were age [odds ratio (OR): 1.059, 95% confidence interval (CI):
1.036–1.082; p < 0.001], N/L (OR: 1.322, 95% CI: 1.180–1.481; p < 0.001), CRP (OR: 1.231,
95% CI: 1.129–1.341; p = 0.002), and D-dimer (OR: 1.059, 95% CI: 1.013–1.107l p = 0.001)
(Table 2).
Predictors of severity pneumonia
The ROC curve was used to analyze the predictive value of N/L, CRP, and D-dimer for
determining disease severity in patients with COVID-19. The area under the ROC curve
(AUC) was further estimated (Figure 1-3), which suggested that these factors were not ideal
predictors of the severity of COVID-19. To find a better predictor, we combined the three
variables in different ways and analyzed the ROC curve for the new factors. Finally, the result
showed that the product of N/L, CRP, and D-dimer (N/L*CRP*D-dimer) was a factor worth
exploring. We performed an ROC curve analysis of N/L*CRP*D-dimer for diagnosing severe
pneumonia. The AUC was 0.888 (95% CI: 0.856–0.921), with a specificity of 65.3% and a
sensitivity of 95.7% (Figure 4). The cutoff value was 2.6839.
Internal validation
To further explore the predictive value of N/L*CRP*D-dimer in the severity of COVID-19,
we also conducted an internal validation. About 30% of patients were randomly selected from
the total population as test sets and the rest were designated as the training sets. Basic
characteristics of patients in the two sets are listed in Table 3. ROC curves for the new
predictor in the test sets are shown in Figure 5; the cutoff point was not derived. The AUC
was 0.879 (95% CI: 0.838–0.921), with a specificity of 73.7% and a sensitivity of 88.6% in
the training sets (Figure 6), and the cutoff value was 7.9622. The optimal cutoff value
obtained from the average cutoff value of the original data group and the training sets was
5.32; thus, patients in the training and test sets were reclassified according to this result.
Patients with N/L*CRP*D-dimer results of less than 5.32 were classified as patients with
non-severe pneumonia in predicted groups. Otherwise, they were classified as patients with
severe pneumonia. As can be seen from Tables 4 and 5, the negative predictive value (a
diagnosis of non-severe pneumonia) of less than 5.32 for the N/L*CRP*D-dimer was 93.75%
(95% CI: 0.8456–0.9799), and the positive predictive value (a diagnosis of severe pneumonia)

was 46.03% (95% CI: 0.3431–0.5821) among the test sets. The sensitivity and specificity
were 89.47% (95% CI: 0.7529–0.9641) and 67.42% (95% CI: 0.5711–0.7628), respectively.
In the training sets, the negative and positive predictive values were 93.80% (95% CI:
0.8806–0.9700) and 41.32% (95% CI: 0.3294–0.5024), respectively, with a specificity of
70.76% (95% CI: 0.6353–0.7708) and a sensitivity of 89.87% (95% CI: 0.8103–0.9502)
(Tables 4 and 5). Results for negative and positive predictive values with the use of the full
data set (training and test sets) are also shown in Tables 4 and 5.
Discussion
This was a cross-sectional study that sought to investigate predictive factors of the severity of
COVID-19. We found that age, N/L, CRP, and D-dimer were independent risk factors for the
severity of COVID-19. Our results suggested that age was positively correlated with the
severity of COVID-19. The result was also confirmed in other research13. This is probably
because the resistance of the elders against virus decreases with age increase, basic diseases,
and many other factors. Moreover, the aggravation of the basic disease profile of elderly
patients would also lead to deterioration in the face of the severe pneumonia. The increases in
N/L and CRP may be related to cytokine storms, which produce a series of inflammatory
responses and cause disorders in peripheral WBCs and immune cells such as lymphocytes14.
The observed decrease in lymphocytes indicated that coronavirus consumes many immune
cells and inhibits the body’s cellular immune function. Damage to lymphocytes might
contribute to exacerbations of patients and even cause death15. A significant increase of
D-dimer in the progression of severe pneumonia was also observed, which was consistent
with the results of Wang13. This may be correlated with the damage to the pulmonary arteries
caused by the virus16, which leads to significant embolization in the extensive alveolar
terminal capillaries. These changes eventually contribute to an increase in D-dimer.
Although N/L, CRP, and D-dimer were independent risk factors for the severity of
COVID-19, the ROC curve showed that they have a low predictive value for the severity of
the infection. In clinical practice, a very high negative predictive value is crucial in the
evaluation of a patient with the severity of COVID-19, since failure to detect severe patients
could have devastating consequences for these individuals. This study suggested that the
product of N/L*CRP*D-dimer had better predictive performance for the severity of
COVID-19 relative to single biomarkers. The predictive value of N/L*CRP*D-dimer was
also confirmed in the internal validation stage. The observed negative predictive value of

N/L*CRP*D-dimer was more than 90%, while the positive predictive value was more than
40%, with a specificity of 69.62% and a sensitivity of 89.84%, which appears to represent an
improvement in prediction as compared with other clinical variables.
In general, the product of N/L*CRP*D-dimer is a new predictive value for the severity of
COVID-19. The study validated an N/L*CRP*D-dimer cutoff point of 5.32 for the prediction.
Clinicians should pay close attention to these indicators and calculate the value to identify
severe patients as early as possible.
Importantly, our study has limitations. First, laboratory testing methods may not be the same
in every hospital and the optimal cutoff point for the product value may vary. Further, only
377 patients were included in this study, where the product of N/L*CRP*D-dimer was found
for the first time, so larger-scale data from randomized trials are needed to estimate whether
to use this predictor in clinical practice.

Sensitivity was calculated on the basis of the number of patients stratified into the severe group; specificity was
calculated on the basis of the number of patients stratified into the non-severe group; negative predictive value
was calculated on the basis of the number of patients with non-severe pneumonia properly classified; positive
predictive value was calculated on the basis of the number of patients with the severity of COVID-19 properly
classified.
