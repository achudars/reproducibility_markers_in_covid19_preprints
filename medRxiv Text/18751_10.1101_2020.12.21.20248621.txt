Abstract
Background: Numerous interventions for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have
been investigated by randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This systematic review and
Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) aim to provide a comprehensive evaluation of
efficacy of available treatments for COVID-19.
Methods: We searched for candidate COVID-19 studies in WHO COVID-19 Global
Research Database, PubMed, PubMed Central, LitCovid, Proquest Central and Ovid up
to December 19, 2020. RCTs for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients were
included, regardless of publication status or demographic characteristics. Bayesian NMA
with fixed effects was conducted to estimate the effect sizes using posterior means and 95%
equal-tailed credible intervals (CrIs), while that with random effects was carried out as
well for sensitivity analysis. Bayesian hierarchical models were used to estimate effect
sizes of treatments grouped by their drug classifications.
Results: We identified 96 eligible RCTs with a total of 51187 patients. Compared with
the standard of care (SOC), this NMA showed that dexamethasone led to lower risk of
mortality with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.85 (95% CrI [0.76, 0.95]; moderate certainty) and
lower risk of mechanical ventilation (MV) with an OR of 0.68 (95% CrI [0.56, 0.83]; low
certainty). For hospital discharge, remdesivir (OR 1.37, 95% CrI [1.15, 1.64]; moderate
certainty), dexamethasone (OR 1.20, 95% CrI [1.08, 1.34]; low certainty), interferon beta
(OR 2.15, 95% CrI [1.26, 3.74]; moderate certainty), tocilizumab (OR 1.40, 95% CrI
[1.05, 1.89]; moderate certainty) and baricitinib plus remdesivir (OR 1.75, 95% CrI [1.28,
2.39]; moderate certainty) could all increase the discharge rate respectively. Recombinant
human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor indicated lower risk of MV (OR 0.20, 95%

CrI [0.10, 0.40]; moderate certainty); and patients receiving convalescent plasma resulted
in better viral clearance (OR 2.28, 95% CrI [1.57, 3.34]; low certainty). About two-thirds
of the studies included in this NMA were rated as high risk of bias, and the certainty of
evidence was either low or very low for most of the comparisons.
Conclusion: The Bayesian NMA identified superiority of several COVID-19 treatments
over SOC in terms of mortality, requirement of MV, hospital discharge and viral
clearance. These results provide a comprehensive comparison of current COVID-19
treatments and shed new light on further research and discovery of potential COVID-19
treatments.

Introduction
The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first identified at the end
of 2019 in Wuhan, China, has become a global threat to public health. By December 20,
2020, over 76.4 million confirmed cases including 1.69 million deaths have been
reported.1 Faced with such a global crisis, identifying effective treatments for COVID-19
is of urgent need and paramount importance for clinical researchers. Development of
novel drugs typically takes years of concerted efforts and thus most of current research in
COVID-19 treatment has been focused on drug repositioning, i.e., investigating the
treatment effect of drugs approved for other diseases on COVID-19 patients.
Till December 2020, over 7000 clinical trials related to COVID-19 have been registered
worldwide. Although numerous medications have been investigated by randomized
controlled trials (RCTs), only dexamethasone2, 3 and remdesivir4, 5 were proven to be
clinically effective, while several other antiviral medications were approved for
emergency or compassionate use.
During the drug repurposing process, clinicians identify candidate drugs for a specific
disease by estimating drug-disease or drug-drug similarities. Drugs with shared chemical
structures and mechanisms of action are supposed to deliver similar therapeutic
applications.6 Not only should research focus on individual treatment for COVID-19, but
it is also of great interest to evaluate a class of treatments with shared clinical properties
and biochemical structures. For example, systemic corticosteroids including
methylprednisolone, dexamethasone and hydrocortisone were reported to be associated
with reduced 28-day mortality for COVID-19 patients of critical illness.7

With global efforts on pursuing effective treatments during the pandemic, many shortterm RCTs of small size were conducted and published at a high rate, and some trials
were carried out in a rather rush manner which might cause deterioration of trial quality.
Timely summaries and analyses on existing clinical trial results can help to better
understand various treatments, early terminate investigation on proven ineffective
treatments and provide necessary guidelines for further research and discovery of new
treatment. However, with a large number of treatments evaluated against the standard of
care (SOC) or other active comparators in RCTs, the conventional pairwise meta-analysis
is limited in simultaneous comparisons among multiple trials and fails to capture indirect
evidence for treatments that have not been tested in a head-to-head comparison. A
network meta-analysis (NMA) which combines both direct and indirect information in a
network would be more appropriate to accommodate such complex environments.
Several NMA publications provided useful information on the comparative effectiveness
of common repurposed drugs for patients with COVID-19.8, 9 Our work formulated
Bayesian hierarchical models using fixed and random effects respectively, which could
effectively borrow information across different trials in the NMA. Not only does our
NMA evaluate treatments at the drug level, but it also provides an overall estimated
effect at the class level which may contain several drugs of a similar type.
This NMA simultaneously evaluates the clinical benefits of individual treatments and
classifications of multiple treatments for COVID-19. We construct a Bayesian
hierarchical framework on the effect sizes of treatments and classes, and results were
presented and interpreted on both the individual drug level and the class level.

Methods
This systematic review and NMA were conducted and reported in accordance with the
guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) for NMAs10.

Eligibility criteria
We only included RCTs for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in the systematic
review and meta-analysis, because non-randomized trials and observational studies were
considered of low certainty of evidence11. We included trials published in English and
Chinese regardless of the publication status (peer-reviewed or preprint), ways of
randomization (double-blind, single-blind or open-label) or study location. Patients in all
age groups and of all baseline severities of illness were considered eligible.
We examined treatments for COVID-19 irrespective of dose or duration of administration.
Exclusion criteria for the interventions were given as follows: (i) herbal medicine; (ii)
preventive interventions (e.g., vaccination and mask wearing); (iii) non-drug supportive
care; (iv) exercise, psychological and educational treatments. No restrictions were placed
on the control group and we included studies comparing drugs to other active comparator,
placebo, SOC or no intervention.

Outcome measures
The outcomes of interest in the NMA included overall mortality, requirement for
mechanical ventilation (MV), discharge from hospital on day 14 or the day closest to that,
and viral clearance on day 7 or the day closest to that. We evaluated only binary

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.21.20248621; this version posted December 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this

outcomes since most COVID-19 trials had a less than one-month follow-up,8 and for such
short-term studies, continuous or survival outcomes might not provide a clinically
meaningful and relevant summary for treatment effect12. In addition, the clinical
definitions of several continuous outcomes, e.g., time to clinical improvement,
deterioration and symptom resolution, were not consistent across trials. Different
reporting patterns of point and interval estimates for continuous outcomes may also cause
additional difficulties and biases in the NMA.
To solve inconsistent reporting for the requirement of MV across trials, we adopted a
hierarchical data extraction approach.8 We used the number of patients requiring MV
during the follow-up period if reported; otherwise, we collected the numbers of patients
mechanically ventilated at all available time points and used the maximum value.

Information sources
We performed exhaustive online search for eligible studies in six databases: WHO
COVID-19 Global Research Database13, PubMed, PubMed Central, LitCovid, Proquest
Central and Ovid. Supplementary Table S1 presents detailed searching strategies for each
database.
We updated the literature search weekly to include newly published trials. The current
version of manuscript included studies from January 1, 2020 to December 19, 2020. The
update of our NMA results will continue on the monthly basis to provide timely
assessment on all therapeutic treatments for COVID-19.

Study selection

Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts using the inclusion criteria.
Studies identified as relevant with full text available were further assessed for eligibility.
Discrepancies were resolved by the same two reviewers via discussion and, if necessary,
a third senior investigator would make the final decision.

Data collection process
Data extraction was conducted by two investigators independently. For each eligible
study, we collected trial characteristics (e.g., the trial registration number, publication
status, study status, randomization), interventions, characteristics of participants at
baseline (e.g., age, sex, severity of illness, etc.) and outcomes of interest. For the four
binary outcomes (mortality, MV, discharge and viral clearance), numbers of events and
overall numbers of patients were collected. Two reviewers resolved discrepancies if any
via discussion and a third party would adjudicate the conflict. For multiple reports on the
same trial, we adopted the peer-reviewed publication if available, or the latest preprint.

Risk of bias within individual studies
For each eligible trial, we used a revision8 of version 2 of the Cochrane risk of bias tool
(RoB 2.0)14 to assess risk of bias in RCTs. Trials were evaluated on five bias domains
including bias arising from the randomization process, bias due to deviations from
intended interventions, bias due to missing outcome data, bias in measurement of the
outcome and bias in selection of the reported result, and for each domain it was labelled
as low, probably low, probably high or high risk of bias. A trial would be rated as low
risk if all of five domains were labelled as probably low or low risk of bias; otherwise, it

would be rated as high risk. Detailed risk-of-bias judgments were listed in Supplementary
Materials. Two reviewers separately completed the RoB assessment and, in presence of
any disagreement, a third party would make the final decision.

Data synthesis and statistical analysis
We conducted a fixed-effects NMA under a Bayesian hierarchical framework. A randomeffects NMA was adopted if there existed heterogeneity among trials. However, for most
of the comparisons between two treatments, only a few studies were reported and the
assessment of heterogeneity might not be reliable. Moreover, sample sizes of trials varied
dramatically within some comparisons; for example, the relatively large trials,
RECOVERY2, 15, 16 and SOLIDARITY17, would typically dominate the estimates. In the
network, each node represents a treatment, regardless of dose or duration of
administration. For the studies involving different doses or durations of the same drug18,
we aggregated data of the same drug into one arm. Each multi-arm trial was treated as a
single study in the network analysis, instead of splitting it into several two-arm sub-trials.
Interventions composed of more than one drug were treated as separate nodes with each
corresponding to one drug. In addition, interval estimates could be imprecise for
treatments tested with small sample size8, 19. Therefore, for each clinical outcome, we
excluded the treatments appearing in only one trial with fewer than 100 patients to
alleviate potential risk caused by inadequate information. We plotted the network for
each outcome of interest using the igraph20 package of R version 4.0.3 (RStudio, Boston,
MA) as shown in Supplementary Materials.

The Bayesian NMA model was built upon assuming binomial distribution of observed
data with a logit link on binomial probability and the relative effects were evaluated at
the log odds scale while assuming consistency21. Based on the Anatomical Therapeutic
Chemical Classification System with Defined Daily Doses (ATC/DDD)22 published by
WHO, we classified the included drugs by the second level of their ATC/DDD codes. For
example, both hydroxychloroquine (P01BA02) and chloroquine (P01BA01) belong to
antiprotozoals (P01). For the investigational drugs without ATC/DDD codes, we
determined their classifications according to the pharmacological mechanism and
therapeutic use. Detailed information on the classifications of eligible drugs is presented
in Supplementary Table S2. We considered a hierarchical structure for investigated
interventions where the relative effects compared with the SOC were nested within drug
classifications. The Bayesian multi-layer structure enables us to model the variability on
different levels and estimate the treatment benefits of individual drugs and their
classifications simultaneously. We assigned the same vague inverse-gamma prior
distributions to the variance parameters and normal prior distributions to the effect size
parameters. The Bayesian hierarchical structure for the NMA is shown in Supplementary
Figure S1.
We fitted the Bayesian NMA model and generated posterior samples of parameters using
the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The treatment effects of eligible
drugs were evaluated in terms of odds ratios (ORs) which were estimated by the posterior
means and corresponding equal-tailed 95% credible intervals (CrI). To obtain the direct
and indirect estimates for treatment effects and assess local inconsistency in the network,
we considered the node-splitting method23. The MCMC sampling was performed using

the jagsUI24, 25 package of R, and further network analyses were performed using the
gemtc26 package of R.

Certainty of the evidence
The grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE)
approach for NMA11 was used to rate the certainty of evidence of NMA estimates. Two
investigators rated the certainty of each treatment comparison independently and resolved
discrepancies by discussions and, if necessary, consulted with a third party. We
considered each of the following seven criteria: RoB27, inconsistency28, indirectness29,
publication bias30, intransitivity11, incoherence31 and imprecision32, to evaluate the
certainty of NMA estimates as high, moderate, low and very low. The certainty would be
rated down by one scale if no less than half of the trials directly comparing two
treatments were of high RoB. The inconsistency was assessed by the Higgins I2 statistics
and the Cochran Q test33 and we identified inconsistency if I2>50% or p-value<0.05 from
the Cochran Q test. We rated down by one scale for publication bias due to asymmetric
funnel plots or industry sponsorship.30 Baseline patient characteristics, especially the
severity of illness, were used for the evaluation of intransitivity. The minimally
contextualised approach34 considering only the CrI and null effect was used for assessing
imprecision. We set a threshold of 0.02 rather than the null value 0 in the log OR scale in
order to demonstrate more convincing evidence in each paired comparison. Detailed
ratings and rationales for downgrading were provided in the Supplementary Materials.

Subgroup and sensitivity analysis

Planned subgroup analyses were conducted for peer-reviewed studies only and
mild/moderate versus severe/critical COVID-19 patients at baseline. In addition to
Bayesian fixed-effects NMA, we also performed Bayesian random-effects NMA and
presented results in Supplementary Materials. In the primary analysis, we treated three
published studies for the RECOVERY trial2, 15, 16 which respectively compared
lopinavir/ritonavir, dexamethasone and hydroxychloroquine versus SOC, as a four-arm
trial according to the RECOVERY protocol v6.0.35 The SOC group with the largest
number of participants2 was used in the primary analysis. Similarly, although the
SOLIDARTIY trial17 reported four pairwise comparisons between interventions and SOC,
we treated it as a five-arm trial due to substantial overlap across SOC groups.
Furthermore, we performed a sensitivity analysis by treating RECOVERY as three twoarm trials and SOLIDARITY as four two-arm trials.

Results
According to the prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria, we identified and screened
4563 titles and abstracts after de-duplication. Out of these, 146 studies were further
reviewed for full text and 96 eligible studies reporting 93 unique randomized clinical
trials were included in the systematic review,2, 5, 15-18, 36-125 where the RECOVERY trial
was reported in four studies.2, 15, 16, 76 Figure 1 summarizes the process of our study
selection.
Out of these 96 studies included in the NMA, 68 were peer-reviewed and the other 28
were preprints. Over two-thirds of the studies (65/96) were open-label, 27 were doubleblind and the remaining 4 were single-blind in randomization. Most of the studies

reported completed clinical trials (84/96) rather than ongoing (6/96) or early terminated
trials (6/96) and investigated hospitalized COVID-19 patients (88/96). Twenty-four
studies were conducted in China, ten in Brazil, nine in Iran, eight in the USA and nine in
multi-sites across countries. Among the 96 studies, ten were multi-arm and the rest were
two-arm; 69 studies compared the investigated intervention with SOC, 19 with other
active comparators and the other eight with both SOC and other interventions. About half
of the studies (47/96) were of small sample size which enrolled less than 100 patients in
the intention-to-treat population, seven studies recruited over 1000 patients, including
four reports for the RECOVERY trial2, 15, 16, 76, one for the SOLIDARITY17 trial, one for
remdesivir5 and one for baricitinib plus remdesivir83. Of 74 studies which recorded the
baseline severity of illness, 28 involved patients mainly with severe or critical COVID-19
and 46 were mainly for mild/moderate disease. Detailed trial and patient characteristics
are given in Supplementary Materials.
Sixteen randomized trials were not considered in the meta-analysis. Among them, four
studies investigated different doses or durations of administration of the same
intervention without comparisons with other interventions or SOC.45, 46, 64, 71 Eight trials
did not specify the outcomes of interest.55, 58, 68, 81, 93, 101, 122, 123 Treatments in four trials
were not connected in the network.73, 77, 86, 98

filtering out treatments with small sample size following the specified criteria, the
network included azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, hydroxychloroquine plus
azithromycin, colchicine, arbidol (umifenovir), favipiravir, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir,
convalescent plasma, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone,
immunoglobulin, interferon beta, recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor (GCSF), tocilizumab, vitamin D3, baricitinib plus remdesivir, sulodexide and SOC.
Among the 50 trials which investigated the included treatments, the risk of bias was
accessed as low for 18 trials. The other trials were judged at high risk of bias mainly
because of bias due to deviations from the intended intervention (see Supplementary
Materials). Compared with SOC, the Bayesian NMA with fixed-effects showed that only
dexamethasone (OR 0.85, 95% CrI [0.76, 0.95]; moderate certainty) and
lopinavir/ritonavir (OR 0.88, 95% CrI [0.79, 0.97]; moderate certainty) could reduce the
mortality rate with statistical significance. Among all interventions, only
hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab and vitamin D3 reported higher risk of death versus
control but not statistically significant, as shown in Figure 2. Colchicine (very low
certainty), lopinavir/ritonavir (low certainty), hydrocortisone (moderate certainty),
immunoglobulin (low certainty), baricitinib plus remdesivir (very low certainty) and
sulodexide (very low certainty) might be of potential benefit compared to SOC with
posterior probability favouring treatment larger than 0.9. The class of
immunosuppressants plus antivirals for systemic use and antithrombotic agents might be
of potential benefit due to their relatively large posterior probabilities favouring treatment
(larger than 0.9) and the other classes showed no difference from SOC.

For the random-effects model, the estimated relative effects versus SOC were similar to
those in the fixed-effects model but with wider credible intervals, e.g., dexamethasone
with an OR of 0.82 (95% CrI [0.63, 1.04]). In the sensitivity analysis by treating three
studies of RECOVERY2, 15, 16 as three two-arm trials and SOLIDARITY17 as four twoarm trials, all estimates were close to those in the primary analysis except for
lopinavir/ritonavir (see Supplementary Materials), which reported an OR of 0.88 (95%
CrI [0.79, 0.97]) in the primary analysis and 1.01 (95% CrI [0.90, 1.14]) in the sensitivity
analysis. The gap on the 28-day mortality rate between the SOC arm with the largest
number of patients2 (25.7%, 1110/4321) and the SOC arm of the lopinavir/ritonavir trial15
(22.4%, 767/3424) mainly contributed to the discrepancy in the estimates of OR for
lopinavir/ritonavir versus SOC.

Mechanical ventilation
Overall, 48 studies reported the number of patients required for MV during the study
period.2, 5, 15-17, 36-39, 41-44, 47-50, 56, 57, 60-63, 65, 69, 72, 76, 78, 82, 83, 87, 92, 95-97, 100, 103-105, 108-110, 112-114,

with 41405 patients and 4455 events. We included azithromycin,

hydroxychloroquine, hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, remdesivir,
lopinavir/ritonavir, convalescent plasma, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone,
hydrocortisone, immunoglobulin, interferon beta, recombinant human GCSF, tocilizumab,
vitamin D3, baricitinib plus remdesivir, sulodexide and SOC as treatment nodes in the
NMA. We evaluated the risk of bias for 34 RCTs and among them 12 were rated as low
risk. Compared with SOC, dexamethasone (OR 0.68, 95% CrI [0.56, 0.83]; low certainty)
and recombinant human GCSF (OR 0.20, 95% CrI [0.10, 0.40]; moderate certainty) had

significantly lower MV rates (Figure 3). Tocilizumab (moderate certainty), vitamin D3
(moderate certainty) and baricitinib plus remdesivir (very low certainty) showed potential
benefit over SOC in reducing MV events with posterior probability favouring treatment
higher than 0.9. Patients randomized to azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine,
hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin and lopinavir/ritonavir had higher risk of MV than
those receiving SOC and all were rated as low or very low certainty. The class of
immunostimulants containing interferon beta and recombinant human GCSF was of
potential benefit compared with SOC due to its relatively large posterior probability
favouring treatment (0.94) and the other classes showed no difference from SOC.
The Bayesian random-effects NMA reported similar point estimates with substantial
wider interval estimates. Dexamethasone had an OR of 0.70 with 95% CrI [0.47, 1.08]
covering the null effect, while recombinant human GSCF still yielded a significantly
lower rate of MV compared with SOC (OR 0.27, 95% CrI [0.11, 0.67]) under the
random-effects model. Whether RECOVERY and SOLIDARITY were treated as multiarm trials or multiple two-arm trials had no influence on estimates of relative effects
since the MV rates in the SOC groups of the three RECOVERY studies2, 15, 16 were
similar and so was the SOLIDARTITY trial.17

Discharge (closest to 14 days)
The hospital discharge rate was reported in 36 studies including 31436 patients and
19365 events.2, 5, 15, 16, 36, 43, 47, 48, 50, 54, 60, 65, 66, 69, 75, 76, 79, 80, 83, 85, 88, 89, 91, 92, 96, 100, 103, 107-110,
112, 113, 116, 117, 120

Treatment nodes included in the network were azithromycin,

hydroxychloroquine, hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, favipiravir, remdesivir,

lopinavir/ritonavir, convalescent plasma, dexamethasone, interferon beta, tocilizumab,
baricitinib plus remdesivir and SOC. Out of the 26 RCTs included in the NMA, nine
were assessed as low risk of bias. Patients who received remdesivir (OR 1.37, 95% CrI
[1.15, 1.64]; moderate certainty), lopinavir/ritonavir (OR 1.30, 95% CrI [1.16, 1.47]; low
certainty), dexamethasone (OR 1.20, 95% CrI [1.08, 1.34]; low certainty), interferon beta
(OR 2.16, 95% CrI [1.26, 3.74]; moderate certainty), tocilizumab (OR 1.40, 95% CrI
[1.05, 1.89]; moderate certainty) and baricitinib plus remdesivir (OR 1.75, 95% CrI [1.28,
2.39]; moderate certainty) had a higher discharge rate compared with those in the SOC
arm. Hydroxychloroquine (OR 0.87, 95% CrI [0.78, 0.96]; moderate certainty) was even
inferior to SOC and led to high risk of hospitalization at around 14 days (Figure 4). The
class of immunostimulants containing only interferon beta showed potential benefit on
hospital discharge with posterior probability favouring treatment equal to 0.95.
For the random-effects model, with wider interval estimates, remdesivir (OR 1.36, 95%
CrI [1.06, 1.75]), lopinavir/ritonavir (OR 1.38, 95% CrI [1.09, 1.82]) and interferon beta
(OR 2.17, 95% CrI [1.23, 3.88]) still maintained their significant benefit over SOC in
terms of discharge. However, a sensitivity analysis treating RECOVERY2, 15, 16 as three
two-arm trials reported an insignificant OR of 1.01 (95% CrI [0.89, 1.14]) for
lopinavir/ritonavir versus SOC. Similar to the case when evaluating mortality, such
discrepancy was caused by the different event rates in the two SOC arms used.2, 15

Viral clearance (closest to 7 days)

Twenty-one studies including 3183 patients and 1403 events reported viral clearance
rates. 39, 43, 52, 53, 65, 67, 79, 80, 82, 84, 88, 90, 92, 99, 102, 115, 117, 119-121, 124 Treatment nodes in the
network included hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide, hydroxychloroquine plus
azithromycin, favipiravir, remdesivir, convalescent plasma, methylprednisolone and SOC.
Out of these 15 trials included in the NMA, six were judged at low risk of bias. Under the
fixed-effects NMA, the OR of nitazoxanide versus SOC was 1.72 (95% CrI [1.13, 2.80];
low certainty) and that of convalescent plasma was 2.28 (95% CrI [1.57, 3.34]; low
certainty), which indicated that administration of nitazoxanide and convalescent plasma
improved virologic cure (Figure 5). Hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir might be of
potential benefit compared with SOC due to posterior probability favouring treatment
larger than 0.9, although both had very low certainty. The class of blood substitutes and
perfusion solutions contained only one treatment convalescent plasma, which probably
improved viral clearance with an OR of 2.28 (95% CrI [0.48, >10]; posterior probability
favouring treatment 0.92).
For the random-effects model, nitazoxanide (OR 1.34, 95% CrI [0.53, 3.97]) did not
show superiority over SOC, while convalescent plasma (OR 2.87, 95% CrI [1.23, 7.31])
was still effective in virus elimination. The RECOVERY trial did not report viral
clearance and thus no sensitivity analysis was carried out.

Discussion
In this systematic review and NMA, we provided a detailed summary of trial
characteristics of published RCTs for COVID-19 patients up to December 7, 2020 and
reported effectiveness of treatments at both the drug and class levels compared with SOC

in terms of mortality, MV, discharge and viral clearance. Dexamethasone was shown to
reduce the risk of mortality (moderate certainty), MV (low certainty) and hospitalization
(low certainty). Recombinant GCSF resulted in fewer events of MV with moderate
certainty of evidence. Patients who received nitazoxanide and convalescent plasma (both
low certainty) had a higher viral elimination rate in comparison with SOC. Remdesivir,
lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon beta, tocilizumab and baricitinib plus remdesivir
demonstrated their effectiveness on clinical improvement with significantly higher 14day discharge rates compared with SOC. However, most of the comparisons were rated
as low or very low certainty of evidence.
At the class level of treatments, immunosuppressants plus antivirals for systemic use and
antithrombotic agents might reduce mortality, immunostimulants showed potential
clinical benefit over SOC in reducing MV and hospitalization, and blood substitutes and
perfusion solutions probably increased the rate of viral clearance on day 7, with posterior
probability favouring treatment larger than 0.9. For other classes and outcomes, we
observed no difference from SOC.

Strength and limitations
Not only was this NMA timely conducted, but it also included a wide range of RCTs,
which contained not only common drugs but also interferons, blood products, mineral
and vitamin supplementations without restrictions on publication status. Risk of bias for
individual studies and rating of certainty for NMA estimates were carefully conducted
and detailed information and reasons for corresponding assessments are given in

Supplementary Materials. Treatment effects for multiple treatments were evaluated in a
network at both the individual drug and class levels.
This study has several limitations. The primary one is the low or very low certainty of
evidence for most NMA estimates. For each outcome of interest, about two-thirds of
trials were graded as high risk and the major reason was lack of blinding in the trials,
leading to potential bias in the NMA. At the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic, with
limited clinical resources and urgent need to obtain trial results, many RCTs were
conducted with simplified procedures, e.g., no placebo prepared, including the large
RECOVERY and SOLIDARITY trials. As time goes on, such situation has changed and
recently many double-blind RCTs have been conducted and published. Moreover,
networks of treatments were sparse because most of the included studies evaluated
interventions versus SOC and there were few direct comparisons between interventions.
As we considered COVID-19 RCTs regardless of baseline patient characteristics,
intransitivity existed in many indirect comparisons. For example, hydroxychloroquine
trials usually investigated patients with mild or moderate COVID-19, while patients
treated by convalescent plasma were mainly of severe or critical illness. Detailed
subgroup analysis might help to solve such problem.
Another limitation of this study arises from the evaluation of NMA estimates at the class
level. Many investigated classes in the NMA contained only one treatment, leading to
large variation and thus insignificant interval estimates. To confirm the superiority of a
class of drugs, one should present evidence of more strengths. More treatments can be
included in the NMA if the exclusion criteria of treatment nodes were relaxed, while such
operation would introduce additional bias due to trials with small sample size.

With a large number of completed COVID-19 trials, studies reporting positive results or
with large sample size were more likely to be published, leading to possible publication
bias.30 We considered studies irrespective of publication status to alleviate publication
bias and obtained as much information as possible. While extra attention should be paid
on the evidence implied by only preprints. For example, the significant benefit of
nitazoxanide on viral clearance was shown in only one preprint,102 and clinical results
without peer-reviews should not be trusted equally as those published.
Different approaches to dealing with the RECOVERY trial led to discrepancies between
the results of the primary and sensitivity analyses, especially for lopinavir/ritonavir. The
RECOVERY trial was designed as a multi-arm trial35 while the numbers of patients
randomized to SOC and event rates of outcomes of interest were different across different
reports.2, 15, 16 Although lopinavir/ritonavir showed potential clinical effects on the
reduction of mortality and increase of the discharge rate, credibility of this finding
warrants extra caution.

Conclusion
This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that dexamethasone could reduce the
mortality, requirements of MV and increase the discharge rate. Administration of
remdesivir led to a higher discharge rate, but showed no difference from SOC for
mortality, MV and viral clearance. Patients receiving recombinant GCSF had lower risk
of MV. Nitazoxanide and convalescent plasma could improve the viral elimination,
although the evidence of nitazoxanide was supported solely by one preprint.
Lopinavir/ritonavir showed clinical benefits on the increase of the discharge rate and

reduction of mortality, while inconsistency between the primary and sensitivity analyses
caused extra uncertainty. At the treatment class level, immunosuppressants plus antivirals
for systemic use and antithrombotic agents could probably reduce the risk of death,
immunostimulants tended to reduce MV and increase discharge, and blood substitutes
and perfusion solutions might improve viral clearance.
