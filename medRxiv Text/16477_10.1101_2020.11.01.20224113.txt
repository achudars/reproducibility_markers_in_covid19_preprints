Abstract

34

Accurate and rapid diagnostic tools are needed for management of the ongoing coronavirus

35

disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Antibody tests enable detection of individuals past

36

the initial phase of infection and will help to examine possible vaccine responses. The

37

major targets of human antibody response in severe acute respiratory syndrome

38

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are the spike glycoprotein (S) and nucleocapsid protein (N).

39

We have developed a rapid homogenous approach for antibody detection termed LFRET

40

(protein L-based time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer immunoassay). In

41

LFRET, fluorophore-labeled protein L and antigen are brought to close proximity by

42

antigen-specific patient immunoglobulins of any isotype, resulting in TR-FRET signal

43

generation.

44

We set up LFRET assays for antibodies against S and N and evaluated their diagnostic

45

performance using a panel of 77 serum/plasma samples from 44 individuals with COVID-

46

19 and 52 negative controls. Moreover, using a previously described S construct and a

47

novel N construct, we set up enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for antibodies

48

against SARS-CoV-2 S and N. We then compared the LFRET assays with these enzyme

49

immunoassays and with a SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization test (MNT).

50

We found the LFRET assays to parallel ELISAs in sensitivity (90-95% vs. 90-100%) and

51

specificity (100% vs. 94-100%). In identifying individuals with or without a detectable

52

neutralizing antibody response, LFRET outperformed ELISA in specificity (91-96% vs.

53

82-87%), while demonstrating an equal sensitivity (98%).

54

In conclusion, this study demonstrates the applicability of LFRET, a 10-minute ‘mix and

55

read’ assay, to detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Introduction

57
58

In October 2020, the number of confirmed cases in the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019

59

(COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

60

(SARS-CoV-2), exceeded 40 million, with over a million deaths1. Reliable diagnostic

61

assays are needed for specific management of COVID-19 patients as well as for epidemic

62

surveillance and containment ("Test, trace and isolate"). Nucleic acid tests (NAT) or

63

antigen tests serve to detect acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas antibody testing tells

64

the past-infection and/or immunity status, at both individual and population levels. Hence,

65

antibody tests can be used for determining seroprevalences, examining vaccine responses

66

in study settings, or determining whether an individual needs a booster as in the case of

67

e.g. hepatitis B vaccine. With COVID-19, antibody testing may be the key in reaching the

68

diagnosis for a patient presenting when the viral RNA has already waned, e.g. with late

69

thromboembolic complications or prolonged symptoms2. The most widespread methods in

70

antibody detection are enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and lateral flow assays (LFAs); the

71

former tend to be highly specific and sensitive yet require dedicated infrastructure and

72

labor, and deliver the results at best within hours, whereas LFAs are simple and rapid but

73

may be of substandard diagnostic performance.

74

We have previously set up rapid homogeneous (wash-free) immunoassays utilizing time-

75

resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET)3-8. For FRET to occur, two

76

fluorophores, donor and acceptor, are brought to close proximity, allowing excitation of

77

the former to result in energy transfer to the latter, which then emits photons at a distinct

78

wavelength. The efficiency of FRET is inversely dependent on the distance between the

79

two fluorophores, with a 50 % efficiency typically achieved at 15 to 60 Å. To reduce

80

background from the notoriously autofluorescent biological samples, a chelated lanthanide

81

donor exhibiting long-lived fluorescence is employed, allowing for time-resolved

82

measurement (TR-FRET). We have developed a rapid homogeneous TR-FRET -based

83

immunoassay concept termed LFRET (protein L-based time-resolved Förster resonance

84

energy transfer immunoassay) and demonstrated its excellent diagnostic performance in

85

detection of antibodies against Puumala orthohantavirus nucleocapsid protein, Zika virus

86

NS1 and the autoantigen tissue transglutaminase (tTG) 5,7,8. LFRET relies on simultaneous

87

binding to the antibody of interest of its donor-labeled antigen and of an acceptor-labeled

88

protein L. If the patient’s serum contains antibodies against the antigen, they bring the two

89

fluorophores to close proximity, generating a TR-FRET signal that indicates the presence

90

of the specific antibodies. Interestingly, a recent report describes a TR-FRET based 1-hour

91

assay for separate detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of diffent immunoglobulin

92

isotypes9.

93

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped (+)ssRNA virus with a non-segmented 30 kb genome and

94

four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N).

95

Protruding from the viral surface are transmembrane homotrimers of S, essential for host

96

cell entry. The glycoprotein S is proteolytically cleaved into subunits S1 and S2, of which

97

S1 contains the host cell receptor-binding domain (RBD), while S2 mediates fusion with

98

the host cell membranes10. Like S, the E and M proteins are located on the viral envelope,

99

whereas N protein binds the viral RNA to form a ribonucleoprotein complex that is

100

encapsulated within the viral membrane.

101

Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 predominantly target the S and N proteins. In

102

hospitalized patients, the median time from onset of symptoms to IgA, IgM and IgG

103

seroconversion has been observed to be 11-14 days, with almost all individuals

104

seroconverting by day 2111-13. The antibody levels correlate with the severity of disease,

105

with few patients apparently not seroconverting12. Moreover, a fraction of the

106

seroconverters do not seem to generate detectable neutralizing antibodies 14. The

107

neutralizing antibody (NAb) response correlates with the presence of anti-S antibodies15,16,

108

with most but not all NAbs targeting the RBD17. IgG levels to other human

109

betacoronaviruses have been observed to peak within months of infection and to wane

110

within some years thereafter18,19. Moreover, reinfections with seasonal human

111

coronaviruses have been observed as early as 12 months from the previous infection20. As

112

for SARS-CoV-2, the persistence of antibodies and the extent to which these provide

113

protective immunity remains as of yet uncertain.

114

In this study we introduce rapid wash-free LFRET assays for detection of antibodies

115

against SARS-CoV-2 N and S antigens and compare them with ELISAs and

116

microneutralization.

Results

120

LFRET assays for SARS-CoV-2 S and N were set up using Eu-labeled in-house antigens

121

and AF-labeled protein L. First, the assay conditions were optimized separately for S and

122

N using three known anti-S/-N ELISA-positive and three known anti-S/-N ELISA-negative

123

samples (included in the full 129-sample panel). Thereafter the remaining 123 samples

124

were tested in the optimized conditions. For detection of both anti-S and anti-N antibodies

125

measurement at 7 minutes was found optimal.

126

Cutoffs for both anti-S and anti-N LFRET were set by measuring LFRET signals relative

127

to buffer in 48 samples tested negative by anti-S and anti-N ELISA. The average plus four

128

standard deviations (SD) was set as cutoff: 228.37 + 4 × 27.59 = 338.76 counts for anti-S

129

and 220.94 + 4 × 27.73 = 331.86 counts for anti-N LFRET.

130

Performances of the anti-S and anti-N LFRET assays were then determined with the 129

131

samples including 77 sera or heparin/EDTA plasmas from 44 individuals with a previous

132

RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, four samples from four individuals negative

133

for SARS-CoV-2 by both RT-PCR and serology, and 48 samples from individuals with a

134

comprehensively negative SARS-CoV-2 serology. The sensitivities and specificities of

135

SARS-CoV-2 anti-S and anti-N LFRET in detection of PCR-positive individuals were 87%

136

and 100% & 78% and 100%, respectively. The combined anti-S/-N LFRET sensitivity and

137

specificity were 90% and 100%: if either anti-S or -N LFRET was positive, the composite

138

result was considered positive (Table 1). The development of LFRET signals over time

139

among patients with follow-up samples available is shown in Figure S1.

140

ELISAs and microneutralization

141

In order to compare the performance of LFRET with classical serology, we tested the set

142

of samples described above with SARS-CoV-2 anti-S and anti-N IgA, IgM and IgG

143

ELISAs as well as SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization. The panel of seronegatives was

144

excluded from anti-N IgA and IgM as well as anti-S IgM ELISAs. Altogether 107 samples

145

underwent microneutralization, including 64 samples from RT-PCR positive patients and

146

43 seronegative samples. Microneutralization titers of ≥20 were considered positive.

147

The ELISA cutoffs were set at average plus four standard deviations of absorbances

148

measured from 14 serum samples from SARS-CoV-2 seronegative Department staff

149

members.

150

The sensitivities and specificities of ELISA for anti-S IgA, IgG and IgM in samples from

151

SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive individuals were 91% and 98%, 90% and 100% & 66%

152

and 100%, respectively. The corresponding sensitivities and specificities of anti-N ELISA

153

were 75% and 100% (IgA), 92% and 94% (IgG) & 16% and 100% (IgM), respectively

154

(Figure S2). Pearson correlation between anti-S and anti-N IgG ELISAs was 0.90, 0.79

155

between IgM ELISAs and 0.31 between IgA ELISAs.

156

Comparison of LFRET, ELISA and microneutralization

157

Comparison between the LFRET signals and ELISA absorbances is presented in Figure 2.

158

For anti-N antibodies, the correlation between LFRET and IgA or IgM ELISA results was

159

low (R=0.25 for IgA and R=0.13 for IgM). With IgG ELISA a stronger correlation of

160

R=0.62 was seen, apparently hampered by saturation of the ELISA signal. For anti-S-

161

antibodies, correlations between IgA, IgG and IgM ELISAs were R=0.52, R=0.62 and

162

R=0.56, respectively. Higher LFRET signals were seen in samples from patients with

163

severe disease, especially in anti-S LFRET and when samples taken less than two weeks

164

from onset were excluded (Figure S3). The agreement between anti-N ELISA and LFRET

165

was 88-89%, and that between anti-S ELISA and LFRET 96-98% (Table S1). The samples

166

representing discordance between PCR, LFRET and/or ELISA are detailed in Table S2.

167

The LFRET and ELISA results are compared with microneutralization titers in Figure 3.

168

Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (rho) between anti-S LFRET and MNT was 0.87,

169

whereas for anti-S IgG, IgA and IgM ELISAs it was 0.68, 0.86 and 0.81, respectively.

170

Likewise, between anti-N LFRET and MNT Spearman’s rho was 0.83, while 0.81, 0.69

171

and 0.61 for anti-N IgG, IgA and IgM ELISAs. Higher neutralization titers were observed

172

in samples from hospitalized individuals. Sensitivities and specificities of LFRET and

ELISA in correctly identifying microneutralization-positive and -negative samples are

174

shown in Table S3.

175

Receiver operating characteristic analysis

176

We also rated the performances of both LFRET assays using receiver operating

177

characteristic (ROC) curves (Figure S4). The curves were plotted in RStudio (version

178

1.3.1073) with the ROCR library (version 1.0-11). With the assumption that a positive

179

result in either IgM, IgG or IgA ELISA for a given sample signifies ‘true’ positivity, the

180

respective areas under the curve (AUCs) for both anti-N and anti-S LFRET assays were

181

very high, 0.94 and 0.97.

Discussion

185

antibodies for identification of individuals exhibiting an immune response against SARS-

186

CoV-2. Management of both COVID-19 patients and the ongoing pandemic at the

187

population level calls for accurate diagnostic tools applicable in various settings, including

188

resource poor areas without central laboratory facilities. Antibody assays allow detection

189

of individuals past the initial infection phase as well as assessment of a possible vaccine

190

response.

191

We have previously applied LFRET to diagnostics of viral and autoimmune diseases. Here,

192

we further reduced the incubation time from the prior 20-30 to 7 minutes without

193

compromising sensitivity or specificity. The simple, rapid ‘mix and read’ workflow of the

194

assay could allow faster turnaround time from sample arrival to results as well as higher

195

throughput compared to the currently popular EIAs. Moreover, the ease and speed of

196

performing LFRET makes it more feasible for use in diverse enviroments, including point-

197

of-care and limited-resource settings.

198

Combined anti-S/-N LFRET (i.e. if either assay is positive, the composite result is positive)

199

was equal to anti-S IgG ELISA in terms of sensitivity (90%) and specificity (100%) in

200

identification of RT-PCR -positive individuals (Table 1). Considering that the median time

201

from symptom onset to seroconversion is 1-2 weeks for SARS-CoV-211-13, we can better

202

assess the sensitivities of these assays by excluding samples taken before two weeks from

203

symptom onset. Excluding these samples, the sensitivities of anti-S, anti-N and anti-S/-N

204

LFRET are 95%, 80% and 95%, respectively. Simultaneously, the sensitivities of anti-S/-

205

N IgG ELISAs increase to 97%, 100% and 100%. Combining sensitivity and specificity

206

into a single value, the AUCs of anti-N and -S LFRET assays – 0.94 and 0.97 – reflect

207

excellent performance (Figure S4).

208

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels are higher in patients with severe clinical

209

presentation12,15. Also in our study the LFRET signals of hospitalized patients exceeded

210

those of non-hospitalized yet PCR-positive individuals (Figures 2 and S3). In the

211

hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the sensitivity of both anti-S and anti-N LFRET increased

We set up rapid LFRET immunoassays for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S and N

212

to 100% by two weeks from symptom onset (Table 1), importantly for clinical use. In

213

follow-up, the LFRET signals first showed a rapid rise within three weeks from onset and

214

thereafter plateaued or slowly declined (Figure S1).

215

The agreement between ELISA and LFRET was high: ~90% for anti-N -antibodies and

216

>95% for anti-S -antibodies (Table S1). With the anti-N and anti-S LFRET vs. IgG ELISA

217

results combined, the overall agreement between the methods in the entire study material

218

was 94% (124/129 samples). A closer look at the discordance (Table S2) shows three

219

samples (65, 72 and 86) from PCR-positive individuals who remained seronegative in both

220

LFRET and ELISA, likely due to early sampling (Figure S1). Four samples (71, 70, 7 and

221

24) were negative in LFRET but positive in PCR and ELISA: The first two were early

222

infection specimens (taken 8 and 13 days post onset of symptoms) positive in anti-N IgA

223

ELISA, suggestive of early IgA seroconversion, a phenomenon observed previously21. The

224

other two were taken 4 and 9 weeks after onset from non-hospitalized patients positive in

225

anti-S and -N IgG and/or IgA ELISAs. These ELISA reactivities were weak (Figure 2e),

226

suggesting that the negativity in LFRET might reflect lower analytical sensitivity. Two

227

samples (82, 92) were negative in LFRET and RT-PCR but positive in anti-N IgG ELISA.

228

Additionally, two samples (103, 121) were negative in LFRET and MNT, but positive in

229

either anti-N IgG ELISA or anti-S IgA ELISA. No false positives were observed in

230

LFRET.

231

In microneutralization, all but one of the reactive samples were also positive in anti-S

232

LFRET, IgG and IgA ELISA and anti-N IgG ELISA (Figure 3), the exception being an

233

ICU patient sampled 13 days after onset with an MNT titer of 20 and a positive anti-N IgA

234

ELISA (Table S2, sample 70). Some of the studied individuals who seroconverted did not

235

exhibit a detectable neutralizing antibody response, as observed previously14. Interestingly,

236

the specificities of the LFRET assays in identification of the non-neutralizing individuals

237

as negatives (91% for S and 96% for N) were higher than those of IgG ELISAs (87% for

238

S and 82% for N) (Table S3). This may be due to lower analytical sensitivity of LFRET,

239

as the undetectable neutralization could result from lower overall levels of anti-SARS-

240

CoV-2 antibodies in the LFRET-negative but ELISA-positive samples. Nevertheless,

241

among the assays evaluated, anti-S LFRET demonstrated the best overall performance in

242

identification of samples containing neutralizing antibodies, with a sensitivity of 98% and

243

a specificity of 91%.

244

Our study has some limitations. First, our SARS-CoV-2 -positive samples originated from

245

symptomatic patients. Individuals with asymptomatic infection may mount a significantly

246

lower antibody response22, whereby the sensitivity of LFRET in such individuals might be

247

lower. A second limitation is that antibodies against other coronaviruses, especially the

248

widely circulating OC43, HKU1, NL63 and 229E, were not examined. Those antibodies

249

potentially cross-reacting in the SARS-CoV-2 assay could reduce its specificity. However,

250

the RT-PCR and neutralization results strongly indicate that the observed antibody

251

responses were SARS-CoV-2-specific.

252

In conclusion, this study demonstrates the applicability of the LFRET approach to

253

detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. While in sensitivity and specificity the assay

254

appears to parallel ELISA, the new assay is as easy and rapid to perform as an LFA,

255

requiring only combination of the diluted sample with a reagent mix and reading the

256

result after 7 minutes. In prediction of neutralization capacity, the anti-S LFRET

257

outperformed ELISA in specificity, at equal sensitivity.

Nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 was done from nasopharyngeal swab samples with

271

either the Cobas® SARS-CoV-2 test using the Cobas® 6800 system (Roche Diagnostics,

272

Basel, Switzerland), a protocol based on one previously described by Corman et al. 23, or

273

the Amplidiag® COVID-19 test (Mobidiag, Espoo, Finland).

274

Molecular cloning

275

For protein expression, we acquired the ZeoCassette Vector (pCMV/Zeo) from

276

ThermoFisher Scientific, and excised the Zeocin resistance gene from the vector using

277

FastDigest EcoRI and XhoI (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s

278

protocol. The excised gene was agarose gel purified, blunted using T4 DNA polymerase

279

(ThermoFisher Scientific), and purified using Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) both

280

following the manufacturer's protocol. The selection gene was inserted into

281

pCAGGS/MCS and to the pCAGGS vector bearing SARS-CoV-2 S protein (described in

282

24,25

283

according to manufacturer’s protocol, followed by blunting and purifications as above. The

284

insert was ligated to the plasmids using T4 DNA ligase (ThermoFisher Scientific)

285

according to manufacturer’s protocol, the ligation products transformed into Escherichia

286

ampicillin and 50 µg/ml Zeocin (ThermoFisher Scientific). After overnight incubation at

288

37 °C, single colonies were picked and grown in 5 ml of 2xYT medium supplemented with

289

100 µg/ml of ampicillin and 50 µg/ml Zeocin overnight at 37 °C. The plasmids were

290

purified using GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific), and plasmids

291

bearing the insert identified by restriction digestion (FastDigest EcoRI, ThermoFisher

292

Scientific) and agarose gel electrophoresis. For both constructs, clones with the insert in

293

reverse and forward direction were selected for ZymoPURE II Plasmid Maxiprep Kit

294

(ZymoResearch) preparations done following manufacturer’s guidelines. A synthetic

295

SARS-CoV-2

296

MMRPIVLVLLFATSALA flanked by KpnI and SgsI restriction sites was obtained from

297

ThermoFisher Scientific. The SARS-CoV-2 NP cassette was subcloned into

298

pCAGGS/MCS-Zeo-fwd vector and plasmid maxipreps prepared as described above.

299

Protein expression and purification

300

We initially attempted producing SARS-CoV-2 S protein in Expi293F cells utilizing the

301

Expi293 Expression System (ThermoFisher Scientific). Briefly, the pCAGGS plasmid

302

bearing codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 spike24 was transiently transfected into Expi293F

303

cells as advised24,25, except that we used spinner flasks (disposable 125 ml spinner flask,

304

Corning) for the culture. Protein purification from supernatants collected at five days post

305

transfection followed the protocol described25 and yielded 0.2-0.3 mg per 100 ml culture,

306

in line with earlier reports24,25.

307

Next, we transfected adherent HEK293T cells with pCAGGS-SARS-CoV-S-Zeo plasmids

308

using Fugene HD at 3.5:1 ratio, in suspension as described 26. The transfected cells were

309

plated onto six-well plates, and at 48 h post transfection subjected to Zeocin selection, 150

310

µg/ml Zeocin in high glucose DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium, Sigma)

311

supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 4 mM L-glutamine. Two days after

312

initiating the selection, the cells were trypsinized and transferred into fresh wells, with

313

fresh media and antibiotics provided at 2 to 3 day intervals. Once confluent, the cells were

314

trypsinized, counted (TC20 cell counter, Bio-Rad), diluted to ~30 cells/ml, and dispensed

315

onto 96-well plates, 100 µl per well. After confluency, we switched to serum-free FreeStyle

316

293 Expression Medium (ThermoFisher Scientific) with 100 µg/ml Zeocin, and incubated

317

the cells at 37 °C 5% CO2. At 48 h, we analyzed the medium for the presence of SARS-

318

CoV-2 S protein by dot blotting, briefly 2.5 µl of the supernatant was dried onto a

319

nitrocellulose membrane, the membrane blocked (3% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline

320

with 0.05% Tween-20), washed, probed with rabbit anti-RBD (Sino Biological, 40592-

321

T62), washed, probed with anti-rabbit IRDye800 (LI-COR Biosciences), washed, and read

322

using Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). The clone with the highest

323

amount of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in the cell culture supernatant, HEK293T-spike-D5, was

324

then expanded in DMEM with 5% FBS, 4 mM L-glutamine and 100 µg/ml Zeocin, and

325

ampouled for storage in liquid nitrogen. We adapted the HEK293T-spike-D5 cells for

326

suspension culture by placing trypsinized cells into a spinner flask with Expi293

327

Expression Medium (ThermoFisher Scientific) with 100 µg/ml of Zeocin. We stored an

328

aliquot of the adapted cells in liquid nitrogen and tested their ability to produce SARS-

329

CoV-2 S protein in both Expi293 and FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium (both

330

ThermoFisher Scientific). Having been cultured in the spinner flask for 5 to 8 days, the

331

cells reached a density of >3 × 106 cells/ml. The protein from the supernatants was purified

332

using the protocol described25, with yields of 0.8-1.2 mg per 100 ml culture.

333

For production of SARS-CoV-2 N protein, we transfected Expi293F cells with pCAGGS-

334

SARS-CoV-2-NP-Zeo using Fugene HD, briefly, 100 µg of the plasmid diluted into 10 ml

335

of OptiMEM (Sigma), 350 µl of Fugene HD added followed by mixing and 15 min

336

incubation at room temperature, after which the plasmid mix was added onto Expi293F

337

cells in Expi293 Expression Medium at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. The incubation of the transfected

338

cells was continued for four days, after which the supernatant was collected, and the protein

339

purified (yield approximately 1 mg per 100 ml culture) as described for S protein25. The

340

remaining cells were treated with 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Sigma) to remove dead cells, and

341

after two washes were put back into the spinner flask with fresh Expi293 Expression

342

Medium supplemented with 100 µg/ml of Zeocin. Eventually a population of cells started

343

to proliferate (Expi-NP-zeo cells), and were aliquoted in liquid nitrogen. The protein

344

production and purification occurred as described above with yields of ~1 mg per 100 ml

345

culture.

347

We labeled the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins with the donor fluorophore europium (Eu)

348

using QuickAllAssay Eu-chelated protein labeling kit (BN Products and Services Oy)

349

according to the manufacturer’s instructions to generate Eu-labeled S (Eu-S) and N (Eu-

350

N). We also labeled recombinant protein L (Thermo Scientific) with the acceptor

351

fluorophore Alexa Fluor 647 to generate AF647-labeled protein L (AF-L), as reported5.

352

IgG-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc.

353

TR-FRET assays

354

The LFRET assay was done as described5 and as briefly illustrated by the flowchart in

355

Figure 1. For calculating the relative TR-FRET signal increase, we here replace the pool

356

of negative sera with TBS-BSA (50mM Tris-HCl, 150mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.2% BSA). To

357

establish LFRET assays for S and N, we optimized the component concentrations by cross-

358

titration using three positive and three negative serum samples. For detection of anti-N

359

antibodies, we found the optimal on-plate dilution for serum to be 1/25, and the optimal

360

on-plate concentrations for AF-L and Eu-N to be 500 nM and 5 nM, respectively. For

361

detection of anti-S antibodies, we found an on-plate dilution of 1/100 for serum, AF-L

362

concentration of 250 nM and Eu-S concentration of 5 nM optimal. We measured TR-FRET

363

at 0, 7, 15, 22, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after combining the reagents. TR-FRET counts were

364

measured with Wallac Victor2 fluorometer (PerkinElmer) and normalized as described3.

365

Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)

366

We set up the SARS-CoV-2 S protein ELISA as described25 with the following

367

amendments. We coated the plates (ThermoScientific NUNC-immuno 446442 polysorp

368

lockwell C8) with 50 ul/well of antigens diluted 1 µg/ml into 50 mM carbonate-bicarbonate

369

buffer pH 9.6 (Medicago AB) and used 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA Substrate Solution

370

(ThermoFisher Scientific). As secondary antibodies we made use of polyclonal rabbit anti-

371

human IgA-horeseradish peroxidase (HRP), -IgM-HRP, and -IgG-HRP (all from Dako) at

372

respective dilutions of 1:5000, 1:1500, and 1:6000. The colorimetric reaction was

373

terminated by addition to 0.5 M sulphuric acid (Fluka), and the absorbances recorded

374

(HIDEX Sense) at 450 nm. The N protein ELISA followed the same protocol.

376

For the SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization assay we first cultured Vero E6 cells on 96-

377

well plates (Thermo Scientific) overnight at +37°C in 2% MEM (Eagle Minimum

378

Essential Media [Sigma-Aldrich] supplemented with 2% inactivated fetal bovine serum

379

[Thermo Scientific], 2 mM L-glutamine [Thermo Scientific], 100 units penicillin, and

380

100 µg/ml streptomycin [Sigma-Aldrich]). The following day we made a two-fold

381

dilution series (1:20 to 1:1280) of the serum samples in 2% MEM and combined 50 µl of

382

each dilution with 50 µl of virus (1000 plaque forming units (pfu)/ml in 2% MEM). The

383

serum-virus mixes were kept for 1h at +37°C. The cells were inoculated with the serum-

384

virus mixes and grown in incubators at +37°C. After 4 days, the cultures were fixed with

385

formalin, stained with crystal violet and the neutralization titers recorded.
