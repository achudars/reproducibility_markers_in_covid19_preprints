Abstract
Background: This study aimed to estimate the age-stratified and overall morbidity and mortality
rates of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection based on
an analysis of the pervasive SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Qatar, a country with <9% of the
population being ≥50 years of age.
Methods: Infection disease outcomes were investigated using a Bayesian approach applied to an
age-structured mathematical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease
progression in the population. The model was fitted to infection and disease time-series and agestratified data. Two separate criteria for classifying morbidity were used: one based on actual
recorded hospital admission (acute-care or intensive-care-unit hospitalization) and one based on
clinical presentation as per World Health Organization classification of disease severity or
criticality.
Results: All outcomes showed very strong age dependence, with low values for those <50 years
of age, but rapidly growing rates for those ≥50 years of age. The strong age dependence was
particularly pronounced for infection criticality rate and infection fatality rate. Infection acutecare and intensive-care-unit bed hospitalization rates were estimated at 13.10 (95% CI: 12.8213.24) and 1.60 (95% CI: 1.58-1.61) per 1,000 infections, respectively. Infection severity and
criticality rates were estimated at 3.06 (95% CI: 3.01-3.10) and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.67-0.68) per
1,000 infections, respectively. Infection fatality rate was estimated at 1.85 (95% CI: 1.74-1.95)
per 10,000 infections.
Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 severity and fatality in Qatar was not high and demonstrated a very
strong age dependence with <4 infections in every 1,000 being severe or critical and <2 in every

Introduction
The pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
infection and associated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) continue to be a global health
challenge [1]. Aside from direct implications on morbidity and mortality [1], the pandemic led to
severe economic and societal disruptions [2], a consequence of the social and physical distancing
restrictions imposed to slow SARS-CoV-2 transmission in view of its severity and fatality. Had
infection severity and fatality been comparable to those of seasonal influenza or other common
cold coronaviruses, such restrictions may not have been deemed necessary.
One of the most affected countries by this pandemic is Qatar, a peninsula in the Arabian Gulf
region with a population of 2.8 million [3, 4]. With its unique demographic and residential
dwelling structure where 60% of the population are expatriate craft and manual workers
(CMWs) living in large shared housing accommodations [3, 4], Qatar experienced a pervasive
epidemic with >60,000 laboratory-confirmed infections per million population as of November
23, 2020 [5, 6]. The epidemic grew rapidly starting from March 2020, peaked in late May 2020,
then rapidly declined in subsequent weeks, and has been in a stable low-incidence phase now for
four months (Figure S1 of Supplementary Material (SM)). A series of serological studies
completed by November 23, 2020 suggested that about half of the population have already been
infected [5, 7-10].
With a well-resourced public healthcare structure and a centralized and standardized data-capture
system for all SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-19 care, Qatar has one of the most extensive
databases to characterize this epidemic and its toll [5]. In addition to large-scale polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) and serological testing, multiple population-based PCR and serological
surveys have been conducted to date [5, 7-9]. As of November 23, 2020, cumulative overall

testing rates exceeded 638,000 per million population for PCR and 105,000 per million
population for antibodies [11]. A comprehensive clinical characterization has also been
completed for the hospitalized COVID-19 cases through individual chart reviews by trained
medical personnel [11], including infection severity classification as per the World Health
Organization (WHO) guidelines [12].
Given the pervasive and advanced nature of the epidemic and availability of extensive
epidemiological data, Qatar provides a unique opportunity to assess the extent of SARS-CoV-2
morbidity and fatality. We aimed in this study to estimate the age-stratified and overall infection
acute-care and intensive-care-unit (ICU) hospitalization rates, infection severity and criticality
rates, and infection fatality rate.
Methods
Mathematical model and parameterization
Building on our previously developed SARS-CoV-2 models [5, 13-17], an age-structured
deterministic mathematical model was constructed to describe SARS-CoV-2 transmission
dynamics and disease progression in the population (Figure S2 of SM). Susceptible individuals
in each age group were at risk of acquiring the infection based on their infectious contact rate per
day, age-specific susceptibility to the infection, and an age-mixing matrix defining mixing
between individuals in the different age groups. Following a latency period, infected individuals
developed an infection that either did not require hospitalization, or that required hospitalization
in an acute-care bed or in an ICU bed. Individuals admitted to an ICU bed had an additional risk
for COVID-19 mortality. The model further included compartments tracking infection severity
(asymptomatic/moderate/mild infection, severe infection, or critical infection as per WHO

severity classification) [12]. Population movement between model compartments was described
using a set of coupled nonlinear differential equations (Text S1 of SM).
The model was parameterized using best available data for SARS-CoV-2 natural history and
epidemiology. Model parameters, definitions, and justifications can be found in Tables S1 and
S2 of SM. The size and demographic structure of the population of Qatar were based on a
population census conducted by Qatar’s Planning and Statistics Authority [4].
Model fitting and analyses
The model was fitted to extensive time-series and age-stratified data for PCR laboratoryconfirmed infections, PCR testing positivity rate, antibody testing positivity rate, PCR and
serological surveys, daily hospital admissions in acute-care and ICU beds, hospital occupancy in
acute-care and ICU beds, incidence of severe and critical infections as per WHO classification
[12], and COVID-19 deaths (further details in Text S2 of SM). A Bayesian method, based on the
incremental mixture importance sampling with shot-gun optimization [18, 19], was used to fit
the model to the different data sources and to estimate the mean and 95% credible interval (CI)
for each estimated parameter (Text S2 of SM). The model was coded, fitted, and analyzed using
MATLAB R2019a [20].
Outcome measures
Table 1 provides a listing of each outcome measure estimated in this study, its definition, and its
interpretation. Two sets of outcome measures were generated. The first set includes crude case
rates, such as the crude case fatality rate, calculated as the cumulative number of a disease
outcome (say COVID-19 death) over the cumulative number of documented (that is PCR
laboratory-confirmed) infections.

The second set includes infection rates, such as the infection fatality rate, calculated as the
cumulative number of a disease outcome (say COVID-19 death) over the model-estimated
cumulative number of infections, documented and undocumented.
Two separate criteria for classifying morbidity were used: one based on actual recorded hospital
admission (acute-care or ICU) and one based on clinical presentation as per WHO classification
of disease severity [12]. While the two are overlapping with severe cases typically admitted to
acute-care beds, and critically ill cases admitted to ICU beds, a significant fraction of mild or
moderately ill cases were hospitalized out of caution. Moreover, hospitalization was used as a
form of case isolation earlier in the epidemic. Of note that the health system in Qatar remained
well within its threshold even at the epidemic peak towards end of May 2020.
Results
Figure 1A shows the crude case acute-care and ICU bed hospitalization rate versus time. The
rate was rather stable, but with a slightly declining trend, and was assessed at 113.9 acute-care
and/or ICU hospital admissions per 1,000 laboratory-confirmed infections on November 22,
2020. As of this date, a total of 18,509 acute-care and 1,759 ICU hospital admissions had been
registered.
Figure 1B shows the crude case severity and criticality rate versus time. The rate was rather
stable, but with a slightly declining trend, and was assessed at 28.0 severe and/or critical cases
per 1,000 laboratory-confirmed infections on November 22, 2020. As of this date, a total of
4,127 severe and 863 critical infections had been registered.
Figure 1C shows the crude case fatality rate versus time. The rate increased over time, as
expected with the weeks-long delay between infection and eventual COVID-19 death, but then

stabilized as the epidemic entered its low but stable infection incidence phase (Figure S1 of SM).
The rate was assessed at 13.2 deaths per 10,000 laboratory-confirmed infections on November
22, 2020. As of this date, a total of 235 COVID-19 deaths had been registered.
The model produced robust fits to each dataset. Table S3 of SM summarizes the goodness-of-fit.
Figures S3-S7 of SM show the age-specific posterior distributions of the infection acute-care bed
hospitalization rate (Figure S3), infection ICU bed hospitalization rate (Figure S4), infection
severity rate (Figure S5), infection criticality rate (Figure S6), and infection fatality rate (Figure
S7). Meanwhile, Figures S8-S9 of SM show the overall (total population of all age groups)
infection acute-care bed hospitalization rate (Figure S8A), infection ICU bed hospitalization rate
(Figure S8B), infection severity rate (Figure S8C), infection criticality rate (Figure S8D), and
infection fatality rate (Figure S9).
Table 2, Figure 2, and Figure 3A show the estimated mean and 95% CI of all age-specific
infection rate measures. All rates showed very strong age dependence. Measures increased
steadily with age, with low values for those <50 years of age, but very rapidly growing rates for
those ≥50 years of age. The strong age dependence was even more pronounced for infection ICU
bed hospitalization rate (Figure 2B), infection criticality rate (Figure 2D), and infection fatality
rate (Figure 3A).
The overall (total population of all age groups) infection acute-care bed hospitalization rate was
estimated at 13.10 (95% CI: 12.82-13.24) per 1,000 infections, infection ICU bed hospitalization
rate at 1.60 (95% CI: 1.58-1.61) per 1,000 infections, infection severity rate at 3.06 (95% CI:
3.01-3.10) per 1,000 infections, infection criticality rate at 0.68 (95% CI: 0.67-0.68) per 1,000
infections, and infection fatality rate at 1.85 (95% CI: 1.74-1.95) per 10,000 infections.

Figure 1D shows the infection acute-care and ICU bed hospitalization rate versus time. The rate
increased over time, as expected with the delay between infection and hospital admission, but
then stabilized (Figure 1D) as the epidemic peaked and started to decline (Figure S1 of SM). The
rate was assessed at 13.8 hospital admissions per 1,000 infections on November 22, 2020. A
similar pattern was found for the infection severity and criticality rate (Figure 1E) and infection
fatality rate (Figure 1F), which were assessed at 3.4 cases per 1,000 infections and 1.6 deaths per
10,000 infections, respectively, on November 22, 2020.
The study generated other relevant estimates. The diagnosis (detection) rate as of November 22,
2020, that is the proportion of infections that were documented (with PCR laboratory-confirmed
diagnosis) out of all infections that were estimated to have occurred, was assessed at 12.1%
(95% CI: 12.0-12.1%). The mean duration of acute-care hospitalization was estimated at 8.73
(95% CI: 8.62-8.83) days and the mean duration of ICU hospitalization was estimated at 12.30
(95% CI: 12.18-12.41) days.
Discussion
The striking finding of this study is that SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality demonstrated a
very strong age dependence. Infection severity, criticality, and fatality increased very rapidly
with age. This was particularly the case for infection criticality and fatality which were limited
for those <50 years of age but increased very rapidly for those ≥50 years of age (Figures 2-3).
This strong age dependence combined with the lower infection exposure in those ≥60 years of
age (Figure S10 of SM) and the small proportion of the population ≥50 years of age (9%) and
≥60 years of age (2%), all contributed together to a low morbidity and mortality in Qatar. Out of
every 1,000 infections, only 3.7 infections were destined to be severe or critical, and out of every
10,000 infections, only 1.9 infections were destined to end in COVID-19 death (Table 2).

Notably, both SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality in Qatar were not much higher than those
typically seen in a seasonal influenza epidemic in the United States [21, 22]. This fact, however,
needs to be interpreted in context. With the young age structure of the population in Qatar, a
seasonal influenza epidemic in this country has a much lower severity than that in the United
States. Typically, only a handful of influenza-related deaths are reported every year in Qatar
[23].
Other lines of evidence support these findings. In a survey of ten CMW communities in Qatar,
only five severe infections and one critical infection ever occurred in 3,233 persons with
confirmed infection (antibody and/or PCR positive result), that is an infection severity and
criticality rate of 2.5 (95% CI: 1.1-4.9) per 1,000 infections [7]. In another nationwide survey of
the CMW population, only seven severe infections and one critical infection ever occurred in
1,590 persons with antibody and/or PCR positive result, an infection severity and criticality rate
of 5.0 (95% CI: 2.2-9.9) per 1,000 infections [8]. Both of these estimates are in agreement with
the present study estimate of 3.7 (95% CI: 3.7-3.8) per 1,000 infections.
These figures, however, are substantially lower than those estimated elsewhere, often using early
epidemic data [24-29]. The fact that the early phases of the epidemic in Europe and the United
States heavily affected nursing facilities and care homes of the elderly may have biased the
estimates to higher values. It is also possible that our estimates are lower because of the robust
accounting of the large pool of undocumented infections in the present study, thanks to the series
of serological surveys conducted in Qatar [5, 7-10]. These surveys provided some of the key
input data for this modeling study. For instance, the nationwide survey of the CMW population
found that only 9.3% (95% CI: 7.9-11.0%) of those antibody positive had a prior documented
PCR laboratory-confirmed infection [8]. This is in agreement with the diagnosis (detection) rate

estimated here at 12.1% (95% CI: 12.0-12.1%), as well as growing evidence from other countries
indicating that only one in every 10 infections was ever diagnosed [24, 30-33]. The totality of
evidence on the Qatar epidemic also indicates that most infections were asymptomatic or
minimally mild to be diagnosed [5-9, 34-36]. For instance, a national SARS-CoV-2 PCR survey
found that 58.5% of those testing PCR positive reported no symptoms within the preceding two
weeks of the survey [5].
In light of these findings, it is evident that the strong age dependence of SARS-CoV-2 morbidity
and mortality is a principal contributor to the low morbidity and mortality seen in Qatar
compared to elsewhere. The impact of this strong age dependence is illustrated in Figure 3B
where the age-specific infection fatality rate of Table 2 has been applied to the age structure of
other national populations. The infection fatality rate in Italy was found to be 10-fold higher than
that in Qatar, only because of the population’s different age structure. These findings indicate
that the infection morbidity and mortality may vary immensely across countries, and will be
substantially lower in countries with younger demographic structures, as suggested earlier [13].
While age appears to be the principal factor, other factors could have also contributed to
explaining the low morbidity and mortality in Qatar. Growing evidence indicates T cell and
antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in unexposed individuals [37-40], that probably reflects
development of T cell and antibody immune memory to circulating ‘common cold’
coronaviruses, which may have in turn led to lower morbidity and mortality [37-40]. The sharedhousing dwelling structure in Qatar that contributed to the large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic [5] may
have, along with the frequent international travel of Qatar’s expatriate population, also
contributed to higher levels of exposure to other common cold coronaviruses [41, 42], thereby
inducing high levels of broadly cross-reactive T cell and antibody responses. Such pre-existing

immune reactivity [37-40] may have thus resulted in lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and
mortality in the population of Qatar.
The resourced healthcare system, which was well below its threshold even at the epidemic peak,
may have also contributed to the low observed morbidity and mortality. Emphasis on proactive
early treatment, in addition to a cautious approach for SARS-CoV-2 case management, may have
limited the number of people who went on to require hospitalization, or to develop severe or
critical disease.
Limitations may have affected this study. We estimated rates of infection morbidity and
mortality, not accounting for potential differences by sex, comorbidities, or other factors. Model
estimations are contingent on the validity and generalizability of input data. Available input data
were most complete at the national level, and although there could be subpopulation differences
in the highly diverse population of Qatar, these could not be factored in the model given
insufficient data at the subpopulation level. Despite these limitations, our model, tailored to the
complexity of the epidemic in Qatar, was able to reproduce the observed epidemic trends, and
provided profound insights about healthcare needs and infection morbidity and mortality.
In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality demonstrate a strikingly strong age
dependence. With its young population structure, both morbidity and mortality were low in
Qatar, and not much higher than those typically seen in a seasonal influenza epidemic in the
United States [21, 22]. Out of every 1,000 infections, only 3.7 infections were severe or critical,
and out of every 10,000 infections, only 1.9 infections were fatal. However, these rates would
have been much higher if the population of Qatar had a similar demographic structure to that
found in Europe or the United States. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and

mortality may vary immensely by country or region, and that the pandemic expansion in nations
with young populations may lead to much milder disease burden than currently believed.

Text S1. Mathematical model structure and description
We constructed an age-structured deterministic mathematical model to describe the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission dynamics and disease
progression in the population of Qatar (Figure S1). The model stratified the population into
compartments according to age group (0-9, 10-19, 20-29,…, ≥80 years), infection stage (does not
require hospitalization, requires acute-care hospitalization, requires intensive care unit (ICU)
hospitalization), and hospitalization stage (acute-care hospitalization, ICU hospitalization). The
model also includes five tracking compartments to track infection severity
(asymptomatic/moderate/mild infection, severe infection, severe disease, critical infection,
critical disease per World Health Organization (WHO) severity classification [1]). The model
extends our earlier mathematical models developed to characterize SARS-CoV-2 epidemics [25].
Epidemic dynamics were described using age-specific sets of coupled nonlinear differential
equations. Each age group, a , denoted a ten-year age band apart from the last category which
grouped together all individuals ≥80 years of age. Qatar’s population size and demographic
structure were based on findings of “The Simplified Census of Population, Housing, and
Establishments” conducted by Qatar’s Planning and Statistics Authority [6]. Life expectancy was
obtained from the United Nations World Population Prospects database [7].

Justification
Based on existing estimate [8] and based on a
median incubation period of 5.1 days [9]
adjusted by observed viral load among infected
persons [10] and reported transmission before
onset of symptoms [11]
Based on existing estimate [8] and based on
observed time to recovery among persons with

The model was fitted to extensive sources of data thanks to the centralized and standardized
databases of SARS-CoV-2 testing, infection, COVID-19 disease, hospitalization, and severity as
well as to findings of ongoing epidemiologic studies in Qatar. Data included: 1) time-series of
number of PCR laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, 2) distribution of PCR
laboratory-confirmed infections by age group, 3) time-series of SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing
positivity rate, 4) fraction of PCR laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected persons aged >60
years old, 5) a series of PCR and serological surveys, 6) age-distribution of SARS-CoV-2
antibody positivity, 7) time-series of new/daily hospital admissions in acute-care beds and in
ICU beds, 8) age distribution of hospital admissions in acute-care beds and in ICU beds, 9)
fraction of individuals admitted to ICU beds from acute-care beds, 10) time-series of current

infections and critical infections per WHO infection severity classification [1], 12) age
distribution of severe and critical infections per WHO infection severity classification [1], 13)
time series of COVID-19 deaths, and 14) age distribution of COVID-19 deaths.
A Bayesian method, based on incremental mixture importance sampling with shotgun
optimization [14, 15], was used to conduct the model fitting and generate posteriors and credible
sets. In the first stage (initialization), the importance sampling distribution was initialized by
drawing a large number of points from the prior distribution and weights were attached to each
point using their respective log-likelihood.
In the second stage (shot-gun optimization), multiple sequential optimizations were carried out.
In each of these, the point of the importance sampling distribution with the maximum weight was
computed, and a new sample set was drawn from a Gaussian distribution centered at this point.
The local maximum of this sample set (point with largest log-likelihood) was then identified.
The importance sampling distribution was then updated to exclude the points that are farthest
from this local maximum in terms of Mahalanobis distance. A new sample set was then drawn
from a Gaussian distribution centered at the current local maximum and was added to the
importance sampling distribution. At the end of the shot-gun optimization stage, a candidate
importance sampling distribution was obtained.
In the third stage (importance sampling), weights were attached to each point in the importance
sampling distribution and sampling was iterated until convergence in the distribution of the
importance sampling distribution. In the fourth stage (resampling), points were resampled from
the importance sampling distribution to construct the posterior distribution of each estimated
parameter.
