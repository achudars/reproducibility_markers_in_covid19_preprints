Key Points
Question What are the risk factors for severe patients with corona virus disease 2019
(COVID-19)?
Findings First in this review and meta-analysis, we found that elderly male patients
with a high body mass index, high breathing rate and a combination of underlying
diseases were more likely to develop into critically ill patients. second, compared with
ordinary patients, severe patients had more significant symptom such as fever and
dyspnea. Last, we also found that the laboratory test results of severe patients had
more abnormal than non-severe patients.
Meaning This review summaried the risk factors of severe COVID-19 patients and
aim to provide a basis for early identification of severe patients by clinicians.

Abstract:
Importance: With the increasing number of infections for COVID-19, the global
health resources are deficient. At present, we don't have specific medicines or
vaccines against novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) and our assessment of risk
factors for patients with severe pneumonia was limited. In order to maximize the use
of limited medical resources, we should distinguish between mild and severe patients
as early as possible.
Objective: To systematically review the evidence of risk factors for severe corona
virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.
Evidence Review: We conducted a comprehensive search for primary literature in

both Chinese and English electronic bibliographic data bases including China
National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, Weipu, Chinese Biomedicine
Literature Database (CBM-SinoMed), MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE,
Cochrane Central Register, and Web of science. The American agency for health
research and quality (AHRQ) tool were used for assessing risk of bias. Mata-analysis
was undertaken using STATA version 15.0.
Results: 20 articles (N=4062 participants) were eligible for this systematic review
and meta-analysis. First in this review and meta-analysis, we found that elderly male
patients with a high body mass index, high breathing rate and a combination of
underlying diseases (such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) were more likely to develop into critically ill
patients. second, compared with ordinary patients, severe patients had more
significant symptom such as fever and dyspnea. Besides, the laboratory test results of
severe patients had more abnormal than non-severe patients, such as the elevated
levels of white-cell counts, liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase,
c-reactive protein and procalcitonin, etc, while the decreased levels of lymphocytes
and albumin, etc.
Interpretation: This is the first systematic review investigating the risk factors for
severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. The findings are presented
and discussed by different clinical characteristics. Therefore, our review may provide
guidance for clinical decision-making and optimizes resource allocation.

Introduction:
In December 2019, COVID-19 was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China[1].
On January 7, 2020, the causative agent was identified as a 2019 novel coronavirus
(2019-nCoV)[2-4]. According to the WHO report[5], as of 10:00 on March 23, 2020, a
total of 334,695 confirmed cases and 14,526 deaths were reported in 140 countries
and regions worldwide. While the epidemic in China is gradually under control,
Europe and the Middle East have shown the signs of rapid spread. For example, Italy,
Iran, Germany, Spain, the United States, South Korea and Japan have seen a sharp
increase in the number of infections[5].
Nowadays, with the increasing number of infections, the global health resources
are extremely poor. In order to maximize the use of limited medical resources, we
should distinguish between mild and severe patients as early as possible. At present,
we don't have specific medicines or vaccines against novel coronavirus pneumonia
(NCP) and our assessment of risk factors for patients with severe pneumonia was
limited. In this regard, we have summarized the published studies with critically ill
patients aimed at explaining the risk factors of the NCP and providing Chinese
experience for people around the world in responding to COVID-19.

Methods
This meta-analysis was performed in accordance with PRISMA-2009 (Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses)[6] and MOOSE
(Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines[7].

Search strategy
Relevant studies were searched from both Chinese and English electronic
bibliographic databases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI),
Wanfang, Weipu, Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database (CBM-SinoMed),
MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register and Web of science
from inception to 8 March 2020. The MeSH terms of COVID-19 and corresponding
synonyms were included into the searching strategy. Limiting our search to
human-subjects but without language limitation. Reference lists of retrieved articles
were also reviewed to further identify potentially relevant studies. The searching
procedures were independently performed by two reviewers (Lizhen Xu and Yaqian
Mao) and disagreements were settled by discussion.
Inclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) prospective or retrospective original
literature; (ii) all patients were clearly diagnosed with COVID-19; (iii) characteristics
of severe and non-severe patients were documented; and (iv) complete medical
records were available for data extraction.
Definition of severe COVID-19[8]: Severe COVID-19 was designated when the
patients had one of the following criteria:1) Respiratory distress with respiratory
frequency≥30/min; 2) Pulse Oximeter Oxygen Saturation≤93% at rest; 3)
Oxygenation index (artery partial pressure of oxygen/inspired oxygen fraction,
PaO2/FiO2)≤300 mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa). At high altitudes (above 1000 meters),
PaO2 / FiO2 should be corrected according to the following criteria: PaO2 / FiO2

[Atmospheric Pressure (mmHg) / 760]. Pulmonary imaging showed that the lesions
progressed more than 50% within 24-48 hours should be managed according to
Critically ill patients.
Quality assessment
The observational study quality evaluation criteria recommended by the American
agency for health research and quality (AHRQ) were used to evaluate the study
quality. These criteria included 11 items, including subjects selection, research quality
control and data processing. Each question will be answered with “yes,” “no” or
“unclear.”
Data extraction
The following characteristics were extracted from selected studies: authors, sample
size, region, study period. In addition, the following possible risk factors were
recorded independently: patient characteristics, comorbidities, vital signs, symptoms,
laboratory findings. Data extraction was accomplished independently by two
reviewers (Lizhen Xu and Yaqian Mao). Any disagreement was resolved by joint
discussion to reach a consensual conclusion. There were a few points that need to be
explained. First, in order to minimize the risk of duplication of data, when two or
more studies presented possible overlap, where sampling periods overlapped and
patients were from the same region, the one with largest populations was included.
Second, continuous variables were expressed as medians and interquartile ranges or
simple ranges in some studies, the standard deviation and mean value were not
estimated due to inaccurate.

Data synthesis and statistical analysis
For categorical variables, analysis was performed by calculating the odds ratio (OR)
with 95% confidence interval (95% CI). For continuous outcomes, Weighted Mean
Difference (WMD) and standardized mean difference (SMD) with the corresponding
95% CI were calculated. The heterogeneity was assessed by using the I2 test, with
I2>50 % indicating the existence of heterogeneity. If there is significant heterogeneity,
a random effect model (DerSimonian-Laird method) was used to calculate the pooled
effect; otherwise, the fixed model (Mantel-Haenszel method) was used. Possible
publication bias was evaluated via observing the symmetry characteristics of
funnel-plots. If the number of included studies in each outcome was <10, the funnel
plot was not performed due to limited power[9]. Data analysis was undertaken using
STATA, version 15.0 (Stata Corp).

Results
Literature search results
The entire process of literature searching and screening was displayed in Figure 1.
Initially, 6354 publications were identified through database searching. After the
removal of 2622 duplicates, there remained a record of 3732 studies. We excluded
3654 records by reviewing their titles and abstracts. As a result, only 78 articles were
subject to a full-text review. Finally, 20 articles met the inclusion criteria were
included in the synthesis.
Study characteristics

The main characteristics of the studies were summarized in Table 1. All articles were
observational studies. All the subjects are from China, including more than 30
provinces and cities. The study period spans from 11 December 2019 to 23 February
2020. About the comparison of mild and severe patients, 15 studies[1, 10-23] described
patient characteristics, 15 studies described comorbidities[1, 10-17, 20-25], 8 studies[1, 10, 14,
17, 19, 20, 22, 23]

described vital signs, 17 studies compared symptoms[1, 10-12, 14-26] and 19

studies[1, 10-27] described laboratory findings. Guan, etc’study included 1099 patients
from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, and described the clinical characteristics of mild
and severe patients in detail. Because of this article may be overlaps in population
data with other studies, and the results are mainly described using median and quartile
intervals, so we did not include the data in our meta-analysis, and mainly used
descriptive analysis to compare the results with our studies.
Quality assessment
The quality of included studies was assessed by the observational study quality
evaluation criteria recommended by AHRQ. All studies included clear data sources,
inclusion and exclusion criteria, and reasonable control of confounding factors.
However, only a few studies clearly reported the quality control of the study and the
treatment of missing data (See Appendix table 1).
Meta-analysis
The results of the meta-analysis are shown in Table 2. More intuitive results can be
found in the forest-plot (Figure 2, Figure 3).
Patient characteristics (Age, Gender, BMI and Smoking)

A random-effects model (I2=54.4%) was used on 6 articles[10, 12, 13, 17, 22, 23] involving
681 patients to analyze the risk factors of age for severe patients with COVID-19.
Compared with non-severe patients, the average age of severe patients was older
(WMD=11.89 [8.63, 15.14]) than mild patients. Results about gender on ten studies[10,
12, 13, 15-17, 19, 21-23]

included 1494 patients suggesting that men were more likely to

have severe pneumonia than women (OR=1.61 [1.25, 2.07]). Only have two studies[18,
23]

on BMI included 79 patients showed that the BMI value of severe patients was

higher than non-severe patients (WMD = 3.38 [0.07, 6.69]). A fixed-effects model
was used on 3 articles[10, 15, 23] involving 412 patients to analyze the risk factors of
smoking showed that there was no significant correlation between smoking and the
severe pneumonia (OR = 1.4 [0.65, 3.01]).
Comorbidities (Diabetes, Hypertension, Coronary heart disease, Chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease)
Our research show that patients with the following underlying diseases are more
likely to develop severe COVID-19: Diabetes mellitus (DM):OR = 3.04 [2.01, 4.60],
Hypertension (HTN):OR = 2.31 [1.68, 3.18], Coronary heart disease (CHD):OR =
2.76 [ 1.39, 5.45], Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD):OR = 3.56 [1.33,
9.54]. All results were low heterogeneous (I2<50%).
Vital Signs (respiratory rate) and Symptoms (Fever and Dyspnea)
Regarding breathing, our study in 2 article[14, 23] (included 70 patients) showing that
patients with severe COVID-19 breathed faster (WMD = 5.29 [2.56, 8.01], I2 =
42.8%). Our study on fever (11 articles[10,

12, 14-17, 19, 22, 23, 25, 26]

) and dyspnea (8

articles[10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 19, 22, 25]) founded that fever and dyspnea may be the risk factors
for severe patients (Fever: OR = 2.11 [1.11, 4.02]; Dyspnea: OR = 8.83 [2.82,
27.67 ]).
Laboratory Findings (Blood routine, Biochemical indicators, Inflammatory
biomarkers and Coagulation)
Our study in laboratory findings showed that white-cell count (WMD=1.76 [0.31,
3.22]) increased in severe patients, while the proportion of lymphocytes decreased
(WMD=-0.42 [ -0.52, -0.33]). Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients
have higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and
total bilirubin (Tbil) (ALT: WMD = 16.97 [2.18, 31.76]), AST: WMD = 20.60 [6.81,
34.40 ], Tbil: WMD = 3.93 [2.01, 5.86]), but creatinine (Cr), albumin (ALB) and
neutrophil count (N count) does not seem obvious difference (Cr: WMD = 8.32 [-1.63,
18.28], ALB:WMD = -5.74 [-7.94, -3.54], N count, WMD=2.92 [-1.33, 7.17]).
Regarding of C-reactive protein (CRP) and Procalcitonin (PCT), severe patients were
higher than non-severe patients (CRP: SMD = 2.11 [0.71, 3.51], PCT: WMD = 0.16
[0.04, 0.28]). What’more, our study found that compared with non-severe patients,
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK) and D-dimer (D-D) increased
more significantly in severe patients (LDH: SMD = 2.0 [1.20, 2.80], CK: WMD =
23.55 [17.08, 30.02], D-D: WMD = 0.67 [0.02, 1.32]).
Publication bias
We only draw a funnel-plots for the outcome indicators with more than 10 studies,
and judge the publication bias of the results by observing the symmetry of the

funnel-plots. As shown, our funnel-plots is roughly symmetrical, indicating that
publication bias is small. In addition, our research not only includes published studies,
but for unpublished literature on medRxiv and bioxiv, as long as it meets our
inclusion criteria, we also include them, aim to minimize publication bias.

Discussion
This study shows the conclusive evidence as risk factors for severe COVID-19
patients, such as patient characteristics (age, gender, BMI), comorbidities (DM,
HTN, CHD, COPD), vital signs (respiratory rate), symptoms (fever and dyspnea)
and laboratory findings (blood routine, biochemical indicators, inflammatory
biomarkers and coagulation).
At present, no special drug for SARS-CoV-2 infection has been found and the
research process of the vaccine is still in clinical trials, the treatment of COVID-19 is
mainly by Symptomatic treatment. Based on Chinese experience, mild patients and
their close contacts treated in close isolation and follow-up are likely to be sufficient
to manage the disease[29-31]. But for severe patients, intensive care and aggressive
treatments are needed. By searching various databases, we found that this is the first
article of systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the characteristics of
severely infected patients with SARS-CoV-2.
The article[1] of Guan, etc shows that the Median (IQR) age of critically ill
patients was 52.0 (40.0–65.0) which was older than the non-critically ill patients
whose median (IQR) age was 45.0 (34.0–57.0). Similarly in our review, we found that

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047415; this version posted April 1, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

patients with critically ill were older than those with non-critically ill patients, and
most patients are male. Moreover, the presence of coexisting illness (such as DM,
HTN, CHD, COPD) was more common among patients with severe disease than
among those with nonsevere disease. We all know that the elderly with basic diseases,
especially those with diabetes usually have a high blood glucose status for a long time,
so their ability to defend against infection is low[32]. They are at high risk for various
infections, and once infected, they can easily develop into severe diseases. The lower
sensitivity of women to viral infections may be due to the protection from X
chromosomes and sex hormones, which play an important role in innate and adaptive
immunity[33]. So, we think that elderly male patients with underlying diseases are at
high risk for severely ill with COVID-19 and needs special attention from clinicians.
In addition, our study also found that patients with high BMI are more likely to
develop into severe pneumonia, which may be related to the high expression of
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in obese patients[34]. We know that ACE2 is
a binding receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and has a very high affinity between them. Obese
patients are richer in adipose tissue, have a larger total amount of ACE2 receptors[34],
and are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. It is suggested that obese people are at high
risk of COVID-19, and they are the key protection targets in epidemic prevention
work.
The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, sputum production, sore
throat, fatigue or myalgia, dyspnea, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, chills and headache,
etc. In most studies, the symptom of fever and dyspnea occur more frequently in

critically ill patients[1, 11, 12], which is consistent with our study. regarding of vital signs,
we found that critically ill patients usually breathed more faster than non-critically ill
patients, which related to the low level of blood oxygen saturation caused by severe
lung disease in critically ill patients. A study[23] from 49 people found no significant
difference in pulse rate between severe patients and non-severe patients (90.6 ± 10.3
vs. 93.8 ± 13.7, p = 0.440), which is consistent with the findings of fang, et al[22]. At
the same time, the fang’s study[22] also found that the blood pressure of severe patients
seems to be higher than that of non-severe patients [SBP: 133.3 ± 16.5 vs. 121.2 ± 9.5,
p <0.001; DBP: 83.3 ± 11.7 vs. 74.2 ± 9.5, p <0.001]. while the study by Xiang, et
al[23] found no significant difference in systolic blood pressure (p = 0.769), but lower
diastolic blood pressure (69.1 ± 10.8 vs. 80.7 ± 12.7, p = 0.013) compared with
non-severe patients.
As for laboratory tests, patients with severe disease had more prominent
laboratory abnormalities (including lymphocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated
levels of ALT, AST, Tbil, LDH, CK, etc) than those with nonsevere disease. Many
previous studies have reported lymphocytopenia in patients with COVID-19[35],
lymphocytopenia is a significant feature of severe patients with SARS-CoV-2
infection because targeted invasion by SARS-CoV viral particles can damages
thecytoplasmic component of the lymphocyte and cause its necrosis or apoptosis[36].
In this meta-analysis, we found that SARS-CoV-2 can damage the various organs
throughout the body in addition to the lung, manifested as the elevated levels of ALT,
AST, Tbil, LDH, CK, etc in different degree. As we know, coronavirus (CoV) is a

pathogen that infects the respiratory, gastrointestinal, liver, and central nervous
systems of humans and many other wild animals[37, 38]. SARS-CoV-2, also known as
the sister virus of SARS-CoV, has 85% nucleotide homology[39,

40]

. The latest

pathology reports[41] found that the pathological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV are similar, mainly manifesting as acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) and multiple organ failure, which also explains the cause of multiple organ
dysfunction in critically ill patients. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to infect human
respiratory epithelial cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors on
human cells[42, 43]. Many studies[34, 44] have found that the levels of ACE2 RNA was
higher in heart, kidney, intestinal tract, gallbladder, adipose tissue and testicles than
lungs in human body, which also explains the reason why multi-organ dysfunction is
prone to occur in severe patients.
Inflammatory biomarker is also a common feature in the patients with
COVID-19 and might be a critical factor associated with disease severity and
mortality. In the study, we found that CRP and PCT increased in varying degrees for
severe patients. Some research also reported the elevated level of ESR, IL-6, and
IL-10 in critically ill patients[24]. It is considered that multiple cytokines are secreted
after the infection of microorganisms causing a strong inflammatory response and the
damage of immune system, indicated that critically ill patients may have more severe
systemic inflammatory response, so attention should be paid to strengthen the
treatment of anti-inflammatory[23].

Limitations
However, there are still some limitations lying in our study. First, all included studies
were cross-sectional, precluding the possibility to establish inferences regarding
causality. Second, populations, risk factors analyzed, lengths of follow-up, and
statistical methods might differ and cause study heterogeneity. Third, although this
study reviewed the risk factors of severe COVID-19 patients and their impact,
assessing the effect size of each risk factor and developing risk models were
important.

Conclusion
The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia has placed great pressure on intensive care
resources in hospital, especially in some developing countries where lacking of
medical staff and health resources, so early identification of severe patients and taking
active and effective measures can reduce deaths.
