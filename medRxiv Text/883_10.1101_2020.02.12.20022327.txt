Methods

We used a fluorescence-based quantitative PCR kit urgently distributed by the Chinese CDC to

detect 8274 close contacts in the Wuhan region against two loci on the 2019-nCoV genome. We

also analyzed 613 patients with fever who underwent multiple tests for 13 respiratory pathogens;

316 subjects were also tested for 2019-nCoV.

Findings

Among the 8274 subjects, 2745 (33.2%) had 2019-nCoV infection; 5277 (63.8%) subjects showed

because only one target was positive, the diagnosis was not definitive. Eleven patients who

originally had only one positive target were re-examined a few days later; 9 patients (81.8%) were

finally defined as 2019-nCoV-positive, and 2 (18.2%) were finally defined as negative. The positive

rates of nCoV-NP and nCovORF1ab were 34.7% and 34.7%, respectively. nCoV-NP-positive only

and nCovORF1ab-positive cases accounted for 1.5% and 1.5%, respectively. In the 316 patients

with multiple respiratory pathogens, 104 were positive for 2019-nCov and 6/104 had co-infection

with coronavirus (3/104), influenza A virus (2/104), rhinovirus (2/104), and influenza A H3N2

(1/104); the remaining 212 patients had influenza A virus (11/202), influenza A H3N2 (11/202),

INTRODUCTION

An outbreak of novel coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, China in December 2019; since submitting

this manuscript, more than 10,000 cases have been confirmed in all provinces of China and 200

deaths have occurred in Wuhan

1

. Infections spread by air travel have also been reported in Japan,

2

Thailand, Singapore, Republic of Korea, and many other countries . On January 7, 2020, Chinese

scientists isolated a novel coronavirus (nCoV) from patients in Wuhan, the genome of which was

uploaded to NCBI on January 10

3,4

. Human airway epithelial cells were used to isolate the novel

coronavirus, named as 2019-nCoV, which formed another clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus,

Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. 2019-nCoV differs from Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV and

severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV and is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses

that infect humans

4

. The clinical features of 41 patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus

were described by front-line doctors. It was found that the 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters

of severe respiratory illness similar to SARS coronavirus and was associated with intensive care

unit admission and high mortality, but had numerous different features from SARS. Among the 41

5

patients, 6 patients have died since the paper was published . Although the death rate of

2019-nCoV is currently lower than that of SARS, transmission between patients is more prevalent.

Clinical evidence showed that one patient infected 14 doctors and nurses. Additionally, in five

patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to

Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, an additional family member who

did not travel to Wuhan was infected

6

. This virus can remain in patients for many days, including

in some carriers who did not show classic syndromes. This may lead to the infection of many

doctors and nurses, as well as rapid dissemination of the virus from Wuhan to many other

locations.

The

rapid

and

accurate

of

2019-nCoV

infection

in

patients

and

carriers

is

key

for

preventing and controlling this epidemic. Thus, fast and accurate clinical detection methods for

2019-nCoV are particularly important. The China CDC recommends the use of a specific real-time

RT-PCR method with specific primers and probes to detect the 2019-nCoV open reading frame

(ORF1ab) and nucleoprotein (N) gene regions If both targets are positive, the patient is defined as

having a laboratory-confirmed infection

7

.

However, during the testing process, various factors can affect the outcomes of analysis and

resulting

in

false-positive

or

false-negative

results.

This

makes

it

difficult

to

perform

clinical

diagnosis and control the epidemic situation. In addition, 2019-nCoV may be co-infected with

other pathogens. Therefore, patients suspected of having 2019-nCoV infection should also be

evaluated by other detection methods to screen for additional respiratory pathogens. However,

up-to-date

data

on

co-infected

pathogens

and

their

proportions

in

combination

with

the

2019-nCoV infection are needed. Our clinical laboratory is located at the center of the epidemic

and currently has tested the largest number of samples for 2019-nCoV infection worldwide; we

have information for 8274 recent cases (January 21 to February 9, 2020) available for analyzing

2019-nCoV.

treatment in Wuhan and other areas combating this epidemic. Thus, in this study, we evaluated

the testing methods for 2019-nCoV, as well as co-infections with other pathogens.

Viral Diagnostic Methods
Detection of 2019-nCoV

We used the Viral Nucleic Acid Kit (Health, Ningbo, China) to extract nucleic acids from clinical

samples according to the kit instructions. A 2019-nCoV detection kit (Bioperfectus, Taizhou, China)

was used to detect the ORF1ab gene (nCovORF1ab) and the N gene (nCoV-NP) according to the

manufacturer’s instructions using real-time RT-PCR. If the circulation threshold (Ct value) was

lower than 37, the gene detection results were considered as positive. If the Ct value was greater

than or equal to 40, it was considered that the gene was not present. If the Ct value was between

37

and

40,

the

was suspected.

The

was notified

to perform

the infection was considered as laboratory-confirmed.

RESULTS
Of the 8274 subjects, 2745 (33.2%) were diagnosed with the 2019-nCoV infection and classified

into the 2019-nCoV group, whereas 5277 (63.8%) were negative for infection according to the

2019-nCoV nucleic acid test and were classified into the non-2019-nCoV group. A total of 252

patients (3.0%), we were temporarily unable to obtain a clear diagnosis because only one target

gene was positive. This group of subjects was classified as the inconclusive group. The median

ages of subjects in the 2019-nCoV, non-2019-nCoV, and inconclusive groups were 56 years (range,

42–67 years), 40 years (range, 30–57 years), and 52 years (range, 35–64 years), respectively.

Dunnett test showed that the age of subjects in the non-2019-nCoV group was significantly lower

than in the 2019-nCoV group (t = -20.724, p < 0·001) and inconclusive group (t = -4.251, p <

0·001), whereas the 2019-nCoV group did not significantly differ in age from the inconclusive

group (t = -2.218, p = 0.052).

DISCUSSION

Here,

we

used

8274

samples

to

initially

evaluate

the

laboratory

testing

characteristics

of

2019-nCoV. In clinical testing, although most subjects showed a clear diagnosis, other subjects

did not. This is not conducive for treating potential infections and controlling the 2019-nCoV

epidemic. In addition, 2019-nCoV may be co-infected with other pathogens; however, the types

of co-infected pathogens and the proportion of 2019-nCoV infection is unclear; whether these

co-infection conditions require improvements in current treatments is unknown.

The results of this study indicate that of the 8274 subjects evaluated by the 2019-nCoV nucleic

acid test, 2745 (33.2%) were confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV, whereas 5277 (63.8%)

showed negative results. For 252 cases (3.0%), we were temporarily unable to obtain a clear

diagnosis because only one target gene was positive. The proportion of males infected (35.5%)

was

higher

than

that

of

females

(29.6%).

Among

the

104

patients

who

tested

positive

for

2019-nCov, 5.8% were co-infected with other pathogens. Our findings provide important data for

clinical testing, clinical diagnosis, and treatment, as well as for 2019-nCoV epidemic control.

Clinical test

The results of test in which only one target gene was positive requires further attention. From the

perspective of clinical testing, this may have occurred because of sample collection problems.

Poor sample quality greatly affects clinical testing results. We compared sputum samples with

nasopharyngeal swab samples from 63 subjects collected on the same day. The results obtained

from the 63 nasopharyngeal swab samples were very clear, whereas sputum samples showed a

Ct value of 37–40 and some-false negatives. This may be because sputum is not a homogeneous

substance. When extracting nucleic acids, the sampling site of the sputum sample can affect the

quality and quantity of 2019-nCoV in the extracted nucleic acid, in turn affecting the test results.

In

addition, the

properties and position of the

sputum in the

trachea

vary

widely.

This can

prevent effective control of the sample quality of the sample during the sampling process, which

can affect the test results, particularly in patients at an early stage of infection when the virus has

not yet multiplied. Second, we used pharyngeal swabs which are flexible and change shape as the

nasopharynx bends; thus, samples can be obtained from deeper locations, which is helpful for

collecting samples with a higher virus content. Additionally, the 2019-nCoV epidemic is currently

a serious public health threat, and thus personnel with rich experience in clinical sampling should

be designated to collect samples. Finally, attention should be paid to environmental pollution

during sampling, and hospital management departments should set up special sampling rooms

and management measures to prevent the samples from being contaminated with 2019-nCoV in

the environment.

Problems related to sample pre-processing should also be considered. Before clinical testing of

the

samples,

steps such

as nucleic acid extraction are

required.

Experimental operators and

management personnel should pay attention to whether the laboratory is qualified for testing.

The

laboratory

environment

and

its

equipment

should

have

the

ability

to

prevent

cross-contamination of samples, prevent occupational exposure of personnel, and be equipped

with comprehensive disinfection equipment and emergency measures for occupational exposure.

Only nCovORF1ab showed positive results during evaluation, and the two targets were negative

after re-sampling and re-examination on the next a few days; thus, contamination may have

occurred.

Contamination

may

arise

from

the

sampling

or

processing

process.

Additionally,

personnel familiar with the experimental skills required should perform the analysis. Finally, the

2019-nCoV test kit should meet the clinical requirements.

Regarding detection problems, inspectors and managers should determine whether the kit used

meets the required standards, reagents are stored properly, and equipment used has aging parts.

Therefore,

a

broad-spectrum, rapid, and accurate bacterial screening and detection platform (even for most

known and unknown pathogens) is needed in the clinic to identify pathogens, judge the patient's

condition, and avoid blind administration of drugs.

Clinical diagnosis and treatment

The median age of the 2019-nCoV group in this study was 56 years (range 42–67), which was

close to the first 425 patients diagnosed (59 years, range 15–89 years)

10

. Interestingly, even if a

clear diagnosis cannot be obtained for the inconclusive group, the median age of these patients

(52 years, range 35–64 years) was very similar to that of the 2019-nCoV group (56 years, range

42–67 years). These patients were much older than patients in the non-2019-nCoV group (40

years, 30–57

years).

Thus, 2019-nCoV infection is likely

to be

undetected in

subjects in the

inconclusive group. We observed that in several subjects for whom a clear diagnosis could not be

initially obtained, 2019-nCoV infection was confirmed after re-sampling and re-evaluation on the

following days. However, the predictions based on the age variable alone are well-supported.

Moreover,

were

re-sampled on the next a few days, showing nucleic acid-negative test results. Although this may

have occurred because of contamination during sampling and testing, the presence of this group

indicates that the inconclusive group may not have undetected 2019-nCoV infection. Further

studies are needed to evaluate this point.

Screening for 13 respiratory pathogens revealed that 2019-nCoV can be co-infected with other

viruses, mainly coronavirus 2.88% (3/104), influenza A virus 1.94% (2/104), rhinovirus 1.94%

(2/104), and A3 H3N2 0.96% (1/104). Therefore, while treating 2019-nCoV, other viruses should

also

be

treated.

develop septic shock

. Our results indicate that patients infected with 2019-nCoV are mostly

middle-aged and elderly, and their resistance to infection is generally low; thus, prophylactic

antibiotics can reduce their mortality and comorbidity.

Outbreak control

Our results show that 3.0% of subjects were positive for only one target gene in initial testing;

re-sampling and review after several days revealed both diagnosed and nucleic acid-negative

cases. Because of the limited number of samples, we could not determine whether false-positive

or false-negative results were more likely; however, those who are positive for only one target

gene in initial testing should be isolated and observed as much as possible to avoid potential

2019-nCoV infected persons from spreading the epidemic. Patients infected with 2019-nCoV may

be infected with other pathogens which are community-based, iatrogenic, or both, for which

precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of cross-infection among patients in the hospital.

For example, patients infected with 2019-nCoV should be isolated from those with pneumonia

caused by other pathogens. This isolation should involve treatment and monitoring from the

patient's entry to the outpatient clinic to final discharge.

In summary, we analyzed data from 8274 laboratory tests and determined the laboratory test

characteristics of 2019-nCoV. We found that 3.0% of subjects could not be clearly diagnosed with

2019-nCoV infection. they may be 2019-nCoV People with nCoV infection may also be uninfected

people. Thus, the management of this population should be considered. The generation of such

results can be minimized by improving sampling, sample preparation, and testing methods. In

addition, 5.8% of the subjects diagnosed with 2019-nCoV were infected with other pathogens.

The possibility of co-infection should also be considered; additionally, better clinical detection

methods are necessary to simultaneously screen for as many pathogens as possible.
