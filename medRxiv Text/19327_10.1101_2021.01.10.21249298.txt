Abstract
Timely, accurate epidemic figures are necessary for informed policy. In the Covid-19
pandemic, mismeasurement can lead to tremendous waste, in health or economic output.
"Random" testing is commonly used to estimate virus prevalence, reporting daily positivity
rates. However, since testing is necessarily voluntary, all “random” tests done in the field suffer
from selection bias. This bias, unlike standard polling biases, goes beyond demographical
representativeness and cannot be corrected by oversampling (i.e. selecting people without
symptoms to test). Using controlled, incentivized experiments on a sample of all ages, we show
that people who feel symptoms are up to 33 times more likely to seek testing. The bias in testing
propensities leads to sizable prevalence bias: test positivity is inflated by up to five times, even
if testing is costless. This effect varies greatly across time and age groups, making comparisons
over time and across countries misleading. We validate our results using the REACT study in
the UK and find that positivity figures have indeed a very large and time varying bias. We
present calculations to debias positivity rates, but importantly, suggest a parsimonious way to
sample the population bypassing the bias altogether. Our estimation is both real-time and
consistently close to true values. These results are relevant for all epidemics, besides covid-19,
when carriers have informative beliefs about their own status.

Background
Tackling the covid-19 pandemic is of paramount importance for obvious health and

financial reasons. Over 2 million deaths have been confirmed globally (Johns Hopkins 2020),
and excess mortality is reported,1 as well as indirect health effects (undiagnosed/undertreated
diseases2-3 and suicides.4-5). The pandemic per se, but also the containment measures against
it, have crippled economic activity, leading to increasing unemployment rates and shrinking
income worldwide6 – in turn leading to further deterioration of health.7-8 The design of optimal

interventions to fight the disease, in time and space, requires efficient and accurate prevalence
measurement, preferably in real time.
How to measure prevalence for infectious diseases? In this paper we show that
commonly used methods are flawed because testing is voluntary, leading to heavy selfselection bias. We calculate how self-selection translates into biased prevalence estimates
generally, and estimate the likely size of this bias, employing incentivised controlled
experiments on a large sample of all ages, using standard experimental methods (similar were
used in an influential paper to estimate HIV testing demand9, but not disease prevalence). Using
our experimental data, we find that the commonly used “test positivity” measure may inflate
actual prevalence by up to 5 times, even if testing is provided at zero cost. If covid-19 tests are
costly for the testee (as is common), this inflation factor or prevalence bias can be much higher.
To make estimation harder, the prevalence bias is not constant, but rather depends strongly on
actual prevalence. This means that we cannot apply a fixed adjustment to test positivity
measures, and such measures cannot be used to compare prevalence across countries, as is
commonly done. To validate our results, we compare prevalence estimates from the REACT
study in the UK, to test positivity ratios at the same dates 10. As predicted by our calculations,
the prevalence bias is indeed positive, very large and time varying, ranging from 3.8 to 23.6 in
the different waves of the study. To say it another way, our estimates of the testing bias and
calculations of how this translates to a prevalence bias, explain why test positivity rates always
seem to be too high.
Our estimates of the testing bias by age group can be used to calculate the prevalence
bias for countries with different demographic structures. Further, we present the parameter
estimations necessary to debias the current prevalence estimates in the field, but, crucially,
suggest a novel method to bypass the self-selection bias altogether with an estimation
procedure that is at the same time faster, more accurate and more feasible than current methods.

To understand the relevance of these results, start by noting that suggested policy
responses and their implementation (e.g. social distancing rules) will inevitably be inefficient
if we are not aware of the real number of active cases, and in which areas and age groups these
occur. Observing mortality rates or the number of hospitalisations and patients in ICU are not
real time measurements; they only provide an estimate of how many people caught Covid-19
weeks earlier (and estimating the fatality rate is also challenging).11 This time lag is very
important when trying to evaluate interventions. Without real time data, measuring the effect
of a vaccine will take months, on top of the time the vaccine takes to have a medical effect.
Understanding the full effect of other events on the disease, like the Christmas holidays (which
led to more interaction and possibly higher transmission) similarly takes months (see excellent
work on the effectiveness of NPIs, which uses death counts, lagging by several weeks)12. On
the other hand, knowing the current number of actual cases, allows the design of optimal policy
response, and also provides a forward-looking estimate of hospitalisations and mortality.
Health systems get warning several weeks ahead, gaining invaluable time for necessary
adjustments.
Community testing, often conducted in the high street and in neighbourhoods, is widely
considered a useful tool to monitor incidence and trends. The ECDC12 lists “[to] reliably
monitor SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates and severity” among five objectives of testing. It also
publishes weekly testing data and “positivity rates” by EU State.13 However, we show that such
testing cannot provide accurate estimates of Covid-19 prevalence, and the main problem is not
related to typical issues that arise in population sampling, such as sampling representative age
groups. Testing has to be voluntary, and people are likelier to self-select into testing if they
have reasons to believe they might be having Covid-19 (such as, e.g. if they have symptoms or
if they are exposed to a high-risk environment). We find in our data that the self-selection bias
increases non-linearly with waiting times and any other cost associated with testing. To make

prevalence estimation harder, the bias is time-varying, because it depends non-linearly on time
varying parameters. For example, when cases rise steeply, people might be more likely to want
to test out of fear. This leads to longer queues for testing, longer waiting times and a
disproportionately larger testing bias.
To summarise, the objective of this paper is to examine whether and to what extent bias
occurs in Covid-19 testing, to offer a debiasing solution to accurately estimate Covid-19
prevalence in the field using existing procedures, and lastly to propose a better procedure, both
more economical and more accurate.

2. Data and Methods
Standard theoretical arguments allow the precise calculation of the prevalence bias (see
Appendix C). However, the size and direction of the prevalence bias in the field is an empirical
issue, and crucially depends on the self-selection testing bias based on symptoms. Are people
who believe they have symptoms more likely to seek testing, and if yes, by how much? In order
to measure this, we ran incentivised controlled experiments.
Data collection took place over a week, from 11 till 18 December 2020. The majority of
the responses were collected online, via the QualtricsTX platform. To enable greater
representativeness of the sample, 94 responses (16%) from elder people (median age = 63)
were collected using phone interviews. Out of 608 participants starting the online study, 24
(4.7) dropped out mostly after the first few questions, resulting in the final sample of 578
observations.
The median age for the sample was 39 years (median for Greece 45.6), and the age
distribution is shown in Figure A1 in Appendix A.
Subjects were invited to participate in a study on Covid-19 and related behaviours.
Upon signing a consent form, the participant was first asked about general and Covid-19-

related health. We then elicited hypothetical willingness to wait (WTW) to take a rapid test for
Covid-19, conditional on (i) feeling healthy, (ii) having flu-like symptoms, (iii) having Covid19 like symptoms. For all three hypothetical scenarios, the test was being offered by the
national health authority (EODY) while the participant was walking down the street. This was
done to reduce the (hypothetical) travel costs and reliability-related concerns.
After eliciting the hypothetical WTW, we asked the subjects several control questions,
including exposure to Covid-19 risky environments (e.g. taking public transport or working
fate-to-face with many people) and socio-demographics. After completing the compulsory part
of the study, the participants were offered an optional task for which they were randomly
allocated to one of the two prize treatments. In treatment Book, the participant would enter a
1/30 chance lottery for a voucher for the local large-scale bookshop chain (“Public”), worth
€80. In treatment Test, the participant would enter the same 1/30 chance lottery for a voucher
for a home-administered Covid-19 test. For both prizes, the delivery was guaranteed within the
next 36 hours. All 578 participants completed the hypothetical elicitation and the control
questions (left part of Figure A2 in Appendix A).
As was partly expected, a substantial part of the sample (n=174) did not continue to the
optional task. A major part of it (n=78) was the elder people subsample. We are not very
concerned that the inconvenience of the waiting task over the phone was the issue, since the
participants came from the sample that previously participated in a study involving a real effort
task over the phone14. For n=38 participants, a software glitch in Qualtrics, in the first five
hours of the study resulted in missing recording of the treatment allocation, so we had to drop
their data despite completion of the optional task.
The participants then read the description of the optional task. They learned that it
involved waiting in front of their screen for some time (target) that would be revealed in the
next screen, and the lottery draw for the prize would take place right after the wait. They also

learned that to ensure that they are waiting, a button would appear at random times and they
would need to press it within 4 seconds to avoid being disqualified. Among the 303 participants
who read the description of the optional task, 241 continued to the next screen which revealed
the waiting target. At this stage, they were randomly allocated to one of the four waiting target
conditions {300, 600, 900, 1200}. Upon learning the wait time, further 59 participants dropped
out instantly (median target time 900 seconds). Among the 241 waiting, 69 dropped out before
completing the full wait (median target time 900 seconds). In total, 172 participants completed
the waiting target (median target 600 seconds).
Upon completing the waiting task, each participant was randomly allocated to one of
the four Cash conditions, {€20, €35, €50, €65}. The participant was offered a choice to enter
the lottery for: (a) the original prize (Book, Test), or (b) the displayed Cash amount. Out of the
172 participants, 112 chose to swap the original prize for the cash amount, whilst 60 chose to
stay with the original prize (median cash value €35 for both). A total of 7 participants won the
lottery.

3. Results
Table 1 shows the ratio of willingness to test between people with symptoms and those
without. The figure ranges between 1.5 and 38, depending on the age group and waiting times.
People under 30 with symptoms are 1.532 times more likely to test when there is no waiting
time, compared to those without symptoms. This figure increases to 2.882 when there is a short
wait of 5-15 minutes; 4.423 with a 15-30 minute wait; 15.5 with a 30-60 minute wait and 38
with a 1-2 hour wait. The ratio for 30-50 year-olds rages between 1.517 for no wait and 16 for
a 1-2 hour wait. For over 50-year-olds, the ratio ranges between 1.708 and 11.333. Overall,
there is a bias even for no waiting time at all, which increases steeply for long waiting times in
all age groups. Note that the bias also varies by other observable characteristics, for example,

for waiting times of two hours and more, it is 84% higher for men than for women. Also, the
propensity bias is 50% higher for obese people than for people in the healthy range, which
indicates that people at risk not only have higher propensity to test (as is to be expected) but
also react stronger to symptoms.

[Insert Table 1 here]

The propensity to test bias translates to a biased virus prevalence estimate (β) which is
also time varying. Crucially it depends on symptom prevalence, which, given the exponential
spread of Covid-19, can change massively in a short period of time. This means that the
estimate depends on symptom prevalence, but the bias itself also depends on it – so the bias is
time variant.
Apart from waiting times, self-selecting into testing also depends on the cost associated
with it (if applicable – costs can vary from time to monetary value, travel etc). We found that
the bias is associated with willingness to pay for the test (Table A2 in Appendix A). Of those
who won a test voucher, 83.8% swapped it for cash, as opposed to 48.9% of those who won
the book voucher, indicating that the majority of subjects would not be willing to pay to receive
a test. However, the scope of this article is to correct bias for free tests subject to different
waiting times, and further experiments are needed to reach concrete conclusions on willingness
to pay.
We have launched an online calculator that provides estimates on the testing bias
(available at http://georgana.net/sotiris/task/atten/covid.php). The bias calculations that lead to
the formula on which the calculator is based, is provided in Appendix C. The estimates on the
testing bias depend on (a) the percentage of tests yielding positive results; (b) the percentage
of the general population that reports symptoms; (c) the relative likelihood of having Covid-19

for those with symptoms compared to those without symptoms; and (d) how more likely are
people with symptoms to self-select into testing than those without symptoms. According to
our methodology, it is possible to calculate these figures and thus estimate the bias. (a) is
provided by the results of community testing; (b) is provided by surveying; (c) can be obtained
by asking people a simple question before testing them for Covid-19; and (d) is provided by
surveying.
A simple example is the following: Assume community testing led to 10% positive
results, and 5% of the population reported symptoms. Without waiting time, if those with
symptoms are 5 times more likely to have the virus than those without symptoms, then the
results of community testing exaggerate by 27.71%, and the true prevalence in the population
is 7.83% (instead of the reported 10%). At a 30-60 minute waiting time, the bias increases to
106.95%, meaning that the true prevalence in the population is 4.83%.
To further illustrate our results, Figure 1 depicts our best estimate of the virus
prevalence bias, i.e. the ratio between reported prevalence and actual, depending on symptoms
prevalence and waiting time, for the three age groups.

[Insert Figure 1 here]

Based on these estimates, we can simulate how different demographic structures would
affect the prevalence bias. In Figure 2 we depict the results from 3 million draws from the
plausible parameter space (we assume symptoms prevalence of 5%, and allow the testing bias
parameter to vary uniformly within the 95% confidence interval gained from the experiments)
applied to three countries, with different demographic structures: Nigeria (with one of the
youngest populations globally), Italy (heavily ageing population) and the USA (between the
two extremes). The simulation shows that demography matters: a young country like Nigeria

could have a substantially higher prevalence bias than Italy. However, it is also clear that the
waiting times are more important than demographics. Lowering waiting times would result in
a low bias for all countries.

[Insert Figure 2 here]

Finally, to validate our results on the prevalence bias, we compare with data from the
REACT study in the UK. While in this study too, participants are freely choosing to test or not,
testing kits are being sent home to participants at no cost and the sample is carefully selected.
According to our results, the bias in this study is non negligible but should still be the smallest
of any major field testing procedure yet published. Treating the (weighted) prevalence
estimates from this study as true prevalence and comparing to the test positive rate from all
tests done in the country in the same dates, we obtain an (independent to our experiments)
estimate of the prevalence bias (see Appendix B). In the 10 different subwaves of the study,
the estimated prevalence bias indeed is positive, substantial, but also highly variable, ranging
from 3.8 to 23.6, thus confirming our three main predictions.

4. Discussion
Using an incentivised online experiment, we found that the probability of taking a
Covid-19 test for those who have symptoms (or believe they are more likely to have caught the
virus) is many times higher than those who do not. In our sample, this testing propensity bias
ranged from 1.5 times (for people under 30 years with no waiting time) to 38 times (for people
under 30 and a 2-hour waiting time). The bias becomes larger with longer waiting times, and
any cost associated with taking the test. Testing stations cannot readily correct this by
oversampling (i.e. selecting people without symptoms to test).

Demographics also influence the testing propensity bias, which means that different
areas (or countries) will have different biases depending on the age composition. Furthermore,
there have been reports of very long waiting times in community testing, which greatly
exacerbates the bias. It is important to note that the bias is time-variant, and depends strongly
on the actual virus prevalence.
Our findings imply that virus positivity results from community testing sites are heavily
biased. Contrary to conventional wisdom in the health policy community that suggested the
bias would be, if anything, downward, our results suggest that prevalence is inflated by up to
5 times, even if tests are not costly. The prevalence bias is not just large, but also time-varying,
confirmed in a comparison with real-world data, meaning that test positivity comparisons
across countries or time are necessarily flawed.
Importantly, the prevalence bias goes beyond the issues of age group or location
selection usually considered. Rather, it relates to self-selection into testing for those who
(believe they) are more likely to have Covid-19. This makes the aggregate results of
community testing unreliable when it comes to drawing conclusions on the prevalence of
Covid-19 in the population.
We recognise the importance of giving people the opportunity to test, as this identifies
positive cases, thus allowing them to self-isolate and stop spreading the disease. If the goal of
street testing is just to allow random people to have a quick and free test, then this possibly
meets its goal. Note, however, that random testing is not efficient, economically, or
epidemiologically: subsidising tests specifically for populations with a high risk of getting
infected and infecting others would probably save more lives at lower cost (say, tests for young
people working in service industries and living with their parents). These questions remain
open for future research.

What we have shown is that “random” voluntary testing is not really random. As such,
it does not provide accurate information on disease prevalence, which is important to design
and implement urgent policy responses to the pandemic, in terms of type, intensity and
geographic area. Since voluntary testing is always biased, aggregate results on prevalence
should be corrected. Debiasing can be performed using our methodology, as long as there are
good estimates for four parameters, namely (a) the percentage of tests in the field yielding
positive results; (b) the percentage of the general population that reports symptoms; (c) how
more likely are people with symptoms to be carrying the virus than those without symptoms;
and (d) how more likely are people with symptoms to self-select into testing than those without
symptoms. Obtaining estimates for the above parameters is of varying difficulty: (a) is obtained
in any country doing “random” street testing, (b) can be estimated with standard polling and
(d) can be estimated with our experimental methodology. Estimating (c) would require asking
subjects at testing stations to self-report their symptoms before testing.
We suggest a novel, more economical and accurate alternative for prevalence
estimation. The important parameter to estimate is the probability of having covid-19
conditional on having symptoms, and on not having symptoms, similar to parameter (c) above.
This can be done by asking a simple question at existing testing sites (indeed we have ongoing
parallel work underway to obtain these estimates in cooperation with testing centres). These
parameters could be country-specific and time-variant, but we do not expect changes to be fast.
Obtaining a few estimates in each virus season could suffice, and this estimate could be used
for similar countries. The next step is unusual and often misunderstood: poll a representative
sample regularly, to obtain symptoms prevalence. A common misunderstanding involves the
argument that laymen cannot measure their symptoms properly. This is not a bug, but a feature
of our procedure. Since the testing bias depends on self-reported symptoms, we need to
condition on subjects believing they have symptoms, not on actually having them. Using both

steps above can yield accurate prevalence estimates in real time at very low, comparatively,
cost.
Our methodology is not limited to correcting the results of community testing.
Confirmed cases reported daily are also biased, as some people might not test because of costs,
or the inconvenience of going to a testing site, or even due to being afraid of losing income.
According to our results, even at no monetary cost and no wait, 3.98% of people with symptoms
would not get tested – which increases to 9.51% even for the slightest waiting time, rising even
further when tests have a non-negligible cost to the citizen. Using polling results from a
representative sample can correct this error.
The REACT study in the UK is an interesting special case of large-scale community
testing on a nationally representative sample. The authors claim that this sample is truly
random, but our results suggest this might not be the case. Even for people taking a free test at
home (compare to the no waiting time condition in the experiment), a substantial testing bias
exists. More importantly, REACT is very expensive to run, while simultaneously less timely
than our polling proposal. While REACT has been done monthly or less often, our procedure
can be run daily,
This paper also contributes to the literature on testing regimens.15 Mass testing,
extending to a very large part of the population, is useful as it can provide more accurate
figures, and also identifies positive cases. It has been used, among others, in Liverpool,
Slovakia and South Korea.16-19 However, mass testing is extremely expensive, and might be
infeasible, especially at frequent intervals, due to capacity and technical constraints.
In the absence of mass testing, obtaining unbiased prevalence estimates is of paramount
importance for health and the economy. Underestimating disease prevalence can trigger
inadequate measures and further spread of disease, while overestimating can be detrimental to

economic activity. We thus urge policy makers to redesign “random” testing as a matter of
priority in the effort to tackle the pandemic.
As a final note, our methodology is applicable to the prevalence measurement of any
epidemic, when carriers have informative private information about their health status.
Fighting disease is hard, even without the added complication of not knowing the location and
magnitude of the fight. Our work offers tools to measure prevalence in real time. Further work
is needed, to estimate specific selection-bias parameters for every disease, as they are
necessarily related to the health burden and life expectancy reduction caused by the specific
pathogen.

APPENDIX B
The REACT study has been conducted in eight waves, to date. Two of the waves have been published in two
subwaves, yielding 10 different observations. We focus on the weighted prevalence figure published, as the most
accurate. The number of daily tests is publicly available, along with the number of tests being positive, yielding
test positivity. We divide test positivity by the REACT prevalence estimate to obtain an estimate of the prevalence
bias in field testing. The following graph presents the results.

REACT Waves

We then compare prevalence estimates using several different methods and three sources of data. The REACT
data consists of non-overlapping random samples of the population of England at lower-tier local authority level
that were invited to take part in each round of the study based on the National Health Service list of patients. The
Office for National Statistics (ONS) data from Covid-19 Infection Survey
(available at:
https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/datasets/co
ronaviruscovid19infectionsurveydata) is a combination of cross-sectional and (where consent was obtained)
repeated visits to the UK households. For comparability, we restricted the sample to data on England only. The
Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/) estimates reflect the total test positivity for the country’s sources.

graph shows prevalence estimates (in percentage points) over the 12 month of 2020. The blue line depict the ONS
prevalence estimate, the orange line tracks the OWD estimate, and the remaining lines reflect different methods
of prevalence estimation applied to the REACT data. First thing to note is that the REACT weighted prevalence
estimate, the ONS prevalence estimate and the polling estimate we compute using the current symptoms estimates
but with the previous waves virus positivity by symptoms – track each other fairly closely. Secondly, these results
are strikingly at odds with the overall OWD estimate. This is in line with our predictions of different testing
approaches leading to different size of the bias.

APPENDIX C
Bias calculations
The aim is to infer the percentage of sick people in the population from the “random” testing in the field figures,
as released by several Health Agencies worldwide. The problem is that testing is voluntary, which leads to
selection bias. How large is this bias?
To start, some people believe they have symptoms, some don’t: call them S(ymptomatic) and H(ealthy). Note that
the discussion below has to do with what people believe, not what they actually have. Also, we distinguish
between people believing they have symptoms and those who do not, but the analysis readily extends to people
having strong beliefs that they might be carrying the virus and those who do not.
Let the frequency of people who believe they have symptoms be p s, or just p, with 1-p being the frequency of
people who do not think they have symptoms.
Of each group, some percentage turns out having the virus. Let v s be the virus prevalence for those who believe
they have symptoms, vh for those who do not.
Of each group, some percentage are willing to take the test (for a given waiting time to take the test).
Assume this only depends on symptoms, but not on actually having the virus (this assumption is mostly innocuous,
unless there is a very large number of people in hospital). Let then ts be the percentage of people who believe they
have symptoms who actually take the test, and th for those who do not.
True prevalence is then
τ = ps vs + (1-ps) vh

(1)

Given parameters, what number shows up positive in the sample (assuming that the test itself is perfect)
π= ps ts vs + (1-ps) th vh
(2)
Divide by the total sampling rate
m = ps ts + (1-ps) th
(3)
to get the sample prevalence (or virus frequency in the sample population) φ
Note that if ts=th=t, then π = t (ps vs + (1-ps) vh) and φ = t (ps vs + (1-ps) vh)/t = ps vs + (1-ps) vh =τ
which makes sense; if testing propensities are equal, there is no bias.
If on the other hand the testing propensities t are not the same, then the sample is selected, leading to bias.
Before we calculate the bias, express the propensities to test and be virus positive, for the people who believe they
have symptoms, as a multiple of the propensities of those who do not: vs = a vh, ts = b th .
Using these equations, rewrite (1), (2) and (3).
τ = ps vs + (1-ps) vh = a ps vh + (1-ps) vh = vh (ap+1-p)
π = ps ts vs + (1-ps) th vh = ab p th vh +(1-p) th vh = th vh (abp + 1-p)
m = ps ts + (1-ps) th = b ps th + (1-ps) th = th (bp+1-p)
Simplify notation by writing p for ps and calculate
𝜑 = 𝜋/𝑚 =

𝑡 ℎ 𝑣 ℎ (𝑎𝑏𝑝+1−𝑝)
𝑡 ℎ (𝑏𝑝+1−𝑝)

=𝑣 ℎ

𝑎𝑏𝑝+1−𝑝
𝑏𝑝+1−𝑝

Now, to find the size of the bias, divide φ/τ
vh (abp + 1-p) / (bp+1-p) / vh (ap+1-p)
⇨ The bias in prevalence estimates β is
𝛽=

𝑎𝑏𝑝 + 1 − 𝑝
(𝑎𝑝 + 1 − 𝑝)(𝑏𝑝 + 1 − 𝑝)

Examples
Suppose a=1
β=(bp+1-p) /(bp1-p) )/( a p + 1 – p)= 1/(p+1–p)=1
So, both a and b are necessary for the bias to exist, which makes sense conceptually.
Suppose a=b>1
Conceptually it is not unlikely that the two propensities be of similar magnitude, since the higher the risk of
carrying the virus conditional on having symptoms, the more likely it should be people with symptoms seek
testing.
The bias becomes
𝛽=

𝑎2 𝑝 + 1 − 𝑝
(𝑎𝑝 + 1 − 𝑝)2

Let a=b=10
𝛽=

99𝑝 + 1
(9𝑝 + 1)2

This means β=3 at p=0.1, at p=0.05 we still get β=2.7
Assume unequal a and b, but p=0.1. Then
𝛽=

0.1𝑎𝑏 + 0.9
(0.1𝑏 + 0.9)(0.1𝑏 + 0.9)

This function is plotted in the next graph, with a in the x axis, and b in the y axis.

For a=b=20, street testing is overestimating the virus prevalence about 5 times.

Getting ps from φ
While we suggest to get ps through random (unbiased) polling of people about their perceived symptoms, it is also
possible to calculate it using a, b, vh and φ as follows.

Start with the definition of φ=vh (abp + 1-p) / (bp+1-p)
⇨
⇨
⇨
⇨

φ(bp+1-p)=v(abp + 1-p)
φbp+φ-φp= vabp+v-pv
φbp-φp+pv-vabp =v-φ
p(φb-φ+v-vab)=(v-φ)
𝑣−𝜑

⇨ 𝑝 = 𝜑𝑏−𝜑+𝑣−𝑣𝑎𝑏
Note:
The denominator is negative
φb-φ+v-vab<0
=> φ(b-1)>v(1-ab) , since v(1-ab) is negative
=> φ>v(1-ab)/(b-1)
Which is true since b-1 is positive.
For v<φ the numerator is also negative, meaning p is positive.
If φ= vh then symptoms prevalence is 0, all people in the sample have no symptoms, and v h show positive in
the test.
If φ= vs =avh then (v-av)/(avb-av+v-vab)=1, meaning everyone has symptoms, p=1.
Obviously φ cannot be above vs (sample prevalence is highest if you only have people with symptoms in the
sample, in which case not more than vs can be positive)!
So we can debias the health agencies’ numbers without knowing p s
Again, it is easier not to do street testing, but to use vh and vs and poll about p.

Examples
Suppose a=10, b=3 and vh=0.01
⇨ p=(0.01-φ)/(3φ-φ+0.01-0.3) = (0.01-φ)/(2φ-0.29)

So, for example φ=0.1 yields p=-0.09/-0.09=1.
This makes sense. Everyone had symptoms, and v s=0.1 means that 10% had the virus, which is the proportion
you will find in any sample. The interpretation is that with such a low true virus prevalence, the only way to get
a relatively high φ is if there are only symptomatic people.
Suppose a=10, b=3 and vh=0.1
P=(0.1-φ)/(3φ-φ+0.1-3)= (0.1-φ)/(2φ-2.9)
So, in this case, p is about half φ for many values of φ.

Now, let a=3, b=10 and vh=0.1
The effect of a and b is not symmetric.
p=(0.1-φ)/(10φ-φ-2.9)

Getting ps from biased symptoms prevalence in the test
Suppose that some national agency is asking about (perceived) symptoms before testing. It is then easier to debias
and find the symptom prevalence in the general population ps
Symptom prevalence in the test would be
χ= pts / (pts + (1-p)th )= bpth / (bpth + (1-p)th )
=> χ=bp/(bp + 1-p)
So true symptom prevalence is
