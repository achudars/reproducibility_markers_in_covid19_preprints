Abstract
The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted dense urban populations particularly
hard. Here, we provide an in-depth characterization of disease incidence and mortality patterns, and their dependence
on demographic and socioeconomic strata in Santiago, a highly segregated city and the capital of Chile. We find
that among all age groups, there is a strong association between socioeconomic status and both mortality –measured
either by direct COVID-19 attributed deaths or excess deaths– and public health capacity. Specifically, we show that
behavioral factors like human mobility, as well as health system factors such as testing volumes, testing delays, and
test positivity rates are associated with disease outcomes. These robust patterns suggest multiple possibly interacting
pathways that can explain the observed disease burden and mortality differentials: (i) in lower socioeconomic status
municipalities, human mobility was not reduced as much as in more affluent municipalities; (ii) testing volumes
in these locations were insufficient early in the pandemic and public health interventions were applied too late to be
effective; (iii) test positivity and testing delays were much higher in less affluent municipalities, indicating an impaired
capacity of the health-care system to contain the spread of the epidemic; and (iv) infection fatality rates appear
much higher in the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum. Together, these findings highlight the exacerbated
consequences of health-care inequalities in a large city of the developing world, and provide practical methodological
approaches useful for characterizing COVID-19 burden and mortality in other segregated urban centers.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an ongoing public health crisis. While many studies have
described the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 –the virus that causes COVID-19– in North America, Europe, and parts
of Asia [1–5], the characterization of the pandemic in South America has received less attention, despite the severe
impact in many countries during the Southern Hemisphere winter season. While confirmed COVID-19 cases are an
important public health measure to estimate the level of spread of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2, they may not be a
complete indicator of COVID-19 incidence since they may be biased due to population-level health-seeking behavior,
surveillance capacities, and the presence of asymptomatic individuals across regions [6]. Analyses of COVID-19
deaths and excess deaths provide an alternative and potentially less biased picture of the epidemic intensity [7, 8].
This is in part because ascertainment biases may be less pronounced for deaths than for confirmed cases as people
dying from COVID-19 are more likely to have experienced severe symptoms and thus, more likely to have been
documented as COVID-19 positive cases by health surveillance systems. Age specific death data may help explain
the heterogeneity in COVID-19 burden and COVID-19 attributable death numbers observed among different countries
[9]. However, the role of other factors, such as socioeconomic status – which is correlated with health care access– on
the fatality and disease burden, remains an open question [10], especially in highly heterogeneous urban settings.
Here, we analyzed incidence and mortality attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection and its association with demographic
and socioeconomic status across the urban metropolitan area of the capital of Chile, known as ‘Greater Santiago’. To
understand spatial variations in disease burden, we first estimated excess deaths and infection fatality rates across this
urban area. To understand disparities in the health care system we analyzed testing capacity and delays across municipalities. We then demonstrate strong associations of these health indicators with demographic and socioeconomic
factors. Together, our results show that socioeconomic disparities explain a large part of the variation in COVID-19
deaths and under-reporting, and that those inequalities disproportionately affected younger people.

Socioeconomic differences in disease incidence, COVID-19 attributed deaths,
and human movement
The Greater Santiago area is composed of 34 municipalities –defined as having more than 95% of its area urbanized–
and is home to almost 7 million people. While this urban center accounts for 36% of the country’s population, it has
reported 55% of the confirmed COVID-19 cases and 65% of the COVID-19 attributed deaths prior to epidemiological
week 36 (end of August 2020). Socioeconomic status (SES) in the municipalities varies widely, with Vitacura having
the highest value (SES = 93.7) and La Pintana the lowest one (SES = 17.0; Fig. 1A), and this difference is reflected
in the impact of the pandemic during the Southern Hemisphere winter of 2020. The maximum incidence in Vitacura
was 22.6 weekly cases per 10,000 individuals during the middle of May, while La Pintana reported a maximum of
76.4 weekly cases per 10,000 individuals during the first week of June (Fig. 1B). As shown in figure 1C, the attributed
COVID-19 deaths follow a similar pattern, with the highest rate of 4.4 weekly deaths per 10,000 individuals reported
during epidemiological week 24 (second week of June) in San Ramon, a municipality with a SES of 19.7, and less
than 1 weekly deaths per 10,000 in Vitacura. These social inequalities impact the overall COVID-19 mortality rates
as shown in figure 1D.
Changes in human mobility –a proxy for physical distancing– during lockdown periods follow similar patterns. Using
human mobility indicators, inferred from anonymized mobile phone data obtained from the Facebook Data for Good
Initiative, we show that the two municipalities with highest socioeconomic status exhibited a reduction in mobility by
up to 61% during the full lockdown (dark green, Fig. 1E), compared to the ones with lowest SES, which, on average,
reduced their mobility to 40% during the this period (dark pink, Fig. 1E). This relationship between reductions in
mobility and SES was present during all time-periods considered for this study (Fig. 1F) and is consistent with the
hypothesis that people in poorer regions cannot afford to stay at home during lockdowns. Our result is consistent with
analyses of New York City neighborhoods [11] and with findings from other studies conducted in Santiago that used
different socioeconomic and mobility metrics [12–14].

Excess deaths match the dynamics and demographic distribution of COVID19 deaths
Excess deaths –defined as the difference between observed and expected deaths– can provide a measure of the actual
impact of the pandemic in mortality by quantifying direct and indirect deaths related to COVID-19 [7, 8, 15]. We
estimated the expected deaths for 2020 by fitting a Gaussian process model [16] to historical mortality data from the
past twenty years, and used them to identify the increased mortality during to the pandemic, controlling by population
growth and seasonality. As shown in Fig. 2A, the number of deaths observed between May and July 2020 is more
than 1.7 times the expected value, with a peak surpassing 2110 death counts in epidemiological week 24 (first week of
June) compared to an expected value of 802 deaths and an average number of deaths of 798 between 2015 and 2019.
When comparing the number of deaths by age in the year 2020 with our model’s predictions we observe striking
patterns. Although people younger than 40 years old have an overall lower mortality rate than those from older age
groups as expected, they still exhibit a nearly two-fold increase in the total deaths with a peak in the observed deaths
occurring 2 weeks earlier than for those older than 60 years old (Fig. 2B). For the age groups 40-60, 60-80, and older

than 80, the observed deaths are 2.8, 3.2, and 2.4 times higher than expected, respectively. Even though the age group
80+ exhibits the highest expected mortality values for 2020, the group that contains people between 60 and 80 years
old displays the highest weekly count (936 during epidemiological week 24), the biggest deviation from the predicted
values, and the highest values of excess deaths (645 more deaths than expected, Fig. 2B).
COVID-19 attributed deaths for the entire Greater Santiago area fall withing the credible intervals of excess deaths
until late June, when the attributed deaths increase to rates that are even higher than the excess deaths, suggesting that
under-reporting in COVID-19 attributed deaths is unlikely (Fig. 2C). COVID-19 confirmed deaths –those with a PCRconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 test– follow a similar temporal pattern, and the difference between confirmed and COVID-19
attributed deaths gets smaller toward the end of August, indicative of an improved testing capacity. This pattern is
consistent when compared to normalized deaths by population size for each municipality (Fig. 2D), which also shows
COVID-19 attributed deaths higher than the excess deaths in most of the cases. Anomalies of 2020 across different age
groups also display a significant negative association with socioeconomic status, except for the 80+ group (Fig. 2E),
suggesting a higher death burden in lower SES municipalities, independent of their age composition. Furthermore,
the two municipalities with SES higher than 80 (Las Condes and Vitacura) had z-scores of much smaller magnitude
(with the exception of the oldest age group) indicating that there patterns of mortality did not deviate much from what
would have been expected on a normal year in people younger than 80 years old.
Although the observation that COVID-19 attributed deaths are greater than the estimated excess deaths might be
counterintuitive (Fig. 2D), it may indicate the presence of changes in overall mortality patterns due to other causes.
Lower numbers of deaths were reported for respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza and pneumonia, and
cancer during July and August of 2020 compared to the period 2015-2019 (Fig. 2F). Changes in mortality from
respiratory diseases can be explained by a mild influenza season in the Southern Hemisphere during the winter of
2020 [17], which is consistent with our observation that much fewer cases of respiratory viruses have been detected
in Chile during the current season (supplementary materials). A decrease in the number of cancer attributed deaths
can be explained by a competing causes of death phenomenon [18], but additional analyses need to be conducted to
establish this hypothesis. More detailed analyses are presented in the supplementary materials.

Epidemic reconstruction indicates an early under-reporting in low socioeconomic areas
In order to reconstruct SARS-CoV-2 infections over time, we implemented an approach named as RmMAP that back
calculates the most likely infection numbers given the temporal sequence of deaths, the onset-to-death distribution,
and the demography-adjusted infection fatality rate (IFR). Figure 3A shows the outcomes of this inference process,
where the reconstructions from our approach and other methods are able to capture the main peak observed in May
and June, with an estimate of the number of infected individuals that is 5 to 10 times larger than the reported values.
The reconstructions also reveal important differences in the inferred number of infections during March of 2020,
the month in which the virus was introduced in Chile by travellers from affluent municipalities. We analyzed the
number of tests performed between March 8th and April 9th, and find a significantly higher number of tests performed
in municipalities with high SES (Fig. 3B), especially during first two weeks of March (Fig. 3D). In addition, an
early peak of reported cases was only observed in high SES municipalities during middle March, despite the fact that
several COVID-19 deaths, which are lagged with respect to infection by up to several weeks, were reported in low
SES municipalities (Fig.3C) during the same period. These findings suggest that an early first wave of infections
occurred during March and quickly spread through the rest of the city without being captured by the official counts.
Our RmMAP estimates at the municipality level support this claim, as they capture a high volume of early infections
in most municipalities (Fig.3E), an scenario that largely deviates from the official tallies (Fig.3C). To further validate
the hypothesis of an early under-reporting in low SES municipalities, and to rule that these early activity estimates are
an artifact of our method, we performed experiments on a synthetic elementary model of two peaks of different sizes
separated in time (supplementary materials). These experiments confirm that RmMAP is capable of recovering this bimodal phenomena, while other methods fail to do so; they over-smooth the true signal and the earlier peak is typically
not recovered. This early under-reporting signal suggests that the patterns of mortality and testing observed across the
Greater Santiago are partially explained by an early failure of health-care systems in informing the population with
sufficient situational awareness about the real magnitude of the threat [19].

Wealthy areas have conducted more testing with lower waiting times
To further understand the consequences of insufficient early testing, we conducted a deeper analysis of different testing
metrics at the municipality level. We first looked at testing capacity measured as weekly positivity rates, the fraction of
tests that are positive for SARS-CoV-2. Our results show that the positivity signal tracked the course of the epidemic,
peaking at times of highest incidence between May and July, and suggesting a highly saturated health-care system
during this period across the entire city (Fig. 4A). A strong negative association between positivity and SES (Fig. 4B)
further denotes difficulties in access to health care that is even more pronounced in lower SES municipalities. Despite
changes in positivity rates over time, this testing metric also significantly correlated with number of cases (Fig. 4C)
and number deaths (Fig. 4D).
We also analyzed testing capacity by estimating the delays in obtaining test results. We inferred the distribution of the
delay between onset of symptoms and report of the results, from which we obtained the proportion of cases that are
publicly reported within one week since the onset of symptoms or timeliness [25]. As shown in Fig. 4E, timeliness
follows a similar temporal course as test positivity during June. This metric is also associated with SES, suggesting that
municipalities with low SES, on average, get their test results later than the ones with high SES (Fig. 4F). Timeliness
also correlates with number of cases (Fig. 4G), and with the number of deaths (Fig. 4H). Moreover, the negative
strong correlation between timeliness and positivity (r = −0.71, p < 0.01, Fig. 4I), suggests that they can be used to
measure differences in access to health care and are strong predictors of mortality.
Our findings on the number of tests conducted show a rather paradoxical association with SES and mortality. Many
months into the epidemic, the early positive association between tests per capita and SES (Fig. 3B) reversed (Fig. 4J),
and tests per capita started to positively correlate with mortality (Fig. 4K). This result suggests an improvement in
testing capacity over time, so that more tests were performed in more affected areas. However, when looking at tests
per death, a metric that can be used as a faithful proxy of testing capacity [26], we observe a positive correlation with
socioeconomic status (Fig. 4L), indicating that testing disparities persisted during the epidemic, with low SES areas
being affected more. In the supplementary materials we further discuss the associations between our metrics and case
counts.

Infection fatality rate for young people is significantly higher in less affluent
locations
In the absence of serological surveys, a direct inference of an infection fatality rate (IFR) is challenging. The degree
of ascertainment depends on many factors, including testing capabilities and the likelihood of having symptomatic
infections. The lack of age information in the reported cases at the municipality level makes this inference more
challenging. To address these hurdles and to have estimates of the IFR, we implemented a hierarchical Bayesian
model that considers the relationship between deaths, observed cases, and true infections across location, time, and
age group.
We first estimated the case fatality rate (CFR) by assigning total cases into age groups in a simple way that projects the
overall age-distribution of cases to particular municipality demographics (Fig. 5A, see supplementary materials for
details). With the exception of the oldest age group, case fatality rate shows a negative association with socioeconomic
status. Similarly, our resulting IFR estimates once corrected for under-ascertainment display a similar pattern (Fig.
5B) but on an order of magnitude lower than the CFRs. We then grouped the municipalities into four categories of
similar sizes an label them as low, mid-low, mid-high, and high socioeconomic category. The IFR estimates from
this alternative model have a similar trend (Fig. 5C), with a monotonic decrease of the IFR as a function of the
socioeconomic categories, regardless of the inherent uncertainty of our estimates. When comparing the IFR ratio
between the low and the high SES categories, the results show significantly higher infection fatality rate in the low
SES group in people younger than 80 years old (Fig. 5D). The age groups 60-80 and 40-60 exhibit an IFR that are 1.4
and 1.6 times higher respectively in low SES municipalities, compared to the high SES ones. The difference is even
more pronounced in the younger age group (0-40 years old), which shows values of IFR that is almost 3 times higher
for the municipalities with the lowest socioeconomic status. Altogether, these results are in line with the analyses of

Discussion
In order to disentangle the real burden of COVID-19, it is critical to consider demographic and socioeconomic factors
and their consequences for the public health response. Here, we analyzed data from the capital of Chile, a highly
segregated city. Our results align with the recent literature uneven health risks globally, making socially and economically deprived populations more vulnerable to the burden of epidemics [27, 28]. Mounting evidence suggests that such
differences have also manifested in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic [29, 30], and since the pathways modulating these differential outcomes are yet not well-understood, comprehensive accounts are urgently needed [31], so
that more resilient and socially-aware public-health strategies can be planned in advance of forthcoming pandemics.
Current economic losses is forcing people into poorer conditions and likely increasing the inequality even further. In
this context economic decisions can fuel new outbreaks, unless we solve the health problem first improving access
and coverage to people in unequal parts of the country. In Chile, recent studies have suggested a link between SES

and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as stay-at-home orders [12, 13, 32], and our work further
explores this topic by providing an holistic perspective about how the interplay between behavioral, social, economic,
and public-health aspects modulates the observed heterogeneity in infection incidence, and ultimately, in mortality.
Taken together, our results show a strong link between socioeconomic and demographic factors with incidence, mortality, and testing capacity of COVID-19 in urban settings, an association that is manifested as a reinforcing feedback
loop supported by several findings. First, our analysis of human mobility indicates that municipalities with lower
socioeconomic status were less compliant with stay-at-home orders, possibly because people from lower income areas
are unable to work from home, leaving them at a higher disease risk. Second, anomalies in the overall excess deaths
are higher in low SES areas, particularly in people younger than 80 years old, suggesting that poorer municipalities
were hit the hardest. Third, our analyses revealed an early under-reporting of infections in low income areas. Since

public-health measures were taken in response to nominal case counts, these places were under prepared, with a poor
health care response that resulted in higher death counts. Fourth, the analyses of test positivity, timeliness, and tests
per deaths indicate an insufficient deployment of resources for epidemiological surveillance. Higher positivity rates
in health care centers suggest the need for greater testing and detection. At the same time, slower turnaround in test
results can lead to greater potential for transmission, since even small delays between onset of symptom, testing and
final isolation significantly hinder the capability of public health systems to contain the epidemic [33]. Finally, infection fatality rates were higher in lower SES municipalities, especially in young people. This can be explained either by
the lack of access to quality health-care or by a higher prevalence of the comorbidities that associate with more severe
presentations of the COVID-19 disease in socially deprived populations.
Along with the main findings of our work, we also introduced several methodological innovations. To our understanding, the Gaussian process modelling framework for excess deaths is new, and improves upon existing methodology
[7, 8, 34, 35] by allowing a seamless and parsimonious modeling of long-term and seasonal variation in mortality.
Instead of representing seasonal components as individual variables as usual, our model features a continuous representation of time where individual time variances and their covariance is represented by a suited Kernel. Additionally,
the implementation of RmMAP is also new, and represents a balanced solution between the completely unregularized
mMAP method [6, 36] and the expectation-maximization smoothing method (EMS) [37]. Here we have showed the
usefulness of our RmMAP, since reconstructions are smooth enough to be sensible, unlike many instances of mMAP,
but not too smooth so relevant underlying early activity could be missed, as with EMS (see supplementary materials
for details). Our computations of timeliness and delays from publicly available data are original and extend the early
analysis of [13]. Although this analysis is dependent on the idiosyncrasies of the official Chilean epidemiological
surveillance system, we believe our rationale extends to other setups. Finally, our Bayesian method for joint inference
of infection fatality rates and under-reporting signifies an independent contribution, and shows that it may not be necessary to have complete epidemiological datasets (here, age) to draw valid inferences, as long as the solution space is
constrained enough by meaningful priors and demographic structure. Altogether, we believe that our methodological
contributions are valuable for better understanding the impact of past, current, and future infectious disease dynamics.

Materials and Methods

S1.1 Regularized Richardson-Lucy for epidemic curve estimation: the regularized mortality MAP method (RmMAP)
The Richardson-Lucy (RL) Algorithm is an expectation maximization (EM)-type scheme that since decades has been
successfully applied to address the deconvolution problem in fields as medical imaging (Positron Emition Tomography,
PET), and Astronomy. More recently, in has been proposed for epidemic curve estimation: for example, for the
reconstruction of HIV infection curves [38] based on case incidence, and of the 1918 Influenza pandemic [36] based
on mortality time series. The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a renewed interest in this algorithm; indeed, [6] use
RL for a state-wise estimation of the early pandemic course in the US, under the name of mortality MAP (mMAP).
The idea is simple: the date of death is the sum between time of onset of symptoms and the time between onset of
symptoms and death. This relation expresses as a convolution in the space of measures,
Y =X ∗D

(1)

where Y and X are the distributions of deaths and infections, and D is the onset-to-death distribution (assumed
known). Then, given a mortality series Yt that ends at time T , we aim to reconstruct the time distribution of cases Xs
based on our knowledge of D by deconvolving X from (1). The final series of cases cT are obtained by re-scaling the
obtained Xt by the inverse of the infection fatality rate.
In our work we propose a fix for one of the main shortcomings of RL, and in particular, of mMAP: the deconvolution
problem is ill-posed, and the log-likelihood (see (3)) may possess many local optima, which often don’t correspond
to a sensible solutions. Then, it is common that RL iterates progressively deteriorate and become wiggly. This
phenomenon is also called noise-amplification and has been extensively discussed in the signal processing literature
[39, 40].
The remainder of this section is organized as follow: in S1.1.1 we describe in detail the RL algorithm. Then, in S1.1.2
we describe a simple type of regularized RL method, the basis of our RmMAP. We conclude by discussing in S1.1.3
on the role of regularization and the relation between mMAP, RmMAP, and an alternative S1.1.3.
S1.1.1 Richardson-Lucy Algorithm
Suppose counts Yt of observations on a projection space t (t typically represents bins over time, space, etc) have a
Poisson distribution where the parameter depends linearly on a latent process Xs , through the linear operator A =
(at,s ). Thus, we write the conditional distribution of the observed counts given the latent X and A as
!
Yt |A, X ∼ P oisson

The associated log-likelihood writes as

Here, we restrict our treatment to the case where A is of the form at,s = P (t|s) for some kernel of probabilities P . In
this case we can interpret the generative model 2 as the one where particles are emitted on the s space with intensities
Xs . Each
P of them has a probability at,s to appear on t space. Therefore, the observer receives Yt that has the intensity
nt = s ats Xs ; it is the superposition of the processes with intensities ats Xs [41]. The deconvolution problem is the
one of recovering X given observed Y and known P .
Additionally, notice that conditioning on the total

P number observations we can also understand

problem: consider a latent density qs = ns / ns and an observed histogram rt = nt / nt . This histogram rt
is obtained through a simple sampling mechanism: first, observe Q ∼ q, and then, corrupt this variable with a noise

distributed according to P (·|Q) to obtain R ∼ r. Then, solving (3) amounts to finding a clean version of the histogram
r.
The Richardson-Lucy algorithm can be applied to find such estimate X in (2). It is simply an EM algorithm [41, 42]
that iterates between computing the conditional expectations of intensities ats Xs (E step) and maximizing the resulting
expected log likelihood of (2) with respect to these (M step). These two may be written as [43]
• E-step. Compute the conditional expectations Zts of ats Xs given current parameter estimates and Data

• M-step. Maximize the expected (with respect to Zts ) log-likelihood (3)

Notice the denominator in (5) accounts for the fact that ats may not add up to one. This will be critical in our
applications (see below). When combined, the E and M steps (4)-(5) give rise to the Richardson-Lucy algorithm,
which simply states as

RL iterations are seamlessly implemented through elementary linear algebra operations.
As mentioned before, this method can be readily applied for reconstruction of epidemic curves based on mortality data.
Interestingly, in this case the denominator in (5) is simply the probability that someone will die before T , having got
sick at time s. Therefore, RL automatically accounts for right truncation (although in practice performance typically
degrades at the end of the recording period).
S1.1.2 Regularized mortality map (RmMAP)
Here propose to use a simple and scalable modification of (6), originally presented inP[39] in the context of PET
imaging. The idea is to add a quadratic penalty to l(X), so we now maximize l(X) + λ s Xs2 . This leads to a small
change of the M-step, in turn, leading to the following modified Richardson-Lucy scheme

One important question is how to choose the regularization parameter λ. Although this is largely an open question, we
have observed (see S1.1.3) that one sensible approach is to consider a grid of possible values (here, λ ∈ [10−10 , 102 ])
from which we select the best. For choosing the best, we consider two criteria that
Phave to be simultaneously satisfied:
first, curves should be smooth enough, and as a measure of smoothness we take |Xs+1 − Xs |. Also, curves should
provide a good fit to data, and we use the χ2 goodness of fit statistic described in [36]. We have observed that curves
that don’t satisfy this criterion are typically the ones that appear too smooth. In summary, we choose λ such that
the associated smoothness measure is the smallest among the ones for which the goodness of fit criterion is satisfied.
Alternatively, we may choose α by cross validation, as it has been suggested recently [44].
We call regularized mortality MAP, RmMAP the method that consists on reconstructing epidemiological curves based
on mortality data by appealing the procedure just described.

S1.1.3 Experiments and discussion
Effect of initialization and amount of regularization we start by showing, in Fig. S1 the effect of regularization,
and of random initialization. We observe that random initialization leads to more irregular curves. Nonetheless, we
also observe that sensible results can also be obtained by averaging the resulting RmMAP solutions from many seeds
(not shown). In general, the obtained solution will be a compromise between not being excessively wiggly (black
curves, no regularization) or too smooth (pink curves).
Robustness to changes in the onset-to-death distribution in Fig S2 we show reconstructions using two log-normal
onset-to-death distributions from [20]. One of them is the one used in the analysis of the main text, with mean 14.5
and median 13.2 days. The second accounts for right truncation and has mean 20.2 and median 17.1 days. We observe
that reconstructions don’t change substantially from one reconstruction to another, and moreover, that the difference
reconstructions is different than a shift of 5 − 7 days.
Comparison with other methods in Fig S3 we show results for an alternative method, based on expectation maximization smoothing (EMS). EMS was first described in [37] and applied in HIV epidemiology in [38]. EMS iterations
are very similar to RL’s, but the M step (5) is further complemented by a smoothing (S) step where the current curve
X new is filtered by convolution with a bounded support filter that smooths out possible spurious noise (here, we
consider a triangular kernel). We observe solutions given by EMS are similar to the ones by RmMAP, but they are
smoother for all values of k.
Supplemental reconstructions we first show in Figs S4 and S5 a comparison of the reconstructions given by
RmMAP and EMS in the same setup of the main text. Whether RmMAP or EMS provide the most sensible and
whether earlier peaks suggested by RmMAP are bona fide or rather reconstruction artifacts is an open question whose
full answer ideally would make use of additional sources of information.
Experiments with synthetic data Nonetheless, we believe it might be the case that EMS tends to oversmooth, and
RmMAP estimates are more realistic. Our claim is supported by Figs. S6 and S7, where we consider the simplest
possible hypothetical scenario of two peaks: a total of n = 10, 000 cases occur at exactly one of two possible dates;
the first of these events occurs around March 10th, 2020 (t0 ), and occupies a proportion of w < 0.5 of the total
number of cases. The second event follows h days after. We observe that in most of the situations EMS tends to
smooth-out the earliest peak (mostly where w or h are small), but RmMAP tends to recover a most sensible (although
not perfect) solution that at least represents this bi-modal behavior. In Fig. S8 we show additional reconstructions with
the Covidestim method [23]; they also tend to oversmooth the first peak.

S1.2 Gaussian Processes for excess mortality estimation
We performed Gaussian Processes (GP) regression [16] to predict mortality in 2020 and report confidence intervals.
GPs can be understood
Pas an infinite dimensional Bayesian regression: indeed, in usual finite Bayesian regression
settings one fits yi = i wi xi + i where i are symmetric Gaussian i.i.d errors, xi are given covariates and wi the
coefficients, sampled from a prior distribution p(w). In contrast, when using GPs one fits yi = f (xi ) + i where
f is a function sampled from a prior over functions p(f ). GPs are appealing because two reasons: first, as a nonparametric Bayesian method, the level of complexity is automatically adjusted by the complexity of data. Second,
they are computationally tractable,regardless of their infinite dimensional structure.
Priors over f are specified through a kernel K, which is supposed to encode the correlational structure of data. Indeed,
K(x, x0 ) is simply the prior covariance between f (x) and f (x0 ). This kernel may depend on a finite number of
unknowns θ (i.e. K = Kθ ) and a main step to fitting a GP regression model is performing inference over such
unknowns.
In our setup, we used a GP to account for both long-term trends in mortality as well as seasonality. To do so, we follow

the same setup as in [16, Chapter 5]: specifically, we consider a kernels of the form

Finally, we considered a secondary source of unstructured randomness through the term i ∼ N (0, σ 2 ), whose parameter is also fitted. We notice that although it would be more realistic to consider a Poisson or Negative Binomial
link function instead of this Gaussian error, in practice our model provides a good fit to the data, so we keep this more
elementary Gaussian treatment.
We performed Bayesian inference (MCMC) over the parameters (θ, σ 2 ) which are assumed to come from usual prior
distributions with parameters compatible with the scales of the process. Specifically, the length-scale parameters
θ2 , θ4 , θ5 were drawn from

log(θ2 ) ∼ N (10, 0.52 ), log(θ4 ) ∼ N (10, 0.52 ), log(θ5 ) ∼ N (6, 0.52 ),
the variance (strength) parameters θ1 , θ3 were drawn from
log(θ1 ) ∼ N (3, 12 ), log(θ3 ) ∼ N (3, 12 ),
and finally, the unstructured noise term σ was also drawn from
log(σ 2 ) ∼ N (3, 12 ).
In all the above specifications time is represented in days. We implemented our inferences through the R package
Greta.
S1.2.1 Details
We fitted Gaussian processes for daily all-cause mortality data available since 2000 from the Department of Vital
Statistics DEIS). These weekly report contain anonymized individual death data including date of death. We only
considered data up to late August so correcting for reporting delays was not necessary.
We performed separate analysis for each combination of age group (0-40, 40-60, 60-80 and 80+) and each urban
municipality, and we also performed analysis for the entire population (all ages) and the entire Greater Santiago (the set
of urban municipalities). To ensure parameters could be identified, we considered monthly series for all municipalityspecific analysis and weekly series for the analysis of the entire Greater Santiago. To enhance tractability we used the
inducing point method [45] with n = 70 inducing point for weekly series and n = 50 for monthly series.
We used data from 2000-2019 to fit the model and learn the posterior distribution of (θ, γ) sample estimates for 2020
using the usual GP prediction formulae [16] and the inferred posterior. We considered 5 chains and 10,000 samples
per chain, with 10,000 burn-in samples as well.
We visually inspected resulting datasets in order to ensure convergence. On a couple of cases, implausible estimates
were observed in chains with unusually low variance. We discarded such chains and re-run the algorithm. In table
S1 we report an elementary posterior predictive check [46] that suggest inferences are correct. This check consist on
observing the proportion of cases (between 2000 and 2019) that data falls below or above the predicted lower or upper
limits of the 95% credible interval. This number is typically very close to 95%.

S1.3 Delay estimation
Here we describe our methodology for delay and timeliness estimation. Our analysis is based on reports by the epidemiological surveillance system EPIVIGILA, from the Ministry of Health. These were scrapped, and made digitally
available by the Ministry of Science. These reports have the structure described in Fig S9: they provide the number
of cases whose onset of symptom started at a given epidemiological week, for each municipality. Given they are
published twice a week (typically Monday and Friday) we were able to profit from the history of such reports to create
a reporting triangle [25] from which we estimate delays and timeliness.
More specifically, given a certain report R we can estimate the (empirical) probability P (Dr ≤ t), that the retrospective delay is smaller than t days. Here, t = 0, 7, 14, . . . , T or t = 3, 10, 17, . . . T , depending on the day of the week of
the report (Monday or Friday, respectively). by just looking at how cases have been updated. In this way, our timeliness estimate is simply P (Dr ≤ 7), which is obtained from Monday’s reports. Likewise, for a given epidemiological
week W we can estimate the empirical distribution of the prospective delay P (Dp ≤ t), for t = 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, . . . , T
by looking how cases for that week are eventually updated in subsequent reports. We notice a similar analysis has
been previously described in [47]. At the time of developing this method we were unaware of this work.
We chose the maximum delay at T = 50 since we observed delays are typically much smaller. We only report delays
on the period encompassing April 17th, 2020 (the first date for which this analysis is possible) and ending June 15th,
2020. We chose this date because after that reporting frequency changed arbitrarily, and reporting became unreliable
for the purposes of delay estimation.
In order to make our analysis more robust we grouped our empirical probabilities P (Dr ≤ t) and P (Dp ≤ t) in
windows encompassing two weeks. In that way we are able to represent randomness in our estimates: we choose
n = 5, 000 ‘bootstrap samples’, and since windows may contain several P (Dr ≤ t) or P (Dp ≤ t) for the same t, at
each time we randomly sample P (Dr ≤ t) and P (Dp ≤ t) from their possible values. The outcome of this procedure
is sequence of n bootstrap cdfs, where to avoid the problem that these ‘pasted’ pseudo-cdfs may not be increasing, we
hace forced them to be increasing by casting a suitable isotonic regression problem [48].
Additionally, to obtain cdfs defined on the entire temporal daily scale, we further decomposed P (Dr ≤ t) and
P (Dp ≤ t) on sequences P (Dr = t), P (Dp = t) by simply sampling uniformly the remaining probabilities from
the probability simplex (that is, from a Dirichlet distribution with uniform parameter α = (1, . . . , 1)). This procedure
can be understood as simply randomly imputing the day of report or onset of symptom, given the inherent lack of
knowledge since reports are bi-weekly, and cases are available only at the resolution of weeks.

n
As a result, for each period time interval we obtain a the sequences FD

of bootstrap cdfs from which we

can compute expectations, variances, etc, using the usual moment formulae. These moment estimates are naturally
endowed by variance estimates coming from randomness in the n estimates.

S1.4 Infection fatality rate estimation
For the inference of IFR we adhered to the hierarchical Bayesian framework, and deployed a joint model for reporting
rates (and hence, IFR) based on reported cases and tests over time (t, month) and municipality (m), and deaths per age
group (a taking values 0 − 40,40 − 60,60 − 80 and 80+) and municipality (collapsing over the temporal dimension).
We used the age-stratified demographics to cap the possible number of cases and deaths through a cascade of binomial
models. The main appeal of this framework, is that although most of the components are not identifiable (e.g. if
reporting rates and true cases are both unknown, the same observed case counts can be achieved by multiplying both
by the same factor) [49], we can borrow from better known quantities (e.g. rough estimates of prevalence, reporting,
etc) to enhance identification while propagating the appropriate levels of uncertainty over the several parameters.
Specifically, the reporting rate rm,t links to the observed positivity rates posm,t (in log-scale) through a logisticlinear relation (with parameters β), and we have also included random effects m,t to represent unobserved causes of
reporting

These are ultimately multiplied by age specific factors ρa ∈ [0, 1] so that the final reporting rate by age, municipality

Moreover, we assumed the following relation for pm

where the IF Rs follow a stratified logistic-linear relation with socioeconomic status (SES) and age mediated by
parameters α, η, δ:
logit(IF Rm,a ) = α0 + (α1 + ηa ) × SESm + δa .
(17)
We finalize the definition of our model by specifying priors for the remaining parameters. In all cases we consider
Gaussian distributions and apply suitable logistic transformation to enforce them to belong to certain ranges as appropriate. Specifically, by denoting T (a, b) the truncation operator over the interval [a, b] we defined

m,t ∼ N (0, σ2 ),
α0 ∼ N (−2, 1), α1 ∼ N (0, 1),
β0 ∼ N (−2, 1), β1 ∼ N (0, 1),
δa ∼ N (0, σδ2 ), ηa ∼ N (0, ση2 ),

We chose the prior means for α0 , β0 so that they would produce reasonable ascertainment and IFR rates, and the
variances of αi , βi arbitrarily equal to one (we did not observe sensitivity to such choice). For the remaining variances
of the ‘random-effect’- like quantities we used truncated Gaussian priors, that is, all of σ2 , σδ2 , σν2 , σp2 , σρ2 were sampled
from a T (N (0, 1), 0, +∞) distribution. The (logit) prior for ρa was chosen in the range [0, 8] interval so that that agespecific detection rates lied on reasonable ranges, and so that bad-local-optima pathologies would be avoided.

We observed that specifications of the distribution of pm had a large impact on inferences, and that in the absence of
any control over p0 and µm , the resulting posteriors over pm could oscillate too wildly and be unrealistic (e.g. above
50% of infected in some municipalities). Because of this, we treated p0 and l (the maximum possible value for each
µn , as described in (23)) as fixed external parameters and studied the effect of this value over inference, by pooling
(ensembling) the predictions of each model.
For the priors over γ, for each municipality we used a set of T log-Gaussian priors κm,t (one for each month) and
converted them into an element of the simplex by taking a logistic transformation, followed by normalization. This is
an alternative to the usual Dirichlet distribution, that we found to perform better in practice. Specifically,
κm,t
,
γm,t = P
T κm,t

with log(κm,t ) ∼ N (κ̄m,t , σκ2 ).

(25)

We chose the mean parameters κ̄m,t so that in the absence fo noise the resulting γm,t would match the temporal
distribution of cases given by the Covidestim deconvolutions (see Fig. S33). This provides a strong signal that enables
the identifications of the sub-reporting parameters through the discrepancy between inferred and reported cases at each
municipality and time.
In summary, the definition of our model is made up by equations (12)-(25) and all descriptions above. In particular,
our model is specified by
1. A logistic-linear relation for the IFR as a function of SES and age, equation (17).
2. A prior model for the profiles of infections as a function of time, equation (25)
3. Fixed values of p0 , l that modulate the possible values of proportion infected
S1.4.1 Variations
To study robustness of our results to the choice of the model, we considered several variations over the above specifications 1-2. Specifically, we considered two variations over the functional relation of IFR: first, we considered two
alternative models for the IFR as alternatives to equation (17). In the first of them, we added a municipality-specific
random effect υm so we can contrast the inferences of perhaps too simple (17) with this new saturated model. In the
second, we replaced the linear relation (17) by the categorical relation
logit(IF Rm,a ) = α0 + ψq(m),a ,

(26)

where q(m) ∈ {1, . . . , 4} indicates the quartile of municipality m according to its SES; low (1), middle-low (2),
middle-high (3), or high (4). One appeal of this model is that, for each age group a, we can directly compute IFR
ratios of two quartiles q1 , q2 as
logit−1 (α0 + ψq1 ,a )
IF R1a
=
.
a
IF R2
logit−1 (α0 + ψq2 ,a )
Indeed, this is the computation shown in Fig. 5D of the main text.
Additionally, we studied robustness to specification of the temporal profiles in infections, equation (25). Specifically, in
addition to the official specification given by Covidestim, we also used as priors, for each municipality, the inferences
given by our RmMAP (see Fig. S33).

We considered the T = 6 months between March and August. For simplicity, we have ignored right-truncation
effects in the computation of IFRs, but because of the apparent decreases of cases and deaths after July, we
believe the error is negligible. For inference we used the R package Nimble [50], a wrapper of JAGS [51].
We considered all possible values p0 ∈ {−1.5, −1.25, −1.0, −0.75, −0.5, −0.25, 0} (7 possible values) and
l ∈ {0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5} (16 possible values), and for each of them

two different random seeds and three arbitrary different initial conditions for the parameters to ensure the parameter
space was well explored. We chose such values of p0 as they would be consistent to overall estimates of proportion
infected in Chile, around 25% for a comparable period [9]. Considering the 6 = 2 × 3 variations described above,
this gives a total of around K = (7 × 16 × 2 × 4) × (2 × 3) ≈ 5300 possible configurations, and we refer to each of
them as a separate model. For each of these models we obtained posterior draws using two chains, each with 100,000
burn-in samples and 20,000, samples which where thinned with an interval of 40.
S1.4.3 Model averaging and checking
We combined the resulting models by appealing to the usual Bayesian model averaging (BMA) framework [52].
Specifically, let Y denote the data, ∆ be a quantity of interest (e.g. an IFR) and Mk a model. We averaged the models
posteriors according to the formula
p(∆|Y ) =

K
X

p(∆|Y, Mk )p(Mk |Y ).

(27)

k=1

The posterior likelihood of the k-th model, wk = p(Mk |Y ) can be hard to compute, as it necessitates the calculus
of the marginal likelihood of the data given that model. Here we follow a pseudo-BMA strategy [53], and instead
of explicitly computing the weights wk we approximate them with a suited model evaluation quantity. We used the
WAIC (widely applicable or Watanabe-Akaike information criterion) [54] because it is readily available in the Nimble
framework. Specifically, we used the following approximation for the weights (under the convention that WAIC is
defined as a deviance-like quantity, i.e. with a −2 factor and with lower values of WAIC indicating a better fit):
wk ≈ P

1
W AICk )
exp(− 2τ
.
1
k0 exp(− 2τ W AICk0 )

(28)

Notice that we have included a temperature parameter τ . The main goal of this simple heuristic is to include an appropriate number of models in the average, as we preliminary observed that choosing τ = 1 (the original prescription)
leads to the average of only two models; i.e. wk = 0 in the vast majority of cases. Although our official estimates
always correspond to τ = 1, by considering a suitable value of τ we can explore how our results are sensible to the
choice of better or worse models. Notice that in the limit of τ = ∞ we give an equal weight to each model, and in
the limit of τ = 0 we only select the model with the lowest WAIC. Therefore, by letting τ move freely we are able to
explore the continuum between ’only the best model is selected‘ and ‘all the models are given the same weight‘, with
the official pseuso-Bayesian averaging criterion being an intermediate point.
In terms of Bayesian modeling, our heuristic is justified by the necessity to accounting for the facts that Bayesian
averaging methods i) are not valid in the M−open setup (i.e. when the models are misspecified, as they are inevitably
in our case), and ii) they ignore uncertainty over the data generating distribution, which is different from the observed.
We defer the reader to [53] for somewhat more involved alternatives for better Bayesian model averaging.
S1.4.4 Experiments and discussion
Model averaging with τ Fig. S34A illustrates the heterogeneity in WAIC in our data, while Fig. S34A depicts the
role of τ (equation 28) for model averaging; if τ is too small only one model is taken into account, and if τ is too large
then the mixture is uniform over models.
Role of the prior over γ on ascertainment inference In S38A we show that the averaged models infer a negative
relation between ascertainment rates and positivity. Additionally, in S38B we observe that Covidestim predictions
lead to negative coefficients for the under-reporting rate, while the ones based on RmMAP are positive. This implies
that models with Covidestim as prior are may perform better and weight more in the mixture of models. If we
assume the most natural interpretation that positivity and ascertainment rates should be negatively correlated, we
conclude that Covidestim reconstructions are more faithful for this analysis. This might be a consequence of the
fact that i) Covidestim takes positivity rates as an input so data might be implicitly being used twice, and ii)RmMAP

reconstructions tend to spread the mass too uniformly over the months that encompassed the peak (around May-July,
see Fig. S33). This observation suggests a direction for further improvements in RmMAP reconstructions, but we
emphasize that the validity of our previous analysis (Fig. 3 in the main text) have to do with a very localized setup (the
early peaks in March), and therefore it is not compromised by these findings.
Posterior predictive checks As sanity checks we studied the extent to which our fitted models were able to produce
data similar to the one observed. In Fig. S37 we show predicted and observed cases (as in [25]) and deaths for
our mixture of models. We note that similar results are obtained for individual models as well (not shown), and for
mixtures. but also include deaths and showed that that fitted model is compatible with the observations in that the
credible intervals of key quantities cover the true values in the vast majority (if not all) of cases. Additionally, in Fig.
S37C we show the median of the random effects m,t and observed they are typically close to zero.

S2.1 Socio-economic status
In our sociodemographic analyses we considered as covariate socio-economic status (SES). We defined this number
as SES = 100 − SP I, where SPI is the social priority index (indice de prioridad social, in Spanish) [55] a composite
index (between 0 and 100) that has been developed by the Ministry of Social Development (Ministerio de Desarrollo
Social, in Spanish) for the Region Metropolitana since 1995. The SPI is an actionable indicator; it equally weights
the three dimensions of income, and access/quality of education and healthcare to produce a ranking in a way that
a high SPI indicates that a municipality is of priority for the social programs of regional government because of its
lack of resources. Therefore, our definition of SES is consistent with the fact that a relatively low SES indicates that a
municipality is at an disadvantaged condition with respect to higher SES’ ones.

S2.2 Viral surveillance
We scrapped the official records of viral surveillance from the institute for public health (ISP) (see for example, [56])
and tabulated total number of test performed and positives in Region Metropolitana, both in the entire population and
over the hospitalized subpopulation. In Figs. S13 and S14 we show descriptive summaries of viral circulation over
time. These made clear that 2020 has been unusual in terms of both cases and tests.

S2.3 Mortality data reliability
For our excess mortality analysis we looked for additional confirmation to ensure our data was reliable. First, in
Table S3 we show total numbers of deaths in the Greater Santiago up to August 30th, as reported in four different
subsequent reports. There is little variation, suggesting that the reports have stabilised and our analysis is not corrupted
by reporting delays.
Specifically, in Fig. S15 we show monthly reported deaths according to DEIS (our official data for analysis) and the
Civil Registry. We observe these quantities are historically close to one another, and this agreement also holds for
this year, suggesting that DEIS data is reliable if Civil Registry data is reliable. We further confirmed the reliability
of the Civil Registry data by looking at historical birth series in Greater Santiago, also provided by the Civil Registry
(see Fig. S16). We do not observe gross changes in birth recording, indicating reliability. Notice we did not use Civil
Registry data for our analysis as deaths are tabulated by the municipality of death, and not of residence.

S2.4 Causes of death
To better understand the seeming COVID-19 death over-reporting (Fig. 2C-D in the main text) we analyzed trends of
individual causes of mortality. In Fig. S17 we show the total deaths (between March and August) from the 16 most
significant causes of death. Additionally, in Fig. S18 we show the four more dominant causes; circulatory, respiratory,
digestive and cancer in all age groups. These all exhibit a somewhat unusual pattern for the 2020 calendar year, with
seemingly fewer deaths than expected in the oldest age groups. Further, in Figs. S19, S20 S21 and S22 we show
trends for individual sub-causes for each of these grand-causes, and in Figs S23 and S24 we show deaths at the weekly
resolution for some sub-causes of death of respiratory and circulatory causes, so seasonality can be looked at in more
detail. Altogether, these Figures help explain the over-reporting phenomenon: first, fewer recorded deaths by cancer
in 2020 could be the result COVID-19 appearing as the cause of death in some cancer patients. second, the lack of a
peak for deaths by respiratory causes in 2020 (Fig. S23) suggests that either some seasonal respiratory deaths could
have been misatributed as COVID-19 or by a truly lower number of respiratory deaths in 2020. Our data on viral
surveillance supports the later hypothesis, as lower deaths by Influenza and Pneumonia coincide with lower numbers
of viral circulation (Figs. S13 and S14). However, the hypothesis that surveillance systems might have missed other
viruses in 2020 because on the focus on COVID-19 is an alternative plausible explanation that cannot be ruled out by
our analysis and deserves further study.

S2.5 Extended excess mortality analysis
To support and supplement the analysis of excess deaths in the main text, here, in Figs S25-S29 we display the monthly
observed deaths in the 2000-2020 period with their corresponding GP estimates, for each age group and each urban
municipality. Likewise, in Fig. S30 we show the corresponding historical data and estimates for the entire Greater
Santiago. These estimates are the basis for the calculations shown in Fig. 2 of the main text. In table S1 we show the
coverage probabilities (the proportion of times that deaths before 2020 fell within the predicted 95% credible intervals)
for each of the municipality and age specific GP model. These tend to be close to the nominal 95% value, indicating
that the method is well-calibrated. Additionally, in Fig S31 we extend the time-varying excess death calculations (Fig.
2C in the main text) to all age groups. Finally, in S32 we extend Fig. 2E of the main text: we show z-scores for
individual months (and not only their total, as in the main text) and we also consider the alternative measure of relative
deviation in mortality from what was expected.

S2.6 Extended case reconstructions
In order to reconstruct SARS-CoV-2 infections over time, we implemented an approach that back calculates the most
likely infection tallies given the temporal sequence of deaths, the onset-to-death distribution, and the demographyadjusted infection fatality rate (IFR). Our method –referred to as RmMAP in the subsequent paragraphs– is a regularized modification of the mortality MAP (mMAP) method introduced in [36] and further investigated in [6] for
COVID-19, that circumvents a well-known and undesired noise-amplification phenomenon in its original version.
Operationally, RmMAP corresponds to a penalized [39], most likely de-convolution infection estimate [42]. For our
analyses, we considered the log-normal onset-to-death distribution described in [20] and two demography-stratified
IFR estimates, one from Diamond Princess cruise ship [21] and from a seroprevalence study in Spain [22]. For comparison, we also present reconstructions based on the Covidestim method [23], and by the re-scaling of case counts by
the under-reporting estimates obtained with the method of [24]. Details are shown in S1.1.
Fig. S33 we supplements Fig. 3A of the main text, by providing reconstructions of cases in all municipalities of
Greater Santiago. Notice these reconstructions are also used in some models for our IFR estimates (see S1.4)

S2.7 Delay estimates
In addition to the reported timeliness (Fig 4 in the main text), we estimated mean delays according to the method
described in S1.3. Results are shown in Fig. S10, where we show series of weekly estimates for the Greater Santiago,
Fig. S11, where we show these estimates at the municipality resolution, and Fig. S12, where we show the bootstrap
of distribution of the mean delay at different two-week intervals using the procedure described in S1.3

S2.8 Extended IFR estimation analysis
Our methodology (described in (S1.4)) is inspired by ideas from [25] and [57] in that first, we leverage a proxy for
ascertainment (here, positivity rates) to map the recorded cases into true infections. Second, the use of simple linear
relations for the quantities within the model (here, the relation between socioeconomic status and IFR) help us smooth
out the observation noises. Third, by using suitable priors we are able to borrow information on quantities we are
more certainty about, and study how changes in such quantities affect inferences (sensitivity analysis). Fourth, we
profit from the heterogeneity in the demographic composition of municipalities to inform and further constrain model
inferences. We refer the reader to the supplementary materials for details on our models, inference methods and
sensitivity analyses.
The main limitation of our methodology is that IFRs cannot be fully resolved if there is much uncertainty on ascertainment rates, age distribution of cases and prevalence (i.e., the proportion that has been infected), and therefore,
the uncertainty in our IFR estimates inherits from uncertainty in these quantities. To address this limitation we have
considered an ensemble of different models with different values (strong priors) for the prevalence across municipalities, each leading to different IFR estimates (see S1.4). Our displayed results are a Bayesian average of such models
[58], and therefore are supposed to be more robust [52] as they take into account the uncertainty in model choice,

although at the price of wider credible intervals. By using a temperature parameter τ we show in Figs. S35 and S36
that although there is certainly variation from model to model, the main message (the relation between IFR and SES)
persist regardless of the model. Indeed,we have performed our inferences under different structural relations in our
model, and results have proven stable under such changes.
As a sanity check, we also compared our estimates of IFR with those available from other countries, and find them
consistent [21, 22]. Nonetheless, our sensibility analysis is not immune to possible misspecification of the age distribution of cases across municipalities, and we deem this as a potential source of bias. This may be specially critical
in the youngest age group; there, only a few deaths have been observed, and therefore, our IFR estimates may be
particularly unstable to changes in our assumptions. Instead of conducting additional analysis, we recognize the need
for further confirmation of our results in a future study where ages of each confirmed case are available.

S2.9 Estimation of proportion infected
In S39 we show our estimates of proportion infected on each municipality until late August, 2020. We compare
Covidestim with the two methods based on a fixed IFR (from Spain and Diamond Princess, used in RmMAP) with
our method that jointly estimates proportion infected and IFR (S1.4). There is a clear and consistent (across methods)
negative correlation between proportion infected and SES.

S2.10 Association between case counts, timeliness and positivity
In Fig. S41 we extend the analysis of Figs. 4C and 4G in the main text. Specifically, in the main text we show a
strong association between weekly case counts and weekly positivities and timelinesses, indicating that timeliness and
positivity are relevant real-time proxies of the burden of the epidemic. In S41 we average all quantities over time
(weeks), and show that correlations persist, although they are attenuated, as averaging destroys the time-dependent
correlational structure between cases and our measures.
This new correlation analysis is comparable with the ones for mortality (Figs 4D and 4H in the main text), and the
final message is that the pattern of correlations between positivity, timeliness and the outcome is consistent regardless
of whether we use cases or death as our outcome measure.

S2.11 Case fatality ratio estimation
For estimating case-fatality ratios, we divided total cases for each municipality into age-strata in the following way:
first, we looked at the age-distribution of cases, which was only available at the country level. From this distribution
we compute the marginal proportion of cases among all individuals in the population, pa , for each age group a
pa = P (Case|Age = a) =

Ca
,
Pa

where Ca and Pa are the total of cases and individuals in the country. Then, for municipality m we computed the
probability that a case came from group a using the Bayes rule,
wm,a = Pm (Age = a|Case) ≈

pa × Pm (Age = a)
P (Case|Age = a)Pm (Age = a)
=P
.
Pm (case)
a pa × Pm (Age = a)

In words, we take the country-level likelihoods of cases for each age group as templates, and project them into muP
nicipality specific weights using the municipality-specific demographics represented by Pm (Age = a) = Pm,a
, the
m
proportion of individuals in municipality m that belongs to age group a. To obtain age-specific municipality cases we
then simply multiply Cm,a = wm,a Ca .
We note that in our estimates we did not use any involved method for correcting for right-truncation. We justify our
decision by the fact that by late August, 2020, i) the epidemic had a much smaller magnitude than at its peak, ii)
enough cases and deaths were already registered so that the simple cases/death ratio was a quantity that was already

stable. In Fig. S40 we show alternative estimates where we consider different recording periods t and offsets ∆
t+∆
between death and cases so that we can more generally estimate CF Rt,∆ = death
casest . Altogether, these estimates
give an idea about possible uncertainty of our estimates around their true value, and since we observe that the CF Rt,∆
don’t fluctuate much, this uncertainty is small and conclude that right-truncation biases don’t systematically and/or
substantially affect our main conclusions.

Figure S5: Comparison between RmMAP and EMS for the reconstruction of epidemic municipalities in the Greater Santiago.
While RmMAP recovers an early peak in many municipalities, this is not the case with EMS, whose reconstructions tend to suggest
a single peak.

Figure S6: Results of a synthetic scenario for RmMAP. Each plot represents a different configuration of h (separation between
peaks) and w (relative size of the earliest peak). Dashed vertical gray lines indicate magnitude of two point event (cases, on a
different scale shown on the right y-axis) and dashed black line indicates the distribution of observed deaths, the convolution D ∗ S
between the onset-to-death distribution D and the sum S of the two point events, S = nw1t0 + n(1 − w)1t0 +h . Coloring of solid
lines is analog to Fig S1. We observe that in the majority of cases there is a range of valid regularization parameters λ leading to
reconstructions that account for the two peaks, i.e. RmMAP does perform well. For simplicity we have assumed IF R = 1.

Figure S10: Mean delay (days) between onset of symptoms to public report in Region Metropolitana. Shading indicates 95%
confidence interval. We consider retrospective (aligned to date of report) and prospective (aligned to onset of symptoms). Since
reporting occurs only twice a week, prospective report is biased to be larger than the retrospecive one. Our analysis encompasses
only until early June, 2020, since in mid June public data appeared heavily corrupted, making estimation more virtually impossible.

contributor. During winter seasons positivity also tends to rise. For the 2020 winter season the amount of tests, diagnosis and
positivity have been unusually low. B: Data is available for 7 respiratory viruses, whose activity and share of positives fluctuates

Figure S32: Relation between Z-scores and social priority index for different age groups. This figure supplements Fig 2E in
the main text: here, B is exactly Fig 2E but we show Z-scores of each month, instead of the entire period. On A and C we show
an alternative to the z-score: the % of change with respect to what was expected for this year. The uncertainty that otherwise is
captured in the z − score is now reflected in the length of the confidence intervals (see for example [34]) for this quantity. More
specifically, C is analog with B with this alternative measure, while A shows the overall change, collapsing all months.

Figure S33: Reconstruction of true epidemic curves at municipalities of Greater Santiago. This figure supplements the reconstructions in the main text (Fig. 3A) by displaying results for all municipalities, for all methods and a longer period. We compared
our regularized Richardson-Lucy method using two age-stratified IFR (from Spain and Diamond Princess) with the off-the-shelve
Covidestim [23] and Russell’s [24] method.

Figure S34: Mixture of models. B histogram of WAICS (that we use as a proxy for model weights) show heterogeneity. B CDF
of model weights for different temperature (τ ) values. Our model averaging criterion is based on a tempering of the WAICS. Here,
we show that if τ is too small only one or two models are effectively weighted, and as we increase the temperature more models
are chosen until eventually all models are weighted equally.

Figure S35: Robustness analysis for IFR linear model (equation (17), with or without the spatial random effect υm ). A IFR as a
function of SES, for different model averages (τ ); Fig. 5B in the main text corresponds to τ = 1. B the sign of α1 + ηa indicates
whether IFRs are decreasing as a function of SES. We show that for all model averages (τ ) this coefficient is significantly smaller
than zero in all age groups with the exception of the oldest, where the relation is unclear. C Similar to B, but now we show boxplots
of relevant percentiles of this coefficient where each model contributes with a sample.

IFR ratio between lowest and highest SES groups

Figure S36: Robustness analysis for IFR categorical model (equation (26)). A IFR (95% credible interval) as a function of SES
strata, for different model averages (τ ).B IFR ratio between lowest and highest SES strata as a function of τ (Fig. 5C in the main
text corresponds to τ = 1). C For completeness, we also show IFR ratio between middle-low and middle-high SES strata. The
effects here appear attenuated and more often are not significant.

Figure S38: Estimation of ascertainment rates. A Inferred proportion of cases reported (with 95% credible bands) as a function
of positivity rates for our mixture of models. B Boxplot of relevant percentiles for the coefficient b1 ,indicating the strength of the
relation between log-positivity and logit ascertainment. For models whose prior on γ is based on Covidestim estimates the inferred
relation is always negative, and the opposite (less intuitive) pattern emerges when using RmMAP.

Figure S40: Stability of CFR estimates for slighly different designs. We show lump CFR estimates at the municipality level
(marginalizing over age information) using slight variations of the naive cf rt = deathst /casest formulas, where t represents the
oldest date until which casest and deathst are recorded. To acknowledge the possibity of bias in estimated CFR because of right
truncation, we computed the ratios with an offset of ∆ after t, so that this new CFR estimate may better grasp deaths that would
occur in the future.
