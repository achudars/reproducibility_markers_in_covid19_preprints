Abstract:
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and Italy has caused 6088
cases and 41 deaths in Republic of Korea and 3144 cases and 107 death in Italy by 5
March 2020. We modeled the transmission process in Republic of Korea and Italy
with a stochastic model and estimated the basic reproduction number R0 as 2.6 (95%
CI: 2.3-2.9) or 3.2 (95% CI: 2.9-3.5) in Republic of Korea, under the assumption that
the exponential growth starting on 31 January or 5 February 2020, and 2.6 (95% CI:
2.3-2.9) or 3.3 (95% CI: 3.0-3.6) in Italy, under the assumption that the exponential
growth starting on 5 February or 10 February 2020. Estimates of dispersion term (k)
were 10 (95% CI: 5-56) or 22 (95% CI: 8-61) in Republic of Korea, and 13 (95% CI:
5-61) or 37 (95% CI: 13-61) in Italy, and all of which imply few super-spreading
events.

1. Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first emerged in Wuhan, China in the end
of 2019 and spread to more than 60 foreign countries as of 1 March 2020 [1]. On 20
January 2020, the first imported COVID-19 case was detected in Republic of Korea,
and the epidemic curve appeared steadily until 15 February. In the second half of
February, the number of reported cases increased rapidly with more than 1200 cases a
week. As of 5 March 2020, there were 6088 cases confirmed including 41 deaths [1].
In Italy, the first case was reported on 6 February 2020 and the epidemic curve was
steadily by 21 February. Then the number of reported cases soared rapidly,
reaching 3142 reported cases and 107 deaths until 5 March 2020 [1]. To date, there
are 14768 confirmed cases in the world except China, which means that more than 60
per cent of cases outside China are from Republic of Korea and Italy [1].
In this study, we modelled the early outbreak of COVID-19 in Republic of Korea and
Italy to estimate the basic reproduction number under different exponential growth
starting date.
2. Methods
We collect time series of reported COVID-19 cases in Republic of Korea from 20
January to 1 March 2020 and cases in Italy from 5 February to 5 March 2020.
Following [2,3], we assumed that number of secondary cases associated with a
primary COVID-19 case follows a negative binomial (NB) distribution, with means
R0 and dispersion parameter k [3]. Here, the R0 is the basic reproduction number of
COVID-19. The k measures the likelihood of occurrence of super-spreading events
(or other factors) which could vary the growth rate. If k is smaller than 1, these data
indicate occurrence of super-spreading events (larger proportion of ‚Äòsuper-spreaders‚Äô
or ‚Äòdead-ends‚Äô in infected individuals) or some other factors which could vary the
growth rate; otherwise if k is larger than 1, these data do not indicate occurrence of
super-spreading events [4].
The onset date of each secondary case is the summation of the onset date of the
primary case (t) plus the serial interval (SI). In this work, the SI was assumed as a

Gamma distribution with a 4.5-day mean and a 3.1-day standard deviation (SD) [5-8].
The transmission process was simulated stochastically.
Since the number of early reported cases are stable, which appears no sign of the
outbreak in January 2020, we consider the sustaining exponential growth might start
since February 2020. Hence, we simulated the exponential growth starting on
‚Ä¢

31 January and 5 February 2020 for Republic of Korea

‚Ä¢

5 February and 10 February 2020 for Italy

with one seed infection. The R0 and k were estimated by the maximum likelihood
estimates approach that fit the reported cases with Poisson-distributed likelihood
framework as follows.
ùëô(ùúÜ) = log ‚Ñí (ùúÜ) = ‚àë4567 log ùëì(ùëõ. ; ùëÖ1 , ùëò).

(1)

Here, the l(¬∑) is the overall log-likelihood and T is the total number of days since the
start of exponential growth. The nt represents number of cases reported on t-th day. We
calculated 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) by using the profile likelihood estimation
approach determined by a Chi-square quantile.
3. Results and discussion
In Table 1, we estimated the R0 in Republic of Korea at 2.6 (95% CI: 2.3‚àí2.9) and 3.2
(95% CI: 2.9‚àí3.5) with the transmission starting date on 31 January and 5 February
2020, and the R0 in Italy at 2.6 (95% CI: 2.3-2.9) and 3.3 (95% CI: 3.0-3.6), with the
transmission starting date on 5 February and 10 February 2020. Estimates of
dispersion term (k) for Republic of Korea were 10 (95%CI: 5-56) and 22 (95%CI: 861), under the assumption that the exponential growth starting on 31 January and 5
February 2020, and for Italy were 13 (95% CI: 5-61) and 37 (95% CI: 13-61), under
the assumption that the exponential growth starting on 5 February and 10 February
2020, all of which were consistent with [3] and suggested the unlikelihood of
superspreading events.
Fig 1 showed that the fitting results matched the observed number of cases well. Our
estimated R0 in Republic of Korea is relatively higher than that in Shim et al.‚Äôs [9],
which set the exponential growth starting date on 20 January 2020 and the onset date
data were considered. Here we use laboratory confirmation date data which covered

both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. In addition, the R0 estimates from two
countries were largely consistent with those estimates based on the epidemic curve in
China [10,11]. If there were evidences suggesting that the exponential growth started
earlier, we note that the R0 estimates would decrease. Public activities in the late date
and cold weather in our study period could have speed up the transmission which
explains the higher estimates.
The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in Republic of Korea and Italy could be amplified
due to large-scale gathering activities [12,13]. Without public health control or selfprotective measures, the epidemic was likely to grow in a relatively large rate. The R0
estimates and the rapid growth of epidemic curves both indicates the disease
transmissibility. Thus, control measures as well as self-administered protective
actions are crucial to reduce the transmissibility of COVID-19 and thus mitigate the
outbreak size and prevent for further burden. Given the superspreading is unlikely to
occur, we can be confident to control the COVID-19 outbreak by reducing the
reproduction number to below unity.
