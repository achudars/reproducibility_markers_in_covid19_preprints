ABSTRACT

52

Objectives: The extent to which people implement government-issued protective measures is critical in

53

preventing further spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

54

Our study aimed to evaluate the public belief in the effectiveness of protective measures, the reported

55

implementation of these measures in daily life, and to identify communication channels used to acquire

56

relevant information on COVID-19 in European countries.

57

Design: A cross-sectional online survey available in multiple languages was disseminated on social media

58

starting March 19th, 2020. After five days, we computed descriptive statistics for countries with more than

59

500 respondents. Each day, we compiled and categorized community containment measures enacted in

60

each country by stringency (stage I-IV). Response collection continued for one week to explore possible

61

dynamics as containment strategies intensified.

62

Participants: In total, 9,796 adults responded, of whom 8,611 resided in the Netherlands (stage III), 604

63

in Germany (stage III), and 581 in Italy (stage IV). An additional 1,365 respondents completed the survey

64

in the following week.

65

Results: Participants indicated support for governmental measures related to avoiding social gatherings,

66

selective closure of public places, and hand hygiene and respiratory measures (range for all measures:

67

95.0%-99.7%). Respondents from the Netherlands were less likely to consider a complete social lockdown

68

effective (59.2%), compared to respondents in Germany (76.6%) or Italy (87.2%). Italian residents did not

69

only apply enforced social distancing measures more frequently (range: 90.2%-99.3%, German and Dutch

70

residents: 67.5%-97.0%), but also self-initiated hygienic and social distancing behaviors (range: 36.3%-

71

96.6%, German and Dutch residents: 28.3%-95.7%). Respondents largely reported being sufficiently

72

informed about the COVID-19 outbreak and about behaviors to avoid infection (range across countries:

73

90.2%-91.1%). Information channels most commonly reported included television (range: 53.0%-82.0%),

74

newspapers (range: 31.0%-63.0%), official health websites (range: 39.0%-54.1%), and social media

75

(range: 40.0%-55.8%). We observed no major changes in answers over time.

76

Conclusions: In European countries, the degree of public belief in the effectiveness of protective

77

measures was high and residents reported to be sufficiently informed by various communication channels.

78

In March 2020, implementation of enacted and self-initiated measures differed between countries and

79

were highest among Italian respondents, who were subjected to the most elaborate measures of social

80

lockdown and greatest COVID-19 burden in Europe.

INTRODUCTION
The recent pandemic of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe

84

Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) has infected more than 1,000,000 people worldwide in only a

85

few months’ time and caused more than 51,000 deaths as of April 2nd, 2020[1]. This rapidly spreading

86

virus imposes a tremendous burden on national healthcare systems, as they lack sufficient material and

87

human resources to respond to the rapidly increasing number of patients requiring intensive care[1,2].

88

Worldwide, public health organizations, as well as national and international government bodies, have

89

suggested systematic implementation of protective, public health measures in an effort to delay the spread

90

of COVID-19[3]. The aim of these measures is to decrease the peak infection rate, while maintaining a

91

high quality of care under finite resources and limited hospital capacities[2,4]. In addition to basic

92

hygienic advice such as regular hand washing, the most important recommendation known to limit and

93

delay the spread of the virus is social (physical) distancing[5,6].

94

In early March 2020, Europe became the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, with more cases

95

and deaths reported than in all other countries (excluding China) combined[1]. Throughout the course of

96

the month, most European countries progressively implemented community isolation measures to increase

97

social distancing, such as imposing work restrictions and the closure of public places and shops. Italy, the

98

first and most severely affected country in Europe, imposed strict community isolation measures on March

99

9th and 11th, 2020, enforcing a nationwide quarantine in response to the alarming increase in the number

100
101

of cases, which posed a serious threat to the capacity of the Italian healthcare system[7].
The extent to which people are informed about and apply the measures advocated by experts and

102

enforced by governments is critical to control the spread of the virus and to optimize patient outcomes

103

during the current COVID-19 pandemic[4,8,9]. The aim of our study was to evaluate public belief in the

104

effectiveness of protective measures, to what extent individuals have implemented these measures in their

105

daily lives, and to identify key communication channels used to acquire information on COVID-19 in

106

European countries. We believe these insights are not only valuable for the ongoing mitigation of the

107

current COVID-19 pandemic, but may also serve to inform governments’ and public health organizations’

108

information dissemination and infection control strategies for possible future pandemics.

METHODS

110

Design, setting, and participants

111

The survey instrument used to gather cross-sectional data was compiled by a team of medical

112

students and epidemiologists from the Leiden University Medical Center and the Charité -

113

Universitätsmedizin Berlin. Our initial aim was to collect sufficient data on adults living in Europe, with

114

an emphasis on individuals residing in the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy, however, the survey was also

115

open to residents of other countries. Data collection is still ongoing and is planned to continue for as long

116

as community isolation measures remain in place. In these primary descriptive analyses, we only reported

117

data from countries with at least 500 responses at our first cut-off date, March 23rd, 2020. This date was

118

chosen because several European regional and national governing bodies announced stricter measures

119

around this date. The study was reviewed and granted exempted status from medical ethical approval by

120

the Institutional Review Board of Leiden University Medical Center in The Netherlands (protocol number:

121

N20-037).

122

Survey instrument

123

We selected questions from the validated Flu TElephone Survey Template (FluTEST), which was

124

designed to assess perceptions and behavior during an influenza pandemic [10]. We slightly modified the

125

items to fit the current outbreak context, where necessary and formulated additional questions to assess

126

beliefs in the effectiveness of protective measures [11]. In brief, the survey instrument consisted of 22

127

items in three sections including: 1) five questions regarding beliefs in the effectiveness of public

128

measures to reduce outspread (e.g. selective closure of places and complete social lockdown), 2) 16

129

questions on the personal application of protective measures (e.g. social distancing behaviors and hygienic

130

practices), and 3) one question on the three most frequently used sources to acquire information on the

131

COVID-19 outbreak, and one question on the perception whether or not respondents felt sufficiently

132

informed. The full survey is presented in Supplemental Text 1. To allow for stratified interpretation of the

133

results, additional questions captured sociodemographic information about gender, age, household

134

composition, employment status, educational level, country of residence, being a healthcare provider or

135

(bio)medical student, and prevalent chronic medical conditions. Respondents were able to complete the

136

questionnaire only once per device in an effort to reduce potential repeat responses.

137

The survey was translated into multiple languages by a small panel of native speakers from the

138

original English language version. Due to time constraints, we were unable to formally validate the survey

139

questions in the other languages. The survey went live on March 19th, 2020 in Dutch, English and

140

German. Other languages have been added since initiation (Italian on March 20, 2020; French and Polish

142

2020; see Supplemental Text 1).

143

Procedures

144

The full survey was initially piloted on a sample of 50 respondents. After minor modifications to

145

the structure and language, the survey was actively disseminated through (social) media channels, such as

146

WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter, and in professional networks via

147

electronic mailing lists. The survey was further promoted via a number of local and national news

148

websites and radio stations. On the landing page, participants were briefed about the study and only those

149

providing informed consent for participation were guided to the actual 5-minute survey. On the final page,

150

participants were debriefed about the study, and thanked for their contribution.

151
152
153

Assessment of stages of community containment measures
We extracted community containment measures taken by governments in each country included

154

in this study from national governmental announcements and news articles and compiled daily from

155

March 1st, 2020 onwards. Two independent researchers classified stringency of isolation measures by

156

country in four stages based on the Community Containment Measures guideline originally developed by

157

the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the SARS outbreak in 2003[12]. Any

158

disagreement was resolved by discussion. The CDC guideline describes seven interventions, which we

159

grouped into four stages to create country-specific timelines for the purposes of this study. Guideline

160

interventions 1 (passive monitoring), 2 and 3 (active monitoring without and with activity restrictions,

161

respectively) were grouped together as Stage I (“Low Impact Containment Measures”), since most

162

countries had already implemented these interventions in early March 2020. Guideline interventions 4

163

(working quarantine) and 5 (focused measures) were grouped and classified as Stage II (“Focused

164

Measures to Increase Social Distance”), as many countries applied these interventions simultaneously. We

165

designated intervention 6 as Stage III (“Community-Wide Measures to Increase Social Distance”) and

166

intervention 7 as Stage IV (“Widespread Community Quarantine, Including Cordon Sanitaire”). We

167

detailed and justified the daily stage classification by country in a series of timelines (Supplemental Tables

168

1a-1d; Supplemental Text 2).

169

Statistical Analyses

170
171

Data collected over a five-day period between March 19th, 2020 and March 23th, 2020 at 11:20
AM (UTC+0), were used in the primary analyses. We present results of the survey items including

172

sociodemographic characteristics using descriptive summary statistics for the countries having more than

173

500 responses during this primary data collection period (the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy). Nominal

174

variables were described and visualized using frequencies and percentages. We also reported frequencies

175

of missing responses. We present stratified results for the assessed sociodemographic variables only for

176

the Netherlands, as the number of responses was sufficient per individual subgroup. No formal statistical

177

comparisons were made between countries since the primary aim was descriptive and there were no a

178

priori testable hypotheses.

179

As a secondary analysis, we explored changes in responses for items about the beliefs in the

180

effectiveness of these measures and their implementation over time. As for items about implementation of

181

protective measures, we reported the proportion of positive answers (“Yes”) out of all responses,

182

excluding responses indicating the question was not applicable to their situation. Similarly, for items about

183

the belief in effectiveness of these measures, we considered the proportion of positive answers (“Probably

184

true”). To easily visualize the change over time, we modeled the proportions for each item and for each

185

country separately, using generalized additive models with time as the independent variable, using a

186

shrinkage version of cubic splines with three knots. In addition, we computed and presented visualizations

187

of the differences in proportion between the responses recorded during the primary data collection period

188

and the weeklong extension only for the Netherlands.

189
190

Data management, analyses and visualizations were conducted using Stata 16.1 (StatCorp LP,
College Station, TX) software and R 3.6.3 / RStudio 1.2.

RESULTS

193
194

Between March 19th and 23rd, 2020, a total of 9,796 respondents completed the survey. Three

195

countries met our study inclusion criteria of more than 500 respondents; the Netherlands (n=8,611),

196

Germany (n=604), and Italy (n=581) (see flowchart: Figure 1). During this primary data collection period,

197

the containment measures in the Netherlands and Germany met criteria for Stage III classification

198

(“Community-Wide Measures to Increase Social Distance”), and those in Italy met Stage IV criteria

199

(“Widespread Community Quarantine”).

200

Most respondents opened the survey link via WhatsApp or Facebook (Figure 1). Approximately

201

two-thirds of respondents were female and one-third of respondents were aged 21-30 years old (Table 1).

202

The majority of respondents had a paid job (57.1%) and many had tertiary academic degrees (68.2%)

203

Approximately 18% of respondents were healthcare providers or (bio)medical students. Less than one-

204

fifth of respondents reported suffering from a chronic illness or being in poor medical condition (17.3%).

205

Descriptive sociodemographic characteristics stratified by country of residence are presented in Table 1.

206
207

Sources used to acquire information on the COVID-19 outbreak

208
209

Among respondents living in the Netherlands, Germany, or Italy, the most frequently used sources

210

to obtain relevant information included television (e.g. news, range: 53.0%-82.0%), newspapers or news

211

applications (range: 31.0%-63.0%), social media (e.g. Facebook and Twitter, range: 40.0%-55.8%), and

212

official health websites (range: 39.0%-54.1%). Other people (e.g. family, friends and colleagues, range:

213

23.9%-26.7%) and radio were reported less frequently as sources of information (range: 5.3%-26.7%). In

214

all three countries, healthcare professionals (range: 4.3%-7.6%) and official health hotlines (range: 1.2%-

215

1.6%) were the least frequently reported sources of information (Table 1). Almost all respondents living in

216

these three countries reported being sufficiently informed about the current COVID-19 outbreak and what

217

they could do to prevent an infection (range: 90.2%-91.1%; Table 2).

218
219

Belief in the effectiveness of measures to reduce outspread

220
221

The majority of respondents believed that avoiding social gatherings, selective closure of public

222

places and locations, hand hygiene measures, and respiratory measures were effective ways to prevent

223

further spread of COVID-19 (range for all measures in all three countries: 95.0%-99.7%; Table 2). Only

224

59.2% of respondents in the Netherlands perceived a complete social lockdown or isolation measures as

225

effective, compared with 76.6% of respondents from Germany and 87.2% from Italy (Figure 2 and Table

226

2).

227
228

Individual implementation of protective measures

229
230

For all items, the percentages reported in the text and Table 3 excluded respondents to whom the

231

item did not apply, which was especially important in the interpretation of three items (keeping children at

232

home before any mandates were put in place, range: 41.0%-75.1%; reducing the use of public transport,

233

range: 1.9%-28.5%; and going to school/university/work, range: 2.4%-14.9%). With regard to personal

234

protective behaviors, a high number of respondents from the Netherlands and Germany reported to have

235

washed their hands with soap and water more often than usual (range: 95.0%-95.7%). In general,

236

respondents from Italy reported applying all proposed personal protective behaviors more often than those

237

from the Netherlands or Germany, except for following a healthy diet or using vitamin supplements

238

(36.3%, Netherlands 54.5%, Germany 54.4%) (Figure 3 and Table 3).

239

Behavior related to limiting interactions with people was fairly similar between countries,

240

although respondents from Italy reported more frequently cancelling or postponing social events (98.8%,

241

compared with 94.8% in the Netherlands and 97.0% in Germany) and avoiding crowded places more

242

frequently (99.3%, compared with 92.4% in the Netherlands and 93.8% in Germany). Respondents living

243

in Germany reported avoiding people with cold or flu-like symptoms (81.1%) less frequently than

244

respondents living in Italy (90.2%) or in the Netherlands (89.0%). Regarding behaviors related to avoiding

245

travel, respondents from Italy more often reported to have reduced the amount they went to school or

246

work (94.4%, compared to 88.0% in the Netherlands and 84.9% in Germany, of public transport use

247

(98.6% compared to 89.6% in the Netherlands and 91.3% in Germany), and of going to shops (97.7%,

248

compared to 81.4% in the Netherlands and 67.5% in Germany) (Figure 3 and Table 3). Responses to

249

questions concerning limiting interactions and avoiding traveling may reflect both imposed restrictions

250

and respondents’ awareness and willingness to follow protective measures. Therefore, we additionally

251

asked respondents whether they kept children at home prior to formal mandates to assess the percentage of

252

respondents that applied measures on their own accord. Of those indicating the question was applicable to

253

their situation, in Italy, 60.6% kept their children at home before protective measures compared to 53.6%

254

in the Netherlands and 58.1% in Germany.

258

Although we conducted no formal comparisons between the sociodemographic subgroups of

259

participants, some patterns were evident (Supplemental Tables 2a-2r). In general, while there were no

260

meaningful differences in the degree of belief in the effectiveness of protective measures among gender

261

groups, females applied these measures most frequently. Among the different age groups, the belief in the

262

effectiveness of a complete social lockdown differed (e.g. ≤ 20 years: 47.5%, 21-40 years: 62.7%), as well

263

as among subgroups with different daily activities (e.g. retired: 55.4%, homemaker/unemployed: 64.7%)

264

and different education levels (primary/secondary: 54.6%, tertiary academic: 61.1%). Chronically ill

265

patients more frequently reported exhibiting protective measures than respondents without any chronic

266

diseases. Different sociodemographic subgroups used different sources of information to obtain

267

information related to the COVID-19 pandemic. With higher age, the percentage of respondents who

268

agreed they felt sufficiently informed was higher (for example: ≤ 20 years: 87.0%, versus > 60 years:

269

94.9%)

Change in responses over time

273
274

Immediately following the primary data collection period, we continued collecting data over the

275

next seven days (March 30th, 2020, 11.40 AM, UTC+0) and received responses from 1,588 additional

276

participants, of whom 1,365 reported living in the Netherlands (n=858), in Germany (n=413) and in Italy

277

(n=94). In general, we observed no substantial changes over time (Supplemental Figures 1a-1b), except

278

for a decrease in the belief of effectiveness of a complete social lockdown in Germany (Supplemental

279

Figure 1a). Furthermore, among respondents from the Netherlands, we observed a small increase in the

280

percentages of respondents indicating they believe in the effectiveness of preventive measures (range: 0%-

281

5%) and those indicating they implemented these measures (range: 0%-10%) across both data collection

282

periods (Supplemental Figures 2a-2b).

DISCUSSION
Our findings indicate that in three European countries, the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy, the

285

public belief in the effectiveness and the actual implementation of certain protective measures during the

286

ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in March of 2020 was high. Furthermore, residents reported to be

287

sufficiently informed about the ongoing pandemic using various communication channels.

288

The public belief in the effectiveness of protective measures was highest among respondents

289

residing in Italy, which had the most extensive measures of social lockdown as well as the highest

290

numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Europe in March 2020. Compared to the Netherlands and

291

Germany, respondents living in Italy most often reported not only exhibiting behaviors related to

292

government imposed restrictions but also voluntary hygienic and social measures. Although in general,

293

more than 90% of respondents indicated belief in the effectiveness of imposed measures of social

294

distancing, a complete social lockdown was deemed effective by only 59% of respondents residing in the

295

Netherlands (compared to 77% in Germany and 87% in Italy), where at the time of survey completion,

296

only lighter social distancing measures were enforced. The results of our study suggest that the level of

297

community containment measures implemented by national governments may be rapidly visible in the

298

public beliefs about protective measures, the extent to which people actually exhibit these relevant

299

behaviors, and reflect the severity of the outbreak situation in a given country.

300

To the best of our knowledge, to date, few data on this topic are available. Results from two

301

recently published survey studies conducted in the USA, the UK, and China primarily focus on the

302

respondents’ knowledge about COVID-19 and assess understanding pertaining to the disease

303

course[13,14]. Furthermore, another study conducted between January 24th and February 13th, 2020

304

among 1715 Hong Kong residents showed that most respondents obtained information on the COVID-19

305

pandemic from social media and websites[15]. We found that traditional information sources (e.g.

306

television and news) were used most frequently among our respondents. Our study further corroborates

307

and adds to these first findings with similar results regarding beliefs in the effectiveness of hygienic and

308

social distancing measures and the extent to which these measures were exhibited in a European study

309

population.

310

Social distancing and other behavioral measures

311

Individuals’ adherence to country-specific mitigation measures has the potential to influence the

312

course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Social (physical) distancing has been proposed as one of the most

313

effective measures for mitigating pandemics caused by viruses, including COVID-19[4,7,16]. Large-scale

314

simulation studies have found that closure of borders is only effective to prevent further spread of the

11

315

virus if they are implemented for more than two weeks and prevent international travel [8]. Moreover, the

316

peak attack rate can be decreased by case isolation, household quarantine, and school, university and work

317

closure[8].

318

As the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is estimated to be similar to or higher than

319

previous coronaviruses such as SARS, social isolation measures are particularly important [17,18]. In the

320

current COVID-19 pandemic, models have shown that the Wuhan quarantine reduced transmission of

321

COVID-19 cases from mainland China to other countries by 77% by early February [9]. Besides social

322

distancing, other behavioral protective measures have also been deemed effective in the mitigation of the

323

current pandemic. For instance, regular hand washing may result in a reduction of peak infection rate up to

324

65% with a delay of 2.7 months and a 29% decrease in total infection rate[19]. Generally, preventive,

325

precautionary behavior is more commonly observed, in females, and in older persons [20–22], which was

326

also reflected in our findings from Europe during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

327

Provision and acquirement of information during pandemics

328

Transparent, timely, and easy-to-understand information is essential to increase trust in national

329

governments during pandemics[23]. The increasing use of portable devices and social media is evident in

330

our findings, which indicate frequent use of social media to acquire pandemic-related information (range

331

across countries: 40.0%-55.8%). However, in recent epidemics and pandemics, a substantial amount of

332

online information, especially distributed via social media, was found to be incorrect and

333

misleading[24,25]. Environmental cues to follow behavioral recommendations, favorable attitudes

334

towards prevention measures, and knowledge about the virus were associated with exhibiting protective

335

behavior[5]. Therefore accurate information provision via social media channels is crucial, besides

336

information via traditional information sources.

337

Study strengths and limitations

338

Given the evolving pandemic situation, we felt it was important to develop, translate, and

339

disseminate our questionnaire rapidly to capture a snapshot of public perceptions and behaviors in ‘real

340

time’ as the COVID-19 crisis unfolded in Europe and as policy makers enacted formal containment

341

measures in several European countries. Many items in our survey were adapted from an existing

342

validated questionnaire created to assess perceptions and behaviors in response to influenza[10]. We

343

attempted to make our survey accessible to participants of diverse backgrounds by providing the survey in

344

eight languages. These translations could be readily adapted for use in future studies on other viral

345

pandemics.

346

Readers should consider some important limitations when interpreting our findings. First, since

347

the survey was web-based and recruitment was largely through digital channels including social media, we

348

acknowledge the potential for selection bias. We cannot assume that our study population is representative

349

for the individual countries and acknowledge possible over-representation of health-conscious individuals

350

and those more informed or concerned about the outbreak. However, under the exceptional current

351

circumstances, members of the general public who normally would not participate in health-related

352

surveys may be more likely to participate given the media attention, severity, and the outbreak’s large

353

impact on many aspects of daily life. Furthermore, with the social (physical) distancing recommendations

354

and enforced measures in place, many confined to their homes have turned to social media and other web-

355

based platforms for social communication, including those belonging to the older age groups.

356

Second, the number of completed survey responses was much higher among residents of the

357

Netherlands compared to Italy or Germany. Since the majority of our research team members are based in

358

the Netherlands and the largest dissemination efforts occurred there, this is not surprising. Third, while the

359

governments of Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands enacted different mitigation measures in each

360

country, our survey was not adapted to country-specific nuances. Hence, we acknowledge that our results

361

might not fully depict whether residents of these countries actually exhibit their country-specific

362

measures. Fourth, we cannot rule out that an individual completed the survey more than once on multiple

363

devices, in another browser, or by clearing cookies; however, repeat submissions from the same device

364

were not accepted.

365

Fifth, with regard to the secondary analysis over the extended data collection period, we observed

366

no major changes in the aggregated answers over time; however, we acknowledge a possible delay

367

between the implementation of formal community isolation measures and the subsequent information

368

uptake and application of these measures by residents. During the extended data collection period,

369

response rates were lower than in the primary collection period, especially from respondents living in

370

Italy.

371

Finally, we emphasize the aim of our study was descriptive, and we caution readers against

372

drawing causal conclusions regarding the observed differences. A formal comparison between countries

373

would require appropriate analytical consideration of variables taking into account sociocultural

374

(including educational systems), political, and structural contexts in each country. In an effort to help the

375

reader better understand each country-specific setting we included information about the stage of

376

containment measures enacted within the included countries in a timeline encapsulating the data collection

377

period.

CONCLUSION

380

The extent to which individuals internalize and respond to (government-mandated) mitigation

381

measures and recommendations is critical to the control of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and to

382

optimize outcomes during the current COVID-19 pandemic. In our survey study of the general public

383

living in the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy, we found that approval and application of publicly enforced

384

and self-initiated protective measures were highest in Italy, the region with the most extensive measures of

385

social lockdown and highest burden (number of cases and deaths) in Europe, during the study time period

386

in mid-March, 2020. Media channels used to acquire information and the extent to which respondents felt

387

sufficiently informed about the COVID-19 pandemic differed per country and among sociodemographic

388

subgroups in the Netherlands. No substantial changes in the perceived effectiveness of behavioral

389

protective measures and the implementation of these measures in these countries were observed between

390

March 19th and March 30th, 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic continued to evolve in Europe and formal

391

community isolation measures became stricter. We believe these insights are valuable to inform the

392

information dissemination and infection control strategies of governments and public health organizations

393

during the current crisis and also for future pandemics.
