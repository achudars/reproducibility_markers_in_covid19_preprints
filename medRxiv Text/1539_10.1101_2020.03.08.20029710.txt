ABSTRACT

Background: The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in China began in
December 2019. Studies on novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were less based on
pediatric patients. This study aimed to reveal the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in
children.
Method: This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical symptoms, laboratory results,
chest CT, and treatment of children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19(ie, with
samples that were positive for 2019 novel coronavirus[2019-nCoV]) who were admitted
to Shenzhen Center of National Infectious Disease Clinical Medical Research from
January 16 to February 8, 2020.
Result: Nine patients had no obvious clinical symptom. 11 patients developed fever.
Other symptoms, including cough(in eleven of seventeen patients), rhinorrhea(in two),
diarrhea(in two), vomiting(in two), were also observed. A small minority of patients had
lymphocytopenia. Alanine transaminase or transaminase increased in three cases.
According to chest CT scan, 11 patients showed unilateral pneumonia, 8

patients had

no pulmonary infiltration. No serious complications such as acute respiratory syndrome
and acute lung injury occurred in all patients.
Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection in children were
different from adult. The overall condition of children were mild and have a good
prognosis.

BACKGROUND

Pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei,
China and then the epidemic broke out. It was defined by the World Health Organization
as “an international public health emergency of public concern” [1, 2]. Recently, many
researches in the lancet reported the epidemiological, clinical symptoms, laboratory data,
imaging features, treatment methods and clinical outcomes of non-pregnant adults and
pregnant women infected with 2019-nCOV[3, 4]. However, the clinical characteristics
of children have not been well disclosed, and whether there are differences in treatment
methods has not been determined. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 28
children with COVID-19 tested positive for 2019-nCOV by use of RT-PCR on samples.
METHOD
Patient information
We reviewed 26 cases of children(>1 year old and <14 years old) in the Third
People’s Hospital of Shenzhen from January 16 to February 8, 2020. Diagnosis of
COVID-19 was based on the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control
Program(6th edition) issued by the National Health and Health Committee of China[5].
The study was approved by the instututional of research ehtics committee of the Third
People’s Hospital of Shenzhen ([2020-063]).
Data collection
We collected the clinical manifestations, laboratory results, chest CT, treatment methods,
and outcomes of 26 children, and the data was updated until February 19. To ensure the
accuracy of the data, the data were independently checked by two clinicians. Each

patient signed a written informed consent. We collected respiratory, blood, and digestive
tract specimens from children for examination. All samples were processed
simultaneously at the department of Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and
Prevention(CDC) and the hepatopathy institute of National Infectious Disease Clinical
Medical Research Center(The Third People’s Hospital of Shenzhen).
Statistical Analysis
SPSS 22.0 software was used for statistical analysis. The data were tested for
normality(One-sample kolmogorov-smirnov test, KS test). We present continuous
measurements as mean (SD) if they are normally distributed or median (IQR) if they are
not, and categorical variables as count (%).
Result
Investigations into the sources of exposure indicate a history of contact with person
from Hubei or family clusters in each case. There were 9 males (35%) and 17 females
(65%), with an average age of 6.9 (0.7) years, ranging from 1 to 13 years (table 1). None
of the above children had underlying diseases such as congenital diseases, dysplasia,
diabetes, etc. Because some children cannot expresss independently, the clinical
symptoms were mainly objective symptoms. Most patients had fever and cough at
admission. About one-third of the patients had no clear symptoms, and other symptoms
included vomiting, diarrhea, and rhinorrhoea (table 1). According to the standard,8
cases(31%) were mild and 18(69%) were ordinary. No severe complications such as
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI) occurred in the
cases. Laboratory results revealed that most of the blood routine showed normal or
decreased white blood cell counts, lymphocytes generally increased, and hemoglobin

and platelets were mostly unaffected (table 2). There were no significant abnormalities
in coagulation function. In terms of biochemistry, Alanine transaminase (ALT) combine
with glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST) increased in two cases(8%),ALT or AST
increased in one case(4%).In addition, all the above cases had not exceed 50% of the
normal high value. Most of the myocardial enzymes(myoglobin, troponin, kinase,
creatine kinase) were not abnormal, with only a significant increase in LDH(46%). In
the field of inflammatory mediators (table 2), procalcitonin was normal, and 5(19%)
patients had elevated C-reative protein. 19 patients were tested for interleukin-6 and
only one had an increase. T-lymphocyte subset analysis showed no abnormalities in
CD3+CD4+/CD3+CD8+.Humoral immunity showed that IgA, IgG, and C3c were
partially reduced (table 2), and IgM and C4 were normal. According to chest X-ray and
chest CT examination, 8 patients(31%) had no pulmonary infiltration. There were 11
cases(42%) of lateral pulmonary infiltration and 7 cases(27%) of bilateral pulmonary
infiltration.
All patients were treated in isolation. Medicines for treating COVID-19 include
oseltamivir, ribavirin, interferon, kaletra and traditional Chinese medicine.4 patients
(15%) were treated with interferon alone and 1 patient (4%) was treated with kaletra
alone.26 patients discharge (13.6±1.03 days on average) or improvement after treatment.
DISCUSSION
There was no significant increase in inflammatory indexes and mild clinical
symptoms in 26 patients, all of them were mild and common type cases, no severe
pneumonia cases and death cases, and the outcome was similar to that of SARS. Among
them, 11 patients (about 42%) had fever, which was inconsistent with 98% of the

clinical symptoms of adult patients reported in [2,3]. Other symptoms such as nasal
obstruction, runny nose, vomiting and diarrhea [1,3,6] were less common than adults.
All of the above suggest that the clinical symptoms of children infected with 2019-CoV
were not typical. It is considered that most of the children might be infected after
exposure to patients with COVID-19, which belongs to the second or third generation of
infected cases, and the pathogenicity of the virus is decreased.
In addition, the changes of leukocytes in children were the same as in adults, and
most of them appear normal or decreased. Lymphocytes in adult patients had decreased
significantly, and this study found that most of the children's lymphocytes increased
beyond the normal range, which might be related to the higher percentage of
lymphocytes in white blood cells in the process of children's growth and development,
and then gradually decreased towards adults. This might also indicate that 2019-ncov
produces a series of immune responses in the body through the respiratory mucosa, and
children's lymphocytes had not significantly decreased, thus failing to induce a cytokine
storm. Chen N et al.[3] studied the imaging characteristics of 99 adult 2019-CoV
pneumonia patients in Wuhan area and found that 75% of patients had double
pneumonia, and the remaining 25% of patients had single pneumonia. We found that 8
of the 26 children did not have pneumonia, 7 (about 27%) had bilateral pulmonary
infiltration, and 11 (about 42%) had unilateral pulmonary infiltration. It can be seen that
the CT manifestations of children are quite different from that of adults, and
complications such as ARDS have not been found in children in China so far, which can
indirectly reflect that children are not easy to induce not prone to induce cytokine storms.
The literature reported that the prognosis of elderly patients and those with chronic

underlying diseases is poor, which was presumed to be associated with low immunity [3].
We know that most T cells develop in the thymus. In this study, the prognosis of children
with COVID-19 was good, and the prognosis was different from that of middle-aged and
elderly patients in other studies. Consider that the difference was related to thymic
immune function. In the treatment of SARS patients, drugs such as glucocorticoids and
thymosin were used [7]. Although there was no clinical evidence to support the use of
glucocorticoids [8], whether early use of thymosin and gamma globulin for
immunomodulation in patients with severe and critical COVID-19 can reduce cytokine
storms, reduce clinical symptoms and improve prognosis requires further exploration.
Except that LDH increased in the myocardial zymogram of children with COVID-19 in
the study, other enzymes such as creatine kinase and troponin I were normal. In addition
to being derived from the heart muscle, LDH was also found in the liver and kidneys.
We speculated that the increase in LDH may not originate from the myocardium,
suggesting that children's infections were less likely to affect the myocardium. Similar to
other studies [1, 3, 4], this study found that ALT and AST increased, so we cannot rule
out the effect of 2019-nCoV on the liver and induce the increase of liver enzymes. As
patients often use antiviral drugs in the early stage of hospitalization, it was also
necessary to consider the increase of liver enzymes caused by drug factors. Angiotensin
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) had been shown to be one of the main receptors that
mediate the entry of 2019-nCoV into human cells [9, 10], while ACE2 was at high
expression levels in the kidney, vas deferens

and testicular mesenchymal

cells[11] .SARS had been shown to cause orchitis and affect spermatogenesis function
[11, 12].Although acute renal impairment had not yet occurred in pediatric cases,

children with COVID-19 must be alert to potential risks and follow-up on reproductive
function after discharge from hospital.
Patients in this study were tested with the 2019-nCOV nucleic acid test. The
specimens included nasopharyngeal swabs, blood, sputum, and anal swabs. We found
that nasal swabs and anal swabs were positive even without respiratory symptoms such
as cough and gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea Therefore, the
source of samples cannot be selected based on clinical manifestations, and should be
submitted multiple times and at multiple sites to avoid misdiagnosis of patients with
mild imaging without imaging manifestations. Although there is no clinical evidence
that the virus is transmitted through the conjunctival pathway [13], mother-infant, and
breast-milk[4], researchers have detected the virus in urine [14], saliva [15], suggesting
that novel coronavirus has a wide range of transmission routes.
The clinical classification of children was mostly mild or ordinary type, so the
treatment plan is relatively simple. In some cases, the nucleic acid test turned negative
after treatment with interferon atomization or lopinavir ritonavir. For mild children,
symptomatic treatment or single use of traditional Chinese medicine needs to be further
verified.
The sample size of this study was only 26, and it was a retrospective study, so it has
certain limitations. On the one hand, the article only included children aged 1-14 years.
The characteristics of newborns infected with COVID-19 are not clear, and whether
there are differences in the disease characteristics of infants, preschool and school-age
children need further research; On the other hand, the changes of T lymphocyte subsets
in children need to be tracked and observed during the course of the disease.

In summary, COVID-19 children showed asymptomatic or mainly respiratory
symptoms such as fever and dry cough, some of them have digestive tract symptoms,
and their clinical symptoms are mild. In our study, the clinical types were mild and
common, and the probability of severe complications such as myocarditis and ARDS
was low, which provided important information for understanding the clinical
characteristics of children with COVID-19.
