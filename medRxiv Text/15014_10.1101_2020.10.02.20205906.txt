Summary: To increase statistical power and meet vaccine success criteria, we propose to
evaluate the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines by using the dual or triple primary endpoints of
SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic COVID-19, and severe COVID-19.
Abstract: A large number of studies are being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety
of candidate vaccines against novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Most Phase 3 trials have adopted virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease as the primary
efficacy endpoint, although laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 is also of interest. In addition, it is important to evaluate the effect of vaccination on disease severity. To provide
a full picture of vaccine efficacy and make efficient use of available data, we propose using
SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic COVID-19, and severe COVID-19 as dual or triple primary endpoints. We demonstrate the advantages of this strategy through realistic simulation
studies. Finally, we show how this approach can provide rigorous interim monitoring of the
trials and efficient assessment of the durability of vaccine efficacy.

Introduction
There is an urgent need to develop effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the global COVID-19 pandemic. Several candidate vaccines have shown strong immune
responses and acceptable safety profiles and have moved rapidly into large-scale Phase 3
trials.1−8 As of December 8, 2020, a total of 28 Phase 3 trials on 13 candidate vaccines
have been launched around the world.7 Through Operation Warp Speed, the US government has selected several of these candidates for Phase 3 testing, including mRNA vaccines
encoding the prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (mRNA-1273, BNT162b1)2,3 ,
a recombinant replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus expressing a wild-type SARSCoV-2 Spike protein (AZD1222)4 , a recombinant, replication-incompetent adenovirus type
26 (Ad26) vector vaccine encoding a stabilized SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (Ad26.COV2.S)5 ,
a SARS-CoV-2 recombinant stabilized Spike protein vaccine with AS03 adjuvant, and a
SARS-CoV-2 recombinant stabilized Spike protein nanoparticle vaccine (SARS-CoV-2 rS)
with Matrix-M1TM adjuvant.6
The vaccine regimens have generally protected against COVID-19 disease endpoints in
animal models5 and have induced binding and neutralizing antibody responses to vaccineinsert Spike proteins in most vaccine recipients, exceeding response levels seen in convalescent sera.2−4,6 The antibody marker endpoints are of the types that have been accepted
as surrogate endpoints for many approved vaccines9 , generating enthusiasm that the vaccines can plausibly confer protection. Interim results from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and
AstraZeneca/Oxford University suggested high vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 disease.
Rapid introduction of effective vaccines in the US and other countries with high numbers
of COVID-19 cases would be a major step toward halting the global pandemic. However,
deployment of a non-effective vaccine could actually worsen the pandemic because public
acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine might diminish the implementation of other control measures. Thus, we need speedy and reliable evaluation of the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines
on the basis of clinically relevant endpoints.

Most Phase 3 trials have adopted virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 illness as the primary efficacy endpoint, although laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 is also
acceptable.10 It is possible that a vaccine is much more effective in preventing severe than
mild COVID-19. Thus, we should also evaluate the effect of vaccination on severe COVID19.10 However, a large sample size is likely required for a trial using a severe COVID-19
endpoint.
We propose using SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic COVID-19, and severe COVID-19
as triple primary endpoints or using SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptomatic COVID-19 or
symptomatic COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 as dual primary endpoints, the specific choice
depending on the expected incidence of the three events and on the targeted vaccine efficacy
for the three endpoints. This approach incorporates more evidence on vaccine efficacy into
decision making than using only one of the three events as the primary endpoint. It can
improve statistical power and increase the likelihood of meeting vaccine success criteria, thus
accelerating the discovery and licensure of effective vaccines.
Methods
We consider the endpoints of SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic COVID-19, and severe
COVID-19, referring to them as infection, disease, and severe disease, respectively. Suppose
that a large number of individuals are randomly assigned to vaccine or placebo and that the
trial records whether or not each participant has developed each of the three endpoints by
the end of follow-up, as well as their length of follow-up.
We formulate the effect of the vaccine on each of the three endpoints through a Poisson
model. Although investigators are mainly interested in the first occurrence of each event,
the Poisson modeling approach provides a reasonable approximation to the data because
the event rates for all three endpoints are relatively low. We define the vaccine efficacy in
terms of the proportionate reduction in the event rate between vaccinated and un-vaccinated
individuals.
The criteria for claiming that a vaccine is successful should be strict enough to ensure

worthwhile efficacy. A vaccine whose efficacy is higher than 50% can markedly reduce incidence of COVID-19 among vaccinated individuals and help to build herd immunity. An advisory panel convened by the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended 50% vaccine
efficacy for at least 6 months post vaccination as a minimal criterion to define an efficacious
vaccine.11 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance defines vaccine success
criteria as a point estimate of vaccine efficacy at least 50% and the interim-monitoring adjusted lower bound of the 95% confidence interval exceeding 30%.10 The FDA guidance
criteria do not specify a minimum period of follow-up. However, given the intent of current
vaccine development to identify efficacious vaccines within several months of trial initiation, the expectation seems to be reliable evidence for vaccine efficacy over approximately 6
months, consistent with the WHO recommendation.
Many Phase 3 trials specify assessment of vaccine efficacy over longer-term follow-up as
an important study objective. The FDA guidance document states that “A lower bound
≤ 30% but > 0% may be acceptable as a statistical success criterion for a secondary efficacy endpoint, provided that secondary endpoint hypothesis testing is dependent on the
success on the primary endpoint.” This statement refers to earlier FDA guidance on a
fixed-sequence testing method,12 under which vaccine efficacy is tested against a sequence
of secondary endpoints in a pre-defined order, where tests of each endpoint are performed
at the same significance level (one-sided type I error of 2.5%), moving to the next endpoint
only after a success on the previous endpoint. The WHO Solidarity Trial protocol13 specifies
symptomatic COVID-19 through longer term follow-up (ideally 12 months or more) and
severe COVID-19 over the same time frame as secondary endpoints. Following these guidelines and precedents, we consider hypothesis testing of vaccine efficacy over 12 months as a
secondary analysis, using a null hypothesis that is less stringent than the 30% null hypothesis value used for the primary analysis, recognizing that it is more difficult for a vaccine to
provide 12-month than 6-month protection and that even moderate vaccine efficacy through
12 months could be an important characteristic of a COVID-19 vaccine. In sum, we consider
both the assessment of vaccine efficacy against primary endpoints over six months, using a

30% null hypothesis, and the assessment of vaccine efficacy against the same endpoints over
12 months, using a 0% or 15% null hypothesis.
For each of the three endpoints, we obtain the maximum likelihood estimator for the
vaccine efficacy under the Poisson model. In addition, we calculate the score statistic for
testing the null hypothesis that the vaccine efficacy is less than a certain lower limit, say
30%, against the alternative hypothesis that the vaccine efficacy is greater than the lower
limit; we divide the score statistic by its standard error to create a standard-normal test
statistic.
We propose to test all three null hypotheses, adjusting the significance threshold for the
three test statistics to control the overall type I error at the desired level. We consider
a vaccine to be successful if any of the three null hypotheses is rejected. We describe this
multiple testing method in greater detail in Supplemental Appendix 1, where we also describe
a sequential testing procedure to determine which of the three null hypotheses should be
rejected.
In the sequential testing procedure, we order the three hypotheses according to the
order of the three observed test statistics, from the most extreme observed value to the
least extreme. We test the first null hypothesis using the significance threshold from the
aforementioned multiple testing procedure. If the first null hypothesis is rejected, we test
the second null hypothesis by applying the multiple testing procedure to the remaining two
test statistics. If the second null hypothesis is rejected, we test the last null hypothesis by
using the unadjusted significance threshold.
Clearly, this sequential testing procedure is more powerful than the multiple testing
procedure in identifying which endpoints the vaccine is efficacious against. Both the proposed
multiple testing and sequential testing methods properly account for the correlations of the
test statistics and thus are more powerful than the conventional Bonferroni correction and
related multiplicity adjustments that assume independence of tests.
If the effects of a vaccine are expected to be similar among the three endpoints, then we
can enhance statistical power by combining the evidence of the vaccine effects on the three

endpoints and performing a single test of overall vaccine efficacy. Specifically, we propose
taking the sum of the three score statistics and dividing the sum by its standard error
to create a standard-normal test statistic. We refer to this method as the combined test
(Supplemental Appendix 1); this is in the same vein as combining estimators for a common
effect in meta-analysis.14
Instead of the triple primary endpoints, we may consider the dual primary endpoints of
infection and disease if severe disease is very rare or the dual primary endpoints of disease
and severe disease if the vaccine is expected to be only weakly effective against infection.
Clearly, the above methods can be modified to test only two of the three endpoints.
It is desirable to periodically examine the accumulating data from a Phase 3 trial, so
that the trial can be terminated if sufficient evidence emerges for a highly effective vaccine
or a weakly effective candidate. In order to obtain rigorous stopping boundaries for a trial,
we need to derive the joint distribution of the test statistics over interim looks. In Supplemental Appendix 2, we show that the proposed test statistics over interim looks are jointly
normal with the independent increment structure, such that standard methods for interim
analyses15−18 can be applied.
Results
We first conducted a series of simulation studies to compare the performance of the proposed methods with the use of a single primary endpoint in evaluating short-term vaccine
efficacy. We assigned 27,000 subjects to vaccine or placebo at a ratio of 1:1. We assumed
that subjects were enrolled at a constant rate over a 2-month period and vaccine efficacy was
evaluated 6 months after the first subject was enrolled. We let 1% of the placebo subjects to
acquire infection, 0.6% to experience disease, and 0.12% to develop severe disease (Supplemental Appendix 3). These event proportions were based on the assumption of annualized
incidence of about 1.5% for symptomatic COVID-19 disease in the placebo group, together
with the assumptions that about 40% of infections are asymptomatic and that about 20% of
symptomatic COVID-19 cases will be severe. We set the vaccine efficacy for disease, denoted

by VED , to 60%; we set the vaccine efficacy for infection, denoted by VEI , to 40%, 50%, 55%
or 60%; and we set the vaccine efficacy for severe disease, denoted by VES , to 60%, 70%,
80% or 90% (Supplemental Appendix 3). For each combination of VEI , VED , and VES , we
simulated 100,000 datasets. (The average number of each endpoint can be easily calculated.
For example, there are approximately 189 cases of infection, 113 cases of disease, and 23
cases of severe disease under VEI = VED = VES = 0.6.) In each data set, we tested the null
hypothesis that the vaccine efficacy is at most 30% against the alternative hypothesis that
the vaccine efficacy is greater than 30% at the one-sided nominal significance level of 2.5%.
Table 1 summarizes the power of various methods for testing the null hypothesis of no
worthwhile efficacy (i.e., at most 30%). Using the single endpoint of disease has 80% power
under VED = 60%. Indeed, we chose the sample size and disease rate in the placebo group
to achieve this power, which is considered the benchmark for other methods. When VEI
is equal to or slightly below VED , the single endpoint of infection is more powerful than
the single endpoint of disease (e.g., 96% versus 80% power under VEI = VED = 60%)
because infection is more frequent than disease. Due to low incidence, the single endpoint
of severe disease has poor power unless VES is very high (e.g., 69% and 91% power under
VES = 80% and 90%, respectively). The combined test for the dual endpoints of infection
and disease and the combined test for the triple endpoints are substantially more powerful
than using disease as the single endpoint when VEI is similar to VED (e.g., 94% and 93%
power for the two combined tests versus 80% power for the single endpoint of disease under
VEI = VED = VES = 60%). The combined test for the dual endpoints of disease and severe
disease is more powerful than the single endpoint of disease when VES is high (e.g., 93%
versus 80% power under VES = 90%). The combined test is more powerful than multiple
testing for the dual endpoints of disease and severe disease, but the opposite is true for
the dual endpoints of infection and disease and the triple primary endpoints when VEI is
low. The proposed multiple-testing method is appreciably more powerful than Bonferroni
correction.
In order to investigate the ability of the proposed methods in detecting long-term vaccine

efficacy, we extended the follow-up time in the above simulation studies from a maximum of
6 months to a maximum of 12 months. We assumed that the event proportions for infection,
disease, and severe disease in the placebo group over the 12-month period doubled those of
the 6-month period. We reduced all values of vaccine efficacy by 30% to reflect the waning
of vaccine efficacy against each endpoint over time. We tested the null hypothesis that the
vaccine efficacy is 0% versus the alternative hypothesis that the vaccine efficacy is greater
than 0% at the nominal significance level of 2.5%. The results are summarized in Table 2.
Again, the proposed methods can substantially improve statistical power.
Discussion
We have presented a simple and rigorous framework to consider the totality of evidence
when evaluating the benefit of a COVID-19 vaccine in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection,
symptomatic COVID-19, and severe COVID-19. The proposed methods are more robust
to different scenarios of vaccine efficacy than the use of a single primary endpoint. We
recommend using the combined test to provide an overall assessment of worthwhile vaccine
efficacy, then using the sequential test (Supplemental Appendix 1) to determine the endpoints
against which the vaccine is efficacious.
If a vaccine is more effective in preventing severe than mild COVID-19, then using symptomatic COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 as dual primary endpoints will be more powerful
than using either of the two events as a single primary endpoint. If the vaccine efficacy for
infection is nearly as high as that for disease, then using infection, symptomatic COVID-19,
and severe COVID-19 as triple primary endpoints will be the most powerful.
Most Phase 3 trials have targeted 90% power for detecting 60% (short-term) vaccine
efficacy against COVID-19 disease. The actual power may be lower if the vaccine is less
effective, the disease incidence is lower than anticipated, or it is an interim analysis. In our
simulation studies, using disease as a single primary endpoint had only 80% power. However,
the proposed methods could boost the power to 90%.
The Phase 3 trials under Operation Warp Speed have thus far used symptomatic COVID8

19 as the sole primary endpoint, assessing severe COVID-19 as a secondary endpoint and
assessing a composite burden-of-disease endpoint as either a secondary endpoint or an exploratory endpoint.19 Under such a plan with a fixed-sequence strategy, hypothesis testing
on secondary endpoints would be permitted only if the result on the primary endpoint is
statistically significant.12 In the likely scenarios that VES is higher than VED , using disease and severe disease as dual primary endpoints will be more powerful than using disease
alone as the sole primary endpoint and thus may accelerate the discovery and deployment
of effective vaccines.
We have focused on vaccine trials for populations enriched with high-risk individuals (e.g.,
front-line health-care personnel, factory workers, older adults, people with underlying health
conditions), in which the risks for infection, disease, and severe disease are all appreciable.
In generally healthy populations, such as college students, the majority of infections are
asymptomatic, and severe disease is rare. For such settings, power can be maximized by
using the dual primary endpoints of infection and disease.
We have used Poisson models instead of Cox proportional hazards models for several
reasons. First, there are considerable inaccuracies in determining the event times, especially
the infection time; the Poisson modeling approach requires only the knowledge of whether or
not the event has occurred by the end of follow-up. Second, Poisson models are simpler than
Cox models, both conceptually and computationally. Because the event rates are relatively
low, the two modeling approaches should provide similar results.20 We fitted both Poisson
and Cox models in our simulation studies, and the power of the two approaches was nearly
identical (Supplemental Appendix 3).
We have emphasized hypothesis testing based on score statistics. In Supplemental Appendix 4, we extend our work to general Poisson regression, which can be used to estimate
vaccine efficacy, construct confidence intervals, compare multiple vaccines, and accommodate baseline risk factors (e.g., age, gender, race, occupation, co-morbidity). Baseline risk
factors can have major impact on the occurrences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic
COVID-19, and severe COVID-19. In addition, some participants in COVID-19 vaccine effi9

cacy trials may become unblinded through the use of available diagnostic tests, and at some
point trials may become unblinded. Covariate adjustment in the analysis of vaccine efficacy
against endpoints during post unblinding follow-up is important for minimizing bias due to
potential differences in exposure to SARS-CoV-2 between the vaccine and placebo arms.
We have developed our methods in order to accelerate the discovery, characterization, and
licensure of effective COVID-19 vaccines. An important function of the Phase 3 trials is to
continue the unblinded follow-up of the vaccine and placebo groups after definite evidence of
short-term efficacy has emerged, so as to assess duration of protection and improve precision
for assessment of prevention of severe disease, as well as for assessment of safety. Duration
of vaccine efficacy is an influential parameter in models of population impact of deployed
vaccines, and understanding of how vaccine efficacy wanes over time is essential to deciding
whether or not booster vaccinations may be required and to estimating the optimal timing
of the boosts. The ability of our framework to use the joint distribution of the estimators
to provide more precise confidence intervals around the three vaccine efficacy parameters
than existing methods (e.g., Bonferroni correction) that do not account for the correlation
of endpoints is advantageous regardless of whether one, two, or three endpoints are selected
as primary.

Supplemental Appendix
1. Two-Group Comparisons
Suppose that we record the occurrences of K types of events (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 infection,
symptomatic COVID-19, severe COVID-19) for a total of n subjects. For k = 1, . . . , K
and i = 1, . . . , n, let Yki denote the number of the kth type of event experienced by the ith
subject, and Tki denote the corresponding follow-up time. For i = 1, . . . , n, let Xi indicate,
by the values 1 versus 0, whether the ith subject receives vaccine or placebo. We assume
that Yki follows a Poisson distribution with mean µk Tki rkXi , where µk is the event rate (per
unit time interval) for placebo, and rk is the rate ratio (i.e., relative risk) between vaccine
and placebo. The vaccine efficacy on the kth type of event is defined by VEk = 1 − rk , which
is the proportionate reduction in cases among the vaccinated persons.
The likelihood for (µk , rk ) takes the form

K null hypotheses, adjusting the critical value so as to control the overall type I error at α.
Specifically, we reject Hk if the observed value of Zk is less than the constant c that satisfies
the equation
Pr(Z1 > c, . . . , ZK > c) = 1 − α,
where (Z1 , . . . , ZK ) is zero-mean K-variate normal with covariance matrix {ρkl ; k, l = 1, . . . , K},
and ρkl = Vkl /(Vkk Vll )1/2 . We refer to this method as multiple testing.
To determine which types of events the vaccine is effective against, we adopt a sequential
testing procedure, which is more powerful than the above multiple testing method. Let zk∗
∗
be the kth smallest observed value of the Zk ’s, and let (Z1∗ , . . . , ZK
) be a zero-mean K-

variate normal random vector with a covariance matrix obtained by rearranging the rows

). In addition, let
and columns of {ρkl ; k, l = 1, . . . , K} according to the order (z1∗ , . . . , zK

(H1∗ , . . . , HK

ing with H1∗ , we reject Hk∗ (k = 1, . . . , K) if
Pr( min Zj∗ ≤ zk∗ ) ≤ α,
k≤j≤K

∗
have been tested and rejected. It can be shown that the Type I
provided that H1∗ , . . . , Hk−1

error probability of this procedure is α for any combination of the true Hk ’s.1
We also propose to test the global null hypothesis of no worthwhile vaccine benefit on
any endpoint, i.e., H0 : rk ≥ rk0 for all k = 1, . . . , K, by combining the evidence of the
vaccine effects on the K endpoints. Specifically, we form a new test statistic by summing
the K score statistics and dividing the sum by its standard error:
PK

S = PK P
1/2 .
K
V

l=1 kl
We refer to S as the combined score test, which is standard normal under H0 .
2. Interim Analyses
Suppose that we perform interim analyses at times t1 < t2 < . . . < tM . Let Uk (t) be the
P
score statistic Uk based on the data collected up to time t. Write U (t) = K
k=1 Uk (t). By

the multivariate central limit theorem, the random vector {U (t1 ), . . . , U (tM )} is M -variate
normal. Under the Poisson assumption, for s > t, the covariance between Uk (s) and Ul (t) is
equal to the covariance between Uk (t) and Ul (t). If follows that the covariance between U (s)
and U (t) is equal to the variance of U (t). Because of this independent increment property,
all standard methods for interim analyses, such as group sequential tests and stochastic
curtailment,2−5 are applicable to the combined test, as well as the individual tests.
3. Simulation Studies
We assigned 27,000 subjects to vaccine or placebo at a ratio of 1:1. For each subject in
the placebo group, we generated the time from randomization to infection, the time from
infection to disease, and the time from disease to severe disease from the exponential distributions (Fig. 1) with means ξλ1 , ξλ2 , and ξλ3 , respectively, where ξ is a subject-specific
random effect that has a gamma distribution with mean 1 and variance 0.5. In the first set of
simulation studies, we generated the follow-up time from the Uniform (120,180) distribution.
We chose λ1 , λ2 , and λ3 to yield event proportions of 1% for infection, 0.6% for disease, and
0.12% for severe disease over the 6-month follow-up period. For each subject in the vaccine
group, we generated the three event times and the follow-up time in the above manner but
chose λ1 , λ2 , and λ3 to yield the desired values of VEI , VED , and VES . To assess statistical
power, we set VED to 0.6, VEI to 0.4, 0.5, 0.55 or 0.6, and VES to 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 or 0.9.
In the second set of simulation studies, we generated the follow-up time from the Uniform
(300,360) distribution and chose the event proportions of 2% for infection, 1.2% for disease,
and 0.24% for severe disease over the 12-month follow-up period. We set VED to 0.3, VEI
to 0.1, 0.2, 0.25 or 0.3, and VES to 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 or 0.6.
We evaluated a total of 12 methods: (1) Z1 alone; (2) Z2 alone; (3) Z3 alone; (4) combining
U1 and U2 ; (5) combining U2 and U3 ; (6) combining U1 , U2 , and U3 ; (7) multiple testing with
Z1 and Z2 ; (8) multiple testing with Z2 and Z3 ; (9) multiple testing with Z1 , Z2 , and Z3 ;
(10) Bonferroni correction for Z1 and Z2 ; (11) Bonferroni correction for Z2 and Z3 ; and (12)

with the nominal significance level of 2.5% for the null hypothesis that the vaccine efficacy
is at most 0.3 in the first set of simulation studies and is at most zero in the second set
of simulation studies. We estimated the power for the 12 methods by simulating 100,000
datasets for each of the 16 combinations of VEI , VED , and VES . We considered Z2 alone the
benchmark since most vaccine trials have adopted symptomatic COVID-19 as the primary
endpoint.
We implemented the Poisson regression approach described in the previous section, as
well as a Cox regression analog.1,6 The results of the two approaches are almost identical.
Here, we report only the Poisson regression results. Poisson regression has clear advantages
over Cox regression because it is computationally simple and does not require knowing the
event time, but rather whether or not the subject has developed the event of interest by the
end of follow-up.
4. General Regression
We consider general Poisson regression, which can be used to perform point and interval
estimation, to compare multiple vaccines, and to accommodate baseline risk factors (e.g.,
age, gender, race, occupation, co-morbidities). As in Appendix 1, there are K types of
events and a total n study subjects. For k = 1, . . . , K and i = 1, . . . , n, let Yki denote the
number of the kth type of event experienced by the ith subject, Tki denote the corresponding
follow-up time, and Xki denote a set of covariates (i.e., vaccine indicators, baseline risk
factors). (We allow risk factors to depend on the event type.) We assume that Yki follows
0

a Poisson distribution with mean µk Tki eβk Xki , where µk is the baseline event rate (per unit
time interval), and βk is a set of log relative risks.
The likelihood for (µk , βk ) takes the form

bk = ni=1 Yki / ni=1 Tki eβk Xki .
For large n, the estimators βbk (k = 1, . . . , K) are jointly normal with means βk (k =
1, . . . , K). In addition, the covariance matrix between βbk and βbl is A−1

Let ηk be the component of βk that corresponds to the vaccine effect on the kth endpoint.
We extract the maximum likelihood estimator ηbk from βbk and extract the covariance matrix
of (b
η1 , . . . , ηbK ), denoted by Σ = {σkl ; k, l = 1, . . . , K}, from the covariance matrices between
βbk and βbl (k, l = 1, . . . , K). For k = 1, . . . , K, we calculate the Z-score for testing the null
1/2

hypothesis Hk : ηk ≥ ηk0 by using the Z-score: Zk = (b
ηk − ηk0 )/σkk . We can then use these
Z-scores for the multiple testing and sequential testing procedures described in Appendix 1.
Suppose that η1 = η2 = . . . = ηK = η. Then we can estimate η by the weighted linear
P
bk , where (w1 , . . . , wK )0 = (e0 Σ−1 e)−1 Σ−1 e, and e = (1, . . . , 1)0 .1
combination: ηb = K

In addition, we test the global null hypothesis H0 : ηk ≥ ηk0 for all k = 1, . . . , K by the

which is analogous to the combined score test given at the end of Appendix 1. Although
the assumption of a common vaccine effect on the K endpoints may not hold, ηb provides a
concise summarization of the vaccine effects, and S provides a valid test of overall vaccine
efficacy.
