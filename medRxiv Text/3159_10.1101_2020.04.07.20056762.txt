Abstract:
Introduction: This paper sought to investigate the clinical characteristic differences
between suspected and confirmed patients with COVID-19 from CT scan to prevent and
treat this infectious disease, since the coronavirus outbreak in the world has seriously
affected the quality of life.
Methods: We proposed to use a retrospective case-control study to give a comparison
between suspected patients and confirmed patients in the clinical characteristics.
Results: (56%) patients were confirmed for COVID-19 from suspected 167 patients.
We find that elder people were more likely to be infected by COVID-19. Among the
confirmed 94 patients, 2 (2%) patients were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 0
(0%) patients died during the study period. We find that images of CT scan of patients
with a COVID-19 are significantly different from patients without a COVID-19.
Conclusions: To our best knowledge, it is the first time to use the case-control design
to study the coronavirus disease, since it is particularly appropriate for investigating
infectious disease outbreaks. The clinical treatment experience in this study can supply
a guideline for treating COVID-19 as the number of the infected patients is increasing in
the world. Compared with other studies, we find that the mortality rate and the intensive
care unit rate can be reduced if patients can be treated timely in the right identification
and detection with nucleic acid testing and chest CT scan. Therefore, we recommend
nucleic acid testing and chest CT scan for the clinical treatment practice from this
successful clinical treatment study.

Keywords: COVID-19, chest CT scan, nucleic acid testing, case-control study.

Introduction
In December 2019, many cases of pneumonia have been detected in Wuhan, Hubei
Province, China. These patients were with similar clinical manifestations of viral
pneumonia, characterized by fever and cough and other nonspecific symptoms,
including breathing difficulties, muscle aches, and fatigue. Based on the development
characteristics and viral structure of this health emergency, the World Health
Organization (WHO) named it as COVID-19 1, which is the seventh member of the
human-infected coronavirus family 2, and two other notable family members are severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS) coronavirus, which have caused significant public health hazards. The paper

confirmed that COVID-19 can be transmitted from people to people through droplets or
contact, or through the fecal-oral route, with a high incidence and rapid infection, posing
a huge threat to global public health. COVID-19 is spreading around the world. The
coronavirus outbreak in the world has seriously affected the quality of life.
One main purpose is to show the clinical treatment experience in COVID-19 from CT
scan. Patients in this study were different from Wuhan patients in the paper 3. All the
suspected patients with/without the symptoms were concentrated to the hospital in the
fever clinic areas, and then they were carried out by physical examinations including the
blood routine test, C-reactive protein test, nucleic acid examination, and chest CT scans.
If the abnormal and blood routine did not indicate the obvious signs of bacterial infection,
then patients were becoming a suspected case. After that, the new coronavirus nucleic
acid examination was carried out to test whether it was positive or negative. Positive
patients were further transferred to the special ward for treatment with the chest CT

scans, which can show the cloudy lungs on both sides of each infected person.
Therefore, this case-control study wants to investigate whether nucleic acid testing and
CT imaging examination are the important key to detect the lung infection and identify
the suspected COVID-19 infections, since rapid identification of diseases can ensure
timely treatment with very limited health resources for a large amount number of sick
patients.
To demonstrate the clinical outcomes of the above treatment process, we compared the
patient character and clinical treatment outcomes of confirmed patients with those
suspected patients. We investigated the progression analysis review of the CT scans.
We find that this case-control study has more cases than the initial partial reported
study

with total 62 cases. Therefore, we believed that this retrospective case-control

report can provide some detail data for understanding the Coronavirus from the
perspective of CT scan results.

Methods
Data resource
The 167 consecutive hospitalized patients collected from January 21 to Feb 11, 2020,
and the final date of follow-up was February 28, 2020. Patient epidemiological data,
clinical symptoms, blood routine test, and chest CT characteristics were collected in the
hospital in standard form. The chest CT Scan was performed using GE Light Speed
VCT 64-slice and Phillips Brilliance 16-slice CT. The scanning parameters are tube
voltage 120 kV, automatic tube current, scanning layer thickness 5.00 mm,

reconstruction layer thickness 11.5 mm, pitch 0.99 1.20, image reconstruction using
high-resolution algorithm, matrix 512 Ã— 512. Lung window with position 500 HU and
window-width 1500 HU and mediastinum window with position 40 HU and window-width
400 HU.
The chest CT scan and image data have covered the comprehensive features for each
patient as follows: (1) the location of lesions according to the left, right, or both lungs, (2)
the number of lesions, (3) the location of the lesions along the bronchus beam
distribution, near pleural distribution, or mixed distribution, (4) the lesion size, (5) the
presence of air bronchi sign or not, (6) the presence of grid-like texture, (7) the lesion
morphology, (8) lung involvement percentage (9) The presence of atelectasis or not, (10)
whether the density of the lesion is ground-glass-like, solid or mixed, (11) the presence
of

pleural effusion or the presence of

lymphadenopathy in extrapulmonary

manifestations, and (12) other potential lung diseases features such as pulmonary
bullae, pulmonary nodules, calcifications, and fibrous lesions.
Statistical analysis
It is known that the case-control design is particularly appropriate for investigating
infectious disease outbreaks. We divided all suspected patients into the control group
and the case group from the nucleic acid testing result. The case group included the
suspected patients with a positive nucleic acid testing result, and the control group
included patients with a negative nucleic acid testing result. We summarized continuous
variables as either means and standard deviations or medians with interquartile ranges
for all patients in control and case groups. For categorical variables, we calculated the
percentages of patients in each category. Characteristics for case and control patients

were compared using analysis of variance or nonparametric statistics (rank sum tests)
and Chi-square tests as appropriate. All analyses were done with SAS software, version
9.4.
Patient and public involvement
No patients were involved in the clinical trial design, setting the research questions, and
the outcome measures directly. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or
writing up of results.

Results
Patient epidemiological characteristics
The 167 COVID-19 suspected patients were included in the statistical analysis. Their
aged 1- 87 and the mean (SD) age of the patients was 44 (19) years. 94 confirmed
cases (56%) and 67(45%) control group. 92 (55%) were male and 75 (45%) were
females, with men accounting for the largest proportion. In COVID-19 patients, there
were 38 cases (23%) in Wuhan. There were 8 cases of hypertension 23 (14%), 13 (8%)
cases of diabetes, 13 (8%) cases of Cardiogenic diseases, 3 cases of lung disease
(1%), 1 case of kidney disease, and 2 (1%) cases of liver disease. 123 (74%) cases of
first symptoms, the most common symptoms are 123 (74%) cases of fever, 105 (63%)
cases of cough, 22 (13%) cases of runny nose, 22 (13%) cases of gastrointestinal
symptoms, 42 (25%) cases of sore throat, 32 (19%) cases of fatigue, 31 (19%) cases of
muscle pain. 47% patients have been treated by Chinese medicine, and it may help

fight the COVID-19 disease. The summary of basic characteristics in all 167 patients
with COVID-19 is shown in Table 1.
Biochemical testing
The results of blood routine tests of 167 patients were summarized in Table 2, where
the confirmed patients were compared with patients with the negative result from
nucleic acid testing.
Chest CT scan and image
In the first chest CT scan of 167 COVID-19 patients, 85% confirmed patients have
lesions in both of left and right lung compared 30% in suspected patients. 78%
confirmed patients had more than 3 lesions. 95% confirmed patients were with patch
lesion morphology. The detail comparative results are summarized in Table 3.
CT scans of eight random selected patients were shown in Figure1. We find that CT
scans of patients with a coronavirus are significantly different from patients without a
coronavirus infection. For example, the lesions are multiple patchy, and the grinding
glass shadows are distributed in the peripheral pulmonary field in the infected patients.
The lesions are large, strip-like, uneven density, and to the lung leaf or lung section
distribution, the neighbor's pleural reactive slight thickening in patients without a virus
infection.
Intensive Care Unit
Two (2%) patients in the case group were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) in this
study. It is different from the recent report

patients were elder patients with hypertension or diabetes. 0 (0%) patients died during
the followed-up period.

Conclusions

This paper gave the clinical characteristic differences between suspected and confirmed
patients with COVID-19. 94 (56%) COVID-19 patients were identified from the
suspected 167 patients in this case-control study. We find that fever symptoms account
for the first clinical characteristics since 74% of patients had a fever/cough symptom,
and then followed other gastrointestinal reactions, sore throat, fatigue, and muscle pain.
Laboratory examination showed normal or decreased peripheral white blood cells,
decreased lymphocyte count, and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) level. Their
clinical characteristics did not fully cover all patients such as first symptoms. We also
find that some suspected patients need to be combined with epidemiological history
since the first nucleic acid testing were negative, but they were confirmed positive later.
Elder people were more likely to be infected by COVID-19 from Table 1. Among the
confirmed 94 patients, 2 (2%) patients were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 0
(0%) patients died during the study period. Compared with the clinical result in the
paper

6,7,

our clinical treatments were more successful from the clinical treatment

process.

The strengths of this case-control design can clearly show the difference between the
confirmed and suspected patients. The comparative results can provide some valuable

information in the understanding of the clinical features of COVID-19 and identifying the
potential patients from suspected patients, especially in the current period when the
number of people with the suspected disease is increasing rapidly in the world. We
recommend that the nucleic acid examination and chest CT scan are important tools to
detect COVID-19 and stop the deterioration process of the lung function to Intensive
