Abstract
While lymphocytopenia is a common characteristic of patients infected by the novel severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the mechanisms responsible for this depletion
are unclear. Through careful inspection of the spleens and lymph nodes (LNs) from six cases with
postmortem examinations, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 could directly infect secondary lymphoid
organs to induce cell death. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated ACE2 (angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2), the potential receptor of SARS-CoV-2, expresses on tissue-resident CD169+
macrophages in spleens and LNs. Immunofluorescent staining confirmed that viral nucleocaspid
protein (NP) can be found in ACE2+ cells, CD169+ macrophages, but not in CD3+ T cells or B220+
B cells in spleens and LNs. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces severe tissue damage including lymph
follicle depletion, splenic nodule atrophy, histiocyte hyperplasia and lymphocyte reductions.
Moreover, in situ TUNEL staining illustrated that viral infection leads to severe lymphocyte
apoptosis, which might be mediated by viral antigens inducing Fas upregulation. Furthermore,
SARS-CoV-2 also triggers macrophages to produce IL-6, a proinflammatory cytokine that directly
promotes lymphocyte necrosis. Collectively, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 directly
neutralizes human spleens and LNs through infecting tissue- resident CD169+ macrophages.

Introduction
In December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported by
the local health facilities in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.1,2 In January 2020, the causative agent
of mysterious pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus named as 2019 novel coronavirus
(2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO). This novel coronavirus was renamed as
the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the consequent
disease was designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).3,4 According to the daily report of
the WHO, the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 has so far caused 81961 laboratory confirmed cases and
3293 death in China. Meanwhile, the number of confirmed COVID-19 and fatalities around the
world are 465315 and 21031, respectively, by 26th March 2020.5
The importance of the secondary lymphoid organs, including spleen and lymph nodes (LNs), for
resistance against infection is well established. Tissue-resident macrophages positioned in the
splenic marginal zone (MZ) that are among the first cell types to encounter invading pathogens.6,7
Similarly, the resident macrophages of the subcapsular sinus and hilar lymph nodes have been
shown to play a protective role against viral infections by capturing viral particles.8,9 These
macrophages present viral antigens to activate specific T cells, to induce activation, clonal
proliferation, and subsequent killing of infected target cells through secretion of perforin, granzyme
B, and interferon-γ etc.10-12 Moreover, these activated T cells also egress from spleen and LNs into
blood circulation and play immune surveillance roles.13 Unfortunately, our previous work has
shown that lymphocytopenia is prevalent in COVID-19 patients, especially in aged and critically ill
cases, suggesting that the immune system from COVID-19 patients might be neutralized by
infection.14 Therefore, understanding the destinies of lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid organs is
critical for understanding SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, and the identification of methods to boost
lymphocytes and enhance the host immunity in vivo.
In this report, spleens and LNs from six COVID-19 patients with postmortem examinations were
collected. The virions in LNs were visually observed by transmission electronic microscope (EM)
and pathological damage was analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Moreover, viral
nucleocapsid protein (NP) antigen, cell apoptosis and proinflammatory cytokine expression were
measured by immunohistochemistry.

Methods
Patients Postmortem autopsies were conducted on six COVID-19 patients who had been admitted
in Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the
New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (5th edition) published by the
National Health Commission of China. All the patients were laboratory-confirmed positives for
SARS-CoV-2 by use of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on throat swab samples. Moreover, three
cases of spleens and LNs from normal healthy controls who were death due to traffic accident were
also involved. This study was approved by the National Health Commission of China and Ethics
Commission of General Hospital of Central Theatre Command ([2020]017-1) and Jinyintan
Hospital (KY-2020-15.01). Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of the
designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases.
Tissue morphology detection Due to the special infection-control precaution of handling deceased
subjects with COVID-19, postmortem examination was performed in a designated pathology
laboratory. The spleens and hilar lymph nodes from 6 cases were collected by standard examination
at autopsy. The histopathology and pathological characteristics were analyzed by H&E staining.
Briefly, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were cut into 3 μm slices and mounted onto
poly-lysine-coated glass slides, tissues were incubated with hematoxylin for 5 minutes, after 1 min
of dehydration by 100% alcohol, section were further treated with eosin for 30 seconds. Sections
were mounted and the results were viewed using a light microscope (Zeiss Axioplan 2, Berlin,
Germany).
Immunohistochemistry The protocol used for immunohistochemistry was performed as published
previously.15 Briefly, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were cut into 2~3μm sections and mounted
on poly-L-lysine-charged glass slides. Sections were de-waxed and rehydrated, and antigen retrieval
was performed by microwaving in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH6.0). Endogenous peroxidase activity
was blocked by incubation with a solution of 0.5% hydrogen peroxidase (H2O2) in 50 % methanol
for 1 h. The sections were then incubated in 3% BSA plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS for 1 h at RT
to block nonspecific binding. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary
antibodies that had been diluted in 1 % BSA. These antibodies are including anti-SARS-CoV-2
nucleocaspid protein (NP) antibodies (clone ID: 019, 1:100, rabbit IgG; Sino Biological, Beijing),

sections were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT. The Vecta-stain
ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for the avidin- biotin complex
method according the manufacturer’s instructions. Sections incubated with isotype-matched,
concentration-matched immunoglobulin without primary antibodies were used as isotype controls.
Peroxidase activity was visualized with the DAB Elite kit (K3465, DAKO, Copenhagen, Denmark),
and brown coloration of tissues represented positive staining. The sections were lightly
counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated through an ethanol series to xylene and mounted.
Finally, sample sections were viewed using a light microscope (Zeiss Axioplan 2).
Immunofluorescence double-staining For immunofluorescence double-staining, the sections were
incubated with primary anti-NP, anti-CD68, anti-CD169, anti-B220, anti-IL-6 antibodies at 4 °C
overnight. After washing with PBS (3 washes, 5 min per wash), the sections were incubated with
Alexa Fluor® 555-conjugated goat anti-mouse/rabbit IgG antibodies (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA,
USA) or Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse/rabbit IgG1 antibodies (Invitrogen) for an 1
h. Finally, the sections were incubated with 1 μg/ml DAPI (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 10 min
to stain the nuclei. Sections incubated with the appropriate isotype control primary antibodies and
fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies were used as negative controls. The results were
analyzed using fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axioplan 2).
TUNEL staining Cellular apoptosis was measured by TUNEL staining according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Roche, Berlin, Germany). The proportion of TUNEL-positive nuclei in
spleens and LNs was determined through image analysis of the histological sections.
Photomicrographs were captured and analyzed using Image Pro-Plus 5.0 software (Media
Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD).

Results
1. ACE2 expresses on macrophages in spleens and LNs
Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of ACE2, the potential receptor for
SARS-CoV-2, in 6 cases of spleens and hilar LNs from 6 autopsies as well as normal human tissues.
Results showed that ACE2+ cells were observed in spleens and LNs from normal healthy and
autopsies. In LNs, the expression of ACE2 is restricted on cells within medulla (Figure 1 A and C),
whereas ACE2+ cells are found in red pulp of spleens (Figure 1 B and D), and tissues from
autopsies have slightly higher levels of ACE2+ cells than normal controls. Here ACE2 expression in
normal kidneys were used as positive controls (Figure 1E), and sections without primary antibodies
were used as isotype controls (Figure 1F), demonstrating ACE2+ cells are positions in human
spleens and LNs.
We next examined what kinds of cells are positive for ACE2, and immunofluorescent double
staining showed that ACE2 expresses on CD68+ macrophages in LNs (Figure 1G). CD169+
macrophages are a subpopulation of tissue-resident macrophages positioned in the splenic marginal
zone (MZ) where they encounter invading pathogens.6,7 In parallel, CD169+ macrophages also
reside in the subcapsular sinus of LNs and have been shown to capture viral particles from draining
LNs.8,16 Immunofluorescent double staining further illustrated that the ACE2 antigen is observed in
CD169+ macrophages in the subcapsular sinus of LNs (Figure 1G). Collectively, these results
demonstrated that ACE2 expresses on macrophages in spleens and LNs.
2. SARS-CoV-2 directly infects macrophages in spleens and LNs
We next investigated the expression of viral NP antigen in secondary lymphoid tissues.

Immunohistochemistry showed that SARS-CoV-2 NP antigens could be seen in spleens and LNs
from all of these six autopsies, while being absent in sections from normal healthy controls. In the
spleen, viral NP+ cells were primarily distributed in red pulp and blood vessels, although positive
cells were also occasionally observed in white pulp. In lymph nodes, the NP+ cells were seen in
cells within marginal sinus of lymph nodules as well as capillaries, some positive cells are also
found in germinal centers, and NP antigen was observed in cytoplasm, whereas nucleus is negative
for NP expression (Figure 2A).
We then performed addition staining to identify the LN cell types that are positive for viral NP
antigen. Immunofluorescent double staining confirmed that the majority of NP antigen is found in
ACE2+ cells and CD68+ macrophages, including cells in capillaries, while, neither CD3+ T cells nor
B220+ B cells are positive for NP protein (Figure 2B). Moreover, immunofluorescent double
staining also further illustrated that the viral NP antigen is observed in CD169+ macrophages in the
subcapsular sinus of LNs (Figure 2B). Collectively, these results suggest SARS-CoV-2 infects
macrophages, especially resident CD169+ macrophages in spleen and LNs.
3. SARS-CoV-2 destroys human spleen and LNs
Since SARS-CoV-2 is known to be highly cytotoxic, its persistence in secondary lymphoid

～

organs may well induce lymphocytopenia. To confirm this possibility, 6 hilar lymph nodes of 1.0

1.5 cm in diameter from 6 autopsies were collected and histopathological examination was
performed by H&E staining. In contrast to normal healthy controls, the lymph follicles and
paracortical areas in viruses-infected tissues are not identifiable, with necrotic and apoptotic
lymphocytes being widely distributed, causing a significant reduction of total lymphocytes,
including cells in T and B zones. Moreover, interstitial blood vessels had proliferated, expanded and
were congested (Figure 3). Similarly, the total lymphocyte counts are significantly lower in sections
from viruses infected spleens, which were also dominated by lymphocytes undergoing necrosis and
apoptotic. Moreover, the spleens were congested, hemorrhagic, and lacking lymphoid follicles.
Additionally, the spleen corpuscles are atrophic, with clear interstitial vessels and fibrous tissue
hyperplasia in the splenic sinus (Figure 3). These results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 causes
severe damage in human spleen and LNs.
4. SARS-CoV-2 induces lymphocyte apoptosis via enhancing Fas signaling

In situ TUNEL staining showed that viral infected spleen and LNs manifested strong lymphocyte
apoptosis, whereas, apoptotic cells in tissues from age matched normal healthy controls are
undetectable (Figure 4A, B), suggesting SARS-CoV-2 induces cell apoptosis.
Because SARS-CoV-2 virus does not infect lymphocyte directly, we think the persistence of viral
antigen could constitutively activate T cells and B cells in spleen and LNs, thus causing
activation-induced cell death (AICD), which is mediated by Fas/FasL signaling.17-19
Immunohistochemistry showed that spleen and LN tissues from autopsies and normal healthy
controls manifested similar levels of FasL expression (Figure 4C). On the other hand, the
expression of Fas was significantly upregulated in virus infected spleens and LNs, whereas, the
expression of Fas is absence in sections from normal healthy controls, as detected by
immunofluorescent staining (Figure 4D, E). These results suggest SARS-CoV-2 promotes
lymphocyte apoptosis through enhancing Fas expression.
5. SARS-CoV-2 triggers macrophages to secret IL-6 and promote lymphocytopenia
The dysregulation of the proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6 has been described to
promote cell necrosis and apoptosis.20,21 We also reported that IL-6 might involve in mediating
lymphocyte reduction in severe COVID-19 patients.14 Immunohistochemistry showed that high
levels of IL-6 rather TNF-α were observed in virus infected spleen and LNs compared with sections
from normal healthy controls (Figure 5A). Moreover, immunofluorescent double staining showed
that IL-6 is primarily produced by infected macrophages (Figure 5B). Increased transcription of
several cytokines in macrophages has been described to be activated by SARS-Spike protein.22,23
Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS share a highly similar Spike protein based on amino acid sequence,
we reasoned that a similar phenomenon might occur with SARS-CoV-2 Spike. We thus treated
human macrophage line- THP1 cells with Spike protein in vitro, and found that SARS-CoV-2 Spike
protein can trigger increased Il6 expression independently of changes in Il1b and Tnfa gene
transcription (Figure 5C). Collectively, these results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 viruses and the
Spike protein, can trigger macrophages to secrete IL-6, which may accelerate lymphocytopenia.
Discussion
The COVID-19 is an acute infectious disease that caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has been a
worldwide epidemic outbreak because SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious and does not respond to

conventional antiviral treatment. Due to global research and collaboration, important progress has
been made in understanding its aetiology and epidemiology. Many studies have reported that
SARS-CoV-2 infection might induce immune damage, and the reduction of lymphocytes is very
common in severe or aged COVID-19 patients.14,24-26 However, no data are available regarding
whether this virus can directly infect human secondary lymphoid organs to cause lymphocytopenia.
We here showed that the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is found in macrophages in
human spleen and hilar LNs from autopsy as well as normal healthy (Figure 1). SARS-CoV-2 is a
cytopathic virus which can directly induce cellular damage of target cells during infection, and
H&E staining showed that acute tissue damage and lymphocyte reduction occurred in all detected
LNs and spleens as anticipated. In particular, the hilar LNs were congested and hemorrhagic, with
depletion of lymphocytes and accompanied by subcapsular sinus histiocytosis. Some cases also
showed enlargement of abdominal lymph nodes, which have reduced number of germinal centers.
Similarly, all of the spleens exhibited atrophy of white pulps, with complete loss in some cases. The

（

red pulp is markedly congested and hemorrhagic Figure 3). This phenomenon is consistent with
older reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV.27,28 Taken together, these results demonstrate that
SARS-CoV-2 directly infects LNs and spleens to cause severe tissue damage.
We then sought to investigate the route and identities of the cells that could potentially contribute
to SARS-CoV-2 transports into spleens and LNs. From our in situ immunohistochemistry, we
showed that viral NP antigen was restricted to the macrophages of the infected tissues, while,
human T cells and B cells were negative for viral NP antigen, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 cannot
directly infect T and B cells (Figure 2B). Most importantly, viral NP+CD68+ macrophages were
observed in capillaries of spleens and LNs, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 migrates into spleens and
LNs through macrophages. An interesting finding is that overwhelming numbers of NP+ cells are
observed in red pulp of spleens and within marginal sinus of lymph nodes (Figure 2A). Previous
work have showed that tissue-resident CD169+ macrophages are positioned in the splenic MZ and
reside in the subcapsular sinus of LNs.7,16 The strategic anatomical positioning of CD169+
macrophages in the spleen and LNs suggest these cells are the first to interact with invading
pathogen. Here, we also found that most CD169+ macrophages are positive for viral NP antigens
(Figure 2B). We therefore reasoned that the CD169+ macrophages play a central role in mediating
SARS-CoV-2 translocation in spleens and LNs, and thus contribute to viral growth and spread.

The presence of viral antigens would activate T cells and B cells in spleen and LNs, and thus lead
to Fas and FasL mediated AICD.17,19 Although the level of FasL in spleens and LNs is similar in
tissues from postmortem and age-match normal healthy controls, the expression of Fas is
dramatically higher in virus infected tissue than healthy controls (Figure 4). In addition to antigen
persistence stimulation, some proinflammatory cytokines like IL-6, TNF-α and IFN-γ can also can
mediate cellular apoptosis and necrosis.20,21 We focused here on IL-6 because it contributes to host
defense against to several kinds of pathogen infections.21,29 We also reported that the serum
concentration of IL-6 is negative to blood CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients.14
Interestingly, exposure to viral Spike protein can trigger Il6 gene transcription in macrophages in
vitro, and SARS-CoV-2 infected macrophage also manifested high levels of IL-6 in vivo (Figure
5).22,23 We thereby conjecture that macrophages-derived IL-6 would trigger lymphocyte apoptosis
and necrosis, while also enhancing Fas expression. Tocilizumab, a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor
antibody, has been developed and approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).30,31
Tocilizumab has also been shown to be effective against cytokine release syndrome resulting from
CAR-T cell infusion against B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.32 Since Tocilizumab has now
been approved for use in clinical therapy for COVID-19 patients, whether tocilizumab can restore
spleen and LN functions in COVID-19 patients by suppressing IL-6 signaling is an area requiring
further investigation.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can directly infect human LNs
and spleens and consequently lead to tissue damage and lymphocyte reduction. We also showed
that CD169+ macrophages play a central role in mediating SARS-CoV-2 translocation.
Mechanistically, we observed that viral infected macrophages can promote lymphocyte apoptosis
though enhancing IL-6 mediated Fas upregulation.
