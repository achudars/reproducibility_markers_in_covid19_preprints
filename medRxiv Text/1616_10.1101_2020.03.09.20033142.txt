24

Age distribution of the cases with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is rather

25

different from that of influenza. In China, there were few reported cases among children

26

[1] and serious or fatal child cases were also very infrequent. The age specificity is

27

particularly important in designing details of social distancing, including school closure,

28

as interventions, which is now recognized as the mainstream of interventions against

29

COVID-19. Investigating the details of contacts, substantial susceptibility among

30

children was demonstrated [2], but further insights into underlying mechanisms should

31

be explored. Here we examined the age distribution of COVID-19 cases in Japan from

32

January to March, 2020.

33

34

In Japan, a total of 313 domestically acquired cases have been confirmed as of 7 March

35

2020 (Figure 1). All these tested positive to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain

36

reaction (RT-PCR), and they arose from suspected cases with close contact (n=2496).

37

Male dominate confirmed cases (55.2%), and this finding is consistent with China [1].

38

Age category and gender were available for 173 male cases and 121 female cases. Out

39

of 173 male cases, seven were aged 0-19 years, 84 were aged 20-59 years and 82 were

40

aged 60 years and older, while three were aged 0-19 years, 69 were aged 20-59 years

41

and 49 were aged 60 years and older for female. It is remarkable that there are very few

42

child cases aged from 0-19 years in Japan.

43

44

Because all sample data stems from exposed and suspected individuals, age-specific

45

attack rate (AR) is calculable. Figures 1E and 1F show the AR estimates by age group

46

and gender. AR was very low, 7.2% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 3.0%, 14.3%) and

47

3.8% (95% CI: 0.8%, 10.6%), respectively, among male and female children aged from

0-19 years. The peak AR was seen in those aged from 50-59 years both for male, 22.2%

49

(95% CI: 16.3%, 29.0%), and female, 21.9% (95% CI: 14.4%, 31.0%).

50

51

What our short analysis shows is that children are less likely to be diagnosed as cases,

52

and moreover, the risk of disease given exposure among children appears to be low.

53

Both the overall risk and the conditional risk of disease given exposure are likely to be

54

the highest among adults aged from 50-69 years. The finding contradicts other widely

55

circulating respiratory viral infections, e.g. seasonal influenza and respiratory syncytial

56

virus infection, to which children are known to act as the focal host of transmission.

57

How can the age-specificity happen? The most plausible explanation that we believe is

58

immune imprinting to a similar virus among adults. Such virus must have continued to

59

circulate in the human population by 20 years ago, and may be most intensely circulated

60

by around 50 years ago. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-2) coronavirus

61

may be antigenically closely related to the old coronavirus, and infected adults in the

62

present day may experience erroneous recognition of SARS-2 coronavirus. Although

63

not focusing on the age specificity, a hypothetical discussion took place, suspecting of

64

antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) as a potential biological mechanism of

65

heterogeneous risks of death [3], which could explain the diagnosis of severe cases in

66

higher age groups than in children, as seen in the present study.

67

68

In order to validate the hypothesis, it is ideal to conduct a seroepidemiological study

69

which may involve multiple candidate antigens including other coronaviruses [4].

can be verified as the explanatory mechanism, which would have critical insights into

72

minimization of unavoidable deaths.
