Abstract

48

Background: Surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

49

infections is essential for the global containment measures with regard to the ongoing pandemic.

50

Diagnostic gold standard is currently reverse transcription of the (+)RNA genome and subgenomic

51

RNAs and subsequent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs

52

or bronchoalveolar lavages. In order to further improve the diagnostic accuracy, particularly for the

53

reliable discrimination between negative and false-negative specimens, we propose the combination of

54

the RT-qPCR workflow with subsequent pyrosequencing of a S-gene amplicon. This extension might

55

add important value mainly in cases with low SARS-CoV-2 load, where RT-qPCR alone can deliver

56

conflicting results.

57

Results: We successfully established a combined RT-qPCR and S-gene pyrosequencing method

58

which can be optionally exploited after routine diagnostics or for epidemiologic studies. This allows a

59

more reliable interpretation of conflicting RT-qPCR results in specimens with relatively low viral

60

loads and close to the detection limits of qPCR (CT values >30). After laboratory implementation and

61

characterization of a best practice protocol we tested the combined method in a large pediatric cohort

62

from two German medical centers (n=769). Pyrosequencing after RT-qPCR enabled us to uncover 6

63

previously unrecognized cases of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 associated diseases, partially exhibiting

64

unusual and heterogeneous presentation. Moreover, it is notable that in the course of RT-

65

qPCR/pyrosequencing method establishment we did not observe any case of false-positive diagnosis

66

when confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens were used from foregoing routine testing.

67

Conclusions: The proposed protocol allows a specific and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 close

68

to the detection limits of RT-qPCR. Combined RT-qPCR/pyrosequencing does not negatively affect

69

preceding RT-qPCR pipeline in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and can be optionally applied in routine to

70

inspect conflicting RT-qPCR results.

Background

77

As of April 26th 2020 at Helios University Hospital Wuppertal during a period of attenuation which

78

followed the first peak phase of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Germany only 2.3% of all laboratory-

79

confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive cases were children or teenagers (age group: 0-19 yrs). Nationwide

80

as of September 8th 2020, the contribution of this age group to all SARS-CoV-2-positive cases had

81

increased to 10.5% [1]. This development was in agreement with observations made globally, in

82

particular in the US, whose population remains among the most affected of the SARS-CoV-2

83

pandemic. Since then, a trend of weekly median age decline for persons with COVID-19-like illness

84

was reported for an observation period between May 3rd – August 29th 2020. In particular, a steady

85

increase of the percentage fraction of all confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive cases for the 0-19 year olds

86

was observed in the United States starting from 7.4% in May, 10.8% in June, 14.0% in July and

87

preliminary being elevated up to 15.5% in August 2020 [2]. Reminiscent of this, at least since early

88

autumn 2020 the 7-days-incidence for all pediatric age groups increased in similar ways as observed

89

for most other age groups in Germany (Figure 1). As evidence is accumulating that pediatric

90

presentation of SARS-CoV-2 associated diseases can possibly be more heterogeneous than adult

91

COVID-19 there is an urgent need to recognize the full spectrum of unusual pediatric SARS-CoV-2-

92

borne diseases. Reliable diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection will eventually contribute to effective

93

personalized treatment and optimized containment measures. To address this problem, we

94

systematically screened two pediatric cohorts from Helios University Hospital Wuppertal (North

95

Rhine-Westphalia, Western Germany) and Klinikum Kassel (Hessen, Central Germany). Therefore, in

96

order to enable the re-examination of ambiguous SARS-CoV-2 (+)RNA RT-qPCR results, which

97

particularly can occur in specimens with relatively low viral load, we developed and applied an

98

improved assay that combines RT-qPCR and pyrosequencing. This strategy allows the reliable

99

discrimination of SARS-CoV-2 from other human coronaviruses (HCoVs) and can reduce the rate of

100

uncertain qPCR results, which might be influenced by several confounding factors, thus occasionally

101

leading to false-negative qPCR results – particularly when PCR is close to its detection limits. Here,

102

we provide a preliminary report of our epidemiological survey as well as a detailed protocol for an

103

expanded SARS-CoV-2 (+)RNA detection method, which relies on the complementary exploitation of

104

RT-qPCR and pyrosequencing of a genome fragment from the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein

105

polybasic cleavage motif. Following rigorous implementation, we applied the test on two pediatric

106

cohorts from two German medical centers comprising 769 children in total (n=599 [Wuppertal];

107

n=170 [Kassel]; 44% female/56% male; 53.6% 0-5 yrs, 28.7% 6-12 yrs, 17.7% 13-17 yrs) without

108

indication for routine COVID-19 testing as defined by the WHO at time of presentation.

Results

111

Design and implementation of a combined SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR/pyrosequencing test to complement

112

established diagnostic workflows

113

We targeted a region encoding a polybasic cleavage motif within the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein

114

(S). Multiple sequence alignment analyses demonstrate that this region could be a suitable

115

differentiator between SARS-CoV-2, related coronaviruses from several animal host [3] as well as

116

SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and other HCoVs (Figure 2A.). For RT-qPCR we selected a set of forward

117

primer (Spbc-CoV-2-F: 5’-GCAGGCTGTTTAATAGGGGC-3’) and 5’-biotinylated reverse primer

118

(Spbc-CoV-2-RBIO: 5’-biotin-TEG-ACCAAGTGACATAGTGTAGGCA-3’), since Primer-BLAST

119

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/index.cgi) query confirmed the probable suitability

120

of the selected primer set predicting a 162 bp SARS-CoV-2-specific amplicon matching perfectly to

121

the complete reported list of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. As probe for TaqMan qPCR we used 5’-HEX-

122

ATTGGTGCAGGTATATGCGCTAGTTATC-BBQ-650-3’ (Spbc-CoV-2-P). Without carrying the 5’-

123

/3’-modifications we selected the same oligonucleotide sequence for the pyrosequencing primer (Spbc-

124

CoV-2-S) (Figure 2B.; Table S1).

125

For all tests we used specimens, which underwent routine COVID-19 diagnostic testing and were pre-

126

categorized ‘confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive’ or ‘negative’. For comparison we used the full set of

‘Charité protocol’ amplicon targets (RdRP, E, N) [4] (Table S1). Before RT-qPCR, total RNA was

128

purified from 250 µL of nasopharyngeal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens using the

129

guanidinium isothiocyanate (GITC) extraction method. Besides, due to RT-qPCR reagent

130

manufacturer’s recommendation, we tested whether the RNA purification step could be dispensable.

131

Briefly, using stabilized raw specimens from SARS-CoV-2 as RT-qPCR templates, results from the

132

same specimens using purified RNA could only be matched in some cases (Figure S1). Therefore, we

133

neglected this approach during our successive experiments.

134

Reverse transcription and subsequent amplification of cDNA were carried out using universal one-step

135

RT-qPCR reaction mastermixes. A detailed protocol including recommended reagents is provided in

136

the Methods section. Quantitative PCR programs often use an excess of cycling steps, frequently

137

leading to the incremental enrichment of unspecific byproducts during later cycles. With respect to the

138

quality of subsequent pyrosequencing, we aimed on the optimization of PCR cycle numbers for

139

singleplex, duoplex and triplex PCR approaches. We determined that 36 sequential qPCR cycles of

140

denaturation, annealing and elongation were a good compromise with respect to multiple prudential

141

reason: 1. Typically, for different amplicons we observed that the cycle threshold (CT) limit for the

142

faithful discrimination between positive and negative samples was below a CT of 35 (Figure 3).

143

Consistently, semi-quantitative PCR and subsequent electrophoresis resulted in a specific 162 bp band

144

and no or occasionally few weak byproducts (Figure S2A). 2. For approx. 35 or more cycles we

145

observed accelerated curve increments and thresholds crossing also for negative samples and no-

146

template controls indicating ongoing amplification of PCR byproducts. Using an excess of PCR

147

cycles, multiple unspecific byproducts and DNA smear of higher molecular weight are observable in

148

confirmed positive and negative specimens (Figure S2B).

149

Besides an excess of PCR cycles, we identified multiplex PCR approaches where more than one

150

amplicon is targeted by multiple primer sets in one PCR reaction as another possible confounding

151

factor influencing PCR quality and successive pyrosequencing. To test this hypothesis, we performed

152

triplex RT-qPCR reactions by simultaneously using RdRP, Orf E and Orf N amplicon targets. Semi-

153

quantitative analyses by agarose gel electrophoresis demonstrate that numerous low and high

154

molecular weight byproducts were amplified in both cases when RNA from confirmed SARS-CoV-26

155

positive specimens or negative specimens was used (Figure S3). Since we assumed that biotinylated

156

byproducts could massively impair successive pyrosequencing we decided to neglect triplex

157

approaches for the intended combinatorial use of RT-qPCR. With emphasis on the SARS-CoV-2 S-

158

gene amplicon we instead aimed to compare the specificities, efficiencies and sensitivities of

159

singleplex RT-qPCR vs. duoplex RT-qPCR. In order to further characterize the performance of the

160

SARS-CoV-2 S-gene amplicon target and to select the best additional amplicon for a duoplex

161

approach, we performed comprehensive RT-qPCR tests using the S-gene, Orf E, Orf N and RdRP as

162

amplicon targets and using serially diluted specimens from the same confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive

163

specimens for all RT-qPCR reactions. Figure 3 illustrates the performance of different qPCR assays

164

for one representative SARS-CoV-2-positive nasopharyngeal specimen. Taken together, TaqMan RT-

165

qPCR for both the S-gene amplicon and the Orf E amplicon with similar sensitivity as indicated by

166

low DCT between S-gene and Orf E in singleplex reactions. Further, we deduced from a series of serial

167

template dilutions that amplification efficiency for both the S-gene target and the Orf E target is high

168

but weakens between CT=30 and CT=35. In duoplex RT-qPCR assays targeting simultaneously the S-

169

gene target and Orf E in one reaction no notable changes in sensitivity or qPCR efficiency were seen

170

(Figure 3A). With respect to efficiency also the Orf N amplicon target performed well, but its

171

sensitivity lagged behind as indicated by a large DCT when compared to Orf E (Figure 3B). In stark

172

contrast, the RdRP amplicon frequently performed volatile and appeared to lag behind the sensitivities

173

of all other amplicons in the majority of specimens examines - as in the illustrated case, where even

174

the curve for the undiluted sample did not cross the predefined threshold (Figure 3B). Therefore, apart

175

from a singleplex S-gene RT-qPCR/pyrosequencing approach, we considered a duoplex (S-gene and

176

Orf E) RT-qPCR/S-gene pyrosequencing approach as a promising combination for the faithful

177

detection of active SARS-CoV-2 infections.

178

To test this hypothesis, we performed subsequent pyrosequencing of the biotinylated single-stranded

179

S-gene amplicon using the same serial dilution samples described above (Figure 4). The proposed

180

pyrosequencing approach could theoretically allow to read a SARS-CoV-2 (+)RNA-specific sequence

181

fragment of 55 nt. Using the undiluted sample from the singleplex S-gene amplicon RT-qPCR

182

reaction, we achieved an unbiased 53 nt sequence fragment, which could unambiguously be assigned

183

to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. Successive serial dilutions led to modest enrichment of

184

miscalled bases in the resulting pyrogram, but still allowed the faithful assignment of the called

185

sequence to SARS-CoV-2 up to a corresponding approx. CT≈30. Serial dilutions were gradually

186

accompanied by a weakening of pyrogram-signal strength and a decreased signal-to-noise ratio.

187

Automated basecalling of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence failed frequently for samples with CT>30.

188

However, for a range between CT≈30 and CT≈35 the most adverse reason counteracting SARS-CoV-2

189

sequence recognition appeared to be the decremental signal-to-noise ratio, which led to incremental

190

false-positive calling of repetitive bases. The illustrated examples suggest the presence of signals

191

encoding the targeted SARS-CoV-2, which could be separable from the threshold noise signals. S-

192

gene pyrosequencing performed equally well, when a duoplex (S-gene and Orf E) RT-qPCR was

193

conducted priorly (Figure 4). We noted a tendency of slightly increasing numbers of missing or excess

194

basecalls towards the 3’-end of the pyrosequenced SARS-CoV-2 fragment. As a preliminary

195

conclusion we first highlight that the proposed pyrosequencing approach does not negatively affect

196

preceding RT-qPCR pipeline in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. Second, it adds important value to RT-

197

qPCR, where this method alone delivers conflicting results, particularly close to the detection limits

198

qPCR (CT values >30). In RT-qPCR alone even negative samples frequently exhibit curves crossing

199

the threshold within a range between CT≈30 and CT≈35 complicating mainly the reliable

200

discrimination between PCR-negatives and PCR-false-negatives.

201

In a next step, after protocol implementation we checked the sustainability of the combined RT-

202

qPCR/pyrosequencing method in an epidemiological field test.

Performance of the combined methods of RT-qPCR and pyrosequencing in epidemiologic field study

on pediatric patients from two German medical centers

We tested our combined RT-qPCR/pyrosequencing method on two pediatric cohorts from two German

207

medical centers comprising 769 children in total (n=599 [Wuppertal]; n=170 [Kassel], who had no

208

indication for routine SARS-CoV-2 testing at presentation according to WHO criteria. After initial S-

some cases. Even for RT-qPCR results with relatively high CT values, successive pyrosequencing

211

could unambiguously confirm SARS-CoV-2 infections. Where possible, we investigated SARS-CoV-

212

2-specific immunity. In sum, using retrospectively the combined RT-qPCR/pyrosequencing method,

213

we confirmed 6 pediatric cases of SARS-CoV-2-associated diseases among the entire cohort

214

exhibiting heterogenous presentation:

215
216

Brief case report 1. Adolescent male with sore throat (age group 13-17 years)

217

During the 2020 spring peak of incremental SARS-CoV-2 transmission at end of April an

218

adolescent male patient presented at the emergency department in slightly reduced general

219

condition with 37.5°C body temperature and reddened throat. The clinical examination was

220

otherwise completely normal. At time of presentation the patient did not fulfill the criteria for

221

routine SARS-CoV-2 testing. The specimen was incidentally tested and classified potentially

222

being SARS-CoV-2-positive in the course of our serial examination of the Wuppertal pediatric

223

cohort using the newly developed S-gene amplicon target for singleplex RT-qPCR (repetitive CT

224

values: 25.47 and 25.33). The result was unambiguously confirmed by pyrosequencing and

225

backed-up by positive RT-qPCR results using the ORF E (CT value: 23.78), ORF N (CT value:

226

27.47) and RdRP (CT value: 31.23) amplicon targets. Three months after first presentation, the

227

patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (34.20 +; Roche), strongly suggesting

228

that the boy underwent an inconspicuous course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Brief case report 2. Female toddler with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C)

231

(age group 1-3 years)

232

A female toddler was admitted to the hospital with altered general status and undulant fever. The

233

initial physical examination revealed tonsillitis without any cardio-respiratory affections.

234

Laboratory analyses revealed highly elevated C reactive protein (24.0 mg/dL [normal<0.5]) with

235

almost normal interleukin-6 levels at 55.2 pg/ml. Interestingly, no leukocytosis or lymphopenia

236

were diagnosed. In the clinical course, symptoms reminiscent of Kawasaki-like disease included

237

persistent fever, bilateral conjunctivitis, cheilitis and a maculopapular exanthema. Furthermore,

238

echocardiography exhibited enlargement of the left coronary artery and pericardial effusion

239

(Figure S4A). Cardiac related blood parameters were within the normal ranges. Under the

240

suspicion of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-

241

19 [5, 6] she was given intravenous gamma globulins (2 g/kg), prednisolone (2 mg/kg) and

242

acetylsalicylic acid (50 mg/kg) at day five which resulted in rapid improvement of the girl’s

243

general status. Apyrexia was achieved on day seven. At day ten of hospitalization SARS-CoV-2

244

RT-qPCR tests were negative.

245
246

Brief case report 3. Pre-school boy with high grade fever (age group 4-6 years)

247

A pre-school boy with bowel disease history presented at the paediatric emergency department

248

with a history of one day high-grade fever. Clinical examination did not reveal a specific focus. He

249

was admitted for suspected sepsis and started on intravenous antibiotics. After one day the

250

condition of the patient and the inflammatory markers improved. The blood culture confirmed a

251

bacterial bloodstream infection (BSI). On day 2 of inpatient care, the patient developed facial,

252

neck and upper limb oedema, vein distention in the upper chest and shortness of breath suggestive

253

of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. CT-angiography of the chest confirmed this diagnosis

254

demonstrating a stenosis of the SVC (lumen diameter 1.4 mm), adjacent thrombosis and multiple

255

collateral veins draining towards an enlarged vena azygos. Retrospectively, we uncovered a co-

256

infection with SARS-CoV-2, which presumably was temporally associated with the BSI. Mean CT

257

value of repetitive RT-qPCR was relatively high (CT: 34.06) with conspicuous curve shape.

258

SARS-CoV-2 was unambiguously confirmed by pyrosequencing.

262

A male prepubescent secondary school child presented to the emergency department in late March

263

2020 complaining about a ‘bump’ behind his left ear. Otherwise, he was completely

264

asymptomatic. Clinical examination revealed a non-tender swelling behind the left ear of about 7-

265

8 mm in diameter which was interpreted as an enlarged lymph node as well as slightly enlarged

266

cervical lymph nodes on the same site. No cardiac, neurological, pulmonary or gastrointestinal

267

abnormalities were note and the patient was sent home. At time of presentation the patient did not

268

fulfill the criteria for routine SARS-CoV-2 testing. Mean CT value of repetitive RT-qPCR was

269

relatively high (CT: 35.56) with conspicuous curve shape. SARS-CoV-2 was unambiguously

A female adolescent presented late in March 2020 with high fever up to 40.2°C, hepatomegaly and

274

tonsillitis. She was found to have acute Epstein-Barr-Virus infection and was discharged home 3

275

days later without fever in good general condition. Nine days later she presented again with low

276

temperature up 38.4°C, general malaise and slightly increased liver enzymes. All other diagnostic

277

test at that time – including abdominal ultrasound, laboratory studies and urine analysis – were

278

normal. During the following two days she improved spontaneously and was discharged home. At

279

that time symptoms were believed to be associated with the recent EBV infection. No SARS-CoV-

280

2 testing was performed since the patient did not fulfill the clinical criteria for suspected Covid-19

281

at that time. Mean CT value of repetitive RT-qPCR was relatively high (CT: 32.80) with

282

conspicuous curve shape. SARS-CoV-2 was unambiguously confirmed by pyrosequencing. In

283

October 2020 the patient was found to have IgA and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-

284

CoV-2 ELISA, EUROIMMUN).

Brief case report 6: Male toddler with generalized febrile seizure (age group 1-3 years)

287

A male toddler was admitted late in March 2020 due to a generalized febrile seizure which

288

spontaneously resolved after 4 min. The parents reported that he developed a low-grade fever up

to 38.6°C several hours prior the event. He also had moderate diarrhoea with three to four pulpy

290

bowel movements per days and vomited three times on the day of admission. The parents did not

291

note any mucous or blood. On admission, clinical examination was unremarkable except for mild

292

pharyngitis, intestinal hyperperistalsis and mild dehydration. Differential blood count, liver

293

enzymes, blood gases, electrolytes, C-reactive protein as well as urine analyses (except for ketone

294

bodies) were all normal. Stool tests came back negative for Rotavirus, Norovirus, Shigella,

295

Campylobacter, Salmonella and Yersinia. The patient received intravenous fluids and was

296

discharged two days later without fever in good clinical condition. At that time the patient was

297

diagnosed with mild gastroenteritis and secondary uncomplicated generalized febrile seizure. RT-

298

qPCR and pyrosequencing confirmed a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Discussion

301

Numerous confounding factors influence the outcome of RT-qPCR in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics

302

Whereas reverse transcription and subsequent quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) are key methods for the

303

detection of SARS-CoV-2 and local as well as global pandemic surveillance, it is well known that

304

several confounding factors can lead to false-negative results. It seems clear that the time course of

305

SARS-CoV-2 load in the days after infection massively influences the predictive value of the RT-

306

qPCR tests. A recent study discovered a median false-negative rate as high as 38% (CI, 18% to 65%)

307

even at the day of symptom onset, although concomitantly SARS-CoV-2 load seems to be close to its

308

highest levels. Moreover, few days before and after symptom onset the false-negative SARS-CoV-2

309

discovery rate by RT-qPCR seems to worsen dramatically [7]. Besides the time point of specimens

310

sampling post-infection, heterogeneities in specimens sampling technique, transportation, storage

311

conditions, nucleic acids purification, laboratory equipment, staff experience but also RT-qPCR

312

conditions might be among the most important factors influencing test qualities. Very early in 2020

313

the WHO started to disseminate the ‘Charité protocol’ for the diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2 by

314

RT-qPCR. Therein, a strategy for the combinatorial use of PCR primers (#name_F/#name_R) and

315

TaqMan probes (#name_P) was described with amplicon targets in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent

316

RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene as well as in the open reading frames (ORF) E and N

317

(E_Sarbeco_F/_P1/_R; N_Sarbeco_F/_P/_R; RdRP_SARSr-F/_P2/_R) (Table S1) [8]. As of

318

November 10th 2020, PubMed reported 976 citations for this article, suggesting the widespread use of

319

the contained protocols for SARS-CoV-2 detection in association with the global attempt of pandemic

320

surveillance and containment measures. However, several RT-qPCR assays are being used by clinical,

321

research and public health laboratories and some studies suggest that there could be relevant

322

differences in the efficiencies, sensitivities and specificities of the different amplicon targets under

323

different laboratory conditions, in particular for the RdRP_SARSr amplicon [9, 10]. Remarkably, RT-

324

qPCR does not exclusively target genomic SARS-CoV-2 amplicons, but (dependent on the selected

325

primers) logically also can amplify the transcribed shorter subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs). At least

326

two deep-sequencing studies on coronavirus transcriptomes (HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2) reported

327

a dominant coverage of mapped reads towards the 3’-end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, possibly due

328

to an abundance of the sgRNAs [11, 12]. Notably, these sgRNAs encode conserved structural proteins

329

with the Spike glycoprotein (S), the envelope protein (E) and the nucleocapsid protein (N) being

330

among them. For the nonstructural RdRP, in contrast, the genomic (+)RNA itself becomes expressed

331

by genome translation and ribosomal frameshifting [13]. The coverage of mapped reads was

332

comparatively lower for the RdRP encoding ORF1b as well as the 5’-proximal ORF1a than for the

333

sgRNA encoding 3’-end. However, it remains poorly understood so far how oscillations in the

334

expression of SARS-CoV-2 sgRNAs might contribute to the observed variations in qPCR testing.

335

Therefore, we aimed to develop a confirmatory test for a stably expressed SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA

336

amplicon target that can complement RT-qPCR strategies without disturbing established and

337

automatable laboratory workflows. In particular, we intended to develop a pyrosequencing assay that

338

would allow, subsequent to RT-qPCR, the categorical confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infections in

339

acute cases, where the clinical suspicion is high, but the SARS-CoV-2 infection cannot be ruled out by

340

RT-qPCR alone. The proposed pyrosequencing approach does not negatively affect preceding RT-

341

qPCR pipelines in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and can therefore add important value to RT-qPCR,

342

where this method alone delivers conflicting results. Particularly, this can happen close to the

343

detection limits qPCR, practically CT values >30. Frequently, even negative samples exhibit curves

344

crossing the threshold within a range between CT≈30 and CT≈35 complicating the reliable

345

discrimination between PCR-negative and PCR-false-negative specimens. Theoretically, also PCR-

346

false-positives results could happen, but practically we did not observe any case of false-positive

347

diagnosis within the numerous confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens from clinical routine

348

testing used during the entire phase of RT-qPCR/pyrosequencing development. Here, we have shown

349

that pyrosequencing can be a powerful complementary method of specific and sensitive SARS-CoV-2

350

case confirmation, without affecting foregoing routine RT-qPCR. But even here, lower template

351

concentrations led to the occasional occurrence of miscalled bases (missing bases: red triangle; excess

352

bases: blue triangle) and gradual convergence of signal and noise peaks. Gradually, this led to

353

increasingly misinterpreted peak heights particularly for nucleotide repeat motifs and lower

354

complexity motifs. Whereas concomitantly, automated basecalling gradually failed to separate signal

355

from noise, the SARS-CoV-2 specific sequence could be identified by manual inspection much longer.

356

Manufacturer’s adaptations to the basecalling algorithm could lead to an improvement. Moreover, for

357

each nucleotide position we used an ‘open’ pyrosequencing dispensation order (assuming N [i.e. C, G,

358

A or T] as possible nucleotides for each position) in order to detect variable positions. From the end

359

users’ sides, a SARS-CoV-2 specific dispensation order could possibly lead to an improved automated

360

basecalling sensitivity. However, being aware that any further sample treatment in laboratory routine

361

would impair the necessary high throughput testing, in particular in the course of SARS-CoV-2

362

surveillance, we see the main application opportunities for combined RT-qPCR/pyrosequencing in

363

research for retrospective epidemiology studies, longitudinal studies of the course of COVID-19 cases

364

and studies on pathomechanisms, in particular if they aim on systemic surveys of virus-host

365

interaction.

366
367

Several cases with unusual presentations of pediatric SARS-CoV-2-infections were uncovered

368

Exemplarily for the implementation of the developed experimental pipeline for an epidemiological

369

survey, we conducted a field study in search for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients without obvious

370

common SARS-CoV-2 associated symptoms, since the majority of cases pediatric SARS-CoV-2

371

infections develop only very mild disease courses [14]. In a very recent UK national cohort study on

372

neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection 66 SARS-CoV-2-positive babies could be identified, who at day of

373

presentation exhibited hyperthermia, poor feeding, vomiting, coryza, other respiratory signs and

374

lethargy as the most common signs of infection or, respectively, no signs of infection at all [15]. On

375

the other hand, an unknown fraction of SARS-CoV-2 infections in childhood seem to fundamentally

376

differ from adults and can be more heterogeneous in their presentation. The most striking example is

377

Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), a rare SARS-CoV-2-induced Kawasaki-

378

like hyperinflammatory syndrome [5, 6]. Another recent study reports that children and adults can

379

exhibit a very different antibody responses upon SARS-CoV-2-infections across the clinical spectrum

380

of associated diseases, which do not obligatorily match the adult COVID-19 spectrum [16].

381

Necessarily, the association unusual symptoms with acute infections will contribute to our

382

understanding about the heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2-borne diseases in general and particularly in

383

children. Using two large pediatric cohorts for a field study, we have successfully demonstrated in this

384

study that combined RT-qPCR/pyrosequencing is a reliable tool that allows the faithful confirmation

385

of less distinctive or asymptomatic cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection close to the detection limits of

386

RT-qPCR. Here, the determination of a SARS-CoV-2-specific sequence fragment can decisively help

387

to improve reliability for cases where the discrimination between negative/false-negative RT-qPCR

388

reports can be important. Whereas this might possibly be of subordinate importance for practical

389

containment measures because low viral load could be associated with low infectiousness, it can

390

contribute to recognize the still probably underestimated extent of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and

391

associated mild or asymptomatic presentations. In particular, from a large cohort of children who did

392

not fulfil the criteria for SARS-CoV-2 testing we have retrospectively identified 6 cases of SARS-

393

CoV-2 related symptoms. The identification and characterization of this cases will thus contribute to

394

the understanding of the full heterogenous picture of presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

395
396

Conclusions

397

The proposed protocol allows the specific and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 close to the

398

detection limits of RT-qPCR. Combined RT-qPCR/pyrosequencing does not negatively affect

diseases in childhood, which can fundamentally differ from adults and can be more heterogeneous in

405

Methods

406

Sampling of pediatric and adult human specimens

407

Nasopharyngeal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens were collected at Helios University

408

Hospital Wuppertal (North Rhine-Westphalia, Western Germany) and Klinikum Kassel (Hessen,

409

Central Germany) with approval of the Witten/Herdecke University ethics commitee (covered by

410

‘CoronaKids’ [No. 61/2020] and No. 160/2020 for the use of routinely sampled and confirmed

411

specimens for RT-qPCR/pyrosequencing method establishment). Informed written consent was

412

obtained from legal guardians of the involved children. All work has been conducted according to the

413

principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.

414
415

Storage and nucleic acids isolation

416

Specimens included nasopharyngeal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, which underwent

417

routine COVID-19 diagnostic testing. Pediatric cohort specimens were collected using brushes from

418

the Gentra Puregene Buccal Cell Kit (100) (Qiagen, Cat. No. 158845) and then stabilized in 500 µL

419

RNAlater™ (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. AM7021). All specimens were stocked at -80°C.

420

Total RNA was purified from 250 µL liquid specimen using 750 µL QIAzol lysis reagent (Qiagen,

421

Cat. No. 158845) upon manufacturer’s recommendations. RNA quality and quantity were assessed by

422

microcapillary electrophoresis using the Small RNA kit (Agilent, Cat. No. 5067-1548) and the Agilent

423

Bioanalyzer 2100 instrument.

424

Importantly, we determined that long term storage (to date, up to 9 months) under these conditions

425

allows unbiases RT-qPCR analyses. However, we note that repeated freeze and thaw cycles of stored

426

specimens as well as purified RNA affect sample quality and result in gradually increasing CT values.

427
428

RT-qPCR

429

Quantitative analyses of SARS-CoV-2 (+)RNA from human specimen was carried out combining

430

reverse transcription and qPCR in a one-step protocol using Luna Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR

431

Kit w/o ROX (New England Biolabs, Cat. No. E3007E) on a Corbett Rotor-Gene 6000 instrument.

432

Primers and probes are described above and listed (Table S1). Per reaction, each primer and probes

433

were used at 500 nM. 2 µL of purified template RNA were used for each single reaction volume of

434

20 µL. RT-qPCR conditions were as follows: Reverse transcription (RT) (60°C/30 min), initial

435

denaturation and Hot Start Taq polymerase activation 95°C/2 min, cycling (36x[denaturation

436

95°C/15 s, extension 60°C/30 s]) and final extension 68°C/5 min. 36 qPCR cycles were determined to

437

largely avoid multiple unspecific byproducts and giving rise of sufficient amounts of biotinylated

438

amplicon for subsequent pyrosequencing purposes. This amplicon could be used directly for

439

pyrosequencing.

440
441

Pyrosequencing

442

Pyrosequencing of the biotinylated single-stranded S-gene amplicon was performed on a

443

PyroMark Q48 Autoprep device (Qiagen). The PyroMark Q48 Advanced CpG Reagents (4x 48)

444

(Qiagen, Cat. No. 974002) including dNTPs, substrates and enzymes are loaded to the assigned

445

cartridges with volumes being adapted to the assay requirements. The designed approach theoretically

446

allows to read a SARS-CoV-2 (+)RNA-specific sequence fragment of 55 nt. Further, the sequencing

447

primer (Spbc-CoV-2-S) was added to the assigned cartridge in a predetermined volume. 10 µL of each

448

RT-qPCR amplicon were loaded to each well of a PyroMark Q48 Disc and then 3 µL PyroMark Q48

449

Magnetic Beads (300) (Qiagen, Cat. No. 974203) were added to each reaction. The sequencing

450

reaction was initiated after denaturation and subsequent magnetic bead capture of the biotinylated

451

single-stranded S-gene amplicon. The pyrosequencing software records the light signals corresponding

452

to each well in the PyroMark Q48 Disc and saves the data graphically. Basecalled pyrograms were

Figure 1. 7-days incidence development in Germany between 2020 calendar weeks 10-49. According

557

to the laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case numbers continuously reported by the Robert-Koch-

558

Institute (www.RKI.de) the 7-days-incidence for pediatric infections increased very reminiscent of

559

most other age-groups. At least for the age groups between 0-14 years, this development contrasts the

560

spring situation, when these children were less affected than other age-groups.

Figure 2. Comparison of homologous protein sequence segments (A.) and corresponding cDNA

563

segments (B.) between human coronaviruses. A. We applied the Clustal W algorithm of MEGA [17]

564

to conduct multiple-sequence alignments using the translated protein sequences of the SARS-CoV-2

565

Spike (S) glycoprotein and homologous S protein sequences from other human coronaviruses. Here, a

566

segment harboring polybasic cleavage motif (Q644 to T720 with respect to SARS-CoV-2 S protein).

567

The highlighted residues are conserved in most human coronavirus (black shaded) or are similar

568

between some human coronaviruses (grey shaded). The colored boxes are framing residues, which

569

correspond to the target position of tested oligonucleotides: forward primer (red), probe/sequencing

570

primer (blue), reverse primer (magenta). B. The aligned protein sequences were backtranslated into the

571

encoding cDNA sequences. Similarly, as described above for protein sequences, black or grey shading

572

was used to illustrate identical or similar nucleotide positions. For combined RT-qPCR and

573

pyrosequencing, we selected the following marked sequences for oligonucleotide design: 1. Forward

574

primer (red box/arrow); 2. TaqMan probe with 5’-HEX and 3’-BBQ-650 modifications (blue

575

box/line); 3. Sequencing primer without end-modification (blue box – same sequence as TaqMan

576

Probe); 4. Reverse primer with 5’-Biotin-TEG (magenta box/arrow).

concentrations led to the occasional occurrence of miscalled bases (missing bases: red triangle; excess

599

bases: blue triangle) and gradual convergence of signal and noise peaks. Whereas concomitantly,

600

automated basecalling gradually failed to separate signal from noise, the SARS-CoV-2 specific

601

sequence could be identified by manual inspection much longer.

Figure S1. Results of semi-quantitative PCR for the performance comparison using GITC-

648

purified RNA or stabilized raw specimens as RT-qPCR substrates. Four confirmed SARS-CoV-2-

649

positive specimens (p1 to p4) were used in combination with primer pairs targeting Orf E, RdRP, Orf

650

N and S-gene amplicons in singleplex qPCR reactions. From GITC-purified templates, amplicons with

651

the correct size could be amplified from all specimens. Notably, we observed lower molecular weight

652

byproducts for Orf E PCR. From stabilized raw specimens, in contrast, the Orf E amplicon was not

653

amplified from none of the four samples. With varying band intensity, amplicons with correct sizes

654

were amplified from stabilized raw samples for all cases for RdRP and S-gene targets and in some

655

cases for the Orf N target. However, for unknown reasons, band intensities appeared less stable when

656

compared with purified RNA samples. Moreover, we observed lower molecular weight byproducts in

657

some cases.

Figure S2. Results of semi-quantitative PCR of the SARS-CoV-2 S-gene amplicon. A. After 36

661

PCR cycles and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis the specific 162 bp amplicon corresponding to

662

the SARS-CoV-2 protein S-gene was visible (red arrow). The gel was loaded with 8 RT-qPCR

663

samples from confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive cases (p1 to p8) and 1 negative control (n1). The

664

occasional weak appearance of PCR byproducts (see p1) seemed to correlate with relatively low viral

665

(+)RNA load in the specimen. B. An excess of PCR cycles (40x) leads to enrichment of unspecific

666

lower and higher molecular weight byproducts in all samples from confirmed positive samples (p1 to

667

p9) as well as negative controls (n1 to n3). These byproducts severely impaired the successive

668

pyrosequencing leading to ambiguous results.

Figure S3. Results of a triplex PCR approach for the simultaneous detection of amplicon targets

for RdRP, Orf E and Orf N. For comparison, 14 SARS-CoV-2-negative samples (n1 to n14) and 11

676

confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The

677

simultaneous use of primers for RdRP, Orf E and Orf N amplicons leads to enrichment of unspecific

678

lower and higher molecular weight byproducts in all samples, confirmed positives as well as

679

negatives. Remarkably, in the fraction of negative samples bands of approx. 160 bp appear frequently.
