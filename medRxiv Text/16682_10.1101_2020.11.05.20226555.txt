Abstract
Background. The approach to diagnosing, treating and monitoring severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection relies strongly on laboratory resources,
with serological testing representing the mainstay for studying the onset, nature and
persistence of humoral immune response. This study was aimed at evaluating the analytical
performance of the novel Beckman Coulter anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG chemiluminescent
immunoassay.
Methods. This analytical assessment encompassed the calculation of intra-assay, interassay and total imprecision, linearity, limit of blank (LOB), limit of detection (LOD),
functional sensitivity, and comparison of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies values obtained on
paired serum samples using DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG and Roche Elecsys
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies. Diagnostic performance was also tested against results
of molecular testing on nasopharyngeal swabs, collected over the previous 4 months.
Results. Intra-assay, inter-assay and total imprecision of Beckman Coulter anti-SARSCoV-2 IgG were between 4.3-4.8%, 2.3-3.9% and 4.9-6.2%, respectively. The linearity of
the assay was excellent between 0.11-18.8 antibody titers. The LOB, LOD and functional
sensitivity were 0.02, 0.02 and 0.05, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy (area under the
curve; AUC) of Beckman Coulter anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG compared to molecular testing
was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.91; p<0.001) using manufacturer’s cut-off, and increased to 0.90
(95% CI, 0.86-0.94; p<0.001) with antibody titers. The AUC was non-significantly
different from that of Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, but was always higher than that of
DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG. The correlation of Beckman Coulter Access
SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75-0.84; p<0.001) with Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-

represents a valuable resource for large and accurate seroprevalence surveys.

Introduction
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) can now be considered the biggest tragedy
that has affected humanity since the end of the Second World War, in 1945 (1). With over
1.3 million casualties so far and following an epidemic trajectory that is very unlikely to
reverse soon, the ongoing severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) pandemic outbreak is deeply disrupting health care, economy and even social
relationships in all worldwide countries (2).
It is now virtually unquestionable that the approach for diagnosing, treating and
monitoring COVID-19 shall be strongly based on laboratory investigations, with three
levels of in vitro diagnostic tests (3). Molecular or antigenic detection of SARS-CoV-2
represents the mainstay for diagnosing an acute infection, and thereby for isolating or
treating infected and potentially infective patients (4). Routine hematological and
biochemical testing is essential for defining disease severity and for eventually predicting
illness progression (5), whilst serological testing, which can be defined as a diagnostic
investigation used for revealing and monitoring the development of an immune response
against a given pathogen (6), is essentially aimed at unraveling as to whether some subjects
have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and have then developed a humoral immune response,
as reflected by production of different classes of antiviral immunoglobulins (IgG) (7).
Serological testing can hence find its most rationale foundation within the context of
seroprevalence studies, for assessing nature and extent of humoral immunity against SARSCoV-2, for screening convalescent plasma, for monitoring herd immunity, either natural or
consequent to widespread vaccination, as well as for supporting molecular testing in some
well-defined circumstances (7).

The serological assessment of patients who currently have, or have developed, a
certain or presumptive SARS-CoV-2 infection is extremely variegated, especially in terms
of antibodies tested, analytical methods and turnaround time (8). Briefly, the immunoassays
for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been developed against single
immunoglobulin classes (i.e., IgA, IgM or IgG) or against total immunoglobulins, can be
either based on laboratory-based or point of care (POC) techniques, and encompasses a vast
array of analytical principles, spanning from rapid lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs),
manual enzymatic linked immunosorbent assay (ELISAs), to fully automated techniques
such as chemiluminescence (CLIAs) or fluorescent (FIA) immunoassays (9,10).
Irrespective of the assay and its purpose, the Task Force on COVID-19 of the
International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) strongly
advises that each method must be accurately evaluated and validated before being
introduced into routine SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics (11). According to this clear-cut
preamble, the main aim of this study was to evaluate the analytical performance of a novel
anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay, recently developed and commercialized by Beckman
Coulter.

Materials and Methods
Immunoassay description
The novel Beckman Coulter Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Beckman Coulter Inc.,
Brea, CA, USA) is a two-step CLIA. Briefly, 20 μL of patient sample are mixed with buffer
within a reaction cuvette along with paramagnetic particles coated with recombinant
SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein containing the amino acid sequence of the receptor binding
domain (RBD). After incubation, the antibodies bound to the solid phase are sequestrated

thorough generation of a magnetic field, whilst unbound material is eliminated by washing.
An anti-human IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate monoclonal antibody is then added,
followed by second mixture separation by washing, for removing unbound conjugate
material. A chemiluminescent substrate is finally pipetted into the cuvette, and the amount
of light generated is measured using a luminometer. The amount of light produced is
plotted versus the cut-off value calculated during assay calibration. Final results ≥1 are
reported as being reactive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, values between 0.8-1.0 as
equivocal and those ≤0.80 as non-reactive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. The calibration
curve is stable for up to 28 days and the entire assay can be completed within 32 min.

Method evaluation
The assessment of this novel Beckman Coulter Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG
immunoassay on UniCel DxI800 has originally encompassed the calculation of intra-assay,
inter-assay and total imprecision, linearity, limit of blank (LOB), limit of detection (LOD),
functional sensitivity, as well as comparison of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies values
obtained on paired serum samples using two other commercial anti-SARS-CoV-2
immunoassays, as comprehensively described below. Serological testing was carried out
using routine serum samples collected in 5 mL Vacutainer tubes (Greiner, with separation
gel), from the healthcare personal working in the hospital of Trieste, Italy. All samples
were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 15 min at room temperature. Serum was then separated
from the underneath cell layer, and 1 mL aliquot stored in 3 mL Criovial and frozen at –
20°C. At time of testing, the aliquot was allowed to thaw at room temperature, was then
accurately mixed and used for serological assessment. An identical lot of reagents and the
same calibration curves were used for all assays, throughout the study period.

Imprecision
The intra-assay, inter-assay and total imprecision of Beckman Coulter Access
SARS-CoV-2 IgG has been calculated using two serum samples displaying low (i.e., below
the cut-off: ~0.11) and high (i.e., above the cut-off: ~8.33) high anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG
titers. Specifically, intra- and inter-assay imprecision were assayed in 10 consecutive
replicate runs and 10 consecutive working days (duplicate measure every day),
respectively. The imprecision of the assay has been finally calculated as coefficient of
variation (CV%). Total imprecision has been was estimated according to the equation
suggested by Krouwer and Rablnowitz (12).

Linearity
The linearity of Beckman Coulter Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG has been assessed by
measuring in duplicate serial dilutions (e.g., from 1:9 to 9:1) of a serum sample with high
anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titer (i.e.,18.8) and a second serum sample with low anti-SARSCoV-2 IgG titer (i.e., 0.11). The estimated and measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG values
were then correlated with linear fit, and with calculation of Spearman’s correlation.

Limit of blank, limit of detection and functional sensitivity
The LOB and LOD were calculated using the formula [LOB] = [mean value] +
[1.645]×[standard deviation, SD)] of 20 replicates of sample buffer, and [LOD] = [LOB] +
[1.645]×[Standard Deviation] of 20 replicates of a serum sample with the lowest
measurable anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titer, as suggested by Armbruster and Pry (13). The
functional sensitivity of the method was calculated as the lowest anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG

measurable value with arbitrary imprecision set at ≤10%. Specifically, it was estimated
with measurement of 8 different 1:2 scalar dilutions with sample buffer (from 1:1 to 1:128)
of a routine serum sample with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titer of 8.82. The scalar dilutions
were then tested with 10 consecutive replicates, with calculation of imprecision obtained
for each dilution. A model fit was developed for extrapolating the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG
value which could be assayed with ≤10% imprecision.

Diagnostic performance and immunoassays comparison
As previously mentioned, comparison studies were based on a seroprevalence
survey carried out using on serum samples of healthcare professionals working at the
hospital of Trieste, who also had a nasopharyngeal swab collected over the preceding 4
months. The results of Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG were then compared with those obtained
on paired serum samples using DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG and Roche
Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies. The characteristics of the three immunoassays
are summarized in table 1. The concordance of SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers obtained with
the three methods was evaluated using Spearman’s correlation, whilst the agreement with
molecular testing, and more precisely the area under the curve (AUC), diagnostic
agreement, diagnostic sensitivity and diagnostic specificity, were calculated using Receiver
Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve analyses. The diagnostic agreement with results of
molecular testing was estimated with either continuous (i.e., antibody titer) or dichotomous
(positive or negative results compared to manufacturers’ cut-offs) data. Molecular testing
for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA on nasopharyngeal samples was carried out with Allplex
2019-nCoV Assay (BioRad, Basel, Switzerland), whose technical and analytical
characteristic have been previously described elsewhere (14).

Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed using Analyse-it (Analyse-it Software Ltd,
Leeds, UK). The entire investigation was based on pre-existing serum samples, collected
for routine SARS-CoV-2 testing during a hospital seroprevalence study, and thereby no
patient’s informed consent or Ethical Committee approval were necessary.

Results
Imprecision
The results of imprecision study using two serum samples with low and high antiSARS-CoV-2 IgG titers are shown in table 2. Briefly, the intra-assay, inter-assay and total
imprecision were comprised between 4.3-4.8%, 2.3-3.9% and 4.9-6.2%, respectively.

Linearity
The linearity of the novel Beckman Coulter Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG was found to
be excellent over the range of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers tested. More specifically, the
linearity (Spearman’s correlation) was found to be r=0.997 (p<0.001) between anti-SARSCoV-2 IgG titers of 0.11 and 18.8.

Limit of blank, limit of detection and functional sensitivity
The LOB, LOD and functional sensitivity (antibody titer), calculated according to
the criteria previously mentioned, were found to be 0.02, 0.02 and 0.05, respectively.
Notably, the latest sample dilution (i.e., 1:128), corresponding to anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG

antibody titer of 0.05, was associated with ~6% imprecision. It is hence predictable that the
functional sensitivity of this immunoassay could have been even lower than this value.

Diagnostic performance and immunoassays comparison
The final sample size for diagnostic performance and immunoassays comparison
studies consisted of 305 serum samples collected form hospital workers undergoing routine
SARS-CoV-2 testing, for whom a definitive result (negative or positive) of molecular test
on nasopharyngeal swab was available within the previous 4 months (range 0.5-4.0
months), which is the most suitable diagnostic window for detecting IgG humoral
immunity against SARS-CoV-2 (15). The diagnostic performance of the three different
immunoassays (i.e., Beckman Coulter Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG, DiaSorin Liaison SARSCoV-2 S1/S2 IgG and Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2) versus results of molecular
testing are shown in figure 1.
As concerns the diagnostic accuracy using manufacturers’ cut-off (Figure 1a),
Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 displayed the highest AUC (0.87; 95% CI, 0.84-0.91;
p<0.001), followed by Beckman Coulter Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG (0.83; 95% CI, 0.790.88; p<0.001) and DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG (0.74; 95% CI, 0.70-0.78).
Notably, the AUCs of Beckman Coulter Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Roche Elecsys
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 were not found to be statistically different (p=0.06), but were both
significantly higher than that of DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG (both p<0.001).
The diagnostic sensitivity at manufacturers’ cut-off (Table 1) was 0.98 for Roche Elecsys
Anti-SARS-CoV-2, 0.94 for DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG and 0.79 for
Beckman Coulter Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG, whilst the diagnostic specificity was 0.84 for

Beckman Coulter Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG, 0.76 for Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2
and 0.52 for DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, respectively.
The diagnostic accuracy using antibody titers is shown in figure 1b. The AUCs of
all the three immunoassays appeared significantly improved, with Roche Elecsys AntiSARS-CoV-2 (0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.93; p<0.001) and Beckman Coulter Access SARSCoV-2 IgG (0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.94; p<0.001) displaying almost identical performance,
and thus outstripping the diagnostic accuracy of DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG
(0.84; 95% CI, 0.80-0.88). As for the diagnostic performance calculated using
manufacturers’ cut-off, the AUCs of Beckman Coulter Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG (p<0.001)
and Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (p=0.01) antibodies titers were found to be both
significantly higher than that of DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, whilst they
were not significantly different between them (p=0.785). According to these results, the
newly calculated diagnostic cut-offs, displaying the best performance for each assay, were
as follows: 0.17 for Beckman Coulter Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG (1.00 sensitivity and 0.75
specificity); 0.36 for Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (1.00 sensitivity and 0.76
specificity); 22.9 for DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG (0.85 sensitivity and 0.67
specificity).
The Spearman’s correlation among the three different anti-SARS-CoV-2 CLIAs is
shown in figure 2. The correlation of Beckman Coulter Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 0.80
(95% CI, 0.75-0.84; p<0.001) with Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and 0.72 (95% CI,
0.66-0.77; p<0.001) with DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, respectively, whilst
was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.61-0.73; p<0.001) between Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and
DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG.

Discussion
Serological and seroprevalence surveys are considered an essential aspect for the
clinical, economical and societal management of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic
outbreak (16). The identification of a humoral immune response developed against the
target pathogen (i.e., SARS-CoV-2) is indeed the most important information that can be
garnered from this type of testing, and that can then be straightforwardly used for
establishing seroprevalence in specific geographies, environments or settings (i.e.,
communities, healthcare facilities, schools and so forth) (17), for studying nature,
progression and duration of herd immunity (either natural or artificial) (18), for monitoring
disease progression (19), as well as for complementing nucleic acid amplification testing
(NAAT) under specific circumstances (20). Despite these important aspects, evidence
remains that the analytical and diagnostic performance of many of marketed anti-SARSCoV-2 tests is still limited, remains poorly validated, or even completely untested, thus
contributing to raise serious doubts on their real clinical usefulness (21). Although highquality serological assays are hence increasingly developed by many manufacturers all
around the world, their implementation in laboratories of all size and nature needs to be
anticipated by extensive validation of their analytical and clinical features, that would
hence define their precise setting within a COVID-19 diagnostic pathway.
The novel Beckman Coulter Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay has been
developed for being used within routine workflow, and thus assisting clinical laboratories
of virtually all dimensions and types for screening the presence of humoral (IgG) immune
response against the virus in patients, healthcare professional and even in large community
populations. Its suitability for full automation, characterized by random accessibility,
contained turnaround time and high throughput, will enable rapid responses to massive

testing programs, so enormously enhancing the efficiency of laboratory diagnostics within
the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics.
Our assessment of the analytical performance of this novel fully-automated CLIA
has revealed a good repeatability profile, with total imprecision lower than ~6%, a value
that seems aligned with, or even better than, that reported in published evaluations of other
commercially available anti-SARS-CoV-2 CLIAs (22-25). The linearity profile was also
found to be optimal, in a range of IgG antibody titers between 0.11 and over 18, which is an
upper limit of interval covering the vast majority of patient samples tested in the present
study (302/305; >98%). The LoB, LoD and functional sensitivity were also found to be
excellent, with a functional sensitivity that would enable to obtain a clinically usable
antibody titers in most patients with ongoing or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.
As concerns the diagnostic performance of Beckman Coulter Access anti-SARSCoV-2 IgG immunoassay, the AUC of this method was found to be non-significantly
different from that of Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, an immunoassay specifically
aimed at measuring total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, but definitely better than the AUC
of DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG. It is hence conceivable that Beckman
Coulter Access anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG could be reliably used as surrogate of total
antibodies within seroprevalence studies. This is not surprising since an abrupt and
relatively rapid decline of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and even IgA antibodies has been clearly
described in patients with COVID-19 (26), thus making the assessment of antibodies
classes other than IgG questionable (or even misleading) when performed weeks or months
after symptoms relief. Nonetheless, unlike Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 which targets
the viral nucleocapsid protein, the Beckman Coulter Access anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG CLIA
has been developed against the spike protein and, more specifically, against the RBD. This

would inherently mean that IgG quantification with this method would better mirror
neutralizing activity compared to other immunoassays developed against different antigenic
domains of SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, our data are in keeping with those recently
published by Tan et al., who also found an AUC of 0.947 in samples collected 21-64 days
from symptom onset (27). Although we found that Beckman Coulter Access anti-SARSCoV-2 IgG immunoassay exhibited a slightly lower diagnostic sensitivity compared to that
reported by Chua et al using the manufacturer’s cut-off (i.e., 0.79 vs. 0.85) (28), local
recalculation of the diagnostic threshold was effective to enhance the diagnostic sensitivity
to 1.00 (vs. 0.79), while only slightly affecting the diagnostic specificity (i.e., 0.84 vs.
0.75), thus confirming previous evidence published by on this matter (19).
The considerably lower value of the diagnostic cut-offs of both Roche Elecsys AntiSARS-CoV-2 total antibodies and Beckman Coulter Access anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, as
recalculated from the locally generated ROC curves, deserves a distinct scrutiny. The
manufacturer-suggested diagnostic thresholds are typically derived for optimizing the
diagnostic performance of the assay during acute SARS-CoV-2 infections, when antibody
titers are the highest (29). However, since the circulating levels of all anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig
classes tend to gradually decline over time, this arbitrary cut-offs would become
predictably too high to retain the same diagnostic performance over a long period of time
after symproms relief. It is hence conceivable that multiple diagnostic thresholds would
need to be identified for all anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays, according to the time passed
from symptoms onset. This conclusion is reinforced by the evidence garnered in our study,
since the diagnostic sensitivity of Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and Beckman Coulter
Access anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in samples collected up to 4 months after achieving a
molecular diagnosis of SASR-CoV-2 infection improved from 0.98 and 0.79 up to 1.00 for

both immunoassays when the cut-offs values were lowered by 83% and 64%, respectively.
Failing to do so would be associated with a progressive decrease of the diagnostic
sensitivity (i.e., higher rate of false negative values), which may then lead to the
underdiagnosis of a substantial number of patients who were instead really infected by the
virus.

Conclusions
Although several progresses have been made in our current understanding of
COVID-19, there is still more to learn on biochemistry, biology and clinics of SARS-CoV2 infection (30). Laboratory diagnostics is not an exception to this rule, whereby the ideal
usage of SARS-CoV-2 serology remains a challenging enterprise. The results of our
analytical evaluation of Beckman Coulter Access anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay
supports the conclusion that this fully-automated CLIA represents a valuable resource for
large and accurate seroprevalence surveys. Further studies would then be needed to clarify
many undefined issues in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing.
