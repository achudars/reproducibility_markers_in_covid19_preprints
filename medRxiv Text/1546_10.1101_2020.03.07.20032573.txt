Abstract
OBJECTIVE
Clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been described
in numerous studies but yielded varying results. We aimed to conduct a systematic
review on scientific literatures and to synthesize critical data on clinical traits of
COVID-19 from its initial outbreak to pandemic.
METHODS
Systematic searches were conducted to identify retrospective observational study that
contained clinical characteristics on COVID-19 through multiple databases. Two
reviewers

independently

evaluated

eligible

publications.

Data

on

clinical

characteristics of COVID-19 were extracted and analyzed.
RESULTS
Seventy-two retrospective studies demonstrating the clinical characteristics of
COVID-19 were included. A total of 3470 COVID-19 patients were synthesized to the
final analysis in an unbiased manner. The most common symptom was fever (2878
[83.0%]), and 63.4% of the patients presented fever as onset symptom. There were
2528 [88.2%] of 2866 cases had abnormal lung findings on chest CT scan. Laboratory
findings showed that 1498 [62.8%] of 2387 cases had lymphopenia, and 1354 [64.8%]
of 2091 cases had an increased level of C-reactive protein (CRP). A total of 185
[11.5%] patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) while the overall case
fatality rate (CFR) was 3.7%. Compared to patients admitted outside of Hubei, China,
those from Hubei had a significant higher ICU admission rate (21.9% vs. 2.5%,
p<0.001). Also, CFR attributed to COVID-19 was significantly higher in Hubei than
that of non-Hubei admissions (10.4% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001).
INTERPRETATION
This large patient-based systematic review presents a more precise profiling of the
COVID-19 from its outbreak to current pandemic. Dynamic evolvements of
COVID-19 are needed to be characterized in future studies.

Introduction
In December 2019, a clustering pneumonia of unknown etiology occurred in Wuhan,
Hubei Province, China1. The emerging disease has spread rapidly from Wuhan to
other parts of China and to other countries2. Through a deep sequencing analysis, the
virus responsible for this epidemic pneumonia has been designated as SARS-CoV-2
by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)3. The emerging disease
caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by WHO.
By March 5, 2020, a total of 80,565 cases in China have been confirmed. Outside
China, 14,768 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed spanning in 85 countries, and
the numbers are still on the rise4. What’s worse is that a total of 1,716 healthcare
workers in China have been infected, among which 5 have died by February 11, 20205.
Thus, this infectious disease has become a serious global health concern.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, a large number of articles have been published
reporting epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of this emerging disease. Huang et
al. first reported 41 cases of COVID-19 in which 66% patients had a history of
exposure to Huanan Seafood Market, Wuhan. Common symptoms of the case series
were fever (98%), cough (76%), and myalgia or fatigue (44%) with a case fatality rate
(CFR) of 15%6. Chen et al. in a subsequent study found that 99 cases of COVID-19
patients admitted to the same hospital (Jin Yin-tan Hospital, Wuhan) had similar
trends of symptoms and CFR (11%)7. Another case series analysis of 138 COVID-19
patients in Wuhan showed a relatively higher rate of fatigue symptom (69.6%) but
lower CFR (4.3%) when compared to the above center8. Lastly, Xu et al.9 found in a
multicenter-based retrospective study that clinical symptoms of patients in Zhejiang
province are milder than those observed in Wuhan, China. Similarly, a nationwide
multicenter study in China showed that patients with COVID-19 did not have a
specific clinical symptom10. The clinical traits of COVID-19 are of great importance
for the early identification of cases and for developing isolation and preventive
strategies. However, there exist inconsistent findings of the clinical characteristics of

COVID-19 among different studies, partly due to anthropogenic differences in
patients enrolled and differences in sample size across different studies. Notably,
variation in reporting descriptive data may lead to the misunderstanding of COVID-9
characteristics. In this updated systematic review, hence, we sought to address the
heterogeneities among published retrospective studies and to synthesize the available
data. We expect this critical review will provide insights to understand the clinical
characteristics of COVID-19 in a more systematic manner.

Methods
Identification of Documents on COVID-9
Systematic searches were performed via the Medline database (PubMed) and Embase
combining the terms (novel coronavirus OR 2019 novel coronavirus OR 2019-nCoV
OR Coronavirus disease 2019 OR COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2). We also searched
the database of Chinese Medical Journal full-text database (http://journal.yiigle.com/)
for publications in Chinese using the above strategies. Searches were limited to
publications from January 1, 2020 to March 1, 2020.

Publication Selection
Two of the authors (Z. F. and F. Y.) independently screened searching results to
determine inclusion or exclusion of the articles. Disagreements were modulated by
consulting another author as adjudicator (Z. L.). We included retrospective
observational studies as long as they contain clinical characteristics of COVID-19
associated illness. If the patients came from the same hospital with overlapping cases,
we only selected the publication containing greatest number of cases. The following
publication were excluded: reviews articles, meta-analysis, perspectives, comments,
consensus documents, and publications that were in the neither English nor Chinese.
Also, publications with highly suspected but not laboratory confirmed cases were
excluded.

Literature Quality Evaluation, Data Collection and Statistical Analysis

All included literatures were evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS)11.
The quality score of the literature ranged from lowest 0 to highest 9. Total quality
score of 0-3, 4-6, and 7-9 indicated poor, fair, and good studies, respectively.
Information on baseline demographic data, medical and exposure history, symptoms
and signs, underlying comorbidities, laboratory findings, chest computed tomographic
(CT) scans and CFR were recorded. Based on the diagnostic gold standard for
COVID-19 (positive RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2), we synthesized data on
demographic and clinical parameters in an unbiased manner. The proportion of each
parameter was calculated by the following formula: (actual patient counts)/ (total
patients confirmed using the gold standard) × 100%. The χ2 test was used to compare
the proportions. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 18 (IBM
SPSS Statistics, IBM Corporation).

Results
General Information on the Systemic Review
A total of 1052 publications were retrieved using the search strategy. Seventy-two
retrospective studies (including 22 case report, 20 case series, 3 case-control and 27
cross-sectional studies) that met the inclusion criteria were included in the final
analysis (Figure 1). Of the selected publications, 51 were written in English while 21
were written in Chinese. The general information on eligible publications can be
found in Table 1. Ten publications reported COVID-19 cases from outside of China in
USA12, Germany13, South Korea14, Vietnam15 16, Nepal17, Thailand18, Singapore19,
Canada20 and Italy21. The remaining cases were from China covering 31 provinces or
provincial-level municipalities. Additionally, nine reports specifically targeted
children and the remaining focused mainly on adult patients (including 2 on pregnant
women). Admission time for COVID-19 patients was from December 11, 2019 to
February 14, 2020. Quality assessment of the literatures showed that cross-sectional
studies achieved a good quality (median score, 7.0) while case report/series were fair
(median score, 6.0).

A total of 3,470 COVID-19 patients were included, of which 3,468 confirmed cases
were based on the positive SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR assay while two cases25 were
diagnosed according to coronavirus antibody detections. The age of the COVID-19
patients ranged from 17 days to 92 years old. Male gender accounted for 1822 (52.6%)
of the selected patients. Among 1,573 patients who were asked for smoking status,
208 (13.2%) were self-reported smokers. Through a synthesized analysis, a total of
2182 cases (76.0%) had a history of transmission exposures, i.e., the patients were
either Wuhan residents or travelled to Wuhan within the past 14 days.
Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19
The most common symptom of COVID-19 was fever (2878 [83.0%]), followed by
cough (2102 [61.0%]), fatigue (942 [37.9%]), sputum production (720 [28.7%]),
dyspnea (412 [14.5%]), muscle aches (477 [18.6%]). Less common symptoms were
headache (318 [11.8]), sore throat (289 [14.0%]), gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia,
nausea or vomiting account for 185 [8.9%]) and upper airway symptoms (rhinorrhea,
sneeze or nasal congestion account for 162 [7.6%]) and diarrhea (165 [6.1%]) (Figure
2). Further analysis showed that only 1522 [63.4%] of the patients had fever as their
onset symptom.
Of the selected patients, 888 [31.5%] cases co-existed with underlying chronic
disorders, such as hypertension [13.3%], diabetes [7.3%], chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) [1.4%], cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases
[8.3%], malignancy [1.5%], chronic liver disease [2.1%] and chronic kidney disease
[0.7%] (See Table 3 for details). Common complications of COVID-19 included acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (136 [8.9%]), shock (29 [2.2%]) and acute
renal failure (30 [2.1%]).
Radiological findings revealed that 2528 [88.2%] of 2866 cases had abnormal
presentations on chest CT (Figure 3A), with either bilateral or unilateral
ground-glass/consolidative pulmonary opacities. Laboratory blood tests showed that
1498 [62.8%] of 2387 cases had lymphopenia (lymphocyte count < 1.0 × 109/L),
while 1354 [64.8%] of 2091 cases presented an increased level of C-reactive protein
(CRP) (Figure 3 B-C).

Other Outcomes
Collectively, a total of 185 [11.5%] patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU)
while the overall CFR was 3.7% (Table 2). Our further analysis showed that
COVID-19 patients admitted in Hubei province (Wuhan in particular) suffered from a
significant higher ICU admission rate than that outside of Hubei, China (21.9% vs.
2.5%, p<0.001). Also, CFR attributed to COVID-19 in Hubei province, China was
significantly higher than that in non-Hubei, China (10.4% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001).
Discussion
This review analyzed clinical data on COVID-19 patients enrolled retrospectively in
published studies. These patients were admitted to hospitals between December 11,
2019 and February 14, 2020, which covered a period from COVID-19 outbreak to its
global pandemic. To our knowledge, this updated systematic review analyzed the
largest number of cases demonstrating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19,
which covers ten countries. As of March 5, 2020, there have been 95,333 confirmed
cases distributing over 86 countries4. The rapid and wide spreading of the infection
has clearly shown the pandemic potential of COVID-19, to which we should pay great
attention.

Through literature searching and data extraction, we included 3,470 confirmed cases
of COVID-19 based on the positive assays of SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR or antibody
detection. The present study showed that the infected patients aged from 17-day to
92-year old. A recent report by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(China CDC) have shown that 86.6% the patients aged 30-79 years5. This study
together with China CDC report indicated that the general population, regardless of
age, is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The general ratio of male to female
gender of the present study (1.10:1) is also similar to China CDC report (1.06:1),
indicating that COVID-19 may not have a gender predisposition. Although 13.2% of
the selected patients had a history of smoking, we could not draw the conclusion that
smokers are less susceptible to the viral infection than non-smokers, as the patients

included in our analysis were from a sample pool that was not representative the
general population by smoking status.

This systematic review showed that most of the patients (76.0%) had a history of
Wuhan-related exposures. This is of great importance for early quarantine for the
subjects with emerging infectious disease when specific treatments are not available.
Actually, we have learned from the SARS outbreak 17 years ago that early
identification, early isolation and early management would lead to the stop of viral
transmissions from human to human79. Collectively, there were 36% of the
COVID-19 patients absent from fever as the onset symptom. In this case, such
patients may have been ignored at the early stage if we focused heavily on fever
examination for initial screening. Our composite analysis showed that fever remains
the most common symptom (83.0%) in patients with COVID-19. However, the
proportion of fever is somewhat lower than that of other coronavirus related
respiratory illness, such as SARS (100%)80 81 or middle east respiratory syndrome
(MERS) (98%)82. Similarly, the accompanied symptoms of dyspnea (14.5%) and
diarrhea (6.1%) are relatively less common in patients with COVID-19 than those
seen in SARS and MERS87. More importantly, this study revealed an overall CFR of
3.7%, which was quite similar to that reported by the WHO official statistics as of
March 5, 2020 (CFR 3.7%, 3,015 died of 80,565 cases)4. Nevertheless, the CFR of
COVID-19 was much lower than that of SARS (9.6%)83 and MERS (37.1%)84. By far,
the mechanisms underlying the varying symptoms and CFR for these three
coronavirus-infected diseases are not fully understood. One reason may be that there
were still some COVID-19 patients being treated in hospitals at the time of the
manuscripts submitted, so the outcome (death or recovery) is not known yet.
Additionally, we suppose that the varied tropism as well as virulence of these three
coronaviruses may in part account for the discrepancies, which warrants further
investigations.

According to the seven version Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel

Coronavirus Infection85, typical CT findings of early COVID-19 are characterized by
multiple small patchy shadows and then developed into bilateral pulmonary
ground-glass or consolidative opacities. In our summary, most of the patients (88.2%)
had abnormal findings in the lungs with chest CT scan. In some early cases of
COVID-19, clear evidence of pneumonia has been shown on HRCT while X-ray
radiographic findings are still normal51. Thus, chest CT scan should be routinely
recommended for the early identification of COVID-19. Routine blood tests showed
that 62.8% of COVID-19 patients had lymphopenia, of which the level is relatively
lower than that of SARS86. Similarly, a large proportion (64.8%) of COVID-19
patients had an increase level of CRP. Taken together, a combination of the
epidemiologic history with auxiliary examinations, e.g., chest CT scan and blood tests,
will improve the diagnostic accuracy for COVID-19.
Our further analysis revealed that patients admitted in Hubei province (Wuhan in
particular) are facing much more severe situations (higher ICU admission rate and
CFR) than those diagnosed in other parts of China. Reasons for the tough situations
being caught in Hubei province might be as follows. Firstly, the human-to-human
transmission of COVID-19 had not been cutting down at its early stage in Wuhan,
Hubei province. Second, when encountering such a large number of infected patients,
a limited healthcare workforce in Wuhan could not support to treat all patients at their
mild or moderate stage. This might result in a higher rate of ICU admission or CFR.
Since substantial number of patients as well as healthy residents have been kept in
lockdown of Wuhan, great efforts are urgently needed to cutdown the virus
transmission from COVID-19 patients to local healthy residents.
This systematic review has some limitations. First, due to the retrospective nature of
selected literatures, not all clinical characteristics have been well documented. This
have resulted in an inconsistence of the total numbers of each item being calculated.
Second, some of the selected patients may not have discharged before the studies
were finalized. This might have affected the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 to some

extents. Third, since the disease is still ongoing, newly published data on COVID-19
might not be included at the time of manuscript submission. Nevertheless, we have
summarized the largest number of patients demonstrating the clinical characteristics
of COVID-19 in the present study. Finally, we could not determine the incubation
periods of COVID-19 due to heterogeneity across studies in reporting the timeline of
cases.

In summary, COVID-19 represents an emerging acute respiratory infection with
various clinical presentations that share similarities as well as discrepancies with
SARS and MERS. Combining clinical presentations with radiographic findings as
well as blood tests may add value in early diagnosis and managements. Dynamic
changes of clinical features in the course of COVID-19 are needed to be characterized
in future studies. Since specific treatments are not available at the moment, urgent
efforts should be taken to explore for this emerging disease.
