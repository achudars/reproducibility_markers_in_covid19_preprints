Abstract

40

In several hospitals worldwide, healthcare workers are currently at the forefront against coronavirus

41

disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli (FPG) IRCCS has

42

been enlisted as a COVID hospital, healthcare workers deployed to COVID wards were separated from

43

those with limited or no exposure, whereas administrative staff was destined to work-from-home.

44

Between June 4 and July 3 2020, an investigation was carried out to evaluate seroprevalence of SARS-

45

CoV-2 IgG antibodies among employees of the FPG using point-of-care (POC) and venous blood tests.

46

Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were determined with reverse-transcription polymerase

47

chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasal/oropharyngeal swabs as gold standard.

48

Four thousand, seven hundred seventy-seven participants were enrolled. Seroprevalence was 3.66%

49

using the POC test and 1.19% using venous blood test, with a significant difference between the two (p

50

< 0.05).

51

POC sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 63.64% (95% confidence interval (CI): 62.20% to

52

65.04%) and 96.64% (95% CI: 96.05% to 97.13%), while those of the venous blood test were,

53

respectively, 78.79% (95% CI: 77.58% to 79.94%) and 99.36% (95% CI: 99.07% to 99.55%).

54

Among low-risk population, point-of-care’s predictive values were 58.33% (positive) and 98.23%

55

(negative) whereas venous blood test’s were 92.86% (positive) and 98.53% (negative). In conclusion,

56

point-of-care tests have low diagnostic accuracy, while venous blood tests seem to show an overall poor

57

reliability.

60

On December 2019, a cluster of a unknown acute respiratory illness occurred in Wuhan city, Hubei

61

Province in China, and rapidly spread to other areas in the following months [1,2]. The responsible

62

agent was identified by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) on January 7

63

2020 and was subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

64

The disease was later named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) [3]. Due to the

65

widespread global transmission of COVID-19 and the high rate of contagiousness, the WHO declared

66

COVID-19 to be a pandemic on March 11 2020 [3]. Early in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, several

67

healthcare workers (HCWs) have been infected while providing care to patients with COVID-19

68

[4,5,6]. Identification and isolation of infected and potentially infectious HCWs is indeed relevant to

69

protect them and their families and, besides, may prevent onward transmission to patients and

70

colleagues as well as reduce the risk of healthcare-associated outbreaks [5]. In Italy, COVID-19 cases

71

increased rapidly since February 23 2020 with SARS-CoV-2 spreading mostly in northern regions,

72

particularly in the Lombardy region, where on June 4 2020 the number of COVID-19 cases were

73

89,526 (38.26% of total cases in Italy). Although in the Lazio region, at the same date, COVID-19

74

cases were 7764, the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli (FPG) IRCCS—a large teaching

75

University hospital in Rome enlisted as a COVID hospital—treated 553 COVID-19 patients, 133 of

76

them in the intensive care unit (ICU). Based on these evidences and in accordance with the Lazio

77

region, [7] the FPG launched a seroprevalence investigation to assess potential contagion sources

78

among FPG HCWs. Previous studies already discussed data on HCWs seroprevalence over different

79

countries worldwide, indicating that isolation protocols, hygiene standards and personal protective

80

equipment (PPE) may prevent high levels of nosocomial transmission [8-17].

81

Current diagnostic tests for COVID-19 fall into two main categories: molecular tests detecting SARS-

82

CoV-2 RNA and serological tests detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins (Igs; i.e. IgG/IgM)

83

[18]. The reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) molecular test, usually performed

84

on nasal/oropharyngeal swab (NOS) samples, is considered the reference standard for COVID-19

85

diagnosis [19]. However, this test has long turnaround times (it takes over 2 to 3 hours to generate

86

results) and requires certified laboratories, expensive equipment and trained technicians to operate.

87

Limitations include potential false negative results and precarious availability of test materials [18,19].

88

Conversely, serological tests have been proposed as an alternative to RT-PCR in cases of acute SARS-

89

CoV-2 infection [20]. They are, in addition, cheaper and easier to implement in laboratory diagnostics

90

for SARS-CoV-2, especially in a point-of-care (POC) format. A clear advantage of these tests over RT-

91

PCR is that they can identify individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, even if they never

92

underwent testing while acutely ill [18]. Considering their short time of appearance from the SARS-

93

CoV-2 infection onset, viral specific IgG and IgM antibodies could indicate an ongoing infection [19].

94

In this regard, population-based sero-epidemiological surveys, especially in healthcare settings,

95

quantifying the proportion of individuals with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, may be very helpful [21].

96

The aim of this study was to assess seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies among

97

HCWs of the FPG, using serological tests, which rely on venous or capillary blood sampling. The

98

sensitivity and specificity of both tests, namely venous blood and POC test, respectively, were

99

evaluated in comparison with RT-PCR results on NOS samples from FPG HCWs.

100
101

Materials and methods

102

Study participants and design

103

This cross-sectional study consisted in a seroprevalence survey between June 4 2020 and July 3 2020,

104

which enrolled via a hospital e-mail system, on a voluntary basis, medical, non-medical HCWs and

105

administrative staff (AS) of the FPG (Table 1). The study was approved by the FPG Ethics Committee

106

(number ID 3253) and participants signed an informed consent before their inclusion in the study. Both

107

venous blood and POC SARS-CoV-2 serological tests were offered to each participant and performed

108

in dedicated blood-drawing areas in compliance with COVID-19 safety regulations. In case of

109

positivity to at least one test, participants underwent NOS sampling for RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 RNA

110

detection to assess the actual infection status [7]. Unlike venous blood testing, POC testing was

111

performed by trained clinical staff composed by public health residents and student nurses.

112

Medical and non-medical HCWs were categorized into two groups whether they had assisted or had

113

not assisted COVID-19 patients, in the period between March 9 2020 (date of the first COVID-19

114

patients in our hospital) and June 4 2020 (date of seroprevalence survey initiation). For predictivity

115

analysis, which requires to consider the prevalence of the studied population, we used AS as further

116

comparison group, because this was a group with low seroprevalence. This is due to the fact that these

117

participants were less exposed to COVID-19 infection than HCWs and many of them had been in

118

work-from-home for two days a week from March 9 2020.

119

As above mentioned, participants, which tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, with at

120

least one of the serological tests used in the study (see below), were sampled for NOS testing [22]

121

within 48 hours after positive serological test results were available. RT-PCR testing on NOS samples

122

was performed using the Seegene Allplex™ 2019-nCoV assay, and a positive result (i.e., a Ct less than

123

40) for at least one of two viral targets (i.e., RdRP and N genes) indicated the presence of SARS-CoV-

124

2 RNA.

127

Detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood samples

128

Two serological tests were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in participants’ blood

129

samples. In venous blood tests, venous blood samples were subjected to an enzyme-linked

130

immunosorbent assay (ELISA) marketed by Euroimmun (Lübeck, Germany; www.euroimmun.com)

131

for SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection [23]. In POC tests, capillary blood samples were directly subjected to

132

the AllTestTM 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette assay lateral-flow chromatographic

133

immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM detection [19,24].

134

Detection of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers

135

The collection of respiratory tract specimen, through NOS, to confirm COVID-19 status, was routinely

136

performed at least once on 5270 HCWs, who met the following criteria: symptomatic participants;

137

contact without adequate PPE with a COVID-19 case; HCWs employed in a ward with COVID-19

138

patients (swab performed monthly); HCWs employed in a ward with COVID-19 patients (swab

139

performed bi-monthly); and HCWs not employed in a COVID-19 ward (swab performed quarterly)

140

[19].

141
142

Sensitivity and specificity of serological tests

143

The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA-based venous blood and POC tests were assessed using

144

RT-PCR assay as the diagnostic gold standard. In particular, we included only RT-PCR results from

145

NOS samples obtained from the participants at least 30 days before. This allowed to define the

146

seroconversion time for each participant with a positive serological result. As comparison group

147

for predictive value analysis, we considered all participants enrolled in the study with at least one

148

negative RT-PCR molecular test and only AS with at least one negative RT-PCR molecular test,

149

because HCWs are a group more exposed to COVID-19 infection risk than the general population.

150

Besides, AS seems to have a lower risk of positivity to SARS-CoV-2, similarly to general population,

151

than most exposed groups, such as HCWs or quarantined persons who had been exposed to SARS-

152

CoV-2 [25].

153

Statistical analysis

154

Descriptive analysis was performed for sex, age, professional category and wards of the HCWs.

155

Difference between proportions was evaluated with the two proportions z test. Seroprevalence was

156

calculated, separately, for test on venous sampling and POC test. Seroprevalence for test on venous

157

sampling was estimated as the proportion of individuals who had a positive result in the IgG in the

158

immunoassay. Furthermore, for tests on capillary blood, both seroprevalence for IgM and IgG was

159

estimated, as the proportion of individuals who had positive result in the corresponding band of the

160

POC test.

161

Besides, we also re-estimated the sensitivity and specificity of the POC test using the immunoassay as

162

a reference. The accuracy of the capillary versus the venous test was evaluated with sensitivity,

163

specificity and predictive values with 95% confidence intervals (CI) [18]. All the seroprevalence was

164

stratified for professional category, age and wards in which they worked during the COVID-19

165

emergency.

166

The difference between positivity to one of the serological tests and positivity to the RT-PCR on NOS

167

samples was estimated through Pearson’s chi-squared test. The Spearman Rank test (Bonferroni

168

adjusted) was used to evaluate the correlation between the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay in capillary

169

blood versus the same titre in venous blood. Furthermore, Cronbach’s alpha was evaluated. In general,

170

significant reliability values for Cronbach's alpha are to be considered those > 0.70.

171

Statistical analyses were carried out using a software for the construction of the general basic dataset

172

(Microsoft Excel for Mac Version 16.35), and specific for the inferential statistical analysis (Stata Corp

173

4905 Lakeway, College Station, USA Stata / IC 14.2 for Mac (64-bit Intel), Revision 29 Jan 2018).

174

Results

175

Of the 7889 eligible participants, 4888 (62%) responded to the invitation and 111 of them refused to

176

participate. Therefore, 4777 participants were enrolled in the seroprevalence investigation. Of the

177

enrolled participants, 295 participants expressed consent to the venous blood test only, 83 expressed

178

consent to the POC test only, and 4399 expressed consent for both. Table 1 reports the general

179

characteristics of the participants. Their mean age was 43.11 years (SD ± 11.51), age data was missing

180

for 122 participants. Females accounted for 65.35% (3122/4777) of the total; 31% (1481/4777) of the

181

participants were nurses and 17.35% (829/4777) medical doctors. Around 15% (736/4777) of the

182

participants was employed in COVID-19 wards.

183

The rate of positivity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected on NOS samples was 0.85% (45/5270).

184

Conversely, POC seroprevalence was 3.66% (164/4482) and venous blood test seroprevalence was

185

1.19% (56/4694). Stratified results are shown in Table 2. Participants tested at least once for SARS-

186

CoV-2 RT-PCR detection in NOS samples were 3538. Of these, 3184 had a RT-PCR result at least 30

187

days before serological testing and these results were considered in the accuracy analysis of serological

188

tests.

189

Considering all participants enrolled, the POC test showed a sensitivity of 63.64% (95% CI, 62.20% to

190

65.04%) and a specificity of 96.64% (95% CI, 96.05% to 97.13%), whereas the venous blood test

191

showed a sensitivity of 78.79% (95% CI, 77.58% to 79.94%) and a specificity of 99.36% (95% CI,

192

99.07% to 99.55%). Conversely, considering only as a comparison group, the POC test showed a

193

sensitivity of 63.64% (95% CI, 59.10% to 67.93%) and a specificity of 97.79% (95% CI, 95.90% to

194

98.85%), whereas the venous blood test showed a sensitivity of 78.79% (95% CI, 74.89% to 82.22%)

195

and a specificity of 99.57% (95% CI, 98.36% to 99.92%). Positive (PPV) and negative predictive

196

values (NPV) for the POC and venous blood test and stratification of PPV, NPV, sensitivity and

197

specificity with both AS and total participants as comparison group are shown in Table 3.

198

Pearson’s chi-squared test showed a significant difference between the POC and venous blood test

199

results (p < 0.05).

200

Out of 4683 observations, Spearman’s rho was 0.1052 with a p-value < 0.00.

201

Cronbach’s alpha showed a low concordance (scale reliability coefficient: 0.4477 p < 0.05).

202

Of the 7889 eligible participants, 45 HCWs were COVID-19 known cases before the beginning of

203

seroprevalence survey. Of these cases, 33 were enrolled in the survey and 26 of 33 resulted positive for

204

SARS-CoV-2 IgG with the venous blood test. None of the participants resulting positive with the

205

venous blood or POC test, consequently tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, had detectable

206

SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their NOS samples.

Discussion

219

Our results show that the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and serological positivity in different work

220

categories are consistent with the low spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the FPG, which differs from the

221

national surveillance data reporting a seroprevalence of 2.5% [26]. Furthermore, the seroprevalence for

222

HCWs ranged between 1.6% and 14.6% in several studies [8-17].

223

Besides, we found a slight difference (but not statistically significant) in the seroprevalence determined

224

by venous blood test between HCWs, who assistance or not assisted in COVID-19 wards: this is in

225

accordance with another study reporting a higher seroprevalence rate than the one reported in our study

226

[27]. The highest seropositivity rates (with venous blood test) among different worker categories were

227

observed for medical doctors. Although this finding is not of immediate interpretation, a possible

228

reason could be their exposure to high risk procedures (i.e., oral intubation, reanimation, clinical

229

examination). Overall, we observed low differences (but not statistically significant) in seropositivity

230

rates between sex and age categories.

231

Our study shows that the specificity was high for venous blood but not for POC test. Conversely, using

232

RT-PCR assay as the diagnostic gold standard, venous blood test sensitivity might meet the criteria for

233

screening tests, unlike POC test sensitivity. NPV were acceptable for both tests, whereas the PPV was

234

acceptable only for the venous blood test, as shown in Table 3. A systematic review and meta-analysis

235

by Bastos et al. [18] revealed that the current evidence does not support continued use of existing POC

236

tests for COVID-19 serology. On one hand, our study shows a high PPV for venous blood serological

237

testing among a low-risk population (i.e., AS) of hospital staff, on the other hand, this finding may not

238

be the case for a medium/high-risk population (i.e., the entire working community of a COVID

239

hospital).

240

We also observed that, among the subset of participants who tested positive with the venous blood or

241

POC test and who were consequently tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, none of these

242

participants had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their NOS samples, thus confirming that the

243

serological test is not useful to diagnose COVID-19. Of 33 COVID-19 known cases tested for SARS-

244

CoV-2 IgG in the venous blood, only 26 (78.8%) resulted positive, thus highlighting disagreement with

245

recent observations [25] and confirming uncertainties about infections that occurred more than five

246

weeks before the tests [20]. Our evidence suggests a decrease of the antibody titre, which in turn could

247

corroborate the hypothesis of a non-persistent immunity and ultimately justify a possible re-infection

248

with SARS-CoV-2 [28]. Furthermore, our sample, while small in size, is composed mainly of mild or

249

asymptomatic cases (only 2 of 33 cases were admitted to ICU). As proposed by Burgess et al., [29]

250

severity of illness is linked to the magnitude of serological responses. This association is also suggested

251

by the experience gathered from other coronaviruses [30].

252

Our large teaching hospital gave us the opportunity to enroll a conspicuous sample size. Furthermore,

253

even if some of the published studies involved larger numbers, our study is the first stratifying the

254

sample by risk. From the beginning of the pandemic in Italy, the hospital directorate decided to

255

distinguish HCWs who work in dedicated COVID-19 wards from those with limited or no exposure

256

(i.e., working in non-COVID wards), and allowed work-from-home for AS. We assume that the last

257

group has the same risk of the general population as AS was employed in work-from-home, during the

258

Italian lockdown period.

259

Our study had several limitations. The sample was not drawn randomly and the estimation of the

260

seroprevalence was also subject to other potential sampling bias, due to the voluntarily enrolling

261

procedure. Moreover, the sensitivity of the serological test could be biased because it depends on the

262

test time from the onset of disease. Samples collected from infected individuals outside the time

263

window of antibody response could produce false negatives and, therefore, the observed

264

seroprevalence in our study could potentially underestimate the true prevalence of the disease.

265

Another limitation of the study could consist in the COVID-19 case detection strategy. In fact, to

266

ascertain the exact number of COVID-19 cases among HCWs, a systematic and periodic (ideally every

267

14 days) screening with RT-PCR from NOS samples should be performed. However, this was not

268

sustainable during the emergency due to lack of resources.

269

Owing to the cross-sectional design of this study, the dynamic changes of antibody titre in infected

270

individuals over time were not evaluated.

271

Further studies, especially with long-term follow-up, will be needed in the future to assess the value of

272

serological tests, considering their major public health implications.
