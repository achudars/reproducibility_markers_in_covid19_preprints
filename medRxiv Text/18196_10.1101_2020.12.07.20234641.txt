Research in context

17

Evidence before this study

18

A systematic literature search on Pubmed from database inception to October 2020 was conducted.

19

The broad terms included were “COVID-19” OR “SARS-COV-2” OR “coronavirus” AND “prison” OR

20

“correctional facility” OR “place of detention” OR “penitentiary” OR “detention centre”. There were

21

no language restrictions. We reviewed reference lists and forward citations of all articles pertinent

22

to the study objectives. We identified 122 results. Only two prison outbreak reports were identified,

23

both focusing on prisons in the USA. Outbreak guidance identified during the literature review was

24

typically adapted from other institutional settings such as care homes and hospital, with a focus on

25

self-isolation, social distancing, reduced admissions and rapid testing. Many of these features form

26

the basis of CDC, WHO and ECDC prison outbreak guidance. However, these measures have not

27

proven effective in many countries, resulting in major and sustained COVID-19 outbreaks in regions

28

such as the USA and South America. Therefore, alternative and cost-effective approaches need to be

29

considered to reduce the transmission of SARS-COV-2.

30

Added value of this study

31

This study outlines novel outbreak control measures (not reported elsewhere in the literature), that

32

were clearly efficacious in preventing the rapid transmission of SARS-COV-2 in a large UK prison.

33

These include: (1) the timely establishment of “Reverse Cohorting Units” to accommodate new

34

prison admissions, allowing emergent infectious cases to be detected before entering the general

35

population; (2) “Protective Isolation Units” for accommodating confirmed / suspected cases and (3)

36

“Shielding Units” to protect prisoners most at risk from COVID-19.

37

Implications of all the available evidence

The innovative and cost-effective interventions presented here proved effective in controlling the

39

spread of SARS-COV-2, even in the absence of mass testing. The best defence against incursions of

ABSTRACT

44

Background: SARS-CoV-2 can spread rapidly within correctional facilities. On redacted, following

45

identification of a confirmed COVID-19 case in a prisoner in Prison A (UK), an Outbreak Control Team

46

was convened consisting of prison staff and public health experts from Public Health England and

47

the UK National Health Service.

48

Methods: At the start of the outbreak, four prisoners and 40 staff were isolating with COVID-19

49

symptoms. An outbreak was declared and full prison lockdown implemented.

50

Prompt implementation of novel outbreak control measures prevented an explosive prison

51

outbreak, specifically establishment of dedicated isolation and cohorting units, including (i) Reverse

52

Cohorting Units (RCUs) for accommodating new detainees; (ii) Protective Isolation Units (PIUs) for

53

isolating symptomatic prisoners (new detainees and existing residents), and (iii) Shielding Units (SUs)

54

to protect medically vulnerable prisoners.

55

Findings: In total, 120 probable and 25 confirmed cases among prisoners and staff were recorded

56

between redacted. Among prisoners, there were six possible, 79 probable, and three confirmed

57

cases. Among staff, there were 83 possible, 79 probable, and 22 confirmed cases. Testing of

58

symptomatic prisoners was limited for most of the outbreak, with only 33% of probable cases

59

tested. This explains the low number of confirmed cases (three) among prisoners despite the large

60

number of probable cases (n=81; 92%). Over 50% of the initial cases among prisoners were on the

61

two wings associated with the index case.

62

Interpretation: Rapid transmission of SARS-COV-2 was prevented through proactive steps in

63

identifying and isolating infected prisoners (and staff), cohorting new admissions and shielding

64

vulnerable individuals. These novel and cost-effective approaches can be implemented in a wide

65

range of correctional facilities globally and proved effective even in the absence of mass testing.

INTRODUCTION

68

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 35 million

69

people globally, with over 1 million deaths.1 The focus of interest has been the impact of COVID-19

70

on healthcare and community settings,2,3 however, the propensity for explosive COVID-19 outbreaks

71

is of particular concern within prisons and places of detention,4 particularly as a second wave of

72

COVID-19 affects many countries.

73

There have been 42,107 confirmed cases and 510 deaths amongst prisoners in the USA and 540

74

confirmed cases and 44 deaths among prisoners/probation service users in the UK.5,6 Prison

75

populations are at substantial risk of COVID-19 due to staffing,7 environmental and host

76

characteristics.4,8 Outbreak guidance for prisons from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

77

(CDC)9 and World Health Organization (WHO)13 emphasises the importance of hand-hygiene, social-

78

distancing/isolation, reduced admissions and rapid testing. However, these measures can be difficult

79

to implement10,11 particularly against long-term under-investment in European and US prisons.12

80

Other novel and cost-effective approaches are therefore needed.

81

UK guidance, advised by Public Health England (PHE)14,15 outlines specific actions to manage COVID-

82

19 outbreaks, including the establishment of: (i) Reverse Cohorting Units (RCUs) to accommodate

83

new prison admissions; (ii) Protective Isolation Units (PIUs) for isolating confirmed and suspected

84

cases; and (iii) Shielding Units (SUs) to protect the clinically vulnerable. Here we describe the first

85

prison outbreak in Europe (Prison A) and highlight the vital role of cohorting and isolating in

86

preventing an ‘explosive’ outbreak.

91

DESCRIPTION OF THE OUTBREAK

92

Prison A was notified of a confirmed COVID-19 case in a prisoner (index case) on redacted. The case

93

was tested for SARS-CoV-2 following admission to hospital on redacted. The case did not display

94

COVID-19 symptoms and was discharged on redacted the first Outbreak Control Team meeting was

95

convened (attended by Prison A, PHE public health experts and NHS representatives), four prisoners

96

and 40 staff were isolating with COVID-19 symptoms. An outbreak was declared and prison

97

lockdown implemented (i.e. cessation of all admissions/transfers from courts and other prisons). The

98

outbreak was declared over following on redacted when there had been no confirmed cases among

99

staff or prisoners for over 28 days.

100

Establishment of Cohorting and Isolation Units

101

A SU was established on J-Wing on redacted to safeguard 35 prisoners with chronic medical

102

conditions. Enhanced levels of biosecurity (i.e. measures to prevent introduction of COVID-19)

103

included controlled access via one entrance; full use of PPE by staff; appointment of dedicated

104

prison/healthcare staff and unlocking a maximum of 11 prisoners at one time.

105

Despite evidence of an on-going outbreak, Prison A reopened to new admissions on redacted due to

106

prison population pressures across England. At this time, an RCU was established with the dual

107

purpose of protecting the main prison population from imported infections, as well as protecting

108

new admissions from any outbreak among the existing prison population. A PIU was also established

109

to isolate confirmed/suspected COVID-19 cases and close contacts for the duration of the infectious

110

period (i.e. seven and 14 days, respectively) (Fig. 1).

113

Key features of the outbreak response are the Reverse Cohorting Unit (RCU), Protective Isolation Unit (PIU)

114

and Shielding Unit (SU) From redacted onward, new arrivals underwent healthcare screening for

115

COVID-19 symptoms and were either (i) quarantined in the RCU for 14 days if symptom free, or (ii)

116

held in the PIU for seven days if symptomatic (Fig. 1). Admissions identified as clinically vulnerable to

117

COVID-19 were transferred to the SU once released from the RCU.

118

Shielding and cohorting units were established in non-central locations, away from the main

119

population, with no thoroughfare and a single point of entry. Single cells were preferred, and

120

facilities (showers, phones, exercise yard etc.) separated from those used by the main population.

121

The Units had designated medical treatments rooms and access to a constant interaction cell

122

(location used for prisoners deemed high risk of suicide). The RCU also had a dedicated area to

123

conduct interviews and clinical assessments.

METHODS
Study population

128

Prison A is a Category B (housing prisoners taken directly from courts) men’s prison in the UK, with a

129

high turnover population and capacity for 977 prisoners. It is composed of seven wings, a social care

130

unit, separation unit and healthcare unit. Each wing accommodates 100–175 prisoners in a

131

combination of single and double occupancy cells. It was holding 950 prisoners and employing 910

132

staff at the start of the outbreak.

133

Case definitions

134

Definitions of possible and probable cases were made in the context of a confirmed outbreak and

135

therefore deviate from UK national definitions.14,15) Possible cases were individuals reporting

136

symptoms consistent with an upper respiratory tract infection but without COVID-19 symptoms.

137

Probable cases were individuals reporting one or more COVID-19 symptom, i.e. fever or temperature

138

> 37.8°C, new continuous cough or anosmia. Confirmed cases were individuals with a positive SARS-

139

CoV-2 test result.

140

Laboratory testing

141

In the early part of the outbreak, only a minority of symptomatic prisoners were tested because of

142

logistical difficulties in arranging testing undertaken by external healthcare staff. Once infection had

143

been identified in the first cases, those in the prison with symptoms were assumed probable.

144

By redacted, arrangements were established for on-site swabbing, allowing all symptomatic

145

prisoners to be tested. In total, 309 prisoners had been tested by the end of the outbreak redacted),

146

with 294 negative, 13 rejected and two positive results. Five prisoners refused to be tested. Staff

147

sourced testing in the community via local NHS providers.

148

Prisoners had a throat swab collected by a member of the prison healthcare team using the woven

149

swab from a cobas® PCR Dual or Uni Swab collection kit. These were referred to a local NHS provider

150

and tested using the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 dual target real time PCR assay (Roche Diagnostics,

151

Switzerland). Results were returned electronically to the prison healthcare team.

152

Data analysis

153

An epidemic curve was constructed for staff and prisoners using date of onset of symptoms

154

(symptomatic cases) or date of positive test result (asymptomatic cases). The date of

155

implementation of outbreak control measures are demarcated in the epidemic curve. Demographic

156

and clinical data and SARS-CoV-2 test results were abstracted from prison records by healthcare

157

staff.

158

The attack rate (AR) was calculated for each prison wing using occupancy data from the start of the

159

outbreak. Prisoner location is defined as the wing the prisoner was located on when symptoms first

160

developed or immediately prior to being tested if asymptomatic.

161
162

RESULTS

163

Between redacted, 88 prisoners (n = 950, 35.2%) and 184 staff were identified as possible, probable

164

or confirmed COVID-19 cases (Table 1).

Prisoners

169

Among prisoners, date of onset of symptoms ranged from redacted (Fig. 2). All three confirmed

170

cases and 22 (35%) of the probable cases occurred in the 29-day period before the PIU and RCU

171

were established on redacted. Over the remainder of the outbreak there were no further confirmed

172

cases and 23 probable cases among the resident population – and 15 probable cases imported from

173

the courts. Four prisoners required hospitalisation. All positive cases were isolated in the PIU as per

174

national guidance.15

175

All seven wings reported probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19, with at least one case identified

176

on each wing before the PIU and RCU were established on redacted. The attack rate (AR) among

177

prisoners was greatest on D-wing, at 20.0%, followed P-wing (7.8%) and L-wing (5.7%). The attack

178

rate was lowest on K-wing, at 2.9%. Following the PIU and RCU being implemented on the redacted,

179

the majority of new cases were among new admissions to the prison (15; 23.8%).

189

DISCUSSION

190

This is the first COVID-19 outbreak report in a European prison setting. In the absence of adequate

191

SARS-CoV-2 testing, Prison A was able to control the outbreak through the prompt implementation

192

of novel (RCUs, PIUs and SUs) and standard (social distancing, enhanced cleaning) outbreak control

193

measures. In total, 120 probable and 25 confirmed cases among prisoners and staff were recorded.

194

Here we focus on two main issues that merit further discussion: (i) use of isolation and cohorting

195

units for symptomatic, vulnerable and newly received admissions and (ii) limitations in SARS-CoV-2

196

testing capabilities.

197

The WHO have highlighted the importance of increased testing as an essential part of the response

198

to COVID-19. Testing allows effective isolation of true cases and contacts of cases to be identified

199

and quarantined. However, the effectiveness of isolating symptomatic individuals in a COVID-19

200

outbreak depends on the extent of transmission from pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infection,

201

and the proportion of cases that are asymptomatic. Data suggests that 20-50% of infections may be

202

asymptomatic16,17 and that 40% of transmission occurs before symptoms develop.18,19 The

203

infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals is similar to or less than those with symptoms.20 Wider

204

testing of individuals with no symptoms therefore allows the identification and isolation of

205

asymptomatic cases who can transmit infection, and identification and quarantining of their

206

contacts. While the original source of infection was likely an asymptomatic staff member moving

207

between wings, as the outbreak progressed it can be assumed that staff continued to be infected

208

from both prisoners and the wider community.

209

For technical reasons, testing of prisoners was unavailable for most of the outbreak, so only 33% of

210

probable cases were tested. This in part explains the low incidence of confirmed cases (three) among

211

prisoners despite the large number (81; 92%) with classic symptoms. Additionally, there was a delay

212

in Prison A receiving the positive SARS-CoV-2 test result for the index case – subsequently more than

213

50% of initial cases (redacted) were on the wings (G and K) associated with the index case.

214

The adverse impact on outbreak control of failure to test symptomatic prisoners was mitigated by

215

aggressive identification and isolation of symptomatic prisoners and their contacts. This allowed

216

Prison A to avoid the kind of ‘explosive’ outbreak predicted within prison settings.4,8 Even possible

217

cases, without classic COVID-19 symptoms, and their contacts were isolated. It must be noted all

218

members of the prison population (prisoners, staff and visitors) can facilitate the spread of infection.

219

However, a lack of co-ordination between staff and prisoner testing means that the outbreak control

220

team had limited access to staff testing results undertaken by local NHS providers.

221

Establishment of the RCU and PIU was critical in controlling this outbreak. The RCU allowed Prison A

222

to accommodate new admissions to the prison for a period of 14 days to detect any emergent

223

infectious cases before entering the general population.21 Previous literature have confirmed that

224

new admissions are sources of infectious diseases including HIV, Hepatitis B and TB infection.22 Data

225

presented here demonstrates that new admissions are an important source of COVID-19. The

226

routine quarantining of new admissions is not advocated by the WHO13 or practiced in US prisons,

227

with CDC advising prisons ‘consider’ quarantining ‘if possible’.9 This could in part explain the

228

relatively low AR reported for Prison A (6.4%) and other UK prisons6 in comparison to the AR of 80%

229

reported for the Marion Correctional Institution23 in Ohio and 13% in the Cook County Jail in Illinois,

230

USA.24

231

This investigation has several limitations. Inadequate community and prison testing during the early

232

stages of the outbreak means there is likely an under estimate of confirmed cases among prisoners

233

and staff. As Prison A introduced multiple interventions over a similar timeframe it is difficult to

234

ascertain effectiveness of individual interventions. Due to the nature of the data collected it is not

235

possible to make inferences into behavioural/socio-economic risk factors associated with infection.

236

In conclusion, In the absence of a vaccine or effective treatment, risks of large outbreaks in prison

237

settings will continue for the foreseeable future. These risks may be escalated as wider community

238

restrictions are relaxed, a second wave of COVID-19 affects many countries and new prison

admissions increase as normal criminal justice proceedings resume. The best defence against

240

incursions of future infection into global prisons is implementation of strict outbreak control

241

measures, continued surveillance and testing (specifically the protecting the vulnerable) and,

242

importantly, isolating and cohorting of new prison admissions via approaches such as reverse

243

cohorting unites, protective isolation units and shielding units.
