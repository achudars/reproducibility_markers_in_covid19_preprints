Our manuscript was based on surveillance cases of COVID-19 identified before
January 26, 2020. As of February 20, 2020, the total number of confirmed cases in
mainland China has reached 18 times of the number in our manuscript. While the
methods and the main conclusions in our original analyses remain solid, we decided
to withdraw this preprint for the time being, and will replace it with a more up-to-date
version shortly. Please do not cite this preprint. Should you have any comments or
suggestions, please feel free to contact the corresponding author, Dr. Liqun Fang.
