Abstract
Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) is an emerging, highly contagious community
acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Highly efficient and accurate microbiological
laboratory assay is essential to confirm the SARS-CoV-2 infection, rule out other
pathogens that can cause CAP, and monitor secondary infections. Here, we enrolled
and provide microbiological analysis for 129 suspected and 52 transferred confirmed
NCP patients hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and
Technology of China (USTC) from Jan 21 to Feb 29, 2020. By analyzing the dual

swab samples (sputum and pharyngeal) from 129 suspected patients with realtime
RT-PCR, we confirmed 33 SARS-CoV-2 infections, with two co-infection cases with
adenovirus or rhinovirus. We also used multiplex PCR to detect 13 common
respiratory tract pathogens in 96 non-NCP patients, and found that 30 patients
(31.25%) were infected with at least one respiratory tract pathogen that may cause
CAP. Further, we performed bacterial and fungal cultures as well as fungal serologic
tests and found that there is no secondary bacterial/fungal infections in confirmed
NCP patients. Our studies suggest that, during the epidemic of NCP in Anhui province,
there was a certain proportion of infection and co-infection of other common
pathogens of CAP, and the secondary bacterial and fungal infection is not detectable
in NCP patients. In comparison with SARS-CoV-2 detection alone, this optimized
strategy combining multiple pathogen detection for identification of NCP and other
CAP patients as well as cultures and serologic tests for confirmed patients increases
the diagnosis efficiency and facilitates the personalized medication.

Introduction
In December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown origins were
reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and a novel beta-coronavirus was subsequently
identified from the respiratory specimens of the patients by High-throughput
sequencing[1]. The virus was confirmed as the cause of the unexplained pneumonia
and named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which
has resulted in a rapid outbreak throughout China and global spread, and posed a
significant threat to public health[2-6]. According to a recent study, the transmission
capacity of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-cov)[7]. In the meantime, the infection by the virus could cause
substantial critical conditions (14.8%~15.74%), as well as significant mortality
(1.4%~14.6%)[8-10]. Therefore,

early

diagnosis,

early

isolation and

early

management are crucial to curb rapid spread of the virus and improve the prognosis of
the patients[11].
Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) is an emerging community acquired
pneumonia (CAP). The clinical symptoms of NCP include fever, dry cough, muscle
pain and so on[8]. Ground-glass opacity and bilateral patchy shadowing were the
radiological features of the NCP patients[8, 12]. Whereas some pathogens, such as
RSV, parainfluenza virus may share similar imaging features (Figure 1). SARS-CoV-2
nucleic acid test is recommended as the standard for diagnosis of the disease.
However, this method is often affected by many factors such as sample collection and
reagent quality. False negative results could occur, resulting in delayed or missed
diagnosis[9]. In this study, both sputum and pharyngeal swab samples were collected,
then mixed and detected for SARS-CoV-2 using two different real-time RT-PCR
reagents, which significantly improved the positive rate of detection.
The winter is the season of high incidence of CAP, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid
detection can’t clearly suggest which pathogen is responsible for the SARS-CoV-2
negative patients, nor can it determine whether the positive patients have co-infection.
In order to improve the etiological diagnosis, 13 different respiratory tract pathogens

(RTPs) along with SARS-CoV-2 were simultaneously detected in suspected NCP
patients.
According to the Chinese “New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control
Program”[13], a second nucleic acid test is performed after 24 hours, and only when
both nucleic acid test results are negative can the patient be discharged. The average
hospitalization time of NCP patients was reported more than 14 days[14]. In order to
monitor whether secondary nosocomial infection occurs during hospitalization, we
used bacterial and fungal cultures and fungal serological tests to monitor secondary
infection in hospitalized patients with fever, increased sputum and increased
inflammatory factors.
In this study, we used different microbiological laboratory detection strategies for
suspected NCP patients and hospitalized confirmed patients, which allowed rapid
diagnosis of infection and co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other common
pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia. The results of microbial laboratory
detections can guide the clinical precise treatment and reduce the unnecessary use of
antibiotics.
Materials and Methods
Patients We recruited 181 patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from Jan
21 to Feb 29, 2020 at the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and
Technology(USTC) of China in Hefei, China. This hospital is designated to treat NCP
patients in Anhui Province. All of the suspected patients enrolled in this study met the
criteria of the latest “New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control
Program”[13]. Written consents were obtained from all of the patients and the study
was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of
USTC.

were collected from all suspected patients on the admission day, then mixed. Total
RNA was extracted from specimens using an automatic nucleic acid extraction
instrument (TANBead, China), SARS-CoV-2 was then detected by real-time RT-PCR
using two different detection kits. One kit selected ORF1ab gene as the target
sequence for detection (Beijing Genomics Institution, China), and the other one used
ORF1ab, E gene and N gene as the target sequences (Bioperfectus technologies,
China). In brief, the total RNA was added to the reaction reagent and dual
fluorescence PCR (Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR Systems, USA) was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. If the first SARS-CoV-2
real-time RT-PCR result is negative, the respiratory specimens will be collected again
after 24 hours for another test.

2. Detection of common pathogens in community acquired pneumonia using the
SureX 13 respiratory pathogen multiplex kit The SureX 13 respiratory pathogen
multiplex kit (Ningbo Health Gene Technologies Ltd Ningbo, China) was used to
detect 13 common pathogens of CAP, including influenza A virus (FluA), pandemic
influenza A virus-2009 (09H1), seasonal H3N2 virus (H3), influenza B virus (FluB),
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenoviruses (AdVs), rhinovirus (HRV), bocavirus
(HBoV), metapneumovirus (HMPV), parainfluenza virus (PIV, including PIV-1, 2, 3
and 4), coronavirus (CoV, including OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1), Chlamydia [Ch,
including Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) and Cp] and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In brief,
the extracted nucleic acid was mixed with primer pairs targeting the 13 tested RTPs
and RT-PCR enzyme mix, and the PCR amplification was performed in Biosystems
7500 Real-Time PCR Systems, followed by capillary electrophoresis. PCR products
were then separated by size on the Applied Biosystems 3500Dx Genetic Analyzer.
The signals of the 15 labeled PCR products were finally measured by fluorescence
and analyzed with GeneMapper 4.1 software (Termo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA).

Monitoring strategy

for secondary

infection

in NCP patients during

hospitalization
1.

Culture If a patient had fever, aggravated cough, imaging changes or increased
inflammatory factors in the course of treatment, sputum sample would be
obtained for identification of possible causative bacteria or fungi. All specimens
were plated onto sheep blood agar (SBA), chocolate agar, MacConkey agar and
Sabouraud agar. The Sabouraud agar plates were incubated at 27 ℃ for 5 days
and the other plates were held for 2 days at 35℃. Blood samples were collected
and injected into aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottle. The culture of
aerobic and anaerobic organisms was performed in the BACT ALERT 3D
(BioMerieux, France). When the blood culture system reported positive, the
corresponding blood sample was then subcultured onto blood agar and sabouraud
agar plates. Plates were held at 35 ℃

for 2 days and checked for colony

formation.

2.

Fungal serologic tests If fungal infection was suspected in a patient, the blood
samples would be obtained for GM test (Dynamiker Biotechnology, Tianjin,
China) and for detection of Aspergillus galactomannan antigen. In brief, the
serum samples were added into wells precoated with galactomannan antibody and
then incubated. The wells were washed to remove the unbound material, and then
added the conjugate and incubated. Finally, the substrate solution was added into
the wells for color development which was terminated by adding the stopping
solution. The absorbance (optical density) of specimens and controls was
determined with a spectrophotometer at 450 and 620/630 nm wavelength.
G test offers a diagnostic reference for invasive fungal diseases. To carry out
the test, the pre-treated sera were added into the Main Reagent containing Factor
G. The latter was activated by (1-3)-β-D-Glucan and converted from proclotting

405nm kinetically, and the concentration of (1-3)-β-D-Glucan was interpreted
according to a standard curve.

Follow-up Clinical data were obtained from patients’ medical records. The patients
were followed up until Mar 8, 2020.

Results
In total, 181 patients were enrolled in this study. Among them, 129 were
suspected NCP patients and hospitalized for further diagnosis and treatment, and 52
patients were diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 infection in other medical institutions and
transferred to our hospital.

Dual reagents screening with mixed sputum and pharyngeal swab samples
improved the sensitivity of detection of SARS-CoV-2 Of the 129 suspected patients,
33 patients were confirmed of SARS-CoV-2 infection by using our dual specimen and
dual reagents screening strategy through real-time RT-PCR assays. Of these 33
confirmed patients, 31 (93.93%) patients were positive in the first test. The 96
excluded patients were observed in hospital and followed up after discharge, and no
additional NCP was found.

Detection of pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2 in community acquired
pneumonia 129 suspected patients were detected for 13 respiratory tract pathogens
other than SARS-CoV-2. Of the 33 NCP patients, one patient was also infected with
adenovirus and the other with rhinovirus. Of the 96 non-NCP patients, common CAP
pathogens were detected in 30 patients. Among them, one single pathogen infection
was detected in 28 patients, and two pathogens were found in 2 patients. The most
common pathogens were influenza A virus (18.75%), influenza B virus (18.75%),
Mycoplasma pneumoniae (18.75%) and metapneumovirus (15.63%), followed by
several other pathogens (Figure 2 and 4).

Bacterial and fungal cultures Blood cultures for 10 NCP patients，bacterial and
fungal cultures for sputum samples from 18 and 11 NCP patients, respectively, were
performed. No bacteria or fungi were isolated from any of these tested samples
(Figure 3).

Fungal serologic tests GM test was done in 9 NCP patients, and the results were
all negative. However, G test showed a nonspecific elevation in 6 out of 10 tested
NCP patients (Figure 3).

Treatment and outcome of patients NCP patients were treated based on the
severity of the disease according to latest “New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention
and Control Program”. Non-NCP patients with a definite microbial diagnosis were
treated according to the international community acquired pneumonia guidelines. By
Mar 8 of 2020, 84 (98.82%) NCP patients was discharged from hospital (including 29
patients with severe NCP) and 1 (1.17%) patient died from the disease. The average
hospitalization time of NCP patients was 16.79days. The dead case was a 55-year-old
man and was transferred to our hospital after confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection.
He was diagnosed with severe pneumonia, severe respiratory failure and cerebral
apoplexy. One day after admission to our intensive care unit (ICU), the patient died
from a sudden cardiac arrest. 91 (94.79%) non-NCP patients were discharged from
hospital, 4 (4.17%) were transferred to other hospitals for further treatment, and 1
(1.04%) died.

Discussion
The SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus and is the
seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus[4, 5]. The SARS-CoV, which caused
an epidemic in 2002-2003, also belongs to this genus. Infection with these two viruses
often leads to lower respiratory tract disease with poor clinical outcomes associated
with old age and underlying health[15], while SARS-CoV-2 seems to be more
transmissible than SARS-CoV[7]. The virus is transmitted mainly through respiratory

droplets or close contact. A recent study revealed that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 is 3.77,
meaning that each infector could transmit the virus to another 3.77 people, which is
higher than the R0 of SARS (2.0-3.0)[16]. As of Mar. 12th of 2020, data from the
World Health Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 125,048 patients have
been confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in 117 countries/regions[17].
Therefore, accurate identification and subsequent isolation of NCP patients plays a
vital role in blocking the spread of the virus.
Currently, the most commonly used golden standard for NCP diagnosis is a
positive result of the real-time RT-PCR assay. However, Ai et al. reported that 3
suspected patients were negative in real-time RT-PCR assay and were later confirmed
by metagenomics sequencing[9]. Wang et al. also reported that some patients were
negative in the first three tests and turned to positive on the fourth test[18]. In this
study, we confirmed 33 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 from 129 suspected
patients. 31(93.94%) of the patients were positive in the first RT-PCR test. Moreover,
none of the patients who was negative in our first two tests were later diagnosed as
NCP after discharge from hospital. The high positive rate of our assay might be due to
the fact that we collected and detected both sputum and pharyngeal swab samples.
Furthermore, we detected SARS-CoV-2 with two different kits simultaneously, and
only if both results were negative was the patient excluded from SARS-CoV-2
infection. If the results of the two reagents are not consistent, we will use another
reagent for re-examination. These measures significantly improved the accuracy of
our diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection and NCP.
In our study, 13 RTPs detections were performed in 33 NCP patients ， and 2
(6.06%) patients were found to be co-infected with adenovirus or rhinovirus. Both of
these two patients didn’t develop into severe conditions, but recovered and were
discharged 20 and 24 days after being treated with Coolidge plus Ribavirin. Our
findings were consistent with a recent study which reported that none of 99 patients
had co-infection of other respiratory viruses[4]. However, Ai et al. reported a high
co-infection rate by using mNGS assay which found 5 out of 20 NCP patients
co-infected with other viruses[9].

Of the 96 non-NCP patients, 31.25% (30/96) patients were detected at least one
respiratory tract pathogen by the SureX 13 respiratory pathogen multiplex kit. The
most common pathogen was influenza (including influenza A and B), followed by
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and metapneumovirus. Our findings were consistent with
previous studies that reported the detection rate of pathogens in CAP adults as 30-40%[19].
Respiratory viruses were detected more frequently than bacteria. The most common
pathogens in winter were human rhinovirus and influenza virus[19, 20]. In addition, about

70% of the 96 non-NCP patients in this study did not have any specific etiological
diagnosis, which may be due to the specimens that we used for the detection being
pharyngeal swabs but not alveolar lavage fluid. The positive rate of pharyngeal swab
specimen in diagnosing CAP is usually low[20]. The SureX 13 respiratory pathogen
multiplex kit used in this study did not include all common CAP pathogens such as
Legionella and Chlamydia psittaci. It was reported that detection of alveolar lavage
fluid with mNGS was able to detect more respiratory pathogens in CAP patients [21].
However, due to the difficulty in obtaining such samples and the high cost of the
detection, mNGS was not used in this study.
Previous studies reported that secondary bacterial infection commonly occurs in
influenza infection and is associated with an increased risk of death[22, 23]. In 2009
pandemic influenza A cases, 18% to 34% of patients admitted to the ICU also had
bacterial infection[22]. At present, there are few reports about the incidence of
secondary bacterial or fungal infection in NCP patients during treatment. Chen et al.
found that none of 99 patients had co-infection of other respiratory viruses, but 4
patients had co-infection of bacteria and fungi. Common pathogens included A
baumannii, K pneumoniae, A flavus, C glabrata, and C albicans. The authors believed
that the infection probably occurred secondary to severe ARDS and/or high dose or
prolonged use of glucocorticoid therapy[4]. In another study, Ai et al. found 6 cases
with bacterial and fungal infection among 20 NCP patients[9]. In our study, we did
not find any NCP patients with secondary bacterial or fungal infection during
treatment. Although 6 patients’ G test results were above the normal reference value,
they were all in severe condition and were given large amounts of albumin and

gamma globulin which possibly affected the test results. Moreover, all of the fungal
cultures were negative, and the patients did not receive any anti-fungal treatment but
still recovered. We suspect that the reason for the low occurrence of secondary
infection in our NCP patients is possibly due to the non-invasive regimens, such as
maintaining the oxygen saturation through High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy
(HFNC), but not mechanical ventilation. The patients did not receive peripherally
inserted central catheter (PICC), either. Another possible reason is that glucocorticoid
was very carefully used to treat the patients even in severe conditions. Our results
suggest that the abuse of antimicrobial agents should be avoided in the treatment of
patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Earlier studies on NCP patients in Wuhan reported high mortality as
11.1%-14.6%[1, 4]. However, recent studies based on large sample sizes with cases
throughout China found a markedly lower case fatality rate (3.92%)[17]. In this study,
the mortality of our 85 laboratory-confirmed NCP patients was only 1.18%. This
finding is consistent with a most recent study, reporting the mortality of 1.4% of 1,099
cases[8].
In conclusion, in the present study, we found a certain proportion of infection
and co-infection of other common pathogens of CAP during the NCP epidemic in
Anhui province. This suggested that improvement of accuracy in microbiological
laboratory detection is necessary to guide specific and precise treatment for the CAP
patients. In this study, no secondary bacterial or fungal infection was detected in NCP
patients during the treatment, suggesting that antibiotics should be used cautiously in
the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Please note that this is a
single-center study with limited number of patients. The conclusions of this study
need to be further verified by expanding the sample size.
