ABSTRACT
In December 2019, a coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
began infecting humans causing a novel disease, coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). This was first
described in the Wuhan province of the People’s Republic of China. SARS-CoV-2 spread throughout
the world causing a global pandemic. To date, thousands of cases of COVID-19 were reported in the
United Kingdom, and over 45,000 patients have died. Some progress has been achieved in managing
this disease, but the biological determinants of health, besides age, that affect COVID-19 infectivity
and mortality are under scrutiny. Recent studies show that several medical conditions, including
diabetes and hypertension, increase the risk of COVID-19 infection and death. The increased
vulnerability of the elderly and those with comorbidities, together with the prevalence of
neurodegenerative diseases with advanced age, led us to investigate the links between
neurodegeneration and COVID-19. We analysed the primary health records of 13,338 UK individuals
tested for COVID-19 between March and July 2020. We show that a pre-existing diagnosis of
Alzheimer’s disease predicts the highest risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality among the elderly.
In contrast, Parkinson’s disease patients were found to be at increased risk of infection but not
mortality from COVID-19. We conclude that there are disease-specific differences in COVID-19
susceptibility among patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders.

INTRODUCTION
The rapid emergence of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has caused over one million deaths
worldwide 1. The clinical features of patients affected by COVID-19 have been extensively explored,
but the predisposing factors contributing to increased transmission and clinical severity remains
unclear. Social and ecological health determinants such as air pollution

2-5

, have been suggested to

increase the risk of infection and exacerbate COVID-19 related illness. In addition, several
comorbidities have been shown to increase COVID-19 mortality rates, including cardiovascular and
respiratory pathologies 6,7. The predominance of these comorbidities in advanced age combined with
the increased incidence of mortality in elderly patients indicates that age is a major risk factor for
COVID-19 mortality 8. These observations raise concerns that elderly patients affected by chronic
diseases, including neurological manifestations, may be susceptible to increased risk of critical illness
from COVID-19. In addition to COVID-19, age is one of the major risk factors for neurodegenerative
disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD)9. Moreover, cardiovascular
and respiratory pathologies are not only risk factors for COVID-19 mortality, but also for dementia 1012

. In fact, new evidences show that pre-existing diagnosis of dementia represents an important risk

factor for COVID-19

13

. In one of the largest cohort studies of COVID-19 in Europe, data gathered

from 166 hospitals in England, Scotland, and Wales showed that dementia was amongst the most
common comorbidities in the 20,133 patients hospitalised for COVID-19, after adjusting for age and
other confounders

14

. Another study showed that patients with dementia and other neurological

diseases are at higher risk of COVID-19 in-hospital death

15

. In addition, an analysis of 153 non-

demented PD patients, without a history of lung disease, found that 40% of these patients had
respiratory difficulties

16

, showing that some sub-groups of PD patients may be at elevated risk of

severe complications following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
infection. Similarly, the high incidence of cognitive impairment in patients with AD, particularly in
the late stages of the disease, might be an important risk factor for COVID-19 infection and mortality
17

. These studies provide compelling evidence that individuals with dementia or neurodegenerative

diseases are at higher risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality, but it remains unclear if specific
subtypes of neurological disorders may differentially affect COVID-19 outcome. Furthermore, it
remains unclear which mechanisms underlie this putative association and whether specific types of
neurodegenerative diseases are associated with increased COVID-19 infection and mortality.
A recent review indicates that disease-specific neuropathology may underlie differential vulnerability
to COVID-19 infection and mortality among individuals affected by AD or PD

17

. In England and

Wales, 25.6% of all COVID-19 deaths registered between March and June 2020 are found in people
with dementia, making these the most common pre-existing conditions associated with COVID-19
mortality 18. However, it remains unclear if patients with PD are at greater risk of COVID-19 adverse
outcome compared to the general population

19

. Most studies to date only included data from

hospitalised or clinically suspected COVID-19 patients. Because a large proportion of COVID-19
infections are asymptomatic 20, these inclusion criteria likely led to some degree of misclassification,
as hospital admission rates for COVID-19 depend on the prevalence of community testing and
admission criteria, which vary between countries.
Here we explored whether individuals with dementia, AD or PD are at increased risk of COVID-19
infection and mortality using the UK Biobank. This dataset contains primary health records of more
than half a million individuals, including participants that were tested for COVID-19 since the
beginning of this pandemic. We found that a pre-existing diagnosis of dementia or AD predicts the
largest risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality. PD was associated with increased risk of infection
but not mortality from COVID-19. Findings from previous studies suggested an important role for
dementia in increasing susceptibility to COVID-19 14. Here we provide the first systematic analysis of
the relationship between COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases at the individual level. Our
results have important implications for disease management and further highlight an important role of
disease-specific neuropathology and management in the potential susceptibility to COVID-19.

METHODS
UK Biobank data sources
The UK Biobank comprises health data from over 500,000 community volunteers aged 40 to 70 years
at baseline (2006 to 2010), living close to 22 assessment centers in England, Scotland and Wales 21.
Baseline assessments included demographics, lifestyle and disease history, with linkages to electronic
medical records. UK Biobank ethical approval was granted from the North West Multi-Centre
Research Ethics Committee. The current analysis was approved under the UK Biobank application
#60124. Details regarding the geographical regions, recruitment processes, and other characteristics
have been previously described

21

. A detailed list of the variables analysed in the present study is

presented in Supplementary Table 1. We defined hypertension using the criteria of a diastolic blood
pressure ≥ 90 mmHg OR systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg. Individual-level data was collected
from the UK Biobank on August 17, 2020.
Study design and exclusion criteria
We conducted a cohort study using national primary care electronic health record data linked to inhospital COVID-19 death data (see UK biobank data sources). Of the 13,338 participants with
available COVID-19 data, 1,626 tested positive for COVID-19 between March 16 and July 26 (2020)
and 11,712 were negative. The majority of samples tested for COVID-19 disease were derived from
combined nose/throat swabs and analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). More

information on the testing procedure can be found on the UK Biobank website

22

. During the same

period, COVID-19 testing in England was restricted to hospitalized patients with clinical signs of the
disease and health care workers. In contrast, all UK Biobank participants included in this study were
subjected to COVID-19 testing since the beginning of the pandemic. For our models, we defined a
positive outcome as either a positive COVID-19 diagnosis or an in-hospital death in COVID-19
positive cases. Risk factors and covariates used for the present analysis were selected on the basis of
clinical interest and prior findings. These are shown in Supplementary Table 1 and included dementia,
AD, PD, frontotemporal, vascular dementia, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, blood group, age,
sex, obesity, respiratory difficulties [Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and wheezing],
forced expiratory volume (FEV), gray and white matter volume, brain volume, white matter
hyperintensity and C-reactive protein levels (CRP). Obesity was defined based on waist-to-hip ratio
measurements. Waist-to-hip ratio is determined by dividing waist circumference by hip
circumference, meaning that overweight individuals have higher ratios 23. We grouped smoking status
into current, former and never smokers. CRP total levels were normalised according to protein total
protein levels, and log-transformed to fit a normal distribution. Other covariates considered as
potential upstream risk factors were population density, social deprivation, average household
income, education level, housing type, ethnicity, environmental risk at workplace (chemical, diesel,
dusty, smoke), travel to work and number of people per household. Deprivation was measured using
the Townsend Social Deprivation Index (TSDI) 24, with higher values indicating higher deprivation,
derived from the patient’s postcode for a higher degree of precision. Ethnicity was grouped into white
or minority ethnicities. The full list of minority groups used for our analysis can be found in
Supplementary Table 2. Information on all covariates were obtained from primary care records
provided by the UK Biobank. The geographical distribution of each subject included in the analysis is
shown in Figure 1.

Statistical analysis
For the analysis of COVID-19 infection and mortality, we fitted binomial regression models where
the response variables were, respectively, COVID-19 positivity or COVID-19-related death. We
defined COVID-19-related death as an individual who tested positive for COVID-19 and died. For the
multivariable model of COVID-19 infection, we omitted FEV, COPD, environmental risk at the
workplace, and travel to work due to a large number of individuals having missing data. Methods for
assessing the fit of the model included residual analyses, diagnostic tests, and information criterion fit
statistics. The goodness of fit of each regression model was determined using the log-likelihood and
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) statistics. When analysing COVID-19 outcome, we applied an
iterative variable selection procedure combining unsupervised stepwise forward and stepwise
backward regression analyses to select the most suitable predictor or combination of predictors in our

models, based on AIC values. For all models, we calculated the odds or risk ratios and their 97.5%
confidence intervals to quantify the effects of the independent variables on the response variables. The
models were built using the MASS package

25

in R. The comparison tables were generated using the

26

Stargazer package . The analysis source code, detailed quality checks as well as all Supplementary
material is available in GitHub (https://m1gus.github.io/AD_PD_COVID19/). Statistical significance
was defined as p ≤ 0.05.

RESULTS

AD and PD diagnoses are associated with an increase in SARS-CoV2 infections in the UK
Biobank cohort
To explore the links between neurodegenerative diseases and COVID-19, we first estimated the risk
between COVID-19 and chronic diseases. Chronic diseases often coexist in older adults

11,12,27

.

Therefore, we assessed their risk after adjusting for other existing comorbidities (see Figure 1A for
the workflow) for an aged and predominantly white cohort in Great Britain (Figure 1B and 1C). Using
an iterative variable selection procedure, combining unsupervised stepwise forward and backward
regression analyses, we found that a pre-existing diagnosis of dementia is associated with the largest
increase in the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 (OR 3.25; 97.5% CI 2.73-3.87),
Supplementary Table 3. This is followed by increasing waist-to-hip ratio (OR 3.07; 97.5% CI 2.264.17), poor education (OR 1.67; 97.5% CI 1.38-2.02), number of people per household (OR 1.05;
97.5% CI 1.03-1.07) and social deprivation (TSDI) (OR 1.03; 97.5% CI 1.02-1.04) (Figure 2A). Our
findings confirm previous studies showing that dementia predicts one of the highest risks of COVID19 infection in elderly individuals

28,29

. Furthermore, consistent with previous observations

30

, our

primary analysis identified white ethnicity (OR 0.72; 97.5% CI 0.66-0.77), cancer (OR 0.81; 97.5%
CI 0.74-0.89) and decreasing age (OR 0.97; 97.5% CI 0.97-0.97) as significant predictors of SARSCoV-2 infectivity, after adjusting for multiple confounding factors (Figure 2A). As recent studies
highlighted links between the global burden of dementia and COVID-19 death28, we next assessed
whether diagnosis of dementia increases the risk of COVID-19 mortality in the UK Biobank. Similar
to the COVID-19 infection models, we found that a diagnosis of dementia was associated with the
largest risk of mortality from COVID-19 (OR 4.32; 97.5% CI 3.33-5.60), followed by male gender
(OR 1.44; 97.5% CI 1.20-1.73), increasing age (OR 1.09; 97.5% CI 1.08-1.07), and social deprivation
(OR 1.07; 97.5% CI 1.05-1.09) (Figure 2B and Supplementary Table 4). Cancer was negatively
associated with an increased risk of mortality in our cohort (OR 0.56; 97.5% CI 0.44-0.72).

Given the prominent role of dementia in COVID-19 diagnosis, we next analysed how different types
of dementia are associated with COVID-19. The overall cumulative incidence of PD and AD
diagnosis among COVID-19 test positive patients in our cohort was 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively
(Supplementary Table 5). Our results show that a diagnosis of AD was strongly associated with
COVID-19 infectivity, with AD patients showing the greatest susceptibility to COVID-19 infectivity
compared to individuals without AD (OR 4.15; 97.5% CI 3.22-5.34). We also found that an increase
in waist-to-hip ratio (OR 3.08; 97.5% CI 2.27-4.19) or pre-existing vascular dementia (OR 2.51;
97.5% CI 1.69-3.71) are also positively associated with COVID-19 infection (Figure 3A). PD
diagnosis also emerged as a strong positive predictor of COVID-19 infection (OR 1.71; 97.5% CI
1.37-2.13), although the effect was smaller than the one for AD diagnosis. Low education level (OR
1.65; 97.5% CI 1.36-2.0), higher number of people per household (OR 1.05; 97.5% CI 1.03-1.07) or
increased Townsend deprivation index (OR 1.03; 97.5% CI 1.02-1.04) emerged as significant
predictors of a positive COVID-19 diagnosis (Figure 3). Our analysis shows that patients of white
ethnicity (OR 0.72; 97.5% CI 0.66-0.77) or with pre-existing diagnosis of cancer (OR 0.81; 97.5% CI
0.72-0.88) are at lower risk of infection in our cohort, while increasing age does not predict increased
risk of infection (OR 0.97; 97.5% CI 0.97-0.97; Figure 3A).
AD patients are at higher risk of COVID-19 death
Although our results show that patients with dementia are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19,
it remains unclear if the presence of neurological comorbidities may exacerbate the risk of mortality
in COVID-19 patients. To address this issue, we examined the characteristics and outcomes of all
COVID-19 patients in the cohort using a binary multivariable regression model (Figure 3B and
Supplementary Table 6). Given the large number of variables in our models, we simplified our
analysis using an iterative stepwise regression approach to select the most suitable predictors of
COVID-19 death based on AIC. In terms of neurological diseases, diagnosis of frontotemporal
dementia (OR 16.36; 97.5% CI 5.44-49.15) and AD (OR 4.17; 97.5% CI 2.87-6.05) were associated
with the largest risk of COVID-19 death but not PD or vascular dementia. In our model, pre-existing
diagnosis of cancer was negatively associated with COVID-19 death (OR 0.63; 97.5% CI 0.51-0.79)
and no significant association was found between diabetes, C-reactive protein levels and ethnicity
(Figure 3B). We also found that living in socially deprived areas increases the risk of COVID-19
adverse outcome (OR 1.07; 97.5% CI 1.05-1.09), while an increased waist-to-hip ratio (OR 5.83;
97.5% CI 2.18-15.58) or male gender (OR 1.38; 97.5% CI 1.16-1.65) were positively associated with
COVID-19 death but this relationship did not reach statistical significance.
We next focused on the role of AD on COVID-19-related deaths. We first built a model that only
contains participants with a positive AD diagnosis (Supplementary Table 7). Using this model, we
found that none of the previously mentioned comorbidities were significant. This observation

indicates that participants with AD are at higher risk of dying from COVID-19, independently from
age, sex and other comorbidities.

DISCUSSION
Despite considerable uncertainty in estimates of COVID-19 outcomes, age and comorbid medical
conditions are consistently associated with adverse health outcomes in hospitalised COVID-19
patients

15

. The incidence of neurological conditions, including dementia and neurodegenerative

diseases, increases with age, and it has recently been proposed that individuals with pre-existing
diagnosis of dementia may be at increased risk of developing COVID-19

13

. In previous viral

outbreaks of respiratory pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East
respiratory syndrome, and H1N1 influenza, several reports also highlighted the presence of
neurological comorbidities in affected patients 31,32. In the present study, we found that the largest risk
factors associated with COVID-19 infection are a pre-existing diagnosis of dementia associated with
AD, vascular dementia or PD. However, while diagnosis of AD also predicts increased risk of
COVID-19 mortality, our findings suggest that COVID-19 mortality among PD and vascular
dementia patients does not differ from the general population.
A close relationship between COVID-19 and neurological disorders is well established in the
literature. An early report

13

this year showed that dementia diagnosis is associated with the largest

increase in the risk of COVID-19 infection in a smaller cohort of patients in England aged 65 and
older. Dementia has also been found to increase the risk of in-hospital mortality in a large crosssectional analysis of 20,133 patients already hospitalised for COVID-19 in the UK 14, a finding later
replicated by two later studies

15,33

. However, these studies mostly focussed on hospitalised

individuals and did not include data on patients managed in the community settings, such as domestic
residences. In addition, in line with government guidelines, testing was limited to individuals with
COVID-19 symptoms meaning that their figures do not include the growing number of people who
are asymptomatic or are self-isolating at home due to mild symptoms 14. Using granular data from the
UK Biobank, we have developed a more robust analysis pipeline, since all participants in our dataset
received COVID-19 testing. Because a large proportion of COVID-19 infections are asymptomatic,
this screening protocol is more sensitive for the analysis of COVID-19 infection and mortality rates
among people diagnosed with neurological diseases.
Our results indicate that AD patients are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection. These findings
expand a recent analysis with a smaller sample size of COVID-19 positive individuals from the UK
Biobank. In this study, Zhou and colleagues showed that AD is the most significant risk factor for
COVID-19 infection but its association with increased COVID-19 mortality was not investigated

34

.

Here, we build on these earlier observations to show that AD is a major risk factor associated with

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.05.20226605; this version posted November 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

COVID-19 mortality, after accounting for a large number of comorbidities. Several features of AD
may increase the risk of COVID-19 adverse outcome. First, the neuropathology of AD could facilitate
COVID-19 complications. Accumulating evidence suggests that amyloid fibrils induce microglial
activation and increased activation of the type-1 interferon (IFN) pathway, a crucial component of
COVID-19 infection

35

. Current theories propose that the IFN response in AD may synergise with

COVID-19 upon SARS-CoV-2 infection creating the ‘perfect storm’ of excessive immune responses
and thus exacerbating pathology 36. Supporting the hypothesis of a neurobiological link between AD
and COVID-19 mortality, a recent study further demonstrated that protein expression levels of
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 , are upregulated in
the brain of AD patients 37. This suggests that higher ACE2 expression may underscore higher viral
load in the brain of AD patents, corroborating a potential link between AD neuropathology and
COVID-19 mortality

38

. Finally, the social behaviour of patients with dementia and AD must be

considered. Cognitive decline may compromise the ability of individuals with AD to follow the
recommendations of public health authorities, increasing the likelihood of contagion and the need for
carers

39

. Behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) of dementia and AD, such as motor

agitation, intrusiveness, or wandering, may further undermine efforts to maintain isolation.
We also found that PD is associated with a heightened risk of COVID-19 infectivity but not mortality.
This is consistent with a retrospective study conducted in Japan where patients with parkinsonism
hospitalised with pneumonia were found to display a lower rate of in-hospital mortality than age- and
sex-matched controls 40. Two recent studies from Italy have reported increased COVID-19 mortality
rates among PD patients. One group gathered clinical information on 120 community-dwelling PD
patients and reported a mortality rate of 20%, a value significantly higher than the general population
41

. The second study found that PD patients of older age (>78 years) display increased susceptibility to

COVID-19 death compared to younger patients

42

. However, both studies used clinically suspected

(non-laboratory confirmed) COVID-19 cases, which complicates their interpretation. As noted by the
authors, the increased susceptibility to COVID-19 may have resulted in some patients being
incorrectly identified as COVID-19 positive, thus leading to misclassification of COVID-19-related
deaths. Moreover, the accuracy of prevalence data might further be hampered by the existence of
asymptomatic cases and the lack of population screening campaigns in Italy. Our results support a
recent case-controlled study, which shows that PD is not associated with any apparent risk of
morbidity and mortality compared to the general population 43.
Although the biological basis for the higher mortality rate in AD compared to PD patients remains to
be elucidated, it has recently been suggested that PD neuropathology itself might exercise a
neuroprotective effect against COVID-19. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor,
which is highly expressed in the dopaminergic neurons of the striatum

44

. However, PD-related

neuropathology induces significant degeneration of these neurons, pointing to reduced neuroinvasion
in these patients 17. Secondly, increased neuronal expression of α-synuclein following acute West Nile

virus infection suggests that this protein could function as a native antiviral factor within neurons 45.
Finally, a number of PD drugs have been hypothesised to play a therapeutic role in COVID-19.
Among these, accumulating evidence shows that amantadine may inhibit viral replication and protect
against severe outcomes in PD patients 46. The proposed mechanism of action involves disruption of
the lysosomal machinery needed for viral replication

47

and there is preliminary evidence of a

protective effect against COVID-19 in a small cohort of PD patients, all taking L-DOPA and having
tested positive for SARS CoV-2 48. In the present study, none of the PD patients receiving amantadine
treatment developed severe complications from COVID-19 and only one patient tested positive for
SARS CoV-2 (Supplementary Table 9). Although limited by a small sample size, our preliminary
analysis is in line with the hypothesis that amantadine may exert a protective effect against both
COVID-19 infection and mortality. Further clinical studies should be conducted to corroborate the
therapeutic utility of amantadine for the treatment of COVID-19.
This study presents several caveats. First, our cohort is not representative of the UK population. For
instance, the majority of COVID-19 related deaths in the UK took place in care homes 49. However,
only six patients included in our study were reported to live in long-term care facilities, and none of
them tested positive for COVID-19. Therefore, our analysis of patients affected by chronic
neurological diseases only included patients living in domestic residences where rapid changes in
social behaviour and domestic care may have affected distinct patient groups differently. This feature
might have led us to overestimate the effect of chronic neurological illness on the risk of COVID-19
infection and mortality and further investigation is needed to confirm the generalisability of our
results. In addition, it is important to recognise the indirect effects of the current pandemic on AD
patients. Because elderly individuals are at increased risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19
infection, government guidelines recommend the isolation of these individuals and limited contact
with their family members

50

. However, social activities as well as time spent with other people is

generally considered to help prevent cognitive decline in the elderly 51. Therefore, it is plausible that
isolation, albeit necessary, may lead to increased stress and cognitive decline among AD patients 52. In
turn, these behavioural difficulties may exacerbate underlying neurological illness contributing to
higher rates of hospitalisation and a higher risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality 52. While these
effects are challenging to measure in the midst of a pandemic, large-scale retrospective studies will
reveal the full range of implications of current isolation measures on AD and COVID-19. Finally,
several potentially relevant comorbidities, such as kidney disease, previous myocardial infarction, and
stroke, were not included in data collection. Future studies should validate our results by examining
the effect of additional comorbidities as well as other factors that we were unable to examine,
including access to personal protective equipment, employment, exposure to environmental hazards
and the effect of living in care home facilities.
In conclusion, our results support detailed analyses of the biological mechanisms underlying diseasespecific vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 among patients with neurological illness. Improved knowledge

A, Workflow of the analysis. Of 505,505 UK Biobank participants, 13,338 participants were tested for
COVID-19 as of 26 July 2020. We modelled the covariates that affect COVID-19 infectivity or
COVID-19-related death using only participants that were tested for COVID-19. We define a
COVID-19-related death as a participant who both tested positive for the COVID-19 virus and died.
B, Distribution of the UK Biobank participants in the United Kingdom. C, Descriptive statistics of the
cohort analysed. The number of participants in each category precede their percentage with respect to
the total cohort. For the “Age” category, the mean and standard deviation are shown. A full table of
summary characteristics is available in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. SW, South West; SE, South
East; E, East; M, Midlands; NE, North East; NW, North West.

Figure 2. Dementia is the largest risk
factor COVID-19 infectivity and
death.
Odds ratio and their respective 97.5%
CIs for the relationship between
individual-level characteristics and
COVID-19 cases (A) or deaths (B). For
simplicity, characteristics were subgrouped into three categories, namely
‘comorbidities’, ‘other risk factors’ and
‘socio-economic’. Red indicates
significant associations (p ≤ 0.05), while
grey indicates a lack of significance (p>
0.05). The odds ratios for education
levels are relative to A-levels.
NVQ/HND/HNC, participants who
received vocational qualifications such
as National Vocational Qualifications
(NVQ), Higher National Certificate
(HNC) or Higher National Diploma
(HND); CSEs, participants with a
Certificate of Secondary Education
(CSEs); O-levels/GCSEs, participants
with either a General Certificate of
Secondary Education (GCSE) or a
General Certificate of Education (GCE)
Ordinary Level (O-levels), a secondary
school leaving qualification. This figure
is related to Supplementary Tables 3 and
4.
