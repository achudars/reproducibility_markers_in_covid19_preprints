Abstract
Currently, a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV causes an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan,
China. Little is known about its epidemiological characteristics. Using the travel history and
symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside Wuhan, we estimate the
mean incubation period to be 6.4 (5.6 – 7.7, 95% CI) days, ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days
(2.5th to 97.5th percentile). These values help to inform case definitions for 2019-nCoV and
appropriate durations for quarantine.

Early January 2020, a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV, has been identified as the infectious
agent that causes an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, where the first cases
had their symptom onset in December 2019 [1]. This newly discovered virus causes a severe
acute respiratory disease. The rapid spread in Wuhan and throughout China poses a great
strain on health care system and disrupts the local societies. The multiple cases showing up
outside China cause international concern.
The virus is related to the SARS coronavirus and MERS coronavirus, but is distinct from each
of those viruses [2], such that the epidemiological key parameters have to be identified for
this new virus from incoming case reports as the epidemic continues. Chief among these key
parameters is the incubation period distribution. The range of the values for the incubation
period is essential to epidemiological case definitions, and is required to determine the
appropriate duration of quarantine. Moreover, knowledge of the incubation period helps to
assess the effectiveness of entry screening and contact tracing. The distribution of the
incubation period is also used in estimating the size of the epidemic [3 – 5] and the
transmission potential [6, 7]. In absence of data on the 2019-nCoV incubation period, the
WHO has worked with a broad range of 0 to 14 days, the CDC has taken a range of 2 to 14
days, and several studies have assumed incubation periods of SARS or MERS coronaviruses.
Here we present the distribution of incubation periods estimated for travellers from Wuhan
with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, using their reported travel histories and symptom
onset dates.

Travellers from Wuhan with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, a reported symptom onset
data and a reported travel history
In January 2020 an increasing number of cases were detected outside Wuhan, China and
confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV. For 88 cases detected between 20 and 28
January, the travel history (to and) from Wuhan is known as well as their symptom onset
date. Their ages range from 2 to 72 years old (with four missing), 31 of them are women, 57
are men. During this initial stage of the epidemic, it is most likely that these travellers were
infected in Wuhan. Consequently, their time spent in Wuhan can be taken as the duration of
exposure to infection.
Of these 88 cases with known travel history, 63 were Wuhan residents and travelled
elsewhere, and 25 visited Wuhan for a limited time. By taking the date of symptom onset
and travel history together we inferred the possible values that the incubation period could
have been for each of these cases. Examples of these reports are:
“First confirmed imported nCov pneumonia patient in Shanxi: male, visited Wuhan from
01/12/2020 to 01/15/2020, symptom onset on 01/19/2020, visit clinic on 01/20/2020, 6
contacts traced.” which gives an observed incubation period between 4 and 7 days.
“First confirmed imported nCov pneumonia patient in Shanghai (from Wuhan): female, 56,
Wuhan residence, arrived in Shanghai from Wuhan on 01/12/2020, symptom onset and
visited fever clinic on 01/15/2020, laboratory confirmed on 01/20/2020” which gives an
observed incubation period of 3 days or longer.
The data used for this analysis has been translated from Chinese sources and made publicly
available [8]. We took the data as available on January 29, 2020 (supplementary material
S1).

Incubation period distribution
Using the duration of stay in Wuhan and the symptom onset date, we obtained a range of
possible values for the incubation period of each case. We fitted three parametric forms for
the incubation period distribution to these ranges: the Weibull distribution, the gamma
distribution, and the lognormal distribution. We used a Bayesian approach to fitting, that
allows for the use of prior knowledge to inform the analysis. We specified strictly positive
flat prior probability distributions for the parameter values of the three distributions
(supplementary material S2), which ensured our estimates are conservative. Because of the
high number of observations, the impact of the priors on the outcome was negligible. We
used a uniform prior probability distribution over the exposure interval for the moment of
infection for each case. We sampled from the posterior distribution using the rstan package
[9] in R [10] (supplementary material S3).
Figure 1 shows the time line for each case, where the cases without a maximum incubation
period lack an unexposed (gray) period. However, the estimated infection times for these
cases are close to the end of the exposure window, informed by the cases that do have a
maximum incubation period.

The Weibull distribution provided the best fit to the data (Tab. 1). The mean incubation
period was estimated to be 6.4 (5.6 – 7.7, 95% credible interval) days. The incubation period
ranges from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile) (Tab. 2 and Fig. 2). The results using
the gamma distribution provide a slightly poorer description of the data but provide a
similar range from 2.4 to 12.5 days. Although the lognormal distribution provides the
poorest fit to the data, the incubation period ranging from 2.4 to 15.5 days (2.5th to 97.5th
percentile) may be relevant for a conservative choice of quarantine periods.

Comparison of 2019-nCoV incubation period to incubation periods of SARS and MERS
coronaviruses
A comparison to the estimated incubation period distribution for MERS (Tab. 3 and Fig. 3)
shows that the values are remarkably similar, with mean values differing at most 1 day and
95th percentiles differing at most 2 days. The estimated mean incubation periods for SARS
are more variable between studies, including values shorter and longer than presented here
for 2019-nCoV. These findings imply that findings of previous studies that have assumed
incubation period distribution similar to MERS or SARS will not have to be adapted because
of a shorter or longer incubation period.

Discussion
We characterized the distribution of incubation periods for Chinese travellers infected with
2019-nCoV in Wuhan, who were reported as cases between 20 and 28 January 2020. The
study provides empirical evidence to back reports on a familial cluster where five family
members developed symptoms 3 – 6 days after exposure [18] and a reported range from 2
to 11 days based on 16 travellers between Wuhan and Guangdong [19]. It fits within the
range from 0 to 14 days that has been assumed by the WHO.
In our analysis we assumed a uniform prior probability of being infected during the period of
stay in Wuhan. Since the epidemic was developing during that time period, it is more likely
that travellers were infected toward the end rather than the beginning of their stay. This

might produce a slight bias towards longer incubation periods, so the estimated upper limit
of 11.1 days could be considered conservative.
The travellers in this study represent a selective sample of the reported cases. We found
travellers to be more often male and younger than the cases reported. The numbers are too
small to detect systematic differences in incubation time with age or sex. Because we only
have information on confirmed cases, there is likely a bias towards more severe cases in
areas with a functioning health care system. As the epidemic continues, it remains
important to collect more information on incubation periods of 2019-nCoV cases of older
ages, of persons with underlying morbidity, of women, and of persons with mild symptoms.
There are various choices one can make about the parametric form of the incubation period
distribution. The results with the three often-used forms we report here suggest that there
is little impact on the mean and dispersion of the incubation periods. Of these three, the
lognormal distribution assigns higher probabilities to longer incubation periods. Although
we found that this distribution provided a poorer description of the data than the Weibull
and the gamma distributions, it is prudent not to dismiss the possibility of incubation
periods up to 14 days at this stage of the epidemic.
Our study helps in choosing an appropriate duration for quarantine. Keeping infected
persons in quarantine up to 14 days will ensure that they do not develop symptoms after
release.
