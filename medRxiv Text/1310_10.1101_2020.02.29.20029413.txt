COVID-19 started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. It both
spread rapidly to all provinces in China and started spreading around the world
quickly through international human movement from January 2020. Currently, the
spatiotemporal epidemic transmission patterns, prediction models, and possible
risk analysis for the future are insufficient for COVID-19 but we urgently need

12

relevant information, particularly from the global perspective.

We have developed a novel two-stage simulation model to simulate the
spatiotemporal changes in the number of COVID-19 cases and estimate the future
worldwide risk. Based on the connectivity of countries to China and the country's

medical and epidemic prevention capabilities, different scenarios are generated to
analyze the possible transmission throughout the world and use this information
to evaluate each country’s vulnerability to and the dynamic risk of COVID-19.

19

Countries’ vulnerability to the COVID-19 outbreak from China is calculated for

22
23

63 countries around the world. Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Japan are
the most vulnerable areas. The relationship between each country’s vulnerability
and days before the first imported case occurred shows a very high exponential
decrease. The cumulative number of cases in each country also has a linear

24
25
26
27

relationship with vulnerability, which can compare and quantify the initial
epidemic prevention capabilities to various countries’ management strategies. In
total, 1,000 simulation results of future cases around the world are generated for
the spatiotemporal risk assessment. According to the simulation results of this

study, if there is no specific medicine for it, it will likely form a global pandemic.
This method can be used as a preliminary risk assessment of the spatiotemporal
spread for a new global epidemic. * Note: This study was completed on February

Introduction

40

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection pneumonia outbreak

41

COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (Chan et al., 2020;

42

Li et al., 2020; Munster, Koopmans, van Doremalen, van Riel, & de Wit, 2020). It

43

spread rapidly to all provinces throughout China and started spreading around the world

44

quickly through international human movement from January 2020 (Li et al., 2020;

45

WHO, 2020). Thus far (February 2020), the epidemic has not decelerated but has started

46

breaking out internationally. For example, cluster outbreaks have occurred in Singapore,

47

Japan, and on international cruise ships (e.g. the Diamond Princess). With the exception

48

of China, countries are at the most critical stage to avoid outbreaks of domestic cluster

49

infections.

50

Many studies or reports have started revealing that SARS-CoV-2 is very infectious (Li

51

et al., 2020; Wu, Leung, & Leung, 2020) Many clinical cases are asymptomatic or

52

mildly diagnosed patients (Liu, Liao, Chang, Chou, & Lin, 2020), which greatly

53

increases the potential for transmission and makes epidemic prevention very difficult.

54

Therefore, it will likely evolve into a global pandemic of epidemic disease in the future.

55

Many countries have started implementing measures to prevent the epidemic spreading

56

in their countries, including stopping flights from China, quarantining at airports,

57

suspending visas for Chinese citizens, issuing travel warnings to China and advising

58

citizens not to visit China unless necessary, and implementing home quarantine or

59

stopping the entry and transfer of foreign tourists who have traveled to China within 14

60

days to prevent imported cases after overseas traveling. However, since many countries

61

have very close business or human relationships with China, it is impossible to avoid

62

imported cases. Therefore, to understand the initial transmission of novel infectious

63

diseases, we must first understand each country’s connectivity to the country of origin,

64

which is the first step for countries around the world to prevent the first stage of

65

overseas imported cases.

66

Since the outbreak, we all want to know how COVID-19 will spread from Wuhan all

67

across China and further from China to all around the world in terms of both time and

68

space. A previous study made preliminary estimations and predictions through a typical

69

infectious disease model called a susceptible–exposed–infectious–recovered (SEIR)

70

model (Wu et al., 2020); however, as it is a new infectious disease, it is difficult for us

71

to understand how the epidemic will develop in the future such as the parameters when

72

the peak is reached. Unknown infectious diseases have made it very difficult to adjust

73

and calibrate the parameters of various prediction models like the SEIR model, making

74

the model predictions very uncertain and restrictive. The totally different pattern of

75

transmission means that all spatiotemporal models or patterns from other coronaviruses

76

such as the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak and the Middle

77

East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are less suitable for use with COVID-19, even if

78

they have highly similar genome sequence identity (Lu et al., 2020; Qiao, 2020). In

79

addition, since the global epidemic is just beginning, there is insufficient data to

80

implement proper supervised learning models in machine learning methods or even

81

statistical models.

82

Currently, the spatiotemporal epidemic transmission patterns, prediction models, and

83

possible risk analyses for the future at the global-scale remain insufficient for COVID-

84

19 but we urgently need relevant information. This is an important and critical time for

85

global early-stage epidemic control and public health issues. It is difficult for us to

86

predict future case changes in various countries, particularly the first stage of overseas

87

imported cases from China and the second stage of local transmission cases. Under this

88

background of high uncertainty around COVID-19, our study aims at global COVID-

89

19 risk analysis from a data analysis perspective.

90

Understanding the connectivity with the country of origin for infectious diseases, i.e.

91

China, is a useful way for countries to quantitatively evaluate the risk of imported cases.

92

Higher connectivity is indicative of a higher risk of importation. In addition, for the

93

analysis of worldwide countries other than China, we can use the changes in the number

94

of cases that have been widespread in China's provinces to estimate the number of cases

95

worldwide. In other words, except for Hubei Province, where Wuhan is located, the

96

epidemic pattern of China’s provinces precedes that of countries around the world by

97

about 0.5–1 months. Thus, this can be used as a dynamic reference basis for case

98

prediction, simulation, and risk analysis in various countries (Figure 1).

103

In this study, we developed a novel two-stage simulation model to simulate the

104

spatiotemporal changes in the number of COVID-19 cases and estimate the future

105

worldwide risk based on a data-driven approach. Based on each country’s connectivity

106

to China, medical and epidemic prevention capabilities, and future conditions, different

107

scenarios are generated with which to analyze the potential transmission around the

108

world. Meanwhile, from a risk management perspective, understanding risk and proper

109

risk management is a very important part of preventing the spread of infectious diseases

110

in various countries. According to the definition of the Intergovernmental Panel on

111

Climate Change (IPCC) at the United Nations, risk can be considered a function of

112

exposure, hazard, and vulnerability (IPCC, 2014). Therefore, to assess the risk of

113

COVID-19 from China, we defined and calculated the countries’ exposure and hazard

114

of and vulnerability to COVID-19 around the world and generated comprehensive

115

spatiotemporal dynamic risk maps over time.

Methods

118
119

a.

Data

120

The original laboratory-confirmed cases data is collected from the WHO situation

121

reports of COVID-19 (WHO, 2020) and the Center for Systems Science and

122

Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHUCSSE, 2020) for

123

2020/1/21–2020/2/12. To define connectivity between countries, international

124

mobility data is calculated from flight route numbers between airports. If more

125

direct routes are found between two airports, this represents higher connectivity.

126

The original route data is accessible from Openflight.org, which is an open-source

127

project to collect and visualize flight information. The world’s Health Care Index

128

is collected from Numbeo, which is the world’s largest database of user-

129

contributed data about cities and countries worldwide. Population density data

130

were collected from the World Bank.

131

b. Two-stage simulation modeling framework:

132

First stage: Imported cases

133

Assuming that all countries are fully committed to epidemic prevention and well-

134

prepared for epidemic prevention but that there are no specific medicines or

135

vaccines, it is assumed that COVID-19 is not affected by climatic factors (such as

136

temperature). The changes in the case number for each country can be divided into

137

two major stages. The first stage is mainly based on imported cases of immigration

138

from abroad or sporadic cases of local traceable infection sources. The time that

139

the first case happens in each country and the daily number of subsequent cases

140

that continue to occur are based on the country’s Health Care Index and

141

connectivity to the country of outbreak. Here, the country’s vulnerability to

142

outbreak countries for coronavirus is defined as:

143

𝑉𝑘 = ∑
𝑖

144

(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦)𝑘𝑖
(𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑙𝑡ℎ 𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥)𝑘

It is made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license .

145

where V is the vulnerability of country k, i is the outbreak countries, the

146

connectivity is defined as the total number of flight routes between country k and

147

country i, the outbreak countries. The final vulnerability value is standardized to

148

0–1.

149

The higher the Health Care Index, the better the resistance against outbreaks from

150

outbreak countries so we have less vulnerability. Meanwhile, higher connectivity

151

or transmissibility indicates that a country has more interactions and higher human

152

mobility with outbreak countries, which makes the disease more easily transmitted

153

to this country, so it has a higher vulnerability.

154

We determine the time after the first case in each country based on the weight

155

calculation from the vulnerability. In the first stage, the daily confirmed cases

156

number is determined by a random number based on the historical data distribution

157

of the daily confirmed cases number and vulnerability in each country. In other

158

words, if a country has a high number of confirmed cases during the first stage, it

159

means that the country either lacks adequate medical conditions and epidemic

160

control measures or is highly vulnerable to China. It is very likely that there will

161

be a higher chance of a confirmed case in the future. In our results section, we

162

estimate and calibrate the vulnerability and the number of confirmed cases for each

163

country.

164

According to the available data and examples of local cluster infections in

165

Singapore, >40 cases are confirmed, which means that the potential for cluster

166

infections is quite high. After entering community cluster infections, the influence

167

of each country's own populace is greater than that of immigrants. Therefore, it is

168

defined as entering the second stage of simulation after the cumulative case

169

number is >40 cases.

170

Second stage: Localized outbreaks

171

It is assumed that in the second stage—after entering the local cluster infection—

172

the pattern change in the number of cases will be similar to that of Hubei Province

173

or other provinces in China. Since this study assumes that future information is

174

clearer than when China started its outbreak, all countries have already prepared

175

to prevent epidemic outbreaks. Therefore, a more conservative method is used to

176

carry out Monte Carlo simulation using data from provinces other than Hubei.

177

Generate 1,000 simulation data of future case growth and extract three scenarios

178

of high (quantile = 0.95), medium (quantile = 0.5), and low (quantile = 0.05)

179

infection from the simulation results while retaining the potential for changes in

180

the number of cases in Hubei as the worst future scenario (Extreme Scenario).

181

Both a sigmoid function and polynomial regression are used to extend the

182

simulation time for different assumed second scenarios, A sigmoid function is

183

used to assume that the epidemic in China has almost reached its peak as a more

184

conservative scenario; polynomial regression is used for the assumption that the

185

epidemic in China will continue and shows no signs of easing (Table 1).

Monte Carlo simulation is a very suitable risk-assessment method; it can perform

190

simulation based on limited data and different scenarios to understand the possible

191

risks since computers can easily simulate a huge number of experimental trials that

192

have random outcomes and uncertainty (Papadopoulos & Yeung, 2001). The

elements of the Monte Carlo simulation method including the expectation

U(x), and random draws X = x(j) from the target distribution π (Jørgensen, 2000).

196
197

c. Risk assessment:

198

Based on the Assessment Report published by the IPCC (Field, Barros, Stocker,

199

& Dahe, 2012; Pachauri et al., 2014; Parry et al., 2007). The risk assessment is

200

based on the results of the interaction of various components: hazard, vulnerability,

201

and exposure. In other words, the risk of adverse effects from the impact of

202

extreme events is defined as a function of the vulnerability, exposure, and hazard.

203

Here, extreme events would be outbreaks of COVID-19 in global countries.

204

Among them, we adapt the definition of vulnerability from IPCC; vulnerability is

205

the degree to which a system is susceptible to and unable to cope with the adverse

206

effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes (Parry et al.,

207

2007).

208

Therefore, according to the most commonly used approach to risk definition, the

209

risk is defined here as:

210

Risk = Hazard × Exposure × Vulnerability

211

The infectivity and mortality of COVID-19 under different climatic conditions

212

remain unknown at present, so it is assumed that the infectivity of COVID-19 and

213

the hazard to the human body are the same in all countries. The degree of hazard

214

in each country becomes the estimated number of cases within the country; the

215

greater the number of cases, the greater the potential hazard. Exposure is each

216

country’s population density. We assume that countries with higher population

217

densities are more likely to be exposed to COVID-19. Under the condition that

218

local cluster infection has occurred in the second stage, the higher the population

219

density, the more likely a serious outbreak and thus higher overall risk.

220

Vulnerability is defined as the ratio of connectivity to the Health Care Index

221

calculated in this study, as previously described. At present, only countries’

222

vulnerability to China is considered. In the future, it can be summed according to

223

whichever countries have experienced large-scale outbreaks based on the

224

superposition principle.

226

Result

227

a. Calibration of China’s confirmed case number

228

Since the local medical system in Hubei Province may be insufficient to support

229

the huge number of patients, the official diagnoses may be an underestimate.

230

Therefore, we first collected information on the evacuation flights from different

231

countries at different times to calculate the proportion of confirmed cases and used

232

this to estimate the infection rate in Wuhan based on the concept of statistical

233

sampling, as shown in Table 2.

234

Sample 1 was calculated based on the average of all cases in the countries collected

235

in Table 2. The proportion P1 = 0.51%, with 95% confidence interval [0.32%,

236

0.80%]. There are nine million current residents in Wuhan as announced by the

237

press conference held by the Hubei Provincial Government of China on the

238

evening of 1/26; of these, approximately 45,900 people with 95% confidence

239

interval [28,800, 72,000] may be infected. As of the official announcement of

240

2020/2/8, the number of confirmed cases in Hubei has reached 27,100 people, and

241

the number of confirmed cases in China has reached 34,546 people. This

242

estimation sample is insufficient to show the number of hidden cases.

243

According to the news press and public information, avoiding onboard infection

244

or the triggering of more domestic infections, many countries have screened

245

evacuating people, such as those who have a fever or with confirmed infections,

246

to prevent them from boarding planes. Therefore, this sampling will be

247

underestimated.

248

Sample 2 only collected cases of Japanese, German, and Malaysian evacuation

249

charter flights as these may be more relevant for sampling. In other words, the

250

worst scenario is taken here. The proportion P2 = 1.46%, with 95% confidence

251

interval [0.89%, 2.39%]. Based on the nine million people living in Wuhan, the

252

average number of people infected during early February was about 131,400 with

253

95% confidence interval [80,100, 215,100].

b. Vulnerability

259

Vulnerability to the COVID-19 outbreak from China is calculated for 63 countries

260

around the world, as shown in Figure 2. Table 3 shows the first 20 countries’

261

vulnerability. Taiwan has the highest vulnerability to novel coronavirus outbreak from

262

China, or broadly speaking to various human infectious diseases from China, followed

263

by South Korea, Hong Kong, and Japan. These countries are the most vulnerable,

264

followed by Thailand, the United States, Russia, Macau, and Singapore. The top-20

265

countries listed in Table 3 are considered relatively vulnerable.

266

Without effective anti-epidemic measures in these countries, cases of overseas imports

267

from China may soon occur. Figure 3 observes the relationship between each country’s

268

vulnerability and days taken for the first imported case to occur; they show a very high

269

exponential decreasing relationship. This result proves our argument and confirms that

270

the vulnerability index proposed by this study is very informative and can well express

271

the possibility and number of cases that may happen in the first stage for each country.

272

Although different countries' immediate epidemic prevention policies may affect this;

273

overall, the more vulnerable a country, the sooner its first overseas import case from

274

China would occur. Meanwhile, the lower the vulnerability, the later such a case would

275

occur.

276

In addition, we can observe the relationship between vulnerability and the cumulative

277

number of cases in each country as shown in Figure 4; this shows a clear linear

278

relationship. This is a dynamic process that changes daily with the number of

279

cumulative cases. Since the beginning of the outbreak in January 2020, various

280

countries’ governments have implemented related measures for epidemic prevention

281

such as reducing flights and stopping visas so that many countries with high

282

vulnerability can maintain a small number of cases. The countries below this regression

283

line—including Taiwan, Korea Republic, and Russia—can be regarded as countries

284

with excellent initial epidemic prevention work and Japan and the United States have

285

performed fairly well (unfortunately, Japan starting finding outbreak community

286

infections after this study was completed), whereas Singapore and Thailand are far

287

above the regression line with higher cases and may have higher risk in the future.

314

According to the spatiotemporal distribution results of different scenario simulations,

315

the conservative scenarios (Figure 7) assume that China has entered the start of its peak

316

period and the number of outbreak cases has started to decline. Therefore, the results of

317

simulations applied in other countries show that the cumulated case number increases

318

rapidly at the start for some countries, particularly for countries with higher

319

vulnerability. After one month, the epidemic was controlled and the number of cases in

320

each country no longer increased significantly. Meanwhile, considering the extreme,

321

high, medium, and low simulation levels of the epidemic scenarios in various countries,

322

it can also be seen that after a period of time, namely in April, the case number

323

differences between the scenarios will be clearly comparable. A1 extreme is the highest

324

scenario, followed by B1, C1, and D1. Meanwhile, severe scenarios (Figure 8) are

325

based on the trend that COVID-19 may be like traditional influenza for a global

326

pandemic; that is, cases will continue to occur, which may lead to >10,000 cases in

327

some countries. However, the general spatial distribution of case numbers is similar to

328

conservative scenarios. This scenario is still the same as that with the highest case

329

numbers in the A2 extreme scenario, followed by B2, C2, and D2.

330

Then, the risk calculation method combines hazard with vulnerability and population

331

density to calculate changes over time in the different scenarios of different countries

332

around the world over time to generate the COVID-19 dynamic risk map, as shown in

333

Figure 9. Here, we show some representative time slices only with scenario C2. For the

334

full time period 2020/1/21–2020/5/31 in the GIF animation format, please refer to

335

Supplementary Materials. Due to each country’s different vulnerability and population

336

density, the spatial distribution will differ slightly from the hazard maps show in

337

Figures 7 and 8. Some countries have higher risks because of their higher vulnerability

338

or population density. In particular, Asian countries near China have higher risk,

339

particularly East and Southeast Asia. Some other countries have gradually increased

340

their risks over time. For example, countries in Europe, Africa, and South America

341

started increasing their risks from March to April.

Discussion

362

This study proposes a framework for the dynamic risk analysis of novel coronavirus

363

SARS-CoV-2-infected pneumonia disease (COVID-19), attempts to understand the

364

impact of vulnerability, and uses this information to simulate the development of the

365

number of potential cases in different countries in the future. In addition, this study

366

compares and quantifies the initial epidemic prevention capabilities and various

367

countries’ management strategies. At present, this study focuses on the spread of risk

368

in space and time, which can be used as early-stage control when a novel infectious

369

disease breaks out. In the future, it should be possible to simulate the changes in the

370

number of recoveries or deaths at the same time to better understand the future risk

371

reduction process. Based on this framework, we can perform the next stage of

372

simulation, continuously modify the risk map, and dynamically update the analysis

373

results. However, there is currently no complete understanding of the characteristics of

374

COVID-19 around the world. There is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding when

375

the epidemic will reach its peak and it is unclear whether recovered patients are still

376

infectious.

377

Although the outbreak occurred in China, the epidemic is still in its initial stage for the

378

whole world. This study is a preliminary estimation and it can be assumed that COVID-

379

19 is not controlled by climatic factors or effective drugs. Moreover, many cases with

380

mild symptoms or even asymptomatic cases have appeared clinically, which has made

381

epidemic prevention and modeling very difficult. According to this study’s simulation

382

results, if there is no specific medicine, it will likely form a global pandemic.

383

Although in this study, we collected the proportion of evacuation charter infection cases

384

in various countries and estimated that the total number of cases in Hubei Province is

385

much larger than the actual official case number, we still adopt a more conservative

386

method that uses the official case number for risk assessment. This is based on the

387

assumption that countries are well-prepared for epidemic prevention. We believe that

388

countries have been prepared and have relevant experience for reference earlier than

389

the period when the Wuhan outbreak started. In the next stage, based on the research

390

framework, we can further superimpose the next outbreak on the global impact such as

391

the localized infection that happened in Singapore, and so on.

392

The other results of many statistical models will be greatly affected by adjusting the

393

parameters. At the start of an unknown infectious disease outbreak, it is impossible to

394

understand the actual parameters. For example, we have been unable to determine the

395

basic reproductive number, serial interval, etc. These will affect the model’s prediction

396

results and create difficulties in model prediction. In fact, we have also tried to use a

397

data-driven approach to make estimations using machine-learning or deep-learning

398

methods such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the Random Forest method.

399

However, the preliminary results are poor due to insufficient data and cannot be

400

effectively used for supervised learning.

401

After completing this study, it was also found that localized outbreaks in Japan and

402

Singapore had taken the lead, consistent with the vulnerability analysis and risk analysis

403

results in this study. Both Singapore and Japan were among the countries with the

404

highest risk in the simulation results. The first case also occurred in Egypt (risks signal

405

exist in the Egyptian part of the map as of February 20, 2020 in each scenario of Figures

406

7 and 8). This is consistent with the estimation results in this study.
