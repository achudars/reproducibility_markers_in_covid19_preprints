Abstract
The 2019-nCoV is reported to share the same entry (ACE2) as SARS-CoV
according to the updated findings. Analyzing the distribution and expression level of
the route of coronavirus may help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral
susceptibility and post-infection modulation. In this study, we found that the
expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was
not significantly different, suggesting relatively similar susceptibility. Besides, based
on the expression of ACE2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term
smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-nCoV. Analyzing the ACE2 in SARS-CoV
infected cells suggested that ACE2 was more than just a receptor but also participated
in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral
genome replication. Moreover, we also constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI)
networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cytokine secretion. Our
findings may explain the clinical symptoms so far and help clinicians and researchers
understand the pathogenesis and design therapeutic strategies for 2019-nCoV.

Introduction
In early December 2019, several cases of pneumonia with unknown causes were
reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China(1). Later, a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV was
identified based on sequencing of the patient respiratory tract samples. As of February
1, 2020, more than 10,000 confirmed patients and more than 15,000 suspected cases
were reported in China, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing
number internationally. Analyzing of the genome of 2019-nCoV showed that this new
virus shared around 80~90% sequence identity to SARS-CoV(2). Both bioinformatics
modeling and in vitro experiments indicated that 2019-nCoV was more likely to use
the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the entry receptor(3, 4). ACE2 is
previously known as the receptor for SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63(5, 6). Considering
the sequence of 2019-nCoV is similar to the SRAS-CoV and they are reported to
share the same molecular as the entry point, analyses of ACE2 expression and
distribution in lung and related biological processes may help us understand the
pathogenesis and design therapeutic strategies for 2019-nCoV. Recent advances in
bioinformatics enable researchers to reveal the underlying mechanisms of various
diseases. In this study, we used bioinformatics approaches to identify the ACE2
expression features in lung and mine associated regulating networks. These results
may help us understand the pathogenesis and design therapeutic strategies for
2019-nCoV.
Results
ACE2 expression features in lung
Among the 2019-nCoV infected patients, there are many patients with underlying
diseases, such as chronic respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it
is important to evaluate whether patients with underlying diseases are more
susceptible to coronavirus infection than healthy population. Firstly, we analyzed the
expression of ACE2 in lung in the different populations. The expression level of
ACE2 was not significantly altered between healthy populations and patients with
chronic respiratory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD)
and asthma (Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C, p-value > 0.05). It indicated that 2019-nCoV

could have the same ability to bind the respiratory tract epithelial cells of healthy
population and patients with chronic respiratory diseases through ACE2. Thus, there
may be no significant difference in the susceptibility of 2019-nCov infection between
healthy population and patients with chronic respiratory diseases.
Secondly, we found that the level of ACE2 expression was markedly upregulated in
long-term smokers (Figure 1D, p-value < 0.05). However, the p-value between
baseline and post-acute smoke exposure (ASE) group (24 hours after smoking 3
cigarettes) was 0.073 (Figure 1E). It was assumed that the long-term smoking could
elevate the expression of ACE2 and thus, increase the susceptibility to 2019-nCoV
infection.
Thirdly, we analyzed the expression of ACE2 in airway epithelial cells after being
infected with SARS-CoV. The result suggested that 24 hours after SARS-CoV
infection, the expression of ACE2 dramatically increased compared to 12 hours. After
48 hours, the expression of ACE2 remained at a high level. This indicated that ACE2
not only played a critical role in viral susceptibility but also may be involved in
post-infection regulation.
Biological function of ACE2 in coronavirus infection
To investigate the virus-related potential biological processes associated with
ACE2, we extracted the expression profiles of 15 healthy non-smokers from dataset
GSE89809 and divided them into two groups: high and low-expression level of ACE2.
We performed GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) and found that the expression
of ACE2 was mainly associated with innate and acquired immune responses,
regulation of B cell mediated immunity, cytokine and IL-1，IL-10，IL-6，IL-8
secretion (Figure 2A). Huang et al. reported that 2019-nCoV infected patients had
higher expression level of IL-1B, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, etc. (1). This implies that the
up-regulation of ACE2 could mediate the inflammatory responses which were
induced by above-mentioned cytokines. Moreover, higher expression of ACE2 could
prolong virus life cycle, enhance virus replication and mediate penetration of the virus
into the host cell.

To further explore whether above activities could be triggered after coronavirus
infection, we analyzed the expression profiles of epithelial cells which was infected
by SARS-CoV. The biological process scores were obtained using GSVA (Gene Set
Variation Analysis) and the pearson correlation between process scores and ACE2
expression was calculated. Similarly, while ACE2 increased after infection,
production of cytokines, IL-1, IL-10 and IL-6 also increased, and the regulation of B
cell activation was triggered to response. After 48 hours, virus activities such as viral
entry into the host cell, virus life cycle, and viral transcription were enhanced. Besides,
the T-cell cytokine secretion was increased, and T-cell activation was promoted
(Figure 2B). Then, we used ssGSEA (Single Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis)
to quantify the immune infiltrates in healthy people epithelial cells and cells after
infection. We found that in normal samples, the immune cells were not activated so
that the correlation between infiltration and ACE2 expression was not significant
(Figure 2C). However, in the SARS-CoV infected cells, the ACE2 was significantly
correlated with neutrophils, NK cells, Th17 cells, Th2 cells, Th1 cells, DC (Figure
2D).
Regulating networks after infection
Considering higher expression of ACE2 was involved in mediating inflammatory
responses, immune activities, and viral replication in both healthy individuals and
infected cells, we further explored protein-protein regulation network in viral
activity-related proteins and cytokine secretion, respectively. We extracted the viral
activity-associated and cytokine secretion-associated proteins from the Gene ontology
(GO) biological process gmt file. Construction of the Protein-protein interaction (PPI)
showed that these proteins were tightly interactive among each other and we here
exhibited the most significant PPI. In terms of viral activity, we found that “viral gene
expression” proteins such as RPS3, RPS8 and PRS25 were the most important genes
in the PPI network. In addition, VCP, LARP1, UBA52, PRKN, EIF3A and EIF3L
were also important in the network (Figure 3A). In terms of the cytokine secretion
associated proteins, we found that proteins such as SRC, FN1, MAPK3, LYN, MBP,
NLRC4, NLRP1 and PRKCD were Hub proteins in the regulating network of

cytokine secretion after coronavirus infection (Figure 3B), indicating that these
molecules were critically important in ACE2-induced inflammatory response.
Discussion
2019-nCoV infection in Wuhan is a serious public health problem. As the number
of cases has been increasing and the scope of infection has been expanding, people
keep a close eye on the future development of the epidemic. Based on the data of the
first 41 patients, the reduction of lymphocytes was a prominent feature of the
laboratory examination. The main symptoms of patients with 2019-nCoV infection
were interstitial changes in the lung according to the chest CT. Moreover, severe
pulmonary interstitial disease led to hypoxemia and type I respiratory distress, which
was related to the prognosis of patients. 2019-nCoV invades the lungs through the
respiratory tract and causes severe pneumonia, which is the main pathogenesis mode.
It was found that 2019-nCoV was able to bind to ACE2 receptor on the surface of
epithelial cells. At the beginning of the outbreak, Dong N et al. calculated and
simulated that 2019-nCoV may have the same ACE2 receptor as SARS, although its
binding ability to ACE2 was weaker than SARS. Zhou P et at. further confirmed that
ACE2 was necessary for the cells infected by 2019-nCoV(4). In this study, six
independent studies (GSE37758, GSE73395, GSE89809, GSE63127, GSE97010, and
GSE14700) were analyzed, covering healthy population, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease patients, bronchial asthma patients and smoking patients. The
samples included lung tissue, BALF, airway epithelial cells, small airway epithelial
cells and coronavirus infected epithelial cells. We showed that ACE2 was found in all
of the samples including healthy population and patients with chronic airway diseases.
It revealed that there was no significant difference in the susceptibility of 2019-nCoV
between healthy population and patients with chronic airway diseases. The expression
of ACE2 was up-regulated in smokers, suggesting that smoking may increase the
susceptibility of new coronavirus. Further analysis showed that the expression of
ACE2 could be up-regulated by SARS coronavirus infection.
Previous studies have found that ACE2 was related to the severity of acute
respiratory syndrome induced by coronavirus infection, which regulated the

production of acute respiratory distress syndrome-associated cytokines(7). ACE2 is
also related to adaptive immune responses(8). In this current study, the GSEA analysis
showed that the high expression of ACE2 was related to innate immune response,
acquired immune response, B cell regulatory immunity and cytokine secretion, and
enhanced the inflammatory response induced by IL-1, IL-10, IL-6, IL-8 cytokines. We
speculated that the immune system dysfunction involved in the high expression of
ACE2 was related to the symptoms called cytokine storm. The clinical study in
Wuhan pointed that the levels of IL-1B, IL-10 and IL-8 were significantly increased
in critically ill patients with new coronavirus infection, indicating that there was
cytokine mediated inflammatory responses in patients with coronavirus infection(9).
At the same time, our results also showed that the high expression of ACE2 increased
the expression of genes involved in viral replication, which was beneficial for the
virus to enter the host cells. These gene enrichments were consistent with those of the
epithelial cells infected by coronavirus. It suggested that the transcriptome of
epithelial cells was altered after the infection of coronavirus though the regulation of
ACE2, which was beneficial to the replication and assembly of virus, and also to the
entry of virus into host cells. Meanwhile, T cell activation and inflammatory response
mediated by T cell factors were significantly induced by the alteration of
transcriptome as well.
It was speculated that the increased levels of IL1B, IFN γ, IP10, and MCP1 in
patients infected with new coronavirus were linked to the activation of T-helper-1
(Th1) cell responses(9). However, there is a lack of pathological data of lung tissue
infected with new coronavirus. Through ssGSEA analysis, we found the correlation
between ACE2 and immune cell infiltration. The results showed that the high
expression of ACE2 in lung tissue was beneficial to induce cytotoxic reaction,
neutrophil inflammation and Th2-dominated immune response. Moreover, the
expression of ACE2 was in a time-dependent manner after the virus infection. In the
meantime, ACE2 mediated the activations of neutrophils, NK cells, Th17 cells, Th2
cells, Th1 cells, DC cells, TNF - α secreting cells, which induced more serious
inflammatory response.

In order to further analyze the core genes involved in viral replication and
inflammatory response mediated by ACE2, we constructed a protein-protein
interaction network. It was found that RPS3 played a key role in viral replication, and
SRC non-receptor protein kinase was the hub gene in inflammatory response. It has
been shown that RPS3 plays an important role in cell mitosis by interacting with α tubulin. When cells are infected with HIV-1, HIV-1 Tat protein can interact with RPS3
to disturb its localization on the spindle, and ultimately inhibit cell proliferation(10).
Moreover, the function of RPS3 depends on its own nuclear translocation, which is
regulated by protein kinase like SRC(11). We speculated that the increased expression
of ACE2 affected RPS3 and SRC, which were the two hub genes involved in viral
replication and inflammatory response.
In conclusion, 2019-nCoV infection is a serious public health problem, endangers
human health seriously. Due to the strong human to human infectivity, it needs to be
further studied. Our current study found that there was no significant difference in
ACE2 expression between healthy population and patients with chronic airway
disease. The activations of neutrophils, NK cells, Th17 cells, Th2 cells, Th1 cells, DC
cells, TNF - α secreting cells were induced by overexpression of ACE2, which
participate in the production of more obvious inflammatory response. A schematic
model was showed in figure 4. These findings may help clinicians and researchers
gain more insights of pathogenesis and design therapeutic strategies for 2019-nCoV.
Note all results are based on data mining, thus, further experiments are needed.
