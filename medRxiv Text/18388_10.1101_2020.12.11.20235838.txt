Abstract:

33

Introduction. An effective vaccine for COVID-19 is only of value if the public has confidence

34

in taking it. There is little data on COVID-19-specific vaccine confidence or its determinants in

35

the United States. The objective of this study was to determine public confidence in a COVID-19

36

vaccine.

37

Methods. A cross-sectional survey of Pennsylvanian adults, August-October, 2020, to identify

38

their likelihood of taking an approved, no-cost coronavirus vaccine, general vaccine acceptance,

39

and sociodemographic traits to identify predictors of vaccine acceptance.

40

Results. Of the 950 respondents, 55% were “very likely”, 20% “somewhat likely”, 14%

41

“unsure”, 4% “somewhat unlikely”, and 7% “very unlikely” to take a coronavirus vaccine, even

42

though 70% had taken the flu vaccine since September 2019. The strongest predictors of vaccine

43

acceptance were trust in the system evaluating vaccines and perceptions of local COVID-19

44

vaccination norms. The strongest predictors of negative vaccine intentions were worries about

45

unknown side-effects and positive attitudes toward natural infection. Sociodemographic factors,

46

political views, and religiosity did not predict vaccine intentions.

47

Conclusions. Fewer adults intend to take a coronavirus vaccine than currently take the flu

48

vaccine. To overcome coronavirus vaccine hesitancy, information campaigns to reinforce

49

positive predictors and overcome negative predictors are indicated.

INTRODUCTION

51

An effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to stop the spread of COVID-19 is only of value if the public

52

has confidence in taking it.1 Concerns about public refusal to accept a COVID-19 vaccine are

53

widespread2 and have raised calls for drastic measures to ensure public confidence in COVID-19

54

vaccines developed.3 Pre-COVID-19, the most important determinants of vaccine uptake

55

globally were confidence in vaccines and trust in health-care workers, with lesser variations in

56

confidence by science education, age, and gender, and little variation by income or religion.4

57
58

There is little data on COVID-19-specific vaccine confidence or its determinants in the United

59

States (U.S.). A survey of 672 U.S. adults in May, 2020, found 67% would accept a COVID-19

60

vaccine, with variations in confidence by demographic status.5 A July, 2020 survey of 1,971 U.S.

61

adults found associations between probability of choosing a COVID-19 vaccine and perceived

62

vaccine efficacy, side effect profile, which institution endorsed it, and the national origin of the

63

vaccine.6 A more recent public poll in September, 2020, found only 51% of U.S. adults would

64

definitely or probably get a COVID-19 vaccine – down from 72% from the same poll in May,

65

2020.7 That poll identified safety concerns as a primary reason for hesitancy, including concerns

66

about both the development process and approval process of a COVID-19 vaccine, and also

67

found differences in acceptance by race, ethnicity, and political affiliation.7

68
69

This drop in intended vaccine uptake is concerning and may represent a shift in positive and

70

negative predictors of vaccine confidence. The objective of this study was to explore COVID-19

71

vaccine confidence in light of these apparent changes.

METHODS

73

Population

74

This manuscript reports data from a longitudinal cohort survey at time 1, administered either

75

online or by telephone, of adults in Centre County, Pennsylvania (PA), collected between August

76

and October, 2020. Centre County, PA has approximately 150,000 permanent residents, with an

77

academic year increase in population of approximately 40,000 undergraduate students enrolled to

78

the Pennsylvania State University, University Park campus. Participants were recruited between

79

May and September, 2020 through employers, local government, news coverage and word-of-

80

mouth, with eligibility requirements of age 18 years or older and residence in Centre County,

81

PA. Of 1,590 overall enrollees, 986 were invited to complete this survey, and 950 completed it

82

(96% completion rate; no missing data). This study was approved by the Pennsylvania State

83

University IRB.

84

Measures

85

Our primary outcome was COVID-19 vaccination intention. Participants answered, “If an FDA-

86

approved vaccine to prevent COVID-19 were available today at no cost to you, how likely would

87

you be to get vaccinated?” on a 5-point scale (1=very unlikely, 5=very likely).

88
89

Independent variables included vaccination attitudes, norms, efficacy, and past behavior.8

90

Positive attitudes toward vaccination (3 items; α=.77) and immunity through natural infection

91

(versus vaccination) (3 items; α=.77) were measured on a 5-point scale (1=strong disagree,

92

5=strongly agree). Perceived vaccine uptake norms were measured by asking participants to

93

estimate what percentage of people living in the county would get the coronavirus vaccine (1

94

item, 0-20%; 21-40%; 41-60%; 61-80%, 81-100%). Efficacy was measured by asking

95

participants if they worry about unknown side-effects of vaccines (1 item, 1=strong disagree,

96

5=strongly agree). Past behavior was measured by asking participants whether they received a

97

flu vaccine since September 1, 2019 (yes, no, wanted to get the flu vaccine, but were unable to

98

for medical reasons; for regression analysis, the latter categories were combined).

99
100

Trust has also been associated with vaccine intentions and behaviors, and was measured as

101

whether the respondent trusts the current system for evaluating the safety of coronavirus

102

vaccines (1 item, 1=strong disagree, 5=strongly agree), and general vaccine cynicism (2 items, r

103

= .63, p<.001; e.g., Authorities promote vaccination for financial gain, not for people's health).

104

Sociodemographic variables of education, financial standing, political viewpoint (1=very

105

conservative, 7=very liberal), and religiosity were also measured.

106

Statistical Analysis

107

Descriptive statistics were used to describe quantitative data. Multivariate ordinal regression was

108

used to model predictors of vaccine intention. Statistical analysis was completed using SPSS

109

statistical software version 25.

110

RESULTS

111

The 950 respondents were characteristically middle age (49 years, SD= 16.32), highly educated

112

(87% Bachelor’s degree or higher), employed (74%), non-Hispanic (95%), Caucasian (94%),

113

women (68%).

115

Just over half (55%) reported that they are “very likely,” to take a coronavirus vaccine, while

116

20% are “somewhat likely,” 14% are “unsure,” 4% are “somewhat unlikely,” and 7% are “very

117

unlikely” to take a coronavirus vaccine, even though 70% had taken the flu vaccine this season.

118
119

Multivariate ordinal regression was used to evaluate predictors of vaccine intention (Table 1).

120

The strongest predictors of positive vaccine intentions were trust in the vaccine and perceived

121

county COVID-19 vaccination norms; positive attitudes toward vaccines generally and having

122

received the flu vaccine last year were lesser positive predictors. The strongest predictor of

123

negative vaccine intention, by far, was worries about unknown side-effects; positive attitudes

124

toward natural infection (over vaccination) was a lesser negative predictor. Sociodemographic

125

status, political views, and religiosity did not predict vaccine intentions.

126
127

Free-text participant responses were used to illustrate quantitative results.

128

DISCUSSION

129

Our data identify a difference between confidence in vaccines in general and confidence in a

130

COVID-19 vaccine, which stems from a primary distrust in the system evaluating the

131

coronavirus vaccine. Free-text responses suggest that those unlikely to take a COVID-19 vaccine

132

are worried that the speed of development indicates a lack of integrity in developing the vaccine,

133

and that politicization of oversight agencies reduces their trustworthiness. This differs from

134

general pre-COVID vaccine hesitancy, which primarily stemmed from negative vaccine beliefs,

135

largely based on misconceptions.9 Whereas, historically, the primary emphasis for overcoming

136

vaccine hesitancy was to overcome misconceptions, for COVID-19, these data suggest the

137

primary emphasis must be on reassuring the public that the integrity of the system for evaluating

138

the vaccine was maintained. This confirms public polling showing distrust in both the

139

development and approval process for the coronavirus vaccine,7 and supports prior editorial

140

recommendations for instituting a policy of radical transparency in the COVID-19 vaccine

141

development process.3

142

Limitations

143

Limitations to our study include that it is a single point in a cohort study; results at this time may

144

not be generalizable over time. It is also limited by its narrow population sample, which was

145

primarily well educated, Caucasian females.

146
147

Strengths of our study include a large sample size compared to prior US COVID-19 studies and

148

timeliness. Capturing intent closer to the potential time of COVID-19 vaccine release is more

149

likely to reflect actual uptake than older studies.

150
151

While further research is needed to confirm the generalizability of our results, given their

152

concordance with the national Pew sample,7 it is highly likely that fewer US adults intend to take

153

a coronavirus vaccine than currently take the flu vaccine. Further, given changes in positive and

154

negative predictors, to overcome coronavirus vaccine hesitancy, practices, campaigns and

155

policies may need to focus on reinforcing vaccine safety and development integrity over more

156

general historic concerns.

Conclusions

159

These results are directly relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. Changing COVID-19 vaccine

160

uptake intent and predictors of intent warrants changes to how COVID-19 public health

161

vaccination campaigns are designed. For messages and messengers to effectively reinforce

162

public uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine, they must emphasize the safety of the vaccine and the

163

integrity of the vaccine development process as priorities.
