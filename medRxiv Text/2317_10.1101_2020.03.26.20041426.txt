Abstract Purpose To investigate the epidemiology and clinical features of discharged adult
patients with coronavirus infection disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Yichang.

Method The

retrospective study recruited 197 cases of COVID-19 discharged from Yichang Central People’s
Hospital and Yichang Third People’s Hospital from Jan 17 to Feb 26, 2020. All cases were confirmed
by real-time RT-PCR or chest computer tomography (CT). The survivors were followed up until
March 4,2020. Clinical data, including demographic characteristic, presentation, underlying illness,
exposure history, laboratory examination, radiology and prognosis were enrolled and analyzed by
SPSS 19.0 software. Results There were 197 adult discharged patients with COVID-19 in this study.
Statistical analysis indicated that the average age was 55.94 years,

and female patients were

99(50.3%).Those patients mainly resided in urban with exposure history in 2 weeks, while 7
medical staffs were infected. Fever (77.6%%), cough (43.6%) and weakness (14.7%) were the common
symptoms. Leukocytes were

mainly

normal

or

decreased

in

185

patients (92.9%), both

lymphocytes and eosinophils were below normal range, the ratios were 56.9% and 50.3%,
respectively. On the contrary, lactate dehydrogenases raised in 65 patients. C-reactive protein (72.4%)
elevated in the most of patients. The sensitivity of RT-PCR was 63.5%. Chest CT indicated that
bilateral patchy shadows (69.0%) were the most

common imaging manifestations.169(85.8%)

patients recovered and transferred to a designated hospital for observation, and the others (14.2%)
turned worst and died of acute respiratory failure. Conclusion COVID-19 infection with highly
contagious have become a life-threaten public healthy problem, the sensitivity of RT-PCR was limited.
Chest CT scan was recommended for the suspected patients. Furthermore, lymphocytopenia and
eosinophils declining without leukocytes increasing may be considered as a useful evidence for the
diagnosis.

Introduction
Since several cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia was reported in
Wuhan[1].This disease was identified by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC)
On January 3, 2020. And then was named as COVID-19 by WHO [2]. At the end of January, this disease
spread rapidly to other cities of adjacent to Wuhan in Hubei province, including Huanggang, Xiaogan,
Jingzhou and Yichang. Yichang, the 2nd largest city with Three Gorges Dam in Hubei province, was
about 300 kilometers far away from Wuhan, and many residents who worked or studied at Wuhan,
returned to hometown for Spring Festival. By March 4, 2020, official reported there was 931 confirmed
cases with COVID-19 in Yichang.

Similar to the server acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory (MERS),
2019-nCoV can also cause serve acute respiratory syndrome

[3].

Numerous patients can be cured

effectively at the early stage, but some patients with COVID-19 may develop pulmonary edema, ARDS,
or multiple organ failure, and even died abruptly

[4]

. Currently, researches about epidemiology and

clinical features of COVID-19 focused on the hospitalized patients

[5]

, but the discharged patients was

still scarcely investigate. Therefore, this study was aimed to clarify the epidemiology and clinical
features of discharged patients with COVID-19.
Methods
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Yichang Central people’s hospital. All adult
discharged patients with COVID-19 from Yichang Central People’s Hospital and Yichang third
People’s Hospital from Jan 17 to Feb 26, 2020. Those patients with exposure histories

were

confirmed by chest CT scans or RT-PCR assays. Throat•swab or broncholveolr lvge fluid sample
were collected from all the suspected patients at admission, and RT-PCR assays were performed at
clinical laboratory. According to the 5th edition expert conference of Chinese healthy commission,
those suspected patients presenting with lung imaging features also regard as clinically diagnosis- cases
in Hubei province. ARDS was identified in accordance with the Berlin definition
kidney injury was verified according to Improve Global Outcome definition

[7]

[6]

, and acute

. If the serum levels

of

cardiac biomarkers ascended to the 99th percentile upper reference limit or new abnormalities were
displayed in echocardiography or electrocardiography (ECG), the patient was regarded as acute
cardiac injury. The discharged criteria included that symptom disappeared and the lesions eliminated
evidently in the chest CT. Furthermore, RT-PCR was negative continual 2 tests beyond 24 hours.
After discharged from hospital, the patients went to the designated hospital for observation. All
patients except deaths were monitored up to March 4, 2020.

Statistical Analysis
Clinical data, including date, ages, occupation, location, presentation, underlying diseases,
laboratory test, RT-PCR ， chest CT, treatment and outcome was collected from
electronic medical record(EMR) . If data was missing, we collected by direct communication with
attending doctor. Then the data was inputted and analyzed by SPSS 19.0 software.
Descriptive statistics were presented as median with interquartile range or frequency with percentage.
Results
Epidemiology of COVID-19 patients in Yichang
A total of 197 adult discharged patients with COVID-19 were recruited in Yichang Central
People’s Hospital（101, 51.3%）and Yichang third people's hospital（86，48.7%）.The first cases was
a 65-years old woman from Wuhan on January15, 2020. The quantity of admitted patients increased
sharply on the 15 days later, ascended to the peak on the February 2, and decreased obviously on
Februray 7 (See the Figure1).
The average age of discharged patients was 55.94±18.83 (IQR, 40.25-70.75) years, and percentage
of 49.7 (98) was female. Those cases were mainly occurred in the urban (178, 90.4%), especially
Xiling District, because numerous patients were employees of China Gezhouba Group
Corporation (CCGC) returning from Wuhan. Except for seven medical staffs, most of them were
employees (58, 29.4%), retirees (55, 27.4%), and agriculture workers (29, 14.7%). A total of
187 patients were clustered and had clear exposure histories. Among of them, 75(38.7%)
patients resided in the community of COVID-19 patients, 71(36.8%) patients had ever contacted with

relatives or friends from Wuhan, 41(20.8%) patients had a trip to Wuhan.

Clinical features of adult discharged patients with COVID-19
Fever (153, 77.6%) was the most common presentations, following cough (89, 45.2%) and
weakness (29, 14.7%), respectively. Other less common symptoms were sore throat (11, 5.6%),
shortness of breath (10, 5.1%), and muscle ache (9, 4.6%, Table 2). However, 3 patients without any
complaints were detected by chest CT scan. Among all those patients, the average days from exposure
to symptom onset was 6.14±9.27days. The longest incubation period was 55 days. 48 patients were
accompanied with underlaying illness, including cardiovascular (24.4%) and cerebrovascular
diseases
(4.6%),
endocrine
system
diseases
(9.1%),
chronic
renal
disease
(1.5%), malignant tumor(1.5%), and digestive system diseases (1.0%), nervous system diseases.
Considering vital sign and CT manifestations, 56 patients were admitted to intensive cure
unite （ICU）, and 141 patients were transferred to general isolation wards.
Laboratory examinations of adult discharged patients with COVID-19
The laboratory examination was underwent after admission, the blood routine results
revealed that monocytes and platelet kept at normal range in numerous patients, leukocytes were
at the normal range in 117 (59.4%) patients, and below the normal range in 66 (33.5%) patients.
While lymphocytes decreased in many patients. Interestingly, eosinophils displayed a similar
change tendency as lymphocytes, it decreased obviously over half of them. 44 (22.3%) patients had
different degrees of liver function abnormality, with elevating of aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
or alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Total bilirubin (TBIL) was above the normal range in
24(12.2%) patients, and direct bilirubin (DBIL) was above in 10 (5.1%) patient. Most of those
patients had a abnormal myocardial zymogram, which indicated that creatine kinase was above in
10 (5.1%) patients, creatine kinase MB in 19 (9.6%) patients, and lactate dehydrogenase in
65(33.0%) patients. For the coagulation tests, prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial
thromboplastin time (APTT) were at the normal range in the majority of patients, while fibrinogen was
above the normal range in the 78 (39.6%) patients. D-dimmer was above the normal range in the 99
(47.2%) patients. 65 (33.0%) patients had different degrees of renal function damage, with elevating
blood urea nitrogen or creatinine. Blood gas analysis was examined in 69 cases, and the results
demonstrated that PaO2 was decreased in the 28(40.5%) patients. Regarding the infection index,
procalcitonin(PCT) mainly kept at the normal range. On the contrary, c-reative protein (CRP),
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) increased in most of patients.

sensitivity was limited. RT-PCR positive rate was 63.5%, the first test was 46.7%, and
the second test was 11.2%. Comparing with PCR , almost all patients had been

To avoid to hypoxemia and acute respiratory distress,(ARDS) 147(76.6%) patients received
oxygen by nasal catheter, 34(15.3%) patients received oxygen by mask, and 16 (8.1%)
patients were treated with invasive ventilation in the ICU. Common complications among the
197 discharged patients included acute liver injury , septic shock, acute myocardial injury, acute renal

injury and ARDS. Most patients were treated with antiviral drugs (Oseltamivir), 151(76.6%)
patients received antibiotics(moxifloxacin and cefperazone-sulbactam), and several patients were
treated with glucocorticoids (75, 38.1%) and immunoglobulin(52, 26.9%). Additionally, 81(41.1%)
patients were treated with Chinese traditional medicine. By the end of Febururay 26, 28 (14.2%)
patients had died, and 169(85.2%) patient was discharged and transferred to designated hospital for
observation. The average of hospital stay was 15.08 days (Table 4).

Discussion
Coronavirus was a large RNA virus, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may induce sever respiratory
syndrome, but the remains only caused mild upper respiratory infectious.2019-nCoV
was a new subtype, with high incidence and rapid infection, it has spread widely in China and
abroad, involving Italy, German, Korean, Iran, and Japan [8-9]. At present, there was no vaccine
and antiviral drugs against this disease. Therefore, Extensive studies of clinical features on
COVID-19 have not only a better understanding of coronavirus transmission,but have also
been key to detect quickly and accurately.
COVID-19 diagnosis was based on exposure histories, symptoms, laboratory tests, chest CT and
RT-PCR. In the early phase of the epidemic, almost all patients worked at or lived around the
Huanan Seafood Whole Market in Wuhan [10]. With COVID-19 spread rapidly in Hubei province,
Wuhan-related exposures was regarded as a key criterion. Previous retrospective research
demonstrated that 86% cases had a Wuhan-related exposures history[11]. Similarly, our study
revealed most of infected patients lived around Xiling strict, because of many residents working at
China Gezhouba Group Corporation, returning from Wuhan. The common symptoms of COVID-19
patients were fever, fatigue and cough, some patients may present with abdominal symptoms
[12]
. While a few patients without any symptoms were detected accidentally by chest CT
[11]
.Thus, it is difficult to suspect the disease without auxiliary examinations.
The significant of laboratory examinations was blood routine, the results suggested
leukocytes were mainly normal or decreased, and lymphocytes reduced evidently in many COVID19 patients [13]. A recent research indicated that lymphocytes,especially CD3+ lymphocytes and
CD45+ lymphocytes, decreased significantly in comparison with non-COVID patients, while
there was no significantly difference in quantities and proportions of neutrophils and
monocytes[14].Results of this analysis showed lymphocytes and eostinophils decreased obviously
without leukocytes increasing in most patients, and neutrophils,monocytes and platelet mainly
kept at normal range,it was consistent with previous reports. In term of chest CT, the typical image
features were peripheral, subpleural ground glass opacities in the lower lobes. However, a study of
CT manifestations demonstrated that it was approximately 14% COVID-19 patients with atypical
CT features [15]. Real time RT-PCR was considered a standard assessment for COVID-19，but
the sensitivity was lower than chest CT scans, RT-PCR was 71%, chest CT scans reached
98%[16].Thus, it was essential to perform chest CT for detecting the suspected patients.
As described before, there was currently no clinical approved antiviral drugs and vaccine for
coronavirus infections except for supportive treatment [17]. Immunoglobulin may enhance the

ability of anti-infection in severely ill patient, and steroids are considered in those patients with
ARDS. Oxygen inhalation was important to avoid to ARDS for the COVID-19 patients with
hypoxemia. In this study, 76.6% patients received oxygen by nasal catheter, and 90% received
antiviral therapy, and 38.1% received glucocorticoids. CDC reported that the case-fatality rate
(CFR) of COVID-19 the overall case--fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 was 2.3% in confirmed
cases, and CFR among critical cases may reach 49.0% [11]. Nevertheless, most of patients were
still treated in the hospital. Another retrospective study suggest the CFR was about 11% [13].
Statistical analysis of this study found that the CFR was 14.2%, and most of them were over 70
year-old patients accompanying with chronic illness. In the past one month, numerous effective
measures, including blocking cities and roads, closing supermarket, monitoring temperature,
building a new hospital and setting up medical assistance team, have been carried out to
controlling infection source, preventing transmission and reducing death. Until now, there was
no new confirmed patients for 13 days,and hospitalized patients decreased sharply.
In conclusion, this retrospective study, based on clinical data, revealed that COIVD-19
mainly infected in older people with comorbidities, and may cause acute severe respiratory
syndrome.Chest CT was key to screen those suspected patients, and lymphocytopenia and
eosnophils declining without leukocytes increasing may be regarded as an novel evidence in
the dignosis of COVID-19.
