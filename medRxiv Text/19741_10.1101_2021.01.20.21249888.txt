Support needs of people living with diabetes during COVID-19

ABSTRACT
Background
The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic has radically compromised healthcare for people living with
chronic conditions such as diabetes. Government-imposed restrictions to contain the spread of the
virus has forced people to suddenly adjust their lifestyle. This study aimed to capture the impact of
the pandemic on people living with diabetes and the views of these individuals on ways in which the
information, advice and support they are receiving could be improved.

Research design and methods
An online anonymous survey was distributed across the UK during the first lockdown and initial
easing. The survey comprised questions about confidence in diabetes self-management, resources
used to obtain information, advice and support, and opinions on how these could be improved.
Open-ended captured subjective experiences.

Results
The survey was completed by 773 adults living with diabetes (69.2% type 1, 28.5% type 2). There
was notable

variability in the impact of the pandemic on confidence in self-management, with

confidence having deteriorated most commonly in the ability to take care of own mental wellbeing
(37.0%

respondents)

and

improved

most

commonly

in

maintaining

a

healthy

weight

(21.1%

respondents). 41.2% of respondents living alone reported not receiving any outside support. The
quality of information, advice and support received from the healthcare team was rated poorly by
37.2%. Respondents sought greater communication and tailored advice from their care team, clear
and consistent information from the government and news channels, and improved understanding
of diabetes and its challenges from their personal networks and employers.

Conclusion
Adjusting to the COVID-19 pandemic has strained the mental health and wellbeing of people living
with diabetes. Diabetes care teams must receive assistance to support these individuals without
risking further inequalities in access to healthcare. Equipping personal networks and employers with
knowledge on diabetes and skills to support self-management may reduce the burden on the NHS.

Significance of this study
1. What is already known about this subject?
• The COVID-19 pandemic has posed multiple

challenges to the everyday life of people

across the world.

•

People living with diabetes mellitus, particularly those with poor blood glucose are
more vulnerable to developing the severe outcomes of COVID-19.

•

NHS prioritisation of COVID-19 has disrupted the availability of care for patients with
chronic health conditions, including diabetes mellitus.

Support needs of people living with diabetes during COVID-19

INTRODUCTION
The

coronavirus

COVID-19

is

a

severe

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On the 30

th

respiratory

syndrome

generated

by

infection

by

SARS

of January 2020, the WHO Emergency Committee declared

COVID-19 a global health emergency[1], with approximately 41.77 million cases and 1.14 million
deaths

due

to

COVID-19

recorded

worldwide

within

the

first

10

months

(https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). To contain the spread of the virus and protect the impact
on the UK National Health Service (NHS), on the 23

d

of March 2020 the UK government imposed a

national lockdown and the prioritisation of COVID-19 patients across the NHS[2]. From June 1

st

Though

2020,
these

measures have been useful for flattening the rate of infection, they have caused severe disruption in
the

lives

of

people

across

the

population[3,4],

and

in

particular

patient

groups

who

rely

on

healthcare services[5].

For people living with diabetes, COVID-19 prioritisation in the NHS caused severe disruptions to
healthcare provision available. Effects include the cancellation of routine check-up appointments
(e.g. HbA1c and retinopathy checks), diabetes education sessions, and hospital services for nonurgent care. Additionally, support systems such as face-to-face peer support was suspended while
digitally

solutions

were

accelerated[6].

As

the

pandemic

persists,

NHS

England

has

published new guidelines encouraging a shift towards remote consultations whenever possible, the
use of a case-by-case approach to evaluate the need for face-to-face reviews, and encouraging the
uptake of digital self-management tools[7]. In addition to practical challenges in rolling out these
guidelines across the NHS, the success of these changes in care delivery rely on patients’ ability to
adapt and engage in technology-assisted self-care, as well as practitioners’ ability to interpret data
from technology and their confidence in delivering care via remote consultations[8–10].

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
An online survey was developed by the NIHR Bristol Biomedical Research Centre in collaboration
with the Diabetes UK South West team. The first draft of the survey was developed based on
questions posted on the Diabetes UK forum, Facebook diabetes support groups, and discussions
with diabetes support teams (e.g. Diabetes UK, Brigstowe) between the 1

st

of April 2020 and 15

into the pre-existing multiple-choice options (e.g. “leaving the house only for exercise” was classified
as ‘adhering to physical/social distancing guidelines’). Open-ended questions were analysed using an

approach.

The

development of a definitive coding framework by which all responses were coded. Analysis was
carried out using the NVivo V.12 software package.

Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Bristol faculty research ethics committee (ref:
103163).

RESULTS
A total of 773 people living with diabetes responded to the survey. (a further 79 participants were
parents, partners, or carers of someone with diabetes). Though respondents were widely distributed
across the UK, most came from the South East (n = 193) and South West (n = 142) regions of England.

Demographic characteristics
Table 1 presents a breakdown of the demographic characteristics of respondents. Most were female
(67.1%) and of white British ethnicity (90.1%). Mean age was of 47.9 (SD = 14.5, range 18 to 80)
years. 69.2% of respondents reported living with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), 28.5% with type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Most respondents had not experienced symptoms of COVID-19 since the
start of the pandemic (80.6%). The most common symptoms reported were coughing, shortness of
breath, and fever. 66.8% of respondents were adhering to government social/physical distancing
guidelines stipulated at the time of survey completion, 9.8% were voluntarily shielding despite not
having received explicit instructions.

Confidence in diabetes self-management.
Confidence in self-management was impacted more notably in the lifestyle components of diabetes
self-management (e.g. regular physical activity, healthy eating and maintenance of a healthy weight),
and mental well-being (Figure 1). Change in confidence was mainly negative (poorer), particularly for
mental

well-being

(37%

showed

a

decrease),

though

a

proportion

of

respondents

displayed

improvements.

From the analysis, we identified three main themes on improving confidence in diabetes selfmanagement: increased accessibility, adjusting self-care, and receipt of external support.

Accessibility
Respondents indicated needing greater access to their care team and the support provided for
diabetes self-management, greater opportunities for physical activity, and easier access to the food
they need to adhere to dietary recommendations:

“Lockdown limited exercise which I rely on to control sugar levels. Readjustment of insulin due to my
exercise is not straight forward”

Several respondents indicated that receipt of blood glucose monitoring tools would have facilitated
diabetes self-management:

Support needs of people living with diabetes during COVID-19

“Getting CGM on prescription”

Further, access to clearer guidance on individual risk was deemed important to facilitate decisionmaking:

“Preparation guides for how to manage sugar levels if you get coronavirus. Also guidelines on how
to stay vigilant as a diabetic when carrying out daily activities”

Adjusting self-care
Respondents described the need to adopt strategies that would help them adjust diabetes
management. They were aware that unhealthy habits may be attributed to not having adapted to
their new circumstances generated by the pandemic:

“Dietary changes! Being less busy and at home more has meant a diet which is not so good for
people with diabetes!”

Respondents recognised the need to increase focus on mental health to reduce stress-induced
glucose alterations:

“My blood sugars have been more erratic due to the stress and worry for myself and my family, and
they have been harder to keep under control.”

Further, respondents recognised that this might require changes in doses or type of medication:

“Reminders about changing insulin doses (via pump) in response to lower levels of physical activity.”

External support
Need for assistance from personal network and wider community was deemed important to
increase confidence. This included support from family and friends, greater adherence to physical
distancing from others, and help in household tasks and childcare:

“Lack of help with childcare means difficulty in exercising and more strain at home, so sugars are
harder to look after.”

Outside of these three factors, several respondents indicated that resumption of ‘normal’ life would
be needed:

“Once things get back to normal and I can get back to my routine”

Consequences of cancelled appointments
51.9% of respondents had at least one appointment cancelled at the time of survey completion. The
impact was represented by four themes: lack of knowledge and confidence, difficulties in switching
treatment, mental health, and empowerment in self-management:

Lack of knowledge and confidence

Support needs of people living with diabetes during COVID-19

Cancellation of appointments resulted in uncertainty on glucose control, difficulties in interpreting
information provided by monitoring devices, and lack of confidence in the actions to take to improve
glucose control:

“My

self-confidence

has

plunged,

and

lack

of

follow-up

hasn’t

helped.

The

clinic

cancelled

appointments and I didn’t know who else to consult.”

“I have pretty much given up on self-management. I don’t know where I am in terms of my Hba1c so
don’t know where I need to be heading.”

Difficulties in switching treatment
Respondents indicated struggling to switch to other medications or changing doses and receiving
adequate support to do so. They have had difficulties in using remote medical care, and experienced
delayed or cancelled referrals to other services:

“I was on a pathway of improving my treatment methods (a pump) but that has been paused”

Mental health
Reduced

support

and

advice

regarding

self-management

or

risk,

and

the

cancellation

of

appointments was posing a strain on respondents’ mental health and motivation to continue selfmanagement:

“Although I don’t feel less able to self-manage, I have sometimes felt less motivated to manage my
diabetes well. A result of general anxiety and poor sleep.”

Empowerment in self-management
A few respondents indicated that they had managed to adapt to circumstances to improve selfmanagement:

“I have had to learn to cope and have read more and joined a Facebook diabetes support group, run
by other diabetics”

Ease of access to information, advice and support
Respondents found it harder to receive support compared to information and advice. Access was
more likely to be rated as ‘difficult’ or ‘very difficult’ in the domains ‘emotional wellbeing’ and
‘diabetes management if showing symptoms of COVID-19’ (Figure 2). There were clear differences
between diabetes types in access to support: 42.5% of respondents with T2DM reported ‘difficult’ or
‘very difficult’ access to support for glucose control, compared to 28.9% of respondents with T1DM.
Further details are in Supplementary File 2. Among those respondents who reported living alone,
41.2% indicated that they were not receiving support from outside the household. External support
was received primarily from the family (68.7%), friends (67.2%) and neighbours (28.4%).

ratings were poorer from T2DM (43.2%) compared to T1DM respondents (35.2%).

according to source queried. From analysis, overarching themes were revealed: greater transparency,
higher quality information and improved contact, and greater understanding of the condition.

Respondents

expressed

concerns

regarding

in

the

information from the government, news channels and social media:

“They over emphasise the negatives and cause fear or anxiety.” (News Channels)

They requested these sources be more transparent in the evidence behind information and decisionmaking, greater fact-checking, objective reporting, and pressure on politicians to provide accurate
information:

“More challenge of government when information is inconsistent or ambiguous” (48, T1DM, News
Channels)

“Fake news and anti-vac messaging to be removed promptly” (Social Media)

“It would be better if it came across as completely open and trustworthy.” (Government)

Higher quality information
Respondents also communicated the need for improvement in information provided by healthcare
teams, government, Diabetes UK, news channels and employers. They requested more information
on

precautionary

measures to take

in

terms of

shielding/physical distancing,

how

the

personal

network can help in emergencies, and diabetes self-management:

“Needs more clarity for people like me who are "vulnerable" but have not received the NHS letter”
(Government)

“Got told I had to return to work, no discussion about how worried that made me.” (Employers)

“When I had a hypo and was very mixed up and no one in the family intervened because of us being
distanced inside the home.” (Healthcare Team)

Support needs of people living with diabetes during COVID-19

“Explain what the relevance of vulnerability to C-19 is in relation to what types of diabetics (type 1 or
2), those with complications etc, not just say 'diabetics'” (News Channels)

“No specific policy for diabetics. Only general advice for people more vulnerable.” (Employer)

Consistency in the information provided was also deemed important:

“Changing risk category of Diabetes since the beginning.

Caused lots of confusion.” (Government)

Several respondents, however, communicated that they had noticed improvements with time:

“The information was much more clear. Particularly as they spoke about T1 and T2 separately”
(Diabetes UK)

Improved contact and communication
Respondents frequently reported absence of their healthcare teams and employers, which had a
negative impact on their mental health:

“No

contact from

manager at this time and waiting

for information

has

made

this time more

stressful.” (Employer)

“I have not received any information at all from my diabetes health care team” (Healthcare Team)

There

was

a

request

for

individualised

contact

and

for

the

healthcare

team

to

demonstrate

availability if urgent support was needed:

“I do feel that a quick phone call or more personal email would have been good.” (Healthcare Team)

“I have contacted my diabetic nurse several times, the only reply I have received is a text message
suggesting I go to diabetes UK website” (Healthcare Team)

“Would be good to hear more of “please contact us if there is a problem” rather than always “stay
away from the surgery.” (Healthcare Team)

Opinions regarding the support provided by healthcare teams varied across respondents, as some
indicated that their care team was responsive:

“Rang me to check I was ok as check-up delayed. Could ring if I wanted to.” (Healthcare Team)

Several respondents expressed an interest in remote consultations if this increased contact with
their care team:

“Improve access to diabetes team by telephone” (Healthcare Team)

Support needs of people living with diabetes during COVID-19

“Unless you have an illness and keep being told about having a underlying illness is harmful during
this time, you just don't understand.” (Friends and Family)

“It would be good if they were a little better informed, particularly, now, about the increased risks
posed to people with diabetes by Covid-19.” (Employer)

This was important to enhance experienced support:

“Friends are a very important source of general support” (Friends and Family)

CONCLUSIONS
This study provides valuable insight in the ways people living with diabetes have been impacted by
the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. As expected, NHS prioritisation of COVID-19 has had a negative
impact on the access and level of support most people with diabetes have during the pandemic, as
experienced by people living with other chronic conditions[11]. Findings are consistent with growing
evidence showing that government-imposed restrictions have had varied effects on people’s lifestyle
and

confinement has contributed to a 28% increase in sitting time[4] and adoption of unhealthy dietary
habits[12]. This reflects respondents’ decreased confidence in self-management in these domains.
Yet, as found in this study, a proportion of individuals appear to have adapted successfully to pursue
positive health-related behaviour change[12].

Findings resonate with research evidencing an increase in psychiatric disorders and diabetes-related
emotional distress during COVID-19[13]. Diabetes increases vulnerability to psychiatric disorders,
which can

interfere

with appropriate

self-care

and worsen

diabetes prognosis[14]. Importantly,

diabetes-related stress contributes to poor glucose control[15], which increases an vulnerability to
the severity of COVID-19[16,17].

By capturing the experiences and opinions of people with diabetes,

this study conveys actions that could be taken to ameliorate psychological distress.

Respondents called for increased contact and tailored guidance and support from their care teams.
The reported poor quality of guidance and support received from the healthcare team may be due

Alternatively, it may be due the sudden change in access to the care team without patients having

commissioners must ensure that care teams across the UK are adequately equipped and trained to
ensure equal access to remote consultations. A practitioner’s familiarity with it is also key for its
success, and previous work emphasises the importance of helping diabetes care teams recognise
emotional distress in remote consultations[9].

This study shows that a collective effort should be made to improve the information provided to
people with diabetes, focusing on stratified and consistent guidance on individual vulnerability, how

Equipping the personal network with an increased understanding of diabetes and its challenges was
also seen as important to increase the quality of support received. This aligns with extensive work
demonstrating the value of a supportive immediate environment for the management of diabetes
[20]. Accordingly, future research and action are needed to better understand why such a large
proportion of respondents living alone were not receiving outside support. Isolation is a primary
contributor to mental health difficulties[21], and identifying ways to connect people living alone with
the community may be especially helpful during and after the pandemic.

Some methodological limitations need to be taken into consideration. The survey was distributed
online. It may not accurately capture the views of individuals who engage less with healthcare teams
or their community, and we did not reach people who are unable to access technology. Though
multi-modal steps were taken to raise awareness of the survey, ethnic minorities and males were
underrepresented. Alternative strategies should be adopted to target these groups, especially as the
prevalence of diabetes is elevated in ethnic minority communities[22]. These limitations occurred in

COVID-19 pandemic has impacted people living with diabetes and their views on opportunities for
improvement. As routine care is being cancelled due to increased infection rates and the roll out of
vaccines, it is essential that experiences and opinions from the initial wave of the pandemic are
incorporated in stakeholder decision-making.
