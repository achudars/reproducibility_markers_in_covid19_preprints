5

Methods and results

6

Data were collected from patients’ medical records, and we defined cardiac injury

7

according to cardiac biomarker troponin I level > 0.03 μg/L. Among the 291 patients,

8

15 (5.2%) showed evidence of cardiac injury. Of 15 hospitalized patients with cardiac

9

injury, the median age was 65 years, and 11/15 (73.3%) were men. Underlying

10

cardiovascular diseases in some patients were hypertension (n=7, 46.7%), coronary

11

heart disease (n=3, 20%) and diabetes (n=3, 20%). The most common symptoms at

12

illness onset in patients with cardiac injury were fever (n=11, 73.3%), cough (n=7,

13

46.7%), headache or fatigue (n=5, 33.3%) and dyspnea (n=4, 26.7%). These patients

14

had higher systolic pressures, white blood cell count neutrophil count troponin I

15

brain natriuretic peptide D-dimer and lower lymphocyte count and platelet count,

16

compared with patients without cardiac injury, respectively. Bilateral infiltrates on

17

chest X-ray and elevated C-reactive protein occurred in all patients with cardiac injury.

18

Compared with patients without cardiac injury, patients with cardiac injury were more

19

likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, and receive mechanical

20

ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane

21

oxygenation and vasopressor therapy and be admitted to the intensive care unit.

Introduction

2

The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), a new fatal virus that emerged at the end

3

of 2019, remains prevalent worldwide, especially in mainland China. As of March 11,

4

2020, at least 80969 cases have been diagnosed across mainland China, and 3162

5

people have died secondary to infection with this virus1. Because there is no specific

6

drug therapy, the virus has caused public panic and great concerns globally. Although

7

we know that infection with 2019-nCoV can lead to pneumonia, acute renal injury,

8

acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and shock, we still know little about

9

cardiac injury after infection with 2019-nCoV2.

10

Some viral infections are associated with cardiac injury3. Previous studies have

11

indicated that cardiac damage by coronavirus is relatively mild, even with the most

12

fatal coronaviruses, middle east respiratory syndrome and sudden acute respiratory

13

syndrome4, 5. However, as a new coronavirus, we do not know if 2019-nCoV is

14

harmful to the heart; the results from current studies are inconsistent. Chinese

15

scientists have found no obvious damage to heart tissue caused by 2019-nCoV,

16

according to autopsy results 6; however, other studies have reported that patients

17

infected with 2019-nCoV often suffered cardiac injury 7 8 9. The relationship between

18

cardiac injury and the risk of death among people infected with 2019-nCoV has not

19

been clarified. Research is urgently needed to explore the clinical features and

20

outcomes of 2019-nCoV-infected patients with cardiac injury.

21

Our study summarized the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV-infected patients

22

with cardiac injury to provide insight into the prevention and treatment of heart

Material and methods

4

We performed a retrospective study of the clinical characteristics of confirmed corona

5

virus disease 2019 COVID-19 cases from 10 January 2020 to 24 February 2020. We

6

identified 291 patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infections according to laboratory

7

testing after admission to hospital. The definitions of confirmed human infection with

8

2019-nCoV are based on the World Health Organization interim guidelines10. Only

9

patients with a laboratory-confirmed infection were included in the present analysis.

10

This study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics

11

commissions of the Guangzhou Eighth people’s hospital, with a waiver of informed

12

consent.

13

The research team of the Department of Cardiology, Guangzhou Eighth People’s

14

Hospital analysed patients’ medical records. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and

15

radiological characteristics and treatment, and outcomes data were extracted from

16

patients’ electronic medical records. The data were reviewed by a trained team of

17

doctors in the hospital who recorded patients’ demographic data, laboratory findings,

18

exposure history, comorbidities, symptoms and treatment measures.

19

Throat swab specimens were collected from all patients at admission, and

20

2019-nCoV ribonucleic acid was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction

21

within 3 hours, as in a previous study. Virus detection was repeated twice every 24

22

hours for 3 days.

using the Access

2

AccuTnI+3 test (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA).The highest level of TNI

3

was used to evaluate the degree of myocardial injury. Unless otherwise specified, all

4

values are the first data after admission, and if the index was measured more than

5

twice, we chose the highest value for analysis. Symptoms, ARDS and intensive care

6

unit (ICU) admission were recorded, and we defined ARDS severity according to the

7

international guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia11. Preexisting cardiac

8

conditions were defined as congestive heart failure, diabetes, arrhythmia or ischemic

9

heart disease and hypertension.

Statistical Analysis

11

Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation for normally

12

distributed data or as median (interquartile range,IQR) for skewed distributions.

13

Frequency data were presented as proportions. We compared continuous variables

14

using Student’s t test or the Mann–Whitney U test when appropriate, whereas

15

differences in categorical variables were assessed using the Chi-square test or Fisher’s

16

exact test.

17

All analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA).

18

Statistical charts were created using GraphPad Prism 7 software (GraphPad, San

19

Diego, CA, USA), and a two-tailed p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically

20

significant.

Epidemiological features of 2019-nCoV- infected patients with cardiac
Injury

3

A total of 291 patients from Guangzhou Eighth People’s Hospital were included in the

4

final analysis, and 15/219 patients (5.2%) had cardiac injury. Patients with cardiac

5

injury had a higher mean age than these without cardiac injury. The median age was

6

65 years (interquartile range, 55–72), and 11/15 (73.3%) were men. Patients with

7

cardiac injury had a higher proportion of preexisting cardiac conditions such as

8

hypertension (46.6%) and coronary heart disease (20%). The epidemiological

9

characteristics of the study participants are presented in Table 1.

12

2019-nCoV-infected patients with or without cardiac injury had similar symptoms.

13

The most common symptoms at illness onset were fever (n = 11, 73.3%), cough (n =

7, 46.7%), headache or fatigue (n = 5, 33.3%) and dyspnea (n = 4, 26.6%). No

15

patients with cardiac injury complained of chest pain and palpitation, and the values

16

for most of the laboratory results were within the normal ranges. However, patients

17

with cardiac injury had higher systolic blood pressure (132 mmHg vs 124 mmHg),

To our knowledge, this is one of largest studies to systematically investigate cardiac

17

injury in hospitalized patients with 2019-nCoV infection. In this retrospective

18

single-centre study, a small proportion (5.2%) of patients with 2019-nCoV infection

19

were diagnosed with cardiac injury. Our results showed that 2019-nCoV-infected

20

patients with cardiac injury had worse clinical outcomes compared with patients

without cardiac injury.

virus and other viruses, although viral-induced cardiac damage is relatively mild 3.

2

Even the fatal coronaviruses that caused middle east respiratory syndrome and sudden

3

acute respiratory syndrome resulted in minimal heart damage e4, 5 . 2019-nCoV is a

4

new coronavirus, and it is unclear whether it causes serious heart damage. Recent

5

studies have yielded inconsistent results. Xu et al found that there was no obvious

6

heart damage in autopsy examinations of patients with 2019-nCoV-induced

7

pneumonia6. However, other studies found that patients with 2019-nCoV-induced

8

pneumonia also developed cardiac injury 7 8 9. To ensure the accuracy of our cardiac

9

injury evaluation, we chose TNI as the only evaluation index. As a gold standard to

10

evaluate cardiac injury, TNI is more accurate than creatine kinase-MB and

11

electrocardiography. Our study found that a small proportion of 2019-nCoV-infected

12

patients (5.2%) developed cardiac injury, which is a lower rate than in previous

13

studies 9. This result may be related to using TNI as the only evaluation index in this

14

study.2019-nCoV-infected patients with cardiac injury in our study were usually older

15

(median age: 62 y) and often had pre-existing heart disease (hypertension, coronary

16

heart disease). Furthermore, older patients with chronic disease are more likely to be

17

critically ill 9. Our results showed that patients with a history of heart disease are at

18

increased risk of serious illness or death if they are infected with 2019-nCoV.

19

The mechanism of cardiac injury in patients infected with 2019-nCoV is unclear.

20

In a recent study, autopsy examinations failed to detect 2019-nCoV in heart tissue,

21

and the authors found no other substantial damage to the heart tissue 6. However,

22

increased numbers of studies have indicated an association between 2019-nCoV

infection and cardiac injury,

12

2

hypoxia and mechanical ventilation settings may be associated with cardiac injury,

3

and these common conditions in patients infected with 2019-nCoV may partly explain

4

the heart damage. It is also very possible that the viral invasion of 2019-nCoV to the

5

heart does not occur directly, but indirectly, via the inflammatory response. Severe

6

2019-nCoV infection may trigger an exaggerated immune response. This finding was

7

confirmed by autopsy results 6, which showed that overactivation of T cells accounts,

8

in part, for the severe immune injury. Another study showed that 2019-nCoV-infected

9

patients admitted to the ICU have higher cytokine levels (interleukin 2, interleukin 7

10

and other cytokines) compared with patients not admitted to the ICU 13. According to

11

these findings, we hypothesize that 2019-nCoV may promote cardiac injury by an

12

inflammatory reaction, but this hypothesis must be explored further.

. To explain these inconsistencies, severe infection,

13

Our study showed that during COVID-19 epidemics, cardiac injury was

14

associated with clinical outcomes for 2019-nCoV -infected patients. The proportion of

15

patients requiring non-invasive ventilator support and extracorporeal membrane

16

oxygen, admission to ICU and developing ARDS was significantly higher in patients

17

with cardiac injury compared with patients without cardiac injury. Cardiac injury is a

18

potential indicator of risk stratification for 2019-nCoV-infected patients.

19

Limitations

20

There are several limitations in our study. First, this study was a single-centre study

21

involving a small number of patients, and evaluating more medical records is needed

22

to support our conclusions. Second, because our patients were from Guangzhou City,

only, different clinical features of patients with heart injury from other geographic

2

areas may be found in future studies. Third, of the 291 patients, some were still

hospitalized at submission of this manuscript. Therefore, it is difficult to assess

4

patients’ long-term prognosis, and it is necessary to continue to observe the natural

history of the disease.
