Abstract

20

The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has killed over twenty-one thousand and sickened over four

21

hundred thousand people worldwide, posing a great challenge to global public health. A sensitive and

22

accurate diagnosis method will substantially help to control disease expansion. Here, we developed a

23

chemiluminescence-immunoassay method based on the recombinant nucleocapsid antigen and the

24

magnetic beads for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections and surveillance of antibody changing pattern.

25

Serums from 29 healthy individuals, 51 tuberculosis patients, and 79 SARS-CoV-2 confirmed patients

26

were employed to evaluate the performance of this approach. Compared to the IgM testing, the IgG

27

testing was more reliable in which it identified 65 SARS-CoV-2 infections from the 79 confirmed

28

patients and only two false-positive cases from the 80 control group with a sensitivity and specificity

29

reaching 82.28% and 97.5%, respectively. However, only a slight difference (not statistically

30

significant) in the detected cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections was observed between the IgM and IgG

31

testing manner in patients at a different time of onset of disease. A performance comparison

32

between an ELISA kit using the same nucleocapsid antigen and our chemiluminescence method was

33

undertaken. The same false-positive cases were seen in both methods from the paired control group,

34

while ELISA kit can only detect half of the SARS-CoV-2 infections from paired SARS-CoV-2 confirmed

35

patients group than that of the chemiluminescence method, indicating a higher performance for the

36

chemiluminescence-immunoassay approach. Together, our studies provide a useful and valuable

37

serological testing tool for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the community.

Introduction

40

Coronavirus, belonging to the family of Coronavirdiae and order of Nidovirales, is a group of

41

enveloped, non-segmented positive-sense RNA virus that has been reported to be able to infect

42

humans and a wide range of animals including cattle, swine, chicken, cat, horse, camels, rodent, bats

43

and snakes and so forth (1-3). Based on the genetic properties, coronavirus was further divided into

44

four genera, namely Alphacoronavirus , Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus

45

(4). Prior to December 2019, a total of six coronaviruses have been documented to be capable of

46

causing disease in humans. These include two strains from Alphacoronavirus (HCoV-229E and HKU-

47

NL63) and four from Betacoronavirus subfamily (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV)

48

(5-10). Among them, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East

49

Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are the most well-described as they directly led to two

50

deadly large-scale outbreaks globally, with 8,096 cases infections and roughly 10 percent mortality

51

and 2,494 cases and 34.4 percent mortality, respectively(9, 10).

52

Recently, the outbreak of a severe pneumonia COVID-19 was confirmed to be caused by the 2019

53

novel coronavirus infections (SARS-CoV-2) that was originated from a seafood wholesale market in

54

Wuhan, China(11). So far, this novel coronavirus has spread throughout the whole of China and over

55

198 countries globally, causing over468,905 laboratory-confirmed cases of infections with 21,200

56

people dead posing a great threat to the global public health (http://2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-nCov/).

57

Besides, there are still numerous suspected cases and a myriad of medical monitoring people who

58

were quarantined in specialized hospitals or at homes because of their previous epidemiological link

59

to confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients. All of these put an extreme burden on the emergency, hospital

60

and public health system particularly the epidemic zone worldwide. Therefore, a timely, sensitive and

61

accurate diagnosis approach is urgently needed and of pivotal importance for surveillances of disease

62

dissemination and the prevention of further expansions. Conventional diagnosis methods such as

63

virus culture and microscopic analysis are generally time-consuming and labor-intensive with limited

64

sensitivity (12, 13). In contrast, the last decade emerged molecular biologic and serologic approaches,

65

such as TaqMan Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), Enzyme-linked

66

immunosorbent assay, colloidal gold immunochromatography and direct chemiluminescence

67

immunoassay(CLIA), can be developed into a rapid and effective tool for detections of respiratory

68

pathogens infections, even though in certain circumstances molecular biologic method like RT-PCR

69

had a low sensitivity for specimens from upper respiratory tract (14-17).

70

In this study, we developed a chemiluminescence immunoassay method to specifically detect the

71

induced antibody IgM and IgG by SARS-CoV-2 using the recombinant nucleocapsid (YP_009724397.2)

72

and evaluate its sensitivity and specificity in detections of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. High

73

sensitivity and specificity results indicate this chemiluminescence immunoassay method in

74

combination with RT- PCR method can serve as highly sensitive and accurate tools for the diagnosis

75

and screen of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the community.

76

Material and methods

77

Participants and specimens

78

In Shenzhen city, China, patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 were all eventually admitted into a

79

specialized hospital (the third people’s hospital of Shenzhen) for quarantines and treatments. In this

80

study, a total of 29 healthy individuals, 51 tuberculosis patients and 79 SARS-CoV-2 patients were

81

enrolled for serological testing. Twenty-nine healthy people were recruited from the Shenzhen

82

University aging from 16 to 72 years old. Fifty-one tuberculosis patients were enrolled from the

83

Shenzhen Baoan hospital, and their mycobacterium tuberculosis infections were previously confirmed

84

by sputum smear acid-fast-bacilli analysis, chest radiograph and the QuantiFERON®–TB Gold test.

85

COVID-19 patients were randomly enrolled from the third people’s hospital of Shenzhen, and their

86

SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by combinations of epidemiological risk, clinical features and

87

positive detections of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory specimens using the National Medical

88

Production Administration authorized GeneoDX kit according to the official instruction for diagnosis

89

and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus infections issued by the National Health Commission of the

90

People’s Republic of China. All healthy cohorts and tuberculosis patients had no epidemiological risks,

91

and they were persistently negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detections in at least three respiratory

92

specimens’ tests using above mentioned GeneoDX kit. Peripheral blood samples were collected into

93

EDTA and sodium heparin containing tubes, and then the serum was separated by centrifugations

94

(800g ×10 minutes) for immediate testing or stored at −80°C until used. Verbal Informed consent was

95

obtained from all individual participants.

96

SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic acid

97

Total nucleic acid for collected respiratory specimens was extracted in BSL-3 laboratory using the

98

nucleic acid extraction and purification kit from Huayin Bio-Tech (Shenzhen, China) according to the

99

manufacturer protocol. Detections of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were performed using the National Medical

100

Production Administration authorized GeneoDX kit (Taqman RT-PCR method, targeting the ORF1ab

101

and N genes) according to the manufacturer instructions.

102

Development of chemiluminescence immunoassay and test procedures

103

After the transcription of extracted SARS-CoV-2 genome RNA into the cDNA, the coding regions

104

(YP_009724397.2) were then amplified and cloned into the pET30a vector. The recombinant full-

105

length nucleocapsid antigen was expressed in engineering E. coli BL21 (DE3) strains and purified using

106

the Ni-NTA resin (Darui Biotech, China). Magnetic beads Magnosphere™ MS300 used in this study are

107

commercially available in the JSR Corporation, Tokyo, Japan. Recombinant nucleocapsid antigens

108

were coupled to these tosyl magnetic beads using the catalytic reagent solution (3M Ammonium

109

sulfate / 0.1M Borate buffer, pH9.5) according to the manufacture’s instruction, and the resultant

110

beads were further blocked by 0.05% BSA for six hours at 37 °C. The following testing and detection

111

procedure was automated on a chemical immuno-luminescence analyzer ACCRE6 (Tianshen Tech,

112

Shenzhen, China). It was comprised of those following steps. 50 microliter pure serum was firstly

113

incubated with the magnetic beads that were coupled with antigens for 5 minutes at 37 °C.

114

Subsequently, the unbound substance was gently removed and then washed by Tris buffer for three

115

times. Alkaline phosphatase labeled anti-human immunoglobulin (50µg/ml) was added and further

116

incubated for 5 minutes at 37 °C in the Mes Buffer. After three times washing to remove unbound

117

materials, the lumigen APS-5 substrate (50ug/ml) was eventually added. Ultimately, the light signal

118

was measured by the photomultiplier in ACCRE6 (Tianshen Tech, Shenzhen, China) as relative light

119

units, and the whole testing can be completed in 23 minutes. Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive-serum

120

and negative-serum were used as controls in each set test.

121

Detections of IgG and IgM by a commercial ELISA kit

122

In parallel testing, the commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Darui Biotech, CHINA) for

123

detections of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibody was used to measure the SARS-CoV-2

124

antibody level in above mentioned COVID-19 patients and control individuals. For the principle of this

125

ELISA kit, the specific SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and anti-human IgM monoclonal antibody

126

were firstly coated on the plates, respectively. Subsequently, the 100 µl of 100- fold diluted serum

127

was added and then incubated for 60 minutes at 37 °C. After five times washing by PBST buffer, the

128

horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled mouse anti-human IgG antibody or HRP-labeled SARS-CoV-2

129

nucleocapsid antigen was added for 30 minutes incubation at 37 °C. Fifty microliter TMB substrate

130

was then added for 15 minutes incubation after the second time washing by PBST buffer. The

131

stopping solution was eventually added to suspend the reaction, and OD 450/630 values were

132

immediately measured using the Varioskan LUX™ Multimode Microplate Reader. The cutoff values for

133

positive were set based on the manufacturer’s recommendations.

134

Ethical statement

135

The internal use of collected samples for diagnoses of etiological agents and serological research was

136

approved by the Ethical Committee in the third people’s hospital of Shenzhen (SZTHEC2016001).

137

Statistical analysis

138

All statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 7 software. The One-way ANOVA test was

139

used to analyze the average RLU values difference between different participant groups. The chip-

140

square and Fisher’s exact test was used for comparing the difference between the analyzed groups.

141

The difference was considered significant when a p-value is < 0.05.

Detections of IgG and IgM antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 in serum and overall specificity and

145

sensitivity assessments

146

To assess the specificity and sensitivity of the chemiluminescence immunoassay method developed

147

based on the recombinant nucleocapsid antigen, serum from 29 healthy individuals, 51 tuberculosis

148

patients and 79 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients were employed and tested. More than six-fold and

149

eight folds higher average RLU (relative light units) values were observed in the SARS-CoV-2 patients

150

group in the IgM testing compared to that of the healthy cohort and tuberculosis patients (Figure 1A).

151

This average RLU difference is more dramatic when it comes to the IgG testing reaching 60 and 70

152

fold increase in SARS-CoV-2 patients in comparison with the healthy and tuberculosis group,

153

respectively (Figure 1B). A Receiver Operating Characteristic curve was then obtained based on these

154

RLUs for the SARS-CoV-2 patients group and control group that consists of healthy cohort and

155

tuberculosis patients. According to the ROC curve and analysis results, we recommend a cutoff setting

156

for IgM (RLU 162296) and IgG (336697), in which the calculated sensitivity and specificity for IgM were

157

82.28% and 81.25%, and 82.28% and 97.5% for IgG, respectively.

158

Based on this cutoff and using the IgM testing, we identified 15 cases and 65 cases as SARS-CoV-2

159

positive from the control group (80 cases) and the SARS-CoV-2 confirmed group (79 cases),

160

respectively (Table 1). In contrast, using the IgG testing, we only detected two false-positive cases

161

from the control group, which is in line with the higher specificity for IgG (97.5%) compared to that of

162

the IgM testing (81.25%) as above described.

The links between disease onset time, ages and IgM and IgG productions and detection efficiency

165

To explore whether the onset time was significantly linked with the detection sensitivity by this

166

serological chemiluminescence method, comparison and statistical analysis of the sensitivity rates

167

between different onset time patient categories was undertaken. No statistically significant

168

difference was observed between the IgM and IgG testing results in the patients with the same onset

169

time, although two more cases from 12 cases were detected by IgM testing compared to that of IgG

170

testing in patients less than the one-week onset of disease (Table 2, p-value ˃0.05). In stark contrast,

171

two more cases SARS-CoV-2 patients were identified by IgG testing than that of IgM testing in patients

172

with more than two weeks onset of disease (p-value ˃0.05). In addition, we also compared the

173

detection rates between the different age groups people, and we found that a significantly lower

174

detection rate in both lgM and lgG testing manner for individual group younger than 18 years old was

175

observed compared to that of people aging from 18 to 65 (p-value < 0.01) or over 65 years old (p-

176

value ˃0.05) (Supplementary Table S1). No statistically significant differences were observed for male

177

and female groups as well.

179

Comparisons with other ELISA kit

180

To further characterize the patient’s immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 antigens and to prove the

181

feasibility of the practical application of this serological testing kit in clinical diagnosis, 64 paired

182

serum from the above-mentioned control cohorts and 65 COVID-19 patients were also examined

183

using a recently developed commercial available ELISA Kit. A total of 14 false-positive cases (21%)

184

were identified by IgM testing in both methods. A very lower false-positive rate was observed in IgG

185

testing in both methods. Compared to the ELISA kit, a significantly higher detection rate for SARS-CoV-

186

2 in both IgM and IgG testing manners was seen in our chemiluminescence method, suggesting a

187

higher sensitivity of our approach compared to the tested ELISA kit (Table 3, p-value < 0.001).

188

Discussion

189

Compared with the conventional virological methods, the molecular biologic TaqMan RT-PCR method

190

has been widely used for clinical diagnosis of respiratory pathogens infections particularly in the initial

191

phase of disease because of its high specificity property (18, 19). Nevertheless, a relatively low

192

sensitivity (30%- 50%) in single upper respiratory specimen testing has been commonly reported

193

including the well-appreciated methods for SARS-CoV detections (20). Furthermore, since the SARS-

194

CoV-2 expansion from 2020 January, several cases reported that consecutive negative detections of

195

SARS-CoV-2 RNA were observed for upper respiratory specimens testing like throat swabs in patients

196

with apparent clinical symptoms, and the positive results can only be achieved by collecting the

197

bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for re-testing. Hence, a sensitive serological diagnosis method can serve

198

as a very useful compensation tool for current clinical diagnosis situations. Our results demonstrated

199

that a single IgG testing is feasible in the clinical diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2, as a higher specificity and

200

sensitivity were observed in our chemiluminescence method. In the humoral immune response, the

201

antibody IgM was generally produced earlier than the IgG isotype as the IgM can be expressed

202

without the isotype switching. Unexpectedly, we only observed a slight detection rate difference (not

203

statistically significant) between these two antibody isotype testing manner in patients in the first

204

week or more than two weeks after onset of disease. However, compared to the IgG approach, our

205

IgM method showed a lower specificity (higher false-positive cases) in our testing. As the IgM and IgG

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045153; this version posted March 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

206

using the same pure recombinant antigen and coupling condition (supplementary figure S1), the

207

detection specificity difference is more likely linked to intrinsic antibody traits and concentration

208

differences in the patients’ blood.

209

We noted that four patients with clinical symptoms less than four days were simultaneously detected

210

by both IgM and IgG testing. A close examination of their medical record reveals that all of them had

211

previous contact with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 individuals in at least 16 days ago, pointing to the

212

possibility that they were probably asymptomatically infected by SARS-CoV-2 for certain time already.

213

Fourteen cases (17.7%) from 79 SARS-CoV-2 confirmed patients were not identified by our serological

214

testing method (both the IgM and IgG manner). Interestingly, of them, seven people were younger

215

than 8-year-old or over 70-year-old. These people generally have low immunity in which a clinical

216

symptom may occur rapidly upon exposure to the SARS-CoV-2, and we speculate that the antibodies

217

in these people may not develop well yet when testing. More investigations are warranted to

218

uncover the real situations. When comparing the detection rates in different age groups by our

219

method, we noted that a significantly lower detection rate in both lgM and lgG testing manner for the

220

individual group younger than 18 years old was observed compared to that of people aging from 18 to

221

65. An in-depth look at the days after onset for these 12 individuals younger than 18-years-old, the

222

symptom onset time for all the 12 people are less than 14 days with six people even less seven days

223

(Supplementary Table S2). The lower detection rate for these 12 people younger than 18-years-old

224

was likely associated with no or less production of antibodies in them yet when we collected the

225

serums.

226

In our parallel performance testing, the same antigen of nucleocapsid protein was used in both the

227

commercially available ELISA kit and our chemiluminescence immunoassay. Unexpectedly, a

228

significantly higher sensitivity was observed in our method compared to the ELISA kit. This sensitivity

229

difference may be partially attributed to the difference in the serum amount for the first incubation

230

step. On the other side, the intrinsic method difference including the aspect of binding surface

231

interaction and mode of separations of the unbound material can also contribute to the sensitivity

232

difference in the chemiluminescence immunoassay and ELISA method.

233

In conclusion, in this study, we developed and evaluated a serological chemiluminescence

234

immunoassay testing technique for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections using the recombinant

235

nucleocapsid antigen. This high sensitivity and specificity chemiluminescence immunoassay method

236

combined with the RT-PCR method can doubtless significantly improve the clinical diagnosis for SARS-

237

CoV-2 and contribute to the control of COVID-19 expansion globally.
