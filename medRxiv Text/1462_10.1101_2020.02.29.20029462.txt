Abstract

Clinical assessment of possible infection with SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the
outbreak of COVID-19 respiratory illness, has been a major activity of infectious diseases services in
the UK and elsewhere since the first report of cases in December 2019. We report our case series of
68 patients, reviewed by Infectious Diseases Consultants at a Regional Infectious Diseases Unit in the
UK. We prospectively evaluated our service between the 29th Jan 2020 and 24th Feb 2020.
Demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected. We have compared
clinical features and subsequent diagnosis between well patients not requiring admission for clinical
reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial
treatment.
Final microbiological diagnoses included SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), Mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza
A, RSV, non SARS/MERS coronaviruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus. 9/68 were treated with
antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted to a negative pressure room of whom 5/68 were admitted
solely due to an inability to isolate at home. Patients requiring either admission on clinical grounds
or antimicrobials (14/68) were similar to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials, with
modestly more fever and shortness of breath in the clinically admitted / antimicrobial group. The
most commonly prescribed antimicrobials were doxycycline, moxifloxacin and oseltamivir.
The majority of patients had mild illness which did not require a clinical intervention to manage. This
finding supports a community testing approach supported by clinicians to review the proportion of
more unwell patients.

Introduction

SARS-CoV-2 is a recently named novel coronavirus responsible for the outbreak of respiratory
disease named COVID-19, arising in Wuhan, China, in December 20191-3. At the time of writing (27th
Feb 2020) the overwhelming majority of cases have been reported from inside China, however single
or small numbers of cases have been confirmed in 46 other countries. Transmission has occurred in
some countries outside China4,5, including the UK6.

In the UK, public health and clinical services have been working to identify suspected cases according
to a national case definition and to arrange testing, predominantly by real-time PCR of nose and
throat swabs. Since testing began, local procedures and national guidelines have changed in
response to changing understanding of the disease and demand for testing. On the evening of
06/02/2020 the UK definition of a suspected case was extended to include people presenting with
respiratory illness (defined as cough, shortness of breath or fever with or without other symptoms)
returning from or transiting through China including Hong Kong and Macau, Japan, Malaysia, South
Korea, Singapore, Taiwan or Thailand within the last 14 days, with the case definition subsequently
changing further on 25/02/2020 to include northern Italy, Iran and further countries in SE Asia. As of
27/02/2020, 7690 tests have been performed nationally, of which 15 were positive (0.2%). Initially,
testing has been led by clinicians, predominantly by infectious diseases or emergency department
physicians, although there are plans to move to a community testing model led by other groups of
healthcare professionals, and some regions have already done so. Patients are instructed to selfisolate while results are pending and until their symptoms have resolved, with possible financial and
health implications for the 99.8% so far in the UK who have an illness other than COVID-19. During
the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic when a syndromic management strategy with presumptive
treatment and self-isolation was used, initial clinical diagnoses of influenza were reported to delay
diagnoses of a number of diseases including primary HIV infection7 and Plasmodium falciparum
malaria8, and although scoring systems were developed it remains difficult to distinguish between
viral and bacterial pneumonia on clinical grounds9. In addition, many mild respiratory viral infections
were managed as influenza10, with significant resource implications, both for healthcare services and
patients
Here we describe our experience of the first 68 patients we have tested for SARS-CoV-2 at a Regional
Infectious Diseases unit (RIDU) in the UK. We present the spectrum of illness, alternative diagnoses

made and management provided. This is of particular interest at this stage of the epidemic, where
many individuals meeting the definition of a suspected case are returning travellers, where the
differential diagnosis of respiratory or undifferentiated febrile illness may be broad11. These findings
have implications for the clinical and logistical support that may be required for roll-out of
community testing to be a safe and effective replacement for the current predominantly hospitalbased, physician-led system.

Methods

Patients

The RIDU at Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust is based at Castle Hill Hospital, East
Yorkshire, UK and serves a population of 1.2 million people. Patients were predominately referred
following telephone assessment by the national NHS 111 service, using Public Health England (PHE)
case definitions. Patients were assessed by an infection clinician either in the infectious diseases
ward, the ambulance or the patient’s car that had transferred them to the unit, and in one instance
in the emergency department of the trust. The first 68 consecutive cases are presented here.
Clinical assessment and testing

All patients had symptoms recorded, together with a travel and exposure history for at least the 14
days preceding symptom onset. Due to the use of personal protective equipment and in some cases
assessment in the patient’s car, clinical examination and observations varied between cases.
Patients were managed as outpatients if clinically stable and able to self-isolate. All cases were
tested for SARS2-CoV using a combined throat and naso-pharyngeal (NP) swab, which were
processed at the designated public health laboratory. A separate NP swab was tested locally using
the BioFire Film Array Respiratory Panel 2 plus (BioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) which can detect
21 targets (17 viral and 4 bacterial). Blood samples were only performed on patients being admitted
or where another serious diagnosis was being considered.

Data collection, analysis and governance approval

Data were entered directly from clinical notes into a centrally held password protected spreadsheet,
to facilitate patient follow up and data analysis. Clinical features, observations, investigations,
management and outcomes are presented with descriptive statistics where relevant. Local clinical
governance approval was granted to record the data as an ongoing service evaluation. As all care
delivered to patients was routine, no ethical approval is necessary in keeping with UK national
guidance that this is an evaluation of a current NHS service.

Results
Timeline of cases, countries visited and location of management

The timeline of cases seen is shown in figure 1. With the change in case definition to include those
returning from SE Asia, the number of cases markedly increased from an initial mean of 0.9 cases /
day to 3.3 / day. 15 / 68 patients (23%) were admitted to the unit, with the remaining patients being
managed in an ambulatory manner. Of those admitted, six were only admitted as they could not
effectively self-isolate pending results. Mean length of hospital stay in those admitted was 2.4 days
(range 1 – 10 days). 10 patients (15%) had returned from China in the 14 days prior to onset of
symptoms, with 26 of the cases (38%) having visited the most common country of travel, Thailand.
Eight patients had not left the UK in the preceding 14 days and were seen as contacts of confirmed
or suspected cases.
Clinical features, patient demographics, antimicrobial usage / management and
discharge diagnoses

Of the 68 patients seen 36 were female (53%), with a mean age of 42.5 years (range 0.5 – 76). Table
1 shows the presenting features of the cases seen. In addition to the symptoms shown in the table,
three cases (4%) had headache, three (4%) had ear pain and nine (13%) had diarrhoea (two with
vomiting as well). Table 2 shows the baseline physical observations, with seven patients (10%)
having a temperature of 37.5° or greater on assessment. Antimicrobial therapy was prescribed to
nine patients (1.3%), with doxycycline given to five patients (78%), moxifloxacin to three (4%), and
oseltamivir to one confirmed influenza A case (1%).

Clinical diagnoses in this cohort included upper respiratory tract infection in 50 patients (74%)
exacerbations of airways disease in five patients (7%), lower respiratory tract infections in four
patients (6%), gastroenteritis in three (4%), influenza like illness in two patients (3%), with one
patient (1%) each diagnosed with the following: otitis media, a well contact, inebriation and
community-acquired pneumonia.

Laboratory investigations

Table 3 shows the results of both virological sampling for standard respiratory pathogens in 49 (98%)
of the cases assessed. In addition to the virological sampling of NP swabs, four patients (6%) had
sputum tested using the BioFire pneumonia panel, with one patient (2%) found to have
Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), one patient with E.coli and Haemophilus influenzae, one patient with
Haemophilus influenzae and seasonal Coronavirus co-infection, and one with Haemophilus
influenzae mono-infection. Malaria films were performed and were negative in four patients (6%),
whilst blood cultures were negative in all 14 patients (28%) they were performed on. Standard
clinical chemistry and haematology tests were performed in 20 patients (29%). Five patients (7%)
had elevated total white cell counts (highest recorded 15.3 x 109 / L) with one patient having mild
thrombocytopaenia (92 x 109 / L). No patients had abnormal serum creatinine or electrolytes, with
two (4%) having mildly elevated serum alanine transaminase levels (highest level 63 IU / L). CReactive Protein (CRP) levels were within the normal range in 12 out of 19 cases tested (63%), with
the highest recorded level being 73 mg / L.

Comparison of clinically well patients with those requiring antimicrobials / clinical need
for admission

Table 4 shows the physiological and demographic features of those patients who were prescribed
antimicrobial therapy OR admitted for clinical reasons (as a group that represents those patients
requiring medical input) compared to the other patients seen who were either managed as
outpatients, or admitted due to being unable to self-isolate. Fever ≥37.5° and shortness of breath as
a symptom were the only predictors of requiring antimicrobials or admission for a clinical need.

Discussion

We have presented our experience of testing for SARS-CoV-2 at a UK university teaching hospital.
Sixty-eight individuals, including 2 children, were tested over 26 days. The majority were ambulant
and able to self-isolate, and had features consistent with an upper respiratory tract viral infection, or
common cold. After the first 10 cases, 6/58 (10.3%) were admitted, at least three of whom only
because they lived in shared accommodation where self-isolation was unrealistic, rather than on
clinical grounds. This observation supports a community testing approach for the majority. Five of
fifty individuals were prescribed antimicrobials without being admitted, emphasising the importance
of the availability of clinical decision makers and prescribers for more unwell patients. None of our
cases had severe respiratory illness requiring non-invasive or mechanical ventilation, suggesting it
will be rare that patients meeting the definition of a suspected case will require enhanced care, at
least while COVID-19 itself remains rare in the UK. Some COVID-19 case series have suggested up to
20% of cases may require respiratory support2,12, although this figure may be influenced by
ascertainment bias. If more generalised outbreaks occur outside China, we may start to see severe
COVID-19 presenting to UK healthcare services.

Specialist Infectious Diseases consultant-delivered assessment of a group of patients who
predominantly have mild illness is unlikely to be sustainable, especially as the case-definition
broadens to include a wider geographical area and/or COVID-19 patients requiring inpatient care
becomes more common in the UK. There was a step-change in the number of suspected cases seen
after the introduction of the third case definition on the evening of 6th February 2020 as a high
number of people with respiratory symptoms and recent travel suddenly became suspected of
having COVID-19. As there is further spread in the coming weeks, as is the case in Italy and Iran, and
the epidemiological criteria of the case definition is notably extended again, Infectious Diseases
clinicians will be unable to sustain a hospital-based screening service. The NHS is responding to this
challenge by moving to a community provider screening model, which will deliver the majority of
testing in the home.

Specialist input and assessment, supported by appropriate laboratory investigations must be easily
accessible to a COVID-19 testing service, especially if delivered by health care workers other than
Infectious Diseases physicians. This is important for patients in the self-isolation periods both before

and after receiving a test result as these individuals will not readily be able to access the usual
healthcare services. This may apply particularly to patients with pre-existing lung disease, where
respiratory viral illness, caused by SARS-CoV-2 or otherwise, may trigger clinical deterioration that
could ordinarily be managed by early community intervention. Infectious Diseases physicians may be
the group best placed to support patients in this situation for the short period of self-isolation,13
especially given the need for ongoing personal protective equipment use14. Although we did not
observe any imported “tropical” infections such as dengue, malaria, typhoid, rickettsiosis or
leptospirosis, these remain important differential diagnoses in returning travellers from some areas
of South East Asia and may be life-threatening if missed8,15. These diagnoses may become more
common in this group now that the definition of a suspected case has been expanded to include
other countries in South or South East Asia such as Vietnam. Individuals receiving testing for COVID19 should be signposted to an accessible clinical service with an understanding of this differential
diagnosis in case of worsening illness.
Our data from the routine virological testing performed is in keeping with community based results
showing that symptoms and viral detection do not always go together16 and shows a different
spectrum to those patients admitted and tested using the same assay17, with fewer influenza
diagnoses and a greater proportion of rhinovirus / enterovirus as well as seasonal coronaviruses
cases. A recent report from Italy18, immediately before the recent increase in SARS-CoV-2 detection
showed a greater proportion of influenza B than in our cohort, which may be explainable by the
differing geographical exposures between the two groups.

Admitting individuals to a secondary care facility, even for short periods of assessment, may have
other drawbacks. Travellers to South East Asia, particularly those who received antibiotics or were
admitted to healthcare facilities, can potentially carry and transmit carbapenem-producing
enterobacteriaceae. Additionally, because these patients need to be more pragmatically managed
than patients not suspected of COVID-19, they may be more likely to be exposed to antimicrobial
therapy. There are also significant resource implications not just in terms of PPE use but
predominantly in terms of the time required to don and doff PPE for every care interaction from
bringing food to routine observations to clinical review. This burden can be at least partially
alleviated through a home testing approach.

Infection clinician time is another important resource that may not be best used in managing mild
respiratory illness that meets the suspected COVID-19 case definition. In recent years, many studies
have demonstrated the benefit of ID physician review in terms of clinical outcome and resource
utilisation in infections such as Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia19,20 and resistant gram-negative
infections21. Our findings support the assessment of, and testing for, possible COVID-19 by other
cadres of healthcare workers, outside the secondary care setting, but supported by specialist
physicians and hospital based further diagnostics where needed. The optimum configuration for
such a service remains unclear and is likely to vary depending on local constraints, but during the
containment phase of the epidemic response there may be time to pilot and compare a range of
models before we are forced to move to delay and possibly mitigation strategies.
