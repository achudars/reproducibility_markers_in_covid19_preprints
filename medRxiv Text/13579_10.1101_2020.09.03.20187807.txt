Abstract

12

The Government of Nepal issued a nationwide lockdown from 24 March to 21 July 2020. Here

13

we present the overall scenario of COVID-19, government efforts, impact on socio-economic,

14

education, and health care, and prevailing challenges when the lockdown was lifted. We collated

15

and analysed data provided by the Nepalese Ministry of Health and Population. There were only

16

two confirmed cases from 610 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests

17

and no fatalities when the government introduced nationwide lockdown. Nepal had performed

18

7791 RT-PCR tests for COVID-19, the highest number of tests during the lockdown. It has

19

recorded its highest daily rise in coronavirus infections with a total of 740 new cases from the

20

total of 4483 RT-PCR tests performed on a single day. Nepal had reported a total of 17994

21

positive cases and 40 deaths at the end of lockdown. The spatial distribution clearly shows that

the cases were rapidly spreading from the southern part of the country where most points of entry

23

and exit from India are located. The government needs to allocate more resources, increase its

24

capacity to test and trace, establish dedicated isolation and quarantine facilities, and impose local

25

restrictions to manage potential COVID-19 outbreaks after easing lockdown.

Introduction

30

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak originating from Wuhan, China in late 2019 has

31

spread worldwide claiming more than 700 thousand lives all over the world [1]. On 11 March

32

2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as a pandemic [1]. Since the outbreak of

33

the disease WHO through its guidelines has prioritized the actions for responding to the virus;

34

urged the government to maintain health facilities, raise public awareness, and stock up on

35

medical supplies [2].

36
37

The strict lockdown was enforced to limit the spread of COVID-19 in countries such as Italy,

38

Spain, France, the UK after the steady rise in cases whereas Nepal introduced lockdown during

39

the early phase of the pandemic [3]. Lockdown is the blanket approach that buys time to prepare

40

the healthcare system (active case finding through testing and tracing, case management e.g.

41

quarantine, isolation and treatment, and availability of protective equipment) to confine the virus

42

and its spread. The Government of Nepal issued a nationwide lockdown from 24 March to 21

43

July 2020, prohibiting domestic and international travels, border closures, and closure of non-

44

essential services in the first stage, which was later eased on 11 June 2020. When the

45

Government of Nepal announced a nationwide lockdown, it had only two confirmed cases from

46

610 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests and no fatalities [4]. The

47

indexed case was found on 23 January 2020 in Kathmandu on a person who had travelled from

48

Wuhan, China [5]. The second case was confirmed two months later on 23 March who had

49

travelled to Nepal from France via Qatar [6].

In this article, we present the data of COVID-19 during a lockdown period (positive cases, RT-

52

PCR test performed, recoveries, total active and deaths cases including case fatality ratio), the

53

spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases, measures taken by the Government of Nepal in

54

managing the pandemic, socioeconomic and public health impacts including challenges. Finally,

55

we offer helpful suggestions to address the challenges brought by COVID-19.

Methods

58

Study Design

59

This was a descriptive study to assess the multiple scenarios of COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal

60

during the lockdown period. Daily positive cases reported in local administrative units

61

(Municipality or Rural Municipality) were analysed along with total daily data for the country.

62

Government efforts, public health, educational, socio-economic impacts, and prevailing

63

challenges were discussed to summarize the situation of Nepal during the initial lockdown

64

period.

Study Area

67

Nepal is a lower-middle-income country in South Asia between India (in the south, east, and

68

west) and China (in the north). It has a population of around 30 million. The new constitution

promulgated on 20 September 2015 made Nepal a federal democratic republic and is divided into

70

seven provinces, 77 districts, and 753 local units (municipalities and rural municipalities). It is

71

divided into three physiographic regions: Mountain region (Great Himalayan Range in the

72

northern part), Hilly region, and Terai region (low land region at the Indian border in the southern

73

part).

74
75

Data Collection

76

We analysed results from the COVID-19 situation reports prepared by the Nepalese Ministry of

77

Health and Population (MOHP). For this study, we downloaded the COVID-19 situation reports

78

from the openly available online resources on the web portal (covid19.mohp.gov.np). We

79

collated data for the lockdown period (from 24 March to 21 July 2020). The MOHP has defined a

80

confirmed COVID-19 case as any person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection,

81

irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms, i.e. person who had RT-PCR tested positive for

82

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

83
84

Statistical Analysis

85

Data were analysed descriptively in a Microsoft Excel 2019 Version 16.0 (Microsoft

86

Corporation, Redmond, Washington, USA). The number of COVID-19 cases, daily RT-PCR

87

tests performed and the number of recoveries were used to assess the COVID-19 pandemic

88

situation. The number of deaths and Case Fatality Rate (CFR) was presented by different age

89

groups. CFR was calculated as the proportion of confirmed deaths among identified confirmed

90

cases. Everyday data of COVID-19 positive cases were presented in local level units. The maps

91

used to show the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in Nepal were created using the QGIS

92

Version 3.14 (www.qgis.org).

Results

95

Figure 1 shows the daily and weekly average of tests and positive cases during the lockdown

96

period. On 29 June, Nepal had performed 7791 tests for COVID-19, the highest number of tests

97

during the lockdown. It has recorded its highest daily rise in coronavirus infections with a total of

98

740 new cases from the total of 4483 tests performed on a single day on 3 July. The number of

99

daily cases was decreasing after its peak on 3 July but subsequently, the number of tests was also

As per the figure, the number of people recovered from the coronavirus in Nepal increased during

106

the lockdown. However, the number of active cases decreased. On 1 July there were 10390 active

107

cases in the country which was continuously declining till the end of the lockdown period. Lack

108

of proper management of quarantine and isolation centres may have caused a significant increase

109

in cases two-months after lockdown started as most of the cases were imported from India, and

were later transmitted to the community. Data show that the bending of the curve had started

CFR in Nepal shows a similar trend to the COVIRA risk model [7] which is the risk model based

127

on early-stage pandemic data. Figure 4 shows the comparison of the COVIRA risk model and

128

Nepal data (relative percentage of CFR). The correlation between CFR in age groups and

129

COVIRA model is 0.986 which shows very good agreement of data. The trend of CFR by age

130

group shows exponential relation with r-square value of 0.714. Hence, one of the alarming points

131

for Nepal is, if the infection spread in the community and the older people get infected, the death

132

toll will rapidly increase.

The government lifted the lockdown when the curve of daily cases was flattening, however, the
situation in the country was not totally under control. There was a high possibility of spreading
the virus if an infected person was exposed to others until around two weeks of infection.
Mapping the report of last active cases across the country was important to look at the prevailing
risk zones. Figure 6 shows the number of days since the last case was reported on the day when
the lockdown was lifted.

Discussion
Nepal had performed 7791 tests for COVID-19, the highest number of tests during the lockdown.
It has recorded its highest daily rise in coronavirus infections with a total of 740 new cases from
the total of 4483 tests performed on a single day. The number of people recovered from the
coronavirus in Nepal increased during the lockdown. Nepal had reported a total of 17994 positive
cases and 40 deaths on the last date of nationwide lockdown. The spatial distribution clearly
shows that the cases were rapidly spreading from the southern part of the country where most
points of entry and exit from India are located.

Socioeconomic Impact
Nationwide lockdown restricted the socioeconomic activities all over the country, where very few
essential services were run throughout the period. Multidimensional impacts of lockdown have
been found in society, many people lost their job and businesses along with other health care
were impacted. It disrupted the supply chain, shut many informal and small enterprises, and
pushed more vulnerable people into poverty [9]. The tourism industry hit hard in Nepal where it
fell below 10%, resulting in more than 13000 job losses of trekkers and guides [10]. There are 1.6
to 2 million jobs at risk due to the COVID-19 crisis where 80.8% of total jobs in the country are
informal [11]. A household survey on the impact of COVID-19 on food security and
vulnerability conducted by the World Food Programme, Nepal and the Ministry of Agriculture
and Livestock Development showed that of the 4416 households from across the country, only
42% had one month worth of food stocks [12].

Impact on Education
The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened already existing inequalities within the education
system. In Nepal, all educational institutions have been closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Interrupted learning is one of the immediate impacts of school closures. According to UNESCO,
more than 8 million students in Nepal (4.5 million females and 4.3 million males) of which
primary and secondary school children represent 45% and 39%, respectively were affected by
school closures due to lockdown [13]. During the lockdown, children from poor, marginalized,
and disadvantaged families who already have limited educational opportunities outside school are
most affected. UNESCO anticipates a rise in dropout rates when schools reopen because poor
families engage their children to work for income-related activities [14]. Child marriage has
increased during the lockdown and it is estimated to further surge during pandemic [15, 16].

Although the Government of Nepal has strategies for online learning during school closure,
children from poorer families and those living in rural areas are unable to access such alternative
education opportunities [17].

Healthcare Impact
The lockdown has affected the health of individuals and disrupted healthcare services particularly
emergency and regular health services. During the lockdown, at the individual level, one of the
most notable impacts was on psychological health. Quarantine, social isolation, and travel
restrictions had negatively impacted the mental health of people who have COVID-19 and their
families. A few preliminary studies have shown psychological issues such as stress, anxiety,
depression, insomnia among the general population [18-20] as well as frontline health workers
[21, 22]. A study by Gupta, Mehra conducted among 150 health workers showed that 38 % of the
healthcare workers on COVID-19 duty in Nepal suffered anxiety and/or depression [22]. Another
online survey conducted among 475 health workers showed that 41.9% of health workers had
symptoms of anxiety, 37.5% had depression symptoms and 33.9% had symptoms of insomnia
[21]. Incidents of stigmatization and social discrimination of healthcare workers, people who
have COVID-19, and their families were also reported in Nepal during the lockdown [23, 24].

Nepal Police record shows that during the lockdown, the number of suicide cases has increased.
Within 74 days of lockdown, a total of 1227 people committed suicide, which is more than 15
suicidal death per month compared to the previous year [25]. Although reasons for what had
caused suicide and suicidal thoughts are still unknown in Nepal, they could be linked to the
uncertainty about the pandemic, self-isolation, financial burden, loss of family members, stigma

as evident in previous disasters and epidemics [26-28]. In addition to suicide, domestic violence,
sexual abuse, and rape were being perpetrated during the lockdown in Nepal [29].

The government's priority to combat COVID-19 and the lockdown adopted to contain its
transmission put vulnerable populations such as pregnant women, children, the elderly, and
people with non-COVID diseases at risk by impacting their ability to access essential healthcare
services. For example, pregnant women faced barriers to accessing regular antenatal care and
delivery services [30] and patients with non-communicable diseases faced barriers to access longterm care and medicines [31] during the lockdown periods. Millions of children aged between six
months and five years missed measles and rubella mass immunization, vitamin A, and
deworming tablets because the Government of Nepal postponed these national-level campaigns
[32]. Limited ability to access such essential and routine health care services poses an urgent
threat to the nation's health and could reverse some of the achievements in reducing maternal,
newborn, and child deaths.

Challenges
Future COVID-19 cases in Nepal will depend on the situation in India where the cases are
increasing rapidly. Nepal shares an open border with India and there may be an increase in the
number of Nepali workers returning from India who remain stranded in different parts of India
due to the lockdowns in both countries. It is estimated that 600000 migrant workers will return to
Nepal within a few weeks of lifting the nationwide lockdown restrictions [33]. This flow of
migrant workers could increase the number of cases as the government has not been able to
utilize the lockdown time efficiently to prepare and ready for responding to COVID-19. The
challenge will be to test and trace these people for COVID-19. Before the lockdown, thousands

of migrant Nepali workers returned to Nepal without proper screening from the Indian states of
Maharashtra, Delhi, and Gujarat, which have the most COVID-19 cases in India [34].
Furthermore, active cases reported in recent days across the country are major challenges to
control the community transmission of the virus. Figure 6 shows that most of the areas have
recent active cases (the last case reported up to 15 days). Lifting the lockdown instead of easing
some restrictions would negatively impact public awareness. Citizen and institutional/governance
awareness is always a key factor in disaster risk reduction and managing pandemic, that is often
lacking in low-income countries [35].

The testing capacity of the country has not increased due to a shortage of RT-PCR test kits,
personal protective equipment, trained workers, and medical supplies. With limited testing
capacity, it is challenging to monitor the transmission of the virus in Nepal because the suspected
cases continue to transmit the virus while awaiting the COVID-19 test. Some COVID-19 cases
remain asymptomatic, so it is difficult to predict the severity of the outbreak. There are only a
few health facilities capable of treating and managing the cases with some degree of preparedness
and readiness to provide the services [36, 37]. If the number of cases becomes higher than the
capacity of these health facilities to cope with the increased demand it would be more challenging
to contain the virus.

Another challenge is to control other communicable and non-communicable diseases amidst the
COVID-19 pandemic. Non-communicable diseases such as cancer, hypertension, cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, mental illness are already a major public health
problem in Nepal and accounted for 71% of the total annual deaths in 2019 [38]. These diseases

will exacerbate and the impact could be much higher than the COVID-19 if they are left behind
in the fight against COVID-19.

Strengths and Limitations
The study strength included the use of openly available official figures from the MOHP web
portal to provide an overall scenario of COVID-19 pandemic during the lockdown. The findings
would be applicable to compare the post-lockdown situation of COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal
and to guide more effective measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus. One of the
limitations with openly available data was that individual-level patient details were not accessible
to perform detail epidemiological analysis. The number of people who had COVID-19 represents
only a reflection of those who were tested rather than the actual figure. In the daily situation
reports shared by the MOHP, there was inconsistency in the details provided. Some daily
situation reports of the COVID-19 had information on gender while others did not contain such
key information.

Conclusion and Recommendation
This study provides an overall scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic during the lockdown in
Nepal. The capacity of the health system to quickly test to find out if anyone who develops
symptoms of COVID-19 and tracing and testing of close contacts of those who test positive for
COVID-19 must be increased. The government needs to allocate resources, such as necessary
public health workforce, availability of personal protective equipment, expansion of intensive
care unit beds, and purchase of extra ventilators. Other actions to stop spread include managed
isolation in a designated setting for people who cannot afford to self-isolate or in a dedicated
quarantine facility who can’t self-quarantine. Another approach the government could take to

manage local COVID-19 outbreaks is to impose local restrictions. This could be in the form of a
local lockdown based on risk assessment rather than a nationwide lockdown. As the restrictions
of COVID-19 lockdown are eased, there would be more flow of people which leads to more
exposure so preventive measures should be established in shopping centres, cities, shops, and
workplaces. The government should continue disseminating information on following social
distancing, hand hygiene, and face covering.
