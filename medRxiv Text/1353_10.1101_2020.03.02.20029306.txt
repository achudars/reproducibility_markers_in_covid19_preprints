Abstract

2

Background: A new virus broke out in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and was later named 2019 novel

3

coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The clinical characteristics of severe pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV are

4

still not clear.

5

Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the

6

severe pneumonia caused by the 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China.

7

Method: The study included patients hospitalized at the central hospital of Wuhan who had been

8

diagnosed with a pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus. Clinical features, chronic co-

9

morbidities, demographic data, laboratory examinations, and chest computed tomography (CT) scans

10

were reviewed through electronic medical records. SPSS was used for data analysis to explore the

11

clinical characteristics and risk factors of the patients with the severe pneumonia.

12

Results: A total of 110 patients diagnosed with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia were included in

13

the study, including 38 with severe pneumonia and 72 with non-severe pneumonia. Statistical analysis

14

showed that advanced age, an increase of D-dimer, and a decrease of lymphocytes were characteristics

15

of the patients with severe pneumonia. Moreover, in the early stage of the disease, chest CT scans of

16

patients with the severe pneumonia showed the illness can progress rapidly.

17

Conclusions: Advanced age, lymphocyte decline, and D-dimer elevation are important characteristics

18

of patients with severe pneumonia. Clinicians should focus on these characteristics to identify high-

19

risk patients at an early stage.

Introduction

21

In December 2019, a new type of unexplained pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China,

22

which appeared to be related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market[1-3]. The disease spread

23

rapidly from Wuhan to the surrounding provinces and cities, which got the attention of the government

24

and the administrative departments of health at all levels. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and

25

Prevention (CDC) promptly organized the relevant disease control agencies, medical units, and

26

research institutes to carry out investigations and treatment. A new type of coronavirus was detected

27

by researchers in a patient's bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sample on January 3, 2020[4]. The World

28

Health Organization (WHO) named it the 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and announced that

29

the new coronavirus epidemic had been listed as a public health emergency of international concern on

30

January 30, 2020. As of 18:00 on February 11, 2020, there were 42,744 confirmed cases, 21,675

31

suspected cases, 4,161 cured cases, and 1,017 deaths in China .

32

The 2019-nCoV, which belongs to the genus betacoronavirus, is a single-stranded positive-strand

33

RNA virus that appears to be distinct from, but is related to, other coronaviruses, such as severe acute

34

respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome

35

coronavirus (MERSr-CoV)[4-8]. Current studies have shown that 2019-nCoV has about an 89%

36

homology with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% homology with human SARS-CoV[9]. The

37

disease is highly contagious, and may rapidly develop into severe pneumonia, acute respiratory

38

distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and death, so the top

39

priority for clinicians is to identify and treat the severest patients in the early stage. The aim of this

40

study was to assess the potential high-risk factors of 2019-nCoV severe pneumonia and provide

41

evidence for the screening of severely afflicted patients.

42

Methods

43

Patients

44

All of the patients in this study were hospitalized in a respiratory department, the Respiratory Intensive

45

Care Unit (RICU), from January 1, 2020 to February 10, 2020. The patients were all admitted to the

46

hospital because they were infected with 2019-nCoV and suffered from various kinds of symptoms,

47

including fever, dyspnea, cough, and fatigue. Every patient had completed the relevant laboratory

48

examination, including various common pathogen detection and chest computed tomographic (CT)

49

scans. All of the patients were local residents of Wuhan. Moreover, most of the patients had a history

50

of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market or had made contact with people who had been

51

confirmed (or suspected) to have contracted the illness. The 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection of

52

some patients was positive, while for others, it was negative. These results could have been caused by

53

the immaturity of the methods used for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection, which led to false negative

54

results. High-resolution CT scans with a scan layer thickness of 5 mm and a reconstruction of a 1-1.5

55

mm thin layer are recommended for the radiological examination of 2019n-CoV pneumonia. Based on

56

the patients' exposure history, clinical symptoms, laboratory examinations, and chest CT scans, all of

57

the patients were clinically diagnosed with 2019-nCoV pneumonia according to WHO’s interim

58

guidance[10]. For patients who were suspected to have the illness, two senior respiratory doctors made

59

the diagnosis together.

60

The patients were divided into two groups: patients with severe pneumonia and those with non-severe

61

pneumonia. The former referred to patients with the following severe manifestations: fever or

62

suspected respiratory infection, plus one of a respiratory rate >30 breaths/min, severe respiratory

63

distress, or SpO2 <90% on room air. Patients with ARDS, sepsis, or septic shock were also included.

64

The patients without the above severe signs were defined as having non-severe pneumonia. Patients

65

who had the illness combined with other bacterial, fungal, or other viral infections and those with

66

missing data were excluded. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Wuhan Central

67

Hospital (Yuan lun han (2020) no.4).

68

Data collection

69

The patient data were extracted from the Central Hospital of Wuhan, which is a tertiary teaching

70

hospital and is responsible for the treatment for patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, as assigned by

71

the Chinese government. Clinical features, chronic co-morbidities, demographic data, laboratory

72

examinations, and chest CT scans were reviewed using electronic medical records. Laboratory

73

examinations included routine blood tests, as well as tests of the liver function, kidney function,

74

electrolytes, B-type natriuretic peptide, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin. We obtained

75

the lymphocyte absolute values of patients with severe pneumonia on the first day and the third day

76

after admission. The D-dimer data of patients with severe pneumonia on the first day, the third day,

77

and the seventh day after admission were also collected. Chest CT scans were reviewed on the first

78

day and the third day for patients with severe pneumonia. In addition to collecting the albumin data on

79

the first day after admission, the data on the seventh day were also obtained for patients with severe

80

pneumonia. For patients with non-severe pneumonia, we only collected the data on the first day after

81

admission because the relevant items were not frequently reviewed. For patients admitted to the RICU,

82

the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (APACHE-II) and Sequential Organ

83

Failure Assessment (SOFA) were determined on the first day. The data were acquired by physicians.

84

All of the data were checked by another researcher to ascertain its accuracy. To reflect the progression

85

of the disease in critically ill patients, we calculated the difference in the lymphocyte values between

86

day 3 and day 1, the difference in the serum albumin values between day 7 and day 1, and the

87

difference in the D-dimer values between days 3, 7, and 1.

89

The continuous variables were used as the mean and compared using the t-tests if they were normally

90

distributed, or they were described using the median. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for

91

comparisons. Categorical variables were expressed as count (%) and compared by χ² test or Fisher’s

92

exact test. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the risk factors of severe pneumonia. The

93

difference of a certain indicator in the same patient at different periods was shown by a bar chart. A

94

two-sided α of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We used SPSS software (version

95

23.0) for statistical analysis.

96

Results

97

Basic characteristics

98

A total of 110 hospitalized patients participated in this study, which included 38 (34.5%) patients with

99

severe pneumonia and 72 (65.5%) patients with non-severe pneumonia. Table 1 shows that compared

100

with patients with non-severe pneumonia, males accounted for a greater proportion of those with

101

severe pneumonia and the difference was significant (24 [63.16%] vs. 24 [33.33%]). The patients with

102

severe pneumonia tended to be older and had complications with COPD (4 [10.53%] vs. 2 [2.78%])

103

and hypertension (15 [39.47%] vs. 8 [11.11%]). Patients over the age of 60 years accounted for a

104

greater proportion of the severe pneumonia cases (27 [71.05%] vs. 9 [12.5%]). There was no

105

significant difference in the smoking history and drinking history between the two groups. The

106

incidence of diabetes and cerebrovascular disease was similar in both groups. According to the

107

patients' medical history, the common symptoms at the onset of the illness were fever, fatigue, dry

108

cough, and dyspnea. Although the initial symptoms of the patients with severe pneumonia were more

109

commonly fever and dyspnea, and the difference was not statistically significant. The temperature

110

ranges were divided into low fever (temperature ≤38°C), moderate fever (temperature ≥38.1°C,

111

≤39°C), and high fever (temperature ≥39.1°C). However, there was no statistical difference between

112

the two groups.

113

Laboratory parameters

114

There was a number of differences in the laboratory findings between the patients with severe

115

pneumonia and those without it (Table 1), including a lower lymphocyte count, platelet count, and

116

serum albumin. The level of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, aspartate aminotransferase, c-

117

reactive protein, serum procalcitonin, D-dimer, and B-type natriuretic peptide were higher in the

118

patients with severe pneumonia. The white blood cell count, neutrophil count, hemoglobin, and

119

alanine aminotransferase did not differ between the two groups. Statistically, some parameters were

120

different between the two groups, but still within the normal range, including the platelet count, serum

121

creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, aspartate aminotransferase, and serum procalcitonin.

123

Binomial logistics regression analysis was used to assess the risk factors of severe pneumonia. The

124

variables with statistical differences between the two groups were incorporated into in the logistics

125

regression equation. To better understand the correlation between the lymphocytes and D-dimer

126

measurements with severe pneumonia, we divided the values of the lymphocytes and d-dimer by their

127

standard deviations. The results revealed that after adjusting for other confounding factors, the age and

128

D-dimer values were independent risk factors of severe pneumonia (Table 2). Patients over the age of

129

60 years and in the range of 40 to 60 old had a significantly higher risk of developing severe

130

pneumonia than those under the age of 40. For every 1 standard deviation increase in the D-dimer

131

value, the patients' risk of developing severe pneumonia increased by about 17 times. In addition,

132

lymphocytes were found to be independent protective factors for severe pneumonia. The incidence of

133

severe pneumonia in patients with a 0.55 increase in lymphocytes decreased by about 67.8%.

134

Both the APACHE-II and SOFA scores were assessed in patients with severe pneumonia, with results

135

of 14.5 (13, 17) and 6 (5, 7), respectively (Table 3). Severe pneumonia usually progresses rapidly, and

136

many clinical indicators can change in a short time, especially the lymphocyte, D-dimer, serum

137

albumin, and chest CT manifestations. To better identify severe pneumonia early, we calculated the

138

difference in the lymphocyte counts, serum albumin values, and D-dimer values at different points in

139

time (Table 3, Figs. 1-4). The results showed that in the early stage of the disease, the lymphocyte and

140

serum albumin decreased and the D-dimer increased with the progress of the disease. We have

141

included 2 chest CT scans of one patient with severe pneumonia at different time periods, which

142

suggested the rapid progress of the disease (Fig. 5).

143

Discussion

144

This was a cross-sectional study on the clinical characteristics of patients with 2019-nCoV, especially

145

those with severe pneumonia. Our study suggested that advanced age, lymphocyte decline, and D-

146

dimer elevation were more prominent in the patients with severe pneumonia, which is useful for the

147

early identification of patients with severe pneumonia.

148

The laboratory examinations showed that patients with severe pneumonia had depressed serum

149

albumin, elevated serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, aspartate aminotransferase, C-reactive protein,

150

and B-type natriuretic peptide. Hypoproteinemia may be due to the patient's consumption and

151

inadequate protein intake caused by poor appetite. A previous study reported that hypoalbuminemia is

152

a potent, dose-dependent predictor of poor outcomes for pneumonia with the coronavirus infection[11].

153

An elevated amount of C-reactive protein may be associated with the inflammatory response and

154

cytokine storms caused by the virus in the blood vessels. These results were consistent with a previous

155

study, which showed that the C-reactive protein level was positively correlated with the severity of the

156

pneumonia[12].

157

According to the results of the binomial logistics regression analysis, we found that age and the level

158

of the D-dimer were independent risk factors. These results suggested that the level of D-dimer was

159

significantly positively correlated with the 2019-nCoV severe pneumonia, which was also shown in

160

another study[13]. Previous studies showed that SARS-CoV could bind to ACE2, down-regulating the

161

expressions of ACE2, and resulting in an increased Angiotensin II level in mouse blood samples,

162

signaling through Angiotensin II receptor 1, and induced acute lung injury[14-16]. ACE2 is a receptor

163

protein of both SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV, and it is abundantly present in the epithelia of the lung

164

and small intestine[17]. It was reported that 2019-nCoV binds to the ACE2 in the same way as SARS-

165

CoV[18], inducing damage to the pulmonary arteries and leading to the extensive embolization in the

166

extensive alveolar terminal capillaries. These changes eventually lead to an increase in D-dimer. A

167

significant lymphocyte decline in the progression of severe pneumonia was also observed, which was

168

consistent with the results of Huang et al[19]. Decreased lymphocytes suggested that 2019-nCoV may

169

primarily attack the body's immune system, especially the T lymphocytes, which is similar to the

170

action of SARS-CoV[20]. After 2019-nCoV impairs the immune system, it is difficult to prevent the

171

virus replication by immediately forming the neutralizing antibody. Non-specific pulmonary

172

secondary inflammation acts with the 2019-nCoV infection, inducing cytokine storms and producing a

173

series of immune responses and causing disorders of the lymphocyte subsets. Therefore, the above

174

may explain the decline of lymphocytes and the rise of D-dimer in the progression of severe

175

pneumonia. In addition, the pulmonary CT findings of patients with severe pneumonia can progress

176

rapidly, so it is important to review chest CT scans in a timely fashion to learn about the pulmonary

177

lesions.

178

Limitations

179

This study had several limitations. First, only 110 patients from a single hospital were included in this

180

study; a larger scale study needs to be carried out to confirm our conclusions. Second, most of the

181

patients were still hospitalized when the manuscript was submitted, so we could not verify the efficacy

182

of the therapeutic and prognosis of the patients.

183

Conclusions

184

In general, the results suggested that advanced age, decreased lymphocytes, and elevated levels of D-

185

dimer were risk factors for severe pneumonia. Clinicians should pay close attention to these indicators

186

and identify high-risk patients as early as possible. More studies are needed to explore the clinical

187

characteristics and treatment options of critically ill patients.
