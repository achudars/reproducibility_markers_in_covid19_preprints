Abstr act
The rapid spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has greatly disrupted the livelihood of many
people around the world. To date, more than 35.16 million COVID-19 cases with 1.037million total
deaths have been reported worldwide. Compared with China, where the disease was first reported,
cases of COVID-19, the number of confirmed cases for the disease in the rest of the world have
been incredibly high. Even though several dugs have been suggested to be used against the disease,
the said interventions should be backed by empirical clinical evidence. Therefore, this paper
provides a systematic review and a meta-analysis of efficacy and safety of different COVID-19
drugs.

Resear ch in context
Evidence befor e this study
Currently, Covid-19 is one of the most urgent and significant health challenge, globally. However,
so far there is no specific and effective treatment strategy against the disease. Nonetheless, there are
numerous debates over the effectiveness and potential adverse effects of different COVID-19
antivirals. In general, there is invaluable need to continually report on new advances and successes
against COVID-19, apparently to aid in managing the pandemic.
Added value of this study
This study provides a comprehensive, evidence-based guide on the management of multiple
COVID-19 symptoms. In particular, we provide a review of 14 drugs, placebos and standard
treatments against COVID 19. Meanwhile, we also performed a meta-analysis based on four
clinical outcome indicators, to measure and compare the efficacy and safety of current interventions.
Implications of all the available evidence
Findings of this research will guide clinical decision in COVID-19 patients. It will also provide a
basis for predicting clinical outcomes such as efficacy, mortality and safety of interventions against
the disease.

Intr oduction
Despite stringent containment and isolation measures, the global incidence of COVID-19 continues
to rise. Globally, there have been more than 35,165,808 confirmed cases and more than 1,037,153
deaths from COVID-19 pandemic, as of October 2, 20201. Currently, even though there are
numerous researches on effective drug against COVID-19, no specific drugs have so far been
recommended. Most of the used drugs are based on the pathogenesis of the disease, however,
doubts continues to mount over their safety and effectiveness2. One concern is that short-term
benefits are on average minimal, and more worse, the balance between long-term benefits and

harms is still poorly studied. Although many drugs are available for COVID 19, their use should be
guided by integrated evidence to inform the best choice for each patient3.
Network meta-analysis provides a comparative efficacy and a broader evidence-based picture of
several interventions, the reason it was selected for exploring relative merits of multiple COVID-19
control modalities4. This is critical for COVID-19 because the view on best drugs is constantly
changing, and in particularly, in the race against managing this pandemic. Because it can provide a
complete, extensive and updated viewpoint of evidence, network meta-analysis is an ideal tool to
guide practical development and application of drugs against COVID 19. Our study provides a
thorough comparison on effectiveness and safety of currently available interventions against
COVID 19, likely not to have been experienced in some clinical settings. This network metaanalysis was performed using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) random effect model
that is capable of fitting models of virtually unlimited complexity, and as such have revolutionized
the practice of Bayesian data analysis5. Specifically, we evaluated the safety and effectiveness of 14
drugs, along with placebos and standard care, according to four clinical outcomes: average recovery
time, response rate, mortality and the rate of adverse events. Findings of this research aimed at
guiding the rationale of clinical decisions among COVID-19 patients.

Methods
Sear ch str ategy and selection cr iter ia
The systematic review and network meta-analysis was performed on numerous reports in the
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. We
included relevant studies published since inception the above databases till August 11, 2020,
regardless of the language. The search terms were severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2*” (MeSH) OR 2019nCoV*” OR SARSCoV2*” OR 2019 novel coronavirus*” OR COVID19
virus disease” OR COVID19 virus infection”, combined with a list of all included drugs.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included if they evaluated comparable outcome of drugs
with standard care, placebos or safety and effectiveness of a monotherapy in adults (≥18 years old
and of both sexes) with COVID-19. The interventional modules must have been in line with NIH
COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines6. Notable though, the included reports were not limited by dosage
and mode of administration. Additionally, included studies must have reported on at least one of the
aforementioned outcomes. Finally, quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials (CCTs) and
incomplete trials, non-drug treatment such as ventilation or trials on less than 10 participants were
all excluded from the meta-analysis. For duplicated publications, we only included the latest and
most complete edition. Reviews, case reports, letters and conference abstract were also excluded
from our analyses.
Relevant studies were selected independently by two reviewers. In particular, they reviewed the
main reports and supplementary materials, extracted the relevant information from the included
trials and assessed the risk of bias according to modified Jadad scale7. The quality of included
studies was rated based on four items: (1). generation of random sequence, (2). blindlessness of the
trails, (3.)concealment and (4). withdraws and dropouts. Any discrepancies were resolved by a
third arbitrator. Duplicates were first excluded using EndNote (version 9.3.3). Studies with
irrelevant title and abstract were then removed. The remaining papers were read in whole to assess
their suitability. Finally, relevant data were extracted independently according to pre-determined
criteria.
Outcomes
The efficacy and safety of interventional drugs were assessed based on four outcomes: the average
recovery time (average duration of hospital stay or days to reach clinical rehabilitation standard)
and response rate (based on the proportion of patients discharged or reaching clinical rehabilitation
standard during the test) for efficacy outcomes. On the other hand, safety outcomes included
mortality (the proportion of patients who died during the test) and the rate of adverse events (the
proportion of patients exhibiting adverse effect(s) associated with the drug).

Data analysis
Network meta-analysis was performed using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
random effect model. Key parameters for dichotomous outcomes included odds ratios (RR) and
standardized mean difference (SMD) both at 95% CI for continuous outcomes8. Node splitting
model tested the consistency in closed-loop interventions with both direct and indirect evidence
with P ＜ 0.05 considered statistically significant. If direct and indirect evidence were statistical
indifferent, then the consistency model was used in the network meta-analysis; otherwise the source
and significance of inconsistency was assessed5. Additionally, potential scale reduction factors
(PSRFs) were calculated to evaluate the convergence of the model. A PSRF value close to 1 is
indicative of good convergence, thus the results are high reliability9. PSRF ≤ 1.02 was acceptable.
Finally, comparative effectivity and safety of drugs was analyzed according to ranking probability
under the Bayesian network model.
Bayesian network model analysis was performed using ADDIS software10, whereas the diagrams
were plotted using Stata V. 14.24.

Results
Data collection and r isk of bias
In general, we identified 1137 articles, and after careful review, we extracted 128 of them for in
depth review (Figure 1). We constituted the final analyses via including 28 trial studies, 14 drugs
together with placebos or standard care and 17078 patients. Of the trial studies, 21 (75%) were
standard care- or placebo- controlled trials, whereas the remaining 7 (25%) performed drug-drug
comparisons. In addition, 4 (14%), 16 (57%) and 8 (28%) of the trials comprised of patients from
North and South America, Asia and Europe, respectively. Characteristics of each report are listed in
Table 2. Meanwhile, the risks of publication bias were assessed based on the modified Jadad scale.
Therefore, studies with a score of 0-3 were considered high degree of bias to publication, converse
to those with a score of more than 4 (Figure 2).

Bayesian evidence networ k and conver gence evaluation
The network of relevant comparisons for the four outcomes is shown in Figure 3. The relationship
between all interventional methods was plotted bassed on the direct comparison data. Briefly, each
cycle represents an interventional drug. The width of the connection lines is proportional to the
number of trials comparing every pair of treatments, whereas the size of each circle is proportional
to the number of randomly assigned participants (i.e, sample size). The direct or indirect evidence
among different interventional methods provided the basic conditions for the network meta-analysis.
Specifically, except for Arbidol, Chloroquine, Febuxostat and Favipiravir, the rest of the drugs were
evaluated against at least one standard care- or placebo.
Convergence PSRF of the four outcomes was acceptable, implying minor fluctuations in Markov
chain and stable iteration trajectory. As such, the convergence of the model was within the expected
distribution in the iterative process and, as a result, can be used in analyzing the data11. Specifically,
our model contained 4 chains, featuring 20,000 tuning iterations, 50,000 simulation iterations, 10
000 thinning interval inference samples, with a variance of 2.5. The number of iterations and
annealing was sufficient; therefore, no additional extension was needed.
Consistency test
Node splitting analysis was performed using ADDIS software. There was no significant difference
(P > 0.05) in average recovery time (20 trials, comprising 14169 patients) and mortality (16 trials,
comprising 16117 patients) across studies. This points to coherence between direct and indirect
comparison. However, there was a significant difference in response rate (24 trials, comprising
15120 patients) between two pairs of intervention drugs (P< 0.05). In particular local inconsistency
was found between chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as well as between lopinavir–ritonavir and
chloroquine. Meanwhile, inconsistencies were also observed between interferon β and lopinavir–
ritonavir, and between lopinavir–ritonavir and standard care with regard to rate of adverse events
(21 trials, comprising 4198 patients). These significant differences suggest of potential uncertainty

of predicted effect regarding the above drugs, and as such, their clinical applications against
COVID 19 need further evaluation12.
Effects and r ank pr obability of the inter ventions
Aver age r ecover y days
Average duration of hospital stays or days up clinical rehabilitation standard was reported in 20
trials incorporating 14169 participants. Treatment nodes included in the network meta-analysis were
arbidol, azvudine, chloroquine, colchicine, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, interferon β, ruxolitinib,
lopinavir-ritonavir, methylprednisolone and remdesivir, evaluated alongside placebos and standard
care. There was no significant difference in average recovery days between interventions (Table 2).
However, rank probability test showed favipiravir (rank probability: 0.46) is most likely the best
intervention against COVID 19, followed by arbidol (rank probability: 0.18) and azvudine (rank
probability: 0.15) (Figure 4 and Table 3).
Response r ate
Of the 28 included reports, 24 trials encompassing 15120 participants reported on the number of
patients discharged or who reached clinical rehabilitation standard during the test. The treatment
nodes involved in the network meta-analysis were azvudine, chloroquine, dexamethasone,
colchicine, favipiravir, febuxostat, hydroxychloroquine, interferon β, ruxolitinib, lopinavir-ritonavir,
remdesivir, placebo and standard care. As shown in Table 2, there was no convincing evidence that
any of the interventions significantly enhanced the response rate of patients with COVID 19.
Nonetheless, rank probability test showed that the drugs, colchicine (rank probability: 0.42),
chloroquine (rank probability: 0.28) and favipiravir (rank probability: 0.11), are most likely to be as
the best interventions against the disease. Meanwhile, the treatment effects of febuxostat (0.04)
dexamethasone (0.03) and ruxolitinib (0.03) were comparable to that of placebos (0.03) (Figure 4
and Table 3).

Mor tality
Sixteen trials featuring 16117 participants reported on the number of patients who died of COVID
19 during the trials. Treatment nodes used in the analysis are as follows: colchicine,
hydroxychloroquine, interferon β, ruxolitinib, ribavirin, lopinavir-ritonavir, remdesivir, placebo and
standard care. Ruxolitinib was closely associated with the reduced mortality-rates [(2.24E+13,
20.03-7.78E+45 for placbo and 2.00E+13, 17.9-6.01E+45 for standard care (Table 2)]. Moreover,
rank probability test showed ruxolitinib (rank probability: 0.99) is most likely the safest
intervention against COVID 19 (Figure 4 and Table 3). Other interventions did not inhibited
significant difference in mortality.
Rate of adver se events
Meanwhile 21 trials contained 4198 participants demonstrated the adverse effect is related with
COVID 19 treatment with drugs such as arbidol, azvudine, chloroquine, colchicine, favipiravir,
hydroxychloroquine, interferon β, ruxolitinib, lopinavir-ritonavir, methylprednisolone, remdesivir,
placebo and standard care. As shown in Table 2, moderate certainty evidence showed that compared
with standard care, hydroxychloroquine is significantly linked to the adverse events (OR=6.87,
1.52-41.44). Nonetheless, other drugs did not significantly affect the mortality (P > 0.05). Rank
probability test showed that azvudine (rank probability: 0.97) may be an intervention associated
with least adverse effect. Even so, randomized-controlled trials in patients with COVID-19 has so
far provided little definitive evidence about adverse effects for most interventions (Figure 4 and
Table 3)

Discussion
COVID-19 pandemic is currently the most catastrophic public health emergency in the world, with
the disease agent displaying one of the fastest transmission rates ever recorded. Throughout human
histroty, severe acute respiratory syndrome strain 2 (SARS Cov 2) virus has been the most difficult
infectious agent to control or manage, shown also to cause the most diverse range of complications.
Finding effective and safe treatment is not only the key but also the major challenge in controlling
the pendenmic. There have been numerous investment by research communiy across the world,
exploring the pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19. Continuous reporting on the disease has
elucidated the molecular mechanism and potential infection pathway of COVID-19, offering the
chance for the rationalized use of clinical treatment. However, there is still concern over the
effectiveness and safety of various interventions. Meanwhile, short-term treatment benefits are
averagely minimal, and the balance between long-term benefits and harms is still poorly understood.
Therefore, although clinicians have a wide pool of drugs to select from, however, the best choice
for each patient should be backed by empirical evidence.
Accordingly, this network meta-analysis was performed to understand the relative balance between
merits and potential shortcomings of multiple COVID-19 interventions. In general, 17078
individuals reported in 28 papers were randomly assigned to one of 14 individual drugs against
COVID-19, placebo or standard care. Response of patients to various COVID 19 infections across
the world was obtained thorough search of published reports in any language. The key parameters
of interest were average recovery days, response and mortality rates and rate of occurrence of
adverse events. This provided a solid base to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and
reliability of various drugs against COVID-19. Our analysis found the efficacy of commonly
proposed drugs to be insignificantly indifferent when compared with placebos or standard care.
Moreover, the therapeutic effects of the drugs is always modest. For instance, compared with other
drugs, patients on remdesivir, favipiravir and azvudine exhibited higher recovery rate and lower
occurance of adverse events, though statistically insignificant. By contrast, compared with other

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.16.20232884; this version posted November 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this

drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are not effective against COVID 19, and thus, may not
be a first choice in the clinic. On the other hand, this meta-analysis demonstrated that compared
with other interventions, ruxolitinib is associated with lower mortality rate, but the curative effect
and other benefits of this drug in patients with COVID 19 remains unclear. In addition, according to
a randomized-controlled trial, hydroxychloroquine did not reduce COVID 19-associated mortalities,
and moreover, promoted the occurrence of adverse events. In general, so far there is no sufficient
evidence demonstrated that the proposed COVID 19 drugs have improved eficacy and safety
compared with placebo or standard care.
Our findings notwithstanding, this report has several limitations. First, the study focused on
hospitalized patients, thus it may have suffered a possible selection bias. Therefore, it is not clear
how asymptomatic individuals with a positive nucleic acid test result or mild COVID 19 symptoms
would respond to the proposed drugs. Second, given we included trials from the whole world, the
majority of studies involved in this meta-analysis were basically on Chinese population, thus further
universal studies should be reviewed. Meanwhile, the heterogeneity between studies included in this
report is critical. Sources of heterogeneity included broad inclusion criteria, differences in clinical
trial design, patient cooperation and measurement of outcome. Additionally, differences in
individual samples with regard to severity of the disease, intervention time, age and gender
composition may have contributed to heterogeneity. Thus given the significant heterogeneity
between studies related to COVID-19, our findings should be interpreted with caution, random
effect model notwithstanding13.
Despite these limitations, this network meta-analysis provides preliminary understanding on current
COVID-19 treatment. In this report, we first conducted a comprehensive search in five databases
including Cochrane, EmBase, PubMed and Web of Science, incorperating a relative a large sample
of COVID 19 patients across the world. Although the reports on several drugs such as colchicine
are limited, findings of this study may still provide a preliminary reflection of their safety and
efficacy. In addition, selection, inclusion and data extraction were performed by two independent

researchers, thus minimized the selection bias and strenthened the reliability of the results.
Aditionally, all included studies were tested for publication bias through sensitity analysis. The
elaborate comparison of advantages of interventions against COVID 19 fully recognizes the
inherent limitations of the method used in this study, the complexity of the patient population and
the uncertainty caused by the choice of dosage and treatment.
So far, there is no safe and effective drug against COVID-1914. Meanwhile vaccination is seen as
the most effective approach to control the spread of the viral. However, vaccine development is an
entirely challenging process. Therefore, before successful development and popularization of
effective vaccines against COVID 19, drugs remain the most effective method against the global
pendemic15. Current therapeutics include antiviral drugs (remdesivir, ribavirin, favipiravir,
lopinavir-ritonavir, arbidol etc.), antimalarial drugs (hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine),
glucocorticoid (dexamethasone) and immune modulation drugs (interferon-β). Our results
demonstrated favipiravir, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, may be a potential effective drug
against COVID-19. Pathologically, coronavirus infection can induce an imbalance of immune
regulation network via cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) and diffuse damage to target cells such as
alveolar epithelial cells16. This results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock,
multiple organ dysfunction and even death. Notably, compared with placebos and standard care,
immune modulation drugs such as interferon-β increases the mortality of patients with COVID 19
infection. One possible reason is that immune agents may aggravate the degree of immune
imbalance, thus causing death. Our findings are thus instructive for selecting the most effective
intervention of managing COVID-19 patients. When implemented, our findings will rationalize
clinical decisions among COVID-19 patients.

Figur e 3. The network of eligible comparisons for the four outcomes. (a). average recovery days; (b). response rate; (c). Mortality; (D). rate of adverse events.
Each cycle represented an intervention drug, the width of the connection lines is proportional to the number of trials comparing every pair of treatments, and the
size of every circle is proportional to the number of randomly assigned participants.

Table 2. Directly compare the results of 14 drugs, placebo and standard therapies. Compared with the row definition process, the data is the SMD or RR (95%
CI) of the column definition process. In the average recovery day, if the SMD is greater than 1, the column definition processing takes precedence. For the
remission rate, mortality and the incidence of adverse events, RR less than 0 is beneficial to define the treatment. In order to get the reverse comparison of RR,
you need to take the inverse number. Important results are shown in bold.
