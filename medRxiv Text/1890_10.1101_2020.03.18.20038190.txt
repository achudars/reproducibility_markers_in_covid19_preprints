ABSTRACT
Background
Although a number of antiviral agents have been evaluated for coronaviruses there are no
approved drugs available. To provide an overview of the landscape of therapeutic research for
COVID-19, we conducted a review of registered clinical trials.
Methods
A review of currently registered clinical trials was performed on registries, including the
Chinese (chictr.org.cn) and US (clinicaltrials.gov) databases to identify relevant studies up to
March, 7th 2020. The search was conducted using the search terms “2019-nCoV”, “COVID19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “Hcov-19”, “new coronavirus”, “novel coronavirus”. We included
interventional clinical trials focusing on patients with COVID-19 and assessing antiviral drugs
or agents.
Findings
Out of the 353 studies identified, 115 clinical trials were selected for data extraction. Phase IV
trials were the most commonly reported study type (n=27, 23%). However, 62 trials (54%) did
not describe the phase of the study. Eighty percent (n=92) of the trials were randomized with
parallel assignment and the median number of planned inclusions was 63 (IQR, 36-120).
Open-label studies were the most frequent (46%) followed by double-blind (13%) and single
blind studies (10%). The most frequently assessed therapies were: stem cells therapy (n=23
trials), lopinavir/ritonavir (n=15), chloroquine (n=11), umifenovir (n=7), hydroxychloroquine
(n=7), plasma treatment (n=7), favipiravir (n=7), methylprednisolone (n=5), and remdesivir
(n=5). Remdesivir was tested in 5 trials with a median of 400 (IQR, 394-453) planned inclusions
per trial, while stem cells therapy was tested in 23 trials, but had a median of 40 (IQR, 23-60)
planned inclusions per trial. Lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with the highest total number of
planned inclusions (2606) followed by remdesivir (2155). Only 52% of the clinical trials reported
the treatment dose (n=60) and only 34% (n=39) the duration. The primary outcome was clinical
in 76 studies (66%), virological in 27 (23%); radiological in 9 (8%) or immunological in three
studies (3%).
Interpretation
Numerous clinical trials have been registered since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak,
however, a number of information regarding drugs or trial design were lacking.

MANUSCRIPT
INTRODUCTION
On December 31st, 2019, the first suspected cases of an epidemic of viral pneumonia of
unknown aetiology were reported in the city of Wuhan, China. Patients were linked to Huanan
market, selling fish and other live animals. On January 7th, 2020 the Chinese health authorities
and the World Health Organization (WHO) officially announced the discovery of a novel
coronavirus, currently called SARS-CoV-2.1 The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been
named COVID-19. On January 30th, WHO declared the epidemic a Public Health Emergency
of International Concern (PHEIC). On March 11th, WHO characterized COVID-19 as a
pandemic. Up to March the 18th, more than 200,000 cases of COVID-19 and more than 8,000
deaths have been reported in the world. The COVID-19 epidemic is unique because of its
scale, the speed of its spread, the lack of pre-existing scientific data and the importance of
media and scientific coverage.2 The scientific and public health community have responded
with early publication of clinical data and predictions of spread and guidance for effective
containment.3,4 Alongside, and critically, health professionals need to find effective and safe
treatment for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Why is this review needed?
Although a number of drugs have been evaluated for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV there are no
approved therapeutic agents available for coronaviruses. Integrating clinical trials of
experimental therapeutics is an increasingly recognized part of the response during infectious
disease outbreaks. Since the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and subsequent outbreaks in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, clinical trials of investigative drugs have been fully integrated
in the epidemic response.5–7 The COVID-19 pandemic is unique because of its scale, the
speed of its spread, the lack of pre-existing scientific data and the importance of media and
scientific coverage.2 To encourage the development of clinical trials that test therapeutics
against SARS-CoV-2, the WHO has suggested a number of candidate antiviral agents that
have to be tested in clinical trials.8 Concomitantly, numerous clinical trials have been registered
since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak numerous to evaluate therapeutic strategies for
this disease.
In the epidemic context, it is crucial for clinicians and researchers to have access to rapid and
quality information on clinical trials that the various teams around the world are setting up. The
results will inform about the antiviral agents that are used, their dosing and duration, the
inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients, the outcomes that will be evaluated, as well as the
design of the clinical trials.
We believe that it is essential to carry out a review of these early phase clinical trials before
the results are even available in order to best inform the teams wishing to test new therapies,
choose therapeutic candidates or to design clinical trials.
In this review, we aimed to summarize the current state of registered clinical trials for COVID19 in order to study their design, which antiviral agents were being investigated, the details of
their administration, and the outcomes.
METHODS
Search strategy and selection criteria
A search was performed on clinical trial registries of privately and publicly funded clinical trials
worldwide. We selected the following clinical trial registries: U.S. (https://clinicaltrials.gov/),
Chinese
(www.chictr.org.cn/),
Korean
(https://cris.nih.go.kr/cris/en/),
Iranian
(https://www.irct.ir/),
Japanese
(https://rctportal.niph.go.jp/en/),
and
European
(https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/). We chose these locations as they were the ones with

the highest number of cases at the time of extraction. We added the WHO clinical trial registry
(http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/) and the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial
Number (ISRCTN) Registry, recognized by the WHO and the International Committee of
Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). A first search was conducted on February 28th, 2020 on all
registries listed above to capture the studies registered from November 2019; and an updated
search was conducted on March 7th, 2020 on clinicaltrials.gov to capture additional studies
registered since February 28th. Our search strategy was designed to identify all the clinical
trials using antiviral agents that were registered for COVID-19. The following search terms
were used for our search to capture relevant studies: “2019-nCoV”, “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV2”, “Hcov-19”, “new coronavirus”, “novel coronavirus”. Data extracted from selected studies
included study design, sponsorship, population, outcomes, and inclusion/exclusion criteria.
The eligibility criteria were developed using the Patient Intervention Comparison Outcomes
Study type (PICOS) framework9.
Inclusion criteria were:
 Population: patients with COVID-19,
 Intervention/Comparator: any antiviral agent or drug. We excluded trials evaluating
traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy, dietary supplements, and therapeutic
strategies whose description was not sufficient to identify a specific drug.
 Outcomes: any outcomes,
 Study type: interventional clinical trial.
We excluded traditional Chinese medicine and homeopathy as we have no expertise to
analyse clinical trials testing these agents that rely on controversial concepts.10,11 Dietary
supplements were also excluded as their potential in treating COVID-19 seems limited.
Definitions
We considered clinical trials between those planning to include only patients with severe
diseases, those planning to include patients with moderate diseases and those planning to
include both. We defined severe patients as patients requiring either non-invasive ventilation,
high flow oxygen devices or invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO). Patients with moderate pneumonia were patients who did not require
these. Studies were further analysed according to the primary endpoint, that could be clinical,
virological (viral excretion in clinical samples), radiological (imaging results such as CT-scan
or X-rays), or immunological (CD8+/CD4+ T cells count, IFN-gamma measurement results).
RESULTS
Number of studies
Our search identified 353 studies, and 115 clinical trials were selected for data extraction in
the review (Figure 1). Among the 238 excluded studies, 125 were trials that did not focus on
an intervention of interest, e.g. traditional Chinese medicine, and 81 were not interventional
clinical trials. Among the 115 included clinical trials, 39 were registered on the US clinical trial
registry and 76 on the Chinese clinical trial registry. Sponsorship was not systematically
reported in the Chinese clinical trial registry preventing us from accurately analysing private or
public sponsorship. We found one trial with planned inclusions in the USA (NCT04280705)
while the others recruited patients in China but data were lacking in many trials.
Population and severity of disease
Children were included in two clinical trials in China, one testing darunavir with cobicistat
(without age precision, NCT04252274) and one on human menstrual blood-derived stem cells
(1 to 99 years old, ChiCTR2000029606). Six other planned to recruit patients aged over 15:
one testing lopinavir/ritonavir and favipiravir plus alpha-Interferon atomization

(ChiCTR2000029600); one hydroxycholoroquine (ChiCTR2000029740); one convalescent
plasma treatment (ChiCTR2000029850); one recombinant human granulocyte-colony
stimulating factor (G-CSF) (ChiCTR2000030007); one favipiravir (ChiCTR2000030113), and
one human mesenchymal stem cells (ChiCTR2000030138). All the registered trials excluded
pregnant women. The trials were evenly divided between the patients with moderate
pneumonia (n=29, 25%), moderate or severe pneumonia (n=57, 50%), and severe pneumonia
(n=29, 25%; Table 1).
Studies design
Phase IV trials were the most commonly reported study type (n=27, 23%; Table 1) before
phase II (n=13, 14%) and phase III (n=9, 8%). However, most of the registered trials did not
describe the phase of the study (n=62, 54%). Regarding blinding, we found 53 open-label
studies (46%), 15 double-blind (13%), and 11 single-blind (10%). The vast majority of trials
were randomized (n=92, 80%) with a parallel assignment between arms. The median (IQR)
number of planned inclusions was 63 (36-120) with a range of 9 to 600 participants.
Treatments
Various treatments were evaluated in the clinical trials, the most frequently evaluated ones are
described in Table 2. Only 52% of the clinical trials reported the treatment dose (n=60) and
only 34% (n=39) the duration. A table with the detailed combination therapies and the
identification of each clinical trial is available in the Supplementary material. Figure 2 reports
the number of trials by the median of the total number of planned inclusions per trial for the ten
most frequent therapies (stem cells therapy, lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine phosphate,
hydroxychloroquine,
favipiravir,
umifenovir,
plasma
treatment,
remdesivir,
methylprednisolone, oseltamivir). Remdesivir was tested in only 5 trials, but these trials had
the highest median number of planned inclusions per trial (400, IQR 394-453). At the other
end of the spectrum, stem cells therapy was associated with the highest number of trials (23
trials), but with a small median number of planned inclusions per trial (40, IQR 23-60). Figure
3 shows the total number of planned inclusions and the number of clinical trials for the ten
most frequently assessed treatments. Lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with the highest total
number (2606) followed by remdesivir (2155) and umifenovir (1705).
Endpoints
The primary outcome was clinical in 76 studies (66%; Table 1), most of them focused on the
evolution of the symptoms such as the time to clinical recovery, the proportion of patients with
clinical improvement or deterioration, the length of hospitalization or the mortality. A number
of scores were used as a primary outcome such as the ordinal 7-point scale adapted from
WHO master protocol8 (10 studies), the lung injury score12 (4 studies), the pneumonia severity
index13 (3 studies) or the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) 2 score (2 studies).14 In other
studies, the primary outcome was either virological in 27 studies (23%), radiological in nine
studies (8%) or immunological in three studies (3%).
DISCUSSION
Based on the evidence available up to March 7th, 2020, stem cells therapy and lopinavirritonavir were the most frequently evaluated candidate therapies in terms of number of trials
(23 and 15 trials respectively), whereas remdesivir was associated with the highest median
number of planned inclusions per trial (400, IQR 394-453)) for 5 trials only.
This review of ongoing clinical trials assessing COVID-19 treatments shows the important
amount of research that is currently being conducted on this topic. However, although the
number of trials identified is high, there are a number of caveats.

First, numerous treatments have been selected based on various levels of supporting
preclinical data. Most of the agents evaluated in clinical trials have shown an in vitro antiviral
activity, sometimes including coronaviruses. Lopinavir/ritonavir is tested in 15 clinical trials in
this review. This combination has shown an in vitro activity against SARS-CoV in several
studies15 and appears to have activity against MERS-CoV in animal studies16. The use of this
agent for treatment of COVID-19 has been described in case reports17,18 and in a case series
of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore.19 We found 18 clinical trials evaluating
hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, whose mechanism of action is similar.20 The in
vitro antiviral activity of chloroquine has been known for a long time21 and was described on a
number of viruses including SARS-CoV.22 However, chloroquine failed to demonstrate a
benefit in the treatment of viral diseases such as influenza, dengue or chikungunya.23–25
Regarding COVID-19, a recent publication reported an activity of chloroquine on SARS-CoV226 and another encouraged the use of chloroquine for patients with COVID-19 on the basis of
unreported clinical results.27 Experts in China have suggested the use of chloroquine for
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 but no clinical data has been provided yet to support this
announcement.28,29 Remdesivir is evaluated in 5 clinical trials but with the highest median
number of planned inclusions per trial. Studies in vitro in human airway epithelial cell assays
demonstrated that remdesivir inhibits replication of coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV.30 In
mouse infection models, remdesivir had therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV and MERSCoV.30,31 In a recent non-human primate study, remdesivir treatment initiated 12 hours post
inoculation with MERS-CoV provided clinical benefit with a reduction in clinical signs, reduced
virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions.32,33 The
rationale of using stem cell therapy is based on its immunomodulatory properties that could be
interesting in severe COVID-19.34,35 However, stem cell-based therapies have not
demonstrated an effect in treating other viral diseases and the scientific background to test
them is weak. The fact that stem cell therapy, that has not shown any effect in antiviral
diseases, was one of the most frequently assessed therapies is unexpected. This highlights
the fact that researchers should strive to conduct clinical trials with the most promising
candidates, according to in vitro and preclinical in vivo scientific data.
Second, data is often lacking regarding study designs and on the treatment being assessed,
such as the dose and duration. This restricts the information available for researchers and
potentially delay the finding of successful treatments. Third, most of the trials planned including
a low number of patients, which reduces the robustness of the future results of those clinical
trials. Although, these numbers should be taken with caution as they only represent an
anticipated number of inclusions for each trial and not the actual number of patients included.
Fourth, primary outcomes were very heterogeneous in the clinical trials. The use of clinical
outcomes should be encouraged in a disease for which we do not know the association
between viral clearance, radiological or immunological evolution and clinical status.
Due to the pandemic context associated with COVID-19, the number of clinical trials registered
is increasing day after day. A previous review conducted up to February 18th, 2020 found 74
clinical trials evaluating antiviral agents or drugs.36 Our review adds to this evidence by
screening a larger number of clinical trial registries and reporting the studies design,
randomization, allocation, and number of planned inclusions as well as treatment dose,
duration, disease severity, and primary outcomes used.
This important amount of work conducted by researchers is encouraging for the therapeutic
research for this new disease. However, care should be taken when designing a clinical trial
in this complicated context as robust results are needed in order to be able to find the
appropriate treatment. Finding the best agents for rapid implementation in clinical trials for a
new outbreak is challenging. Our study underlines the need to register as much details as
possible on clinical trials registries during outbreaks in order to inform the development of
future trials. The scientific background supporting the use of a treatment should be clear and

detailed as much as possible. The dose and duration of drugs evaluated, as well as details on
the study design, the population of interest and the primary outcome, are crucial elements that
have to be shared in the context of the epidemic response. Reporting as much details as
possible is key to have consistent clinical trials and to enhance the reproducibility of the results,
especially as studies are more often associated with a low number of planned inclusions and
composite or weak outcomes that can limit the efficacy assessment of the treatments. That is
why transparency and consistency are crucial when reporting clinical trials in order to improve
statistical power by conducting, for example, meta-analyses.
The development of clinical trials during an outbreak is an adaptive process and new evidence
is produced at an impressive rate. A review of the strategies that are already registered in
official clinical registries of clinical trials is an important asset for researchers and
methodologists. These results might inform the adaptation of existing clinical trials and the
development of additional trials.
