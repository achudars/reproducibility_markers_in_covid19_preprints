Abstract
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has grown up to be a pandemic within a short span of
time. To investigate transmission dynamics and then determine control methodology, we took
epidemic in Wuhan as a study case. Unfortunately, to our best knowledge, the existing models are
based on the common assumption that the total population follows a homogeneous spatial
distribution, which is not the case for the prevalence occurred both in the community and in
hospital due to the difference in the contact rate. To solve this problem, we propose a novel
epidemic model called SEIR-HC, which is a novel epidemic model with two different social
circles. Using the model alongside the exclusive optimization algorithm, the spread process of
COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan city is reproduced and then the propagation characteristics and
unknown data are estimated. Furthermore, the control measures implemented in Wuhan are
assessed and the control methodology of COVID-19 is discussed to provide guidance for limiting
the epidemic spread.
Key word: COVID-19, transmission dynamics, non-linear optimization, SEIR-HC model,
prevention and control.

1. Introduction
A total of 113,702 confirmed cases have been reported worldwide as of 10:00 CET on Mar.

human in the world. Many factors, including human connectivity, urbanization, as well as
international travel, present global challenges for disease prevention and its spread control [4].

However, modeling the transmission dynamics of epidemic is still a challenging task. A
prime cause is the difficulty in obtaining the reliable data for the required data is patchy, delayed,
and even wrong [1, 2, 5, 6]. The second cause is that the epidemic transmission scarcely occurs in
the absence of interventions. Life activities and travel, which are tightly linked to the spread of
infection, make the case more complex. The last but not least reason is that there are too many
incidences, which cannot be ignored anyhow, happened in hospital where the contact rate is
entirely different from that in the community. All of those pose difficulties for the general
epidemic models to work. Additional problem encountered here is related to optimal estimation of
the parameters of the epidemic model [8].
In order to probe the propagation characteristics and transmission mechanism, several
attempts have been done on modeling the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19, using
observations of the index case in Wuhan[2, 5-7, 9]. Unfortunately, the results are different and
even contradictory. Moreover, there is no comparison of model output with real-world
observations. Such a comparison is necessary to establish the performance of the models. In
addition, the models fail to consider the difference of contact rate between in communities and in
hospitals. This may limit the accuracy of the proposed models and hence the reliability of results.
To resolve this problem, this paper presents a novel epidemic model, which based on the
standard assumption: the population is divided into susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), and
recovered (R) groups[11]. The model proposed here, referred to as SEIR-HC for simplicity,
extends the susceptible–exposed-infectious–removed (SEIR) model to handle epidemic
transmission in two different but coupled social circles. Moreover, a two-step optimization is built
for the parameter estimation.
Furthermore, with the limited data, transmission process of COVID-19 in Wuhan city
reproduced by the proposed model. Then, the propagation characteristics and unreported data are
estimated, and the end time of COVID-19 is also predicted. In the end, the control measures
implemented in Wuhan are assessed and the control methodology of COVID-19 is discussed to
provide guidance to cease the COVID-19 outbreak.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the previous work;
Section 3 defines the related terminology; Section 4 explains the SEIR-HC model in detail;
Section 5 describes the two-step optimization for parameter estimation; Section 6 shows the
analysis results, and finally, Section 7 states the conclusions.

2. Previous work
Transmission dynamics of an epidemic disease have long been a topic of active research. In
1866, Farr[12] mathematically described the cattle-plague epidemic by means of curve fitting
method. In 1889, P. D. En’ko presented a discrete-time model in which the population consists of
infectious individuals and susceptible individuals[13]. In 1906, Hamer[14] proposed that the
incidence depends on the product of the densities of the susceptibles and infectives. The
susceptible–infectious–removed (SIR) model was formulated by Martini in 1921[15, 16]. In 1927,
Kermack and McKendrick [17] investigated the SIR model in a homogeneous population by using
differential equations and discovered that the epidemic course would inevitably be terminated
once the density of population becomes smaller than a critical threshold. Stone et al.[18] analyzed
the rationale of the pulse vaccination strategy with the SIR model.

The SIR model is ideally suited to describe the process of virus spread. However, it is not
always congruent with epidemic course. Some infections do not confer any long lasting immunity.
In this case, one should resort to the SIS model, in which the infectious becomes susceptible again,
rather than recovered. The SIS model has many potential applications such as modeling the spread
behavior of computer viruses[19]. On the other hand, if the epidemic lasts for a very long time,
births and deaths heavily affect the population size. So, Hethcote [20] considered births and deaths
in the deterministic models of SIS and SIR.
On account of the fact that the SIS and SIR model only hold for the case without a latent
period, which is not the case for many kinds of infectious diseases. To alleviate this problem,
Cooke[21] proposed an epidemic model for the case that after a fixed time the infected
susceptibles can get infectious. In this model, the population is divided into four classes of
individuals: susceptibles, exposed individuals, infectives and recovered individuals. Such an
epidemic model is known as the SEIR model. Later, Longini[22] presented a general formulation
of the discrete-time epidemic model with permanent immunity. Lipsitch et al.[23] estimated the
infectiousness of SARS and likelihood of an outbreak with modified SEIR model. Krylova and
Earn[16] found that the dynamical structures of SEIR models have a less effect on the stage
duration distribution, relative to that of the SIR models.
During the disease spread, a considerable degree of chance enters into the conditions under
which fresh infections take place. Therefore, statistical fluctuations should be taken into account
for a more precise analysis[24]. For this reason, Bailey[25] introduced probability distribution into
the SIS epidemic model. In the standard models, the incubation and infectious periods are
typically assumed to be exponential distribution, which makes the model sensitive to stochastic
fluctuations[11, 26]. Because of more robustness, Weibull distribution is used to investigate severe
acute respiratory syndrome by Marc Lipsitch et al [23].
For the stochastic case, even the simplest representations present difficulties in obtaining
algebraic solutions[8]. To address this issue, Saunders[27] constructed an approximate maximum
likelihood estimator for the chain SEIR model by using the Poisson approximation to the Binomial
distribution. See [13] and[28] for an extensive review of classic epidemic models.
Indeed, a family of SEIR models is being used to support epidemic control, elimination, and
eradication efforts. Recently, Wu et al. [7] provided an estimate of the size of the COVID-19
epidemic based on the SEIR model. Using an assumption of Poisson-distributed daily time
increments, Read et al.[9] fitted a deterministic SEIR model to the daily number of confirmed
cases in Chinese cities and cases reported in other countries/regions. Zhao et al.[6] estimated the
number of unreported cases in mainland China based on the assumption that the initial growth
phase followed an exponential growth pattern.
To sum up, a number of models have been proposed to formulate the transmission process of
epidemic disease, which lay a good foundation for our work. Unfortunately, none of these studies
have been done on the epidemic transmission under two different but coupled conditions. A
mathematical model, relating to the processes, is desired to explore, anticipate, understand, and
predict the effects of feedbacks within such complex systems, including changes caused by
intervention.

(14) Incidence rate: rate of new infections[31], or, more precisely, total number of exposed
individuals who move into infective class in unit time;
(15) Death rate: the death probability of a person per day on average [17].

4. SEIR-HC epidemic model
The basic principle is that if the model is tightly close to the real world, then the optimization
algorithm will converge to the most reasonable solution. Based on this idea, we build a new SEIR
model with intervention mechanism which takes two different social circles into consideration.

4.1 Assumptions
The usefulness of a mathematical model depends on the existence of its solution[8]. For real
world applications, a mathematical model of a complex physical situation tends to involve a
certain amount of simplification. However, a suitable simplification is not straightforward to
obtain a balance between simplicity and practicality. To resolve this dilemma, generality of
epidemic and particularity of COVID-19 are considered simultaneously and then a set of
assumptions are determined carefully as follows.
(1) The population is homogeneous and uniformly mixed [21, 30, 32].
(2) Recovered individuals are permanently immune and newborn infants have temporary
passive immunity to the infection [28].
(3) Infectiousness remains constant during an infectious period[28].
(4) The natural disease-independent death rate is constant throughout the population[26].
(5) The disease-caused death rate is a time-independent constant.
(6) Latent period and infectious period follow Weibull distribution[23], which is a versatile
distribution that has the ability to take on the characteristics of other types of distribution.
(7) Contact rate is constant over the entire infectious period [22].
(8) The first index case is infected on Dec 1, 2019 [7].
(9) Travel behavior was not affected by disease before lockdown on Jan 23,2020[7].

following expressions. The variables without the indices c and h mean they are applicable in both
cases.

4.3 Formulating SEIR-HC epidemic model
From classical SEIR model, the population is roughly classified as four classes: susceptible,
exposed, infectious, and recovered individuals. Among them, exposed and infectious individuals
fall into a series of groups according to disease progression in our work so that the Weibull
distribution, which armed with high generalization capability[33], can match accurately number of
individuals and duration time.
In order to accommodate the quarantine and isolation measures, the standard SEIR structure
was modified, as shown in Fig. 2. Note that the size of population is varied with control measures
and may be affected by the inbound and outbound travellers.
For the individuals in hospital and community, disease transmissions are different in infection
pattern but share the common features of the virus. For this reason, two populations are analyzed
separately for the sake of accuracy. With the reservations mentioned in Section 4.1, we used the
SEIR-HC model to simulate the epidemic process in Wuhan. From the rules of node dissemination,
the dynamic transfer equations of the SEIR-HC model are stated as follows.

Given contact rate 𝛼, 𝛼𝑆(𝑡) /𝑁(𝑡) is the average number of susceptibles with which per
infective contacts in unit time, and thus 𝛼𝑆(𝑡) 𝐼(𝑡) /𝑁(𝑡) is the total number of susceptibles with
which 𝐼(𝑡) infectives contacts in unit time (i.e., the total number of new infections in unit time).
Notice that the population of Wuhan city was dramatically reduced from 14 million to 9 million
before lockdown on the morning of Jan 23, 2020. On the day, the preventive and control measures
of category A infectious diseases were implemented to fight against COVID-19. Therefore, we
assume that 𝑁𝑐(𝑡) , 𝑆𝑐(𝑡) , 𝐸𝑐(𝑡) , 𝐼𝑐(𝑡) , 𝑅𝑐(𝑡) decrease proportionately by 5/14 and then the number of
susceptibles became 5𝜁𝑁𝑐(𝑡) /14 for restrictions on outdoor activities on the same day. We further
assume that the disease-independent death rate 𝜈 is 1.50959 × 10;5, which is the same as that
reported by the Wuhan government in December 2019[34]. According to the data presented by Wu
et al[7], 𝐶𝑖𝑛 , 𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑡 are set to 490,856, 505,646 before Jan 10, 814,046, 720,859 from Jan 11 to Jan

Depending on the data provided by Li et al (in Fig. 3), there are no more than 5 new cases every
day from Dec 8 to Dec 28. At the same time, the basic reproduction number of the COVID-19 in
Wuhan must be more than 1 or else the outbreak is impossible[23, 35]. In addition, a susceptible
can be infected within 15 seconds of standing next to an infective. For these reasons, it is highly
probable that the parameter z, which reflects the force of infection of the Huanan Seafood Market,
is small and hence let z=1. Obviously, if let 𝜉 = 0, then SEIR-HC is easy to degrade into the
SEIR model.
As defined in Equation (6), the number of susceptibles in hospital is equal to the number of
infectives stayed in hospital. In fact, 𝜉𝐼𝑐(𝑡) + 𝐼ℎ(𝑡) in (6) is substituted by the number of the
hospitalized patients in Wuhan city, which is reported by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission
(WMHC)[36] and Health Commission of Hubei Province(HCHP)[37]. In addition, the execution
of (12) and (13) is a time-consuming process. So, they are reformulated by

5. Solution of parameters
In this section, we propose a solution based on constraint optimization to estimate the
parameters of the SEIR-HC model mentioned in Section 4.

5.1 Objective function
The epidemic model is devised to estimate the unobserved variables and to predict the
transmission process. The output data of the model is desired to be close to the real. Unfortunately,
it is difficult for the lack of the credible observations. To alleviate this problem, reasonable data is
considered as an alternative. The data collection is completed by integrating multiple data sources:
(1) Number of new cases every day from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 8, 2020, provided by Li et al (in
Fig. 3) [1],

South Korea[40] and Singapore[41]from Jan 29 to Jan 31, 2020 (as tabulated in Table I),

Statistically, the nationals in Wuhan city can be regarded as the samples of population in the
community. The ratio of the cases confirmed during the time from Jan 29 to Jan 31 among
nationals is approximately equal to that on Jan 30. In this sense, the number of infectives is likely
to be about 36880 in Wuhan city on Jan 30.

5.2 Initialization of parameters
The parameter estimation is, in general, a complex task partly due to so many unknown
parameters: 𝜉, 𝜁, 𝛼𝑐 , 𝛼ℎ , 𝑘𝛽 , 𝜆𝛽 , 𝑘𝛾 , 𝜆𝛾 . Correct convergence is hard to reach unless a reliable initial
guess is provided. Therefore, an optimum initial estimation based on knowledge is crucial in this
case. For this reason, all the parameters are dichotomized into two classes. The parameters
𝜉, 𝜁, 𝛼𝑐 , 𝛼ℎ belong to class one and the others class two. Among the first-class parameters, 𝜉, 𝜁
are determined by intervention, 𝛼𝑐 , 𝛼ℎ reflect the combined effect of virus and control. The
second-class parameters are related to the characteristic of the virus.
To estimate the parameters of the first class, we first investigated the implementation of
control measures in Wuhan city. From the report of HCHP[37], we found that an absolute
increment of the number of confirmed infectives was more than 10 thousand on Feb 12, 2020

compared to about one thousand the day before that day. This implies that many patients are likely
to fail to be hospitalized before Feb 12. Taking into account the strict restriction on outdoor
activities imposed before, 𝜉 and 𝜁 are set at 0.8 and 0.2.
The permanent resident population of Wuhan city is about 14 million[34]. Moreover，Wuhan
is well known for being the transport hub of China. The contact rate 𝛼𝑐 was set 3 for the
infectiousness in the community. On the other side, ideally, infections hardly spread in hospital.
But, this is not the case for the inadequacy of medical supplies. And, according to the report of
HCHP, a lot of them had been distributed after Feb 12. From these points under consideration, the
initial contact rate 𝛼ℎ is set equal to 0.05. At the same time, the contact rate is assumed to
decrease by 99% after Feb 12.
With regard to class two, the parameters are relevant to the Weibull PDF of the latent period
and the infectious period. According to the medical records of 138 patients at Zhongnan Hospital
of Wuhan University, the median hospital stay is 10 days[43]. The mean incubation period is 5.2
days[1]. Assuming that the latent period and the infectious period is approximately equal to the
incubation period and the length of stay, the mean values of the latent period and the infectious
period are preliminarily estimated to be 5 and 10 days, respectively. The profiles of the Weibull
PDF with various shape parameters are shown in Fig. 4. As a result, the initial guesses of the
parameters 𝑘𝛽 , 𝜆𝛽 , 𝑘𝛾 , 𝜆𝛾 are 2.4, 5.64, 2.4 and 11.28, respectively.

(b)

Similarly, we determined the low bound and upper bound of the parameters. It is worth
noting that to cut down the domain may not be a good strategy for global optimization since that
may block the way to the global optimal point.

5.3 Two-step iterative optimization
Global solutions are usually difficult to locate, whereas the situation may be improved when
constraints are add [44]. Consequently, an inequality constraint is defined to allow algorithms to
make good choices for search directions. Based on the knowledge that solation and quarantine are
a useful control measures[35], the numbers of exposed and infectious individuals in the presence
of control efforts are consequentially no more than those in the absence of interventions.
Furthermore, we explored a two-step optimization by adopting the sequential quadratic
programming (SQP) method. In theory，if only the mean values of the latent period and the
infectious period are unchanged, the result is almost invariable in number. In this sense, for a
11

given mean value, the second-class parameters only affect the shape of the SEIR-HC model. As a
result, we searched the optimal solution for the first class by the SQP method at first and take that
as the initial guesses of the second class. Then, the second-class parameters are determined by the
same way. The above process is iterated many times. The flow chart is presented in Fig. 5.
In brief, the complete process of the two-step parameter optimization can be divided into four
steps:
(1) Guess all the parameters and their low bound and upper bound as described in Section
5.2.
(2) Estimate the parameters of the first class using the SQP method with the objective
function presented in Section 5.1 and inequality constraints stated in this section.
(3) Estimate the parameters of the second class in the same manner after the estimated values
of the first-class parameters is updated with the result of the second step.
(4) Repeat the computing process from (2) to (4) until the bias is small than a given threshold
value or cycle index reaches 5.

determined for COVID-19 in Wuhan. The low bound, the upper bound, the initial value and the
estimated results are summarized in Table II. All results fall within the range between the upper
and lower limits. Some are close to the initial value, but some far from the guess.

6.2 Epidemiology characteristic of COVID-19
With the parameters estimated, it is easy to derive that the mean and variance of the latent
period are 4.19 and 1.53, and those of the infectious period are 12.53 and 11.40. The Weibull
PDFs of the latent period and the infectious period are shown in Fig.6. It can be observed that a
large proportion of exposed individuals become infectious in a short time and most cases are mild.
The cumulative probability of the latent period for 10 days is up to 99.99%, by which the 14-day
period of active monitoring is well supported. The difference between the latent period and the
incubation period is equal to 1.01 days and the difference between the infectious period and the
length of stay is 2.53 days.

Fig. 6. The Weibull PDFs of the latent period and the infectious period.

It is worth noting that 1 − 𝜉(= 20.1%) infectives, which is equivalent to, on the average,
2.52 days an infective, still stayed in the community before Feb 12. Assuming that the
infectiousness is constant during the entire infectious period, the basic reproduction number is up
to 7.90 where everyone is susceptible. The basic reproduction number estimated here is compared
with others in Table III. Furthermore, even though an infective is hospitalized at the beginning of
clinical symptoms, he still can make 3.48 individuals infected. As a result, the outbreak is
inevitable in the absence of interventions because of difference between the latent period and the
incubation period. Of course, this is not necessary true for districts other than Wuhan city, because
basic reproduction number varies according to population density and social enthusiasm besides
characteristics of pathogenic bacteria [45].

6.3 Transmission process of COVID-19
With the SEIR-HC model proposed here, the transmission process of COVID-19 epidemic in
Wuhan city is reproduced as shown in Fig.7. In our baseline scenario, we estimate that the
outbreak would be over before Apr 15, 2020, and the total of infectives no longer increases by
Mar 15, 2020. At the same time, the total number of removed individuals would reach 111383
finally (as shown in Fig. 7(a)). Among them, the number of hospital staff members would be up to
2950, which is likely to be slightly more than the reported cases due to asymptomatic infection.
The number of the infected individuals in Wuhan on Jan 25, 2020, is estimated to be 46029, which
is less than the count 75815 estimated by Wu et al [7]. The number of infectives on Jan 30 is
35962 (2.52% difference to 36880), which is much higher than 20767 (the number of the infected
individuals estimated by Nishiura et al [5]). Number of infectious hospital staff members on Feb
11 is equal to 1241 (11.87% difference to 1022).
It is readily seen from Fig. 7(b), (c) and (d) that there is a sudden decrease of the number of
the exposed individuals on Jan 23 and on Feb 12, which implies control measures launched have a
conspicuous effect on the infection rate.
Though mathematical models of epidemic transmission often scarce contrast model output
with real-world observations[4], the comparison is necessary to demonstrate the performance of
the models and the validity of the results. For this reason, Fig.8 provides a pictorial display of
comparison of the estimated data and the reported ones. The two curves show the same trend after
Feb 12. But, before that day, the number of infectious individuals estimated here is far more than
that reported by WMHC and HCHP. A probable reason for this is the underreporting of incidences
before Feb 12[1, 2, 5, 6], which may result in an underestimation of basic reproduction number.
From Fig. 8(a), it seems that there is a delay of the estimated number of the removed
individuals relative to the reported. The underlying cause of the delay may be the fact that the
discharge time is later than the end time of infectious period for a need for functional recovery. In
this sense, it appears to be appropriate that the outbreak in Wuhan terminates later than the

expected time. However, the warmer weather is helpful in preventing the virus from reproducing.
Given these points, the outbreak is likely to be ended as we expected before if the control
measures are kept on as usual. Additionally, it also can be observed from Fig. 8(a) that, in the
worst case, up to 33620 infectives failed to be hospitalized on Jan 30.

6.4 Control measures
To assess the control measure, a series of experiments are carried out using the SEIR-HC
model. The control measures are simulated by the first-class parameters and the effect is captured

by the number of infectives.

6.4.1 Effect of control level
Since the proportion of quarantined susceptibles to the total number of susceptibles 1 − 𝜁
implies control level, the function of quarantine is tested by adopting 𝜁. From the SEIR-HC
model, we can see that 𝜁 impacts primarily on the community infection. So, only Ic-t and
(Ic+Rc)-t graphs are shown here for space limitations. Fig. 9(a) shows 𝐼𝑐 varing when 𝜁 increases
from 0.032 to 0.932 and Fig. 9(b) shows 𝐼𝑐 + 𝑅𝑐 . Fig. 9(c) and (d) display the results with a delay
of 0~9 days. It was clear that the number of infectives dramatically increases with the proportion 𝜁
and delay time. As a result, control measures played a key role in prevention of the spread. It also
can be found from Fig. 9 that the resulting divergence begins after Jan 28. Therefore, Jan 23, on
which the measures imposed, is the right time to stop the outbreak.

from Dec 1, 2019, while delay=xd means x days delayed from Jan 23, 2020.

6.4.2 Effect of the time of hospital admission
Given the proportion of hospitalized infectives to total number of infectives 𝜉, 1 − 𝜉 is
equivalent to the proportion of the average time during which infectives stay in the community to
16

the average infectious period, which reflects how quickly the infectives are allowed to hospitalize.
In this section, the effect of the time of hospital admission is test by changing parameter 𝜉. Fig.
10(a) shows that the number of infectives in the community varies with 𝜉 increase and Fig. 10(b)
is the corresponding accumulative value. Fig. 10(c) and (d) depict the case in hospital. The delay
of hospital admission makes an increase in the number of infectives both in the community and in
hospital. However, the increase of the number of infectives slows down when 𝜉 is small enough
due to the depletion of susceptibles in the population. It can be observed from Fig. 10(b) that, as a
result of a large number of inbound travellers every day, the accumulative total of the infectives
can be even more than permanent resident population. In fact, this is almost impossible because
the implicit assumption that travel behavior was not affected by epidemic is not valid.

infectives in hospital at various proportion ξ, (d) accumulative total of infectives in hospital at various
proportion ξ. Note that t indicates the number of days delayed from Dec 1, 2019.

6.4.3 Effect of contact rate 𝜶𝐜
Contact rate is primarily determined by the nature of pathogen. In fact, it can also be changed
in some degree by intervention strategies[23]. Assuming that 𝛼c is varied from 3.3 to 5.1, the
number of infectives in the community varying with 𝛼c is demonstrated in Fig. 11. A clear result
is that the number of infectives in the community increases exponentially with 𝛼c. Note that,
following the same idea mentioned in Section 6.4.1, only the number of infectives in the
community is shown here.

6.4.4 Effect of contact rate 𝜶𝐡
The contact rate 𝛼h partly reflects the prevention level in hospital. From Fig.12, the number
of infectives in hospital increase sharply with 𝛼ℎ .

6.4.5 Control methodology of COVID-19
According to the experimental results, it is easy to find out about the control methodology.
The basic principle is taking measures as early as possible to lower 𝜁, 𝛼c , 𝛼h and to enhance 𝜉.
The control measures of COVID-19 list as follows.
(1) Keeping in home quarantine and reducing travel to lower 𝜁;
(2) Tracing, testing and quarantining the suspected case, immediately isolating symptomatic
individuals and speeding hospital admission to enhance 𝜉;

7. Conclusion
This work provides the SEIR-HC model, a novel SEIR model with two different social
circles, for formulating the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, and a two-step optimization
method exclusively designed for parameter estimation of SEIR-HC model. With the model, the
spread process of COVID-19 is reproduced clearly even without enough observation data. The
latent period, infectious period and basic reproduction number of COVID-19 are estimated to be
4.19, 12.53 and 7.90, respectively. Obviously, COVID-19 is highly transmissible. The outbreak in
Wuhan is anticipated to be over before Apr 15, 2020. The total number of removed individuals
would reach 111383 finally. Among them, the number of hospital staff members would be up to
2950.
According to the SEIR-HC model, the principle of prevention and control of COVID-19 is
taking measures as early as possible to lower 𝜁, 𝛼c , 𝛼h and to enhance 𝜉. A set of measures such
as quarantine have significant impacts on lessening the spread. By the way, an international effort
is required to prevent virus transmission since COVID-19 has spread all over the world.
As a whole, the conclusions are well interpretable and reasonable. As evidenced by the
success in estimation and prediction, the SEIR-HC model is useful. Although the results are based
on the data from Wuhan and hence they are not necessary to be reliable for other cities, the
SEIR-HC model is valid everywhere, which allows us to capitalize on new data streams and lead
to an ever-greater ability to generate robust insight and collectively shape successful local and
global public health policy.
