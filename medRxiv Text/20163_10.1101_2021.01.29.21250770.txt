Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the causing agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic which is responsible for millions of deaths worldwide. The development of the
humoral response to the virus has been the subject of intensive research and
development. A flow cytometry-based assay using native full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike
protein expressed in 293T cells was recently proposed as a complementary seropositivity
determination assay.
The aim of our study was to further develop the flow cytometry assay for potential use as
a confirmatory test and to standardize its parameters and results for reliable interlaboratory use. We have optimized the protocol, established the Receiving Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curve and tested reproducibility using pre-COVID plasma samples
and convalescent, SARS-CoV-2 individual plasma samples.
The flow-based assay was simplified and standardized by cultivating the 293T cells in
suspension and expressing results in Mean Equivalent Soluble Fluorochrome (MESF)
using an internal antibody positive control. The ROC curve was determined with an area
under the curve (AUC) of 0.996 and the assay specificity and sensitivity were established
at 100% and 97.7% respectively. Reproducibility was good as determined on multiple
cytometers, on different days, and with data acquisition as far as 72h post-staining. The
optimized and standardized assay could be used as a high throughput confirmation
confirmatory assay in flow cytometry laboratories involved in serological testing.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused over 2.1 million deaths
worldwide as of January 2021 (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus). It has been
shown that the virus Spike (S) glycoprotein binds the human angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) through its receptor-binding domain (RBD)1,2. Intensive work has been
done since the beginning of the pandemic to develop reliable, sensitive and specific
immunosorbent assays to characterize the humoral response of humans to the virus. The
seropositivity determination allows for seroprevalence studies3, for the characterization of
plasma in the development of convalescent plasma therapy4 and could be used for the
study of the overall antibody responses over time5,6, which include vaccine response
persistence in due time.
Recently, Anand et al. suggested an innovative flow cytometry approach using the native
full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein stably expressed by 293T cells (Anand et al.,
Transfusion, 2021, in press)7. This approach circumvents the potential antibody detection
limitations consequential of using RBD peptides for seropositivity determination8. This
protocol also addresses the potential supply chain plastic shortage some country may face
by allowing testing using variable tube formats.
Given that the described flow cytometry assay may be of use in many laboratories
worldwide, we herein propose a simplified and standardized protocol destined to groups
interested in importing the assay within their flow cytometry operations. This paper
presents a standardized protocol in order to import the semi-quantitative assay in a lab, a
proposed Mean Equivalent Soluble Fluorochrome (MESF)-to-control-antibody ratio
approach to interpret the data and the positivity threshold determination and reproducibility
using convalescent donor samples. Overall, this adaptation should facilitate the integration
of such a technique in any flow laboratory and sets ground for further development.

Material and methods
Plasma samples
Pre-COVID plasmas were obtained during regular blood donations in the province of
Quebec, Canada, before December 20th 2019. It is assumed that the disease was absent

from this area before this date. Convalescents plasmas were randomly chosen from adult
participants in the CONCOR-1 study (#NCT04348656) having received an official
diagnosis of COVID-19 by the Québec Provincial Health Authority confirmed by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All patients have been symptomatic without
hospitalisation and free of symptoms for at least two weeks before donation. All donors
gave consent to participate in this research project which was approved by the HémaQuébec Research Ethic Committee.

Spike-expressing 293T cells
The 293T cells stably expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (293T.SARS-CoV-2
Spike) were previously described (Anand et al., Transfusion, 2021, in press)7. The cells,
as well as non-transformed 293T control cells, were adapted to suspension culture in 293
SFM II medium (ThermoFisher #11686029) as per manufacturer protocol.

Staining and flow cytometry analysis
A detailed protocol is provided as supplementary material. Briefly, a mix of 293T-SARSCoV-2 Spike stable cell line and 293T control cells were stained with an anti-RBD CR3022
monoclonal Ab (50 ng/ml) (graciously provided by A. Finzi) as control or plasma (1:400
dilution) for 20 minutes at room temperature. Optimal plasma dilution was determined by
titration curve (Supplemental Data). After washing, AlexaFluor-647-conjugated goat antihuman IgG+IgA+IgM Abs (Jackson Immunoresearch 109-605-064) diluted 1:400 (final
concentration of 3.75 µg/ml) was used as detection antibody for 20 minutes at room
temperature. Optimal antibody concentration was determined by titration curve
(Supplemental Data). After washing, samples were fixed for 10 minutes in formaldehyde
2% in DPBS before being centrifuged and resuspended in DPBS-BSA 0.2% (BD 554657).
Data acquisition was done on Accuri C6 flow cytometers. Results were transformed in
Alexa Fluor 647 MESF using a standard curve from beads stained with a known quantity
of fluorochrome (Quantum MESF Alexa Fluor 647, Bang Laboratories, #647)
(Supplemental Data). Results were reported as the ratio of the sample MESF on the
CR3022 control MESF.
Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were done using R 4.0.3, using package OptimalCutpoints 1.1-49 .The
determination of the optimal seropositivity threshold was based on the Youden’s index.

Results
The distribution of results expressed as MESF to CR3022 control antibody ratio from the
plasma of N=56 pre-COVID donors and of N=44 convalescent donors is shown in Figure
1A. The data obtained from the assay show a clear separation of anti-S negative and
positive groups. The means of MESF ratio were 0.30 ± 0.14 and 13.95 ± 14.39 for preCOVID and convalescent samples respectively. In order to assess the performance of the
test as a classifier for COVID-19 antibodies presence and determine a positivity threshold,
we established a Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (Figure 1B). The area
under the curve (AUC) of 0.996 indicates excellent discrimination between negative and
positive samples. The optimal threshold point of 1.1 determined from Younden’s index has
a sensitivity of 97.7% (IC95: 88,0% - 99,9%) and a specificity of 100% (IC95: 93,6% 100%). Therefore, a MESF ratio greater or equal to 1.1 relative to CR3022 50ng/ml is
considered to be indicative of seropositivity (Figure 1A, dashed grey line).

(0.30 and 13.95 for negative and positive groups respectively). (B) ROC curve (green) and
optimal threshold point determined by Youden’s index. The red dashed line is the line of
no discrimination.
In order to validate the standardized protocol, the reproducibility was evaluated by
analyzing samples on three different Accuri C6 flow cytometers, on two different days
(Figure 2A). The mean CV of 0.070 supports highly reproducible results. In order to
accommodate higher volume of testing and more flexibility, the post-staining stability was
evaluated by analyzing samples stored at 4°C in the dark after 24h and 72h (Figure 2B).
The mean CV of 0.023 suggests that samples can be analyzed up to 72h after staining
without any loss of signal, and therefore, allows for an extended sample preparation period
before acquisition.

cytometers (identified as FC1, FC2 and FC3) on two different days (Day1 and Day2).

immediately (0h), 24h and 72h after staining.

Discussion
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has accelerated the development of many serodiagnostic
platforms and inspired the establishment of alternative methods of analysis to circumvent
some technical and/or supply chain challenges, such as the flow cytometry-based assay
to detect SARS-CoV-2 Spike specific antibodies described by Anand et al. (Transfusion,
2021, in press)7. In this study, we report a protocol optimization regarding the cell culture
in suspension and the quantitative measurements using a ratio of MESF and of an internal
control, and propose standardization steps to facilitate the implementation of the method
in any flow cytometry laboratory. In addition, we present the positivity threshold
determination by comparing non-COVID-19 to confirmed-COVID-19 samples and
describe how sensitive (97.7%) and specific (100%) the flow cytometry assay is. Finally,
with the suggested standardization steps, we support the potential use of this flow assay
as a quick and potentially high throughput confirmation test in a non-clinical setting.
Given our understanding of the challenges associated with flow cytometry and our
experience in inter-laboratory standardization of flow assays10, we ought to provide the
community with a standardized baseline which could be adapted for further
characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 humoral response. For example, laboratories who
only have residual or low sample volume could adapt this assay to measure the
IgG1/2/3/4, IgA and IgM distinct response all within one tube using multiple fluorescent
antibodies. Also, while using 293T cells in suspension facilitated cell culture and time
management, our adaptation only allows for about 20 samples to be done from start to
finish, by one technician, during a regular day. This capacity suited our testing requirement
as we mostly used the technique to resolve unclear, near threshold ELISA results.
Laboratories who require a higher throughput could setup an automated sampler protocol
on their flow cytometer, and/or use our described 72 hours post-staining stability to batch
flow cytometry data acquisition. Overall, our study demonstrates that the adapted flow
cytometry assay is robust enough to be used as a seropositivity confirmation assay.
Altogether, our findings set the standardization basis for a SARS-CoV-2 flow cytometry
assay using Spike-expressing transfected 293T cells and confirm the possibility of using
the assay as an indicator of the serological response to the virus.
