Abstract
Background: An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has led to 46,997
confirmed cases as of 13th February 2020. Understanding the early transmission
dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is
crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas.
Methods: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of novel
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in
Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January and
February 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that
newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.
Findings: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number, Rt , declined
from 2.35 (95% CI: 1.15-4.77) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on
23rd January to 1.05 (95% CI: 0.413-2.39) one week after. Based on our estimates of
Rt,we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as Wuhan in
early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a
more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.
Interpretation: Our results show that COVID-19 transmission likely declined in
Wuhan during late January 2020, coinciding with the introduction of control
measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission
potential to Wuhan pre-control, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to
establish initially, but may still cause new outbreaks eventually.

Introduction
As of 13th February 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in 46,997 confirmed
cases (1). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, with
the majority of early cases being reported in the city. The majority of internationally
exported cases reported to date have a travel history to Wuhan (2). In the early stages
of a new infectious disease outbreak, it is crucial to understand the transmission
dynamics of the infection. In particular, estimation of changes in transmission over
time can provide insights into the current epidemiological situation (3) and identify
whether outbreak control measures are having a measurable effect (4,5). Such
analysis can inform predictions about potential future growth (6), help estimate risk to
other countries (7), and guide the design of alternative interventions (8).
There are several challenges to such analysis, however, particularly in real-time.
There can be a delay to symptom appearance resulting from the incubation period and
delay to confirmation of cases resulting from detection and testing capacity (9).
Modelling approaches can account for such delays and uncertainty, by explicitly
incorporating delays resulting from the natural history of infection and reporting
processes (10). In addition, individual data sources may be biased, incomplete, or
only capture certain aspects of the outbreak dynamics. Evidence synthesis
approaches, which fit to multiple data sources rather than a single dataset (or data
point) can enable more robust estimation of the underlying dynamics of transmission
from noisy data (11,12). Combining a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2
transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how
transmission in Wuhan varied between December and February 2020. We then used
these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to
occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases are introduced.
Research in Context
Evidence before this study: We searched PubMed, BioRxiv and MedRxiv for
articles published up to 10th February 2020 using the keywords “2019-nCoV”, “novel
coronavirus”, “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2” AND “reproduction number”, “R0”,
“transmission”. We found several estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0,
including average exponential growth rate estimates based on inferred or observed
cases at a recent time point (13,14) and early growth of the outbreak in China (15,16).
However, we identified no estimates of how R0 had changed in Wuhan since control
measures were introduced in late January, or estimates that jointly fitted to data within
Wuhan with international exported cases and evacuation flights.
Added value of this study: Our study combines available evidence from multiple
data sources, reducing the dependency of our estimates on a single time point or
dataset. We estimate how transmission has varied over time, identify a decline in the
reproduction number in late January to near 1, coinciding with the introduction of
large scale control measures, and show the potential implications of estimated
transmission for outbreak risk new locations.
Implications of all the available evidence: COVID-19 is currently exhibiting
sustained transmission in China. This creates a substantial risk of outbreaks in other
countries, although if SARS-CoV-2 has MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-like variability in

transmission at the individual-level, multiple introductions may be required before an
outbreak takes hold.
Methods
To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic
transmission dynamic model (17) to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in
Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets we fitted to
were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of
onset, as of 26th January 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market
exposure, by date of onset, between 1st December 2019 and 1st January 2020; daily
number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between 29th December 2019 and
23rd January 2020; proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between
29th January and 4th February 2020. We used an additional two datasets for
comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or
lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (i.e. top 20 most at risk),
by date of confirmation, as of 10th February 2020; data on new confirmed cases
reported in Wuhan between 16th January and 11th February 2020 (full details in the
Appendix).
In the model, individuals were divided into four infection classes (Figure 1):
susceptible, exposed (but not yet infectious), infectious, and removed (i.e. isolated,
recovered or otherwise no longer infectious). The model accounted for delays in
symptom onset and reporting, as well as uncertainty in case observation (see
Appendix for full model details). The incubation period was assumed to be Erlang
distributed with mean 5.2 days (16) and delay from onset-to-isolation Erlang
distributed with mean 2.9 days (2,15). The delay from onset-to-reporting was
assumed to be exponentially distributed with mean 6.1 days (2). Once exposed to
infection, a proportion of individuals travelled internationally and we assumed that
the probability of cases being exported from Wuhan to a specific other country
depended on the number of cases in Wuhan, the number of outbound travellers
(assumed to be 3300 per day before travel restrictions were introduced on 23rd
January 2020 and zero after), the relative connectivity of different countries (18), and
the relative probability of reporting a case outside Wuhan, to account for differences
in clinical case definition, detection and reporting within Wuhan and internationally.
We considered the 20 countries outside China most at risk of exported cases in the
analysis.
Transmission was modelled as a geometric random walk process, and we used
sequential Monte Carlo to infer the transmission rate over time, as well as the
resulting number of cases and the time-varying basic reproduction number, Rt,
defined here as the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical
infectious individual on each day in a full susceptible population. The model had
three unknown parameters, which we estimated: magnitude of temporal variability in
transmission, proportion of cases that would eventually be detectable, and relative
probability of reporting a confirmed case within Wuhan compared to an
internationally exported case originated in Wuhan. We assumed the outbreak started
with a single infectious case on 22nd November 2019 and the entire population was
initially susceptible. Once we had estimated Rt, we used a branching process with a
negative binomial offspring distribution to calculate the probability an introduced
case would cause a large outbreak. We also conducted sensitivity analysis on

assumptions about the initial number of cases, connectivity between countries and
proportion of cases that were infectious before showing symptoms. More details of

Results
We estimated that the daily reproduction number, Rt, varied during January 2020,
with median values ranging from 1.6–2.6 between 1st January 2020 and the
introduction of travel restrictions on 23rd January (Figure 2A). We estimated a
decline in Rt in late January, from 2.35 (95% CI: 1.15-4.77) on 16th of January, one
week before the restrictions, to 1.05 (95% CI: 0.413-2.39) on 31st January.
The model reproduced the observed temporal trend of cases within Wuhan and cases
exported internationally, capturing all of the dynamics reflected by these different
data streams (Figure 2B–D). Our results suggested there were around tenfold more
symptomatic cases in Wuhan in late January than were reported as confirmed cases
(Figure 2E), but the model not predict the slowdown in cases that was observed in
early February. The model could also reproduce the pattern of confirmed exported
cases from Wuhan, which was not explicitly used in the model fitting (Figure 2F). We
found that confirmed and estimated exported cases among the twenty countries most
connected to China were generally in good correspondence, with the USA and
Australia as notable outliers, having had more confirmed cases reported with a travel
history to Wuhan than would be expected in the model (Figure 2G). We estimated
that 100% (95% CI: 51–100%) of cases would be eventually had detectable
symptoms, implying that most infections that were exported internationally from
Wuhan in late January were eventually detected.
To examine the potential for new outbreaks to establish in locations outside of
Wuhan, we used our estimates of the reproduction number to simulate new outbreaks
with potential individual-level variation in transmission (i.e. ‘superspreading events’)
(13,19,20). Such variation increases the fragility of transmission chains, making it less
likely that an outbreak will take off following a single introduction; if transmission is
more homogeneous, with all infectious individuals generating a similar number of
secondary cases, it is more likely than an outbreak will establish (19). Based on the
median reproduction number estimated during January before travel restrictions were
introduced, we estimated that a single introduction of 2019-nCoV with SARS-like or
MERS-like individual-level variation in transmission would have a 20–28%
probability of causing a large outbreak (Figure 3A). Assuming SARS-like variation
and Wuhan-like transmission, we estimated that once four or more infections have
been introduced into a new location, there is an over 50% chance that an outbreak will
occur (Figure 3B).

Discussion
Combining a mathematical model with multiple datasets, we found that the median
daily reproduction number, Rt , of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan likely varied between 1.6–
2.6 in January 2020 prior to travel restrictions being introduced. We also estimated
that transmission declined by around half in the two weeks spanning the introduction
of restrictions.
The estimated fluctuations in Rt were driven by the rise and fall in number of cases
both in Wuhan and internationally, as well as prevalence on evacuation flights
(Figures 2B–D). Such fluctuations could be the result of changes in behaviour in the
population at risk, or specific superspreading events that inflated the average estimate
of transmission (13,19,20). We found some evidence of reduction in Rt in the days
prior to the introduction of travel restrictions in Wuhan, which may have been
reflected outbreak control efforts or growing awareness of SARS-CoV-2 during this
period. The uncertainty in our estimates for Rt following the decline in early February
(Figure 2A) results from limited data sources to inform changes in transmission
during this period.
Comparing model predictions to observed confirmed cases reported in Wuhan during
late January and early February, we found that the model predicts ten-fold higher
cases than have been reported; the model also does not predict the recent slowdown in
cases, suggesting a potential change in reporting rather than a genuine slowdown in
transmission in early February. Our estimates for international cases in specific
countries were broadly consistent with the number of subsequently confirmed
exported cases outside of Wuhan. However, there were notably more cases exported
to France, US, and Australia compared to what our model predicted. This may be the
result of increased surveillance and detected as awareness of SARS-CoV-2 grew in
late January, which would suggest earlier exported cases may have missed; it may
also be the result of increased travel out of Wuhan immediately prior to travel
restrictions being introduced on 23rd January.
Based our on estimated reproduction number, and published estimates of individuallevel variation in transmission for SARS and MERS-CoV, we found that a single case
introduced to a new location would not necessarily lead to an outbreak. Even if the
reproduction number is as high as it has been in Wuhan in early January, it may take
several introductions for an outbreak to establish; this is because high individual-level
variation in transmission makes new chains of transmission more fragile, and hence
less likely that a single infection will generate out outbreak. This highlights the
importance of rapid case identification, and subsequent isolation and other control
measures to reduce the chance of onward chains of transmission (21).
Our analysis highlights the value of combining multiple data sources in analysis of
COVID-19. For example, the rapid growth of confirmed cases globally during late
January 2020, with case totals in some instances apparently doubling every day or so,
would have had the effect of inflating Rt estimates to implausibly large values if only
these recent data points were used in analysis. Our results also have implications for
the estimation of transmission dynamics using the number of exported cases from a
specific area (22). Once extensive restrictions are introduced, as they were in Wuhan,
the signal from such data gets substantially weaker. If restrictions and subsequent
delays in detection of cases is not accounted for, it could lead to artificially low

estimates of Rt or inferred case totals from the apparently declining numbers of
exported cases. Our model estimates benefitted from the availability of testing data
from evacuation flights, which allowed us to estimate current prevalence. Having
such information for other settings, either through widespread testing or serological
surveillance, will be valuable to reduce reliance on case reports alone.
There are several other limitations to our analysis. We used plausible biological
parameters for SARS-CoV-2 based on current evidence, but these values may be
refined as more comprehensive data become available. However, by fitting to
multiple datasets to infer model parameters, and performing sensitivity analyses on
key areas of uncertainty, we have attempted to make the best possible use of the
available evidence about SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. Further, we used
publicly available connectivity and risk estimates based on international travel data to
predict the number of exported cases into each country. These estimates have shown
good correspondence with the distribution of exported cases to date (23), and are
similar to another risk assessment for COVID-19 with different data (24). We also
assumed that the latent period is equal to the incubation period (i.e. individuals
become infectious and symptomatic at the same time) and all infected individuals will
eventually become symptomatic. However, there is evidence that transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 can occur with limited reported symptoms (25). We therefore
conducted a sensitivity analysis in which transmission could occur in the second half
of the incubation period, but this did not change our overall conclusions (Appendix,
page 7). We also explored having a larger initial spillover event and also using
different sources for flight connectivity data, neither of which changed the
conclusions of the analysis. In our analysis of new outbreaks, we also used estimates
of individual-level variation in transmission for SARS and MERS-CoV to illustrate
potential dynamics. However, it remains unclear what the precise extent of such
variation is for SARS-CoV-2 (13); if transmission were more homogenous than
SARS of MERS-CoV, it would increase the risk of outbreaks following introduced
cases. As more data becomes available, it will be possible to refine these estimates,
and therefore we made an online tool so users can explore these risk estimates if new
data become available (Appendix, page 4)
Our results demonstrate that there was likely substantial variation in SARS-CoV-2
transmission over time, and suggest a decline in transmission in Wuhan in late
January around the time that control measures were introduced. If COVID-19
transmission establishes outside of Wuhan, understanding the effectiveness of control
measures in different settings will be crucial for understanding the likely dynamics of
the outbreak, and the likelihood that transmission can eventually be contained.
