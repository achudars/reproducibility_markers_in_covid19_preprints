Abstract
COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has virtually locked down the entire world of human population, and through its
rapid and unstoppable spread COVID-19 has essentially compartmentalised the population merely into susceptible,
exposed, infected and recovered classes. Adapting the classical epidemic modelling framework, two distinct routes
of COVID-19 transmission are incorporated into a model: (a) direct person-to-person contact transmission, and (b)
indirect airborne and fomites-driven transmission. The indirect non-contact transmission route needs to explored in
models of COVID-19 spread, because evidences show that this route of transmission is entirely viable with hugely
uncertain level of relative contribution. This theoretical study based on model simulations demonstrates the following:
(1) Not incorporating indirect transmission route in the model leads to underestimation of the basic reproduction
number, and hence will impact on the COVID-19 mitigation decisions; (2) Lockdown measures can suppress the primary
infection peak, but will lead to a secondary peak whose relative strength and time of occurrence depend on the success
and duration of the lockdown measures; (3) To make lockdown effective, a considerable level of reduction in both
contact and non-contact transmission rates over a long period is required; (4) To bring down the infection cases below
any hypothetical health-care capacity, reduction of non-contact transmission rate is key, and hence active measures
should be taken to reduce non-contact transmission (e.g., extensive uses of areal and aerosol disinfectant in public
spaces to improve contaminated surfaces and air); (5) Any premature withdrawal of lockdown following the sign of a
brief retracement in the infection cases can backfire, and can lead to a quicker, sharper and higher secondary peak, due
to reactivation of the two transmission routes. Based on these results, this study recommends that any exit policy from
lockdown, should take into account the level of transmission reduction in both routes, the absolute scale of which will
vary among countries depending on their health-service capacity, but should be computed using accurate time-series
data on infection cases and transmission rates.

Introduction

In this paper, a compartmental epidemiological
model is simulated, taking into consideration the transmission routes for COVID-19 infection among the susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I) and recovered
(R) classes of the population (see Appendix for model
equations). The model builds on classical SIR models
[1–3], but is extended to incorporate two transmission
routes and mitigation measures such as lockdown and
social distancing, which has been undertaken across
countries. The epidemic model includes the following
two routes of transmission:

Over the last few months, COVID-19 has expanded
across the world, and is now challenging the very existence of human population in many squares on the
Earth. The spread of this infection was rapid, and no
specific group of the population was essentially immune
to this infection. Reported daily deaths suggest that
the immune-response to this virus may vary among age
groups and depend on underlying health conditions

the secondary peak and the delay in peak occurrence
under different transmission rates (Fig. 4). Although
longer lockdown reduces the primary peak, the scale of
the reduction does not change beyond a certain point
of time (first and second window, Fig. 4). Non-contact
transmission plays a key role here, and if this transmission rate is proactively reduced through disinfection measures, the impact of longer lockdown will be
realised on the number of new cases. Under a hypothetical scenario, with a 50% reduction in contact
transmission and 10% reduction in non-contact transmission, any impact on the primary peak and its occurrence may cease after 30 days of lockdown. However,
under the same set up, if both transmissions reduce by
75%, the impact on primary peak and its occurrence
can persist 90 days and beyond, which will bring down
the primary infection cases (first and second window,
Fig. 4).
A reduced impact of lockdown on primary peak
needs to be considered in conjunction with characteristics of the enforced secondary peak. For any level of
reduction in contact and non-contact transmission, the
secondary peak and its occurrence depend on the duration of lockdown measures (third and fourth window,
Fig. 4). Under a hypothetical scenario, with a 75% reduction in contact transmission and 10% reduction in
non-contact reduction, the secondary peak can be vigorous: higher than the primary peak, and occurring
within 60 days of the first peak (black lines, in third
and fourth window, Fig. 4).

Impact of ending lockdown prematurely
Whilst lockdown and associated measures guarantee
initial reduction of the disease spread, any suppression
of the infection peak results in a secondary infection
peak after the lockdown has been lifted (Fig. 2). Theoretically, the secondary peak enforced by lockdown will
be higher than that for the no-action scenario. It is,
therefore, important to investigate the dynamics of the
secondary peak for deciding the duration of lockdown
(Fig. 3).
To demonstrate the secondary-peak dynamics, let
us consider the best scenario out of those shown in
(Fig. 2), i.e, both non-contact and contact transmission
rates are reduced by 75% throughout the lockdown period. Under such an optimistic scenario, the evolution
of secondary peak, its height, time of occurrence and
duration solely depend on the duration of lockdown
(see, green lines in Fig. 3). For example, with a hypothetical health-service capacity equal to 30% of the noaction peak, the first 30 days of lockdown show significant reduction in the infection cases (see, red and green
lines in the first window, Fig. 3), giving a false impression that the subsequent infection cases will stay below
the capacity. But once the lockdown is fully lifted, the
infection cases spike rapidly over a short time, and the
peak goes beyond the capacity, almost nearing the noaction peak. This scenario demonstrates the ultimate
failure of the suppression measures as a consequence of
premature end of lockdown.
When lockdown continues slightly longer, say, only
until when the primary peak reduces down to the
health-service capacity (e.g., 90 days in the second window, Fig. 3), the infection cases almost plateau, giving
a false impression that a lower number of subsequent
cases will follow beyond lockdown. But, after a minor
retracement, the infection cases increase and the secondary peak goes beyond the health-service capacity,
suggesting that this is also a premature end of lockdown.
When lockdown continues much longer, even after
the infection cases plateau, and it continues until the
cases are considerably below the health-service capacity (e.g., 120-180 days in window 3 and 4, Fig. 3),
a characteristically different secondary peak evolves.
The secondary peak is now lower than the primary
peak, and hence much lower than the health-service
capacity. Longer lockdown further pushes back secondary peak, giving adequate time for preparation for
the second wave (Fig. 3).

Concluding remarks

Based on a compartmental SEIR epidemic modelling
framework the dynamics of an infected population
is studied here. The model incorporates two different routes of COVID-19 transmission: the traditional
person-to-person contact route, and the less explored
fomites-mediated and airborne route. Whilst the preliminary evidence suggest that both transmissions contribute to COVID-19 spread [5, 6], the impact of noncontact transmission has been recognised as more uncertain due to difficulty in data collection, and therefore requires proper attention in modelling studies.
Indirect transmission via non-contact route can increase the basic reproduction number significantly.
Therefore, not incorporating this route of transmission in the model will underestimate the strength of
COVID-19 transmission and spread.
Simulation results suggest that lockdown will impact
on infection spread, and initially suppress the number
of infection cases to a great extent. But lockdown alone
will not eradicate the infection from the system, particularly if the duration of lockdown is short, and if
stricter measures are not taken to reduce all the routes

lockdown may be influenced by the ‘false signal’ of an
initial plateau or even a minor dip in the number of
cases, which is a trivial consequence of initial decrease
in contact transmission. If the lockdown ends prematurely, a brief retracement may follow, but after this,
the infection cases can in no time jump to a new high
due to reactivation of the transmission routes.
During the lockdown period, strong measures will
be required to significantly reduce the routes of transmission. Contact transmission should be reduced as
much as possible. There is, however, the possibility
that the indirect or non-contact transmission route is
ignored, which will be less helpful in reducing the infection cases in situation where the relative strength
of this transmission rate is high. Therefore, pro-active
measures should be taken to reduce non-contact transmission. Some of those measures may involve frequent
and wider uses of areal and aerosol disinfectant in public spaces to improve contaminated surfaces and air,
as has been done by certain countries (e.g., China,
World Economic Forum report). Ignoring non-contact
transmission should not be compensated by far stricter
lockdown or unachievable lockdown measures, as the
mitigation strategy should not be solely based on contact route of transmission.
Any exit policy from lockdown should carefully consider the level of success in reducing both the routes
of transmission over a sufficiently long time frame.
The absolute scale of the required measures such as,
% reduction in both contact and non-contact transmission, will vary for countries depending on their
health-service capacity, and could be computed from
the model used in this paper using accurate time-series
data on infection cases and transmission rates (which is
beyond the scope of this paper). An optimal lockdown
duration or a ‘sweet-spot’ for lockdown withdrawal,
therefore, can differ between countries.

A range of parameter values are included in the simulations,
