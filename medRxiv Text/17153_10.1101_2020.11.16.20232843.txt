Effectiveness of Second Wave COVID-19 Response Strategies in Australia

Abstract
Background: There is a significant challenge in responding to second waves of COVID-19 cases,
with governments being hesitant in introducing hard lockdown measures given the resulting
economic impact. In addition, rising case numbers reflect an increase in coronavirus transmission
some time previously, so timing of response measures is highly important. Australia experienced
a second wave from June 2020 onwards, confined to greater Melbourne, with initial social
distancing measures failing to reduce rapidly increasing case numbers. We conducted a detailed
analysis of this outbreak, together with an evaluation of the effectiveness of alternative response
strategies, to provide guidance to countries experiencing second waves of SARS-Cov-2
transmission.
Method: An individual-based transmission model was used to 1) describe a second-wave
COVID-19 epidemic in Australia; 2) evaluate the impact of lockdown strategies used; and 3)
evaluate effectiveness of alternative mitigation strategies. The model was calibrated using daily
diagnosed case data prior to lockdown. Specific social distancing interventions were modelled by
adjusting person-to-person contacts in mixing locations.
Results: Modelling earlier activation of lockdown measures are predicted to reduce total case
numbers by more than 50%. Epidemic peaks and duration of the second wave were also shown
to reduce. Our results suggest that activating lockdown measures when second-wave case
numbers first indicated exponential growth, would have been highly effective in reducing
COVID-19 cases. The model was shown to realistically predict the epidemic growth rate under
the social distancing measures applied, validating the methods applied.
Conclusions: The timing of social distancing activation is shown to be critical to their
effectiveness. Data showing exponential rise in cases, doubling every 7-10 days, can be used to
trigger early lockdown measures. Such measures are shown to be necessary to reduce daily and
total case numbers, and the consequential health burden, so preventing health care facilities
being overwhelmed. Early control of second wave resurgence potentially permits strict lockdown
measures to be eased earlier.

Background
An ongoing challenge faced by public health authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic is
knowing when to activate social distancing strategies, the magnitude of the measures, how to
safely ease the measures once case numbers reach low levels, and how best to react when a rapidly
developing outbreak occurs. We report on a detailed, model-based case study into the significant
COVID-19 second wave in greater Melbourne, Australia, from June 2020 onwards. This occurred
as a result of ineffective management of the mandated hotel quarantine policy for returning
overseas travellers, where transmission is believed to have occurred between infectious arrivals
and security staff, then among the staff, and thus to their families and friends [1, 2].
The aim of this study was to understand why this second wave of SARS-Cov-2 transmission grew
so rapidly; why the initial increase in social distancing response was ineffective; what responses
would have been more effective; and thus the lessons learned. The insights gained are of benefit
to other countries and jurisdictions in their determination of response policy.
The Australian response to COVID-19 has kept the country largely free from large-scale
transmission, such as occurred in Europe, the USA and Latin America, by halting flights from
China in February, and stopping inbound travel by non-Australian residents from 20th March 2020.
Robust social distancing measures were also adopted country-wide on that date and further
strengthened on 26th March 2020 [3-5], resulting in substantial reductions in person-to-person
contact in workplaces and the community. These measures resulted in very low levels of COVID19 virus transmission, with almost all cases arising from returning Australians infected outside the
country. All arrivals were required to enter 14 days of managed hotel quarantine. Certain
Australian states (e.g. Western Australia and Queensland) also closed their interstate borders. The
initial success of Australia in halting the arrival of infectious individuals, and managing the limited
number of community transmissions via testing and contact tracing, allowed all Australian states
to start easing social distancing measures from May onwards, including allowing schools to
reopen, as detailed in Table 1. The total number of COVID-19 related deaths for the whole of
Australia was ~100 up to 6th May 2020, and stayed constant at that number for the next 8 weeks.
In late May, a breakdown in hotel quarantine regulations in Melbourne, State of Victoria, followed
by a number of unauthorised, large-scale family gatherings, allowed the SARS-Cov-2 virus to
enter the wider population in greater Melbourne, with diagnosed case numbers increasing from
June onwards [6].
Case data resulting from this second wave outbreak provided us with a unique opportunity to
analyse the non-pharmaceutical (NPI) measures used, and the significance of their activation
timing. This study was facilitated by the fact that Australia’s second wave was geographically
contained to greater Melbourne, and not impacted by the ongoing introduction of infectious
persons. This “self-contained” second wave provided us with high quality data on daily case
numbers, as in Figure 1, allowing us to evaluate second wave response measures without
interference from introduced cases.

Methods
An individual-based model capturing the demographics and movement patterns of individuals
within an Australian city, together with SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission data from the early
outbreak in Wuhan, China prior to social distancing activation [9], was developed and applied.
This was used to analyse the effectiveness of a broad suite of non-pharmaceutical, social distancing
interventions, by varying their strength, their time of activation, and their duration. Individualbased (c.f. agent-based) modelling is an appropriate methodology to adopt for this task. It permits
the effect of four key social distancing measures to be readily captured at a high degree of detail:
school closure; reduction in workplace participation; community-contact reduction; and case
isolation. This modelling method has been applied previously, to quantify the impact of pandemic
mitigation strategies [10-13], and to inform policy decision making [14-17].
This study utilised a model of Newcastle, a city in New South Wales, Australia (population
272,407), whose population demographics reflect Australia as a whole and results were scaled to
greater Melbourne, population ~5 million, following an approach used previously [11, 12].
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) census data were used to capture age-specific demographics
of every household in the community.[18, 19] ABS workplace data was used to assign adults to
workplaces [20], and State Government schools data was used to assign children to age-specific
classes [21]. These data were used to model the time-changing contact patterns for each individual,
as they move between their household, school/workplace contact hub and in the wider community.
Model parameter settings were calibrated to reflect the transmission characteristics of the COVID19 epidemic: an incubation period averaging 6 days, from infection to symptom emergence (if
any); a latent period averaging 5 days, from infection to infectious; an infectious period averaging

4.5 days, the first day being asymptomatic; and 35% of cases are asymptomatic. The probability
of virus transmission from infectious to susceptible individuals was derived from a R0 of 2.25,
based on SARS-CoV-2 transmission characteristics from Wuhan, China prior to introduction of
containment measures [9, 22], following the method applied for pandemic influenza [23].
Model outputs obtained by running the simulation software produced the infection history of every
individual in the community, generating the daily (and total) number of infectious individuals, and
determining where and when infection occur, as described previously [14, 17]. Modelling analyses
were conducted for alternative social distancing strategies, by varying the strength of measures
and their activation timing. This quantified how alternative mitigation strategies may have
performed, allowing us to contrast alternative mitigation strategies with those that were used. The
difference in total case numbers provides a measure of the effectiveness of alternative mitigation
strategies to reduce the impact of the outbreak.
Our model depends on a small number of stochastic parameters, including the probability of virus
transmission between an infectious individual and a susceptible individual, and the random seeding
of infectious individuals into the community to initiate an outbreak. This results in variation
between successive simulation runs. From experience with prior, related analyses of mitigation
strategy effectiveness for pandemic and seasonal influenza [14, 15, 23], averaging infection data
generated from multiple runs stabilises after approximately 16 runs. The results presented here
were obtained from multiple simulation runs for each social distancing scenario evaluated.
Social distancing
Four social distancing measures are available to health authorities, and were combined during the
Melbourne COVID-19 outbreak. School closure (SC): reduction in school attendance. Workplace
non-attendance (WN): a percentage of all persons in the workforce remain at home during working
hours. Community contact reduction (CCR): contact in the wider community is reduced by a given
percentage to reflect strength of intervention. Case isolation (CI): a percentage of adults and all
children withdraw to the home on becoming symptomatic.
Stage 2, Stage 3 and Stage 4 measures applied in greater Melbourne are described in Table 1 and
the Supporting Information [3-5, 24, 25]. These have increasing strength, with Stage 4 lockdown
restricting individuals to their homes unless they have approved occupations, require healthcare,
or require to shop for essential supplies. The sequence of changes to social distancing measures in
the State of Victoria are as follows: Stage 2 measures were activated on 25th March, and given
absence of community-wide transmission started to be eased on 26th May, with some students
returning to schools. From 26th June all schools closed, mirroring Stage 2 measures. Stage 3
measures were introduced from 2nd July onwards, first to limited areas of greater Melbourne,
designated by their postal codes. Stage 3 measures were then extended to all of greater Melbourne
on 10th July, however schools reopened on 13th July for years 11 and 12, and for all ages on 20th
July. As daily case numbers continued to increase over that period, Stage 4 lockdown measures
were activated on 3rd August.

Model calibration
The “second wave” Melbourne COVID-19 outbreak originated in late May 2020, as a result of a
breakdown in hotel quarantine [1]. The scale of the outbreak became apparent later, as diagnosed
case numbers started to increase rapidly. A calibration process was used to estimate the initial
phase of the outbreak, to create a sufficient pool of infectious individuals that later transition into
diagnosed cases, and thus align with daily reported case numbers. The calibration aligned the daily
number of infectious individuals in the population generated by the simulation model, to actual,

reported case numbers. This allowed us to predict case number dynamics into the future, and under
alternative social distancing measures.
Calibrating diagnosed cases to new SARS-Cov-2 infections in the simulation model used a process
which applied the infection timeline parameters (see Supporting Information, Table S1). The daily
set of currently infectious individuals generated by the model was used to calculate the daily
number of (simulated) diagnosed cases, assuming a given percentage of COVID-19 positive cases
are tested and reported. By adjusting seeding of infectious individuals into the model in early June
2020, and under the social distancing measures then in place, the model was calibrated to case
numbers appearing at a later time.
The calibration process was conducted in two steps, to reflect an increased testing regime
beginning in early July. The first calibration phase resulted in approximately a third of all infected
individuals being diagnosed, the remaining two thirds being in either the latent period, or
asymptomatic, or exhibiting mild symptoms, and thus not accessing a testing facility. In the second
phase, when a more aggressive testing regime involving increased contact tracing was initiated
from 2nd July 2020 onwards, we assumed a steady increase in the (positive case) diagnosis rate, as
the overall testing coverage increased. This ratio, between infections and the percentage of
infections being diagnosed and reported as cases, was used to convert daily infection data
generated by the model into predicted case numbers.
Strengthened social distancing
Simulation experiments were conducted by running model software, after adjusting the strength
of social distancing measures to reflect introduction of Stage3 and Stage 4 restrictions. Random
seeding of infectious individuals into the model was used to capture the effect of localized high
transmission events, resulting from a number of large gatherings in late June 2020 [2]. The
following were determined to replicate daily outbreak case dynamics up to 1st August 2020.
Prior to increases in social distancing measures on 9th July 2020, we assumed 30% of school-age
children were not attending school (SC30) and workplace attendance and community contact were
both reduced by 20% (WN20) and (CCR20) respectively, as in Table 1. This weak Stage 2 social
distancing arose from previous easing of measures, given low levels of virus transmission
throughout Australia. Simulations were run from 17th June 2020 onwards with approximately 10
infections seeded daily, and with social distancing at (SC30+WN20+CCR20), as above. From 28th
June an additional 180 infected individual were seeded daily to model the rapid growth in
infections due to large-scale family gatherings [1, 2].
Following a significant increase in diagnosed cases in late June 2020, the Victorian Government
announced Stage 3 restrictions to apply from 9th July 2020. All schools, cafes, restaurants and bars
closed, and public gatherings and sporting events stopped, estimated to give a 60% communitywide contact reduction (CCR60) coupled with 100% school closure (SC100), as detailed in Table
1. Case isolation at home was assumed to have compliance of 70% for adults and 100% for children
(CI70). The 20% workplace reduction continued, resulting in a (SC100+WN20+CCR60+CI70)
Stage 3 social distancing strategy.

Seeding of infectious individuals into the model was stopped on 9th July 2020, thus all further
infections in the model occurred as a consequence of the breakdown in hotel quarantine measures
and, subsequent large family gatherings. This replicates what is known to have occurred, with
genomic sequencing recently showing that over 90% of all outbreak cases were due to a breakdown
in quarantine measures, and arose from transmission between infected travellers and quarantine
facility staff within a quarantine hotel [1, 2].
Calibrating our model to case data up to the beginning of August, and continuing simulations into
2021, allowed us to analyse the effectiveness of a range of alternative social distancing strategies,
and to compare these with those applied by the Government of Victoria.

Results
Timing of response
The Government of Victoria adopted a “stepped” response to their second wave COVID-19
outbreak, from Stage 2 to Stage 3, then to Stage 4. This is illustrated by the yellow epidemic curve
in Figure 2, which realistically predicts the dynamics of the reduction in daily case numbers up to
30th October 2020, as seen in diagnosed case number data, Figure 1.
The rapid increase in diagnosed cases in greater Melbourne from 13th June 2020 onwards (see
Figure 1) suggests that an opportunity existed to move from Stage 2 measures directly to Stage 4.
For reference, between 19th June and 29th June case numbers were doubling every 7 to 10 days.
This exponential growth phase in diagnosed cases numbers may be observed in Figure 1. Figure
2, and data in Table 2, highlight the potential benefit of early activation of Stage 4 “lockdown”
social distancing measures, on 19th June, 29th June, and 10th July, the date when Stage 3 was
activated, the blue, orange and grey curves respectively. These results illustrate the benefit, in
terms of case number reductions, that may have been achieved by these early activation strategies,
when compared with the actual date of Stage 4 lockdown on August 3rd, yellow curve Figure 2.

Figure 2: Predicted epidemic curves for earlier activation of Stage 4 lockdown measures in
greater Melbourne (population 5 million). Y axis represents daily diagnosed cases. All scenarios
assume schools are closed, and there is 90% case isolation for adults and 100% for children.

Table 2 highlights how moving to a Stage 4 “hard lockdown” on 9th July would have reduced total
case numbers by approximately 40%, from ~25,000 to ~16,000 cases, up to May 2020. These data
correspond to the smaller area under the grey curve (10th July activation) in Figure 2. When
compared to the area under the yellow epidemic curve, which predict total cases resulting from the
actual date of Stage 4 introduction on 3rd August, this earlier activation is effective in reducing
case numbers. Activating Stage 4 measures 10 to 20 days earlier, between 19th and 29th June, is
shown to be highly effective, reducing total case numbers by over 50%.
Table 2 indicates that under all activation timings, Stage 4 measures are predicted to result in single
digit case numbers by the end of October 2020, and effectively halt virus transmission by early
2021. Modelling the impact of the stepped measures introduced by the Government of Victoria,
involving Stage 3 measures applied on 10th July and Stage 4 on 3rd August, accurately predicted
the decline in case numbers. This is seen by comparing the yellow predicted 3rd August epidemic
curve in Figure 2, with the diagnosed case data up to 30th October 2020, from Figure 1.

Throughout May 2020, daily case numbers in greater Melbourne had been steady and in single
figures. As illustrated in Figure 1, reported daily case numbers began to increase throughout June
and into July. Data generated by our modelling analyses (Table 2) predicts that Stage 4 lockdown
activated on 29th June, when daily case numbers had grown to 61 (see paragraph below), may have
reduced total case numbers by over 50%. If activated 10 days later, on 9th July, the reduction in
total case numbers is less, reducing numbers by approximately 40%.
The following data sequence, taken from daily COVID-19 case data published by the Government
of Victoria [7]; 5 cases on 11th June, 10 on 13th, 20 on 16th, 25 on 19th, 33 on 24rd, 40 on 26th and
61 on 29th June 2020, 98 on 5th July, 122 on 7th, 143 on 9th and 218 on 14th July [7, 8]. Note that
reported case data is known to vary day-to-day, as seen in Figure 1, depending on numbers
attending testing facilities. However, a clear pattern can be seen with this data sequence, with cases
doubling approximately every 7-8 days from 11th June to 9th July, giving an exponential increase,
then increasing linearly until mid-August, as illustrated in Figure 1 [8]. The above results suggest
that the exponential increase in diagnosed cases during that period could have been used to trigger
hard lockdown measures. If used, this triggering approach is predicted to effectively reduce virus
transmission and resulting case numbers.
Activation of stronger social distancing, 10th July 2020
The State of Victoria responded to the COVID-19 outbreak by increasing social distancing
measures in two steps; Stage 3 measures on 10th July 2020, and given the continuing increase in
case numbers, strengthened measures to Stage 4 on 3rd August 2020 [25]. Modelling was
conducted to analyse the impact of this stepwise series of measures, and contrast these with the
situation had they not occurred. Stage 3 measures introduced on 10th July 2020, namely
(SC100+WN20+CCR60+CI70), were strengthened to Stage 4 on the 3rd of August, estimated to
increase workplace non-attendance to 50% and further reduce community-wide contact to 20%,
an 80% reduction. This gives social distancing scenario (SC100+WN50+CCR80+CI70), the grey
curve in Figure 3.

Data generated by these modelling experiments (Table 3) highlight the need for, and effectiveness
of, the hard lockdown measures taken, as illustrated by the grey curve in Figure 3, Without them,
virus transmission is estimated to have continued to at least June 2021 had Stage 3 measures been
maintained indefinitely, illustrated by the blue curve Figure 3.
Further modelling experiments were conducted to evaluate whether less restrictive Stage 4
strategies may have had a similar benefit, orange and yellow curves in Figure 3. The aim of these
measures would be to lessen the economic impact of businesses closing due to hard lockdown, by
increasing workplace attendance. This was achieved by a) allowing small service businesses to
reopen, i.e. cafes with staff returning, and b) larger workplaces increasing numbers working insitu, rather than remotely. We evaluated two scenarios: 1) reducing workplace non-attendance to
30% (so increasing attendance to 70%) and lessening the community contact reduction to 75%,
and 2) having workplace non-attendance at 35% and community contact reduction staying at 80%.
These result in the orange and yellow epidemic curves in Figure 5, respectively.

Figure 3: Increased social distancing activated on 3rd August 2020 in greater Melbourne
(population 5 million). Grey curve models Stage 4 measures applied. Yellow and orange curves
allow greater workplace activity, increasing workplace attendance to 70% and 65% respectively.
Blue curve represents continuation of Stage 3 measures, i.e. no increase in social distancing. All
scenarios assume schools are closed, and there is 90% case isolation for adults and 100% for
children.
For all three lockdown strategies, these changes in social distancing are predicted to result in
minimal virus transmission from mid-January 2021 onwards, with diagnosed case numbers at zero
or one for all three strategies (see Table 3, Figure 3). The strategy reducing case numbers most
rapidly corresponds to the Stage 4 measures that were adopted, and described previously (Figure
2, Table 2).

to that with workplace non-attendance at 35% and community contact reduction staying at 80%,

the strength of measures, from 31,386 for the strategy with highest workplace attendance of 70%
(WN30), to 28,650 for workplace attendance of 65% (WN35), and 25,222 for the Stage 4 measures

Predicted case data in Table 3 further indicate that all three increased social distancing strategies
are effective in reducing epidemic duration, with daily case numbers in single figures by December
2020 or early 2021. This contrasts to the situation which would result if Stage 3 measures had
remained in place, illustrated by the blue case curve in Figure 3, and case data in the first columns
of Table 3. Under that scenario, virus transmission, and thus new cases, are predicted to occur up
to and beyond May 2021.
Early activation of Stage 3 measures
Additional modelling analyses were conducted to evaluate outcomes from earlier activation of
Stage 3 measures. These had the aim of determining whether this change may have reduced the
need for introduction of the more robust Stage 4 lockdown measures, and consequential negative
economic impact. Figure 4 illustrate the impact of earlier activation of the Stage 3 social distancing

Data in Table 4, and the epidemic curves in Figure 4, suggest that the 10 day earlier activation of
Stage 3 measures on 29th June has limited effect on both daily and overall case numbers, up to 17th
May 2021. The 5 day earlier activation of Stage 3 measures is predicted to reduce total case number
by approximately 10%, while the 10 day earlier activation is predicted to reduce total case numbers
by almost 20%.
These data indicate that the slightly earlier activation of Stage 3 social distancing measures fails
to significantly reduce the duration of virus transmission, with transmission continuing to at least
June 2021. This supports the decision by the Government of Victoria to then strengthen measures
to Stage 4 lockdown, with our modelling estimating cessation of transmission by the end of 2020.
Discussion
Early and robust application of social distancing measures are known to be an appropriate response
to the COVID-19 pandemic. In early 2020 such responses were highly effective in minimizing
case numbers and the rate of epidemic growth at the early stages of the pandemic, as in Korea and
China [26-28]. Similarly, slow responses have resulted in significant first and second pandemic
waves, e.g. in Italy, Spain and the UK [29].
This study’s aims were to provide further evidence on the benefit of, and need for, early and robust
interventions to contain second waves of coronavirus infections. We quantified the effectiveness
of a range of response measures, in terms of the reduction in case numbers, and thus resulting
hospitalisations and deaths. These results are intended to help inform the hard COVID-19
containment decisions that need to be made by politicians and public health authorities, until an
effective vaccine becomes available. A challenge in responding to COVID-19 second waves is to
balance the effect of necessary lockdown measures, in protecting the health of the population, with
the negative impact which strict social distancing measures have on a country’s economy. A
fundamental issue highlighted in this study is the delay between increasing coronavirus
transmission rates, and the time when these manifest themselves as an increase in diagnosed cases.

Given that case data always lags the date of virus transmission, our findings indicate that activation
of early lockdown is possibly the only feasible strategy to adopt.
Our study was fortunate in having access to comprehensive case data from the rapidly developing
COVID-19 second wave in greater Melbourne, Australia from June 2020 onwards. Genomic
sequencing has shown that most infections in this second wave result from a breakdown in hotelbased quarantine, followed by two large family gatherings [1, 2]. To our knowledge, there were
no further introduced infections. This provided an ideal test-bed with which to analyse the
effectiveness of the mitigation measures taken, determine their failings, understand why the second
wave spread so rapidly, and to evaluate alternative mitigation strategies as to their effectiveness in
reducing the scale of a second wave. These analyses were facilitated by the absence of introduced
cases into the modelled population; the lack of “noise” from ongoing infection introduction
allowed us to assume that all infections resulted from the single source.
Using second wave outbreak data, we demonstrate how the methodology used realistically
modelled SARS-Cov-2 transmission from 1st August to 30th October 2020, when daily diagnosed
case numbers had reduced to zero. This prediction of outbreak dynamics provides validation of
how lockdown social distancing measures were modelled. That is, the impact which lockdown
measures had on reducing transmission over the same period of time. This validation provides
evidence as to the robustness of the modelling methods used, and gives credence to the results
obtained.
Results indicate that the most effective response, which significantly reduce cases and second
wave duration, would be the activation of Stage 4 lockdown measures much earlier, when case
numbers were first seen to increase exponentially, on or before 29th June 2020. This approach is
estimated to result in ~11,000 cases, compared to ~25,000 for the strategy taken, in a population
of approximately 5 million (Table 2). The second most effective strategy would have been to
activate Stage 4 social distancing measures on 9th July, the date of the first response to the second
wave, which increased social distancing measures to Stage 3. This is estimated to reduce total
cases to ~16,000 (Table 2). These two highly effective strategies involved moving directly to Stage
4 measures from Stage 2, rather than the step-wise approach adopted, from Stage 2 to Stage 3 to
Stage 4. They highlight the need to “catch” increasing transmission rates before infections are
widely distributed, with early and robust social distancing contributing to the rapid reduction in
virus transmission. The need for timely introduction of lockdown measures is discussed in a short
overview of the situation in the UK at the end of October 2020, by Elisabeth Mahase [30]. It
appears that the UK has been too slow to introduce hard lockdown, repeating the situation which
occurred in greater Melbourne, but on a much larger, country-wide scale. Significantly, the easing
of social distancing measures in the UK without high levels of testing and tracing has been shown
in a recent modelling study to result in a second COVID-19 wave [31], predicting the situation
which now appears to have occurred [30].
Had hard lockdown measures introduced on 3rd August in Australia not occurred, we estimate
virus transmission would be ongoing beyond the end of our simulation period (mid-May 2021),
resulting in approximately 30 cases per day from February onwards (Figure 3, Table 3). While the
Stage 3 social distancing measures activated in early July were predicted to results in a steady

decrease in daily cases numbers, they did not lead to virus elimination by mid-2021. As a
consequence, this would have limited the Government of Victoria’s ability to ease social
distancing and prevent another COVID-19 wave. This would have been a similar situation to that
analysed by Di Domenico and colleagues for Northern France [32, 33], and Aleta and colleagues
for the North East of the USA [34].
Our analyses support the decision by the State Government to subsequently introduce Stage 4
lockdown measures, which rapidly suppressed ongoing transmission and shorten the duration of
the second wave. Once transmission reaches a level where social distancing measures can be safely
eased, and new cases managed by highly efficient test, track and isolate systems, this will permit
an earlier reopening of businesses and a more rapid increase in economic activity.
It should be noted that the COVID-19 situation in Australia differs from most other countries, and
while our key findings are widely applicable, they may not be as effective in other settings due to
import of infectious cases. Prior to the second wave there was effectively no community
transmission in Australia, due to early and strict border closures. Many countries in Europe, for
example, failed to close borders, allowing infectious individuals to spread widely, with resulting
widespread transmission, Secondly, the second wave of SARS-Cov-2 transmission was confined
to the State of Victoria, particularly to the greater Melbourne area, and ongoing travel restrictions
prevented introduction of further infections. This has resulted in the effective eradication of the
virus, by early November 2020 [7].
Other countries experiencing second waves, or extensions of the first wave, are in a different
situation, with limited ability to achieve virus elimination. Other means are needed to reduce
transmission levels, and highly efficient testing, contact tracing and household isolation will be
needed to contain case numbers to levels which prevent health care facilities from being
overwhelmed. Modelling by Aleta and colleagues, in a USA setting [34], demonstrates how high
levels of testing, with 50% of symptomatic cases diagnosed, 14 day quarantine of all members of
a case’s household, and precautionary quarantine of contact households, may allow strict
lockdown measures to be safely eased. They show that this level of testing and isolation is needed
to prevent second COVID-19 waves. Similarly, modelling of methods to ease robust social
distancing measures in the Paris region, also indicate that extensive testing and tracing are needed
to manage second waves [32, 33]. The practical use of this response methodology can be seen with
South Korea, which adopted a sophisticated test/trace/isolate approach from the early stages of the
pandemic [26, 27]. The effectiveness of this approach has been shown to prevent second waves
developing [35].
As with all model-based studies, there are limitations on what features we are able to replicate in
detail, and what approximations need to be taken. These involve availability of data, both at the
virus transmission level and the population level. We used an estimated basic reproduction number
obtained from data gathered in Wuhan, China prior to social distancing activation, and used that
to estimate the probability of transmission between two individuals. Detailed census data were
used in model development, to create households, workplaces, and education establishments in as
much detail as data sources permitted. This allowed us to model movement of individuals between
their homes and work and education locations. However, mobility in the wider community was

estimated based on the probability of random contact between pairs of individuals, weighted by
distance from their homes. Obtaining data on actual population mobility, before and during periods
of social distancing restrictions, would aid the fidelity of individual-based models such as ours,
but obtaining such data is clearly a challenging task. While others have accessed de-identified
mobile phone data to estimate movement throughout a population, as in[34], an example of how
identified data can be accessed and applied in practice is given by South Korea. Here there is
general support for government agencies having detailed location and mobility data for the whole
population, as a public good. South Korea invested in Information Technology systems to manage
future pandemics following the SARS outbreak, and has been highly successful in keeping
COVID-19 case numbers low [26, 35]. Heavy use of mobile phone data to track the majority of
the population, instructing individuals in geo-located “hotspot” areas to be tested, checking on
compliance with home isolation, and informing residents of specific areas going into lockdown
[26, 27, 35].
A further limitation of our study is the use of daily diagnosed case numbers as a surrogate for
coronavirus transmission occurring between 5 to 15 days earlier, an approximate propagation time
period from date of infection to symptom emergence, time to be tested, and the return of results.
Diagnosed case data has a shorter propagation delay than daily hospitalisation and mortality data,
and so gives an earlier indication of increasing levels of transmission, and can act as a trigger to
increase social distancing measures, as described above. However, this use of case data suffers
from the need to make assumptions on the percentage of the population who are asymptomatic
following infection, and the percentage of symptomatic individuals who attend testing facilities.
In this study we assumed that 35% of those infected were asymptomatic, and that approximately
half of the remainder were diagnosed. COVID-19 hospitalisation data may act as a more accurate
snapshot of previous rates of transmission, but with a longer propagation delay from time of
infection.
The effect of social distancing measures on transmission rates was modelled directly, by reducing
person-to-person contact in schools, workplaces and the wider community. These measures
assumed that household contact remained. Case isolation was modelled by stopping movement of
diagnosed cases out-with the home, allowing for a certain percentage of non-compliance. We
assumed 70% compliance by adults and 100% for children, in the absence of published data
sources. Availability of contact pattern survey data during the pandemic may have improved the
fidelity of our model, and there is a hope that such data will be obtained and available for future
pandemic situations.

Health Policy Implications
Results from this study reinforce, and furthermore quantify, the benefit of early activation of robust
response measures to second (and more) COVID-19 infection waves. Such measures are shown to
significantly contain then reduce the epidemic growth rate, and consequential pressure on health
care resources. Results demonstrate the criticality of the timing of activation, where a slow
response to rapid, exponentially growing case numbers allows the coronavirus to spread widely
within the population, before the introduction of more robust social distancing measures can take

effect. The study also shows the benefit arising from border closure measures adopted for nonAustralians by the Australian Government in late March 2020. These prevented the ongoing
introduction of Sars-Cov-2 into the community, until a breakdown in international arrival
quarantine measures initiated the second wave of transmission.
In the absence of prospective testing, policy makers rely on diagnosed case, hospitalization and
mortality data to inform decision making. All three metrics have inherent (and increasing) time
lags; between date of infection and becoming infectious, and the possibility of being diagnosed,
hospitalized or dying, with case data having the shortest “propagation delay”.
This study used a discrete COVID-19 second wave in Australia to demonstrate how exponentially
increasing diagnosed case numbers, numbers that doubled every 7 to 10 days, could have better
predicted the need for a significantly earlier activation of lockdown measures. Using daily case
data as a lockdown “trigger” reinforces the need for a comprehensive and rapid testing program,
as described in a related study of lockdown and exit strategies in France [10, 32]. As of early
November 2020, many countries worldwide still lack highly effective testing and contact tracing
systems, so limiting their ability to gain early warnings of a rapid growth in case numbers, and
respond as indicated in this study.
A significant challenge for many countries facing second waves of COVID-19 cases is how to
balance the negative effect which lockdown measures have on an economy, against the health of
the population. It is clear there is a hesitancy by decision makers to introduce robust social
distancing measures, as evidenced by the step-by-step approach adopted by the Government of
Victoria, Australia, and evaluated in this study. This hesitancy is understandable. Long-duration
school closure impacts education outcomes, particularly among those from low socio-economic
backgrounds. Closure of cafes, restaurants and bars results in under-employment of young adults,
and has a knock-on effect on the economy. Closure of service and transport industries results in
increased unemployment, with these measures and home isolation impacting on the mental health
of those affected.
Using data from the COVID-19 second wave in Australia, and analyzing alternative response
strategies, the study determined the benefit of going hard and early. This contrasts with the
approach take in Victoria, where social distancing measures were increased incrementally,
resulting in the necessary hard lockdown measures being activated after the coronavirus was
widely distributed within the population. This study suggests the optimal response strategy would
be to go into lockdown much earlier, resulting in a significant reduction in case numbers,
consequential hospitalisations and, potentially, a reduction in the mortality rate.
