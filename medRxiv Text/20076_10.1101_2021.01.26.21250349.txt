Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was announced as an outbreak by the World Health
Organization (WHO) in January 2020 and as a pandemic in March 2020. The majority of
infected individuals have experienced no or only mild symptoms, ranging from fully
asymptomatic cases to mild pneumonic disease. However, a minority of infected individuals
develop severe respiratory symptoms. The objective of this study was to identify susceptible
HLA alleles and clinical markers for the early identification of severe COVID-19 among
hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A total of 137 patients with mild COVID-19 (mCOVID-19)
and 53 patients with severe COVID-19 (sCOVID-19) were recruited from the Center
Hospital of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM), Tokyo, Japan for
the period of February–August 2020. High-resolution sequencing-based typing for eight HLA
genes was performed using next-generation sequencing. In the HLA association studies,
HLA-A*11:01:01:01 [Pc = 0.013, OR = 2.26 (1.27–3.91)] and HLA-C*12:02:02:01-HLAB*52:01:01:02 [Pc = 0.020, OR = 2.25 (1.24–3.92)] were found to be significantly associated
with the severity of COVID-19. After multivariate analysis controlling for other confounding
factors and comorbidities, HLA-A*11:01:01:01 [P = 3.34E-03, OR = 3.41 (1.50–7.73)], age
at diagnosis [P = 1.29E-02, OR = 1.04 (1.01–1.07)] and sex at birth [P = 8.88E-03, OR =
2.92 (1.31–6.54)] remained significant. Early identification of potential sCOVID-19 could
help clinicians prioritize medical utility and significantly decrease mortality from COVID-19.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus
responsible for the onset of COVID-19, and has so far infected more than 87 million people
worldwide, with the global death toll surpassing 1.8 million (as of January 10, 2021). The
majority of infected individuals have experienced only mild or minor symptoms, ranging
from asymptomatic cases to mild pneumonic disease. However, a minority of infected
individuals developed severe respiratory symptoms but eventually survive with the aid of
mechanical ventilatory support.
As of January 10, 2021, mortality rates of COVID-19
(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality) were reported as highest in Mexico (8.8%),
followed by Iran, Italy, Hungary, and Indonesia with approximate mortality rates of 3–4%,
the United Kingdom, South Africa, Colombia, Canada, Spain, Brazil, France, Poland and
Germany at around 2–2.9%, and other countries with reported mortality rates less than 2%.
Differences in mortality rates can be caused by several factors, such as differences in the
number of people tested, the capacity of local healthcare systems to handle increasing
numbers of patients during the outbreak, the demographics of the population (with mortality
rates known to be higher in older populations) and the different preventive measurements
attempted by local governments. Nonetheless, while Japan stands as one of the oldest
populations in the world (with citizens 65 years or older accounting for approximately 28%
of the total population), the country has only suffered a mortality rate of 1.9%. Emerging
clinical evidence has suggested that factors such as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)vaccination status [1], viral genomic strain [2, 3] and host genetic factors [4, 5] may be
related to the severity and mortality of COVID-19.
The immunogenetic background of the host, such as HLA diversity, is well known to
play an essential role in determining host responses to emerging infectious diseases such as
TB [6], HBV [7-10], HCV [11, 12], HIV [13, 14], SARS-CoV-1 [15-19] and SARS-CoV-2
[20-22]. In cases of viral infection, viruses have successfully breached the early layers of the
innate defense system (early nonspecific responses) such as fever, phagocytosis and
inflammation. The human second line of defense is heavily reliant on the HLA-restricted Tcell response mechanism, in which viral epitopes are presented by dendritic cells to CD8+ T
lymphocytes through interactions with HLA class I alleles and CD4+ T lymphocytes through
HLA class II alleles. Viral epitope presentation by HLA class I leads to clonal expansion of
HLA-restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which are primed to perform
antiviral defense during acute infection. Subsequently, latent reinfection and reactivation of
the virus are controlled by memory CTLs.
The 2002–2003 SARS-CoV-1 outbreak is known to have higher pathogenicity and
higher mortality rates, while SARS-CoV-2 infections show higher transmissibility.
Experimental HLA association studies have indicated that HLA class I and class II alleles
such as B*46:01 [15], B*07:03 [16], Cw*08:01 [17], and DRB1*12:02 [18] carriers are more
susceptible to SARS-CoV-1 infection. Early studies of SARS-CoV-2 associations with HLA
alleles generally used small sample sizes, but B*15:27 and C*07:29 have nonetheless been
reported as associated with SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility in the Chinese population [20] and a
SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility study with larger sample size in China reported associations of
A*11:01, B*51:01 and C*11:01 with severity of COVID-19 in China [23]. On the other hand,
B*27:07, DRB1*15:01, and DQB1*06:02 have been reported as susceptible HLA alleles in
Italian COVID-19 [21].
Due to emerging evidence that the diversity of HLA allele distributions across
different populations is related to the susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19, this study
was designed to examine HLA alleles associated with the susceptibility and severity of
Japanese COVID-19.

Materials and Methods
National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) COVID-19 patients
A total of 190 Japanese COVID-19 patients (all COVID-19 [aCOVID-19]) were
recruited from the Center Hospital of the NCGM for the period of February–August 2020. In
this study, severe COVID-19 (sCOVID-19) was defined according to the most recent (27
May 2020) clinical guidelines from the WHO
(https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/clinical-management-of-covid-19), which defined
“severe disease” as adults with clinical signs of pneumonia (fever, cough, dyspnea, fast
breathing) accompanied by one of the following: respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min; severe
respiratory distress; or peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) < 90% on room air. The
sCOVID-19 patients comprised 27.9% of total patients who participated in this study.
Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. This study was approved by the
ethical committees from NCGM.
Tokyo Healthy Control (THC)
THC samples comprised 423 healthy individuals residing in the Tokyo area before the
COVID-19 outbreak. Informed consent was obtained from all of the THC sample participants.
This study was approved by the ethical committees from NCGM.
High-resolution HLA genotyping by next-generation sequencing
The AllType assay (One Lambda, West Hills, CA) was designed to cover the full
length of five HLA genes (HLA-A, -C, -B, -DQA1 and -DPA1) and partial coverage for six
HLA genes (HLA-DRB1, -DRB3, -DRB4, -DRB5, -DQB1 and -DPB1). Experimental
protocols were carried out following vendor instructions, consisting of HLA target
amplification, HLA library preparation, HLA template preparation, and HLA library loading
onto an ion 530v1 chip (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in the ion chef (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) followed by final sequencing on the ion S5 machine (Thermo Fisher
Scientific).
HLA genotype assignment
Demultiplexing of barcodes and base-calling was carried out in Torrent Suite version
5.8.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Raw fastq reads were extracted using the FileExporter
function in Torrent Suite version 5.8.0. HLA genotype assignments were carried out using
two different types of software, namely HLATypeStream Visual (TSV v2.0; One Lambda,
West Hills, CA) as the default software for the AlltypeTM NGS Assay and NGSengine®
(v2.18.0.17625) by the GenDX company (GenDX, Utrecht, the Netherlands). The default
analysis parameters and healthy metrics threshold was applied for TSV2.0 while we applied
the “ignore regions” function in the NGSengine to eliminate known sequencing error sites in
the ion S5 system. For the fully covered HLA genes (HLA-A, -C, -B, -DQA1 and -DPA1), 4field HLA alleles were determined after comparing the reads with the IMGT 3.40.0 database;
3-field HLA alleles were determined for partially covered HLA genes (HLA-DRB1, DRB345, -DQB1 and -DPB1). Novel HLA alleles that are absent from the IMGT 3.40.0
database or ambiguous HLA alleles were subjected to Pacbio Sequel sequencing by
H.U.Group Research Institute (Tokyo, Japan). After confirming the presence of novel HLA
alleles using Pacbio Sequel sequencing, Pacbio consensus reads were submitted to GenBank
and the IMGT nomenclature committee for the official naming of HLA alleles.

Statistical analysis
Case-control HLA allele association tests, HLA haplotype estimations, case-control
HLA haplotype association tests, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium tests, and HLA amino acid
association tests were prepared and analyzed using the Bridging ImmunoGenomics Data
Analysis Workflow Gaps [24] (BIGDAWG) R package. The default parameters of
BIGDAWG were used except for the manual specification of HLA haplotypes for testing.
Logistic regression, univariate, and multivariate analyses of COVID-19 comorbidities were
calculated using R statistics software v4.0.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria).
To evaluate associations of risk HLA alleles and comorbidities with the severity of
COVID-19, we applied univariate analysis (generalized linear model) to observe the
association of associated risk HLA alleles, age, sex, and comorbidities such as high blood
pressure, type 2 diabetes, obesity, respiratory diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
[COPD], asthma, tuberculosis [TB]), hyperuricemia and dyslipidemia with the severity of
COVID-19.
Results
Clinical characteristics of the 190 Japanese COVID-19 patients
Age distribution and other comorbidities in sCOVID-19 and mCOVID-19 patients are
shown in Figure 1a and Figure 1b, respectively. Mean age at diagnosis for sCOVID-19 and
mCOVID-19 were 57 years and 46 years, respectively, with males comprising 72% of
sCOVID-19 patients and 46% of mCOVID-19 patients. In general, the most common
comorbidities in sCOVID-19 were high blood pressure (43%, 23/53), type 2 diabetes (26%,
14/53), hyperuricemia (19%, 10/53), dyslipidemia (13%, 7/53), obesity (9%, 5/53) and
COPD/asthma/TB (8%, 4/53). In comparison, comorbidities were shown to be lower in
mCOVID-19 with high blood pressure (18%, 24/137), type 2 diabetes (8%, 11/137),
hyperuricemia (4%, 5/137), dyslipidemia (12%, 17/137), obesity (5%, 7/137) and
COPD/Asthma/TB (9%, 12/137).
A comprehensive comparison of HLA allele associations for four different subgroups
was performed in this study, namely: 1) aCOVID-19 versus healthy controls; 2) mCOVID-19
vs. healthy controls; 3) sCOVID-19 vs. healthy controls; and 4) sCOVID-19 vs. mCOVID-19.
No association of HLA alleles with all COVID-19 (aCOVID-19 vs. controls)
For the identification of HLA alleles associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, all 190
aCOVID-19 patients (comprising both mCOVID-19 and sCOVID-19) were compared with
the 423 Japanese healthy controls. None of the HLA alleles in the 8 HLA genes tested
showed significance after multiple corrections (Supplementary Table 1).
No association of HLA alleles with mild COVID-19 (mCOVID-19 vs. controls)
To identify potential HLA alleles associated with mild symptoms of COVID-19, the
137 mCOVID-19 patients were compared with the healthy controls. No HLA alleles
remained significant after multiple corrections (Supplementary Table 2). This result indicated
that HLA frequencies for mCOVID-19 were similar to those of healthy controls.
Associations of HLA alleles with severe COVID-19 (sCOVID-19 vs. controls)
Severity of COVID-19 is directly related to the management of COVID-19 infection
and also contributes to mortality from COVID-19. Association studies of the 8 HLA genes
were carried out by comparing HLA allele frequencies in the 53 sCOVID-19 patients and 423
Japanese healthy controls (Table 1): HLA-A*11:01:01:01 [Pc = 0.013, OR = 2.26 (1.27–
3.91)], HLA*C*12:02:02:01 [Pc = 0.043, OR = 2.13 (1.18–3.71)] and HLA-B*52:01:01:02

[Pc = 0.021, OR = 2.22 (1.22–3.87)] were significantly associated with the severity of
COVID-19 after multiple corrections. To determine the independence of associated HLA
alleles, HLA haplotype analyses were carried out. A total of 4 haplotypes remained
significant after multiple corrections (Table 2), namely HLA-A*24:02:01:01-HLAB*52:01:01:02 [Pc = 0.039, OR = 2.06 (1.11–3.67)], HLA-A*24:02:01-HLA-C*12:02:02:01
[Pc = 0.039, OR = 2.06 (1.11–3.67)], HLA-C*12:02:02:01-HLA-B*52:01:01:02 [Pc = 0.020,
OR = 2.25 (1.24–3.92)] and HLA-A*24:02:01:01-HLA-C*12:02:01:01-HLA-B*52:01:01:02
[Pc = 0.033, OR = 2.09 (1.12–3.72)]. None of the HLA class II haplotypes or HLA class I HLA class II haplotypes remained significant after multiple corrections (Supplementary
Table 3). The most significantly associated HLA haplotype was HLA-C*12:02:02:01-HLAB*52:01:01:02 [Pc = 0.020, OR = 2.25 (1.24–3.92)], and the level of significance decreased
after including protective HLA-A*24:02:01:01 [Pc = 0.251, OR = 0.78 (0.49–1.22)] into the
abovementioned haplotype, HLA-A*24:02:01:01-HLA-C*12:02:01:01-HLA-B*52:01:01:02
[Pc = 0.033, OR = 2.09 (1.12–3.72)]. Subsequent conditional analysis (Table 3) was
performed on the statistically significant HLA alleles, HLA-A*11:01:01:01,
HLA*C*12:02:02:01 and HLA-B*52:01:01:02. Each of HLA-A*11:01:01:01 and
HLA*C*12:02:02:01 and HLA-B*52:01:01:02 were found to be independently associated
with severity of COVID-19. All HLA*C*12:02:02:01 alleles were shown to be tightly linked
with HLA-B*52:01:01:02 alleles and only a small proportion of A*11:01:01:01 alleles were
linked with HLA*C*12:02:02:01 and HLA-B*52:01:01:02 haplotypes (Figure 2).

Associations of HLA alleles with severe COVID-19 (sCOVID-19 vs. mCOVID-19)
To identify potential HLA markers that can be used to prioritize treatment for early
hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we compared HLA allele frequencies between the 53
sCOVID-19 patients and the 137 mCOVID-19 patients (Supplementary Table 4).
HLA*C*12:02:02:01 [Pc = 0.022, OR = 2.57 (1.29–5.09)] carrier was significantly associated
with increased severity of COVID-19 patients, while due to the smaller effect size,
HLA*C*12:02:02:01 and HLA-B*52:01:01:02 showed lower significance in comparison to
the 53 sCOVID-19 patients and 423 Japanese healthy controls (Table 1).
Discussion
We conducted a high-resolution sequencing-based typing of eight HLA genes to
evaluate the association of HLA alleles/haplotypes with SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility
and the severity of COVID-19. A total of 53 sCOVID-19 patients and 137 mCOVID-19
patients were recruited from the NCGM, Tokyo, Japan, from February to August 2020 and
423 previously recruited healthy controls were used as healthy comparators in this study.
To evaluate HLA alleles potentially associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2
infection, aCOVID-19 (Supplementary Table 1) and mCOVID-19 (Supplementary Table 2)
were compared with healthy controls, respectively. We found that no HLA alleles remained
significant after Bonferroni correction, suggesting that no HLA alleles were either protective
or conferred susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Patients with sCOVID-19 are tightly associated with COVID-19 mortality. We
observed that the HLA-A*11:01:01:01 [Pc = 0.013, OR = 2.26 (1.27–3.91)] allele and HLAC*12:02:02:01-HLA-B*52:01:01:02 [Pc = 0.020, OR = 2.25 (1.24–3.92)] haplotype were
significantly associated with the severity of COVID-19. A recent publication by Wang et al.
[23] reported significant associations of HLA-A*11:01, HLA-B*51:01, and HLA-C*14:02
with severe or critically severe Chinese COVID-19 patients compared to mild or moderate
Chinese COVID-19 patients. Accordingly, HLA-A*11:01 was significantly associated with
both Japanese and Chinese sCOVID-19 patients, while HLA-C*12:02:02:01-HLAB*52:01:01:02 and HLA-B*51:01-HLA-C*14:02 were associated in Japanese and Chinese,

respectively. The HLA associations of HLA-A*11:01 and HLA-C*12:02-HLA-B*52:01 are
of particular importance, as Asian populations carry relatively high frequencies of these HLA
alleles. Referring to the Allele Frequency Net Database (AFND) 2020 [25], HLA-C*12:02HLA-B*52:01 is commonly present in Japanese with a frequency of 10.5%, followed by
Asian populations residing in the United States (1.5–3.4%). On the other hand, HLAA*11:01 is predominant in South-east Asia (17.7–61.3%), Japan (8.2–11.1%), China (16.2–
61.3%) and the Oceania region (2.6–63.6%). We expect that HLA-A*11:01 and HLAC*12:02-HLA-B*52:01 could potentially act as a predictive marker for the severity of
COVID-19 in the Asia region.
However, we could not replicate results for B*46:01, which has been predicted to
have the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, thus Individuals carrying
B*46:01 are predicted to be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection [26]. Further, we
could not confirm the findings of an HLA-binding prediction study [3] that predicted HLAA*11:01, HLA-A*02:06, and HLA-B*54:01 as protective against SARS-CoV-2.
All samples used in this study were collected in the Center Hospital of the NCGM for
the period from February to August 2020, where the mutant strain of SARS-CoV-2 was not
yet prevalent in Japan. However, further studies are needed to evaluate correlations between
the emerging mutant strain of SARS-CoV-2 and severity of COVID-19.
