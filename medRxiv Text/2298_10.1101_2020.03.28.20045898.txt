ABSTRACT
The pandemic caused by coronavirus COVID-19 are of great concern. A detailed scientific analysis
of this phenomenon is still to come, but now it is urgently needed to evaluate the parameters of the
disease dynamics in order to make some preliminary estimations of the number of cases and
possible duration of the pandemic. The corresponding mathematical models must be simple enough,
since their parameters are unknown and have to be estimated using limited statistical data sets. The
SIR model, statistical approach to the parameter identification and the official WHO daily data
about the confirmed cumulative number of cases were used to calculate the SIR curves and make
some estimations and predictions. New cases in Italy could stop to appear after May 12, 2020, and
the final number of such accumulated cases could be around 112 thousand. Some prospects for the
global pandemic dynamics are discussed.
Keywords: coronavirus pandemic, epidemic outbreak in Italy, coronavirus COVID-19, coronavirus

Introduction
Here, we consider the development of epidemic outbreak in Italy caused by coronavirus
COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) (see e.g., [1]). Some investigations of the epidemic spreading in mainland
China [2–7] could be useful to understand the epidemic outbreak in other countries, since we deal
with the same pathogen. A preliminary comparison of the epidemic dynamics in Italy and in
mainland China has been done in [8, 9]. In [10] the global coronavirus epidemic dynamics was
analyzed. In this paper we will use the official WHO daily data [1] for the confirmed accumulated
number of patients (victims) V(t) (number of persons who caught the infection and got sick; t is

The official data about the accumulated number of confirmed cases in Italy Vj; European
region VEj , USA VUj and global numbers VGj (without cases inmainland China and the Republic of
Korea) from the WHO daily situation reports ( numbers 33-65, [1]) will be used. The corresponding
moments of time tj (in days) are also shown in Table 1.

SIR model and optimal values of its parameters
The SIR model for an infectious disease [6, 11–14] relates the number of susceptible persons
S (persons who are sensitive to the pathogen and not protected); the number of infected is I
(persons who are sick and spread the infection; please don’t confuse with the number of still ill
persons, so known active cases) and the number of removed R (persons who no longer spread the
infection; this number is the sum of isolated, recovered, dead, and infected people who left the
region);  and  are constants.

To determine the initial conditions for the set of equations (1–3), let us suppose that at the moment
of the epidemic outbreak t0 , [6, 14]:

I (t0 )  1 , R(t0 )  0 , S (t0 )  N  1 , N  S  I  R

(4)

The analytical solution for the set of equations (1–3) was obtained by introducing the function

V (t )  I (t )  R(t ) , corresponding to the number of victims or cumulative confirmed number of
cases, [14]:
The solution for the SIR set of differential equations depends on four parameters N,  ,

   /  , t0 , which can be identified with the use of the statistical approach developed in [14].
This method and Vj data set for Italy were used to define the optimal (the most reliable) values of
four parameters and calculate numbers of infected I , susceptible S, removed R persons and the
number of victims V=I+R . Corresponding dependences versus time are shown in Fig. 1.

Results for Italy
Usually the number of cases during the initial period of an epidemic outbreak is not reliable. To
avoid their influence on the results, only Vj values for the period February 5-22, 2020 ( 12  t j  29 )
were used for calculations (see blue “circles” in Fig. 1). Other points were used only for comparison

(blue “triangles”) and verification of predictions (blue “stars”). The use of data corresponding the
initial stage of the epidemic (“circles” and “triangles” together) did not yield a stable reliable
prediction. The calculated optimal values of parameters are:
N=534656;  =476712.744111309;  =3.47467962473570e-06; t0 =-18.3797687612985;
Now every person familiar with differential equations can use this data to integrate Eqs. (1–3)
with initial conditions (4) to obtain the SIR curves and to check the results of calculations (it is also
possible to use the analytical solution available in [6]). The values of final number of susceptible
persons S  423108 and the final number of victims (final accumulated number of cases)

V  111548 were calculated. Unfortunately, in Italy more people will be infected in comparison
with mainland China, where the saturation level V  81257 was predicted in [9] on March 4, 2020
in [9] (on March 24 the accumulated number of cases confirmed in mainland China is 81848, see
[1], situation report No 65). On March 9, 2020 it was calculated that the epidemic in Italy develops
more rapid than it was in China, [15]. Unfortunately, this conclusion seems to be true.

To estimate the duration of the coronavirus epidemic outbreak in Italy, we can use the
condition V (t final ) =1 which means that after this moment less than one person still spread the
infection. The calculations give us the value t final  79.5. According to this estimation, we can
expect that local transmission of the epidemic in Italy could stop only after May 12, 2020, provided
that existing quarantine measures and patient isolation rates continue.
It is also possible to calculate the value of parameter    =1.6564 and the inverse value

1/  =0.6037. Thus, the average time of spreading the infection in Italy can be estimated as 14.5
hours. By comparison, in South Korea was approximately 4.3 hours [16] and in mainland China 2.5 days [9]. By mid-April 2020, there will still be more than thousand people spreading the
infection in Italy (see green line in Fig. 1).
The calculated value t0 and blue line in Fig. 1 demonstrate that the first cases of
coronavirus infection have not been identified in Italy and sick people spread it rather long time. As
a result, more cases are expected in Italy in comparison with China. Probably, due to the rapid
isolation of infected persons, the more or less stable number of cases in South Korea (9137 on
March 24) is much smaller than in Italy.
All the parameters in SIR model are supposed to be constant. If the quarantine measures and
speed of isolation change or new infected persons are coming in the country, the accuracy of the
prediction reduces.

Discussion of global prospects
Since the recent situation in mainland China and the Republic of Korea is stable, The
estimations of global pandemic prospects have been done without cases in this two regions. The
corresponding numbers VGj are shown in the last column of Table 1 and in the Fig. 1 (magenta
“circles”). The number of cases VEj and VUj are also shown in Fig. 1 (brown and red “circles”
respectively). It can be seen that VEj, VUj and VGj numbers follow straight lines in the logarithmic
scale. It means that the epidemic dynamics in these regions is still exponential and is far from
stabilization.
To estimate the slopes of these lines the linear regression for the values log(VYj ), Y  E,U , G
was used (see, e.g., [14, 17]). The corresponding best fitting dashed lines are shown in Fig.1. To
avoid influence of the initial epidemic outbreak stages, calculations have been done only for

VYj  100, Y  E,U ; repeating values were used only once. It can be seen that the most rapid is the
epidemic in USA (the number of cases duplicates every 2.31 days). The European and global
duplications rates are 2.91 and 3.65 days respectively. Without stabilization by mid-April 2020 (22
days after March 24) we can have in Europe 41 million cases; 38 millions in USA and 211 millions

globally. Let us hope that quarantine measures and fast isolation of infected persons will reduce
these sad figures.
