Abstract
We investigate the transmissibility of coronavirus for symptomatic and asymptomatic
patients using the Ningbo Covid-19 data1. Through more in-depth and comprehensive
statistical analysis, we conclude that there is no difference in the transmission rates of
coronavirus between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, which is consistent
with the original findings in Chen et al.1

1. Introduction
Since outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in December
2019, the coronavirus has spread over the world at an unprecedented rate. By April 2,
2020, more than 150 countries have been affected by Covid-19 with a total of close to
one million confirmed cases and over 47,000 deaths. The Covid-19 has been declared
as an international public health emergency by the World Health Organization
(WHO).

During the incubation period, a percentage of coronavirus carriers may have
no symptoms or minimal symptoms and thus often go undetected. These covert
coronavirus carriers may not even be aware of the infection themselves, who however
would be confirmed as positive cases if tested using the reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). If the percentage of asymptomatic carriers is
large and if their transmissibility of coronavirus is as high as the symptomatic cases,
this would pose a great threat to the public. Therefore, it is critical to determine the
percentage and transmissibility of asymptomatic coronavirus carriers in the population.

It has been reported that the viral load detected in the asymptomatic patients
was similar to that in the symptomatic patients, which suggests the potential
transmissibility of asymptomatic patients.2 A familial cluster of five patients in Anyang,
China, demonstrated transmission of the coronavirus from an asymptomatic carrier
with normal chest computed tomography (CT) who was however tested positive after
all the five contacted family members had shown symptoms and confirmed with
positive RT-PCR test results.3 Another example of coronavirus infection by an
asymptomatic patient was a German case through the usual contact in business
meetings.4

2. Issues in the Original Analysis

Chen et al.1 carried out an important study using the Covid-19 data from the city
Ningbo, China, on the transmission rates of the coronavirus by the symptomatic and
asymptomatic cases. The estimated transmission rates for the symptomatic and
asymptomatic patients were 0.063 and 0.041 respectively, and the chi-squared test
yielded a p-value of 0.288, which indicates that there is no statistically significant
difference between the two transmission rates. They further investigated the
transmission rates for different relationships and different types of contact with the
infected patients including both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases and concluded
that the differences in the transmission rates are statistically significant across different
relationships and types of contact respectively. The closer the contact with the infected
patients, the higher chance of infection.

However, in their original statistical analysis1, the chi-squared tests were unduly
used because the counts in some cells of the contingency tables are rather small and
even zeros, which violates the assumptions of a chi-squared test and thus casts doubt on
the validity of the hypothesis test. Moreover, when comparing the transmission rates of
symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, Chen et al4 included the cases associated with a
super-spreader who mainly transmitted the disease in an air-conditioned bus and a
buddhism activity gathering. However, this may reduce the generalization of the
findings as the super-spreader should be regarded as an outlier and removed from the
primary analysis.

3. Reanalysis of the Ningbo Covid-19 Data
From January 21st to March 6th 2020, there were 157 symptomatic cases and
30 asymptomatic cases in the Ningbo Covid-19 data1. These infected cases resulted in
2147 close contacts with them, among which 2001 exposures were caused by the
symptomatic cases and 146 by the asymptomatic cases. The average number of close
contacts by the symptomatic cases is 13 and that by the asymptomatic cases is 5, and
the difference is statistically significant with a p-value of 6×10-6 from a permutation test

described in Algorithm 1. The larger number of close contacts by the symptomatic
cases may be due to the medical attentions they received after the confirmed diagnosis.

To allow for small cell counts including zeros in the contingency table, Fisher’s
exact tests5 are used to investigate the difference in the transmission rates between the
symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. We consider two scenarios: One combines the
numbers of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases as the total number of infected
patients, leading to a 2×2 table; and the other separates them, leading to a 2×3 table, as
shown in the top panel of Table 1.

From the results summarized in Table 1, we conclude that there is no significant
difference in the transmission rates between the symptomatic and asymptomatic cases,
either including or excluding the cases associated with the super-spreader. However,
the tests excluding the cases associated with the super-spreader yield larger p-values,
0.842 when combining the numbers of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases and
0.107 when separating them. As a result, there is no evidence in the data to rule out
the transmissibility of asymptotic carriers in comparison with symptomatic cases.

The odds ratio, estimated transmission rates and their difference between
symptomatic and asymptomatic cases as well as the corresponding 95% confidence
intervals are presented in the bottom panel of Table 1. The odds of transmitting the
coronavirus to a healthy individual by a symptomatic patient is 1.2 times of that by an
asymptomatic patient, which however is not statistically significant as the 95%
confidence interval covers one. Furthermore, as the 95% confidence intervals for the
difference of transmission rates cover zero, we conclude there is no difference in the
transmissibility of coronavirus through close contacts between symptomatic and
asymptomatic cases, which is consistent with the findings using Fisher’s exact tests.

The transmission rates under different relationships with the infected cases are
significantly different with both p-values <10-6 whether combining the symptomatic

and asymptomatic cases or not. With regard to different types of contact, the
transmission rates are also significantly different with p-values <10-6. As expected,
the more close contacts with the infected cases, the higher likelihood to contract the
coronavirus.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we provide a more in-depth analysis of the Ningbo Covid-19 data
to examine the difference in the transmissibility of coronavirus for symptomatic and
asymptomatic patients. We adopt more appropriate statistical methods, such as
Fisher’s exact tests, which require no assumptions on the cell counts in the
contingency table. We provide the odds ratio, estimated transmission rates, as well as
the corresponding 95% confidence intervals, and the conclusions remain the same that
there is no statistically significant difference in the transmissibility of coronavirus
between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
