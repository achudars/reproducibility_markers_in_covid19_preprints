Summary
Background The pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a
highly infectious disease, which was occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December
2019. As of February 13, 2020, a total of 59883 cases of COVID-19 in China have been
confirmed and 1368 patients have died from the disease. However, the clinical characteristics
of the dyed patients were still not clearly clarified. This study aims to summarize the clinical
characteristics of death cases with COVID-19 and to identify critically ill patients of
COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality.

Methods The clinical records, laboratory findings and radiologic assessments included chest
X-ray or computed tomography were extracted from electronic medical records of 25 died
patients with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 14 to Feb 13,
2020. Two experienced clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data.

Findings The mean age of the dead was 71.48 ± 12.42 years, the average course of the
disease was 10.56 ± 4.42 days, all patients eventually died of respiratory failure. All of those
who died had underlying diseases, the most common of which was hypertension (16/25, 64%),
followed by diabetes (10/25, 40%), heart diseases (8/25, 32%), kidney diseases (5/25, 20%),
cerebral infarction (4/25, 16%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 2/25, 8%),
malignant tumors (2/25, 8%) and acute pancreatitis (1/25, 4%). The most common organ
damage outside the lungs was the heart, followed by kidney and liver. In the patients’ last
examination before death, white blood cell and neutrophil counts were elevated in 17 patients
(17/25, 68%) and 18 patients (18/25, 72%), lymphocyte counts were decreased in 22
patients (22/25, 88%). Most patients’ PCT, CRP and SAA levels were elevated, the
percentages were 90.5% (19/21), 85% (19/20) and 100% (21/21) respectively. The levels of

Introduction
The pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious
disease, which was occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 (1). It is
reported that the person-to-person transmission in hospital and family settings has been
accumulating (2-4). The patients’ common clinical manifestations included fever, nonproductive
cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, normal or decreased leukocyte counts, and radiographic
evidence of pneumonia (5). Chen et al reported that mortality of COVID-19 was 4.3%, and severe
cases (treated in the ICU) were older, more likely to have underlying comorbidities, dyspnea and
anorexia (4). As of February 13, 2020, a total of 55748 cases of COVID-19 in China have been
confirmed and 1380 patients have died from the disease (6). However, the clinical characteristics
of the dyed patients were still not clearly clarified. In this study, we summarized the clinical
characteristics of 25 death cases with COVID-19, the purpose is to identify critically ill patients of
COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality.

Methods
Study design and patients
We performed a retrospective review of medical records from 25 death cases with COVID-19 in
Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 14 to Feb 13, 2020. All 25 dead patients with
COVID-19 tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by
use of RT-PCR on samples from there respiratory tract. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the
WHO's interim guidelines(7). This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical
Committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University.

Data collection
The clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory findings and radiologic assessments included chest
X-ray or computed tomography were extracted from electronic medical records. Two experienced
clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data. Data were entered into a computerized database and
cross-checked. The criteria for the confirmed-diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was that at least one gene
site was amplified to be positive for nucleocapsid protein (NP) gene and open reading frame (ORF)

1ab gene. In brief, the throat swab was put into a collection tube containing 150μl viral
preservation solution, and the total RNA was extracted within 2h with the respiratory sample RNA
separation Kit (Zhongzhi, Wuhan). The suspension was used for RT-PCR assay of SARS-CoV-2
RNA. Two target genes, including NP and ORF1ab, were simultaneously amplified and tested
during

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was done with SPSS, version 20.0. Continuous variables were directly
expressed as mean ± SD. Categorical variables were expressed as number (%).

Results
General clinical characteristics
Of the 25 deaths, 10 were male and 15 were female. The mean age of the dead was 71.48 ± 12.42
years, range from 55 to100 years. The average course of the disease was 10.56 ± 4.42 days, range
from 4 to 20 days. All patients eventually died of respiratory failure and respirator was used in 23
patients (23/25, 92%). All (25/25, 100%) of those who died had underlying diseases, the most
common of which was hypertension (16/25, 64%), followed by diabetes (10/25, 40%), heart
diseases (8/25, 32%), kidney diseases (5/25, 20%), cerebral infarction (4/25, 16%), chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 2/25, 8%), malignant tumors (2/25, 8%) and acute
pancreatitis (1/25, 4%). (Table.1)

Organ dysfunction in COVID-19
In addition to affecting respiratory function, the most common organ damage outside the lungs
was the heart, (18 patients’ serum hypersensitive troponin I (cTnI) or/and Amino-terminal
pro-brain natriuretic peptide (Pro-BNP) levels were increased (18/19, 94.7%)), followed by kidney
(12 patients’ serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or/and creatinine (Cr) levels were increased (12/25,
48%)) and liver (5 patients’ serum Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) levels were increased (5/25, 20%)). Besides, all the patients’ albumin levels were decreased.
(Table.2)

Inflammatory response in COVID-19
The routine blood test, procalcitonin (PCT), C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Serum amyloid A
(SAA) were used to reflect changes of inflammatory response in COVID-19. In the patients’ last
examination before death, white blood cell and neutrophil counts were elevated in 17 patients
(17/25, 68%) and 18 patients (18/25, 72%), lymphocyte counts were decreased in 22 patients
(22/25, 88%). Most patients had mild anemia, RBC and Hb levels were decreased in 20 (20/25,
80%) and 17 (17/25, 68%) patients respectively. Due to alimentary tract hemorrhage, the patient
17 had severe anemia. Most patients’ PCT, CRP and SAA levels were elevated, the percentages
were 90.5% (19/21), 85% (19/20) and 100% (21/21) respectively. (Table.3)

Specific biomarker that indicating poor prognosis
In order to screen for biomarker indicating poor prognosis, we observed the changes of
biochemical indicators in all patients (if repeated measurements were present). The results showed
that the levels of the last test of neutrophils (15/16, 93.8%), PCT (11/11, 100%), CRP (11/13,
84.6%), cTnI (8/9, 88.9%), D-Dimer (11/12, 91.6%) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (9/9, 100%)
were increased as compared to the first test, while the levels of lymphocytes were decreased
(14/16, 87.5%). The SAA maintained a high level. Chest CT scan showed that the patients’
pulmonary lesions were worse in the late stage than in the early stage (patient 3, patient 13 and
patient 14). (Fig.1)

In this study, we reported 25 death cases of with COVID-19. The clinical characters of these
patients indicated that the age and underlying diseases were the most important risk factors for
death. As concerning the underlying diseases, the most common one was hypertension, followed
by diabetes, Heart disease, kidney disease, cerebral infarction, COPD, malignant tumors and acute
pancreatitis.
The SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as one of a class of single-stranded enveloped 39 RNA
viruses, belonging to the beta-coronaviruses genus of the Coronaviridae family (1). The analysis
showed that both SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV shared a common ancestor that resembles the
bat coronavirus HKU9-1 (8). And the severity of some cases with SARS-CoV-2 was similar to
that of SARS-CoV (9). In the presents study, all the patients were died of respiratory failure,
which indicated that the lung is the most common target organ of SARS-CoV-2.
Multiple organ dysfunction could also be observed, the most common organ damage outside the
lungs was the heart, followed by kidney and liver. The results demonstrated that the death of the
patient may be primarily related to impaired cardiopulmonary function. All the patients’ albumin
levels and 80% and 68% of patients’ RBC and Hb levels were decreased, which indicates that
malnutrition is common to severe patients.
COVID-19 is a viral disease characterized by normal or low white blood cell count and decreased
lymphocyte count (10). In this study, increased white blood cell and neutrophils count were
observed in 68% and 72% of patients. In addition, PCT levels were elevated in 90.5% of patients.
PCT is sensitive indicator of bacterial infection (11). The results indicated that bacterial infections
may play an important role in promoting the death of patients.
CRP is a useful marker and gauge of inflammation, it plays an important role in host defense
against invading pathogens as well as in inflammation (12). SAA is a plasma protein that
transports lipids during inflammation (13). In the present study, CRP and SAA were elevated
before death in 85% and 100% of patients, suggesting that there is a severe inflammatory cascade
in patients with COVID-19.
In order to screen out biochemical indicators that are meaningful for the diagnosis of disease
progression, we consulted the laboratory test results of all the dead patients, among which 16
patients had repeated measurements. The SAA maintained a high level in all the patients, this
result indicated that elevated SAA levels are closely related to the poor prognosis of patients. The

levels of the first test of neutrophils (93.8%), PCT (100%), CRP (84.6%), cTnI (88.9%), D-Dimer
(91.6%) and LDH (100%) were increased as compared to the last test, while the levels of
lymphocytes were decreased (87.5%), suggesting that the rising of neutrophils, PCT, CRP, cTnI,
D-Dimer and LDH levels can be used as indicators of disease progression, as well as the decline
of lymphocytes counts.
This was a small sample size retrospective study, which was limited by the small numbers of
patients and by using a retrospective method. In particular, some important laboratory results were
incomplete.
In conclusion, the age and underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, etc.) is the most important
risk factors for death of COVID-19. Bacterial infections may play an important role in promoting
the death of patients. Malnutrition is common to severe patients. Multiple organ dysfunction can
be observed, the most common organ damage outside the lungs is the heart, followed by kidney
and liver. The rising of neutrophils, SAA, PCT, CRP, cTnI, D-Dimer and LDH levels can be used
as indicators of disease progression, as well as the decline of lymphocytes counts.
