Abstract
Objective: Google Trends (GT) is being used as an epidemiological tool to study coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) by identifying keywords in search trends that are predictive for the COVID-19
epidemiological burden. However, many of the earlier GT-based studies include potential statistical
fallacies by measuring the correlation between non-stationary time sequences without adjusting for
multiple comparisons or the confounding of media coverage, leading to concerns about the increased
risk of obtaining false-positive results. In this study, we aimed to apply statistically more favorable
methods to validate the earlier GT-based COVID-19 study results.
Methods: We extracted the relative GT search volume for keywords associated with COVID-19
symptoms, and evaluated their Granger-causality to weekly COVID-19 positivity in eight
English-speaking countries and Japan. In addition, the impact of media coverage on keywords with
significant Granger-causality was further evaluated using Japanese regional data.
Results: Our Granger causality-based approach largely decreased (by up to approximately one-third) the
number of keywords identified as having a significant temporal relationship with the COVID-19 trend
when compared to those identified by the Pearson correlation-based approach. “Sense of smell” and
“loss of smell” were the most reliable GT keywords across all the evaluated countries; however, when
adjusted with their media coverage, these keyword trends did not Granger-cause the COVID-19
positivity trends (in Japan).

Conclusion: Our results suggest that some of the search keywords reported as candidate predictive
measures in earlier GT-based COVID-19 studies may potentially be unreliable; therefore, caution is
necessary when interpreting published GT-based study results.

Introduction
Google Trends (GT) is a publicly available source of online Google search trafficking data
(https://trends.google.co.jp/trends), which allows users to visualize changes in time series related to the
general public’s online interest in certain keywords. It is used as one of the “infodemiology” tools [1] to
study epidemiological trends of certain disease outbreaks such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
epidemic and the Ebola outbreak [1]. As for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that became a worldwide
pandemic in early 2020 [2], the potential use of GT to predict COVID-19 cases or deaths has been
reported with regard to GT trends and keyword searches of “COVID-19” [3, 4] or any of its symptoms,
including chest pain, anosmia, dysgeusia, headache, shortness of breath, etc. [5-7] within the initial
months following the outbreak [4-9].
In many earlier studies analyzing GT trend data as an epidemiological tool, with a few
exceptions [10-12], analytical fallacies were of concern. First, Pearson (or Spearman) correlation is often
applied to assess the correlation between the time-series trends of COVID-19 cases/deaths and GT
trends in symptom keywords without confirming the stationarity of these time series, which is
sometimes critically inappropriate in the context of time-series analyses because it can increase the
likelihood of obtaining spurious correlations. Second, the Pearson/Spearman correlation tests were
repeated for each of the included symptom keywords (e.g., fever, cough, pneumonia, anosmia, sore
throat, headache, etc. [7]) without adequate adjustment for multiple comparisons, which would also

increase the risk of false-positive results. Third, because COVID-19 and its symptoms have attracted
intensive attention worldwide, the influence of media coverage on GT symptom keywords is inevitable
[9, 13, 14], which has hardly been adjusted in a statistically favorable manner.
Based on the above analytical concerns for earlier studies, by using the vector autoregression
(VAR) model [10-12] in this study, we aim to identify statistically more reliable symptom keywords for
which GT trends may be used as a predictive measure for future COVID-19 positivity trends, and to
validate the earlier study results.

Methods
Extracting Google Trends and COVID-19 data
All the following data handling and analyses were performed using R 3.5.2 (R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria). A statistical level of less than 0.05 is considered significant if not stated
otherwise. COVID-19 data and Google Trends (GT) data were separately analyzed in nine different
regions: Japan (JP) and eight English-speaking countries, namely, Australia (AU), Canada (CA), Great
Britain (GB), Ireland (IE), India (IN), Singapore (SG), United States (US), and South Africa (ZA).
The three-year (October 1, 2017–October 25, 2020) time series GT trend data for keywords of
symptoms that may be related to COVID-19 was queried using R package gtrendsR [15]. Individual
queries were separately conducted for each keyword in all nine regions. Search keywords were defined
as listed in Table 1: 54 English keywords were used for search in eight English-speaking country regions,
and the corresponding 60 Japanese keywords (as listed in S1 Table) were used for searches in the Japan
region. The obtained data were the weekly relative search volume for each keyword, of which the
maximum value during the included period was normalized to 100%. For the timings when the relative
search volume was 1% or less, we imputed them as 0%.
For COVID-19 data on serial daily number of positive cases from January 22, 2020, we
downloaded data from the web database
(https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases, accessed on October 30, 2020)

provided by the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Since we did not
include the number of positive cases from mainland China, we imputed the number of COVID-19 cases
before January 22, 2020 as zero (even for 2017–2019). The COVID-19 daily case data were converted
to weekly serial data, in reference to the above GT weekly trend data.

Preprocessing and analysis
The keyword weekly trend data were further processed as shown in Fig 1. Fig 1A (uppermost row) is the
three-year original GT time series for “chest pain” in the United States region. The sequence was
processed using R package stats to remove seasonality (one-year level) and the general trend from the
original series, and the remaining random series (Fig 1A, lowermost row) was used as the keyword trend
data to analyze [10]. Then, the obtained series were evaluated with an augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF)
test using R package tseries [16] to examine whether the sequence was stationary (Fig 1B). If the series
was not considered stationary, the sequence was further differenced so that the differenced series became
stationary (as confirmed by the ADF test again).
Next, the temporal relationship between the processed sequence for each keyword and the
COVID-19 weekly positivity data was analyzed with the VAR model [10, 11] (Fig 1C), using R package
vars [17]. Since the COVID-19 weekly positivity trend data was actually not stationary by itself, its
difference sequence was imputed to the VAR analysis. The adequate lag was determined from the lag

order range of 1-4, 1-6, or 1-8, based on the Akaike’s information criterion. Then, using the obtained
VAR model, we assessed whether the keyword’s trend Granger-caused the COVID-19 positivity trends
[10, 11] (Fig 1D). This implied that the change in the keyword trend could have the potential to
practically predict the near-future change in the COVID-19 positivity trend. The causality here was
merely a statistical one and did not require true causal mechanisms between the two trends. One p-value
was obtained for the Granger-causality of one keyword to the COVID-19 trend and the
Granger-causality analysis was performed for all the keywords. We adjusted multiple testing using the
Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method [18] within the country-wise groups. The BH method regulates the
false discovery rate (FDR), which has a smaller risk of false-positivity than the raw p-value and is more
powerful than the most stringent Bonferroni method.
In addition, as a reference, we also calculated the Pearson correlation between the raw GT
keyword trends and the COVID-19 weekly positivity trends, as in the earlier GT-based COVID-19
studies. Pearson’s p-values were similarly adjusted with the BH method.

Incorporating media coverage trends
We then evaluated the media coverage of the obtained GT keywords with a statistically reliable temporal
relationship with the COVID-19 weekly positivity trend. Due to the shortness of available data, we
could only analyze the media coverage trend of those keywords in the Japan region. We reviewed Nikkei

Telecom (http://telecom.nikkei.co.jp), a large Japanese database covering newspapers, TV news, Internet
news, and general magazines published in Japan, to measure the weekly number of published articles in
which the title/abstract/manuscript included the identified Japanese keyword. Specialized magazines
were excluded from the reviewed publication review because they might have less exposure to the
general population. The obtained time series of the weekly count of articles containing the keyword was
used as the media coverage trend in Japan. Then, we again evaluated whether the identified GT keyword
trend still Granger-caused the COVID-19 weekly positivity, even when adjusted with the simultaneous
media coverage trend of the keyword. This partial Granger-causality analysis was performed using the R
package FIAR [19].

This study was approved by the University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine Institutional Ethics
Committee (ID: 11628-(3)). Informed consent was not required because the data were publicly

Results
General COVID-19 related trends
During the three-year period from October 1, 2017 to October 25, 2020, different countries experienced
different timings in their COVID weekly positivity trends and the related GT search trends. Fig 2 shows
weekly trends of each country (from upper-left to lower-right in alphabetical order by country code).
The solid lines show the weekly COVID-19 positivity trends while the dotted lines denote GT search
volume trends for the “COVID” keyword in each region (or its corresponding Japanese keyword in
Japan). Both trends are plotted in a normalized manner so that the maximum value of each trend within
the reviewed period becomes 100%. Briefly, as of late October 2020, for both the COVID-19 weekly
positivity trend and the COVID search volume trends, Australia (AU), Japan (JP), and the United States
(US) experienced their first and second waves (i.e., large positive peaks), while Canada (CA), Great
Britain (GB), and Ireland (IE) are currently experiencing their second wave. Meanwhile, although India
(IN) and South Africa (ZA) experienced delayed first waves of weekly COVID-19 positivity compared
to other countries, search volume trends showed the first wave surge, the timing of which was similar to
that of the other countries.

VAR model in comparison with Pearson correlation
Next, we conducted a VAR model analysis. Table 2 summarizes the number of keywords of which GT
trends had significant (p-value or FDR < 0.05) temporal relationships with the COVID-19 weekly
positivity trends, in terms of Granger-causality (by the GT keyword trend onto the COVID-19 weekly
positivity trend; columns A and B) or Pearson correlation (columns C and D). For all the countries, the
number of significant keywords was smaller in Granger-causality than in Pearson correlation (columns A
vs. C, B vs. D), and the influence of multiple test adjustment (BH method) seemed to be larger in terms
of Granger-causality (columns A to B) than in Pearson correlation (columns C to D). Specifically, the
number of significant keywords identified by Granger-causality (with multiple tests adjusted: mean 11.7
± 8.6 words) (Table 2, column B) decreased to approximately one-third when compared to those
identified by unadjusted Pearson correlation (mean 32.1 ± 8.7 words) (Table 2, column C), especially in
countries such as India, Japan, Singapore, and South Africa (outside Europe or North America). These
results suggest that the current approach with appropriately adjusted Granger-causality analysis yields
more stringent and statistically reliable results than the unadjusted Pearson correlation test, depending on
the region.
The detailed results of the keywords that had significant Granger-causality (FDR < 0.05) to the
weekly COVID-19 positivity trends are shown in Table 3 in decreasing order of identified frequency
across the nine countries. Only keyword trends that had significant Granger-causality in four or more

countries (out of the nine countries) are listed. The asterisk indicates that the keyword (in row) had
significant Granger-causality in that country (in column). The lag order of the VAR model of each
keyword is determined from the range of 1-4. The anosmia-related keyword “loss of smell” (or its
corresponding Japanese keywords (S1 Table)) was identified in all nine countries, and the keyword
“sense of smell” (or its corresponding Japanese keyword) was identified in five out of the nine countries.
Fig 3 visualizes GT search volume trends for “loss of smell” (or its corresponding Japanese
word) for each country (dotted lines), which showed a clear temporal relationship with weekly
COVID-19 positivity trends (solid lines). Other identified symptom keywords were as follows: “cough”
(5/9 countries), “loss of taste” (5/9), “runny nose” (5/9), “stuffy nose” (5/9), “sore throat” (5/9), “sore”
(5/9), “shortness of breath” (5/9), “diarrhea” (4/9), “headache” (4/9), and “pneumonia” (4/9). These are
well-known symptoms of COVID-19 [2, 20] and partly overlap with the GT keywords reported to have
significant associations with weekly COVID-19 case trends [5-7].

Media coverage of keywords
The Japanese keywords corresponding to “loss of smell” and “sense of smell” were the only significant
ones in Japan (Table 3, filled cells) and were also the most frequently identified keywords across the
different countries, so we selected them to further assess the effect of media coverage trends on these
keywords in the Japanese data. Fig 4 presents the temporal relationship between the weekly COVID-19

positivity trend (solid lines), the GT trend of the Japanese keywords (dotted lines) corresponding to (A)
“loss of smell” or (B) “sense of smell,” and their media coverage trends (dashed lines). Apparently, in
both keywords (A and B), the GT keyword trends were very similar to the trends in their media coverage.
Notably, both the Granger-causality of the keywords “loss of smell” and “sense of smell” to the weekly
COVID-19 positivity trend became non-significant when adjusted with their media coverage by partial
Granger-causality analysis (p = 0.257 and p = 0.384, respectively). These results suggest a relationship
between weekly COVID-19 positivity trends and that the GT trends of anosmia-related keywords are
highly confounded by their media coverage.

Discussion
In summary, based on the potential analytical fallacies that are of concern in earlier GT studies, our
current study aimed to identify symptom keywords in GT trends that could be used as a predictive
measure for future weekly COVID-19 positivity trends by applying more statistically favorable methods.
However, the current analysis showed that the number of search keywords that are truly associated with
weekly COVID-19 positivity trends may be smaller than reported in earlier studies using a simple
Pearson/Spearman correlation, of which the degree depends on the region. In addition, even the GT
trends of most reliable anosmia-related keywords were actually a strong reflection of its media coverage
(at least in Japan). These results suggest that many of the search keywords reported as candidate
predictive measures in earlier GT studies may actually turn out to be false-positive. In other words, the
potential candidate keywords listed in the earlier GT-based COVID-19 infodemiological studies are not
always reliably usable as true predictive measures. We need to be careful when interpreting published
study results as the utility of Google Trends for studying COVID-19 epidemiology may be more limited
than previously expected.
The major strength of our study is its statistically favorable approach with a longer period of
included observations. For example, our results evaluating the trend in media coverage of the “loss of
smell” keyword is partly consistent with a few of the earlier studies [7, 9]. However, in previous studies,
the potential effect of media coverage was not evaluated in a statistically favorable manner, and the

association between GT trends and weekly COVID positivity trends had been evaluated in an
inappropriate way (i.e., Pearson correlation). Moreover, earlier GT studies did not always examine many
symptom keywords related to COVID-19 comprehensively as in our study, so that selection bias cannot
be excluded. In contrast, our approach of narrowing down the candidate keywords to adjust for their
media coverage was data-driven with a smaller risk of bias in keyword selection. In addition, because
our study included a longer period of data (up until October 2020) than most of the earlier GT-based
COVID-19 studies, which only included serial data within the first wave (e.g., up until July 2020 in the
United States and Japan), lessons based on our results may have higher applicability to the second or
later waves of weekly COVID-19 positivity trends.
Our study has some limitations. For example, in the VAR model, the effect of each variable is
assumed to be fixed throughout the reviewed period, which may not always be true because the public
interest and attitude toward COVID-19 could vary over time [21]. This can be suspected by the
decreased peak of GT trend for the “COVID” keyword in the second wave (Fig 2, in Australia, Japan,
and the United States). In future studies, state space modeling [22] to incorporate potentially
time-varying effects may be useful to overcome the potential weakness of the VAR model, especially
when the included period becomes so long. In addition, the keywords’ media coverage was adjusted only
in Japanese regional data, which makes the obtained results slightly less generalizable to other countries.
The Nikkei telecom we used for media review would not cover all potentially influencing media such as

TV talk shows, or social media (e.g., Twitter [23] or Instagram [24]).
To conclude, our current results using a more statistically favorable approach suggest that many
of the search keywords identified as candidate predictive measures in earlier GT studies have the
potential risk of false positives, and that we need to be careful in interpreting the earlier GT-based
COVID-19 study results.

The number of keywords in which GT trend had a significant Granger-caused COVID-19 positivity
trends (A, raw p-value < 0.05; B, FDR < 0.05), and the number of keywords whose GT trend had
significant Pearson correlation with the COVID-19 positivity trends (C, raw p-value < 0.05; D, FDR <
0.05). For Granger causality in each region, the lag order of the VAR model is varied in the range of
[1-4], [1-6], and [1-8], respectively.

Detailed results of the keywords that have significant Granger-causality to the COVID-19 positivity
trends, in the order of frequency across all the countries. Only keywords that were significant in 4 or
more countries (out of 9) are shown. The asterisk indicates that the keyword (in row) had significant
Granger-causality in that country (in column). The lag order of the VAR model of each keyword is
determined from the range of 1-4.

Figure legends
Fig 1. Outline of preprocessing flow
The sequence was processed to remove seasonality (1-year level) and general trend from the original
series, and the remaining random series (A, lowermost row) was used as the keyword trend data. Then,
the obtained series were evaluated with an ADF test to examine its stationarity (B). Next, the temporal
relationship between the processed sequence of each single keyword and the COVID-19 weekly
positivity data was analyzed using the VAR model (C). Then we assessed whether the keyword trend
Granger-causes COVID-19 positivity trends (D).

Fig 2. COVID-19 weekly positivity trends and related GT search volume trends for ‘COVID’ in
each region.
Figures show weekly trends of each country (from upper-left to lower-right in alphabetical order of
country name), where the solid lines show COVID-19 positivity trends while the dotted lines denote GT
search volume trends for ‘COVID’ word (or its corresponding Japanese word) in each region. Both
trends are plotted in a normalized manner so that the maximum value within the period becomes 100%.
X-axis in months since October 2019 to September 2020.

Fig 3. COVID-19 weekly positivity trends and the GT search volume trends for ‘loss of smell’ in
each region
The relative GT search volume trends for the ‘loss of smell’ word (or its corresponding Japanese word)
of each country (in dotted lines), which has clear temporal relationship with the COVID-19 positivity
trends (in solid lines). X-axis in months since October 2019 to September 2020.

Fig 4. COVID-19 weekly positivity trends, Google Trends relative search volume trends for ‘loss of
smell’ and ‘sense of smell’, and their media coverage trends in Japan
Temporal relationship between the COVID-19 positivity trend (in solid lines), the GT trend of the
Japanese keywords (in dotted lines) corresponding to (A) ‘loss of smell’ or (B) ‘sense of smell’, and
their media coverage trends (in dashed lines). Apparently, in both keywords (A and B), the GT keyword
trends were very similar to the trends in their media coverage.
