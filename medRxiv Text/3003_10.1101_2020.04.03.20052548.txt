Abstract
Given the high need and the absence of specific antivirals for treatment of COVID-19 (the
disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV2]), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors are being considered as
therapeutic alternatives. Prezcobix/Rezolsta is a fixed-dose combination of 800 mg of the HIV
protease inhibitor darunavir (DRV) and 150 mg cobicistat, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, which is
indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection. There
are currently no definitive data on the safety and efficacy of DRV/cobicistat for treatment of
COVID-19. The in vitro antiviral activity of darunavir against a clinical isolate from a patient
infected with SARS-CoV-2 was assessed. DRV showed no activity against SARS-CoV-2 at
clinically relevant concentrations (EC50 >100 μM). Remdesivir, used as a positive control,
showed potent antiviral activity (EC50 = 0.38 μM). Overall, the data do not support the use of
DRV for treatment of COVID-19.

Introduction

In December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus disease-2
2019 (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (1). The virus was
subsequently identified as a coronavirus (CoV), in addition to SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East
respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) that passed from animals to humans where it can
cause severe respiratory illness (2). As of March 2020, COVID-19 has spread around the world
with the WHO declaring a global pandemic (3). Given the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic,
there is an urgent need to identify potential treatments for the disease as well as to develop a
vaccine.
As no specific antivirals for treatment of COVID-19 are available, one avenue of clinical interest
is the use of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors (PIs) as a therapeutic
intervention. The potential for HIV PIs as a treatment for COVID-19 is mainly based on limited
virologic and clinical data on the HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir with low-dose ritonavir (as a
pharmacoenhancer; LPV/r) in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome related
to a coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (4). After demonstrating the in vitro antiviral activity of LPV
against SARS-CoV-1, the clinical response of patients with SARS to a combination of LPV/r and
ribavirin was examined. Patients treated with LPV/r had lower rates of adverse clinical outcomes
at day 21 following the onset of symptoms compared with historical controls (4). However,
recent data in hospitalized adults with severe confirmed COVID-19 treated with LPV/r in addition
to a standard care of ventilation, oxygen, vasopressor support, antibiotics and renalreplacement therapy showed that there was no significant improvement in time to clinical
improvement or mortality at day 28 compared with the standard care (5).
The HIV PI darunavir with cobicistat as a pharmacoenhancer (DRV/c, 800/150 mg given orally
once daily with food) in combination with other antiretroviral agents is approved for both
treatment-naïve and -experienced patients with HIV-1 infection (6-7). The efficacy and safety

profile of boosted-DRV combination therapy is well-established in the HIV setting, based on
phase III clinical studies as well as real-world evidence (8–11).
To date, no clear clinical evidence supports the use of DRV (boosted with either ritonavir or
cobicistat) in viral diseases other than HIV.
In this paper, the antiviral activity of DRV against SARS-CoV-2 was investigated in an in vitro
model at clinically relevant concentrations. When DRV/c is taken at the indicated once-daily
dose, the median trough plasma concentration of DRV was 3.4 µM (1875 ng/mL). (6). This cell
culture assay was shown to be suitable for antiviral assays. Productive viral infection takes
place in this model with the number of SARS-CoV RNA molecules increasing continuously after
infection, indicating that the virus undergoes full replicatory cycles (12). Remdesivir (GS-5734),
a nucleotide analog initially developed for Ebola virus disease, has shown to inhibit SARS-CoV2 replication in vitro with an EC50 equal to 0,770 µM (13) and was therefore used as a positive
control.

Methods

Cell Culture and Virus Preparation
Human colon carcinoma cell line (Caco-2) cells (obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung von
Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany) were cultured in Minimal Essential
Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and containing penicillin (100
IU/mL) and streptomycin (100 μg/mL) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. All culture reagents
were purchased from Sigma (Hamburg, Germany).

SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from human samples and cultured in Caco-2 cells, as previously
described (3). After one passage in Caco-2 cells, viral stocks were stored at –80°C prior to use.

Assessment of Antiviral Activity by Inhibition of Virus-Induced Cytopathogenic Effect
Confluent layers of Caco-2 cells were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 72 hours on
96 multi-well plates (50,000 cells/well). Cells were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity
of infection (MOI) of 0.01. Virus was added together with the compounds under investigation
and incubated in MEM supplemented with 1% FBS.
DRV and remdesivir were synthesized at Johnson & Johnson. To assess in vitro antiviral
activity, DRV and remdesivir, diluted in MEM without FBS, were added in 4-fold dilutions to a
concentration range of 0.02 μM to 100 μM. Cells were then incubated for 48 hours before the
cytopathogenic effect (CPE) was visually scored by two independent laboratory technicians.
Evaluation of CPE was also done using an 3-(4,5-dimetiltiazol-2-il)-2,5-difeniltetrazolio (MTT;
Sigma-Aldrich) method according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Optic densities were
measured at 560/620 nm in a Multiskan Reader MCC/340 Labsystems. Three independent
experiments with triplicate measurements were performed. Evaluation of inhibition of CPE using

the MTT method was done for two of the three experiments. Data were analyzed by a fourparameter curve-fitting from a dose-response curve using GraphPad Prism (version 7.00) to
calculate the EC50 (concentration of the compound that inhibited 50% of the infection) based on
visual CPE scoring or based on the MTT method.

Assessment of Cell Viability
To assess the effects of the compounds on Caco–2 cell viability, cell viability was measured in
confluent cell layers treated with a range of compound concentrations in absence of virus using
the Rotitest Vital (Roth) according to manufacturer’s instructions, as previously described (12).
All assays were performed three times independently in triplicate. From this the CC50 (cytotoxic
concentration of the compound that reduced cell viability to 50%) was calculated from a doseresponse curve in GraphPad Prism (version 7.00) using four-parameter curve-fitting.

Selectivity Index
The selectivity index for each of the compounds was determined as the ratio of the CC50 to the
EC50.

Modelling
In general, in silico docking can be a useful approach for identifying subsets of molecules for in
vitro studies and can be used to explain in vitro observations on a structural level. The
coordinates of the crystal structure of the main SARS-CoV-2 protease were retrieved from the
PDB database (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6lu7).
Preparing DRV and the protein for in silico molecular docking was performed with the software
package MOE (Molecular Operating Environment 2019.01; Chemical Computing Group ULC,
Montreal, QC, Canada, H3A 2R7, 2019). The force field used was AMBER ETH:10 with default

Results
Assessment of In Vitro Antiviral Activity, Cytotoxicity and Selectivity
Remdesivir showed strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 of 0.11 µM
based on visual scoring of inhibition of CPE (Figure 1a). In the same experiments, DRV did not
show any inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 induced CPE (Figure 1b; EC50 >100 μM). Similar results
were obtained using the MTT method. Remdesivir showed potent antiviral activity with an EC50
value of 0.38 μM (Figure 1a), while DRV showed no effect (EC50 >100 μM, Figure 1b). No
cytotoxicity of remdesivir or DRV was observed on Caco-2 cells with CC50 values >100 μM. The
selectivity index (CC50 / EC50) for DRV could not be calculated (>100 µM / >100 µM for SARSCoV-2) due to the lack of antiviral activity. In contrast, remdesivir had a selectivity index of >900
by visual CPE scoring and >260 by the MTT method, confirming a strong in vitro antiviral effect
against SARS-CoV-2.

Modelling
In silico docking of DRV in the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CL
protease) identified five docking poses. The docking scores ranged from S= -8.6 to -8.2,
showing that DRV can fit into the pocket, but these values are indicative of suboptimal binding
to this protein. Visual inspection of each of these poses showed very few interactions of DRV
with the active site of the protease, and the catalytic cysteine residue was not directly targeted,
unlike the many strong interactions observed for DRV bound to the HIV protease (14).

Discussion
Current efforts to manage the COVID-19 pandemic have largely focused on improved hygiene,
quarantine of infected individuals, social distancing to limit transmission and development of a
vaccine (15). Despite the expedited efforts to develop a vaccine and collaborative efforts to
screen compounds in discovery and development across the broader pharmaceutical industry
for activity against COVID-19, patients are in immediate need of therapeutic interventions (12,
16).

Current data on the therapeutic effect of HIV protease inhibitors in patients with COVID-19 are
far from comprehensive. This study demonstrated that DRV showed no in vitro antiviral activity
against SARS-CoV-2 at clinically relevant concentrations. Furthermore, structural analyses
using protease structures are consistent with these data. DRV binds to the active site of the HIV
virus’ dimeric aspartic protease (14). The crystal structure of this protease is well-elucidated and
has been shown to have an extensive hydrogen-bonding network with DRV, allowing for the
potent in vitro activity (EC50 values = 1.2 to 8.5 nM) of this protease inhibitor against HIV (6-7).
By contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a cysteine protease (Protein Data Bank-code
6LU7) and while several docking poses have been found for DRV in in silico models, unlike in
HIV, these poses showed little interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 main protease active site.
Several publications describe in silico docking experiments on the main coronavirus protease
that specifically focus on or include DRV (17–21). Although these studies suggest DRV as a
candidate for further investigation, such promising docking results could not be reproduced in
our in silico docking studies. Such discrepancies can often result from in silico docking, which is
primarily a useful approach for identifying subsets of molecules for in vitro activity testing. No in
vitro antiviral activity of DRV against SARS-CoV-2 was found in the experiments reported here.

In this study, remdesivir demonstrated activity against SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 of 0.38 μM,
which is in line with the earlier reported remdesivir EC50 of 0.77 µM, indicating that the in vitro
antiviral assay used is appropriate to assess antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (12).

In conclusion, the lack of in vitro antiviral activity of DRV against SARS-CoV-2 does not support
the use of DRV for treatment of COVID-19. Hence, the use of DRV (boosted with either ritonavir
or cobicistat) should remain solely for treatment of patients with HIV infection.
