Abstract

28

The current pandemic emergence of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) poses a relevant

29

threat to global health. SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by a wide range of clinical

30

manifestations, ranging from absence of symptoms to severe forms that need intensive care

31

treatment. Here, plasma-EDTA samples of 30 patients compared with age- and sex-matched

32

controls were analyzed via untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics

33

and lipidomics. With the same approach, the effect of tocilizumab administration was evaluated in

34

a subset of patients. Despite the heterogeneity of the clinical symptoms, COVID-19 patients are

35

characterized by common plasma metabolomic and lipidomic signatures (91.7% and 87.5%

36

accuracy, respectively, when compared to controls). Tocilizumab treatment resulted in at least

37

partial reversion of the metabolic alterations due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, NMR-

38

based metabolomic and lipidomic profiling provides novel insights into the pathophysiological

39

mechanism of human response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and to monitor treatment outcomes.

Author summary

41

The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2

42

(SARS-CoV-2) is markedly affecting the world population. Here we report about the small-

43

molecule profile of patients hospitalized during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using

44

magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we showed that the infection induces profound changes in the

45

metabolome. The analysis of the specific metabolite changes and correlations with clinical data

46

enabled the identification of potential biochemical determinants of the disease fingerprint. We

47

also followed how metabolic alterations revert towards those of the control group upon treatment

48

with tocilizumab, a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6

49

receptor. These results open up possibilities for the monitoring of novel patients and their

50

individual response to treatment.

Introduction

53

54

The World Health Organization announced COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic in March 2020 [1,2].

55

At the beginning of October 2020 over thirty-four millions of patients have been diagnosed by

56

SARS-CoV-2 infection and about 1 million deaths are reported all over the world [3]. The SARS-

57

CoV-2 infection is characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations, ranging from absence

58

of symptoms to severe forms that need intensive care treatment. About 20% of patients,

59

particularly the older ones and those affected by chronic comorbidities such as hypertension,

60

diabetes mellitus, renal and heart diseases, may develop interstitial pneumonia and respiratory

61

distress requiring oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation [4]. In addition to interstitial

62

pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), COVID-19 is associated with other

63

life-threatening complications such as sepsis, thromboembolism and multi-organ failure [5].

64

Patients with the highest rate of morbidity and mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection develop

65

a hyperinflammatory syndrome due to the overproduction of early response proinflammatory

66

cytokines (such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, MCP-1) – the so called “cytokine storm” – leading to an

67

increased vascular permeability, activation of coagulation pathways, dysregulation of T cells with

68

associated lymphopenia, multiorgan injury and rapid clinical deterioration [6–9].

69

Metabolomics and lipidomics can contribute a system level picture, thus expanding the options

70

that chemists can explore to help fight the pandemic [10]. The human metabolome is composed

71

by an ensemble of several thousands of small molecules (<1500–2000 Da) present on a very

72

ample range of concentrations (from <1 nM to >1 μM) and produced by the genome of the host

73

organism and by the genomes of its microflora, as well as deriving from exogenous factors like

74

medical treatments [11]. Blood plasma is a primary carrier of small molecules in the body, the

75

relative concentrations of which reflect the physio-pathological state of the organism and thus,

76

possible tissue lesions and organ dysfunctions. The overall picture is complemented by

77

alterations in the lipid components [12]. As a consequence, metabolomics and lipidomics of

78

serum and plasma are increasingly used for successful patient stratification in various diseases

79

[13–18]. Herein, a strong metabolomic and lipidomic signature of COVID-19 is revealed via

80

untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of plasma-EDTA [19,20] from 30

81

patients compared with age- and sex-matched controls. Moreover, in a subset of patients, the

82

metabolic effects due to tocilizumab administration were successfully investigated. This study had

83

no sample-size calculation; the analysis included 30 patients who met the inclusion criteria and

84

were admitted during the first wave of the pandemic at the local university hospital , before the

85

rapid decline of hospitalizations for COVID-19.

87

Results and Discussion

88

89

We analyzed via 1H NMR spectroscopy the metabolomic and lipidomic profiles of plasma-EDTA

90

samples obtained from 30 patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-

91

CoV-2 infection was confirmed by positive RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The

92

plasma-EDTA samples available for the metabolomic analysis were collected between 2-23 days

93

from clinical onset (mean 9 days). Samples from 30 non COVID-19 subjects, one-to-one matched

94

for age and sex, were used as control group (CTR). Tocilizumab, a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor

95

monoclonal antibody, was administered to 8 of the 30 COVID-19 patients enrolled and another

96

plasma-EDTA sample for each patient was collected after 2-18 days of treatment (mean 5 days).

97

Demographic and clinical characteristics of enrolled patients are reported in S1 Table. Our

98

analyses considered 21 quantified metabolites and 114 lipoprotein-related parameters [21].

99

Lipoprotein quantification of plasma samples of two COVID-19 patients (COVID-19-025 and

100

COVID-19-027) was not possible for the presence of an interfering signal in the spectra, thus also

101

their respective matched controls (CTR-4 and CTR-7) were removed from the lipoprotein

102

analyses.

103

No outliers were identified using principal component analysis on the entire population, both for

104

metabolite and lipoprotein profiles (S1 Fig).

105

Plasma metabolite and lipoprotein profiles of COVID-19 patients and CTRs were compared using

106

the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The eight samples collected post-tocilizumab treatment are

107

not included in these analyses. The RF model built on metabolite concentrations shows a

108

significant differential clustering with 91.7% accuracy, 93.3% sensitivity, and 90.0% specificity

109

(Figs 1A and C, S2A Fig, Table S2). In particular, a panel of 11 metabolites (Fig 1D, S3 Table)

110

displays significant alterations between COVID-19 patients and CTRs. One of them, giving rise to

111

a detectable multiplet signal in the region between 7.21-7.30 ppm has not been assigned and is

112

referred as “unknown”. However, even if this signal is removed from the statistical model, the

113

discrimination accuracy between COVID-19 patients and CTRs does not change significantly.

114

The RF model built on lipoprotein-related parameters shows a significant differential clustering

115

with 87.5% accuracy, 85.7% sensitivity, and 89.3% specificity (Fig 1B-C, S2B Fig, S2 Table).

116

Fourty eight features (Fig 1E, S4 Table) display significant alterations between COVID-19

117

patients and CTRs. These results demonstrate that COVID-19 patients are characterized by

118

higher levels of VLDL particles, and lower levels of Apo A1, Apo A2, cholesterol and free-

119

cholesterol HDL and LDL subfractions. In particular, the subfractions HDL-3, HDL-4, LDL-4, LDL-

120

5 of cholesterol are the most affected.

121

122

Correlations between clinical and metabolomic parameters were calculated and the results are

123

reported in Fig 2.

124

Phenylalanine significantly correlates with C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6.

125

Inflammation and immune activation impair the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, as

126

observed in patients suffering from sepsis, cancer, or HIV-1 infection [22–25]; accordingly, we

127

found higher phenylalanine levels and a trend in lower tyrosine amounts in patients than in

128

controls. Interestingly, a positive correlation between phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio and high CRP

129

levels, has been already described by Murr and colleagues [26] in patients affected with coronary

130

artery disease (CAD). These data are in accordance with ours, since SARS-CoV-2 infection is

131

characterized not only by immune activation and systemic phlogosis, but also by microvascular

132

endothelial damage and activation of coagulative cascade, as happens in CAD. Alveolar-arterial

133

O2 gradient anticorrelates with citrate, accordingly the partial pressure of arterial oxygen and

134

fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio (known as Horowitz index) and the ratio between

5

135

oxygen saturation and fraction of inspired oxygen (SaO2/FiO2) positively correlates with citrate.

136

This metabolite is known for its anti-oxidative, anti-coagulant and anti-inflammatory properties

137

[27–29]. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause lung damage, leading to ARDS, due not only to

138

alveolar damage but also to diffuse microvascular endothelial damage and clot activation, mainly

139

driven by pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 [30,31]. The protective role of citrate on

140

endothelial integrity was recently reported by Dellepiane and colleagues [32]. Moreover, the

141

consumption of citrate and other carboxylates is promoted by hypoxic conditions in red blood

142

cells [33].

143

Formate shows the inverse pattern of correlation with respect to citrate, and it significantly

144

correlates also with lactate dehydrogenase and FiO2. Regarding lipoprotein-related parameters

145

only LDL cholesterol significantly correlates with the SaO2/FiO2 ratio.

146

In line with these observations, metabolites provide an optimal discrimination (accuracy 90.0%,

147

100.0% sensitivity, 83.3% specificity) between COVID-19 patients treated and non-treated with

148

invasive ventilation (S3 A-B Fig), with formate and citrate as the most important features of the

149

model. Instead, no significant clustering is present in the model calculated with lipoprotein-related

150

parameters (S3 C-D Fig).

151

Despite plasma samples of COVID-19 patients are characterized by higher levels of VLDL and

152

associated triglycerides, we observed a general reduction of HDL and LDL cholesterol-related

153

parameters. Downregulation of lipids in COVID-19 blood sera has already been observed [34,35]

154

and it has been hypothesized that lipids (in particular cholesterol and fatty acids) could play a

155

pivotal role in virus replication and assembly [36,37]. Our data suggest that only LDL and HDL

156

could be implied in this mechanism.

157

Accordingly, in a recent study, LDL and HDL levels were inversely correlated to disease severity

158

and poor prognosis [38]. Furthermore, overproduction of VLDL has been linked with the

159

processes inducing insulin resistance in COVID-19 patients [35].

160

We also detected an accumulation of mannose in the plasma of COVID-19 patients and a

161

significant positive correlation between plasma mannose levels and neutrophils and between

162

mannose and the neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio. An increment of mannose could be related to

163

different reasons: it could be associated to its binding to lectin in order to promote complement

164

activation [34], or it could be linked to insulin resistance. Indeed, plasma mannose levels are

165

elevated in subjects with insulin resistance independently of obesity [39] and there are increasing

166

evidences that a bidirectional relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes exists [40].

167

The increment of pyruvate and 3-hydroxybutyrate, along with the strong decrement of citrate and

168

free amino acids (alanine, glycine, glutamine, histidine) in plasma of COVID-19 patients can be

169

ascribed to an impairment of the energetic metabolism. Indeed, during inflammatory states amino

170

acids can be used to provide energy and materials for the proliferation and phagocytosis of

171

immune cells. It is important to underline that pyruvate is a metabolite particularly sensitive to pre-

172

analytical procedures, thus further investigations to confirm its alteration are needed [41,42].

173

Among the 30 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 18 patients presented ARDS. Thus, the possibility

174

that ARDS could significantly alter the profile of COVID-19 was examined. The RF models

175

calculated both on metabolites and lipoprotein-related parameters can only slightly cluster ARDS

176

patients with respect to the other COVID-19 patients (metabolite model: accuracy 76.7%, 88.9%

177

sensitivity, 58.3% specificity; lipoprotein model: accuracy 75.0%, 81.2% sensitivity, 66.7%

178

specificity). These results demonstrate that the metabolomic profile of COVID-19 patients is

179

mainly dictated by the pathology or by the host response to the virus infection, rather than by the

180

concomitant presence of ARDS.

181

182

Multilevel partial least square discriminant analysis (mPLS-DA) was used to analyze NMR data of

183

pre- and post-tocilizumab samples in a pairwise multivariate fashion. The mPLS-DA model built

184

on metabolites shows significant differential clustering, yielding a discrimination accuracy of

185

80.3% (Fig 3A). The two pairs of samples collected from patients who died (COVID-19-020 and

186

COVID-19-021) present the smallest shift within the metabolomic subspace. Unfortunately,

187

COVD-19-018 patient was transferred to another hospital and no follow-up and outcome

188

information was available. Univariate analysis enables the identification of a panel of eight

189

metabolites (Fig 3B-I, S5 Table) significantly different (before FDR correction) between pre- and

7

190

post-tocilizumab patients. The post-treatment levels of these metabolites partially or completely

191

revert towards the levels of CTR subjects.

192

193

The mPLS-DA model built using lipoprotein-related parameters shows a significant discrimination

194

between samples collected pre- and post-tocilizumab treatment (accuracy of 82.8%) (S4 Fig).

195

Univariate analysis identifies 19 lipoprotein parameters (Table S6) significantly different between

196

pre- and post-tocilizumab treatment. In particular, HDL-1 subfractions of cholesterol,

197

phospholipids, and Apo A2 showed lower levels at post-treatment, whereas LDL-5, HDL-4, IDL,

198

VLDL-1, and VLDL-2 of many subfractions are higher at post-treatment. The general increment of

199

lipoprotein subfractions after treatment confirms the metabolic reversion and supports the key

200

role of lipids in the metabolism of COVID-19 patients.

201

202

In summary, in this study a strong plasma metabolomic and lipidomic signature of Sars-CoV-2

203

infection is identified, and it is only marginally affected by the different disease severities.

204

Additionally, some metabolites correlate with alveolar-capillary membrane injury and their levels

205

are affected by mechanical ventilation. Of note, in the case of patients who underwent tocilizumab

206

treatment, metabolic alterations revert towards those of the control group.

216

During the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 30 patients, hospitalized at the Careggi University

217

Hospital, Florence, Italy, were enrolled in the study. All patients were of Caucasian ethnicity.

218

Demographic and clinical features of the enrolled patients are summarized in Table S1.

219

220

Plasma sample preparation

221

Plasma samples were collected from all the subjects enrolled in the study, according to standard

222

procedures [41,42]. Blood samples were collected in ethylene diamine tetra-acetate (EDTA)-

223

coated blood collection tubes and stored at room temperature. Ficoll®, a neutral highly branched

224

polymer formed by the co-polymerization of sucrose and epichlorohydrin, was used for blood

225

separation. 14 mL of blood were gently placed in 25 mL tubes containing 9 mL of Ficoll®. Tubes

226

were centrifugated 1500 g for 20 minutes. Plasma was collected and rapidly stored in a −20°C

227

freezer pending NMR analysis.

228

229

NMR sample preparation, spectra processing and spectral analysis

230

NMR samples were prepared according to standard procedures [19,20,43]. NMR spectra for all

231

samples were acquired using a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin) operating at

232

600.13 MHz proton Larmor frequency and equipped with a 5 mm PATXI 1H-13C-15N and 2H-

233

decoupling probe including a z-axis gradient coil, an automatic tuning-matching (ATM) and an

234

automatic refrigerated sample changer (SampleJet, Bruker BioSpin). A BTO 2000 thermocouple

235

served for temperature stabilization at the level of approximately 0.1 K of the sample. Before

236

measurement, to equilibrate temperature at 310 K, samples were kept for at least 5 minutes

237

inside the NMR probe head.

238

For each plasma sample, two one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were acquired with water peak

239

suppression and different pulse sequences that allowed the selective detection of different

240

molecular components. The spectra were: 1) a standard NOESY using 32 scans, 98,304 data

241

points, a spectral width of 18,028 Hz, an acquisition time of 2.7 s, a relaxation delay of 4 s and a

242

mixing time of 0.01 s. This kind of spectrum is made up of signals arising from low molecular

243

weight molecules (metabolites) and signals arising from macromolecules such as lipoproteins and

244

lipids; 2) a standard spin echo Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) using 32 scans, 73,728 data

245

points, a spectral width of 12,019 Hz and a relaxation delay of 4 s. This NMR sequence allows

246

the selective detection of signals arising only from low molecular weight metabolites.

247

Before applying Fourier transform, free induction decays were multiplied by an exponential

248

function equivalent to a 0.3 Hz line-broadening factor. Transformed spectra were automatically

249

corrected for phase and baseline distortions and calibrated to the anomeric glucose doubled at δ

250

5.24 ppm, using TopSpin 3.6.2 (Bruker BioSpin) [19,20].

251

252

Statistical analysis

253

All data analyses were performed using the “R” statistical environment. Metabolites, whose peaks

254

in the CPMG spectra were well defined and resolved, were assigned and their concentrations

255

analyzed. The assignment procedure was performed using an 1H NMR spectra library of pure

256

organic compounds (BBIOREFCODE, Bruker BioSpin), public databases, e.g. Human

257

Metabolome Database [11], storing reference 1H NMR spectra of metabolites, and using literature

258

data when available. The spectral regions associated to the 21 assigned metabolites were

259

integrated using a R script in-house developed. Quantification of 114 lipid main fractions and

260

subfractions was performed using the Bruker IVDr platform [21].

261

Both metabolites and lipoprotein-related parameters were analyzed via multivariate analysis.

262

Unsupervised Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used as first exploratory analysis to

263

obtain a preliminary data outlook (i.e. cluster detection and screening for outliers). The Random

264

Forest (RF) algorithm [44] was used for classification in the comparison between COVID-19

265

patients and CTR. RF is a classification algorithm that uses an ensemble of unpruned decision

266

trees (forest), each of which is built on a bootstrap sample of the training data using a randomly

267

selected subset of variables (metabolites or lipoprotein-related parameters)[45,46]. The

268

percentage of trees in the forest that assign one sample to a specific class can be inferred as a

269

probability of belonging to a given class [13]. In our case, each tree was used to predict whether a

270

sample represents a COVID-19 patient or a CTR subject. Because the out-of-bag (OOB)

271

observations were not used in the fitting of the trees, the OOB estimates are cross-validated,

272

accuracy estimates, and represent an unbiased estimation of the generalization error [44].

273

Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of all calculated models were assessed according to the

274

standard definitions. For all calculations, the R package ‘Random Forest’ [44] was used to grow a

275

forest of 1000 trees, using the default settings.

276

Pairwise comparisons between pre- and post-treatment samples were performed using multilevel

Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (mPLS-DA) and results validated using a Monte Carlo

278

Cross-Validation scheme (MCCV, script in house developed): each dataset was randomly divided

279

by 1000 times into a training set (80% of the data) which was used to build the model and a test

280

set (20% of the data) which was used to test the integrity of the model. Accuracy, sensitivity, and

281

specificity of all calculated models were assessed according to the standard definitions.

282

On the biological assumption that metabolite and lipoprotein concentrations are not normally

283

distributed, non-parametric tests were used for the univariate analysis. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney

284

test was used to infer differences between the metabolite/lipid levels in the comparison between

285

COVID-19 patients and CTR. Instead for pairwise comparison between pre- and post-treatment

286

samples the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was utilized [47]. P-values were adjusted for multiple

287

testing using the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure with Benjamini-Hochberg [48] correction at

288

α = 0.05. The effect size (Ef) was also calculated [49] to aid in the identification of the meaningful

289

signals giving an estimation of the magnitude of the separation between the different groups. The

290

magnitude is assessed using the thresholds provided in Romano et al. [50] , i.e. |Ef|<0.147

291

“negligible”,

292

correlations, adjusted for FDR using BH methods, were also calculated.

|Ef|<0.33

“small”,

|Ef|<0.474

“medium”,

otherwise

“large”.
