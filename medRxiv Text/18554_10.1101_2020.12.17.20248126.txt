ABSTRACT.
Patients in the UK at risk of Covid-19 pneumonia, but not needing immediate hospital attention, are to be given pulse oximeters to identify a fall in oxygen saturation (SaO2 or
SpO2) at home. A recent finding in Covid-19 pneumonia is a dominant reduction in ventilation to perfused alveoli (VA/Q). A mathematical model of gas exchange was used to predict the effect of shunt or reduced VA/Q on SaO2 stability inferred from the slope of the
PIO2 vs SaO2 curve as it intersected the line representing ambient PIO2. A ±1 kPa variation in PIO2 predicted a 1.5% and 8% change in SpO2 with 15% shunt and 0.4 VA/Q respectively. As a consistency check, two patients with pre-existing lung disease and 12 hour
continuous SpO2 monitoring breathing air had gas exchange impairment analysed in
terms of shunt and reduced VA/Q. The patient with 16% shunt and normal VA/Q had a stable but reduced SpO2 (circa 93±1%) throughout the 12 hr period. The patient with a VA/Q
reduced to 0.48 had SpO2 ranging from 75-95% during the same period. SpO2 monitoring in suspected covid-19 patients should focus on SpO2 varying >5% in 30 minutes. Such
instability in at risk patients is not diagnostic of Covid -19 pneumonia but this may be suspected from a dominant reduction in VA/Q if episodic hypoxaemia has progressed from a
stable SpO2.

INTRODUCTION.
200,000 patients in England at risk of complications with Covid-19, but not needing immediate hospitalisation, are to be given pulse oximeters to identify deterioration in oxygen
saturation (SpO2) at home,[1]. This is to create “virtual Covid wards” of at risk patients who
take SpO2 readings and relate these to their health teams. Mortality risk increases and
admission to hospital is indicated if SpO2 falls to 94% or less,[1].
A new finding may transform thinking about SpO2 monitoring in incipient Covid -19 Adult
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This is a dissociation between severe hypoxemia
and well-preserved alveolar gas volume in Covid-19 ARDS causing reduced ventilation to
perfused alveoli (VA/Q) with high compliance and radiological sparing. This is virtually never seen in most forms of ARDS where large shunt, extensive lung radio-opacities and low
compliance dominate,[2]. A qualitative relationship has been reported between reduced
VA/Q in patients with pre-existing lung disease and unstable SpO2 measured during 12
hour periods of continuous monitoring,[3,4]. A model of pulmonary gas exchange is used
here to examine the effect of a reduction in VA/Q or increase in shunt on the position and
slope of the PIO2 vs SpO2 curve as it intersects the line representing 21 kPa PIO2, i.e
breathing air at sea level. From this will be inferred the stability of SaO2 with changes in
distribution of ventilation or shunt. Newly available methods have enabled more precise
discrimination of shunt and reduced VA/Q to examine the relationship between these entities and SpO2 stability from previous studies,[5,6]. It is proposed that SpO2 instability is a
sign of reduced VA/Q which may be a diagnostic feature of incipient Covid- 19 ARDS.
BACKGROUND.
VA/Q and shunt can be derived non-invasively using a computer algorithm to relate SpO2
to inspired oxygen pressure (PIO2) in a PIO2 vs SpO2 diagram,[4-7]. An unstable SpO2 is
explained by rightward shift of the PIO2 vs SpO2 relationship when VA/Q and shunt
change and is shown diagrammatically in Fig 1. The shape of the oxygen dissociation
curve (ODC, red line, i.e. PaO2 vs SaO2,) shifted to the right by PaCO2/R (blue arrow),
provides a PIO2 vs SpO2 curve for the normal lung (blue line). Reducing VA/Q shifts this
curve further to the right (green arrow and line) and as it crosses the 21kPa PIO2 line, representing air breathing, its gradient becomes increasingly steep. Small changes in VA/Q (or

PIO2) cause large changes in SpO2. Increasing shunt bends the curve downwards,[4-6]
so that large changes in PIO2 cause small changes in SpO2 emphasising the unreliability
of the PaO2/FIO2 as an index of oxygen exchange,[8]. An algorithm based on a three compartment lung model was recently developed to analyse the slope of the PIO2 vs SpO2
curve in pre term infants with broncho pulmonary dysplasia,[5-7]. This showed that slope
was greatest in those with a homogeneous reduction of VA/Q to circa 0.4. Slope was considerably less with inhomogeneous pulmonary disease with or without increased shunt.
METHODS
The effects of reducing VA/Q or increasing shunt on PIO2 vs SpO2 curves were derived
using a mathematical model of pulmonary gas exchange described by Olszowska andWagner,[9]. Datasets were generated using the equations implemented on a spreadsheet
supplied by Dr AJ Olszowka (Model 1). This calculated exact values of arterial oxygen saturation for given values of inspired oxygen concentration. It represented the lungs as three
compartments: a pure shunt and two ventilated regions, each with a homogeneous alveolar ventilation-perfusion ratio (VA/Q). The values of cardiac output, oxygen consumption,
haemoglobin concentration, shunt fraction, and the distribution of blood flow and alveolar

ventilation to the ventilated compartments can be set. The perfusion of one compartment
whose VA/Q was reduced from 0.85 to 0.3 was set at 90% of non-shunt flow. A shunt was
fixed at 2% and PIO2 was varied between 15 and 30 kPa, the SaO2 being derived in
each case. Then with VA/Q held at 0.85 and shunt increased stepwise from 2-25 % the
PIO2 was changed over the same range of PIO2 and SaO2 derived. The slope of the
PIO2 vs SaO2 curve as it intersected the 21 kPa PIO2 line was calculated. To provide a
consistency check of this analysis two patients with pre-existing lung disease and 12 hour
continuous SpO2 monitoring from a previous study[3] had their PIO2 vs SpO2 plots reanalysed with a newly developed algorithm based on a three compartment lung,[5,6].
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The left panels in Fig 2 show the effect on PIO2 vs SaO2 curves of reducing VA/Q or increasing shunt where the vertical line represents 21 kPa PIO2 breathing air at sea level.
Reducing VA/Q from normal (circa 0.85) shifted the curve gradually to the right so that its

gradient as it intercepted the 21kPa line became rapidly steeper. Furthermore, as VA/Q fell,
the intercept of the curve on the 21kPa line showed SaO2 falling abruptly; red arrows indicate a 7% fall in SaO2 as VA/Q fell from 0.5 to 0.4 and a 24% reduction in SaO2 as VA/Q
fell from 0.4 to 0.3. The panels on the right show the greater effect on gradient of reducing
VA/Q than of increasing shunt. The SpO2 will become unstable once VA/Q has fallen to
0.5; at a VA/Q of 0.4 a ±1 kPa change in PIO2 gives an 8% change in SpO2 with the likelihood of profound hypoxemia with a further small fall in VA/Q. In contrast, with a 15%
shunt, a ±1 kPa change in PIO2 gives <2% change in SpO2.

To illustrate the clinical effect of VA/Q vs Shunt on SpO2 stability are two patients with a
modest impairment of gas exchange, one with increased shunt the other with decreased
VA/Q re-analysed from Fig11 Ref 4. (Fig 3). Left panels show oxygen dissociation (red)
and normal lung PIO2 vs SpO2 curves (blue). Patients A and B had dark green PIO2 vs
SpO2 curves derived by changing PIO2 stepwise and analysing the resulting PIO2 vs
SpO2 data pairs with a new computer algorithm, [5,6]. The curve plateau was displaced
downwards in A by a moderate shunt (14%) but not shifted to the right. When breathing air
the gradient of curve A as it intercepted the 21kPa PIO2 line was 0.5 and similar to the
normal lung. In B the whole curve was shifted to the right by the VA/Q reduced to 0.48.
This patient had a shunt of 12% but the effect on SpO2 was outweighed by reduced VA/Q
increasing curve gradient at the intercept to 2% SpO2 per kPa PIO2 which is similar to the
result of the mathematical model in the right upper panel of Fig 2 .
Compressed spectral arrays (or Waterfall plots) were used to display the continuously
measured SpO2 during the 12 hour monitoring periods breathing air. These showed the
distribution pattern of SpO2 in 30 minute intervals, each moving up the page. Patient A
with an increased shunt showed a stable pattern with superimposed peaks varying 1-2%
around the median, closely resembling the normal lung pattern [4], but with a lower than
normal median SpO2 circa 93-94%. In contrast Patient B with reduced VA/Q had broad
peaks with SpO2 drifting downwards from >95 to 75% during the study. Large falls in
SpO2 are consistent with small reductions in VA/Q below 0.5. Compared to the highly unstable SpO2 with a modest reductions of VA/Q to 0.5, it would be expected from Fig 2 that
a patient with a 25% shunt breathing air would have a stable saturation down to
88%SpO2.
Instability of SpO2 breathing air with SpO2 varying >5% in 30 minutes is a sensitive
marker of a reduction in VA/Q, e.g. to <0.5. The shape of the PIO2 vs SpO2 curve indicates
more specifically the nature and magnitude of the underlying gas exchange abnormality;
only a pencil and paper are required with PIO2 varied in three or more steps using a Ventimask,[10] In practice reduced VA/Q and and increased shunt often co-exist in different
proportions giving complex effects on curve shape. A computer program plots the curve
and generates a numerical estimate of VA/Q and Shunt from SpO2 vs PIO2 data pairs when
PIO2 is changed stepwise,[5,6].

Other groups have reported on SpO2 monitoring of at risk Covid -19 patients in a domestic
“virtual ward” setting. One chose a threshold for admission of 2% less than a 96% target,
[11]. Another did not find such monitoring useful because of variability of implementation,
[12] whereas a third reported on remote monitoring of 26 patients after discharge from
hospital with Covid-19,[13]. In the latter group there were 5 “alerts” and 4 re-admissions
with a median of 91% SpO2 and a lowest reading of 82%. None commented on unstable
SpO2.
CONCLUSION
A modest reduction in VA/Q to between 0.5 and 0.4 causes a right shift of the PIO2 vs
SpO2 curve and a considerable increase in the gradient of this line as it intersects the
21kPa line. Small changes in ventilation and/or a further small reduction in VA/Q causes
large changes in SpO2 circa >4%. While SpO2 instability breathing air is a sign of reduced of VA/Q it is not, per se, diagnostic of Covid -19 pneumonia. SpO2 varying substantially both below and above the 94% target threshold may be confusing to patients and
their health teams. An at risk Covid-19 patient with previously normal SpO2 but develop
ing unstable SpO2 with episodes of profound hypoxaemia out of proportion to radiological
change may well be compatible with the reduced VA/Q of Covid-19 pneumonia.
