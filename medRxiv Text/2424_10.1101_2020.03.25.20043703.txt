Abstract

Coronaviruses disease 2019 (COVID-19), for the first time detected in Wuhan,
China, rapidly speared around the world and be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern
(PHEIC). The aim of the current survey is collecting laboratory findings, analysis them and reporting a
specific pattern for help to COVID-19 diagnosis.
Background and Aim:

: To collect laboratory characteristics, we searched "PubMed" electronic database with the
following keywords: "COVID-19" "2019 novel coronavirus" "laboratory findings" "clinical
characteristics".
Methods

: Once the initial searches 493 studies were yielded. After removing duplicates studies 480
studies were remained. The 12 studies obtained from the literature, of which 58.3% (7) of studies
were case-control (8–14), and 41.7% (5) remaining studies were designed as cross-sectional (1,15–
18)
Results

The result of the current study showed that in the early stage of COVID-19 infection,
maybe there are not significant laboratory findings, but with disease progression, the one or more
than signs include increasing AST, ALT, LDH, CK, CRP, ESR, WBC, neutrophil, and decreasing
Hemoglobin, lymphocyte count, eosinophil count can be seen. Elevating D-dimer and FDP are
associated with ARDS development and can be used as prognostic factors.
Conclusion:

Keywords:

COVID-19; laboratory findings; prognostic factors

Introduction

Coronaviruses disease 2019 (COVID-19), for the first time detected in Wuhan, China, rapidly speared
around the world and be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). COVID-19 by
involving the respiratory system can rapidly develop to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (1).
Genetic studies revealed that COVID-19 has 1 88% similarity with severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (2). Despite to SARS, COVID-19 has longer
incubation time, lack of pathologic symptoms, and transferability in the incubation period made it
more serious pathogenic and rapidly transmission (3). Reverse real-time PCR (rRT-PCR) used for
specific diagnosis of COVID-19, but like the other laboratories tests, has a false-negative result;
specially in the early stage of disease.
Nevertheless, a specific laboratory diagnosis along with other clinical characteristics and their
association with severity of the disease is necessary. Several studies reported different laboratory
findings (4–6). The aim of the current survey is collecting laboratory findings, analysis them and
reporting a specific pattern for help to COVID-19 diagnosis.

Search strategy

To collect laboratory characteristics, we searched "PubMed" electronic database with the following
keywords: "COVID-19" "2019 novel coronavirus" "laboratory findings" "clinical characteristics".
There was no restriction for date and language. The present survey was performed base on PRISMAP guideline Preferred reporting items for the systematic review and meta-analysis protocols
(PRISMA-P) 2015 statement (7).
Study selection

Two reviewers (M.E and F.R) screened all studies first by title and abstract, then reviewed the full
text of the article. The inclusion criteria for selecting studies were as follows; evaluating
hematological, coagulation, biochemistry, and serological laboratory tests. Exclusion criteria were
considered as studies with just molecular reports and studies that report laboratory results with the
percentage.
Data extraction

Two independent reviewers (F.R and M.E) extract the data from included studies. Data were
extracted by the following key characteristics: author, publication year, country, type of study,
sample size, result and final finding.
Statistical Analysis of Data

Cochran Chi-square test and I2 were used to assessing heterogeneity among studies. A fixed-effects
model was used When I2 < 50%, while when I2> 50%, a random-effects model was selected. If there
was statistical heterogeneity among the results, a further sensitivity analysis was conducted to
determine the source of heterogeneity. After the significant clinical heterogeneity was excluded, the
randomized effects model was used for meta-analysis. Publication bias was evaluated using the
Funnel plot and Egger test. P < 0.05 was considered as statistical significance (2-sided). All data were
analyzed using the STAT 15 software.
Result

Once the initial searches 493 studies were yielded. After removing duplicates studies 480 studies
were remained. One reviewer (M.E) screened 480 articles by title and abstract. 449 studies were
excluded based on exclusion criteria. After evaluating the full text of studies by inclusion and
exclusion criteria, 12 articles remained (Figure 1).

Study characteristics and quality assessment

The 12 studies obtained from the literature systematic review are presented in Table 1. Of these,
58.3% (7) of studies were case-control (8–14), and 41.7% (5) remaining studies were designed as
cross-sectional (1,15–18). All researches conducted in China. There is one study that investigated
the association between coagulation abnormalities with prognosis in infected patients with COVID19 (8).
Just one study had a sample size greater than 1000 (16) (Table 1). The demographic and quality
assessment of included studies were shown in Table 1 and Table 2.

The result of laboratory finding analysis showed that, lymphocytopenia, increasing C-reactive

protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (Table 3). Egger's test was done for all
laboratory tests and the result showed that there was no publication bias (Table 3). Among these,
measuring glucose has the lowest important. The most reported clinical findings were fever, cough,
diarrhea, and fatigue; whereas the chest pain and muscle ache were reported just by two studies
(Table 4). Egger test results, revealed there was no publication bias (Table 4). After investigating for
comorbidity situation analysis, it revealed that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, Cerebrovascular disease (CBD),
malignancy and kidney abnormalities (Table 5). The details of reported results were shown in
supplemental 1.

Discussion

Additional to the rapid progression, in late-stage, COVID-19 develop to the ARDS, which is more
severe than ARDS occurred routinely (21). The absence of a specific laboratory panel faced the early
diagnosis of COVID-19 with a big challenge. Hence there is a critical need to a laboratory
interpretation for disease management. In the current survey we evaluated 12 studies, all of them
were conducted in China.
Our result showed that the infection is more prevalent in comorbidities situation. Among this
hypertension, diabetic, CVD were more common (Table 5). The most observed clinical
manifestations were fever, cough, and fatigue (Table 4). Another more common clinical finding was
diarrhea, et al. reported a case without COVID-19 clinical characteristics and laboratory abnormality
but the virus was detected in stool exam; this show that diarrhea without laboratory abnormality
should consider for follow up (22).
COVID-19 entering the alveolar epithelial cells thought angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
(22,23). The main mechanism for inflammation and organ damage is storm cytokines, specially in
pulmonary vascular endothelial cells. Hung et al. findings showed that the increasing inflammatory
cytokines (IL1B, IL-6, IL-12, IL-10, INF-γ, AND MCP-1) and are higher in ICU admitted, which is a more

aggravated disease (20). Increasing inflammation cytokines induction increasing neutrophil count,
infiltration them into lung cells, and promoting ARDS developing (12), so elevating neutrophil count
should be consider for protecting lung injury. The elevating CRP and ESR are the result of these
storm inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, Hung et al. showed that in COVID-19 infected patients,
the inhibitory cytokines, like IL-4 and IL-10 increasing, are the leading causes of erythropoiesis
inhabitation and lymphopenia in infected patients (20). Our results are in line with this and
indicated increasing CRP and ESR, and lymphocytopenia have to consider for COVID-19 infection
(Table 3). It is worth to note the Zahng et al. found there is a correlation between eosinopenia and
lymphocytopenia, this can be a useful diagnostic marker for COVID-19 diagnosis (9).
Abnormality in liver laboratory tests (e.g., AST, ALT, LDH, bilirubin) was observed in % studies
(Table). COVID-19 has receptors on the surface of bile, and these abnormalities can as a result of bile
injury (15,23,24). This can be an explanation for normal liver laboratory findings in the early stage of
infection. Hypoxia is a serious event in COVID-19, which is one of the main causes of sudden death in
patients, hence the increasing CK may be as a result of hypoxia and must be causally interpretation
(9).
In a study conducted by Tang et al., it was demonstrated with disease progression, coagulation
parameters were increasing; this is in regard with Zhang and Wang et al. findings; that increasing Ddimer and FDP more seen in ICU and severe patients (8–10). Inflammatory cytokines cause
activation of monocyte, endothelial cells, expression tissue factor, secretion von Willebrand and
finally developing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (8). It was shown in SARS infection,
dysregulation of urokinase pathway, causes activating fibrinolysis and increasing FDPs, and are
associated with poor prognosis (8,25).

Conclusion

In conclusion, the result of the current study showed that in the early stage of COVID-19 infection,
maybe there are not significant laboratory findings, but with disease progression, the one or more
than signs include increasing AST, ALT, LDH, CK, CRP, ESR, WBC, neutrophil, and decreasing
Hemoglobin, lymphocyte count, eosinophil count can be seen. Elevating D-dimer and FDP are
associated with ARDS development and can be used as prognostic factors.
