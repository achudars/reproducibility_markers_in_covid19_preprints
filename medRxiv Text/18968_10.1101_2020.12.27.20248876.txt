Abstract
Introduction
Several antigen tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have
been developed worldwide, but their clinical utility has not been well established. In this study,
we evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of QuickNavi™-COVID19 Ag, a newly
developed antigen test in Japan.
Methods
This prospective observational study was conducted at a PCR center between October 7 and
December 5, 2020. The included patients were referred from a local public health center and 89
primary care facilities. We simultaneously obtained two nasopharyngeal samples with flocked
swabs; one was used for the antigen test and the other for real-time reverse transcription PCR
(RT-PCR). Using the results of real-time RT-PCR as a reference, the performance of the antigen
test was evaluated.
Results
A total of 1186 patients were included in this study, and the real-time RT-PCR detected
SARS-CoV-2 in 105 (8.9%). Of these 105 patients, 33 (31.4%) were asymptomatic. The antigen
test provided a 98.8% (95% confident interval [CI]: 98.0%-99.4%) concordance rate with
real-time RT-PCR, along with a sensitivity of 86.7% (95% CI: 78.6%-92.5%) and a specificity
of 100% (95% CI: 99.7%-100%). False-negatives were observed in 14 patients, 8 of whom were
asymptomatic and had a low viral load (cycle threshold (Ct) >30). In symptomatic patients, the
sensitivity was 91.7% (95% CI: 82.7%-96.9%).
Conclusion
QuickNavi™-COVID19 Ag showed high specificity and sufficient sensitivity for the detection
of SARS-CoV-2. This test is a promising potential diagnostic modality especially in
symptomatic patients.

Introduction
The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has laid a detrimental burden on the
healthcare system [1]. The effective isolation and early treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients
require rapid and accurate diagnostic methods [2].
Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for upper respiratory samples have been the
mainstay for the identification of infected individuals [3]. However, while these assays are
considered the gold-standard examinations, the disadvantages of their finite availability, long
turnaround time, and need for skilled technicians have limited their clinical utility [4]. The
number of patients eligible to undergo these tests may overwhelm the test capacity in outbreak
settings [3]. Antigen tests are cheaper, more accessible point-of-care tests and take a shorter time
to produce results; they can therefore be more useful in limited-resource settings, provided they
reliably detect SARS-CoV-2.
The reported sensitivity of antigen tests has ranged from 0%-94%, whereas the
specificity is consistently high at >97% [3]. QuickNavi™-COVID19 Ag (Denka Co., Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan) is a newly developed antigen test in Japan and employs a sandwich
immunochromatography method with mouse monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The
test result is available within 15 minutes after samples diluted in the buffer have been placed in a
well of the test kit. Nevertheless, no study has yet examined its utility.
In the present study, we evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of
QuickNavi™-COVID19 Ag using prospectively collected clinical samples. Furthermore, we
analyzed the factors that might influence the sensitivity and specificity.

Patients and methods
We prospectively performed the study between October 7 and December 5, 2020, at a PCR
center in Tsukuba, located in the southern part of Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. During the
COVID-19 endemic period, sample-collecting for PCR in the Tsukuba district was intensively
performed with a drive-through-type method at the PCR center in Tsukuba Medical Center
Hospital (TMCH). During the study period, additional samples for antigen test were collected
from patients who have been referred from a local public health center and 89 primary care
facilities (Supplementary Table 1) and healthcare workers of TMCH, and their clinical
information was obtained after receiving the subjects’ informed consent. If patients had no
clinical data, we excluded them from this study. In cases where patients participated in the
current study more than once, only the first evaluation was included in this study.
The ethics committee of TMCH approved the present study (approval number: 2020-033).

Sample collection and procedures for antigen test
For sample collections, we simultaneously obtained two nasopharyngeal samples for
antigen test and PCR examination with FLOQSwab™ (Copan Italia S.p.A., Brescia, Italy) as
previously described [5]. Antigen test was performed immediately after sample collection
according to the manufacturers' instructions, described in Supplementary Figure 1, and the
results were obtained by the visual interpretation of each examiner. Another swab sample was
diluted in 3 mL of Universal Transport Medium™ (UTM™) (Copan Italia S.p.A., Brescia, Italy),
and the UTM™ was transferred to an in-house microbiology laboratory located next to the
drive-through sample-collecting place of the PCR center within an hour of sample collection.

PCR examinations for SARS-CoV-2 in this study
After the arrival of the UTM™ samples, purification and RNA extraction were
performed with magLEAD 6gC (Precision System Science Co., Ltd., Chiba, Japan) from 200

µL aliquots of UTM™ for in-house reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) on the same day as
sample collection. The RNA was eluted in 100 µL and stored at -80 °C after in-house RT-PCR.
The eluted samples were transferred to Denka Co., Ltd., every week for reference real-time
RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 using a method developed by the National Institute of Infectious
Diseases, Japan [6]. If discordance was recognized between the reference real-time RT-PCR and
in-house RT-PCR, a re-evaluation was performed with a BioFire® Respiratory Panel 2.1 and
FilmArray® systems (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC, UT, USA), and the final judgment was made.

Limit of detection of QuickNavi™-COVID19 Ag
The limit of detection of QuickNavi™-COVID19 Ag was investigated as follows: the
2019-nCoV/JPN/TY/WK-521 strain (4.2×105 TCID50/mL) cultured in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells
were diluted two-fold stepwise with QuickNavi™ specimen buffer and used as samples. Each
sample with different concentrations was tested in triplicate. As shown in Table 1, the limit of
detection was 5.3×101 TCID50/mL and was consistent throughout the test.

Statistical analyses
The sensitivity and specificity of antigen test were calculated using the Clopper and
Pearson method, with 95% confident intervals (CIs). Categorical variables were compared by
Fisher’s exact test. P-values <0.05 were considered to represent statistically significant
differences. All calculations were conducted using the R 3.3.1 software program (The R
Foundation, Vienna, Austria).

Results
Of the 2079 referred patients and 45 healthcare workers, a total of 1208 individuals who
had nasopharyngeal samples collected for antigen test and had provided their informed consent
were initially included. We excluded the patients who were duplicates (n=18) or missing
symptom data (n=4). We finally included 1186 subjects for the analysis.
Most samples were obtained at the drive-through PCR center, and only 15 were obtained
after hospitalization. Of the 1186 subjects, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 105 (8.9%) by
reference real-time RT-PCR. There was one discordant sample that showed positivity on
in-house RT-PCR and negativity on reference real-time RT-PCR. The sample was deemed
negative by an additional BioFire® Respiratory Panel 2.1 examination. Of the 105 subjects, 72
(68.6%) were symptomatic, and 33 (31.4%) were asymptomatic (Table 2a).
The characteristics of the symptomatic subjects and cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 are
described in Table 2b. Of the symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive cases (n=72), the most
common symptom was fever (72.2%), followed by cough or sputum production (41.7%), sore
throat (23.6%), fatigue (18.1%) and headache (18.1%).

Sensitivity and specificity of antigen test
Of the 105 cases that were positive on reference real-time RT-PCR, antigen test was also
positive in 91 (Table 3a). The concordance rate between antigen test and real-time RT-PCR was
thus 98.8% (95% CI: 98.0%-99.4%). The sensitivity and specificity rates were 86.7% (95% CI:
78.6%-92.5%) and 100% (95% CI: 99.7%-100%), respectively (Table 3a).
Of the 72 symptomatic cases that were positive on reference real-time RT-PCR, antigen
test was also positive in 66 (Table 3b). The sensitivity and specificity were 91.7% (95% CI:
82.7%-96.9%) and 100% (95% CI: 99.5%-100%), respectively (Table 3b).

Detailed data of discrepant cases between antigen test and real-time RT-PCR examinations
Among the 14 discrepant cases, 8 were asymptomatic, and 4 of the 6 symptomatic cases
had their nasopharyngeal samples taken ≥6 days after the onset of symptoms. The N2-gene was
detected in all cases, but the N1-gene was not detected in 7 cases. One patient had a history of
preceding favipiravir administration (Table 4).

Change of sensitivities of antigen test stratified by cycle threshold (Ct) value
The sensitivity of Ct value (N2) <20 was 100% (95% CI: 91.0%-100%), that of Ct 20-24
was 96.7% (95% CI: 82.8%-99.9%), and that of Ct 25-29 was 100% (95% CI: 83.2%-100%)
(Table 5). In contrast, the sensitivity of Ct ≥30 was 18.8% (95% CI: 4.0%-45.6%) (Table 5).

Discussion
Among 1186 subjects referred from clinics and a local healthcare center in the southern
part of Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan, this prospective study indicated that QuickNavi™-COVID19
Ag has satisfactory performance for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Of note, the test provided no
false-positive results in our study population. False-negatives were detected in 14 subjects, over
half of whom were asymptomatic.
False-positives should be avoided due to concerns about unnecessary further
examinations or application of quarantine measures [7]. NAATs are highly specific for
SARS-CoV-2, and positive results are usually definitive for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [3].
False-positives are rare and they tend to only be observed under exceptional conditions such as
cross contaminations, erroneous handling of samples, or a breakdown in test reagents or
equipment [8]. Similar to NAATs, antigen tests generally have high specificities of >99% [9].
Nevertheless, some false-positive results have been reported in other antigen tests [10,11]. While
definitive proof is lacking, possible causes for the false-positives include the high viscosity of
specimens and interference of human antibodies [12]. The QuickNavi™-COVID19 Ag provided

100% specificity in our study, which exceeded the performance recommended by the World
Health Organization (WHO) [3]. Still, whether or not a similar result can be obtained in
different settings needs to be confirmed.
The sensitivity of QuickNavi™-COVID19 Ag was 86.7% overall, and the positive
detection rate was comparable to the real-time RT-PCR in patients with Ct <30. Eight of 14
false-negative subjects had no symptoms and a low viral load, although conflicting evidence
exists regarding the relationship between symptom severity and viral shedding [13,14]. All
samples were collected from a nasopharynx with flocked swabs, which may have increased the
viral load and improved antigen test sensitivity in our study. The viral load on the nasopharynx
is generally higher than in the nasal cavity or saliva [15,16], and flocked swabs can yield more
samples than rayon swabs [17].
The utility of antigen tests for screening purposes is controversial. The WHO guidelines
basically recommend against antigen tests for screening purposes [3]. In contrast, European
countries allow antigen tests for screening or serial testing [18]. Recent studies may support this
use of antigen tests, showing the frequency and turnaround time of the tests to be great
contributors to an effective screening strategy [19]. Since the QuickNavi™-COVID19 Ag may
effectively identify highly infectious patients (generally Ct <25 [20]) without any false-positives,
the test may be beneficial for screening purposes.
Several limitations associated with the present study warrant mention. First, reference
real-time RT-PCR examinations employed frozen samples. Despite all samples being frozen at
-80 °C, their viral load may have been reduced through the storage process. Second, although
we investigated whether or not the intervals between the symptom onset and examination timing
influenced the performance of the antigen test, the sample size was not sufficient to draw a
definitive conclusion (Supplementary Figure 2). Third, using anterior nasal samples was beyond
the scope of this study. Sample collection from the anterior nasal cavity is less invasive than that
from the nasopharynx and is now approved for QuickNavi™-COVID19 Ag [21]. The clinical

performance of the test with these samples has not yet been evaluated, and further research is
necessary.
In conclusion, the QuickNavi™-COVID19 Ag showed very high specificity and
sufficient sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Given the simple procedures and shorter
turnaround time involved with this test, it is a promising option as an alternative diagnostic
modality especially in symptomatic patients.
