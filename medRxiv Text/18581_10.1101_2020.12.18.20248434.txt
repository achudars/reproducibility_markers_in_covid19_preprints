ABSTRACT
Background: Latino people in the US are experiencing higher excess deaths during the COVID-19
pandemic than any other racial/ethnic group, but it is unclear which subgroups within this diverse
population are most aﬀected. Such information is necessary to target policies that prevent further
excess mortality and reduce inequities.
Methods: Using death certiﬁcate data for January 1, 2016 through February 29, 2020 and time-series
models, we estimated the expected weekly deaths among Latino people in California from March 1
through October 3, 2020. We quantiﬁed excess mortality as observed minus expected deaths and risk
ratios (RR) as the ratio of observed to expected deaths. We considered subgroups deﬁned by age, sex,
place of birth, education, occupation, and combinations of these factors.
Findings: During the ﬁrst seven months of the pandemic, Latino deaths in California exceeded
expected deaths by 10,316, a 31% increase. Excess death rates were greatest for individuals born in
Mexico (RR 1.44; 95% PI, 1.41, 1.48) or Central America (RR 1.49; 95% PI, 1.37, 1.64), with less than
a high school degree (RR 1.41; 95% PI, 1.35, 1.46), or in food-and-agriculture (RR 1.60; 95% PI, 1.48,
1.74) or manufacturing occupations (RR 1.59; 95% PI, 1.50, 1.69). Immigrant disadvantages in excess
death were magniﬁed among working-age Latinos in essential occupations.
Interpretation: The pandemic has disproportionately impacted mortality among Latino immigrants
and Latinos in unprotected essential jobs; Interventions to reduce these disparities should include early
vaccination, workplace safety enforcement, and expanded access to medical care.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
Evidence before this study
Several articles have suggested all-cause excess mortality estimates are superior to official
COVID-19 counts for assessing the impact of the pandemic on marginalized populations that lack
access to testing and healthcare. We searched PubMed, Google scholar, and the medRxiv preprint
database through December 22, 2020 for studies of (“excess mortality” or “excess death”) AND
(“COVID-19” or “coronavirus”) set in the United States and we identified two empirical studies
with estimates of excess mortality among Latinos during the pandemic. The study set in California
(from our research team) found per capita excess mortality was highest among Black and Latino
people. The national study found percent excess mortality was significantly higher among Latino
people than any other racial/ethnic group. Neither study further disaggregated the diverse Latino
population or provided subgroup estimates to clarify why excess pandemic mortality is so high in
this population. In the U.S., official COVID-19 statistics are rarely disaggregated by place of birth,
education, or occupation which has resulted in a lack of evidence of how these factors have
impacted mortality during the pandemic. No study to date of excess mortality in the U.S. has
provided estimates for immigrant or occupational subgroups.
Added value of this study
Our population-based observational study of all-cause mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic
provides the first estimates of within-group heterogeneity among the Latino population in
California – one of the populations hardest hit by COVID-19 in the U.S. We provide the first
subgroup estimates by place of birth and occupational sector, in addition to combined estimates
by foreign-birth and participation in an essential job and education. In doing so, we reveal that
Latino immigrants in essential occupations have the highest risk of excess death during the
pandemic among working-age Latinos. We highlight the heightened risk of excess mortality
associated with food/agriculture and manufacturing occupational sectors, essential sectors in
which workers may lack COVID-19 protections.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our study revealed stark disparities in excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic among
Latinos, pointing to the particularly high vulnerability of Latino immigrants and Latinos in
essential jobs. These findings may offer insight into the disproportionate COVID-19 mortality
experienced by immigrants or similarly marginalized groups in other contexts. Interventions to
reduce these disparities should include policies enforcing occupational safety, especially for
immigrant workers, early vaccination, and expanded access to medical care.

INTRODUCTION
Throughout the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Latino people in the US have been
dying at disproportionately high rates. National all-cause mortality increased 53.6% for Latinos from
the start of the pandemic through October – more than any other group and over four times more
than the percent increase for non-Latino Whites1. However, aggregate national and state-level statistics
obscure the vast diversity among Latinos in the US, making it diﬀicult to intervene eﬀectively to
prevent further pandemic mortality2. Identifying subgroups at greatest risk for excess death could help
guide targeted interventions including workplace protections, testing, and vaccination.

The state of California is a critical setting to evaluate the drivers of Latino mortality during the
COVID-19 pandemic. California is home to approximately one quarter of the U.S.’s Latino population
and its immigrant population. Latinos are 39% of California’s population of 39.5 million residents, but
they account for 48% of COVID-19-conﬁrmed deaths through December 20203. Even this
remarkable death toll likely understates the impact of the pandemic on Latinos because COVID-19conﬁrmed deaths are understood to be a subset of the total deaths due to COVID-194.

The current study estimates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on deaths among Latino
individuals in California by estimating excess deaths that occurred between March 1, 2020 and
October 3, 2020 compared to the four years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. By examining death
record data, this study overcomes the limitations of oﬀicial COVID-19 death counts5. In addition,
with the overarching goal of assisting public health eﬀorts globally, we evaluate heterogeneous risk
within the Latino population by examining excess death during the pandemic by age, sex, place of
birth, education, and occupation.

METHODS
Data
In order to forecast expected mortality trends during our time-period of interest, we drew on death
certiﬁcate data from the California Department of Public Health for the period from January 3, 2016
to February 29, 2020 (pre-pandemic period) and from March 1, 2020 to October 3, 2020 (pandemic
period). Our analyses included all deaths that occurred within the state of California for which
Hispanic/Latino ethnicity was designated. (Only 0.29% of deaths during the pandemic period and
0.25% of deaths during the pre-pandemic period lacked information on ethnicity). Our analytic sample
consisted of 43,576 total deaths among Latinos in California during the pandemic period and 220,986
during the pre-pandemic period. There was little missingness for the variables of interest and
exclusions due to missingness were done on an available-case basis. Due to delays in complete cause
of death data, we did not distinguish speciﬁc causes of death for this analysis.

We deﬁned Latinos as any individual identiﬁed with Latino/a or Hispanic ethnicity on the death
certiﬁcate, irrespective of race or country of birth. We do not use the more inclusive, gender-neutral
terms Latinx or Latine in this paper because they were not used in death records.

We evaluated subgroups deﬁned by: age at death in years (0-24, 25-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, or 85+);
sex (male or female); place of birth (4-categories: U.S., Mexico, Central America, or other; 2-categories:
U.S., or foreign-born); occupational sector (see below); educational attainment (4-categories: no high
school degree, high school degree or GED, some college or Associate’s degree, Bachelor’s degree or
beyond; 2-categories: no high school degree, or high school or more).

We deﬁned excess deaths as observed minus expected deaths due to all causes, with expected deaths
based on historical trends over the previous four years using time series methods described below.
For analyses stratiﬁed by educational attainment, following standard practice, we restricted our analysis
to decedents at least 25 years of age so most people would have completed schooling. For analyses
stratiﬁed by occupational sector, we grouped individuals by the primary occupation over their life, a
ﬁeld included in the death certiﬁcate, and restricted analyses to decedents 18 to 65 years of age. We
drew on the California Department of Public Health designations for essential work6 to sort the
occupation into one of seven sectors of high-risk or essential work, a category for non-essential, or a
category for unemployed or missing data on occupation. Using this designation, we also compared
individuals in essential occupational sectors to individuals in non-essential occupational sectors.

Statistical Analyses
For each subgroup of interest, we repeated the following procedure using the forecast package in R7.
First, we aggregated the data to weekly death counts. Next, to estimate expected deaths, we ﬁt dynamic
harmonic regression models with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)8 errors for the
number of weekly deaths, using deaths occurring pre-pandemic. We iterated through models with up
to 25 Fourier terms and selected the model that minimized the corrected Akaike information criterion,
following an approach developed by Hyndman and Khandakar7. We inspected the residuals from the
preferred model using plots and the Ljung-Box test to conﬁrm that minimal autocorrelation remained.
Then, using the preferred model, we forecast the number of weekly deaths and the corresponding
95% prediction intervals (PI) for the pandemic period: March 1, 2020 through October 3, 2020. These
forecasts provided the expected weekly deaths during the pandemic period based on historical trends.
To estimate the weekly excess deaths, we subtracted the number of expected deaths from the observed
deaths for each week. We constructed a 95% PI for excess deaths by simulating the expected deaths

model 10,000 times (varying based on uncertainty in the estimated coeﬀicients for the time-series
prediction model), selecting the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles, and subtracting the total number of observed
deaths. Risk ratios were estimated as observed deaths divided by expected deaths, with the pandemic
as the exposure, and are also known as observed-to-expected mortality ratios. Risk ratios present the
same information as percent excess deaths, as reported in previous studies1,9,9. We also calculated per
capita excess mortality by dividing excess deaths by the corresponding population size, using estimates
from the 2019 American Community Survey. We conducted all analyses in R version 3.6.3.

RESULTS
Between March 1 and October 3, 2020, Latino people in California experienced a 31% increase in
mortality compared with historical trends, with an estimated 10,316 (95% PI, 9,570, 11,030) excess
deaths (Table 1). COVID-19 was listed as a cause of death on 7672 death certiﬁcates (74% of the
estimated excess deaths). The number of excess deaths varied by week such that excess mortality was
lowest during California’s shelter-in-place period (March 19, 2020-May 7, 2020), then increased to a
peak at the end of July with over 600 excess deaths per week, and began to decline by mid-August
(Figure 3), but the time trends varied by subpopulation (Figure 4). The observed excess death rate for
Latinos aged 25 or older implies 1185 additional deaths per million individuals. Excess deaths in
Latinos were observed in all regions in California (Figure S1).

As shown in Table 1, relative increases in mortality ranged from 26-42% for all adults 25 and older
and was of similar magnitude across adult age groups. The magnitude of excess mortality varied by
country of birth and education. Foreign-born Latinos had higher relative excess mortality than U.S.born Latinos: deaths were 44 percent higher than expected among individuals born in Mexico (RR
95% PI, 1.41, 1.48) and 49 percent higher than expected among individuals born in Central America

(RR 95% PI, 1.37, 1.64). By contrast, deaths among U.S.-born Latinos were 19 percent (RR 95% PI,
1.16, 1.23) higher than expected values. In every adult age stratum, foreign-born Latinos experienced
at least double the relative excess mortality experienced by U.S.-born Latinos (Figure 1). Educational
attainment was inversely associated with the magnitude of excess death during the pandemic period.
Relative excess mortality was highest among Latinos with less than a high school degree (RR 1.41;
95% PI, 1.35, 1.46) and lowest among Latinos with a Bachelor’s degree or more (RR 1.22; 95% PI,
1.11, 1.34).

Among working-age adults (age 18 to 65 years), cumulative excess mortality RRs were highest in those
working in food-and-agriculture (RR 1.60; 95% PI, 1.48, 1.74) and manufacturing (RR 1.59; 95% PI,
1.50, 1.69) (Table 1). During the summer surge, weekly excess mortality among workers in
manufacturing was over 200 percent of expected values (Figure 4).

Disadvantages in excess mortality associated with foreign-birth and low education were more
pronounced among Latinos in essential occupations and in the 55 to 74 age group. Among Latinos
who worked in essential sectors, the percent excess in mortality for immigrants (RR 1.57; 95% PI,
1.47, 1.68) was more than double the percent excess for U.S.-born Latinos (RR 1.21; 95% PI, 1.15,
1.27) (Figure 1). This 36-percentage-point immigrant disadvantage was reduced to 17-percentagepoints among Latinos in non-essential occupations. Among Latinos in essential occupational sectors
who lacked a high school credential, mortality was 52% (95% PI, 44%, 60%) higher than expected,
whereas for Latinos in the same occupational sectors with a high school credential or more, mortality
was 33% (95% PI, 24%, 43%) higher than expected. Finally, pandemic mortality was 58 percent (95%
PI, 49%, 68%) above expected in the subgroup of working-age Latinos with the combined factors of
being foreign-born, without a high school degree, and in an essential occupation, but signiﬁcantly

lower in the subgroup of Latinos who were foreign-born and without a high school degree, yet not in
an essential occupation (RR 1.36; 95% PI, 1.28, 1.48) (Figure 2).

DISCUSSION
Using data on all deaths among Latinos in California, USA from January 1, 2016 through October 3,
2020, we found 10,316 additional deaths occurred among California Latinos in the ﬁrst 7 months of
the pandemic compared with trends in the four years prior. In relative terms, this was an excess of 31
percent. Our ﬁndings reveal disparities in excess mortality by Latino subgroups. Immigrant Latinos,
those with less than a high school degree, and those working in essential occupations, in particular
food/agriculture and manufacturing, were at markedly higher risk of death, especially in the presence
of more than one of these risk factors. Participation in an essential occupational sector appeared to
magnify existing social vulnerabilities.

We have previously shown that over the ﬁrst 5 months of the pandemic, Latinos in California
experienced higher excess mortality than other racial/ethnic groups, with a per capita excess nearly
double that of non-Latino White people in California10. Our current results show that the pandemic’s
impacts on mortality have been far worse for Central American-born and Mexican-born Latinos than
U.S.-born Latinos; a disparity apparent within every age stratum, but worse among 55 to 74 year-olds.
Latino immigrants comprise 37% of California’s Latino population, but an estimated 71 percent of
Latino excess deaths during the pandemic period occurred among immigrants.

The diﬀerential impact on foreign-born Latinos is notable given previously documented immigrant
health advantages11, and may have relevance to other countries. The literature suggests recent Latino
immigrants to the U.S. are less likely than their U.S.-born counterparts to have an underlying medical

condition that would increase COVID-19 severity12. However, foreign-born Latinos may be more
vulnerable to COVID-19 because of their concentration in high-exposure occupations with limited
workplace protections13, barriers to health care and other social protections due to legal status and
public charge inadmissibility14, and chilling eﬀects on healthcare-seeking behavior due to antiimmigrant rhetoric and policy15.

The elevated mortality and stark disparities observed in essential occupational sectors underscores the
potential role of workplace settings and worker marginalization as contributors to excess deaths
among Latino individuals16,17, and as shown in Figure 2, particularly among immigrants. The risk ratios
for excess death among those in health and emergency jobs or government and community jobs –
where workplace safety measures are more consistently adopted18 -- were substantially lower than the
risk ratios among those in sectors characterized by low-wage jobs such as manufacturing and
agriculture. Notably, the foreign-born disadvantage and the low-education disadvantage in pandemic
mortality were both magniﬁed among Latinos in essential occupational sectors (Figure 1). Subgroup
analyses revealed that essential work dramatically increased the risk of death among foreign-born
Latinos, but not among U.S.-born Latinos (Figure 2), perhaps highlighting diﬀerences in the
protections available to workers.

Multiple structural inequalities may put foreign-born and low-educated Latinos employed in essential
jobs and their family members at greater risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and death from COVID19. For instance, foreign-born Latinos earn 87% as much as their U.S.-born counterparts13. Extreme
ﬁnancial precarity coupled with low levels of unionization make it diﬀicult to negotiate workplace
protections and beneﬁts19, leading foreign-born and low-educated Latinos to participate in work
settings where they are not protected from exposure. Also, approximately 44% of Mexican immigrants

in the U.S.20 and 69% of Guatemalan immigrants in the U.S. are undocumented21. The threat of
detention or deportation combined with exclusion from Medicaid and Medicare result in delayed and
inadequate medical care for many undocumented Latinos19,22. Among Latinos in California, half of
undocumented adults and over 20 percent of legal permanent resident adults lacked health insurance
prior to the pandemic23. In addition to these structural factors, many Latinos for whom Spanish or an
indigenous language is their preferred language may lack access to actionable health information about
COVID-19 prevention and treatment24. Larger households and denser living arrangements likely
amplify occupational exposures and contribute to the elevated case and death rates among Latinos16.
Within these intersecting factors are many opportunities for intervention.

The two main strategies for pandemic control endorsed during the study period were individual
behavior change (e.g., masking, distancing) and economic shutdowns to slow transmission. Our results
suggest that neither pandemic control strategy has suﬀiciently protected Latinos from excess mortality.
In fact, as our previous study demonstrated and our current study reinforces, California began
reopening in May when excess deaths among Latinos had yet to decline and, as we show here, when
excess death were rising for vulnerable subgroups. Distinct policies and investment are needed to
protect immigrant Latinos and reduce disparities in COVID-19-related death25–27.

Our ﬁndings draw attention to four domains of promising policy response to reduce excess pandemic
mortality among marginalized groups: workplace conditions, ﬁnancial supports, healthcare coverage,
and vaccine distribution. First, expanded action is needed, particularly in the manufacturing and food
& agriculture sectors, to regulate and enforce workplace modiﬁcations to protect employees from
SARS-CoV-2 exposure, provide workers with accurate information, and protect jobs if workers take
sick leave or negotiate for safer conditions28. Second, most federal government programs in the U.S.

to provide ﬁnancial relief from the economic consequences of the pandemic have excluded
undocumented individuals and the many Latinos in mixed status families. Including immigrant
families in ﬁnancial relief could enable more workers to refuse to work in unsafe settings, which might
interrupt transmission and reduce mortality. Third, an immediate step that could improve access to
medical care is extending emergency Medicaid coverage to all individuals with COVID-19 regardless
of immigration status29. Finally, pandemic disparities are likely to widen in the U.S. and similar contexts
unless action is taken to prioritize marginalized populations, including unauthorized immigrants and
those without health insurance, for access to COVID-19 vaccination.

This study is limited by the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the data on death certiﬁcates. The
interpretation of excess deaths that did not list COVID-19 as a contributing cause is unclear; these
deaths may be undiagnosed COVID-19 cases or they may reﬂect increased mortality due to other
causes exacerbated by the pandemic. The proportion of COVID-conﬁrmed deaths compared with
overall excess mortality that we observed (approximately 74%) is similar or slightly higher than in
national studies. Our analysis is also limited by the occupation ﬁeld on death certiﬁcates which
indicates primary occupation for most of the decedent’s lifetime rather than most recent occupation.
We did not have data to directly examine a number of plausible contributors to excess mortality among
Latinos, for example household size or legal status. Nor did we have access to data on indigenous
ethnicity, another potentially important subgroup with high vulnerability30. Finally, our results rest on
the time-series model premise, that we can predict mortality rates in 2020 based on trends observed
in the prior four years, accounting for factors such as seasonality and autocorrelation.

In summary, our study used data from individual death records to reveal that immigrant Latinos,
Latinos with low education, and Latinos in essential jobs have experienced particularly high excess

immigrant workers, and policies extending high-quality healthcare to all people, including immigrants,
may have the highest beneﬁt for reducing COVID-19 mortality.
