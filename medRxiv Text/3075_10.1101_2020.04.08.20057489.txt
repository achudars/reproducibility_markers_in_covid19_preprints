We show the dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak in Italy and USA, in comparison with China, and
the early response of the countries. Our mathematical techniques makes it possible to calculate
the rate of growth of the cases efficiently, and provides a good understanding of future trends in
Italy and USA. The evolution of the real time data makes it possible to analyse the suitability of
steps taken to eradicate the pandemic by the countries. We compare the day to day development
of the coronavirus cases in Italy and USA, that keeping in view the population pyramid and the
population density, leads us to understand possible difference in the number of effected population.

a. Introduction On December 27, 2019, a hospital
in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, reported the first
mysterious, suspected pneumonia cases to the center of
disease control (CDC) in the capital. On January 8, 2020
a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of pneumonia that spread all over China in next three weeks. Since
then, the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, spread across
the globe in the next month. In March the World Health
Organization declared it to be a pandemic, that in the
absence of a vaccine became a challenge for mankind with
a tendency to grow exponentially if no measure is taken
to prevent it [? ]. The incubation period of COVID-19
can last for two weeks or longer [2]. During the period
of latent infection, the disease may still be infectious [3].
The virus can spread from person to person through respiratory droplets and close contact [4].
Employing social distancing, following patient history
case by case, and locking down the province of Hubei, and
de-facto quarantining the other provinces by restricting
the movement of people China controlled the COVID19 spread in thirty five days successfully with minimum
number of deaths. On the other hand similar out break
in Iran and Italy remained uncontrolled after forty five
and sixty days, respectively, with forty five thousands in
Iran and one hundred and five thousands people in Italy
tested positive as on March 31. In this paper based on
mathematical modelling and reported previous evolution
in China, we predict the future dynamics of the COVID19 outbreak in the second quarter of 2020 in Italy and
USA. The lack of testing facilities and sanctions are restricting the authenticity of data from Iran, for the reason
we are not including it in the present publication. For
our study related to China we have considered the first
twenty one days data that is from January 16, till February 05, whereas we have excluded the epicentre province
of Hubei, which had a significant issue of under reporting
at the early stage and also data inconsistency due to a
change of classification guidelines. For Italy and USA we
have considered the data from February 01, till April 06.
Various mathematical model to analyse the growth of
an epidemic are employed, that include SEIR model [5],
generalized SEIR model [6] and neural network based
quarantine control model [7]. Moreover mathematical analysis of pandemics based on exponential growth

model [8–11] and generalized growth model [12–22] have
been reported. In this contribution, we have developed
discrete generalized growth model (DG2 M), the discrete
generalized logistic model (DGLM), and discrete generalized Richard model (DGRM). These models have their
limitations and are only applicable to some stages, however they provide more accurate measure of the growth in
the outbreak. Based on our numerical results we find excellent agreement between the analytical results and the
real-time data of coronavirus positively tested cases. The
top-down methods have the advantage to study future
scenario of the outbreak, provide lower and upper bounds
of our predictions, the rate of growth in stages and provide informative implications of the measures taken to
control and eradicate the pandemic.
The manuscript has the following layout: in section II
we present the mathematical model for our study, in section III we explain the real-time data of positively tested
COVID-19 patients with the numerical results based on
our models. In section IV we present our estimates and
recommendations based on the work.
b. Mathematical Model The generalized Richard
Model [23], that is

K
is used in explaining previous epidemics. It is the extension of the original Richards growth model [24] which
explain the pandemics [25–29]. Here, r is the growth rate
at the early stage, and K is the final epidemic size. Moreover p is a parameter that allows the model to capture
different growth profiles. The exponent α measures the
deviation from the dynamics of the simple logistic curve.
The equation (1) corresponds to the original Richards
model for p = 1, that is

and reduces to the generalized logistic model for α = 1
and p = 1.
Keeping in view the development of data in terms of
the positive tests, variations, and deaths on every next
day we may consider the change in C over a unit interval
of time. We express the rate of change of C, that is Ċ(t),

in difference form as ∆C
∆t . Here ∆C = Cn+1 − Cn is the
change in positively tested patients. Thus we reshape the
equation (1) in the discrete form as

 α 
Cn
Cn+1 = Cn + rCnp 1 −
,
(3)
K
where Cn is the number of positively tested patients
on nth day. The discrete generalized Richard model
(DGRM) provides an effective way to monitor the pandemic in the form of a mapping, thus connecting the data
on nth day with (n + 1)th day. The stable points of the
discrete generalized Richards model given in equation (3)
are Cn = 0, that implies no positively tested patients,
and Cn = K. The stable points are the same as obtained
by the generalized Richards model.
c. Numerical results and real-time data We write
the discrete generalized growth model (DG2 M), as
Cn+1 = Cn + rCnp ,

(4)

which provides exponential growth for p = 1, that is
Cn+1 = r1n C1 , that relates the number of positively
tested patients on the first day with the number of postively tested patients after a number of n days has passed,
here r1 = 1 + r. Hence for the parameter p = 0 we find
linear increase with respect to n as Cn+1 = C1 + nr, and
sub-exponential growth for 0 < p < 1.
The outbreak is discussed in the initial phase in the
three countries, that is China, Italy and USA. In the
presence of an almost consistent growth of young population and large old population, the population pyramid
in the three countries has close resemblance, as shown
in figure ??. The population between 15 and 65 years
is 70%, 64% and 63%, whereas above 65 years of age
in China, Italy and USA is, respectively, 9.55%, 22.41%
and 14.79%. However the pandemic has effected the three
countries in diversely different pattern hinting at the preparedness of the countries to tackle such natural disasters
as we show in the following discussion.
In order to make a relation between the number of positively tested cases reported every day with the increase
in the number of these cases per day, we develop double
log plot, shown in figure 1. We compare the data of the
patients with the discrete generalized growth model given
in equation (4). Taking the logrythm of the equation (4),
we write the corresponding relation for the logrythm of
the increase in the number of patients log ∆Cn as
log ∆Cn = p log Cn + log r ,

(5)

which is the equation of a straight line, in
(log ∆Cn , log Cn ) plane. Here p expresses the slope
of the straight line.
Interestingly a comparison of the real time data of
the positively tested patients with equation (5) makes
it appear in two sub-groups: First sub-group of the
data makes a straight line that describes the evolution
of COVID-19 pandemic in its early days. The outbreak
follows a certain rate r of its spread that define the corresponding straight line as expressed in equation (5). The

FIG. 1. We show log-log plot between the number of positive
cases and the day-to-day increase in number in the alphabetical order: In the upper panel we show the real-time data of
patients in China showing logrythm of the number of increase
in the positively tested COVID-19 patients as a function of
logrythm of positively tested patients. We compare mathematical plots obtained by DG2 M shown in red dashed-line
for r = 1.105 and p = 0.845, whereas the blue dashed-line is
plotted by using DGRM for r = 2.117, p = 0.75, α = 1.3, and
K = 60, 000. In the middle panel we show real-time data for
Italy. We compare the mathematical plots obtained by DG2 M
model shown in red dashed-line for r = 2.46 and p = 0.72,
whereas the line plotted by means of DGRM has r = 0.33,
p = 0.95, α = 1, and K = 155, 000; In the lower panel we
show the comparison for USA. Here we have the data obtained by DG2 M shown in red dashed-line for r = 0.202 and
p = 1.115, whereas the blue dashed-line plotted by employing
DGRM for r = 2.718, p = 0.775, α = 1.4, and K = 950, 000.

parameter p describes the spread of the outbreak, it is
sub-exponential for 0 < p < 1, exponential for p = 1, and
faster than exponential for p > 1. It appears in figure 1 as
a red line for the three different countries, that is China,
Italy and USA respectively; Second, the next stage of the
outbreak makes another straight line as shown by blue

line in figure 1. The point of intersection of the two lines,
indicated by vertical arrows in figure 1, corresponds to
the preventive measures adopted by the respective country. For example, the early intersection of the two lines
in case of China indicates a general lock down in most
of the provinces of China on January 26,2020, as soon as
the reported cases were around one thousands. Whereas
in the case of Italy it happened after an order of magnitude increase in number that is around 10000, as appears
in figure 1. In case of USA we find the intersection point
appears even farther.
We obtain the mathematical results by the discrete
generalized growth model, discrete generalized logistic
growth model and the discrete generalized Richard model
by using the r and p values obtained from above discussion for China, Italy and USA. The obtained results are
compared with the real time data of COVID-19 patients
obtained from these countries, as shown in figure 2.

FIG. 2. We plot the number (in thousands) of positively
tested cases versus the number of days, in the alphabetical
order for China, Italy and USA. The description of the red
dashed-line and blue dashed-line, and the values of the parameters is the same as given in figure 1. The blue dashed line in
lower panel dedicated to USA data shows the pandemic dynamics following DG2 M, whereas the blue line expresses the
COVID-19 pandemic dynamics following DGRM.

The plots show that the discrete generalized growth
model (DG2 M) show the gradual increase that matches
very good with the real time data of positively tested
patients in the three countries. The preventive measures

taken in China show a gradual deviation from the DG2 M
model, whereas it is taken over by the DGRM. In case
of Italy the gradual deviation of real-time data is also
seen, reflecting a slow down of the outbreak, that indicates a positive effect of the steps taken by the government of Italy, such as strict lock down, intercity travel
and closure of education sector, and unnecessary travels.
In case of USA, the data is showing a deviation from
DG2 M, however it is not significantly close of DGRM.
The blue dashed-line indicates the future growth of the
coronavirus pandemic following DG2 M model showing an
uncontrolled increase. Whereas the blue line shows the
future trend of the pandemic following DGRM model.
This implies that to eradicate the COVID-19 successfully
it is required to take further strict measures.
The logrhythmic evolution, in figure 3, expresses the
size of the outbreak in China, Italy and USA. As the
estimated size of outbreak agrees well with the reported
data of China and Italy, it is expected that in USA in the
absence of further strict measures the coronavirus pandemic may effect around a million people in next fifteen
days, almost 0.3% of USA population in another five days
and before we see a slowing down effect.

FIG. 3. Along the vertical axis we show the logrythm of number of positively tested cases of COVID-19, and the number
of days are along the horizontal axis. The blue dashed-lines
are obtained by DGRM whereas the blue dots represent the
real-time data. The values of the parameters are the same as
given in figure 1.

d. Conclusions We show that an early response
from Italy and USA was necessary to restrict the wide
spread of the pandemic. In comparison with the COVID19 early evolution in China we provide quantitative analysis of the outbreak in Italy and USA. We mathematically identify the transition in the evolution of the pandemic as a function of measure taken by respective governments by classification of corresponding data in stages
which are defined by mathematical parameters. We pro-

nature of expansion of pandemic. We predict a high risk
in USA, where the number of positively tested coronavirus cases may reach one million in the absence of more

strict measures in next fifteen days, and in next twenty
days 0.3% USA population may get infected in a positive
