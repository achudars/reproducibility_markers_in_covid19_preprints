Abstract

28

Background

29

Antigen point of care tests (AgPOCT) can accelerate SARS-CoV-2 testing. As first

30

AgPOCT are becoming available, there is a growing interest in their utility and

31

performance.

32

Methods

33

Here we compare AgPOCT products by seven suppliers: the Abbott Panbio™

34

COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test; the RapiGEN BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag; the Healgen®

35

Coronavirus Ag Rapid Test Cassette (Swab); the Coris Bioconcept Covid.19 Ag

36

Respi-Strip; the R-Biopharm RIDA®QUICK SARS-CoV-2 Antigen; the NAL von

37

minden NADAL COVID19-Ag Test; and the Roche/SD Biosensor SARS-CoV Rapid

38

Antigen Test. Tests were evaluated on recombinant nucleoprotein, cultured endemic

39

and emerging coronaviruses, stored clinical samples with known SARS-CoV-2 viral

40

loads (n=138), stored samples from patients with respiratory agents other than

41

SARS-CoV-2 (n=100), as well as self-sampled swabs from healthy volunteers

42

(n=35).

43

Findings

44

Limits of detection in six of seven tested products ranged between 2.08 X 106 and

45

2.88 X 107 copies per swab, the outlier at 1.58 X 1010 copies per swab. Specificities

46

ranged between 98.53% and 100% in five products, with two outliers at 94.85% and

47

88.24%. False positive results were not associated with any specific respiratory

48

agent. As some of the tested AgPOCT were early production lots, the observed

49

issues with specificity are unlikely to persist.

50

Interpretation

51

The sensitivity range of most AgPOCT overlaps with viral load figures typically

52

observed during the first week of symptoms, which marks the infectious period in the

53

majority patients. AgPOCTs with a limit of detection that approximates the virus

54

concentration above which patients are infectious may enable shortcuts in decision-

55

making in various areas of healthcare and public health.

57

Background

58

The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic challenges public health systems worldwide. In

59

absence of effective vaccines or drugs, virus detection by RT-PCR has been widely

60

adopted to enable nonpharmaceutical interventions based on case finding and

61

contact tracing. Because of its superior sensitivity and specificity, RT-PCR is the gold

62

standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection (1).

63

RT-PCR is a laboratory-based procedure that requires sophisticated equipment,

64

trained personnel, as well as logistics for sample shipment and results

65

communication. Timeliness of results is critical for the control of onward transmission

66

due to the concentration of viral shedding around the time of symptoms (2). The

67

widespread limitation of timely laboratory results is aggravated by the increasing

68

demand for RT-PCR tests certified for in-vitro diagnostic application, creating supply

69

bottlenecks and shortenings of overall testing capacity in many countries (3).

70

Antigen detection is usually inferior to RT-PCR in terms of sensitivity and specificity

71

(4, 5). Nevertheless, the possibility to perform point of care testing can provide

72

essential information when it is needed, even if in some situations the obtained

73

information has to be amended by an RT-PCR result obtained at a later point. As

74

first industry-manufactured antigen point of care test (AgPOCT) devices are

75

becoming available, there is a growing interest in their performance with particular

76

respect to sensitivity and overall specificity, two essential parameters that can guide

77

decisions over fields of application (6). Because of the intense but short-lived nature

78

of SARS-CoV-2 shedding from the upper respiratory tract, the clinical validation of

79

AgPOCT requires great attention to the timing of infection in studied subjects (7, 8).

80

If subjects are tested late in the course of infection, such as in the second week after

81

onset of symptoms, incongruences between RT-PCR and AgPOCT will cause an

82

apparently low clinical sensitivity for AgPOCT that is not necessarily relevant when

83

using these tests to diagnose early acute infections. From a practical perspective,

84

knowledge of the analytical- rather than clinical sensitivity of AgPOCT may be

85

sufficient to judge their utility in various fields of application, as compared to the well-

86

established RT-PCR as a reference method (9).

87

Here we aimed to compare seven available AgPOCT devices against an established

88

RT-PCR assay (10) by conducting a single-center evaluation in a laboratory setting.

89

Evaluation of analytical sensitivity relied on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein,

90

SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatants, as well as stored clinical samples with

91

established SARS-CoV viral loads. Specificity was evaluated on cell culture

92

supernatants containing endemic and emerging human Coronaviruses, clinical

93

samples that earlier tested positive for respiratory pathogens, as well as fresh

94

nasopharyngeal self-swabs of healthy subjects.

95
96

Material and methods

97

Clinical samples

98

All stored specimens were taken for routine diagnostic testing with no extra

99

procedures required for the study. Specimens were stored in phosphate-buffered

100

saline (PBS) or universal transport medium (Copan UTM™) at -20°C. Respiratory

101

samples for specificity testing were obtained during 2019 from patients hospitalized

102

at Charité medical center and tested by the NxTAG® Respiratory Pathogen Panel

103

(Luminex). SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were collected between March and

104

October 2020 and tested and quantified by the SARS-CoV-2 E-gene assay as

105

published previously (10, 11). RNA was extracted from clinical samples by using the

106

MagNA Pure 96 system (Roche). The viral RNA extraction was performed using

107

100µl of sample, eluted in 100µl. Viral RNA of human coronaviruses (CoVs) other

108

than SARS-CoV-2 was quantified by real-time RT-PCR using specific in vitro

109

transcribed RNA standards (10, 12, 13). Virus RNA concentrations are given as

110

copies per mL.

111

SARS-CoV-2 negative healthy subjects

112

Healthy volunteers were employees of the institute of virology, between 22 and 61

113

years of age (median, 34.7 years). All subjects received instructions as well as

114

material to conduct self-testing with all AgPOCT at one point of time. All testing was

115

done under supervision of trained personal. Of note, most manufacturers do not list

116

self-test in their instructions for use. However, in recent study, self-sampling was

117

shown to be a reliable alternative to professional nasopharyngeal swabs for

118

AgPOCT (14). All manufacturers´ instructions were exactly followed during self-

119

sampling.

120

AgPOCT testing

121

For the evaluation of the AgPOCTs, 50µl of stored respiratory samples (swab

122

resuspended in 1-3 mL of phosphate-buffered saline or universal transport medium)

123

were mixed with sample buffer volume as specified in the manufacturers’

124

instructions. Results in the form of a band on immunochromatography paper were

125

scored independently by two persons. In case of discrepant evaluations, a third

126

person was consulted to reach a final decision. In case of test failure indicated by

127

absence of a visible positive control band, the test procedure was repeated on the

128

same sample. All SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative samples that showed a false-positive

129

result in POCTs were retested.

130
131

Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (SARS-CoV-2-N)

132

The coding sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein was amplified, purified and

133

cloned into the expression vector pET151/D-TOPO (Thermofisher Scientific). E. coli

134

Bl21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the pET151/D-TOPO-SARS-CoV-2 N

135

plasmid. Proteinpurification was performed by affinity chromatography under native

136

conditions as described previously with minor modifications (15). A second

137

purification step was included using heparine sepharose columns. N protein was

138

eluted with a NaCl gradient. For analytical sensitivity experiments SARS-CoV-2-N

139

protein was diluted in PBS and 50 µl of each dilution were applied to each test.

140

Three replicates per test were performed.

Cell

144

(HCoV)229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1 as well as MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and

145

SARS-CoV-2 were tested in duplicates. Viral RNAs were extracted from cell culture

146

supernatants by the viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's

147

instructions. RNA concentration in all samples was determined by specific real-time

148

RT-PCR and in vitro-transcribed RNA standards designed for absolute quantification

149

of viral load. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 additional quantification was done by

150

plaque titration (11).

151

Statistical analysis

152

Logistic regression analyses were run using the PyMC3 package in Python (16). The

153

logistic regression model was implemented as follows:

154

y ~ Bernoulli(θ)

155

θ = logistic(alpha + beta * X)

156

alpha ~ Normal(0, 15)

157

beta ~ Normal(0, 15)

158
159

Where X is the observed log10 SARS-CoV-2 RNA / mL, and y is the AgPOCT result.

160

Models were run for 25000 iterations with 5000 tuning steps using the automatically

161

assigned No-U-Turn sampler and an acceptance rate of 0.95. Models were

162

assessed for convergence using the Gelman Rubin statistic and visualization of

163

posterior traces. Posterior predictive distributions were used to assess model fit.

164
165

Ethical statement

166

The use of stored clinical samples for validation of diagnostic methods without

167

person-related data is covered by section 25 of the Berlin hospital law and does not

168

require ethical or legal clearance. The ethical committee has been notified of the

169

study and acknowledged receipt under file number EA1/369/20. The testing of

170

employees is part of an ongoing study on SARS-CoV-2 infection in employees under

171

Charité ethical review board file number EA1/068/20.

Results

174

Analytical Sensitivity

175

Initial comparisons of analytical sensitivity relied on purified bacterially-expressed

176

viral nucleocapsid protein, the target protein of all assays. Protein concentrations

177

between 5 and 25 ng/mL were detectable by most assays, corresponding to 250 to

178

1250 ng of protein per 50 µl sample volume (Table 1). To confirm these figures on

179

viral protein, we tested cell culture supernatants from SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero

180

cells at defined concentrations of infectious (plaque-forming) units (PFU) of virus.

181

Almost all AgPOCT reliably detected ca. 44 PFU of virus per assay (Table 1). The

182

assays by manufacturers I, III, V, and VII detected as little as 4.4 PFU of virus per

183

test. The assay by manufacturer II was considerably less sensitive in detecting

184

recombinant protein as well as virus.

185
186

Analytical sensitivity using clinical samples

187

To determine the analytical sensitivity in clinical samples, we used stored swabs

188

obtained in universal transport medium (Copan UTM™) or without any medium. Dry

189

swabs were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and all swab suspensions were

190

tested by RT-PCR as described (10). Of each suspension, 50 µl were introduced into

191

the recommended volume of lysis reagent for each AgPOCT.

192
193

It should be noted that this procedure introduces a pre-dilution step (ca. 1:20) not

194

normally applied in AgPOCT protocols, resulting in a loss of sensitivity as opposed to

195

RT-PCR. On the contrary, the swabs used for this study are standard-gauge flocked

196

swabs that are not provided with AgPOCT. The swabs provided with AgPOCT

197

consist of the same material but are considerably thinner and thus carry less sample

198

volume. To estimate the relative sample input in the present procedure, we inserted

199

standard flocked swabs as well as the swabs included in AgPOCT kits in a solution

200

of 50% sucrose and determined the relative sample volume contained in each swab

201

by weighing. The resulting relative sample volume carried on AgPOCT swabs was

202

ca. 40% (range, ca. 10-90%) of that in standard-gauge swabs. Taking the above-

203

mentioned pre-dilution into account, this results in an approximately 8-fold lesser

204

sample input in AgPOCT in the present study, as opposed to direct application as

205

per manufacturer's instructions. This factor should be accounted for when directly

206

comparing against RT-PCR sensitivity in the following. It should be noted that the

207

piece-to-piece variability of swabs in some supplier´s AgPOCT assays is

208

considerable.

209
210

A total of 138 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive samples were tested (Figure 1A).

211

Median virus load was 2.49 X 106 (range: 1.88 X 104 - 2.75 X 109) copies per mL of

212

swab suspension. Depending on initial testing and available volume per clinical

213

sample, up to 115 clinical samples per assay were used to evaluate AgPOCT assays

214

(Figure 1B). Only 45 samples were used for the assay by manufacturer II, which

215

detected only 4 of 45 samples correctly, each of these four samples containing more

216

than 2 x108 RNA copies/mL, leading us to terminate further sensitivity testing for this

217

product. The distribution of test samples across all AgPOCT products is shown in

218

Figure 1B.

219

Based on this testing, a binary logistic regression analysis was performed to

220

determine 50% and 95% limits of detection per AgPOCT (Supplementary Figure 1).

221

Without correction for the lower sample input as opposed to standard AgPOCT

222

protocols in our study, the RT-PCR-quantified virus concentrations at which 95% hit

223

rates are achieved ranged between 3.4 X 106 and 7.41 X 107 copies per ml of swab

224

suspension for the five most sensitive assays. With correction for sample input, these

225

figures are lower by a factor of approximately 8 (Table 2).

226

Exclusivity testing

227

To determine any systematic cross-reactivity with relevant viral antigens, we tested

228

cell- or tissue culture supernatants containing known concentrations of the four

229

endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) as well as MERS- and SARS-CoV, applying

230

50 µl of supernatant into the lysis buffer of each AgPOCT (Table 3). With one

231

exception that was not reproducible, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity

232

towards HCoVs and MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV was cross-detected by all assays.

233

We tested 100 stored clinical samples from patients with known acute infections

234

caused by respiratory viruses other than SARS-CoV-2, including some samples

235

containing mycoplasma and legionella. With one exception, all assays detected

236

either none, one, or two false positive results in 100 tests (Table 4). Of note, about

237

half of all false positive results were reproducible upon re-testing of the same

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.12.20230292; this version posted November 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this

238

sample, while there was no association with any specific known pathogen in the

239

samples. This suggests a specific factor other than the tested pathogens to cause

240

positive signals. In 15 samples that tested false positive in total, one sample caused

241

a positive signal in two different assays.

242
243

Testing of healthy volunteers

244

In view of the rates of false positive results in clinical samples with two of the assays,

245

we conducted a self-testing exercise using all AgPOCT, employing healthy

246

laboratory members without signs of respiratory tract infection. As summarized in

247

Table 5, the same AgPOCT that generated false positive results with stored clinical

248

samples also showed increased rates of positives during testing of healthy subjects.

249

All positive results were resolved to false positive through immediate testing by RT-

250

PCR.

Discussion

262

We provide a comparison of performance of seven AgPOCT assays that have

263

recently become available on the European market. These medical diagnostic

264

devices are cleared in many countries for use outside the laboratory as long as

265

testing results are supervised by medical personnel. The short turnaround time of

266

these tests is expected to enable major changes in clinical and public health

267

practice, given that sensitivity and specificity is sufficient. Because of the strong

268

demand during a constantly evolving situation, the latter question has not been

269

thoroughly clarified for most AgPOCT products.

270

The aim of the present study was to ease some of the challenges associated with

271

the clinical evaluation of AgPOCTs during the present pandemic situation. As the

272

arrival of prototype tests coincided with a time of low incidence over the summer

273

months in the Northern hemisphere, the recruitment of freshly infected subjects for

274

clinical evaluation has been difficult. Due to the rapid change of viral loads over the

275

acute phase of COVID-19 illness (11, 17), AgPOCT have a narrow timeframe for

276

their useful application that basically comprises the first week of symptoms. In view

277

of the growing experience with RT-PCR testing during this timeframe, we aimed to

278

mainly provide a reflection of test performance based on analytical properties, i.e.,

279

the approximate viral concentrations that can be detected by the assays as well as

280

their propensity to generate false positive results.

281

In terms of sensitivity, the detection range of most tests seemed to range between

282

one and ten million copies per swab (accounting for a systematic pre-dilution as

283

explained above) and thus corresponds to a concentration that predicts a virus

284

isolation success rate of ca. 20% in cell culture (11, 18, 19). In the cited studies, this

285

level of isolation success is typically reached by the end of the first week of

286

symptoms. He et al. have shown that this point in time also correlates with the end of

287

factual transmissibility (17). Although many caveats remain, the point in the course of

288

the first week of symptoms at which AgPOCT results turn negative may thus indicate

289

the time at which infectivity resolves. In a situation marked by transition to higher

290

incidence rates, the immediate availability of test results could enable novel public

291

health concepts in which decisions to isolate or maintain isolation are based on

292

infectivity testing rather than infection screening. Upon first patient contact, a positive

293

result in AgPOCT could also help physicians decide on immediate isolation

294

measures based on the identification of individuals who shed particularly large

295

amounts of virus. In hospitalized patients at the end of their clinical course, negative

296

AgPOCT results may provide an additional criterion to safely discharge patients.

297

Screening of asymptomatic subjects with the expectation of absence of virus is more

298

difficult. Given the limitations of sensitivity, the results of AgPOCT should be

299

understood as a momentary assessment of infectiousness rather than a diagnosis

300

with power to exclude infection. As there is a steep incline of virus concentration

301

around or before the onset of symptoms, guidelines for using AgPOCT should

302

mention that a negative test results may reflect a lack of sensitivity, particularly when

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.12.20230292; this version posted November 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this

303

symptoms occur short after testing. Instructions that limit the validity of a negative

304

test result in healthy subjects to the day of application could be used to address this

305

challenge.

306

Also, the limited specificity of most AgPOCT should trigger RT-PCR confirmation of

307

positive tests whenever possible. We have seen acceptable rates of false positive

308

results with most AgPOCT but rates around 10% with two assays in particular. One

309

of these assays (R-Biopharm) was tested here as a preliminary version predating the

310

marketed product. The other assay may suffer from lot-to-lot variability as an

311

independent study of the same product does not show comparable issues with false

312

positives (information based on product insert by the distributor, HealGen).

313

There are clear limitations to our study. For instance, we can only provide an

314

approximate sensitivity assessment for individual AgPOCT as we used stored

315

samples on which we had to apply equal preanalytical treatments despite slight

316

differences between kits in terms of the size of the swab samples. An absolute

317

assessment of limits of detection for each test, as well as a strict comparison of

318

relative sensitivities is therefore not possible. Also, the encountered issues with

319

specificity of two products are likely to be transitory issues that can likely be

320

amended by adjustments of reagent concentrations and improvements of production

321

processes in the very near future, perhaps even before some products become

322

widely available. Our study finally does not compare practical differences between

323

assays, for instance, whether sample buffers come as bulk volume or are pre-filled in

324

reaction tubes. These issues are a main subject to the qualification of products as

325

consumer-grade tests (home tests), a process that is underway for some but not all

326

products. There are other limitations, including the absence of clinical information

327

due to anonymization of samples. Nevertheless, the present contribution provides an

328

early impression about the performance of AgPOCT of several major distributors.

Mean concentration that yields 50% or 95% positive results according to a binary logistic regression

364

analysis. Numbers in parenthesis denote the 95% highest posterior density interval determined by the

365

Bayesian binary logistic regression model. Concentration per swab presumes that swabs are

366

resuspended in 1 mL of fluid during preanalytical processes in RT-PCR used to determine viral loads.

367

c

368

d

Model fit was suboptimal due to a large difference in the number of positive and negative test results.
Due to a systematic preanalytical dilution factor in our AgPOCT evaluations, the projected mean

369

concentrations at which 95% hit rate are achieved were corrected to be 8-fold (0.9 Log10) lower. This

370

correction factor is an average over all correction factors between the actual volume input in our

371

validation studies and the volume input as per manufacturer´s instruction. Input volumes in all cases

372

are subject to great variability due to the undefined volumes of viscous respiratory tract specimens

373

taken up by swab sampling devices. The here-provided statistical evaluation suggests a level of

374

precision that does not reflect the clinical reality in AgPOCT use.
