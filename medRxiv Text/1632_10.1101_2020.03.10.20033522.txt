Abstract
Introduction: the current worldwide outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
due to a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is seriously threatening the public health. The
number of infected patients is continuously increasing and the need for Intensive Care
Unit admission ranges from 5 to 26%. The mortality is reported to be around 3.4% with
higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities. Moreover, this condition
is challenging the healthcare system where the outbreak reached its highest value. To
date there is still no available treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical and preclinical
evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) has a beneficial effect on the coronavirusmediated acute respiratory syndrome, and this can be related to its viricidal effect. The
time from the symptoms’ onset to the development of severe respiratory distress is
relatively long. We hypothesize that high concentrations of inhaled NO administered
during early phases of COVID-19 infection can prevent the progression of the disease.
Methods and analysis: This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Spontaneous
breathing patients admitted to the hospital for symptomatic COVID-19 infection will be
eligible to enter the study. Patients in the treatment group will receive inhaled NO at
high doses (140-180 parts per million) for 30 minutes, 2 sessions every day for 14 days
in addition to the hospital care. Patient in the control group will receive only hospital
care. The primary outcome is the percentage of patients requiring endotracheal
intubation due to the progression of the disease in the first 28 days from enrollment in
the study. Secondary outcomes include mortality at 28 days, proportion of negative test
for SARS-CoV-2 at 7 days and time to clinical recovery.
Ethics and dissemination: The trial protocol has been approved at the Investigation
Review Boards of Xijing Hospital (Xi’an, China) and The Partners Human Research
Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, USA) is pending. Recruitment
is expected to start in March 2020. Results of this study will be published in scientific
journals, presented at scientific meetings, and on related website or media in fighting
this widespread contagious disease.

Introduction
The novel Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) has been first identified in China in
December 2019 [1]. As of today, more than 110,000 cases have been reported (with
more than 4,000 deaths) and, while the majority of them is still concentrated in China,
the infection has spread across the country’s border to many Asian countries, as well as
to Europe and to the USA [2].
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family
Coronaviridae. The current outbreak would result from the acquired ability of the virus to
undergo human to human transmission [3], after the jump from the original animal
reservoir (most likely a bat).
In the human host, SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory syndrome (named COVID-19)
which can range from a mild involvement of the upper airways to a severe pneumonia
with Acute Respiratory Syndrome (ARS) and the need of mechanical ventilation in an
intensive care unit (ICU). In early case series, the risk of critical care admission ranges
between 5 and 26%, with higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities
or chronic diseases [4,5]. The time from symptoms onset to development of severe
respiratory distress is relatively long, with a median time of 8 days in which the patient
remains in a state of mild disease characterized by dry cough, fever and mild hypoxia
requiring oxygen supplementation. Once severe disease with the necessity of ICU
develops, the outcome worsens decisively, with mortality raising from 3.4% to 61%
[4,6]. Moreover, ICU staying poses a serious strain on resource-limited hospitals. Thus,
preventing disease progression during the mild phase would be highly desirable both in
terms of morbidity and mortality improvement and healthcare resource-sparing. At the
present time, there are no proven etiological treatments for COVID-19 but some
ongoing clinical trials are testing the effects of anti-viral drugs (NCT04252664 on
ClinicalTrials.gov).
In 2004, a pilot study showed that low dose inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) was able to
shorten the time of ventilatory support during the SARS epidemic, sustained by another
coronavirus, SARS-CoV [7]. In an in vitro study, the NO donor compound S-nitroso-Nacteylpenicillamine increased the survival rate in an in vitro model of SARS-CoV

infected Monkey’s epithelial cells [8], suggesting a possible viricidal effect of the gas.
Inhaled NO at high doses can be administered safely and is known for potential
microbicidal effects [9–12]. While further in-vitro testing for this specific virus is
recommended, we propose a randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of
inhaled NO in preventing progression of COVID-19 disease, when administered at an
early stage.

Methods and analysis
Study design
Multicenter randomized clinical trial.
Study setting
The coordinating center for China of this study is Xijing Hospital, the Fourth Military
Medical University in Xi’an, Shaanxi, China.
The coordinating center for other centers is the Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston, Massachusetts, USA. This study is open to other centers willing to participate.
For more information see section “Contacts”.
Eligibility criteria
Adults in-hospital patients (>18 years old) will be recruited within 72 hours after
confirmation of COVID-19 by real-time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR) on oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs or stool samples.
Diagnosis can also be obtained by detection of COVID-19 IgM/IgG antibodies in serum,
plasma or whole blood sample.
Symptoms of COVID-19 must include presence of fever of at least 36.6 °C from the
axillary site or 37.2 °C from the oral site or 37.6 °C from the rectal / tympanic site.
In addition, patient must be spontaneously breathing with a respiratory rate of at least
24 breaths per minute and/or an objective persistent cough consistent with COVID-19
symptoms.

The patients with or without hypoxia will be included. Gas exchange and ventilation may
be assisted by means of any continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) system, or
any system of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with positive end-expiratory pressure
(PEEP) ≤ 10 cmH2O.
Criteria of exclusion are pregnancy (all women in fertile age should be tested for
pregnancy before being enrolled); presence of an open tracheostomy; therapy with
high-flow nasal cannula; clinical contraindication to NO gas delivery, as judged by the
attending physician; hospitalized and confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 for more than
72 hours.
Table 1 summarize inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Interventions
This is a randomized (1:1) controlled, parallel arm clinical trial to verify that brief periods
of inhaled NO at high doses can improve clinical course reducing the number of patients
who undergo endotracheal intubation for COVID-19 in the first 28 days after enrollment
in the study (primary endpoint).
Once admitted to the hospital with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (obtained by RTPCR for SARS-COVID-2 virus, or positive in COVID-19 IgM/IgG antibodies) the patients
will be screened. Eligible patients randomized to the treatment group will receive iNO to
target an average inspiratory concentration between 140 to 180 ppm. The
administration of iNO will be performed through a non-invasive ventilation circuit with a
range between 2 and 10 cmH2O of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) or a nonrebreathing mask without positive end expiratory pressure depending on the clinical
needs of the patient and availability of respiratory equipment. The patients will undergo
2 sessions per day with the duration between 20 and 30 minutes. A representation of
the administration setting in shown in Figure 1.
The NO gas therapy will continue for 14 days or until the primary outcome event is
reached (i.e., clinical deterioration with indication for intubation and mechanical
ventilation). Other criteria for the interruption of the therapy are: negative result on RTPCR for the presence of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, endpoint 3); hospital discharge

or recovery from the symptoms, defined as normalization of fever, respiratory rate, and
alleviation of cough, sustained for at least 72 hours (endpoint 4). A flowchart of the
study is presented in Figure 2.
The evaluation of the patients will continue for 28 day after the enrollment.
Since treatment with inhaled NO can lead to increase in plasmatic methemoglobin, the
blood levels of methemoglobin will be monitored via non-invasive CO-oximeter or
methemoglobin levels in blood. If methemoglobin levels rise above 5% at any point of
the study, inhaled NO concentration will be immediately stopped until the subsequent
dose. For safety reason we will also evaluate NO2 level in order to keep it below 5 ppm.
If we observe an increase above this value, we will immediately interrupt the
administration of NO until the subsequent dose.
Patients assigned to the control group will not receive any gas therapy.

Outcomes
The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients who progress to a severe form of
the disease, defined as the indication given by the attending physician to intubation and
mechanical ventilation in the first 28 days after enrollment in the study. Patients in
severe respiratory failure and/or ventilatory distress with indication to intubation but
concomitant DNI (Do Not Intubate) will meet criteria for primary endpoint. The
proportion of intubation will be calculated at 28 days from study enrollment.
Secondary outcomes include:
-Mortality from any cause at 28 days (endpoint 2)
-Proportion of negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 from upper respiratory tract
specimens at 7 days (endpoint 3)
-Time to clinical recovery, defined as: normalization of fever (≤ 36.6 C from the axillary
site; or ≤ 37.2 C from the oral site; or ≤ 37.8 C from the rectal/tympanic site) plus
normalization of respiratory rate < 24 breaths/min and alleviation of cough (defined as
mild or absent in a patient-reported scale of severe>>moderate>>mild>>absent) or
discharge home (endpoint 4).

Data collection
Clinical information including medical history and laboratory exams will be obtained from
the medical charts and prospectively recorded until discharge or death. Collection of
study variables will be managed by the outcome assessors by using a dedicated
patient’s file on Studytrax. The 28 days follow up, if the patient is discharged from the
hospital, will be performed by a phone call.
Outcome assessors, treatment providers and the principal investigator will obtain unique
usernames and password to transfer all data to a Studytrax page dedicated to the
study. Data access is restricted only to authorized member of the team which will be
responsible for strict confidentiality all times. The signed informed consent will be kept in
a secure place for at least 5 years after study completion.

Sample size calculation
Based on previously published data on COVID 19 [4], we predict an incidence of
intubation and mechanical ventilation of 12.3%. However, because of the novel nature
of this study, we do not have enough data to predict the effect of inhaled NO on the
primary outcome. The dynamic trend of this ongoing outbreak also prevents us to
determine the rate of enrollment that we can achieve. As such, in Table 2 we are
displaying the sample size calculation for our primary outcome, for an alpha level of
0.05 and a power level of 0.8, under different scenario. We will perform a first analysis
based on 240 patients, evaluating the actual incidence of the primary outcome, effect of
the treatment and the actual rate of enrollment. The PI will decide, together with the
DSMB, whether to continue enrollment to 340 patients, if a sufficient rate of enrollment
and power had not been achieved with the original sample size. Based on results
reported in Table 2, the same step could then be repeated increasing sample size from
340 to 500 patients, from 500 patients to 760 and from 760 patients to 1260.

Statistical analysis
Data will be analyzed following the intention to treat analysis principle. Demographic
and clinical data will be presented as proportions for categorical outcomes and mean
plus standard deviation or median plus interquartile range for continuous outcomes.
Comparison between groups will be made with the X2 test or the Fisher exact test for
categorical variables and with the t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous
variables. For the t-test the normality distribution will be evaluated.
Time to event outcomes will be analyzed by estimating survival curves over treated and
non-treated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
A subgroup analysis will be performed with multiple linear regression, as well as logistic
and cox regression models to adjust for age, pulmonary comorbidities and coadministration of other experimental treatment.

Data monitoring
Data will be monitored by the principal investigator (PI) in collaboration with an
independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). PI, and DSMB will monitor
adverse events and quality of the data and provide recommendations. The PI will
monitor compliance to safety rules every 20 patients. Every violation will be reported to
the DSMB. Peripheral centers will be provided with a data sheet providing safety rules
and will be instructed to report every violation to the coordinating hospital. Before the
beginning of the study, the DSMB will meet to decide safety rules and stopping
guidelines.
We will not perform any interim analysis, but the DSMB will be granted the authority to
stop the trial at any point due to safety concerns.

Conclusion
The aim of this trial is to evaluate whether high dose of NO administered at an early
stage can safely reduce or prevent the progression of COVID-19 disease. This study is
