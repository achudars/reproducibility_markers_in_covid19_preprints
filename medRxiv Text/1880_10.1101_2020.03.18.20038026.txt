Abstract
Background: Since the new coronavirus epidemic in China in December 2019,
information and discussions about COVID-19 have spread rapidly on the Internet
and have quickly become the focus of worldwide attention, especially on social
media.
Objective: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public’s attention to
COVID-19-related events in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in
China (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot
search list.
Methods: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina
Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020 and
described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST
CM6.0 (ROST Content Mining System Version 6.0) was used to analyze the collected
text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further
described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used
VOSviewer to implement a visual cluster analysis of hot keywords and build a social
network of public opinion content.
Results: The study has four main findings. First, we analyzed the changing trend
of the public’s attention to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into
three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of public attention at each stage are

slightly different. In addition, the emotional tendency of the public toward the
COVID-19 epidemic-related hot topics has changed from negative to neutral, with
negative emotions weakening and positive emotions increasing as a whole. Finally,
we divided the COVID-19 topics with the most public concern into five categories:
(1) new COVID-19 epidemics and their impact; (2) frontline reporting of the
epidemic and prevention and control measures; (3) expert interpretation and
discussion on the source of infection; (4) medical services on the frontline of the
epidemic; and (5) focus on the global epidemic and the search for suspected cases.
Conclusions: This is the first study of public attention on the COVID-19 epidemic
using a Chinese social media platform (i.e., Sina Microblog). Our study found that
social media (e.g., Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention to public
health emergencies. During the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, a large amount of
information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated on Sina Microblog and
received widespread public attention. We have learned about the hotspots of public
concern regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. These findings can help the government
and health departments better communicate with the public on health and translate
public health needs into practice to create targeted measures to prevent and control
the spread of COVID-19.

Introduction
Pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease
that is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets and contact and is generally
infectious to human beings1. On January 11, 2020, after pathogenic nucleic acid
testing (NAT), China reported 41 cases of pneumonia infected with the novel
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) for the first time2, which was the world’s first reported
human infection with the novel coronavirus. On January 30, 2020, the World Health
Organization listed the novel coronavirus epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of
International Concern (PHEIC) 3. As of February 20, 2020, a total of 75,465
confirmed cases and 2,236 deaths have been reported in mainland China 4. The
novel coronavirus has caused great challenges and threats to public health in China
and has quickly become the focus of worldwide attention. Information and
discussions about COVID-19 have spread rapidly online, especially on social media.
To fight against COVID-19 and promote the prevention and control of the epidemic,
researchers have recently made efforts in various aspects; their research involves

epidemiological research 5,6,7, diagnostic methods of the novel coronavirus 8,9,10,11,
clinical characteristics of the disease 12,13,14,15,16, characteristics of disease
transmission 17,18,19, development of candidate therapies 20,21,22, the identification of
animal hosts 23,24,25,26, etc. However, there has been no research conducted on the
public’s attention to COVID-19. Since public participation is required to prevent and
control the epidemic spread of infectious diseases, it is extremely important to learn
about the public’s attention to COVID-19 during the current epidemic. Such
knowledge is of great significance when guiding people to respond appropriately to
the epidemic and helping them learn how to cope with the sudden infectious disease
of COVID-19, and it also supports social stability 27.
Social media has developed rapidly in recent years. Increasing numbers of public
health departments and individuals are using social media platforms to
communicate and share information during public health emergencies. Social media
has become an important channel for promoting risk communication during the
crisis28,29. The use of social media to measure public attention has also been
gradually applied to research on infectious diseases, such as H7N9 27,30,31,
Ebola28,32,33, 34,35,36, Zika virus29, 37,38, MERS-CoV39, and Dengue fever40.
Sina Microblog ("Weibo" for short) is one of the most popular social media
platforms in China and is equivalent to Twitter within China. As of the fourth
quarter of 2018, the number of monthly active users had reached 462 million, and
approximately 200 million people are using Sina Microblog every day41. The Sina
Microblog hot search list is the ranking of the most followed and hottest information
on Sina Microblog and is the most popular functional module in Sina Microblog
applications42, 43. This ranking is sorted according to the search volume of the hot
topics that users searched for within a certain period. The higher the search volume
is, the higher the ranking is, which directly reflects the public attention and attitude
toward the topic.
This paper studies public attention given to COVID-19 on Sina Microblog by
searching for and analyzing topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina
Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020. This is the
first time that a Chinese social media platform (i.e., Sina Microblog) has been used to
study the public attention of COVID-1944. In this study, we describe the trend of
public attention given to topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic and the hot topic
keywords of public concern, we analyze the emotional tendencies and trends of hot
topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic, and we conduct a visual cluster analysis of
the hot topic content. This approach is used to obtain timely access to public
responses so that the government and the health department can better

communicate with the public on health issues and take appropriate measures to
prevent and control the epidemic 35, 39.

Methods
Research Overview
The research process mainly includes five steps: (1) collect topics related to the
COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list, (2) segment the collected
text into words, (3) describe the Sina Microblog search trend about the COVID-19
epidemic; (4) evaluate public opinion through word frequency and sentiment
analysis; and (5) construct a social network of public opinion through the subject
analysis of public opinion content. Each step is described in detail below.
Data Collection
We obtained information on the COVID-19 infection in mainland China from the
National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (PRC NHC) 45. The
Wuhan Municipal Health Committee first reported viral pneumonia of unknown
causes on December 31, 2019 46. This study collected topics on the Sina Microblog
hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, using Weibo Search
Rank47 from ENLIGHTENT48, and selected topics and search volume related to the
COVID-19 epidemic. A total of 4,056 topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic were
on the hot search list, and 3,234 remained after excluding duplicate topics; this
group was used as the data basis for further processing, analysis, and discussion.
Data Processing
The topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list
from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, were summarized and classified
daily in chronological order. We used the Chinese words segmentation function in
ROST CM6.0 (ROST Content Mining System Version 6.0) to segment the content of
hot-search topics on Sina Microblog into words 49. After word segmentation, the text
was processed by merging synonyms and deleting nonsense words to provide a
basis for subsequent research.
Data Analysis
Trend Analysis
We plotted the number of topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina
Microblog hot search list and the cumulative search volume by date to explore the
public’s attention given to the COVID-19 epidemic over time. Pearson correlation

analysis was used to explore the relationship between the number of hot search
topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic and the cumulative search volume.
Word frequency and sentiment analysis
After Chinese word segmentation and invalid word filtering, we used ROST CM6.0
software to perform word frequency statistics and sentiment analysis on the Sina
Microblog hot topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic. We calculated the frequency
of keywords appearing in the hot search topics on Sina Microblog, explored the
sentiment tendency of each hot search topic to the COVID-19 epidemic, and
calculated the emotional score.
Social network analysis and visualization
The high-frequency keywords and their frequencies were extracted from the Sina
Microblog hot topic text after word segmentation and invalid word filtering. We
used VOSviewer software to create a visual knowledge map of keyword
co-occurrence analysis and cluster analysis, using the keyword co-occurrence
frequency as the weight50.

Results
Search trend of COVID-19 epidemic on Sina Microblog hot search list
Figure 1 lists the number of COVID-19 epidemic-related topics and the cumulative
search volume on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to
February 20, 2020. Pearson correlation analysis shows that the number of topics
related to the COVID-19 epidemic is positively correlated with the cumulative
search volume of the topic per day (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.767, P
= .000). In other words, the more topics are listed, the greater the cumulative search
volume related to the COVID-19 epidemic per day. We can see that the public's
attention to the COVID-19 epidemic on Sina Microblog can be divided into three
stages. Stage A (December 31, 2019, to January 18, 2020) has low and unstable
public attention, which represents the incubation period. Stage B (January 19 to 26,
2020) has a concentrated increase in public attention, which represents the
epidemic period. Stage C (January 27 to February 20, 2020) demonstrates continued
public attention to the epidemic, representing a widespread period.

cumulative search volume of the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot
search list.
Frequency and distribution of hot search keywords related to the COVID-19
epidemic on Sina Microblog
The top 15 keywords and their frequencies for the three stages of the public's
attention to the COVID-19 epidemic are shown in Table 3. We can find that “Wuhan”,
“case” and “pneumonia” always appear in three periods as hot keywords, and the
remaining keywords in the different periods are slightly different. In stage A,
"unknown cause" and "new coronavirus" are the main keywords, indicating that in
the initial stage of the epidemic, viral pneumonia had just been discovered, and the
cause was unknown. After the pathogen was initially identified as a new coronavirus,
the public began to search for information on new coronaviruses to learn relevant
knowledge. Compared with stage A, stage B has new keywords such as “new”,
“mask”, “first case”, and “first-level response”. The reason for this is that the
COVID-19 epidemic had spread across the country during this stage. The first cases
had appeared successively throughout the country, and the number of confirmed
cases was increasing. The outbreak of the epidemic made the people and the
government aware of the importance of prevention. People began to buy masks, and
governments at all levels initiated first-level responses to major public health
emergencies. Compared with the previous two stages, the main keywords appearing
in stage C are "discharged", "national", "materials" and "Huoshenshan Hospital". At
this stage, the public's attention had shifted to material donation and medical
service assistance in the key epidemic areas in Wuhan. Moreover, the epidemic had
spread throughout the country, and the public was more concerned about the
rehabilitation of patients.

Sentiment analysis of the hot search topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic
on the Sina Microblog
Afer segmentation, we imported the Sina Microblog hot topic text related to the
COVID-19 epidemic into the ROST6.0 sentiment analysis tool and obtained the
sentiment and proportion of the three stages of public attention given to the topics
related to the COVID-19 epidemic on Sina Microblog (Figure 2). Emotions are
classified as positive, negative, and neutral emotions. Based on this, positive and

negative emotions are subdivided into three categories: general, moderate, and high.
Neutral emotions are not subdivided. We found that the sentiment of the hot topics
of the COVID-19 epidemic on Sina Microblog in stage A tended to be negative,
accounting for 29.17%, of which high and moderate negative emotions accounted
for 4.17% and 16.67%, respectively, and positive emotions accounted for the lowest
proportion at 8.33%. In stage B, the majority of the hot search topics were neutral;
however, 22.85% of the hot search topics showed negative emotions, with 0.31%
showing high negative and 3.60% showing moderate negative, while positive
emotions accounted for 12.52%. In stage C, 15.44% of the hot search topics showed
positive emotions, of which moderate positive emotions accounted for 2.26% and
highly positive emotions accounted for 0.31%; in addition, 24.33% of the hot search
topics showed negative emotions. Based on the comprehensive analysis of the
three-stage emotional tendencies, the public's negative emotions toward the
COVID-19 epidemic were weakened as a whole, and their positive emotions were
generally enhanced.

Figure 2. The sentiment statistics of the Sina Microblog hot search topics related to
the COVID-19 epidemic.
Figure 3 shows the trend of the proportion of the daily emotional tendencies of the
hot search topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic from December 31, 2019, to
February 20, 2020. We can see that the three kinds of emotions are relatively
unstable before January 9, 2020. From January 9 to January 20, 2020, negative
emotions accounted for the largest proportion, followed by neutral emotions, and
positive emotions accounted for the smallest proportion.

Compared with before January 20, 2020, the positive emotions of the hot search
topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic after January 20, 2020 are generally on the
rise, the negative emotions decline on the whole, and the emotions tend to be stable,
as seen in Figure 3. This outcome shows that as the COVID-19 epidemic began to
spread throughout the country after January 20, 2020, the public eased their
concerns and fears caused by their uncertainty toward and ignorance of the
epidemic and responded to the COVID-19 epidemic with a more objective attitude.

Social semantic network analysis of hot search topics related to the COVID-19
epidemic on Sina Microblog
To explore the themes reflected by the related topics of the COVID-19 epidemic on
the Sina Microblog hot search list, this study used VOSviewer to generate clusters
and co-occurrence networks of topic keywords. The results are shown in Figure 4.
In the figure, the larger the size of the nodes and the font, the greater the weight of
the keyword is, and the more it is in the core position. The connection between the
nodes indicates that the keywords on the two nodes have appeared together. The
thicker the connection is, the higher the frequency of co-occurrence and the closer
the connection between the nodes. Nodes with the same color belong to the same
cluster.

Figure 4. Social network of high-frequency keywords in the Sina Microblog hot
search topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic.
According to the network visualization graph constructed in Figure 4, we can see
that the keyword "COVID-19" is at the core node position, and the two nodes
"Wuhan" and "add" are next. The core topic of public concern about the COVID-19
epidemic is COVID-19 itself, and the public was extremely concerned about the
status of the epidemic in Wuhan and the new cases. We can divide the
high-frequency keywords of topics into the following five clusters:
Cluster 1 (Red Cluster): Discussion on the new cases, the outbreak of COVID-19
across the country and the impact of the epidemic on the resumption of school and
work. The keywords included are "case", " newly increased ", "appear", "Hubei
Province", "Beijing", etc. (Figure 5a).
Cluster 2 (Green Cluster): Search for news reports on the frontline of the epidemic
and related measures for prevention and control. The keywords include "Wuhan",
"front-line", "inpatient", "quarantine", "living at home", etc. (Figure 5b).
Cluster 3 (Blue Cluster): Search for interpretations of the epidemic situation and
prevention and control knowledge of experts and relevant health departments, as
well as the discussion on the source of infection. The keywords in this cluster

include "academician", "WHO", "face mask", "epidemic prevention", "symptom",
"virus", and "novel coronavirus". (Figure 5c).
Cluster 4 (Yellow Cluster): Search for frontline medical services such as frontline
hospital construction and medical team support. This cluster includes the keywords
"patient", "hospital", "Leishenshan", "Huoshenshan", "first batch", etc. (Figure 5d).
Cluster 5 (Purple Cluster): Search for the global spread of the disease and searching
online for fellow passengers with confirmed cases. This cluster contains the
keywords "passenger", "carriage", "cruise", "suspend", "infection", "Japan", etc.

Discussion
Principal Results
In recent years, as people increasingly seek health information on social media,
social media has played an increasingly important role in public health
emergencies29,35. However, there have been no relevant studies that have
incorporated social media analysis into the public response to the COVID-19
epidemic. We used the Sina Microblog hot search list to analyze the public's
attention to the COVID-19 epidemic from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020,
which was 52 days after the first disclosure of COVID-19 by the Chinese health
department. There are four main findings from this study. First, we analyzed the
changing trend of public attention given to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be
divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of the public’s attention at
each stage are slightly different. In addition, the public's emotional tendency toward
the hot search topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic changed from negative to
neutral across the study period. As a whole, negative emotions weakened, and
positive emotions increased. Finally, we divided the topics of public concern about
the COVID-19 epidemic into five categories through social semantic network
analysis. This study analyzes the public's response to and attention given to the
COVID-19 epidemic, which will help public health professionals monitor public
response, identify public needs as early as possible, make timely public health
prevention and control measures, and disseminate knowledge to citizens in a
targeted manner to better respond to the current COVID-19 epidemic.
From December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, the public's attention given to the
COVID-19 epidemic on Sina Microblog can be divided into three stages. In the
beginning, there was little public attention paid to the epidemic, and then the

concentration of attention increased. Next, the public’s attention given to the
epidemic generally declined, but continued attention was still paid. In the first stage
(December 31, 2019, to January 18, 2020), the Chinese public paid less attention, as
pneumonia was only reported in Wuhan, China. On January 19, 2020, suspected
cases appeared in Shanghai and Shenzhen, and body temperatures began to be
measured at the Wuhan Airport and Railway Station. People began to notice the
severity of the epidemic, and the level of attention paid to the COVID-19 epidemic
began to increase until January 26, 2020. We can see that when the epidemic began
to spread across the country, the public responded quickly to news of the COVID-19
outbreak on Sina Microblog39. This is because COVID-19 is a new infectious disease,
which means that no effective treatment has been found and no corresponding
vaccine has been developed. When the outbreak began, the public was eager to
search the relevant knowledge and information online to meet their own protection
needs27,30. In the third stage (January 27 to February 20, 2020), although the
number of cases of COVID-19 was still increasing, the number of Sina Microblog
topics and search volume was decreasing. The reason for this may be because the
epidemic information was relatively saturated, and it was difficult for people to
acquire more new knowledge through a Sina Microblog search 27. It may also be that
people are no longer paying close attention to the epidemic dynamic to gain a sense
of security as time goes on, and the public's consciousness tends to be rational 51.
The keywords for the three different stages of the public's attention to the COVID-19
epidemic are slightly different. From the hot search keywords of each stage, we
found that the public did not know much about the virus and its causes in the first
stage. The main keywords of the search to seek relevant knowledge were "unknown
cause" and "novel coronavirus". During the second stage, the epidemic began to
spread throughout the country, the first cases were reported in different areas
successively, and the number of confirmed cases continued to increase, thereby
making the public and government aware of the importance of prevention. During
the third stage, the epidemic spread widely throughout the country; Wuhan was the
most seriously affected area, and the city was locked down. The public's attention
was mainly shifted to material donation and medical assistance in Wuhan.
Compared with a qualitative research, it is more accurate to obtain the hot spots of
public attention through keyword frequency analysis, as this process has higher
accuracy and credibility in the research of hot spots and their development trends40.
Based on our high-frequency keyword analysis of the Sina Microblog topics related
to the COVID-19 epidemic, we can obtain information about the concerns and
opinions of Sina Microblog users at different stages52. Studies have found that
people's interest in infectious diseases on social media is linked to the latest news

and major events. Studies have also shown that people will pay attention to and
search for disease-related words as the spread of infectious diseases changes 30.
According to the sentiment tendencies of the hot search topics on the COVID-19
epidemic on Sina Microblog, the first stage of emotion was negative, and the second
and third stages were neutral. On the whole, negative emotions weakened, and
positive emotions increased. Previous studies have pointed out that there is also an
important relationship between emotions and content on social media53. The
content analysis of social networks can identify people's attitudes or reactions to
specific health hazard events30,39. In the first stage, there was less public attention
given to the Sina Microblog hot search list. Most of the topics related to the
COVID-19 epidemic were about the notification of pneumonia and the virus, and the
emotions tended to be negative. At that time, the public had a strong demand for
information on public health emergencies such as infectious diseases. When the
information demand could not be fully satisfied, the users’ emotions were negative40.
As the epidemic progressed to the second and third stages, the public sentiment
tended to be neutral because increasingly more news was reported at this stage, and
objective events became the mainstream information on the Sina Microblog hot
search list. The public reduced their previous levels of worries and fears about the
epidemic; their negative feelings weakened, and their positive emotions increased.
More hot search topics mentioned information about prevention or protection,
which is conducive to public health communication and promotion.
We divided the COVID-19 topics with the highest levels of public concern into five
categories: (1) new COVID-19 epidemics and their impact, (2) frontline reporting of
the epidemic and prevention and control measures, (3) expert interpretation and
discussion on the source of infection, (4) medical services on the frontline of the
epidemic, and (5) focus on the global epidemic and look for suspected cases. From
the search of the subject content, we can see that during the outbreak of the novel
coronavirus, the public, the news media, and the health department all actively used
Sina Microblog as a platform for disseminating COVID-19-related information29,
indicating that Sina Microblog is a communication channel for both individuals or
organizations to publicize COVID-19 symptoms, preventive measures and related
policies37. In addition, as a real-time and extensive online platform, Sina Microblog
provides a channel for information dissemination. For example, in this emergency
outbreak, the public has made good use of the platform to find fellow passengers
with confirmed cases, thereby playing an important role in preventing and
controlling the disease transmission.

Limitations
There are some limitations to this study. First, our study was limited to the period
52 days after COVID-19 was first disclosed by the Chinese health department; thus,
the situation after February 20, 2020, was not included in this study. Second, the
data source for this study is relatively narrow. We regard Sina Microblog as the only
social media platform in China, excluding other popular social media data sources,
such as WeChat and ByteDance, and the study is limited to the publicly available
data on the Sina Microblog hot search list. In addition, due to the lack of detailed
information about the users who contributed to the search volume of the Sina
Microblog hot search list, we could not describe the social demographic information
of the Sina Microblog users, and we failed to obtain the geospatial distribution of
Sina Microblog active users; thus, we could not calculate the average attention of the
public in different regions of China.
Conclusions
Our study found that social media platforms (i.e., Sina Microblog) can be used
to measure public attention given to public health emergencies. Our study shows
that a large amount of information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated
and received widespread public attention on Sina Microblog during the novel
coronavirus epidemic. We have learned about the hotspots of public concern
regarding the COVID-19 epidemic on Sina Microblog. These findings can help the
government and health departments better communicate with the public about
public health and then translate public health needs into practice to create targeted
measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19.
