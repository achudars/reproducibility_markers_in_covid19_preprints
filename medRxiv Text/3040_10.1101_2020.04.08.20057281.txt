Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is wreaking havoc globally, yet knowledge of its biology is limited.
Climate and seasonality influence the distributions of many diseases, and studies suggest a link
between SARS-CoV-2 and cool weather. One such study, building species distribution models
(SDMs), predicted SARS-CoV-2 risk may remain concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere,
shifting northward in summer months. Others have highlighted issues with SARS-CoV-2 SDMs,
notably: the primary niche of the virus is the host it infects, climate may be a weak distributional
predictor, global prevalence data have issues, and the virus is not in a population equilibrium.
While these issues should be considered, climate still may be important for predicting the future
distribution of SARS-CoV-2. To further examine if there is a link, we model with raw cases and
population scaled cases for SARS-CoV-2 county-level data from the United States. We show
that SDMs built from population scaled cases data cannot be distinguished from control models
built from raw human population data, while SDMs built on raw data fail to predict the current
known distribution of cases in the US. The population scaled analyses indicate that climate may
not play a central role in current US viral distribution and that human population density is likely
a primary driver. Still, we do find slightly more population scaled viral cases in cooler areas. This
coupled with our geographically constrained focus make it so we cannot rule out climate as a
partial driver of the US SARS-CoV-2 distribution. Climate’s role on SARS-CoV-2 should
continue to be cautiously examined, but at this time we should assume that SARS-CoV-2 can
spread anywhere in the US.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 and climate overview
As of March 26, 2020, the United States of America has had the most reported cases of
COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 ​(CDC NCIRD, 2020)​. While we
are beginning to better understand the global and US-level distributions of this virus, we are only
starting to learn how abiotic variables affect its basic distribution. With over two months of
SARS-CoV-2 records across US counties, the role of abiotic variables is becoming easier to
examine, especially as multiple sources are compiling data and making it public ​(Dong et al.,
2020; The COVID Tracking Project, 2020; The New York Times, 2020)​.
Organisms are distributed within their environment based on both direct and indirect
interactions with biotic and abiotic variables ​(Elith & Leathwick, 2009)​ — SARS-CoV-2 is no
exception. As this virus is primarily distributed by human hosts, it is constrained by human
distributions and interactions (i.e., biotic variables). There are numerous documented cases on
local and global scales of individual human sources for new outbreaks ​(Holshue et al., 2020;
KCDC, 2020)​. Still, the SARS-CoV-2 has thus far been most concentrated in the Northern
Hemisphere; even there, to date, it has only proliferated in a subset of population centers.
Furthermore, many other viruses, including coronaviruses, display marked seasonality and are
affected by local climatic conditions ​(Fisman, 2012; Gaunt et al., 2010; Lofgren et al., 2007;
Price et al., 2019)​. This has prompted researchers to begin looking globally at how weather and
climate (i.e., a subset of abiotic variables) may relate to the presence and abundance of the
virus.
Modeling the SARS-CoV-2 viral distribution in relation to climate and other abiotic
variables could help refine our understanding, hopefully adding to the knowledge gleaned from
studies on human transmission dynamics ​(Chinazzi et al., 2020; Kucharski et al., 2020)​, which
appear to be explanatory for much of the viral distribution. Climate can also be compared
directly to biotic variables, such as human population density, to disentangle their relative
importances. More dense human populations can have elevated communicable disease spread,
as there is more person-to-person contact ​(Fang et al., 2013)​ — the principal way SARS-CoV-2
is known to spread ​(Rothan & Byrareddy, 2020)​. Any improved understanding of the abiotic
variables influencing the niche of SARS-CoV-2 might, in part, help prevent viral spread.
However, it is important to make clear that the models presented here, and in other recent
studies ​(Araújo & Naimi, 2020; Bariotakis et al., 2020)​, are influenced by the variability of input
parameters, the variables explored, and the restrictions inherent in modeling of any complex

system ​(Elith et al., 2011)​. We present this study to serve as a baseline in our understanding,
given the available data, rather than a definitive model, and hope that our work acts as a
jumping off point for other studies.
SARS-CoV-2 and climate research
Early studies suggest that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may have, at minimum, a loose
association with climatic features. There have been numerous reports showing a correlation of
case incidence with cool temperatures and low humidity ​(Alvarez-Ramirez & Meraz, 2020;
Araújo & Naimi, 2020; Bannister-Tyrrell et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Ficetola & Rubolini,
2020; Notari, 2020; Wang et al., 2020)​. Furthermore, studies that controlled for case growth rate
or demographic factors found that weather was still a significant factor in the success of
SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks ​(Bukhari & Jameel, 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Sajadi et al., 2020)​.
Unfortunately, none of these studies provide a mechanism for how abiotic variables like
temperature might limit or promote the person-to-person transmission of the virus. Still, lipid
enveloped viruses (including coronaviruses) may be more stable outside of the host in lower
humidity and cooler temperatures, conditions that are common in temperate areas in late winter
and early spring ​(Price et al., 2019)​. Furthermore, a mechanism could be indirect, as humans
behave differently in different seasons ​(Bedford et al., 2015; Wesolowski et al., 2017)​.
Scientists often employ species distribution modeling (SDM; sometimes called ecological
niche modeling) to predict geographic ranges of species. SDMs employ environmental data
(typically climate) to predict if geographic space is suitable for a given species or population
(Peterson, 2001)​. These models have proven useful in a wide variety of applications, such as
invasion biology, climate change, zoonotic diseases, and speciation ​(Elith & Leathwick, 2009;
Guisan & Thuiller, 2005)​.
Researchers have begun to create SDMs of SARS-CoV-2 using climatic variables
(Araújo & Naimi, 2020; Bariotakis et al., 2020)​. These studies suggest that the virus is strongly
constrained by global climate patterns ​(Araújo & Naimi, 2020; Bariotakis et al., 2020)​.
Preliminary models also suggest that the virus will continue to be concentrated in the Northern
Hemisphere, shifting northwards throughout the summer and then back towards its current
distribution in the fall and winter ​(Araújo & Naimi, 2020)​.
However, a research group recently put forth a strong rebuttal ​(Chipperfield et al., 2020)
to some of this SDM work ​(Araújo & Naimi, 2020)​. Their main criticism asserts that basic
assumptions underlying SDMs are violated when modeling SARS-CoV-2, due to the mode of

transmission, current population disequilibrium, and failure to incorporate epidemiological data
(Chipperfield et al., 2020)​. Furthermore, they highlight issues pertaining to input data for global
records, such as: Missing data, omitted data, and single localities representing many thousands
of reported cases (hospital coordinates or political centroids) across an entire country ​(Araújo et
al., 2019)​. This is exacerbated as many countries are reporting records based on varied criteria,
such as: Multiple molecular tests and tests using computed tomography scans ​(Lippi et al.,
2020)​. The rebuttal additionally suggested that model evaluation and justification were
insufficient. An updated draft of the original paper ​(Araújo & Naimi, 2020)​ has addressed some
of these issues, and produced reasonable arguments to some others. While we agree with
many arguments from the rebuttal, we believe SDMs have the potential to be useful for
modeling in a number of instances, if done carefully, and have been effective when used for
other diseases ​(Carlson et al., 2016; Pigott et al., 2014, 2015)​ and other instances when data
are limited or incomplete ​(Barbet-Massin et al., 2018; Fois et al., 2018; Galante et al., 2018;
Hernandez et al., 2006; Katz & Zellmer, 2018; Kiedrzyński et al., 2017; Pearson et al., 2006)​.
Still, the current climate SDMs of SARS-CoV-2 may simply reflect the habitat
preferences of their host, humans. Careful consideration of host availability (human population
density) and pathogen ecologies (abiotic variables related to transmission) may be necessary to
frame analyses modeling the global distribution ​(Johnson et al., 2019)​, helping to better ensure
that projected distributions are not simply the result of environmental variables related to human
population density.
SARS-CoV-2 in the US
COVID-19 was first detected in the US on January 20, 2020 ​(Holshue et al., 2020)​, has
since been detected in all 50 states, and continues to spread rapidly ​(Chinazzi et al., 2020)​.
Quality county-level data are also publically available ​(Dong et al., 2020; The COVID Tracking
Project, 2020; The New York Times, 2020)​. SARS-CoV-2 is predicted, as of April 4, 2020, to
cause >90,000 deaths in the US ​(IHME COVID-19 team & Murray, 2020)​. However, like much
of the world, the case distribution is rapidly changing and the case numbers are rapidly growing.
Models and projections are clearly subject to change as incoming case data increases. Public
policy decisions (e.g., self isolation) are also surely going to impact the spread of this
coronavirus, and are difficult to account for at the time due to the lag time between policy and
changes in case load.

While our models and the models produced elsewhere are sure to have issues,
COVID-19 may peak in the US largely throughout April ​(IHME COVID-19 team & Murray, 2020)​.
Accordingly, the time to produce predictions is now. We are creating a baseline of information
that can, and should be, evaluated and tested as more data become available in more regions.
Ultimately, these baselines may be particularly helpful not only in the US, but in other countries
that are only just beginning to encounter the pandemic.

The code and results used in this study are deposited under a CC-BY-NC 4.0 License on
Github (​https://github.com/rsh249/cv19_enm/releases/tag/v0.0.2​). All analysis code was written
using R 3.6.2 ​(R Core Team, 2019)​. Plots for Figures 1, 2, 3, S1, and S2 produced using the
“ggplot2” package ​(Wickham, 2009)​.
Data acquisition
SARS-CoV-2 case data for US counties were collected from the New York Times
database ​(The New York Times, 2020)​ on March 31, 2020 for the March 30, 2020 data release.
County-level data on human population densities were acquired from the 2010 United States
Census through the R “tidycensus” package ​(Walker et al., 2020)​. Georeferencing to county
centers was performed by referencing county and state names in the GeoNames database
(​https://www.geonames.org/​). While exact virus case geolocations or even town-level data
would provide finer scale resolution to our analyses, these data are likely the best curated
dataset for the US at this time.
Climate data
Climate data averaged from 1970-2000 for the month of March were accessed through
the WorldClim v2.1 database ​(Fick & Hijmans, 2017)​. The seven climate parameters examined
were average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, average
precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed, and water vapor pressure (a measure related to
humidity). Climate values were extracted from these layers for each georeferenced county
record using the average from a 5km buffer around each county center coordinate. While county
centers may not be ideal in all circumstances, our view is that county centers plus this generous
buffer will average the climate relative to most cases in the area. WIthout high levels of

individual case and movement tracking, more precise georeferencing of viral transmission is not
currently possible.
Basic examinations
Data for SARS-CoV-2 cases and human population totals were each compared to the
seven abiotic variables listed above. Probability densities are calculated from occurrence and
corresponding climate data using a Gaussian Kernel Density Estimator and standard bandwidth.
Raw case data, total cases per county, were scaled to reflect virus cases in each county unit by
dividing total cases by the county population from the 2010 US Census. These population
scaled viral cases (cases / population) were used as probability density weightings, and
resulting curves were standardized to an area of one. Probability densities were also calculated
with raw case count data and county-level population as weightings. Probability density
estimation and visualization was done with the R ‘ggplot2’ package ​(Wickham, 2009)​. To test
whether the SARS-CoV-2 cases and human population data were correlated, we applied
Spearman tests “cor.test(method=’spearman’)”.
Species distribution models
Occurrence data for raw SDMs were generated by expanding each climate record by the
total SARS-CoV-2 case count for each county. Occurrence data for population scaled SDMs
were generated by expanding each record used in the probability density estimation such that
no county had fewer than one record [i.e., cases / population x 100,000 (the expansion factor for
our data)]. Maxent model parameters were tested by building a suite of SDMs using the
ENMeval package ​(Muscarella et al., 2014)​ for SARS-CoV-2 distribution data with occurrences
generated from raw reported virus case values and population scaled case values. Operational
models using the best model parameters (identified by minimizing AICc) were then built for
SARS-CoV-2 using all population scaled data, raw virus data, and for human density using the
county population data with the Maxent algorithm implemented in the “maxnet” R package
(Phillips, 2017)​. Of the seven WorldClim variables, the three temperature variables are clearly
linked. Accordingly, we only used maximum temperature, as higher temperatures have been
hypothesized to lower the viral distribution. Keeping all temperature variables made similar
models, but are not further reported on, as reducing correlated variables is generally preferable
(Araújo et al., 2019)​.

Given recent critiques, it has become clear that when using SDMs in relation to
SARS-CoV-2 it is worth documenting how close a study may come to the, in our opinion
somewhat asparational, gold standards for this type of modeling ​(Araújo et al., 2019)​. The mode
rank for our SDMs is bronze (​Table 1​), largely as data from an emerging disease are inherently
imperfect.
Niche overlap and similarity tests were conducted with the “ecospat” library
(Broennimann et al., 2012; Di Cola et al., 2017)​ to compare the climatic niche of SARS-CoV-2
and humans, as a significant overlap between these would indicate that the virus distribution is
not necessarily constrained by climate (i.e., that the full range of human occupied climate is
accessible to the virus).
Results
Basic examinations
The human population climate curves are visually similar compared to the population
scaled SARS-CoV-2 climate curves for all seven abiotic variables during the most recent record
in March (​Figure 1​). There do appear to be modest differences in the population scaled viral
curves towards cooler temperatures and lower water vapor pressure compared to the human
population curves. The raw density of SARS-CoV-2 cases (​Figure S1​) is visually different from
the population scaled data (​Figure 1​). Population scaled SARS-CoV-2 data appear to become
better fitted to the human population data over time (i.e., these curves better match on March 30
than they did on March 2 or 16, 2020; ​Figure 1​), whereas the raw SARS-CoV-2 case data
become more and more fixed on a narrow range of values for all climate variables (​Figure S1)​.
The latter (fixed and narrow) range presumably has to do with a few virus hotspots.
There is a highly significant positive relationship (Spearman’s ​r​ = 0.75, ​p <
​ 2e​-12​);
between the number of humans in a county and the number of viral cases; however, the
population scaled viral cases do not have a strong relationship (Spearman’s ​r​ = 0.05, ​p ​= 0.03)

with human populations (​Figure 2​). Although the latter ​p-​ value is significant, this is often not all
that meaningful for large datasets, whereas the weak ​r​ value better illustrates the relationship
for the population scaled data.
Species distribution models
SDMs for SARS-CoV-2 (population scaled cases) and human populations appear to be
highly similar, with areas of high suitability predicted for much of the west coast and most of the

eastern half of the US (​Figure 3​). There are some differences; for instance, the map for the
virus suggests Florida is less suitable than it is in the map for people. The SDM of the raw virus
cases (​Figure S2​) fails to reconstruct the known distribution of viral cases in much of the US,
and produces a divergent model from the population scaled model. The SDM for humans
(​Figure 3, S2​) does not exactly match current human distribution for the US. This was expected,
because the goal of the model is to match climates that are correlated with the places where
most people live (i.e., it is not simply a map of current human populations). We did this as our
ultimate goal was comparing a viral model to a human model.
The niche overlap and similarity tests both find that the models of SARS-CoV-2
(population scaled viral case data) and human population have significantly higher overlap (​p ​<
0.01) than would be expected by chance (​Figure 4​), confirming the visual similarities between
these maps. The raw data showed less overlap: The similarity test was significant, but an order
of magnitude less so than for the population scaled data (​p ​= 0.02), while the overlap test was
insignificant (​p =
​ 0.20), as seen in ​Figure S3​.
Discussion
Main findings
Our results suggest that population scaled SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus cases are highly
linked with the human populations in the US, and that any influence of climate is currently hard
to disentangle for SARS-CoV-2 cases in the US (​Figures 1-4​). Furthermore, this link is
strengthening over time (​Figure 1​). This indicates that caution should be used when dealing
with climate modeling of SARS-CoV-2, at least on a national scale. Our results, while broadly
similar to what was found in the US for global scale models ​(Araújo & Naimi, 2020; Bariotakis et
al., 2020)​, indicate that the pattern we observed is simply reflecting human population density.
Please note that an updated online version (​https://navaak.shinyapps.io/CVRisk/​; accessed
April 4, 2020) of the figure in one of these studies ​(Bariotakis et al., 2020)​ predicts a rather
different model from their original (e.g., low suitability for much of the US). Based on this, at
least some human-focused data (i.e., host data) should be compared or incorporated in any
modeling exercises for SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, the current global results from other studies
(Araújo & Naimi, 2020; Bariotakis et al., 2020)​ should not be taken at face value without a
critical comparison to human distributions.
It is also noteworthy that our models using the raw viral case data (​Figure S2)​ , as
opposed to population scaled data (​Figure 3​), performed poorly: the raw SDM did not highlight

most of the currently known range of SARS-CoV-2 in the US. Other SDM studies have only
used raw values as inputs ​(Araújo & Naimi, 2020; Bariotakis et al., 2020)​, which our model,
again, indicates should not be used. Similarly, our analysis of raw SARS-CoV-2 case data
shows that over time the probability density curves focus on a narrower range of climate as
more data comes from the areas most affected by the outbreak (​Figure S1)​ . In contrast,
adjusting for population size with the population scaling results in SARS-CoV-2 climate curves
more closely approaching that of the human population curves over time (​Figure 1)​ .
Furthermore, county-level human population numbers only appear to be a strong correlate to
raw cases, rather than population scaled cases (​Figure 2​). Together these observations
suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 is highly successful in a few areas at this point (e.g., New York
City), but when scaled for the available human population in each county we can infer a much
broader geographic and climatic range available.
Again, our data have a few indications that climate may have some relevance in
SARS-CoV-2 distributions. Viral probability densities are slightly higher in cooler locales (​Figure
1, S1​). The population scaled data are particularly compelling, even if the climate difference is
smaller, as they are less driven by the current SARS-CoV-2 hotspots. Furthermore, our
population scaled viral SDMs, while statistically identical to our human SDMs, have lower
suitability for the virus in Florida and the southwestern border (​Figure 3​). In reality, Florida
currently has a reasonably high number of viral cases.
Avoiding a presumably faulty prediction
Given that our SDMs for humans and the virus were statistically indistinguishable, we do
not believe that a future projection of our SARS-CoV-2 SDM in the US using only climate data
would be trustworthy at this point in time, and therefore do not present one. The model likely
would suggest the SARS-CoV-2 prevalence will shift northward during the summer, which would
be congruent with a recent global modeling study ​(Araújo & Naimi, 2020)​. However, given that
humans do not move northward in large numbers in the US during the summer, our predictions
would be based on faulty presumptions about host resources (i.e., that there are sufficient
humans in the north to harbor the bulk of cases). Still, it is possible that a future model
projection would turn out to be correct, and there could be at least some residual predictive
power that is not fully encompassed by human population patterns. It is our hope that as data
improve we, and others, may be able to increase our confidence in, or better refute, SDM-based
future projections and other climate-focused SARS-CoV-2 studies. Adding human population

density as an input layer in an SDM might be a straightforward way to avoid these issues and
produce a more trustworthy prediction.
Modeling counterarguments
It has now been argued that SDM modeling of SARS-CoV-2 can help to predict where
the virus may generally be found now and in the future ​(Araújo & Naimi, 2020; Bariotakis et al.,
2020)​, as well as why it might be a fool's errand to conduct these analyses in the first place
(Chipperfield et al., 2020)​. Here are some of the main arguments that have been put forward
against SARS-CoV-2 SDMs, followed by our opinion on the subject. 1) Issue: The virus is
spreading and the population is not in equilibrium with climate or any other putative niche
dimension. Our thoughts: It is not in equilibrium and that is imperfect; however, SDMs have
been useful for a number of non-equilibrium systems, like species invasions during their
spreading phase ​(Václavík & Meentemeyer, 2009)​, and waiting for equilibrium will mean
predictions are no longer as useful to conduct (i.e., would only be helpful for a next outbreak of
this virus). Furthermore, the rebuttal’s reanalysis of global virus cases (their Figure 2), in our
opinion, seemed to indicate there may already be some stability in global model projections
(Chipperfield et al., 2020)​; however, the rebuttal authors interpreted the relative model
differences to claim instability and, therefore, issues with reliability. 2) Issue: The virus may be
spreading heavily or underreported in the Global South. Our thoughts: Surely this is partially
true, but this may not completely explain observable climatic correlations. Even if we are
working with incomplete data, it is hard to know if adding those data will broadly change
conclusions based on preliminary models. Still, to mitigate this problem we focused on the more
consistent US-level data. 3) Issue: Papers must strive for best practices. Our thoughts: Yes, we
agree that best practices are indeed worth pursuing, even if not everyone agrees on what best
practices may be. We have done our best to achieve the somewhat aspirational standards that
have been put forth ​(Araújo et al., 2019)​. We explicitly document this, and summarize
shortcomings that are inherent with a newly spreading system (​Table 1​). 4) Issue: Caution
should be taken in claims and dissemination of research that could impact public health policy.
Our thoughts: Yes, caution is advisable in terms of studies on dire subjects like SARS-CoV-2;
however, cross pollination between disciplines has been important for many breakthroughs and
advances in science.

Caveats and unknowns
There are individual people who regularly go undetected for SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., those
who lack symptoms or have mild symptoms) — currently estimated at up to 25% ​(Mandavilli,
2020)​. This is of course an issue for all studies of SARS-CoV-2. Obviously it is not ideal for
modeling and forecasting; however, it is inherent in any study. In fact, we have far more data
available for SARS-CoV-2 than we will ever have for the vast majority of viruses and biodiversity
generally.
Our results are based on data for a single, large country. While taking global data points
would be ideal, we avoided these because they are known to be more problematic and
inconsistent ​(Chipperfield et al., 2020)​. While it may somewhat hobble our ability to forecast viral
distributions at other time points, as there are surely non-analogous weather systems to come
(i.e., no place in the US is currently as hot as Death Valley, California in full summer heat), we
feel it was a worthy trade-off. Policy, social factors, and a variety of other variables were not
included in this study, despite their obvious, known, or potential importance ​(Leung et al., 2020;
Maier & Brockmann, 2020; Miller et al., 2020)​; other variables such as wearing masks and prior
Bacillus Calmette-Guérin childhood vaccinations may be important for global patterns ​(Leung et
al., 2020; Maier & Brockmann, 2020; Miller et al., 2020)​. Unfortunately, data on these variables
are often lacking in public databases. Our goals were to focus on a rather macro scale, which
may be harder to do with policy data that can vary substantially from county to county, state to
state, and, for a global study, country to country. While policies in the US may not have fully
been implemented for long enough to tell, these changes (e.g., self isolation) will surely impact
models in upcoming days.
Data accessibility and mobilization
We believe the New York Times ​(The New York Times, 2020)​ providing robust
county-level data in an accessible repository with an open license for the US sets an excellent
standard that should be repeated by governments, academics, and other media organizations
for other parts of the world so that this type of study may be better repeated in any country or
globally. In a similar vein, we have made our analytical and modeling pipeline (along with
figures) available (​https://github.com/rsh249/cv19_enm/releases/tag/v0.0.2​). We believe it is
imperative for all pipelines and scripts to be made available for any SARS-CoV-2 research to
ensure that models can be improved upon and any errors can be more quickly uncovered and
resolved.

Future directions
There are many avenues to pursue regarding SARS-CoV-2 modeling and predictions.
We are excited to see researchers from a variety of fields extending their toolkits towards
understanding this virus. We hope that ecological studies like this and others can play a role
without overcomplicating the research efforts put forth by epidemiologists. Still, studies should
familiarize themselves with current critiques of SDMs for SARS-CoV-2 modeling and be
cautious of their inputs and conclusions.
With improving data, we feel that future studies should better be able to examine the
system globally while considering human populations and public policy efforts at curbing the
virus. We also believe that it will at some point in the US and elsewhere be worth examining
death rates in different areas, as it would be helpful to know if climate or other abiotic variables
might impact this heartbreaking statistic. Coupling regularly updated data with automated online
resources would also be particularly helpful in learning how this virus may spread.
Conclusions
At present, SDMs from SARS-CoV-2 population scaled cases do not appear to be
distinguishable from human population density. It may be too early to tell if climate will play a
significant role for this coronavirus in the US with warmer months approaching. Future studies
looking at climate’s impact on this virus should, wherever possible, take into account human
population density in any analyses.

A) Sampling: Bronze

Best data available; municipalities, local
governments, and states choose who to test.
Positive tests only reported.

B) Identification: Gold

Assuming best practices in testing and reporting.

C) Spatial accuracy:
Bronze

County assignments provide a rough georeference
for each record, but do not precisely describe where
transmission of the virus occurred. Spatial accuracy
unknown. Occurrences limited to identifiable county
level localities.

unlikely to adequately test environmental
boundaries.

E) Geographic extent:
Bronze

Study area to include current range in the US.

A) Selection of
candidates:
Bronze/Deficient

Unclear and not well documented correlations
between SARS-CoV-2 transmission and climate. At
best, distal variables with weak, indirect control on
the distribution.

B) Spatial and temporal
resolution: Deficient

Variables sampled from a 2.5 arcminute grid for all
cells within 5km of each occurrence point. Mean
value used for modeling. Monthly climate averages
as predictors for end of March occurrence data.

C) Uncertainty: Bronze

Temporal and spatial uncertainty in occurrence data
has unquantified potential effects on the model
output.

A) Model Complexity:
Silver

ENMeval for model testing and selection (AICc)
using internal cross validation through the block
resampling method.

B) Treatment of
response bias: Silver

Internal cross validation to evaluate bias effects in
different models.

C) Treatment of
collinearity: Bronze

“Approximate methods are applied” — Predictor
variables hand selected from monthly climate data
available to avoid collinearity (i.e., used only Tmax
and not Tavg or Tmin).
