Summary
Background: Elevated proinflammatory cytokines have been associated with 2019
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severity. We assessed efficacy and safety of sarilumab, an
interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor, in severe (requiring supplemental oxygen by nasal canula or
face mask) or critical (requiring greater supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or
extracorporeal support) COVID-19.
Methods: This was a 60-day, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational
trial in patients hospitalised with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and pneumonia, who required oxygen
supplementation or intensive care. Patients were randomised 2:2:1 to intravenous sarilumab
400 mg, sarilumab 200 mg, or placebo. The primary endpoint was time to ≥2-point clinical
improvement (7-point scale; range: 1 [death] to 7 [not hospitalised]). The key secondary

endpoint was proportion of patients alive at day 29. Safety outcomes included adverse events
and laboratory assessments. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04327388).
Findings: Between March 28 and July 3, 2020, 420 patients were randomised; 416 received
treatment (placebo, n=84; sarilumab 200 mg, n=159; sarilumab 400 mg, n=173). At day 29,
there were no significant differences in median (95% CI) time to ≥2-point improvement
between placebo (12ꞏ0 [9ꞏ0–15ꞏ0] days) and sarilumab groups (200 mg: 10ꞏ0 [9ꞏ0–12ꞏ0]
days, p=0.96, log-rank test; 400 mg: 10ꞏ0 [9ꞏ0–13ꞏ0] days, p=0.34) or in proportions of
patients alive (placebo, 91ꞏ7%; sarilumab 200 mg, 89ꞏ9%, p=0ꞏ63; sarilumab 400 mg,
91ꞏ9%, p=0ꞏ85). At day 29, there were numerical, nonsignificant survival differences
between sarilumab 400 mg (88%) and placebo (79%; difference +9%, 95% CI −7ꞏ7 to 25ꞏ5,
p=0ꞏ25) for critical patients. There were no unexpected safety signals.
Interpretation: This trial did not demonstrate efficacy of sarilumab in patients hospitalised
with COVID-19 and receiving supplemental oxygen. Adequately powered trials of targeted
immunomodulatory therapies assessing survival as a primary endpoint are suggested in
patients with critical COVID-19.

Introduction
The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in
December 2019 and the associated coronavirus disease (COVID-19)1 has resulted in ≥47
million confirmed infections and ≥1ꞏ2 million deaths worldwide as of November 4, 2020.
COVID-19-associated pneumonia can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS), estimated to affect 5–20% of patients with COVID-19.2-5 In some patients, COVID19 may cause damage to additional organs, including heart, brain, kidney, and liver.6 In the
first several months of the pandemic, there were no treatments with proven efficacy for
patients with severe or critical COVID-19; therefore, carefully designed randomised,
controlled trials of novel or repurposed medications were, and still are, warranted.

Literature to date supports an association of proinflammatory cytokines with acute, lifethreatening respiratory injury observed in patients with COVID-19.7 Among these cytokines,
interleukin (IL)-6 appears to play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related
ARDS.8 Results of a meta-analysis of laboratory findings indicate that 53% of patients with
COVID-19 have increased IL-6 levels.9 A meta-analysis of 23 clinical trials involving 3400
patients showed that patients with severe COVID-19 had higher levels of IL-6 than those
with mild disease, and even higher levels were observed in patients who died.10 Two
additional meta-analyses11,12 and a large, prospective cohort study of patients hospitalised
with COVID-1913 also demonstrated an association between elevated IL-6 and COVID-19related mortality. Many of these findings were first published during the early months of the
pandemic, suggesting that inhibition of IL-6 signaling may have value as a treatment to
manage inflammatory manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia.

Sarilumab is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the binding of IL-6 to its α receptor
and is approved for treatment of adults with moderate to severely active rheumatoid
arthritis.14,15 Because sarilumab inhibits both soluble and membrane-bound forms of IL-6
receptors,14,16 potentially suppressing proinflammatory signaling by both pulmonary
epithelial and immune cells,8 we hypothesised it could reduce the severity of pulmonary
complications of COVID-19, including respiratory failure. Here, we report results of a 60day, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of sarilumab in hospitalised patients with severe to
critical COVID-19.

Methods
Study design
This study was an adaptive, phase 2/3, multicentre, randomised, double-blinded trial. Because
of the uncertainties of assessing treatment efficacy in COVID-19 pneumonia at the time of
study design, the initial protocol allowed adaptations such as modification of the provisional
phase 3 endpoints, sample size re-estimation before entering phase 3, or closing a dose group
while the study remained blinded. Patients were assessed daily while hospitalised until
discharge, or death, with a final follow-up on day 60.

The trial was monitored by an external independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) with
ongoing access to unblinded clinical data. The protocol was approved by the institutional
review boards at each participating hospital and by national ethics committees, as required by
local and national regulations. The study was carried out in accordance with the International
Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the World Medical
Association’s Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments.17

Patients
This study enrolled patients aged 18 years or older at the time of signing informed consent
who had been hospitalised for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in any specimen
within 2 weeks prior to randomisation and with evidence of pneumonia by chest imaging or
chest auscultation and no alternative explanation for current clinical presentation. Patients
also had to meet criteria for severe disease (defined as administration of supplemental oxygen
by nasal cannula, simple face mask, or another similar device) or critical disease (defined as
need for supplemental oxygen delivered by nonrebreather mask or high-flow nasal cannula,
use of invasive or noninvasive ventilation, or treatment in an intensive care unit). Before
participating in the trial, informed consent was obtained from all patients or their legally
authorised/appointed representatives, as specified by local law and in compliance with or
exceeding ethics committee requirements.

Patients were excluded from the study if they had at least one of the following: in the
investigator’s opinion, a low probability of surviving 48 hours or remaining at the
investigational site beyond 48 hours, or dysfunction of ≥2 organ systems or need for
extracorporeal life support or renal replacement therapy at screening; absolute neutrophil
count <2000/mm3; aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) exceeding
5-fold upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening; platelets <50,000/mm3 at screening; known
active, incompletely treated, suspected or known extrapulmonary tuberculosis; prior or
concurrent use of immunosuppressants at screening, including, but not limited to, IL-6
inhibitors or Janus kinase inhibitors within 30 days of baseline; anti-CD20 agents without
evidence of B-cell recovery to baseline levels or IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) within 1
week of baseline; abatacept within 8 weeks of baseline; tumor necrosis factor α inhibitors
within 2–8 weeks of baseline; alkylating agents, including cyclophosphamide, within 6

months of baseline; cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, leflunomide, or
methotrexate within 4 weeks of baseline; or intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin within 5
months of baseline; use of systemic chronic (eg, oral) corticosteroids for a condition not
related to COVID-19 at doses higher than prednisone 10 mg/day or equivalent at screening;
or suspected or known active systemic bacterial or fungal infections within 4 weeks of
screening.

Randomisation and masking
Eligible patients were randomised (2:2:1) to IV sarilumab 400 mg, sarilumab 200 mg, or
placebo according to a central randomisation scheme using permuted blocks of 5 and
implemented through an interactive response technology (IRT). Randomisation was stratified
by severity of illness (severe or critical) and use of systemic corticosteroids (yes or no).
Patients and investigators remained blinded to patients’ assigned intervention throughout the
course of the study. An unblinded pharmacist was responsible for the preparation and
dispensation of all study interventions.

Procedures
Sarilumab 400 mg, sarilumab 200 mg, or placebo were prepared according to instructions
provided in the pharmacy manual. After confirming the randomisation number accessed via
IRT, the hospital pharmacist added the contents of prefilled syringes (PFS) of sarilumab 200
mg solution for subcutaneous injection supplied by the sponsor into a specified volume of
locally sourced 0ꞏ9% NaCl solution for IV infusion (two syringes for the 400-mg dose, one
syringe for the 200-mg dose, and 0ꞏ9% NaCl solution for the placebo dose) to produce an IV
bag containing a colourless solution to be administered by blinded hospital staff as a single
IV infusion. Patients could have the IV infusion stopped for a safety-related issue, in which

case they did not continue with dosing. An option for a second dose existed (within the
assigned treatment arm) within 24–48 hours of the first dose, based on the investigator’s
benefit-risk assessment (Amended protocol 02; April 8, 2020).

Clinical and laboratory monitoring
Efficacy assessments included a daily assessment of clinical status until discharge, body
temperature (day 1–3: four times a day; day 4–29: twice a day), oxygen administration (day
1–3: four times a day; day 4–29: results recorded as assessed), resting oxygen saturation
(SpO2; day 1–3: four times a day; day 4–29: results recorded as assessed), and National Early
Warning Score 2 (NEWS2).18 Safety procedures and assessments included clinical laboratory
testing (performed locally at each hospital), targeted physical examination, and concomitant
medication review. Vital signs were recorded daily until discharge. Surveillance testing for
bacterial and fungal infection was performed locally, on days 7 and 15. In addition to the
positive SARS-CoV-2 result required for inclusion, nasopharyngeal (when feasible) and
blood samples were collected at baseline and on days 7, 15, 21, and 29, or on the day of
hospital discharge and analysed by the local laboratories and a central laboratory,
respectively. Serum IL-6 and other biomarkers were analysed in a central laboratory. Blood
samples were also taken for measurement of sarilumab concentration. Other than central
laboratory results, all clinical data were entered by investigators at each site into an electronic
clinical research form (eCRF) and validated remotely by the sponsor’s monitoring team.

Outcomes
The primary efficacy endpoint was time from baseline to clinical improvement of ≥2 points
on a 7-point ordinal scale, with numerical values defined as follows: 1—Death; 2—
Hospitalised, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation;

3—Hospitalised, on noninvasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen devices; 4—Hospitalised,
requiring supplemental oxygen; 5—Hospitalised, not requiring supplemental oxygen –
requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise); 6—Hospitalised, not
requiring supplemental oxygen – no longer requiring ongoing medical care; 7—Not
hospitalised. Discharge prior to day 29 was considered as a 2-point improvement. The key
secondary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients alive at day 29.

The original phase 2 primary endpoint was the time to resolution of fever for at least 48 hours
without antipyretics or until discharge (original protocol; March 18, 2020). However, the
unanticipated rapid rate of enrolment made the plan to use the phase 2 analysis to select phase
3 efficacy endpoints unfeasible. As a result, the primary and key secondary endpoints for
phase 3, as described above, were adopted a priori in the Amended protocol 04 (April 8,
2020).

Other secondary efficacy endpoints included differences in time-to-event endpoints by
treatment (eg, time to improvement of ≥1 point on the 7-point scale, fever resolution, or
discharge from hospital), score changes at specific time points (eg, proportion with 1-point
improvement/worsening), and event durations (eg, mechanical ventilation, hospitalisation).

Safety was assessed by investigator reports of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, AEs of
special interest (infusion-related reactions; hypersensitivity reactions; absolute neutrophil
count <500/mm3 with or without concurrent invasive infection; increase in ALT of at least 3fold ULN or in excess of 3-fold ULN and at least 2-fold over the baseline level; invasive
bacterial or fungal infections of clinical significance with confirmed diagnosis based on the
investigator’s assessment with appropriate diagnostic workups and consultations;

symptomatic overdose),19 and clinical laboratory parameters including lymphocyte count,
neutrophil count, and ALT on days 1, 4, 7, 15, 21, and 29 (if still hospitalised).

Statistical analysis
This study addressed the null hypothesis of no difference in time to ≥2-point improvement on
the 7-point scale between a sarilumab dose group and placebo. In sample size determination,
approximately 400 patients, randomised 2:2:1, were estimated to provide ≥90% power for
pairwise comparison between each sarilumab dose (approximately 160 patients each) and
placebo (approximately 80 patients) using a log-rank test of superiority at a two-sided
significance level of 0ꞏ05. Assumptions included accrual duration of 3 months, each patient
being followed up for ≥29 days, and proportions of patients with 2-point improvement at day
15 being 45% for placebo and 70% for sarilumab.

The modified intention-to-treat (mITT) and safety populations included all randomised
patients treated with study medication. Primary analysis was planned at day 29 and final
analysis at day 60. Analysis of the primary endpoint (mITT) involved a stratified log-rank
test with treatment as a fixed factor. Estimation of treatment effect was provided as hazard
ratio (HR), generated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model with treatment as a
covariate. Patients without improvement were censored at the last observation time point;
patients who took rescue medication in the study without prior improvement were censored at
rescue medication start date. Patients who died were deemed no improvement starting from
death date. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed by visual inspection of the plot
of log(–log(survival)) versus log(survival time) to determine whether curves were parallel
among treatments. Analysis of the key secondary endpoint (mITT) involved a CochranMantel-Haenszel test, with estimation of treatment effect reported as the difference in

percentage of patients alive at day 29 (sarilumab − placebo). An administrative interim
analysis was prespecified for a point in time when approximately 50% of total planned
patients (approximately 200) reached day 15. Multiplicity was addressed for the primary and
key secondary endpoints for the primary analysis at day 29, by means of hierarchical testing
(1. Primary endpoint sarilumab 400 mg vs placebo; 2. Key secondary endpoint sarilumab 400
mg vs placebo; 3. Primary endpoint sarilumab 200 mg vs placebo; 4. Key secondary endpoint
sarilumab 200 mg vs placebo).

Role of the funding source
The study sponsor designed the study and was responsible for data collection, data analysis,
and data interpretation. All authors, including those affiliated with the study sponsor,
contributed to writing the manuscript, and reviewed and approved the manuscript. The
authors had full access to all data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to
submit for publication. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2020-001162-12),
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04327388), and WHO (U1111-1249-6021).

Amendments made to the original protocol
In total, four amendments were made to the original protocol. Amended protocol 01 (March
26, 2020) implemented clarifications to the original version. Amended protocol 02 (April 8,
2020) implemented changes from phase 2 primary and key secondary endpoints to the phase
3 primary and key secondary endpoints and added an option for a second dose. Amended
protocol 03 (April 29, 2020) added an interim analysis when approximately 50% of the total
planned number of patients reached day 15, for review by the IDMC and unblinded
representatives of sponsor’s senior management, who were not involved in study conduct;
clarified the extent to which the sponsor could adapt the study following review of an interim

(June 11, 2020) closed enrolment into the 200-mg arm following senior management review
of interim results and subsequent confirmation by IDMC review, which favoured the 400-mg
arm.

Results
The first patient was screened on March 28, 2020, and the last patient was randomised on
July 3, 2020. Last patient – last visit was on September 2, 2020. The study was conducted at
45 sites in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Russia,
and Spain (table S1). Of 431 patients who were screened, 420 were randomised and 416
received treatment (placebo, n=84; sarilumab 200 mg, n=159; sarilumab 400 mg, n=173)
(figure 1).

Baseline demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were overall similar among the
treatment groups, with exceptions including sex distribution, ferritin concentration, and
proportions of patients with fever and obesity (table 1). Median age was 59ꞏ0 years
(interquartile range [IQR] 50ꞏ0–68ꞏ0 years) and 37% of participants were women. According
to investigator-reported severity, 61% had severe disease and 39% had critical disease. Two
(0ꞏ5%) patients randomised into the severe disease stratum were recorded in the eCRF as
having multisystem organ dysfunction because they required renal replacement therapy.
Fever was reported in 52% of patients. Median duration of hospitalisation before dosing was
3ꞏ0 days (IQR 2ꞏ0–4ꞏ0 days). Use of systemic corticosteroids (including dexamethasone),
antiviral medications, antibacterial medications (including azithromycin), and
hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine prior to, prior to and during, and after first infusion of study
medication did not differ substantially across treatment arms (table S2).

For the primary endpoint of time to improvement of ≥2 points on a 7-point clinical
assessment scale, no significant difference was observed between sarilumab doses and
placebo up to day 29 (figure 2). Although the between-group differences were not significant,
median time to improvement was 2 days longer in the placebo group compared with the
sarilumab groups (12 days vs 10 days) (table 2). In addition, no significant differences were
observed in the proportions of patients alive at day 29 (placebo, 91ꞏ7%; sarilumab 200 mg,
89ꞏ9%; sarilumab 400 mg, 91ꞏ9%) (table 2).

The proportions of patients discharged due to recovery by day 29 were 83ꞏ3% (placebo),
79ꞏ2% (sarilumab 200 mg), and 79ꞏ2% (sarilumab 400 mg) and the percentages of patients
alive at day 60 were 89ꞏ3%, 89ꞏ3%, and 89ꞏ6%, respectively (table S3). Additional secondary
endpoints related to fever, oxygenation, and hospital status are presented in the
supplementary materials (table S3).

Prespecified analysis of day 29 data showed a numerical but nonsignificant difference in
survival between sarilumab 400 mg (88%) and placebo (79%; difference +9%, 95% CI −7ꞏ7
to 25ꞏ5, p=0ꞏ25) for the sickest patients in this trial, those with critical disease (table 2).

In patients with either severe or critical disease, differences between sarilumab 400 mg and
placebo on the 7-point clinical status scale were larger during the first 2 weeks of treatment
than during the second 2 weeks (figure 2). The time-concentration plot of sarilumab
concentration following IV infusion showed an initially rapid decline over the first 4 days and
a slower decline from day 7 onward, with nearly complete elimination by day 21 even among
patients who received two doses of 400 mg within the first 48 hours (figure S2A).

Changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil counts were considered
pharmacodynamic markers of systemic IL-6 signaling inhibition. The decline in mean CRP
was steeper in the sarilumab arms than in the placebo arm, with a rebound at day 7 in the
200-mg arm and day 15 in the 400-mg arm (figure S2B). As expected with IL-6 receptor
inhibition, neutrophil counts were decreased in the sarilumab arms and lower for a longer
period of time with the 400-mg dose than the 200-mg dose, but again appeared to increase
after day 4 in the 200-mg arm and after day 15 in the 400-mg arm. In the placebo arm,
neutrophil counts were stable through day 7 but were higher at day 15 (figure S2E).
Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios (figure S2F) and D-dimer (figure S2G) concentrations did not
appear to be influenced by sarilumab concentration, and mean ALT elevation only appeared
higher than placebo in the sarilumab arms at day 7 (figure S2H). The concentration-time plots
for IL-6 (figure S2C) and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) (figure S2D) were consistent with
what has been previously reported for sarilumab following subcutaneous injection.20 Mean
sIL-6R concentration in the placebo arm remained low up to day 29.

The rates of treatment-emergent AEs, infections (including serious infections), and treatmentemergent AEs leading to death were similar among the treatment groups (table 3). In
sarilumab-treated patients, the types of AEs of special interest were generally consistent with
the established safety profile of sarilumab and the IV route of administration and occurred
more frequently than in the placebo group.

Because standards of care for hospitalised patients with COVID-19 evolved over the course
of the trial, in a post hoc analysis the proportions of patients initiating or continuing selected
medications were plotted by week of study conduct (figure S3). Use of systemic

corticosteroids appeared to wane during the first 6 weeks of study conduct, then increased to
a peak usage in 70% of patients 13 weeks after the first randomised patient started receiving a
corticosteroid (figure S3A). This uptick in corticosteroid usage coincided with increased
enrolment of patients with critical disease. Over the course of the study, initiation of systemic
corticosteroids did not appear to be related to treatment arm (figure S3A). Use of antiviral
medications (figure S3C), hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (figure S3D), and combinations
(figure S4) declined over the course of the trial. For the medications of interest, changes in
background therapy appeared balanced across the treatment arms. In subgroup analyses (not
presented), no significant interactions between use of systemic corticosteroids, antiviral
medications, antibiotic medications, or hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine and time to clinical
improvement ≥2 points or survival at day 29 were identified. Only two patients each were
treated with remdesivir or convalescent plasma during the trial.

Discussion
In this multinational, randomised, placebo-controlled study of patients with severe or critical
COVID-19 who were receiving the local standard of care, there was no demonstrated benefit
of IV sarilumab over placebo. The treatment groups had similar rates of serious infections
and AEs leading to death, and types of AEs were consistent with prior clinical trial
experience with sarilumab.15 No new safety signals for sarilumab were observed in these
patients with COVID-19.

There are several potential reasons sarilumab was not effective as a treatment for COVID-19
in this clinical trial. First, IL-6 suppression alone may be insufficient to quell the
inflammatory phase of the disease.21 Open-label studies in patients with COVID-19
suggested clinical improvement with tocilizumab, another IL-6 inhibitor.20,22,23 However, in

recently published randomized trials, which also included patients hospitalised with COVID19 pneumonia, but on average less severely affected than ours,24-26 tocilizumab failed to
reduce disease severity at day 4 or mortality at day 28,24 a clinical worsening at day 14,25 or
time to intubation or death.26

Second, we did not select patients based on commonly available biological and clinical
markers of inflammation (eg, elevated CRP) or worsening prognosis (eg, neutrophil counts or
uncontrollable fever); consequently, we may not have included a sufficient number of
patients for whom immunomodulatory therapy would have been appropriate. Additionally,
we may not have chosen an optimal time in the disease course of COVID-19 to administer
sarilumab.

Third, immunomodulation may only be beneficial for the most serious cases of COVID-19.
Results of a large, open-label, controlled trial of dexamethasone (n=2104) versus usual care
(n=4321) for hospitalised patients with COVID-19 suggest the magnitude of survival benefit
is related to intensity of respiratory support.27 In our study, a numerical difference in survival
favouring sarilumab was only seen in the patients who required intensive respiratory support
(oxygen by nonrebreather mask or high-flow nasal cannula, use of invasive or noninvasive
ventilation), or treatment in an intensive care unit. The differences in treatment response
between patients with severe disease and critical disease may be qualitatively reflected in the
different evolution of clinical status over the course of the trial; ie, earlier improvement in the
sarilumab arms among severely ill patients up to day 15, and greater proportions of patients
surviving after day 15 among critically ill patients (figure 3). Kaplan-Meier time-to-event
curves up to day 60 also suggest more rapid improvement and earlier discharge due to
improvement in the sarilumab arms than the placebo arm among the patients with severe

disease; and higher probability of survival among sarilumab-treated patients than placebotreated in the critically ill group (table 2, figure S1).

Fourth, frequent use of systemic corticosteroids may have reduced the differences between
the investigational treatment and the placebo control arms. Over 60% of patients in the trial
received at least one dose of systemic corticosteroids before, during, and/or after infusion of
the study medication (table S2) and the frequency of systemic corticosteroid varied during the
conduct of the study (figure S3).

Fifth, this study may have been underpowered. Significant efficacy results for remdesivir
compared with placebo required 1062 patients to show a difference in median recovery time
of 5 days28 and >1000 patients to show a 1-day difference in median time to recovery of
baricitinib on top of remdesivir.29

Sixth, a single IV administration of sarilumab 400 mg may be insufficient to control the
inflammatory phase of COVID-19 beyond 14 days, as suggested by the reduction in
sarilumab concentration between day 7 and day 14 and subsequent rebound in CRP
concentration and neutrophil counts after day 15. Alternatively, the IV route of
administration, although theoretically advantageous, may not have resulted in a timeconcentration profile suited for COVID-19.

Lastly, the efficacy endpoints chosen may have been insufficiently sensitive for the wide
range of patients included in the trial. Additionally, an ordinal clinical status scale based on
intensity of respiratory support may be too crude to measure treatment effects in patients with
an acute systemic disease involving multiple organ systems.

Despite these limitations, survival at day 29 was possibly higher by 9% in the sarilumab
arms than in the placebo arm for patients who required noninvasive or invasive mechanical
ventilation or ECMO at baseline. Therefore, we think the results of this study do not exclude
the possibility of a benefit from targeted immunomodulation in hospitalised patients with
COVID-19 pneumonia with critical illness and suggest that subsequent randomised trials of
targeted immunomodulatory therapies in this disease focus on critically ill patients and are
adequately powered to assess survival as a primary endpoint.

*Analyses for “All patients” were stratified by severity of illness (severe, critical) and use of systemic corticosteroids as entered in IRT.
†For analyses of severe and critical disease the category was based on severity entered by the investigator in the eCRF and the stratification
factor for disease severity was removed from the model.
‡Severe disease was defined by supplemental oxygen administration by nasal cannula, simple face mask, or another similar device.
§Critical disease was defined by one of the following criteria: supplemental oxygen delivered by nonrebreather mask or high-flow nasal
cannula, use of invasive or noninvasive ventilation, or treatment in an ICU.
¶Patients without improvement were censored at the last observation time point; patients who took rescue medication in the study without
prior improvement were censored at rescue medication start date; patients who died were categorised as no improvement, starting from death
date.
