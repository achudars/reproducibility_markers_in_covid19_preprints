Highlight
The global outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2) has been declared a pandemic by the WHO. As the number of imported SARS-CoV2 cases is on the rise in Brazil, we use incidence and historical air travel data to estimate the
most important routes of importation into the country.

Main Text
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) was first detected in Wuhan,
Hubei province, China, on December 8th 2019. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) and can lead to acute respiratory syndrome, hospitalization and death.1
As of the 12th March 2020, the global SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been declared a pandemic,
with 125,048 cases and 4,613 deaths have been notified by the World Health Organization
(WHO) in 117 countries/territories or areas worldwide (who.int/emergencies/diseases/novelcoronavirus-2019/situation-reports). The first case in Latin America was confirmed on
February 26, 2020, in the São Paulo metropolis, the most populous city in the Southern
hemisphere (~11 million people Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística,
www.ibge.gov.br). Self-declared travel history and subsequent genetic analyses confirmed
that this infection was acquired via importation of the virus from Northern Italy2. Since then
Brazil has reported the largest number of cases in Latin America (n=34, as of March 10,
2020). SARS-CoV-2 has been now detected in 7 (26%) of the 27 federal states of Brazil. So
far, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be primarily sporadic (85.3%, 29/34 are
imported cases). Here, we analyse data on airline travellers to Brazil in 2019, who departed
from countries that had reported local cases of COVID-19 transmission by March 5th 2020.

This information provides insights into which Brazilian cities are most at risk for SARSCoV-2 importation.

We used travel data on all air journeys that had a Brazilian city as their final destination
during February and March 2019 as a proxy for flight density during the 2020 COVID-2019
outbreak (see Supplementary Material). We focused on the data for 29 countries that had
reported SARS-CoV-2 cases by 5th March 2020. We collated the total number of passengers
flying to any Brazilian airport during this period, country population size for 2019 from the
United Nations World Population Prospects 2019 database, and the WHO-reported number
of COVID-19 cases (as of March 5th, 2020). We used these values to estimate the proportion
of infected travellers potentially arriving in Brazilian cities from each country and for each
route (additional information can be found in Supplementary Material). No air passenger data
from Iran to Brazil was available for our analysis.

Between February and March 2019, Brazil received 841,302 international passengers in a
total of 84 cities across the country (Figure 1). São Paulo, the largest city in the country, was
the final destination of nearly half (46.1%) of the passengers arriving to Brazil, followed by
Rio de Janeiro (21%) and Belo Horizonte (4.1%). More than half of the international
passengers started they journey in the USA (50.8%) followed by France (7.9%) and Italy
(7.5%). The air-travel routes to airports in Brazil with most passengers were USA-São Paulo
(23.3%), USA-Rio de Janeiro (9.8%) and Italy-São Paulo (3.4%).

Figure 1. Potential for COVID-19 importation to Brazil. A) Map of Brazilian federal states
and Federal District coloured according to COVID-19 notification status (as of March 10,
2020). Circles correspond to the estimated proportion of arrivals from the top 29 destinations
(except Iran) that had reported local COVID-19 by 5th March 2020. B) Percentage of
passengers for the top-20 routes to Brazilian airports from countries that had reported
COVID-19 cases by the 5th March 2020. C) Estimated percentage of importations for the top20 routes from countries that had reported local COVID-19 by the 5th March 2020.

To better understand the potential for SARS-CoV-2 introductions to Brazil, we estimate the
relative risk of COVID-19 introduction to Brazilian cities by taking into account SARS-CoV2 incidence per international traveller arriving at an airport in Brazil. We estimate that 54.8%
of all imported cases would be expected to come from travellers infected in Italy, 9.3% and
8.3% of the cases would be from travellers infected in China and France, respectively. The
route Italy-São Paulo was estimated to comprise 24.9% of total infected travellers travelling

to Brazil during this period. Moreover, we estimate that Italy has been the source location for
five of the top 10 most importation routes for infected travellers into Brazil based on the
current epidemiological scenario (Supplementary Information). Consistent with this, at least
48% (n=14/29) of the reported imported cases in Brazil have a history of travelling to Italy
prior to onset of symptoms, as of 9th March 2020. Six (23.1%) of the confirmed cases that
acquired the virus in Italy have been identified in São Paulo (Supplementary Information).

We find that the proportion of estimated imported cases by airport of destination is highly
correlated with the proportion of detected imported cases. Our study has several limitations.
Unfortunately, data from Iran was not available for this analysis. Moreover, our analysis
relies on incidence data, and thus the risk of importation will follow changes in epidemic
sizes at source locations. In fact, with the reduction in the number of flights leaving from
Italy and 51% of flights to Brazil depart from airports in the USA, we should anticipate for an
increasing proportion of infected travellers arriving from the USA. Moreover, the estimated
risk of importation from China is likely an overestimate as recent measures have extensively
decreased the flights to Brazil.

At a time when the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases are steadily growing in Brazil, our
findings highlight the high potential for the introduction of new cases in several cities of
Brazil, especially in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro metropolises. Rapid identification of
locations where clusters of local transmission might first ignite is critical to better coordinate
preparedness, readiness and response actions.3,4 There is critical need for epidemiological,
human mobility and genetic data5 to understand virus transmission dynamics at local,
regional and global scales. Continued integration of these data streams should help guide
deployment of resources to mitigate COVID-19 transmission.
