Abstract
Background: Respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have
been associated with increased risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the mechanisms and
putative immune pathways are unclear. Besides, increased levels of several immune mediators in
patients with severe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) have been reported.
Objective: To perform an immunoproteomic profiling of dysregulated plasma proteins in patients
with asthma and COPD and to evaluate their relationship with biomarkers of severe COVID-19.
Methods: 92 protein biomarkers were quantified in 315 plasma samples from adult subjects (age
40-90 years) including 118 asthmatics, 99 COPD patients and 98 healthy controls, that have been
recruited in two reference pneumology clinics in Colombia before the beginning of the COVID-19
pandemic.
Results: Forty-one plasma proteins showed differences between patients and controls. Asthmatic
patients have increased levels in IL-6 and CCL3 while COPD patients have a broader systemic
inflammatory dysregulation driven by HGF, OPG, and several chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10,

CXCL11, CX3CL1, CXCL1, MCP-3, MCP-4, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL11). Functional annotation
revealed their enrichment in chemokine signaling pathways related with response to viral infections.
Some of these proteins were found up-regulated upon SARS-Cov-2 infection of Calu-3 cells. Also,
HPG, CXCL9, CXCL10, IL-6, MCP-3, TNF and EN-RAGE have been found increased in patients
with severe COVID-19. HGF, the most significant protein in this study as well as its correlated
proteins could be associated with the increased risk of severe COVID-19 in COPD patients.
Conclusions: Asthma and COPD patients have altered plasma levels of proteins that have been
found associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19. The reasons for sharing these profiles
with this infection are unknown, but our study suggest that adult patients with asthma and COPD
have a systemic dysregulation in chemokine networks that could make them more susceptible to
severe COVID-19.

Introduction
During the COVID-19 pandemic, populations at risk of severe symptoms have been detected
including patients with asthma and COPD [1]. An analysis of comorbidities in 1,590 COVID-19
patients across China found that COPD patients had a higher risk for intense care unit (ICU)
admission, mechanical ventilation, or death, even after adjustment for age and smoking [2]. A
recent meta-analysis has reported that COPD is associated with a significant, over fivefold, risk of
severe COVID 19 [3]. The risk has been attributed to the overexpression of angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor in bronchial epithelial cells from COPD patients [4] and by the
increased expression of the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) induced by the exposure
to cigarette smoking [5]. A recent study also shows that patients with chronic lung disease
(including COPD) have baseline changes in cell-type specific expression of genes related to viral
replication and the immune response, that could promote immune exhaustion and altered
inflammatory gene expression [6], supporting the increased risk in COPD patients. However, the
mechanisms remain to be elucidated. On the other hand, it has been found that patients with asthma
have increased risk of severe COVID-19 [7]. Also, that severe asthma is associated with COVID-19
related death [8] and asthmatic patients show increased expression of the viral activator TMPRSS2
[9]. Although there is still controversy on whether asthmatics are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2
infection [10], it is being recognized that endotype, exposome or the presence of other
comorbidities may increase risk to severe COVID-19 [11, 12].
As part of our research to identify biological markers for asthma and COPD, we conformed in 2018
the “Identification of Biomarkers in Asthma and COPD cohort (IBACO)” in two pneumology
centres in Colombia and collected plasma for biomarker discovery aiming to identify biomarkers
that can reveal mechanistical pathways in these diseases, especially to define endotypes of asthma
and COPD. Plasma profiling is a useful tool that can reflect systemic inflammatory status including
lung tissues [13-16]. We here implemented the multiplexed measurement of 92 plasma proteins
based on the proximity ligation assay to provide a comprehensive overview of protein levels in the
same sample at the same time [17, 18].
Likewise, there is a growing interest in identifying protein biomarkers of severe COVID-19 that
may allow to profile high risk patients for early management and to define point-of-care clinical
classifiers [19-21]. Several cohorts worldwide have reported significant changes in protein
biomarkers in patients with COVID-19. Initial studies reported molecules that are indicative of
inflammation (such as C reactive protein) or changes in cell proportions (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte
ratio, NLR) [22, 23], but more recent studies are focused on elucidating pathways underlying
patient severity with detailed profiles of plasma molecules such as cytokines, chemokines and
growth factors[21, 24-26]. For instance, Messner et al., identified 27 proteins in the blood of
COVID-19 patients that were present at different levels depending on the severity of their
symptoms including complement factors, the coagulation system, inflammation modulators, and
pro-inflammatory factors upstream and downstream interleukin 6 [27]. In addition, Arunachalam et
al., identified a linear increase in the protein levels of MCP-3, TNF, EN-RAGE and TNFSF14,
being highest in patients with severe disease and ICU admission [24]. During the analyses of the
plasma profiling in the participants of the IBACO cohort, we found that COPD patients show
increased levels of several immune proteins that have been reported as upregulated in patients with
severe COVID-19 infection. Here we present these proteins and apply induced network analysis to
evaluate their functional relationships, trying to understand how their dysregulation influences the
susceptibility to severe COVID-19.

Materials and Methods
Study participants
The plasma samples were obtained from the “Identification of Biomarkers in Asthma and COPD
cohort (IBACO)”, aimed to identify biomarkers of chronic respiratory diseases in Colombia.
Patients were recruited from two reference pneumology clinics of Cartagena and Bogotá. The study
was approved by the ethical committees of the University of Cartagena (nr. 4169722017) and the
“Fundación Neumológica Colombiana” (nr. 232-07122017) and written informed consent was
obtained from all participants. The study included a well characterized group of adult subjects aged
40 to 90 years with asthma (n=118) or COPD (n=99) recruited between February 2018 and March
2020, before the first case of SARS-Cov2 infection was reported in the country. Healthy controls
(n=99) were recruited during the same period in elderly homes and in the communities with a
similar age and gender distribution. At the time of sampling all subjects were queried about their
current and past sociodemographic characteristics, symptoms, comorbidities, smoking habits,
environmental exposures, history of allergies, pharmacological treatments, and received a physical
examination and pulmonary function tests. The diagnosis was done by a pulmonologist according to
the GEMA guidelines for asthma [28] and to the GesEPOC guidelines for COPD [29]. Pulmonary
function test was done by spirometry pre- and post-bronchodilator according to the American
Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. Quality of life was assessed by the asthma control questionnaire
(ACQ-5), the COPD Assessment Test (CAT), and the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire
(SGRQ). Comorbidities were evaluated by the Charlson comorbidity index [30]. Inclusion criteria
were no exacerbation in the last eight weeks, age 40 or more, with a clinical diagnosis of asthma or
COPD confirmed by a pneumologist and signed informed consent. For COPD patients additional
inclusion criteria were a reported exposure to wood smoke for at least 10 years and/or cigarette
smoking with more than 10 packs/year. Exclusion criteria included exacerbation of asthma or
COPD in the last 8 weeks, presence of uncontrolled comorbidities such as hypertension, coronary
disease, hepatic and/or renal diseases, active neoplastic disease, treatment with immunosuppressive
drugs, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, report of respiratory or non-respiratory
infection in the last 8 weeks and/or being under treatment with monoclonal antibodies.
Sample collection
Blood samples were collected by standard phlebotomy in heparinized tubes and plasma was
separated by centrifuging at 1000 g at 4°C for 15 minutes and stored at -80°C until analysis.
Another sample was collected in an EDTA tube to measure leukocyte cell counts by type IV
hemocytometry. IgE antibodies were measured by ImmunoCAP following manufacturer
instructions (Thermo Fisher, Uppsala, Sweden).
Quantification of plasma proteins
For plasma profiling the samples were randomly distributed in 96-well plates and protein levels
were measured by the Proximity Extension Assay (PEA) [18] using the Target 96 Inflammation
Panel (Olink Proteomics, Analysis Service Facility, Boston, USA) which includes a broad selection
of proteins established as inflammatory signatures in diverse inflammatory diseases. A total of 67
out of 92 plasma molecules were detected in heparinized plasma (73%). Normalized Protein Levels
were expressed as NPX units (log2 scale). Intraassay and interassay average coefficient of variations
(%CV) were 6% and 11%, respectively. Nine samples were removed because they did not pass the

quality control (QC). Twenty-five proteins had values below the limit of detection (LOD) and were
removed from analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Differences between protein levels among the study groups (asthma, COPD and healthy controls)
were first screened by the F-test (ANOVA) using the Olink Insights Stat Analysis Web tool
(https://olinkproteomics.shinyapps.io/OlinkInsightsStatAnalysis/) and by the non-parametric
Kruskal Wallis test. Given that some of the proteins with significant differences between groups did
not have a normal distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), we implemented both independent
samples t-test and Mann-Witney tests for comparing protein levels between patients and controls.
Correlation coefficients were calculated by the Pearson test. A P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.
To adjust for multiple testing, the Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction was
applied using the p.adjust function. Statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.5.3
(https://www.r-project.org/).
Functional annotation
The list of proteins with differences between patients and healthy controls were analysed for
pathways, ontologies, diseases/drugs in the Enrichr web tool (https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/)
[31]. Protein connections and pathways were analysed in the PathwAX web tool
(https://pathwax.sbc.su.se/help.html) [32]. The induced network analysis was constructed in
Consensus PathDB (http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de/) using an intermediate nodes z-score threshold of
30 and including binary protein-protein interactions of high confidence and biochemical reactions
[33].
Biomarkers of severe COVID-19
We performed a literature search on all proteins described associated with COVID-19 severity,
(defined as ICU admission, SpO2 saturation <90%, need of mechanical ventilation, or death). These
markers were listed and compared with the list of significant molecules detected in this study. The
search engine Geneshot (https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/geneshot/) was used to systematically
retrieve known markers associated with SARS infection and to calculate the probability of detecting
overlap due to chance with the protein list resulting from this study.

Results
This cohort is representative of adult patients from an urban setting in a middle-income country.
Demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1. Regarding cell counts, we found
significant differences in the number of eosinophils, neutrophils, and monocytes among groups
while there were no differences in the number of lymphocytes. A total of 315 plasma samples were
analysed with the Olink Inflammation panel to compare proteins levels between groups (Figure
1A).

Patients with asthma and COPD have increased levels of several plasma inflammatory
proteins.
We found differences in 41 plasma proteins between patients and healthy controls (Kruskal Wallis
test, nominal P < 0.05). Similar results were obtained by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and 36
proteins remained significant after Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction
(Figure 1B). The top significant proteins are presented in Figure 1C.

We then compared protein levels between disease groups and healthy controls by using the MannWitney test and independent samples t-test. The levels of 8 proteins showed significant differences
in asthmatic patients (IL-6, CXCL1, MMP-1, CSF-1, CXCL5, CCL3, CCL23 and TNFSF14)
(Figure 2), while 40 proteins showed significant differences in COPD patients (Figure 2). Four
proteins (CSF-1, CCL3, CCL23 and IL-6) were increased in both patient´s groups, however, the
number of proteins and the magnitude of the differences were higher in COPD patients than in
asthma patients (Figure 2).

The second cluster involved eight chemokines with moderate correlation in their protein levels
(CCL11, MCP-1, MCP-3, CXCL11, MCP-4, IL-8, CXCL9 and CXCL10). The most significant
were CXCL11 and MCP-4 (r = 0.67, P = 1.9 x 10-14), CXCL9 and CXCL10 (r = 0.65, P = 5.1 x 1013

Differentially expressed proteins are involved in recognized inflammatory pathways.
To further evaluate the biological relationships between the correlated protein clusters we
performed enrichment analyses on pathways and gene ontology terms. Differentially expressed
proteins were enriched in the Gene Ontology (GO) categories of cytokine and chemokine signaling
pathways (Figure 4A). The analysis on PathwAX showed the top significant enrichment in the
pathways of “Viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor”, “TNF signaling
pathway” and the “NF-kappa B signaling pathway” (Figure 4B). The proteins that overlap with
these biological processes involve several chemokines.

In addition, we explored the biological connections among differentially expressed proteins using
them as seeds in an induced network analysis considering evidence of binary protein-protein
interactions at high level of confidence and biochemical reactions. We found several interactions
between the cluster of HGF, OPG, TRANCE and VEGFA with the cluster of chemokines. First, the
strong correlation of HGF with OPG could be explained with their interaction mediated by the von
Villebrand factor (VWF). Upon that OPG interacts with its ligand TRANCE, metalloproteinases
(MMP) and the chemokine MCP-3. Besides, an interaction mediated by heparan sulphate (HS) links
HGF with IL-8 and VEGFA. The interaction of HGF with the chemokine cluster is also mediated
by Platelet Factor 4 (PF4). HGF also interacts with TNF involving neuropilin 1 (NRP1) (Figure 5).
We also observed an interaction between TNF and CXCL9 that has TMPRSS2 as an intermediate
node. From there, CXCL9 and CXCL10 seem to be immune checkpoints connected with several
other chemokines. IL-6 and IL-8 are interconnected between them and with the chemokine cluster
by members of the NFκB signaling pathway (Figure 5).

Asthma, COPD and severe COVID-19 patients shared increased plasma inflammatory
proteins.
The differentially expressed proteins were not only involved in biological pathways of viral
immune response (Figure 4) but were also found enriched in datasets of genes upregulated by
SARS coronaviruses. The COVID-19 Drug and Gene Set Library retrieved at least 10 experiments
with significant enrichment of the genes encoding the altered proteins detected in this study upon
infection. The top significant association was with nine genes upregulated by SARS-CoV-2 in
Calu3 cells including CXCL9, TNFRSF9, CX3CL1, CSF1, LIFR, IL6, CXCL11, CXCL10 and
TNF (Figure 6).

A comparison with 133 SARS Literature-Associated Genes in Geneshot GeneRIF revealed
significant overlap with four proteins found increased in our patients (CXCL10, CXCL9, IL-6,
TNF, P = 6.9 x 10-11). We then analysed which of the differentially expressed proteins detected in
this study have been previously reported associated with the severity of SARS-Cov-2 infection in
humans. Strikingly, we found that the top significant protein HGF have been reported increased in
critically ill COVID-19 patients [25, 34]. Also, other proteins such as IL-6, MCP-3, CXCL10, TNF,
and EN-RAGE have been found increased in patients with severe COVID-19 [24]. The protein
levels of eight severe COVID-19 biomarkers (HGF, CXCL9, IL-8, IL-6, MCP-3, VEGFA,
CXCL10, CCL3) as detected in healthy controls, asthmatics and COPD patients from this study are

Several plasma proteins associated with severe COVID-19 are influenced by age.
Plasma levels in 18 proteins showed significant correlations with age. The highest coefficients were
detected with OPG (r=0.59, P = 9.3 x 10-11), HGF (r=0.48, P = 3.2 x 10-7) and CXCL9 (r=0.43, P
=7.6 x 10-6). Of these age-correlated proteins, six had been also associated with COVID-19 severity:
HGF and CXCL9 shown the highest coefficients while IL10RB, VEGFA, IL-6 and TNF showed
low albeit significant correlation (r < 0.30). Besides, MCP-3, EN-RAGE and IL-8 did not show
relation with age. The dynamics of nine biomarkers of severe COVID-19 are presented in Figure 8.

Discussion
The pathophysiology of asthma and COPD is under evolving research to better understand the
mechanisms underlying these diseases. We found differences in plasma protein levels that have not
been previously reported, namely increased levels of CSF1, CCL23, CDCP1, CCL25, MCP4,
CCL11, SLAF1, CST5 and STST1A1 in COPD patients. Also, we reported for the first-time
decreased levels of CXCL1 and CXCL1, and increased levels of CCL3 in asthmatic patients. These
proteins could be candidates for biomarkers of these diseases. We also confirmed the increase of
several plasma proteins previously described in asthma and COPD. To explore the plasma protein
profiles we employed a multiplex assay based on the proximity extension assay (Olink) that is
sensitive, specific, and one of the most extensive panel available for proteins associated with
inflammatory diseases and related biological processes, enabling investigation of protein signatures
with high efficiency and robustness.
Among the proteins increased in COPD patients, HGF, CXCL9, MCP-3, IL-6, IL-8, CXL10, ENRAGE, IL10RB, VEGFA, CCL3 and TNF have been also found upregulated in patients with severe
COVID-19 [24, 26] and some of them such as HGF postulated as biomarkers for the severe form of
this infection [21, 34, 35]. The overlap between these biomarkers of COVID-19 severity and the
proteins we found increased in plasma from COPD patients add important information regarding
the susceptibility of these patients to severe COVID-19. Albeit asthma patients also showed
differences in plasma proteins compared to healthy controls, only two (IL-6 and CCL3) were shared
with severe COVID-19, a markedly lower number compared to those with COPD. These results
suggest that a more “systemic” inflammation in COPD patients contribute to their increased risk for
severe COVID-19.
HGF was the top significant protein marker in our study. Deng et al, reported that HGF levels
above 1,128 pg/ml can discriminate severe from non-severe COVID-19 patients, with an 84.6%
sensitivity and 97.9% specificity to classify severe patients (AUC of 90.5%). Also, they report that
HGF might significantly increase only when inflammation mounts toward an uncontrolled storm
[34]. However, our results demonstrate that patients with COPD have a significant elevation of this
marker before getting infected with SARS-CoV-2; therefore, further studies are needed to elucidate
the dynamic and importance of HGF in COPD and COVID-19 patients.
Additionally, plasma levels of HGF, osteoprotegerin (OPG) and TRANCE were correlated and
change in aged healthy groups. Given the relationship of OPG and TRANCE with
osteoclastogenesis [36, 37], our data may reflect protein changes due to aging, but also indicate that
the HGF-OPG-TRANCE axis is altered at earlier age-points in COPD patients (Figure 9). The
relevance of this finding on the increased susceptibility of aged individuals to severe COVID-19
needs to be further defined.

Other studies have linked HGF with a neutrophil signature that predicts critically ill COVID-19
patients [38]. In that study, HGF levels directly correlate with absolute neutrophil counts (rho=0.55,
P < 0.001) and together with resistin and lipocalin-2 are released from neutrophil granules upon
activation. Indeed, HGF and three other neutrophil granule proteins (RETN, LCN2, MMP-8) were
not elevated in non-ICU patients compared to controls and were only significantly different in
patients who would go on to develop critical illness [38]. The COPD patients in this study have
increased levels of HGF and higher numbers of neutrophils compared to asthmatics and healthy
controls, however we did not find correlation between HGF and neutrophil counts in COPD patients
(data not shown).
Our induced network analysis revealed protein-protein interactions between HGF and OPG
mediated by the von Willebrand factor (VWF) suggesting a connection of these markers with the
coagulation system (Figure 5). In the study of Thwaites et al., the von-Willebrand factor A2 was
elevated in all hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the elevation was highest in severely affected
COVID-19 patients [39]. Other studies also support the elevation of VWF as risk factor for severe
COVID-19 [40]. In this setting, our data support that HGF and OPG could be involved in severe
COVID-19 by affecting pathways implicated in coagulopathy and thrombosis [41-43]. Since HGF
have been reported increased in patients with rheumatic diseases [44] as well as in patients with
insulin resistance-diabetes [45], obesity [46], and diabetic kidney disease [47], further studies are
needed to establish if it is elevated in severe COVID-19 as a pre-existing condition reflecting the
presence of the comorbidity, or if increases during the infection and has a role in the
pathophysiology this condition.
Other cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α have been documented in severe COVID-19 [48]. Indeed,
high serum IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α levels at the time of hospitalization were strong and independent

predictors of patient survival [20]. Here we found increased levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF in COPD
patients. The analysis of protein-protein interactions between the differentially expressed proteins
detected in this study, revealed an interaction between TNF and CXCL9 that has the viral activator
TMPRSS2 as intermediate node (Figure 5). This transmembrane serine protease has been found
increased in smokers and in COPD patients [5, 49], and mediates the cleavage of the S protein in
SARS-CoV-2, thus is instrumental for viral entry [50]. CXCL9 was the protein showing the second
most significant differences between COPD patients and healthy controls (Figure 1 and 2). The
consequences of these protein interactions need to be experimentally elucidated, however our
results suggest that altered levels of TNF, IL-6 and CXCL9 in COPD patients may be involved in
the initial steps that predispose COPD patients to severe COVID-19. CXCL9 is a C-X-C motif
chemokine induced by interferon, considered a marker of monocyte/macrophage activation that is
implicated in lymphocyte infiltration, Th1 polarization and antiviral immune responses [51].
Several studies have reported increased expression of CXCL9 in severe COVID-19 patients [5255], as well as in CXCL10 and CXCL11 [24, 56], three co-expressed chemokines that were found
increased in the COPD patients in our study (Figure 2 and 7).
Another interesting finding was the enrichment of increased proteins in COPD patients in
chemokine and cytokine networks associated to viral response (Figure 4). Respiratory viral
infections can trigger acute exacerbations in COPD patients. Different viruses are implicated, for
example rhinovirus, influenza, syncytial respiratory virus and coronavirus [57]; being rhinovirus
and coronavirus detected in 35.7% and 25.9% of all viral infections occurring during acute
exacerbations [58]. Typically, COPD patients are more susceptible to viral infections. The
mechanisms underlying this susceptibility included dysregulated antiviral function of CD8+ T cells
via the PD-1/PD-L1 axis [59] and an altered production of interferons and chemokines [60]. Thus, it
is possible that differences in protein plasma levels and the enrichment of differentially expressed
proteins in viral related pathways (Figure 4), could be the consequence of previous viral infections
that induced lung inflammation and altered the plasma proteome profile in our COPD patients.
However, since our COPD patients had not experienced exacerbations in at least eight weeks before
sampling, these differences could reflect sub-clinical viral infections as has been described in
patients with stable COPD [61, 62]. Changes in some of these proteins and especially in
chemokines, might reflect an altered immune response that could explain their increased
susceptibility to a broad spectrum of viral infections including SARS-CoV-2.
In conclusion, our results provide evidence of dysregulated inflammatory signatures in the plasma
proteome of COPD that may underlie their increased susceptibility to severe COVID-19. Since
these proteins were found increased in patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection, they could be
further evaluated as biomarkers of increased risk to severe COVID-19. The detection of
dysregulated plasma proteins in other conditions known to be highly susceptible to severe COVID19 will provide important information for preventing and treating this viral disease. Moreover, the
proteins detected in this study provide potential targets of new or repositioned therapeutic
approaches aiming to avoid severe COVID-19 in patients with COPD.
