Abstract
Background Up to 9 March, 2020, 109577 patients were diagnosed with
coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) globally. The clinical and epidemiological
characteristics of adult patients have been revealed recently. However, the
information of paediatric patients remains unclear. We describe the clinical and
epidemiological characteristics of paediatric patients to provide valuable insight into
early diagnosis of COVID-19 in children, as well as epidemic control policy making.
Methods and Findings This retrospective, observational study was a case series
performed at 4 hospitals in the west of China. Thirty-four paediatric patients with
COVID-19 were included from January 1 to February 25, 2020. And the final followup visit was completed by February 28, 2020. Clinical and epidemiological
characteristics were analyzed on the basis of demographic data, medical history,
laboratory tests, radiological findings, and treatment information. Data analysis was
performed on 34 paediatrics patients with COVID-19 aged from 1 to 144 months
(median 33.00, IQR 10.00 - 94.25), among whom 14 males (41.18%) were included.
47.60% of patients were noticed without any exposure history. The median
incubation period was 10.50 (7.75 - 25.25) days. Infections of other respiratory
pathogens were reported in 16 patients (47.06%). The most common initial
symptoms were fever (76.47%), cough (58.82%), and expectoration (20.59%).
Vomiting (11.76%) and diarrhea (11.76%) were also reported in a considerable
portion of cases. A remarkable increase was detected in serum amyloid A for 17
patients (85.00%) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein for 17 patients (58.62%),
while a decrease of prealbumin was noticed in 25 patients (78.13%). In addition, the
levels of lactate dehydrogenase was increased significantly in 28 patients (82.35%),
as well as α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase in 25 patients (73.53%). Patchy

lesions in lobules were detected by chest computed tomographic scans in 28
patients (82.36%). The typical feature of ground-glass opacity for adults was rare in
paediatric patients (2.94%). A late-onset pattern of lesions in lobules were also
noticed. Stratified analysis of the clinical features were not performed due to
relatively limited samples.
Conclusions Our data presented the clinical and epidemiological features of
paediatric patients systemically. The findings offer new insight into the early
identification and intervention of paediatric patients with COVID-19.

Patchy shadows of high density were common in lobules lesions, while the typical

features of ground-glass opacity in adults were rare in paediatric cases.
●

A late-onset pattern of lobules lesions was revealed on the basis of chest

computed tomographic scans.
What do these findings mean?
●

The specific clinical features in paediatric patients should be paid more attention to,

when the physicians are dealing with suspected cases.

Introduction
The 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has spread worldwide rapidly
since its outbreak from Wuhan city in China in early December 2019 [1]. The
epidemic of 2019-nCoV has been declared as a public health emergency of
international concern by World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30, 2020 [2].
Up to date, 80904 cumulative laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported in
China. Meanwhile, 28673 cases have been reported from 104 countries and regions
outside of China [3]. The 2019-nCoV was identified as a diverse clade from the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and was reported as the cause of
coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) [4]. The clinical characteristics of adult
patients with COVID-19 have been revealed in recent studies, mainly including fever,
cough, dyspnea, and radiographic findings of pneumonia [5-7]. However, the
information of paediatric patients remains unclear.
This case series describes the clinical and epidemiological features of 34
paediatric patients on the basis of epidemiological, demographic, laboratory as well
as radiological data, and aims to contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the
characteristics of COVID-19.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
This retrospective, observational study was approved by the institutional review
board (IRB) of Affiliated Taihe Hospital of Hubei University of Medicine (Ethical
approval No.2020KY01). Suspected patients with clinical and/ or radiological
features of pneumonia were isolated for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection according
to relevant guidelines [8, 9]. Admitted children with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV

positive results were included in the study from 4 hospitals of China during January 1
to February 23, 2020. And the final follow-up visit was completed by February 28,
2020. Informed consent was obtained from the patients and their guardians prior to
data collection.
Laboratory detection for 2019-nCoV
Samples for pathogen detection were obtained from throat swab or lower respiratory
tract specimen. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
was employed for 2019-nCoV detection. Briefly, RNA was extracted from samples
using RNA isolation kit (SDK60103, bioPerfectus technologies, Taizhou, China)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After lysis and centrifugation, the
suspension was collected for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection. RT-PCR assay was
preformed using 2019-nCoV specific kit (NC-ORF1ab/N, DAAN GENE, Guangzhou,
China). The adapter primers and probe were supplied with kits, targeting to the open
reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N) of CoV gene in
accordance with the recommendation of National Health Commission of the People’s
Republic of China [10]. Specifically, for target ORF1ab: forward primer sequence
CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA; reverse primer sequence
ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA; and the probe sequence 5'-FAMCCGTCTGCGGTATGTGGAAAGGTTATGG-BHQ1-3'. For target N: forward primer
sequence GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT; reverse primer sequence
CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG; and the probe sequence 5'-FAMTTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3'. Amplifications were performed according
to manufacturer’s protocol under following conditions: reverse transcription at 50°C
for 15 min, and Taq inhibitor inactivation at 95°C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of
denaturation at 94°C for 15 s, and extension at 55°C for 45 s. The results of 2019-

nCoV nucleic acid detection were analyzed following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Specifically, a test result with a cycle threshold value (Ct-value) ≤ 38 and a
significant amplification curve was defined as positive. And a negative result was
defined with a Ct-value > 38. Retesting was required in cases other than those
mentioned above. Besides, negative cases were double checked by re-sampling and
retesting with an interval as 24 h, and could be confirmed when negative results
were obtained in 2 consecutive tests.
Data Collection
The medical records of included patients were accessed by study team for data
collection. And the data was cross-checked by staff from the Institute of Drug Clinical
Trial of Taihe Hospital for quality control. Specifically, demographic information,
medical history, and exposure history were collected from patients and their
guardians. Vital signs, physical exams, laboratory tests, and electroencephalogram
(ECG) were performed and recorded in routine process for inpatient paediatric
patients. Chest computed tomographic (CT) scans were performed to detect signs of
pneumonia if any. In particular, other respiratory pathogens were detected for
differential diagnosis screening, including influenza A virus, influenza B virus,
parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, epstein-barr virus, and
mycoplasma pneumoniae. Therapeutic information was also collected from
electronic medical records. In addition, the median incubation period and disease
course were analysed for epidemiological and clinical features of paediatric patients
with COVID-19.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were performed using SPSS software (version 20.0, IBM,
Armonk, NY, USA). No imputation was made for missing data. Categorical variables

are presented as number and frequency rates, and continuous variables are
presented as median and interquartile range (IQR).
Results
Characteristics of the Patients
In this case series, data from 34 paediatric patients with COVID-19 were analyzed,
including 14 male patients (41.18%) and 20 female patients (58.82%). The median
age was 33 (IQR 10.00 - 94.25) months with a range of 1 to 144 months. Eighteen
patients (52.40%) had exposure to residents of Wuhan, among whom history of
close contact was reported in 13 patients (72.22%). In particular, infections of other
respiratory pathogens were reported in 16 patients (47.06%), including mycoplasma
pneumoniae (26.47%), influenza B virus (17.65%), influenza A virus (8.82%),
respiratory syncytial virus (5.88%), epstein-barr virus (5.88%), parainfluenza virus
(2.94%), and adenovirus (2.94%). Comorbidities were reported in 6 patients
(17.65%). In respect of initial symptoms and signs, fever (76.47%), cough (58.82%),
and expectoration (20.59%) were complained most frequently. Meanwhile,
tachypnea, vomiting, and diarrhea were reported as well (Table 1). Regarding the
disease course, the median incubation period was 10.50 (7.75 - 25.25) days.
Moreover, the median day was 2.00 (1.00 - 3.50) from symptom onset to admission,
and 3.00 (2.00 - 4.00) between admission and recover from fever (Fig. 1).
Laboratory Tests Findings and Treatments
On admission, hematology tests indicated lymphocyte count was increased in 17
patients (50.00%), although the median value (3.19, 1.73 - 4.34) was shown within
normal range. Concerning the findings in blood biochemistry, prealbumin (median
138.65 mg /L) decreased significantly in 25 patients (78.13%), while a remarkable
increase was detected in serum amyloid A (SAA) for 17 patients (85.00%) and high8

sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) for 17 patients (58.62%). In addition, a
noticeable increase was observed in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) for 28 patients
(82.35%) and α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (α-HBDH) for 25 patients (73.53%).
However, the results of creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) were
in normal level for all patients (Table 2), as well as ECG exam. No other significant
findings were observed in blood coagulation tests, urine and stool routine tests.
Multimodality therapies were employed, including antibiotic therapy (88.24%),
antiviral therapy (82.35%), interferon-α nebulization (82.35%), corticosteroid therapy
(14.71%), and oxygen inhalation supportive therapy (8.82%) (Table 3).
Table 3. Chest Computed Tomographic Images Finding and Treatments of Patients
Chest CT Images Findings
Patchy lesions in lung lobules were indicated by chest CT scans in 28 patients
(82.36%) on admission. However, lesions in lobules were detected in 4 - 5 days after
admission for 5 cases (14.71%) among the patients with normal initial CT image on
admission. There was only 1 case (2.94%) without abnormal radiological finding
during hospitalization. Moreover, unilateral lesions were detected in 14 patients
(41.18%), while bilateral lesions were shown in 14 patients (41.18%) (Table 3). The
typical features of lesions were presented with patchy shadows of high density in
lobules (Fig 2).
Discussion
As mentioned in the literature review, the morbidity of COVID-19 was reported as 0.9%
among children age 0 - 14 [1]. However, the clinical and epidemiological
characteristics of paediatric patients haven’t been determined clearly yet. So far, this
is the largest case series to present the clinical and epidemiological characteristics in
children with COVID-19, as well as the first study to analyze the clinical features in

paediatric patients systematically.
Our findings in paediatric patients indicated several features distinguished from
adult patients, concerning epidemiological data, characteristics, initial symptoms,
laboratory tests, and CT findings. In respect to exposure history, up to 72.30% of
non-residents of Wuhan had contact with residents of Wuhan [1]. Thus, close contact
with residents of Wuhan was indicated as a high risk factor for transmission in adult
patients. However, a considerable proportion of patients (47.60%) were noticed
without any exposure history in our study. The unanticipated finding suggested the
referential value of exposure history for diagnosis of COVID-19 should be considered
carefully for paediatric patients. In addition, family cluster transmission was common
in paediatric patients. Close dynamic monitoring for families with adult patients would
contribute to early identification for paediatric patients. In accordance with the
features of indirect contact exposure, the incubation period was 10.50 (7.75 - 25.25)
days in paediatric patients, while 4.00 (2.00 - 7.00) days of incubation was revealed
for patients in all age groups [1]. The epidemiological features of paediatric patients
indicated dynamic observation was necessary for suspected cases in children due to
extended incubation period.
Dramatically, infections of other respiratory pathogens were detected in 16
patients (47.06%), however negative results were shown for these pathogens in
adult patients [6]. In alignment with the results of pathogens detection, a response to
viral infection was indicted by laboratory tests. Increasing lymphocyte count was
detected in 17 (50.00%) patients. The levels of SAA and hs-CRP were increased.
Meanwhile, decreasing level of prealbumin was noticed.
Basically, mild cases were common in paediatric patients with COVID-19 [1],
presenting with acute upper respiratory tract infection or mild pneumonia. Generally,

comorbidities were considered to predict the clinical outcomes. In our study,
comorbidities were found in 6 patients (17.65%), similar to that in adult patients with
mild symptoms (21.00%) [1]. In addition, effective control of disease was attributed to
the prompt access to medical care in paediatric patients. Intervention before
admission was reported in 30 patients (88.24%) upon initial symptom onset. And the
median duration was 2.00 (1.00 - 3.50) days from symptom onset to admission.
Typically, initial symptoms were valuable to predict the suspected cases. The most
common initial symptom, fever, was identified in 26 children (76.47%) in our study,
however it was presented in only 43.8% of adults patients on admission [1]. Besides,
vomiting (11.76%) and diarrhea (11.76%) were also complained on admission, which
were more common than that in adult patients (5.00% for vomiting and 3.80% for
diarrhea) [1]. Consistent with previous reports for adults [1, 6], the levels of LDH and
α-HBDH were increased remarkably without any symptom or sign of myocardial
impairment.
According to our current data in chest CT images, patchy shadows were
detected in 82.36% of patients on admission, in accordance with that in adults
(86.20%) [1]. We also noticed the lesions in lobules were characterized with patchy
shadows of high density in most cases (97.06%). Meanwhile, the typical feature of
ground-glass opacity in adults (56.4%) [1] was rare in paediatric patients (2.94%). It
was noteworthy that lesions in lobules would develop promptly in a few days, since
they could be shown initially in some cases (14.71%) in 4 - 5 days after admission.
The late-onset pattern of lesions was indicated in initial CT scan after 6 - 12 days
upon symptom onset [11]. However, the clinical presentations were not so
aggressive as the signs shown in CT images. Nonetheless, our findings suggested a
close monitoring for paediatric patients due to the aggressive development of lesions

in lobules, and the late-onset pattern in some cases as well.
The therapeutic strategy was on the basis of antiviral and antibiotic therapies,
which was in alignment with the recommendations of National Health Commission of
the People's Republic of China [12]. The patients recovered from fever in 3.00 (2.00 4.00) days upon admission after treatments. The lesions in lobules still existed in
discharge of patients, although great improvements were shown in CT scans after
treatments.
The current study was limited by small sample size due to low morbidity in
paediatric patients. The small sample size did not allow for intensive epidemiological
analysis and stratified analysis of the clinical features. Further information in this field
would help us to figure out a whole picture of COVID-19.
Conclusion
This case series described the clinical and epidemiological characteristics in
paediatric patients with COVID-19. Our data presented the clinical features of
paediatric patients to facilitate early identification and intervention of suspected
patients. Notwithstanding the relatively limited samples, our findings offer valuable
insight into early diagnosis and epidemic control of COVID-19 in children.
