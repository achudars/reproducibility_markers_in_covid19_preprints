MD Death COVID-19
ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused much morbidity and mortality to patients
but also health care providers. We tabulated the cases of physician deaths from COVID-19
associated with front-line work in hopes of mitigating future events.
METHOD:

On April 5, 2020, Google internet search was performed using the keywords

“doctor” “physician” “death” “COVID” “COVID-19” and “coronavirus” in English and Farsi,
and in Chinese using the Baidu search engine.
RESULTS: We found 198 physician deaths from COVID-19, but complete details were missing
for 49 individuals. The average age of the physicians that died was 63.4 years (range 28 to 90
years) and the median age was 66 years of age. Ninety percent of the deceased physicians were
male (175/194). General practitioners and emergency room doctors (78/192), respirologists
(5/192), internal medicine specialists (11/192) and anesthesiologists (6/192) comprised 52% of
those dying. Two percent of the deceased were epidemiologists (4/192), 2% were infectious
disease specialists (4/192), 5% were dentists (9/192), 4% were ENT (8/192), and 4% were
ophthalmologists (7/192). The countries with the most reported physician deaths were Italy
(79/198), Iran (43/198), China (16/198), Philippines (14/198), United States (9/192) and
Indonesia (7/192).
CONCLUSION: Physicians from all specialties may die from COVID, and these deaths will
likely increase as the pandemic progresses. Lack of personal protective equipment was cited as a
common cause of death. Consideration should be made to exclude older physicians from frontline work.

MD Death COVID-19
INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has infected at least 1.2 million individuals
worldwide with an overall 5.5% risk of death as of April 5, 2020. (1) Physicians caring for
COVID-19 infected patients are at high risk of contagion and possible mortality. To quantify and
mitigate this risk, the underlying characteristics of physician deaths from COVID infection are
investigated.

METHOD
No research ethics board approval was required for this publicly available information.
On April 5, 2020, a Google internet search was performed using the keywords “doctor”,
“physician”, “death”, “COVID”, “COVID-19” and “corona” in English, and repeated in Farsi.
An additional search was performed on Baidu (the Chinese version of Google) using the
equivalent Chinese characters. (see Appendix) An additional PubMed search was performed
using the English search terms.
Physicians who died after contracting COVID-19 from patient care activities or interactions with
medical colleagues were included. The doctor’s age, practice focus, gender, country and the date
of the report were recorded. Physicians who died from a cardiac event in the line of duty, or over
90 years of age were also noted, but not included in the final database. Data were analyzed using
Stata 15.1.

RESULTS
On PubMed search on April 5, 2020, no articles on physician deaths and COVID-19 were
found. Our internet search found 193 physician deaths related to COVID-19 infection due to
front-line work or interactions with work colleagues. The date of the reports ranged from
February 7, 2020, to April 5, 2020. Complete age details were only available on 149 physicians.
The Italian National Federation of Medicine Surgery and Odontology (2) had a complete list of
physician deaths in the country from COVID-19. The deaths in other countries required
compilation from numerous web articles. Two physicians caring for COVID-19 patients were
thought to die from cardiac compromise or exhaustion but were not diagnosed to have COVID
infection, and were excluded from the database. (3) (4) A doctor that died from COVID infection
acquired during travel rather than frontline-work or work colleagues was also excluded. (5)
Physicians older than 90 years of age were excluded from this study. The age details were
missing for 49 individuals. The average age of the physicians that died was 63.5 years (range 28
to 90 years) and the median age was 66.0 years. Physicians 57 years of age or older accounted
for three-quarters of COVID-related deaths.
Ninety percent (175/194) of the deceased physicians were male. General practitioners and
emergency room doctors (78/192), respirologists (5/192), internal medicine specialists (11/192)
and anesthesiologists (6/192) comprised 52% of those dying. Two percent of the deceased were
epidemiologists (4/192), 2% were infectious disease specialists (4/192), 4% were ENT (8/192),
4% were ophthalmologists (7/192), and 5% were dentists (9/192). [See Table 1]

Twenty-two percent (42/191) of the physicians practiced a surgical specialty with average age
63.4 years, compared to their primary care or medicine colleagues of average age 63.6 years.
There was no statistically significant difference between the ages of the surgeons and nonsurgeons. (p=0.96)
The countries with the most reported physician deaths were Italy (79/198; 40%), Iran (43/198;
22%), China (16/198; 8%), Philippines (14/198; 7%), United States (9/198; 5%), Indonesia
(7/198; 4%) and France (6/198; 3%). [See Table 2]

DISCUSSION
Death in the line of duty is the doctor’s ultimate sacrifice, which may be compounded when
physicians unknowingly infect family members. (6) The general public may not comprehend the
importance of self-isolation measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic until a physician dies
fighting the virus. (7)
We acknowledge the limitations of this paper. The number of physician deaths from COVID19 is likely under-reported given the rapidly changing course of the pandemic, and because
national mortality figures may not be available or accurately reported if all patients are not
tested. Although reliance on social media searches is suboptimal, it may be the only accessible
source of information, especially in countries with limited press freedom. We could not discern if
the physicians died from COVID-19 or underlying conditions with associated viral infection.
Pre-existing medical morbidities were not uniformly reported. The paper does not examine the
number of physicians infected with COVID, who have not died; nor does it enumerate the
mortality or our nursing and allied health colleagues.

MD Death COVID-19
Physician deaths from COVID-19 may vary between countries due to the time of disease
outbreak, varying public health resources, governmental policies and controls to enforce
quarantine and social distancing and mask wear, the amount of testing performed, ascertainment
bias, available medical supplies and technology and social greeting habits. (8) Nations such as
Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan that exercised decisive action to prevent travel from affected
regions, strict enforcement of quarantines and widespread testing contained the epidemic and
there are few social media reports of physician deaths. (9) South Korea had no physician or nurse
deaths from COVID-19 until 10 weeks after their disease outbreak. (10) (11) As the disease onset in
North America and the United Kingdom lagged behind Asia and Europe, the coming weeks may
reveal a rise in COVID-19 related physician deaths in these new regions. On April 5, 2020 there
was at least twelve COVID-19-related physician deaths in North America. An increasing number
of North American physicians have contracted COVID-19 and are in critical care. (12)
Physicians from almost all the medical specialties from psychiatry to urology have
succumbed to work-related COVID-19. Physicians working in the airway such as dentists,
otorhinolaryngologists, and anesthesiologists are especially at risk for COVID-19 infection and
this group comprised 12% of all physician deaths. Dentists are in close proximity to oral
secretions for prolonged periods and their high-speed handpiece and ultrasonic instruments
aerosolize body fluids. In our review 5% of the fatalities were in dentists. However, in a recent
paper from China (13) no dentists were reported to die from COVID-19 contracted during patient
encounters. Ophthalmologists also work for extended periods of time close to oronasal
secretions. Dr. Li Wenliang, the ophthalmologist from China who first alerted the world to
COVID-19, died from the disease at the age of 33 years. Subsequently, two more
ophthalmologists at Li’s workplace passed from COVID-19, perhaps due to prolonged proximity

to the airway of infected patients during ophthalmoscopy, tear transmission of the virus or from
nasolacrimal manipulations.
Lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and inadequate PPE were commonly cited as a
cause of death especially in developing nations and Italy. (14) When PPE is available, proper
donning and doffing techniques are required. If adequate manpower is available work teams with
a primary examiner, safety monitor, and scribe may decrease the risk of inadvertent
contamination.
Patients who lied about their travel history of infectious contacts have also been attributed to
physician deaths from COVID-19. (9) Mandatory passport inspections during pandemics might
avert the former. Meticulous public health investigations and expeditious location of all contacts
assisted by smartphone tracking might prevent the latter.
Purported risk factors for severe disease and death in COVID-19 include older age, male
gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease and
immunocompromise. (15) Senior physicians and those with comorbidities ideally should not be
assigned to front-line work with COVID-19 patients, but instead duties such as video or phone
assessments, consulting or public liason. (16)
Italian physicians have suggested that a community-centred or home care system for COVID19 rather than a hospital-focused system might decrease the transmission of disease and
physician exposure. (17)
Patient monitoring technologies that track pulse oximetry and vital signs and medical robots
allow doctors and nurses to remotely assess and treat infected patients can enhance patient care
and decrease risks to health care workers. At present robots that take temperatures, deliver food

and supplies, and disinfect rooms have been described. (18) However, in countries without
resources for even gloves or masks, robots are wishful thinking.
In summary, physicians from almost all medical specialties have succumbed to COVID-19,
and all require task-appropriate personal protective PPE. We are in the early phase of the
pandemic and the number of physician fatalities will increase. Doctors who were 57 years of age
or older accounted for three-quarters of COVID-19-related deaths. If senior or retired physicians
are recalled to work during the COVID-19 crisis, (19) consideration should be made to place them
away from the front line due to the increased risk of mortality, and the increased likelihood of
burden to the medical system if they become infected.
