COVID-19 infection during pregnancy: A systematic review to summarize
possible symptoms, treatments, and pregnancy outcomes

Abstract
Background: With the exponential increase in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
worldwide, an increasing proportion of pregnant women are now infected during their
pregnancy. The aims of this systematic review were to summarize the possible symptoms,
treatments, and pregnancy outcomes of women infected with COVID-19 during their
pregnancy.
Methods: Four databases (Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL) were searched
on March 25, 2020, using the following keywords: “COVID-19”, “nCoV-2019”, and
“coronavirus.” Articles included if they reported either the symptoms, treatments for the
women who had been infected with the COVID-19 during their pregnancy or pregnancy
outcomes. The selected articles' results were summarized employing a narrative synthesis
approach.
Results: A total of nine studies were selected for this study, comprising 101 infected
pregnant women. Other than the infected general population, infected pregnant women
reported different symptoms; however, fever (66.7%), cough (39.4%), fatigue (15.2%), and
breathing difficulties (14.1%) were common. Infected pregnant women were given different
treatments than the general infected population. The C-section was a common (83.9%) mode
of delivery among infected pregnant women, and a higher proportion of births were preterm
births (30.4%) and low birth weight (17.9%).
Conclusions: Pregnant infected women had different symptoms, and they were given
dissimilar treatments than the general infected population. Healthcare providers may have

Introduction
The world is now facing a new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, started in December
2019 in Wuhan, China), a major epidemic threat that the world has ever faced [1]. Since then,
the virus has spread to 205 countries or territories and infected around 1.2 million people, and
around 65 thousand of them died as of April 5, 2020 [2]. These rates of infections and deaths
have been changing daily because of their higher transmission capacity. Consequently, the
witness countries’ healthcare systems are now facing problems to treat the infected people
properly, although many of them are critically infected and need comprehensive care (5%)
[3, 4]. Essentially, these increasing rates are reported when the World Health Organization
(WHO) has declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic and asked countries to take aggressive
measures that are even reflected in countries' various initiatives [5, 6]. The roots of
transmission of this virus from an infected to non-infected person are in contact with an
infected person’s respiratory droplets (coughs or sneezes) [7], and touching surfaces or
objects that were touched by the infected person [7, 8], and has the capacity to infect 2.28
persons per day [9].
The virus is prevalent in all age clusters, irrespective of sex. However, it could cause more
adverse consequences, including deaths for persons who have pre-existing noncommunicable diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory diseases, and
cancer [1]. Notably, the majority of deaths reported worldwide have occurred among people
who had a history of one or more morbidities, which are often common among the elderly [1,
10]. The causes of death are many, but poor immunity capacity of people with one or more
morbidities might be the main.

Women during pregnancy often face several pregnancy-related complications and more
susceptible to respiratory pathogens that may put them at a higher risk of adverse
consequences. Getting COVID-19 infected at this stage, therefore, may put them in further
risk of occurring adverse pregnancy and newborn outcomes, including deaths; however, the
estimate is lacking [11]. Similar to the current COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) was reported in 2007 and showed devastating consequences if it occurred during
pregnancy [9, 12]. Earlier diagnosis of COVID-19 infection status, a clear understanding of
all possible symptoms of infection during pregnancy, and proper treatment are important to
combat the adverse consequences.
The available studies on the symptoms of COVID-19 were mainly conducted in the general
infected people, and fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath were the common
symptoms among them [13-18]. These symptoms reported in a few relevant studies vary for
pregnant women, which are inconsistent across studies. For instance, Liu et al. [19] identified
cough, shortening of breath, and fatigue alongside fever as the most important symptoms of
COVID-19 among pregnant women, whereas cough and fever were reported as vital
symptoms of COVID-19 in the Zhu et al. [20] study. The treatments provided to the COVID19 infected pregnant women were also varied. Oxygen support, antiviral therapy, and
antibiotic therapy were the treatments provided to the infected pregnant women mentioned in
Liu et al. [21] study. Alternatively, Zhu et al.’s study [20] reported that antibiotic therapy was
avoided for all infected pregnant women, but oxygen support and antiviral therapy were
provided. Under these circumstances, summarizing all possible symptoms and treatments are
necessary to assist healthcare personnel. They, thus, would able to make evidence-based
decisions to identify infected pregnant women early and provide the most effective
treatments. Moreover, knowledge of the possible adverse outcomes would help healthcare
personnel to take precautionary measures earlier. Therefore, this study summarized the

symptoms, treatments, and pregnancy outcomes of women who were infected with COVID19 during their pregnancy.

Methods
A systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and
Meta-analysis (PRISMA) consensus statement was conducted [22]. Relevant and available
studies related to COVID-19 infection among pregnant women were included.
Search strategy
Systematic computerized literature searches of the Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and
CINAHL databases were conducted on March 25, 2020. Studies published since the COVID19 started were included. Searches were conducted based on individual comprehensive search
strategies for each database. We developed a search strategy consisting of free-text words,
words in title/abstract, and medical subject headings (MeSH), combined using Boolean
operators (AND, OR). We also searched the reference list of the included articles and
selected journal websites.
Study selection criteria
Studies were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined below.
Inclusion criteria
Studies included if they reported COVID-19 infection among pregnant women and the
following: symptoms of the infection, treatment given, and outcome of pregnancy (if the
delivery had occurred). Studies published in the English language worldwide, irrespective of
study design, were included.

Exclusion criteria
Studies excluded if they reported COVID-19 infection among non-pregnant women or
general patients and wrote in languages other than English. We also excluded review papers
and studies in which the exposure status (COVID-19 among pregnant women), symptoms,
treatments, and outcomes were not clearly reported.
Data extraction and analysis
Two authors (MMAK and MGM) extracted information using a pre-designed, trailed, and
modified data extraction sheet. The extracted information included year of publication, study
location, study design, study sample size, symptoms reported, treatment given, and pregnancy
outcome (if delivery had occurred). The corresponding author solved any disagreements on
information extraction. The modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale, as part of the data extraction
strategy, was used to assess study quality.
The information recorded was dichotomous in nature. We, therefore, used a narrative
synthesis approach to summarize the findings from all the retrieved studies. All symptoms
following COVID-19 infection among pregnant women, the treatments given to them, and
the outcomes of their pregnancy are presented in detail along with relevant data if available.
Results
Study selection
A total of 1,818 articles dating from the inception of the COVID-19 were identified, of which
1,706 articles were excluded based on the title, abstract, and relevance of the research
questions. One hundred twelve articles were selected for full-text review, of which 103
articles were excluded because study samples were general infected population (95), reported
different outcomes (4), and written in languages other than English (2). A total of 9 articles
were finally selected for this study.

The background characteristics of the selected studies are summarized in Table 1. All
included studies were conducted in China following the initiation of the COVID-19 outbreak
in December 2019. Five of the nine included studies were followed retrospective cohort study
design, two were cross-sectional, and two were a case report. A total of 101 women were
included in the selected nine articles; their mean age was 30 years, and most of them were in
the third trimester of pregnancy (gestational age 22-41 weeks).
Symptoms of COVID-19 among pregnant women
Table 2 presents the symptoms reported in the included studies. Where available, the
symptoms were reported on case-basis included in the studies. Fever (66.7%) and cough
(39.4%) were the major symptoms following COVID-19 infection among pregnant women
(Figure 2). The other symptoms reported were fatigue (15.2%), breathing difficulties
(14.1%), and myalgia (7.1%). Sore throat (5.1%), diarrhea (4%), poor appetite (3%),
headache (3%), and malaise (2%) were also reported among pregnant women following
COVID-19 infection. Two different pregnant women also reported mulligrubs and
cholecystitis, respectively, which were added to the common symptoms.
Treatments used to treat COVID-19 diseases among pregnant women
The treatment patterns of COVID-19 infection among pregnant women during their
pregnancy or following delivery are summarized in Table 3. Of the nine articles included,
four articles reported similar treatments of oxygen and antibiotic therapy. Antiviral therapy
was also used in some cases. Cefoperazone sodium, cephalosporins, quinolones, and
macrolides were the commonly used antibiotics in antibiotic therapy, and lopinavir (400mg),
ritonavir (100mg), arbidol, and oseltamavir were commonly used in antiviral therapy.

The maternal and newborn outcomes following COVID-19 infection during pregnancy are
summarized in Table 4. This study included 101 women, of which delivery-related
information was available for 60 women; 56 had given live birth, and the remaining four
were still pregnant at the time of study conducted. Of all deliveries occurred, 83.9% had gone
through the C-section, and around 30.4% of the total deliveries were premature. Among these
reviewed cases, one maternal death and one neonatal death were also reported following
COVID-19 infection. The birth weight of the babies was normal in most cases, although
17.9% of the newborns had low birth weight (LBW). Only one of the included studies
reported evidence of mother-to-child transmission of COVID-19 infection after 36 hours of
delivery.
Discussion
The world is now experiencing an exponential increase in the COVID-19 infected people,
and a significant proportion of them are pregnant women. We summarized the symptoms
following COVID-19 infection among pregnant women, and the treatments are commonly
provided to them and the outcomes of the pregnancy. A total of nine studies were included in
this review, in which 101 infected pregnant women data were analyzed, and the majority of
them were in the third trimester of pregnancy. All included studies were conducted in China.
Symptoms reported by pregnant women following COVID-19 infection were slightly
different from the common symptoms in general infected people, but fever and cough were
common. Oxygen and antibiotic therapy were given as treatments for most infected pregnant
women. Of the sample analyzed in the eight studies included, 56 of them gave babies
following the infection occurred. Approximately 84% of the infected pregnant women had
gone through the C-section; around 30% of women had given premature birth, and a total of
18% of these babies were born with LBW. These summary findings will assist healthcare
personnel for the better management of pregnant women who have been infected with

COVID-19, which potentially reduces adverse consequences for women as well as their
babies.
Several questions have been provoked regarding maternal and neonatal safety if women were
infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy. The causes are complications following getting
infected and evidence of higher adverse consequences if it has happened with existing
morbidity, and these could be added to the usual pregnancy and delivery-related
complications. These factors may increase the occurrence of adverse maternal health and
birth outcomes, although estimates are lacking. Notably, earlier detection of the infection
through tests, symptoms, and effective treatments could reduce these risks. As revealed in
this study, based on available published research, fever, cough, fatigue, and breathing
difficulties are common symptoms among both pregnant women and infected general people
following COVID-19 infection [23, 24]. Although most of the symptoms were almost
similar, infected pregnant women had some additional symptoms such as sore throat,
myalgia, and poor appetite. Postpartum fever was also highly observed in women following
delivery. Therefore, close monitoring of these symptoms could be an effective way of early
detection of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. Previous corona-like virus outbreaks,
such as infection of SARS during pregnancy, reported malaise, chills, and rigors as common
symptoms along with fever, cough, and breathing difficulties [25].
Given that no specific treatments or vaccines have been discovered yet, the COVID-19
infection during pregnancy would put healthcare providers in additional challenges [23]. This
is because of the possible adverse effects of the medicine used on the fetus as well as
pregnancy. For instance, there is evidence that medicines such as chloroquine and
hydroxychloroquine are currently recommended for patients with COVID-19 [26], which
may cause fetal harm [27] and adversely affect newborns through transferring from mother
body by breastmilk [28, 29]. Therefore, cautions are needed in the treatment of infected

pregnant women. This study revealed that most infected pregnant women were given
symptomatic and supportive treatments considering pregnancy, although anti-inflammatory
and antiviral treatments have been used in some cases [30, 31]. Significantly, this study
summarized the commonly given antiviral treatments to the infected pregnant women were
oseltamivir, lopinavir (400mg), and ritonavir (100mg), which are different from usually
recommended medicines to treat COVID-19 in the general population [26]. Therefore,
healthcare providers may have to be careful about given antiviral treatments to infected
pregnant women.
Additionally, oxygen therapy and antibiotic therapy (e.g., cefoperazone sodium) have been
used in some cases [31, 32]. Notably, further cautious measures are needed to choose the
medicine from previous experience with SARS and its treatments, which is considered like
COVID-19 infection, and there are many similarities in treatments given for these infections.
For instance, oxygen and antiviral therapy (drugs, including ribavirin, ritonavir, and
lopinavir) are used in both SARS and COVID-19 [33]. However, corticosteroids were not
used to treat COVID-19, although it was used to treat SARS among pregnant women. There
is evidence that the use of corticosteroids during pregnancy increases the risk of preterm
birth, low birth weight, and preeclampsia [34].
Additional important findings of this study were the higher occurrence of adverse maternal
newborn outcomes among COVID-19 infected mothers. For example, as this study reported,
around 84% of the infected mothers had birth reported use of the C-section; a rate that is
significantly higher than the usual WHO’s recommendation of 1-5% use of C-section to
avoid death and severe morbidity in mothers and newborns [35, 36]. Getting COVID-19
infection increases complex viral infection among women in pregnancy; therefore, C-section
is recommended to reduce perinatal and neonatal adverse outcomes [37]. We also confirm the
evidence of the higher occurrence of preterm birth and LBW among the COVID-19 infected

mothers than their counterparts. These associations are unique, as the previous round of viral
infection, such as SARS, did not find any evidence of the association between infection
during pregnancy and occurrence of LBW and preterm birth [38-41]. Viral infection affects
pregnancy and fetal growth by gaining access to the placenta and decidua via hematogenous
transmission or the lower reproductive tract, leading to the occurrence of such adverse
outcomes [42]. However, effects can vary across cell types, gestational age, and changes in
the uterine environment and maternal immunity [42]. Therefore, earlier preparedness of the
healthcare sectors to handle these adverse consequences would be helpful to reduce further
adverse outcomes, including maternal and perinatal mortality.
This study has several strengths and limitations. This is the first study of its kind that
highlight the symptoms, treatments, and pregnancy outcomes among women who have been
infected with COVID-19. These findings may help healthcare providers to take proper
initiatives. We did not set any time and study design restrictions that allowed us to include a
higher number of studies. However, the major limitation is generalizability because all
included studies were conducted in China. Different treatments may be used to treat COVID19 during pregnancy in other countries. Moreover, none of the included studies reported
quantitative data that restrict us to conduct a narrative synthesis of the selected study’s
findings rather than given any pool estimates. Despite these limitations, this study has enough
merits, which will make healthcare providers informed about the symptoms, treatments, and
possible outcomes in pregnant women detected with COVID-19.
Conclusion
This study confirms that fever, cough, and breathing difficulties are the major symptoms of
COVID-19 infection among pregnant women, which are similar to general infected patients.
However, some additional symptoms among pregnant women are postpartum fever and

breathing difficulties. Recommended treatments such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine
for the infected people are not applicable for pregnant women because of their potential
adverse effects on the fetus and newborn; therefore, supportive and symptomatic treatments
are given to them. COVID-19 infection during pregnancy also increases the risk of several
adverse outcomes, including higher rates of cesarean delivery, low birth weight, and preterm
birth. Healthcare providers may consider these for effective management of COVID-19
infected pregnant women, which would reduce pregnancy-related adverse consequences,
including maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality.
