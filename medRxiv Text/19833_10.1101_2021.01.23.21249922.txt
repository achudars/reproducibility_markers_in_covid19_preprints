Summary

49

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious public health problem

50

worldwide. However, little is known about the prevalence of COVID-19 among

51

healthcare workers in Japan. We aimed to examine the seroprevalence of severe acute

52

respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies among 2,160 healthcare

53

workers in general hospitals and clinics in Japan. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2

54

immunoglobulin G was 1.2% in August and October 2020, which is relatively higher than

55

that in the general population in Japan. Because of the higher risk of COVID-19 infection,

56

healthcare workers should be the top priority for further social support and vaccination

57

against SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

60

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious public health problem

61

worldwide. In Japan, the confirmed cases of COVID-19 remained low as of December

62

2020 compared with those in Europe or northern America. The low seroprevalence

63

(0.03%–0.40%) of COVID-19 in the general population of Japan was reported in

64

several studies conducted from June to September 2020 (1). However, the prevalence of

65

COVID-19 among healthcare workers in Japan, who are at higher risk for COVID-19

66

infection (2), is not well characterized. Here, we aimed to determine the seroprevalence

67

of immunoglobin (Ig)M and IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome

68

coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) among workers in general hospitals and clinics in Japan.

69
70

Methods

71

A multicenter prospective study was conducted in nine general hospitals and clinics of

72

the SOUSEIKAI Medical Group: Fukuoka Mirai Hospital (FMH), Hakata Clinic (HC),

73

PS Clinic (PC), Sumida Hospital (SH), Miyata Hospital (MH), Kanenokuma Hospital

74

(KH), Shinyoshizuka Hospital (SYH), Nishikumamoto Hospital (NH), and DouDou

75

Clinic (DC). These hospitals/clinics are not designated to treat COVID-19 patients.

specialized facilities for clinical trials (mainly Phase 1 clinical trials). FMH, PC, MH,

78

KH, and SYH are located in Fukuoka prefecture; NH is located in Kumamoto

79

prefecture; and DC and SH are located in Tokyo.

80

This study was approved by the SOUSEIKAI Hakata Clinic Institutional Review

81

Board (approval number: N-105) and registered in the UMIN Clinical Trial Registry

82

(registration number: UMIN000041262). The people working in the hospitals/clinics of

83

the SOUSEIKAI Medical Group were invited to participate in the study. All participants

84

provided a written informed consent. In each survey, a questionnaire was used to obtain

85

the following data: job title, presence of suspected COVID-19 symptoms since February

86

2020, and history of COVID-19 diagnosis. The participants’ occupations were divided

87

into eight categories: nurses (including nurse assistants), physicians, technicians

88

(laboratory technicians, radiology technicians, pharmacists, clinical engineers, dental

89

hygienists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and

90

acupuncturists), nursing care staff, office workers, receptionists, employees in clinical

91

research units, and others (drivers, security personnel, nursery school teachers, shop

92

workers, sanitary workers, nutritionists, and food service staff).

Gold], INNOVITA Biological Technology Co., Ltd., Tangshan, China) following the

96

manufacturer’s instructions. Blood samples were collected in August and/or October

97

2020. Using descriptive statistics, the difference in seropositive rates across background

98

characteristics was assessed using a chi-square test. Two-tailed P values of <0.05 were

99

considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed using JMP Pro 15 (SAS

100

Institute Inc. Japan, Tokyo, Japan).

102

Results

103

A total of 2,160 SOUSEIKAI workers, aged 20–83 years (mean = 41.9, standard

104

deviation =12.7; women: 1,547 [71.6%]), underwent at least one antibody test in August

105

and/or October. IgM and/or IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 33 (1.5%)

106

and 27 (1.3%) participants in August and October, respectively (Table 1). IgG

107

antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 25 (1.2%) and 24 (1.2%) participants

108

in August and October, respectively. After excluding one facility, where nosocomial

109

infections occurred in April 2020, 13 participants (0.8%) demonstrated IgG positivity in

110

August and October (Table 1). Of the eight participants who showed IgM positivity in

111

August, none reported IgG positivity in October. Among the participants who showed

112

IgG positivity in August, 95.5% (21/22) demonstrated IgG positivity in October.

113

The prevalence of IgG antibodies was higher among the 20–29-year and 60–

114

69-year age groups compared with other age groups, whereas no significant difference

115

was observed between women and men (Table 2). The prevalence of IgG antibodies was

116

relatively, but not significantly, higher among nurses, nursing care staff, and

117

receptionists (Table 2). Among the 28 participants who had at least one IgG-positive test

118

result, 17 (60.7%) had suspected symptoms of COVID-19 since February 2020. Among

119

the 14 participants diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the antibody tests, 10 (71.4%)

120

tested positive for IgG antibodies.

121
122

Discussion

123

The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies varies among countries and cities. Europe

124

and northern America have high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, whereas

125

Eastern Asia has a relatively low prevalence (3). In Japan, several studies conducted

126

from June to September 2020 reported low seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

127

(0.03%–0.40%) in the general population (1). In this study, the seroprevalence of SAR-

128

CoV-2 IgG antibodies among healthcare workers was 1.2% in August and October

129

2020. It has been reported that the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in healthcare

130

workers was higher than that in the general population (2,4). Our study also

131

demonstrated that the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was relatively higher in

132

healthcare workers than in the general population in Japan.

133

The 20–29-year and 60–69-year age groups had high prevalence of SARS-CoV-

134

2 IgG antibodies. Among the five participants in the 60–69-year age group who tested

135

positive for IgG antibodies, four worked in the facility where nosocomial infection

136

occurred in April 2020; therefore, the high prevalence among the 60–69-year age group

137

was possibly due to nosocomial infection. The routes of infection in the 20–29-year age

138

group have not been fully elucidated. However, the high occupational and daily activities

139

and the demographic characteristics of asymptomatic carriers in the young age group

140

were considered to be contributing factors.

141

The level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies remain high for at least a few months after

142

developing a COVID-19 infection (5–7). A recent study reported high levels of SARS-

143

CoV-2 antibodies (69.0%–91.4%) 8 months after asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2

144

infection (8). In this study, 95% (21/22) of participants who had IgG antibodies in August

145

tested positive for IgG antibodies in October. Among the participants who had a history

146

of acquiring COVID-19, 71.4% (10/14) showed IgG positivity up to 6 months after

147

infection. These results support those of previous studies, which reported that IgG

148

antibodies can be detected in the majority of patients a few months after SARS-CoV-2

149

infection.

150

One limitation of this study is that only one antibody assay kit was used. As PCR

151

tests or antigen tests were not conducted in participants with SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG

152

antibodies, it remained uncertain whether false-positive data were included. In particular,

153

among the eight participants who tested positive for IgM antibodies alone in August, none

154

tested positive for IgG antibodies in October. We recruited individuals working at

155

SOUSEIKAI medical group facilities for this study; of them, 91.6% (2,142 out of 2,338)

156

in August and 90.0% (2,081 out of 2311) in October participated in this study. Thus, the

157

effect of selection bias is limited.

158

In conclusion, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among healthcare

159

workers in Japan was 1.2%, which was relatively higher than that in Japan’s general

160

population. Healthcare workers are at higher risk of infection; hence, they should be the

161

top priority for further social support and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.
