Research in Context
Treatment trials for COVID-19 have largely focused on hospitalized patients and no treatments
are approved for people with mild to moderate disease in the outpatient setting. A number of
studies in ambulatory populations have been registered but no controlled studies in the outpatient
setting have been reported to date (Pubmed Search October 20, 2020, COVID-19 treatment;
controlled trials). Uncontrolled case series of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin
have been reported with mixed results but no clear signal of efficacy and some concerns raised
about cardiac toxicity. Treamtent in the outpatient setting has potential to prevent infected
individuals from deteriorating and perhaps more importantly, may shorten the duration of viral
shedding, reducing the risk of transmission and the duration required for self-isolation, with
significant public health and societal impact.
Added value of this study
This is the first study to show an antiviral effect in outpatients with COVID-19. After controlling
for baseline viral load, those treated with peginterferon-lambda had a 4.12-fold (95%CI 1.1516.7, p=0.029) higher odds of viral clearance by Day 7 compared to those who received placebo.
The viral load decline was faster with pegterferon-lambda and the effect was most pronounced in
those with high viral loads. In individuals with a baseline viral load of 10E6 copies/mL or higher,
15/19 (79%) in the peginterferon-lambda arm cleared by Day 7 compared to 6/16 (38%)
(p=0.012) in the placebo arm (OR 6.25, 95%CI 1.49-31.1, p=0.012), translating to a median time
to viral clearance of 7 days (95%CI 6.2-7.8 days) with peginterferon-lambda compared to 10
days (95%CI 7.8-12.2 days) with placebo (p=0.038). Those with low viral loads (<10E6
copies/mL) cleared quickly in both groups. Peginterferon-lambda was well-tolerated with a
similar side effect profile to placebo and no concerning laboratory adverse events.

Implications of all available evidence
There is no currently approved therapy for outpatients with COVID-19. This study showed that
peginterferon-lambda accelerated viral clearance, particularly in those with high baseline viral
loads, highlighting the importance of quantitative viral load testing in the evaluation of antiviral
agents for COVID-19. Treatment early in the course of disease may prevent clinical deterioration
and shorenting of the duration of viral shedding may have important public health impact by
limiting transmission and reducing the duration required for self-isolation. Additional trials of
peginterferon-lambda and other antiviral strategies in the outpatient setting are required.

Summary
Background: There are currently no effective treatments for outpatients with coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19). Interferon-lambda-1 is a Type III interferon involved in the innate antiviral
response with activity against respiratory pathogens.
Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, outpatients with laboratory-confirmed
COVID-19 were randomized to a single subcutaneous injection of peginterferon-lambda 180µg or
placebo within 7 days of symptom onset or first positive swab if asymptomatic. The primary
endpoint was proportion negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on Day 7 post-injection.
Findings: There were 30 patients per arm, with median baseline SARS-CoV-2 viral load of 6.71
(IQR 1.3-8.0) log copies/mL. The decline in SARS-CoV-2 RNA was greater in those treated with
peginterferon-lambda than placebo (p=0.04). On Day 7, 24 participants (80%) in the peginterferonlambda group had an undetectable viral load compared to 19 (63%) in the placebo arm (p=0.15).
After controlling for baseline viral load, peginterferon lambda treatment resulted in a 4.12-fold
(95CI 1.15-16.7, p=0.029) higher likelihood of viral clearance by Day 7. Of those with baseline
viral load above 10E6 copies/mL, 15/19 (79%) in the peginterferon-lambda group were
undetectable on Day 7 compared to 6/16 (38%) in the placebo group (p=0.012). Adverse events
were similar between groups with only mild reversible transaminase elevations more frequently
observed in the peginterferon-lambda group.
Interpretation: Peginterferon-lambda accelerated viral decline in outpatients with COVID-19
resulting in a greater proportion with viral clearance by Day 7, particularly in those with high
baseline viral load. Peginterferon-lambda may have potential to prevent clinical deterioration and
shorten duration of viral shedding.

INTRODUCTION (3,473 words)
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), continues to be a global health threat. To date, only
remdesivir and dexamethasone have demonstrated efficacy in randomized trials, but evaluated
hospitalized patients only1, 2. As with other acute viral infections, early initiation of antiviral
therapy for COVID-19 may improve clinical outcomes3; yet there are few studies among
outpatients. In addition to halting clinical progression, early treatment may shorten the duration of
viral shedding, potentially reducing transmission and the duration of self-isolation4.

Interferons are produced as part of the innate immune response to viral infections, driving
induction of genes with antiviral, antiproliferative and immunoregulatory properties5. The broad
array of genes induced by interferons limits the risk of antiviral resistance and makes them optimal
agents for novel viral pathogens6. Interferon-lambdas, known as Type III interferons, exert a
similar antiviral state to interferon-alpha/beta, but use a distinct receptor complex with high
expression levels limited to epithelial cells in the lung, liver and intestine, resulting in fewer
systemic side effects6. Interferon-lambda-1 controls respiratory viral infections in mice without
the risk of promoting cytokine storm syndrome, as has been seen with Type I interferon treatment7.
Additionally, interferon-lambda inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture and mouse
models8, 9.

Peginterferon-lambda, a long-acting form of interferon lambda-1, has been evaluated in
over 3,000 patients with viral hepatitis infections, demonstrating similar antiviral efficacy to
interferon-alpha, but with an improved side effect profile10, 11. We performed a randomized,

METHODS
Study Design
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, involving six institutions
in Toronto, Canada, evaluating treatment with a single 180 µg subcutaneous injection of
peginterferon-lambda or placebo in outpatients with COVID-19. The Research Ethics Boards of
all participating institutions approved the study, which was registered (NCT04354259) and
conducted under a Clinical Trial Application approved by Health Canada. For the complete study
protocol and statistical analysis plan, see Supplementary material.

Participants
Individuals were recruited from outpatient testing centers at six institutions in Toronto,
Canada between May 18, 2020 and September 4, 2020. Individuals with SARS-CoV-2-infection
confirmed by nasopharyngeal swab were eligible if they were within 7 days of symptom onset or
first positive test if asymptomatic. The main exclusion criteria included pregnancy and pre-existing
immunosuppressive or other medical conditions that could be worsened by peginterferon-lambda
(see protocol for complete inclusion and exclusion criteria). In line with institutional COVID-19
restrictions, all individuals provided witnessed verbal informed consent.

Randomization and Masking
Eligibile consenting adults were randomized 1:1 to a single subcutaneous injection of 180
µg of peginterferon-lambda or saline placebo. A computer-generated randomization list was
created by the study statistician (BH) with a randomization schedule in blocks of four. At the time
of randomization, the study personnel received a sealed opaque envelope with the treatment

allocation number that indicated which vial to administer to the participant. Numbered study
medications were stored in indvidual opaque bags in the study refrigerstor until use. Because of
the lack of an identical matching placebo, one of two study personnel administering the medication
was aware of the treatment allocation. The participant was instructed to look away during the
administration and there were no identifiable features on the syringe to unmask allocation to the
participant. After administering the medication, all further follow-up (phone calls and study visits)
was done by other study personnel unaware of treatment allocation. A second copy of sealed
envelopes with treatment allocation was stored in a locked cabinet for emergency purposes in case
of the need for unmasking. Aside from the nurse administering the study medication, all other
study personnel and study participants remained masked to treatment allocation until unblinding
of the study. The study statistician maintained the masked randomization list on a secure server.
Unmasked data were provided to the DSMC for scheduled safety review. No interim efficacy
review was performed by the DSMC. Analysis of study results was performed after the statistical
analysis plan was finalized, at which point the randomization list linking data to study
identification numbers was unmasked.

Procedures
Study participants attended an outpatient clinic where they were randomized using a
computer-generated randomization schedule in blocks of 4. Prior to receiving the study treatment,
participants were instructed on proper technique for self-collection of mid-turbinate nasal swabs
and collected an observed swab. Treatment with peginterferon-lambda or placebo was
administered by a study nurse and participants were observed for 30-60 minutes afterwards.
Participants were given written and video instructions to reinforce technique in swab self-

collection and whenever possible, swab collection was observed virtually by study staff.
Temperature monitoring and assessments of adverse events (AEs) were conducted remotely by
study personnel blinded to study arm along with self-collected mid-turbinate (MT) swabs on Day
0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14. Hematological and biochemical tests were obtained on Days 0, 3, 7 and
14. Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 results were generated for MT swabs (see Supplementary material).
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies to S protein were measured on Day 0, 3, 7 and 14 (DiaSorin,
Saluggia, Italy).

Outcomes
The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of individuals with a negative MT swab
for SARS-CoV-2 at Day 7, which was chosen based on available data of clearance rates by Day 7
with interferon-beta and a pragmatic consideration that clearance beyond 7 days in an outpatient
population would be of limited practical benefit12. The primary safety outcome was the incidence
of treatment-emergent severe adverse events (SAEs) by Day 14. Secondary outcomes included:
time to undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA, quantitative change in SARS-CoV-2 RNA over time,
anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody positivity, the incidence and severity (mild/moderate/severe) of
AEs, and the proportion hospitalized by Day 14. Detailed directed and open-ended symptoms were
assessed serially by phone. Due to overlap between symptoms of COVID-19 and potential
peginterferon-lambda AEs, all symptoms were recorded and categorized, and any symptoms
outside of the directed symptom assessment were considered AEs. Laboratory AE severity was
graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0. An independent
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) reviewed safety data after 10, 20 and 30 patients

completed 7 days of post-treatment follow-up. After review, the DSMC advised the study team
whether to continue enrolment.
Statistical Analysis
Based on early COVID-19 studies12, 13, we estimated 40% viral clearance by Day 7 in the
placebo arm and 80% in the peginterferon-lambda arm, requiring 30 patients per arm, to achieve
80% power with alpha of 0.05, accounting for 10% dropout.
Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics were summarized using means with
standard error or medians with interquartile ranges for continuous variables, and proportions for
categorical variables. The main efficacy outcome was analyzed by a Chi-square test following an
intention-to-treat principle. Prespecified analysis of the primary endpoint adjusted for baseline
viral load using bivariate logistic regression was performed. Secondary outcomes were compared
using Chi-square tests for proportions or Wilcoxon/linear regression controlling for baseline
values. The effect of treatment, baseline factors and viral load on clearance by Day 7, were
assessed by logistic regression and time-to-clearance by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
Generalized estimating equations and generalized linear models were used to analyse differences
between peginterferon-lambda and placebo in symptom/AE severity grade, and laboratory and
viral load patterns over time, respectively. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4.

accept responsibility to submit for publication.

RESULTS
Participants
Of 364 individuals approached for the study, 105 did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria
and 199 eligible individuals declined to participate (Figure 1). All 60 randomized individuals
received an injection and 59 (98%) completed follow-up, with one lost to follow-up after Day 3.
The median age was 46 years (IQR 32-54), 35 (58%) were male and eleven (19%) participants
were asymptomatic. The mean time from symptom onset to randomization was 4.5±1.7 days. The
median baseline SARS-CoV-2 RNA level was 6.71 (IQR 1.3-8.0) log copies/mL with 10 (33%)
individuals in the placebo group and 5 (17%) in the peginterferon-lambda group having
undetectable viral load on the day of randomization. Other baseline characteristics were similar
between groups (Table 1).

Outcomes
The baseline SARS-CoV-2 RNA level was higher in the peginterferon lambda group and
was significantly associated with the probability of clearance by Day 7 (OR 0.69, 95%CI 0.510.87, p=0.001). Overall, by Day 7, 24/30 (80%) in the peginterferon-lambda group were negative
for SARS-CoV-2 RNA compared to 19/30 (63%) in the placebo arm (p=0.15) (Figure 2a). After
adjusting for baseline viral load, peginterferon-lambda treatment was significantly associated with
clearance by Day 7 (OR=4.12, 95%CI 1.15-16.7, p=0.029) (Table 2).

The odds of viral clearance by Day 7 with peginterferon-lambda treatment compared to
placebo increased with every log increase in baseline viral load (Figure 3). For those with baseline
RNA of 10E6 copies/mL or greater, the proportion undetectable at Day 7 in the peginterferonlambda group was 15/19 (79%) compared to 6/16 (38%) in the placebo group (OR 6.25, 95%CI
1.49-31.1, p=0.012) (Figure 2b), translating to a median time to viral clearance of 7 (95%CI 6.27.8) days with peginterferon-lambda compared to 10 (95%CI 7.8-12.2) days with placebo
(p=0.038) (Supplementary Figure 1). Of those still positive at Day 7, participants in the
peginterferon lambda group had lower viral loads than those in the placebo group, with 3 of 4 at
10E4 copeis per mL or lower, compared to 6/10 (60%) above 10E5 copies per mL in the placebo
group (Supplementary Table 2). In contrast, in those with baseline viral load below 10E6
copies/mL, viral loads were higher in the peginterferon-lambda group, but both groups cleared
very quickly; 9/11 (82%) in the peginterferon-lambda arm and 13/14 (93%) in the placebo arm
were undetectable at Day 7 (OR 0.35, 95%CI 0.01-4.15, p=0.40) (Figure 2c).

The mean decline in SARS-CoV-2 RNA was significantly greater in the peginterferonlambda than in the placebo group from Day 5 onwards (Figure 2e), with a similar effect observed
when restricted to those with detectable virus at baseline (Supplementary Figure 2) or baseline
viral load at or above 10E6 copies/mL (Figure 2g). Clearance was rapid in the low viral load group
in both groups (Figure 2i).

No baseline covariates modified the association between baseline viral load and treatment
assignment with clearance by Day 7 (Table 2, Supplementary Figure 3). Participants who were
asymptomatic were more likely to have baseline viral loads below 10E6 copies/mL than those with

symptoms (91% vs 27%, p<0.001). At randomization, 5/51 (9.7%) participants with available
samples were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 S IgG antibodies, of whom 4 had undetectable SARSCoV-2 RNA. Antibody positivity increased in both groups over time (Supplementary Figure 4).
The presence of antibodies at any timepoint was associated with a corresponding lower viral load,
with the association weakening with time as people cleared.

Safety
Symptoms were grouped into 7 categories (Table 3) and reported as absent/mild/moderate
or severe. Respiratory and fever/systemic symptoms were most common in both groups (Figure
4). Documented temperature above 38oC was rare but only reported beyond Day 2 in the
peginterferon-lambda group (Supplementary Figure 5). Overall, most symptoms in both groups
were mild and there was no difference in frequency, severity or rate of improvement of any of the
7 symptom categories between treatment groups. (Figure 3, Supplementary Table 2). A symptom
was graded as severe on 20 occasions by 7 patients in the peginterferon-lambda group and on 30
occasions by 7 patients in the placebo group with somewhat different patterns. In the peginterferon
group, severe symptoms were most commonly loss of taste/smell whereas in the placebo group,
fever/systemic symptoms were most frequently rated as severe (Supplementarry Table 3).
Symptoms improved in both groups over time at a similar rate (Supplementary Table 2, Figure 3).
Participants with baseline viral loads above 10E6 copies/mL had higher symptom scores than those
with low baseline viral loads in all categories, except skin symptoms, but improved similarly
during follow-up (Supplementary Table 2).

Laboratory AEs were mild and similar between groups. Aminotransferases were elevated
at baseline in 3 (11%) participants in both groups and increased mildly, moreso in the
peginterferon-lambda group. However, only two individuals met the threshold of Grade 3
elevation, one in each arm. No other grade 3/4 laboratory AEs were reported (Table 4). There were
no elevations in bilirubin with the observed increases in aminotransferases. Hemoglobin, white
blood count and platelets were similar with no episodes of myelosuppression in either group. Ddimers were elevated in both groups at baseline but declined over time only in the peginterferonlambda group (Day 7: placebo 841 ug/L vs peginterferon-lambda 437 ug/L, p=0.02). Other
inflammatory markers including ferritin and C-reactive protein were elevated at baseline in both
groups and changed minimally over time (Figure 5).

AEs outside of the directed symptom categories occurred in one participant in the placebo
arm (rectal bleeding) and in two who received peginterferon-lambda (confusion, pneumonia); all
deemed unrelated to treatment. One serious adverse event was reported in each group. A
participant in the placebo group was hospitalized on Day 1 post-injection with progressive dyspnea
attributed to worsening COVID-19, that improved over time leading to discharge on Day 3. One
participant in the peginterferon-lambda group was admitted to hospital on Day 14 with shortness
of breath and found to have a pulmonary embolism necessitating anticoagulation. No deaths
occurred in either group.

DISCUSSION
Treatment with a single dose of peginterferon-lambda accelerated viral load decline and,
after controlling for baseline viral load, reduced the time to viral clearance in outpatients with
COVID-19. The treatment effect was most apparent in those with high baseline viral loads.
Peginterferon-lambda was well tolerated with similar symptoms to those treated with placebo.

Results for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing are routinely reported dichotomously as
positive or negative, without viral load quantification. Cycle threshold (Ct) values are sometimes
reported, but are only semi-quantitative, and vary by assay and even by run, such that results cannot
be reliably compared. Our inclusion of plasmid-derived cDNA standards with every PCR run
allowed for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA results and robust direct comparison between
samples. Quantification is useful clinically as higher viral levels have been correlated with greater
severity of COVID-1914, 15 and infectivity16. As people clear infection, they may have persistently
very low levels of RNA detected at very high Ct values (>33), which are not infectious17.

We found that the odds of clearance were greater in all study particpants with
peginterferon-lambda than with placebo after controlling for baseline viral load. However, the
effect of peginterferon-lambda was most evident when baseline viral loads were above 10E6
copies/mL. While the specific threshold for transmissible virus is unknown, using a standard
infectivity assay, Bullard and colleagues reported that at Ct values above 24, corresponding to
approximately 10E6-10E7 copies/mL, infectious virus could not be detected16. We observed that
in individuals with low levels of virus, irrespective of their assigned group, spontaneous clearance
occurred rapidly and near-universally by Day 7. This does not indicate lack of effectiveness of

peginterferon-lambda at low viral loads, but rather that with such low levels of virus, treatment
was not required as clearance was imminent. Indeed, 10 participants in the plaebo group and 5 in
the peginterferon arm already had undetectable virus by the day of randomization. In addition, 5
participants, all in the placebo arm, had already developed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies by
the day of randomization. Similarly, recent evaluation of the REGN-COV2 monoclonal antibody
cocktail demonstrated that individuals with the highest baseline viral loads exhibited the largest
reduction in SARS-CoV-2 RNA with treatment, while those with detectable SARS-CoV-2
antibodies at baseline (45% of the study population) had low viral loads and did not benefit from
therapy18. It is likely that all antiviral strategies will be most effective early in infection and
maximally beneficial to those with highest viral loads. Indeed early reports of interferon-beta use
have not shown a clear benefit in hospitalized patients, however whether this relates to late
introduction of therapy or possibly to the pro-inflammatory effects of Type I interferon is
unknown. Ideally, antivirials would be given shortly after disease onset as rapid reduction of viral
load would likely lower the risk of clinical deterioration, but also may reduce transmission,
translating into significant public health benefits.

In the placebo group with high baseline viral load, 10/16 (63%) participants had detectable
virus at Day 7, with 6/10 (60%) continuing to exceed 10E5 copies/mL, raising concern of persistent
shedding of competent virus. In contrast, only 4/19 (21%) participants who received peginterferonlambda had detectable virus at Day 7, all with viral loads below 10E6 copies/mL. If these results
are confirmed in larger studies, either quantitative testing could be introduced, with the added
benefit of predicting those at risk of a severe clinical course, or a qualitative assay, ideally a pointof-care test, could be titrated to achieve an analytical sensitivity of ~10E6 copies/mL allowing for

immediate risk stratification and determination of the need for treatment. Indeed, this could likely
already be achieved using currently available rapid antigen tests, with detection sensitivities in the
range of 10-50,000 copies/mL, safely below the infectious threshold but avoiding those with
extremely low viral loads who are unlikely to require any intervention19. Alternatively, given the
tolerability of a single dose of peginterferon-lambda it may be reasonable to consider treatment
irrespective of viral load, as a simple, universal approach.

Peginterferon-lambda was well tolerated with no identified safety concerns. Side effects of
peginterferon-lambda overlap with COVID-19 symptoms, making it difficult to distinguish
whether AEs were related to treatment or persistent infectious symptoms. As has been reported
previously, symptoms were more prominent in those with higher viral loads. With detailed serial
symptom assessment, we found that symptoms improved in both groups over time without obvious
differences. Notably, among those who were asymptomatic at baseline, there was no difference in
AEs between the treatment and placebo groups. Mild, reversible transaminase elevations were seen
more frequently in the peginterferon-lambda group, which have been reported previously10.
Intriguingly, D-dimer levels fell with peginterferon-lambda treatment, which may be relevant
given the association of high levels with more severe disease and increased all-cause mortality2022

. The side effect profile and absence of hematological toxicity is consistent with the better

tolerability of Type III interferons compared to Type I interferons like alpha/beta10. Treatment with
interferon-lambda may be particularly attractive given reports that impaired interferon production
and the presence of autoantibodies to interferon-alpha are associated with severe COVID-1923-25.
Additional benefits include the broad activity of interferon lambda against multiple respiratory

pathogens, including influenza, its very high barrier to resistance and a long-acting formulation
that permits a single subcutaneous injection6, 7.

Study imitations include the small sample size, although clearance rates in those with high
viral loads were consistent with the power calculations. Based on viral load and antibody data at
the baseline visit, several participants were likely clearing the infection, an observation reported
in other COVID-19 outpatient studies18. The benefit of treatment was more pronounced in the
group with a high baseline viral load, who were earlier in their course of infection. Early treatment
would be optimal, or alternatively introduction of quantitative assays or calibrated qualitative tests
for COVD-19 diagnosis and risk stratification could be used to identify those most likely to benefit
from therapy. As a Phase II trial, the study was not powered to showed differences in transmission,
which are very hard to document, or hospitalization, which would require a larger study enriched
for those at high risk of complications. However, as a first step to confirm efficacy, viral clearance
is a key relevant endpoint. There were more Black participants in the placebo group, a population
with reduced responsiveness to Type I interferon for treatment of viral hepatitis. However, there
were similar proportions with the treatment-responsive interferon-lambda genotype (TT), which
is strongly associated with response to interferon-alpha for hepatitis C infection and thought to
explain most of the differential response to interferon by race26. No effect of the interferon-lambda
genotype was observed on baseline viral load or response to treatment in the interferon-lambda
arm. A high proportion of eligible individuals declined to participate in the study, likely due to
the listed AE profile, which reflected weekly injections for a year of treatment for hepatitis B and
C infections10, 11. Importantly, the enrolled population was diverse, with individuals born in 25
different countries.

In conclusion, this is among the first antiviral therapies to show benefit among outpatients
with COVID-19. Peginterferon-lambda accelerated viral clearance, particularly in those with high
baseline viral load. This treatment may have potential to avert clinical deterioration, shorten the
duration of infectiousness and limit required isolation time, with significant public health and
societal impact.
