Abstract
Background In December 2019, human infection with a novel coronavirus, known as
SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China. The mortality of critical illness was high in Wuhan.
Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of Wuhan is scarce.
We aimed to provide the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of the critically ill patients
with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Guangdong Province.
Methods In this multi-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled critically ill
patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in
Guangdong Province. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory findings, comorbidities,
treatments, and prognosis were collected. Data were compared between patients with and without
intubation.
Results Forty-five critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were identified in 7 ICUs in
Guangdong Province. The mean age was 56.7 years, and 29 patients (64.4%) were men. The most
common symptoms at the onset of illness were high fever and cough. Majority of patients
presented with lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Treatment with antiviral drugs
was initiated in all the patients. Thirty-seven patients (82.2%) had developed acute respiratory
distress syndrome, and 13 (28.9%) septic shock. A total of 20 (44.4%) patients required intubation
and 9 (20%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. As of February 28th 2020, only one
patient (2.2%) had died and half of them had discharged of ICU.
Conclusions Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in critical illness is characterized by fever, lymphopenia,
acute respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction. Compared with critically ill patients
infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, the mortality of critically ill patients in Guangdong
Province was relatively low. These data provide some general understandings and experience for
the critical patients with SARS-CoV-2 outside of Wuhan.

Introduction
In December 2019, human infection with a novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, was
confirmed in Wuhan, China, which had spread rapidly through outside of Wuhan and around the
world (1, 2). As of February 28, 2020, a total number of 79,251 patients has been infected in the
mainland of China, with 2,835 (3.58%) deaths according to Chinese Center for Disease Control
and Prevention (CCDC) report. Previous studies have mainly focus on the general epidemiological
findings, clinical presentation, and clinical outcomes of mild and moderated patients with
SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (3-5). Only a recent study had reported the characteristics of critically ill
patients in a single center in Wuhan with 61.5% mortality (6). However, the clinical characteristics
of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) outside of Wuhan have not been described,
especially in Guangdong Province, where by February 28, 2020 more than 1000 people were
confirmed having coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we describe the characteristics
and treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Guangdong Province.
Methods
Study design
This multi-center, retrospective, observational study was designed and conducted by the
First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. There were seven hospitals involved,
including the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Dongguan People’s
Hospital, Foshan First People’s Hospital, the First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University
Medical College, the Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Huizhou Municipal
Central Hospital, Zhongshan City People’s Hospital. The study was approved by the Ethics
Commission of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. The
informed-consent requirement was waived because the study was an observational study and
because of the quarantine of the family members.

tachypnea > 22 breaths/min, labored breathing, use of intercostal muscles, and/or dyspnea at rest)
or required mechanical ventilation (6-9). For the enrolled patients, their living status, intubation,
weaning and ICU, hospital discharge date was confirmed on February 28, 2020.
Data collection
Medical records of critically ill patients in ICU were extracted and sent to the data collection
center in the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. A team of ICU doctors
who had been treating patients with COVID-19 collected and reviewed the data. If information
was not clear, the central working group contacted the doctor responsible for the treatment of the
patient for clarification. Information recorded included demographic data, underlying conditions,
symptoms, and laboratory and chest radiograph findings, comorbidities, intubation rates, ventilator
settings prior to and during ICU therapy.
Definition
Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 related comorbidities were identified, including acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis shock, cardiac injury, acute kidney injury (AKI), liver
dysfunction and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. ARDS was diagnosed according Berlin definition
(10) and sepsis shock was identified by Sepsis-3 definition (11). AKI was identified on the basis
and elevated of serum creatinine (12). Cardiac injury was recognized by increased cardiac
troponin I or electrocardiography abnormalities of nonspecific ST-T wave (13, 14). Liver
dysfunction was defined by aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase greater than 40
U/L (15). Gastrointestinal haemorrhage was identified by a positive fecal or gastric juice occult
blood test (16).
Statistics
Continuous variables were presented as either mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median
with interquartile range (IQR), in accordance with either normal or non-normal distributions. For
categorical variables, the frequency and percentage of patients in each category were calculated.
The differences were assessed between intubated and non-intubated patients with two-sample t
test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test depending on parametric or nonparametric data for continuous
variables and Chi-square test for categorical variables. Spearman correlation coefficient was used
to test the correlations between clinical variables. All analyses were performed using SPSS 23.0

(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A P value < 0.05 (two-sided) was considered statistically
significant.

Results
Demographic, Epidemiologic, and Baseline Characteristics of the Patients
A total of 45 critically ill patients were identified with SARS-CoV-2 infections, the first case
included was confirmed on January 14, 2020, and the last one was confirmed on February 20,
2020. All patients had positive throat swabs of SARS-CoV-2 and bilateral infiltrates on chest
radiographs (Figure 1) and were admitted to ICUs.
The mean age of the patients was 56.7 years (SD, 15.4); 29 (64.4%) were men. A total of 26
(57.8%) patients had at least one preexisting conditions, including hypertension (46.7%) and
diabetes (28.9%). Thirty six patients had a history of exposure to Hubei Province and 26 (57.8%)
had exposure to patients with confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, 19 (42.2%)
patients had exposure to a familial cluster.
Clinical Characteristics and Laboratory Findings
The most common symptoms were fever (86.7%), cough (71.1%) and dyspnoea (64.4%).
The median time from onset of symptoms to ICU admission was 10 (IQR, 8-13) days. The median
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and Sequential Organ Failure
Assessment (SOFA) score of all patients at ICU admission was 14(8-18) and 4.0 (3.0-6.8),
respectively. A total of 20 patients (44.4%) was intubated within 3 days after ICU admission (table
2).
White cell counts was at a normal range with predominantly neutrophils in intubated patients.
There were 41 patients (91.1%) presented with lymphopenia (lymphocyte < 1.0*109/L).
Compared with non-intubated patients, those intubated showed significant decrease in lymphocyte
(p < 0.001). Elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (normal range, 109-255 U/L) were
observed in 32 of the patients (71.1%). Moreover, intubated patients had higher levels of LDH
than those without intubation (p = 0.0012). Spearman correlation analyses showed that SOFA
score were negatively correlated with lymphocyte count and positively associated with LDH
(Spearman’s rho= -0.57 and 0.51, respectively, P<0.001) (Figure 2). In addition, prothrombin time,
troponin I, creatine kinase, serum creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate, procalcitonin and

potassium were significant increase in patients with intubation, while PaO2/FiO2 ratio,
haemoglobin and platelet count in intubated patients was lower than those without intubation
(Table 2).
Most patients had organ function damage, including 37 (82.2%) with ARDS, 13 (29.9) with
septic shock, 7 (15.6%) with acute kidney injury, 10 (22.2%) with cardiac injury, 17 (37.8%) with
liver dysfunction, 14 (31.1%) with gastrointestinal haemorrhage and 3 (6.7%) with barotrauma.
Secondary infections, including bacterial co-infection and fungal co-infection, were identified in
17 (37.8%) and 12 (26.7%) patients, respectively (table 3).
Treatment in ICU
All patients received antiviral and antibacterial therapy. Antifungal agents were given to 19
(42.2%) patients. A total of 21 (46.7%) patients had received glucocorticoids, 28 (62.2%) with
immunoglobulin and 35 (77.8%) with albumin. Further, convalescent plasma was applied in 6
(13.3%) critically ill patients.
There were 13 (28.9%) patients treated with high-flow nasal cannula, 6 (13.3%) with
non-invasive mechanical ventilation, 20 (44.4%) with invasive mechanical ventilation. For
patients with intubation, tidal volumes of 7.0 mL/kg predicted body weight was applied in
accordance with lung protective ventilation strategy (17). Recruitment maneuvers were
administered in 6 patients (13.3%). A total of 5 patients (11.1%) received prone position
ventilation. In addition, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and continuous renal
replacement therapy (CRRT) was applied in 9 (20.0%) and 4 (8.9%) patients, respectively. There
were 15 (33.3%) patients administrated with vasoconstrictive agents, 19 (42.2%) with sedation
and analgesia and 8 (17.8%) with neuromuscular blocking agents (table 4).
Clinical Outcomes
As of February 28, 2020, one patient had died. Seven patients were successfully weaned from
invasive ventilation. A total of 23 patients (51.1%) have discharged from ICU. Moreover, 11
patients (24.4%) have been recovered and discharged from hospital (table 4).
In order to identify the potential risks for intubation in severe patients with SARS-CoV-2
infection, Chi-square test showed that older (age > 60 years), higher SOFA (> 4), APACHE II (>
15) score and LDH (> 255U/L)and lower lymphocyte (< 0.8*109/L) at ICU admission were at
high risks for intubation.

Discussion
The study presented a multi-center cohort of 45 patients admitted to ICUs for SARS-CoV-2
infection out of Wuhan. The findings showed that the majority of the patients were seriously ill at
ICU admission. Of all included patients, 37 (82.2%) had developed ARDS, 20 (44.4%) required
invasive mechanical ventilation and 9 (20.0%) required ECMO, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2
can cause severe illness.
Our study population might represent most of the clinical characteristics of patients with
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lymphocytopenia occurred in more than 90% of critically ill patients,
which was similar in Wuhan cohort (6). Moreover, we found that intubated patients had
significantly lower lymphocyte counts than without intubation. Chi-square test had shown lower
lymphocyte counts was more likely to be at high risk for intubation. Spearman correlation
analyses showed that lymphocyte count was significantly negatively correlated with SOFA score
at ICU admission. In fact, lymphocytopenia was common in viral pneumonia, particular in severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (18, 19). It
was reported that lymphocyte < 0.8*109/L was an independent risk factor for 90-day mortality of
viral pneumonia (20). Therefore, lymphocytopenia may reflect the severity of SARS-CoV-2
infection. Dynamic monitoring lymphocyte would be of clinical benefit for intensive caring the
critical illness.
Although antiviral drugs, including osehamivir and ribavirin had been applied to our patients,
to date no effective antiviral to treat COVID-19 has been identified. The current approach to
clinical management is general supportive care supplemented with critical care and organ support
when necessary. It has been suggested that the administration of high-titer anti-influenza immune
plasma derived from convalescent or immunized individuals may be clinically beneficial for the
treatment of SARS, MERS and seasonal influenza (21-23). Convalescent plasma was a potential
treatment in coronavirus infection and suggested using in COVID-19 (24). Therefore,
convalescent plasma of COVID-19 was applied in 6 patients (13.3%) and no transfusion reactions
occurred in our cohort. However, according to our data, at this point, our findings could not

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030668; this version posted March 6, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

provide valuable information in the efficacy of convalescent plasma in critically ill patients with
SARS-CoV-2 infection due to limited sample sizes, short time observation and lack of randomized
controlled group. Thus, treatment of current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particular in
critical illness, via convalescent plasma should be carefully considered before well-designed
clinical trials are conducted.
According to Berlin definition, a total of 37 (82.2%) patients had developed ARDS. The
respiratory distress and hypoxemia were difficult to treat with an overall hospital mortality of 46.1%
in severe ARDS according Lung Safe Study (25). In our cohort, 20 patients (44.4%) received
invasive mechanical ventilation. Recruitment maneuvers, prone position ventilation, CRRT and
ECMO were also applied for management of ARDS. In addition, many of our patients developed
extrapulmonary organ dysfunction including sepsis shock, acute liver dysfunction, and acute renal
injury. As of February 28, 2020, the mortality of our critically ill cases of COVID-19 were 2.2%
(1 of 45) in our cohort, which was lower than those (61.5%, 32 of 52) in Wuhan. The outbreak of
SARS-CoV-2 led to more than 65,000 infected patients in Wuhan (CCDC report on February 28,
2020). The massive infux of patients, inadequately protective clothing and medical personnel,
particularly in critical care resources, may account for the unacceptable high mortality in Wuhan.
In contrast, protective clothing and medical personnel could cover the relative less patients in
Guangdong Province. In addition, a well design Web-based video consultation system for
critically ill patients with COVID-19 was established and applied across different cities in
Guangdong Province. Then specialists in critical care medicine could share their experience and
help the management of the critical illness in a remote way across hospitals and cities. Moreover,
aggressive treatments and intensive care were applied for the severe patients, including
convalescent plasma, invasive mechanical ventilation, CRRT, ECMO. Therefore, the mortality
was relatively lower in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Guangdong Province.
Limitation
Our study has several limitations. Firstly, only 45 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were
included from Guangdong Province. It might be that more clinical features related to those
critically illness will be identified, if other provinces get involved. Secondly, at the time of study
submission, half of the patients had not been discharged from ICU, so we are unable to estimate
either ICU stay, ventilation free day, the case fatality rate or the predictors of fatality.

Conclusions
Compared with the ICU mortality of patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection in Wuhan, those of
patients from Guangdong Province in our study had lower mortality (1 of 45, 2.2%). Currently, it
is necessary for intensively supporting and carefully monitoring of the critical illness before
effective drugs and vaccines to be developed against SARS-Cov-2 infection.
