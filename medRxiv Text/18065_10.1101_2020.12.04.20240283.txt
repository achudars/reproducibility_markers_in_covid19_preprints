11

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can spread from symptomatic

12

patients with COVID-19, but also from asymptomatic individuals. Therefore, robust surveillance

13

and timely interventions are essential for the control of virus spread within the community. In this

14

regard the frequency of testing and speed of reporting, but not the test sensitivity alone, play a

15

crucial role. In order to reduce the costs and meet the expanding demands in real-time RT-PCR

16

(rRT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2, complementary assays, such as rapid antigen tests, have

17

been developed. Rigorous analysis under varying conditions is required to assess the clinical

18

performance of these tests and to ensure reproducible results. We evaluated the sensitivity and

19

specificity of a recently licensed rapid antigen test using 137 clinical samples in two institutions.

20

Test sensitivity was between 88.2-89.6% when applied to samples with viral loads typically seen

21

in infectious patients. Of 32 rRT-PCR positive samples, 19 demonstrated infectivity in cell culture,

22

and 84% of these samples were reactive with the antigen test. Seven full-genome sequenced

23

SARS-CoV-2 isolates and SARS-CoV-1 were detected with this antigen test, with no cross-

24

reactivity against other common respiratory viruses. Numerous antigen tests are available for

25

SARS-CoV-2 testing and their performance to detect infectious individuals may vary. Head-to-

scalable. It can be helpful in monitoring infection trends and thus has potential to reduce

1. INTRODUCTION

32

Since the beginning of COVID-19 outbreak in December 2020, the global demand for the

33

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing has been steadily

34

increasing. Already back in March 2020, hospitals and laboratories around the world announced

35

their concerns about reagent, consumable material shortages, and limited personal protective

36

equipment. Yet, timely detection and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected cases and identification of

37

their contacts are pivotal to slowing down the pandemic.

38

The main public health strategy during a pandemic relies on robust and easy to perform

39

diagnostic tools that can be used to test large number of samples in a short time. To date the gold

40

standard diagnostic method for SARS-CoV-2 detection [1] is based on real time reverse

41

transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) technology which has been promptly implemented by the World

42

Health Organization (WHO) [2], Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [3] protocols,

43

and a number of commercial assays [4]. The SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR has high specificity and

44

sensitivity [5, 6]. However, the type and quality of the patient specimen [7, 8], stage of the disease,

45

and the degree of viral replication and/or clearance have an impact on the test outcome [9]. These

46

factors are critical not only for PCR-based but also for other diagnostic test systems aiming to

47

detect the presence of the virus. Hence interpreting a test result for SARS-CoV-2 depends on the

48

accuracy of the test, but the prevalence and the estimated risk of disease before testing should

49

also be taken into consideration.

50

In many countries SARS-CoV-2 testing is extended to asymptomatic population, e.g. in

51

schools, airports, nursing-homes, and workplaces. This leads to a growing gap between the large

52

number of demand and the laboratory capacities to preform rRT-PCR tests, especially in

53

developing countries. Despite high specificity and sensitivity, rRT-PCR has a disadvantage in point

54

of care testing, because it usually requires professional expertise, expensive reagents and

55

specialized equipment. Therefore, alternative assays, such as rapid antigen detection tests, which

56

can also detect the presence of the virus directly in respiratory samples, have been developed [4]

57

and tested by different groups [10-14]. However, it is vital to determine the sensitivity, specificity

58

of such tests relative to standard rRT-PCR in order to identify the ideal circumstances that their

59

application would be beneficial.

60

This study was performed to evaluate a novel antigen test produced by R-Biopharm for

61

the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in different specimens and to identify its limitations and potential

62

usage. Different types of materials and verification analysis were used by two institutions

63

independently to assure the reproducibility of the testing and to analyze the potential caveats.

64
65

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS

66

2.1 Specimen collection

67

At the Institute of Virology, Charité Berlin stored specimens taken after routine diagnostic were

68

used with no extra procedures required for the study. Cell culture supernantants of respiratory

69

viruses other than SARS-CoV-2 were available at the institute of virology, Charite through a EVD-

70

LabNet EQA (https://www.evd-labnet.eu/; Fischer/Mögling, unpublished data).

71

At the Institute of Virology, Frankfurt, the clinical samples were collected from subjects as part of

72

registered protocols. Combined oropharyngeal/nasal swabs were collected, stored in 2 ml PBS at

73

4°C and processed for further analysis within 24 hours.

74
75

2.2 Cell culture and virus stocks

76

Caco-2 (human colon carcinoma) were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM)

77

supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). 100 IU/mL of penicillin and 100 g/mL of

78

streptomycin. All culture reagents were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis. MO. USA). The Caco-

79

2 cells were originally obtained from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany, no.: ACC 169) differentiated

80

by serial passaging and selected for high permissiveness to virus infection. Caco-2 cells were

81

infected with different viral isolates (FFM1-FFM7) [15] at an MOI 0.1. Cell culture supernatant was

82

harvested 48 h after infection, precleared at 2000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. Aliquots of

83

virus particle containing supernatant were kept at -80°C.

84
85

2.3 Detection of infectious virus in cell culture

86

Of the swab-dilution, 500 µL were mixed with 1.5 ml of MEM containing 1% FCS (Sigma-Aldrich;

87

St. Louis, Missouri, USA), 7.5 µg/ml Amphotericin B, and 0.1 mg/ml Primocin, (InvivoGen; San

88

Diego, California, USA). Swab-inoculums were transferred to Caco-2 cells seeded in 5.5 cm2

89

culture tubes. Cytopathogenic effect (CPE) was assessed daily for up to seven days or until cell

90

lysis occurred.

91
92

2.4 Rapid Antigen Test

93

Rapid antigen test was provided by R-Biopharm. Test was performed according to the

94

manufacturer’s recommendations and evaluated visually by four or six-eye principle. Briefly,

95

samples were vortexed for 20 sec. 50 µl from Solution A (blue) and B (yellow) were dispensed in

96

clean 1.5 ml reaction tubes which leads to green coloring. Immediately 50 µl of the test samples

97

were added to the reaction mixture. Samples were then mixed briefly and incubated for 10 min at

98

room temperature. Test strips were placed in to mixture vertically to allow absorption. Test results

99

were evaluated after 10 min. Intensities of the test bands were compared to control band

100

categorized as follows: +++ (test band intensity stronger than the control), ++ (test and control

101

bans intensity are similar), + (test band intensity is weaker than the control). Antigen testing for

102

viable SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 cell culture supernatants was performed in a BSL-3

103

laboratory.

106

At the Institute of Virology, Charité Berlin, stored samples (swab resuspended in 1.5 mL of

107

phosphate-buffered saline) were anonymized before testing. After thawing at RT all samples were

108

analyzed by antigen test and rRT-PCR in parallel. RNA extraction for rRT-PCR was done by using

109

the MagNA Pure 96 system, using 100 μl of sample, eluted in 100 μl. rRT-PCR was done as

110

published previously [1].

111

At the Institute of Virology in Frankfurt the SARS-CoV-2 test (Cobas, Roche, Basel, Switzerland)

112

was performed on the rRT-PCR automated Cobas 6800 system. Of the swab-dilution, 1000 µl

113

aliquots were mixed with lysis buffer (1:1 ratio) and 500 μL aliquots were transferred to barcoded

114

secondary tubes, loaded on the Cobas 6800 system, and tested with Cobas SARS-CoV-2 master

115

mix containing an internal RNA control and primer-probe sets towards ORF1 and E-gene

116

according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

117

Within seven days of virus inoculation using clinical sample material, culture supernatant was

118

collected to perform rRT-PCR in order to confirm productive virus replication. RNA was isolated

119

from 100 µL cell culture supernatant using the QIAcube HT instrument and QIAamp 96 Virus

120

QIAcube HT Kit (Qiagen; Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. SARS-

121

CoV-2 RNA was analyzed by rRT- PCR using the Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (New

122

England Biolabs; Ipswich, Massachusetts, USA) and primers targeting RNA-dependent RNA

123

polymerase (RdRp) [15]. RdRP_SARSr-F2 (GTGARATGGTCATGTGTGGCGG)

124

RdRP_SARSr-R1 (CARATGTTAAASACACTATTAGCATA).

125
126

2.6 Statistical Analysis

127

The number of positive samples were compared two by two contingency table. The agreement

128

between the antigen test and rRT‐PCR techniques was evaluated using the Cohen’s weighted

129

kappa index (K value) [16]. K value interpretations were categorized as follows: <0.20 is poor,

130

0.21- 0.40 is fair, 0.41-0.60 is moderate agreement, 0.61- 0.80 is substantial agreement and 0.81-

131

1.00 is almost perfect agreement [17].

3. RESULTS

139

Rapid antigen test sensitivity and specificity were evaluated by two independent institutions

140

using various number of clinical samples. rRT-PCR was used as a reference test system. We

141

deemed individuals to be uninfected with SARS-CoV-2 when a negative result was obtained by

142

rRT-PCR.

152

(test band intensity stronger than the control), ++ (test and control bans intensity are similar), +

153

(test band intensity is weaker than the control).

154

In the Institute of Virology, Charité, Berlin, a total of 67 stored patient samples were

155

available for the study. Of these, 58 were rRT-PCR positive with cycle threshold (cT) range

156

between 18.77-40 corresponding to 2.5x109 -1380 RNA genome copies/ml (Table S1),

157

representing 86.6% (58/67) of the clinical samples analyzed (Figure 1A). When the rRT-PCR

158

results were used as a reference, the antigen test diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection status with a

159

sensitivity of 77.6% (45/58) and a specificity of 100% (9/9) (Table 1). After re-evaluating the data

160

based on the acceptable analytic sensitivity and limit of detection suggested by WHO [18], we

161

identified 48 samples with ≥106 RNA genome copies/ml. Rapid antigen test performed with 89.6%

162

sensitivity for this sample set (Table S1). Of these, 40 samples had ~2.23x106 or more RNA

163

genome copies/ml and reacted positive with the antigen test (Table 1). In contrast samples with

164

less than 7.63x105 RNA copies/ml were negative (Figure 1A, Table S1). Cohen’s weighted kappa

165

value of 0.482 indicated moderate agreement between the rRT-PCR and the rapid antigen test

166

(Table 2). The overall concordance between the rRT-PCR and the antigen test was 80.6% (54/67).

174

Certain rapid tests may be used at the point-of-care and thus offer benefits for the detection

175

and management of infectious diseases. In order to assess the potential of the rapid antigen test

176

in this context, 70 nasopharyngeal samples freshly collected from individuals living in a shared

177

housing were analyzed head to head by rRT-PCR using Cobas 6800 system, rapid antigen test,

178

and cell culture using Caco-2 cells to determine the infectivity (Institute of Medical Virology,

179

Goethe University, Frankfurt). 45.7% (32/70) of the clinical samples were diagnosed positive for

180

SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR with cT values ranging between 18.01-35.98 (Figure 1B, Table S2).

181

The antigen test diagnosed the infection status with a sensitivity of 50% (16/32) and a specificity

182

of 100% (Table 3). Re-evaluating the data based on the limit of detection, sensitivity was

183

determined to be 88.2% for samples with cT values <28, and it was reduced in the group of

184

samples with cT values ≥ 28 (6.7%) (Table 3). Cohen’s weighted kappa value of 0.521 indicated

185

moderate agreement between rRT-PCR and the rapid antigen test (Table 4). The overall

186

concordance between the rRT-PCR and the antigen test was 77.1% (54/70) (Table 4).

187

rRT-PCR is a highly sensitive method to detect viral RNA molecules from clinical samples.

188

However, viral RNA can persist in different body parts and can be detected in specimens for much

189

longer than the presence of viable virus [19]. Thus demonstration of infectivity on permissive cell

190

lines in vitro is a more reliable surrogate for infectivity and virus transmission. Therefore, we

attempted virus isolation by inoculating rRT-PCR positive samples in Caco-2 cells. Cytopathic

192

changes were monitored daily by microscopy for a week and subsequently aliquots of culture

193

supernatant were tested to verify viral RNA copies (Table S2). For samples that are positive for

194

both antigen test and rRT-PCR (16/32, cT 18.01-28.45), we observed cytopathic effects (CPE) in

195

cell culture 1-3 days after inoculation (Figure 1B, Table S2). Three samples that had a negative

196

result in the antigen test, but were positive by rRT-PCR (cT values 26.69, 30.12, and 32.13)

197

displayed CPE as well. Other 13 antigen-test negative samples with higher cT values (indicating

198

lower viral load) between 28.34-34.12 were not infectious in cell culture. Interestingly, one sample

199

with a relatively low cT value 25.53, did not show any CPE in cell culture and was also negative

for the antigen test (Table S2).

of six 10-fold dilutions were prepared in PBS. The antigen test was performed and evaluated

220

immediately (Figure 3A). In parallel, aliquots of the dilutions were mixed with lysis buffer used for

221

RNA extraction to inactivate the virus. rRT-PCR was performed for two different gene targets

222

ORF1 and E-gene that resulted in similar cT values (Figure 3B, Table S3). 10-fold serial dilutions

223

led to ~3 cT difference in rRT-PCR for each set as anticipated. According to our results the limit

224

of detection was between 100-560 RNA copies/ml which is in line with the manufacturer’s findings.

225

We previously identified RG203KR mutations in FFM3, FFM4 and FFM6 and SL mutation in

226

FFM1 within the nucleocapsid protein coding region [15]. According to GISAID classification the

227

GR clade, carrying the combination of Spike D614G and nucleocapsid RG203KR mutations, is

228

currently the most common representative of the SARS-CoV-2 population worldwide [20]. Our

229

results suggest that the presence of the RG203KR mutation did not interfere with the antigen test

230

performance.

4. DISCUSSION

241

In this study we validated the assay performance of a recently approved rapid antigen test

242

in two independent institutions using a total of 137 clinical samples. Although the test specificity

243

was 100% for this particular sample set, overall sensitivity was low (50-77.6%), yet re-analyzing

244

samples with higher viral loads showed good correlation (88.2-89.6%). Previous studies reported

245

that lower cT values are associated with higher viral culture positivity [21, 22]. There is currently

246

no direct evidence whether cell culture positivity or higher viral load correlates with contagiousness

247

of an individual, however, it is commonly recognized as the surrogate of infectivity [23]. Since an

248

important aspect of using point-of-care testing is to able to identify infected individuals who are

249

infectious and can potentially transmit the virus, we performed correlation analysis within a group

250

of clinical samples tested. 19 out of 32 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals were positive in cell

251

culture. The antigen test detected 16 out of 19 these (84%). In contrast 43.7% (14/32) of the

252

samples were not infectious in cell culture, yet positive by rRT-PCR, probably due to persisting

253

genomic and subgenomic viral RNA within the collected sample. We detected an excess amount

254

of viral RNA in cell culture supernatants due to high replication capacity of the virus in permissive

255

cells, despite a negative antigen test result. This might explain the cT discrepancy between the

256

cell culture supernatant and clinical samples. Limited clinical sample size is the major limitation of

257

this study. Future efforts should aim to monitor frequent sampling of larger groups and to compare

258

different rapid antigen tests, different sampling sites along with infectivity correlation in cell culture.

259

Our results suggest that the rapid antigen test can detect SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals

260

with high viral loads and has potential in determining highly contagious individuals. Despite low

261

analytic sensitivity, rapid antigen tests are inexpensive and therefore can be used frequently for

262

detecting infected individuals who are asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and without known or

263

suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 [24]. They can be beneficial in congregate settings, such as

264

a long-term care facility or a correctional facility, workplace, or a school testing its students, faculty,

265

and staff. Rapid antigen tests probably perform best during the early stages of SARS-CoV-2

266

infection when the viral load is higher.
