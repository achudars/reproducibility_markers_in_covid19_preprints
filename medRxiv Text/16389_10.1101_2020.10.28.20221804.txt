ABSTRACT

25

Background. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes

26

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), a respiratory illness with influenza-like symptoms that can

27

result in hospitalization or death. We investigated human genetic determinants of COVID-19 risk

28

and severity in 455,838 UK Biobank participants, including 2,003 with COVID-19.

29

Methods. We defined eight COVID-19 phenotypes (including risks of infection, hospitalization

30

and severe disease) and tested these for association with imputed and exome sequencing variants.

31

Results. We replicated prior COVID-19 genetic associations with common variants in the 3p21.31

32

(in LZTFL1) and 9q34.2 (in ABO) loci. The 3p21.31 locus (rs11385942) was associated with

33

disease severity amongst COVID-19 cases (OR=2.2, P=3x10-5), but not risk of SARS-CoV-2

34

infection without hospitalization (OR=0.89, P=0.25). We identified two loci associated with risk

35

of infection at P<5x10-8, including a missense variant that tags the e4 haplotype in APOE

36

(rs429358; OR=1.29, P=9x10-9). The association with rs429358 was attenuated after adjusting for

37

cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s disease status (OR=1.15, P=0.005). Analyses of rare

38

coding variants identified no significant associations overall, either exome-wide or with (i) 14

39

genes related to interferon signaling and reported to contain rare deleterious variants in severe

40

COVID-19 patients; (ii) 36 genes located in the 3p21.31 and 9q34.2 GWAS risk loci; and (iii) 31

41

additional genes of immunologic relevance and/or therapeutic potential.

42

Conclusions. Our analyses corroborate the association with the 3p21.31 locus and highlight that

43

there are no rare protein-coding variant associations with effect sizes detectable at current sample

44

sizes. Our full analysis results are publicly available, providing a substrate for meta-analysis with

45

results from other sequenced COVID-19 cases as they become available. Association results are

46

available at https://rgc-covid19.regeneron.com .

INTRODUCTION

49

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered in Wuhan,

50

China in late 2019 [1] and causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2]. COVID-19

51

symptoms range from flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough and headaches to respiratory failure,

52

acute immune responses and death [3]. It is estimated that most infected individuals display few,

53

if any, symptoms [4, 5]. As of October 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in >41 million

54

individuals and to be associated with >1.1 million deaths worldwide. Known risk factors include

55

male sex, older age, ancestry, obesity, cardiovascular and kidney disease, chronic obstructive

56

pulmonary disease (COPD) and dementia [6-9], among others.

57

Studying host genetic variation among individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 holds the

58

potential to identify mechanisms that influence disease severity and outcomes. Akin to IFNGR1,

59

STAT1, TLR7 and other genetic immune deficiencies that predispose to early-onset severe

60

infections [10-15], this information may help identify individuals at high risk of SARS-CoV-2

61

infection who should be prioritized for disease prevention strategies, including vaccination or

62

monoclonal antibody treatments [16, 17]. Further, understanding host mechanisms that provide

63

protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection or that modulate disease severity might guide the

64

development of treatment efforts, in the same way that CCR5 variation and HIV infection [18], or

65

FUT2 variation and infection by certain strains of norovirus [19], helped identify therapeutic

66

strategies and targets for these diseases.

67

Since the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, host genetic analysis of common genetic

68

variation among SARS-CoV-2 patients identified two genome-wide significant loci, one at

69

3p21.31 spanning at least six genes (including SLC6A20 and LZTFL1) and a second at 9q34.2 in

70

the ABO locus [20, 21]. The first locus has been consistently replicated in additional studies [21,

3

71

22], while the association at the ABO locus remains contentious. In addition to these genome-wide

72

association studies (GWAS), two studies suggest that rare deleterious variants in genes related to

73

interferon signaling may be implicated in more extreme clinical outcomes [14, 23]. However, to

74

date, there has been no assessment of the contribution of rare genetic variation to COVID-19

75

disease susceptibility or severity through large population-based exome-wide association analyses.

76

To identify rare coding variants associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, we

77

evaluated clinical data derived from quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) tests for

78

SARS-CoV-2, together with anonymized electronic health records and death registry data for both

79

COVID-19 patients and other individuals in the UK Biobank study. We first analyzed imputed

80

data for 455,838 individuals (2,003 with COVID-19), including a deep dive into the unequivocal

81

3p21.31 locus as a positive control, to calibrate our susceptibility and severity phenotypes with

82

those used in other COVID-19 GWAS. We then analyzed exome sequencing data for a subset of

83

424,183 individuals (1,865 with COVID-19) to investigate disease associations with individual

84

rare variants and rare variant-aggregated gene-burden tests. In addition to an agnostic exome-wide

85

search for genetic risk factors, we also focused on 81 specific genes of interest (i) with a known

86

role in interferon signaling and recently observed to contain rare deleterious variants in patients

87

with severe COVID-19 [14, 23]; (ii) near two common risk variants for COVID-19 identified by

88

GWAS [20]; or (iii) of immunologic relevance and/or therapeutic potential.

89

This study represents the largest exome-sequencing study of COVID-19 performed to date.

90

Expanded analyses, particularly among individuals disproportionally affected by SARS-CoV-2,

91

are essential to help identify human genetic determinants of disease risk and identify therapeutic

92

avenues for the treatment of COVID-19.

METHODS

95
96

Study participants

97

We studied the host genetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in participants of the UK Biobank study,

98

which took place between 2006 and 2010 and includes approximately 500,000 adults aged 40-69

99

at recruitment [24]. In collaboration with UK health authorities, the UK Biobank has made

100

available regular updates on COVID-19 status for all participants, including results from four main

101

data types: qPCR test for SARS-CoV-2, anonymized electronic health records, primary care and

102

death registry data. We report results based on the 12 September 2020 data refresh and excluded

103

from the analysis 28,547 individuals with a death registry event prior to 2020.

104
105

COVID-19 phenotypes used for genetic association analyses

106

Using the data types outlined above, we grouped UK Biobank participants into three broad

107

COVID-19 disease categories (Table 1): (i) positive – those with a positive qPCR test for SARS-

108

CoV-2 or a COVID-19-related ICD10 code (U07), hospitalization or death; (ii) negative – those

109

with only negative qPCR test results for SARS-CoV-2 and no COVID-19-related ICD10 code

110

(U07), hospitalization or death; and (iii) unknown – those with no qPCR test result and no COVID-

111

19-related ICD10 code (U07), hospitalization or death. We then used these broad COVID-19

112

disease categories, in addition to hospitalization and disease severity information, to create eight

113

COVID-19-related phenotypes for genetic association analyses, as detailed in Table 2.

114
115

Array genotyping and imputation

116

DNA samples from participants of the UK Biobank study were genotyped as described previously

117

[24] using the Applied Biosystems UK BiLEVE Axiom Array (N=49,950) or the closely related

118

Applied Biosystems UK Biobank Axiom Array (N=438,427). Genotype data for variants not

119

included in the arrays were then inferred using three reference panels (Haplotype Reference

120

Consortium, UK10K and 1000 Genomes Project phase 3) as described previously [24].

121
122

Exome sequencing

123

Sample Preparation and Sequencing. Genomic DNA samples normalized to approximately 16

124

ng/ul were transferred to the Regeneron Genetics Center from the UK Biobank in 0.5ml 2D matrix

125

tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored in an automated sample biobank (LiCONiC

126

Instruments) at -80°C prior to sample preparation. Exome capture was completed using a high-

127

throughput, fully-automated approach developed at the Regeneron Genetics Center. Briefly, DNA

128

libraries were created by enzymatically shearing 100ng of genomic DNA to a mean fragment size

129

of 200 base pairs using a custom NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA library prep kit (New England

130

Biolabs) and a common Y-shaped adapter (Integrated DNA Technologies) was ligated to all DNA

131

libraries. Unique, asymmetric 10 base pair barcodes were added to the DNA fragment during

132

library amplification with KAPA HiFi polymerase (KAPA Biosystems) to facilitate multiplexed

133

exome capture and sequencing. Equal amounts of sample were pooled prior to overnight exome

134

capture, approximately 16 hours, with a slightly modified version of IDT’s xGen probe library;

135

supplemental probes were added to capture regions of the genome well-covered by a previous

136

capture reagent (NimbleGen VCRome), but poorly covered by the standard xGen probes (design

137

bed file available by request). Captured fragments were bound to streptavidin-coupled Dynabeads

138

(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and non-specific DNA fragments removed through a series of stringent

139

washes using the xGen Hybridization and Wash kit according to the manufacturer’s recommended

140

protocol (Integrated DNA Technologies). The captured DNA was PCR amplified with KAPA

141

HiFi and quantified by qPCR with a KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems). The

142

multiplexed samples were pooled and then sequenced using 75 base pair paired-end reads with

143

two 10 base pair index reads on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform using S2 or S4 flow cells.

144
145

Variant calling and quality control. Sample read mapping and variant calling, aggregation and

146

quality control were performed via the SPB protocol described in Van Hout et al. [25]

147

(https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/UKB-50k-Exome-Sequencing-Data-

148

Release-July-2019-FAQs.pdf). Briefly, for each sample, NovaSeq WES reads are mapped with

149

BWA MEM to the hg38 reference genome. Small variants are identified with WeCall and reported

150

as per-sample gVCFs. These gVCFs are aggregated with GLnexus into a joint-genotyped, multi-

151

sample VCF (pVCF). SNV genotypes with read depth less than seven (DP < 7) and indel genotypes

152

with read depth less than ten (DP < 10) are changed to no-call genotypes. After the application of

153

the DP genotype filter, a variant-level allele balance filter is applied, retaining only variants that

154

meet either of the following criteria: (i) at least one homozygous variant carrier or (ii) at least one

155

heterozygous variant carrier with an allele balance greater than the cutoff (AB >= 0.15 for SNVs

156

and AB >= 0.20 for indels).

157
158

Identification of low-quality variants from exome-sequencing using machine learning. Briefly, we

159

defined a set of positive control and negative control variants based on: (i) concordance in

160

genotype calls between array and exome sequencing data; (ii) mendelian inconsistencies in the

161

exome sequencing data; (iii) differences in allele frequencies between exome sequencing batches;

162

(iv) variant loadings on 20 principal components derived from the analysis of variants with a

163

MAF<1%. The model was then trained on 30 available WeCall/GLnexus site quality metrics,

164

including, for example, allele balance and depth of coverage. We split the data into training (80%)

165

and test (20%) sets. We then performed a grid search with 5-fold cross-validation on the training

166

set and applied the model with highest accuracy to the test set. Out of 15 million variants in the

167

exome target region, 1 million (6.5%) were identified as low-quality and excluded from the

168

analysis. Similarly, we identified and removed 6 million out of 21 million variants (28.6%) in the

169

buffer region.

170
171

Gene burden masks. Briefly, for each gene region as defined by Ensembl [26], genotype

172

information from multiple rare coding variants was collapsed into a single burden genotype, such

173

that individuals who were: (i) homozygous reference (Ref) for all variants in that gene were

174

considered homozygous (RefRef); (ii) heterozygous for at least one variant in that gene were

175

considered heterozygous (RefAlt); (iii) and only individuals that carried two copies of the

176

alternative allele (Alt) of the same variant were considered homozygous for the alternative allele

177

(AltAlt). We did not phase rare variants; compound heterozygotes, if present, were considered

178

heterozygous (RefAlt). We did this separately for four classes of variants: (i) predicted loss of

179

function (pLoF), which we refer to as an “M1” burden mask; (ii) pLoF or missense (“M2”); (iii)

180

pLoF or missense variants predicted to be deleterious by 5/5 prediction algorithms (“M3”); (iv)

181

pLoF or missense variants predicted to be deleterious by 1/5 prediction algorithms (“M4”). The

182

five missense deleterious algorithms used were SIFT [27], PolyPhen2 (HDIV), PolyPhen2

183

(HVAR) [28], LRT [29], and MutationTaster [30]. For each gene, and for each of these four

184

groups, we considered five separate burden masks, based on the frequency of the alternative allele

185

of the variants that were screened in that group: <1%, <0.1%, <0.01%, <0.001% and singletons

186

only. Each burden mask was then tested for association with the same approach used for individual

187

variants (see below).

188
189

Genetic association analyses

190

Association analyses in the UK Biobank study were performed using the Firth logistic regression

191

test implemented in REGENIE [31], separately for variants derived from array-based imputation

192

and exome sequencing. In this test, Firth’s approach is applied when the p-value from the standard

193

logistic regression score test is below 0.05. As the Firth penalty (i.e. Jeffrey’s invariant prior)

194

corresponds to a data augmentation procedure where each observation is split into a case and a

195

control with different weights, it can handle variants with no minor alleles among cases. With no

196

covariates, this corresponds to adding 0.5 in every cell of a 2x2 table of allele counts versus case-

197

control status.

198

We included in step 1 of REGENIE (i.e. prediction of individual trait values based on the

199

genetic data) variants that were directly genotyped, had a minor allele frequency (MAF) >1%,

200

<10% missingness, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test P-value>10-15 and after linkage-

201

disequilibrium (LD) pruning (1000 variant windows, 100 sliding windows and r2<0.9). The

202

association model used in step 2 of REGENIE included as covariates age, age2, sex, age-by-sex,

203

age2-by-sex, and the first 10 ancestry-informative principle components (PCs) released by the UK

204

Biobank. For the analysis of exome variants, we also included as covariates an indicator for exome

205

sequencing batch and 20 PCs derived from the analysis of exome variants with a MAF between

206

2.6x10-5 (roughly corresponding to a minor allele count [MAC] of 20) and 1%. We did this because

207

previous studies have found that PCs derived from common variants do not adequately correct for

208

fine-scale population structure [32, 33].

209

For imputed variants, we retained association results for variants with both an imputation

210

information score ³0.3 and MAC ³5, and either (i) MAF>0.5% or (ii) a protein-altering

211

consequence (i.e. pLOF, missense or splice variants). For exome sequencing variants, we retained

212

association results for variants with a MAC³5. Association analyses were performed separately

213

for three different ancestries defined based on the array data (African [AFR], European [EUR] and

214

South Asian [SAS]), with results subsequently combined across ancestries using an inverse

215

variance-weighed fixed-effects meta-analysis.

Results availability

218

All genotype-phenotype association results reported in this study are available for browsing using

219

the RGC’s COVID-19 Results Browser (https://rgc-covid19.regeneron.com). Data access and use

220

is limited to research purposes in accordance with the Terms of Use (https://rgc-

221

covid19.regeneron.com/terms-of-use). The COVID-19 Results Browser provides a user-friendly

222

interface to explore genetic association results, enabling users to query summary statistics across

223

multiple cohorts and association studies using genes, variants or phenotypes of interest. Results

224

are displayed in an interactive tabular view ordered by p-value – enabling filtering, sorting,

225

grouping and viewing additional statistics – with link outs to individual GWAS reports, including

226

interactive Manhattan and QQ plots. LocusZoom views of LD information surrounding variants

227

of interest are also available, with LD calculated using the respective source genetic datasets.

228

The data resource supporting the COVID-19 Results Browser is built using a processed

229

version of the raw association analysis outputs. Using the RGC’s data engineering toolkit based in

230

Apache Spark and Project Glow (https://projectglow.io/), association results are annotated,

231

enriched and partitioned into a distributed, columnar data store using Apache Parquet. Processed

RESULTS

239
240

Demographics and health characteristics of study participants

241

Among 473,977 participants of the UK Biobank study who were alive in January 2020, 2,118 were

242

COVID-19 positive, 16,331 were COVID-19 negative and 455,528 had unknown COVID-19

243

status (Table 1). Relative to participants who were COVID-19 negative or unknown (Table 1),

244

COVID-19 positive individuals were more likely to be male, to have African or South Asian

245

ancestry and to have cardiovascular or respiratory co-morbidities (Table 3). These co-morbidities

246

were also observed in analyses stratified by ancestry group (Table 4).

247
248

Genome-wide association study (GWAS) of imputed variants

249

We performed ancestry-specific GWAS for eight COVID-19-related phenotypes, using imputed

250

variants available for a subset of 455,838 individuals (Table 5). These phenotypes captured a

spectrum of disease severity, from COVID-19 cases who did not require hospitalization to those

252

with severe disease (respiratory support or death). Association results are publicly available at

253

https://rgc-covid19.regeneron.com and main findings summarized below. The genomic inflation

254

factor (lGC) was close to 1 for most analyses (Supplementary Table 1).

Association with variants reported in previous COVID-19 GWAS. Recently, Ellinghaus et al. [20]

257

performed a GWAS comparing 1,610 cases with a PCR-positive test for SARS-CoV-2 and

258

respiratory failure, against 2,205 controls with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status (mostly blood

259

donors), all from Spain or Italy. Two loci reached genome-wide significance in that study: (i)

260

3p21.31, near the LZTFL1 gene (rs11385942, OR=1.77 for the GA allele; 95% CI=1.48-2.11;

261

P=1.1x10-10); and (ii) 9q34.2, near the ABO gene (rs657152, OR=1.39 for the A allele; 95%

262

CI=1.20-1.47; P=4.9x10-8) [20]. Both loci were recently replicated in a larger GWAS [21], with

263

the former also replicated in a GWAS of severe COVID-19 patients in the UK [22]. We found a

264

nominally significant and directionally consistent association with both variants in the European-

265

specific analysis of the phenotype COVID-19 positive vs. COVID-19 negative or unknown

266

(Figure 1). For the 3p21.31 locus (Figure 1A), we observed the largest effect with risks of

267

hospitalization (OR=1.69; 95% CI=1.25-2.28; P=6x10-4) and severe disease (OR=2.29; 95%

268

CI=1.56-3.35; P=2x10-5) amongst COVID-19 cases. In contrast, there was no association with the

269

phenotype COVID-19 positive and not hospitalized vs. COVID-19 negative or unknown

270

(OR=0.87; 95% CI=0.71-1.08; P=0.21). These results suggest that variants in this 3p21.31 locus

271

influence COVID-19 severity and not risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

272
273

Significant associations with common variants in ancestry-specific GWAS. Across the eight

274

phenotypes tested, we identified two loci with an association P<5x10-8, both found in the

275

European-specific analysis of the phenotype COVID-19 positive (N=1,797) vs. COVID-19

276

negative or unknown (N=434,038). The first locus was on chromosome 19q13.32; the lead variant

277

was rs429358 (MAF=15%, OR=1.29, CI=1.18-1.40, P=8.9x10-9), a common missense variant

278

(Cys130Arg) that tags the epsilon (e) 4 haplotype in APOE (Figure 2A). This variant has

279

established associations with both Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and coronary artery disease (CAD).

280

In addition, AD and CAD are known risk factors associated with COVID-19, and we observed an

281

enrichment of both diseases amongst COVID-19 positive individuals (Supplementary Table 2).

282

Therefore, we tested if the association between the APOE locus and susceptibility to COVID-19

283

could be confounded by AD or CAD case-control status. When both diseases were added as

284

covariates to the model, we found that the association with rs429358 was significantly attenuated

285

(OR=1.15; 95% CI=1.04-1.26; P=0.005). These results suggest that the association between

286

rs429358 in APOE and COVID-19 risk likely arose because of the enrichment of AD and CAD

287

amongst COVID-19 cases.

288

The second locus was on chromosome 19p13.11, also associated with the phenotype

289

COVID-19 positive vs. COVID-19 negative or unknown. The lead variant was rs117336466

290

(MAF=0.9%; OR=2.16, 95% CI=1.64-2.85, P=4.5x10-8), located in the first intron of TMEM161A

291

(Figure 2B). This variant was not associated with risks of hospitalization (OR=0.60, 95%

292

CI=0.33-1.09, P=0.094) or severe disease (OR=0.58, 95% CI=0.27-1.24, P=0.161) amongst

293

COVID-19 positive cases.

294
295

Genome-wide significant associations in trans-ancestry meta-analysis. Seven of the eight

296

phenotypes were tested in two or more ancestries. For these, we combined results across ancestries

297

using a fixed-effects meta-analysis, but no new loci were identified at P<5x10-8.

298
299

Exome-wide association study of sequenced variants

300

We tested the association between the same eight COVID-19-related phenotypes and exome

301

sequencing variants available for a subset of 424,183 individuals from the UKB study. We tested

302

both single variants and a burden of rare variants in protein-coding genes (see Methods).

304

Exome-wide association results. The lGC for common variants (MAF>0.5%) was close to 1 for

305

most analyses (Supplementary Table 3), while for rare variants (MAF<0.5%) we observed a

306

considerable deflation of test statistics, caused by a large proportion of variants having a MAC of

0 in cases (e.g. 89% of variants in the European-only analysis of COVID-19 positive and

308

hospitalized [N=1,065] vs. COVID-19 negative or unknown [N=403,700]). Overall, when

309

considering both trans- and single-ancestry association analyses, we did not identify any

310

associations with rare coding variants at a P<5x10-8.

311
312

Association results for 14 genes in the anti-viral interferon signaling pathway. Two recent exome

313

sequencing studies of COVID-19 suggested that rare deleterious variants in 14 genes related to

314

interferon signaling may be implicated in more extreme clinical outcomes [14, 23]. Given our

315

larger sample size, we examined whether there was any evidence for association between the

316

COVID-19 hospitalization phenotype (1,184 cases vs. 422,318 controls) and a burden of rare

317

(MAF<0.1%) pLoF variants (M1 burden test) or pLoF plus deleterious missense variants (M3

318

burden test) in these 14 genes. We found no nominal significant associations (P<0.05) with any of

319

the 14 genes (Table 6). Further, these results were unchanged when testing COVID-19 severe

320

cases (N=471), or when restricting the burden tests to include variants with a MAF<1% or

321

singleton variants (Supplementary Table 4). Therefore, in our analysis of the UK Biobank data,

322

we found no evidence for an association between the 14 specific interferon signaling genes and

323

COVID-19 outcomes.

325

Association results for 36 genes located in two risk loci for COVID-19 identified by Ellinghaus et

326

al. [20]. Associations with rare protein-coding variants might help pinpoint target genes of

327

common risk variants identified in GWAS of COVID-19. To address this possibility, we focused

328

on 36 protein-coding genes located within 500 kb of the two common risk variants identified by

329

Ellinghaus et al. [20]: rs11385942 (locus 3p21.31) and rs657152 (locus 9q34.2). Of the 72 gene

330

burden tests performed (36 genes x 2 burden tests, considering variants with MAF<1%), four had

331

a nominal significant association (Supplementary Table 5), including two protective (CCR9 and

332

TSC1) and two predisposing (SARDH and XCR1) associations. However, these associations did

333

not remain significant after correcting for the number of tests performed (all with

334

P>0.05/72=0.0007).

Association results for 31 additional genes of interest. Lastly, we performed the same analysis for

31 genes that are involved in the etiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g. ACE2, TMPRSS2),

338

encode therapeutic targets (e.g. IL6R, JAK2) or have been implicated in other immune or infectious

339

diseases through GWAS (e.g. IL33). After correcting for multiple testing, there were also no

significant associations with a burden of rare deleterious variants for this group of genes

341

(Supplementary Table 6).

343

DISCUSSION

344

Eleven months since the first reported cases of “pneumonia of unknown cause” to the World

345

Health Organization and six months since the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic [34], >41

346

million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. Epidemiological studies

347

have identified groups of individuals at high risk for severe disease, clinical complications and

348

death [8, 9, 35-38]. More recently, studies focusing on host genetics have begun to identify

349

common variants that contribute to heterogeneity in COVID-19 risk and severity [20-22].

350

Our analysis of COVID-19 in the UK Biobank indicates that, consistent with observational

351

studies in the same UK participants [35, 37], COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths skew

352

towards older, male individuals of non-European ancestry. Hypertension, obesity, CAD, type-2

353

diabetes and dementia are among the most frequently reported COVID-19 disease comorbidities

354

[8, 9, 35]. Similarly, after adjusting for age, we observed a 1.7-fold enrichment in both

355

cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s disease among COVID-19 cases in the UK Biobank study.

356

Previous GWAS reported an association between risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and

357

common variants in the 3p21.31 locus [20-22]. We confirmed this association and further showed

358

that this locus affects disease severity but not (or less so) risk of infection. We note, as have others,

359

that the lead variant rs35652899 is in high LD with a lead expression quantitative trait locus

360

(eQTL) for SCL6A20 in lung tissue [39]. The SLC6A20 gene encodes SIT1, a proline transporter

361

expressed in the small intestine, lung, and kidney [40]. SIT1 expression and function is increased

362

via interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor

363

[41]. One intriguing hypothesis is that increased expression of SLC6A20 in the gastrointestinal

364

tract, lung or kidney might promote viral uptake, thus leading to increased risk of severe disease

365

due to pathology in these tissues. Other candidate genes in the region include LZTFL1, which

17

366

encodes a cytoplasmic ciliary transport protein with expression in the lung and implicated in

367

recessive ciliopathies with renal dysfunction as one feature, CXCR6 and CCR9, chemokine

368

receptors which mediate trafficking of T lymphocytes to the lung and GI tract, respectively, and

369

XCR1 on plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which mediates antigen cross presentation, potentially

370

implicating dysregulation of immune cell trafficking and function in severe COVID-19, but further

371

work is required to attribute the purported biological mechanisms of these genes with SARS-CoV-

372

2 infection and disease progression of COVID-19.

373

Ellinghaus et al. [20] first reported an association between common variants in the ABO

374

locus and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, ABO blood groups have been associated

375

with severe COVID-19 [42, 43], with blood group A being associated with increased disease risk.

376

These observations raise the possibility that genes in the ABO locus play a role in COVID-19

377

susceptibility. However, genetic associations at the ABO locus can be confounded by population

378

stratification [44, 45]. Furthermore, the analysis reported by Ellinghaus et al [20] used blood

379

donors (which skew toward type O) as controls, which might have biased the association results

380

at the ABO locus. As such, it is important to determine if the association with the ABO locus is

381

reproducible in independent studies. First, we found no difference in representation of blood types

382

among COVID-19 cases and controls (not shown). Second, although we did observe a directionally

383

consistent and nominally significant association between risk of infection and the published lead

384

variant, when we combined results from the UK Biobank with those from the discovery cohort

385

[20], the association with this variant did not reach genome-wide significance (not shown). Third,

386

we found no evidence for an association between this locus and disease severity. Therefore, it

387

remains unclear whether variants in the ABO locus represent bona fide risk factors for COVID-19.

388

In our GWAS of imputed variants, we identified a genome-wide significant association

389

between risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a variant that tags the e4 haplotype in APOE. Common

390

variants in APOE have been previously associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, independent of

391

CAD, dementia and other comorbidities [46]. However, in contrast to these findings, we found

392

that the association with APOE was significantly attenuated after adjusting for AD and CAD.

393

Similar results were obtained after conditioning on AD alone (not shown). This suggests that the

394

observed association between risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and APOE in our analysis of the UK

395

Biobank was, at least partly, confounded with AD status.

396

We also identified a putative new association between common variants on chromosome

397

19p13.11 and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, this locus was not associated with

398

increased risks of hospitalization or severe disease amongst COVID-19 positive individuals.

399

Replication in independent studies is required to validate the association between 19p13.11 and

400

risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

401

Lastly, we analyzed exome sequence data for a subset of 424,183 individuals in the UK

402

Biobank to test the association between COVID-19 phenotypes and rare variants not captured by

403

array genotyping or imputation. We found no associations at a P<5x10-8 with pLoF variants,

404

missense variants or in gene-burden analyses. We then concentrated on 81 genes of interest,

405

including 14 genes related to interferon signaling [14, 23], 36 genes in two GWAS loci [20] and

406

31 additional genes of immunologic relevance and/or therapeutic potential. After correcting for

407

the number of tests performed, there were no significant associations between the COVID-19

408

hospitalization phenotype and a burden of rare deleterious variants in any of these genes. We are

409

expanding our analysis of exome sequence data to include additional studies and will update results

410

accordingly.

412

At the outset of the pandemic, testing for SARS-CoV-2 was restricted to symptomatic individuals

413

and often performed exclusively at inpatient/outpatient care sites. Thus, this current analysis is

414

likely weighted toward cases with demonstrable COVID-19 symptoms or clinical presentation.

415

Broader analysis of seropositive individuals who were asymptomatic or had infections mild

416

enough to resolve at home will be critical to identify genetic factors that might protect from severe

417

disease, particularly among high-risk groups with comorbidities. Regardless, further genetic

418

studies across ancestry groups will shed more light on human genetic risk factors associated with

419

susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and may point to pathways and approaches for the treatment of

420

COVID-19.
