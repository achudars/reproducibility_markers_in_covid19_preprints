Abstract

42

As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread globally, a significant portion of women have

43

undergone childbirth while possibly infected with the virus and also under social isolation due to

44

hospital visitor restrictions. Emerging studies examined birth outcomes in COVID-19 positive

45

women, but knowledge of the psychological experience of childbirth remains lacking. This study

46

survey concerning childbirth and mental health launched during the first wave of the pandemic in

47

the US. Women reporting confirmed/suspected COVID-19 during childbirth were matched on

48

various background factors with women reporting COVID-19 negative. We found higher

49

prevalence of clinically significant acute stress in birth in COVID-19 positive women. This group

50

was 11 times as likely to have no visitors than matched controls and reported higher levels of pain

51

in delivery, lower newborn weights, and more infant admission to neonatal intensive care units.

52

Visitor restrictions were associated with these birth outcomes. COVID-19 positive women with

53

no visitors were 6 times as likely to report clinical acute stress in birth than COVID-19 positive

54

women with visitors. The findings underscore increased risk for childbirth-induced psychological

55

morbidity in COVID-19-affected populations. As hospitals continue to revise policies concerning

56

visitor restrictions, attention to the wellbeing of new mothers is warranted.

57

Introduction

58

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic’s immense scope and duration has made clear the

59

urgent need to better understand the virus’ physical and psychological impacts on vulnerable

60

populations. From a generational health perspective, perhaps no population’s experience is more

61

critical to understand and safeguard than that of delivering mothers. In the midst of a global public

62

health crisis characterized by a potentially lethal and highly infectious virus, many non-emergency

63

hospital-based health procedures were postponed. Nevertheless, delivering mothers all over the

64

globe were among the very few populations that continued to be treated in hospital settings.

65

A significant portion of them underwent childbirth when they were suspected or confirmed

66

of the novel coronavirus disease. Some may have experienced mild but also severe physical

67

symptoms [1] such as fever, lymphocytopenia, and elevated C-reactive protein [2, 3] in accords

68

with reports that pregnancy may result in acute immune changes and cause a viral illness to be

69

more severe [4]. Many mothers, even if asymptomatic, may have experienced heightened

70

emotional distress surrounding the concern that they might be contracting the virus in the hospital

71

or transmitting it to their infant [5]. Labor and delivery present physical and psychological

72

challenges during normalcy, therefore it is critical to understand the effect of COVID-19 on

73

delivering mothers. At present, the impact of being COVID-19 positive, confirmed or suspected,

74

on the childbirth experience and maternal and neonatal outcomes remains not fully clear.

75

Emerging studies have focused largely on obstetrical and neonatal correlates of COVID-

76

19 infection status. A body of research suggests that there is increased risk for adverse outcomes

77

in pregnant women with COVID-19. In a recent systematic review of nine studies in China, the

78

incidence of preterm births, low birth weight, C-section, and NICU admission were found to be

79

higher in COVID-19 positive cases than in the general population [6]. Likewise, in a second review

80

of 41 cases, higher rates of preterm birth and NICU admission were found in positive pregnancies

81

in comparison with non-positive [7], although other studies did not find differences between

82

affected and non-affected women in maternal and neonatal outcomes [8, 9]. The inclusion of

83

studies with small samples and inappropriate control groups in the reviews above may limit

84

findings and interpretations.

85

An important issue to consider is the subjective experience of childbirth and potential

86

heightened psychological adversity in birth for COVID-19-positive laboring women. Although

87

childbirth is typically considered a happy event, a significant proportion of new mothers report

88

their delivery as highly stressful in samples assessed before the pandemic [10, 11] and childbirth

89

pain as the most agonizing of painful experiences [12]. To the best of our knowledge, no study has

90

examined how giving birth while potentially being ill with the virus may amplify acute traumatic

91

stress responses to childbirth.

92

A salient factor that may influence the childbirth of COVID-19-affected mothers concerns

93

the unique stressor of the pandemic: social isolation. With the goal of reducing infectious

94

exposures to visitors, other patients, the community, and healthcare teams, and in the wake of

95

uncertain and rapidly evolving situations, policies restricting visitors have been implemented to

96

lower the number of people in hospitals. Accordingly, mothers who contracted COVID-19 have

97

faced drastic restrictions on maternal visitors and supportive companions in the delivery room and

98

during the postpartum stay. A significant number of COVID-19-affected mothers may have even

99

experienced childbirth without the emotional support provided by having close friends or family

100

in the room with them [13]. They may also have gone without visitors while being separated from

101

their newborn to reduce additional transmission risks [8]. Continuous support in labor and delivery

102

can improve obstetrical and neonatal outcomes and reduce negative birth perceptions, which has

103

been documented before the pandemic [14, 15]. It may further buffer against traumatic stress in

104

response to birth [10].

105

As the obstetric health risks and benefits in the face of a still poorly understood virus remain

106

unclear [16] and hospitals across the United States continue to evaluate and adjust their visitor

107

policies in light of recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

108

and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), a better understanding of

109

the psychological childbirth experiences in COVID-19 vulnerable mothers, such as those being

110

suspected or confirmed of infection, is warranted. In the writing of this work, visitor prohibitions

111

have been largely lifted in maternity wards. However, those delivering who test positive for

112

COVID-19 may still face social isolation and not be allowed any visitors during their entire

113

hospital stay, underlining the importance of relevant research.

114

To this end, we studied a large sample of women who recently gave birth when COVID-

115

19 was prevalent in the United States, among them 68 women reported suspected or confirmed

116

COVID-19 positive. We matched this group on a wide range of background factors to 68 women

117

who gave birth in the outbreak of the pandemic but were negative for COVID-19. There have been

118

no studies to date that use a comprehensive matched-group analysis that could allow for better

119

understanding of the contribution of COVID-19 positivity to childbirth outcomes while controlling

120

for background factors that increase perinatal adversity. We examined whether being COVID-19

121

positive is associated with stressful psychological experiences of birth as well as obstetrical and

122

neonatal outcomes and whether having no visitors during delivery hospitalization stay was

123

associated with these outcomes.

126

Participants
This study is part of a research project that was launched on April 2nd, 2020, in the midst

127

of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, with the overarching goal of understanding the

128

impact of COVID-19 on childbirth and maternal mental health. Women who had given birth in the

129

last six months were recruited through announcements on our hospital’s research study platform

130

as well as via social media and postpartum professional communities; they were asked to complete

131

an anonymous survey and were informed that by agreeing to complete the survey they are implying

132

their consent to participate in the study. Therefore, all subjects who took the survey consented to

133

the study. Partners Healthcare (Mass General Brigham) Human Research Committee approved the

134

study measures and procedures and granted exemption for this study and the study was carried out

135

in accordance with the approved protocol. The sample in this study was derived from 2,417 women

136

who gave birth since COVID-19 was prevalent in their communities and provided the childbirth

137

date; they were on average two months postpartum. We identified 68 women who reported being

138

COVID-19 positive, suspected or confirmed, during pregnancy and/or childbirth. We then

139

identified a matched control group of 68 women who reported being COVID-19 negative. The

140

groups were matched on demographic factors, primiparity, prior trauma and childbirth history, and

141

prior mental health.

142

In this sample of a total of 136 postpartum women, the vast majority delivered a healthy

143

baby at term (86.8%), had a vaginal delivery (71.3%), and around half (50.7%) were primiparas.

144

The average age of participants was 32 years old. The majority were married (89%), had at least

145

middle-class income (i.e., $100,000 per year, 66.2%), were employed (72.1%), and had at least a

146

college degree (83.1%). Participants resided in the United States (80.0%), in Canada (4.4%),

147

Europe (2.9%), Central/South America (2.9%), Asia (2.9%), and 2.2% in the Caribbean and

148

Middle East. Four participants (2.9%) did not report their geographic location.

149
150

Measures
Acute stress responses to childbirth were assessed with the commonly used Peritraumatic

151

Distress Inventory (PDI) [17]. The PDI is a 13-item self-report with good psychometric properties.

152

It assesses negative emotional responses (e.g., “I felt helpless”; “I thought I might die”)

153

experienced during and/or immediately after a specified traumatic event on a 0 (not at all) to 4

154

(extremely true) scale. In this study, participants rated their responses in regard to their recent

155

childbirth experience. The PDI has been used to assess acute childbirth-related stress in postpartum

156

samples [18]. To define clinically significant acute stress response symptoms, we used the

157

suggested cutoff of 17 [19]. Reliability in the current study was high ( = 0.91).

158

Obstetrical and infant factors concerning recent childbirth were measured with respect to

159

gestational age, medical complications in labor and delivery (yes vs. no), degree of pain in labor

160

and delivery (assessed on a 5-point Likert Scale), sleep deprivation (defined as less than six hours

161

of sleep on the night before childbirth), use of pain medication (yes vs. no), use of induction

162

medication (yes vs. no), and mode of delivery. Additionally, we measured newborn weight (lbs.),

163

newborn biological sex, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission of newborn, skin-to-skin

164

contact after delivery (yes vs. no), rooming-in (yes vs. no) and breastfeeding habits (exclusive,

165

mixed, stopped, or never breastfeeding offered).

166

COVID-19-related restrictions were assessed in regard to visitor policy. Participants were

167

asked whether there were “any visitor restrictions during your hospital stay?”. Response options

168

(no visitors, one visitor, no restrictions) were classified as “No visitors” versus “Other”. We also

169

asked participants whether they were separated from their infant.

170

Background factors pertaining to demographics, prior mental health, and traumatic

171

exposure were used for creating matching study groups. Theses variables included maternal age,

172

education level, marital and employment status, income, race/ethnicity, and primiparity. We also

173

assessed history of mental health problems (i.e., depression, postpartum depression, anxiety,

174

posttraumatic stress disorder), and the number of prior traumatic events (happened or witnessed)

175

with the commonly used Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5) [20] (α = 0.91); as well as

176

stressors in previous pregnancies (defined as miscarriage, stillbirth, or premature delivery).

Data Analysis

182

19 positive and negative women, we conducted a propensity score matching procedure using SPSS

183

PS module [21] (see detailed variables listed in the Methods). The estimation algorithm was

184

logistic regression, the matching algorithm was nearest neighbor matching with caliper of 0.2 as

185

recommended by Austin [22]. An overall balance test [23] was performed to estimate the balance

186

in the matching process.

To create matched groups who share similar background characteristics between COVID-

187

Following the matching procedure, we compared groups in obstetrical factors (sleep

188

deprivation, pain in labor and birth, birth complications, medication for induction and pain, and

189

mode of delivery), infant-related factors (gestational age, NICU admission, weight and sex,

190

breastfeeding, rooming in, and skin-to-skin), COVID-19-related restrictions (separation from

191

newborn and lack of visitors during delivery hospitalization), and psychological experience of

192

birth, namely, acute stress responses in birth. Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests were

193

conducted to assess normality in quantitative outcome scores. Based on these tests, Mann-Whitney

194

U tests were performed to estimate differences between study groups in quantitative measures, and

195

chi-square test for independence of measures (with Fisher’s exact estimation of significance) for

196

estimating differences in categorical measures. Finally, we conducted Kruskal-Wallis tests and

197

chi-square test for independence of measures (with Fisher’s exact estimation of significance) to

198

examine whether no visitors may account for the differences between COVID-19 positive and

199

negative women.

Obstetrical-related factors. COVID-19 positive women reported significantly greater

211

pain in delivery (weak-to-moderate in effect size) than COVID-19 negative women. No group

212

differences were found in sleep deprivation, pain in labor, medical complications, medication for

214

Infant-related factors. A higher percentage of babies of COVID-19 positive women were

215

admitted to the newborn intensive unit of care (OR = 3.72). In addition, COVID-19 positive

216

women gave birth to infants with lower (yet normal) weights than COVID-19 negative women.

217

Fewer COVID-19 positive women were with their newborn in the room during their stay at the

significantly greater pain in delivery (see Figure 1) and delivered infants with lower weights (see

Discussion

273

The COVID-19 pandemic offers a rare opportunity to examine the experience of childbirth

274

under stressful conditions such as social isolation. As infectious disease outbreaks continue, it is

275

critical that we generate new knowledge to inform preparations and guidelines of perinatal care

276

during these outbreaks.

277

Our study sought to examine the childbirth experiences of women who had delivered

278

during peak infection rates of the pandemic and were suspected or confirmed to have contracted

279

COVID-19, a population likely to have undergo labor and delivery while potentially being acutely

280

ill and at the same time subject to drastic hospital restrictions concerning social isolation. We

281

compared women who reported being COVID-19 positive, suspected or confirmed, to women who

282

reported not having contracted the virus but who were similar on a range of background factors

283

such as demographics, prior mental health, and even trauma history. This rigorous matched-control

284

group approach has not been implemented in previous studies and allows for the generation of

285

knowledge on the potential adverse influence of COVID-19 infection status of birth outcomes

286

while controlling for background factors that are associated with COVID-19 infection and negative

287

maternal outcomes.

288

The main study findings show that nearly 50% of suspected or confirmed COVID-19

289

positive women reported clinically significant acute stress symptoms in birth. They were as much

290

as two times more likely to experience acute stress than non-affected women and to perceive higher

291

degrees of pain in childbirth even though no differences were found in factors such as obstetrical

292

complications, medication for pain, or delivery mode between COVID-19 positive and negative

293

cases. These findings underscore how childbirth can become a traumatic experience and evoke an

294

acute stress response for women with the novel coronavirus.

295

We further document increased exposure to salient social stressors surrounding childbirth

296

in affected women. As might be expected, the results reveal that hospital policies enforcing visitor

297

restrictions were frequently implemented with delivering women suspected or confirmed of

298

COVID-19 infection. As much as 25% of COVID-19 positive women had no visitors during their

299

delivery hospitalization stay. This group was 11 times as likely not to be permitted a support person

300

to accompany them than women negative for COVID-19. COVID-19 positive women were also

301

much more likely to experience physical separation from their newborn. In accord with previous

302

studies [7], the newborns were nearly four times as likely to be admitted to the NICU. In the writing

303

of this manuscript, the CDC has updated its guidance and currently recommends rooming-in for a

304

COVID-positive mother and her newborn and acknowledges that the decision should be

305

determined by the family.

306

Our findings reveal that social isolation surrounding childbirth may increase risk for

307

maternal morbidity. We found heightened clinically significant acute stress in COVID-19 positive

308

women who had no visitors. They were 6 times as likely to report acute stress symptoms than

309

COVID-19 affected women who were permitted visitors during their delivery hospitalization. We

310

also found that COVID-19 positive women who did not have a support person experienced greater

311

pain in delivery, delivered newborns with lower weight, and had elevated NICU admission rates.

312

These findings accord with the evidence of emotional comfort and support in birth being associated

313

with improved birth outcomes [14], and suggest how a diminished sense of support may increase

314

maternal stress and subsequent adversity. Psychological traumatic morbidity in birth has been

315

shown to result in maternal mental illness during the postpartum period based on pre-COVID

316

samples [24, 25] and has also been documented in women who gave birth since the pandemic [26].

317

This study’s findings may be useful in informing clinical policies during the COVID-19

318

pandemic. While much attention has been paid to the physical symptoms in mothers with COVID-

319

19, our study emphasizes the importance of considering mothers’ psychological wellness. The

320

findings suggest that increased awareness should be given in labor and delivery and postpartum

321

units to the psychological symptoms surrounding childbirth that may arise in women who are sick

322

with or suspected of having the virus; additionally, the potential emotional liability of not

323

permitting a support person during hospitalization should be noted. While routine screening for

324

traumatic childbirth does not exist in postpartum hospital units, our study suggests that assessment

325

of acute stress responses in delivering mothers who are COVID-19 positive is warranted. Ongoing

326

monitoring of mental health symptoms in this high risk group after hospital discharge is important

327

as those with stable symptoms in accord with routine care are likely to be quickly discharged and

328

face social isolation during the postpartum period, which is considered a time of heightened

329

psychological vulnerability [27, 28].

330

Shortcomings of this study include reliance on anonymous self-report measures that

331

allowed for conducting a study swiftly during the initial heights of the pandemic but not for

332

inclusion of patients’ medical records. We rely on respondents accurately reporting their COVID-

333

19 infection status, and their receiving accurate information from COVID-19 testing protocols at

334

the hospitals where they delivered. Additionally, we do not have information on the severity of

335

respondents’ COVID-19 symptoms, only their infection status. We cannot rule out that acutely ill

336

women were those not permitted visitors. Also, while we used a well-validated measure to assess

337

acute stress which has shown good correspondence with clinician assessments, we did not include

338

diagnostic measures. Retrospective assessments could be prone to recall bias and hence the

339

importance of the use of matched controls. This convenient internet sample introduces a bias

340

towards women from a certain socioeconomic class.

341

Conclusion

342

In conclusion, we find that confirmed or suspected COVID-19 positive women experience

343

increased psychological morbidity surrounding childbirth compared to delivering women without

344

COVID-19. We find that COVID-19 positive women experience increased levels of pain during

345

delivery and give birth to newborns of lower weight which are more likely to be separated from

346

their mothers and sent to the NICU. This increased adversity appears especially heightened in

347

cases where a support person is not allowed in the maternity unit. As hospitals around the world

348

continue to update their delivery protocols for COVID-19 positive women and determine risk and

349

benefits of visitor restriction policies, more research is needed to optimize maternal care during

350

these unprecedented times.
