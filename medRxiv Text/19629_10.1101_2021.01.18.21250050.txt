Abstract: This work addresses the spread of the coronavirus through a non-parametric
approach, with the aim of identifying communities of countries based on how similar their
evolution of the disease is. The analysis focuses on the number of daily new COVID-19
cases per ten thousand people during a period covering at least 250 days after the
confirmation of the tenth case. Dynamic analysis is performed by constructing Minimal
Spanning Trees (MST) and identifying groups of similarity in contagions evolution in 95
time windows of a 150-day amplitude that moves one day at a time. The number of times
countries belonged to a similar performance group in constructed time windows was the
intensity measure considered. Groups’ composition is not stable, indicating that the
COVID-19 evolution needs to be treated as a dynamic problem in the context of complex
systems. Three communities were identified by applying the Louvain algorithm. Identified
communities analysis according to each country’s socioeconomic characteristics and
variables related to the disease sheds light on whether there is any suggested course of
action. Even when strong testing and tracing cases policies may be related with a more
stable dynamic of the disease, results indicate that communities are conformed by countries
with diverse characteristics. The best option to counteract the harmful effects of a pandemic
may be having strong health systems in place,with contingent capacity to deal with
unforeseen events and available resources capable of a rapid expansion of its capacity.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to batter the world, with more than 70 million positive
cases and almost two million deaths by the end of December 2020 (see Santiago et al.,
2020). This study extends Alvarez et al. (2020), in which the authors analyze the evolution
of the COVID-19 in a dataset of 191 countries. The paper utilizes a clustering method
based on the correlation distance and a Minimal Spanning Tree (MST), from which they
obtain a Hierarchical Tree (HT). The algorithm identifies three clusters, each one associated

with a different shape in the infections curve. The authors suggest that the COVID-19
propagation is a complex phenomenon whose dynamics can be better understood within the
framework of the complex systems theory.
Besides the already-mentioned Alvarez et al. (2020), other authors have also employed nonparametric techniques in order to analyze the COVID-19 dynamics. Zarikas et al. (2020)
analyze the set of 30 countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases and identify
four main clusters during the period between the 22nd of January 2020 and the 4th of April
2020. One of the groups is characterized by an abrupt increase in the number of active
cases. A second cluster is associated with both an increase and a flattening in the curve of
infections. A third group clustered the countries with the lowest number of cases and
finally, the fourth group showed an abrupt increase during the last part of the period
analyzed.
A K-means clustering study is presented in Chandu (2020), in which the author analyses
countries with at least 1,000 COVID-19 cases (for a discussion on the clustering algorithm
see Fahim (2020)). The algorithm grouped the set of countries into two clusters. It was
observed that one of the clusters, integrated mainly by European countries, Australia, USA
and Canada was characterized by a high fatality rate.
On the same line, Machado and Lopes (2020) analyze a data set of 79 countries following
two approaches, heuristic models and hierarchical clustering. The authors point out that the
emergence and propagation of COVID-19 is an example of a complex system. A
consequence of this observation is that the analysis of the new Coronavirus disease requires
a methodological framework that assumes the fact that the World is currently facing a rare
and extreme event. As we will explain in the methodological section, in the first stage of
this work we analyze the spread of the coronavirus as a complex network in which each
link represents how similar the coronavirus dynamics is between any pair of countries.
Additionally, network analysis is applied in order to identify the intensity of the similarity
among communities.
The above-mentioned studies were carried out for different time frames and countries
obtaining diverse results. This suggests that findings related to the evolution of the
pandemic are sensitive to these factors. Considering that countries presented a greater
variety of trajectories as the disease progressed, this study is based on analyzing the
evolution of contagions from a dynamic perspective.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces data, Section 3
presents the methodology, whereas section 4 presents the empirical results. Finally, section
5 concludes.
2. Data
This study is based on the COVID-19 data of active cases per population published by "Our
World in Data" (Roser et al., 2020). This source is put together with information from a
variety of sources: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, government

reports, Oxford COVID-19, Government Response Tracker, World Bank - World
Development Indicators, United Nations Statistics Division and Eurostat.
In particular, our main variable of interest is "new cases per million", reported by the
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. We compare the evolution of the
disease in countries that by December 2 had data for more than 250 days after the
confirmation of the tenth case. With the aim of having a balanced panel that allows to
perform distance metrics, all countries' data of new cases per million are considered for the
same time span. This implies that each country's COVID-19 cases are considered in a
different period. For example, for China, the first country that identified the disease, the
period between January 22 and September 27 2020 is considered. The country with the
most recent data is Mali, which by March 27 had more than 10 confirmed cases, being
analyzed until December 1st.
A seven-day moving average smoothing centered on the day of reference was made to the
original data, reducing the time series to the central 244 data. Additionally, some countries
were removed due to having records of negative new cases after the applied smoothing
(Uganda, San Marino, Mauritius, Monaco, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Jordan and Ecuador).
Moreover, Tanzania was removed due to her stopping cases report since May.
Consequently, the analysis is based on 124 series of 244 observations each.
Additional information from "Our World in Data" was considered for groups' analysis. In
particular, socioeconomic indicators -Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Human
Development Index (HDI)-, demographic/population density, median age, life expectancy –
and others related to the pandemic – Government response, testing policy, contact tracing,
etc.- were considered (see Appendix 1).
3. Methodology
Following the methodology developed by Mantegna (1999), in this study the coronavirus
propagation is formulated as a network problem, where each country would be represented
as a node, and the relationship between each pair of countries as a link.
3.1.

Time windows networks

On a first stage, distances between the time series of new cases per million of inhabitants
are calculated to construct complete adjacency matrices. Pearson’s correlation is the select
measure of distance, which summarizes the grade of similarity of new registered cases per
million of inhabitants between countries at each considered time window. Given that
Pearson’s correlation is an invariant to scale measure (Aghabozorgi et al., 2015), countries
that had similar shapes at their trajectories of propagation but differ in the proportion of the
affected population will be considered similar and likely to cluster. Following Mantegna
and Stanley (2000), Pearson’s correlations between the n x n pairs of chosen countries is
computed (see Equation 1) as follows
ρ ij =

( r i r j ) − ( r i )( r j )

where r i is the number of new daily cases in country i and ( r i ) is the average value of r i
during the considered period. Then, the correlation matrix is built with the correlation
coefficients ρij . By definition ρij takes values in the interval( −1,1 ) , where −1 means
completely anti-correlation, 1 complete correlation and 0 that the two variables are
uncorrelated. This matrix is symmetrical, with ρij =1 in this main diagonal. As it is well
known, the Pearson correlation coefficient (1) does not fulfill the three axioms that define a
Euclidean metric. For this reason, the correlation matrix is transformed into the correlation
distance matrix according to the Equation 2

d ij =√ 2 ( 1− ρij )

(2)

which fulfills the three axioms of an Euclidean distance:

id ( i , j )=0 ↔i = j
iid ( i , j )=d ( j, i )
iiid ( i, j ) ≤ d ( i , k ) +d ( k , j )

Subsequently, Prim’s algorithm (Prim, 1957) is applied to adjacency matrix to obtain
Minimal Spanning Trees (MST). Being introduced to graph theory by Kruskal (1956) and
Prim (1957), MST have been a widely used tool (Limas, 2019; Górski et al., 2008;
Kwapień et al., 2009; Rešovský et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013), mainly because it
simplifies network analysis by selecting the most relevant bounds. Indeed, MST are
characterized for representing the core information of a complete network with n nodes by
selecting the n-1 links that minimize the overall distance.
Prim’s algorithm establishes a procedure in successive stages for the selection of MST
links. Taking the information from a complete adjacency matrix, at each step a node is
selected and incorporated to the network. The criteria is to choose, from the not connected
nodes, the one that has the shortest distance to a connected one. At the end of the process
all nodes (n) are connected by n-1 links in a network that has the smallest possible total
length (Prim, 1957).
Subsequently, the single linkage method is applied to obtain a subordinant ultrametric
distance matrix from constructed MST. This graph method is a particular agglomerative
hierarchical clustering algorithm. It starts by considering all the nodes of the network as
subgroups. In successive stages, the less distant subgroups are joined, the distance between
the new subgroup and the rest is determined based on the nearest neighbor criteria.

Additionally, every subordinate ultrametric distance matrix can be represented by a
Hierarchical Tree (HT) or dendrogram (Gan et al., 2007).Finally, the pseudo T 2 and CH
cutting criteria are considered to determine the optimal number of groups, the highest
number of suggested groups with a maximum of 30 is the one chosen. The described
procedure is repeated for each considered time window.
3.2.

Indicators of group dynamics

Four measures are considered to analyze group conformation dynamics; MST total
distance, MST average path and number of identified groups, and the number of times two
countries where in the same group.
Total distance (Equation 3) corresponds to the total sum of the MST links with the lowest
connection cost (taking into account their respective weights). When comparing two MSTs,
the one with the lower sum of links has a lower connection cost, reflecting a major
coincidence in countries disease evolution.
Totaldistance=∑ ( d ij ∈ MST )

(3)

In the case of analysis, average path refers to the average distance in the evolution of the
disease between two countries of the considered MST.
A lower average geodesic indicates that on average, any two countries of the network had
more similar evolution in COVID – 19 contagions. The geodesic between nodes i and j is
the shortest path between them (Jackson, 2010). Equation 4 reflects how to calculate
average distance, for which it is necessary to define geodesics concept. From all possible
paths between i and j in which any node does not figure more than one time, the geodesic is
the shortest. When considering the I geodesics of the MST, the i-th one is represented as
ni ∈ ( 1 , I ) .
I

∑ ni

Averagepat h= i =1

(4)

The number of identified clusters in each time window is determined as the highest number
of suggested groups according to pseudo T2and CH cutting criteria. A smaller number of
groups implies the presence of countries where the disease evolves in a similar way but that
differs from how it evolves in other groups. The increase in the number of groups implies
difficulties in identifying groups of countries that differ from others according to the
evolution of the disease.
Finally, the number of times two countries are in the same group can provide information
on groups’ stability. If the identified groups are constant (two nodes are always – 95 times or never – 0 times – in the same group), the similarity in disease evolution between
countries does not change in time, and otherwise, it is dynamic.

3.3.

Communities identification

Subsection 3.1 procedure is repeated in every time window, obtaining information about
which countries belong to the same group. Intensity in similarity of disease evolution is
estimated by the number of times two countries were in the same group. Given that 95 time
windows of 150 days amplitude that move one day at a time are considered, the lowest
possible intensity between two countries is 0 and the highest 95. With this information, an
adjacency matrix and the corresponding network is constructed.
Community identification is done by Louvain algorithm (Blondel et al., 2008). This method
aims to achieve the maximum modularity (Equation 5), that represents the difference
between observed links and the expected ones by the assumption that communities
structure is independent from links formation over total links. Modularity takes values
between -1 and 1, with 0 meaning that communities are independent of the amount of
internal links, 1 that links are only formed inside the community and -1 that links are
outside the community.

The procedure starts with n communities of one node each, which is moved to neighboring
communities if it implies an increase of modularity. First, community structure is obtained
when these movements do not produce a major modularity. Then the procedure is repeated
considering the formed communities as nodes and the sum of edges as links. Algorithm
ends when the movement of nodes between communities does not increase modularity.

3.4.

Communities characterization

Communities are characterized in several aspects. In particular, socioeconomic,
demographic and geographical indicators are considered. Other information related to the
pandemic, such as number of deaths and taken actions are also incorporated (more specific
information is provided in Appendix 1).

4. Results
This section presents the results in 3 subsections. The dynamics of the groups identified in
each time span is analyzed in the first subsection. The second subsection presents the main
observations of the intensity network in similarity of disease evolution and the identified
communities. Finally, the third section presents the results' robustness.

4.1.

Evolution of groups in time windows

Figure 1 shows the evolution of the number of identified clusters in the 95-time windows
considered (purple) and the evolution of the MST total distance (orange). A wide variation
in the number of groups is observed; note that the time windows move one day at a time,
the maximum number of groups in each time window is 30 and the lowest number of
identified groups is 3. In particular, there seems to be a cyclical behavior around a
decreasing trend, with increases in the number of groups every 20 days approximately
(corresponding to windows 21, 43, 58, 74 and 95). Total network distance increases in the
first 20 time windows and decreases after. This means that seen as a whole, the trajectories
of COVID-19 in the countries considered began to approach from the time window 20.
Additionally, Figure 2 shows the evolution of networks average path (red) in comparison
with the evolution of identified groups (purple). The formation of a smaller number of
groups seems to be related to a major average path. To sum up, the identification of a
smaller number of groups is related to moments in which the evolution of the disease was
more similar between some countries and widened among others. Moreover, this reflects
that evolution of the COVID–19 has been highly dynamic, changes in the interaction were
fast, reflecting a high diversity of interacting trajectories that move closer to and away from
each other and highlighting the importance to analyze it as a complex system.

Likewise, the formation of groups of similarity in the evolution of the disease is also
dynamic, since only in 5.17% of the cases the groups were static (see Figure 3). Note that
most cases corresponds to a situation in which two countries are never in the same group
(389 in 7626, 5,1% of the cases), while it is rare to find countries that belong to the same
group in all considered time windows (5 in 7626, 0,07% of the cases).

Communities of countries by the intensity of similarity in the disease
evolution.

Three communities of countries were identified from the intensity of similarity in the
disease evolution network (see Appendix 2), represented in Figure 4. Community 1 is
conformed by 56 countries, community 2 of 59 and community 3 has only 9 members.

Figure 4. Intensity of similarity in the disease evolution network

Source: own construction based on OWID data. Appendix 2 presents countries corresponding to
each number.

As Figure 5 shows, the evolution of COVID–19 rolling 7-day average of daily new cases
per million people in most of the community 1 was more constant than in the other
communities. Even when individual trajectories were different between members (some
had one wave, others two or more and levels are wide), the disease in these countries seems
to oscillate in a smaller range in comparison to countries from the other communities.
Average group trajectory presents a low positive trend. Initial spread of the disease seems
to have been less abrupt than in other communities, with a more gradual increase in the
number of cases in several countries. Community 2 is composed by countries in which the
new confirmed cases per million had at least one phase of wide variation. Some of these
countries had an important and fast increase in the number of daily cases at the beginning
of infections, in others it happens during the middle of the considered time span. It is also
possible to identify some countries with a slower growth in the number of cases, but with
an important difference between days with small and high number of daily contagions.
Inmost of the community members, at least one pronounced wave can be seen, but for some
the number of daily new cases stabilizes at a high level after surge. On average, the
community presents a first high and short wave of contagions, followed by a positive trend
(higher than in community 1).
Average disease evolution of community 3 is the most unstable, and fluctuates around a
positive trend. The first wave of contagions seems to have been less pronounced and
shorter than in community 2 for most members, additionally, longer phases of increase in
the number of daily cases seems to be presented. Given that average evolution presents a
positive trend in all communities, the number of daily cases has not yet entered a phase of
decline. These results suggest that the number of infections will continue for a while.

Despite having similarities in relation to contagion dynamics, the identified communities
are different in several aspects. Considered in average, each community has very different
characteristics in terms of demographic, socioeconomic and geographical indicators,
actions taken in relation to COVID–19, and in the impact of the disease (measured by the
number of total deaths per million of inhabitants by December 1st).

Table 1 presents communities demographic and socioeconomic information that is
considered as relevant in relation to the disease evolution. In all considered measures,
communities have countries that belong to at least 3 quartiles of the variable distribution
along all considered countries. This indicates that, even when there are characteristics in
which some quartile have more countries, communities are diverse in all considered
aspects.

In particular, community 1 has the highest average population density, with most countries
in the 4th quartile. In terms of median age, average per capita GDP, average life expectancy
and average HDI, community 2 has the highest value. These communities present average
values more similar to each other than to community 3 in most of the variables considered.
Community 3 has the lowest population density and the youngest population (lowest
average median age), but it is by far the most vulnerable in terms of the others variables.

In terms of geographical distribution there is not a clear pattern between communities. Most
African and American countries belong to community 1 and there are more European
countries in community 2. Even so, both communities have members from all continents.
Members of community 3 are African, European and Asian countries, note that 99 of the
124 considered countries belong to this continents. All above considered, continent does
not seem to be a crucial factor in determining communities of intensity in similarity of the
evolution of COVID – 19 (see Table 2).

Communities’ members are also diverse in terms of implemented actions to counteract the
negative effects of the disease in order to control its propagation. Overall government
responses were varied within each community, due to both containment and health
measures as well as economic ones (see table 3).

Testing policy codebook: 0 – No testing policy, 1 - Only those who both (a) have symptoms and
also (b) meet specific criteria (e.g. key workers, admitted to hospital,came into contact with a
known case, returned from overseas), 2 - Testing of anyone showing COVID-19 symptoms, 3 Open public testing (e.g. “drive through” testing available to asymptomatic people).*Any country
of the sample had category 0 as predominant testing policy. Tracing policy codebook: 0 – No
tracing, 1 - Some, but not all, cases are traced, 2 – All cases are traced.

More differences can be identified in terms of predominant testing and contact tracing policies
(see table 3). In communities 1 and 2, the most frequent testing policy between January 22 and
December 1st was to test anyone showing symptoms, while in community 3 people had to also
meet specific criteria. Tracing policy has also been more rigorous in communities 1 and 2; the
most frequent tracing policy between January 22 and December 1 st was to traced almost all cases,
in community 3 it was to trace some cases. Given that in average, communities 1 and 2 had
smoother evolution of the disease than community 3, testing and tracing policies seems to be
important in controlling contagions. Even so, communities are not homogeneous in the
implementation of these policies, indicating that these measures do not guarantee the control the
COVID–19 spread.

Having a similar evolution of the disease did not imply different results in terms of deaths, since
average community registered deaths at December 1st per million are similar between
communities. Moreover, higher averages on healthcare access and quality index were not reflect in
lower deaths averages (see table 4).

Results Robustness

Variations in the maximum number of groups allowed in each time window can have
effects in formed communities. In this study, results were obtained for a maximum of 10,
20 and 30 groups per time window. Identified communities were stable; only 10 out of 124
countries belonged to a different community in at least one of the exercises performed.
Table 5 presents observed countries community changes when varying the maximum of
allowed groups per window. Appendix 3 presents countries’ values and quartiles per
considered variable, confirming that communities are still diverse when these changes in
membership are considered.

5. Conclusions
Measuring the intensity of similarity in the disease evolution, three communities of
countries were found, with distinctive aspects in their average behaviors. Community 1
presents the most controlled path, while in Community 3 average contagions were more
unstable. Community 2 presents an intermediate average evolution, with an initial wave
followed by a more stable path. Even so, communities’ members were diverse in several
aspects, and the three communities present particular cases that do not follow the average
behavior. All communities presented positive trends, which suggests that the number of
infections will continue for a while. Furthermore, the multiplicity of dynamics suggests that
the impact on the national economies will be heterogeneous, with some countries less
affected. This might be observed in the levels of unemployment. In this regard, Milani
(2020) finds that the behavior of unemployment across countries has been very
heterogeneous. In Latin American countries, and even in the US, socially disadvantaged
populations cannot follow the order to stay at home. Thus, the issue of income inequality
turns to be the main obstacle for a complete and effective implementation of social
distancing measures. Even so, each community is integrated by countries from different
GDP per capita levels.
Our results confirm the initial assumption. The spread of COVID-19 is a complex
phenomenon, characterized by both a multiplicity of patterns and non-linear dynamics. This
point suggests, on one hand, the presence of diverse drivers behind the spread of the
COVID-19 and that public policy responses should not be homogeneous, but should rather
be adapted to different contexts. However, it is important to note that communities with a
more stable evolution were composed by a majority of countries implementing stricter
testing and contact tracing policies.
Given the complexity of the phenomenon, we consider relevant to distinguish
between short-term and medium-term interventions. The implementation of lockdowns is
an example of the former. When discussing the effect of lockdowns, the available literature
seems to show contradictory results. However, since COVID propagation is a complex

phenomenon, we consider that there is no such contradiction, but that the results should be
analyzed within their specific contexts. Note that countries from the same community
implemented different levels of maximum containment health policies.
In particular, policy makers should specify in their objective function which
segments of the population are being targeted and which indicators are been used. In this
regard, as Ehlert (2020) points out, policymakers should consider the identification of risk
groups when designing their response strategies. In addition, Huang et al. (2020)
recommend policy makers to guarantee that the impacts of public policy include the
interests of the socially disadvantaged groups. It is also important to consider the existence
of trade-offs within the objective function, since minimizing both COVID-19 propagation
and economic impacts might be two conflicting goals. On this line, Mahasinghe et al.
(2020) suggest that the lockdown strategies are non-linear. For example, in the case of Italy,
Ciminelli and Garcia-Mandio (2020) offer evidence that the shutdown of service activities
is effective in reducing COVID-19 mortality, although shutting down factories is less
effective. Thus, they recommend closing down services, however the government should be
more careful when considering closing down factories, particularly given the social costs
derived from halting production. In the case of Chile, Asahi et al (2020) found out that
localized lockdowns were associated to up to 15% drop in the local economic activity.
Regarding the service sector, it would be important to have a second thought when
considering a complete shut down in the tourism sector, as Ehlert (2020) suggests. In his
study of Germany's 401 counties, he finds no evidence of the tourism sector as a driver of
infection or death rates. At this point, it would be important to consider that tourism
encompasses a wide range of activities and that many tourists travel in order to isolate
themselves during their leisure time. Thus, this activity might be favoring conditions for
social distancing. In the case of Latin American countries, in which the rate of infections
and mortality has been growing, policy makers might stimulate self-isolation through
promoting the use of resorts for risk groups.
The best options to counteract the harmful effects of a pandemic may be having
strong health systems with contingent capacity to deal with unforeseen events or available
resources capable of a rapid expansion of its capacity. Regarding the medium-term
interventions, the expansion of health services should be considered. In Latin American
countries, an important proportion of population has diabetes and hypertension, which
increase fatality rates. The policy recommendation is a robust public-funded health system
with wider accessibility, as Sherpa (2020) and Gandjour (2020) suggest. There should be an
increase in public health funding, as well as in the number of doctors per population and
bed availability. Alternatively, countries could have available resources with the capacity to
rapidly strengthen the health system. Ciminelli and Garcia-Mandio (2020) point out that a
robust health care system is the only way to prevent a huge death toll. Their results for Italy
show that locations at 10 km from the closest intensive care unit had up to 50% higher
mortality.Even when communities are heterogeneous in terms of total deaths and healthcare
access, lack of information on the number of cases that required hospitalization in several
considered countries limits our results in this aspect. Additionally, policy makers should
pay attention to bottlenecks in the access to health services, since it has been observed that
isolating health areas just for COVID-19 patients has complicated the treatment of other
health problems. In order to avoid additional disruptions in health treatments, Degeling et al
(2020) recommend the restoring of health service to normal levels as soon as possible.
Another relevant medium-term intervention would be improving the health of the
population via the intake of more fruits and vegetables. Since it implies a drastic change in

dietary habits, it might require time and an important effort by governments and regulatory
agencies. This intervention might be particularly relevant in Latin American countries, in
which obesity and related co-morbidities are common. In a study of the population in the
Nordic countries, Mol and Karnon (2020) found the that the existence of low obesity rates
facilitates a more liberal social distancing policy and that the impact of consumption of
fruits and vegetable on deaths rates would be comparable or even better than strict
lockdowns. The study shows evidence that as the disease progresses, the pattern diversifies.
As there are no clear general characteristics that allow the different trajectories to be
identified, the best response in the medium term is a well-prepared and strong health
system.
