Summary
Background
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic by the
World Health Organization, while several key epidemiological parameters of the disease
remain to be clarified. This study aimed to obtain robust estimates of the incubation period,
upper limit of latent period (interval between infector’s exposure and infectee’s exposure),
serial interval, time point of exposure (the day of infectee’s exposure to infector relative to the
latter’s symptom onset date) and basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19.

Methods
Between late February and early March of 2020, the individual data of laboratory confirmed
cases of COVID-19 were retrieved from 10728 publicly available reports released by the health
authorities of and outside China and from 1790 publications identified in PubMed and CNKI.
To be eligible, a report had to contain the data that allowed for estimation of at least one
parameter. As relevant data mainly came from clustering cases, the clusters for which no
evidence was available to establish transmission order were all excluded to ensure accuracy of
estimates. Additionally, only the cases with an exposure period spanning 3 days or less were
included in the estimation of parameters involving exposure date, and a simple method for
determining exposure date was adopted to ensure the error of estimates be small (< 0.3 day).
Depending on specific parameters, three or four of normal, lognormal, Weibull, and gamma
distributions were fitted to the datasets and the results from appropriate models were presented.

Findings
In total, 1155 cases from China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Germany and
Malaysia were included for the final analysis. The mean and standard deviation were 7.44 days
and 4.39 days for incubation period, 2.52 days and 3.95 days for the upper limit of latent period,
6.70 days and 5.20 days for serial interval, and -0.19 day (i.e., 0.19 day before infector’s
symptom onset) and 3.32 days for time point of exposure. R0 was estimated to be 1.70 and 1.78
based on two different formulas. For 39 (6.64%) cases, the incubation periods were longer than
14 days. In 102 (43.78%) infector-infectee pairs, transmission occurred before infectors’
symptom onsets. In 27 (3.92%) infector-infectee pairs, infectees’ symptom onsets occurred
before those of infectors. Stratified analysis showed that incubation period and serial interval
were consistently longer for those with less severe disease and for those whose primary cases
had less severe disease. Asymptomatic transmission was also observed.

Interpretation
This study obtained robust estimates of several key epidemiological parameters of COVID-19.
The findings support current practice of 14-day quarantine of persons with potential exposure,
but also suggest that longer monitoring periods might be needed for selected groups. The
estimates of serial interval, time point of exposure and latent period provide consistent evidence
on pre-symptomatic transmission. This together with asymptomatic transmission and the

generally longer incubation and serial interval of less severe cases suggests a high risk of longterm epidemic in the absence of appropriate control measures.

Introduction
In December 2019, a novel enveloped RNA beta-coronavirus, which was later named
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, the
capital city of Hubei province of China.1 The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, i.e., coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), spread across and outside China rapidly, and was declared a
pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020.
Despite the explosive growth of the number of studies on COVID-19, several key
epidemiological parameters of the disease remain to be clarified, among which are incubation
period and serial interval. The two parameters have important implications for the monitoring,
surveillance and control of infectious disease. The mean or median incubation period and serial
interval estimated by previous studies were mostly 4 to 5 days,2-7 and 4 to 4.5 days,8-12
respectively. While some of the studies included only a limited number of cases (around or less
than 100),2,4,6,7,9-12 others might have suffered from inaccuracy of original data. For example, in
some studies, most cases had a long or even unclear interval of exposure, making it difficult to
determine the exact exposure date3,5,13 and giving rise to error. Besides, the order of
transmission (i.e., who is infector and who is infectee) in clustering cases, which is crucial to
estimation of both parameters, is easy to be mistaken given the possibility of pre-symptomatic
and asymptomatic transmission,14-17 but previous studies rarely described how this issue was
handled.
Incubation period and serial interval are also key parameters for epidemiological
modelling in predicting the transmission dynamics, including the basic reproduction number
(R0). R0 is defined as the average number of secondary cases caused by a single infectious
individual in a totally susceptible population.18 Estimation of R0 may require the knowledge of
latent period and infectious period,19,20 which are both difficult to measure directly. For a disease
that is not infectious until onset of symptoms, latent period is equivalent to incubation period,
and infectious period can commonly be approximated by the difference of serial interval minus
incubation period.18 However, for COVID-19, the latent period appears to be shorter than
incubation period as pre-symptomatic transmission might occur,16,17 and this should be
accounted for when estimating R0. To our best knowledge, no published studies estimated the
latent period of COVID-19, or how often and approximately at which time point the disease
could be transmitted prior to the symptomatic onset.
This study made use of the large amount of data reported by the health authorities of and
outside China and those from published studies to address the above issues. Specifically, it was
aimed to obtain robust estimates of the following epidemiological parameters of COVID-19: 1)
incubation period, 2) the upper limit of latent period, as the exact latent period cannot be
observed, 3) serial interval, 4) time point of exposure, referring to the day of infectee’s exposure
to infector relative to the latter’s symptom onset date, and 5) R0.

Methods
Data sources
For China, all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities (including mainland,
Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) that had reported cases of COVID-19 were identified
according to the daily updates by the National Health Commission of China.21 Then, the official
websites and WeChat accounts (if any) of local governments and health authorities (e.g.,
Municipal Health Commission, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of
Health) were checked manually through February 20, 2020 for mainland China and March 3,
2020 for Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan to identify and download the reports on laboratoryconfirmed cases of COVID-19. Google and Baidu were searched to identify public media
reports quoting government departments, which were normally based on official press releases.
Chinese words for the following terms were used to do the search: (‘family’ OR ‘household’)
AND (‘cluster’ OR ‘dinner’ OR ‘party’) AND ‘infection’.
Other countries reporting COVID-19 cases were identified according to the ‘coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) situation reports’ by World Health Organization.22 For Japan and
Singapore, the information of confirmed cases was retrieved from their respective Ministry of
Health. For Malaysia and Vietnam, public media reports quoting government sources were
adopted. The dates of search for the four countries varied from February 29 to March 2, 2020.
We also searched for individual cases from relevant departments and public media of the United
States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, but failed to find any with details allowing
for parameters estimation in this study. Typically, the dates of exposure and symptom onset
were lacking, e.g., see reference.23 Owing to language barrier, we did not do a comprehensive
search for other countries. A full list of the abovementioned data sources, including their URLs,
can be found in Appendix 1.
PubMed was searched to identify relevant publications by using the following terms:
‘coronavirus’, ‘2019-nCov’, ‘SARS-CoV-2’, and ‘COVID-19’. The search was restricted to
December 1 and February 27, 2020. After February 27, we did not update the search but still
kept an eye on the newly published studies on COVID-19, which were frequently disseminated
by public media and the official WeChat accounts of various academic entities in China, or
recommended by experts in this field to the authors of the present study. The China National
Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) was searched through March 11, 2020 to identify
publications in Chinese journals using ‘novel coronavirus’ (‘Xin Xing Guan Zhuang Bing Du’
in Chinese pinyin), which was the official Chinese name for SARS-CoV-2. The reference lists
of eligible publications were also checked to see if there were other eligible studies not found
by previous searches. A supplementary list of included studies can be found in Appendix 2.
Definitions and inclusion criteria
To be eligible, a report had to contain individual data that allowed for estimation of at least
one of the following parameters of laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19: incubation period,

serial interval, time point of exposure, and the upper limit of latent period.
Incubation period was defined as the time interval between exposure and onset of disease
symptoms. To obtain an accurate estimate, only the cases with an exposure period spanning 3
days or less were included in the analysis. For those exposed for three continuous days and
those exposed on two dates with one day apart (i.e., exposed on the first and third days), the
second day was uniformly used as the exposure date in estimation. For those exposed for two
continuous days, the first day was uniformly used as the exposure date in estimation. This
approach ensured the upper limit of error in the estimated incubation period be smaller than 1
day for the cases with a 2-day or 3-day exposure, regardless of when exactly (i.e., first, second,
or third day) the transmission actually occurred. In reality, the overall error was bound to be
much smaller than 1 day, as most included cases were exposed for only 1 day which would
dilute the overall error.
Serial interval was defined as the duration between symptom onset of an infector (e.g., a
primary case) and that of an infectee (e.g., a secondary case) in a transmission chain, which was
typically seen in cluster infections. A negative value meant that the infectee’s symptoms
occurred before the infector’s symptoms. For two cases to qualify as an infector-infectee pair
and be included in this study, the following two criteria must both be fulfilled. First, there was
evidence that the presumed infector had been exposed outside the cluster (e.g., close contact
with a confirmed case, travel history to Hubei, exposure to a person who returned from Hubei)
before he/she joined the group activities such as family gathering and business conference that
gave rise to cluster infections. Second, the presumed infectee was exposed to the presumed
infector only in the 14 days prior to symptom onset, without other exposure histories.
Time point of exposure in this study referred to the day of infectee’s exposure to infector
relative to the latter’s symptom onset date, and was estimated by the infectee’s exposure date
minus the infector’s symptom onset date, where a negative value meant that the exposure
occurred before the infector developed symptoms. The upper limit of latent period was defined
as the interval between the exposure of infector and that of infectee in a transmission chain,
which was used to estimate the longest possible latent period of an individual infector (the exact
latent period cannot be observed in reality). If there were more than one infectee caused by an
infector, only the one with the earliest exposure date was used in estimating this parameter.
Estimation of the time point of exposure and upper limit of latent period also involved
determination of exposure date and judgement about transmission chain, hence the related
principles applied in estimating incubation period and serial interval were also followed here.
Screening, data extraction, and quality control
Six researchers were involved in data collection. The reports retrieved through the above
searches were scrutinized one by one according to the inclusion criteria specified above. The
following data were extracted from eligible reports by using a standard extraction form which
was pilot-tested with the reports from Liaoning province of China: the geographical location

concerned, age, sex, type of exposure, first date and period (if applicable) of exposure, date of
symptom onset, initial symptoms, severity, whether the case was from a cluster. For a clustering
case, the generation he/she belonged to and the exposure date, symptom onset date and severity
of the infector were also recorded. The retrieved reports were split into six parts, with each
researcher responsible for one part. For each part, the eligibility of and data extracted from
reports were firstly determined by one researcher and then cross-checked by another three
researchers. All uncertainty and disagreements were discussed among the researchers. If no
consensus could be reached after discussion, the concerned cases would be excluded to ensure
the correctness and accuracy of data. For example, if it could not be determined who was
infected through attending a group activity (i.e., infectee) and who had been infected before
he/she attended the activity (i.e., infector), then all clustering cases related to the activity had
to be excluded.
Data analysis
The basic characteristics of included cases were summarized descriptively. The lognormal,
Weibull, and gamma distributions were fitted to the datasets of incubation period and upper
limit of latent period, and the key parameters were estimated by using the maximum likelihood
approach. For serial interval and time point of exposure, we assumed that they followed a
normal distribution.8 This was to address the negative values in the serial interval reported by
previous studies, in which case the lognormal, Weibull, and gamma distributions may be
limited.24,25 For each parameter, the range, median, selected percentiles, mean and standard
deviation were estimated. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) of mean and standard deviation
were estimated by using the bootstrap technique. R0 was estimated by using two widely
accepted formula:8,9,19,20

R0  e

r  1/2 r 2 2

(1)

R0  1  r / a 1  r / b 

(2)

where r is exponential growth rate, μ is mean serial interval, σ is standard deviation of serial
interval, 1/a is latent period, and 1/b is infectious period. The exponential growth rate was
obtained directly from a previous study reporting incidence data of the early stage of epidemic,1
while the other parameters came from the present study. The latent period was approximated
by the upper limit of latent period, and the infectious period was approximated as serial interval
minus the upper limit of latent period. Although the true value of latent period was bound to be
smaller than the upper limit, we argued that this would not exert a significant impact on the
estimation of R0 according to the above formula (2), because when the latent period became
shorter the infectious period would become longer accordingly, given a fixed serial interval.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the robustness of the three parameters
involving exposure date. Specifically, the third day for those whose exposure period spanned

three days and the second day for those exposed for two continuous days were used as their
exposure dates in sensitivity analyses. The difference between the estimates from sensitivity
analysis and those from primary analysis represents the largest possible error in the latter. For
serial interval and time point of exposure, which had negative values, the datasets were also
fitted with shifted lognormal, Weibull and gamma distributions to see if the mean and standard
deviation would change much. Based on the new estimates from sensitivity analyses, R0 was
also re-estimated. All statistical analyses were conducted with SAS software, version 9.4.
Results
Process and output of data collection
The process of data collection is summarized in Figure 1. In total, 1155 cases were
included for the final analysis, including 1054 (91.3%) from China, 39 from Japan, 37 from
Singapore, 11 from South Korea, 7 from Vietnam, 4 from Germany, and 3 from Malaysia. The
cases from China covered 151 cities of 30 provinces out of 34 in total. No case from Chongqing,
Xinjiang, Tibet and Macau was included in this study.
Characteristics of included cases
The age of included cases ranged from 5 days to 90 years (Table 1). There were 122 cases
(12.92%) with a travel history to Hubei province where Wuhan is the capital city. The source
of exposure of 887 cases was known confirmed cases. The exposure period was exactly 1 day
in 426 (50.3%) cases, spanned 2-3 days in 196 (23.1%) cases, and spanned more than 3 days in
the other cases (who were not included in estimation of parameters involving exposure date).
Among the cases with relevant information (n=329, 28.48%), 49 (14.89%) were asymptomatic,
256 (77.81%) mild to moderate, and 24 (7.29%) severe. The top five initial symptoms were
fever (73.92%), cough (24.06%), fatigue (7.49%), malaise (7.20%), and chills (4.03%).
Clustering cases accounted for 81.4% of all, and most of them were the second generation. It
should be noted that for each generation there were some cases excluded from this study,
because no information was available for estimating the parameters of interest.
Epidemiological parameters
Incubation period were estimated from 587 cases, of whom 408 were exposed for 1 day
and the others for two or three days. The incubation period of individual cases ranged from 0
to 23 days (Table 2), with a median of 7 days and 6.64% (n=39) of them longer than 14 days.
The estimates from lognormal, Weibull and gamma models were almost the same. Thus,
lognormal model was used uniformly for this parameter (Figure 2(A)). The mean incubation
period was estimated at 7.44 days (95% CI: 7.10, 7.78) and the standard deviation 4.39 days
(95% CI: 3.97, 4.49).
Only 11 pairs of infector-infectee was eligible for estimation of the upper limit of latent
period, which ranged from 0 to 5 days (Table 2) with a median of 1 day. The mean and standard
deviation derived from lognormal model, which fitted the dataset best (Figure 2(B)), were 2.52

days and 3.95 days, respectively. The small sample size precluded further analysis.
The serial interval was estimated for 689 pairs of infector-infectee and ranged from −5 to
24 days (Table 2), with a median of 6 days. It was smaller than 0 (mean: −2.63 days) for 27
(3.92%) pairs, meaning that the infectee showed symptoms earlier than the infector. Assuming
a normal distribution (Figure 2(C)), the mean was 6.70 days (95% CI: 6.31, 7.10) and standard
deviation 5.20 days (95% CI: 4.91, 5.46).
The time point of exposure was estimated from 233 pairs of infector-infectee and ranged
from −9 to 13 days (Table 2), with a median of 0 day. It was smaller than 0 (mean: −3.11 days)
for 102 (43.78%) pairs, meaning that the transmission occurred before the infectors showed
symptoms. Assuming a normal distribution (Figure 2(D)), the mean was −0.19 days (95% CI:
−0.62, 0.25) and standard deviation 3.32 days (95% CI: 2.97, 3.68).
Based on an exponential growth rate of 0.10 per day1 and the mean (6.7 days) and standard
deviation (5.2 days) of the serial interval, R0 was estimated at 1.71 (95% CI: 1.67, 1.75)
according to formula (1). Based on the same exponential growth rate, serial interval and mean
of upper limit of latent period (2.52 days), R0 was estimated at 1.78 according to formula (2).
Please note that the 95% CI was not available here as the 95% CI of latent period was not
estimated due to limited sample size, i.e., 11 pairs of samples.
Sensitivity and stratified and analyses
In sensitivity analysis, the estimates of incubation period, latent period and time point of
exposure remained stable, with a difference of 0.14-0.3 day from those in primary analysis
(Table 2), which represents the largest possible error caused by inclusion of cases with an
exposure period spanning 2 or 3 days. For serial interval and time point of exposure, the results
from shifted lognormal, Weibull and gamma distributions are almost the same and all of them
are similar to those from normal distribution, hence only the lognormal distribution is presented
(Figure 2(C)-(D) and Table 2). R0 remained almost the same in sensitivity analysis (data not
shown).
The results of stratified analysis, where asymptomatic cases were also included, are
summarized in Table 3. The three parameters were consistently associated with disease severity
and generation in clusters. Specifically, for those with less severe disease or at lower
generations in clusters, the incubation period, interval between their exposure and primary cases’
symptom onset, and interval between their symptom onset and primary cases’ symptom onset
all tend to be longer. For those whose primary cases had less severe disease, the incubation
period tends to be longer, while the interval between their symptom onset and primary cases’
symptom onset tends to be shorter. No such trend was observed for other factors.
Discussion
By pooling individual data from seven countries, we estimated the mean incubation period
of COVID-19 to be 7.44 days, latent period 2.52 days, serial interval 6.70 days, time point of

exposure −0.19 day and R0 1.70 to 1.78. The time point of exposure can also be inferred by
mean serial interval minus mean incubation time (−0.74 day), which is consistent with the direct
estimate (−0.19 day) as both suggest the mean time point of exposure to be around the day
before primary cases’ symptom onset. Based on the above estimates, the timeline of infection
for an ‘average’ pair of infector-infectee in a transmission chain is demonstrated in Figure 3.
Our estimates of incubation period and serial interval are longer than most of the previous
estimates.2-7 There are several possible reasons for the difference. First, the sample size is
generally small in previous studies,2,4,6,7,9-12 but much larger in the present one. Second, most
cases in previous studies had a long or even unclear interval of exposure, making it difficult to
determine the exact exposure date3,5,13 and giving rise to error. By contrast, this study followed
strict inclusion criteria regarding exposure period and method to determine exposure date to
ensure the potential error in the estimates be small (< 0.3 day, according to the sensitivity
analysis). Third, the approaches to determination of transmission order within clusters are
different. For the cases involving cluster infection, which represent the majority of all cases, a
common practice of previous studies was to take the case with earliest date of symptom onset
as infector and others as infectee.9 However, we deemed it inappropriate in view of the varying
incubation periods of individuals and potential pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic transmission.
In this study, more rigorous criteria were applied to the inclusion of clusters, and the clusters in
which transmission order was uncertain were excluded from relevant analyses. Fourth, different
studies used data from different stages of the epidemic. The data of this study was retrieved
through late February of 2020, which may reflect more of the situation after strong measures
were taken to battle the epidemic in China.
Our finding that the incubation period was within 14 days for 93% of the cases lends
support to current practice of 14-day quarantine of persons with potential exposure to SARSCoV-2. In line with other studies,13 we also found some cases who developed symptoms 14
days after exposure, indicating that longer quarantine periods might be justified for some people.
However, as it is hard to know beforehand who will develop symptoms beyond 14 days of
exposure, the cost of extending quarantine of many people and the potential consequence of
failure to identify a few symptomatic cases must be weighed carefully.
The negative values of serial interval and time point of exposure provide evidence of presymptomatic transmission, which are consistent with the much shorter latent period than
incubation period. The percentages of negative serial interval (3.92%) and negative time point
of exposure (43.78%) can be viewed as the lower and upper limits of probability of presymptomatic transmission, respectively. Asymptomatic transmission was also observed in this
study (Table 3). These findings are in line with those of previous studies.8,9,14-17 Stratified
analysis in this study found a trend towards longer incubation period of less severe cases as
compared with that of more severe cases. This implies that severe cases could be detected and
‘removed’ from the pool of transmission sources more quickly, while less severe cases would

stay in the pool for a longer time and constitute a big challenge to the control of epidemic given
the possibility of pre-symptomatic transmission.
The R0 we estimated is smaller than those from previous estimates which were mostly
between 2 and 4.7,20,26-28 As discussed above, the difference may either be due to methodological
issues in obtaining parameters or reflect different stages of epidemic. In any case, a smaller R0
should not be interpreted as low risk of transmission. Slow response of government, presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission and insufficient protection measures taken by the
public together could lead to an out-of-control epidemic, as with the current situation in many
countries.
This study has limitations. First, the cases were retrieved from publicly available reports,
and many cases were excluded because there were no details available for estimating the
parameters. Thus, the representativeness of cases could be a concern. A comparison of the age
and sex of included cases with those of 72314 cases in China showed that they are generally
similar.29 Previous studies suggested that publicly reported cases may overrepresent the severe
ones. However, based on 329 cases (28.48%) with relevant information available, non-severe
cases appeared to account for a higher proportion in the present study than in the previous one
on 72314 cases in China. The second limitation of this study is that the upper limit of latent
period was based on only 11 pairs of infector-infectee. Larger studies are needed to obtain a
more robust estimate. The third limitation is that by using the upper limit of latent period instead
of the real latent period in formula (2), in our case, could lead to a slightly smaller value of R0.
If we use a naively small value of the latent period at 0 days (i.e., no latency), the formula (2)
would lead to a R0 at 1.67, which can be treated as the lower bound. Hence, under the formula
(2), R0 may range from 1.67 to 1.78, which was consistent with those from formula (1), i.e.,
1.71 (95% CI: 1.67, 1.75).
In conclusion, this study obtained robust estimates of several key epidemiological
parameters of COVID-19. It provides additional evidence on the mean incubation period of
COVID-19, which supports current practice of 14-day quarantine of persons with
potential exposure but also suggests that longer monitoring periods might be needed for
selected groups. The estimates of serial interval, time point of exposure and latent period
provide consistent evidence on pre-symptomatic transmission. Asymptomatic transmission was
also observed. This together with asymptomatic transmission and the generally longer
incubation and serial interval of less severe cases suggest a high risk of long-term epidemic in
the absence of appropriate control measures.

*Results of sensitivity analyses. For incubation period, the third day for those whose exposure period spanned three
days and the second day for those exposed for two continuous days were used as their exposure dates in sensitivity
analyses. For upper limit of latent period which involved two exposure dates, sensitivity analysis estimated the
possible longest (S1) and shortest (S2) periods. For serial interval, sensitivity analysis fitted the dataset with shifted
lognormal distribution. For time point of exposure, S1 presents the results with adjustment for exposure dates
(similar to those of incubation period), while S2 presents the results based on shifted lognormal distribution.
