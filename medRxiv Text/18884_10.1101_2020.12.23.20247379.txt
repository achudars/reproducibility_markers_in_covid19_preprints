RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
Evidence before this study
The efficacy and safety of the anti–interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab in the treatment
of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia was investigated in COVACTA, a doubleblind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. The primary endpoint of improved clinical status on
a seven-category ordinal scale (1, discharged/ready for discharge; 7, death) at day 28 was not
met in this trial. Among the secondary endpoints, no difference in mortality at day 28 was
observed, but time to hospital discharge was shorter in the tocilizumab group. Subgroup analysis
suggested there might be a treatment benefit in patients grouped according to their ordinal scale
category at baseline.
We searched PubMed on September 14, 2020, using the terms “tocilizumab AND (COVID-19
OR coronavirus) AND biomarker” with no language or date restrictions. The search retrieved 18
articles, four of which identified laboratory measures as potential biomarkers in patients who
received tocilizumab for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. The biomarkers reported in
these studies include interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, liver transaminases,
lymphocytes, platelets, and D-dimer. However, these previous studies were single-centre,
retrospective, observational studies. Larger, prospective, controlled trials are needed to
investigate potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers to assess the outcomes and response to
treatments for COVID-19.
Added value of this study
This exploratory analysis of data from COVACTA demonstrated interleukin-6, C-reactive
protein, ferritin, neutrophils (percentage and absolute count), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio,

lymphocytes (percentage and absolute count), monocytes (percentage), and platelets as strong
prognostic biomarkers in patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. More
important, ferritin showed predictive value for tocilizumab treatment effects on day 28 clinical
outcomes of mortality, mechanical ventilation (among the subgroup of patients not receiving
mechanical ventilation at randomisation), and clinical status compared with placebo.
Implications of all the available evidence
In patients with elevated levels of ferritin at baseline, tocilizumab decreased the probability of
death, mechanical ventilation, and worsening clinical status at day 28 compared with placebo,
suggesting that ferritin might be useful as a predictive biomarker of efficacy outcomes for
tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Summary <<250 of maximum 250 words>>
Background Retrospective observational studies suggest that interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive
protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, Ddimer, and platelets are associated with disease progression, treatment outcomes, or both, in
patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. We explored these candidate prognostic and predictive
biomarkers with efficacy outcomes after treatment with tocilizumab, an anti–IL-6 receptor
antibody using data from the COVACTA trial for patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19
pneumonia.
Methods Candidate biomarkers were measured in 295 patients in the tocilizumab arm and 142
patients in the placebo arm. Efficacy outcomes assessed were clinical status on a seven-category
ordinal scale (1, discharge; 7, death), mortality, time to hospital discharge, and mechanical
ventilation (if not receiving it at randomisation) through day 28. Prognostic and predictive
biomarkers were evaluated continuously with proportional odds, binomial or Fine-Gray models,
and additional sensitivity analyses.
Findings Modelling in the placebo arm showed all candidate biomarkers except LDH and Ddimer were strongly prognostic for day 28 clinical outcomes of mortality, mechanical ventilation,
clinical status, and time to hospital discharge. Modelling in the tocilizumab arm showed a
predictive value of ferritin for day 28 clinical outcomes of mortality (predictive interaction
p=0.03), mechanical ventilation (predictive interaction p=0.01), and clinical status (predictive
interaction p=0.02) compared with placebo.
Interpretation Multiple biomarkers prognostic for clinical outcomes were confirmed in
COVACTA. Ferritin was identified as a predictive biomarker for the effects of tocilizumab in the

Introduction
Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) elicits an initial innate antiviral pro-inflammatory immune
response and a second phase that reflects an adaptive immune response.1 Pro-inflammatory
cytokines, particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-α, may be involved in the
immune dysregulation reported in some patients with COVID-19, possibly resulting in more
severe clinical manifestations.2,3 Elevated levels of IL-6 are associated with severe COVID-19,4
and preliminary findings from case-control and retrospective cohort studies5,6 support
investigation of tocilizumab, an anti–IL-6 receptor alpha antibody, to treat severe COVID-19
pneumonia.
COVACTA was a global, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of
tocilizumab in patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The primary endpoint of
improved clinical status on a seven-category ordinal scale at day 28 was not met. Among
secondary endpoints, no difference was observed in mortality at day 28; however, time to
hospital discharge was shorter in the tocilizumab group. Subgroup analysis suggested there might
be a reduced risk for intensive care unit (ICU) transfer among patients not in the ICU at
randomisation and a potential reduction in clinical failure (death, mechanical ventilation, ICU
transfer, or study withdrawal) among patients not receiving mechanical ventilation at
randomisation. Because the primary endpoint of the study was not met, additional studies are
ongoing to investigate these findings further.7
Patients with COVID-19 have diverse symptoms and complications, from pneumonia to acute
respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure, and death despite receiving current standard
care.8 The heterogeneity in clinical presentation and the pathological manifestations of COVID7

19 present major challenges in investigating effective treatments and identifying optimal
biomarkers that might help prognosticate or predict response to treatments. Laboratory measures
of hyperinflammation (IL-6, C-reactive protein [CRP]), macrophage activation (ferritin),
dysregulated immune cells (lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils), tissue damage (lactate
dehydrogenase [LDH]), and coagulopathy (D-dimer, platelets) have been reported as risk factors
for poor prognosis in COVID-19,4,9-13 and most of them are mechanistically linked to IL-6
activity.14-16 This suggests they might be useful not only as prognostic but also as predictive
biomarkers of the effects of IL-6 pathway blockade. To date, these biomarkers have been
investigated only in retrospective observational studies of COVID-19.
We aimed to determine the prognostic and predictive value of previously identified candidate
biomarkers regarding clinical outcomes in a pre-specified exploratory analysis of the
COVACTA trial.

Methods
Patients and study design
COVACTA (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04320615) was a randomised, placebo-controlled, doubleblind, global, multicentre, phase 3 trial investigating the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab
versus placebo in patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia receiving standard
care according to local practice.7 Eligible adult patients—stratified by geographic region (North
America, Europe) and mechanical ventilation (yes, no)—were to receive intravenous tocilizumab
or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Key inclusion criteria were hospitalisation with SARS-CoV-2 infection
confirmed by polymerase chain reaction of any specimen and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2)

≤93% or partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) <300 mm/Hg
despite receiving local standard care (which could include antivirals or low-dose steroids). Key
exclusion criteria were active or suspected infection (other than SARS-CoV-2); alanine
aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase >10× the upper limit of normal; absolute
neutrophil count <1000/mL; and platelet count <50,000/mL. The primary endpoint of the trial
was clinical status assessed using a seven-category ordinal scale. Secondary endpoints included
mortality at day 28, incidence of mechanical ventilation (in patients not receiving mechanical
ventilation at randomisation), and time to hospital discharge. Informed consent was obtained for
all enrolled patients. The study was conducted in accordance with the International Council for
Harmonization E6 guideline for good clinical practice and the Declaration of Helsinki or local
regulations, whichever afforded greater patient protection. The protocol was reviewed and
approved by all appropriate institutional review boards and ethics committees (see Appendix 1
for the complete list).
Biomarker analysis
Biomarkers in peripheral blood were assessed at baseline to examine their potential prognostic
value and potential predictive value for tocilizumab efficacy. Efficacy was determined in relation
to the clinical status assessed on the seven-category ordinal scale at day 28 (primary), mortality
at day 28, time to hospital discharge, and requirement for mechanical ventilation by day 28 (in
patients not receiving it at randomisation). These four endpoints were selected to ensure the
signal was robust and consistent across endpoints. Imputation rules for efficacy endpoints were
assigned as published.7 Pre-specified candidate biomarkers included IL-6 and CRP as markers of
hyperinflammation, ferritin as an acute-phase protein and as a marker of macrophage activation,
LDH as a marker of tissue damage, lymphocytes as a marker of dysregulated immune response,

and D-dimer as a marker of coagulopathy. The potential for neutrophil, monocyte, and platelet
counts as biomarkers was also explored. IL-6 levels were measured using an immunoassay
method validated at QPS (Quantikine ELISA; R&D Systems Minneapolis, MN). CRP levels
were measured using an in vitro diagnostic method validated at PPD (Roche Cobas; Roche
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). All other biomarkers were assessed using standard clinical
chemistry and haematology methods available at the local clinical laboratories.
Statistical analysis
Biomarkers were assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population (any randomly assigned
patients who received study medication). Subgroup analysis was conducted in patients in ordinal
scale categories 4 (ICU or non-ICU hospital ward, requiring non-invasive ventilation or highflow oxygen) and 5 (ICU, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation) at baseline (i.e.
patients who might benefit from tocilizumab).7 Histograms, scatterplots, and tables were
generated to assess the completeness of data by treatment arm at baseline, determine the balance
of biomarker levels at baseline, and identify outliers. Biomarkers not normally distributed were
log transformed before analysis, among them D-dimer, ferritin, IL-6, lymphocytes (absolute),
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and white blood cells. Pearson correlation coefficient was
calculated between outcomes and biomarkers, between the baseline covariates and biomarkers,
and between individual biomarkers. Six candidate biomarkers assessed (IL-6, CRP, ferritin,
LDH, lymphocytes, D-dimer) were pre-specified in a biomarker analysis plan. No adjustments
were made for multiple comparisons.
Prognostic modelling was assessed in the placebo arm only, controlling for the following
covariates: mechanical ventilation status at randomisation (yes/no), antiviral use (yes/no), steroid

use (yes/no), age, sex, and region (Europe/North America). None of the endpoints were
considered primary because the motivation was to identify a robust, consistent signal across
endpoints. For each endpoint, sensitivity analyses were performed on the placebo arm only using
unadjusted analysis, on the tocilizumab and placebo arms adjusting for the same covariates plus
treatment arm, and on the tocilizumab and placebo arms controlling only for treatment arm.
Candidate prognostic biomarkers were assessed using a proportional odds model with the ordinal
scale score at day 28 as a dependent variable and biomarker and covariates (depending on the
model) as independent variables. Odds ratios, confidence intervals, and p-values were reported,
and proportional odds assumptions were assessed graphically. A Fine-Gray model was fit for
time to discharge, with death as a competing risk. A Cox proportional hazards model was fit as a
sensitivity analysis. A binomial model with the outcome as a dependent variable, biomarkers as
independent variables, and covariates (depending on the model) was used for binary outcomes
(death, discharge, mechanical ventilation).
Candidate predictive biomarkers were modelled in the same way as the candidate prognostic
biomarkers, with the addition of an interaction term between continuous biomarker value and
treatment. All reported predictive p-values rely on the interaction p-value term except for those
generated in the multivariate model assessing multiple biomarkers. Additionally, tertile analysis
of predictive biomarkers was performed by creating vectors for each tertile (low, medium, high)
and fitting a single model with interaction terms for medium and high tertiles with treatment.
Treatment effects within each tertile were then calculated from the estimates. No cut-point
optimisation was performed, but analysis and visualisation were performed using tertiles and
quartiles. Combined predictive biomarkers were assessed by dichotomising the biomarkers using
median values as cut-offs.

To support the predictive findings, an additional analysis was conducted using data from the
placebo arm of COVACTA and data from a phase 2 trial of tocilizumab in moderate to severe
COVID-19 pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04363736; MARIPOSA) (Appendix Table S1).
Data from the tocilizumab 8-mg/kg arm of MARIPOSA were analysed and compared with data
from the placebo arm of COVACTA, followed by sensitivity analysis including pooled data from
the tocilizumab 8-mg/kg and 4-mg/kg arms of MARIPOSA. Inclusion criteria were matched, and
the subset of patients with severe disease in MARIPOSA (similar to the COVACTA population)
was included but patients with moderate disease were excluded. Propensity scores were
calculated based on the following covariates, which could impact treatment assignment or
outcome: ordinal baseline score (captures mechanical ventilation status), age, sex, antiviral use
(yes/no), and corticosteroid use (yes/no). Overlapping support was checked for the propensity
score distributions. Matching was performed using the MatchIt (version 3.0.2) algorithm, which
matched the treatment groups from MARIPOSA and the control group from COVACTA using
propensity scores with the nearest neighbour algorithm. Weighting was performed using inverse
probability weighting according to the ATT estimand.17 Success of weighting and matching was
assessed using Love plots, which chart the standardised differences of variables (standardised
mean difference [SMD] = x_treatment – x_control)/(pooled standard deviation), where SMD
<0.1 or SMD <0.25 was considered acceptable,18,19 and histograms (for categorical variables) or
density plots (for continuous variables) before and after weighting were used for visual
comparison. Several methods were used to estimate the treatment difference for subgroup
analysis and the interaction term between the continuous predictive biomarker and treatment:
ATT estimand via propensity score weighting (primary analysis method); propensity score
regression; naive; propensity score matching.

Results
Biomarker levels at baseline
Baseline biomarker levels (Appendix Figure 1A), except IL-6 and CRP, were generally balanced
between the treatment arms in COVACTA (Table 1; Appendix Figure 1B). Median levels were
higher in the tocilizumab than the placebo arm for IL-6 (88.1 vs 70.3 ng/L) and CRP (169.3 vs
151.9). Median baseline levels of IL-6, CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, LDH, and neutrophils (absolute
value and percentage) were above normal ranges, and lymphocytes (absolute value and
percentage) were below normal ranges (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was elevated).
Monocytes (percentages), platelet counts, and total leukocyte counts were within normal ranges.
Limited correlation was observed between the pre-specified biomarkers (Appendix Figure 1C).
Evaluation of prognostic biomarkers
All biomarkers examined, with the exception of LDH, D-dimer, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte
ratio, showed a correlation with clinical outcomes, including mortality, mechanical ventilation,
ordinal scale score, and time to hospital discharge, at day 28 (Figure 1A). Some biomarkers

showed correlation with baseline covariates; for example, IL-6, CRP, neutrophils (absolute value
and percentage), and total leukocyte count were positively correlated with higher baseline
ordinal scale category and mechanical ventilation at randomisation (yes, no) (Figure 1B).
Adjusting for covariates, all biomarkers except LDH and D-dimer showed robust evidence
across different sensitivity analyses, supporting their prognostic value for clinical outcomes
(Appendix Figure S2). Prognostic modelling showed a consistent direction of effect across all
clinical outcomes at day 28 for mortality, mechanical ventilation, ordinal scale score, and time to
hospital discharge (Figure 2A; Appendix Figure S2). Analysis of the ordinal scale at day 28
according to baseline continuous ferritin revealed a potential prognostic effect of ferritin in the
placebo arm (p=0.01; n=124).
Evaluation of predictive biomarkers
Predictive modelling for all assessed biomarkers except IL-6, lymphocytes (percentage),
neutrophils (absolute), and leucocytes showed a consistent direction of effect across all clinical
outcomes (Figure 2B). Ferritin was identified as a predictive biomarker for the effects of
tocilizumab in COVACTA (Appendix Figure S3). No other biomarkers had predictive value for
the effects of tocilizumab except monocytes (percentage), with low values predictive for time to
hospital discharge (Appendix Figure S3). Analysis of the ordinal scale at day 28 according to
continuous baseline ferritin values showed that placebo patients with higher baseline levels had
worse clinical status, whereas clinical outcomes at day 28 were similar across baseline ferritin
tertiles in tocilizumab patients (n=364; predictive effect interaction, p=0.02; visualised using
tertiles in Figure 3A). Modelled data showed a predictive effect for ferritin as a biomarker for
tocilizumab effects on mortality by day 28 (predictive interaction, p=0.03) (Figure 3B) and
mechanical ventilation by day 28 (predictive interaction, p=0.01) (Figure 3C). Tocilizumab

treatment decreased the probability of mechanical ventilation and mortality by day 28 compared
with placebo in patients with elevated levels of ferritin based on continuous assessment across a
range of ferritin levels. Although time to hospital discharge was nominally significantly shorter
with tocilizumab than placebo in COVACTA,7 ferritin was not a significant predictive biomarker
for the effect of tocilizumab on time to hospital discharge (p=0.09) (Figure 3D); however, the
direction of effect was consistent with that observed for the ordinal scale category and mortality
outcomes.
Additional evidence of the value of ferritin as a predictive biomarker of the effects of
tocilizumab was generated using unpublished data from the phase 2 MARIPOSA trial of
tocilizumab in COVID-19. The binary outcomes of mortality and mechanical ventilation were
assessed. Analysis comparing data from patients with severe disease in the tocilizumab 8-mg/kg
arm from MARIPOSA with data from the placebo arm of COVACTA supported the finding that
ferritin has predictive value as a biomarker for mortality (ATT estimand based, p=0.044); a
similar pattern was observed for mechanical ventilation (Appendix Figure S4).
Analysis of the ordinal scale at day 28 and mortality at day 28 suggested that baseline IL-6 is not
a predictive marker of tocilizumab efficacy (Appendix Figure S5). Analysis of combinations of
the biomarkers ferritin, IL-6, and CRP (n=257) as well as ferritin, LDH, and D-dimer (n=165)
did not show any synergistic effect between biomarkers (Appendix Table S2), further suggesting
that ferritin alone was the strongest predictive biomarker for the effects of tocilizumab in
COVACTA.

The subgroup of patients who required high-flow oxygen or non-invasive or invasive mechanical
ventilation without other advanced life support (ordinal scale categories 4 and 5) at baseline had
higher baseline ferritin levels than patients in all other ordinal scale categories (Appendix Figure
S6, Table S3), and those in the tocilizumab arm had better clinical outcomes than those in the
placebo arm. Analysis of this subgroup using a continuous scale for baseline ferritin levels also
demonstrated a predictive association of baseline ferritin levels and the effects of tocilizumab for
mortality (interaction p=0.02). For clinical utility, tertile analysis was also performed (Figure 4,
Appendix Figure S7). The predictive signal of ferritin, treated as a continuous biomarker, was
also significant for clinical status by ordinal scale at day 28 (interaction p=0.01), as was
incidence of mechanical ventilation by day 28 in patients who did not receive mechanical
ventilation at randomisation (interaction p=0.01).
Baseline IL-6 levels were predictive of the effect of tocilizumab in this subgroup for time to
hospital discharge only (Figure 5, Appendix Figure S8) (adjusted Fine-Gray p=0.03), but this
was not statistically significant in the sensitivity analysis (Cox proportional hazards adjusted
p=0.09). Furthermore, baseline IL-6 levels were not predictive for tocilizumab effects on hospital
discharge (yes vs no; p=0.13) or any other outcome in this subgroup.

Discussion
Our exploratory analysis of the COVACTA trial is the first, to our knowledge, to report on
prognostic and predictive biomarkers from a global, multicentre, randomised controlled trial in
patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia. IL-6, CRP, ferritin, LDH, lymphocytes,
neutrophils, monocytes, D-dimer, and platelets are among the biomarkers identified in case

hyperinflammation, macrophage activation, tissue damage, dysregulated immune cells, and
coagulopathy commonly observed in patients with severe COVID-19.4,9-13 Only a modest
correlation was observed between the biomarkers representing different manifestations,
potentially reflecting the overlapping yet differentiated pathogenic pathways in COVID-19.
Elevated levels of IL-6, CRP, ferritin, and neutrophils and decreased levels of lymphocytes
demonstrated robust and consistent prognostic value as biomarkers of poor disease outcomes
across all clinical outcomes assessed. Monocytes (percentage) and platelet counts also
demonstrated strong prognostic value, though at baseline they were within normal ranges.
Elevated LDH levels appeared to have prognostic value, but this finding was not robust across
different sensitivity analyses. Our findings agree with the hypothesis that systemic
hyperinflammation, tissue damage, and dysregulated immune responses are associated with poor
disease outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19.4,9,10 Elevated D-dimer levels as a marker of
coagulopathy showed weak and inconsistent prognostic signals in COVACTA. However, there
were potential confounding factors for D-dimer assessment in our study, including higher levels
among survivors in COVACTA compared with those reported in other studies10 (Appendix
Table S4), a disproportionate balance of missing data by region (59.2% for Europe, 40.8% for
North America), an association with the stratification factor of region that was not evident for
any other biomarkers tested, and an unadjusted p=0.023 for mortality in prognostic modelling

compared with an adjusted p=0.54 for region. Thus, the prognostic value of D-dimer levels in
COVID-19 remains controversial.12,21,22
Ferritin was the only biomarker in this exploratory analysis that predicted the effect of
tocilizumab treatment in COVACTA across multiple clinical outcomes. During infection and
inflammation, ferritin is released from macrophages and hepatocytes to protect cells from
oxidative damage and sequester iron from pathogens.23,24 Although IL-6 stimulates hepatocytes
to release acute-phase proteins, including ferritin, as a systemic response, ferritin is also a marker
of myeloid cell activation in the blood and inflamed tissue. Once released, it can further activate
macrophages to produce cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1β, driving a positive feedback loop of
ferritin-inducing proinflammatory cytokine release.23,24 Altered myeloid cell activation and
elevated ferritin levels correlate with increased severity of COVID-19 disease.1,25 Furthermore,
elevated ferritin levels decreased significantly after tocilizumab administration in patients with
severe COVID-19,12 suggesting a possible mechanism underlying the predictive value of ferritin
for tocilizumab treatment effects. High ferritin levels are thought to be a biomarker and a driver
of disease severity in other clinical disorders characterised by abnormal macrophage activation
and elevated IL-6 activity, such as cytokine release syndrome26 and systemic juvenile idiopathic
arthritis (sJIA).27 In both conditions, patients benefit from tocilizumab treatment, and ferritin
levels decrease after treatment in those with sJIA.27 Although results are hypothesis-generating
in this respect, the relationship between hyper-ferritinemia and elevated IL-6 levels in COVID19 and other diseases provides a potential rationale for why ferritin was predictive for the effects
of IL-6 pathway inhibition with tocilizumab in our study. Additional investigation of biomarkers
downstream of IL-6 and ferritin signalling, together with single-cell analysis of pulmonary cells,

might further elucidate how high ferritin levels predict benefit from the inhibition of IL-6 activity
in patients with severe COVID-19.
IL-6 and CRP are inflammatory markers that respond to tocilizumab treatment.28 Although they
demonstrated strong prognostic value as disease biomarkers in COVID-19, elevated levels of IL6 or CRP at baseline were not predictive of the tocilizumab treatment effect in the overall
COVACTA population. IL-6 only demonstrated a trend for predictive value among the subgroup
of patients who required high-flow oxygen and non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation
(ordinal scale categories 4 and 5) at baseline. This result might be counterintuitive given that
tocilizumab inhibits the IL-6 receptor to block the IL-6 pathway; however, it is not entirely
unexpected. Since approval of tocilizumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in 2009, no
predictive biomarker—neither IL-6 nor CRP—has been validated for tocilizumab treatment
effects in rheumatoid diseases.28,29 Similarly, despite the positive benefit/risk of tocilizumab
treatment in other autoimmune indications, such as giant cell arteritis, the predictive value of
baseline IL-6 or CRP has not been established.29 It remains unclear how IL-6 activity measured
in blood is associated with tocilizumab efficacy endpoints in complex diseases; further
investigation in clinical studies is warranted.
Because the COVACTA trial did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status in
patients with COVID-19–associated pneumonia or the key secondary endpoint of reduced patient
mortality, identifying a subgroup of patients who might have derived clinical benefit in our study
(patients with elevated ferritin levels at baseline) also reveals a subgroup potentially harmed
(patients without highly elevated ferritin levels at baseline). This, combined with the preliminary
nature of our results, means that extreme caution must be exercised and that additional study is
required before a clinically useful numerical cut-off for ferritin levels can be defined. Another

limitation of this study is that laboratory values were measured locally, which, notably, entails
more variability than uniform test runs in a central laboratory. Local laboratory results for
ferritin, however, were confirmed by retesting all samples at a central laboratory using an in vitro
diagnostic method (Roche Cobas).
In conclusion, markers of hyperinflammation, macrophage activation, and dysregulated immune
cells appear to be important prognostic biomarkers in COVID-19. Ferritin, as an acute-phase
protein and a macrophage activation marker, might have potential as a predictive biomarker to
help identify patients with severe COVID-19 who respond to tocilizumab. Results from ongoing
studies of tocilizumab in COVID-19 are needed to validate these findings.

Model adjusted for the stratification factors of region (Europe, North America) and mechanical
ventilation (yes, no) as well as age, sex, baseline antiviral use (yes, no), and baseline steroid use (yes, no).
Vertical dashed lines indicate p=0·05.
Outcomes are at day 28 and have been aligned so that bars pointing in the same direction have the same
direction of effect.
Last observation carried forward was used for ordinal scale score at day 28.
CRP=C-reactive protein; LDH=lactate dehydrogenase; PBO=placebo; WBC=white blood cell.

Seven-category ordinal scale: 1, discharged or ready for discharge; 2, non–ICU hospital ward, not
requiring supplemental oxygen; 3, non–ICU hospital ward, requiring supplemental oxygen; 4, ICU or
non–ICU hospital ward, requiring non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen; 5, ICU, requiring
intubation and mechanical ventilation; 6, ICU, requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or
mechanical ventilation and additional organ support; 7, death.
Ferritin values were log transformed (sample size, n=364).
Ferritin tertile cut-off values were 3·63 pmol/L (minimum), 1480·77 pmol/L, 3150·29 pmol/L, and
75299·67 pmol/L (maximum) in an unadjusted model showing predicted probability and 95% CI (B, C).
Cumulative incidence was determined by Aalen-Johansen estimator, with an arbitrary median cut-point of
7·7 on logarithmic scale (D).
ICU=intensive care unit.

Figure 4: Predictive biomarker assessment for death by day 28 according to baseline
ferritin levels
Subset of patients in ordinal scale categories 4 and 5 at baseline in COVACTA; n=157.

Ferritin values were log transformed. Shown are predicted probabilities for death within each tertile of
ferritin (tertile cut-off values were 3·63 pmol/L [minimum], 1480·77 pmol/L, 3150·29 pmol/L, and
75299·67 pmol/L [maximum]) showing predicted probability and 95% CI based on an unadjusted model
(calculated based on all-comers) fit using samples restricted to those for patients in ordinal scale
categories 4 and 5 at baseline.

Figure 5: Time to hospital discharge by baseline IL-6 levels
(subset of patients in ordinal scale categories 4 and 5 at baseline in COVACTA; n=157).

Ferritin values were log transformed. Figure shows the cumulative incidence function for time to hospital
discharge based on the median IL-6 cut-off value.
IL-6=interleukin-6.
