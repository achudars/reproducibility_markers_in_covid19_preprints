Abstract

64
65

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in excess

66

morbidity and mortality as well as economic decline. To characterise the systemic host immune

67

response to SARS-CoV-2, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing coupled with analysis of

68

cell surface proteins, providing molecular profiling of over 800,000 peripheral blood mononuclear

69

cells from a cohort of 130 patients with COVID-19. Our cohort, from three UK centres, spans the

70

spectrum of clinical presentations and disease severities ranging from asymptomatic to critical.

71

Three control groups were included: healthy volunteers, patients suffering from a non-COVID-19

72

severe

73

lipopolysaccharide to model an acute inflammatory response. Full single cell transcriptomes

74

coupled with quantification of 188 cell surface proteins, and T and B lymphocyte antigen receptor

75

repertoires have provided several insights into COVID-19: 1. a new non-classical monocyte state

76

that sequesters platelets and replenishes the alveolar macrophage pool; 2. platelet activation

77

accompanied by early priming towards megakaryopoiesis in immature haematopoietic

78

stem/progenitor cells and expansion of megakaryocyte-primed progenitors; 3. increased clonally

79

expanded CD8+ effector:effector memory T cells, and proliferating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in

80

patients with more severe disease; and 4. relative increase of IgA plasmablasts in asymptomatic

81

stages that switches to expansion of IgG plasmablasts and plasma cells, accompanied with higher

82

incidence of BCR sharing, as disease severity increases. All data and analysis results are available

83

for interrogation and data mining through an intuitive web portal. Together, these data detail the

84

cellular processes present in peripheral blood during an acute immune response to COVID-19, and

85

serve as a template for multi-omic single cell data integration across multiple centers to rapidly

86

build powerful resources to help combat diseases such as COVID-19.

Introduction

89
90

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic on 11

91

March 20201, and as of 12 January 2021 has led to over 91 million infections and 1.9 million

92

deaths worldwide2. Common symptoms, which are often mild and transient, include cough, fever

93

and loss of taste and/or smell3. In a small proportion of those infected, symptoms can worsen and

94

lead to hospitalisation, with the elderly and those with comorbidities being most at risk4. In critical

95

cases, patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) necessitating intensive

96

care therapy, including endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation5. Clinical trials of

97

vaccines and therapeutics have been performed at an unprecedented pace6, leading to the

98

emergency authorisation of several vaccine candidates for susceptible populations in December

99

20207. Treatment strategies under investigation include medication with anti-viral, anti-

100

inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties8.

101
102

The aetiologic agent of COVID-19 is a novel highly-infectious pathogenic coronavirus, severe

103

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This enveloped, positive-sense single-

104

stranded RNA betacoronavirus utilises the cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2

105

(ACE2) to enter host cells9. ACE2 is expressed in various barrier tissues, including nasal

106

epithelium, conjunctival epithelium and intestines, as well as internal organs, including alveoli of

107

the lung, heart, brain, kidney and the uterine-placental interface10. Neuropilin (NRP1), a cell

108

surface receptor expressed in respiratory and olfactory epithelium, can also facilitate SARS-CoV-

109

2 cellular entry11. Patients with COVID-19 infection often have lymphopenia in association with

110

high neutrophil and platelet counts, parameters which may give prognostic indication12.

111
112

Several studies have highlighted a complex network of peripheral blood immune responses in

113

COVID-19 infection, with the role of T cells during infection being an area of particular focus13,14.

114

A reduction of absolute numbers of T cells linked with disease severity has been reported, as well

115

as a decrease in IFN-γ production by lymphocytes15. However, a significant expansion of highly

116

cytotoxic effector T cell subsets has also been found in patients with moderate disease 16.

117

Additionally, higher expression of exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 on CD8+ T cells have been

118

described in patients receiving Intensive Care Unit (ICU) therapy17.

119
120

The response of myeloid cells and B cells have been less well explored in COVID-19. Emergency

121

myelopoiesis, driven by inflammation, is thought to arise as a way to prevent tissue damage 18,19.

122

In severe cases, dysregulation of myelopoiesis coupled with abnormal monocyte activation can

123

occur18, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be explored. Extrafollicular B cell activation is

124

present in critically ill patients but despite the high levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and

125

antibody secreting cells, many of these patients do not recover from the disease 14. Neutralising

126

antibodies are protective against infection and potentially confer immunity to reinfection, as

127

adoptive transfer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies into naive animals were shown to

128

reduce virus replication and disease development20. Vaccine-induced neutralising antibody titers

129

have been correlated with protection in nonhuman primates 21, and recovered patients display

130

robust antibody responses correlated with neutralisation of authentic virus for at least several

131

months22.

132
133

In this study we combined single cell resolution analysis of transcriptomes, cell surface proteins

134

and lymphocyte antigen receptor repertoires to characterise the cellular immune response in

135

peripheral blood to COVID-19 across a range of disease severities, integrating results across three

136

UK medical centres.

Results

139
140

Altered transcriptomic and surface protein profiles related to severity of COVID-19 infection

141

To delineate the immune response to COVID-19 infection, we collected venous blood samples

142

from patients with asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe and critical23 COVID-19 infection across

143

three UK centres in Newcastle, Cambridge and London. Controls included healthy volunteers,

144

patients with a non-COVID-19 severe respiratory illness, and healthy volunteers administered with

145

intravenous lipopolysaccharide (IV-LPS) as a surrogate for an acute systemic bacterial

146

inflammatory response (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Table 1). We generated single cell

147

transcriptome data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of all individuals as well as

148

a census of cell surface proteins using a panel of 192 antibody derived tags (ADT) (Fig. 1A,

149

Supplementary Table 2). In total, following demultiplexing and doublet removal, we sequenced

150

1,141,860 cells from 143 samples with 850,100 cells passing quality control (min of 200 genes

151

and <10% mitochondrial reads/cell) (Extended Data 1A). The full scRNA-seq dataset was

152

integrated using Harmony24 (Fig. 1B). There was good mixing of cells by the kBET statistic

153

calculated for each cluster across sample IDs (rejection rate improved from 0.62 to 0.36 following

154

integration, p<2.1x10-8 by Wilcoxon paired signed rank test (Extended Data 1B-C)).

156

Following Leiden clustering, cells were manually annotated based on the RNA expression of

157

known marker genes. RNA-based annotation was supported by surface protein expression of

158

markers commonly employed in flow cytometry to discriminate PBMC subpopulations (Extended

159

Data 1D). We defined 18 cell subsets across the datasets (Fig. 1B), with an additional 27 cell states

160

identified following sub-clustering (Fig. 1B, 2A, 3A-B, 4A-B). Our annotation was further

161

validated using the Azimuth annotation tool for PBMC where more than 50% of the cells were

162

mapped and matched to a unique cluster in 32/33 of the clusters defined in the Azimuth PBMC

163

dataset (proliferating CD8 T cells mapped across two clusters). Clusters unique to our data include

164

proliferating monocytes, ILC subpopulations and isotype-specific plasma cells. (Extended Data

165

1E). Our complete COVID-19 peripheral blood multi-omic data is available through the web-

166

portal at https://covid19cellatlas.org.

167
168

We assessed how cell populations varied with severity of COVID-19 and observed a relative

169

expansion of proliferating lymphocytes, proliferating monocytes, platelets, and mobilized

170

haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) with worsening disease. In the B cell compartment,

171

there was an expansion of plasmablasts in COVID-19 and an increase in B cells in severe and

172

critical disease. In contrast to these expansions, there were reductions in MAIT cells with disease

173

severity (Fig. 1C, Extended Data 2A). These changes were in keeping with the trends observed

174

in clinical blood lymphocyte, monocyte and platelet counts of COVID-19 patients (Extended

175

Data 2B, Supplementary Table 3). To assess the broader impacts of patient characteristics and

176

clinical metadata on the altered proportion of cell type/states, we used a Poisson linear mixed

177

model (see Methods and Supplementary Note 1) which predicted the COVID-19 swab result (BF

178

corrected LR P=2.3x10-4; see Methods), disease severity at blood sampling (BF corrected LR

179

P=3.5x10-7), and centre (contributed by increased RBC and reduced monocytes in the Cambridge

180

patient cohort; BF corrected LR P=3.5x10-142) as the main contributing factors to cell population

181

frequency among 7 different clinical/technical factors (Extended Data 2C). Further, we found

182

that PBMC composition varied depending on symptom duration, with increased relative frequency

183

of pDCs, NK cells, CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes (FDR 10%) and decreased relative frequency

184

of B cells, Tregs, RBCs, platelets and CD4 T cells with a longer symptomatic interval before

185

sampling (Extended Data 2E). Critically ill patients were sampled at later time points from onset

186

of symptoms than mild-moderate-severe patients, consistent with the protracted course of infection

187

in critical disease (Extended Data 2D). However, concordant changes according to symptom

188

duration were still found when excluding critical patients, indicating the additional influence of

189

symptom duration on peripheral immune cell changes in SARS-CoV-2 infection (Extended Data

190

2F).

191
192

We observed expression of Type I/III interferon response genes in monocytes, DCs and HSPCs

193

across the spectrum of COVID-19 severity, but not in patients challenged with IV-LPS, in keeping

194

with the importance of type I and III interferons in the innate immune response to viral infection

195

(Fig. 1D). Type I/III interferon response-related genes were recently identified as harbouring

196

association signals in a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) for COVID-19

197

susceptibility25,26. Of the genes identified in this study, we found IFNAR2 was both upregulated in

198

COVID-19 compared to healthy in most circulating cell types and highly expressed by

199

plasmablasts, monocytes and DCs (Extended Data 2G).

200
201

To provide information on the cytokine and chemokine context influencing peripheral immune

202

cells, we performed multiplexed analysis of 45 proteins in serum. Two contrasting cytokine

203

profiles were evident when comparing mild/moderate to severe/critical patients. CCL4, CXCL10,

204

IL7 and IL1A were associated with severe and critical disease, suggesting an augmented drive for

205

monocyte and NK lymphocyte recruitment as well as support for T cell activity/pathology

206

(Extended Data 2H, Supplementary Table 4).

207
208

To take advantage of the comprehensive protein expression data, we used Cydar27 to characterise

209

how the immune landscape changes with disease severity based on surface protein expression. We

210

divided cells into phenotypic hyperspheres based on the expression of 188 proteins. We then

211

quantified the number of cells from each severity group within the hyperspheres, which allowed

212

us to identify 430 hyperspheres that differed significantly in abundance with increasing severity

213

(spatial FDR < 0.05, Fig. 1E). Examining the surface protein expression profiles post-hoc showed

214

that differentially abundant hyperspheres were present in all major immune compartments. In

215

particular, we found an increase in populations of B cells (CD19 +/CD20+), plasma cells (CD38+)

216

and HSPCs (CD34+) as well as a previously reported remodelling of the myeloid compartment18

217

(Fig. 1E).

Mononuclear phagocytes and haematopoietic stem progenitors

219

Transcriptome and surface proteome analysis of blood mononuclear phagocytes identified known

220

DC subsets (pDC, ASDC, DC1, DC2, DC3) and several monocyte states (Figs. 2A-B). Three cell

221

states of CD14+ monocytes are present (proliferating, classical CD14+ and activated CD83+) in

222

addition to two CD14+CD16+ monocyte cell states (non-classical CD16+ and C1QA/B/C+) (Figs.

223

2A-B). Proliferating monocytes and DCs expressing MKI67 and TOP2A are present in increasing

224

frequency with worsening severity of COVID-19 (Figs. 2A-B). In contrast, circulating numbers

225

of DC2 and DC3 are reduced. Proliferating monocytes have previously been identified by flow

226

cytometry of COVID-19 patients’ blood19. Here, we add that they share an extended protein and

227

RNA expression profile with CD14+ monocytes (Figs. 2A-B). Proliferating DCs most closely

228

resemble DC2. C1QA/B/C-expressing CD16+ monocytes are present at a low frequency relative to

229

whole PBMC in healthy blood, but are expanded in COVID-19 and are the only source of C1

230

complement components in PBMCs (Fig. 2B, Extended Data 3A).

231
232

We previously demonstrated the egress of blood DCs and monocytes from blood to alveolar space

233

with rapid acquisition of a lung molecular profile following human inhalational LPS challenge 28.

234

To better understand the relationship between circulating and lung alveolar mononuclear

235

phagocytes in COVID-19, we compared the transcriptome profile of blood DCs and monocytes

236

with their bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) counterparts during COVID-19 using recently published

237

data (GSE145926)29 (Extended Data 3B). As expected, partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA)

238

suggests transcriptional similarity between healthy circulating CD14 + monocytes and healthy BAL

239

macrophages, in agreement with recent data demonstrating that BAL macrophages can arise from

240

circulating CD14+ monocytes (Fig. 2C)30. However, there is a surprisingly greater transcriptional

241

similarity between BAL macrophages and the expanded population of circulating

242

C1QA/B/C+CD16+ monocytes in COVID-19 (Fig. 2C). These observations raise the possibility of

243

a differential origin of alveolar macrophages during health and COVID-19.

244

macrophages and C1QA/B/C+CD16+ monocytes express FCGR3A and C1QA/B/C and are

245

enriched for expression of type I interferon response genes (Fig. 2A). Myeloid hyperinflammatory

246

response has been reported to mediate lung and peripheral tissue damage via secretion of

247

inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNFa in COVID-19. We evaluated the expression of

248

these cytokines and found that they are primarily expressed by tissue rather than blood

249

mononuclear phagocytes (Fig. 2C). Genes differentially expressed in CD83+ CD14+ monocytes

250

and BAL macrophages across pseudotime identified expression of IL15, which is produced in

251

response to viral infections to promote NK proliferation, and leukocyte recruiting chemokines

252

including CCL2, CCL4, CCL7, and CCL8 upregulated by BAL macrophages (Fig. 2D).

253
254

Tissue DCs respond to local inflammation and pathogen challenge by migrating to the draining

255

lymph node to activate naïve T cells. BAL contains a population of mature, migratory DCs that

256

express CCR7 and LAMP3 but downregulate DC-specific markers such as CD1C and CLEC9A

257

(Extended Data 3B). These migratory DCs express IL10 in healthy BAL but express TNF and the

258

common IL-12 and IL-23 subunit IL12B in COVID-19, suggesting altered capacity for T cell

259

polarisation (Fig. 2E). In peripheral blood, C1QA/B/C+CD16+ monocytes expressed the highest

260

amount of Type 1 IFN response genes compared to all peripheral blood myeloid cells (Fig. 2F).

261

We detected minimal TNF- or IL6-mediated JAK-STAT signaling pathway activation in

262

circulating monocytes and DCs but this was upregulated by COVID-19 BAL mononuclear

263

phagocytes (Fig. 2F).

264
265

Coagulation abnormalities and monocyte-platelet aggregates have been previously reported in

266

COVID-19 patients31,32 and we observe an expansion of platelets associated with disease severity

267

(Fig. 1C). This led us to investigate the receptor-ligand interactions predicted to mediate

268

monocyte-platelet interactions using CellPhoneDB, which identified ICAM1 interactions on

269

platelets with CD11a-c/CD18 primarily on C1QA/B/C+CD16+ monocytes and CD16+ monocytes

270

(Fig. 2G). This is accompanied by increased expression of surface proteins indicative of platelet

271

activation (Fig. 2H).

272
273

Our large dataset (850,100 PBMCs) allowed us to interrogate rare populations, including the HSPC

274

compartment. To this end, we selected all cells in clusters with significant expression of the HSPC

275

marker CD34, which resulted in a total of 3,085 HSPCs, following removal of minor clusters co-

276

expressing mature lineage markers. Leiden clustering and UMAP visualisation resulted in a cloud-

277

like representation with closely attached clusters, consistent with a stem/progenitor landscape

278

previously described for bone marrow HSPCs33 (Fig. 2I, Extended Data 3C). Absence of CD38

279

mRNA and protein expression marks the most immature cells within the CD34 compartment,

while expression of markers such as GATA1, MPO and PF4 characterises distinct erythroid,

282

annotate six transcriptional clusters as CD34+CD38- HSPCs, CD34+CD38+ early progenitor

283

HSPCs, and CD34+ CD38+ erythroid, megakaryocytic and myeloid progenitors as well as a small

284

population distinguished by the expression of genes associated with cell cycle (S-phase) (Fig. 2I).

285
286

Following stratification by disease severity, the most noteworthy observation was that the

287

megakaryocyte progenitors were essentially absent in healthy and asymptomatic individuals, but

288

comprised approximately 5% of CD34+ cells in mild, moderate, severe and critical patients (Fig.

289

2J). Unlike the bone marrow, which contains rapidly cycling progenitors, the peripheral blood is

290

not thought to constitute a site for haematopoiesis 34, consistent with the low number of CD34+

291

cells expressing a cell cycle signature, which was furthermore restricted to genes associated with

292

S-phase (Fig. 2I). Disease-associated alterations of the circulating CD34+ progenitor cells are

293

therefore a likely reflection of COVID-19 mediated perturbation of the normal homeostatic

294

functioning of the bone marrow haematopoietic stem/progenitor compartment.

295
296

In light of our earlier observations of platelet activation and enhanced C1QA/B/C+CD16+

297

monocyte-platelet interactions (Figs. 2G-H), the appearance of CD34+ megakaryocyte progenitors

298

was of particular interest, as it suggested a rebalancing of the stem/progenitor compartment. The

299

overall number of these megakaryocyte progenitors however was low, prompting us to seek

300

additional evidence for reprogramming of immature haematopoiesis. To this end, we carried out

301

differential gene expression analysis between the megakaryocyte, myeloid and erythroid

302

progenitor clusters, and used the resulting gene lists to build gene signatures in order to interrogate

303

early activation or priming of lineage-specific transcriptional programs in the most immature

304

haematopoietic progenitor cell clusters (Extended Data 3D). This analysis showed activation of

305

the megakaryocyte progenitor signature in both the CD38- and CD38+ HSPC populations (Fig.

306

2K), with less pronounced effects seen with the erythroid and myeloid signatures (Extended Data

307

3E). Of note, the megakaryocyte signature was also strongly induced in the asymptomatic patients,

308

which do not contain substantial numbers of CD34+ megakaryocyte progenitors in their peripheral

309

blood. Our earlier observation of increased platelet activation within the context of normal platelet

310

counts (Fig. 2H, Extended Data 2B) is therefore consistent with a model whereby exaggerated

311

megakaryopoiesis may be compensating for peripheral platelet consumption in COVID-19

312

patients. Of note, our HSPC compartment analysis suggests that immature haematopoiesis is also

313

affected in asymptomatic patients, but possibly through distinct differentiation and/or cell

314

mobilisation processes. Taken together, our data suggest that alterations in the cellular composition

315

and transcription programs of the stem/progenitor compartment contribute to the patho-

316

physiological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

317
318

T-lymphocytes and TCR changes

319

To further characterise T-lymphocytes during the infection, we re-clustered the T cell compartment

320

and identified 15 clusters of CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and innate-like T cells including γδ T cells,

321

NKT cells, and MAIT cells across sample collection sites, donors and disease severity groups (Fig.

322

3A, Extended Data 4). Our cell annotation is based on both RNA and protein expression of marker

323

genes, as well as effector cytokines (Figs. 3B-C). In the CD4 T cell compartment, we identified

324

naïve CD4 T cells, central memory T cells (CD4 CM), effector memory T cells (CD4 EM),

325

activated CD4 T cells expressing IL-22 (CD4 IL22), Th1 cells, Th2 cells, Th17 cells, Treg cells,

326

and circulating T follicular helper cells (cTfh). In the CD8 compartment, we found naïve CD8 T

327

cells, effector/cytotoxic T cells (CD8 TE), and effector memory T cells (CD8 EM) (Fig. 3A).

328
329

Cellular composition of the T cell compartment varied between the healthy and infected groups

330

(Fig. 3D). Notably, based on their relative proportions and differential abundance testing (FDR

331

10%), we found activated CD4 expressing IL-22, circulating Tfh cells, Th1 cells, Treg cells, CD8

332

EM cells, and MAIT cells relatively enriched in patients with asymptomatic and mild infection

333

phenotype, with NKT, proliferating CD8 and CD4, and CD8 TE cells enriched in patients with

334

more severe phenotypes (Fig. 3E, Extended Data 5A-B). Moreover, we observed multiple cell

335

populations that displayed non-linear differences across severity phenotypes (proliferating CD4 &

336

CD8, CD8 TE, CD4 Th1, CD4 Th17, CD4 CM, IL-22+ CD4, Treg), illustrating the complex

337

compositional changes to peripheral T cells that occur with COVID-19 severity (Fig. 3E,

338

Extended Data 5B). Interestingly, the enrichment of Treg cells and IL-22 expressing CD4 T cells

339

in the patients with less severe disease (asymptomatic & mild) could be associated with immuno-

340

regulatory and tissue-protective responses that may restrict immunopathology (Fig. 3E) as IL-22

341

was previously shown to be involved in tissue protection in influenza A virus infection 35, and

342

associated with low viral load in the lung parenchyma of COVID-19 patients36. The enrichment of

343

proliferating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which also express some exhaustion marker genes (LAG3,

344

TOX), could account for the previous observation of increased expression of exhaustion markers

345

on CD8+ T cells in patients with severe disease17.

346
347

To investigate T cell phenotype beyond differential abundance of T cell subsets, we performed

348

differential gene expression analysis across disease severity (FDR 1%) followed by gene set

349

enrichment analysis (GSEA) in each cell type and found enrichment of pathways associated with

350

inflammation and T cell activation across multiple T cell subsets, including IL-2/STAT5 signaling,

351

mTORC1 signaling, inflammatory response, interferon gamma response, and IL-6/JAK/STAT3

352

signaling (Extended Data 5C). Increases in activation and cytotoxic phenotype in the T cells from

353

COVID-19 patients stimulated ex vivo with SARS-CoV-2 peptide was confirmed independently

354

by protein expression of CD137 and CD107α using flow cytometry (Extended Data 5D).

355
356

Next, we interrogated TCR clonality and the relative proportions of specific T cell subsets within

357

clonally expanded T cells in different disease groups (Fig. 3F). As expected, among the COVID-

358

19 patients, effector CD8 T cells were the most clonally expanded, with enriched large clone sizes,

359

across different disease groups, and their relative proportion increased with disease severity (Figs.

360

3F-G, Extended Data 5E-F). Conversely, the relative proportion of clonally expanded effector

361

memory CD8 T cells decreased in patients with more severe disease (Figs. 3F-G). The ratio of

362

effector CD8 T cells to effector memory CD8 T cells correlated with disease severity (Fig. 3G),

363

suggesting that CD8 T cell differentiation outcome may contribute to both anti-viral protection

364

and immunopathology. This could be a result of the degree of inflammation set by innate immunity

365

in the first instance, resulting in biased CD8 differentiation into antigen-specific short-lived

366

effector CD8 T cells (equivalent to CD8 effector T cells in this study) versus memory precursor

367

effector CD8 T cells (equivalent to CD8 effector memory T cells in this study), as previously

368

reported in animal models37.

373

B-lymphocytes and BCR changes

374

Re-clustering of B and plasma cells in isolation identified 9 clusters that were annotated according

375

to canonical marker expression (Figs. 4A-B), and appropriate enrichment of previously published

376

transcriptional signatures (Extended Data 6A). This included immature, naïve, switched and non-

377

switched memory B cells, and a cluster of cells that enriched for markers previously described in

378

exhausted memory B cells38,39 (Figs. 4A-B, Extended Data 6A). We also found a large population

379

of CD19/CD20-negative plasmablasts, with high expression of the proliferation marker MKI67, as

380

well as IgM+, IgG+, and IgA+ plasma cells (Figs. 4A-B). In patients with symptomatic COVID-

381

19, there was a significant expansion of plasmablasts and plasma cells compared with healthy

382

controls and LPS-treated subjects (Fig. 4C, Extended Data 6B). Notably, this phenomenon was

383

less evident in COVID-19 patients with asymptomatic disease. IgG plasma cells, in particular,

384

were expanded in symptomatic COVID-19 compared with other groups, and the magnitude of this

385

expansion increased with worsening disease severity from mild to severe disease but surprisingly,

386

was less evident in patients with critical disease (Fig. 4C, Extended Data 6B). When considering

387

plasmablasts and plasma cells using the V(D)J data, IgA + cells were expanded in patients with

388

asymptomatic COVID-19 (Fig. 4D), suggestive of an effective mucosal humoral response in this

389

patient group. This is paralleled by the greatest expansion of circulating Tfh cells in asymptomatic

390

patients and underlined by the strong correlation between cTfh cells with plasma cells in

391

asymptomatic/mild patients (Fig. 3E, 4E, Extended Data 5A-B), suggesting a potential

392

contribution of coordinated T cells/B cells response to effective humoral anti-viral protection in

393

these patients that is lost in severe and critical disease. This is consistent with previous findings

394

relating to the requirement of Tfh cells for optimal antibody responses and high-quality

395

neutralising antibodies in viral infection40.

396
397

To interrogate the effect of COVID-19 infection on humoral immune cells beyond differential

398

expansion of subsets, we performed GSEA in each cell type. Interferon alpha response and

399

interferon gamma response pathway genes were enriched in all B cell subsets in COVID-19

400

patients, but this response was generally more marked in patients with asymptomatic or mild

401

disease, and attenuated in severe and critical disease (Fig. 4F, Extended Data 6C). The magnitude

402

of type 1 interferon transcriptional response in B cells mirrored serum IFN-ɑ levels, which were

403

highest in patients with mild disease (Extended Data 2H), suggesting that the low expression of

13

404

IFN response genes in B cells in severe or critical disease does not reflect an inability of B cells to

405

respond to IFN-ɑ, but rather attenuation of IFN-ɑ. This may be because the initial anti-viral

406

response has waned in patients with severe or critical disease or because these patients fail to

407

sustain adequate IFN-ɑ production by myeloid cells and pDCs following symptom onset as

408

previously reported13. Longitudinal sampling would be required to distinguish these two

409

possibilities.

410
411

In asymptomatic patients, TNFA signalling via NF-kB pathway genes were also enriched in

412

immature, naïve and switched memory B cells, but decreased in immature B cells and plasma cells

413

in critical and severe disease (Fig. 4F, Extended Data 6C). Assessment of the leading-edge genes

414

in this pathway demonstrated their markedly higher expression in all B cell and plasmablast/cell

415

subsets in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients compared with those with symptomatic disease (Fig.

416

4G, Extended Data 6D). TNFɑ was barely detectable in COVID-19 serum samples and highest

417

in patients with moderate disease (Extended Data 1E), suggesting that another cytokine e.g. IL-6

418

or stimulus may be responsible for NF-kB activation in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.

419
420

Hypoxia pathway genes were enriched in immature and naïve B cells only in asymptomatic

421

patients (Fig. 4F, Extended Data 6C). Since these individuals are unlikely to be hypoxic (given

422

their lack of symptoms) we postulated that this signature may reflect another hypoxia-inducible

423

factor (HIF) activating stimulus, which includes B cell receptor (BCR) cross-linking41. We

424

assessed the expression of genes associated with BCR activation, such as CD79A/B, and

425

downstream kinases such as BTK in B cell subsets. Overall, BCR activation-associated genes were

426

most highly expressed in B cells in healthy control cells, followed by asymptomatic COVID-19

427

patients, with lower expression observed in all symptomatic COVID-19 groups (Fig. 4G,

428

Extended Data 6D). BCR activation threshold is also modulated by immune tyrosine inhibitory

429

motif (ITIM)-containing receptors that recruit phosphatases, increasing the activation threshold of

430

B cells42. BCR inhibitory gene expression was limited, but CD22 was detectable across B cell

431

subsets in asymptomatic COVID-19, whilst FCGR2B, CD72 and PTPN6 expression was evident

432

in severe COVID-19 B cells (Fig. 4G, Extended Data 6D). Together, this analysis suggests that

433

B cells in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and those with mild disease have a more pronounced

434

response to interferons, increased NF-kB activation, and a higher expression of genes associated

435

with BCR activation signaling, suggesting a potential for greater BCR activation. This may

436

indicate that more avid responses early in disease prevent progression to a more severe phenotype,

437

or may merely reflect the immune response in the early phase of the disease. Longitudinal analysis

438

of patient samples would be required to address this question.

439
440

Following activation, B cells differentiate into antibody-producing plasma cells, accompanied by

441

a progressive increase in oxidative metabolism43,44. We observed differences in metabolic gene

442

pathway expression in plasmablasts and plasma cells between disease severity categories, with

443

enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation pathway genes in critical and severe disease, but increase

444

in glycolysis pathway genes in asymptomatic patient plasmablasts (Fig. 4F, Extended Data 6D).

445
446

We next assessed BCR clonality using dandelion, a novel single cell BCR-sequencing analysis

447

package (see methods), and found significantly more clonal expansion in symptomatic COVID-

448

19 patients compared with those with asymptomatic disease or healthy controls (Fig. 4H,

449

Extended Data 7A). Expanded clonotypes were found across all major cell types with larger

450

clonotypes primarily present in plasmablast/plasma cell clusters (Extended Data 8A-B). Within

451

the expanded clonotypes, there was some evidence of class switching within symptomatic COVID

452

groups but not in the asymptomatic/healthy (Extended Data 8C). Some related BCRs were

453

present in different individuals, with more incidence of V-, J- gene usage and related amino acid

454

sequences of heavy and light chain CDR3s observed in patients with severe or critical disease, and

455

in patients within one of the clinical centres (Newcastle) (Fig. 4I), which could arise due to local

456

variants of the virus driving expansion of specific B cell clones. We note that none of these related

457

BCRs were found to be expanded in the individuals which was expected as only a relatively small

458

number of B cells per individual were sampled. It would have been extremely unlikely to find

459

exactly matching heavy- and light-chain sequences across different individuals (even when

460

allowing for somatic hypermutation variation) given the expected low coverage that arises from a

461

small number of cells (relative to bulk BCR sequencing). Finally, we observed disproportionate

462

distribution in clonotype size, whether considering expanded or all clonotypes, and increased BCR

463

mutation between male and female patients, with greater levels of both in females compared with

464

males (Fig. 4J, Extended Data 7B). These differences in clonal expansion of B cells are consistent

465

with previous reports of worse outcomes in COVID-19 in males45,46.

We summarise the immunological cellular and molecular profiles observed in our study

467

highlighting known and new discoveries as well as the distinguishing features of asymptomatic

468

and milder disease from severe and critical disease (Fig. 5). Future longitudinal studies may enable

469

us to distinguish if the distinct responses in asymptomatic and milder disease prevent progression

to severe phenotypes.

Discussion

473

Our cross-sectional multi-omics peripheral blood mononuclear cell survey of ~130 COVID-19

474

patients and controls across three UK centres revealed several new insights into COVID-19

475

pathogenesis. Firstly, peripheral blood monocytes and DCs exhibit an interferon response to

476

infection and replenish peripheral tissue mononuclear phagocytes such as alveolar macrophages.

477

Secondly, the initial peripheral tissue inflammation and systemic response to COVID-19 is

478

accompanied by altered haematopoiesis that is mirrored in the peripheral circulation evidenced by

479

megakaryocyte-primed gene expression in the earliest CD34+CD38- HSPCs, exaggerated

CD1QA/B/C+CD16+

monocytes

co-express

483
484

We reveal a balance in protective versus immunopathogenic adaptive immune responses in

485

COVID-19 patients. In patients with less severe disease, we found enrichment of circulating Tfh

486

cells, which were previously shown to also be involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection47,48 and Th1

487

cells, which could also confer anti-viral protection49,50. Our findings suggest that an imbalance in

488

CD8 T cell differentiation, including the overexpansion of CD8 effector T cells which likely

489

include antigen-specific short-lived effector cells, could lead to uncontrolled inflammation and

490

immunopathology. Whether the reduced proportion of clonally expanded CD8 effector memory T

491

cells could lead to impaired memory responses in patients with more severe disease remains an

492

open question to be further investigated.

493
494

Similarly, in B cells, expansion of plasmablasts and plasma cells is less evident in critical than in

495

moderate and severe patients. This response is paralleled by the Tfh profile in COVID-19 patients

496

and is consistent with post-mortem observations showing a lack of GCs in lymph nodes and spleen

497

in patients with fatal COVID-19 and a decrease in Tfh48. We observe a diminished IFN-ɑ response

498

in critical and severe patients’ B cell compartments, further emphasising a critical role of these

499

responses in outcomes, as previously reported in COVID-19 patients with anti-type I IFN

500

antibodies51. The presence of common BCRs in samples from one geographical region could

501

reflect local differences in viral strain, with increasing awareness of how viral mutations may

502

influence outcomes, as has been shown to be clinically important for viral transmission with the

503

B.1.1.7 strain52,53.

504
505

Our cross-sectional study demonstrates valuable new insights from multi-omics profiling of

506

peripheral blood as a window to understand peripheral tissue inflammation, as well as bone

507

marrow and systemic responses to acute COVID-19 infection. Our large datasets and web portal

508

provide a foundational resource on COVID-19 for the research and clinical communities.

Ethics and sample collection:

1004

Newcastle:

1005

Patients were consented under the Newcastle Biobank (REC 17/NE/0361, IRAS 233551) study

1006

and ethical governance. For the COVID-19 positive samples and healthy controls, peripheral blood

1007

was collected in EDTA tubes and serum separator tubes and processed within 4 h of collection.

1008
1009

For the IV-LPS control samples: Ethical approval was granted by a REC (17/YH/0021). Healthy

1010

volunteers gave informed, written consent. LPS was obtained from Clinical Center Reference

1011

Endotoxin (Lots 94332B1 donated by National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) and

1012

injected intravenously as a bolus dose of 2 ng/kg. Blood samples were taken prior to IV LPS

1013

administration (baseline) and at 90 min, and 10 h post challenge. Venous blood was drawn from

1014

an 18g venous cannula and was collected into EDTA and serum separator tubes. Only samples

1015

from 90 min and 10 h were analysed in this study.

1017

Cambridge:

1018

Study participants were recruited between 31/3/2020 and 20/7/2020 from patients attending

1019

Addenbrooke’s Hospital with a suspected or nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) confirmed

1020

diagnosis of COVID-19 (including point of care testing (Collier et al., 2020; Mlcochova et al.,

1021

2020)), patients admitted to Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust or Cambridge and

1022

Peterborough Foundation Trust with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, together with Health

1023

Care Workers identified through staff screening as PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Rivett et al.,

1024

2020). Controls were recruited among hospital staff attending Addenbrooke’s serology screening

1025

programme, and selected to cover the whole age spectrum of COVID-19 positive study

1026

participants, across both genders. Only controls with negative serology results (45 out of 47) were

1027

subsequently included in the study. Recruitment of inpatients at Addenbrooke’s Hospital and

1028

Health Care Workers was undertaken by the NIHR Cambridge Clinical Research Facility outreach

UCL/Sanger:

1036

Subjects 18 years and older were included from two large hospital sites in London, United

1037

Kingdom, namely University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Royal Free

1038

London NHS Foundation Trust during the height of the pandemic in the United Kingdom (April

1039

to July 2020). Ethical approval was given through the Living Airway Biobank, administered

1040

through UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health (REC reference: 19/NW/0171, IRAS

1041

project ID 261511), as well as by the local R&D departments at both hospitals. At daily virtual

1042

COVID-19 co-ordination meetings suitable patients were chosen from a list of newly diagnosed

1043

and admitted patients within the preceding 24 h (based on a positive nasopharyngeal swab for

1044

SARS-CoV-2). Patients with typical clinical and radiological COVID-19 features but with a

1045

negative screening test for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded. Other excluding criteria included active

1046

haematological malignancy or cancer, known immunodeficiencies, sepsis from any cause and

1047

blood transfusion within 4 weeks. Maximal severity of COVID-19 was determined retrospectively

1048

by determining the presence of symptoms, the need of oxygen supplementation and the level of

1049

respiratory support. Peripheral blood sampling was performed prior to inclusion to any

1050

pharmacological interventional trials.

1051
1052

Samples were collected and transferred to a Category Level 3 facility at University College London

PBMC isolation and dead cell removal:

1066

Newcastle:

1067

PBMCs were isolated from blood samples using Lymphoprep (StemCell Technologies) density

1068

gradient centrifugation as per manufacturer’s instructions. Single cell suspensions were then

1069

washed with Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Sigma) and frozen in 5-10 million cell

1070

aliquots in 90% (v/v) heat inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) (Gibco) 10% (v/v) DMSO (Sigma

1071

Aldrich). On the day of the experiment the cells were thawed for 1 min, transferred to Wash buffer

1072

(PBS supplemented with 2% (v/v) FCS and 2 mM EDTA), and centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min.

1073

Resuspended cells were passed through a 30 μm filter and counted prior to live cell MACS

1074

enrichment with the Dead cell removal kit (Miltenyi Biotech) as per manufacturer’s instructions.

1075

Cell pellets were resuspended in microbeads and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Each

1076

stained sample was passed through an LS column (Miltenyi Biotec) and rinsed with Binding buffer

1077

(Miltenyi Biotec) before centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in Wash buffer and counted

1078

for CITE-seq antibody staining.

1079
1080

Cambridge:

1081

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using Leucosep tubes (Greiner Bio-

1082

One) with Histopaque 1077 (Sigma) by centrifugation at 800 g for 15 min at room temperature.

1083

PBMCs at the interface were collected, rinsed twice with autoMACS running buffer (Miltenyi

1084

Biotech) and cryopreserved in FBS with 10% DMSO. All samples were processed within 4 h of

1085

collection. Purified PBMCs were thawed at 37°C, transferred to a 50 mL tube and 10 volumes of

1086

pre-warmed thawing media (IMDM (Gibco 12440-053) with 50% (v/v) FCS (not heat inactivated;

1087

Panbiotech P40-37500) and 0.1 mg/mL DNaseI (Worthington LS002139)) were added slowly and

1088

dropwise, followed by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of

1089

FACS buffer (PBS (Sigma D8537) with 3% (v/v) heat-inactivated FCS) and viability of each

1090

sample was assessed by counting in an improved Neubauer chamber using Trypan blue. Pools of

1091

4 samples were generated by combining 0.5 million live cells per individual (2 million live cells

1092

total). The pools were washed twice in FACS buffer (10 mL and 2 mL, respectively) followed by

1093

centrifugation for 5 min at 500 g. The pellet was then resuspended in 35 μL of FACS buffer and

1094

the viability of each pool was assessed.

1095
1096

UCL/Sanger:

1097

Peripheral whole blood was collected in EDTA tubes and processed fresh via Ficoll-Paque Plus

1098

separation (GE healthcare,17144002). The blood was first diluted with 5 mL 2 mM EDTA-PBS

1099

(Invitrogen, 1555785-038), before 10-20 mL of diluted blood was carefully layered onto 15 mL of

1100

Ficoll in a 50 mL falcon tube. If the sample volume was less than 5 mL, blood was diluted with an

1101

equal volume of EDTA-PBS and layered onto 3 mL Ficoll. The sample was centrifuged at 800 g

1102

for 20 min at room temperature. The plasma layer was carefully removed and the peripheral blood

1103

mononuclear cell (PBMC) layer collected using sterile Pasteur pipette. The PBMC layer was

1104

washed with 3 volumes of EDTA-PBS by centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min. The pellet was

1105

suspended in EDTA-PBS and centrifuged again at 300 g for 5 min. The PBMC pellet was collected

1106

and the cell number and viability assessed using Trypan blue. Cell freezing medium (90% FBS,

1107

10% DMSO) was added dropwise to PBMCs slowly on ice and the mixture cryopreserved at -

1108

80°C until further full sample processing.

Total-seq C antibody staining and 10x Chromium loading

1111

Newcastle:

1112

200,000 cells from each donor were stained with Human TruStain FcX™ Fc Blocking Reagent

1113

(Biolegend 422302) for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were then stained with the custom

1114

panel Total-seq C (Biolegend 99813; see Supplementary Table 2) for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were

1115

then washed twice with PBS supplemented with 2% (v/v) FCS and 2 mM EDTA (Sigma) before

1116

resuspending in PBS and counting. 20,000-30,000 cells per sample were loaded onto the 10x

1117

Chromium controller using Chromium NextGEM Single Cell V(D)J Reagent kits v1.1 with

1118

Feature Barcoding technology for Cell Surface Protein (10x Genomics) according to the

1119

manufacturer’s protocol.

Cambridge:

1122

Half a million viable cells were resuspended in 25 μL of FACS buffer and incubated with 2.5 μL

1124

TotalSeq-C™ antibody cocktail (BioLegend 99813; see Supplementary Table 2) was centrifuged

1125

at 14,000 g at 4°C for 1 min, resuspended in 52 μL of FACS buffer, incubated at room temperature

1126

for 5 min and centrifuged at 14,000 g at 4°C for 10 min. 25 μL were subsequently added to each

1127

sample pool and incubated for 30 min at 4°C in the dark. Pools were washed 3 times with 27

1128

volumes (1.4 mL) of FACS buffer, followed by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min. The pellet was

1129

resuspended in 62.5 µL of 1 x PBS + 0.04% BSA (Ambion, #AM2616), filtered through a 40 μm

1130

cell strainer (Flowmi, H13680-0040) and viable cells of each sample pool were counted in an

1131

improved Neubauer chamber using Trypan blue. 50,000 live cells (up to a maximum of 60,000

1132

total cells) for each pool were processed using Single Cell V(D)J 5’ version 1.1 (1000020) together

1133

with Single Cell 5’ Feature Barcode library kit (1000080), Single Cell V(D)J Enrichment Kit,

1134

Human B Cells (1000016) and Single Cell V(D)J Enrichment Kit, Human T Cells (1000005) (10x

1135

Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocols.

1136
1137

UCL/Sanger:

1138

Frozen PBMC samples were thawed quickly in a water bath at 37°C. Warm RPMI1640 medium

1139

(20-30 mL) containing 10% FBS was added slowly to the cells before centrifuging at 300 g for 5

1140

min, the pellet was then washed with 5 mL RPMI1640-FBS and centrifuged again (300 g for 5

1141

min). The PBMC pellet was collected and cell number and viability determined using Trypan blue.

1142

PBMCs from four different donors were then pooled together at equal numbers (1.25x105 PBMCs

1143

from each donor) to make up 5.0x105 cells in total. The remaining cells were used for DNA

1144

extraction (Qiagen, 69504). The pooled PBMCs were stained with TotalSeq-C antibodies

1145

(Biolegend, 99814) according to manufacturer’s instructions. After incubating with 0.5 vial of

1146

TotalSeq-C for 30 min at 4°C, PBMCs were washed three times by centrifugation at 500 g for 5

1147

min at 4°C. PBMCs were counted again and processed immediately for 10x 5’ single cell capture

1148

(Chromium Next GEM Single Cell V(D)J Reagent Kit v1.1 with Feature Barcoding technology

1149

for cell Surface Protein-Rev D protocol). Two lanes of 25,000 cells were loaded per pool on a 10x

Library preparation and sequencing

1156

Newcastle and UCL/Sanger:

1157

Gene expression, TCR enriched and BCR enriched libraries were prepared for each sample

1158

according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10x Genomics). Cell surface protein libraries were

1159

subjected to double the manufacturer’s recommended primer concentration and 7-8 amplification

1160

cycles during the sample index PCR to reduce the likelihood of daisy chains forming. Libraries

1161

were pooled per patient using the following ratio 6:2:1:1 for gene expression, cell surface

1162

protein, TCR enriched and BCR enriched libraries. All libraries were sequenced using a

1163

NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) to achieve a minimum of 50,000 paired end reads per cell for gene

1164

expression and 20,000 paired end reads per cell for cell surface protein, TCR enriched and BCR

1165

enriched.

1166
1167

Cambridge:

1168

The samples were subjected to 12 cycles of cDNA amplification and 8 cycles for the cell surface

1169

protein library construction. Following this, the libraries were processed according to the

1170

manufacturer's protocol. Libraries were pooled per sample using a ratio 9:2.4:1:0.6 for gene

1171

expression, cell surface, TCR enriched and BCR enriched libraries. Samples were sequenced using

1172

a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina), using S1 flowcells.

1173
1174

Alignment and quantification

1175

Droplet libraries were processed using Cellranger v4.0. Reads were aligned to the GRCh38 human

1176

genome concatenated to the SARS-Cov-2 genome (NCBI SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1)

1177

using STAR55 and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) deduplicated. CITE-seq UMIs were

1178

counted for GEX and ADT libraries simultaneously to generate feature X droplet UMI count

1179

matrices.

1180
1181

Doublet identification

1182

Newcastle:

1183

Scrublet (v0.2.1) was applied to each sample to generate a doublet score. These formed a bimodal

1184

distribution so the tool’s automatic threshold was applied.

1185

1186

Cambridge:

1187

Non-empty droplets were called within each multiplexed pool of donors using the emptyDrops

1188

function implemented in the Bioconductor package DropletUtils, using a UMI threshold of 100

1189

and FDR of 1%. The probability of being a doublet was estimated for each cell per sample (that is

1190

one 10x lane) using the “doubletCells” function in scran based on highly variable genes (HVGs).

1191

Next, we used “cluster_walktrap” on the SNN-Graph that was computed on HVGs to form highly

1192

resolved clusters per sample. Per-sample clusters with either a median doublet score greater than

1193

the median + 2.5 x MAD or clusters containing more than the median + 2.5 MAD genotype

1194

doublets were tagged as doublets. This was followed by a second round of highly-resolved

1195

clustering across the whole data set, in which again cells belonging to clusters with a high

1196

proportion (> 60%) of cells previously labelled as doublets were also defined as doublets.

1197
1198

UCL/Sanger:

1199

For pooled donor CITE-seq samples, the donor ID of each cell was determined by genotype-based

1200

demultiplexing using souporcell version 256. Souporcell analyses were performed with

1201

‘skip_remap’ enabled and a set of known donor genotypes given under the ‘common_variants’

1202

parameter. The donor ID of each souporcell genotype cluster was annotated by comparing each

1203

souporcell genotype to the set of known genotypes. Droplets that contained more than one

1204

genotype according to souporcell were flagged as ‘ground-truth’ doublets for heterotypic doublet

1205

identification. Ground-truth doublets were used by DoubletFinder 2.0.357 to empirically determine

1206

an optimal ‘pK’ value for doublet detection. DoubletFinder analysis was performed on each

1207

sample separately using 10 principal components, a ‘pN’ value of 0.25, and the ‘nExp’ parameter

1208

estimated from the fraction of ground-truth doublets and the number of pooled donors.

1209
1210

CITE-seq background signal removal

1211

Background antibody- and non-specific staining was subtracted from ADT counts in each data set

1212

from the 3 data acquisition sites separately. ADT counts for each protein were first normalised

1213

using counts per million (CPM) and log transformed, with a +1 pseudocount. To estimate the

1214

background signal for each protein, a 2-component gaussian mixture model (GMM), implemented

1215

in the mclust R package function Mclust, was fit across the droplets with a total UMI count > 10

1216

and < 100 from each experimental sample separately. The mean of the first GMM component for

1217

each protein was then subtracted from the log CPM from the QC-passed droplets in the respective

1218

experimental sample.

1219
1220

Quality control, normalisation, embedding and clustering

1221

Combined raw data from the three centres was filtered to remove those that expressed fewer than

1222

200 genes and >10% mitochondrial reads. Data was normalised (scanpy: normalize_total), log+1

1223

corrected (scanpy: log1p) and highly variable genes identified using the Seurat vst algorithm

1224

(scanpy: highly_variable_genes). Harmony was used to adjust principal components by sample ID

1225

and used to generate the neighbourhood graph and embedded using UMAP. Clustering was

1226

performed using the Leiden algorithm with an initial resolution of 3. For initial clustering,

1227

differentially expressed genes were calculated using Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

1228
1229

Cluster differential abundance testing

1230

Numbers of cells of each cell subtype were quantified in each patient and control sample (donors)

1231

to compute a cell type X donor counts matrix. Cell type abundance counts were modelled as a

1232

function of either disease severity or days from symptom onset, adjusting for age, gender and

1233

batch, in a NB GLM, implemented in the Bioconductor package edgeR. Counts were normalised

1234

in the model using the (log) of the total numbers of all cells captured for each donor. Hypothesis

1235

testing was performed using quasi-likelihood F-test for either a linear or quadratic trend across

1236

disease severity groups (asymptomatic > mild > moderate > severe > critical), or comparing

1237

healthy controls to SARS-CoV-2 infected donors (healthy vs. all asymptomatic, mild, moderate,

1238

severe & critical). Differentially abundant cell types were determined using a 10% false discovery

1239

rate (FDR). Due to compositional differences across sites, when analysing differential abundance

1240

of myeloid populations (figure 2), only samples from Ncl and UCL/Sanger were included.

1241
1242

Relative importance of metadata on cell type composition

1243

The number of cells for each sample (N=110 samples in total with complete metadata) and cell

1244

type (18 different cell types in total) combination was modelled with a generalised linear mixed

1245

model with a Poisson outcome. The 5 clinical factors (COVID-19 swab result, age, sex, disease

1246

severity at day 0 and days from onset) and the 2 technical factors (patient and sequencing centre)

1247

were fitted as random effects to overcome the collinearlity among the factors. The effect of each

1248

clinical/technical factor on cell type composition was estimated by the interaction term with the

1249

cell type (see Supplementary Note 1 for detail). The likelihood ratio test was performed to assess

1250

the statistical significance of each factor on cell type abundance by removing one interaction term

1251

from the full model at a time. The number of factors was used to adjust multiple testing with the

1252

Bonferroni approach. The ‘glmer’ function in the lme4 package implemented on R was used to fit

1253

the model. The standard error of variance parameter for each factor was estimated using the

1254

numDeriv package.

1255
1256

Cydar Analysis

1257

We utilized cydar to identify changes in cell composition across the different severity groups based

1258

on the protein data alone. First, the background-corrected protein counts from the three different

1259

sites were integrated using the ‘fastMNN’ method (k = 20, d = 50, cos.norm = TRUE) in scran58.

1260

The batch-corrected counts for 188 proteins (4 rat/mouse antibody isotypes were removed) were

1261

then used to construct hyperspheres using the ‘countCells’ function (downsample = 8) with the

1262

tolerance parameter chosen so that each hypersphere has at least 20 cells which was estimated

1263

using the ‘neighborDistances’ function. To assess whether the abundance of cells in each

1264

hypersphere are associated with disease status, hypersphere counts were analyzed using the quasi-

1265

likelihood (QL) method in edgeR. After filtering out hyperspheres with an average count per

1266

sample below 5 we fitted a mean-dependent trend to the NB dispersion estimates. The trended

1267

dispersion for each hypersphere was used to fit a NB GLM using the log-transformed total number

1268

of cells as the offset for each sample and blocking for sex, age and batch. The QL F-test was used

1269

to compute P values for each hypersphere which were corrected for multiple testing using the

1270

spatial FDR method in cydar.

1271
1272

Comparisons of PBMC annotation using the Azimuth tool

1273

The final annotation of PBMCs was compared to a published PBMC annotation using the Azimuth

1274

tool (http://azimuth.satijalab.org/app/azimuth). Because of size restrictions of 100,000 cells, our

1275

data was subsampled to 10% of the total cells. After running the algorithm, results with a prediction

1276

score < 0.5 were removed (5.8% of total removed). For each cluster in the COVID-19 PBMC data,

1277

the percentage of cells mapped to each cluster in the Azimuth annotation was calculated.

1279

Interferon, TNF and JAK-STAT response scoring

1280

A list of genes related to response to type I interferons was obtained from the GSEA Molecular

1281

Signatures Database (MSigDB) (GO: 0034340). Enrichment of the interferon score was measured

1282

using the tl.score_genes tool in scanpy which subtracts the average expression of all genes in the

1283

dataset from the average expression of the genes in this list. The scores were averaged across

1284

clusters and clinical status and expressed as a fold-change over the interferon score in the

1285

equivalent healthy cluster.

1286
1287

kBET analysis

1288

The kBET59 algorithm (https://github.com/theislab/kBET) was run for each cluster defined in Fig.

1289

1 using the Uniform manifold and projection (UMAP) coordinates generated from Harmony-

1290

adjusted principal components, and the sample number as the batch factor. The same procedure

1291

was then performed using the same annotation but using the UMAP coordinates generated from

1292

non-Harmony-adjusted principal components. The resultant rejection rates were averaged across

1293

clusters and compared using a Wilcoxon paired signed rank test.

1294
1295

Bronchoalveolar lavage data analysis

1296

ScRNAseq data from BAL was obtained from GEO (accession number GSE145926 29). Raw data

1297

was analysed using the same pipeline as PBMC data, specifically using the same quality control

1298

cut-offs (min of 200 genes and <10% mitochondrial reads/cell) and batch-corrected using

1299

Harmony by donor ID. To gain greater resolution of mononuclear phagocytes the DC and

1300

macrophages were analysed with further rounds of sub-clustering to identify DC1, DC2 and

1301

mature DC.

1302
1303

PAGA analysis of blood monocytes and BAL macrophages

1304

Annotated raw expression datasets of BAL macrophages and COVID-19 PBMCs were merged

1305

and data log-normalised and scaled as for the original datasets. The top 3000 highly variable genes

1306

were chosen using the Seurat “vst” method and used for downstream analysis. Principal

1307

components were batch corrected by donor and used to build a neighborhood graph. The PAGA

1308

tool in scanpy (tl.paga) was used to generate the abstracted graph between clusters.

CellphoneDB

1311

CellphoneDB60 was used to assess putative interactions between monocytes (CD14_mono,

1312

CD83_CD14_mono, C1_CD16_mono, CD16_mono, Prolif_mono) and platelets. The tool was run

1313

for 100 iterations and an expression threshold of 0.25 (limiting the analysis to genes expressed by

1314

25% of cells). For downstream analysis we focused on interactions between platelets and any

1315

monocyte subset.

1316
1317

HPSC commitment scoring

1318

HPSCs were subsetted from the data and Leiden clusters generated using the same pipeline and

1319

parameters as for the whole PBMC dataset. Differentially expressed genes between the HSPC

1320

clusters that showed evidence of lineage commitment (MK, Erythroid and Myeloid) were

1321

calculated using FindAllMarkers tool in Seurat (with thresholds of genes expressed by 25% of

1322

cells and with a log fold-change of 0.25) and genes with an adjusted p-value cut-off of 0.05 were

1323

used to generate gene signatures for each. Enrichment of these signatures in the CD38 negative

1324

and CD38 positive HSPC clusters were calculated using the tl.score_genes in scanpy. The average

1325

expression of these enrichment scores in the CD38 negative and CD38 positive HSPC clusters was

1326

calculated and normalised to their expression in healthy patients.

Multiplex cytokine analysis

GSEA analysis

1375

Pre-ranked gene set analysis (prGSEA) on MSigDB v7.2 Hallmark genesets 61 was performed

1376

using pre-ranked gene lists with fgsea62 in R. Genes were pre-ranked according to signed -log10 P-

1377

values for all prGSEA procedures. For B cells, generation of rank gene list was performed using

1378

Wilcoxon rank sum test (via tl.rank_genes_groups in scanpy) with each Day 0 COVID statuses

1379

(asymptomatic to symptomatic critical) as the “tests” versus Day 0 Healthy samples as

1380

“reference/control”.

1381
1382

T cell clustering, annotation and visualisation

1383

Droplets labelled as T cells (“CD4”, “CD8”, “Treg”, “MAIT”, “gdT”) were subset from those in

1384

Fig. 1B and re-clustered using a set of HVGs calculated within each batch, the union of which

1385

were used to estimate the first 50 principal components across cells using the irbla R package.

1386

Batch effects were removed across the first 30 PCs using the fastMNN58 implementation in the

1387

Bioconductor package batchelor (k=50). A k-nearest neighbour graph (k=20) was computed

1388

across these 30 batch-integrated PCs using the buildKNNGraph function implemented in the

1389

Bioconductor package scran, which was then used to group cells into connected communities

1390

using Louvain63 clustering implemented in the R package igraph. Clusters that displayed mixed

1391

profiles of T and other lymphoid lineages, i.e. CD19, CD20 and immunoglobulin genes, were

1392

classed as doublets and removed from down-stream analyses. Clusters indicative of NK cells

1393

(CD3-CD56+) were subsequently annotated as such and removed from T cell analyses. Remaining

1394

clusters were annotated using a combination of canonical protein & mRNA (italicised) markers

1395

for major αβ T cells (CD4, CD8, CCR7, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD62L, CD27, CD38, CD44,

1396

CXCR5, CD40LG CCR7, FOXP3, IKZF2), γδT cells (Vγ9, Vγ2, TRGV9, TRDV2) and invariant

1397

T cells; MAIT (Vα24-Jα18, TRAV1.2), NKT (CD3, CD16, CD56, NCAM1, NCR1, FCGR3A).

1398

Polarized CD4+ T cell annotations were refined using the combination of transcription factor genes

1399

and expressed cytokines for the respective helper T cell types: Th1 (IFNG, TBX21, TNFA), Th2

1400

(GATA3, IL4, IL5), Th17 (RORC, IL17A, IL17F, IL21). Where clusters appeared heterogeneous in

1401

1402

expression of specific marker gene and protein pairs. Dot plots to visualise marker protein and

1403

mRNA expression across clusters were generated using the R package ggplot2. UMAP64 was used

1404

to project all single T cells into a 2D space (k=31) using the first 30 batch-integrated PCs as input

1405

using the R package umap.

1406
1407

T cell differential gene expression analysis

1408

Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis was performed across COVID-19 disease severity

1409

groups, ordered from healthy > asymptomatic > mild > moderate > severe > critical. Donor

1410

pseudo-bulk samples were first created by aggregating gene counts for each annotated T cell type,

1411

within each donor, where there were at least 20 cells of that type. Genes with fewer than 3 counts

1412

in any given pseudo-bulk, or fewer than 5 counts in total across donor pseudo-bulk samples, were

1413

removed prior to analysis. DGE testing was performed using a negative binomial generalized

1414

linear model (NB GLM) implemented in the Bioconductor package edgeR65,66. Statistically

1415

significant DE genes were defined with FDR < 0.1. Functional annotation enrichment was

1416

performed using the Bioconductor package enrichR67. Up- and down-regulated DE genes in each

1417

T cell type were used as input, testing separately against the MSigDB Hallmark 2020 and

1418

Transcription Factor Protein-Protein Interactions gene sets. Significant enrichments were defined

1419

with 1% FDR.

1420
1421

T cell receptor analysis

1422

Single-cell TCRs were computed from the TCR-seq data using Cellranger v4.0.0. The unfiltered

1423

output of reconstructed TCR contigs across all 3 sites (Newcastle, Cambridge, UCL) were

1424

combined prior to filtering using: 1) full length CDR3, 2) droplet barcode matched a T cell droplet,

1425

3) productive CDR3 spanning V+J genes. Chain-specific TCR clones were defined for each

1426

observed α and β chain by first concatenating the V, J and identical CDR3 nucleotide sequences.

1427

For each single T cell, these chains were then combined to form a single clonotype, removing cells

1428

that contained: 1) > 2 β chains and > 2 α chains, 2) a single α or a single β chain only. T cells with

1429

exactly 2 β chains and 1 α chain, or those with exactly 2 α chains and 1 β chain were retained. TCR

1430

clonotypes were counted within each donor sample, and expanded clones were defined where > 1

1431

cell was assigned to the TCR clonotype.

1433

The proportion of expanded clones as a function of a linear trend across disease severity groups

1434

was modelled using logistic regression, adjusted for age, gender and batch. A separate model was

1435

run for each T cell subtype which contained at least 5 cells assigned to the expanded TCR

1436

clonotypes. Linear trend p-values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini &

1437

Hochberg procedure68.

1438
1439

The TE:EM ratio was calculated within each donor, using the number of observed expanded

1440

clonotypes. The TE:EM ratio change across COVID-19 severity was tested using a robust linear

1441

model implemented in the R package robustbase, regressing TE:EM ratio on disease severity as

1442

an ordered linear variable (asymptomatic > mild > moderate > severe > critical), adjusted for age,

1443

gender and batch. Statistical significance was defined based on the linear trend across disease

1444

severity (p ≤ 0.01).

1445
1446

Differential correlation analysis

1447

Changes in the correlations between PBMC cell types were computed using a differential

1448

correlation analysis, implemented in the R package DCARS69. Cell type proportions were

1449

computed by normalizing the counts of each cell type within each donor by the total number of

1450

cells captured for that donor sample. Donor samples were ranked according to their disease

1451

severity (healthy > asymptomatic > mild > moderate > severe > critical). Differential correlation

1452

analysis was then performed between CD4.Tfh vs all B cell types. Statistically significant

1453

differentially correlated cell types were defined with empirical p-value ≤ 0.05, estimated from

1454

10,000 permutations.

1455
1456

BCR V(D)J analysis

1457

Single-cell V(D)J data from the 5’ Chromium 10x kit were initially processed with cellranger-vdj

1458

(4.0.0). BCR contigs contained in filtered_contigs.fasta and filtered_contig_annotations.csv from

1459

all three sites were then pre-processed using immcantion inspired preprocessing pipeline70

1460

implemented in the dandelion python package; dandelion is a novel single cell BCR-seq analysis

1461

package for 10x Chromium 5' data. All steps outlined below are performed using dandelion

v0.0.26 and is available at https://github.com/zktuong/dandelion.

1464

BCR preprocessing

1465

Individual BCR contigs were re-annotated with igblastn v1.1.15 using the IMGT reference

1466

database (date downloaded: 30-June-2020)71 by calling changeo’s AssignGenes.py script and re-

1467

annotated contigs in blast format were parsed into the Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire

1468

(AIRR) standards 1.3 format with changeo’s MakeDB.py script. Amino acid sequence alignment

1469

information not present in the output from blast format were retrieved from re-annotation with

1470

igblastn in airr format. Heavy chain V-gene alleles were corrected for individual genotypes with

1471

TIgGER72 (v1.0.0) using a modified tigger-genotype.R script from immcantation suite. Germline

1472

sequences were reconstructed based on the genotype corrected V-gene assignments using

1473

changeo’s (v1.0.1) CreateGermines.py script; contigs which fail germline sequence reconstruction

1474

were removed from further analysis. Constant genes were re-annotated using blastn (v2.10.0+)

1475

with CH1 regions of constant gene sequences from IMGT followed by pairwise alignment against

1476

curated sequences to correct assignment errors due to insufficient length of constant regions.

1477
1478

BCR filtering

1479

Contigs assigned to cells that passed quality control on the transcriptome data were retained for

1480

further quality control assessment, which includes checks for: i) contigs with mismatched locus,

1481

V-, J- and constant gene assignments were removed from the analysis; ii) cell barcodes with

1482

multiple heavy chain contigs were flagged for filtering. Exceptions to this would be when a) the

1483

multiple heavy chain contigs were assessed to have identical V(D)J sequences but assigned as

1484

different contigs belonging to the same cell by cellranger-vdj, b) when there is a clear dominance

1485

(assessed by difference in UMI count) by a particular contig, and c) if and when there is presence

1486

of one IgM and one IgD contig assigned to a single cell barcode. In the first two cases, the contig

1487

with the highest UMI count is retained; iii) cell barcodes with multiple light chain contigs were

1488

flagged for filtering; iv) in situations where cell barcodes are matched with only light chain contigs,

1489

the contigs would be dropped from the V(D)J data but transcriptome barcode will be retained.

1490
1491

B cell clone/clonotype definition

1492

BCRs were grouped into clones/clonotypes based on the following sequential criterion that applies

1493

to both heavy chain and light chain contigs – i) identical V- and J- gene usage, ii) identical

1494

junctional CDR3 amino acid length, and iii) at least 85% amino acid sequence similarity at the

1495

CDR3 junction (based on hamming distance). Light chain pairing is performed using the same

1496

criterion within each heavy chain clone. Only samples collected at day 0 of the study were analyzed

1497

from this step onwards and clones/clonotypes were called across the entire dataset; the sample

1498

from one of the donors who was subsequently found to have a B cell malignancy was separated

1499

from the analysis and processed independently.

1500
1501

B cell clone/clonotype network

1502

Single-cell BCR networks were constructed using adjacency matrices computed from pairwise

1503

Levenshtein distance of the full amino acid sequence alignment for BCR(s) contained in every pair

1504

of cells within each disease severity cohort. Construction of the Levenshtein distance matrices

1505

were performed separately for heavy chain and light chain contigs and the sum of the total edit

1506

distance across all layers/matrices was used as the final adjacency matrix. To construct the BCR

1507

neighborhood graph, a minimum spanning tree was constructed on the adjacency matrix for each

1508

clone/clonotype, creating a simple graph with edges indicating the shortest edit distance between

1509

a B cell and its nearest neighbor. Cells with identical BCRs i.e. cells with a total pairwise edit

1510

distance of zero are then connected to the graph to recover edges trimmed off during the minimum

1511

spanning tree construction step. Fruchterman-reingold graph layout was generated using a

1512

modified method to prevent singletons from flying out to infinity in networkx (v2.5). Visualisation

1513

of the resulting single-cell BCR network is achieved via transferring the graph to relevant anndata

1514

slots, allowing for access to plotting tools in scanpy.

1515
1516

The use of the BCR network properties for computing gini indices was inspired from bulk BCR-

1517

seq network analysis methods where distribution of clone sizes and vertex sizes (sum of identical

1518

BCR reads) in BCR clone networks were used to infer the relationships between BCR clonality,

1519

somatic hypermutation and diversity73. However, there are challenges with native implementation

1520

of this approach for single-cell data. Firstly, to enable calculation of network-based clone/cluster

1521

and vertex/node size distribution, BCR networks needed to be reduced such that nodes/cells with

1522

identical BCRs had to be merged and counted; this required the re-construction of BCR networks

1523

per sample and discarding single-cell level information. Furthermore, the process of node

1524

contraction and counting of merging events requires significant computation time and resource.

1525

Secondly, this approach is dependent on sufficient coverage of the BCR repertoire, as the BCRs

52

1526

from the number of cells sampled (post-QC) may not necessarily recapitulate the entire repertoire,

1527

which may under- or over-represent merged counts for gini index calculation. We propose the use

1528

of node closeness centrality computed on each expanded clone (clone size > 1) as an alternative

1529

metric to emulate the statistics to adapt to the single-cell nature of the data; closeness centrality

1530

defines how close and central each node is with respect to other nodes in the graph and therefore

1531

cells with identical BCRs will have high closeness centrality scores, due to the way the BCR

1532

network is constructed in dandelion. Thus, we can quickly calculate if cells across clones, and/or

1533

samples overall, in the entire graph display proportionately/disproportionately high or low

1534

closeness centrality scores. One caveat to the current implementation is that it is only meaningful

1535

if there are clonotypes with at least two cells as scores will only be computed for non-singleton

1536

components of the graph. Gini indices are computed using skbio.diversity.alpha.gini_index (scikit-

1537

bio v0.5.6) with the trapezoids method after clone definition and network generation. Summary

1538

visualisation was performed using plotting tools in seaborn (v0.11.0).

1539
1540

Definition of BCR convergence across patients

1541

BCR overlap was determined by collapsing sharing incidence of V- and J- gene usage and CDR3

1542

amino acid sequences, in both heavy and light chains, between individuals into a binarized format

1543

(1 or 0). The information is turned into an adjacency matrix where an edge is created between two

1544

individuals if there is at least one clonotype (at least 1 cell from each individual displays an

1545

identical combination of heavy and light chain V- and J- gene usage with allowance for somatic

1546

hypermutation at the CDR3 junctional region) that is similar between the two individuals.

1547

Visualisation is achieved using the CircosPlot function from nxviz package (v0.6.2).
