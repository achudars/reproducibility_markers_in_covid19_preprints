Abstract

19

Background: Colostrum provides an immune sharing between a mother and her infant. The

20

transfer in colostrum of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the elicited cytokines may provide

21

crucial protection to the infant. There is limited literature on the immune response to SARS-

22

CoV-2 present in colostrum.

23

Objective: To evaluate the presence of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 and the associated

24

cytokines in colostrum from women who tested positive for the virus.

25

Study Design: Between March and September 2020 we obtained bilateral colostrum samples

26

collected on spot cards within 48 hours of delivery from 15 new mothers who had previously

27

tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Five of these 15 COVID-19 positive women also provided

28

bilateral liquid colostrum within 1-2 days of providing the spot card samples. Archived bilateral

29

colostrum samples collected from 8 women during 2011-2013 were used as pre-COVID-19

30

controls. All samples were tested for reactivity to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using an ELISA that measures SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgA,

32

IgG, and IgM, and for concentrations of 10 inflammatory cytokines (IFNg, TNFa, IL-1b, IL-2,

33

IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13) using a multiplex electrochemiluminescent sandwich

34

assay.

35

Results: Bilateral colostrum samples from 73%, 73% and 33% of the 15 COVID-19 mothers

36

exhibited IgA, IgG, and IgM reactivity to RBD respectively. Colostrum samples from two of the

37

8 pre-pandemic controls showed IgA and IgG reactivity to RBD. Additionally, COVID-19

38

mothers had significantly higher levels of 9 of the 10 inflammatory markers (all except IFNg) as

39

compared to the pre-COVID-19 controls. Comparable results were obtained with both the spot

40

card-eluates and liquid samples.

41

Conclusions: A strong humoral immune response is present in the colostrum of women who

42

were infected with SARS-CoV-2 before delivering. High levels of 9 inflammatory markers were

43

also present in the colostrum. The evolution and duration of the antibody response, as well as

44

dynamics of the cytokine response, remain to be determined. Our results also indicate that future

45

large-scale studies can be conducted with milk easily collected on paper spot cards.

INTRODUCTION

48

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization (WHO)

49

recommend breast-feeding for mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2, as the benefits of mother’s

50

milk are thought to outweigh potential risks of transmitting the virus to the infant1,2. A recent

51

systematic review, reporting on 77 nursing mothers from 37 studies concluded that there was no

52

convincing evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via breastmilk3. As of December 14th,

53

2020, the WHO reported over 71 million people infected by SARS-CoV-2 globally, and over 1.5

million deaths. As the number of pregnant and lactating SARS-CoV-2-infected women

55

increases, there is a need to build on existing, yet limited, research on SARS-CoV-2-specific-

56

antibodies and immune response in breast milk from infected women. Antibodies to SARS-CoV-

57

2 and cytokines in breast milk are relevant to the health of nursed babies and mothers1,2,4,5.

58

Multiple studies have reported an increase in inflammatory cytokines in the serum and

59

bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of COVID-19-infected individuals6–12. However, there are no

60

reports on the cytokine profiles in breast milk of women with COVID-19. Published literature

61

suggests that the transfer of cytokines via breast milk can impact an infant’s immune system,

62

conferring protection against various infectious diseases and allergies13,14. We15,16 and

63

others13,14,17 have measured cytokines in breast milk and colostrum. Understanding cytokine

64

profiles in breast milk of COVID-19-infected women is particularly relevant, as a preliminary

65

study indicates that expression of ACE2 is elevated in the mammary epithelium during

66

pregnancy, and through JAK-STAT pathways cytokines can influence ACE2 promoter

67

activation18. Antibody-mediated protection from SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk has clinical

68

implications regarding the discussion about breast-feeding after infection. Prolonged antibody

69

presence may ultimately influence the maternal decision to breast-feed and aid in the support a

70

mother receives post-partum. The present study details findings regarding SARS-CoV-2-specific

71

IgA, IgG, and IgM, and cytokine profiles in bilateral samples of colostrum collected within the

72

first few days after parturition from 15 infected women and compares these results to colostrum

73

obtained from pre-COVID-19 samples collected during 2011-2013.

77

Study participants were patients at UMass Memorial Medical Center (UMMC, Worcester, MA)

78

and provided consent in accordance with an IRB-approved protocol (H00020140). Fifteen

79

participants who tested positive, and one participant (P01) who tested negative for the SARS-

80

CoV-2 RNA, provided bilateral colostrum on the day of, or the day after delivery. Participants

81

hand-expressed colostrum from each breast onto spot cards (Whatman® FTA® card, Millipore

82

Sigma, #WHAWB120205); which were left to dry at room temperature (RT).

83

Of the 16 participants who provided bilateral colostrum on spot cards, six participants

84

also provided liquid bilateral colostrum within two days after providing the spot card samples.

85

Participants hand-expressed or pumped colostrum equivalent to 5-10 mL from each breast into

86

containers. The spot cards and liquid samples were stored at -80°C at UMMC until transferred to

87

the laboratory at UMass Amherst at which point the spot cards were stored at RT and the liquid

88

samples were stored at -20°C.

Selection of pre-COVID-19 controls

91

We identified archived samples from eight women who donated liquid bilateral colostrum (1-3

92

days post-partum) during June 2011-May 2013. These colostrum samples were obtained

93

following IRB-approved protocols.

Briefly, 500 µL of colostrum was centrifuged at 820g for 8 minutes. The whey fraction was

106

transferred to a 2 mL centrifuge tube and heat-treated for 30 minutes at 56°C. Samples from the

107

whey fraction were used for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins. Extra

114

HEK293T cells (ATCC) using PEI (10:1 PEI:DNA ratio) and purified by gravity flow, as

115

described in Stadlbauer et al19. Briefly, 96-well plates (Fisher Sci., #351172) were coated with

124

concentrations of anti-Spike-RBD-human (h) IgG1, -hIgM and -hIgA1 (InvivoGen, San Diego,

125

CA, #C3022) were assayed in the ELISAs. The concentration of the highest standard was 1250

126

ng/mL; subsequent standards were prepared by 10-fold serial dilutions starting from 500 ng/mL

127

to 0.05 ng/mL. After background subtraction, concentration curves for IgA, IgG and IgM were

128

generated using a four-parametric logistic (4PL) curve with Excel’s Solver Add-In.

129

Concentrations of unknown samples were calculated using the 4PL equation.

131

Analysis of cytokines

132

Cytokines were measured in a multiplex assay (Mesoscale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD)

133

according to the manufacturer’s instructions using 10-plex human V-PLEX Proinflammatory

134

Panel 1 plates. Each 96-well plate included an 8-point standard curve and assays for ten

135

cytokines: IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-1, IFN-g, TNF-a (upper and lower

136

limits of detection are in Table S1). Samples and standards were run in technical duplicates.

137
138

Data Analysis

139

Welch’s t-test was used to assess differences in age and BMI between donations made during

140

2020 and during 2011-2013. Student’s t-test was used to compute differences between cytokines.

141

P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. Multiple

142

linear regression using the lm() function was performed in R (version 4.0.2) to assess correlations

143

between levels of anti-RBD IgA, IgG and IgM and cytokines.

Participant Demographics

147

Demographic characteristics of the 24 women are summarized in Table 1, stratified by the

148

period of colostrum donation: ‘2020’ (COVID-19) versus ‘2011-2013’ (Pre-COVID-19

149

controls). Groups did not differ significantly by age or BMI. Colostrum collected during 2011-

150

2013 was exclusively from women who identified as White (one woman did not provide

151

information on race). Women who provided colostrum in 2020 were more diverse: they self-

152

identified as 31% Hispanic, 13% White Hispanic, 50% non-Hispanic White, and one woman

153

identified as Asian American.

154

Eleven of the 15 participants tested positive for COVID-19 near the time of delivery (0-4

155

days (Figure 1). The 4 participants who did not test positive near the time of delivery (P13, P14,

156

P15, and P16), had their most recent positive test 16 to 116 days before delivery (Figure 1). Six

157

of the 15 COVID-19pos participants reported no symptoms. All of the participants reporting no

158

symptoms (P02, P04, P05, P08, P10 and P11) had their first positive test within 1-3 days of

159

delivery. Onset of symptoms for the remaining 9 participants occurred between 27-144 days

160

before delivery (Figure 1). Eight of the 9 participants reported that onset of symptoms occurred

161

at the time of the first positive test; the ninth participant (P09) reported onset of symptoms 18

162

days before her first positive test.

169

SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19pos) tests, and one woman (P01) who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.

170

Five of the 15 COVID-19pos participants and P01 also provided liquid bilateral colostrum

171

samples within 2 days after providing the spot card sample. Eight liquid bilateral colostrum

172

samples donated as part of other studies during 2011-2013 served as pre-pandemic controls. All

173

samples were tested in technical replicates. The low mean CVs of 3.21%, 3.9% and 4.4% for

174

IgA, IgG and IgM assays respectively (Figure S1) demonstrate the high precision of the assay.

175

Positive cut-off values for each assay were set at twice the mean OD levels for

176

secondary-only antibody reactivities (background). The binding reactivities of IgA, IgG and IgM

177

were similar between colostrum obtained from left and right breasts (Figure 2A, B, and C). For

178

spot cards, Figures 2A & 2B show that colostrum was reactive to the RBD spike protein in

179

samples from 14 of 15 participants for IgA and IgG, and 6 of 15 for IgM. The colostrum from

180

only one COVID-19pos participant (P15), had no reactivity to the RBD spike protein. Of the 6

181

participants who provided both spot card and liquid colostrum samples (P01-P06), the overall

182

reactivities appear similar, but with a few differences. Reactivities for IgA, IgG and IgM were

183

higher in the first donation (spot card) than in the second donation (liquid) for P03 and P06,

184

while this pattern was reversed for P04 (Figure 2A).

185

There is a strong relationship between having experienced symptoms and time since first

186

positive test. Six participants (P02, P04, P05, P08, P10, and P11) had their first positive

187

diagnostic test within 1-3 days of delivery, and none reported any symptoms, whereas all of the

188

participants whose first diagnostic test was >25 days before delivery reported symptoms (Figure

189

S2). In contrast, neither the time since first positive test nor whether the participant experienced

190

symptoms were related to the antibody reactivity to RBD spike protein. Among women who

191

tested positive at the time of delivery, the highest reactivities occurred in P06 and P10, who had

8

192

their first positive test 30 days (symptomatic) and 1 day (asymptomatic), respectively, before

193

delivery (Figure S2). Among the 6 women who did not have a positive test at delivery (P03,

194

P09, P13 and P15 tested negative at delivery; P14 and P16 were not re-tested at delivery), all of

195

whom had symptoms, the highest reactivity to RBD occurred in P03 and P16, who had their first

196

positive test 42 and 144 days, respectively before delivery, while P15 had no reactivity and her

197

first positive test 98 days before delivery (Figure S2).

198

Bilateral colostrum from 2 of 8 pre-COVID-19 control participants (P23 and P24),

199

exhibited reactivities for IgA and IgG (Figure 2C). Colostrum from the left breast of pre-

200

COVID-19 control, P20, also exhibited reactivities for IgA and IgG, albeit low (Figure 2C).

201

Because we did not have a dilution factor associated with antibody extraction from the spot card,

202

the statistical comparison of antibody levels between the COVID-19pos and pre-COVID-19

203

controls was restricted to liquid samples.

204

The median IgA, IgG and IgM concentrations were 22.25 ng/mL versus 12.02 ng/mL;

205

8.47 ng/mL versus 4.50 ng/mL; and 93.89 ng/mL versus 30.27 ng/mL in colostrum obtained in

206

2020 and during 2011-2013 respectively (Figure S3). The greatest difference in antibody levels

207

between COVID-19 participants and pre-COVID-19 controls was for IgM (p<0.0001), which

208

showed a 3-fold higher concentration in the COVID-19pos samples.

209
210

Elevated inflammatory markers in colostrum from COVID-19pos participants.

211

Cytokines were measured in bilateral colostrum from COVID-19pos and pre-COVID-19

212

participants. Among the COVID-19pos participants, most analytes were detected in the majority

213

of samples, and this was true for cytokines measured in liquid milk as well as in spot card-eluates

214

(Table 2). In contrast, among the pre-COVID-19 controls, only one analyte, IL-8, was detected

215

in all samples (Table 2).

216

Cytokine concentrations were higher among COVID-19pos participants as compared to

217

pre-COVID-19 controls, and again this was the case for both liquid colostrum and spot card-

218

eluates (except for IFNg and IL-6, which were not higher in the spot card). However, the

219

concentration of cytokines was higher in the liquid colostrum than in the spot card-eluates for all

220

analytes (Table 2). Because we did not have a dilution factor associated with the spot card

221

extraction, statistical comparison between COVID-19pos and pre-COVID-19 samples was limited

222

to the liquid colostrum.

223

Among liquid samples, significantly elevated concentrations for 9 of 10 cytokines were

224

observed in the COVID-19pos group (2020) (Figure 3). Only IFNg was not significantly higher.

225

Moreover, there is an indication that cytokine levels in bilateral colostrum obtained from

226

symptomatic participants were higher (red-filled circles; Figure 3) compared to levels in

227

asymptomatic participants. This distinction was particularly clear for IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and

228

IL-12. Additionally, we explored the association between antibody response and cytokine levels

229

and found that SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA, IgG and IgM were negatively correlated to IL-13 in

230

spot card-eluates (Table 3). This pattern was not detected in liquid colostrum from pre-COVID-

231

19 controls (Table S2).

Principal findings
Our results provide a snapshot of the dynamic immune response in colostrum following

239

SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirming recent findings on the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific

240

antibodies in milk from infected women4,5, and describing for the first time, the associated

241

cytokine profile. Colostrum samples archived before the pandemic together with analysis of

242

bilateral samples provide important controls for this study, and the similarities between results

243

from the spot card and the liquid colostrum demonstrate the value of the spot card collection

244

method.

245

Spot card colostrum from all but one of the 15 participants exposed to SARS-CoV-2

246

exhibited IgA, IgG and IgM reactivities to RBD. The similarity in reactivity levels between the

247

two breasts provides confidence in the assay; comparable levels of immunoglobulins across

248

breasts are expected20 except when there are local infections. The range of IgA, IgG and IgM

249

reactivities to RBD is not easily explained by the time since onset of symptoms. The single

250

COVID-19pos participant whose colostrum had no antibody reactivity to RBD (P15) had onset of

251

symptoms 98 days before delivery, while one of the participants with high levels of IgA and IgG

252

reactivities to RBD (P16) had onset of symptoms 144 days before delivery (Figure S2).

253
254
255

Results in the context of what is known
The presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG in bilateral liquid colostrum of two

256

pre-COVID-19 controls, and the left breast of a third control (P20), could indicate a prior

257

infection that elicited a humoral response that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2-RBD. This

258

would be consistent with findings from Pace et al, who demonstrated that levels of SARS-CoV-

259

2-specific milk IgA and IgG correlated with IgA and IgG concentrations specific to the S-protein

of 229E coronavirus4. Alternatively, Isho et al also observed elevated saliva IgA and IgG

reactivities to SARS-CoV-2-RBD among their pre-COVID-19 controls, but did not attribute the

262

response to a prior coronavirus infection21. We were concerned that the reactivity in the left

breast of P20 could have been due to experimental error, however, a repeat analysis confirmed

264

the IgA and IgG reactivities.

265

Interestingly, IFNg is the only cytokine that was not elevated in the colostrum of COVID-

266

19pos participants. Many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have developed mechanisms to evade

267

the antiviral type-1 interferon pathway, leading to its reduced expression and moderate to low

268

expression of various interferon stimulated genes, including IFNg6,22–25. While there are some

269

conflicting reports, the lack of increased IFNg expression associated with COVID-19 is

270

consistent with our findings in colostrum and needs further investigation.

271

An inverse relationship between IL-10 and proinflammatory cytokines is normal and

272

expected, as IL-10 is upregulated in T-cells in response to inflammation and acts to reduce

273

inflammatory cytokines. However, in SARS-CoV-2 infections, there is evidence that cytokines

274

are not secreted by T-cells, but by recruited monocytes and macrophages, causing IL-10 to

275

remain elevated26–28. We show that both IL-10 and inflammatory cytokines are increased in

276

colostrum. A time-course study with serial milk collections and analysis of both cytokines and

277

immune cells would contribute greatly to our understanding of the inflammatory response to

278

SARS-CoV-2 infections.

279

Spot cards provide an efficient means of collecting colostrum. All 16 participants

280

consented to provide spot card followed by liquid colostrum. That the liquid sample was

281

collected from only 6 participants is likely due to the smaller volume requested for the spot card,

282

and greater ease for the staff, as the spot card can be left to dry at RT for several hours, while the

283

liquid colostrum needs to be quickly frozen.

284
285
286

Clinical Implications
The possible protection from SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies detected in colostrum has

287

clinical implications regarding the discussion about breast-feeding after exposure to the virus.

288

SARS-CoV-2-specific immune response was detected in the colostrum of women who had their

289

first positive test and symptoms more than four months before delivery, women who were

290

symptomatic at delivery, as well as asymptomatic women who had a first positive test at

291

delivery. The detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in these women with diverse

292

COVID-19 disease experiences provides objective data for the value of initiating breast-feeding

293

despite SARS-CoV-2 infection.

294
295
296

Research Implications
Given that the differences between the spot card and liquid samples for IgA, IgG and IgM

297

reactivities to RBD are not all unidirectional, we can assume that differences do not simply

298

reflect collection method. Indeed, the differences between spot card and liquid reactivities for

299

P04 could demonstrate antibody evolution in colostrum: i.e., a switch from high IgA to high IgM

300

(Figure 2A).

301

Cytokine concentrations are significantly higher in the liquid colostrum from COVID-

302

19pos as compared to pre-COVID-19 participants (Figure 3) suggesting a SARS-CoV-2-specific

303

response. However, there is concern that cytokines could be degraded in archived samples. An

304

argument against sample degradation is the high levels of IFNg for two of the pre-COVID-19

305

controls.

306

Calculated concentrations of cytokines differed between the spot card-eluates and liquid

307

colostrum among the five COVID-19pos participants who provided both sample types, with the

308

levels being generally higher in the liquid samples (Figure S4). Four participants show an

309

increase in the liquid samples, and one participant shows a decrease. Differences could reflect

310

rapid changes in levels over days. Use of the spot card with serial collections and direct

311

comparisons between liquid and spot card samples are needed in future work.

312
313

Conclusion

314

Our study is among the first to demonstrate the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in

315

colostrum and describes for the first time elevated cytokines in colostrum from women exposed

316

to SARS-CoV-2. The evolution and duration of the antibody response as well as dynamics of the

317

cytokine response remain to be determined. Given the feasibility of the collection method, and

318

the ability to detect antibodies and cytokines, our results indicate that future large-scale studies

319

can be conducted with milk easily collected on paper spot cards.

Figure 1. Overview of participants’ COVID-19 symptoms relative to their time of delivery.

435

Participant P01 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (indicated as not applicable: N/A). Participants

436

P02, P04, P05, P08, P10, and P11 reported no COVID-19-related symptoms (indicated as no

437

symptoms: NS) despite positive PCR tests.

Figure 2. Distinct reactivities for IgA, IgG and IgM in colostrum from COVID-19-infected

440

and pre-COVID-19 control participants. (A) Mean OD values for IgA, IgG and IgM in

441

colostrum from six participants who provided both bilateral colostrum on spot cards (filled bars,

442

donation 1) and bilateral liquid colostrum (open bars, donation 2). (B) Mean OD values for IgA,

443

IgG and IgM in colostrum obtained from the remaining 10 participants who provided bilateral

444

colostrum on spot cards only. (C) Mean OD values for IgA, IgG and IgM in bilateral liquid

445

colostrum obtained from 8 pre-COVID-19 control participants. For A and B, all spot card

446

samples were collected within 48 hours postpartum and all liquid colostrum was collected 1-2

447

days after the spot card collection. For C, all liquid samples were collected 1-3 days postpartum.

448

Dotted lines indicate cut-off value set at twice the mean OD of secondary-only antibody

449

reactivity across all plates. OD values for all samples are the means of technical duplicates.

participants. Concentrations of cytokines in liquid colostrum from the five COVID-19

453

participants, the 2020 COVID-19-negative participant (x), and the pre-COVID-19 pandemic

454

controls ( ) were measured with MSD technology. The plots show the median concentration of
