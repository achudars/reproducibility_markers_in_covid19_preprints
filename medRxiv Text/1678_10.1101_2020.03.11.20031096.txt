Abstract:
The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading around the
world rapidly and declared as a pandemic by WHO. Here, we compared the ABO
blood group distribution in 2,173 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by
SARS-CoV-2 test from three hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China with that in
normal people from the corresponding regions. The results showed that blood group A
was associated with a higher risk for acquiring COVID-19 compared with non-A
blood groups, whereas blood group O was associated with a lower risk for the
infection compared with non-O blood groups. This is the first observation of an
association between the ABO blood type and COVID-19. It should be emphasized,
however, that this is an early study with limitations. It would be premature to use this
study to guide clinical practice at this time, but it should encourage further
investigation of the relationship between the ABO blood group and the COVID-19
susceptibility.

INTRODUCTION
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causing the new infectious coronavirus
disease-2019 (COVID-19), is currently spreading rapidly around the world; it has
been recently declared as a pandemic by WHO. Recent clinical observation suggests
that patient age, male sex and certain chronic medical conditions (e.g., cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, COPD) seem to represent a risk for the infection of SARS-Cov-2
and higher disease severity1. There is currently no biological marker known to predict
the susceptibility to COVID-19. Landsteiner’s ABO blood types are carbohydrate
epitopes that are present on the surface of human cells. The antigenic determinants of
A and B blood groups are trisaccharide moieties GalNAcα1-3-(Fucα1,2)-Galβ- and
Galα1-3-(Fucα1,2)-Galβ-, while O blood group antigen is Fucα1,2-Galβ-. While
blood types are genetically inherited, the environment factors can potentially
influence which blood types in a population will be passed on more frequently to the
next generation. Susceptibility of viral infection has been previously found to be
related to ABO blood group. For example, Norwalk virus and Hepatitis B have clear
blood group susceptibility2,3. It was also reported that blood group O individuals were
less likely to become infected by SARS coronavirus4. Here, we investigated the
relationship between the ABO blood type and the susceptibility to COVID-19 in
patients from three hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China to test if the former may
be a biomarker for the latter.

We collected and ABO-typed blood samples from 1,775 patients infected with
SARS-CoV-2, including 206 dead cases, at the Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, Hubei
province, China. Another 113 and 285 patients with COVID-19 were respectively
recruited from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Hubei province and Shenzhen
Third People's Hospital, Guangdong province, China. The diagnosis of COVID-19
was confirmed by a positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction
test of SARS-CoV-2 on nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens from patients. Two
recent surveys of ABO blood group distribution of 3,694 normal people from Wuhan
City and 23,386 normal people from Shenzhen City were used as comparison controls
for the Wuhan and Shenzhen patients with COVID-19, respectively5-6. Statistical
analyses were performed using chi-squared test. Data from different hospitals were
meta-analyzed using random effects models, with calculation of odds ratio (OR) and
95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
software (version 16.0) and STATA software (version 13).

RESULTS
The ABO blood group in 3,694 normal people in Wuhan displayed a percentage
distribution of 32.16%, 24.90%, 9.10% and 33.84% for A, B, AB and O, respectively,
while the 1,775 patients with COVID-19 from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital showed an
ABO distribution of 37.75%, 26.42%, 10.03% and 25.80% for A, B, AB and O,
respectively. The proportion of blood group A in patients with COVID-19 was
significantly higher than that in normal people, being 37.75% in the former vs 32.16%

in the later (P < 0.001). The proportion of blood group O in patients with COVID-19
was significantly lower than that in normal people, being 25.80% in the former vs
33.84% in the later (P < 0.001, Table 1). These results corresponded to a significantly
increased risk of blood group A for COVID-19 with an OR of 1.279 (95% CI
1.136~1.440) and decreased risk of blood group O for COVID-19 with an OR of
0.680 (95% CI 0.599~0.771, Table 1) in comparison with non-A groups and non-O
groups, respectively.
A similar distribution pattern of high-risk blood group A and low-risk blood
group O was also observed in the dead patients. Specifically, the proportions of blood
groups A, B, AB and O in the 206 dead patients were 41.26%, 24.27%, 9.22% and
25.24%, respectively.

Blood group A was associated with a higher risk of death

compared with non-A groups, with an OR of 1.482 (95% CI 1.113~1.972, P = 0.008,
Table 1). To the contrary, blood group O was associated with a lower risk of death
compared with non-O groups, with an OR of 0.660 (95% CI 0.479~0.911, P = 0.014,
Table 1).
We next examined 113 patients with COVID-19 from another hospital in Wuhan
City, the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, and found a similar risk distribution
trend of ABO blood groups for the infection. Specifically, compared with non-A
blood groups, blood group A displayed higher relative risk (OR=1.396; 95% CI
0.952~2.048) than those observed in patients from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital,
although the associations did not reach statistical significance likely due to the small
sample size. Compared with non-O groups, blood group O were significantly

associated with a lower risk of infection, with an OR of 0.644 (95% CI 0.418~0.993,
P = 0.045, Table 1).
The ABO blood group in 23,368 normal people in Shenzhen displayed a percentage
distribution of 28.77%, 25.14%, 7.32% and 38.77% for A, B, AB and O, respectively.
Analysis of 285 patients with COVID-19 from Shenzhen showed proportions of blood
groups A, B, AB and O to be 28.77%, 29.12%, 13.68% and 28.42%, respectively.
These results similarly showed a significantly lower risk of infection associated with
blood group O (OR, 0.627; 95% CI 0.484~0.812). These results also showed blood
group AB to have an increased risk of infection (OR, 2.008; 95% CI 1.427~2.824,
Table 1).
Figure 1 shows the estimates of ORs of the risk of ABO blood groups for
COVID-19 on the pooled data from the three hospitals by random effects models.
Again, the results showed that blood group A was associated with a significantly
higher risk for COVID-19 (OR, 1.21; 95% CI 1.02~1.43, P = 0.027) compared with
non-A blood groups, whereas blood group O was associated with a significantly lower
risk for the infection (OR, 0.67; 95% CI 0.60~0.75, P < 0.001) compared with non-O
blood groups. Compared with other ABO blood groups, AB blood group (OR, 1.48,
95% CI 0.97~2.24) and B blood group (OR, 1.09, 95% CI 0.98~1.22) seemed to have
a trend of higher risk for infection, but the association did not reach statistical
significance.
We next investigated whether patient age and sex might influence the ABO blood
group distribution among patients with COVID-19. We used the ABO blood group

distribution of 3,694 normal people in Wuhan area as control to compare with
different age and sex groups. When all patients from Jinyintan Hospital and Renmin
Hospital in Wuhan city were combined (1,888 patients in total) and grouped into three
age groups (<40, 41-59, >60 years old), the ABO blood group distribution was similar
among the three age groups (Table S1). The ABO blood group distribution was also
similar between male and female patients with COVID-19 (Table S1). These results
are consistent with the fact that the distribution of ABO blood groups is known to
have no sex and age predilections. For example, by analyzing the blood type of more
than ninety thousands normal people, it was found that the percentage of A, B, AB
and O blood types were essentially the same among different age groups and among
different sexes.7

DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that ABO blood groups displayed different association
risks for the infection with SARS-CoV-2 resulting in COVID-19. Specifically, blood
group A was associated with an increased risk whereas blood group O was associated
with a decreased risk, thus demonstrating that the ABO blood type is a biomarker for
differential susceptibility of COVID-19. These findings are consistent with similar
risk patterns of ABO blood groups for other coronavirus infection found in previous
studies. For example, Cheng et al. reported that the SARS-CoV infection
susceptibility in Hong Kong was differentiated by the ABO blood group systems4.
The authors found that compared with non-O blood group hospital staff, blood group

O hospital staff had a lower chance of getting infected. Patrice et al. found that anti-A
antibodies specifically inhibited the adhesion of SARS-CoV S protein-expressing
cells to ACE2-expressing cell lines7. Given the nucleic acid sequence similarity8 and
receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding similarity between
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-29-11, the lower susceptibility of blood group O and
higher susceptibility of blood group A for COVID-19 could be linked to the presence
of natural anti-blood group antibodies, particularly anti-A antibody, in the blood.
This speculation will need direct studies to prove. There may also be other
mechanisms underlying the ABO blood group-differentiated susceptibility for
COVID-19 that require further studies to elucidate.

Limitations
This study has several limitations. 1) The numbers of patients from the Renmin
Hospital of Wuhan University and Shenzhen Third People's Hospital were both small.
Therefore, they cannot represent a solid replication analysis, although the data from
these two hospitals showed similar risk patterns of ABO blood groups. 2) The control
population groups used in this study lacked information on the subject age and sex
and, therefore, a multivariate analysis to adjust the effect of the two factors was not
possible.

This, however, may not necessarily be a major issue since the ABO blood

group distribution was similar among different age and sex groups of patients in the
present study and in normal population reported previously7. 3) Due to incomplete
information, the influence of the status of chronic medical conditions, such as

vascular disease, diabetes mellitus and COPD, could not be adjusted through a
multivariate analysis, which could potentially bias the conclusions of the present
study since these factors may affect the severity of COVID-19.

Conclusions
In this novel study, we for the first time report an association between the ABO
blood group and COVID-19 susceptibility, demonstrating the latter to be a biomarker
differentiating the former. Specifically, people with blood group A have a higher risk
whereas people with blood group O have a lower risk for SARS-Cov-2 infection and
COVID-19 severity. If verified by future studies, the findings in the present study
would have several potential clinical implications. 1) People with blood group A
might need particularly strengthened personal protection to reduce the chance of
infection; 2) SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with blood group A might need to receive
more vigilant surveillance and aggressive treatment; 3) It might be helpful to
introduce ABO blood typing in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection and
COVID-19.
It should be emphasized, however, that given the above limitations, it would be
premature to use this study to guide clinical practice at this time. Large replication
studies with complete information should be encouraged to pursue and are needed to
verify the present findings. Obviously, people with any blood type all need to exercise
the wisdom of careful practice to avoid SARS-CoV-2 infection.
