Abstract
Most deaths from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection
occur in older subjects. We assessed age effects and clinical utility of serum SARS-CoV-2
immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and neutralizing antibodies and serum inflammatory
markers. Serum IgG, IgM, and neutralizing antibody levels were measured using chemiluminescence
assays from Diazyme (Poway, CA), while serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), C reactive protein (CRP), and
ferritin were measured with immunoassays obtained from Roche (Indianapolis, IN). In 79,005 subjects,
IgG and IgM levels were positive (≥1.0 arbitrary units [AU]/mL) in 5.29% and 3.25% of subjects,
respectively. In antibody positive subjects, median IgG levels were 3.93 AU/mL if <45 years of age,
10.18 AU/mL if 45-64 years of age, and 10.85 AU/mL if ≥65 years of age (p<0.0001). In SARS-CoV-2
RNA positive cases, family members and exposed subjects (n=1,111), antibody testing was found to be
valuable for case finding, and persistent IgM levels were associated with chronic symptoms. In nonhospitalized and hospitalized subjects assessed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (n=278), median IgG levels in
AU/mL were 0.05 in negative subjects (n=100), 14.83 in positive outpatients (n=129), and 30.61 in
positive hospitalized patients (n=49, p<0.0001). Neutralizing antibody levels correlated significantly with
IgG (r=0.875; p<0.0001). Two or more of the criteria of IL-6 ≥10 pg/mL, CRP ≥10 mg/L, and/or IgM
>1.0 AU/mL occurred in 97.7% of inpatients versus 1.8% of outpatients (>50-fold relative risk, C statistic
0.986, p<0.0001). Our data indicate that: 1) IgG levels are significantly higher in positive older subjects,
possibly to compensate for decreased cellular immunity with aging; 2) IgG levels are important for case
finding in family clusters; 3) IgG levels are significantly correlated with neutralizing antibody levels; 4)
persistently elevated IgM levels are associated with chronic disease; and 5) markedly elevated IL-6, hsCRP, and/or positive IgM accurately identify SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive subjects requiring
hospitalization.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
(SARS-CoV-2) infection, which has caused a world-wide pandemic. The diagnosis is made by SARSCoV-2 RNA detection in naso-pharyngeal (NP) swabs, oro-pharyngeal (OP) swabs, nasal swabs, or saliva
usually within five days of exposure [1-6]. Up to 50% of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients can remain
asymptomatic; however, such individuals can spread infections [7,8]. The average onset of symptoms
after infection is about 5 days (range 2-14 days). Antibody testing has been reported to be useful for
documenting exposure and potential immunity, as well as for case finding in family clusters and exposed
individuals [9-15]. Moreover, treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma rich
in antibodies may be useful in treating the disease [16-20].
In RNA positive subjects, IgM antibody levels are detectable within a median time of 5 days
(range 3-7 days) of symptom onset and generally disappear over time, while IgG and neutralizing
antibodies are detectable within a median time of 14 days (range 10-18 days) of symptom onset and
generally persist for many months [9-15, 21,22]. Similar results for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been
obtained with chemiluminescence and enzyme linked immunoassays [9-15]. Levels of IgG antibodies
have been shown to correlate with levels of neutralizing antibodies in serum with some assays, but not
with others [21,22]. Fingerstick antibody testing with some lateral flow devices may be unreliable
[22,23]. It has been reported by the Centers for Disease Control in the United States that about 80% of the
total deaths attributed to SARS-CoV-2 occur in subjects ≥65 years of age, while this group only accounts
for about 10% of the total cases [24]. Our goals in the current investigation were to assess 1) the effects of
age on serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibody levels, 2) the clinical utility of such assays in case
finding and symptom prediction, 3) the relationships of IgG and IgM antibody levels with neutralizing
antibody levels, and 4) the relationships of antibody levels and inflammatory markers in SARS-CoV-2
positive patients requiring hospitalization, as compared to those in positive patients not requiring
hospitalization, in order to develop a risk prediction model.

Methods
Human subjects
A total of 79,005 subjects (median age 49.0 [IQR 35.0-69.0] years; 58.9% female, 18.2% ≥65
years of age) had serum samples submitted to our laboratory for the measurement of serum IgG levels. A
subset of 62,048 subjects had samples submitted to our laboratory for the measurement of IgM levels.
These subjects were assessed by healthcare providers in offices, clinics, hospitals, and at one meat
packing plant (n=352). Samples were submitted to our laboratory between April 6th and September 1st,
2020. We report data from 39 states with more than 100 results. We also assessed data from samples
collected by a healthcare provider from employees at a local meat packing plant in Massachusetts
(n=217). In addition, we evaluated data on samples and information about clinical status submitted by
healthcare providers for 534 outpatients and selected inpatients (median age 46 years, 51.2% female)
from the Boston, Bronx, Manhattan, and northern New Jersey areas. For this latter research, subject data
were extracted from medical records without name or identification number and were analyzed as
anonymized data.
This type of research is exempted from requirement for human institutional review board (IRB)
approval as per exemption 4, as listed at https://grants.nih.gov/policy/ humansubjects.htm and at the open
education resource (OER) website for research involving human subjects. This exemption “involves the
collection or study of data or specimens if publicly available or recorded such that subjects cannot be
identified”. We had this designation and our research reviewed by the Advarra Institutional Review Board
(Columbia, MD). They determined that “had the request for exempt determination been submitted prior to
initiation of research activities, the research would have met the criteria for exemption from institutional
review board review under 45 CFR 46.104(d)” and, therefore, ruled that this research did not require IRB
approval. The anonymized data and material used for this analysis can be obtained by contacting the

We also measured serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM, and neutralizing antibodies and serum
interleukin-6 (IL-6), high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP), and ferritin in 100 SARS-CoV-2 RNA
negative control subjects, 129 SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive subjects not requiring hospitalization, and 49
SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive subjects requiring hospitalization (median age 48.9 years; 54.5% female;
85% Caucasian, 10 % Hispanic, and 7% African American). These subjects were enrolled in an IRBapproved protocol at Trinity Health of New England (Hartford, CT, USA); all subjects provided an
informed written consent.

SARS-CoV-2 viral detection
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in NP, OP, or nasal swabs was performed using reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction methods with Thermo-Fisher TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kits
(Waltham, MA). This assay targets a region in the N gene, a region in the spike glycoprotein or S gene,
and a region in the ORF1 gene for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in swab samples. Positive values are
those detected at a cycle threshold values of <37 cycles. Our modified version of this assay which has
received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was
performed as previously described [4]. Our assay was found to have 100% concordance in 100 positive
and 100 negative samples when compared with another RNA assay from Viracor (Lee’s Summit, MO) as
previously described [5].

SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM chemiluminescence assays
The assays used were the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and SARS-CoV-2 IgG chemiluminescence assays
obtained from Diazyme Laboratories (Poway, CA) as previously described [10,14,15]. The assays use 2
recombinant antigens (full-length SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and partial-length glycoprotein
spike protein). The prediluted sample, buffer and magnetic microbeads coated with SARS-CoV-2
recombinant antigens are thoroughly mixed and incubated, forming immune-complexes. The precipitate
is separated in a magnetic field and washed before N-(4-Aminobutyl)-N-ethyl-isoluminol labeled anti-

human IgM or IgG antibodies are added and incubated to form additional complexes. After a second
precipitation in a magnetic field and subsequent wash cycles, the Starter 1+2 is added to initiate a
chemiluminescent reaction. The light signal is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units
(RLUs), which are proportional to the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG present in the sample
and are converted to arbitrary units or AU/mL.
The SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test did not detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies, and the SARSCoV-2 IgM antibody test did not detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. For cross reactivity experiments, a
total of 143 clinical samples were tested with both antibody assays. These samples were confirmed positive
for antibodies for various viruses and bacteria: influenza virus type A, influenza virus type B, parainfluenza
virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, EBV NA IgG, EBV VCA IgM/IgG, Measles virus, CMV
IgM/IgG, Varicella zoster virus, Mycoplasma Pneumoniae IgM/IgG, Chlamydia pneumoniae IgM/IgG,
Candida albicans, ANA, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E. All 143 samples,
however, were negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM with DZ-Lite SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM CLIA kits. In
addition, these assays were found to have no cross reactivity with antibodies for non-SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus strains HKU1, NL63, OC43, or 229E.
Multiple serum samples with IgM concentrations ranging from 0.86-10.27 AU/mL and IgG
concentrations ranging from 8.04 – 67.92 AU/mL had 0.1 mg/mL of the S protein and 0.1 mg/mL of the
N protein added. After 10-minute incubations and remeasurements, mean IgM levels were reduced by
94.55% and mean IgG levels by 99.46%. These data confirmed that the antibodies measured in these
assays are directed against the S and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2.
The specificity of the IgG assay for identifying 852 SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative outpatients was
97.40% when using IgG only; when used in combination with the IgM, the specificity was 96.00%. In
200 SARS-CoV-2 negative hospitalized patients, the specificity for diagnosing negative patients was
97.5% for the IgG assay alone and 96.5% for both IgM and IgG. In SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive patients
(n=55), the sensitivity for detecting positive subjects for the IgG assay was 98.40% for those with
symptoms ≥15 days; together with IgM it was 98.20%.

Positive values for both chemiluminescence assays are ≥1.0 AU/mL, with linear and reproducible
reportable ranges of 1.0–10.0 AU/mL for IgM and of 0.20–100.00 AU/mL for IgG. Linearity studies
documented r2 values of 0.991 for both IgM and for IgG for actual values versus target values, with
within- and between-run coefficients of variation based on 20 analyses at 4 concentration levels of 4.00%
and 2.51% for IgM positive (≥1.0 AU/mL) control samples and 2.50% and 2.10% for IgG positive (≥1.0
AU/mL) control samples, respectively. Both these assays have received emergency use authorization
(EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Neutralizing antibody chemiluminescence assay
The SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody assay utilized was obtained from Diazyme Laboratories
(Poway, CA). This assay is a competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay based on the specific
interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and the human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (hACE2) on the surface of host cells. The assay has been
previously described [15]. In the absence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, hACE2 and RBD form
complexes that generate a high chemiluminescent signal (measured in relative light units, RLU). In the
presence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies originating from human serum or plasma, the
interaction between hACE2 and RBD is compromised; and the chemiluminescent signal is reduced in a
dose-dependent manner. The assay has been validated with a cell-based assay as previously described
[26]. The assay was documented to have no interfering substances and to be specific for SARS-CoV-2.
The assay showed excellent correlation with the cell-based SARS-CoV-2 Reporter Neutralizing Antibody
Assay. Serum samples (n=33) with neutralizing antibody values ≥2.60 AU/mL all showed >98.0%
inhibition of viral infection in cell-based assay validation studies. In our laboratory this assay was found
to have within- and between-run coefficients of variation of <4.0%, with a positive value being ≥1.0
AU/mL and a linear range up to 30 AU/mL. This assay has been submitted to FDA for EUA.

Serum hs-CRP and ferritin were measured using FDA-approved assays from Roche Diagnostics
(Indianapolis, IN) on a Roche c701 automated COBAS analyzer. The IL-6 immunoassay used was also
obtained from Roche Diagnostics and was run on a Roche c801 automated COBAS analyzer. This assay
has received FDA EUA for use in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n=49) who are at >4-fold increased
risk of needing a ventilator if their serum IL-6 values are >35 pg/mL versus patients with values <35
pg/mL. This information was provided in the Roche assay package insert. All assays had coefficients of
variation of 4.0%.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using R software, version 3.6 (R Foundation, Vienna,
Austria). Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages, while continuous variables
were expressed as median values with interquartile ranges (IQR, 25th–75th percentile values). The
statistical significance of differences between groups were assessed using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis
analysis. Spearman correlation analyses were performed to assess interrelations of biochemical variables.
Univariate and stepwise multivariate regression analyses were carried out to assess for the statistical
significance of associations.

Results
Antibody testing in a reference laboratory population
Table 1 shows the results of serum antibody testing at Boston Heart Diagnostics between April 6th
and September 1st, 2020 by state in which more than 100 results were reported. The highest IgG and IgM
positive rates were seen for Nebraska, but these were all meat packing plant employees. New York state
had a fairly low positive rate because most subjects were sampled as part of health screening. In contrast,
high IgG and IgM positive rates were observed in Pennsylvania from a program that screened newly
symptomatic patients.
Table 2 shows the results of testing 79,005 subjects for IgG and a subset of 62,048 subjects that
also had serum IgM levels measured. IgG and IgM levels were positive (≥1.0 AU/mL) in 5.29% and
3.25% of these subjects, respectively. In positive subjects, median IgG levels were 3.93 AU/mL if <45
years, 10.18 AU/mL if 45-64 years, and 10.85 AU/mL if ≥65 years (p<0.0001). Therefore, subjects in the
≥65-year age group and the 45-64-year group had more than two-fold higher median IgG levels than
subjects <45 years of age. These findings were true for both females and males. In addition, females in
the ≥65-year age group were significantly (p<0.0001) more likely to have positive IgM values than
females in the <45-year age group. In addition to age effects, we also noted that men in the 45-64-year
age group had significantly (p<0.001) higher IgG levels than their female counterparts.

Studies in meat processing plants
Of 352 subjects from a meat packing plant in Nebraska (Table 1), 19.0% had positive IgG values;
and 15.3% had positive IgM values. In a separate analysis by one of our healthcare providers of 217
employees at a local meat processing plant in Massachusetts tested with NP swabs, 24.0% were RNA
positive. When 41 of these 52 positive subjects were retested 2 weeks later, 73.2% still had positive NP
swabs, 70.7% had positive IgG values, 9.8% had positive IgM values, and 63.4% had been symptomatic.
Median IgG and IgM in all 41 subjects tested were 20.53 AU/mL and 0.54 AU/mL, respectively. As

shown in Figure 1A, there was a very large variability in IgG response (range <0.20-117.7 AU/mL). In
addition, there were 25 subjects that had prior RNA negative swab testing, but requested antibody testing
because of having significant symptoms and known exposure to subjects that had tested positive with
RNA testing. Of these, 64.0% had positive IgG levels and 28.0% had positive IgM values, with all
subjects in the latter group having persistent symptoms. Median IgG and IgM values in these positive
subjects were 24.73 AU/mL and 1.31 AU/mL, respectively. These data clearly document the benefits of
antibody testing for case finding in previously exposed subjects even with negative RNA tests.

Studies in healthcare provider’s office
Of 388 outpatients that had antibody testing in a healthcare provider’s office (MMG) in the
Riverdale area of the Bronx, NY, 17.5% had positive IgG values with or without positive IgM values,
while another 4.9% had borderline IgG values between 0.50-1.0 AU/mL. Of these latter subjects, 60.0%
had been or were symptomatic. Of 10 subjects in the borderline category, 3 were previously RNA positive
on swabs, and 6 had a history of definite exposure. This healthcare provider felt that IgG values between
0.50-1.0 AU/mL should be classified as borderline. His data justified this conclusion.

Antibody levels in individual family clusters and cases
Of 154 outpatients in Manhattan and New Jersey that had NP swabs and antibodies assessed,
85.8% were negative for any evidence of SARS-CoV-2. The remaining 14.2% (n=22) were positive and
of these subjects, 7 were carefully followed over time along with their family members, as well as 9
individual cases (total of 47 subjects). Many had the following symptoms: fever, chills, body aches,
inability to sleep, fatigue, dry cough, loss of smell and taste, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. Three cases
(all aged >80 years) had to be hospitalized, and two required being placed on ventilators, with one of
these latter patients dying. The data that we tabulated clearly indicated that 1) antibody testing was
valuable for finding additional cases in family studies (observed in all families); 2) patients can have

positive RNA results for up to 6 weeks (observed in 5 cases); and 3) patients with persistent symptoms
often have persistently elevated IgM levels (observed in 11 cases).

Antibody and inflammation biomarker levels in RNA positive
outpatients and inpatients
Data on serum IgG, IgM, and neutralizing antibody levels, as well as the inflammatory markers
IL-6, hsCRP, and ferritin, in 100 SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative control subjects, 129 SARS-CoV-2 RNA
positive outpatients, and 49 SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive inpatients are shown in Table 3. All control
subjects had negative antibody levels (<1.0 AU/mL). Median IgG levels were about 300-fold and 600fold higher in outpatients and inpatients as compared to controls (both p<0.0001). The wide variation in
IgG response in outpatients is shown in Figure 1B. IgG values ranged from 1.03-200.0 AU/mL in
outpatients and from 0.05-169.5 AU/mL in inpatients, similar to what we observed in positive meat
packing plant employees (Figure 1A). Median IgM levels were about 1.8-fold and 5-fold higher in
outpatients and inpatients as compared to controls (both p<0.0001). IgM values ranged from 1.09-13.58
AU/mL in outpatients and from 0.46-18.82 AU/mL in inpatients. Median neutralizing antibody levels
were about 12-fold and 24-fold higher in outpatients and inpatients as compared to controls (both
p<0.0001). Neutralizing antibody values ranged from 1.09-13.58 AU/mL in outpatients and from 0.3518.82 AU/mL in inpatients. Median IgG, IgM, and neutralizing antibody levels were all significantly
higher in positive patients than controls.
Median IL-6 levels were the same in controls and outpatients but were about 75-fold higher in
inpatients as compared to other groups (p<0.0001). IL-6 values ranged from 0.75-39.42 pg/mL in
controls, from 0.75-42.30 pg/mL in outpatients, and from 0.75-5500 pg/mL in inpatients. Median hs-CRP
levels were very similar in control subjects and outpatients but were about 80-fold higher in inpatients as
compared to other groups (p<0.0001). Hs-CRP values ranged from 0.06-63.10 mg/L in controls, from
0.15-73.10 mg/L in outpatients, and from 1.22-375.60 mg/L in inpatients. Similarly, median ferritin levels
were similar in controls and outpatients, but were about 9-fold higher in inpatients as compared to other

groups (p<0.0001). Ferritin values ranged from 9.0-1413.0 ng/mL in controls, from 14.0-786.4 ng/mL in
outpatients, and from 130.0-2653.0 ng/mL in inpatients (p<0.0001). Levels of inflammatory markers were
only significantly elevated in inpatients as compared to controls and outpatients. Using widely measured
hs-CRP values and a cut-point of ≥10 mg/L, 6.0% of negative control subjects, 5.6% of positive
outpatients, and 93.2% of positive inpatients had values above this threshold. Therefore, RNA positive
subjects with hs-CRP values ≥10 mg/L had a 16.6-fold higher risk (p<0.0001) of being hospitalized than
RNA positive subjects with hs-CRP values <10 mg/L.
Correlation matrix data for levels of antibodies and inflammation markers are shown in Table 4.
Neutralizing antibody levels correlated most significantly (p<0.0001) with IgG (r=0.875) and IgM
(r=0.654), while IL-6 values correlated most strongly with hs-CRP values (r=0.740, p<0.0001). We also
sought to develop a multi-parameter algorithm to distinguish RNA positive subjects who required
hospitalization from RNA positive subjects not requiring hospitalization. In multivariate stepwise
regression analysis for the prediction of need for hospitalization among RNA positive patients using cutpoint analysis, we noted the following odds ratios (5th-95th percentile confidence intervals; p values) for
IL-6 ≥10 pg/mL, hs-CRP ≥10 mg/L, and/or IgM ≥1.0 AU/mL: IL-6 85.72 (CI, 14.51-912.90; p=1.21 x 105

), hs-CRP 59.48 (CI 10.50-578-50; p= 3.15 x 10-5), and IgM 11.59 (CI 1.69-145.36; p=0.026), with

97.7% of positive subjects that met two or more of the prior criteria requiring hospitalization versus only
1.8% of those not requiring hospitalization (50-fold increased risk, C statistic 0.986, p<0.0001). Neither
ferritin, IgG, or neutralizing antibody values added significant risk prediction to this model after the first

Discussion
One of our goals in the current investigation was to assess the effects of age on serum SARSCoV-2 IgG and IgM antibody levels. In a large number of outpatients with potential SARS-CoV-2
exposure, about 5% had positive IgG values and about 3% had positive IgM values. We noted significant
age effects, with positive subjects ≥65 years and those between 45-64 years of age having median IgG
levels that were more than two-fold higher than their younger counterparts. We also noted a modest sex
effect with men in the 45-64-year age group having significantly higher IgG levels than their female
counterparts. It has been reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that serum
SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were positive in 1.0-6.5% of 16,025 subjects in various parts of the United
States, suggesting that infection rates were 6-24 times higher than reported at that time [26]. These
percentages are similar to our data. Based on CDC data, over 95% of deaths from COVID occur in the
>45-year age group, even though about 70% of the cases occur in those <45 years of age. The ≥65 years
of age category accounts for ~10% of all SARS-CoV-2 cases and ~80% of SARS-CoV-2 mortality [24].
Possibly older subjects with positive antibody levels mount a greater IgG response in order to compensate
for the decreased overall cellular immunity found in the elderly as compared to the young [28,29].
A second goal of our studies was to assess the clinical utility of antibody assays in case finding.
We documented that antibody testing was valuable to identify cases and to ascertain potential exposure
and level of immunity. The latter findings are relevant in the identification of potential convalescent
plasma donors to assure sufficient IgG antibody levels. We have noted a high degree of variability in IgG
antibody response in RNA positive patients. Laboratories that only report a positive or negative value do
not detect this large variability. Moreover, only about 50% of RNA positive outpatients had IgG levels
>6.5 AU/mL, sufficient to provide estimated antibody titers of >1:320 as per FDA guidance, and only
about one-third had plasma IgG levels >20 AU/mL, sufficient to provide estimated antibody titers
>1:1000 [16-20].

In our individual and cluster studies, we have noted that antibody testing allows for the
identification of exposed individuals, especially in those that were negative based on NP swab testing,
usually ≥4 weeks following infection. Most of these family cluster and individual cases studies were
carried by one of the co-authors (FC). She justifiably emphasized the value of both RNA and antibody
testing in her practice. Her data clearly documented the benefits of semi-quantitative IgG and IgM testing
for case finding in family clusters and exposed subjects who were RNA negative. Her data also indicated
that RNA swabs can remain positive for up to 6 weeks, even though such patients may no longer be able
to infect other people [30,31]. In her cluster and case data, we also clearly observed that long-term
elevated IgM levels were often associated with persistent illness and symptoms. At the present time, very
few healthcare providers are measuring COVID-19 antibody levels; instead, there has been a frenzy of
nasal swab RNA testing [25]. Unfortunately, such testing in the United States has often been
accompanied by a lack of public health measures as well as contact tracing to combat the spread of
COVID-19. In our view antibody testing provides an excellent measure of prior exposure and potential
immunity that has been greatly under-utilized in the United States [32].
A third goal of our studies was to investigate the relationships of neutralizing antibody levels with
IgG and IgM antibody levels. We noted that both IgG and IgM were significantly correlated with
neutralizing antibodies, but this relationship was strongest with IgG, consistent with prior reports [21]. A
great advantage of the serum or plasma neutralizing assay we used in our studies was its ease of use on
high through-put automated instruments and its reproducibility. Moreover, the results of this assay were
found to be very highly correlated with results obtained using a cell-based assay [26]. The utility of
antibody testing after vaccination has not been assessed.
A fourth goal of our studies was to examine the relationships of antibody levels and inflammatory
markers in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients requiring hospitalization as compared to such subjects not
requiring hospitalization in order to potentially develop a risk algorithm. The highest median IgG, IgM,
and neutralizing antibody levels that we observed were noted in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. As we
have previously noted there was a high degree of variability in IgG response (Figure 1). In our

multivariate analysis, three parameters allowed for the prediction of the need for hospitalization in RNA
positive patients: IL-6 ≥10.0 pg/mL, hs-CRP ≥10 mg/L, and/or IgM ≥1.0 AU/mL. IL-6 and hs-CRP have
been part of so called “cytokine storm” associated with an exaggerated immune response with markedly
elevated blood levels of white blood cells, CRP, IL-6, and ferritin associated with a high COVID-19
mortality [33,34]. In a meta-analysis, IL-6 levels were reported to be >12-fold elevated in COVID-19
related respiratory distress [35]. Moreover, serum levels of IL-6 >80 pg/mL and hs-CRP >97 mg/L have
been reported to identify correctly 80% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring a ventilator with
AUC values of 0.90 and 0.97, respectively [36]. In our data set, having hs-CRP value >10 mg/L increased
hospitalization risk 16-fold rate in positive subjects. However, having two or more of the criteria of a
positive IL-6 ≥10 pg/mL, hs-CRP ≥10 mg/L, and an IgM ≥1.0 AU/mL increased the hospitalization risk
>50-fold in COVID positive patients with an AUC value of 0.98. Therefore, using these serum markers,
one can very accurately predict need for hospitalization among SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive patients.

Conclusions
Our data are consistent with the following conclusions: 1) SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels are
significantly higher in positive older subjects than in younger positive subjects possibly to compensate for
the decreased cellular immunity observed in older people; 2) elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels
measurements are useful in identifying cases in exposed subjects and family clusters, 3) elevated SARSCoV-2 IgM levels are often associated with persistent COVID-19 symptoms and disease; 4) serum
SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels are significantly correlated with neutralizing antibody levels; and 5)
having two or more of the following laboratory abnormalities IL-6 ≥10 pg/mL, hs-CRP ≥10.0 mg/L,
and/or IgM ≥1.0 AU/mL very accurately predicts the need for hospitalization in COVID-19 positive
patients.

*A total of 79,005 subjects, median age 45.0 years (IQR 30-55), 58.31 % female, had IgG values measured. A subset of 62,048 subjects (median age 45.0 years [IQR 31-54]; 58.53%
female) had IgM values measured. Of these subjects, 89.42% had an IgG value <0.20 AU/mL; 3.53% had an IgG value 0.20-<0.50 AU/mL; 1.76% had an IgG value 0.50-<1.0 AU/mL;

25

3.75% had an IgG value 1.0-20.0 AU/mL; and 1.54% had an IgG value >20.0 AU/mL. For IgM, 96.75% had a value <1.0 AU/mL; 3.19% had a value of 1.0-10.0 AU/mL; and 0.06% had
a value >10.0 AU/mL.
†

Males of all ages had IgG and IgM values that were significantly higher than their female counterparts (P<0.01), especially in the 45-64 year old age group. The Spearman correlation

coefficient between IgG and IgM for all subjects with values >1.0 AU/mL was r = 0.433 (P<0.001).
‡

P<0.0001 for age comparisons to <45-year age group. The percentage values represent a comparison between the age ≥65-year group and the <45-year age group.

P value for trend across the 3 subject groups.

In multivariate stepwise regression analysis for the prediction of need for hospitalization among RNA positive patients using cut-point analysis, we noted the
following odds ratios, 5th-95th percentile confidence intervals and p values for IL-6 >10 pg/mL, hs-CRP >10 mg/L, and positive IgM: IL-6 (85.72, 14.51-912.90,
p=1.21 x 10-5), hs-CRP (59.48, 10.50-578-50, p= 3.15 x 10-5), and IgM (11.59, 1.69-145.36, p=0.026), with 97.7% of positive subjects that met two or more of
the prior criteria requiring hospitalization versus only 1.8% of those not requiring hospitalization (50-fold increased risk, C statistic 0.986, p<0.0001).
AU, arbitrary units; hs-CRP, high sensitivity C reactive protein.
