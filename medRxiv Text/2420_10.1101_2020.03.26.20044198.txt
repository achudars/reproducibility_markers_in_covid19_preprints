Abstract
Purpose: The aim of the present study was to assess whether
SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the expressed prostatic secretion
(EPS) of patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Methods: 18 cases of COVID-19, and 5 suspected cases, were
selected from three medical centers to detect the RNA expression
of SARS-CoV-2 in their EPS with RT-PCR.
Results:

Conclusions: No SARS-CoV-2 was expressed in EPS of patients
with COVID-19.

Introduction
Since the first outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan city, December
2019, about 78,000 people have been infected in China. The
causative agent of this disease, now called SARS-CoV-2, can
cause acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the risk of death is
relatively high 1 . The patients who were asymptomatic infected by
SARS-CoV-2, constitute the main source of infection. The main
routes of transmission are respiratory droplets and close contact 2 .

In addition to secreta of respiratory tract, the researchers had
isolated

the

virus

in

the

urine 3 ,

feces 4

and

conjunctiva 5 of patients. It suggested that the virus may had
multiple transmission routes. Based on the above studies, we
propose the hypothesis that prostate may be a target organ of
SARS-CoV-2, and that the RNA of virus expresses in the EPS of
confirmed and suspected patients alike.
Methods
Study design and patients
From February 25 to March 13, 2020, 18 confirmed cases and 5
suspected cases of COVID-19 were selected from three medical
centers to detect the RNA of virus expression in their EPS (Table
1). The confirmed cases in this study were SARS-CoV-2 positive in
throat swabs; the suspected cases, while showing symptoms like
fever and cough, were SARS-CoV-2 negative in the throat swabs
twice with an interval of at least 24 hours. Cases of COVID-19
were diagnosed based on the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19
(trial version 7) published by the National Health Commission of
China. The three medical centers, Shenzhen Hospital of Southern
Medical University, Wuhan Third Hospital (Hospital-Tongren) of
Wuhan University and Xiangyang Central Hospital, are all

COVID-19. The prevalence ranks from low to high in these three
areas.

Data collection
All the samples were collected by trained medical professionals

guidelines 6 at the three centers. The EPS swab was saved in the
virus sampling kit (Bangshuo, Guangzhou, China) immediately,

recommended protocol.
Statistical analysis

Results
All 23 EPS samples of suspected and confirmed patients tested

DISCUSSION
The pathogen that causes the COVID-19 has been identified as a
novel enveloped RNA beta corona virus 2 7 . As a phylogenetic
similar to SARS-CoV, it has currently been named severe acute
respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Human
beings has no immunity to the virus and is susceptible. The
incubation period lasts usually 1 to 14 days. Fever and cough are
the dominant symptoms，mostly occur at 3 to 7 days after infection.
Gastrointestinal and urological symptoms are rare. A few patients
are accompanied by symptoms such as nasal obstruction, runny
nose, sore throat, myalgia and diarrhea. Severe patients often have
dyspnea and hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease,
then rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic
shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction and multiple
organ dysfunction syndrome 2 .

Conventional routes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 consist of
respiratory droplets and direct contact. It is possible to propagate
through aerosols when exposed to high concentration aerosols for a
long time
China-WHO

in a relatively closed
investigation

on

environment 4 . From the

COVID-19,

it

reported

that

SARS-CoV-2 was an animal virus, and that air transmission was
not considered as the main mode. it indicated that the interpersonal
transmission mainly occurred within households in China. So far
SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the gastrointestinal tract, saliva,
and urine, so these routes of potential transmission need to be
investigated.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 shares 76% amino acid
sequence identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona
virus (SARS-CoV) and is likely to use the same receptor,
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entry into target host
cells 8,9 ， The binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 with its receptor is
more 10 to 20 times higher than ones of else corona virus, like
SARSr-CoV and MERSr-CoV 10 . Investigation of the expression
pattern of ACE2 in adult human testis at the level of single-cell
transcriptomes indicates that ACE2 is predominantly enriched in
spermatogonia, leydig and sertoli cells. Further research shows
that enrichment of ACE2 in leydig and sertoli cells has a

significant higher frequency compared with ACE2-expressing cells
in type II alveolar epithelial cells (AT2) in human lung (4.25% vs
1.40%) 8 . These evidences suggested that the human testis was a
high-risk organ vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection that may
result in spermatogenic failure 11 .
ACE2 receptor is also expressed in human kidney. Recently,
Academician Zhong Nanshan's team isolated SARS-CoV-2 from
urine samples of a patient with COVID-19. A latest study has
showed that ACE2 was not only highly expressed in lung AT2 cells
but also in absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon, has
indicated that digestive system was a potential route for
SARS-CoV-2 infection 12 . It may be a reason by fecal-oral
transmission. It has reported that the result of anus swab of
SARS-CoV-2 turned positive again in a few of discharged patients
during the follow-up 13 . These patients need to be closely monitored
for infectivity.
All above evidences show that the respiratory system, digestive
system and urogenital system are all the target organs of
SARS-CoV-2 14,15 . It is inferred that the testis and prostate of
patients with COVID-19 are also vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, so
we collect the EPS of confirmed and suspected patients to test.
According to our results, there is no any affirmative evidence of

the virus expressed in EPS samples, which might indicate that
prostate may be not a target organ of SARS-CoV-2, and the virus
will not appear in the EPS regardless of the throat swab results.
However, some limitations should be noted. First, although those
samples were collected from three medical centers with different
prevalence rates, EPS were tested only in mild and common
patients, excluding samples of severe patients. Second, semen
samples were not obtained, due to some restrictions like
non-private ward environment of mobile cabin hospitals, anxiety
during isolation period, so the safety of sexual intercourse still
remains to be known. Third, our sample size is relatively small,
with only 60 cases. In the next study, large samples and long-term
follow-up are needed to assess whether sexual intercourse is a
potential route for virus transmission.
