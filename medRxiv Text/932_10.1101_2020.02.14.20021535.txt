ABSTRACT
Background: A novel pneumonia associated with the 2019 coronavirus infected pneumonia
(NCIP) suddenly broke out in Wuhan, China in December 2019. 37287 confirmed cases and
813 death case in China (Until 8th/Feb/2019) have been reported in just fortnight. Although
this risky pneumonia with high infection rates and high mortality rates need to be resolved
immediately, major gaps in our knowledge of clinical characters of it were still not be
established. The aim of this study is to summaries and analysis the clinical characteristics of
2019-nCoV pneumonia.
Methods: Literatures have been systematically performed a search on PubMed, Embase, Web
of Science, GreyNet International, and The Cochrane Library from inception up to February 8,
2020. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess quality, and publication bias was
analyzed by Egger’s test. In the single-arm meta-analysis, A fix-effects model was used to
obtain a pooled incidence rate. We conducted subgroup analysis according to geographic
region and research scale.
Results: A total of nine studies including 356 patients were included in this study, the mean
age was 52.4 years and 221 (62.1%) were male. The pooled incidences rate of symptoms as
follows: pharyngalgia (12.2%, 95% CI: 0.087-0.167), diarrhea (9.2%, 95% CI: 0.062-0.133)
and headache (8.9%, 95% CI: 0.063-0.125). Meanwhile, 5.7% (95% CI: 0.027-0.114) of
patients were found without any symptoms although they were diagnosed by RT-PCR. In the
terms of CT imaging examination, the most of patients showed bilateral mottling or
ground-glass opacity, 8.6% (95% CI: 0.048-0.148) of patients with crazy-paving pattern, and

11.5% (95% CI: 0.064-0.197) of patients without obvious CT imaging presentations. The
pooled incidence of mortality was 8.9% (95% CI: 0.062-0.126).
Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first evidence-based medicine research to further
elaborate the clinical characteristics of NCIP, which is beneficial to the next step of
prevention and treatment.
INTRODUCTION
Since Dec 8, 2019, several cases of unknown pneumonia have been reported in Wuhan, Hubei
province, China. On January 3, 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus was identified in samples of
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient in Wuhan and was confirmed as the cause of the
NCIP1. This coronavirus (CoV) was named ‘‘2019 novel coronavirus’’ or ‘‘2019-nCoV’’ by
the World Health Organization (WHO)2. Six kinds of human coronaviruses have been
previously identified3 These include HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, which belong to the
.

Alphacoronavirus genus; and HCoV-OC43, HCoVHKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV),
which belong to the Betacoronavirus genus4 Furthermore, coronaviruses have become
.

associated with deadly respiratory infections in humans following the emergence of
SARS-CoV in Guangdong, China during 2002, which affected 8098 people in 37 countries5.
There then followed the MERS-CoV outbreak6. Early in the 2019n-CoV outbreak, it has
become clear that the virus can be transmitted from human-to-human7. A total of 28129 NCIP
cases in the world have been confirmed, including 12 patients in the United States. According
to the government report by the mayor of Wuhan, at a press conference on 26th January 2020,
approximately five million residents left Wuhan for other provinces within China and
thousands of people left Wuhan for other countries before the lockdown7. Therefore, all over
the world will meet this public health issues probably.
Until 8th/Feb/2019, ,76 literatures have been reported regarding the epidemiology and clinical
features of pneumonia caused by 2019¬nCoV. After we reviewed all these literature research
by the clinical studies, various clinical symptoms have been proposed as the typical features
for the 2019nCoV, furthermore, some features are controversial in different clinic
environments. Therefore, evidence-based medical clinical characters are required urgently. In
this study, we did a systemic review and a single meta-analysis of the clinical features of

2019nCoV pneumonia.
METHODS
This review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses8.
Keywords and study eligibility criteria were determined. The protocol for the review was
registered with PROSPERO (Provisional registration number: 168532)
Search Strategy
PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, GreyNet International (http://www.greynet.org/), and The
Cochrane Library were searched for articles published until February 6 2020. Articles on
2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia, such as 2019nCoV, NCIP, and Wuhan pneumonia were
also manually retrieved. To maximize search sensitivity, no filters or limits on language were
applied (the retrieval process is shown in Figure 1).
Selection Criteria
The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies reporting information regarding NCIP; (2)
those that were clinical studies or consecutive cases; (3) availability of clinical data can be
drawn from the articles; (4) containing more than three cases. The exclusion criteria were as
follows: (1) repeat articles, letters, editorials, and expert opinions; (2) studies without usable
data; and (3) the articles published in languages other than English and Chinese.
Data extraction
Two investigators (K.Q & Y.D) independently extracted data from eligible studies;
disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third investigator. For each study, the
following information was recorded: necessary information (e.g., first author, year of
publication), research characteristics (e.g., RCT, case report, retrospective study, course of
treatment), and study subject characteristics (e.g., gender, age, CT imagines, symptoms,
therapies, and the incidence of complications).
Quality control
The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess quality9. Assessment scores of 0-3, 4-6, and
7-9 indicated poor, fair, and good studies, respectively. Discrepancies were resolved by
consensus.
Publication bias

Since approximate ten studies were included in each approach group, funnel plots were used
to detect publication bias. Publication bias was analyzed using Egger’s linear regression test,
which measures funnel plot asymmetry.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-analysis (Version 2). The
results are expressed as incidences and 95% CIs. A random-effects model was used to
perform the statistical analyses, and a chi-squared test and I2 statistic were used to assess the
inter-study heterogeneity. I2>50% indicated that heterogeneity was not statistically
significant10. In order to further explore the sources of heterogeneity and examine whether the
results differed by study characteristics, subgroup analysis was performed according to

＜

geographic region (Wuhan area and outside Wuhan area), research scale ( 50 cases and

≥50

cases)10.
RESULTS
Literature Search
We initially retrieved 145 articles of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia, 9 of which met the
criteria for inclusion in our series. Reasons for exclusion included duplicate reports (n = 58),
without clinical characteristics (n = 42), and other types of studies such as comments and
letters to the editor (n = 36) (Figure 1).
Study Characteristics
The methodological quality of the retained studies was high for observational studies (overall
satisfactory quality of evidence; table 1). Among eligible literatures, three studies included
individual patient data of 15 patients (table 2). Another six articles included 341 patients,
however, there were no individual patient data. Among all of these studies, seven studies
(90%) were from the Wuhan area; two studies which included one patient was from the
outside of the Wuhan area. Study size ranged from 3 to 138 subjects, seven studies involving
less than 50 cases and two studies involving more than 50 cases.
Clinical symptom
There were 10 symptoms of NCIP which were reported. The pooled incidence rate was
calculated for four symptoms: rhinorrhea (4.1%, 95% CI: 0.021-0.077), diarrhea (9.2%, 95%

CI: 0.062-0.133), pharyngalgia (12.2%, 95% CI: 0.087-0.167), and headache (8.9%, 95% CI:
0.063-0.125). Interestingly, four patients were found without any symptoms although they
were diagnosed by RT-PCR11. The pooled incidence rate of no obvious symptoms patients
was 5.7% (95% CI: 0.027-0.114) for all studies. There was no significant heterogeneity
(I2=47.67%, P=0.054) (Table 3). There was also no indication of publication bias as suggested
by Egger’s test (P = 0.12). Among been reported clinical symptoms, evidence of
heterogeneity was present in the symptoms of fever (I2 = 78.39%, P = 0.000), cough (I2 =
64.76%, P = 0.004) expectoration (I2 = 83.23%, P = 0.000) anhelation (I2 = 69.21%, P = 0.001),
muscle pain (I2 = 74.9%, P = 0.000) and fatigue (I2 = 90.8%, P = 0.000). We found no

identifiable sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analysis. The results of subgroup
analyses according to geographic region and study scale are presented in Table 4.
WBC
White blood cells were below the normal range in 39 patients (the pooled incidence rate was
12.4%, I2=33.97, P=0.146) and above the normal range in 71 patients (the pooled incidence
rate was 20.7%, I2=0.000, P=0.466) (table 3). Lymphocytes were below the normal range in
133 patients, the pooled incidence of increasing neutrophils was 37.7% (95% CI: 0.325-0.431)
(Table 3). 93 patients had neutrophils above the normal range, evidence of heterogeneity and
publication bias was present in it (I2 = 83.47%, P = 0.01, egger’s test P=0.012). We found no
identifiable sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analysis (Table 4).
CT imaging
The CT imagines of NCIP patients were reported differently. By reviewing the literature,
there are three common manifestations as follows: (1) bilateral mottling or ground-glass
opacity, (2) unilateral mottling or ground-glass opacity, (3) crazy-paving pattern. Among these
studies. 307 patients showed bilateral mottling or ground-glass opacity, 40 patients showed
bilateral mottling or ground-glass opacity, and 9 patients with crazy-paving pattern (8.6%, 95%
CI: 0.048-0.148). Additionally, Chen et. al. reported that pneumothorax occurred in one
patient12. Evidence of heterogeneity was present in the bilateral mottling or ground-glass
opacity (I2 = 66.88%, P = 0.002), and unilateral mottling or ground-glass opacity (I2 = 71.1%, P

= 0.001). We found no identifiable sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analysis;
Furthermore, there were nine patients with normal CT presentations during the period of
6

NCIP. The pooled incidence rate of this normal CT imagint was 11.5% (95% CI: 0.064-0.197),
significant heterogeneity was presented (I2 = 67.16 %, P = 0.002). In subgroup analysis,
heterogeneity was decreased, indicated that the heterogeneity may come from the geographic
region (I2 = 14.62%, P = 0.279) and study scale (I2 = 47.05%, P = 0.079) (Table 4, Figure
2,3).
Oxygen therapy
Nearly all the patients accepted oxygen therapy. Among these studies, there were 268 patients
who used nasal cannula for 2-25 days, the pooled incidence was 74.4% (95% CI: 0.696-0.788)
for all studies. 22.8% (95% CI: 0.186-0.275) patients used mechanical ventilation to assist
ventilation, the inhaled oxygen concentration was 35-100%. Moreover, 12 patients were
treated with extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the pooled incidence was 4.6%
(95% CI: 0.027-0.077). (Table 2). There was no evidence of heterogeneity and publication
bias. The results of subgroup analysis according to geographic region and study scale are
presented in Table 3.
Clinical outcomes
Unfortunately, 26 died cases were reported, the pooled incidence of mortality was 78.1% (95%
CI: 0.062-0.126), there was no significant heterogeneity (I2=39.64%, P=0.569). Since the
course of treatment of NCIP is about three weeks until some articles published, some patients
still accepted therapy in the hospital, the statistics on mortality may be inaccurate (Table 2).
There was significant heterogeneity in the ARDS group (I2 = 60.76%, P = 0.01). We found no
identifiable sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analysis (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
In our research, the number of male patients more than female patients (62.1% vs 37.9%).
This result is consistent with the gender distribution of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV13,14.
Meanwhile, Chen et.al also showed 2019-nCoV infection is more likely to affect males12. The
reduced susceptibility of females to viral infections could be attributed to the protection from
X chromosome and s sex-specific effects in infectious disease susceptibility15. On the contrary,
a recent report that showed there was no difference in the proportion of men and women
between ICU patients and non-ICU patients16. Although the mechanism of this difference
cannot be explained at present, male patients should be paid more attention.

A recent study showed that nCoV was detected in stool samples of patients with abdominal
symptoms

17.

In our research, the pooled incidences rate of diarrhea was 7.8%, this results

lower than the reported results of about 20-25% of patients with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV
infection18. Although the cause of this phenomenon is unclear, it suggests that we need to pay
attention to patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and contact isolation should be taken. In
addition,
Four patients (5.7%) who with obvious symptoms were diagnosed by RT-PCR. Such patients
will become a challenge in the future epidemic prevention process, which requires us to have
detailed screening strategies, and we should be more vigilant in patients without obvious
symptoms.
In terms of laboratory tests, the pooled incidence rate of lymphocytes reduce was 47.9%. On
the other hand, the pooled incidence rate of increasing Neutrophils was 44.6%. These
abnormalities are similar to those previously observed in patients with MERS-CoV and
SARS-CoV infection19. These conclusions further confirm that lymphopenia along with
neutrophilia was a feature of SARS-Cov, and 2019-nCoV might mainly act on lymphocytes,
especially T lymphocytes20. Virus particles spread through the respiratory mucosa and infect
other cells, induce a cytokine storm in the body, generate a series of immune responses, and
cause changes in peripheral white blood cells and immune cells such as lymphocytes12. In
addition, lymphopenia can be caused by glucocorticoids, and thus any debilitating condition
has the

potential to induce

lymphopenia

via

stress

mechanism

involving the

hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Therefore, treatment with glucocorticoids complicated
the issue regarding lymphopenia21.
Nine (11.5%) patients were diagnosed with NCIP, although the CT imaging was normal. This
result reveals that the CT examination lacks complete sensitivity and cannot alone reliably
fully exclude this disease, particularly early in the infection. Therefore, it is necessary to
combine the CT examination with RT-PCR to make a definite diagnosis. Besides, Ground
glass opacities, interlobular septal thickening, and consolidations were consistent HRCT
manifestations in both metapneumovirus infection and SARS, the presence of crazy paving
pattern is more suggestive of SARS22. Although the pooled incidence of crazy paving pattern
(defined as thickened interlobular septa and intralobular lines with superimposed

ground-glass opacification) was 8.4%, it is very important imagining for NCIP.
Until now, conclusions on the mortality of NCIP are inconsistent. The early two researches
include 138 cases and 41 cases, the mortality was 4.3% and 15% respectively2,16.
Nevertheless, compared with more than 10% mortality of SARS-CoV and 35% mortality of
MERS-CoV23, 2019-nCoV has a lower case mortality. In our research, the pooled incidence
mortality was 8.9% respectively. Although this conclusion is basically consistent with
previous reports2,12, this result higher than the mortality reported by the Chinese government
(2.44%). The reason for this phenomenon is attributed to two aspects. First of all, the
single-arm meta-analysis is inherently less stable than the two-arm meta-analysis, but this is
unavoidable due to no enough clinical data. Secondly, there were not enough diagnosis
methods and treatment experiences about NCIP at the beginning of the outbreak. With the
improvement of recognitions of NCIP and the clinical application of antiviral drugs such as
Remdesivir17, the mortality will be further reduced.
A number of limitations need to be acknowledged. The limitations include those the number
of included studies is small, thus limiting to the detection of the publication bias and leading
to uncertainty of practical relevance of our meta-analysis. In addition, the clinical
characteristics are related to many factors, such as basic physical condition, disease progress,
examination and treatment conditions, etc. However, we were not able to conduct further
subgroup analysis based on the abovementioned factor because most of the included studies
did not separate the participants into different groups for outcome measurements. Third,
significant heterogeneity remains a critical concern in this meta-analysis. To solve this
problem, we used random-effects in meta-analysis and subgroup analysis was performed in
this study24. Besides, we did not calculate the pooled incidence rate unless the source was
identified by subgroup analysis. significant heterogeneity or a public basis10. Last but not least,
the single-arm meta-analysis without a control group, causality is difficult to determine from
the cases alone. However, all over the world, the onset of reactivation was relatively short and
consistent. The strengths of this work include our ability to detect a serious question that was
not observed during the clinical development program for NCIP.
In conclusion, the results of this single-arm meta-analysis and systemic review give us a
quantitative pooled incidence rate of clinical characteristics of NCIP. It is clear that all these

clinical characteristics has great potential to improve diagnosis and patient’s stratification in
NCIP. It may also have a clinical impact as clinic features is routinely used in clinical practice,
providing an unprecedented opportunity to improve decision support in NCIP for diagnosis or
treatment at fast and low cost. The findings suggest that although most NICP patients have
symptoms or abnormal CT imaging presentations, a few patients without any symptom or any
abnormal CT imaging. Therefore, a prescriptive diagnosis process and the vigilance for NCIP
is necessary. Besides, the digestive symptoms should be concerned, especially for the patients
with the contact history of NICP. However, at the beginning of the epidemic, a lack of clinical
research might influence the results of the meta-analysis. Further multivariate studies are
warranted to corroborate the findings of this meta-analysis.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We thank the patients, the nurses and clinical staff who are providing care for the patient, and
