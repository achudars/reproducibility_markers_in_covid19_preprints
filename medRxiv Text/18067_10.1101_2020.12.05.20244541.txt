Abstract

21

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted

22

in a pandemic of the respiratory disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Antibody testing

23

is essential to identify persons exposed to the virus and potentially in predicting disease

24

immunity. 183 COVID-19 patients (68 of whom required mechanical ventilation) and 41 controls

25

were tested for plasma IgG, IgA and IgM against the SARS-CoV-2 S1, S2, receptor binding

26

domain (RBD) and N proteins using the MILLIPLEX® SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Panel. Plasma cytokines

27

were concurrently measured using the MILLIPLEX® MAP Human Cytokine/Chemokine/Growth

28

Factor Panel A. As expected the 183 COVID-19 positive patients had high levels of IgG, IgA and

29

IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against each of the viral proteins. Sensitivity of anti-S1 IgG

30

increased from 60% to 93% one week after symptom onset. S1-IgG and S1-IgA had specificities

31

of 98% compared to the 41 COVID-19 negative patients. The 68 ventilated COVID-19 positive

32

patients had higher antibody levels than the 115 COVID-19 positive patients who were not

33

ventilated. IgG antibody levels against S1 protein had the strongest positive correlation to days

34

from symptom onset. There were no statistically significant differences in IgG, IgA and IgM

35

antibodies against S1 based on age. We found that patients with the highest levels of anti-SARS-

36

CoV-2 antibodies had the lowest viral load in the nasopharynx. Finally there was a correlation of

37

high plasma IL-10 with low anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels, as

38

measured by a novel antigen panel, increased within days after symptom onset, achieving >

39

90% sensitivity and specificity within one week, and were highest in patients who required

40

mechanical ventilation. Antibody levels were inversely associated with viral load but did not

differ as a function of age. The correlation of high IL-10 with low antibody response suggests a

42

potentially suppressive role of this cytokine in the humoral immune response in COVID-19.

Introduction

45

Since its discovery in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 61.8 million cases of COVID-

46

19 resulting in more than 1.4 million deaths (1). Disease symptoms develop between 2-14 days

47

after virus exposure and include but are not limited to fever, cough, shortness of breath,

48

fatigue, new loss of taste or smell, and diarrhea (2). A large proportion of infected individuals

49

recover from the virus on their own, but some require hospitalization, supplemental oxygen

50

and mechanical ventilation (2, 3, 4). Little is yet know about long term health effects of COVID-

51

19 or immunity to reinfection. While polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for the virus is an

52

effective way to diagnosis active infection, antibody testing is critical to identify exposed

53

individuals and potentially predict disease timepoint and future immunity.

54

SARS-CoV-2 is made up of multiple proteins that the immune system can recognize as antigens.

55

These proteins include spike protein subunits (S1 and S2), the receptor binding domain (RBD)

56

that is found on the S1 subunit, and the nucleocapsid protein (N) enclosed in the membrane

57

allows for determination if an individual has been exposed to the virus even if they were

58

asymptomatic. However, there are concerns that antibodies from related coronaviruses will

59

cross react with these tests (6, 7, 8). The relationship between time from infection and antibody

60

production is not fully delineated nor is it understood why antibody responses have a delayed

61

onset in some patients. As vaccines are being developed, it is important to understand what

62

antibody responses are beneficial and promote immunity, and be able to compare antibody

63

responses from people with natural immunity and those who have been vaccinated. The ability

64

to quantify several antigen specific antibodies by multiplex is a valuable tool in mapping

65

immune response. Here we describe how IgG, IgA and IgM antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2

66

antigens measured by the MILLIPLEX® SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Panels relate with disease severity,

67

age, days from symptom onset, viral burden and plasma IL-10.

Methods

70

Sample Collection and Study Population. Blood samples from 224 patients tested for SARS-

71

CoV-2 by PCR between April and September 2020 were collected at the University of Virginia

72

Medical Center. Clinical information and patient demographics were was obtained from the

73

electronic medical records and confidentiality was maintained by assigning each patient a

74

unique identifier. The collection of blood samples and deidentified patient information was

75

approved by the University of Virginia Institutional Review Board (IRB-HSR #22231 and 200110).

76

183 of the 224 patients tested were COVID-19 positive and 41 were COVID-19 negative. Of the

77

COVID-19 positive patients, 70 had two samples from different time points including their first

78

available blood sample after COVID-19 testing and another 7 to 10 days later. 68 of the COVID-

79

19 positive patients were placed on mechanical ventilation. Day of symptom onset was

80

obtained through retrospective chart review of who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The start of

81

patient's symptoms was determined by reviewing the history of present illness from the

82

electronic medical record. Out of 183 patients reviewed, 2 were asymptomatic for SARS-CoV-2.

83

Of the remaining 181 patients, day of symptom onset was determined for 112 patients and was

84

unknown for 69 patients. Nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold (Ct) values were

quantified by GeneXpert XVI and GeneXpert Infinity diagnostic systems (Cepheid, Sunnyvale,

86

CA).

87

Antibody Detection. Blood collected in EDTA was centrifuged at 1300 x g for 10 minutes, then

88

plasma was aliquoted and stored at -80°C until testing. IgG, IgA and IgM antibody levels against

89

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunits S1 and S2, RBD and N were measured in duplicate plasma

90

samples from the 224 patients using novel MILLIPLEX® SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Panel 1 IgG, SARS-

91

CoV-2 Antigen Panel 1 IgA and SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Panel 1 IgM (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO,

92

Catalog Numbers: HC19SERG1-85K, HC19SERA1-85K, and HC19SERM1-85K respectively; For

93

Research Use Only. Not For Use In Diagnostic Procedures). This panel is designed to measure

94

antibodies by median fluorescent intensity (MFI). The four antigens are recombinant poly-his-

95

tagged. Samples were diluted 1:100 in assay buffer. 96-well plates were pre-wetted with 200 µL

96

wash buffer, covered with plate sealer and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature with

97

shaking, then emptied. 25 µL of each diluted sample was added to the sample wells and 25 µL

98

of assay buffer was added to background wells. 60 µL of both sonicated (30 seconds) and

99

vortexed (1 minute) analyte and control bead was combined and brought to a final volume of 3

100

mL with the addition of assay buffer, vortexed, and 25 µL of bead mixture was dispensed into

101

each plate well. The plate was sealed and incubated for 2 hours at RT with constant shaking. A

102

handheld magnetic plate washer was used to retain magnetic beads while liquid contents were

103

discarded appropriately, and wells were washed 3 times with 200 µL wash buffer. 50 µL of

104

phycoerythrin-anti-human immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA or IgM per kit in use) detection antibody

105

was added to each well, plate sealed and incubated 90 minutes at RT with constant shaking.

107

added to each well, the plate was then sealed and shaken at RT for 5 minutes. The plate was

108

then read on a Luminex® MAGPIX™Instrument System with a minimum of 50 beads of each

109

analyte collected per well.

110

Il-10 Detection. Il-10 in plasma were measured using the MILLIPLEX® MAP Human

111

Cytokine/Chemokine/Growth Factor Panel A (48 Plex) (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO, Catalog

112

Number HCYTA-60K-PX48, For Research Use Only. Not For Use In Diagnostic Procedures).

113

Statistical Methods. All statistical comparisons and graphs were made using GraphPad Prism 8

114

software. Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to compare initial antibody levels between

115

COVID-19 positive and negative groups and different age groups of COVID-19 positive patients.

116

Sensitivity and specificity were calculated in GraphPad Prism. Simple linear regression and

117

Spearman correlations were used to associate antibody levels with days from symptom onset in

118

COVID-19 and assess the relationship between viral load and IgG antibodies that are specific for

119

SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Patient’s with CT values of zero were excluded from analysis. A non-linear

120

regression analysis with the y= log(x) function was performed in R Studio to correlate IL-10

121

levels from initial samples with IgG levels in ventilated and not ventilated COVID-19 positive

122

patients (Not Ventilated n=40; Ventilated n = 51). A p value <0.05 was considered statistically

123

significant.

Antibody Response to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 Positive and Negative Patients

127

A total of 224 patients were tested for IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S1, S2,

128

RBD and N proteins. Of these patients, 183 were positive for COVID-19 and 41 were negative.

129

68 of the COVID-19 positive patients were ventilated and 115 were not. COVID-19 positive

130

patients had significantly higher antibodies against all SARS-CoV-2 proteins compared to COVID-

131

19 negative patients (Figure 1, Supplemental Figure 1). Specificity was high for all antigens,

132

specifically S1-IgG and S1-IgA had specificities of 97.6% and S1-IgM that had a specificity of

133

92%. IgA antibodies against all antigens were elevated in COVID-19 positive ventilated patients

134

compared to not ventilated COVID-19 positive patients. IgG antibodies against S1, S2 and RBD

135

were significantly increased in ventilated patients compared to not ventilated COVID-19

136

positive patients, and antibodies against N were trending higher in ventilated patients. IgM

137

antibodies against S1, S2 and N were also significantly higher in ventilated individuals (Figure 1,

138

Supplemental Figure 1).

139

Antibody Response to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 Positive Patients and Age

140

COVID-19 positive patients were divided into 4 age groups (<30, 30-49, 50-69 and >70 years

141

old) and their antibody levels were compared. There were no statistically significant difference

142

in IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies against S1 between the different age groups (Figure 2,

143

Supplemental Figure 2).

144

Correlation of Antibody Levels and Days from Symptom Onset

145

Antigen-specific antibodies were analyzed as a function of days from symptom onset

146

(Supplemental Figure 3a-c). All correlations were statistically significant. IgG antibodies against

147

S1 were most positively correlated with days from symptom onset with an r 2 value of 0.4030

148

compared to IgA (r2=0.2142) and IgM (r2=0.2658) antibodies (Figure 3a-c). IgG antibodies

149

against RBD and S2 followed a similar pattern of correlation as antibodies S1 (Supplemental

150

Figure 3a). Sensitivity also went up after one week from symptom onset. S1-IgG went from

151

59.6% sensitivity to 92.5%, S1-IgA from 66% to 93.3% and S1-IgM from 68.1% to 95.8%.

152

Correlation of IgG Antibody Levels and Viral Load

153

IgG antibody levels were correlated to clinical Ct values. IgG antibodies against S1, S2, RBD and

154

N were found to be positively correlated with Ct values, indicating that patients with lower viral

155

titers have higher levels of IgG (Figure 4).

156

Correlation of IgG Antibody Levels and Il-10

157

IgG antibody levels were correlated to Il-10 levels. Anti-S1, S2, RBD and N IgG antibodies were

158

found to negatively correlate to Il-10 in COVID-19 positive patients who received mechanical

159

ventilation (Figure 5).

160
161

Discussion

162

The development of accurate serological testing is critical during the COVID-19 pandemic to

163

efficiently determine exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Here we demonstrated sensitive and specific

164

detection of IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens S1, S2, RBD in COVID-19

165

positive patients. There was little apparent cross-reactivity with other related coronaviruses

166

with the exception of IgG against S2 which showed modest reactivity in COVID-19 (-) patients,

167

alleviating concerns of false positive antibody tests (7, 8). Additionally, ventilated COVID-19

168

positive patients had statistically significant higher antibody levels against most antigens

169

compared to not ventilated COVID-19 positive patients. This confirms similar findings that

170

individuals with more severe disease have higher antibody levels (9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14). Further

171

studies need to be done to understand the relationship between increased antibody production

172

and ventilation.

173

Age has been shown to be the biggest risk factor for more severe disease and death due to

174

COVID-19. Being over 50 doubles the risk of mortality and over 80 has a 20-fold increase risk of

175

death (15). Here we have shown there are no significant differences in antibody levels,

176

suggesting that antibody production does not contribute to age-related mortalities.

177

We were able to determine days from symptom onset for 112 of the 181 COVID-19 positive

178

patients and of those 45 patients had longitudinal samples 7 to 10 days after their initial

179

samples. We correlated antibody levels in all of these patient samples with days from symptom

180

onset. IgG antibodies best correlated with time from symptom onset. IgA and IgM antibodies

181

did significantly increase over time, but had a weaker coorelations compared to IgG. This

182

suggests that measuring IgG levels can help predict where a patient may be in their disease

183

course. Sensitivity also went up with time from symptom onset, with all antibodies nearing

184

100% sensitivity after one week. Other researchers have detected antibodies present as early

185

as 2-4 days after symptom onset with all patients producing antibodies by 14 days, similar to

186

what we found (14, 16). Ng et al. found that individuals not infected with SARS-CoV-2,

187

particularly children and young adults, have anti-S2 antibodies that are linked to other human

188

coronavirus (17). In Supplemental Figure 3 A, we demonstrate that S2-IgG antibodies are

189

present in patients as early as the day of symptom onset, suggesting that these antibodies may

190

be boosted from a previous coronavirus infection. While anti-S2 antibody levels are significantly

191

higher in patients with COVID-19, there are several patients with no prior SARS-CoV-2 infection

192

that have these antibodies (Supplemental Figure 1).

193

Studies have indicated that higher SARS-CoV-2 viral burden results in increased disease severity

194

(18, 19). Here we correlated antibody levels with threshold cycle values (Ct values) from initial

195

COVID-19 diagnosis and found that IgG antibodies positively correlated with Ct values. This

196

suggests that patients have higher antibody responses have lower viral burden. Wang et al

197

found similar results when comparing Ct values to antibody titers (20). These results could

198

suggest that patients with stronger antibody response are able to clear the infection better.

199

This may also be indicative of patients being tested further from symptom onset and therefore

200

having lower viral burden and higher antibody levels. IgG antibodies also negatively correlated

201

with Il-10 levels. Activation of the Il-10 receptor on B cells has been reported to promote B cell

202

survival and differentiation into IgM and IgG secreting plasmablasts. The association of high IL-

203

10 with low antibody responses in ventilated patients is therefore apparently paradoxical, and

204

worthy of further study (21).

205

To conclude, we found that the MILLIPLEX® SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Panels successfully detected

206

antigen specific antibodies in patients with COVID-19 and that patients who needed mechanical

207

ventilation had higher IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies compared to not ventilated patients. While

208

some antibody levels are lower in patients under 30, we did not see a strong correlation

209

between age and antibody levels. We did find that IgG better correlates with days from

210

symptom onset compared to IgA and IgM antibodies. With the approaching availability of

211

COVID-19 vaccinations, this test would also be beneficial in determining whether a person has

212

immunity due to natural infection or immunity from vaccination. Vaccinated individuals would

213

potentially have titers against spike proteins but not the nucleocapsid. These results indicate

214

the importance of antibody testing to determine disease time point and potential predict
