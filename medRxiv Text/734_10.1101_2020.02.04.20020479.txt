Abstract
Background: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan City,
China, at the end of 2019 and has caused an outbreak of human-to-human
transmission with a Public Health Emergency of International Concern
declared by the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020.
Aim: We aimed to estimate the potential risk and geographic range of Wuhan
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread within and beyond China from January
through to April, 2020.
Methods: A series of domestic and international travel network-based
connectivity and risk analyses were performed, by using de-identified and
aggregated mobile phone data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports.
Results: The cordon sanitaire of Wuhan is likely to have occurred during the
latter stages of peak population numbers leaving the city before Lunar New
Year (LNY), with travellers departing into neighbouring cities and other
megacities in China. We estimated that 59,912 air passengers, of which 834
(95% UI: 478 - 1349) had 2019-nCoV infection, travelled from Wuhan to 382
cities outside of mainland China during the two weeks prior to Wuhan’s
lockdown. The majority of these cities were in Asia, but major hubs in Europe,
the US and Australia were also prominent, with strong correlation seen
between predicted importation risks and reported cases. Because significant
spread has already occurred, a large number of airline travellers (3.3 million
under the scenario of 75% travel reduction from normal volumes) may be
required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations
across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 to
effectively limit spread beyond its current extent.
Conclusion: Further spread of 2019-nCoV within China and international
exportation is likely to occur. All countries, especially vulnerable regions,
should be prepared for efforts to contain the 2019-nCoV infection.

Introduction
In December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause
were reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and
epidemiologically linked to a seafood wholesale market [1, 2]. It has been
determined that the pathogen causing the viral pneumonia among affected
individuals is a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [1, 3]. The pathogen exhibits
high human-to-human transmissibility and has spread rapidly within and
beyond Wuhan city [4, 5]. On January 30th, 2020, World Health Organization
(WHO) declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a Public Health Emergency of
International Concern [6].
Wuhan is central China’s transportation hub with a population of 11 million
residents and a large number of higher-education students (~1.3 million in 89
universities and colleges), a particularly mobile population [7]. Beyond these
factors, viral spread was likely exacerbated further by the surge in domestic
and international travel during the 40-day Lunar New Year (LNY) celebrations
(from January 10th, 2020 to February 18th, 2020) – the largest annual human
migration in the world, comprised of hundreds of millions of people travelling
across the country. As of February 4th, 2020, China has reported 20,530
confirmed cases and 23,314 suspected cases with 2019-nCoV infections [8].
Of the confirmed cases, 2788 are severe and 426 people have died. Most
cases were reported from Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province, and all
provinces have confirmed cases imported from Wuhan and secondary
transmission has been reported in some provinces. Additionally, there were
153 cases reported in 23 countries outside of China, with most having a travel
history involving Wuhan [6].
The potential pathway from this local outbreak in Wuhan to a pandemic
might involve four steps: i) local transmission in Wuhan (primary city of
epidemic); ii) spread from Wuhan to other cities within and beyond China via
infected travellers, causing sporadic secondary transmission in these cities
(secondary city of epidemic), iii) further spreading from secondary cities with
local transmission to other tertiary cities in China and international cities via
returning travellers after the LNY holiday; iv) onward transmission across
multiple countries and leading to a pandemic. To interrupt the spread, a cordon
sanitaire of Wuhan and surrounding cities in Hubei Province has been in place
since January 23rd, 2020, just two days before the LNY’s Day. However,
significant numbers of people had likely already travelled back to their
hometowns for the holiday by this time. According to Wuhan authorities, it is

likely that more than five million residents had already left the city before the
lockdown, but where they went and how high the risk of spreading the virus
remains an open question [9].
Here we conducted a travel network-based analysis to explore patterns of
domestic and international population movements from high-risk cities in China,
and provide preliminary estimates of the potential risk of 2019-nCoV spreading
across and beyond the country. Given the current epidemic and limited
understanding of the epidemiology of this disease, our findings on travel
patterns from historical data can help contribute to tailoring public health
interventions.

Methods
To identify the areas that are most vulnerable to virus importation, we
performed and integrated a series of analyses, by using de-identified and
aggregated mobile phone-based population movement data, air passenger
itinerary data, and case reports. We defined the potential risk and geographic
range of 2019-nCoV virus spread across three scenarios: 1) from the primary
city (Wuhan) into other cities in mainland China (31 provincial regions), 2) from
high-risk secondary cities into other cities across China, and 3) from high-risk
cities in mainland China into cities in other countries or regions during the LNY
holiday and the following three months. We also estimated the number of
airline travellers likely needing to be quarantined or screened to capture
travellers potentially exposed to 2019-nCoV in high-risk cities of mainland
China.
Spread risk and destinations of 2019-nCoV from Wuhan
To define daily patterns and the connectivity of population movements at
county and prefecture (city) level across mainland China during the LNY
holiday and the following three months, we used the aggregated and
de-identified daily flow of the users of Baidu, the largest Chinese search
engine [10]. Baidu offers location-based service (LBS), based on the global
positioning system (GPS), IP address, location of signalling towers and WIFI,
for online searching, mapping, and a large variety of apps and software for
mobile devices. These data have been used to visualize population migration
around Chinese New Year [10]. Two Baidu datasets were used in this study.
The first one covers daily movement data at county level from December 1st,
2013 to April 30th, 2014, as described elsewhere [11]. We calculated relative

netflow following the equation below to extract daily patterns during LNY
holiday at county level, with the population in 2014 obtained from the Chinese
Bureau of Statistics [12].
Relative netflow = (inflow – outflow) / population of each county
The second dataset is a more recent daily movement matrix at the city
level based on data from Baidu’s search app from January 1st, 2015 to April
30th, 2015. The last recorded locations of a user (or device) for each day were
compared, and if the location changed, then we counted the user (or device)
as someone who had moved from one city to another city. To understand the
spread risk of 2019-nCoV from Wuhan into other cities via domestic population
movement, we aggregated daily outflows of people from Wuhan to other cities
across mainland China for the two weeks (the quarantine period of the virus)
prior to the cordon sanitaire of Wuhan. As the travel ban took place on January
23rd, 2020, just 2 days before LNY’s day, and given that LNY’s day in 2015 was
February 19th, we took February 17th, 2015 as a reference of the lockdown day
in our dataset. Using the second dataset, then the risk of importation for each
destination city or province was preliminarily defined as the percentage of
travellers received by each city or province out of the total volume of travellers
leaving Wuhan during the two weeks before the city’s lockdown.

Spread risk from high-risk secondary cities in mainland China
These secondary cities may have a high risk of community-level
transmission through the introduction of infected travellers from Wuhan, and
then spread the virus to other tertiary cities by returning population movements
after the LNY holiday, causing an even wider spread of the virus. As most of
the cities in Hubei province have implemented the same travel controls as
Wuhan before LNY, we defined the high-risk secondary cities outside of Hubei
province as the cities within top 30 ranked cities (Supplementary Table S1)
with the highest risk of importation from Wuhan defined above. Based on the
2015 Baidu dataset on population movement, the risk of spreading the virus
from high-risk secondary cities to tertiary cities was preliminarily calculated as
the averaged percentage of travellers received by each tertiary city out of the
total volume of travellers leaving each high-risk secondary city during the four
weeks following LNY’s Day. We chose a period of four weeks because the
returning flow of LNY’s population movement, Chunyun, generally lasts four
weeks.

Destinations of the virus spreading beyond mainland China
To define the connectivity and risk of 2019n-CoV spreading from Wuhan
and high-risk secondary cities defined above, into the cities beyond mainland
China, we obtained aggregated itinerary data from the International Air Travel
Association (IATA) [13]. IATA data accounts for approximately 90% of
passenger travel itineraries on commercial flights, and these data represent
direct origin (Wuhan) to destination trips, and indirect trips that originated in
Wuhan, but had connecting flights to a final destination. We quantified monthly
volumes of airline travellers departing Wuhan and high-risk secondary cities
from February 1st, 2018, through April 30th, 2018. With the assumption that the
population movements around the LNY holiday in 2020 was consistent with the
pattern in 2018, all final destinations were ranked by volumes of airline
travellers, and the relative risk of importation was defined as the percentage of
airline travellers received by each destination city out of the total volume of
travellers leaving high-risk cities in China.
We also estimated the number of airline travellers that may have needed
to be kept in quarantine from Wuhan during the two weeks prior to the city’s
travel ban. The LNY’s day in 2018 was on February 16 and the lockdown of
Wuhan happened two days before LNY’s day, corresponding to the date of
February 14th, 2018. We therefore defined the number of travellers needing to
be quarantined as half of the volume of airline travellers from Wuhan in
February, 2018, representing the 2-week total number of travellers for the first
half of February. We then estimated the number of infections and its 95%
uncertainty interval (UI) in these airline travellers from Wuhan, based on a
binomial distribution and the proportion of 2019-nCoV infections in the citizens
evacuated from Wuhan reported by Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and
Germany, as of January 31st, 2020 [6, 14-17].
Additionally, to capture travellers potentially exposed to virus, we also
estimated the volume of airline travellers that would be required to be
screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe
for the following three months of February to April. Considering air traffic flows
from China have changed due to the airline flight cancellations, travel
restrictions imposed by countries or regions, or changes in travel behaviours,
we calculated the volume of travellers using different scenarios of reductions
(50%, 75%, and 90%) in total passenger volumes.

Validation
As we used historial data to predict travel patterns in 2020, to ensure that
the seasonal patterns observed over LNY and holidays more generally are
consistent over multiple years and countries, we collated country-level
domestic and international passenger statistics for air travel from 2010 to 2018,
and compared these against a comprehensive time series of public and school
holidays across the world during the same period (Supplementary Note).
Additionally, we also compared the spatial patterns of the risks of Chinese
cities importing the virus from Wuhan, estimated by the population movement
data in 2014 and 2015, and more recent data on the top 50 ranked origin and
destination cities in January 2020, available from the Baidu Migration site
(https://qianxi.baidu.com/). To futher validate our results, we also compared
the importation risk estimated in this study with the number of reported
imported cases from Wuhan to other provinces in mainland China, as of
January 25th, 2020, and the number of imported cases reported by other
countries or regions, as of February 3rd, 2020 [6]. The distribution between
days of travelling from Wuhan, illness onset, first medical visit, and
hospitalization of imported cases, as of January 25th, 2020, were also analysed.
These case data were collated from the websites of WHO, national and local
health authorities or new agencies within and beyond China (Supplementary
Note). R version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)
was used to perform data analyses.

Results
Risk and destinations of virus spread within mainland China
Significant migratory flows occurred in opposite directions before and after
LNY’s Day. In Wuhan City, mass movements of people began about three
weeks prior to LNY, with the first peak of population leaving the city before the
start of the winter holiday for universities, especially in the three counties that
contain many universities and students (Figure 1). Although a cordon sanitaire
of Wuhan and some cities in Hubei Province has been in place since January
23rd, 2020, the timing of this may have occurred during the latter stages of
peak population numbers leaving Wuhan, as another peak of movements out
of the city was seen 2 days before LNY’s day.
We found that a large number of travellers were likely departing Wuhan
into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China before Wuhan’s

lockdown (Supplementary Tables S1). Other cities in Hubei Province received
huge amounts of people during the two weeks before LNY and showed a
decreasing population since LNY, following a peak of outflow at the end of the
LNY holiday (Figure 1b and Supplementary Table S2). If Wuhan’s lockdown
had not have been undertaken, our analyses suggest the main destination
cities of population outflow since LNY would have been similar to the situation
two weeks prior to LNY (Supplementary Table S3).
In terms of the initial importation risk of virus for each city during the two
weeks before Wuhan’s lockdown, nearly all other cities in Hubei Province were
estimated to be high-risk areas (Figure 2a). Other places with high risks were
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other large cities. In terms of the provincial
level, the risks were high in Guangdong and Hunan, followed by Henan and
Zhejiang (Figure 2b). There was a significant correlation (r-squared = 0.59, p <
0.001) between the number of imported cases and the risk of importation
estimated from traveller numbers from Wuhan within the two weeks before
LNY’s Day (Figure 3a). Further, a high proportion of cases travelled with
symptoms at the early stage of the outbreak, and the lag from illness onset to
hospitalization decreased from a median of 6 days (Interquartile range: 4-7
days) in the first half of January 2020 to 3 days (1-5 days) in the second half
(Figure 4).
According to our definition outlined in the methods, the 17 high-risk
secondary cities outside of Hubei Province were identified as: Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou, Zhengzhou, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Changsha,
Xi’an, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Nanchang, Chengdu, Hefei, Fuzhou,
and Dongguan (Figure 5). Should community-level outbreaks occur in these
cities, they could contribute to further spread of infection to other highly
connected cities within China via movement after the holiday (Supplementary
Figures S1 and S2).

International spread risk and destinations
Based on historical air travel data, the connectivity and spread risk
between high-risk cities in mainland China and cities in other countries or
regions was defined for the three months around the LNY holiday
(Supplementary Figure S3 and Tables S4 and S5). Bangkok, Hong Kong, and
Taipei ranked in the top three, followed by Seoul, Tokyo and Singapore. The
main destinations were presented by region in the supplemental materials
(Supplementary Figures S3-S9 and Table S4-S7). During the two weeks
before Wuhan’s lockdown, there were an estimated total 59,912 airline

travellers from Wuhan that may have needed to be kept in quarantine at the
382 destinations outside of mainland China (Supplementary Table S8).
Thailand, Japan, and Taiwan ranked in the top three, followed by Malaysia,
Hong Kong, and Singapore. Based on an overall infection rate of 1.39%
(16/1149; 95% UI: 0.80% - 2.25%) in citizens evacuated from Wuhan before
February 1st, 2020, reported by Singapore (1.08%, 1/92), South Korea (1.36%,
5/368), Japan (1.42%, 8/565), and Germany (1.61%, 2/124), we made
preliminary estimates of a total of 834 (95% UI: 478 - 1349) airline travellers
that may have been infected with 2019-nCoV from Wuhan two weeks prior to
the city’s lockdown. If adjusted by the estimated doubling time of the virus
transmission from the lockdown to the evaualtion, 297 (170, 480) airline
travellers may have been infected (Supplementary Table S8). As of February
3rd, 2020, a significant correlation (r-squared = 0.58, p < 0.001) was seen
between the number of imported cases reported in those countries or regions
and the risk of importation via travellers defined in our study (Figure 3b).
Because significant intranational and international spread from Wuhan has
already occurred, a very large number of airline travellers (6.5 million under the
scenario of 50% travel reduction as usual, 3.3 million under 75% reduction,
and 1.3 million under 90% reduction, respectively) would be required to be
screened at origin high-risk cities in China (Figure 5) and destinations across
the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 (Table 1 and
Supplementary Tables S9 and S10), to ensure that all travellers from high risk
cities were covered.
Addtionally, based on monthly air passenger travel statistics and time
series of public and school holidays in 91 countries from 2010 to 2018
(Supplementary Note), we found the seasonal pattens of domestic and
international population movements across years were highly consistent with
the timing and duration of public and school holidays in different countries
(Supplementary Figure S10 and S11). Moreover, we also found similar spatial
patterns in the risks of Chinese cities importing the virus from Wuhan via
population movements estimated by both the Baidu data in 2014 and 2015,
and the more recent data covering the top 50 ranked destinations in 2020,
(Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure S12), highlighting the value of using
historical data to rapidly assess present day risks.

itinerary data have been widely used to quantify the connectivity and
transmission risk of pathogens via domestic and international human travel
[18-23]. Given the rapidly growing number of confirmed 2019-nCoV infections,
increasing evidence of human-to-human transmission within and beyond
China [4, 24], and our limited understanding of this novel virus [25, 26], the
findings here from travel patterns in historical data and spread risk estimation
can help guide public health preparedness and intervention design across the
world [27].
In terms of domestic connectivity and risk, the high population outflows
from three counties in Wuhan with many colleges and universities in the first
two weeks of January were likely college students leaving the city to avoid the
peak traffic just one week before the New Year. Because of the early timing of
this movement, many students might have avoided the period when the virus
spread rapidly in Wuhan, and their risk of spreading the virus may be low as
well. However, our results suggest that during the two weeks prior to Wuhan’s
travel ban, a large number of travellers still departed Wuhan into neighbouring
cities and other megacities in China and may have spread the virus to new
areas, as the timing of the lockdown occurred during the latter stages of peak
population numbers leaving Wuhan. Further exacerbating this risk, we found
that during the outbreak’s initial stages, a particularly high proportion of cases
travelled with illness caused by the virus, together with the transmissibility of
2019-nCoV through asymptomatic contacts, potentially causing additional
transmission during travel [28].
Moreover, several destination cities (Figure 5) outside of Hubei Province
that received high volume of travellers from Wuhan prior to LNY’s day may
serve as significant secondary cities in the outbreak. Most of these cities have
large populations and international airports, highly connected with other
regions within and beyond China. The initial imported seed cases likely caused
the local community transmission, and further spread the virus into wider
geographical ranges following the population flows occurring due to the LNY
holiday [19]. Therefore, substantial public health interventions have been
immediately applied across the country since LNY, including the cordon
sanitaire in several of the most affected cities, cancellation of mass gatherings,
reduction of travel and contact rate, as well as the extension of the LNY and
school winter holiday, which might mitigate subsequent local establishment of
2019-nCoV introduced by travellers.
Beyond the cases that have occurred in China, air passengers have
spread 2019-nCoV across countries and continents within a short time period
[28, 29]. In particular, a high volume of international airline travellers left

Wuhan for hundreds of destination cities across the world during the two
weeks prior to the travel restriction implemented in the city. Substantial
preparedness efforts at destination cities should be taken to prevent further
international seeding and transmission, otherwise the local establishment of
epidemics, and even a pandemic, might become inevitable. For example,
exit and entry screening may be futher extended to capture travellers with
fever who have potentially been exposed to the virus in high-risk Chinese cities
where local transmission has been established. However, we estimated that a
huge volume of airline travellers would be required to be screened in February
to April, even under the scenario of significant reduction (90%) in air
passengers compared with the same period of previous years. Therefore,
ensuring that surveillance and health systems around the world are ready and
sufficiently strong to detect and deal with cases seen is a priority.
It is expected that further international exportation of cases from China will
occur and cases may appear in any country [30]. Thus, all countries should be
prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection,
isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward
spread of the 2019-nCoV infection [6, 31]. Of additional concern is that the
anticipated destinations of hundreds of thousands of travellers departing China
are to low-income or lower-middle income countries, where inadequately
resourced medical and public health systems might be unable to detect and
adequately manage an imported case of 2019n-CoV, including possible
subsequent community spread.
Due to current limited knowledge of the epidemiology of the virus at the
time of writing (e.g. the proportion and infectiousness of asymptomatic or
subclinical infections) and the rapidly changing situation of the outbreak, the
simplicity of our approach to define importation risk can help to quickly update
risk assessments, prioritise surveillance, target limited resources and
understand the potential of 2019n-CoV introduction at specific destinations
[32]. Compared with other studies [33, 34], we explored the various scenarios
of travel restriction and used a more comprehensive and spatio-temporally
detailed population movement matrix, together with details on the actual final
destination cities of air passengers based on the global itinerary dataset.
These novel datasets provide new insights on the impacts of internal and
international connectivity on potential transmission of this emerging pathogen
during the LNY holiday and over the next three months.
Nevertheless, it is important to note that our study has several major
limitations. Firstly, while we do present simple scenarios of reduced air travel
volumes, our primary analyses assume “business as usual” travel based on

previous non-outbreak years, when significant spatio-temporal changes to
human travel behaviours across and beyond China have likely occurred
recently. Second, the mobile phone data used may provide an incomplete and
biased picture of travellers, as the data only cover the population owning a
smart phone and using Baidu apps. Third, the case data used in this study
likely varies in quality and completeness due to the timeliness of reporting,
varying laboratory diagnosis capacities, and differences in details announced
on health authority websites. Fourth, compared with airline travellers leaving
Wuhan prior to January 23rd evacuees from Wuhan during the January 29th –
31st period might have a higher risk of infection due to their longer stay in
Wuhan during the potential continued spread of the virus since January 23rd.
This may result in overestimates of the number of infections in airline travellers
from Wuhan prior to the city’s lockdown. Based on more recent population
movement and epidemiological data, we aim to conduct more sophisticated
modelling approaches to assess the effectiveness of control measures in
China, the impact of movements of people returning from LNY holiday, as well

Figure legends
Figure 1: Patterns of daily human movement by county in Wuhan City
and Hubei Province across five months.
(A) Wuhan City. (B) Hubei province (excluding Wuhan). Each blue line
reprents the netflow of population movement in each county. Yellow lines
reprent the netflow of population movement of three counties (Wuchang,
Hongshan, and Jiangxia) with more universities or collegues in Wuhan.
Vertical red line shows the day of cordon sanitaire in place in cities of Hubei.
Shadow colours: yellow – 2 weeks before the start of winter break of
universities in Wuhan; green - 2 weeks before LNY’s Day; red - 2 weeks since
LNY’s Day; blue - Lantern Festival and weekend; purple - Tomb Sweeping
holiday and weekend. Relative netflow = (Inflow – Outflow)/population, based
on the population movement data in 2013-2014 obtained from Baidu, Inc.
Figure 2: Risk of cities and provinces in mainland China receiving
travellers with 2019-nCoV infections from Wuhan during the two weeks
before the city’s lockdown.
(A) at city level. (B) at provincial level (excluding Hubei). The risk of
importation for each destination city or province was preliminarily defined as
the percentage of travellers received by each city or province out of the total
volume of travellers leaving Wuhan during the two weeks before the city’s
lockdown.
Figure 3: Correlation between the number of cases reported and the risk
of importation via travel.
(A) Number of imported cases reported by each province (excluding Hubei), as
of January 25th, 2020, versus the risk of importation from Wuhan. The risk of
importation for each province was preliminarily defined as the percentage of
travellers received by each province out of the total volume of travellers
leaving Wuhan during the two weeks before the city’s lockdown. (B) Number of
imported cases reported by each country or region, as of February 3rd, 2020,
versus the risk of importation from Wuhan. The risk of importation for each
country or region was preliminarily defined as the percentage of travellers
received by each destination out of the total volume of airline travellers leaving
Wuhan from February to April 2018. Grey lines represent linear regression of

importation risk against the number of cases reported, with R-squared and
p-values are indicated on the graphs.
Figure 4: Time distributions of cases imported from Wuhan into other
cities in China before the city’s lockdown on January 23rd, 2020.
(A) Time difference from leaving Wuhan to illness onset (N=145). The negative
days means onset of illness prior to travelling. (B) Time difference from illness
onset to first medical visit (N=164). (C) Time difference from first medical visit
to hospitalization (N=164). (D) Days from illness onset to hospitalization during
the first half (N=67) and second half (N=80) of January, 2020, respectively. A
total of 164 cases with available data as of January 25th, 2020, were included.
Figure 5: Risk of cities in mainland China receiving travellers from
high-risk cities (blue circles) with 2019-nCoV infections or importations
during the next four weeks since LNY’s Day.
The risk of importation at city level was preliminarily defined as the averaged
percentage of travellers received by each city out of the total volume of
travellers leaving each high-risk city, based on the population movement data
in 2015 obtained from Baidu, Inc. The high-risk cities include Wuhan in Hubei
province and 17 cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Zhengzhou, Tianjin,
Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Changsha, Xi’an, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Chongqing,
Nanchang, Chengdu, Hefei, Fuzhou, and Dongguan) in other provinces
receiving high volume of travellers from Wuhan during the two weeks before
the city’s lockdown on January 23rd, 2020.
