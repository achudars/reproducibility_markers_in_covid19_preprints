Abstract
The outbreak of COVID-19 from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world with tremendous morbidity and mortality
in the elderly. In-hospital treatment addresses the multifaceted nature of the illness
including viral replication, cytokine storm, and endothelial injury with thrombosis. We
identified nine reports of early treatment outcomes in COVID-19 nursing home patients.
Multi-drug therapy including hydroxychloroquine with one or more anti-infectives,
corticosteroids, and antithrombotic agents can be extended to seniors in the nursing
home setting without hospitalization. Data from nine studies found multidrug regimens
relying on the use of hydroxychloroquine as well as other agents including doxycycline
were associated with a statistically significant and >60% reductions in mortality. Going
forward, we theorize and based on the evidence, that early empiric treatment for the
elderly with COVID-19 in the nursing home setting (or similar congregated settings with
elderly residents/patients) has a genuine probability of success and acceptable safety.
This group remains our highest at-risk group and warrants acute treatment focus that
will prevent the development and/or worsening of problems associated with COVID-19,
most particularly isolation, hospitalization, and death. In fact, with the rapidity and
severity of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in nursing homes, in-center treatment of patients
with acute COVID-19 is possibly the most rational and importantly feasible strategy to
reduce the risks of hospitalization and death. If the approach remains ‘wait-and-see’ and
elderly high-risk patients in such congregated nursing room type settings are allowed to
worsen with no early treatment, they may be too sick and fragile to benefit from inhospital therapeutics and are at risk for pulmonary failure, life-ending micro-thrombi of
the lungs, kidneys etc. We put forth the notion that the most important factor in this
regard, is making available early therapeutic intervention as described here. These
drugs include and under supervision by skilled doctors, combination/sequenced
ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine, azithromycin, doxycycline, bromhexine
hydrochloride, and favipiravir (outside the US), along with inhaled steroids such as
budesonide and oral steroids including dexamethasone and prednisone, and antithrombotic anti-clotting drugs such as heparin). As the clinical trials data on treatments
for COVID-19 mature, this early treatment therapeutic option deserves serious, urgent,
and sober consideration by the medical establishment and respective decision-makers.

Background
The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 virus and the resulting clinical disease known as
COVID-19, has spread across the world relentlessly and it appears now that it is
becoming endemic. This pathogen demonstrates high infectivity while the pathogenicity
at present continues generally to be low. Yet it still causes devastating consequences
to a proportion of high-risk persons, principally the elderly among us, and in particular
those with underlying medical conditions oft referred to as ‘co-morbidities’. Hence, we
recognize and appreciate that COVID-19 is a devastating illness for elderly persons with
underlying medical conditions who are infected. Case fatality (mortality) rates are
elevated and have been based thus far on laboratory confirmed cases and have not yet
included an accurate reflection of infection, for example mild or asymptomatic cases
that have recovered. Ideally, a more accurate and reliable infection fatality rate should
be reported as comprehensive data become available which would provide a more
precise reflection of lethality.
In the previous year, we have found that SARS-CoV-2 may lead to a spectrum of
COVID-19 syndromes including but not necessarily limited to asymptomatic exposure,
symptoms of the common cold, influenza-like symptoms, as well as fulminant
multiorgan system failure, the latter being responsible in large part for most fatalities
that have occurred. The most important variable for risk stratification for both
hospitalization and death is advanced age, which explains why nursing home patients
have accounted for a large fraction of deaths in most developed countries.
A policy brief published by the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) has outlined
clearly the impact of COVID-19 pathophysiology and severity of illness in the nursing
home, highlighting the grave challenge in treating and preventing death in this patient
population. The AGS reported that over 15,000 nursing homes and long-term care
facilities provide care for the oldest Americans who are at greatest risk for COVID-19
and its complications (pulmonary failure and death) especially as they have multiple
comorbidities.1,2 The AGS suggests consideration of ‘hospital-at-home’ care models as
a practical path forward.
Unfortunately, in nursing home residents there have been no large, well-funded,
high-quality randomized trials of single or multidrug regimens for COVID-19. Given the
enormous public health importance of the issue, we sought to assemble the available
information concerning treatments that have been attempted in senior homes (nursing
homes, old-aged homes, care homes, long-term care homes, assisted-living facilities
etc.) and their associated outcomes. In most circumstances, the comparator or
approach was watchful waiting and then hospitalization for severe symptoms for those
not afforded early multidrug treatment.
Methods
For pragmatic reasons we searched PubMed/MEDLINE database for literature
relevant to the question addressed here. Our literature search spanned a period up to

January 2021 using relevant search terms including COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, nursing
homes, long-term care, nursing home residents, high-risk, elderly residents, mortality,
death, treatment, and early treatment, to identify reports of attempts to treat COVID-19
in nursing homes with the primary outcome of study being hospitalization and/or
mortality. We sought to access as complete a body of evidence as appropriate to inform
this manuscript. Thus, study reference lists were also hand searched for any potentially
eligible reports. Evidence was also considered, where available, from additional sources
such as online preprint publications not yet having completed the peer-review process
(e.g. clinical medicine preprint repository, medRxiv.org etc.). This said, we point out that
such as yet unreviewed papers were subjected to rigorous review by the authors before
being considered for inclusion in this paper.
Relevant reports were examined in duplicate and independently for full
agreement on final eligibility to inform the review. We were prepared to discuss in
consensus debate in instances of potential eligibility disagreement and use of
adjudication if necessary. From the reports, we extracted data on mortality among those
treated with one or more drugs against COVID-19 and also for those in comparator
groups. This step was also conducted in duplicate and checked for accuracy. MedCalc
(https://www.softpedia.com/get/Science-CAD/MedCalc.shtml) was used to calculate
odds ratios/relative risks and their 95% confidence intervals and p-values for mortality.
For the purposes of this review, we defined ‘nursing home’ as any nursing home, longterm care facility, care home, assisted-living facility.
In sum, our approach towards inclusion of references in this manuscript was as
stringent as possible and included the same systematic and methodological rigor
reflective of approaches used for systematic reviews. We sought to alert the clinical and
medical research community as well as policy makers, with the accumulated benefits of
early treatment in the elderly population that remains at greatest risk of hospitalization
and death from COVID-19. Our cardinal aim therefore given the accumulating evidence,
is a summons to the medical research community for urgent high-quality, trustworthy,
and robust comparative effectiveness research on early treatment in high-risk and
symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients/residents (especially in the nursing home
environment). Having said this, we also implore the medical community to consider that
whilst in the midst of this terrible pandemic, we should not await, nor is there a need to
await the completion of randomized controlled trials. Indeed, based on the data we
present here we would suggest that we are bound ethically to proceed now with
treatment that has been shown to be effective by way of other highly acceptable clinical
study methods.
Results
As a result of our search methods, we found 336 initial reports that were
potentially eligible for our review. However, after applying the scrutiny and stringency of
reference analysis described above we judged that nine (9) studies met our criteria for
inclusion (a result not dissimilar to most systematic reviews that have been published
we might add).3-11 These shed light on the impact of early outpatient sequential

multidrug treatment (SMDT12) in nursing home residents (Table 1). We refer here to
therapeutics that are provided under clinician/health expert/provider supervision and in
a sequenced manner with carefully considered dosing and timing and direct the reader
to Reviews in Cardiovascular Medicine for complete details on the suggested early
outpatient ambulatory SMDT dosing and treatment algorithm with combinations of wellknown, safe, cheap, and effective drugs. These drugs include ivermectin,
hydroxychloroquine, colchicine, azithromycin, doxycycline, and favipiravir (outside the
US), along with inhaled steroids such as budesonide and oral steroids including
dexamethasone and prednisone, and anti-thrombotic anti-clotting drugs such as
heparin12). We also present the relative reduction in mortality risk (Figure 1) where data
from certain selected studies described below allowed such computations.
Bernabeu-Wittel et al. reported from four nursing homes in Spain3 that 272 of 457
(59.5%) residents contracted SARS-CoV-2 of whom 189 (69.5%) were given ‘active
standard care’ and the rest were given advanced palliative care. For patients assigned
to active standard care (i.e. medicalization, see Table 1), survival was measured as
both dichotomous and time-dependent outcomes. The findings demonstrated that 139
(73.5%) of these patients received antiviral treatment: 114 (60%) received
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), 18 (10%) HCQ + lopinavir/ritonavir, 7 (5%) HCQ +
azithromycin (AZM). The investigators reported that survival in the ‘antiviral’ treatment
group was associated independently with receiving any of the antiviral treatments (OR =
28 [5-160]). In addition, 119 (44%) received low molecular weight heparin, 62 (23%)
and also received antimicrobials (e.g. “mild/moderate: oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid,
levofloxacin, or AZM; severe: parenteral ceftriaxone plus levofloxacin (or AZM;
possibility of aspirative origin: oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or parenteral ertapenem”),
and 57 (21%) received systemic corticosteroids. Fewer patients who received active
standard care (i.e. medicalized treatment) died (24 (13%)). The researchers also
reported that the ‘medicalization’ program (as opposed to watchful observation) led to
increased survival in this group, 82% before MP, 96% during MP (p = 0.004). Survival
time in actively treated patients was associated independently with use of any antiviral
treatment. Hospital referrals were also recorded, but for all patients, including those who
did not receive active care; hospitalization significantly decreased with introduction of
the medicalization program (Table 1).
Heras et al. reported on COVID-19 patients from a single nursing home in
Spain.4 This was designed as a retrospective cohort case-controlled analysis. There
were 100 confirmed cases and a medicalization approach to treatment had been carried
out in 83 subjects. It was reported that most, 70%, received HCQ and AZM while others
received variously HCQ alone and in some cases beta-lactam or quinolone antibiotics.
Total survival was 76%, 7 patients were hospitalized, of which 4 died. No statistically
significant improvement in survival was observed for patients who started treatment
within the first 24 hours. Significantly greater risk of mortality was observed for lack of
pharmacological treatment and type of treatment. Of survivors, 81.6% had received
HCQ + AZM, whereas only 33.3% of those who died had received it. Of survivors, 7.9%
had received HCQ alone, while 12.5% of those who died had received it. Of survivors,
10.5% had received ‘no treatment’, which also included beta-lactam or quinolone

antibiotics, while 54.2% of those who died received it. No descriptions of the treatment
for the 7 hospitalized patients were provided. In adjusted models, HCQ + AZM
conveyed a 22.6-fold lower mortality risk, p=.004 (Figure 1) compared to use betalactam or quinolone antibiotics only.
De Spiegeleer and coworkers published outcomes from two Belgian nursing
homes in 20205 to analyze the association between angiotensin converting enzyme
inhibitor (ACEi)/angiotensin receptor antagonist (ARB) and/or statin use with the clinical
outcome of COVID-19 (n=154 COVID-19-positive subjects). Twenty percent were taking
ACEi/ARBs and 20% were taking a statin, while 5% were taking both. Researchers
reported a statistically significant relationship between statin intake and the absence of
symptoms during COVID-19 (OR 2.91, 95% CI 1.27 to 6.71), retaining significance
when adjusted for covariates. Forty-seven percent of 154 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients
remained asymptomatic and 24% had severe disease. The conclusion was that statin
use in such older and vulnerable nursing home residents is associated potentially with a
significant positive effect (better outcome) on COVID-19 clinical symptoms and course.
The authors also reported that “The fact that statin intake is more strongly associated
with asymptomatic status than serious COVID-19 suggests that the potential therapeutic
effects of statins are more outspoken (sic) in the initial stages of COVID-19.”5
Broun et al. reported a retrospective case series involving 14 nursing homes in
the Netherlands (n=101 residents),6 concerning oral anticoagulants and mortality in
nursing home residents with COVID-19. The overall mortality was 47.5% (48 deaths).
Researchers found that anticoagulation was related to non-significant reduction in
mortality based on univariate analysis (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.95, p=0.78) with
adjustment for gender, age, hypertension, and comorbidities.
Ahmad et al. published a report of 52 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive COVID-19
patients7 from three nursing homes in New York. Upon diagnosis, residents were
treated with doxycycline (DOXY) and HCQ. DOXY reportedly acts as a broad-spectrum
inhibitor of MMPs (potentially having a direct action on matrix-metalloproteinasemediated inflammation/tissue damage) and also acts as an antioxidant.13-16 Additionally,
researchers indicate that tetracyclines such as DOXY can impact viral infections via
their direct antibacterial properties as well as via direct antiviral activity, thus capable of
slowing/inhibiting COVID-19 disease progression17 as has also been shown in other
human inflammatory diseases.17,18 Patients were followed for 11 days with treatment
course of 7 days.7 Nine patients did not complete the 7-day therapy, 6 due to
hospitalization, 2 due to death in the nursing home, and 1 due to adverse reaction
(seizure). At the time of publication, of these 9, 3 had died. The remaining patients
completing the course of treatment, were afebrile by at least 5 days after completion,
and either had no more shortness of breath or had returned to previous oxygenation
levels (for patients who had been on oxygen supplementation before contracting
COVID-19). Researchers concluded that treatment with DOXY-HCQ in high-risk
COVID-19 patients was associated with a benefit in clinical recovery, decreased
transfer to hospital and decreased mortality.7 For comparison, the authors also reported
on a nursing home with similar demographics in Washington whose residence did not

receive pharmacological treatment and had 57% hospitalization and 22% mortality, as
compared to 11% and 6% in the study group, respectively.
Ly et al.8 reported on the results of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-based screening
campaigns conducted on dependent elderly residents (compared with staff members) in
long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in Marseille, France, with follow-up of positive cases.
This was a retrospective study of positive residents in 24 nursing homes whereby 226 of
1,691 residents (13.4%) tested positive. In total, 116 (51.4%) patients received courses
of oral HCQ and AZM for ≥ 3 days and these patients otherwise differed little in
comparison to patients who did not receive the treatment. The overall mortality was
20.8%. Mortality was reportedly lower in patients treated with HCQ + AZM for at least 3
days (15.5%) than in those not so treated (26.4%), adjusted OR = 0.37, p = 0.02.
Researchers concluded that the elevated proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19
patients and independent factors for mortality “suggest that early diagnosis and
treatment of COVID-19 patients in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) may be effective in
saving lives”.8
Alam and coworkers 9 conducted a retrospective case-series study in New York
to assess and document clinical outcomes of high-risk COVID-19 LTCF patients (n=89
persons diagnosed March to May 2020). These patients had early intervention with
doxycycline (DOXY) after presenting with moderate to severe symptoms. All 89 had
developed sudden onset of fever, cough, shortness of breath (SOB), and hypoxia.
Treatment with DOXY began within 12 hours of symptom onset, 100 mg bid PO or
intravenous (IV) for seven days and regular standard of care (11 additionally received
broad-spectrum antibiotics). Researchers reported that 85% of patients (n=76) had
clinical recovery, “defined as resolution of fever (average 3.7 days, Coeff = -0.96, p =
0.0001), resolution of SOB (average 4.2 days), and improvement of POX: average 84%
before treatment and average 95% after treatment (84.7 ± 7% vs. 95 ± 2.6%, p =
0.0001). Higher pre- and post-treatment POX is associated with lower mortality (oxygen
saturation (Spo2) vs. Death, Coeff = -0.01, p = 0.023; post-Spo2 vs. Death, Coeff = 0.05, p = 0.0002)”.9 Ten patients died (11%) within 10 days of symptom onset and 3%
were transferred to hospital. Researchers concluded that “early treatment with DOXY
for high-risk patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infections in non-hospital
settings, such as LTCFs, is associated with early clinical recovery, decreased
hospitalization, and decreased mortality”. The data from Alam et al.9 was compared to
similar age groups in New York (Yang et al. 202019) during the same period of the
pandemic in order to calculate the relative risk reduction with DOXY.
Cangiano et al.10 studied mortality of nursing-home COVID-19 patients in Milan,
Italy using an observational study design. These patients, average age 90 years, were
treated in the facility with a standard-of-care multidrug therapy including HCQ,
corticosteroids, and antithrombotics. Of the 98 patients followed, 56 survived and 42
died over the two months of the study. The authors found that mortality was
significantly lower for patients who had previously been on chronic vitamin D
supplementation, and was significantly reduced by COVID-19 treatment with HCQ
(p=.03).

Finally, Leriger et al. (2020)11 followed 233 residents in 11 skilled nursing homes
in Indiana who had tested positive for COVID-19 (113 residents who acted as controls
were selected from the same nursing homes and also followed for 14 days (all testing
positive). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was administered to 105 nursing home residents
(45%). After 2 weeks, 76 (72%) of residents receiving HCQ showed no symptoms, while
9% had symptoms, 2% continued in hospitalized, and 17% had died. The control group
had 58% (66) who were asymptomatic, 13% who had mild symptoms, 1% with
moderate symptoms, 3% hospitalized, and 25% had died. The 2 residents who were
hospitalized in the HCQ group recovered (initially hospitalized for chest
pain/tachycardia) and asymptomatic after 2 weeks. Researchers concluded that the
benefits of HCQ treatment in nursing home residents who are COVID-19 positive, seem
to outweigh the harms in terms of symptom severity and mortality, and particularly so in
residents over 80 years of age and when HCQ was administered before symptoms
began (started early).
Discussion
We found nine reports3-11 supporting the concept of early multidrug
pharmacological intervention can be used to improve clinical outcomes (the most
important being reduction in death) in elderly nursing home residents suffering from
COVID-19. We were focused on a high-risk group that typically worsens before
treatment is administered within an in-patient hospital setting. In essence, the reports
from nursing homes showed that early multidrug interventions including most commonly
two or more intracellular anti-infectives, and before hospitalization, were associated with
overall reductions in mortality of > 60%. These findings, although derived from
independent investigations, were externally consistent and in most instances, clinical
improvements as well as reduced rates of mortality were shown to be statistically
significant and clinically significant. While the reports focused on HCQ and antiinfectives, as indicted in a prior early outpatient SMDT study,12 early treatment can
potentially include other antivirals/anti-infectives, corticosteroids, and antithrombotic/platelet drugs based on clinically valid decision-making. Our data imply that
early medical therapy in addition to several other interventions in nursing homes when
combined could reduce hospitalization rates dramatically and improve survival.
There can be no doubt that the COVID-19 crisis has markedly increased
annualized death rates in nursing home. For example, an Italian observational study
reported a two-month mortality of 40%, compared to 6.4% in the prior year (COVID-19
positive residents (43% increase) and negative residents (24% increase).10 Greater
mortality was associated with being male, older, no previous vitamin D supplementation
and lower “activities of daily living (ADL)” scores,10 leaving researchers to conclude that
there is a greater elderly mortality due to COVID-19.
Similarly, Panagiotou et al. (2020)20 sought to identify risk factors for 30-day allcause mortality among US nursing home residents with COVID-19. The study was
conducted in 351 US nursing homes involving 5256 nursing home residents with

COVID-19–related symptoms who had severe ARDS precipitated by SARS-CoV-2
infection that was confirmed by RT-PCR testing (March to September). The median age
was 79 years (IQR, 69-88 years) and researchers reported that increased age, being
male, and weakened cognitive and physical function among these US nursing home
residents with COVID-19 were independently associated with all-cause 30-day
mortality.
Nursing home staff play a critical role in spreading and potentially containing the
SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. A report from France21 involving 17 nursing homes with 794
staff members confined to the facility along with 1,250 residents were compared with a
national sample of 9,513 facilities with 385,290 staff members and 695,060 residents.
Lower rates of COVID-19 were found among facilities that had staff members live in the
facility as compared to those who lived at home and traveled to the nursing home for
work each day. These findings suggest SARS-CoV-2 is spread from families (living in
the same home) of nursing home workers to the nursing home residents who were in
lockdown. Similarly, Davidson and Szanton (2020)22 called for better management of
nursing home residents in the era of COVID-19 with reductions in overcrowding and
congregate settings. Additionally, researchers23 reported that outbreaks of COVID-19
are associated with the size of the nursing home type facility whereby institutions with >
150 beds will experience a much greater likelihood of transmission of the virus
compared to smaller facilities.
Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 is an essential strategy for evaluating SARS-CoV-2
transmission within nursing homes. Along these lines of greater risk in nursing home
settings, Graham et al. (2020)24 conducted an outbreak investigation of 394 residents
and 70 staff in 4 nursing homes impacted by COVID-19 outbreaks in central
London. The investigation found that 26% of residents died over the two-month period
and all-cause mortality increased by 203% compared to the same period in prior years.
Testing identified 40% of residents as positive for SARS-CoV-2 (43% of them
asymptomatic and 18% had only atypical symptoms with 4% of asymptomatic staff also
testing positive). Similarly, researchers (2020)25 reported very elevated death (33% of
residents (34/101)) from COVID-19 in a long-term care facility in King County,
Washington. After detecting one infected resident late February, by mid March, there
were 167 confirmed cases of COVID-19 involving 101 residents, 50 health care
personnel, and 16 visitors. Researchers reported that hospitalization rates for residents,
visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50%, and 6%, respectively. Similarly, by this time in
March, 30 long-term care facilities were reporting at least one confirmed case of
COVID-19.
Likewise, a recent report on Singapore’s handling of COVID-1926 showed that
residents in nursing homes and long-term care facilities are at greater risk of
transmission and severe illness and deaths. While Singapore’s nursing homes and
long-term care facilities accounted for <0.001% of total COVID-19 cases in April 2020,
they accounted for 14% of all deaths from COVID-19. Arons et al. (2020)27 sought to
assess transmission risk after one case of COVID-19 emerged in a nursing facility in
Washington. They found elevated transmission and death from that single initial case

whereas at 23 days from the initial positive case, 64% of the 89 residents tested
positive, 11 were hospitalized (19%) and 15 died (26%). Approximately 99% of
residents who were evaluated had at least one co-existing condition. A report on the
COVID-19 situation in nursing homes in Hungary28 echoed very similar findings on the
significantly elevated risk of transmission in such settings, estimating that 42% to 57%
of all COVID-19 deaths occurred in nursing homes in European nations such as Italy,
Spain, France, Ireland, and Belgium.
SARS-CoV-2 can spread quickly in nursing homes. A report on the COVID-19 in
England and Wales29 discussed the rapidity at which the infection spreads in such
settings, and it was reported that by the time the first resident developed symptoms,
approximately 50% of the residents had already been infected. The UK Office for
National Statistics (ONS) reported that in April, 72% of deaths in care homes were
related in some way to COVID-19. These findings unlike the SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus
epidemic in 2003,30 indicate that contagion-control methods alone are inadequate for
COVID-19 and immediate treatment is needed to reduce mortality.
Therapeutic Nihilism
Reports from multiple sites in the world indicate that therapeutic nihilism is
practiced with seniors who do not have access to healthcare outside of their facilities.
This is indeed very distressing if there are potential treatment options. It has been
reported that in Quebec, Canada, as of December 2, 2020, 63% of deaths due to
COVID-19 occurred in private and public nursing homes (4,493 of 7,097).31,32 As of
January 9, 2021, it has been reported that in Ontario, Canada, 60% of deaths due to
COVID-19 occurred in private and public nursing homes (approximately 3,000 of nearly
5,000).33 In The Chief Public Health Officer of Canada’s Report on the State of Public
Health in Canada 2020 and looking specifically at COVID-19 in Canada, it was reported
that 80% of all COVID-19 deaths in Canada were associated with nursing homes.34
Importantly and what we are arguing against, is that residents who are ill with COVID-19
are not provided any form of existing safe, simple, and inexpensive therapeutic drugs.31
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)35 recently highlighted the
COVID-19 vulnerability among residents and staff members in LTCFs, and focused
specifically on assisted living facilities (ALFs). LTCFs include ALFs and similar
residential facilities, skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) as well as other nursing homes, and
also include residential facilities for residents with varying degrees of intellectual and
developmental disabilities. As of early November 2020, approximately 91,500 deaths
were reported among residents and staff in LTCFs within the United States,
representing 39% of total state COVID-19 deaths. By mid October 2020 and based on
available ALFs data from 39 US states, among the 28,623 ALFs, 22% reported at least
one COVID-19 case in their staff or residents. In addition, the cases that died comprised
21.2% of the residents and 0.3% of staff. This report made no mention of treatment
provided to staff or residents. A print media report 36 stated that almost 50% of US
COVID-19 deaths were linked to nursing homes. In addition, while the nursing home
death toll was elevated significantly in New York, the deaths in New York’s nursing

homes have been much higher than the state data reported.37 None of these reports
indicate that nursing home patients have been offered any forms of prehospital therapy.
Limitations of This Study
Our report has all the limitations of reviews that extract data from multiple
heterogeneous studies. We did focus on nursing home residents who are usually
weaker and more infirmed that persons living independently in the community, making
our results not applicable to community-dwelling adults. The reporting of early
treatment in COVID-19 patients can be considered nascent and thus the number of
available studies is limited as is their sample sizes. We relied on data presented in
study reports, which in non-randomized studies may be subject to variable degrees of
adjustment for potentially confounding factors. We assumed that the various studies
and their study subjects were sufficiently similar to draw conclusions across them, and
that the care facilities examined in the study reports are typical of such facilities in
general and thus that the treatment benefits that we observed apply to nursing home
and similar care facilities quite generally.
Conclusions
In conclusion, nursing home residents are at the highest risk of death from
SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of COVID-19 illness and they appear to be
the victims of spread from staff who live in the community. The available reports
indicate there is a large > 60% mortality risk reduction associated with multidrug
treatment regimens that utilize two or more intracellular anti-infectives (HCQ and either
AZM or DOXY) combined with other agents including corticosteroids, anti-thrombotics
(anti-platelets), and nutraceuticals of > 60%! 12 There is also recent focus on the antiparasitic ivermectin38-40 as part of early outpatient treatment, functioning as an
antiviral/anti-infective. Ivermectin is less known in the West and is widely prescribed in
Africa and Asia to treat parasitic diseases such as lymphatic filariasis or onchocerciasis
(river blindness). Recent evidence including clinical reports, suggests it may reduce
mortality during treatment of COVID-19, especially in patients with severe pulmonary
involvement. Additionally, favourable evidence is accumulating regarding the potential
anti-viral role of bromhexine hydrochloride (mucolytic cough suppressant that is a
TMPRSS2 inhibitor that may function to block viral entry into the cell) in reducing the
ICU transfer, intubation, and the mortality rate in patients with COVID-19.41,42
We recognize that large randomized, placebo-controlled, multidrug clinical trials
are needed and will provide conclusive evidence in the future on the efficacy of early
treatment of COVID-19. However, based on the reporting and clinical experience, the
early therapeutics that we advocate for such as HCQ, ivermectin, and doxycycline
etc.12,17, 18, 38, 39) may potentially function by working to inhibit viral replication while also
dampening the host innate immune response thereby reducing oxidative stress, matrixmetalloproteinase-mediated inflammation/tissue damage, as well as the production of a
wider array of inflammatory cytokines. In the meantime then and given the dearth of
such randomized evidence that would provide clarification, and given the present

emergency crisis, the observational non-randomized data we reviewed which we judged
as acceptable to informing this report (and in line with expert arguments for
observational study evidence use especially when RCT evidence is not available or is in
many cases, of poor methodological quality),43 suggest a treatment mandate is present
and should replace therapeutic nihilism for nursing home residents with acute COVID19. In addition, observational research evidence is indeed evidence, and is an important
component that also informs evidence-based decision-making. Indeed, the ‘21st
Century Cures Act’44 was passed and specifically section 3022 addresses the use of
observational research as part of medical research. Our goal is to save lives in an
emergency. Furthermore, using a therapeutic outside of its authorized use is well
acceptable if it is safe, used under expert prescribing and supervision, and showing
success as a repurposed treatment in a crisis situation.
There are currently treatments which, applied from the first symptoms of COVID19, have a very reasonable chance of mitigating the severity and duration of the
symptoms, and of reducing the risk of hospitalization, death, or even sequelae. We
have thus concluded that it is not possible to overstate the philosophy that since early
in-center treatment with already available effective, safe, and relatively cheap
medications (repurposed) in nursing homes is associated with a large reduction in
mortality among nursing home residents, there can be no scientifically sound reasons,
nor moral rationale for not utilizing these forms of treatment. In the urgent quest to save
lives and particularly of the elderly nursing home infected resident, we urge clinical trials
and advanced practice to immediately pivot to combination/sequential drug therapy for
ambulatory COVID-19 illness. We urge that doctors be made aware of these treatment
options and discuss them with their patients who are at risk of starting COVID-19, so
that patients are fully informed of the options. The accumulating early treatment
evidence is compelling and deserving of very serious and sober consideration as a
therapeutic option given this emergency and the pressing morbidity and mortality. To do
otherwise is to fail our patients, and to suggest placebo when there is data of favourable
effects of early treatment is becoming more and more problematic to accept.45 We must
never forget that patients have legal rights to be in receipt of effective treatments once
they exist. We ask that you do not discount early treatment without your careful
reflection, debate, and clinical discretion on offering early treatment at this emergency
time period. Senator Ron Johnson of the US Senate held recent hearings to discuss
COVID-19 and the early outpatient treatment option46,47 and we ask that his lead be
followed up urgently given the urgency of the situation.

Researchers concluded that early treatment
with DOXY for high-risk patients with

non-hospital settings, such as LTCFs, is
associated with early clinical recovery,
decreased hospitalization, and decreased
mortality; 85% of patients (n=76) revealed

who had previously been on chronic vitamin D
platelet
supplementation, and was significantly
reduced by COVID-19 treatment with HCQ
(p=0.03, 28 survived vs 5 who died).
HCQ/non-HCQ
After 2 weeks, 76 (72%) of residents receiving
HCQ showed no symptoms, while 9% had
symptoms, 2% continued in hospitalized, and
17% had died; control group had 58% (66)
who were asymptomatic, 13% who had mild
symptoms, 1% with moderate symptoms, 3%
hospitalized, and 25% had died; the benefits
of HCQ treatment in positive nursing home
residents seem to outweigh the harms in
terms of symptom severity and mortality, and
particularly so in residents over 80 years of
age and when HCQ was administered before
symptoms began (started early).
