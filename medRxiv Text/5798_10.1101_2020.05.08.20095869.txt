Novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) has swept the world, and all of the world have been harmful. This article
makes prediction and suggestions for the Italy. Up to March 11, 2020, 2019-nCov thoroughly broke out
in Italy with over 10,000 confirmed cases notwithstanding the gradually block of the country since March
9, 2020. Estimation of possible infection population and prospective suggestion of handling spread based
on exist data are of crucial importance. Considering of the biology parameters obtained based on Chinese
clinical data in Wuhan, other scholars’ work and real spread feature of 2019-nCov in Italy, we built a more
applicable model called SEIJR with log-normal distributed time delay to forecast the trend of spreading.
Adopting Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), we estimated the early period average spreading velocity
(α0 ) and conducted inversion analysis of time point (T0 ) when the virus first hit the Italy. Based on fixed
α0 and T0 , we then obtained the average spreading velocity α1 after the lock by PSO. For the aim of
offering expeditious advice, we generated the prediction trends with different α which we considered
would be helpful in addressing the infection. Not only solved the complex, nondifferentiable equation of
epidemic model, our research also performs well in inversion analysis based on PSO which conveys
informative outcomes for further discussion on precatious action. To conclude, the first day of spread is
around February 1, 2020 with the early period average spreading velocity 𝛼0 =0.330 which is higher than
most cities in China except Wuhan. After locking the country and attaching great attention to public
precaution, the 𝛼1 sharply descended to 0.278, indicting the effectiveness of these measures. Furthermore,
in order to cope the disease before mid-April, take actions to control the under 0.25 is necessary. Code

A global epidemic disease known as the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) had seriously hit the most area
around the whole world causing unpredictable loss of manpower and finance during the first quarter of
2020 [21] [1]. The first confirmed 2019-nCov case was reported in Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019
(World Health Organization, 2020a). As of March 19 (21:00 GMT),2020, 2019-nCov has resulted in 81262
confirmed cases and 3250 dead cased in China cumulatively (National Health Commission of the People’s
Republic of China, 2020). China as the first country faced by the outbreak of the severe disease, it took
strict but effective action to contain the spread of 2019-nCov and attained apparent success till now. [21]
Many related works have been done in prediction and precaution via constructing proper model and
analyzing parameters. [21] [20] [19]
While in the other parts worldwide, the menacing disease just became to spread [7], especially in
countries with no preparation and experienced measures for suppressing the possible large-scale infection.
In this article, we take Italy which is now experiencing severe situation of 2019-nCov as example to
conduct analysis with the aim of offering utilizable suggestion. In the first period (before March 9, 2020),
we attempt to inverse the virus spread timeline in Italy and the early period average spreading velocity by
adopting PSO to optimize the parameters based on our SEIJR model and existing data (European Centre

We collected the daily reported confirmed diagnosed data from the website of European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control (European CDC) . All these data is public for everyone.
Based on the need of our analysis, we preprocessed the data by adding the daily reported confirmed
diagnosed cases to obtain the accumulative amount for following inversion of parameters and prediction.
Here are details about the processed data we used in this article (Table 1).

SEIJR Model

55

Disease transmission is a complex process with multiple variables and uncertainties making it unable to
be accurately solved and predicted [16], [11] [6]. However, models are feasible in forecasting for infectious
diseases when different characteristics parameters [18] [17] like transmission mode, immunization mode,
mortality and average spreading velocity are offered. Classical models for infectious diseases include SIR
model [2] and SEIR model, etc. Considering the actual situation in Italy and the transmission
characteristics of 2019-nCov obtained in China, this paper built the SEIJR model with log-normal
distributed time-delay terms [15] [3]based on the SEIR model [14] [12]. Figure 2 illustrates the SEIJR
model. The model describes the problem by assuming population consists of six types (accumulative
value): susceptible population 𝑆, exposed population 𝐸, infectious population 𝐼, confirmed 𝐽, recovered
population 𝑅 and dead population 𝐷. 𝛼 is average spreading velocity, 𝛽 is diagnose rate, 𝛾1 , 𝛾2 are die
rate and 𝜇 is cure rate. 𝑡 1 (𝑡) is the time of incubation period [5] 𝐸 need to become 𝐼, 𝑡 2 (𝑡) is the time of
waiting period 𝐼 need to become 𝐽 and 𝑡 3 (𝑡) is the duration of hospitalization [5] 𝐽 need to become 𝑅.
𝑆(𝑡), 𝐸 (𝑡), 𝐼 (𝑡), 𝐽 (𝑡), 𝑅(𝑡) and 𝐷 (𝑡) are dependent variables of time 𝑡, respectively. 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝜇 are
constants only related to the actual situation. Time-delay 𝑡1 ,𝑡2 ,𝑡 3 are only depend on time 𝑡, respectively,
which can be written as 𝑡1 (𝑡), 𝑡2 (𝑡) and 𝑡3 (𝑡).

Interpretation

In the model, only 𝐸 and 𝐼 have ability to infect 𝑆 which is a process of contact infection with transient
time. 𝐸 indeed infected but shows no symptoms of 2019-nCov and then transfers to 𝐼 after an incubation
period 𝑡1 . 𝐼 has symptoms like fever, cough and shortness of breath. Because the pre-virus symptoms are
not obvious [5] and the uneven medical facilities in Italy, 𝐼 will be confirmed as 𝐽 after a period 𝑡 2 . Due
to the seriousness and infectivity of the virus, it can be considered that when it becomes 𝐽, 𝐽 will be
immediately isolation and lose its ability of infection. Treatment will be started immediately after
confirmed. 𝐽 will recovery and become 𝑅 after a duration of hospitalization 𝑡3 . Because of the 2019-nCov
has certain lethality, it needs some more assumptions:

The data during the period of 𝐼 is unavailable. We consider that 𝐼 to 𝐷 and 𝐼 to 𝐽 have the same delay
time 𝑡2 which means the only difference between them is proportion;

86

The official organization and medical institutions do not give any information on how long for patients in
the treatment stage will die, but there exists clinical information that for a confirmed patient how long
the patient is needed to be cured [5]. As the same way 𝐽 to 𝑅, 𝐽 to 𝐷 have the same delay time 𝑡3 only
with different proportion.
People in 𝐼 can be diagnosed and receive treatment with 𝛽 diagnose rate. Otherwise, they will die
with the die rate 𝛾1 = 1−. The recover rate for 𝐽 is 𝜇 and the dead rate is 𝛾2 = 1 − 𝜇. The total mortality
proportion is 𝛾 = 𝛾1 + 𝛾2 .

Combining the basic principles of epidemiology and etiology, it can get that the time 𝑡2 from infection to
diagnosis, which approximately follows the log-normal distribution [8]. The assumption can be applied to
𝑡 1 and 𝑡2 without loss of generality. For 𝑡1 , due to the lack of Italian clinical information statistics, it’s
more accurate and reliable to use the clinical data of Zhong NS et.al: the median incubation period is 4
days [5], the quartile is 2 and 7 days. With the log-normal distribution’s formula:

For 𝑡3 , the Italian official organizations and medical institutions still lack clinical information and
official statistics, so we also assumes that 𝑡3 follows the log-normal distribution. However, Zhong NS et.al
gave some relevant data: the duration of hospitalization which is 𝑡 3 , the median is 12 days, and the

, 𝑡 = 0.

For 𝑡2 , the data in Italy is still unavailable, but the relevant distribution function is given in the
Chinese research report. In the paper of Yang ZW et.al, the relevant statistics of ”the time interval
between the most recent stay in Hubei Province and the confirmed diagnosis” are given [4]. The end
point of this period corresponds to the start point of 𝐽 in the SEIJR model, but there is no corresponding
start point. It can only be known that it’s in the middle of the time between 𝑡 1 and 𝑡2 , it is convincing to
regard it as the point when 𝑒 enters 𝐼, which means the time given in that article corresponds to the 𝑡2 in
this article. As the same way, the log-normal density function corresponding to 𝑡 2 is:

Particle Swarm Optimization

132

Usually the epidemic model’s descriptive function was derivative-based without considering time delay or
just assume fixed linear time delay, such as SIR model. In this article, the SEIJR model solved by
combining iteration and degree four Runge-Kutta mentioned before. Accounting for this, the function of
least square method (LSE) employed in addressing this problem for different periods are denoted as
follow:
𝑓1 (𝛼0 , 𝑇0 ) =k 𝐽 𝑝𝑟 𝑒 (𝛼0 , 𝑇0 ) − 𝐽𝑎𝑐𝑡 k2 ,
𝑓2 (𝛼1 ) =k 𝐽 𝑝𝑟 𝑒 (𝛼1 ) − 𝐽𝑎𝑐𝑡 k2

(7)

where 𝑓1 is LSE of the first period. 𝑓2 is LSE of the second period. 𝐽 ∗𝑝𝑟 𝑒1 (𝛼0 , 𝑇0 ), 𝐽𝑎𝑐𝑡 1 are predicted
and actual value from February 22 to March 9, 2020. 𝐽 ∗𝑝𝑟 𝑒2 (𝛼1 ), 𝐽𝑎𝑐𝑡 2 are predicted and actual value
from March 9 to March 25, 2020. Both of them are nonlinear, complex, discontinuous and
nondifferentiable [13]. Traditional method based on derivation is infeasible for minimization. While
approaches such as annealing algorithm [10] to search for parameters is more calculative expensive than
the particle swarm optimization (PSO).
PSO [14] is a population-based search algorithm sparked by the forage behavior of birds within a
flock. Individuals gain the ability of searching for better solution areas by learning the fitness
information from the environment. In PSO algorithm, the velocity of individual is dynamically changed
considering its previous flying experience.
The algorithm consists of three main parts: individual best, global best and individual optimization
based on the best particle of whole population [9]. In this article, 𝑓1 and 𝑓2 are the fitness function
during the first and second period. The main process of conducting this algorithm and basic parameters
are respectively shown in Figure 3 and Table 2.

Discussion

Reliability of SEIJR model

170

It is clearly seen that the fitting curve of 𝐽 in the SEIJR model fits well with the confirmed diagnosis
data of the Italian official statistics. 𝑇0 = 21 represents the initial value of the model which indicates the
first 𝐸 appeared 21 days before February 22 that is February 1. According to the information reported
by the Italian government, the first case in Italy, when 𝐽 appeared, was January 31. Two patients from
Wuhan, China arrived in Italy by air at January 23 and visited other cities in Italy. They finally arrived
in Rome, feeling physical discomfort at January 30 and was confirmed diagnosis then isolated at January
31. It is reasonable to speculate that they had carried the 2019-nCov in Wuhan before arriving in Italy in
January 23, and continued to spread in Italy for eight days after January 23 until January 31. The first
case of 𝐸 reported in official data appeared at January 23, and the model’s conclusion appeared at
February 1. In fact, because the two senior travelers are 67 and 66 years old with poor mobility,
unfamiliar surroundings and the simple factors of interpersonal relationships, they have a lower 𝛼 which
also leads to real initial time point is earlier than the initial time point of the theoretical model. To sum
up, the model has higher accuracy and stronger credibility. [11]

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte extended the quarantine lockdown to cover all the region of Lombardy
and 14 other northern provinces on March 8, and all region on March 10. At the same time, the Italian
government further banned rallies and sports activities nationwide, announced a national blockade, and
unnecessarily stopped going out. Compared the average spread velocity 𝛼1 = 0.278 with 𝛼0 = 0.330 at the
early stage(before March 9, 2020), a decrease existed after the series of actions which verifies the
effectiveness of this measure.

According to the model’s prediction, when 𝛼 is in a suitable range, the number of confirmed patients will
gradually decrease. It is obvious that the smaller the value of 𝛼 is, the faster the number of confirmed
diagnoses decreases. Since Italian government hopes to end the 2019-nCov by mid-April, it can control 𝛼
around 0.25 according to the prediction of the model. Based on this conclusion, Italy government is
supposed to strengthen the isolation, reduce gathering activities and make people understand the
importance of precautionary measures to constrain 𝛼 under 0.25.

Conclusion

198

Applying PSO to our SEIJR model with log-normal distributed time delay, we obtained the convincing
start time (around February 1, 2020) of 2019-nCov and the average spreading velocity (𝛼0 =0.330) at the
early stage. We compared the average spreading velocity during the early period and following period, a
conspicuous decrease attributed to the effective measures was found. Based on the prediction interval of
possible infected population of different 𝛼, we strongly recommend Italy to keep 𝛼 under 0.25 if they
want the situation take a turn for the better even ended before mid-April.
