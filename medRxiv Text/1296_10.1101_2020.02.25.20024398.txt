In late December 2019, Chinese authorities reported a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown
aetiology in Wuhan, China1. A novel strain of coronavirus named Severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was isolated and identified on 2 January 2020 2.
Human-to-human transmission have been confirmed by a study of a family cluster and have
occurred in health-care workers

3,4

. Until 10 February 2020, 42638 cases of 2019 novel

coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been confirmed in China, of which 31728 came from
Hubei Province (Figure). Wenzhou, as a southeast coastal city with the most cases outside
Hubei Province, its policy control and epidemic projections have certain references for national
and worldwide epidemic prevention and control. We described the epidemiologic characteristics
of COVID-19 in Wenzhou and made a transmission model to predict the expected number of
cases in the coming days.
Methods
In this epidemiologic and modelling study, we first gathered transmission data for 434 confirmed
COVID-19 patients in the ongoing Wenzhou outbreak from the the National Health Commission
of the People’s Republic of China and the Health Commission of Wenzhou by February 10,
2020. We then investigate a deterministic (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) SEIR
compartmental model based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of
the individuals, and the intervention measures to inferred the basic reproductive number of
SARS-CoV-2 and the transmission among Wenzhou and three prefecture-level cities. Finally,
we forecasted and compared the spread of SARS-CoV-2 across Wenzhou (Southeastern),
Shenzhen (Southern), Zhengzhou (Central) and Harbin (Northern), accounting for the effect of
the Wenzhou quarantine implemented since Jan 27, 2020 and other interventions. see

A total of 434 incidence, 31 severe case, 99 hospital discharges and 5304 probable COVID-19
cases were reported before February 10, 2020, and 168 patients who visited Wuhan after the
onset of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. The median age of persons with COVID-19 was 47 years;
48 cases (11.1%) occurred in persons 65 years of age or older, and 5 (1.2%) were in children
younger than 15 years of age (Table). The maximum number of illness onset in Wenzhou
appeared on January 26 (38 cases). Since January 27, the incidence per day in Wenzhou has
continued to decline is likely to be due to isolation of people return to Wenzhou, implementation
of region quarantine and suspension of public transportation system. Under the current control
efforts, we estimate that the daily incidence by March 3-9, 2020 will drop to 0 in Wenzhou using
SEIR model. The total number of affected people is 538 (95% CI: 534-542). Estimated of the
basic reproduction numbers, R0, were 2.91 (95% CI: 2.35-3.57) for Wenzhou, 2.53 (95% CI,
1.86 to 3.34) for Shenzhen, 5.95 (95% CI, 5.36 to 6.67) for Zhengzhou, and 3.35 (95% CI, 3.07
to 3.68) for Harbin. Figure shows the trajectories of the epidemic for Wenzhou, Shenzhen,
Zhengzhou and Harbin. We classified these cities to Input-Burst, Input-Control, ControlRelaxation and Control-Missing based on epidemic dynamics and control measures. We found
that the epidemic in Wenzhou was composed of outsiders (people with a visit history to Hubei)
and local people, while the epidemic in Shenzhen was mainly composed of outsiders. Under
strict implemented control measures, epidemic gradually subsided in both Wenzhou and
Shenzhen.
Discussion
Although the current epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 in China is unprecedented in scale, clinical
presentations greatly resemble SARS-CoV. The higher number of infections may be due to the
late identification of pathogens, the host's ability to hide infection symptoms and high transport
capacity of China. As we known, estimate of epidemic dynamics and predictions are of crucial
importance for public health planning and control measurement

. In this study, we provide an

assessment of the transmission dynamics and predictions of the future spread of COVID-19

among four cities. Forward projections suggest that the Wenzhou and Shenzhen epidemic will
end before Zhengzhou and Harbin, which result from substantial and draconian measures that
limit population movements and drastically reduce within-population contact rates, such as
greater community engagement, cancellation group gatherings, school closures, and work-fromhome arrangements.
