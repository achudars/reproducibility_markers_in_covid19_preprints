ABSTRACT
Introduction
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the
name given to the 2019 novel coronavirus. COVID-19 is the name given to
the disease associated with the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of
coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans.

Methods
Two key factors were analysed which when multiplied together would give an
estimate of relative demand on healthcare utilisation. These factors were case
incidence and case morbidity.
GP Practice data was used as this provided the most geographically granular
source of published public population data. To analyse case incidence, the
latest values for indicators that could be associated with infection transmission
rates were collected from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and Quality
Outcome Framework (QOF) sources. These included population density, %
age >16 at fulltime work/education, % age over 60, % BME ethnicity, social
deprivation as IMD 2019, Location as latitude/longitude, and patient
engagement as % self-confident in their own long term condition
management.
Average case morbidity was calculated by applying the international mortality
Odds Ratio to the local population relevant age and disease prevalences and
then summing and dividing by the equivalent national figure. To provide a
comparative measure of overall healthcare resource impact, individual GP
practice impact scores were compared against the median practice.

Results
The case incidence regression is a dynamic situation with the significance of
specific factors moderating over time as the balance between external
infection, community transmission and impact of mitigation measures feeds
through to the number of cases. It showed that currently Urban, % Working
and age >60 were the strongest determinants of case incidence.
The local population comorbidity remains unchanged. The range of relative
HC impact was wide with 80% of practices falling between 20%-250% of the
national median.

Once practice population numbers were included it showed that the top 33%
of GP practices supporting 45% of the patient population would require 68%
of COVID-19 healthcare resources. The model provides useful information
about the relative impact of Covid-19 on healthcare workload at GP practice
granularity in all parts of England.

Conclusion
Covid-19 is impacting on the utilisation of health and social care resources
across the country. This model provides a method for predicting relative local
levels of disease burden based on defined criteria and thereby providing a
method for targeting limited (and perhaps soon to be scarce) care resources
to optimise national, regional and local responses to the COVID-19 outbreak..

Introduction
This coronavirus, first detected in China in 2019, is genetically closely related
to the SARS-CoV-1 virus. SARS emerged at the end of 2002 in China, and it
caused more than 8000 cases in 33 countries over eight months. Around one
in ten of the people who developed SARS died1.
At the date of the submission of this article, the COVID-19 outbreak has
caused a total of around 142 539 confirmed (9769 new) cases reported
globally with around 1200 in the UK alone. Of these proven cases, around
5393 deaths have been reported due to the virus (around 3.8% mortality
rate).2 Unlike influenza, there is no vaccine and no specific treatment for the
disease.
The implications for countries are that there is likely to be unprecedented
demands on all aspects of health and social care resources. In the UK
emergency planning is well underway although a key challenge is the capacity
of secondary care to manage admissions of unwell patients and of primary
care (GP practices) to manage those who not requiring hospital admission.3
During an outbreak, decision-makers face surges in resource demand which
require resource prioritisation and re-allocation4. Predicting areas of greater
need is therefore critical to optimise the value of limited resources and funding
in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Response to infectious diseases are carried out in different phases, the
Government has recently under the advice of Public Health England moved
the disease from containment strategy to delay strategy where slowing the
onward transmission rate is the priority. Later stages might require other
strategy changes.
This paper describes the development of a resource allocation prediction
model for COVID-19 based on a regression analysis of published case rates
in England across upper-tier local authority areas (UTLA) against key local
population metrics aggregated up from local GP practices.
It is worth noting that these published case numbers are only those that have
tested positive either from existing patient contacts or sufficiently symptomatic
to be triaged to healthcare services. Around 3% of those tested show positive
results, while it is estimated that unreported cases could be more than 20
times higher than reported, however the latter remain the only marker for local

levels of the condition. The situation is also changing on a real-time basis as
the case number grow and moves from initial infection to community
transmission, and the mitigation measures start to work through.

Methods
Two key factors were analysed which when multiplied together would give an
estimate of relative demand on healthcare utilisation. These factors were case
incidence and case morbidity. GP Practice data was used as this provided the
most geographically granular source of published public population data. To
analyse case incidence, the latest values for indicators that could be
associated with infection transmission rates were collected from the Office of
National Statistics (ONS) and Quality Outcome Framework (QOF) sources.
These local factors included population density, % age >16 at fulltime
work/education, % age over 60, % BME ethnicity, social deprivation as IMD
2019, Location as latitude and longitude, and patient engagement level as %
self-confident in their own long-term condition management.
A dataset was then created by aggregating GP practice data within each
UTLA. A stepwise regression analysis was then performed linking these
metrics against the latest number of identified cases of COVID-19 in each
UTLA area as published by Public Health England5 divided by the total
population. The factors are inter-related and the total number of factors was
kept small while maximising the model variation capture

cases/population, this was divided by the same calculation using national

Relative case morbidity was calculated by applying the published Odds Ratio
(OR)6 analysis for international COVID data on mortality by the local GP
practice population percentage prevalence for patient age groups, along with
comorbidities including diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) and cancer, and then divide by the same
calculated value using national average values to give a relative practice
relative case morbidity for Covid-19 infection.

Multiplying the practice relative incidence rate by practice relative case
morbidity gave the relative practice health care resource impact /patient to the
national median. Multiplying this by practice population size divided by the
national median practice size gave the total health care resource prediction
relative to the median practice.

Results
The situation is very dynamic and fluid with the number of cases being
published daily, the first publication on 8th March 2020 gave 224 cases in 74
UTLAs. The chosen factors and their significance within the statistical model
are also changing with time.
The current regression model data was updated on the date of submission of
this paper (16.03.2020) from 149 UTLAs of which 136 had recorded one or
more out of a total of 1,421 cases in England. The analysis of COVID-19
incidence of infection showed significant positive relation to three key factors:
population density, % of the >16 population in full-time at work/education, and
% of the population over 60 (r2=0.45 and all p-values<0.05).

population.

The relative accuracy of the model can be seen in Figure 1 where the model
and actual outcomes of cases/population for each UTLA are divided into 3
terciles. 50% of model’s values fall in the same tercile as the actual, 41% in
an adjacent tercile, 9% with 2 tercile difference. (If a model contained no link
these values would be 33%, 45%, 22%, respectively).
The application of the extrapolation using regression coefficients and OR
combined with each practice’s actual population characteristics show a wide
variation in expected cases and overall local morbidity. Combining these two
gives a measure of overall expected COVID healthcare resource impact, and
this divided by the median GP practice value to give a relative. In figure 1

below, the median practice is shown as 100% of relative healthcare impact,
with the highest 10% of GP practices >210% and lowest 10% having <15% of
the median. It was multiplied by the relative practice population number and
summed cumulatively to show the top 33% of GP practices supporting 45% of
the patient population would require 68% of COVID-19 healthcare resources.
Specific practices at risk can be identified by their position on these curves.
The authors note that two additional datasets, if and when available, could
enhance the predictive capability of the model: local total number of tests and
split of tests by numbers and result by known associate or community to give
estimates for the level of non-detected, self-managed, populations.
The model both in factor inclusion and resulting values will have to be
adjusted on an ongoing basis as the epidemic goes through the recognised
infection phases

Conclusion
The COVID19 outbreak is rapidly impacting on the utilisation of health and
social care resources across the country. Linking local case data to local
population characteristics provides a method to estimate the difference in
expected levels of disease between different populations at the required
levels
The factors identified as relevant in the current regression model align with
the current strategy of increasing work from home and closing education and
reducing social contact especially among older people which should reduce
transmission rates. As the situation develops, the transmission drivers will
modulate and as further data is available the model can be reviewed, evolved,
updated and reissued.
This model provides a method for predicting relative local levels of disease
burden based on defined criteria and thereby providing a method for targeting
limited (and perhaps soon to be scarce) care resources to optimise national,
regional and local responses to the COVID-19 outbreak. We hope that our
model will aid precious resource allocation at this very challenging time.
