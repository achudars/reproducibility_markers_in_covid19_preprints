Research in context
Evidence before this study
The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is now a global pandemic.
Cancer patients are at risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, and thus infection control
measures are crucial to mitigate their risk of infection. We searched PubMed
and Medline for articles published up to Mar 12, 2020, using the following
keywords: “COVID-19”, “SARS”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “infection control”, and
“cancer”. No evidence exists that informs on the appropriate infection control
measures for COVID-19.
Added value of this study
We report our single centre experience on the detailed infection control
measures that were undertaken to minimise cross transmission between
cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy, and between patients and healthcare
workers. Measures entailing screening of suspect cases, re-organisation of the
treatment facility, and protection of healthcare workers were described. With
our infection control protocol, we recorded only one COVID-19 case among
the 209 patients (0.48%) who were treated at our centre during the period of
Jan 20 to Mar 6, 2020. No healthcare worker was affected.
Implications of all the available evidence
The effective infection control measures outlined in this study will help
institutions worldwide affected by COVID-19 to formulate guidelines to mitigate
nosocomial human-to-human transmission, especially among susceptible
patients.

Abstract (296 words)
Background
A pandemic of 2019 novel corona virus disease (COVID-19), which was first
reported in Wuhan city, has affected more than 100,000 patients worldwide.
Patients with cancer are at a higher risk of COVID-19, but currently, there is no
guidance on the management of cancer patients during this outbreak. Here,
we report the infection control measures and early outcomes of patients who
received radiotherapy (RT) at a tertiary cancer centre in Wuhan.
Methods
We reviewed all patients who were treated at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan
University (ZHWU) from Jan 20 to Mar 6, 2020. This preceded the city
lock-down date of Jan 23, 2020. Infection control measures were implemented,
which included a clinical pathway for managing suspect COVID-19 cases,
on-site screening, modifications to the RT facility, and protection of healthcare
workers. Primary end-point was infection rate among patients and healthcare
staff. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the 5th edition criteria.
Findings
209 patients completed RT during the study period. Median age was 55 y (IQR
= 48-64). Thoracic, head and neck, and lower gastrointestinal and
gynaecological cancer patients consisted the majority of patients. Treatment
sites included thoracic (38.3%), head and neck (25.4%), and abdomen and
pelvis (25.8%); 47.4%, 27.3%, and 25.4% of treatments were for adjuvant,
radical, and palliative indications, respectively. 188 treatments/day were
performed prior to the lock-down, in contrast to 12.4 treatments/day
post-lock-down. Only one (0.48%) patient was diagnosed with COVID-19
during the study period. No healthcare worker was infected.

Introduction
Globally, there is an unprecedented outbreak of acute respiratory illness,
named 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is caused by a
severe adult respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).1,2 Wuhan
was the virus epicentre where SARS-CoV-2 first emerged, but rapidly, this has
become a pandemic affecting nearly 90 countries worldwide. As of Mar 12,
2020, a total of 80,981 confirmed cases and 3,173 death cases have been
reported in China, of which an overwhelming majority was from Wuhan city
and Hubei province. Due to the rapid human-to-human transmission and the
potential severity of COVID-19, hospitals from the outbreak areas have been
severly affected by the overload of infected patients, which has led to the
suspension of several healthcare services.
For cancer patients, a delay of diagnosis and treatment can be
detrimental to survival.3 However, cancer patients are also at risk of
SAR-CoV-2 infection, as reported by two case series from China, which may
be attributed to immunosuppressive treatments and recurrent visits to the
hospital.4,5 Thus, robust infection control measures are necessary to mitigate
the risk of contracting COVID-19 in cancer patients.
Radiotherapy (RT) constitutes a primary modality for the treatment of
cancer, with approximately 50% of all cancer patients requiring RT during their
cancer journey.6 Often, it is used as a definitive or adjuvant modality, and in
patients with disseminated systemic disease, RT is effective for palliating
symptoms. It is therefore imperative that RT services are not affected during
this outbreak. Here, we report our experience and preliminary outcomes of 209
RT patients, who were treated at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University
(ZHWU) during the period when the city was locked down on Jan 23, 2020.

Methods
Patient cohort
All patients who were treated at the Department of Medical and Radiation
Oncology, ZHWU, from Jan 20 to Mar 6, 2020 were included in this study. The
start-date of the study period preceded the commencement of the lock-down of
Wuhan city on Jan 23, 2020. Patient’s demographics, medical history, contact
history, clinical symptoms and examination, haematological and biochemical
investigations, and results of the computed tomography (CT) of the chest were
obtained. Data cut-off date for the study was Mar 6, 2020. This study was
approved by the institutional review board of ZHWU (2020039). As aggregated,
anonymised patient data was used in this study, waiver of consent was
approved by the ethics committee.

Infection control measures
The workflow for screening of both hospitalised and non-hospitalised patients
is outlined in Figure 1. Identification of suspect cases with COVID-19 infection
was the first crucial step in infection control. In this regard, routine
pre-screening of the patient and family members should be performed. Daily
screening of a constellation of clinical symptoms included: 1) body
temperature of

൒37.3°C;

2) presence of fatigue, respiratory symptoms, or

gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain etc.); and 3) a contact
history with SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. If patients recorded any of the
above symptoms, we would refer them to a comprehensive set of
investigations, including a CT chest using our departmental scanner
(Sensation Cardiac 64x, Siemens, Germany) and laboratory work-up,
comprising of a complete blood count and biochemical analyses (coagulation
profile, hepatic and renal function, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive
protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase). Of note,

the characteristic CT change of COVID-19 pneumonia is the presence of
ground-glass changes in the outer zone of one or both lungs. This method of
diagnosis for COVID-19 is considered more reliable than the SARS-CoV-2
real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay,
since CT manifestations tend to appear earlier than nucleic acid detection.7
If either the CT or laboratory results were abnormal, the suspect cases
would then be sent to the outpatient fever clinic for further assessment. Throat
swab samples would be collected and tested using the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR
assay. While waiting for the outcome of the RT-PCR test, patients would be
quarantined in a dedicated area within the hospital compound to mitigate the
risk of nosocomial spread. Contact, droplet and airborne precautions were
undertaken for the suspect cases. In the event of a positive RT-PCR result or
highly suspicious CT findings, patients would be transported to a designated
infectious disease hospital for isolation, observation, and treatment. For
patients with normal results, they will be admitted to the hospital for RT or
receive RT as an outpatient.

On-site screening
We employed the following workflow to screen all patients and health-care
workers (nurses, radiation therapists, physicists ,physicians and paramedics):
1) All people entering the treatment area must record a body temperature of

℃ prior to entry; 2) they would be screened again for contact

less than 37.3

history; 3) they must don a three-ply surgical mask at all times; and 4) strict
hand hygiene must be practised.

Infection control measures at the RT treatment unit
Patient holding area should be well-ventilated. Central air conditioning in the
treatment area was not permitted. The treatment devices in close contact with

the

disinfected

after

every

patient,

while

patient-specific treatment gadgets (e.g. thermoplastic shells, VacLoks etc.)
were returned to the respective position after each treatment to avoid contact
contamination.
Next, to avoid overcrowding, treatment timings were staggered such that
number of patients was limited to two for every 30-40 min time-slot. Strict
distancing of at least 1.5 m apart was ensured, and patients were not allowed
to communicate with each another. Finally, daily disinfection measures
(cleaning and sterilisation of all surfaces, including seats, tables, floors and
walls of the waiting hall) were performed for the entire treatment facility. The
detailed patient flow and floor plan of the treatment facility is illustrated in
Figure 2.

Protection of health-care workers
Given the risk of COVID-19 pneumonia to frontline medical staff, the following
measures were implemented to mitigate the risk of cross-infection from
patients to healthcare workers: 1) a buddy system to expedite the notification
of unwell team members who harboured symptoms of fever, fatigue and dry
cough, or who had a positive contact history with a COVID-19 patient; 2) twice
daily temperature monitoring of all staff; 3) all staff members who were
involved in transfer and delivery of treatment for patients had to don protective
gear comprising of disposable surgical caps, gowns, N95 masks, face screens,
double-layered gloves, and shoe covers; 4) radiation therapists were split into
two-man teams at any point in time, along with optimisation of processes for
patient set-up and treatment delivery to reduce cross infection; 5) protective
gear should be disposed of in a medical hazard waste bag; 6) strict hand
hygiene before leaving the treatment area; 7) team gatherings during work
were prohibited; and 8) finally, social distancing was encouraged to prevent
transmission to family members.

Results
Patient characteristics
From Jan 20, 2020 to Mar 6, 2020, 209 patients were treated at our RT facility.
Table 1 summarises the clinical characteristics of patients and their treatment
details. Median age of patients was 55 y (IQR = 48-64). Gender was evenly
distributed. Thoracic cancers (N = 80 [38.3%], including lung, breast, and
oesophageal cancers), head and neck cancers (N = 53 [25.4%]), and lower
gastrointestinal and gynaecological cancers (N = 54 [25.8%]) comprised the
majority of the study cohort. Of these, 172 (82.3%) were inpatients, while 37
patients (17.7%) communted daily for treatment.

RT treatment details
Among 209 patients, 47.4% received adjuvant RT, while 27.3% and 25.3% of
treatments were for radical and palliative intent, respectively. All patients had
already commenced treatment prior to the study start-date. Figure 3 shows
the number of treated patients per day over the duration of the study. Prior to
the lock-down, mean number of patients per day was 188 (range = 160-209).
However, these numbers sharply declined on and immediately after the date of
lock-down, and declined with subsequent weeks (mean number of patients per
day = 12.4; range = 2-66).

Outcomes
As of Mar 6, 2020, we recorded only one case (0.48%) of newly-diagnosed
COVID-19 pneumonia. This patient completed treatment on Jan 23, 2020, and
was confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection on Jan 26, 2020. Of the 209
patients, 70 were deemed to have a contact history with the COVID-19 patient;
none of these patients developed clinical symptoms of COVID-19, and both CT

and RT-PCR screening investigations were negative. Among them, 52 patients
were not able to return for RT post-lock-down, while 18 patients continued to
undergo RT without delay. Nonetheless, treatments for these patients were
re-scheduled to the end of the day.
Finally, no medical staff was infected during the study period. All patients,
including the COVID-19 case, remained alive as of Mar 12, 2020.

Discussion
The outbreak of a novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to an unprecedented rapid
spike in COVID-19 pneumonia cases globally. To date, more than 100,000
humans have been infected, and the numbers are likely to increase. Perhaps
among the natural history of this virus infection, the predominant characteristic
of SARS-CoV-2 is its remarkably high infectivity potential, where an infected
individual can spread the virus to two to three other individuals when in close
proximity.8 While large-scale epidemiological studies from China have
suggested that young and elderly individuals are equally susceptible to
COVID-19,9 it has also been shown that the latter subgroup, as well as
patients with co-morbidities like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
cardiac conditions are more likely to succumb to severe illness.10 Hence, there
is a real concern about the impact of COVID-19 in patients with cancer. To date,
two case series have identified that patients with cancer habour an
approximately two-fold increased risk of COVID-19, and reasons underpinning
these observations include older patients, immunosuppressive therapies, and
recurrent hospital visitations.5,11 Robust infection control measures are
therefore crucial to prevent cross-transmission between patients and between
patient and healthcare workers within the compounds of a cancer centre.
Herein, we shared our single institution experience in the management of
cancer patients undergoing RT from a cancer centre that was based in Wuhan,
where the outbreak first started. Our infection control protocol was
comprehensive, covering a stepwise clinical pathway to manage suspect
cases

(questionaire,

CT,

and

RT-PCR

assays),

on-site

screening,

re-organisation of the RT facility, and protection of healthcare workers. The
extremely low rates of infection among our patients (0.48%) and healthcare
workers (0%) were a testament to the efficacy of our measures.
Notably, one patient who was treated in our RT facility became infected

with SARS-CoV-2 on Jan 26, 2020 (3 days after the lock-down). We were able
to establish a contact history with 70 other patients over the preceding 14-day
window. Amazingly, none of the patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia on
follow-up, which again highlights the effectiveness of our infection control
protocol. Unfortunately, due to the lock-down, only 18 of these patients were
able to resume RT, as the remaining 52 patients were not allowed to return to
the city.
Some limitations of this study deserve mention. First, it is apparent that
the number of patients decreased substantially following the lock-down (a
10-fold drop in case-load; Figure 3). While it is unknown if such a meticulous
protocol would be applicable in high-volume cancer centres from other parts of
the world, reduction of case-load constitutes a key step of limiting
human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and thus, patients’ treatment
ought to be prioritised accordingly. Finally, it is important to assess the impact
on the long-term prognosis of these cancer patients, especially for those
individuals who were unable to resume their treatment, which is the undesired
consequence of a lock-down and robust infection control measures.

Conclusions
To conclude, we described infectious control measures that were undertaken
to prevent human-to-human transmission among patients with cancer
undergoing RT and healthcare workers. The early result of a 0.48% infection
rate validates the effectiveness of our protocol. Longer-term follow-up will
inform on the implications of this pandemic on the survival outcomes of cancer
patients.

Figure legends
Figure 1. Clinical pathway for screening of suspect COVID-19 cases for
patients with cancer undergoing radiotherapy. A three-step approach was
adopted to escalate investigations for suspect cases. We established a fever
clinic to consult patients with a suspicious CT and laboratory investigations.
Patients with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, ascertained by either abnormal
CT or RT-PCR test will be transferred to a dedicated facility for isolation and
treatment. Abbreviations: CT, computed tomography; SARS-CoV-2, severe
adult respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus 2; RT-PCR, real-time reverse
transcripton polymerase chain reaction; COVID-19, 2019 novel coronavirus
disease.
Figure 2. Layout of the radiotherapy centre at the Zhongnan Hospital of
Wuhan University. The facility was re-orgnised to accommodate an on-site
screening platform and a spacious patient holding area. Distancing between
patients was ensured to minimise contact. We also dermacated fixed entry and
exit points for patient flow through the radiotherapy facility. Floor plan not
drawn to scale.
Figure 3. Radiotherapy case-load per day during the outbreak of
COVID-19 in our department. Number of patients dropped substantially after
the lock-down of the city, and declined by each week. The reduced case-load
was also partly due to the restriction of admitting new cancer patients to the
hospital.
