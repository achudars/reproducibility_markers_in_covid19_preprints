Abstract
The Eyring’s rate process theory and free volume concept, two very popular theories in chemistry
and physics fields, are employed to treat infectious disease transmissions. The susceptible individuals are assumed to move stochastically from one place to another. The virus particle transmission
rate is assumed to obey the Eyring’s rate process theory and also controlled by how much free
volume available in a system. The transmission process is considered to be a sequential chemical
reaction, and the concentrations or fractions of four epidemiological compartments, the susceptible,
the exposed, the infected, and the removed, can be derived and calculated. The obtained equations
show that the basic reproduction number, R0 , is not a constant, dependent on the volume fraction of virus particles, virus particle size, and virus particle packing structure, the energy barrier
associated with susceptible individuals, and environment temperature. The developed models are
applied to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) transmission and make predictions on peak
time, peak infected, and R0 . Our work provides a simple and straightforward approach to estimate
how infection diseases evolve and how many people may be infected.

INTRODUCTION

Infectious diseases occur frequently within last twenty years.
(Severe Acute Respiratory

The 2003 SARS

Syndrome), 2009 influenza A (H1N 1), 2013 ebola virus,

and current coronavirus inflected pneumonia (Covid − 19) are among the deadliest and have
posed a strong impact on human lives and activities. Mathematical modeling and analysis
of infectious disease transmissions1–7 have been performed for a century. Its importance in
understanding infectious disease transmissions and developing practical strategies for disease
control and mitigation have been demonstrated. Challenges remain in difficult descriptions
of human contact patterns and virus evolution, due to randomness of human interactions and
unpredictability of virus growth especially for a new type of virus. The problems encountered
in disease transmission area are similar to many-body problems encountered in chemistry
and physics fields, where many entities like electrons, atoms, molecules, or nano-sized even
micro-sized particles interact each other in a disordered manner.
The Eyring’ rate process theory8 and free volume concept9–13 have been employed to solve
many-body problems without involving complicated quantum mechanical calculations. The
Eyring’s rate process theory, originated from quantum mechanics, argues that every physical
or chemical phenomenon is a rate controlled process, such as chemical reactions, electron
transfer, conductivity, viscous flows, diffusions, etc. Every process needs an activated energy
to move from the initial state to the final state. Free volume theory, originated from molecular systems, is a most successful mean field theory in dealing with many-body problems.
All different kinds of interactions among entities are factored into a single term, the free
volume available in a system. Since the free volume theory resolves how large freedom an
entity may have and the Eyring’s rate process theory describes how fast the process is, these
two theories have been integrated together to describe many seemingly unrelated systems
or phenomena like glass liquids12 , colloids and polymers14,15 , granules16–18 , electrical and
proton conductivity19,20 , superconductivity21 , and Hall Effect22 with great success.
In this article, we will utilize the Eyring’s rate process theory and free volume concept to describe infectious disease transmission process.

ods proposed in the literature1–7 to develop our theory. The difference between these two
models can be found in literature4 . SEIR model can give more information like latency
period. Each category will be treated as a “chemical reactant”. Its concentration or fraction
expressed in the number of individuals in each segment divided by the total population in
consideration will be estimated for unveiling disease transmission mechanisms and predicting
peak time and peak infected population.

THEORY

Considering that some of the recovered individuals may be infected again, we therefore
add a backward reaction in the last step of the sequential chemical reaction. The whole
infection process can be expressed as below:
k

S →1 I

M SIR :

k2
0

R

k2

M SEIR :

k

k

S →3 E →4 I

k5

R

k5

The only difference between SIR and SEIR models is the initial step: SIR model assumes
that the susceptible will directly transform into the infected, while SEIR model assumes that
there is an intermediate state “exposed”. For avoiding confusion with traditional SIR and
SEIR models, we will call our modified versions as MSIR and MSEIR in this article. The key
0

is how to theoretically determine chemical reaction rate constants like k1 , k2 , k2 , k3 , k4 , k5 , k5
expressed in two chemical reactions shown above. Once these parameters are known, the
fractions of S, E, I, R can be predicted. The first step in MSIR model and the second and
third steps in MSEIR model are one way irreversible chemical reactions. The last step in

both MSIR and MSEIR models are reversible. Note that both k2 and k5 should be very
small and the initial fraction of the recovered should be small too, leading to a negligible
contribution to the infected pool.
For the first step reaction, assume that susceptible individuals move randomly and become “exposed” first. The virus particles then transmit from one individual to another.
This individual thus becomes “infected”. So in MSIR model, there should be two steps
involved during the process from ”S” to ”I”: the individual movement and virus particle

movement. Human movement is a stochastic random process and should be similar to the
movements of atoms, molecules, colloidal particles, and even granular powders, which have
been studied extensively. Someone may argue that human movement is an athermal process, while atomic, molecular, and colloidal particle movements are thermal driven. For
athermal granular powder under a tapping process, we theoretically found that they behave
like thermal systems and follow the stretched exponential pattern in term of tap density
changing with the number of taps16 . Our approach is mainly based on Theodor Förster’s
theory23,24 that deals with the energy transfer from donors to random distributed acceptors.
Theodor Förster’s theory involves a very complicated quantum mechanical treatment but its
mathematical backbone was simplified and extracted by Blumen25 and Klasfter26 . Detailed
information can be found in my previous article16 . Furthermore, human collective motion
and individual walking behaviors of animals were found to behave like thermal systems and
follow Boltzmann distribution, though the temperature needs to be defined differently in
these athermal systems27,28 . Utilizing the same approach to treat “human movements” in
disease transmissions, we may write the reaction constant as16 :
k3 = Ap[exp −(

Ea β
) ]
w

(1)

where A and p are constant, β is stretched exponential parameter of values between 0 and
1, Ea is the energy barrier for a human to move around, and w is the basic energy that a
person may need during a normal circumstance.

After an individual is exposed, the transmission of virus particles from one person to
another will make an “exposed” person become “infected”. This process will be dependent
on the free volume available for virus particles to travel and how fast these virus particles
will travel. It should be similar to the viscosity or conductivity of an entity that has been
addressed in many systems in my previous articles12,14,19,20,29 . The free volume can be estimated with inter-particle spacing concept14,30 . For infectious diseases, more free volume for
both human and virus particles means “isolation” and less transmission. High virus particle
volume fractions mean higher transmissions, which is similar to viscosity of colloidal suspensions or granular powders. Therefore the chemical reaction rate should be proportional
to the “viscosity” of this entity, then k4 can be written as29 :

where V is the volume in consideration, r is the radius of virus particles, σ is the shear
stress applied when virus particles transmit from one place to another, γ̇ is the shear rate,
NA is Avogadro number, m is the mass of a virus particle, kB is Boltzmann constant, T
is the temperature, φ is the volume fraction of virus particles in the volume V , φm is the
maximum packing fraction of virus particles, and E0 is the energy barrier for virus particles.

In MSIR model, we assume that during the transmission process from the susceptible to
the infected, both human movement and virus particle transmission are involved and the
“exposed” is only an transient state. According to the transient state theory of chemical
reaction8 , we may easily obtain:
k1 = k3 × k4 = Ap[exp −(

Eq.(1-3) indicate that infectious disease transmission is a complicated process, and is dependent on many factors like human movement energy barrier, the particle size and volume
fraction of virus particles, the mass of a virus particle, temperature, and volume in consideration. Smaller volume leads to lower transmission constant, and isolation definitely is a
good method to preventing virus from spreading.
For a sequential chemical reaction, the fraction of each reactant can be expressed with a
series of differential equations31 . For MSIR model, we may write:

Since the contribution from k2 R to the infected is negligible based on the fact that the
recovered may gain immunity from the disease and the fraction of the recovered is relatively
small at early stages, the first step reaction product, E and I may be written:

Both I and E should have a peak value that can be simply determined by differentiating
Eq. 18 against time:

In theory, the peak value of I in MSEIR model can be determined with a similar way but
there is no exact analytical solution. We may determine approximate peak values after the
equations are plotted out.
A very important parameter in infectious disease transmission is the basic reproduction
number, R0 , which is the transmission rate divided by the recovery rate. It is considered
to be an indicator on the severity of infectious transmissions. Note that our approach is
different from original Kermack-McKendrick SIR model1,4 and SEIR model4,32,33 . In these
models,
dS

dR

R0 = β1 /γ

in Eq. 6 and Eq. 10, we may easily obtain R0 as below:

know k1 , k3 , k4 . The rate constants like k2 , k2 , k5 , k5 can be determined with the recovered
data that are relatively easy to be counted during the initial period of virus outbreak. We
then can predict the peak time, the peak infected, and the basic reproduction number, etc.

RESULTS

The fractions of the susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered can be computed as
a function of time based on the equations above and shown in Figure 1 for both MSIR
and MSEIR models. The exposed and the infected peak at certain time and the recovered
increases during the same time of period, which is consistent with observations and other
models in the literature.
Since k1 and k4 are functions of virus particle volume fraction and environment temperature, the fraction in each category should change with these two parameters, too. Besides
virus particle volume fraction and temperature related terms in Eq. 2 and Eq. 3 , the
remaining is related to virus particle radius and mass, and the spacial volume under consideration. Clearly, large virus particle size and mass lead to large rate constants. For
clearly showing the relationship between rate constants and virus particle volume fraction
and temperature, we may rearrange Eq. 2 and Eq. 3 as below:

B and C are a constant for a specific virus and a spacial volume, when virus particles are
under normal shear forces during a transmission. For simplification reason, we may assign
a numeric value to both B and C, thus the impact of virus particle volume fraction and
temperature on the fraction of the infected can be evaluated illustratively. The infected
against virus particle volume fraction is plotted in Figure 2. A much stronger dependence of
virus particle volume fraction is predicted with MSIR model than MSEIR, possibly due to the
buffering effect caused by the “exposed” category in the latter. For MSIR model, an explosive
increase of the infection is predicted when virus particle volume reaches about 45%. It

looks like a percolation transition phenomenon34,35 , a first-order phase transition frequently
observed in amorphous multi-phase systems like colloidal suspensions, where contacts and
connections between individual entities play a critical role in controlling physical properties
of whole system. The relationship between the infected and virus particle volume fraction
seems to be reasonable, as intuitively more infection is expected if many virus particles
are present in a system. Some researchers have already claimed that infectious disease
transmissions are a percolation phenomenon in nature36 and applied percolation theory to
study epidemic spreading36,37 . Our prediction is in line with those research work.

MSIR model predicts a earlier and higher infectious peak position than MSEIR model. S0 is
assumed to be 1.

The infected is not only dependent on virus particle volume fraction, but also dependent
on the temperature, which is shown in Figure 3. The energy barrier term E0 of course
determines how temperature may impact disease transmission rate thus the number of the
infected. The infected in MSEIR model shows a much stronger temperature dependence and
decreases rapidly with temperature changing from 0 to 60 ◦ C, while the infected in MSIR
model just decreases a little bit with temperature. Higher temperatures definitely can reduce

disease transmission. From past observations, infectious disease transmissions typically show
a seasonal sinusoidal variation. Most infectious diseases like influenza happen in winter time
and diminish when spring or summer comes in. Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemics initially
started some time in December 2019 at Wuhan, China, has infected more than 75000 people
with over 2200 deaths so far. How long time this infectious transmission is going to last
and when it will peak are critical information to make proper mitigation strategy. Utilizing
the data provided by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) from Jan.
21 to Feb.17, 2020, the fraction of the infected is predicted with both MSIR and MSEIR
models and shown in Figure 4. From these data, we are able to determine the reaction rates

and make predictions. As shown in Fig.4 (b), both models predict that the infected may
peak about 150 days from January 21, 2019. For MSIR model, the exact peak time and
the peak values can be calculated with Eq. 24 with the parameters obtained from Fig.4,
tm = 158 days and Im = 0.854, corresponding to 170826 infected individuals. For MSEIR
model, we cannot have exact solutions to the equation but can estimate using Fig. 4 (b): the
peak time is a little longer than the predicted with MSIR model, about 160 days, and has a
higher infected fraction about 0.9, corresponding to about 180000 infected individuals. Both
models predict a skewed distribution, implying that the fraction of the infected remains at
high ends for a relative long time. Please keep in mind that these predictions should be
strongly dependent on how the isolation measures are executed and how accurate the data
are, which may affect the rate constants used in the calculations.
The fraction of the recovered is important to know, as it directly relates to how many
people may survive from this epidemics. The original SIR and SEIR models only consider
“the removed” that may contain both the recovered and the death. Figure 5 shows the
recovered (a) and the recovered plus the death (b) against time, predicted with both MSIR
and MSEIR models. Theoretically, the same rate constants obtained from the infected data

there is almost 10 times difference between these two group of data. If the removed data are
accurate, then the infected should be 10 times larger than the reported, which turns out that
724360 people should be infected by Feb. 17, 2020. Note that the regressions are relatively
poor for the recovered and even worse for the recovered plus the death. The long latency
period and lack of an effective drug to cure the disease may add complexity of claiming a

Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) from Jan. 21 to Feb.17, 2020, and
regressed with MSIR and MSEIR models. The population size 200000 was used for calculating
the fractions. (a) Only the recovered data are used for modeling; (b) Both the recovered and the
death data are added together for modeling. Same parameters obtained from the infected data are
used for calculations. For MSIR model, k1 = 0.02, k2 = 0.001, S0 is assumed to be 1. For MSEIR
model, k3 = 0.019, k4 = 1.05, k5 = 0.0006, S0 is assumed to be 1.

Another critical parameter in infectious disease is the basic reproduction number, R0 ,
which can be computed with Eq. 29. With the parameters obtained from the infected data
provided by CCDC, the calculated R0 is plotted against time in Figure 6. Initially, R0 is
really high, but decays rapidly and approaches a steady value. The predicted steady R0 value
is about 3.5 according to MSEIR model and about 1.5 according to MSIR model. Early
studies on coronavirus show R0 =2.238 , 2.6840 , and 3.1139 . Variation of R0 may stem from
the fact that it is not a constant in theory based on our model. Complex estimation methods
on R0 make some researchers believe that R0 is not an indicative parameter to use4,32,33 .
However, our method is straightforward and can potentially be used to standardize R0
calculation.

In summary, using same categorical methods as in traditional SIR and SEIR models,
we consider infectious disease transmissions to be a sequential chemical reaction and treat
the transmission process with the integration of both Eyring’s rate process theory and free
volume concept together. Based on the data provided by CCDC, the peak time, the peak
infected, the total infected based on the recovered data, and R0 are estimated and shown
in table I. These data indicate that current epidemics may last more than a year and total
infected people may be between 579488 and 941668.

DISCUSSION

Disease transmission is difficult to describe, as it is hard to identify the sources of diseases, confirm infected individuals, predict human movement pattern and virus particles
transmission pattern, etc. The physical mechanisms and principles governing infectious disease transmissions should be similar to the observed in amorphous disorder systems, such
as the percolation transition, Boltzmann distribution probability, the stretched exponential
relaxation, etc. Human motion is not a thermal driven movement, however, has been found
to follow the same Boltzmann distribution probability. The volume fraction of virus particles
should lead to a dramatic increase in transmission rate, similar to percolation transition process. The common many-body problems encountered in chemistry and physics world can be
resolved with the integration of Eyring’s rate process theory and free volume concept, which
has been demonstrated to work well for many multi-scale systems ranging from electrons to
granular particles, even the universe41 . This approach is therefore naturally applied to the
disease transmissions. Attempt made in this article is to understand physical mechanisms
of infectious disease transmissions using same categorical methods popularly employed in
infectious disease transmission field. Although our focus is put on coronavirus (Covid-19)
currently spreading around the world, the theoretical framework proposed in this article can
be applied to other transmission diseases, too.
The successful predictions are dependent on data accuracy. For every new type of a
virus, the test, identification, diagnostic, and counting methods need time and effort to be
properly established. It is fully understandable that the initial data don’t reflect the true
epidemic process. We utilize the official data released by CCDC to test our models. The
predicted parameters shown in Table I should be used cautiously.
Our approach is relatively simple and straightforward without involving complicated
mathematical calculations, in comparison with other theoretical models available in the literature. Extra seasonal force doesn’t need to be inserted into our model for demonstrating
the seasonality of infectious diseases, as rate constants are temperature dependent.

CONCLUSION

A sequential chemical reaction process from the susceptible, to the exposed, the infected,
and the removed in the end is proposed to describe disease transmissions. At each step,
there is a chemical rate constant associated with and the fraction of each product/reactant
can be easily calculated. Every step is a one-way reaction, except the last step from the
infected to the removed, as some small amount of the removed could be infected again. The
Eyring’s rate process theory and free volume concept continue to be used for defining rate
constants.
In general, our model predicts that the fraction of the infected will peak at certain time,
increase with the volume fraction of virus particles, and decrease with temperature. The
energy barrier for human to move has played a critical role in disease transmissions. The
isolation process with a huge energy barrier for human can change the chemical reaction
rate constant dramatically. The basic reproduction number is not a constant and can be
computed once the parameters in the models are determined.
In particular, we applied our models to treat coronavirus (Covid-19) transmission. Based
on the data provided by CCDC, we predict that the infected may peak at 158 days from Jan.
21, 2020 and may take a long time, more than a year, to drop to zero, though MSIR and
MSEIR models give a slightly different estimation. The data of the infected don’t match with
the removed for both models: based on the infected data, the removed is predicted to be 8
and 13 times smaller than the actual reported according to MSIR and MSEIR models. If the
removed data, either the recovered or the recovered plus the death, are reliable, the actual
infected people is between 579488 and 941668 by Feb. 17, 2020. The basic reproduction
number of coronavirus (Covid-19) is computed to be about 1.5 based on MSIR model and
3.5 based on MSEIR model.
