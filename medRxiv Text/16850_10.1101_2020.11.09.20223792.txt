Key Points

37

Question: What are the social determinants of health that contextualize individual-level

38

risks for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and how do selection biases affect our

39

understanding of these risks?

40
41

Findings: In this province-wide observational study of 14.7 million Canadians, social

42

determinants related to housing, education, and recent immigration were associated

43

with increased COVID-19 risks, with little evidence of selection bias. Individual factors,

44

such as underlying health conditions, were more prone to selection bias using certain

45

analytic approaches.

46
47

Meaning: Social determinants of health appear to drive COVID-19 incidence in Ontario,

48

Canada. Interventions aiming to prevent COVID-19 transmission should address these

49

empiric structural risks.

Abstract

51

Importance: Optimizing the public health response to reduce coronavirus disease 2019

52

(COVID-19) burden necessitates characterizing population-level heterogeneity of

53

COVID-19 risks. However, heterogeneity in severe acute respiratory syndrome

54

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing may introduce biased estimates depending on

55

analytic design.

56
57

Objective: Characterizing individual, environmental, and social determinants of SARS-

58

CoV-2 testing and COVID-19 diagnosis.

59
60

Design: We conducted cross-sectional analyses among 14.7 million people comparing

61

individual, environmental, and social determinants among individuals who were tested

62

versus not yet tested. Among those diagnosed, we used three analytic designs to

63

compare predictors of: 1) individuals testing positive versus negative; 2) symptomatic

64

individuals testing positive versus negative; and 3) individuals testing positive versus

65

individuals not testing positive (i.e. testing negative or not being tested). Analyses

66

included tests conducted between March 1 and June 20, 2020.

67
68

Setting: Ontario, Canada.

69
70

Participants: All individuals with ≥1 healthcare system contact since March 2012,

71

excluding individuals deceased before, or born after, March 1, 2020, or residing in a

72

long-term care facility.

74

Exposures: Individual-level characteristics (age, sex, underlying health conditions, prior

75

healthcare use), area-based environmental (air pollution) exposures, and area-based

76

social determinants of health (income, education, housing, marital status, race/ethnicity,

77

and recent immigration).

78
79

Main Outcomes and Measures: Odds of SARS-CoV-2 test, and of COVID-19 diagnosis.

80
81

Results: Of a total of 14,695,579 individuals, 758,691 had been tested, of whom 25,030

82

(3.3%) tested positive. The further the odds of testing from the null, the more variability

83

observed in the odds of diagnosis across analytic design, particularly among individual

84

factors. There was less variability in testing by social determinants across analytic

85

design. Residing in areas with highest household density (adjusted odds ratio: 2.08;

86

95%CI: 1.95-1.21), lowest educational attainment (adjusted odds ratio: 1.52; 95%CI:

87

1.44-1.60), and highest proportion of recent immigrants (adjusted odds ratio: 1.12;

88

95%CI: 1.07-1.16) were consistently related to increased odds of COVID-19 across

89

analytic designs.

90
91

Conclusions and Relevance: Where testing is limited, risk factors may be better

92

estimated using population comparators rather than test-negative comparators.

93

Optimizing COVID-19 responses necessitates investment and sufficient coverage of

94

structural interventions tailored to heterogeneity in social determinants of risk, including

95

household crowding and systemic racism.

Introduction

98

The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the

99

virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has resulted in a pandemic with

100

heterogeneity in exposure and transmission risks.1-4 There has been greater focus on

101

characterizing individual determinants of COVID-19, such as age,2,5 sex,6,7 and

102

underlying health conditions,2,8 than on social determinants of health.9

103
104

Heterogeneity in social determinants of COVID-19 may exist at the individual and

105

network levels (for example, by housing density10-12). In addition, social determinants

106

including barriers to healthcare, systemic racism, and xenophobia have been implicated

107

in COVID-19 risk.13,14 Environmental determinants such as ambient air pollution may

108

also play a role, as existing evidence indicates that higher ambient air pollution

109

increases risk for infection with other respiratory viruses.15 While previous studies

110

suggest that air pollution may be biologically related to COVID-19,16 including severe

111

COVID-19,17,18 it may also play a role in COVID-19 risk by operating within the context

112

of low-quality housing and environmental racism.19,20

113
114

Using observational data to identify determinants of COVID-19 relies on SARS-CoV-2

115

testing, which is not equally distributed.7 Differential testing introduces the potential for

116

selection biases,21,22 including collider bias.22 Collider bias may be introduced into

117

observational studies if the determinants under investigation are related to both COVID-

118

19 and the likelihood of testing.22-24

119
120

Thus, to identify heterogeneity across potential determinants of COVID-19, we

121

examined individual, environmental, and social determinants associated with SARS-

122

CoV-2 testing and diagnoses among 14.7 million individuals in Ontario, Canada. We

123

compared three analytic approaches to examine the role of selection biases.22

124
125

Methods

126

Study population, setting, and design

127

We conducted an observational study using population-based laboratory and health

128

administrative databases from Ontario, Canada. Ontario has a single-payer health

129

system that provides universal access to hospital and physician services25 and

130

laboratory testing.26 We used data from individuals tested between March 1 and June

131

20, 2020 to identify determinants associated with testing, and then used three analytic

132

designs to identify determinants associated with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of

133

COVID-19.

134
135

Data sources, linkages, and inclusion criteria

136

We linked individual-level SARS-CoV-2 testing data from the Ontario Laboratories

137

Information System (OLIS) to relevant health-related datasets containing demographic,

138

healthcare use, and area-level information (eTable 1). These datasets were linked

139

using unique encoded identifiers and analyzed at ICES, a not-for-profit research

140

institute in Ontario.27

142

OLIS captured approximately 88% of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported

143

by the province during the study period. OLIS records included specimen collection date,

144

results, and a text field for symptoms completed by healthcare providers at the time of

145

sampling. We obtained individual- and area-level demographic and environmental

146

information from the Registered Persons Database; the Canadian Institute for Health

147

Information’s Discharge Abstract Database, Same Day Surgery Database, and National

148

Ambulatory Care Reporting System; the Ontario Health Insurance Program; the Ontario

149

Mental Health Reporting System; the Ontario Population Health and Environment

150

Cohort; and the 2016 Canadian Census.28 Further details are available below and in

151

eTable 1.

152
153

To assess community transmission risks, we included individuals who were tested for

154

SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction tests and were not residing in a long-term

155

care facility as of March 1, 2020 (Figure 1). For individuals with more than one test in

156

OLIS, we used the first positive or indeterminate test, or the first negative test if all tests

157

during the study period were negative. Never-tested individuals during the study period

158

were included if they were not recorded as deceased before, or born after, March 1,

159

2020, and were not residing in a long-term care facility. A diagram of individuals

160

included and excluded is shown in Figure 1.

161
162

Selection and definition of potential determinants of COVID-19 diagnoses

163

Individual-level determinants included sex, age group, underlying health conditions, and

164

prior healthcare use (eTable 1). Underlying health conditions were selected as: a)

165

health conditions identified in the literature as associated with COVID-19 severity2,29-32

166

or associated with symptoms similar to those caused by COVID-19, because severity

167

and symptoms may lead to differential testing and thus, selection bias;33-38 or b) health

168

conditions such as dementia that increase the need for personal care support, thereby

169

reflecting network-level contact patterns that intersect with occupational risks among

170

essential care providers.39,40

171
172

Healthcare use was hypothesized to increase access to testing, and/or signal a marker

173

for comorbidities, and was measured by number of hospital admissions in the past 3

174

years; number of outpatient physician visits in the past year; and influenza vaccination

175

in the 2019-2020 season. We also included ACG® System41 Aggregated Diagnostic

176

Groups (ADGs)42 as a composite measure of comorbidities.

177
178

Environmental determinants included fine particulate matter (PM2.5) using satellite-

179

derived estimates43 and land-use regression model for NO2,44 at the postal-code level.

180
181

Social determinants were conceptualized as area-based variables that may signal

182

contact rates within and/or outside households [household density, uncoupled (for

183

example, not married) status];45,46 socio-economic barriers to healthcare access and/or

184

housing or proxies of occupation (household income, educational attainment, apartment

185

building density, and social assistance);47,48 and unmeasured confounders related to

186

race/ethnicity (visible minority status and recent immigration).13,14 These determinants

187

were derived from available measures within the long-form 2016 Canada Census at the

188

level of dissemination areas (DA), which are the smallest geographic unit that Census

189

data are disseminated.49 DAs were ranked at the city level (for median per-person

190

income equivalent) or at the province level (for all other social determinants), and then

191

categorized into quintiles. For apartment building density and recent immigration, the

192

high frequency of zeros permitted the creation of only three categories (i.e., comparing

193

the fourth and fifth quintiles with the lowest 60%). Variable definitions are detailed in

194

eTable1.

195
196

Statistical analysis

197

To identify determinants of testing, the outcome was defined as receipt of at least one

198

SARS-CoV-2 test during the study period. The comparator group comprised Ontario

199

residents who did not have a record of testing during the study period. Determinants of

200

testing were examined in unadjusted, age/sex-adjusted, and fully-adjusted logistic

201

regression models that included all determinants. The fully-adjusted model also

202

included a fixed-effect covariate for public health region. These are geographic areas in

203

which public health measures were differentially applied50 and along which there may

204

be considerable variability in measured and unmeasured social determinants.51 We

205

opted to include public health regions a priori in the model due to these predicted

206

variations in public health response.

207
208

To identify determinants of COVID-19, the outcome variable was a laboratory-confirmed

209

diagnosis. To explore the potential for effects of a variety of sources of bias from testing,

210

we compared the results according to different comparison sub-groups, by

211

characteristics that may have influenced the probability of being tested. We first

212

compared individuals who tested positive to individuals who tested negative (“pseudo-

213

test-negative design”). Second, we restricted the analysis to individuals with

214

symptomatic illness, mirroring the test-negative design commonly used to assess

215

influenza vaccine effectiveness (the “true test-negative design”).52 Third, we compared

216

all individuals who tested positive to all individuals who did not test positive (i.e., to

217

individuals who tested negative or were not tested; the “case-control design”). Potential

218

mechanisms of selection biases in each analytic design are outlined in eFigure 1A-C.

219
220

We then conducted unadjusted, age/sex-adjusted, and fully-adjusted logistic regression

221

models (including all determinants and public health region, as with testing) using each

222

of the three analytic approaches to identify heterogeneity in individual, environmental,

223

and social determinants of COVID-19 diagnosis. We interpreted each set of

224

determinants (individual, environmental, social) as independent analyses based on the

225

directed acyclic graphs (eFigure 1A-C). Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS

226

v. 9.4 (Cary, NC).

234

Of 758,691 individuals tested during the study period, 25,030 (3.3%) received a

235

laboratory-confirmed diagnosis (Figure 1). Only 11.8% of those tested had a symptom

236

recorded by the provider, 13.6% were considered asymptomatic, and 74.6% were

237

missing symptom information. Table 1 describes the characteristics of the study

238

population.

239
240

Determinants of SARS-CoV-2 testing

241

In fully-adjusted analyses, odds of testing increased with age (Table 2). Males had

242

lower odds of testing than females. Nearly every underlying health condition was

243

associated with increased odds of testing, as were most measures of prior healthcare

244

use. In contrast, higher measures of ambient air pollution were associated with reduced

245

odds of testing. There was little variability in the odds of testing by most area-based

246

social determinants. However, areas with higher visible minority populations had lower

247

odds of testing, whereas areas with higher household income and greater percentages

248

of uncoupled individuals had higher odds of testing. Effect measures across nearly all

249

determinants appeared to be progressively attenuated from unadjusted, to age/sex-

250

adjusted, to fully-adjusted regression models (eTable 2).

251
252

Variability in determinants of COVID-19 diagnosis across three analytic approaches

253

Choice of analytic design and comparison group restrictions had substantial influences

254

on the magnitude and direction of the association between individual-level determinants

255

and diagnosis (Table 2). Determinants associated with odds of testing further from the

256

null appeared to be more variable in terms of odds of diagnosis across analytic designs.

257

For example, the odds of testing for adults aged ≥85 years compared to those aged <5

258

years deviated considerably from the null (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=5.57; 95%CI,

259

5.45-5.70), and the odds of diagnosis differed between the pseudo-test-negative design

260

(aOR=1.72; 95%CI, 1.48-2.01), the true test-negative design (aOR=5.95; 95%CI, 3.57-

261

9.92), and the case-control design (aOR=7.09; 95%CI, 6.08-8.26). Some health

262

conditions associated with higher odds of testing, such as chronic respiratory conditions,

263

and indicators of prior healthcare use appeared protective against COVID-19 using the

264

pseudo-test-negative design, but reverted to the null or showed increased odds of

265

diagnosis using the case-control design. As with testing, effect measures for COVID-19

266

diagnosis across all determinants appeared to be progressively attenuated from

267

unadjusted, to age/sex-adjusted, to fully-adjusted regression models (eTables 3-5).

268
269

Individual determinants of COVID-19 diagnosis using the case-control design

270

Using the case-control design, age, certain comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes,

271

dementia), and increased prior healthcare use were associated with increased odds of

272

COVID-19. In contrast, other comorbidities (e.g., cancer, substance abuse) and receipt

273

of influenza vaccine in the 2019-2020 season were associated with reduced odds of

274

diagnosis (Table 2).

275
276

Environmental determinants of COVID-19 diagnosis using the case-control design

277

The two highest categories of PM2.5 exposure were associated with increased odds of

278

diagnosis, whereas no categories of exposure to NO2 were associated with increased

279

odds of diagnosis consistently across analytic approaches.

280
281

Social determinants of COVID-19 diagnosis using the case-control design

282

Area-level social determinants independently associated with COVID-19 included higher

283

household income, increased receipt of social assistance, lower educational attainment,

284

greater percentages of uncoupled individuals, higher household density, increased

285

apartment building density, and greater percentages of recent immigrants.

286
287

Figures 2A and 2B highlight the changes from unadjusted to fully-adjusted models for

288

the associations between area-level social determinants and testing and diagnosis,

289

respectively. For testing, the associations were attenuated after adjustment for nearly all

290

determinants. The association for household income reversed direction following

291

adjustment. For diagnosis, the associations were attenuated after adjustment for all

292

social determinants except for household density. Similar to testing, the association with

293

COVID-19 for household income reversed direction following adjustment.

294
295

Discussion

296

In this large-scale, population-based study, we identified social determinants as key

297

potential determinants for a diagnosis of COVID-19. We identified variability in

298

associations, likely due to selection biases, by analytic design across individual

299

determinants of COVID-19 diagnosis.

300
301

We identified increased odds of diagnosis associated with household density,

302

educational attainment, uncoupled status, and recent immigration, consistent with

303

findings from other settings.51,53,54 In particular, the results concerning social

304

determinants and COVID-19 risk presented here suggest these social determinants are

305

not likely artifacts of selection bias from study design, given the consistency of findings

306

across different analytic approaches. Lower educational attainment or uncoupled status

307

may be associated with higher exposure risk through lower-paying jobs in the service

308

industry55 and/or other high-exposure occupations, either because those jobs cannot be

309

done feasibly with proper protections, or because protective policies fail to be issued,

310

leaving workers at high risk.56,57 Higher percentages of recent immigrants in an area

311

were associated with COVID-19 diagnosis, even after adjustment, although the

312

percentage of visible minorities was not. Both variables might represent residual

313

measures of mediators of systemic racism, potentiating relative risks of SARS-CoV-2

314

exposure and COVID-19 severity,58-60 including COVID-19-related

315

hospitalization/death.14,21,30,54 We found that an association between visible minority and

316

COVID-19 diagnosis in Ontario was attenuated after adjustment for individual,

317

environmental, and other social determinants. These findings likely reflect what is

318

already known about race and ethnicity as social constructs and social determinants of

319

health.61 This is further supported by the attenuation of effect estimates from the

320

unadjusted, to age/sex-adjusted, to fully-adjusted models. Finally, the fact that there

321

was little variation in the odds of testing rates across levels of most of the social

322

determinants suggests that testing resources may not be prioritizing those who are most

323

at risk.62 However, even with this finding, our results indicate that social determinants of

324

health play important roles in determining COVID-19 risk. Taken together, our findings

325

suggest a need to increase and/or redirect resources that specifically address social

326

determinants such as household density48,63 (e.g., voluntary temporary isolation

327

hotels64), proxies for occupational risk56,60 (e.g., paid sick leave65), and other mediators

328

of systemic racism62,66,67 (e.g. community-led outreach testing68).

329
330

We also identified the size and direction of influence that selection biases may have,

331

adding to the ongoing conversation on the challenges of interpreting determinants for

332

COVID-19 due to collider bias.22 Although we did not directly explore each potential

333

collider mechanism, the pattern that emerged was that underlying health conditions

334

associated with COVID-19 severity2 may have been prone to collider bias, as evidenced

335

by higher testing and a seemingly protective effect when using the test-negative designs

336

that reversed when using the case-control design. It is, however, also possible that a

337

high number of covariates in fully-adjusted models caused instability in effect measure

338

estimates for these covariates. Age also demonstrated a similar potential susceptibility

339

to collider bias, possibly mediated by COVID-19 severity and symptoms (i.e., older age

340

groups are more likely to develop severe/symptomatic infection if infected2). Over the

341

study period, the testing criteria in Ontario shifted from returning symptomatic travellers

342

to severely symptomatic individuals and those with occupational exposure to additional

343

testing of asymptomatic individuals.33-36,38 In our study, the restriction of the test-

344

negative design to symptomatic individuals did not yield substantially different results

345

than the test-negative design including symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, but

346

that may have been partly due to the extensive (74.6%) missingness of symptom

347

reporting in the testing data. We opted not to use multiple imputation methods to

348

determine symptom information because, at the time the analysis was conducted,

349

reported symptoms of COVID-19 were highly variable and the extent to which

350

individuals may have asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic illness was unclear, limiting our

351

confidence in the generalizability of existing information to individuals whose information

352

was missing. Thus, while there is an intuitive desire to compare test positivity rates

353

among those tested—a common metric of comparison across surveillance reports and

354

dashboards69,70—the risks of erroneously identifying a “risk/protective factor”,

355

particularly individual determinants such as underlying health conditions, sex, and age,

356

are high and deserve careful interpretation by examining, as best possible, the reasons

357

for testing.22 In the context of low overall levels of testing, the case-control design may

358

have mitigated some potential sources of selection bias, with the assumption that those

359

not tested are similar to those who tested negative.21,22 Additionally, we found that some

360

underlying health conditions and prior healthcare use remained associated with

361

diagnoses, reflecting either unmeasured confounders or possible biological

362

susceptibility to infection if exposed;15,16,71-73 and suggesting that strategies tailored to

363

reduce exposures among individuals characterized by these individual determinants

364

could also be important in risk-tailored prevention.

365
366

Finally, these analyses identified PM2.5 as being related to the odds of COVID-19. It is

367

likely that some of this effect is due to underlying social determinants of health and

368

access to tests. Air pollution is often more intense, and results in worse health

369

outcomes, in areas with higher social deprivation.74,75 However, existing studies have

370

also implicated environmental pollution as having a biological relationship to the risk and

371

severity of COVID-19 and other respiratory infections.15,16,19 Taken together with other

372

findings regarding social determinants of health, these results indicate the importance of

373

considering air pollution and particulate matter in both individual- and area-directed

374

COVID-19 interventions.

375
376

Limitations

377

Our diagnoses were restricted to laboratory-confirmed cases and to the 88% of

378

diagnoses available via OLIS, and thus could miss probable cases as well as the

379

remaining laboratory-confirmed cases that may have different determinants of infection.

380
381

Results are also conditioned on the assumption that determinants remained constant

382

across the study period, whereas surveillance data suggest shifts in how infections

383

propagate between social networks.76 Future analyses include examining changes in

384

the direction and magnitude of determinants over the course of the outbreak. Although

385

we generated directed acyclic graphs for the general categories of determinants to help

386

conceptualize and mitigate selection bias while also identifying plausible determinants, it

387

is possible that we over-adjusted when interpreting individual variables within each

388

category.77 Our models also adjusted for public health region, within which many social

389

determinants cluster51, and thus we cannot infer from the results presented how social

390

determinants of COVID-19 risk may vary between and within these geographic regions.

391

Social determinants were measured at the area level and were not available at the

392

individual level; however, by describing individuals’ neighbourhoods, analyses reflect

393

the role of structural and environmental determinants for individuals living amongst them.

394

Some important determinants identified in the prior literature, such as obesity,8,78 were

395

396

uncertainty related to quantifying and appropriately grouping the occupational

classifications available in the Census data at the area level.

Conclusion

400

Individual-level risks for COVID-19 defined by demographic and health-related

401

determinants representing general targets of current response strategies appear to be

402

subject to selection bias, including collider bias. Moving forward and advancing the

403

response necessitates characterizing and addressing the social determinants

404

potentiating heterogeneity in COVID-19 acquisition and transmission risks with risk-

405

tailored, community-based interventions to reduce COVID-19 burden.

Forest plots show the odds of being tested for SARS-CoV-2, compared to the reference group (1st quintile or 1st category). In all cases, the first quintile/ category represents the lowest quintile of
values for the variable at the dissemination area (DA)-level. For example, the lowest quintile of household income represents individuals living in the lowest 20% of DAs by income quintile. Age/ sexadjusted models are shown in Table 2. Fully-adjusted models control for all variables listed in Table 2, including (but not limited to) all variables shown in this figure; effect estimates and 95% CIs for
all models shown here can be found in eTable 2.
