BNT162b2, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulated nucleoside-modified messenger RNA
(mRNA) encoding the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike
protein (S) stabilized in the prefusion conformation, has demonstrated 95% efficacy to prevent
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Recently, we reported preliminary BNT162b2 safety
and antibody response data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded phase 1/2
vaccine trial1. We present here antibody and T cell responses from a second, non-randomized
open-label phase 1/2 trial in healthy adults, 19-55 years of age, after BNT162b2 prime/boost
vaccination at 1 to 30 µg dose levels. BNT162b2 elicited strong antibody responses, with Sbinding IgG concentrations above those in a COVID-19 human convalescent sample (HCS)
panel. Day 29 (7 days post-boost) SARS-CoV-2 serum 50% neutralising geometric mean titers
were 0.3-fold (1 µg) to 3.3‐fold (30 µg) those of the HCS panel. The BNT162b2-elicited sera
neutralised pseudoviruses with diverse SARS-CoV-2 S variants. Concurrently, in most
participants, S-specific CD8+ and T helper type 1 (TH1) CD4+ T cells had expanded, with a high
fraction producing interferon-γ (IFNγ). Using peptide MHC multimers, the epitopes recognised
by several BNT162b2-induced CD8+ T cells when presented on frequent MHC alleles were
identified. CD8+ T cells were shown to be of the early-differentiated effector-memory
phenotype, with single specificities reaching 0.01-3% of circulating CD8+ T cells. In summary,
vaccination with BNT162b2 at well tolerated doses elicits a combined adaptive humoral and
cellular immune response, which together may contribute to protection against COVID-19.

Introduction

48

Given the high impact of the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome

49

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on human society, the rapid development of safe and effectively

50

prophylactic vaccines is of utmost importance.

51

Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulated messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology delivers the

52

precise genetic information of the immunogen to antigen presenting cells and elicits potent

53

immune responses2. mRNA is transiently expressed, does not integrate into the genome, and is

54

degraded by physiological pathways. mRNA vaccines are molecularly well defined, and are

55

synthesized efficiently from DNA templates by in vitro transcription, which is cell- and animal-

56

origin material-free3–5. mRNA production and LNP formulation are fast processes of high

57

scalability, rendering this technology suitable for rapid vaccine development and pandemic

58

vaccine supply6–8.

59

Within `Project Lightspeed’, the joint BioNTech-Pfizer COVID-19 RNA vaccine development

60

program, two phase 1/2 umbrella trials, one in Germany (NCT04380701) and one in the USA

61

(NCT04368728) investigate a total of four RNA-LNP vaccine candidates in. Recently, we

62

reported preliminary clinical data from these studies on the two most advanced candidates

63

BNT162b19,10 and BNT162b21. Each candidate is an LNP-formulated, pharmacologically

64

optimized11,12, N1-methylpseudouridine (m1Ψ) nucleoside-modified mRNA (modRNA)13

65

administered intramuscularly as a prime-boost 21 days apart. BNT162b1 encodes a trimerized,

66

secreted version of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S, whereas BNT162b2 encodes the

67

full-length SARS-CoV-2 S stabilised in the prefusion conformation (P2 S)14.

68

BNT162b2 in a 30 µg two dose regimen has been selected for advancement into an ongoing

69

phase 2/3 trial, guided by the totality of data obtained in the two phase 1/2 trials and NHP

challenge studies1,15. In the placebo-controlled, observer-blind USA phase 1/2 trial,

71

immunisation of 18-55 and 65-83 year old participants with BNT162b2 at dose levels of up to

72

30 µg was associated with generally mild to moderate local injection site reactions and

73

systemic events such as fatigue, headache, and myalgia1. BNT162b2 elicited robust S1-binding

74

immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titers. Geometric mean

75

50% neutralising titers (GMTs) of sera drawn from younger and older adults seven days after

76

the second dose of 30 µg BNT162b2 were 3.8-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively, the GMT of a

77

panel of COVID-19 convalescent human sera. Complementing and expanding the published

78

findings in the USA phase 1/2 trial, we now provide data.from the German trial (NCT04380701,

79

EudraCT: 2020- 001038-36). We report immunogenicity and safety of prime-boost vaccination

80

with 1, 10, 20 and 30 µg BNT162b2 in participants 19-55 years of age, including neutralising

81

antibody GMTs up to day 85 after the first dose (approximately two months after the booster

82

dose) and detailed characterisation of T cell responses, including the first identification of

83

epitopes recognised by CD8+ T cells induced by a COVID-19 vaccine.

84

Study design and analysis sets

85

Participants 19-55 years of age were vaccinated with BNT162b2 in Germany (Extended Data

86

Fig. 1). Participants’ mean age was 40 years; 56% were female, and all were Caucasian

87

(Extended Data Table 1). Twelve participants per dose cohort were assigned to receive a

88

priming dose of 1, 10, 20 or 30 μg on day 1 and a booster dose on day 22 (Extended Data Table

89

2). One individual each in the 1 µg dose cohort and the 10 µg dose cohort discontinued prior to

90

the boost. In each dose group, antibody levels and virus neutralisation titers were assessed in

91

10 to 12 participants per timepoint (up to day 85, 63 days post-boost), and peripheral blood

92

mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 8 to 10 participants were analysed for cellular immune

93

responses at baseline and day 29 (7 days post-boost) (Extended Data Table 2).

94

Safety and tolerability

95

Briefly, no serious adverse events (SAE) and no withdrawals due to related adverse events

96

(AEs) were observed at any dose level. Local reactions, predominantly pain at the injection

97

site, were mild to moderate (grade 1 and 2) and were similar in frequency and severity after the

98

priming and booster doses (Extended Data Fig. 2a and Extended Data Table 3a). The most

99

common systemic AEs were fatigue followed by headache and only two participants reported

100

fever, which was mild (Extended Data Fig. 2b and Extended Data Table 3b). Transient chills

101

were more common after the boost, dose-dependent, and occasionally severe. Muscle pain and

102

joint pain were also more common after the boost and showed dose-dependent severity. There

103

were no grade 4 reactions. Generally, reactions had their onset within 24 hours of immunisation,

104

peaked on the day after immunisation, and mostly resolved within 2-3 days. Reactions did not

105

require treatment or could be managed with simple measures (e.g. paracetamol).

106

No clinically significant changes in routine clinical laboratory values occurred after BNT162b2

107

vaccination. In line with previous reports for RNA-based vaccines1,9,10,16, a mild drop of blood

108

lymphocyte counts (without concomitant neutropenia) and an increase in C-reactive protein

109

(CRP) were observed, both transient, dose-dependent and within or close to laboratory normal

110

levels (Extended Data Fig. 3). Both effects are considered pharmacodynamic markers for the

111

mode-of-action of RNA vaccines: blood lymphocyte counts transiently decrease as the

112

lymphocytes redistribute into lymphoid tissues in response to innate immune stimulation17, and

113

CRP is a downstream effect of innate immune modulation18–21.

114

Characterization of vaccine-induced antibody response

115

S1- and RBD-binding IgG concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titers were assessed

116

at baseline (day 1), 7 and 21 days after the BNT162b2 priming dose (days 8 and 22), and 7, 21,

117

28 and 63 days after the booster dose (days 29, 43 and 50; day 85 for all dose levels except

118

1 µg) (Fig. 1, Extended Data Fig. 4, Extended Data Table 2).

119

The vaccine elicited strong antibody responses. Twenty-one days after the priming dose,

120

geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of S1-binding IgG had increased in all dose cohorts,

121

with S1-binding IgG GMCs in the range of 49-1,161 U/mL and evidence of a dose level-

122

dependent response only between the 1 g and 10 g dose levels (Fig. 1a). Seven days after the

123

booster dose (day 29), S1-binding IgG GMCs showed a strong booster response ranging from

124

691-8,279 U/mL. Antibody levels decreased over time, but with S1-binding antibody GMCs

125

still in the range of 1,384-2,991 U/mL at day 85 (63 days after the boost), and hence well above

126

that observed in a panel of sera from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients (631 U/mL). Similar

127

observations were made using only the RBD domain as the target antigen (Extended Data

128

Fig. 4).

129

SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising geometric mean titers (GMTs) increased modestly and only in

130

a proportion of participants after the priming dose of BNT162b2 (Fig. 1b). By seven days after

131

the booster dose, neutralising GMTs had increased substantially to 169, 195 or 312 in

132

participants immunised with 10 µg, 20 µg or 30 µg BNT162b2, respectively. The 1 µg dose

133

level elicited only a minimal neutralizing response (GMT of 25 at seven days after the boost).

134

On day 43 (21 days after the boost), participants vaccinated with BNT162b2 dose levels

135

between 10 and 30 µg had virus neutralizing GMTs between 108 and 166. Importantly, SARS-

136

CoV-2 neutralising GMTs remained stable up to day 85 (63 days after the boost) with titers

137

ranging from 120 to 181, and thus were 1.3- to 1.9-fold the convalescent serum panel

138

neutralising GMT of 94.

139

S1-binding IgG GMCs after the boost showed a gradual decline, which is typical of the pattern

140

of proliferation followed by contraction of B cells cognately activated by either natural infection

141

or vaccination25. In contrast, GMTs initially decreased after the boost but stabilized around day

142

43, which implies selection and affinity maturation of functional antibodies.

143

Neutralising antibody GMTs correlated strongly with S1-binding IgG GMCs (Fig. 1c). In

144

summary, neutralizing responses and antigen-binding IgG responses elicited by BNT162b2 in

145

this study largely mirrored those observed in the U.S.A. study, and for the first time cover

146

extended follow-up until day 85.

147

A panel of 18 SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants identified through publicly available information24

148

and the dominant non-RBD S variant D614G25 were evaluated as targets in pseudovirus

149

neutralisation assays. Sera collected seven days after the booster dose of BNT162b2 showed

150

high neutralising titers to each of the SARS-CoV-2 S variants (Fig. 1d), demonstrating the

151

breadth of the neutralising response against circulating strains.

152

Prevalence and magnitude of vaccine-induced T cell responses

153

T cell responses of 37 BNT162b2 immunised participants from whom sufficient peripheral

154

blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were available were analysed pre-vaccination (day 1) and

155

seven days after the booster dose (day 29) by direct ex vivo IFN enzyme-linked

156

immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay (Fig. 2, Extended Data Fig. 5, Extended Data Table 2).

157

SARS-CoV-2 S is composed of a signal peptide (aa 1-13), the N-terminal S1 protease fragment

158

(aa 14-685), and the C-terminal S2 protease fragment (aa 686-1273). S1 contains the RBD (aa

159

319-541), which binds to the host receptor, and S2 mediates fusion between the viral envelope

160

and cell membrane. To deconvolute reactivity against S, CD4+ or CD8+ T cell effectors were

161

stimulated overnight with overlapping peptides representing different portions of the wild-type

162

sequence of SARS-CoV-2 S, namely N-terminal pools ‘S pool 1’ (aa 1-643) and ‘RBD’ (aa 1-

163

16 fused to aa 327-528 of S), and the C-terminal ‘S pool 2’ (aa 633-1273).

164

Seven days after the boost with BNT162b2 at any of the doses, robustly expanded SARS-CoV-

165

2 S-specific CD4+ T cells were detectable in all 37 participants (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig.

166

5a). In 34 of these participants, comparison to pre-vaccination PBMCs was possible. Thirty of

167

the 34 subjects (88.2%) had de novo (not existent at baseline) CD4+ T cell responses against

168

both S pool 1 and S pool 2 of SARS-CoV-2. One participant had de novo response only against

169

S pool 2. The remaining three participants had de novo responses against S pool 1 and low

170

numbers of pre-existing S pool 2-reactive CD4+ T cells. In two of these three participants, the

171

pre-existing responses against S pool 2 were amplified by vaccination (from 91 and 188

172

spots/106 cells pre-vaccination to 1391 and 965 spots after vaccination, respectively), whereas

173

in one of the three participants, the pre-existing responses against S pool 2 remained stable (53

174

to 140 spots/106 cells). In conclusion, these data demonstrate that in 94.1% (32/34) of

175

participants, two doses of BNT162b2 induce poly-epitopic CD4+ T cell responses (de novo or

176

amplified) directed against both N- and C-terminal portions of S and thus against epitopes

177

outside the RBD (Extended Data Fig. 5b).

178

Although for dose levels ≥10 µg the magnitude of CD4+ T cell responses did not appear to be

179

dose-dependent, it varied between individuals. In the strongest responders, the S-specific CD4+

180

T cell responses were more than 10-fold of the individual memory responses to common viruses

181

and recall antigens (those from cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, influenza virus and tetanus

182

toxoid) (Fig. 2b, c).

183

Vaccine-induced S-specific CD8+ T cell responses were detected in 34 of 37 vaccinated

184

participants (91.9%). The majority were strong responses (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 5a)

185

comparable to individual memory responses against cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Barr

186

virus (EBV)and influenza virus (Fig. 2b, c). De novo S -specific CD8+ T cell responses were

187

induced in 33 participants, these were either directed against both (22 participants), or one of

188

the S pools (S pool 1 in ten participants, and S pool 2 in two participants), indicating a

189

preponderance of a poly-epitopic response including non-RBD S-specific T cells (Extended

190

Data Fig. 5b). In seven participants, pre-existing CD8+ T cell responses to S pool 2 were

191

detected that were not further augmented by vaccination. Six out of these seven participants

192

had a concurrent de novo response to pool 1 of S, which in strength did not differ significantly

193

from those observed in individuals without pre-existing responses to S pool 2 (Extended Data

194

Fig. 5c). Of note, the strongest responses (higher than third quartile) against S pool 1 among

195

the 34 participants with detectable CD8+ T cell responses were observed in those without pre-

196

existing S pool 2-specific responses.

197

The magnitude of S-specific CD4+ T cell responses correlated positively with S1-binding IgG

198

(Extended Data Fig. 6a), and, in line with the concept of intramolecular help26, also with the

199

strength of S-specific CD8+ T cell responses (Extended Data Fig. 6b). S-specific CD8+ T cell

200

responses also correlated positively with S1-binding IgG (Extended Data Fig. 6c), indicating a

201

convergent development of the humoral and cellular adaptive immunity.

202

Polarisation of vaccine-induced T cell responses

203

To assess functionality and polarisation of S-specific T cells, cytokines secreted in response to

204

stimulation with S pool 1, S pool 2 and RBD pool were determined by intracellular staining

205

(ICS) for IFNγ, IL-2 and IL-4 specific responses in pre- and post-vaccination PBMCs of 37

206

BNT162b2-immunised participants (Extended Data Table 2). A considerable fraction of

207

vaccine-induced, S-specific CD4+ T cells secreted IFN, IL-2, or both, while T cells secreting

208

the TH2 cytokine IL-4 were barely detectable (Fig. 3a-c, Extended Data Fig. 5d, e). Vaccine-

209

induced S-specific CD8+ T cells secreted predominantly IFNγ and lower levels of IL-2 in

210

response to S pool 1 and S pool 2 stimulation. Fractions of IFNγ+ CD8+ T cells specific to S

211

pool 1 constituted up to about 1% of total peripheral blood CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3d). Of note,

212

several of the analysed participants (n=3 in the 20 µg dose cohort and n=3 in the 30 µg dose

213

cohort) displayed pre-existing S pool 2 specific CD8+ T cell responses, which in 5 out of the

214

6 participants were not further amplified after vaccination. A strong pre-existing S pool 2

215

specific IFNγ+ CD4+ T cell response was detectable in one participant (20 µg dose cohort) (Fig.

216

3c).

217

In both assay systems, cytokine production of CD4+ as well as CD8+ T cells in response to

218

peptide pools comprising the full SARS-CoV-2 S exceeded the responses against the RBD

219

peptide pool, further confirming the poly-epitopic nature of T cell responses elicited by

220

BNT162b2. The mean fraction of BNT162b2-induced S-specific IFN+ or IL-2+ CD4+ and

221

CD8+ T cells within total circulating T cells was higher than that detected in eighteen control

222

subjects who had recovered from COVID-19 (HCS) (Fig. 3c, d).

223

Epitope specificity and phenotype of CD8+ T cells

224

CD8+ T cell responses were characterised on the epitope level in three BNT162b2 vaccinated

225

participants. To this aim, pre- and post-vaccination PBMCs were stained with individualised

226

peptide/MHC multimer staining cocktails for flow cytometry analysis. Twenty-three (4 for

227

HLA-B*0702, 19 for HLA-A*2402), 14 (HLA-B*3501) and 23 (7 for HLA-B*4401, 16 for

228

HLA-A*0201) diverse peptide/MHC allele pairs were used for participants 1, 2 and 3,

229

respectively. This approach identified de novo induced CD8+ T cell reactivities against multiple

230

epitopes for each participant, adding up to a total of eight different epitope/MHC pairs spread

231

across the full length of S (Fig. 4a, c). The magnitude of epitope-specific T cell responses ranged

232

between 0.01-3.09% of peripheral CD8+ T cells, and the most profound expansion was observed

233

for HLA-A*0201 YLQPRTFLL (3.09% multimer+ of CD8+), HLA-A*2402 QYIKWPWYI

Whereas the pMHC multimer approach probes a discrete subset of potential reactivities, bulk

236

IFNγ+ CD8+ T cell responses against full S determined by ELISpot and ICS are considered to

237

comprehensively capture the full poly-epitopic T cell response. However, comparison of both

238

data sets indicated that a functional T cell assay may underestimate the true extent of the cellular

239

immune response (Extended Data Fig. 5f).

245

Discussion

246

Effectors of the adaptive immune system have complementary roles in the defense of viral

247

infections. While neutralising antibodies are the first line of defense, CD8+ cytotoxic T

248

lymphocytes (CTLs) contribute to virus clearance from intracellular compartments that are

249

inaccessible to neutralising antibodies. Antigen-specific CD4+ T cells have immune

250

orchestrating functions, including provision of cognate help to B cells and CD8+ T cells, support

251

of memory generation, as well as indirect (e.g. via IFNγ) or direct (against MHC class II-

252

expressing target cells) cytotoxic activity.

253

There is broad consensus reflected in the design of ongoing clinical trials that a COVID-19

254

vaccine should induce antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S. However, it is not yet known if antibody

255

responses will be sufficient for full and long-lasting protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and

256

what the contribution of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells may be.

257

Previous experience with the closely related first SARS-CoV suggests that T cells prevent

258

severe forms of the disease27 and may be associated with long-term protection28,29. For the novel

259

SARS‐CoV‐2, an understanding of mechanisms of immunity from studies of infected and

260

convalescent individuals is only beginning to emerge. An increasing amount of data supports a

261

role of T cell immune responses30–32. COVID19 patients with critical disease states were

262

reported to lack S1‐reactive CD4+ T cells33. Cases of asymptomatic virus exposure have been

263

associated with cellular immune responses without seroconversion, indicating that SARS-CoV-

264

2 specific T cells could be relevant in disease control even in the absence of neutralising

265

antibodies29.

266

We report here that vaccination with BNT162b2 induces a coordinated immune response with

267

SARS-CoV-2 S-specific neutralising antibodies, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and immune-

268

modulatory cytokines such as IFNγ.

269

All participants vaccinated with BNT162b2 mounted de novo S-specific CD4+ T cell responses

270

and almost 92% of participants mounted CD8+ T cell responses, as detected with an ex vivo

271

ELISpot assay. The magnitude of the T cell responses varied inter-individually and showed no

272

clear dose dependency. Even with the lowest dose of 1 µg BNT162b2, most of the vaccinated

273

participants demonstrated robust expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. T cell responses were

274

directed against RBD, S1 and S2 regions of S, indicating immune recognition of multiple

275

independent MHC I and II epitopes, which was one of the reasons to favour BNT162b2 over

276

BNT162b1.

277

Expression of IFNγ and IL-2 but only low levels of IL-4 in BNT162b2-induced CD4+ T cells

278

indicated a TH1 profile and the absence of a potentially deleterious TH2 immune response.

279

While all CD8+ T cell responses against the S1 subunit of S were de novo and not detected at

280

baseline, pre-existing immune responses against the S2 subunit were identified in several

281

individuals. The S1 fragment has less sequence similarity to the corresponding seasonal

282

coronavirus sequences than the S2 fragment does, indicating that we may have detected pre-

283

existing cross‐reactive CD8+ T cells34,35.

284

pMHC multimer technology enabled the identification of S epitopes recognised by vaccine-

285

induced CD8+ T cells as well as direct quantification of the respective epitope-specific T cells.

286

The cumulative T cell frequencies in each participant exceeded the overall T cell response

287

measured in ELISpot and ICS assays, indicating that those assays underestimate the true

288

magnitude of the poly-epitopic response. Single peptide analyses are well known to yield higher

289

T cell frequencies as compared to functional T cell assays that stimulate with peptide pools,

290

with a multitude of immunogenic epitopes competing. A high proportion of induced CD8+ T

291

cells were early differentiated effector memory cells. This favourable phenotype has the

292

potential to respond rapidly, but has a limited capacity to produce IFNγ, and thus is less likely

293

to be detected in functional T cell assays. Previous studies have identified epitopes in SARS-

294

CoV-2 S against which infected individuals raise CD8+ T cells36,37. To our knowledge, this is

295

the first report of epitopes recognised by COVID-19 vaccine-induced T cells. Of note, the

296

immunodominant HLA-A*02:01 restricted peptide YLQPRTFLL identified in our study has

297

previously been described in convalescent COVID-19 patients36,37.

298

In addition to providing new insights into T cell responses, this study reproduces our previous

299

findings in the U.S.A trial1, and confirms a benign safety profile and robust induction of

300

antibody responses, with the latter being followed up for a longer period, up to day 85 (63 days

301

post-boost). Prime/boost vaccination with 10 to 30 µg of BNT162b2 elicited GMTs that, after

302

an initial decline, remained stable up to day 85 in the range of, or higher than, GMTs in COVID-

303

19 recovered individuals. BNT162b2 immune sera efficiently neutralised 19 pseudotyped

304

viruses (18 of which enter cells using an S protein with a different RBD variant, and one of

305

which uses the dominant S variant D614G), indicating the potential for broad BNT162b2-

306

elicited protection against reported mutations1,9,10.

307

Limitations of our clinical study include the small sample size, the lack of representation of

308

populations of interest (e.g. older adults, other ethnicities, immunocompromised individuals

309

and pediatric populations), and limited availability of blood samples for a more in-depth T cell

310

analysis.

311

Typically antigen-activated B and T cells go through proliferation, followed by rebound

312

contraction with a gradual decline in numbers before entering a sustained memory phase22,23,

313

and the short-term follow up presented in this paper does not allow for extrapolation of long-

314

term durability of the immune responses. Whereas it is encouraging that BNT162b2 robustly

315

activates antigen-specific humoral and as cellular immune effector systems, it is not clear

whether this immune response pattern will protect from SARS-CoV-2 infection and prevent

COVID-19. These questions will be addressed by the ongoing clinical program, which includes

Clinical trial design.

377

Study BNT162-01 (NCT04380701) is an ongoing, umbrella-type first-in-human, phase 1/2,

378

open-label, dose-ranging clinical trial to assesses the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity

379

of ascending dose levels of various intramuscularly administered BNT162 mRNA vaccine

380

candidates in healthy men and non-pregnant women 18 to 55 years (amended to add 56-85

381

years) of age. The principle endpoints of the study are safety and immunogenicity. Key

382

exclusion criteria included previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19; receipt

383

of medications to prevent COVID-19; previous vaccination with any coronavirus vaccine; a

384

positive serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and/or IgG; and a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid

385

amplification test (NAAT)-positive nasal swab; increased risk for severe COVID-19; and

386

immunocompromised individuals.

387

The presented data are from the BNT162b2-immunised healthy adults 19 to 55 years of age

388

exposed to dose levels 1, 10, 20 or 30 μg. The data are based on a preliminary analysis (data

389

extraction date of 23 October 2020 for safety and antibody analysis, 16 October 2020 and 24

390

November 2020 for T cell analysis [intracellular cytokine staining and ELISpot, respectively])

391

and are focused on analysis of vaccine-induced immunogenicity descriptively summarised at

392

the various time points, and on reactogenicity. All participants with data available were

393

included in the immunogenicity analyses. This part of the study was performed at one site in

394

Germany with 12 healthy participants per dose level in a dose-escalation/de-escalation design.

395

Sentinel dosing was performed in each dose-escalation cohort. Progression in that cohort and

396

dose escalation required data review by a safety review committee. Participants received a

397

BNT162b2 priming dose on day 1, and a booster dose on day 22±2 (on day 28 for one

398

participant from the 10 µg dose cohort). Serum for antibody assays was obtained on day 1 (pre-

399

prime), 8±1 (post-prime), 22±2 (pre-boost), 29±3, 43±4 and 50±4 (post-boost). PBMCs for T

cell studies were obtained on day 1 (pre-prime) and 29±3 (post-boost) (Extended Data Fig. 1).

401

Follow-up of participants is ongoing and includes assessment of antibody and T cell responses

402

at later time points. Reactogenicity was assessed by patient diary. Two participants discontinued

403

prior to the booster dose due to study drug-unrelated withdrawal (participant in the 1 µg dose

404

cohort) and an adverse event (participant of the 10 µg dose cohort) (upper respiratory

405

syndrome), respectively. The trial was carried out in Germany in accordance with the

406

Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and with approval by an

407

independent ethics committee (Ethik-Kommission of the Landesärztekammer Baden-

408

Württemberg, Stuttgart, Germany) and the competent regulatory authority (Paul-Ehrlich

409

Institute, Langen, Germany). All participants provided written informed consent.

Manufacturing of RNA.

411

BNT162b2 incorporates a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-grade mRNA drug substance

412

that encodes the trimerised SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein RBD antigen. The RNA is generated

413

from a DNA template by in vitro transcription in the presence of 1-methylpseudouridine-5’-

414

triphosphate (m1ΨTP; Thermo Fisher Scientific) instead of uridine-5’-triphosphate (UTP).

432

Human SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 convalescent sera (n=38) were drawn from donors

433

18-83 years of age at least 14 days after PCR-confirmed diagnosis and at a time when the

434

participants were asymptomatic. The mean age of the donors was 45 years. Neutralising GMTs

435

in subgroups of the donors were as follows: symptomatic infections, 90 (n=35); asymptomatic

436

infections, 156 (n=3); hospitalized, 618 (n=1). Sera were obtained from Sanguine Biosciences

437

(Sherman Oaks, CA), the MT Group (Van Nuys, CA) and Pfizer Occupational Health and

438

439

samples (n=18) were collected from donors 22-79 years of age 30-62 days after PCR-confirmed

440

diagnosis, when donors were asymptomatic. PBMC donors had asymptomatic or mild

S1- and RBD-binding IgG assay.

451

Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S1 or RBD containing a C-terminal Avitag™ (Acro Biosystems)

452

were bound to streptavidin-coated Luminex microspheres. Heat-inactivated participant sera

453

were diluted 1:500, 1:5,000, and 1:50,000. Following an overnight incubation at 2-8 °C while

454

shaking, plates were washed in a solution containing 0.05% Tween-20. A secondary

455

fluorescently labelled goat anti-human polyclonal antibody (Jackson Labs) was added for

456

90 minutes at room temperature while shaking, before plates were washed once more in a

457

solution containing 0.05% Tween-20. Data were captured as median fluorescent intensities

458

(MFIs) using a Bioplex200 system (Bio-Rad) and converted to U/mL antibody concentrations

459

using a reference standard curve with arbitrarily assigned concentrations of 100 U/mL and

accounting for the serum dilution factor. The reference standard was composed of a pool of five

461

convalescent serum samples obtained >14 days after COVID-19 PCR diagnosis and was diluted

462

sequentially in antibody-depleted human serum. Three dilutions were used to increase the

463

likelihood that at least one result for any sample would fall within the useable range of the

464

standard curve. Assay results were reported in U/mL of IgG. The final assay results were

that had been rescued by reverse genetics and engineered by the insertion of an mNeonGreen

470

(mNG) gene into open reading frame 7 of the viral genome38. This reporter virus generates

471

similar plaque morphologies and indistinguishable growth curves from wild-type virus. Viral

472

master stocks (2 x 107 PFU/mL) were grown in Vero E6 cells as previously described38. With

473

patient convalescent sera, the fluorescent neutralisation assay produced comparable results to

474

the conventional plaque reduction neutralisation assay39. Serial dilutions of heat-inactivated

477

monolayers (targeted to have 8,000 to 15,000 cells in a central field of each well at the time of

478

seeding, 24 hours before infection) in 96-well plates to allow accurate quantification of infected

cells. Total cell counts per well were enumerated by nuclear stain (Hoechst 33342) and

480

fluorescent virally infected foci were detected 16-24 hours after inoculation with a Cytation 7

481

Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek) with Gen5 Image Prime version 3.09. Titers were

482

calculated in GraphPad Prism version 8.4.2 by generating a 4-parameter (4PL) logistical fit of

VSV-SARS-CoV-2 S variant pseudovirus neutralisation assay.

487

Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoparticle generation and neutralisation

488

assays were performed as previously described24. Briefly, human codon optimized SARS-CoV-

489

2 S (GenBank: MN908947.3) was synthesised (Genscript) and cloned into an expression

490

plasmid. SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences were downloaded from GISAID

491

nucleotide database (https://www.gisaid.org). Sequences were curated, and genetic diversity of

492

the S-encoding gene was assessed across high quality genome sequences using custom

493

pipelines. Amino acid substitutions were cloned into the S expression plasmid using site-

494

directed mutagenesis. HEK293T cells (ATCC CRL-3216) were seeded (culture medium:

500

multiplicity of infection of 1. Cells were incubated 1 hour at 37 °C, washed to remove residual

input virus and overlaid with infection medium (DMEM high glucose supplemented with 0.7%

502

Low IgG bovine serum albumin [BSA, Sigma], sodium pyruvate [Life Technologies] and 0.5%

503

504

CoV-2-S pseudoparticles was collected, centrifuged at 3000 x g for 5 minutes to clarify and

505

stored at -80 °C until further use.

506

For pseudovirus neutralisation assays, Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) were seeded in 96-well

507

plates in culture medium and allowed to reach approximately 85% confluence before use in the

508

assay (24 hours later). Sera were serially diluted 1:2 in infection medium starting with a 1:300

509

dilution. VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoparticles were diluted 1:1 in infection medium for a

510

fluorescent focus unit (ffu) count in the assay of ~1000. Serum dilutions were mixed 1:1 with

511

pseudoparticles for 30 minutes at room temperature prior to addition to Vero cells and

512

incubation at 37 °C for 24 hours. Supernatants were removed and replaced with PBS (Gibco),

513

and fluorescent foci were quantified using the SpectraMax i3 plate reader with MiniMax

514

imaging cytometer (Molecular Devices). Neutralisation titers were calculated in GraphPad

515

Prism version 8.4.2 by generating a 4-parameter logistical (4PL) fit of the percent neutralisation

527

different portions of the wild-type sequence of SARS-CoV-2 S (N-terminal pools S pool 1 [aa

532

Classic Robot ELISPOT Reader and analysed by AID ELISPOT 7.0 software (AID Autoimmun

538

To account for varying sample quality reflected in the number of spots in response to anti-CD3

539

antibody stimulation, a normalisation method was applied, enabling direct comparison of spot

540

counts and strength of response between individuals. This dependency was modelled in a log-

541

linear fashion with a Bayesian model including a noise component (unpublished). For a robust

Peptide/MHC multimer staining.

571

In order to select MHC-class I epitopes for multimer analysis, a mass spectrometry-based

572

binding and presentation predictor42,43 was applied to 8-12 amino acid long peptide sequences

573

from the Spike glycoprotein derived from the GenBank reference sequence for SARS-CoV-2

574

(accession: NC_045512.2, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512) and paired

575

with 18 MHC-class-I alleles with >5% frequency in the European population. Top predicted

576

epitopes were identified by setting thresholds to the binding percent-rank (≤1%) and

577

presentation scores (≥10-2.2). Peptides were manufactured at >90% purity. pMHC complexes

578

were refolded with the easYmer technology (easYmer® kit, ImmuneAware Aps), and complex

579

formation was validated in a bead-based flow cytometry assay according to the manufacturer’s

580

instructions44,45. Combinatorial labeling was used for dissecting the antigen specificity of T

581

cells utilizing two-color combinations of five different fluorescent labels to enable detection of

582

up to ten different T cell populations per sample46. For tetramerisation, streptavidin (SA)-

583

fluorochrome conjugates were added: SA BV421, SA BV711, SA PE, SA PE-Cy7, SA APC

584

(all BD Biosciences). For three BNT162b2 vaccinated participants, individualized pMHC

585

multimer staining cocktails contained up to ten pMHC complexes, with each pMHC complex

586

encoded by a unique two-color combination. PBMCs (2x106) were stained ex vivo for 20

587

minutes at room temperature with each pMHC multimer cocktail at a final concentration of

588

4 nM in Brilliant Staining Buffer Plus (BSB Plus [BD Horizon™]). Surface and viability

Statistical analysis.

601

The sample size for the reported part of the study was not based on statistical hypothesis testing.

602

All participants with data available were included in the safety and immunogenicity analyses.

603

The statistical method of aggregation used for the analysis of antibody concentrations and titers

604

is the geometric mean and the corresponding 95% CI. Employing the geometric mean accounts

605

for non-normal distribution of antibody concentrations and titers spanning several orders of

606

magnitude. Spearman correlation was used to evaluate the monotonic relationship between non-

607

normally distributed data sets.
