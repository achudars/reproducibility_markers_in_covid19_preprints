Abstract

36

Background: To explore the cellular immunity and cytokines status of NCP patients and to predict

37

the correlation between the cellular immunity levels, cytokines and the severity of patients.

38

Methods: 123 NCP patients were divided into mild and severe groups. Peripheral blood was

39

collected, lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected. Correlation analysis was performed on

40

the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, and the differences between the indexes of the two groups

41

were analyzed.

42

Results: 102 mild and 21 severe patients were included. Lymphocyte subsets were reduced in two

43

groups. The proportion of CD8 + T reduction in the mild and severe group was 28.43% and 61.9%,

44

respectively; The proportion of B cell reduction was 25.49% and 28.57%; The proportion of NK

45

cell reduction was 34.31% and 47.62%; The detection value of IL-6 was 0 in 55.88% of the mild

46

group, mild group has a significantly lower proportion of patients with IL-6 higher than normal than

47

severe group; There was no significant linear correlation between the lymphocyte subsets and

48

cytokines, while significant differences were noticed between the two groups in CD4 + T, CD8 + T,

49

IL-6 and IL-10.

50

Conclusions: Low levels of CD4+T and CD8+T are common in severe NCP. IL-6 and IL-10 levels

51

were higher in severe patients. T cell subsets and cytokines can be used as one of the basis for

52

predicting the transition from mild to severe. Large number of samples are still needed to confirm

53

the "warning value" of CD4 + T, CD8 + T IL-6 and IL-10.

Introduction

57

2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was discovered due to viral pneumonia cases in

58

Wuhan in 2019, was named by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 10 January 2020. The

59

main source of infection is pneumonia patients infected by new coronavirus. Respiratory droplets

60

are the main route of transmission and it can also be transmitted through contact. People are

61

generally susceptible. At present, the occurrence, development, mechanism of prognosis and

62

immune status of patients with 2019-nCoV are still unclear.1 This study intends to detect the

63

peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in 123 patients with 2019-nCoV infection by

64

using four-color immunoflow cytometry and multiple microsphere flow immunofluorescence to

65

investigate the cellular immunity status and cytokine levels of 2019-nCoV infected patients, to

66

explore the correlation between cellular immune statuses, cytokine levels and the severity of 2019-

67

nCoV infection.

68

Materials and Methods

69

Patients

70

From January 26, 2019 to February 4, 2020, 123 inpatients diagnosed with 2019- nCoV

71

infection were collected in the Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital. All patients were

72

confirmed to be positive for new coronavirus nucleic acid by real-time fluorescent RT-PCR. Patients

73

were diagnosed according to the World Health Organization interim guidance for NCP and divided

74

into mild and severe (including severe and critical) groups

75

Blood sampling

76

Blood samples of the patients were collected by the nurse according to the doctor's order, and

77

all patients were not treated before the blood sampling or did not receive the standardized treatment

78

according to the diagnosis and treatment scheme of NCP.

79

Lymphocyte subsets detection

80

Two test tubes were taken for each patient, and were numbered A and B respectively. 5 μL of

81

CD3/ CD8/ CD45/ CD4 antibody (Beijing Tongshengshidai Biotechnology Co., Ltd) was added to

82

the tube A and 5 μL of CD16 + 56/ CD45/ CDl9 antibody was added to tube B. After adding 50 μL

83

of EDTA anticoagulant whole blood to each tube, the tubes were vortexed and kept at room

84

temperature for 15 minutes in the dark. Then the samples were detected by four-color fluorescence

85

labeled flow cytometry (Mindray BriCyte E6; Mindray, Shenzhen, China).

86

Cytokine detection

87

The detection reagent of cytokine was provided by Qingdao Raisecare Biotechnology Co., Ltd

88

(calibrator lot number: 20190801). Six cytokines including IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF and IFN

89

were detected by multiple microsphere flow immunofluorescence according to the manufacturer’s

90

instructions. After the blood sample and the corresponding flow tube be numbered 101, 102, 103,

91

104, and 105, EDTA-K2 anticoagulant whole blood was centrifuged at 2365 r / min for 30 min.

92

Then 25 μL of experimental buffer, 25 μL of centrifuged plasma, 25 μL of capture microsphere

93

antibody, and 25 μL of detection antibody were added to the corresponding flow tube. After

94

incubating at room temperature for 2 hours in the dark with gentle shaking, 25 μL SA-PE was added

95

into the flow tube respectively, and then incubation was continued for 30 minutes. Subsequently,

96

the diluted wash buffer (1:10) was added to the flow tube. After a few seconds of vortex shaking,

97

the flow tube was centrifuged at 1500r / min for 5 minutes, the liquid was slowly poured out, and

98

the flow tube was inverted on the absorbent paper. Then 100 μL of diluted washing buffer (1:10)

99

was added to the flow tube according to the requirements of the flow cytometer, and the test was

100

performed after shaking for 10 seconds.

101

Statistical analysis

102

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

103

Descriptive analyses were performed for categorical variables such as gender. Continuous variables

104

such as inspection results were expressed as x ± s and compared using the independent samples t-

105

test. Correlation analysis results were expressed by Pearson correlation coefficient and a larger r2

106

indicates better linear correlation. P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

107

Ethics approval

108

This study was approved by the ethical committee of Chongqing Three Gorges Central

109

Hospital and informed consent was obtained from each patient.

121

Among the mild patients, 54 (52.90%) patients had CD4 + T below normal values, 48 (47.10%)

122

were within normal values; 73 (71.60%) patients had CD8 + T within normal values, and 29 (28.40%)

123

95 patients (93.14%) had CD4 + T / CD8 + T within normal values, 3 cases (2.94%) were lower

127

than normal, 4 cases (3.92%) were higher than normal values.

128

In severe patients, CD4 + T was lower than normal in 20 patients (95.24%), within normal in

129

1 patient (4.76%); CD8 + T was lower than normal in 13 patients (61.90%), within normal in 8

130

patients (38.10%); B cell was lower than normal in 6 patients (28.57%), within normal in 15 patients

131

(71.43%); NK cell was lower than normal in 10 patients (47.62%), and within normal in 11 patients

132

(52.10%) 38%, 18 (85.71%) patients had CD4 + / CD8 + ratio within the normal value, 2 (9.53%)

133

patients were lower than the normal value, 1 (4.76%) was higher than the normal value.

134

Cytokines in peripheral blood of NCP patients

135

IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF, and IFN were divided into values of 0, within the normal value

136

(normal values other than 0), and above the normal value according to the results of various

137

indicators. The corresponding quantities and proportions were counted (Table 2).

138

Among the mild patients, 102 (100%) patients had IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17 all within normal

139

values; 57 (55.88%) patients had IL-6 values of 0 and 14 (13.73%) within normal values, 31

140

(30.39%) were higher than normal; 100 (98.04%) patients had TFN values within normal values, 2

147

Correlation between lymphocyte subsets and IL-6 in NCP patients

148

Considering that the value of IL-6 changed most in the mild and severe groups, the correlation

149

between the lymphocyte subsets and the cytokine IL-6 was analyzed. The data with IL-6 value of 0

150

in each group (57 cases in light group and 3 cases in severe group) were excluded, and 45 cases in

151

the mild group and 18 cases in severe group were included in the correlation analysis. As shown in

152

Table 3, the correlation analysis between IL-6 and lymphocyte subsets showed that the Pearson

153

correlation coefficients of IL-6 and CD4 + T, CD8 + T, B cell, NK cell, CD4 + T / CD8 + T were

154

very low, and there was no significant linear correlation.

155

Comparison of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in peripheral blood between patients with mild

156

and severe NCP

157

The data (57 cases of IL-6 and 3 cases of IFN in the mild group) with the index value of 0 in

158

the two groups were excluded. Two independent-samples t test was performed on the lymphocyte

159

subsets and cytokines of the mild group and the severe group, with α= 0.05 as the inspection level.

160

Significant differences were observed in CD4 + T, CD8 + T, IL-6, IL-10 between the mild group

161

and the severe group (P < 0.05), while no significant difference was detected in B cell, NK cell,

162

CD4 + T / CD8 + T, IL-4, IL-17, TNF, IFN between the two groups (P > 0.05, Table 4).

163

Discussion

164

Lymphocyte subsets play an important role in the body's cellular immune regulation, and each

165

cell restricts and regulates each other. This study found that among NCP patients, the reduction rate

166

of CD4 + T accounted for 52.90% in the mild group, and 95.24% in the severe group; the reduction

167

rate of CD8 + T accounted for 28.40% in the mild group, and 61.90% in the severe group, indicating

168

that T lymphocytes were more inhibited in severe patients when the body is resistant to 2019-nCoV

169

infection. This was consistent with the research conclusions of Huabiao Chen2 in SARS coronavirus,

170

revealing that the body responds in the same way when coping with homologous coronavirus

171

infection. The reduction ratio of B cell was 25.49% and 28.57% in the mild group and the severe

172

group, respectively, with no significant difference. The reduction ratio of NK cells accounted for

173

34.31% in the mild group and 47.62% in the severe group, which suggested that 2019-nCoV

174

infection limited the activity of NK cells to a certain extent, and in view of the fact that immune

175

adjuvant IL-2 can improve the activity of NK cells, the above research results may provide new

176

ideas and evidence for clinical treatment. 3

177

Chaolin Huang et al.4 showed that the levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, TNF-α, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-

178

1, MIP-1A were significantly higher in 2019-nCoV infected patients in ICU than those in non-ICU

179

patients, and the incidence of ARDS, secondary infection, shock, acute heart, and kidney injury was

180

significantly higher in patients with ICU than in non-ICU patients. The results of this study indicated

181

that 21 patients in the severe group had IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, and TNF within normal values. TNF and

182

IFN mainly secreted by Th1 cells and NK cells were not significantly different between the mild

183

and severe groups. In the mild group, 55.88% of the patients had IL-6 detection value of 0, and

184

30.39% of the patients had IL-6 detection value higher than the normal value. The reason remains

185

to be elucidated, which may be related to the inhibition of Th2 cells involved in humoral immunity

186

in the early stage of infection. However, the proportion of IL-6 above normal was 76.19% in the

187

severe group, which was significantly higher than that in the mild group. This is in line with the

188

concept of "Cytokine Storm", which must be experienced by patients with mild illness to become

189

severe, emphasized by Lanjuan Li, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. In

190

addition, in the course of diagnosis and treatment, the Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital

191

noticed that monitoring the changes of cytokines during the treatment process is of certain

192

significance to optimize the treatment plan and predict the outcome of the disease.

193

The results of this study suggested that there was no significant linear correlation between

194

lymphocyte subsets and cytokines. By analyzing the differences of lymphocyte subsets and

195

cytokines in peripheral blood between the mild and severe patients, we found that only CD4 + T,

196

CD8 + T, IL-6, IL-10 had statistical significance between the mild and severe groups, suggesting

197

that the immunosuppression of severe patients with 2019-nCoV infection was more obvious, which

198

was consistent with the opinions of many experts.5, 6 For several results of this study, for example,

199

the proportion of patients with an IL-6 value of 0 in the mild group was as high as 55.88%, there

200

was no significant difference in terms of IL-17, TNF, IFN, and IL-4 between the two groups of

201

patients, both B cell and NK cell decreased in different degrees in two groups of patients, the

202

possible reasons are as follows. (1)The conclusion of this study is a true reflection of the

203

characteristics of 2019-nCoV itself; (2) In the early stage of 2019-nCoV infection, due to the strong

204

variability and good concealment of the virus, it cannot be quickly recognized by the body; (3)

205

2019-nCoV releases certain special factors after entering the body and interferes with the body's

206

initiation of a specific immune response; (4) Other reasons that have not yet been confirmed.

207

This study has several limitations. Firstly, as the largest diagnosis and treatment center for

208

patients with NCP in Chongqing area, our hospital has more than 123 patients so far. The sample

209

size was relatively small compared with Wuhan, where the disease originated, which may have some

210

impact on the statistical results. But on the whole, the number of patients in this area was in the

211

middle level for other parts of the country except Wuhan, and the research results were relatively

212

reliable. Secondly, the humoral immunity level of the included patients was not monitored, so there

213

was a certain deficiency in the evaluation of the immune system. Thirdly, due to the large-scale

214

outbreak of the epidemic restricting the flow of people, data on healthy patients are lacking as blank

215

controls.

216

In future studies, data will be collected from healthy patients as blank controls to further

217

explore the predictive value of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and cytokines for patients with

218

2019-nCoV infection. At the same time, we will cooperate with other designated treatment units to

219

carry out multicenter research to include more confirmed 2019-nCoV infected patients, expand the

220

sample size, and design more rigorous randomized controlled trials. In addition, we will strengthen

221

the follow-up of patients who are cured and discharged, and regularly detect the patient's peripheral

222

blood lymphocyte subsets and cytokines.
