ABSTRACT
Background: South Korea was among the first countries to report a case of the novel
coronavirus (COVID-19) outside of China. As of 22 March, 2020, South Korea reported 8897
confirmed cases of and 104 deaths from COVID-19.
Methods: We collected the number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths in South Korea
from the World Health Organization (as of 21 March, 2020) and case distribution and fatality
rates by age from the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (as of 22 March,
2020). We estimated population-level mortality rates by fitting a negative binomial regression
model with the number of deaths as the outcome and population by age as an offset. We then
calculated the age-standardized death rate (ASDR) based on the current COVID-19 figures and
for alternative scenarios of increased prevalence.
Findings: The COVID-19 population-level mortality rate (per 100,000 person-years) increased
with age: from 0.1 deaths among 30-39 year olds to 9.5 deaths among ≥80 year olds. The ASDR
(per 100,000 person-years) was 0.8 deaths. The ASDR would increase to 52.0 deaths at a 1%
prevalence (becoming the third leading cause of death) and 155.9 deaths at 3% prevalence
(becoming the leading cause of death).
Interpretation: Currently, the population-level mortality burden of COVID-19 in South Korea,
as measured by the ASDR, was relatively low compared to other causes of death partly due to
the low prevalence of COVID-19. If the prevalence increases from another outbreak, the
mortality burden could increase substantially and surpass other leading causes.

INTRODUCTION
The first case of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in South Korea occurred in late
January 2020, approximately two months after the first case globally occurred in the Hubei
province of China.1 The number of cases quickly increased after an infected 61-year old woman
attended religious services with over one thousand other people.2 Approximately one month
after this first case and three days after the first death, South Korean President Moon Jae-In
raised the national alert level to its highest possible level and instituted voluntary lockdown of
affected cities and provinces.3 In addition to these precautionary measures, South Korea
implemented widespread screening and has currently tested more people per capita than any
other country.4
Case fatality rates are the most common measure used to assess the mortality burden of
COVID-19. These rates are computed as the ratio of deaths due to COVID-19 to the number of
people infected by the disease. However, comparison of COVID-19 case fatality rates across
countries and historic pandemics is problematic because the true number of cases may far exceed
the reported number of cases (i.e., the denominator of the case fatality rate) in most countries due
to a lack of testing.5 Even in countries with widespread testing, the mortality burden of COVID19 is more appropriately measured by age-specific mortality rates. In contrast to case fatality
rates, mortality rates are computed by dividing deaths due to COVID-19 and the exposure
measured in person-years lived (i.e., the entire population is at risk of infection and death from
COVID-19). In addition, while case fatality rates provide a good assessment of the likelihood of
death conditional on contracting the disease, mortality rates provide an overall risk of death for
the entire population. These mortality rates can then be summarized into the age-standardized
death rate (ASDR), which accounts for differences in the age distribution of populations and

allows appropriate comparison across countries. The age distribution is an important factor
because COVID-19 is more fatal among older adults and countries differ considerably in their
proportion of older adults (e.g., 16% of the population of South Korea is aged ≥65 years
compared to 12% in China and 23% in Italy).6
We address this research gap by utilizing standard demographic and epidemiological
principles to estimate the population-level mortality rate for COVID-19 in South Korea. We
focus on South Korea because it was among the first countries to report a case of COVID-19 and
make public its case distribution and case fatality rates by age. This paper makes three important
contributions. First, we estimate population-level mortality rates from COVID-19 by
age. Second, we also consider alternative scenarios in which the prevalence of COVID-19
increased and compare the mortality burden of the observed pandemic and these alternative
scenarios with leading causes of death in South Korea. Finally, we make available easy-to-use
software for public health researchers, government officials, and international health
organizations to input case distributions by age, case fatality rates by age, and the total number of
cases (either laboratory confirmed or alternative scenarios) to estimate the mortality burden of
COVID-19 for other countries.

METHODS
Data. We collected the number of laboratory-confirmed cases and total number of deaths
in South Korea from 61 official World Health Organization (WHO) situation reports from 21
January 2020 to 21 March 2020 and supplemented with total cases and death from the South
Korean Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC) on 22 March 2020.7 We also utilized data
from the South Korean CDC, which published the case distribution and case fatality rates in 10-

year age groups for the 8897 cases that had been confirmed as of 22 March 2020.8 The case
distribution equaled the number of cases in each age group divided by the total number of cases.
The case fatality rate equaled the number of deaths in each age group divided by the number of
cases in each age group. Finally, we utilized population counts by age group for South Korea in
2020 projected by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.9
Analysis. First, we began with the total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths to date
for South Korea reported in WHO Situation Report Number 61 (21 March 2020). We then
added the additional number of cases and deaths reported by the South Korean CDC on 22
March 2020. Thus, all data was current as of 22 March 2020. Second, we calculated the number
of confirmed cases for each age group by proportionally allocating the total number of confirmed
cases according to the case distribution by age group. Third, we calculated the total number of
deaths by multiplying the number of confirmed cases and the case fatality rate for each age
group. Fourth, we fit a negative binomial regression model on the mortality rates with the
number of deaths as the outcome and the population by age as an offset. We then predicted
mortality rates from the regression model. The mortality rates equaled the number of deaths
divided by the number of person-years lived over the 63-day exposure period (time from first
case on 20 January 2020 to 22 March 2020) for each age group. To convert mortality rates to an
annual period, we multiplied them by the fraction of the year 2020 represented by the exposure
period (i.e., 366 days/63 days). Sixth, we calculated the age-standardized death rates (ASDR)
for COVID-19, where the age standard was based on the 2016 population in South Korea. We
selected 2016 as the year of standardization because this is the most recent year for which the
Vital Statistics Division of Statistics Korea published the ASDR of the leading causes of death
(e.g., cancer and heart disease).10 See Appendix for step-by-step explanation of methods.

Finally we considered four alternative scenarios in which the prevalence of cases equaled
1%, 3%, 10%, and 25% of the population. These scenarios corresponded to 513,000; 1,538,000;
5,127,000; and 12,817,000 COVID-19 cases in South Korea, respectively (the population in
2020 is 51.3 million). We set 25% as the upper bound because this value was approximately the
prevalence of the US population infected with influenza during the H1N1 influenza pandemic of
1918.11 For each scenario, we estimate the population-level mortality rate by age group and the
ASDR. We compared the ASDR for COVID-19 in the observed pandemic and alternative
scenarios with those of the 10 leading causes of death in South Korea.

RESULTS
The first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 in South Korea occurred on 21 January
2020 (Figure 1). The number of cases exceeded 100 on 20 February 2020 and 1000 on 26
February 2020. The first death occurred on 20 February 2020. The number of deaths exceeded
10 on 26 February 2020 and 50 on 9 March 2020. As of 22 March 2020 (63 days after the first
confirmed case), South Korea reported 8897 cases and 104 deaths.
The distribution of cases by age group exhibited a bimodal distribution: 26.9% of cases
occurred among individuals aged 20-29 years and 19.0% of cases among individuals aged 50-59
years (Table 1). The case fatality rate increased with age: from 0.11% among 30-39 year olds to
10.46% among ≥80 year olds. There were no reported deaths among those aged 29 years or
younger. Our estimate of the population-level mortality rate also increased with age from 0.1
deaths per 100,000 person-years among 30-39 year olds (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.0 to
0.2) to 12.8 deaths per 100,000 person-years among ≥80 year olds (95% CI: 9.6 to 17.2; Figure

2). The corresponding ASDR for COVID-19 was 1.0 deaths per 100,000 person-years (95% CI:
0.7 to 1.4).
Based on the current number of confirmed cases, case distribution, and case fatality rates,
the ASDR for COVID-19 fell below the leading 10 causes of death in South Korea (Figure
2). However, relatively small increases in disease prevalence could quickly lead to a high
mortality burden on the population. For example, if the prevalence of COVID-19 increased to
1% of the total population, the estimated ASDR for COVID-19 would equal 57.1 deaths per
100,000 person-years (95% CI: 54.7 to 59.6) and be only exceeded by heart disease and
cancer. If the prevalence of COVID-19 equaled 3%, the estimated ASDR for COVID-19 would
equal 171.3 deaths per 100,000 person-years (95% CI: 167.1 to 175.6) and approximately equal
the ASDR for cancer—the leading cause of death in South Korea. Finally, if the prevalence of
COVID-19 equaled 10%, the estimated ASDR for COVID-19 would equal 570.1 deaths per
100,000 person-years (95% CI: 563.3 to 578.8) and exceed the previous leading 10 causes of
death combined.

DISCUSSION
This study reports three central findings. First, the population-level mortality rate of
COVID-19 in South Korea increased exponentially with age. Second, the population-level
mortality burden, as measured by the ASDR, was relatively low compared to other causes of
death because, in part, of the low prevalence of COVID-19. Third, the population-level
mortality burden could increase substantially if the prevalence of COVID-19 increases. For
example, at a prevalence level of 1%, COVID-19 would be the 3rd leading cause of death in

South Korea, and at a prevalence level above 3%, it would surpass cancer as the leading cause of
death.
The public, media, and government health agencies anxiously desire to know the possible
mortality burden of COVID-19. However, the complex simulation models that estimate
mortality outcomes require numerous assumptions and, perhaps more importantly, are
inaccessible to most.12–16 In contrast, our approach utilizes public data published daily by the
WHO and population-level clinical data that countries already collect.17 Our approach can be
readily applied to other countries and will directly account for differences in the age distribution
of populations, which is integral for calculating an accurate mortality burden as infected older
adults may be more likely to die than infected middle-aged adults from COVID-19.
We note several limitations. First, the case distribution and case fatality rates on which
we base our results were current as of 22 March 2020. However, the pandemic in South Korea,
including the case distribution and case fatality rates could change rapidly.2 Another outbreak
could overwhelm the capacity of the healthcare system and, consequently, case fatality rates may
increase as limited healthcare resources are unable to accommodate the increasing number of
COVID-19 patients.18 Second, our results are specific to South Korea, which was studied as
their governmental agencies provided the most robust and updated case distribution and case
fatality rate data by age. As a result, the ASDR of COVID-19 in South Korea, a nation which has
been lauded for its widespread screening and early treatment, may differ from those of other
countries.19 Our publicly available software allows researchers and public health officials to
input case distributions by age, case fatality rates by age, and total number of cases (either
laboratory confirmed or alternative scenarios) to estimate the mortality burden of COVID-19 for
other countries. Third, the number of laboratory-confirmed cases could be less than the true

number of cases, although South Korea has tested more individuals per capita to date than any
other country. If the true number of cases exceeds the reported number of cases, the estimated
number of deaths will increase and, thus, we may conservatively estimate the population-level
mortality rate.
In conclusion, COVID-19 currently yields a relatively low mortality burden in South
Korea compared to other causes of death because of its low prevalence in the population. If,
however, the prevalence increases because of one or multiple future outbreaks or limited
healthcare resources, the mortality burden could be substantially higher and exceed many leading
causes of death.
