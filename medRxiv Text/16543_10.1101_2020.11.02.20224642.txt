ABSTRACT
Background: Vascular thrombosis is common in patients with coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID‐19). Etiologies underlying this complication are unclear.
Purpose: To determine the prevalence of antiphospholipid (aPL), including lupus
anticoagulant, anti‐cardiolipin and anti‐β2‐glycoprotein‐1 antibodies, and its possible
association with thrombotic manifestations of COVID‐19.
Data Sources: We searched MEDLINE indexed journals on September 24, 2020 using
the tool LitCovid and the pre‐print server medRxIV.
Study Selection: Original investigations (cross‐sectional studies, cohort studies, case
series, and research letters) on COVID‐19 and thrombosis were included.
Data Extraction: Data were independently extracted, and compiled into spreadsheets
based on the PRISMA principles.
Data Synthesis: Hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 showed a higher prevalence of
lupus anticoagulant compared to non‐COVID‐19 patients. Temporally, lupus
anticoagulant was generally positive early in the course of illness, whereas anti‐
cardiolipin and anti‐β2‐glycoprotein‐1 antibodies appeared to emerge later in the
disease. Some patients who were aPL‐negative at an early time‐point after disease onset
became aPL‐positive at a later time‐point. Lupus anticoagulant was independently
associated with thrombosis in 60 COVID‐19 patients in New York had who had 32
thrombotic events (8 arterial and 24 venous). In 88 patients in Wuhan, who had more
than 20 each of arterial and venous thrombotic events, medium/high positivity for
multiple aPL was significantly associated with arterial thrombosis. However, the
association of aPL with thrombosis was not evident in reports that had an overall lower
number of or predominantly venous thrombotic events. Analysis of pooled patients
revealed that aPL were significantly more frequent in COVID‐19 patients with stroke
2

than stroke patients in the general population. Furthermore, injection of IgG aPL
fractions from COVID‐19 patients into mice accelerated venous thrombosis.
Limitation: Limited data and paucity of prospective studies.
Conclusion: The aPL are prevalent in patients with COVID‐19 and their presence is
associated with thrombosis. Importantly, these antibodies may be a key mechanism of
thrombosis in COVID‐19. Follow‐up studies are required to understand the relationship
between aPL and the spectrum of vascular thrombosis during and after infection with
SARS‐CoV‐2.

INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has resulted in tremendous
morbidity and mortality. Many patients with COVID‐19 exhibit hypercoagulable states,
with manifestations ranging from disseminated intravascular coagulation to venous
thromboembolism and cerebrovascular disease (1). Among patients with acute
respiratory distress syndrome, more thrombotic complications were diagnosed in
COVID‐19 patients than in matched patients without COVID‐19 (odds ratio 2.6 [1.1–
6.1]) (2). An autopsy study detected venous thromboembolism in more than half of
deceased COVID‐19 patients in whom it was not suspected earlier (3).
As these thrombotic manifestations began being reported at high rates, attempts
are being made to uncover the underlying etiologies. A report from Wuhan, China, in
April 2020 described three COVID‐19 patients who developed thrombosis including
multiple‐vessel brain infarction and acro‐ ischemia (4). All three patients had anti‐
cardiolipin (aCL) and anti‐β2 glycoprotein‐1 (aβ2GP1) antibodies, collectively called
antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies.
The presence of aPL antibodies and a functional assay called lupus anticoagulant
(LA) are the hallmarks of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) that manifests with venous
and arterial thrombosis (5). Some patients with APS have no other associated condition
(primary APS), while others can be associated with infections and autoimmune
disorders. Various infections, notably Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV, have been shown
to induce aPL antibodies, however, the significant thrombotic risk with aPL was seen
only in HCV infection (6, 7). It is unclear whether SARS‐CoV‐2 elicits the production of
aPL that associate with increased thrombotic risk.

In this systematic review, we identify patients with COVID‐19 and thrombosis
who were tested for aPL, and determine the prevalence of aPL in this population
compared to the general population with reference to specific thrombotic
manifestations. We further seek if any causal relationship exists between the presence
of aPL in these patients and thrombosis.

Methods
Data Sources and Searches: We searched MEDLINE indexed journals using the tool
LitCovid (8) on September 24, 2020. Due to the rapidly changing landscape of research
in COVID‐19, we also searched the pre‐print server medRxIV, with the acknowledgment
that those articles are not peer‐reviewed.

Study Selection: We included all original investigations (cross‐sectional studies, cohort
studies, case series, case reports and research letters) relevant to adult patients in the
English language. We used the following search terms: “COVID‐19”, “Coronavirus”,
“ncov”, “2019‐ncov” and “Antiphospholipid antibodies”, “Antiphospholipid antibody
syndrome”, “Lupus anticoagulant” and “Stroke”, “Venous thromboembolism”, “Deep
vein thrombosis” (DVT), “Myocardial infarction” and “Acute limb ischemia”. Articles that
did not contain any laboratory data and those which did not carry out testing for aPL
were excluded.

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment: Data were extracted by one reviewer (A.K.),
and independently reviewed by other two authors. We assessed article for the quality of
evidence (Appendix Table 1).

5

Data Synthesis and Analysis: First, to assess the prevalence of aPL in COVID‐19, we
compiled studies that reported aPL assays in patients with COVID‐19. Second, we
compiled studies that reported aPL assays in COVID‐19 patients in relation to
thrombosis. Third, we compared the frequency of aPL in patients with stroke in the
general population versus COVID‐19 using Fisher’s exact test.

Role of the Funding Source: Not applicable.

Results
We found 4,354 search results for these queries, of which 221 results were relevant
(Appendix Figure 1). After excluding 59 articles that did not report any laboratory
parameters and 104 articles that did not test for aPL antibodies, we were left with 58
articles reporting thrombotic events in COVID‐19 patients who were tested for aPL
antibodies, which we included in our systematic review.

Antiphospholipid positivity in patients with COVID‐19
Studies from Europe and the United States have shown a very high prevalence of LA in
patients with COVID‐19, ranging from 19% to 92% (Table 1, Figure 1). The prevalence
of LA was significantly higher in COVID‐19 patients than in non‐COVID‐19 controls, for
example, 44% vs. 22% in New York, and ~19% vs. 2% in UK (9, 10). The prevalence of
LA was also higher in Italian COVID‐19 patients than in patients with other autoimmune
rheumatic diseases (22% vs. 15%), but lower than in patients with primary APS (56%)
(11). Contrary to these reports, patients from China were reported to have a much
lower prevalence of LA – 3% of 66 and 5% of 19 patients in Wuhan and 0 of 13 in
Beijing (12, 13). However, Chinese patients had a much higher prevalence of aβ2GP1
6

and aCL antibodies (47%‐53%). These patients were tested at later time points (~29‐39
days) after disease onset than in most European and American studies. Consistently,
aCL/aβ2GP1 positive French patients tended to have been tested longer after COVID‐19
symptoms started than the negative patients (14). Furthermore, 10 Chinese patients
who were aPL negative at an early time point after disease onset became aPL positive
later (12), and a French patient with isolated IgM aCL seroconverted to IgG aCL and
aβ2GP1 antibodies (14).
IgA aβ2GP1, IgA aCL, and IgG aβ2GP1 antibodies were the most prevalent aPL in
Chinese patients, with many of them positive for multiple isotypes (12, 13). IgG aβ2GP1
antibodies were also most frequent in a report from Italy(15). Reports from Michigan
and Mexico also showed a high prevalence of the non‐criteria anti‐
phosphatidylserine/prothrombin antibodies (16, 17). IgA antibodies were not tested in
many European and American studies.
As a whole, reports from around the world appear to suggest a high prevalence
of LA at early time points after COVID‐19 infection, whereas aPL antibodies emerge
later in the disease course. This suggests that COVID‐19 patients who have a longer
disease duration are more likely to have aPL antibodies.

Antiphospholipid positivity in relation to thrombosis in COVID‐19 patients
An early report described three COVID‐19 patients with multi‐vessel brain infarction,
acro‐ischemia, and IgA/IgG aCL and aβ2GP1 antibodies (4). This was followed by a
flurry of reports seeking a relation between aPL antibodies and thrombosis in COVID‐19
(Table 2 and Appendix Table 2).
In 66 COVID‐19 patients from Wuhan, 38% developed arterial or venous
thrombosis, and nearly half of all patients were positive for aPL antibodies (12). When
7

stratified based on positivity for aPL antibodies, patients with medium/high positivity
for multiple aPL antibodies showed a significantly higher incidence of cerebral
infarction compared to patients with negative aPL antibodies (0 vs. 33.3%, p 0.023). In
another report from Wuhan, 9 of 10 patients who were aPL positive as compared to 0 of
9 aPL‐negative patients developed thrombosis; all patients were already receiving
anticoagulation(13). All four patients who developed cerebral infarction had multiple
isotypes of aPL antibodies detectable.
Such a tight link between the presence of aPL antibodies and thrombosis in
COVID‐19 patients was not apparent in reports from Europe. Nonetheless, 24% of
Italian patients with at least one aPL developed thrombosis versus 12% of patients who
were aPL negative (p 0.09) (11). Thrombotic events in this report were almost
exclusively venous, and 50% of all patients were positive for at least one aPL. In another
report from Italy, 13% of patients had a thrombotic event including 8 each of arterial
and venous thrombosis and 6%‐16% had various aPL, but there was no significant
association between thrombosis and aPL (15). Venous events, namely DVT and
pulmonary embolism (PE), were also frequent in French patients, and aPL antibody
positivity tended to be more frequent in patients with thrombosis than in those without
it, but the differences were not statistically significant (14, 18). No association with aPL
was found in patients from Spain and Belgium who had predominantly venous
thrombosis (19, 20). Likewise, a Michigan study found no significant association
between aPL positivity and thrombosis in patients who received a stricter
thromboprophylaxis and had a low frequency of thrombotic complications (6%) (16).
Overall, most reports from Europe did not support a significant relationship between
aPL positivity and thrombosis in patients with COVID‐19. Most of these studies had a

8

relatively small number of thrombotic events and did not stratify them into arterial and
venous events separately to ascertain specific relations with aPL antibodies.
In a New York cohort of 60 patients with COVID‐19 who had 32 thrombotic
events including 8 arterial and 24 venous, LA was found to be independently associated
with thrombosis (10). All of the arterial thrombotic events and 11 venous
thromboembolism occurred in LA‐positive patients as compared to LA‐negative
patients who had only venous events. All 4 patients with COVID‐19 and stroke in a UK
report were also positive for LA (21). Overall, these reports suggest a potential link
between aPL antibodies and thrombosis in COVID‐19.

Antiphospholipid antibodies and individual manifestations of APS in patients
with COVID‐19
Next, to seek any potential links between aPL and individual APS manifestations in
COVID‐19, we compared the frequency of aPL in patients with specific manifestations in
COVID‐19 to the general population, the latter as reported in a systematic review of 120
full‐text papers (22). The overall aPL frequency in this analysis was estimated to be
13.5% for stroke, 11% for myocardial infarction, 9.5% for DVT, and 6% for pregnancy
morbidity in the general population.
Of 438 COVID‐19 patients with ischemic stroke, 65 were tested for aPL
antibodies, and 38 (58.4%) were found to be positive (Table 3). Compared to the
overall frequency of aPL in stroke patients in the general population, which was 13.5%
(interquartile range 6.8‐23.3) in all 31 studies and 7.5% (5.3‐13.8) in 7 prospective
studies(22), COVID‐19 patients with stroke had a significantly higher frequency of aPL
(p <0.0001, Figure 2). This profound difference in the prevalence of aPL antibodies in
stroke patients with and without SARS‐CoV‐2 infection suggests a link between
9

ischemic stroke and aPL antibodies in COVID‐19, with a caveat that the two groups of
patients are different in terms of comorbidities, age, state of health, and other
demographic factors.
There were notable differences in the prevalence of aPL antibodies in COVID‐9
patients with stroke from different continents: 94.4% in Chinese patients with ischemic
stroke, 55% in European patients, and 37% in American patients (Table 3).
In addition to stroke, arterial thrombosis in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection has manifested
with myocardial infarction, acute limb ischemia, and thrombosis of large arteries (23,
24). Thus far, there are only a few reports of aPL antibodies in patients with myocardial
infarction and acute limb ischemia (Table 2, Appendix Table 2).
Venous thrombosis in patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 has predominantly
manifested as DVT and PE and occasionally as cerebral venous thrombosis and portal
vein thrombosis. Among 150 COVID‐19 patients referred to intensive care units of a
French tertiary hospital, 64 thrombotic complications occurred, including PE (16.7%)
(2). Notably, 87.7% of 57 patients suspected to have a coagulation disorder and tested
had a positive LA. This frequency of aPL in venous thrombosis in COVID‐19 patients
appears much higher (27/87=31%) than aPL frequency in venous thrombosis patients
in the general population (9.5%) (22). However, the testing and reporting of aPL are
inadequate at this time for most of 648 patients with PE and 430 patients with DVT
from around the world to make statistical comparisons.
Pregnancy loss is also a major manifestation of APS. Of 458 pregnancies in
hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 in the US, pregnancy loss occurred in 10 (2.2%)
including four that occurred within 20 weeks of gestation (25). There have also been
case reports of 1st and 2nd‐trimester miscarriages in asymptomatic or minimally

10

symptomatic women (26). We have not found studies of aPL in relation to pregnancy
outcome.
Thrombocytopenia occurs in 22%‐42% of patients with APS. It has been
reported in 5% to 54% of patients with COVID‐19, with the incidence varying according
to disease severity (27). It has also been reported in many asymptomatic patients.
However, its association with aPL has not been explored in COVID‐19.
Livedo reticularis‐like vascular lesions, the most common skin manifestation of
APS, have been reported in 2%‐5% of patients with COVID‐19 (28). Its association with
aPL antibodies has not been explored.
Akin to reports in patients with APS, higher levels of aPL in COVID‐19 patients
were associated with neutrophil hyperactivity including the release of neutrophil
extracellular traps (NET), and IgG fractions isolated from patients with COVID‐19
promoted NET release from control neutrophils (16).

Pathogenic significance of antiphospholipid antibodies
A report from Belgium found single LA positivity during the acute phase of COVID‐19
infection, but not when tested one month later. This led them to suggest that COVID‐19,
like other viral infections, causes a transient production of aPL antibodies in critically ill
patients, which may be of no clinical significance (6, 20). However, other studies
detected aPL antibodies more than a month after the onset of symptoms, and many
patients who were aPL negative at an early time point became positive later (12, 15). In
Chinese studies, all symptomatic thrombotic events occurred in aPL positive patients (4,
12, 13). Higher levels of aPL were also associated with more severe respiratory disease
and lower glomerular filtration rate in COVID‐19 patients(16). Importantly, similar to
studies in APS (29), injection of IgG fractions from COVID‐19 patients into mice
11

accelerated venous thrombosis (16). Collectively, these studies suggest that aPL are
potentially thrombogenic in patients with COVID‐19.

Discussion
Viral infections are known to elicit the production of aPL antibodies, but the antibodies
are generally transient and rarely cause thrombosis except for HIV and HCV that mainly
induce IgG aCL antibodies (6). Thromboembolic events in patients with HCV were
predominantly in patients who had aCL antibodies and were negative for LA and
aβ2GP1(7). This is different from the aPL profile reported in COVID‐19. The presence of
LA was independently associated with thrombosis in patients with COVID‐19 in some,
but not in all studies. In COVID‐19 patients in Wuhan, positivity for multiple aPL,
including aCL and aβ2GP1 antibodies, of multiple isotypes at medium‐to‐high titers
were significantly associated with arterial thrombosis (12, 13), which is consistent with
the literature on APS that double and triple aPL positivity is associated with the
increased risk for thrombosis (30).
IgA aCL, IgA aβ2GP1, and IgG aβ2GP1 antibodies were the most common aPL in
COVID‐19 patients in Wuhan (12). There was a striking association between the
presence of these antibodies and cerebral infarction. The latter has important
implications, as IgA aβ2GPI has been suggested as a risk factor for acute myocardial
infarction and acute cerebral ischemia (31). Other studies have also linked IgA aPL
antibodies to a higher risk of thrombosis (32). It is postulated that the infection of the
respiratory and gastrointestinal mucosa by SARS‐CoV‐2 may elicit the IgA antibody
production, which could go on to cause thrombosis (12). These observations warrant
that IgA aPL, although not part of the diagnostic criteria for APS, be uniformly tested in
addition to IgG/M aPL in patients with acute arterial ischemic events and COVID‐19.
12

The significantly higher aPL antibody positive rate in China compared to the USA
and Europe could be due to various reasons. Chinese studies tested IgA antibodies,
while patients in Europe and the US were mostly not tested for them. Chinese patients
with stroke could also have had SARS‐CoV‐2 infection for a longer duration. It is also
possible that APS is an important mechanism of thrombosis in severely ill SARS‐CoV‐2
patients, which had not been (at the time of this study) adequately tested in the US and
Europe.
Our analysis has several limitations. First, the Sapporo classification criteria for
APS requires the aPL to be measured twice over a period of 12 weeks to establish that
the levels are not transient (33). In this regard, most studies have tested aPL in
hospitalized patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection within days of the onset of symptoms.
Therefore, follow up studies are required to truly understand whether the patient
developed APS or simply had a transient elevation of aPL.
Second, the guidelines from the International Society on Thrombosis and
Hemostasis state that anticoagulation must be discontinued for 12 hours before the
testing for LA or the testing must be done before anticoagulation is started (34). Since
critically ill patients are often anticoagulated, it is important to interpret a positive LA
result with caution in this setting. Elevated levels of the acute phase reactant C‐reactive
protein, as commonly seen in patients hospitalized with COVID‐19, have also been
shown to interfere with reagents commonly used to test LA (35). Antibody assays for
aCL and aβ2GP1 antibodies also suffer from a lack of standardization and the presence
of inter‐laboratory variation, which can influence the interpretation of tests with
borderline results (36).
Third, many patients with COVID‐19 in most reports analyzed had comorbidities
including diabetes and hypertension, which could contribute to a pro‐thrombotic
13

milieu. Other complications, including heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia,
disseminated intravascular coagulation, and thrombotic microangiopathy, could also be
causes of thrombosis in these critically ill patients. We also acknowledge the risk of bias
including, but not limited to, possible poor/inadequate reporting in individual articles,
potential lack of external validity, potential selective outcome reporting in individual
articles, evidence selection bias due to non‐publication, new information published after
our cut‐off date, and articles in non‐English languages,
Finally, it has been suggested that catastrophic APS could be a possible
explanation of the cytokine storm in some patients with severe COVID‐19. Catastrophic
APS is a fulminant form of APS that presents with widespread small vessel thrombosis.
However, unlike catastrophic APS that manifests predominantly with intra‐abdominal
thrombosis, patients who died from COVID‐19 had a predominance of pulmonary
microvascular thrombosis (37).
Studies in APS suggest a direct pathogenic role of aPL antibodies, as the
experimental transfer of polyclonal IgG antibodies against domain I of β2 glycoprotein
from a patient with APS into mice induced thrombosis in blood vessels (29).
Consistently, injection of IgG fractions from COVID‐19 patients who have aPL antibodies
into mice accelerated venous thrombosis (16). The current working model of APS
pathogenesis invokes a “two‐hit hypothesis”, whereby the presence of aPL antibodies
(the first‐hit) would predispose to thrombosis upon exposure to a second hit such as
infection or local tissue damage (38). Antiphospholipid antibodies are postulated to
cause thrombosis via activation of endothelial cells, neutrophils, monocytes, platelets,
and the complement cascade (39), which are similarly activated in COVID‐19 infection
likely due to the cytokine storm that occurs in some patients with COVID‐19 (40). Taken
together, it would be reasonable to postulate that the presence of aPL antibodies along
14

with activation of endothelial and other immune cells could underlie the serious
vascular complications in patients with COVID‐19.
There are wide‐ranging implications if it is proven that aPL antibodies are
thrombogenic in COVID‐19. For one, testing of aPL could be recommended for critically
ill patients if it is proven that aPL positivity is a harbinger of future thrombotic events.
In addition, the patients who have detectable aPL antibodies for 12 weeks or more can
be diagnosed with APS and thus become candidates for long‐term anticoagulation,
thereby decreasing their long‐term risk of vascular events.

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, a substantial proportion of patients with COVID‐19 exhibit aPL positivity.
Follow‐up testing is needed to identify whether these antibodies persist and pose a
thrombosis risk in the future. Experimental transfer studies showing venous
thrombosis in mice injected with human IgG from COVID‐19 patients with aPL suggest a
potential pathogenicity of these antibodies (16), however, more studies are needed to
establish a causal relation between aPL positivity and thrombosis in COVID‐19.

populations: N= number of patients, Ref= Reference.

Figure 2. The percent prevalence of aPL in stroke patients with COVID‐19 as
compared to the general population. At least one aPL assay was positive in 38 of 65
(58.4%) patients with COVID‐19 and stroke. The average age in these patient series was
68.0, 66.6, 65.2, 65.0, 64.0, 61.9, and 47.6 years. The overall frequency of aPL in stroke
patients in general population was 13.5% (643/4765) in a recent review of 31 studies
(22). The age of patients in these 31 studies ranged from 2 years to 88 years. The
differences in age distribution, comorbidities, and overall health status are major
limitation of our analysis. *p <0.0001, Fisher’s exact test.
