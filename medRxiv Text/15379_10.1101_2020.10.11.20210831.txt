Abstract
The transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
becomes pandemic but presents different incidences in the world. Mathematical models
were formulated to describe the coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19) epidemic in each
country or region. At the beginning of the pandemic, many authors used the SIR (susceptible, infectious, and recovered compartments) and SEIR (including exposed compartment) models to estimate the basic reproduction number R0 for the CoViD-19 epidemic.

These simple deterministic models assumed that the only available collection of the severe
CoViD-19 cases transmitted the SARS-CoV-2 and estimated lower values for R0 , ranging
from 1.5 to 3.0. However, the major flaw in the estimation of R0 provided by the SIR
and SEIR models was that the severe CoViD-19 patients were hospitalized, and, consequently, not transmitting. Hence, we proposed a more elaborate model considering the
natural history of CoViD-19: the inclusion of asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, mild and
severe CoViD-19 compartments. The model also encompassed the fatality rate depending
on age. This SEAPMDR model estimated R0 using the severe CoViD-19 data from São
Paulo State (Brazil) and Spain, yielding higher values for R0 , that is, 6.54 and 5.88, respectively. It is worth stressing that this model assumed that severe CoViD-19 cases were
not participating in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission chain. Therefore, the SIR and SEIR
models are not suitable to estimate R0 at the beginning of the epidemic by considering
the isolated severe CoViD-19 data as transmitters.

Introduction

The first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19) was detected in China in December 2019
and spread rapidly to other countries. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)
declared the CoViD-19 a pandemic. The CoViD-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which can be transmitted by droplets that escape the
lungs by coughing or sneezing and infects humans through the nose, mouth, or eyes. In severe
cases, immune cells overreact, causing acute respiratory disease syndrome and possibly death.
At the beginning of the epidemic, we have two data sets: Severe CoViD-19 cases (those in
hospitals were tested and confirmed) and deaths. Due to the lack of mass testing (PCR and
serology), the epidemic curve consisted of severe CoViD-19 cases. Mathematical models, usually
the SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered compartments) and the simplified SIR,
were used to describe this epidemic curve. The model parameters were fitted to estimate the
basic reproduction number R0 .
In the literature, the usually estimated or assumed basic reproduction number R0 is around
2.0. For instance, Koo et al. [1] and Ferguson et al. [2] assumed R0 ranging between 1.5 and
2.6 and simulated agent-based models to predict the number of CoViD-19 cases and deaths.
However, Li et al. [3], based on the SEIR-metapopulations model, estimated the effective re2

production number Ref considering data from January 10 to February 8, arguing that the most
recent common ancestor could have occurred on November 17, 2019. The time elapsed from
November 17, 2019 (the first case) to January 10, 2020 (the first day in the estimation) is
54 days. Moreover, on January 23, 2020, Wuhan and other Hubei province cities imposed a
rigid lockdown. Hence, their estimation of Ref = 2.38 considered the range of data recorded
from 54 days after the epidemic’s onset to 16 days after the lockdown. The definition of the
basic reproduction number is “one infectious individual is introduced in a completely susceptible population without constraints (interventions)” [4]. Therefore, the estimation of R0 must
consider the severe CoViD-19 data restricted on the period without interventions.
The estimation of the basic reproduction number R0 depends on the mathematical model
[5]. To exemplify this dependency to describe the CoViD-19 epidemic, we consider the SIR and
SEIR models, plus an additional model taking into account more compartments and encompassing the fatality rate depending on the age. The latter model divides a population into two
subpopulations and split the infectious (I) compartment into asymptomatic (A), pre-diseased
or pre-symptomatic (P ), mild (M ), and severe (D) CoViD-19 compartments. This model [6],
called the SEAPMDR model, was proposed to show fewer deaths due to severe CoViD-19
cases than those provided by the SIR and SEIR models [2]. However, the SEAPMDR model
estimated higher values for R0 .
The reliable estimation of R0 is essential because this number determines the magnitude
of effort to eradicate infection. For instance, a vaccination must immunize a fraction equal
to or greater than 1 − 1/R0 of the susceptible population to eradicate a disease [4]. In [7],
analyzing vaccination as a control mechanism, if Ref is reduced lower than one, the number of
cases decreased following an exponential-type decay. Instead of vaccination, if we consider the
isolation of susceptible individuals, for a lower value of R0 as provided by the SIR and SEIR
models, a small fraction (1 − 1/R0 ) of the population must be in quarantine to control the
transmission of SRS-CoV-2. However, the SEAPMDR model considering more details of the
natural history of CoViD-19 estimated a higher value to R0 , showing that the control is not an
easy task.
As we have pointed out, only severe CoViD-19 cases were registered at the beginning of the
epidemic. In the SIR and SEIR models, the collection of severe CoViD-19 data were allocated
in the transmitting compartment I to estimate model parameters. However, in the SEAPMDR
model, the observed data are allocated in the non-transmitting compartment D. Considering
the severe CoViD-19 data collection from São Paulo State (Brazil) [8] and Spain [9], we fit the
parameters of those models to calculate R0 . We conclude that SIR and SEIR models are not
suitable to estimate the basic reproduction number. For instance, the lower estimated values

for R0 are a result of considering the data collected later after the beginning of the epidemic
and data collected after the intervention (quarantine).
The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe SIR, SEIR, and SEAPMDR
models used to estimate R0 in Section 3. Discussion is presented in Sections 4, and the conclusion in Section 5.

Material and methods

We present the SIR, SEIR, and SEAPMDR models in this section. From these models, we
obtained R0 from the steady-state analysis.

2.1

The SIR and SEIR model

In the SEIR model, the population is divided into susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious
(I), and recovered (R) subpopulations (compartments). The population’s vital dynamics is
described by the per-capita birth φ and natural mortality µ rates. In severe CoViD-19 cases,
the overreacted immune cells may result in death described by the additional mortality (fatality)
rate α.
According to the CoViD-19 natural history, susceptible individuals are infected at a rate
λS, where the force of infection λ is given by
I
λ=β ,
S
with β being the transmission rate. After a period σ −1 , where σ is the incubation rate, these
individuals enter into infectious compartment and, after a period γ −1 , where γ is the infectious
(or recovery) rate, they enter into recovered compartment. Hence, the SEIR model is described
by the dynamic system

where the total population N = S + E + I + R obeys

and this equation is accopled to the system of equations (1) to obtain numerically Ω.
The system of equations (1) is autonomous but describes non-constant population dynamics
(if φ = µ + αI/N , then N is constant). This varying population is the reason why the equation
(1) can not be used directly to obtain the basic reproduction number. In Appendix A.1, the
steady-state of the system of equations in terms of the fractions corresponding to equation (1)
was analyzed to obtain the basic reproduction number R0 .

2.2

The SEAPMDR model

One of the main aspects of CoViD-19 is increased fatality in the elder subpopulation. For this
reason, a population is divided into two groups, composed of young (60 years old or less, denoted
by subscript y) and elder (60 years old or more, denoted by subscript o) subpopulations. This
community’s vital dynamic is described by the per-capita rates of birth (φ) and mortality (µ),

and ϕ is the aging rate, that is, the flow from young subpopulation y to elder subpopulation o.
Another aspect is the presence of the pre-symptomatic individuals, that is, individuals without
symptoms transmitting SARS-CoV-2 before the onset of the disease [10].
Since we are dealing with the initial phase of the epidemic, the model does not consider
the compartments related to quarantine and mass testing. Hence, for each subpopulation j
(j = y, o), individuals are divided into six classes: susceptible Sj , exposed and incubating Ej ,
asymptomatic Aj , pre-symptomatic (or pre-diseased) individuals Pj , symptomatic individuals
with mild CoViD-19 Mj , and severe CoViD-19 Dj . However, all young and elder individuals in
classes Aj , Mj , and Dj enter into the same recovered class R (this is the 7th class, but common
to both subpopulations). Hence, the SEAPMDR model has 13 compartments.
The natural history of CoViD-19 is the same for young (j = y) and elder (j = o) subpopulations. We assume that individuals in the asymptomatic (Aj ), pre-diseased (Pj ), and a fraction
zj of mild CoViD-19 (Mj ) classes are transmitting the virus. Other infected classes ((1 − zj ) Mj
and Dj ) are under voluntary or forced isolation. Susceptible individuals are infected at a rate
λj Sj (known as the mass action law [4]), where λj is the per-capita incidence rate (or force of
infection) defined by λj = λ (δjy + ψδjo ), with λ being
λ=

(6)

where δij is the Kronecker delta, with δij = 1 if i = j, and 0, if i 6= j; and β1j , β2j and β3j are
the transmission rates, that is, the rates at which a virus encounters a susceptible people and
infects him/her. In [6], a particular model was analyzed letting zy = zo = 0 and χy = χo = 1.
Susceptible individuals are infected at a rate λj and enter into class Ej . After an average
period 1/σj in class Ej , where σj is the incubation rate, exposed individuals enter into the
asymptomatic class Aj (with probability lj ) or pre-diseased class Pj (with probability 1 −
lj ). After an average period 1/γj in class Aj , where γj is the recovery rate of asymptomatic
individuals, asymptomatic individuals acquire immunity (recovered) and enter into recovered
class R. Possibly asymptomatic individuals can manifest symptoms at the end of this period,
and a fraction 1 − χj enters into mild CoViD-19 class Mj . For symptomatic individuals, after
an average period 1/γ1j in class Pj , where γ1j is the infection rate of pre-diseased individuals,
pre-diseased individuals enter into severe CoViD-19 class Dj (with probability 1 − kj ) or mild
CoViD-19 class Mj (with probability kj ). Individuals in class Dj acquire immunity after a
period 1/γ2j , where γ2j is the recovery rate of severe CoViD-19, and enter into recovered class
R or die under the disease-induced (additional) mortality rate αj . Individuals in mild CoViD-19
class Mj acquire immunity after a period 1/γ3j , where γ3j is the recovery rate of mild CoViD-19,

which changes the signal from positive to negative at d2 Ω/dt2 = 0. Hence, Ω has upward concavity at the beginning of the epidemic and downward concavity at the ending phase of the epidemic. For instance, the number of exposed individuals E in the SEIR model initially increases
(dE/dt > 0), attains a maximum value (dE/dt = 0), and decreases since after (dE/dt < 0).
Hence, the change in the concavity occurs at the inflection time (point) τ satisfying dE/dt = 0,
that is, βIS/N − (σ + µ) E = 0.
Therefore, the accumulated severe CoViD-19 cases Ω follows a sigmoid-shape [12]. From
the first derivative of Ω given by equations (5), (3) and (11), we can retrieve the daily severe

next day in the calendar time, and so on. The inflection time τ occurs at the maximum value
of Ωd .

Ω.
When d2 Ω/dt2 > 0, the upward concavity curve of Ω increases quickly, which is possible
if Ref > 1, and one primary case generates more than one secondary case. However, when
d2 Ω/dt2 < 0, the downward concavity curve of Ω increases slowly reaching an asymptote,
which is possible if Ref < 1, and one primary case generates less than one secondary case.
Hence, the effective reproduction number Ref decreases monotonically from R0 at t = 0 up to
one at the inflection time τ (upward concavity of Ω), and maintains its decreasing trend up to
an asymptote (zero, if µ = 0), forming the phase of the downward concavity of the curve Ω.
However, Ref = 1 does not occur at the inflection time τ (see below).

Results

We estimate the transmission rate β for the SIR, SEIR, and SEAPMDR models presented in
the preceding section against the severe CoViD-19 data collection. The basic reproduction
number R0 is then calculated for São Paulo State (Brazil) and Spain.
São Paulo State has 44.6 million inhabitants (demographic density, 177/km2 ) with 15.3%
of the population comprised of elder individuals [8]. The first case was registered on February
26, and partial quarantine was implemented on March 24. The sum of the incubation (1/σ)
and pre-symptomatic (1/γ1 ) periods is 9 days, for this reason it is expected a delay of around 9
days since the infection and the CoViD-19 onset. Therefore, we estimate the basic reproduction
number considering the collected data from February 26 to April 2.
Spain has 47.4 million inhabitants (demographic density, 92.3/km2 ) with 25.8% of the population comprised of elder individuals [9]. The first case was registered on January 31, and the
lockdown was implemented on March 16. Considering a delay of around 9 days, we estimate
the basic reproduction number considering the collected data from January 31 to March 25.

To estimate the parameter β, we calculate
Sum =

n
X


2
ωi Ω (β, ti ) − Ωob (ti ) ,

(16)

i=1

where Ω (β, ti ) is the accumulated severe CoViD-19 cases calculated from the dynamic system
(SIR, SEIR and SEAPMDR models), and Ωob (ti ) is the accumulated severe CoViD-19 registered
cases at day ti , that is,
i
X
ob
Ω (ti ) =
Ωob
d (tj ) ,
j=1

where Ωob
d (tj ) is the severe CoViD-19 cases registered at day tj . We consider the same weight
for all data, that is, we let ωi = 1. The value of β that minimizes Sum is the fitted value.
Instead of applying the least square estimation method, we calculate the sum of the squared
differences between the calculated Ω and the observed data Ωob . The reason behind this simplification relies on the fitting of the model parameter based on a unique observed variable
(Ω) of the dynamic system, which is not appropriate [13]. However, this simplified method
of parameter evaluation does not provide uncertainties associated with the parameters. The
effects of these uncertainties on the epidemic can be assessed by the global sensitivity analysis
[14].
Once the transmission rate β is estimated, we calculate R0 using equations (A.7), (A.3) and
(B.8) for, respectively, SIR, SEIR and SEAPMDR models. Notice that these three expressions
for R0 give secondary cases produced by one primary case introduced in a completely susceptible
population. Notice that the fatality rate α affects R0 in the SIR and SEIR models, but not in
the SEAPMDR model. The reason behind it is the severe CoViD-19 cases transmitting in the
SIR and SEIR models but not in the SEAPMDR model. Hence, in the latter model, one of the
sources of uncertainties is removed.

3.1

The SIR model

To estimate the transmission rate, we use equation (16) and Ω given by equation (5). The
model parameters are γ = 1/10, α = 0.002 and, for São Paulo State, φ = µ = 1/(78.4 × 365)
and, for Spain, φ = µ = 1/(83.4 × 365) (all in days−1 ). The value γ = 1/10 days−1 in somehow
is an average value among γ, γ1 , γ2 , and γ3 in the SEAPMDR model (see Table 1). The
transmission rate β is estimated, and the basic reproduction number R0 is calculated using
equation (A.7). We estimate the basic reproduction number using equation (4) with different

For the data collected from São Paulo State, we obtained for I(0) = 1, R0 = 3.14 with

conditions I(0) = 1 (continuous curve), 10 (dashed curve), and 25 (dashed and dotted curve).
We observe that the larger the value of I(0), the small is the estimated R0 . For instance, R0
with I(0) = 100 for São Paulo State is about half that with I(0) = 1. By the stringent definition
of R0 , we must consider I(0) = 1. However, the initial condition I(0) > 1 mimics the first case
of CoViD-19 occurring earlier than the time t = 0. The Singapore University of Technology and
Design [15] estimated R0 using I(0) = 100 for different countries, underestimating the basic
reproduction number.
Let us illustrate the curves Ω, Ωd , I and Ref for the SIR model in the natural (occurring
without any control) epidemic. Equations (5), (14) and (15) are used to obtain Ω, Ωd and

The maximum value of Ωd occurs at t = 78 (calendar time May 14), equal to the calculated

when Ref = 1.
When α > 0, the steady-state fraction of the susceptible individuals s∗ is given by equation
(A.10), and the effective reproduction number Ref given by equation (15) is an approximated
value. However, when α = 0, s∗ is given by equation (A.12), and Ref = R0 S/N , with R0 =
β/γ + φ + α. Using the same model parameters values and initial conditions in Figure 2, the
maximum values for Ωd and I occurred at, respectively, t = 77 and 84, the inflection time is
τ = 77, and Ref = 1 occurred at t = 84. For α = 0, we have R0 = 3.20, which is 2% higher
than R0 = 3.14. Therefore, Ref = 1 occurs at the maximum value (peak) of the epidemic curve
I.

3.2

The SEIR model

To estimate the transmission rate, we use equation (16) and Ω given by equation (3). The model
parameters are those used in the SIR model: γ = 1/10, α = 0.002, and, for São Paulo State,
φ = µ = 1/(78.4×365) and, for Spain, φ = µ = 1/(83.4×365) (all in days−1 ). For the additional
parameter, we let σ = 1/5 days−1 (see Table 1). The transmission rate β is estimated, and
the basic reproduction number R0 is calculated using equation (A.7). We estimate the basic
reproduction number using equation (1) with the initial conditions S(0) = N0 , E(0) = 0,
R(0) = 0, and varying I(0).
For the data collected from São Paulo State, with S(0) = 44.6 million, we obtained for
I(0) = 1, R0 = 7.25 with Sum = 1.36 × 106 , for I(0) = 10, R0 = 4.7 with Sum = 4.52 × 105 , for
I(0) = 25, R0 = 3.82 with Sum = 1 × 106 , and for I(0) = 100, R0 = 2.6 with Sum = 3.68 × 106 .
The lowest Sum occurs when R0 = 4.7.
For the data collected from Spain, with S(0) = 47.4 million, we obtained for I(0) = 1,
R0 = 6.27 with Sum = 2.39×108 , for I(0) = 10, R0 = 4.75 with Sum = 7.64×107 , for I(0) = 25,
R0 = 4.21 with Sum = 2.21 × 108 , and for I(0) = 100, R0 = 3.38 with Sum = 7.57 × 108 . The
lowest Sum occurs when R0 = 4.75.
Figure 3 shows the estimated curve Ω for São Paulo (a) and Spain (b) with three different
initial conditions (I(0) = 1, 10, and 25).

dynamic systems (4) or (1) against the accumulated severe CoViD-19 cases. For this reason,
the estimated β must be different in the SIR and SEIR models.
Comparing with the estimated R0 provided by the SIR model, we observe that the SEIR
model estimated with a higher value. Let us assess the role played by the incubation period
σ −1 in the SEIR model considering the initial conditions S(0) = N0 , E(0) = 0, I(0) = 1, and
R(0) = 0. For σ −1 = 10 days, R0 = 11.27 with Sum = 1.15 × 106 , for σ −1 = 1 day, R0 = 3.92
with Sum = 8.92 × 105 , for σ −1 = 10−1 days (2.4 hours), R0 = 3.2 with Sum = 8.06 × 105 ,
and for σ −1 = 10−3 days (1.44 minutes), R0 = 3.14 with Sum = 7.96 × 105 . As σ −1 decreases
(σ increases), R0 approaches (when σ → ∞) to that estimated by the SIR model (R0 = 3.14).
By disregarding the incubation period, the SIR model provides a relatively lower estimation
for R0 in comparison with the SEIR model. To overcome this period and fit the same set of
the severe CoViD-19 cases, the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 must be much higher in the
SEIR than in the SIR model. Therefore, the inclusion of the exposed individuals delays the
onset of disease (or the entering into an infectious compartment), and the virus must infect
more individuals (increased R0 ).

3.3

The SEAPMDR model

To estimate the transmission rates, we consider βy = β1y = β2y = β3y and βo = β1o = β2o =
β3o = ψβy , and we use equation (16) and Ω given by equation (11). The values for the model
parameters are those given in Table 1. The basic reproduction number R0 is calculated using
equation (12).

Suppose we let zy = zo = 0 (mild CoViD-19 cases do not transmit) and χy = χo = 1
(asymptomatic individuals do not relapse to mild CoViD-19). In that case, the estimated basic
reproduction number is R0 = 6.26 for São Paulo State, with Sum = 7.56 × 105 , and R0 = 5.67
for Spain, with Sum = 1.18 × 108 .
For the SEIR model, let us consider as the initial conditions E(0) = 50 (sum of Ey (0) +
Eo (0)), I(0) = 1 and R(0) = 0, and S(0) = 44.6 million for São Paulo State and S(0) = 47.4
million for Spain. The estimated basic reproduction number for São Paulo State is R0 = 3.53
with Sum = 1.56 × 106 and for Spain, R0 = 4.07 with Sum = 2.53 × 108 .

Discussion

There are different manners to define an epidemic curve. For instance, one possible definition
is the curve formed by those positive for serological and PCR tests. However, in the early
phase of the epidemic, the CoViD-19 epidemic curve must be defined by severe cases, which are
the only available data. In the SEAPMDR model, the CoViD-19 epidemic curve was retrieved
by estimating the transmission rates of asymptomatic, pre-diseased, and a fraction of mild
classes. In [11], it was shown that the ratio between non-apparent (sum of compartments E,
A, and P ) and apparent (sum of compartments M and D) CoViD-19 is around 24, showing
that SARS-CoV-2 is being transmitted by a huge number of hidden cases.

In the SEAPMDR model, the initial conditions E(0) = 50 and I(0) = 1 were supplied to
the dynamic system, resulting in R0 = 6.54 (São Paulo State) and R0 = 5.88 (Spain), higher
than estimations usually accepted. Instead of comparing the SIR model, let us compare the
SEIR model with the same initial conditions supplied to the SEAPMDR model. The estimated
basic reproduction number for São Paulo State was R0 = 3.92, and for Spain, R0 = 4.41.
Comparing SIR, SEIR, and SEAPMDR models, as the model incorporates more aspects of
the natural history of the infection [17], higher becomes the estimation of R0 . There is no other
alternative for the SIR and SEIR models except considering severe CoViD-19 cases as infective.
However, in the SEAPMDR model, the asymptomatic (A), pre-diseased (P ), and a fraction of
mild CoViD-19 (M ) individuals are transmitting SARS-CoV-2, but the severe CoViD-19 (D)
individuals are isolated and do not contribute, except to infect the hospital staff [11].
As we have pointed out, at the beginning and also in the early phase of the CoViD-19
epidemic, only hospitalized severe CoViD-19 cases were registered after the confirmation by
serological and or PCR tests. These individuals are isolated in hospitals (receiving treatment)
or discharged from hospitals but recommend being isolated in their homes. Then, somehow
the majority of these individuals are not participating in the populational SARS-CoV-2 chain
transmission.
In the SEAPMDR model, there are several infectious classes, but the severe CoViD-19
cases do not transmit the SARS-CoV-2, for this reason, R0 does not depend on the additional
mortality rates αy and αo (see equations (12) and (13)). On the other hand, in the SIR and
SEIR models, there is only one infectious class, and R0 depends on the additional mortality
rate α (see equations (A.7) and (A.3)). Notice that in the SIR and SEIR models, the unique
way to estimate the transmission rate is that severe covid-9 cases form the infective class I.
Besides the consideration of the CoViD-19 data, we discuss the magnitude of R0 . Both SIR
and SEIR models provided lower estimates for R0 than the SEAPMDR model.
As we have pointed out, Li et al. [3] estimated Ref = 2.38 using the range of data recorded
from 54 days after the epidemic’s onset to 16 days after the lockdown. From Figure 2b corresponding to the SIR model with R0 = 3.14 (simulation time t = 0), we observe that Ref ' R0
up to the simulation time t = 50 initiates a quick decreasing phase at t = 60. However, for
the SEAPMDR model without interventions, R0 = 6.54 decreases to Ref = 5.41 at simulation
time t = 50. However, the partial quarantine was introduced on March 24 (t = 27), and 16
days later on April 9 (t = 45), we have Ref = 2.92 considering protective measures in the
SEAPMDR model (see [16]). This value is close to that estimated by Li et al., remembering
that they did not take the initial time of estimation when the first case of CoViD-19 occurred.

upward concavity) followed by a slow increase (Ref < 1, with downward concavity), where Ref

accumulated data set was divided by 4. The observed severe CoViD-19 data carry on the effects
of the quarantine and the protective measures (face mask, washing hands with alcohol and gel,
social distancing, etc.) adopted by individuals that reduced the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
In São Paulo State, a partial quarantine was introduced on March 24 isolating approximately
53% of the population [8], and a rigid lockdown in Spain was introduced on March 16 isolating
perhaps 90% or more.

Figure 5: The daily (bars) and the accumulated (points) severe covid-19 cases in São Paulo
State (a) and Spain (b), where A indicates the time at which quarantine was introduced, and
B indicates the inflection time.
Let us define the threshold of the proportion in isolation in a population as q th = 1 − 1/R0 .
If the proportion in quarantine q is higher than q th , we must have Ref < 1, and the observed
accumulated CoViD-19 cases must present downward concavity and upward concavity if q < q th .
For São Paulo State, we have q = 0.53. At Ref = 1, we have the inflection time (change from
upward to downward concavity). Using the value of R0 estimated in the preceding section,
for the SIR model (R0 estimated with I(0) = 1) we have q th = 0.68 for São Paulo State, and
q th = 0.66 for Spain. For the SEAPMDR model, we have q th = 0.85 for São Paulo State, and
q th = 0.83 for Spain. The SEAPMDR model shows that isolating 85% in the population or

more controls the epidemic, but the SIR model predicts less proportion of isolation, 68% or
more.
As shown in Figure 5, the inflection time occurred approximately on June 10 in São Paulo
State and on March 26 in Spain. The elapsed time between the implementation of quarantine
(A) and the inflection time (B) is 78 days in São Paulo State and 10 days in Spain. From Figure
2, for São Paulo State using the SIR model, the period from the beginning of the epidemic until
the inflection time was 78 days. This period, which was calculated for the natural epidemic,
must be lesser when considering the epidemic under isolation and protective measures. Hence,
the actual R0 must be higher than 3.14. However, if we consider R0 = 2.11 estimated from the
SIR model using I(0) = 25, we obtain q th = 0.53 for São Paulo State resulting in q = q th . In
other words, the inflection time must occur 9 days later, when we have Ref = 1 (the effects
of any intervention appear 9 days later). As a consequence, the observed accumulated severe
CoViD-19 cases must be quite similar to that observed in Spain. Notice that the inflection time
occurred 10 days after the implementation of lockdown in Spain. The long time to reach the
inflection time in São Paulo State (78 days) may indicate that the SIR model underestimated
R0 , and that estimated by the SEAPMDR model seems to be more reliable.
Finally, the SEAPMDR model proposed by Yang et al. [6] at the beginning of the CoViD-19
epidemic deserves some considerations. At the beginning of the epidemic, the severe acute respiratory syndrome cases were hospitalized and confirmed as CoViD-19 after some tests (many
patients died and were diagnosed post mortem as CoViD-19 by a test). This disease’s rapid
spread indicated that possibly asymptomatic and mild CoViD-19 cases transmitted SARS-CoV2 once severe CoViD-19 patients were isolated in hospitals. Additionally, the model considered
pre-symptomatic individuals transmitting infection, which was confirmed later. Besides these
aspects, the model considered the increased fatality among elder individuals. Minimalist incorporation of this disease’s severity in the model divided the population into two groups: young
(under 60 years old) and elder (above 60 years old) individuals. (Notably, the consideration
of two subpopulations by the SEAPMDR model predicted three times lower number of deaths
than that indicated in [2].) To estimate the basic reproduction number, the authors restricted
data collection during the period without any control.

Conclusion

This work’s goal was to demonstrate that the early applied SIR and SEIR models underestimated R0 misusing the severe CoVid-19 data collection. For this reason, we formulated the

SEAPMDR model incorporating essential aspects related to the natural history of the infection.
For instance, the incorporation of the asymptomatic and pre-diseased individuals, mild CoViD19 cases, and different fatality rates depending on age must improve the mathematical model
to describe the CoViD-19 epidemic. Additionally, these more elaborated models could consider
the severe CoViD-19 cases being isolated, and SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by asymptomatic
and pre-diseased individuals, for instance. Hence, the SEAPMDR must provide a more accurate
estimation of R0 . Specifically, when the severe CoViD-19 cases may not transmit SARS-CoV-2
populationally, the SIR and SEIR models structured in only one infectious compartment are
not suitable to estimate the basic reproduction number R0 . It is worth stressing that the reliable estimation of R0 must consider the time range from the first case to the last case before
the first case affected by interventions.

The steady-state analysis of the SIR and SEIR models

We present the analysis of the SIR and SEIR models.

The SEIR model

The system of equations (1) does not reach a steady-state, except if φ = µ + αI/N . However,
the system (1) in terms of the fractions attains steady-state. Defining the fraction x = X/N ,

with s + e + i + r = 1, hence, the equation for r can be decoupled from the system, through
r = 1 − e − s − i. Notice that d (s + e + i + r) /dt = 0, and the system of equations in terms
of fractions attain a steady state.
The system of equations (A.1), dropping out the decoupled equation for r, has two equilibrium points: The trivial (disease-free) equilibrium point P 0 = (s̄ = 1, ē = 0, ı̄ = 0) and nontrivial (epidemic) equilibrium point P ∗ = (s̄ = s∗ , ē = e∗ , ı̄ = i∗ ).
Let us assess the stability of P 0 by applying the next generation matrix theory considering
the vector of variables x = (e, i) [18]. The next generation matrix is constructed considering
a subsystem of equation (9) taking into account the state-at-infection (e) and the states-ofinfectiousness (i) [18], resulting in x = (e, i). In a matrix form, the subsystem is written
as

The characteristic equation corresponding to F V −1 is
κ 2 − R0 κ = 0,
and the spectral radius ρ (F V −1 ) = R0 , which is equal to the sum of the coefficients.
Both procedures resulted in the same threshold, hence, according to [21], the inverse of
the reduced reproduction number R0 given by equation (A.3) is a function of the fraction of
susceptible individuals at endemic equilibrium s∗ through
s∗ =

Hence, we can define the effective reproduction number Ref as
Ref ≈ R0 s,

(A.5)

which depends on time, with Ref = R0 at t = 0 (s = 1), and when attains steady-state
(Ref = 1), we have s∗ = 1/R0 . Notice that Ref = R0 s when α = 0 (see below for the SIR
model),

When R0 > 1, we have P2 (1) < 0 (the condition γ + φ > α is satisfied because γ > α), and the
two positive roots of P2 (i) are such that 0 < i∗1 < 1 < i∗2 . Hence the small root i∗1 is biologically
feasible. When R0 = 1, we have i∗1 = 0 and i∗2 > 1, hence i∗1 = 0 is biologically feasible. When
R0 < 1, we have i∗1 < 0 and i∗2 > 1, hence i∗1 = 0 is biologically feasible. Therefore, the small
root i∗1 , which is biologically feasible, assumes a negative value for R0 < 1, zero at R0 = 1, and
a positive value but lower than 1 for R0 > 1. The small root of P2 (i) is given by

In this particular case, we have Re = R0 s. Hence, for α > 0, comparing equations (A.8) and
(A.10), we notice that s∗ has a complex dependency with R0 , not simply 1/R0 .
Let us assess the stability of the system of equations (A.6) linearized around the trivial equilibrium point P 0 = (s̄ = 1, ı̄ = 0). The Jacobian matrix J evaluated at the trivial equilibrium
point P 0 is

with the eigenvalues ρ1 = −φ and ρ2 = (γ + φ + α) (R0 − 1), where the basic reproduction
number R0 is given by (A.7). Hence, P 0 is locally asymptotically stable if R0 < 1. Hence, the
linearized system around P 0 has a trajectory for i given by
i = Ae−φt + Be(γ+φ+α)(R0 −1)t ,

(A.13)

where A and B are arbitrary values determined by the initial conditions.
When R0 > 1, an introduction of one infectious individual disestablishes the trivial equilibrium point P 0 , and the unique positive eigenvalue gives the leaving trajectory. Hence, the
escaping trajectory follows e(γ+φ+α)(R0 −1)t in the vicinity of P 0 towards the non-trivial equilibrium point P ∗ . Maidana and Yang [22] provided an example of trajectories (travelling waves)
linking P 0 towards P ∗ considering a spatial model for the dengue transmission.
To establish a relationship with the linearized system of equations in terms of the fractions,
the system of equations (4), using R = N − I − S, is rewritten as
(

with the basic reproduction number R0 being given by equation (A.7) changing φ by µ, that
is, R0 = β/ (γ + µ + α).
Let us analyze the system of equations (A.14) at two boundaries. Let us assume that the
first case of CoViD-19 is introduced at t = 0, that is, the initial conditions supplied to equation
(A.14) are S(0) = N − 1 and I(0) = 1. For a large population, we can approximate S ∼ N ,

and I → I ∗ = i∗ N , where i∗ and s∗ are given by equations (A.11) and (A.12), respectively.
Hence, when α = 0, at t = 0, Ref = R0 , and when t → ∞ (steady-state), Ref = 1 (see equation
(A.12)), from which we retrieve the well known relationship s∗ = 1/R0 [4].
Therefore, based on Ref given by equation (A.15) when φ = µ and α = 0, the basic reproduction number R0 obtained from mathematical modelings provides two useful information:
At the beginning of the epidemic (t = 0), R0 gives the magnitude of the initial takeoff of the
epidemic, and when epidemic reaches the steady-state (after many waves of the epidemic, that
is, t → ∞), R0 measures its severity providing the fraction of susceptible individuals, that
is, s∗ = 1/R0 . Between these two extremes, the effective reproduction number Ref dictates
the course of an epidemic, which follows decaying oscillations around Ref = 1 [7]. It is worth
stressing that Ref given by equation (A.15) is valid only when φ = µ and α = 0, and when one
of these conditions is not valid, Ref given by equation (A.15) can be used as an approximated
value.
From equation (A.16), the solution for I is e(γ+µ+α)(R0 −1)t , which is equal to equation (A.13)
when A = 0 and B = 1.

The steady-state analysis of the SEAPMDR model

The system of equations (7), (8) and (9) does not reach steady state, except if φ = µ +
(αy Dy + αo Do ) /N , when the total size of the population is constant. However, the system
of equations (7), (8) and (9) in term of fractions attains steady-state. Defining the fraction
xj = Xj /N , for j = y, o, with Xj = {Sj , Ej , Aj , Pj , Mj , Dj , R}, we have

This new system of equations has a steady-state, that is, the number of individuals in all classes
varies with time. However, their fractions attain a steady-state (the sum of derivatives of all
classes is zero).

radius ρ (F V −1 ) is the biggest solution of a third-degree polynomial, not easy to evaluate. The
procedure proposed in [19] allows us to obtain the threshold R0 as the sum of coefficients of
the characteristic equation, where R0 is the basic reproduction number given by equation (12)
in the main text. Hence, the trivial equilibrium point P 0 is locally asymptotically stable if
R0 < 1.
