Abstract

23

Introduction and aims: This international survey was performed to evaluate the cumulative

24

incidence of nosocomial novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among healthcare

25

professionals during endoscopic procedures.

26

Methods: We performed an international web-based self-reported questionnaire survey.

27

Participants completed the questionnaires every week for 12 weeks. The questionnaire elicited

28

responses regarding the development of COVID-19 and details of the PPE used.

29

Results: All 483 participants were included in the analysis. Participants had a mean age of 42.3

30

years and comprised 68.3% males. The geographic distribution of the study population was Asia

31

(89.2%), Europe (2.9%), North and South America (4.8%), Oceania (0.6%), and Africa (1.5%).

32

The most common endoscopy-related role of the participants was endoscopist (78.7%), and

33

74.5% had > 10 years of experience. Fourteen participants had performed 83 endoscopic

34

procedures in patients positive for COVID-19. During the mean follow-up period of 4.95 weeks,

35

there were no cases of COVID-19 when treating COVID-19 positive patients. The most common

36

PPE used by participants treating patients with COVID-19 was a surgical mask plus N95 mask

37

plus face shield, goggles, cap, long-sleeved isolation gown, and single pair of gloves. The most

38

common PPE used by participants treating patients without COVID-19 was a surgical mask, no

39

face shield but goggles, cap, long-sleeved isolation gown, and single pair of gloves during all

40

endoscopic procedures.

41

Conclusions: The risk of COVID-19 transmission during any endoscopic procedure was low in

42

clinical practice.

Introduction

46

The morbidity and mortality of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are increasing

47

worldwide. The virus responsible for this disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome

48

coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is highly infectious and causes nosocomial infection in healthcare

49

professionals [1]. Especially, endoscopic procedures have a potentially high risk for healthcare

50

professionals due to transmission via aerosol from COVID-19 patients [2-7]. In addition, SARS-

51

CoV-2 has also been detected in stool specimens, suggesting a possible risk of fecal–oral

52

transmission [8], similar to SARS [9,10]. However, although endoscopic procedures pose a risk

53

of COVID-19 transmission, they are often necessary for diagnosis and treatment of

54

gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, malignancies, obstructive jaundice, and cholangitis.

55

Recently, a research group in Italy [11] and the World Endoscopy Organization [12] performed a

56

hospital-based email questionnaire survey among endoscopy units and clarified the current status

57

of personal protective equipment (PPE) use when performing endoscopic procedures in patients

58

with a positive diagnosis or suspected COVID-19. Although these data represent very important

59

initial reports, we considered the further necessity of data regarding the type of PPE used during

60

endoscopic procedures in patients with different risks of COVID-19 transmission. The

61

incidences of SARS-CoV-2 genomic mutations and clinical COVID-19 reportedly vary among

62

geographic regions [13]. Therefore, we designed an international web-based questionnaire

63

survey for endoscopy-related healthcare professionals (UMIN000040162) consisting of 16

64

questions regarding the use of PPE, such as surgical masks, face shields, goggles, gowns, and

65

gloves. The aims of this survey were to evaluate cumulative short-term incidence rates of

66

COVID-19 and to share information among healthcare providers regarding the appropriate PPE

67

use to prevent COVID-19 transmission.

Design and participants

71

We performed an international web-based questionnaire survey among endoscopy-related

72

healthcare professionals, including endoscopists, nurses, laboratory technicians, and endoscopy

73

reprocessing technicians working in the endoscopy suite. Participants were invited to join the

74

survey by the principal investigators related to personal communication and World Endoscopy

75

Organization volunteer members and were enrolled by snow-ball sampling methods. The survey

76

began on April 15, 2020 and ended on August 8, 2020. Participants completed web-based

77

questionnaires every week for 12 weeks, prompted by automated reminder emails using Google

78

Forms®. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Tokyo Hospital

79

(No. 2020046NI).

80

Web-based questionnaire

81

The web-based questionnaire included items regarding COVID-19 development, age, sex, role

82

(endoscopist, nurse, laboratory technician, endoscopy reprocessing technician), geographical

83

area (North America, South America, Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania), number of years of

84

experience, PPE (mask and face shield, goggles and face shield, cap, gown, gloves), endoscopic

85

procedures (esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), colonoscopy, endoscopic retrograde

86

cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), endoscopic hemostasis,

87

endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD)) performed in patients with and without confirmed

88

COVID-19, and PPE replacement frequency (After each procedure, every day, 1-7day, every

89

week). N95 masks were defined as N95 (United States NIOSH-42CFR84), FFP2 (Europe EN

90

149-2001), KN95 (China GB2626-2006), P2 (Australia/New Zealand AS/NZA 1716:2012),

93

PPE evaluation

94

We evaluated each PPE for protection of the mouth, eyes, body, and hands and defined each as

95

mask and face shield, goggles and face shield, cap and gown, and gloves. We also defined the

96

minimum and maximum use of each PPE category as follows. For the mask and face shield

97

category, the minimum PPE use consisted of a surgical mask, followed by N95 mask, and the

98

maximum was N95 mask plus face shield. Regarding goggles and face shields, the minimum was

99

no goggles or face shield, followed by face shield but no goggles, and goggles but no face shield;

100

the maximum PPE was use of both goggles and face shield. For caps, the minimum and

101

maximum were no use and use of a cap, respectively. Regarding gowns, the minimum was short-

102

sleeved vinyl-type gown, followed by short-sleeved vinyl-type gown plus arm covers, and long-

103

sleeved vinyl-type gown; the maximum was long-sleeved isolation-type gown. For gloves, the

104

minimum and maximum uses were a single pair and double pair of gloves, respectively.

105

Statistics

106

The full analysis set included participants who had not been diagnosed with COVID-19 at

107

baseline to exclude potential cases of community-acquired or nosocomial infection not related to

108

endoscopic procedures. The primary outcome was the incidence of COVID-19 when treating

109

COVID-19 positive patients, defined as a self-reported positive PCR test in the absence of close

110

contact with an infected subject other than patients among participants who performed

111

endoscopic procedures for COVID-19-positive patients; this was censored at the date of

112

completion of the final questionnaire. The secondary outcome was the incidence of COVID-19

113

when treating patients without confirmed COVID-19.

114

The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 over a

115

12-week period from the start to questionnaire response was calculated. Number of COVID-19

116

new cases were evaluated using public site data (https://github.com/owid/covid-19-

117

data/tree/master/public/data). The statistical analyses were performed using SAS software

118

(version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

120

Results

121

From April 15 to August 8, 2020, a total of 488 participants were invited to join the survey. After

122

excluding 5 because of a diagnosis of COVID-19 at baseline, 483 participants were included in

123

the analysis. Of 483 participants, 103 participants (21.3%) completed the questionnaire during

124

the 12 weeks of the study. Number of COVID-19 new cases during study period is shown in

125

Figure 1.

Participant characteristics and endoscopic procedures

127

The participants had a mean age of 42.3 years and comprised 68.3% (330/483) males. The

128

distribution according to geographic area was as follows: Asia (89.2%), Europe (2.9%), North

129

and South America (4.8%), Oceania (0.6%), and Africa (1.5%). The most common endoscopy-

130

related role of the participants was endoscopist (78.7%), and 74.5% had more than 10 years of

131

experience. The participants had performed EGD (401), colonoscopy (342), ERCP and EUS

132

139

Fourteen participants performed 83 endoscopic procedures in patients with a positive diagnosis

140

of COVID-19. None of these participants developed COVID-19 over the mean follow-up period

141

of 4.95 weeks (Figure 3A). The distribution according to geographic area was as follows: Asia,

142

43%; Europe, 22%; North and South America, 21%; Oceania, 7%; and Africa, 7%. The

143

procedures performed were EGD by 11 participants, colonoscopy by 7, ERCP and EUS by 10,

144

hemostasis during EGD by 6, hemostasis during colonoscopy by 3, and upper GI ESD by 2. The

145

details are shown in Table 2.

146

The minimum PPE used was a surgical mask (21%), face shield but no goggles (14%), no cap

147

(43%), short-sleeved vinyl-type gown (7%), and single pair of gloves (64%). The most common

Discussion

169

In this international questionnaire survey, we found that the transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2

170

during endoscopic procedures was not high in appropriate PPE settings. In addition, our data

171

suggest that the minimum PPE to prevent the development of COVID-19 was less than expected.

172

In contrast to previous concerns, none of participant developed COVID-19 when treating

173

COVID-19 positive patients and one participant developed COVID-19 when treating patients

174

without confirmed COVID-19. There are two possible explanations for this discrepancy. First,

175

most cases of nosocomial COVID-19 may occur when PPE is absent or insufficient in situations

176

where healthcare professionals are unaware of the infection status of the patient. A recent

177

European study also reported a low risk of COVID-19 transmission in endoscopy settings [14],

178

which supported our findings. Another reason for the low incidence rate of COVID-19 in our

179

study may be related to the procedure time and distance between the patient and healthcare

180

professionals compared with other medical practices in the infectious ward. Most EGDs and

181

colonoscopies take minutes to tens of minutes; upper and lower GI hemostasis and ERCP are

182

completed within 1 hour, and even the longest ESD procedures are completed within a few

183

hours. In addition, a certain distance is maintained between the patient and endoscopist, and no

184

close contact with the patient is necessary.

185

The results of our survey identified the minimum PPE used during endoscopic procedures in

186

patients diagnosed with COVID-19. With regard to masks, a surgical mask may have the

187

potential to reduce COVID-19 transmission, it was consistent with previous observations [15].

188

The use of a face shield or goggles may help prevent transmission risk via the eyes. Therefore,

189

we suggested the use of a surgical mask, or a face shield or goggles, any type of long-sleeved

190

gown, and a single pair of gloves as the minimum PPE when performing EGD, colonoscopy,

191

ERCP and EUS, upper and lower GI hemostasis, and upper GI ESD procedures in COVID-19-

192

positive patients. However, further studies to collect data from more endoscopic procedures

193

conducted in patients with a COVID-19 over longer-term observation periods are needed to

194

elucidate the appropriate PPE to prevent the development of COVID-19 related to endoscopic

195

procedures.

196

In contrast to many health care providers concerns, replacement frequencies of mask, cap, and

197

gown were maintained at the similar levels throughout the study period (Figure 4). The most

198

common timing to replacement was "every day" in mask and cap, and "after each procedure" in

199

gown, respectively.

200

This was the first longitudinal international survey to evaluate the incidence of nosocomial

201

COVID-19 among healthcare professionals involved in endoscopic procedures. Our survey

202

included participant from all continents except Antarctica and included both areas with high and

203

low rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we used a solid questionnaire survey system to

204

collect high-quality questionnaire data. Repeat questionnaire surveys will enable us to perform

205

survival analyses of patients with COVID-19. However, our study had some limitations. First,

206

the primary outcome data were collected using self-reported questionnaires only, and we did not

207

perform additional surveys, such as collection of PCR or computed tomography data, to confirm

208

the events to protect the privacy of the participants. In addition, we may have missed some

209

COVID-19 events because some participants developed severe pneumonia and did not respond

210

to the survey during the follow-up period. However, we invited participants using a personal

211

private network among academic experts, and we are continuously collecting data. Therefore, we

212

believe the data to be both reliable and of high quality. Second, differential diagnosis of

213

community-acquired and endoscopy-related SARS-CoV-2 infections may be difficult. Third, our

214

primary outcome definition was COVID-19 development, not COVID-19 pneumonia, or other

215

symptoms development.

216

In conclusion, the risk of COVID-19 transmission during endoscopic procedures, including

217

EGD, colonoscopy, ERCP and EUS, upper and lower GI hemostasis, and upper GI ESD, was

218

low in PPE settings.
