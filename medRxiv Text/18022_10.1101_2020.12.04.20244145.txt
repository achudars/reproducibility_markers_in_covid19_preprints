ABSTRACT
Objectives: Fatigue is a pervasive clinical symptom for many infected with respiratory
viruses such as influenza or coronaviruses. Prior evidence from influenza and coronavirus
epidemics suggest that fatigue symptomology may continue beyond the acute phase, lasting
for several months to several years post-discharge. This systematic review aimed to
examine long-term fatigue prevalence among survivors and among communities, as well as
investigate the current evidence for associated factors.

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Setting: Hospitalised and community samples.

Participants: Patient populations with a confirmed diagnosis of a named influenza virus or
coronavirus.

Main outcomes measured: Fatigue, fatigue syndromes
Results: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria for a pooled prevalence analysis and five
studies were identified as eligible for a means differences analysis. A fatigue prevalence of
41% (95% CI 0.299-0.488) was found among a total population of 1,310. Using the ‘vitality’

subscale of the SF-36 as a proxy for fatigue, the estimate for means differences indicated a
lower mean vitality score for survivors compared to population norms (M -1.523, CI -13.53 –
10.48), although this was not significant (p = 0.803). The most common associations with
fatigue were PTSD, depression and anxiety, female gender and higher age.

Conclusions: This study reveals that a significant proportion of survivors (41%) experienced
fatigue following their recovery from novel respiratory viruses such as SARS, MERS, SARSCoV2 or influenza and that this fatigue can be long-lasting. Also, some factors such as
female gender and psychological factors may contribute to continuing fatigue outcomes for
this population.

Strengths and limitations: (a) this study provides support for long-term fatigue outcomes in
people with a confirmed influenza, SARS, MERS, SARS-CoV2 virus infection (b) the study
suggests individual, psychological and social factors are associated with fatigue, (c) findings
are limited by the availability of fatigue data and lack of pre-morbid fatigue information; (d) a
meta-analysis on the associations was prohibited by the small number of studies
investigating long-term fatigue correlates and (e) the heterogeneity of the studies (>75%)
suggests the pooled estimates should be interpreted with caution.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus family such as SARS-CoV Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle
East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and SARS-CoV-2 are single-strand RNA viruses,
characterised by severe upper respiratory tract infections. Influenza viruses can also result
in severe respiratory symptoms. A novel A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza emerged in humans in
2009 and before this other strains, originating in animals or birds had circulated, including
the influenza virus A subtype H2N2 and HPAI A(H5N1). Each has spread rapidly worldwide

with considerable impact on mortality. The case fatality rate for SARS during the course of
the outbreak (2002 - 2004) was 9.7% (Petersen et al., 2020). For MERS an estimated 2,494
cases were detected since its identification in 2012, with a fatality rate of 34.4% (Bradley &
Bryan, 2019). H3N2 mortality ranged from 0.03% and over 18,400 worldwide deaths were
attributed to H1N1 (WHO, 2015). H2N2 had a fatality rate of 1.9/10,000 population (Viboud
et al., 2015). Approximately 861 laboratory-confirmed cases of A(H5N1) have been reported
(WHO, 2020) and for SARS-CoV2 current worldwide estimates are reported to be
67,965,261 cases (ECDC, 2020). Wide-ranging clinical indicators have been observed for
some infectious viruses from asymptomatic (Leung, Xu, Ip, & Cowling, 2015) to the most
severe, potentially resulting in respiratory distress or viral pneumonia. Outcomes are
dependent upon variables such as age and physical comorbidities. Fatigue is among the
most common presenting symptom alongside high fever, myalgia, cough and
breathlessness. Clinical observations for patients infected with viruses such as SARS have
indicated fatigue in 78% of patients admitted to hospital (Han et al., 2003). Meta-analyses of
the current SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus indicates prevalence to be between 22-61.9%
(Qiu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) and fatigue has been found to be associated with
exacerbated outcomes, including acute respiratory distress and mortality. A study
investigating COVID-19 found that, compared with survivors, more severe fatigue was
associated with mortality in a small number of patients admitted to an ICU (Wang, Shu, Ran,
Xie, & Zhang, 2020).

Fatigue may be characterised as tiredness or exhaustion as a result of physical or mental
exertion or as a result of an illness or disease (Dittner, Wessely, & Brown, 2004). The
experience of fatigue is common and is usually short-lived but, for a small number of people,
it can become long-lasting, associated with a number of impairments in daily living and
reduced quality of life (Dittner et al., 2004).

Post-viral fatigue has been linked to viruses including Epstein-Barr and Q Fever, while
chronic fatigue has been investigated in survivors of SARS, MERS and H1N1. Chronic
fatigue syndrome has been associated with the H1N1 virus for instance (Magnus et al.,
2015) and, in 233 SARS survivors, 43% had chronic fatigue, with around 27% fulfilling the
criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome 3 years post-infection (Lam et al., 2009). A metaanalysis comparing SARS, MERS and COVID-19 found a post-illness fatigue prevalence of
19.3% (Rogers et al., 2020). Other research indicates the development of a post-SARS
syndrome for some survivors (Chrousos & Kaltsas, 2005; Moldofsky & Patcai, 2011). There
is emerging evidence for lasting fatigue as a consequence of COVID-19. A recent study
found moderate to severe levels of fatigue in up 54% of 100 patients treated for coronavirus,

4 weeks post-discharge (Halpin et al., 2020) and at a median follow-up stage of 10 weeks,
up to 50% reported severe fatigue (Townsend et al., 2020).

Factors affecting post-illness fatigue have been investigated in previous viral influenza
outbreaks. Studies indicate that for many SARS survivors, lung function was well preserved
with significant improvements between 3-12 months post-infection, although remaining lower
than healthy controls (Hui et al., 2005; Ong, 2004). Similar results have been found for
exercise capacity. For example, several studies have found poorer exercise performance on
the six-minute walking test (6MWT) at 3, 6 and 12 months (Hui, 2005; Ong, 2004). These
exercise impairments, however, were not correlated with lung function. For example, in a
Singapore study of 44 SARS patients, 41% had reduced exercise capacity but mild
pulmonary function defects (Ong, 2004). These findings have been replicated in other
SARS survivors (Hui et al., 2009; Hui et al., 2005; Ngai et al., 2010; Tansey et al., 2007) and
H1N1 patients (Hsieh et al., 2018). These physical functioning limitations, independent of
pulmonary function are thought to contribute to the reduced quality of life and fatigue
outcomes found in numerous studies of recovered patients (Hsieh et al., 2018; Tansey et al.,
2007)

These results suggest that, alongside possible physical deconditioning and corticosteroid
myopathy (Dekhuijzen & Decramer, 1992; Tansey et al., 2007), other psychological, social
or cognitive contributions may explain the persistence of fatigue and lower QoL, for example,
long periods of social isolation or stigma (Wing & Leung, 2012). Time spent in ICU (Halpin
et al., 2020) and hospital length of stay (Chen et al., 2020) have been associated with
fatigue for instance and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder
and depression are high in post-SARS. Further, chronic fatigue has been associated with a
risk of psychiatric disorder in recovered SARS patients (Wing & Leung, 2012) and with posttraumatic stress symptoms in MERS survivors (Lee et al., 2019). Social factors have been
found to be a factor in post-discharge fatigue. For instance, fatigue was more likely where
patients were involved in ‘medicolegal’ cases (Wing & Leung, 2012) and, controlling for
psychiatric morbidity, being an applicant to the survivors’ fund in Hong Kong (Lam et al.,
2009). Furthermore, while around 76-80% of survivors achieve a return to work (Lau et al.,
2005; Rogers et al., 2020), some patients reported fatigue as one of the reasons for not
returning to work (Guo et al., 2019).

Summary
Fatigue for the majority of patients usually dissipates during the course of a virus, but some
experience longer lasting symptoms, independent of their pulmonary functions and exercise

capacity. These symptoms may be associated with a number of psychosocial factors such
as psychiatric morbidity and isolation, which have been indicated with fatigue. Long-term
consequences of an epidemic such as SARS, MERS or H1N1 revealed by prior research,
may be pertinent to survivors of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the aim of this
systematic review was to investigate the prevalence of persistent fatigue among survivors of
a viral epidemic and consolidate current evidence for factors associated with fatigue
outcomes.

METHODS
Search strategy
The protocol and PICO framework for this study was developed utilising The Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The databases

Studies were excluded if they (1) measured compassion or pandemic fatigue (defined as
‘worn out’ by pandemic warnings, by government safety instructions, or with media
coverage, or with compliance requirements; (2) populations without a confirmed diagnosis of
one of the named viruses; (3) reported fatigue associated with physical disorders (e.g.
thyroiditis, Parkinson’s disease, cancer); (4) measured fatigue as a clinical symptom during
the acute phase (defined as the period of hospitalisation); (5) were protocols, vaccination
studies, animals; (6) did not report fatigue outcome data; (7) were newspaper articles,
conference papers, commentaries or editorials. We also excluded qualitative studies and
studies investigating fatigue among healthcare workers.

Data extraction
Titles and abstracts were screened by the first researcher (KPW). Full texts were screened
by KPW against the eligibility criteria. A data spreadsheet was created to include extracted
data from the included studies. The senior researchers (TC, FG) reviewed a number of the
final included studies and data. PRISMA Flow Diagram available in Appendix A.
Discrepancies were resolved via discussion and consensus with TC. The variables obtained
for the data synthesis spreadsheet were: citation, population, number of participants, control
group, location, virus type, follow-up period, study design, outcome variable of interest (e.g.
fatigue, vitality), associated variables (e.g. PTSD, depression, anxiety, stress), scales or
measures employed, power calculation (Y/N).

Quality Assessments
Risk of bias was assessed by the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) (2018). Each
study design has an appropriate checklist (e.g. cohort) comprising 12 items designed to
systematically assess a study. The items do not require a score but rather a “yes”, “no” or
“can’t tell”. The randomised and systematic review checklists were developed and adapted
from JAMA’s guides to medical literature. An overall assessment was made by assigning a
grade of ‘excellent’, ‘good’, ‘moderate’ or ‘low’ to each included article.

Statistical analysis
We computed pooled prevalence for binary fatigue outcomes with 95% confidence intervals
for 10 studies. A number of studies investigated fatigue outcomes across multiple time
points. Therefore, in order to maintain the independence of observations, only one time
period was included in the analysis as follows: (a) studies investigating fatigue in the weeks
following an infection, we selected the period closest to 3 months and (b) studies with 12
months or longer time periods, we selected the period closest to 12 months. This was to
demonstrate that the fatigue assessed was ‘long-term’. Where studies investigated both

‘fatigue’ and CFS outcomes, we incorporated the fatigue data only in the meta-analysis. This
was because the participants had not received a confirmed diagnosis of CFS in all studies.
Additional meta-analysis was conducted to compute mean differences from five included
studies to estimate the ‘severity’ of fatigue compared to population norms. For this
computation, the ‘Vitality’ subscale of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form
health survey (SF-36) (Ware & Sherbourne, 1992) was utilised as a proxy for fatigue. This
‘vitality’ subscale is scored from 0-100, with higher scores representing better
functioning/less disability. For the purposes of this study lower scores represent lower
‘energy’ and higher fatigue. We utilised this instrument because it the most frequently used
measure assessing HRQoL in respiratory virus research. The absence of data from control
groups precluded other analyses except population norms. Effect sizes were first calculated
from each included study to compute the mean effect. Meta-analyses were conducted using
R Studio, Version 1.3.1073 (2020). Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran Q statistic.
We obtained the 12 statistic with the degree of heterogeneity categorised as ‘not important’
(0-40%), ‘moderate’ (30-60%), ‘substantial’ (50-90%) and ‘considerable’ (75-100%) (Higgins,
2003). We conducted an Egger’s test to explore potential publication bias for our
proportional analysis: bias = 1.657 (95% CI -7.19-10.5), p = 0.723 suggesting an absence of
funnel plot asymmetry. Due to the small number of studies further analysis of the origins of
heterogeneity via a meta-regression or the production of funnel plots was not performed on
the mean difference analysis.

Multiple studies investigated a wide-range of post-virus outcomes including psychological,
physical and/or social effects. A number of these investigated the relationship between an
exposure virus and fatigue outcomes. However, each used a diverse number of outcome
measures or utilised non-validated scales, which disqualified the viability of a meta-analysis.
Consequently, associations which had available data were arranged in tabular form
illustrating the direction of the association with fatigue or vitality (Table 2). A positive symbol
(+) indicated a positive association, a negative symbol (-) indicated a negative association
and a zero (0) indicated no significant association between the investigated variable and
fatigue (Matcham, Ali, Hotopf, & Chalder, 2015). Associations with fatigue or vitality,
measured in prospective cohort designs were demonstrated by a superscript figure
representing the period the relationships were examined.

A total of 2,557 articles were identified using the database search protocols. Following the
removal of duplicates, 2,108 articles remained for title and abstract screening. Of these a
total of 201 articles were selected for full text screening producing a final total of 32 studies
meeting the eligibility criteria and 15 were deemed eligible for a quantitative analysis. A
summary of the included articles is presented in Table 1. We tabulated the studies according
to the fatigue and ‘vitality’ outcome measures.

Study characteristics
A total of 3,262 participants were represented in the included studies. There were 13
(40.6%) studies investigating fatigue/chronic fatigue using a fatigue scale and 19 (59.4%)
studies using the ‘vitality’ subscale of the SF-36. The most common country of origin was
Hong Kong with 10 studies, followed by China (7). Singapore, Canada and the UK (2 each).
France, Saudi Arabia, Ireland, Korea, Australia and USA each had 1 study. SARS was the
most frequently investigated virus (21 articles), COVID-19 (9), MERS (4) and H1N1 (3). One
study investigated H7N9. Zero studies investigated fatigue succeeding the other named
viruses. There were 15 prospective-cohort designs, 7 cross-sectional, 1 case-control, 5
cohort, 2 randomised-control and 3 systematic reviews. Time periods under study ranged
from 2 weeks to 12 years post-discharge or infection (for community cases) with the most
frequent time point being fatigue <3 months and 12 months post-discharge. For the
purposes of the meta-analysis, time periods ranged from 2 weeks to 4 years (Appendix B).
CASP quality assessments resulted in most studies receiving a ‘low’ or ‘moderate’
assessments indicated bias. Lower grades were assigned for multiple reasons including
selection bias, lack of adequate control groups, small sample sizes and methodological bias
(employment of unvalidated/unreliable scales).

Factors associated with fatigue
Not all 32 studies investigated or reported factors associated with fatigue following a virus
infection. Also, the available data for each risk factor were too few to conduct a quantified
analysis, with a diverse number of outcome measures. However, associations that were
available are illustrated in Table 2. Results are stratified by study design and univariate or
multivariate results. Only available data was included in the table. In summary, four studies
reported gender differences and depression. ICU admission was reported in 8 studies and 6
studies reported age/fatigue relationships. Anxiety, PTSD and exercise capacity in three
studies. Two studies investigated pulmonary functions, length of stay, psychiatric morbidity,
stigma and shorter response to follow-up. The remainder of risk factors were analysed by 1
study each.

Meta-analyses
Ten studies with a total of 1,310 participants were included for the proportional analysis

This review investigated the long-term fatigue outcomes in populations who had a confirmed
coronavirus or other named virus diagnosis. We found 32 studies that provided data on
fatigue and chronic fatigue, CFS and ‘vitality’. The majority of investigated viruses were
SARS and COVID-19. MERS, H1N1 and 1 study examining H7N9 (‘avian’) made up the
balance. No fatigue data was found among the remaining viruses. We found the pooled
prevalence of fatigue to be considerable at 41% (95% CI 0.31-0.52) among 1,310 survivors
and this fatigue was present between < 1 month (Tenforde et al. 2020; Wang et al., 2020) to
4 years post-infection (Lam et al., 2009). Our results are higher than one other study, which
found a pooled estimate of 19.3% for fatigue in 316 survivors of SARS, MERS or COVID-19
(Rogers et al., 2020). To our knowledge no other studies have investigated fatigue
systematically. The vitality subscale of the SF-36 (Ware & Sherborne, 1992) was used as a
proxy for fatigue, with lower vitality scores representing higher fatigue. Our results indicated
an overall lower mean for survivors compared to population norms. Although the results
were not significant (p = 0.803), they suggest impaired functioning up to 2.5 years following
exposure (Mak et al., 2009). Our results compare to previous systematic reviews examining
vitality in recovered patients, which found lower mean vitality in SARS and MERS survivors
compared to normative values (Ahmed et al., 2020). Similarly, in a literature review by
Gardner et al. (2015), all domains of health-related quality of life measures, including vitality,
were found to be lower than local population norms.

Fatigue and vitality changes over time were mixed, with some studies indicating improved
scores between time points (Hong et al. 2009; Kwek et al. 2006; Lee et al. 2019) and other
studies reporting no differences in fatigue for each follow-up period (Hui et al. 2005, Hui et
al. 2005b). Nevertheless, most reported lower vitality or higher fatigue compared to
population norms at all time points, up to 4 years post-infection (Lam et al. 2009; Li et al.
2006). We were not able to quantify the differences in fatigue between those who were
admitted to ICU compared to ward patients, although fatigue for ICU groups was generally
found to be higher compared to population norms (Hui et al. 2005; Hui et al. 2005b). Where
studies compared ICU with ward groups, results indicated that fatigue was not significantly
higher in the ICU group (Kwek et al., 2006; Li et al., 2006; Ngai et al., 2010; Skinner et al.,
2015). Conversely, a recent study investigating COVID-19, found ‘new fatigue’ to be higher
in ICU patients (72%) compared to the ward group, of whom 60.3% experienced fatigue
(Halpin et al., 2020). In another study of COVID-19 patients (n. 110), Arnold et al., (2020)
found worse fatigue among those who had more severe disease while MERS ICU groups
had higher fatigue compared to non-ICU patients (p = 0.03) (Batawi et al. 2019).

Nor did our study calculate risk factors for fatigue due to the small number of studies
investigating potential correlates, diverse outcome measures and aggregated SF-36 scores.
Associations between fatigue and particular lung functions, however, were reported in 2
studies. For example, FVC and VC were found to be positively correlated with vitality at 3, 6
and 12 months (Hui et al. 2005) and FEV1 with higher vitality at 6 months (Hui et al. 2005b).
Both suggest lower fatigue is associated with better pulmonary performance. Contrary
evidence from an Australian H1N1 study, found that lung functions and fatigue for 62
survivors had improved to within normal range at 1-year post-discharge (Skinner et al.,
2015). Exercise capacity, measured by the 6MWT, was lower than norms in most studies
and correlated with fatigue in 3 studies (Hui et al., 2005; Li et al., 2006; Ngai et al., 2010). A
systematic review found that mean walking distance was lower for all survivors compared to
norms (Ahmed et al., 2020) with a ‘levelling’ of test results at 12 and 18 months (Ngai et al.,
2010). Such limitations resulting from critical illness hospitalisation, are thought to contribute
to reduced quality of life and fatigue outcomes in recovered patients (Herridge et al., 2003).
However, these effects were observed independent of physical functioning. For example, in
a study of 9 H1N1 recovered patients given pulmonary rehabilitation, there was a significant
decrease in quality of life between 3 to 6 months, despite improved lung capacities and
exercise capacity (Hsieh et al., 2018). In a study examining 1-year outcomes of SARS
patients, Tansey et al. (2007) found that, while lung functions were within normal ranges,
many reported persistent fatigue and shortness of breath.

Factors such as gender in COVID-19 (Chen et al., 2020; Lau et al., 2005; Qi et al., 2020;
Townsend et al., 2020) and older age were found to be associated with fatigue (Chen et al.,
2020; Hui et al., 2005; Hui et al., 2005b; Li et al., 2006; Ngai et al., 2010), although Halpin et
al. (2020) found lower age was associated with higher fatigue in the ward group, while there
were no differences between age groups at 3 months in Hui et al., (2005b). A multiplicity of
social and physical risk factors for fatigue outcomes were investigated. For example, lower
perceived social support in 41 COVID-19 patients was related to higher fatigue (Qi et al.,
2020) and fatigue was reported as one of the reasons for not returning to work 12 years
post-discharge (Guo et al., 2019), conversely predicting higher vitality among patients who
had returned to work (Lau et al., 2005). Shorter duration of response to follow-up (Batawi et
al., 2019; Lam et al., 2009), medicolegal involvement (Lam et al., 2009; Wing & Leung,
2012) and length of stay (Chen et al., 2020) were associated with higher fatigue. However,
coping, health comorbidity and stigma were not found to be associated with fatigue (Qi et al.,
2020).

Psychological factors were found to be significant factors for SARS and MERS survivors in
systematic reviews (Gardner & Moallef, 2015; Rogers et al., 2020). Ahmed et al. (2020)
found a pooled estimate for PTSD, depression and anxiety among SARS and MERS
survivors to be 39%, 33% and 30% respectively. Among the included studies in our study
chronic fatigue had a ‘reciprocal’ association with psychiatric diagnosis (Wing & Leung,
2012), while lower vitality was associated with PTSD symptomology (Halpin et al., 2020;
Hong et al., 2009; Kwek et al., 2006), anxiety and depression (Kwek et al., 2006).
Recovered MERS patients with chronic fatigue 1-year post exposure, had persistent PTSD
symptoms mediated via depression 18 months post-infection (Lee et al., 2019). Moreover,
those with psychiatric diagnosis were more likely to experience chronic fatigue 1 year later
(Lam et al., 2009). In contrast, Qi et al., (2020) found no association between psychiatric
morbidity and chronic fatigue in recovered COVID-19 patients.

Our study suggests that survivors of a serious influenza virus experienced considerable and
long-lasting distress, physical impairments and psychological effects, including fatigue. The
persistence of physical and psychological symptoms has been identified as a post-SARS
sickness syndrome (Chrousos & Kaltsas, 2005). A syndrome distinguished by fatigue,
myalgia, general weakness, psychological distress and sleep disorders. In respect of the
current epidemic, there is potential for longer-term fatigue outcomes following a COVID-19
infection and current evidence points to a syndrome-like collection of symptoms. However,
there are few studies examining probable correlates between fatigue or vitality outcomes
with physical and pulmonary functioning; psychological or social functioning in recovering
patients. Future studies should investigate such risk factors to help inform clinical
interventions to address ‘long COVID’ symptomology. The generalisability of our results
should be applied with caution due to the diversity of measurements, distance between
investigation and exposure (i.e. < 1 month or > 2 years), variability in populations, different
admission and discharge protocols and lung function reference ranges between countries
(Chan, 2005).
