ABSTRACT

Acute Stroke (AS) is the most common time-dependent disease attended in the
Emergency Medicine Service (EMS) of Madrid (SUMMA 112). Community of Madrid
has been one of the most affected regions in Spain by the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID19) pandemic. A significant reduction in AS hospital admissions has been
reported during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period one year
before. We aimed to examine the impact of the COVID-19 in stroke codes (SC) in our
EMS among three periods of time: the COVID-19 period, the same period the year
before, and the 2019-2020 seasonal influenza period. Results: We found no significant
reduction in SC during the COVID-19 pandemic. The reduction of hospital admissions
might be attributable to patients attending to the hospital by their own means. The
maximum SC workload seen during the seasonal influenza has not been reached
during the pandemic. We detected a non-significant deviation from the SC protocol,
with a slight increase in hospitals’ transfers to non-stroke ready hospitals.

INTRODUCTION

Acute Stroke (AS) is the most common time-dependent pathology attended in the
Emergency Medicine Service (EMS) of Madrid (SUMMA 112). It is the first cause of
mortality among women and the first cause of disability in adults.
Community of Madrid has been one of the most affected in Spain by the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic. Until May 31st, 68.830 cases and 8.691 fatalities
have been registered, nearly one-third of the whole country’s total count.
A reduction in AS admissions has been reported during the COVID-19 pandemic [1-5].
We aimed to study the frequency of SC compared with the previous year, and with a
period with similar characteristics from EMS perspective, like seasonal influenza
(health system overload, similar severity risk factors).
METHODS

We conducted a retrospective observational study using the prospective SC registry of
SUMMA 112 (ethics approved). We selected all consecutive patients within three
periods of time:
1. March 1st to May 8th, 2020, for the COVID-19 period (incidence above the
median of the series),
2. March 1st to May 8th, 2019, for the PreCOVID-19 period (the same period the
year before),
3. November 24th, 2019 to February 14th, 2020, for the seasonal influenza period
(incidence above the median of the series).
SUMMA 112 is the leading Emergency Medical Service (EMS) in Madrid. For any call, a
medical team assesses the situation. If an AS is suspected, a severity scale is evaluated
to detect the possibility of large vessel occlusion (the Madrid DIRECT scale) [6].
Depending on the result, the appropriate destination is selected (comprehensive
stroke center or primary stroke center), and the main findings are communicated to
the Emergency Coordination Center (ECC) and registered on an electronic database.
The ECC then pre alerts the neurologist on call at the destination facility. An SC is
defined as a patient with sudden neurological symptoms in the last 24 hours or less,
previously independent for basic activities of daily living [7].
The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) infection rate has been collected from the Health
Ministry of Spain, and the number of seasonal influenza cases from the influenza
sentinel system (Institute of Health Carlos III).
The three groups’ means have been compared using the ANOVA test with the TukeyKramer method for pairwise comparisons. The rest of the variables have been
compared, applying ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests. The Chi-square test has been used

to compare categorical variables. The difference of means has been estimated with a
95% confidence interval, considering statistically significant those with p<0,05.
We used Rstudio for statistical analyses and Microsoft Excel for the graphs.
RESULTS

SUMMA 112 attends an average of 150 SC (95% CI: 133-167) per month (figure 1). We
attended a total of 1,130 SC during the three periods.
A significant younger age of the COVID-19 group (95% CI: 67.6-71) compared with the
other two groups (pre-COVID-19, 95%CI: 71.2-74; influenza, 95% CI: 71.8-74.3) was
found. Also, a lower proportion of women were attended with suspected stroke
(COVID-19: 43.9%, 95% CI: 38.2%-49.7%; pre-COVID-19 51.9%, 95% CI: 46.4% 57.2%; influenza 53.3%, 95% CI: 48.8%-57.8%) (table 1).
During the period of COVID-19, a non-significant daily reduction of 13% SC was
observed compared with the pre-COVID-19 period (difference of -0.68 daily cases,
95% CI: 0.15 to -1.51) and a statistically significant reduction of 24% compared with
the seasonal influenza period (-1.41, 95% CI: -0.62 to -2.21) (figure 2).
Finally, there was also a non-significant reduction in transfers rates to stroke centers
(87% vs. 90%, p=0.61) at the cost of increasing transfers to hospitals not suitable for
SC (5% vs. 3%, p=0.17), which suggests poor adherence to the protocol.
DISCUSSION

We did not detect a significant decrease in SC cases during the COVID-19 period
(figure 2). Stroke admissions in hospitals are a sum of those transferred by the EMS
and those diagnosed in the Emergency Room among those arriving by their own
means. The main reason for the reported reduction of stroke admissions might be at
the latter group. It is congruent with the reported reduction in transient ischemic
attack and mild strokes [8]. Patients with mild or temporary symptoms may have
been more concerned about being infected in the hospital or having delayed their
evaluation. Efforts should be made in awareness campaigns, in the message to call 112
whenever the patient identifies a sign of stroke.
Despite the evidence of thrombotic events associated with SARS-COV-2 infection [9],
no increase in SC has been observed. It could be due to the EMS’s saturation, which
has not been able to attend some AS cases. A possible explanation is that saturation of
the information and emergency hotlines (112) might have blocked potential patients
with stroke symptoms from being attended [1].
Stroke patients were younger in the COVID-19 period. It is possible that older people
refrained from attending the emergency department and strictly followed the
messages of staying at home [1-2].

We want to highlight the stability of the SC protocol that has succeeded under those
extraordinary circumstances, although we detected a non-significant deviation from
the SC protocol, with a slight increase in transfers to non-stroke ready hospitals.
The main limitation of this study is that it is focused on calls to 112, and the
information on other AS patients is lacking.
We de did not find evidence of a significant reduction of SC during the COVID-19
pandemic compared with the same period of the year before. The number of SC was
significantly lower during the COVID-19 period than the 2019-2020 seasonal
influenza period, thus SC seems to be capable of operating correctly, even with a high
level of health system saturation.
