The emergence and rapid worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 has accelerated research and
development for controlling the pandemic. A multi-coronavirus protein microarray was created
containing full-length proteins, overlapping protein fragments of varying lengths and peptide
libraries from SARS-CoV-2 and four other human coronaviruses. Sera from confirmed COVID-19
patients as well as unexposed individuals were applied to multi-coronavirus arrays to identify
specific antibody reactivity. High level IgG, IgM and IgA reactivity to structural proteins S, M and
N, as well as accessory proteins, of SARS-CoV-2 were observed that was specific to COVID-19
patients. Overlapping 100, 50 and 30 amino acid fragments of SARS-CoV-2 proteins identified
antigenic regions. Numerous proteins of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the endemic human
coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 were also more reactive with IgG, IgM and IgA in
COVID-19 patient sera than in unexposed control sera, providing further evidence of immunologic
cross-reactivity between these viruses. The multi-coronavirus protein microarray is a useful tool
for mapping antibody reactivity in COVID-19 patients.

A novel human coronavirus, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, now known as
SARS-CoV-2 emerged in December 2019. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly worldwide
and on March 11th, 2020, it was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO;
1). As of November 30th, 2020, there are over 63 million confirmed cases of coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) caused by this new virus, resulting in more than 1.4 million deaths, corresponding to
a case mortality rate of ~2.3% (2). Best current estimates indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a basic
reproductive number, R0, of 2 to 2.5 and an incubation time of approximately 4.6 days (3, 4),
which allows rapid spread of the virus. Diagnosis, treatment and vaccination against COVID-19
will all benefit from a clear understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Previous studies have shown that COVID-19 patients rapidly seroconvert to SARS-CoV-2 and
produce IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies directed to several viral proteins (5-8). Reinfection challenge
studies in rhesus macaques showed that the humoral and cellular immune response to SARSCoV-2 infection was effective in blocking reinfection (25, 26). Nevertheless, it is not clear whether
all antibody responses are beneficial or whether some antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 lead
to a less favorable course of disease (9, 10). Moreover, enhancement of infection by antibodies

We have created and used a multi-coronavirus protein microarray, containing over one-thousand
coronavirus proteins, protein fragments and peptides to map IgG, IgA and IgM antibody epitopes
in sera from COVID-19 patients. Our approach localizes the antibody reactivity of COVID-19
patients within SARS-CoV-2 proteins and allows us to map the antigenic regions bound.
Furthermore, we can similarly measure the antibody reactivity of COVID-19 patients and healthy
controls with endemic human coronaviruses and with the two previous epidemic coronaviruses,
SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Our findings and
the multi-coronavirus protein microarray we created will be useful in discerning which de novo
and cross-reactive antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are protective and which may be less
useful in preventing disease or may even be detrimental. In addition, if high levels of antibody to
specific epitopes are found to be especially protective, the array could be used to screen
convalescent plasma for therapeutic potential and vaccine recipient sera as a preliminary
measure of efficacy (27-30).

The multi-coronavirus protein microarray created and used in this study encompasses over ninehundred features. It includes the four structural proteins and five accessory proteins of SARSCoV-2 as well as overlapping 100, 50 and 30 amino acid (aa) protein fragments of these nine
SARS-CoV-2 proteins. It also contains the structural proteins of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoVNL63 and HCoV-OC43, plus overlapping 13-20 aa peptides of the SARS-CoV structural proteins
and of the S proteins of MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 (Table 1).

The specimens from COVID-19 patients had robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA antibodies.
IgM antibody responses were weaker. The magnitude and specificity of the antibody responses
were similar in both sets of samples, so they are presented together here. COVID-19 patient
serum IgG, IgA and IgM reacted strongly to purified SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), as well as SARSCoV nucleocapsid (N), S and membrane (M) proteins compared to healthy control sera (Fig. 1).
The receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (RBD) had overall weaker antibody
binding signals, but nevertheless was significantly more reactive in COVID-19 patient serum IgG
and IgA. The signals shown in figure 1 are the base two logarithm of the raw intensities without
normalization, since the background reactivity of each purified protein is different. The SARSCoV-2 S and RBD as well as the SARS-CoV S, N and M purified proteins had the largest mean

differences between IgG binding of the negative and positive groups, and the differences are the
most statistically significant (t-test p values <10-5). The same five antigens had the largest
significant mean differences between IgA binding of the negative and positive groups. Only
SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV N, however, had significant differential IgM binding between the
COVID-19 patients and the control group. These results are in agreement with the enzyme linked
immunosorbent assays (ELISA) shown in Tables 2 and 3.

Figure 1. COVID-19 patient and healthy control antibody reactivity with purified SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV proteins. The split violin plot shows the log2-transformed fluorescence signal
intensity distribution of antibodies bound to each purified protein on the multi-coronavirus protein
microarray. Within each half-violin are three lines representing the interquartile range and the
median. Above each split violin is the Wilcoxon rank sum p value, colored blue for significant p
values below 0.05. The three panels are split by isotype (IgG, top; IgA, middle; IgM, bottom).
Horizontal red dashed lines are drawn at the median of all signal intensities against purified
proteins (n=14) and peptides (n=587) plus 1.0, i.e. double the global median—this threshold
serves as a point of reference, but not necessarily a seropositivity cutoff for each protein.

of each of these nine SARS-CoV-2 proteins and to produce the structural proteins and some
accessory proteins of HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV. Using aa start and end
positions of each fragment within the protein, differential reactivity between the COVID-19 and
healthy donor groups was mapped in a circular heatmap for the structural proteins (Fig. 2). This
analysis allowed us to identify antigenic regions in each SARS-CoV-2 structural protein. The
SARS-CoV-2 N protein showed the strongest reactivity in its carboxy terminal 100 aa fragment,
as well as in 50 aa fragments covering the same region. This region was recognized by IgG, IgA
and IgM with significant differential reactivity between COVID-19 patients and the healthy control
group. The middle of the N protein also had a region recognized by IgG and IgA identified by two
100 aa fragments. Together these antibody-reactive regions encompass about two thirds of the
N protein that likely contains at least two epitopes. The S1 protein also showed greatest IgG
binding near its carboxy terminus, in the penultimate 100 aa fragment. This antigenic region of
S1 was defined further by IgG and IgA reactivity with 50 aa fragments from aa 550 to 600. The
region containing the RBD was not strongly reactive when produced by IVTT. In contrast, the S2
protein of SARS-CoV-2 showed three regions of strong IgG, IgA and IgM binding and differential
reactivity with full-length, 100 aa and 50 aa fragments. Only the region near the carboxy terminus,
however, was also reactive as a 30 aa fragment. This reactive 30 aa fragment, from aa 450 to
480 of S2 (1,135 to 1,165 of S), therefore likely defines a linear IgG epitope in this highly antigenic
protein. Notably, an epitope in the central S2 antigenic region was differentially reactive for IgG
and IgA, but showed equal levels of IgM reactivity in 100 aa and 50 aa fragments, perhaps
indicating a region of cross-reactivity for IgM produced by memory B cells. An additional short
epitope was found in the amino terminal 30 aa fragment of the SARS-CoV-2 M protein. This short
fragment was highly reactive with COVID-19 patient serum IgG compared to healthy donor serum
IgG, while larger fragments containing it and indeed the full-length M protein were not as highly
discriminatory for COVID-19 patient sera. The SARS-CoV-2 E protein had only one 30 aa
fragment that showed low-level reactivity with IgA and IgM, in both COVID-19 positive and
negative control groups. The antigenic regions of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins we identified
were not associated with higher or lower levels of homology between SARS-CoV-2 and other
human coronaviruses (percent aa sequence identity shown in outer track of Fig. 2). There was a
moderate to high level of correlation between antibody reactivity with S2, N and M proteins
produced in vitro, particularly for IgG (Pearson’s correlation coefficient shown in inner links of Fig.
2). Less reactivity was seen in non-structural proteins, but significant reactivity of COVID-19
patient sera compared to control sera could be identified in fragments of the 3a and 7a accessory
proteins (Supplemental Figure 1).

Individual responses to the antigenic regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins identified by reactivity with
protein fragments varied substantially, as they did for the structural proteins of other human
coronaviruses (Fig. 3). Responses against the SARS-CoV-2 S1, S2 and N protein fragments, as
well as the 30aa fragments of the M protein are shown in Supplemental Figure 2. Within the
antigenic regions, some fragments, particularly 30 aa fragments, were nonreactive with COVID19 patient sera, but others were reactive in a subset of individuals. Heterogeneity was higher and
overall signal intensities were lower for IgA and IgM than for IgG. There were no significant
associations between age and sex with antibody levels in the positive group after adjustment for
the false discovery rate for any of the three isotypes (Supplemental Table 1).

Full-length N proteins of the endemic HCoV’s were reactive with IgG from COVID-19 patients and
healthy controls. HCoV-NL63 N was significantly reactive (normalized signal intensity ≥ 1.0) with
IgG controls and COVID-19 patients (17/19 and 20/20, respectively; proportions test p value =
0.4) (Fig. 3), while HCoV-OC43 N was significantly reactive with IgG control sera and patient sera
(15/19 and 20/20, respectively; p=0.1). In contrast, IgG from only two control subjects reacted
with the SARS-CoV-2 full length N protein while nearly all of the patients’ serum IgG reacted
(19/20; p=6.8e-7). Reactivity of the control serum IgG with fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 N
protein occurred exclusively in the C-terminal region of the protein (1/19) while COVID-19 patient
serum IgG reacted frequently with fragments in the central region (12/20; p=2.1e-4) of the protein
as well as the C-terminal region (19/20; p=1.3e-7).

The reactivity of COVID-19 patient serum IgA compared to IgA of healthy donor sera was similar
to results obtained for IgG. The IgA results had lower statistical significance than the IgG results,
however, likely due to the lower concentration of IgA in serum compared to IgG. Nevertheless,
many of the same proteins were the most differentially reactive with COVID-19 patient serum IgA
compared to healthy donor serum IgA, including the N and S proteins and RBD of SARS-CoV-2
as well as the N, S and M proteins of SARS-CoV with t-test p values ranging from 2.1 x 10-6 to
1.1 x 10-3 (Fig. 3). The COVID-19 patient sera used in this study had less coronavirus reactive
IgM than IgG or IgA, perhaps because the samples were obtained during the convalescent phase
of disease. Nevertheless, significantly greater IgM reactivity was seen in patient sera compared
to control donor sera for four proteins and two protein fragments produced in vitro (Fig. 3). These
were the N, S2 and M proteins of SARS-CoV-2, the MERS-CoV N protein, the carboxy terminal

The S2 protein was reactive with patient IgG at a much higher frequency than in the controls for
both HCoV-NL63 (5/19 and 16/20 positives, respectively; p=2.4e-3) and HCoV-OC43 (4/19 and
18/20, respectively; p=5.9e-5). The higher frequencies in the positives provide strong evidence of
increased responses due to their exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Some control subject’s IgG reacted
with the C-terminal (4/19) or central regions (4/19) of the SARS-CoV-2 S2 protein but none
reacted with the N-terminal region; this includes one individual which had unique reactivity to
SARS-CoV-2 S2 fragments 401-500 and 451-550 (Figure S2, G). By ELISA, this serum had a
S/C value of 0.94, which was just below the positivity threshold of 1.0 and much higher than other
healthy donor sera. This reactivity was unique among healthy donors but did not directly translate
to reactivity with OC43 or NL63 FL S proteins. Overall, COVID-19 patient serum IgG reacted with
the SARS-CoV-2 S2 protein C-terminal (19/20; p=1.3e-5), central (17/20; p=2.3e-4), and/or Nterminal (12/20; p=2.1e-4) 100 aa fragments much more frequently than healthy donor sera.

A library of 587 peptides, 15 to 20 aa in length, from the epidemic SARS-CoV (covering S, N, M
and E proteins) and two endemic human coronaviruses (covering S protein) was printed on the
multi-coronavirus microarray at the same concentration as full-length purified recombinant
proteins. The peptides, however, showed lower antibody reactivity than full length proteins or
protein fragments of 30, 50 or 100 aa. Exceptionally, a single 17 aa peptide from HCoV-OC43 S
protein with sequence CSKASSRSAIEDLLFDK spanning residues 905 to 921 had approximately
3.5-fold higher mean reactivity in the COVID-19 patient sera (p=0.001, not significant after
adjustment for the false discovery rate). This peptide mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 sequence
PSKPSKRSFIEDLLFNK at residues 809 to 825 of S protein with identical residues in 12/17
positions.

To visualize the relative importance of antibody isotype binding in differentiating COVID-19
positive sera from negative sera, the samples were projected in two dimensions for each isotype
using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE; Fig. 4A), a nonlinear machine learning
dimensionality reduction method which clusters together similar sets of multidimensional data.
The thirty most reactive proteins for all isotypes were selected for this analysis to reduce the effect
of differing isotype background levels that would be notable in low-reactivity proteins (Fig. 4B).
Each of the isotypes cluster separately, but only IgG gave a clear delineation of positives and
negatives (at ~2.6 in tSNE dimension 2). Henceforth, the focus of the presented data is on the
IgG responses.

The full-length SARS-CoV-2 N and S2 proteins as well as several fragments of both proteins had
the top nine largest mean differences in IgG reactivity between COVID-19 patients and healthy
controls (Fig. 4B). These results were also statistically significant with t-test p values ranging from
2.1 x 10-6 to 4.3 x 10-2 (Supplemental Table 1). Antibody responses to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43
and MERS-CoV proteins were also among the thirty most discriminatory antigens for
differentiating COVID-19 patients from control donors due to high reactivity with COVID-19
positive sera, while also demonstrating a considerable reactivity with negative. Nearly all the same
epitopes and regions of reactivity found for IgG were recapitulated by IgA reactivity as well, when
reactivity to the overlapping 100 aa, 50 aa and 30 aa protein fragments was analyzed (Fig. 3).
This includes the epitopes mapped in the SARS-CoV-2 N, S1, S2 and M proteins (Fig. 2).

By comparing the correlation between antibody responses to the S2 and N proteins of SARSCoV-2 with responses to the S2 and N proteins of endemic human coronaviruses, in both COVID19 positive and negative sera, we can estimate to what extent antibody responses to SARS-CoV2 are the result of de novo immune responses or of boosting pre-existing immunity. There were
significantly stronger correlations between SARS-CoV-2 S2 protein IgG and HCoV-OC43 S2
proteins in the positive group (Pearson’s correlation coefficient, ρ=0.6) than the negative group
(ρ=0.24; Fig. 5A, top left). In the negative group, SARS-CoV-2 N protein IgG had no correlation
with HCoV-OC43 N protein (ρ=0.02) or HCoV-NL63 N protein (ρ=0.09), whereas the correlations
in the positive group were higher (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 had ρ=0.44 with SARS-CoV-2 N
protein). HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 N protein reactivity exhibited strong correlations in both
positive and negative groups (ρ=0.54 and ρ=0.62, respectively). However, S2 protein reactivity
correlations between these endemic human coronaviruses were lower in the negative group than
the positive group (ρ=0.29 and ρ=0.49, respectively). Further inspection of the correlation
scatterplot matrix (Supplemental Figure 3) showed a clear outlier in the CDC positive group for
SARS-CoV-2 N protein and that correlations may differ if the CDC and Mayo cohorts were
considered separately. Differential IgG reactivity between the COVID-19 positive and negative
groups was also observed with the S2 and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43 and HCoVNL63. Positive COVID-19 patient sera had significantly higher IgG levels to S2 and N than the
negative healthy donor sera for all three coronaviruses (Fig. 5B), with the exception of HCoVOC43 N protein; this protein also showed higher IgA reactivity in the negatives (Supplemental
Figure 4).

S protein-based ELISA results from the CDC cohort, taken on all COVID-19 or healthy donor
samples, were compared with IgG reactivity in the protein microarray data by Pearson’s
correlation coefficient for the highly reactive IVTT S2 protein (ρ=0.85), IVTT N protein (ρ=0.9),
purified recombinant full-length S protein (ρ=0.88) and the purified recombinant RBD (ρ=0.85),
shown in Fig. 6A-D. The data clustered separately for negative responders and positive
responders for all proteins. Virus neutralization titers were only available for the CDC COVID-19
patients and one healthy donor sample that tested near the 1.0 cutoff for ELISA reactivity (n=11).
In all cases, neutralization activity was low, with positive neutralization titers at dilution factors of
20 or 40. Despite the low values and few samples, a trend was observed using linear regression
for IVTT S2 (β=6.5, p=0.076), IVTT N (β=6, p=0.036) and stabilized purified S (β=6.3, p=0.077)
(Fig. 6E-H). There was no association, however, of neutralization with responses to IgG reactivity
with purified RBD (β=2.8, p=0.27). The linear regression models were specified with values of 0
for titers <20. However, since the true titer is between 0 and 20, neutralization was also modeled
as an ordinal variable using ordinal logistic regression. Similar results were obtained for IVTT S2
and stabilized purified S, whereas association with IVTT N protein was no longer significant. The
complete correlation results for all proteins are shown in Supplemental Table 1.

In this study of twenty COVID-19 patients, the strongest antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2
proteins used on this array, for all antibody isotypes, were directed to the N and S2 proteins as
has been previously seen in other studies (5, 8, 14, 15). We also detected antibody responses to
S1, M and accessory proteins 3a and 7a. Moreover, we were able to localize regions of each of
these SARS-CoV-2 proteins to which antibodies bound, by antibody reactivity with overlapping
protein fragments of three different lengths: 100, 50 and 30 aa. Our results were internally
consistent in that reactive proteins had more reactive fragments than non-reactive proteins and
100 aa reactive fragments contained reactive 50 aa fragments and sometimes they also contained
reactive 30 aa fragments. We found little reactivity of COVID-19 patient sera with 13-20 aa
peptides from SARS-CoV S, M, E or N, HCoV-OC43 S or HCoV-NL63 S with the exception of
one S2 peptide from HCoV-OC43.

Many previous publications have predicted B cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 proteins using a
variety of immunoinformatic approaches (16-19). Crooke et al. predicted twenty-six potential
linear B cell epitopes in the S protein, fourteen potential epitopes in the N protein, and three
potential epitopes in the M protein. We noted antibody reactivity with regions containing some,
but not all of these predicted epitopes. In particular, of the top six predicted B cell epitopes in the
S protein we found significantly stronger reactivity with COVID-19 patient sera compared to
healthy donor sera for regions containing three epitopes: DIADTT, residues 568-573 near the

carboxy terminus of S1, PPIKD, residues 792-796 near the amino terminus of S2 and
VYDPLQPELDSF, residues 1137-1148 near the carboxy terminus of S2. The other three top
predicted B cell epitopes of the S protein, residues 405-428, 440-450 and 496-507, were not in
highly reactive regions of the S protein in our experiments, perhaps due to the overall low reactivity
of the S1 protein except for its carboxy terminal region or a need for native structure not found in
protein fragments produced in vitro. Similarly, we found COVID-19 specific reactivity for regions
including nine of the fourteen B cell epitopes in the N protein and one of three B cell epitopes in
the M protein predicted by Crooke et al.

A few other groups have used protein or peptide arrays to map antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV2 protein (15, 20-23). Two studies included full-length purified structural proteins from SARS-CoV2, other human coronaviruses and diverse human retroviruses (15, 20). Their results are
consistent with ours, but do not include accessory proteins or the ability to map reactive regions
in each protein. Several groups used peptides to map epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (2123); Li et al. found four epitopes defined by 12 aa peptides, three of which are in regions of
antibody reactivity that we found. Poh et al. found two epitopes defined by 18 aa peptides. Both
are in regions of antibody reactivity that we described here. Finally, Zhang et al. used 15 aa
peptides overlapping by 5 aa covering the whole SARS-CoV-2 proteome, plus full-length N and
E as well as five truncated forms of S to map IgM and IgG responses of acute COVID-19 patients
(median 4 days post onset of symptoms). They found a more robust IgM responses, though their
specimens were collected earlier during infection. Zhang et al. identified five peptides as the most
specific for COVID-19 patient IgG binding compared to controls: two in the S protein, two in N and
one in ORF-1ab. Both S protein peptides are in regions where we found IgG reactivity; one is in
the N-terminal region of reactivity we found in S2 and the other in the central reactivity region of
S2. The N peptides of this group were not in a reactive region in our work and we did not assay
antibody reactivity of the ORF-1ab polyproteins.

Recently two groups published epitope maps of SARS-CoV-2 using phage display (33, 34). One
group analyzed 56 aa and 20 aa fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, while the other group
analyzed 38 aa fragments of the proteome. Both studies also included other human coronaviruses
and used COVID-19 patient sera and control sera to identify specifically reactive epitopes in the
SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Their data are largely in agreement with data presented here. Both
studies found the greatest reactivity of COVID-19 patient sera in the S2 and N proteins. Moreover,
the epitopes they mapped overlapped with the ones we found here by different methods.

On the population level it is clear that groups of SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects have higher
antibody levels to the whole N and S2 proteins, but it is also clear that even in the small sample
sets evaluated here, some SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals have substantial pre-existing antibody
to some epitopes of these two proteins. Since the pre-existing antibody levels are likely to vary
according to many different factors (e.g. geography, age, time of year and associated higher
frequency of recent of exposure to other coronaviruses) it would be beneficial to have detailed
knowledge of specific epitopes of the key immunogenic proteins.

The multi-coronavirus protein array is a tool that can help us improve our understanding of the
immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. With these first two sets of
convalescent sera provided by the Mayo Clinic and the CDC, we have shown that SARS-CoV-2
naïve subjects have clearly measurable cross-reactive antibody to the whole N and S2 proteins
and that this reactivity is limited to specific epitopes. Importantly, there are epitopes that are more
specific to SARS-CoV-2, that might serve as useful biomarkers of infection. Conversely, we have
shown that infection with SARS-CoV-2 elicits or boosts the level of antibodies that bind to the N

Limitations of our study are the small sample size and the inclusion of only convalescent samples.
Despite these limitations, we were able to identify clear differences in the antibody response from
COVID-19 patients and healthy, non-exposed controls. The ideal dataset to further investigate
associations between preexisting antibody to specific epitopes and protection from severe
disease would be longitudinal, with at least a pre-exposure sample, an acute sample, and a
convalescent sample from each subject. Inclusion of samples from COVID-19 patients with a
range of clinical symptoms will also provide an important comparison. In upcoming projects, we
are seeking to analyze these types of samples paired with detailed clinical data on disease
outcomes ranging from asymptomatic to fatal to further improve our understanding of the complex
role antibodies play in SARS-CoV-2 infection. It may also prove interesting to test convalescent
plasma samples, especially given the variable results on efficacy that have been reported in the
literature (27-30). An assay providing more granular detail on the humoral response in these
samples, such as the protein microarray described here, may provide valuable insights into what
is happening during these convalescent plasma trials.

The first generation multi-coronavirus protein microarray, produced by Antigen Discovery, Inc.
(ADI, Irvine, CA, USA), included 935 full-length coronavirus proteins, overlapping 100, 50 and 30
aa protein fragments and overlapping 13-20 aa peptides from SARS-CoV-2 (WA-1), SARS-CoV,
MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43. Purified proteins and peptides were obtained from
BEI Resources. All these coronavirus proteins were produced in Escherichia coli except the
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S proteins, which were made in Sf9 insect cells and the SARSCoV-2 RBD, made in HEK-293 cells. Other proteins and protein fragments were expressed using
an E. coli in vitro transcription and translation (IVTT) system (Rapid Translation System,
Biotechrabbit, Berlin, Germany) and printed onto nitrocellulose-coated glass AVID slides (Grace
Bio-Labs, Inc., Bend, OR, USA) using an Omni Grid Accent robotic microarray printer (Digilabs,
Inc., Marlborough, MA, USA). Microarrays were probed with sera and antibody binding detected
by incubation with fluorochrome-conjugated goat anti-human IgG or IgA or IgM (Jackson
ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA or Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., Montgomery, TX, USA).
Slides were scanned on a GenePix 4300A High-Resolution Microarray Scanner (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), and raw spot and local background fluorescence intensities, spot
annotations and sample phenotypes were imported and merged in R (R Core Team, 2017), in
which all subsequent procedures were performed. Foreground spot intensities were adjusted by
subtraction of local background, and negative values were converted to one. All foreground values
were transformed using the base two logarithm. The dataset was normalized to remove
systematic effects by subtracting the median signal intensity of the IVTT controls for each sample.
With the normalized data, a value of 0.0 means that the intensity is no different than the
background, and a value of 1.0 indicates a doubling with respect to background. For full-length
purified recombinant proteins and peptide libraries, the raw signal intensity data was transformed
using the base two logarithm for analysis.

were from patients that were not hospitalized with blood collected between 26 and 60 days post
symptom onset. Negative control sera were collected pre-COVID-19, in the fall of 2019. This
activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC
policy (45 C.F.R. part 46, 21 C.F.R. part 56). The COVID-19 positive samples provided by Mayo
Clinic were de-identified residual sera from clinical testing with only age and sex information
available. The COVID-19 negative samples were collected pre-COVID-19 pandemic, between
2005-2012. These samples were from participants in prior Mayo Clinic vaccine studies who had
provided informed consent for future use of their biospecimens. The original blood collection was
collected through Mayo Clinic IRB-approved protocols. Samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2
specific antibodies and the presence of neutralizing antibodies as described below.

CDC provided samples were tested using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
against the pre-fusion stabilized ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (31). This validated
assay has been shown to have sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 99%, respectively (32).
Briefly, plates were coated with purified spike protein and incubated overnight at 4°C followed by
37°C incubation steps and subsequent phosphate buffered saline + 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST)
washings with: 2.5 X Stabilcoat blocker (Surmodics), 1:25 to 1:1600 diluted serum in 1 X PBST +
5% skim milk for 1 h, 1:2000 goat anti-human Ab conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (KPL) for
1h, ABTS peroxidase substrate for 30 min. Reactions were then quenched with stop
solution. Plates were read at 405 nm and 490 nm, with resulting ODs calculated as 490 nm - 405
nm absorbance for each sample and minus PBS-only coated wells. Results are reported as a
ratio of the calculated sample OD/cut-off threshold OD (signal/threshold, or S/T); values >1.0 are
defined as positive. The Mayo Clinic COVID-19 positive samples were tested using an IgG
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-specific ELISA assay (EuroImmune Inc.) performed according to
manufacturer’s recommendations. This validated assay has been shown to have sensitivity and
specificity of 90% and 100%, respectively (39). Results are reported as a ratio of the sample
OD/calibrator OD (signal/calibrator, or S/C); values >1.1 are defined as positive.

All SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization assays (MNT) were performed following biosafety level-3
precautions, using a SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate. The WA1 strain of SARS-CoV-2 was employed
using a modified version of a previously established protocol.27 Vero cell suspensions (ATCC
CCL-81) were prepared at 2.2 – 2.5 × 105 cells/mL in DMEM (Thermo Fisher, catalog 11965118)
+ 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, defined, Hyclone catalog SH30070.03, heat-inactivated 56°C for
30 min) + 2X antibiotic-antimycotic (Thermo Fisher catalog 15240062) + 2X penicillinstreptomycin (Thermo Fisher catalog 15140122) immediately before use. Sera were 2-fold serial
diluted in serum-free DMEM in a 96-well flat bottom plate, from 1:10 – 1:320, in triplicate, to a final
volume of 50 µL/well. Fifty µL SARS-CoV-2 was to each well, such that final serum dilution titers
ranged from 1:20 – 1:640. After 30 min incubation at 37°C and 5% CO2, 100 µL of Vero cells in
suspension were added to each well, for a final concentration of 2.2 – 2.5 × 104 cells/well. After
5 days cells were stained and fixed with crystal violet fixative (0.15% crystal violet, 2.5% ethanol,
11% formaldehyde, 50% PBS, 0.01M pH 7.4). The endpoint concentration at which antibodies
were determined to be neutralizing for SARS-CoV-2 infection was the lowest concentration of
antibody at which 3 replicate wells were protected against virus infection.

Student’s t-tests were used for comparison of the individual antibody response means between
the positive and negative groups. Comparison of the medians was done using Wilcoxon’s rank
sum test. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was calculated to
estimate delineation of groups for each antigen. The t-SNE analyses were calculated after 25,000
iterations with a perplexity parameter of 30 using the R package Rtsne (35). Comparisons of the
proportions of responders to each protein between groups was done using two-proportions ztests implemented by the 'prop.test' function in R. Correlation between antibody features and
between protein microarray and ELISA measurements used Pearson’s correlation coefficient (ρ),
and association between antibody measurements and sample information such as sex, age and
cohort were modeled using linear regression. The association of specific antibody responses with
virus neutralization titers was estimated using linear regression with the values below detection
levels (<20) coded as zero, or by converting neutralization titers to ordinal values and estimating
the proportional odds ratio by ordinal logistic regession, whereby p values were estimated by
comparing the t-value against the standard normal distribution. Adjustment for the false discovery
rate was performed using the “p.adjust” function in R (36). Data visualization was performed using
the circlize (37), ComplexHeatmap (38), ggplot2, heatmap2 and corrplot (39) packages in R.
Unadjusted p values were shown in graphics.
