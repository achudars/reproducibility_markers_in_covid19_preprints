Abstract
Background: Since January 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has spread
rapidly and developing the pandemic model around the world. Data have been needed
on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients in an imported cases as model in
island outside Wuhan.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective study included all 168 confirmed cases of
Covid-19 in Hainan province from 22 January 2020 to 13 March 2020. Cases were
confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for demographic, clinical,
radiological and laboratory data.
Results: Of 168 patients, 160 have been discharged, 6 have died and 2 remain
hospitalized. The median age was 51.0 years and 51.8% were females. 129 (76.8%)
patients were imported cases, and 118 (70.2%), 51 (30.4%) and 52 (31%) of patients
lived in Wuhan or traveled to Wuhan, had contact with Covid-19 patients, or had
contact with Wuhan residents, respectively. The most common symptoms at onset of
illness were fever (65.5%), dry cough (48.8%) and expectoration (32.1%). On
admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest
computed tomography (60.2%). The elderly people with diabetes, hypertension and
CVD are more likely to develop severe cases. Follow-up of 160 discharged patients
found that 20 patients (12.5%) had a positive RT-PCR test results of pharyngeal
swabs or anal swabs or fecal.
Conclusions: In light of the rapid spread of Covid-19 around the world, early
diagnosis and quarantine is important to curb the spread of Covid-19 and intensive

Introduction
In December 2019, patients with pneumonia of unknown causes were found in some
medical institutions in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.1 On January 7, 2020, the virus
was isolated from a sample of a positive patient and the entire genome sequence of
the virus was obtained.2 Subsequent studies indicated that the virus belonged to the
type b coronavirus family, and its genetic characteristics were obviously different
from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS).3,4 The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new
coronavirus pneumonia as a public health emergency of international concern on 31
January 2020, and officially named it "coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19)"on
February 11, 2020. Covid-19 is mainly transmitted from human-to-human by
respiratory droplets and close contact, and may also be transmitted through fecal
mouth and aerosol.5,6 The clinical manifestations of Covid-19 are very similar to
SARS, and patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which
is highly likely to require intensive care and even lead to death.7 Since January 2020,
the Covid-19 has spread rapidly from Wuhan to other parts of China and other
countries around the world.8-10 As of March 13, 2020, a total of 132,758
laboratory-confirmed cases (80,991 in China) and 4955 deaths (3180 in China) had
been reported worldwide.11 With the increasing number of confirmed and suspected
cases globally, the situation of disease prevention and control is extremely critical.
Since the outbreak of Covid-19, several studies have successively reported the
clinical characteristics of patients infected with Covid-19, but almost all the research

was conducted in Wuhan or other cities in inland China.12-15 Hainan province is an
independent island located at the southern tip of China, unlike the rest of China,
Hainan province belongs to tropical monsoon climate. Previous studies have found
that climate affects the spread of SARS virus.16 Therefore, we describe the clinical
characteristics and laboratory findings of patients infected with Covid-19 in Hainan
province to explore whether it is different from other regions in China, and to provide
an insight into the prevention and treatment of Covid-19 across China, especially to
other places with similar climate and environment as Hainan province.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
We conducted a retrospective study focusing on the clinical characteristics of
confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Hainan province from 22 January 2020 (the time of
the first confirmed patient in Hainan province) to 14 March 2020. Sputum and throat
swab specimens collected from all patients at admission were tested by real time
polymerase chain reaction for SARS-Cov-2 RNA. All patients with Covid-19 were
diagnosed based on the WHO interim guidance17 and the “Diagnosis and Treatment of
New Coronavirus Pneumonia (trial version 3)” published by National Health
Commission of the People’s Republic of China.18 A confirmed case was defined as a
positive result to high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcriptase
polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for nasal and pharyngeal swab
specimens.7 Only the laboratory-confirmed cases were included in the analysis.
The study was approved by the institutional ethics board of the Second Affiliated

Hospital of Hainan Medical University (No. 2020R003). Written informed consent
was waived due to the urgent need to collect clinical data on this emerging disease.
Data Collection
All medical records of patients were extracted by a doctor assigned by local hospital
and sent to the data processing center in Haikou. A team of experienced respiratory
clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data. Data were entered into a computerized
database and cross-checked. If the data were with mission or doubt, the coordinators
in Haikou contacted the doctor who is responsible for the treatment of the patient for
clarification.
The epidemiological characteristics (demographic data, exposure history, and
underlying comorbidities), clinical (symptoms and signs), laboratory (ie, complete
blood count, blood chemistry, coagulation test, liver and renal function, electrolytes)
and radiological findings (chest X-ray or computed tomography), treatment (ie,
antiviral therapy, corticosteroid therapy, respiratory support) and outcomes (remained
in hospital, discharges, death) data were extracted from electronic medical records.
The severity of Covid-2019 was defined based on the “Diagnosis and Treatment of
New Coronavirus Pneumonia (trial version 7)” published by National Health
Commission of the People’s Republic of China.19 Severe patients are defined as
having been critically ill during their hospitalization. Fever was defined as an axillary
temperature of 37.3°C or higher. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was
defined according to the Berlin definition.20 Acute kidney injury was identified
according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definition.21 Cardiac

injury was defined if the serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (eg, troponin I) were
above the 99th percentile upper reference limit or new abnormalities were shown in
electrocardiography and echocardiography.22 The durations from onset of disease to
first hospital visit, admission, severe, discharge or death were recorded. The clinical
outcomes were monitored up to March 13, 2020, the final date of follow-up.
Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables were presented as the counts and percentages in each category,
and chi-square tests and Fisher’s exact tests were used for comparing as appropriate.
Continuous variables were presented as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) and
compared with Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. All analyses were performed using SPSS
(Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 22.0 software (SPSS Inc), and the
statistical significance was two-sided P values <0.05. Distribution map was plotted
using ArcGis version 10.2.2
Results
As of March 13, 2020, a total of 168 patients (Non-severe: 132; Severe: 36) were
infected with Covid-19 in Hainan province. The distribution of patients infected with
Covid-19 across Hainan province is presented in Figure 1. The demographic and
clinical characteristics of patients by severity group are presented in Table 1. The
median age was 51.0 years (IQR, 36-62), 51.8% were females and 33.3% were the
retired. 129 (76.8%) patients were imported cases, and 118 (70.2%), 51 (30.4%) and
52 (31%) of the patients lived in Wuhan or traveled to Wuhan, had contact with
Covid-19 patients, or had contact with Wuhan residents, respectively.

(median, 37.0°C vs 36.8°C; P < 0.05) and heart rate (median, 92.0 bpm vs 80.5 bpm;
P < 0.05) on admission, and more likely to have underlying comorbidities, including
hypertension (30.6% vs 9.8%; P < 0.05), diabetes (19.4% vs 3.8%; P < 0.05) and
cardiovascular disease (CVD) (16.7% vs 4.5%; P < 0.05).
Radiologic and Laboratory Findings
The radiologic and laboratory findings on admission are shown in Table 2. Of 133
patients who underwent chest computed tomography (CT), the most common patterns
were ground-glass opacity (60.2%) and bilateral patchy shadowing (42.9%). Of 51
patients who underwent chest X-ray, the most common patterns were bilateral patchy
shadowing (35.3%) and local patchy shadowing (31.4%). Typical chest CT findings
of infected patients on admission were shown in Figure 2.

On admission, the levels of lymphocyte, white blood cell and neutrophil were
decreased in 72 (72%) of 165 patients, 40 (24%) of 167 patients and 19 (11.4%)
patients, respectively, while the levels of C-reactive protein, D-dimer, prothrombin
time and activated partial thromboplastin time were increased in 65 (67%) of 97
patients, 14 (30.4%) of 46 patients, 10 (10.5%) of 95 patients and 8 (8.3%) of 96
patients, respectively. There were numerous differences in laboratory findings
between non-severe patients and severe patients, including white blood cell count,
platelet count, lymphocyte ratio, neutrophil ratio, lymphocyte count, neutrophil
count, eosinophil count, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, chloride, calcium, total protein,
albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin and
procalcitonin (All P <0.05). The dynamic changes in 6 clinical laboratory parameters
of 36 severe patients, including hematological and biochemical parameters were
shown in Supplemental Figure 1.
Clinical Outcomes, Complications and Treatment
Of the all 168 patients, 160 have been discharged, 6 have died and 2 remain
hospitalized (Table 3). The median time from onset of symptoms to first hospital
visit, diagnosis and hospital admission was 1 day (IQR, 0-4), 4.5 days (IQR, 2-7)
and 5 days (IQR, 2-7), respectively (Table 4). For severe patients, the median time
from onset of symptoms to severe illness was 11 days (IQR, 7-13). For discharged
patients, the median time from onset of symptoms to discharged was 22 days (IQR,
17-27), and the median time from hospital admission to discharged was 17 days
(IQR, 12-21). For dead patients, the median time from onset of symptoms to death

was 17 days (IQR, 10.5-37.3), and the median time from hospital admission to death
was 13 days (IQR, 1.5-28.3). Follow-up of 160 discharged patients found that 20
patients (12.5%) had a positive RT-PCR test results of pharyngeal swabs or anal
swabs or faeces.
During hospital admission, the common complication was ARDS (10.1%),
secondary bacterial pneumonia (7.1%) and shock (4.2%). Compared with non-severe
patients, severe patients are more prone to almost all complications. During the
hospital admission, 97 (57.7%) and 13 (7.7%) patients received nasal catheter
oxygen and non-invasive ventilator assisted breathing, respectively. Trachea cannula
and tracheotomy were performed in 10 and 2 severe patients, respectively. 155
(92.3%) patients received antiviral treatment, 119 (70.8%) were given antibiotic
treatment, 91 (54.2%) were given immunopotentiator, 71 (42.3%) patients received
intestinal flora regulating drugs, and 27 (16.1%) were given glucocorticoid.
Discussion
Hainan province as a tropical island in southern China, the aged from the north
and middle part of China prefer to spend their winter in Hainan province due to the
warmest winter in China at end of every year, especially a part of them has
pulmonary, cardiac, metabolic disease. The conditions shaped the epidemic and
morbidity of Covid-19 and the demographics and clinical profile of Covid-19
patients distinctive from other places of China. To our knowledge, we first exemplify
the Covid-19 outbreak of a real island scenario in an imported Covid-19 epidemic
model for worldwide. To date, there are 168 confirmed cases in Hainan province,

including 129 (76.8%) imported cases. 36 (21.4%) patients developed into severe
illness after admission to the designated hospital, and fatality rate was 3.6%.
The rate of severe illness and death in our study were higher than a study
conducted in the multicenter23 and a study conducted in Wenzhou, Zhejiang
province,12 but lower than studies conducted in Wuhan.7,14,15 The reason may be that
a large number of elderly people come to Hainan at end of each year for avoiding
cold winter. 55 (32.7%) patients over 60 years old in our study, this group may have
more comorbidities, and more likely to develop into severe illness once infected with
Covid-19. Consistent with previous findings,15,23 we found that the older and patients
with comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes and CVD) were more likely to develop
severe illness. All death in patients (5 imported cases and 1 local case) have a kind of
comorbidity, 2 of them have two comorbidities. The possible reason may be the
chronic course of hypertension and diabetes leading consistent damage to the
micro-vascular walls, resulting in both inefficacy of immune cell infiltration and
drug deliver into lung areas.24,25 In our study, 8 patients were young patients aged 0
to 17 years, the youngest was 3 months and 19 days, and the oldest was 17 years old.
The 8 adolescent patients were all relatively mild without significant changes in
radiology and laboratory test, moreover, none of them progressed to critical ill case,
similar results have also reported in another study conducted in Guangzhou.26 The
mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is not clear yet and further research is
needed to explore the possible causes.
In consistence with previous studies, fever, dry cough and expectoration were

the most common symptoms in our study, and it’s worth noting that not all patients
infected with Covid-19 had fever, or fever at initial stage.23,27 Fever, as an alarm
syndrome, is less frequent in Covid-19 than other coronavirus (MERS and SARS),
so more attention should be paid to Covid-19 patients without fever for their role as
source of infection. Moreover, vomit and high fever (>39.0) is related to severe case
on admission and during hospitalization in our analysis.
The radiological abnormalities are a part of diagnosis, all patients have lesion in
radiology, and the radiological progression of Covid-19 in severe patient is gradual.
The initial radiological lesion are patchy shadows in bilateral or unilateral lower
lungs in outer bands, and then progress to 1/3 of both lower lungs, then involve both
upper lungs, and eventually develop into "white lung". In considering of Covid-19
pneumonia progression and 4 or 5 days interval from symptoms onset to diagnosis, a
lung CT scan or X-ray routinely in every 3 or 4 days were recommended for the
evaluating progression and early diagnosis of Covid-19.
In concert with recent studies in laboratory tests,7,14,23,28 lymphopenia,
thrombocytopenia and neutrocytosis in severely ill ones suggest the acute
mix-infections of bacteria, virus, and even fungi, the activation of circulating
immune cell could amplify immune response cascade, inducing both immune cell
and cytokine storm, therefore increasing chances of developing septic shock and the
organs failure. Interestingly, the decrease of eosinophils is pronounced in severe
patients in our study, and eosinophil counts are even lower in some critically ill
patients. Despite the fact that use of glucocorticoids would lead to eosinophilia, we

still observed this feature in patients without glucocorticoids administration, the
previous study also demonstrated that eosinophils percentage related the severity of
Covid-19 pneumonia.28 The decrease in eosinophil count may be an important
predictor of critically ill patients, the subsequent clinical feature analysis should
validate the predictability of eosinophil. Abnormalities in organs function and
internal disturbance focused on coagulation, liver function and electrolyte system.
Increase of D-dimer and decrease serum level of chloride and calcium occurred in
critically ill patients, indicating coagulation disorders secondary to inflammatory
cascade after severe infection and electrolyte disturbances. The oxygen therapies are
of vital importance for the progressive Covid-19, because ARDS is common
complication in severe Covid-19 patients, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio is clinical predictor in
both severity and mortality. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio of Cocid-19 patients indicated the
effect of oxygenation and the response to current therapies against hypoxemia.
For the critical illness in adults in Hainan, the common reason of severe patients
bears a long waiting time for diagnosis and intensive treatments, including a long
time from onset to consultation or a long time from the suspect to
laboratory-confirmed. The rapid progress in severe patients illustrates the importance
of shorten time of each step, so a bundle of consecutive steps including early test,
early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment for Covid-19 patients might have
contributed to a favorable outcome.
Among 160 discharged patients with Covid-19 infection who met the criteria
for hospital release of quarantine, 20 of them conversed to positive RT-PCR test

results without any clinical symptoms after 3 to34 days after discharge. At present,
the cause of the returning positive of RT-PCR still remains unclear, though there
were no evidence shows that kind of patients have the infectivity, we still suggest the
current standards for hospital discharge should be reevaluated, and the detection and
management of discharged patients should be strengthened.
Our study has some limitations. First, though we have included all the patients
of Covid-19 in Hainan province, the sample size was still relatively small and the
patients were only from Hainan province, it might be that more clinical features
related to Covid-19 would not be identified yet. Secondly, some cases had
incomplete record of the radiologic and laboratory testing, given the different
procedures among different hospitals.
In conclusion, patients infected with Covid-19 have a severe rate of 21.4% and
a fatality rate of 3.6% in Hainan province. The elderly people with diabetes,
hypertension and CVD are more likely to develop severe cases. Fever is the most
common symptom, though it does not occur in all patients before hospital admission.
In light of the rapid spread of Covid-19 around the world, and no specialized
medication to treat Covid-19, early identification and diagnosis is important for the
prevention and treatment of Covid-19 to prevent patients from developing into
critical illness.
