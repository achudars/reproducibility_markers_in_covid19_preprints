ABSTRACT
Background:
Cardiac arrhythmia cannot be overlooked in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
as it carries a great influence on the outcomes. Hence, this study aimed to build concrete
evidence regarding the incidence of cardiac arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19.
Methods:
We performed a systematic search for trusted databases/search engines including PubMed,
Scopus, Cochrane library and web of science. After screening, the relevant data were extracted
and the incidences from the different included studies were pooled for meta-analysis.
Results:
Nine studies were finally included in our study consisting of 1445 patients. The results of metaanalysis showed that the incidence of arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19 was 19.7% with
95% confidence interval (CI) ranging from 11.7 to 27.6%. There was also a significant
heterogeneity (I2=94.67%).
Conclusion:
Cardiac arrhythmias were highly frequent in patients with COVID-19 and observed in 19.7% of
them. Appropriate monitoring by electrocardiogram with accurate and early identification of
arrhythmias is important for better management and outcomes.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global health concern affecting the lives of
millions around the world1. It is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). The clinical manifestations can differ from very mild to highly severe with the
mean affection of the respiratory system which can lead to pneumonia as well as respiratory
distress syndrome2,3. Moreover, the associated involvement of other systems such as the
cardiovascular system cannot be overlooked as it carries a great influence on the outcomes2-6.
In a recent published report, cardiac involvement was showed to occur in COVID-19 even
without manifestations of respiratory tract involvement7. Several studies asserted upon the
incidence of cardiac injury in COVID-195,8. Among those reported cardiac manifestations,
cardiac arrhythmias were observed with variable estimates among studies and according to
severity levels2,6.
Cardiac arrhythmias appear to be one of the highly challenging complications of COVID-19 and
several speculations about different mechanisms were reported with a key role for proinflammatory mediators. Some of ion channels can be affected due to COVID-19 which may
lead to subsequent alterations in cardiac conduction or repolarization. Thus, it can increase the
risk for cardiac arrhythmogenesis to occur 9-12. Wang et al2 was the first to report an incidence of
17% of arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients. Most of those cases with arrhythmias were
transferred to intensive care unit. Likewise, more and higher incidence of arrhythmias (44%) was
reported in studies involving patients in the intensive care unit 2,6. Therefore, a better
understanding of the magnitude and role of cardiac arrhythmias in COVID-19 is essential for

better monitoring and management. Hence, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to
build concrete evidence regarding the incidence of cardiac arrhythmia in COVID-19.
METHODS
We adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines and Cochrane’s handbook of systematic reviews to conduct this study13,14.
Literature search
We combined the following keywords and conducted our search: “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”,
“cardiovascular” and “Arrhythmia”. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and
Cochrane Library for relevant articles to be included. An additional online and manual search
was performed on Google Scholar and Preprint Servers to ensure adequate inclusion of all
studies.
Eligibility criteria
Results were imported into Endnote X8 (Thompson Reuter, CA, USA) for duplicates deletion.
We included valid case series (>10 patients) and cohort studies including adults with COVID-19
with incidence of arrhythmia. Review articles, editorial, commentaries were excluded.
Studies selection
The first author (O.H) divided other authors into two teams; each team independently performed
title and abstract screening. Then, each team obtained the full-text of the included papers and
performed full-text screening. Any disagreement between the two teams was resolved through
consultation with the study senior (A.E).

Data extraction
The two teams extracted the data; one team performed extraction of selected outcomes and the
other team extracted baseline data, then, data were revised in a cross-revision manner. Extracted
data include author, country, year, study design, age, sex, total number of patients, and number
of patients with arrhythmia.
Risk of bias assessment
We used the Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS) which is available at
(https://www.ohri.ca/programs/clinical_epidemiology/oxford.asp) for assessing the risk of bias
for our included studies. The possible scores of this scale range from 0 to 9. Studies with a score
of seven to nine, four to six, and zero to three were classified as studies with low, moderate, and
high risk of bias, respectively.
Data synthesis and analysis
The meta-analysis of the included studies was performed using OpenMeta [Analyst] version 1.15
for conducting single-arm meta-analysis. Meta-analysis for proportions was utilized to pool the
incidence of arrhythmia in the groups. Dichotomous data were calculated to obtain risk ratios
along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity among studies was assessed
using the I2 test and P-value from the chi-squared test of heterogeneity. Values of I2 >50 and
P<0.1 are significant markers of heterogeneity among studies according to Cochrane’s
handbook14. Random effect models were used to avoid the effect heterogeneity. The statistical
significance was set with P-value at 0.05. According to Egger and colleagues, assessment of
publication bias using funnel plot method and Egger’s test is unreliable for less than 10 included

studies. Therefore, in the present study, we could not assess for publication bias due to small
number of included studies15,16.

RESULTS
Results of the literature search
We searched the aforementioned search engines/databases and found 955 studies after duplicate
removal. We excluded 946 studies as they were not eligible for inclusion according to eligibility
criteria, and a total of nine studies were finally included in our study consisting of 1445
patients2,5,6, 17-22. Figure (1) shows a summary of our search and table (1) shows the summary of
the included studies.
Baseline characteristics
Baseline characteristics are displayed in table 1. Eight of the included studies were conducted in
China while only one study reported from USA. Among the included studies, the highest mean
age was 71 years while the lowest was 55 years. Most of the included studies have a male
predominance reaching 75% of the total included patients.
Risk of bias assessment
Among our nine studies evaluated for the risk of bias, all of our studies had a low risk of bias
with score of seven or higher (Table 1).

Arrhythmia in COVID-19
The results of meta-analysis including the nine studies showed that the incidence of arrhythmia
in patients with COVID-19 was 19.7% with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 11.7 to 27.6%.
There was significant heterogeneity (I2=94.67%) which can be attributed to the variability of
reported incidences among the different included studies (Figure 2).

DISCUSSION
Previous studies has showed that compared to different systems, the cardiovascular system is
considered the second most commonly affected organ by COVID-19 after the respiratory system
2,5-8,23

. The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis showed that cardiac arrhythmia

occurred frequently in patients with COVID-19 with incidence exceeding 19% of the total cases
with covid-19. This is consistent with other individual studies reported firstly from china such as
Wang et al 2 who reported that cardiac arrhythmia occurred in 23 patients out of 138 patients
included in their study. In our study, the cumulative number of patients with both arrhythmia and
COVID-19 was 269 out of 1445 patients with COVID-19 which is slightly of higher percentage
than Wang et al2. It is known from previous meta-analyses that baseline characteristics such as
sex, hypertension, and diabetes can affect the outcomes of the pooled studies23-27 but the metaregression option was not available to assess the exact effect of those factors given that the
number of the included studies was less than 10.
There are different documented speculations to explain the association of arrhythmia with
COVID-19. For instance, this may be correlated with metabolic disruption, hypoxia, proinflammatory process, or different stressors associated coming on the line with COVID-19 28

Moreover, some of ion channels can be affected due to COVID-19 which may lead to subsequent
alterations in cardiac conduction or repolarization. Thus, it can increase the risk for cardiac
arrhythmia to occur9-11.
We noticed significant heterogeneity while performing this meta-analysis. This can be explained
by the different and variable estimates among the included studies which were the highest in Du
et al al. 20 reaching 60%. It is also worth noting that our included studies did not mention the
types of arrhythmia in specific which prevent us from subgrouping the incidence for each type.
This study can be considered the most updated and comprehensive study to assess the incidence
of COVID-19 in a suitable number of patients. However, this study suffered from several
limitations. Although the number of patients from our pooled studies was 1445 patients, the
number of studies was only nine which lead us to avoid testing for publication bias and
performing meta- regression according to the reported recommendations for those tests that need
at least 10 studies to be well performed. Moreover, the types of cardiac arrhythmias were not
specified so we could not provide more specific subgroup analysis based upon the included
studies. The studies were all observational retrospective and this type of studies has its own
known limitations. Further studies that can explore cardiac arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients
with more details on determinants are highly recommended.
To recapitulate, cardiac arrhythmias were highly frequent in patients with COVID-19 and
observed in 19.7% of them. Appropriate monitoring by electrocardiogram with accurate and
early identification of arrhythmias is important for better management and outcomes.
