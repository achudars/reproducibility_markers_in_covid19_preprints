Abstract

26

Background: We analyzed antibody response patterns according to level of disease severity in

27

patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Japan.

28

Methods: We analyzed 611 serum specimens from 231 patients with COVID-19 (mild, 170; severe,

29

31; critical, 30). IgM and IgG antibodies against nucleocapsid protein (N) and spike 1 protein (S1)

30

were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.

31

Findings: The peaks of fitting curves for the OD values of IgM and IgG antibodies against N

32

appeared simultaneously, while those against S1 were delayed compared with N. The OD values of

33

IgM against N and IgG against both N and S1 were significantly higher in the severe and critical

34

cases than in the mild cases at 11 days after symptom onset. The seroconversion rates of IgG were

35

higher than those of IgM against both N and S1 during the clinical course based on the optimal

36

cut-off values defined in this study. The seroconversion rates of IgG and IgM against N and S1 were

37

higher in the severe and critical cases than in the mild cases.

38

Conclusion: Our findings show that a stronger antibody response occurred in COVID-19 patients

39

with greater disease severity and there were low seroconversion rates of antibodies against N and S1

40

in the mild cases. The antibody response patterns in our population suggest a second infection pattern,

41

leading us to hypothesize that cross-reactivity occurs between SARS-CoV-2 and past infection with

42

other human coronaviruses.

Introduction
Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory

46

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, was initially reported in December 2019 in Wuhan,

47

China, [1] and it has since become an ongoing pandemic worldwide [2].

48

Patients with COVID-19 are predominantly asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, but

49

approximately 20% of patients develop severe disease [3]. The worldwide scientific community is

50

still searching for the mechanism of disease pathogenesis to identify an effective treatment. Recently,

51

several reports have suggested that the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 may be associated

52

with disease severity [4-10]. Identifying the antibody response patterns of target populations and the

53

differences in these patterns between patients according to disease severity will help to clarify the

54

pathogenicity and humoral immunity for SARS-CoV-2. The main antigens of SARS-CoV-2 are the

55

internal nucleocapsid protein (N) and external spike protein (S), which consists of 2 subunits (S1 and

56

S2). In particular, S1 contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that is responsible for binding to the

57

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor on host cells at the initiation of infection [11]; thus,

58

antibodies targeting S1 and RBD are expected to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/RBD

59

binding and have neutralization activity [8, 12-15].

60

Differences in antibody response patterns against each antigen between patients with

61

different levels of disease severity have been reported based on limited samples collected from

62

specific countries [9, 12]; however, it is unclear whether these response patterns can be similarly

applied to different populations. Here, we describe the differences of the antibody response patterns

64

for N and S1 and isotypes among 611 serum specimens collected from 231 Japanese patients with

65

COVID-19 with different levels of disease severity.

67

Methods

68

Patients with COVID-19 and serum specimens

69

A total of 611 serum specimens were analyzed from 231 patients with laboratory-confirmed

70

COVID-19 who were referred to and hospitalized at Saitama Medical University Hospital and

71

Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital in Japan from February 11 to May 23, 2020. Briefly, the

72

patients’ age ranged from 18 to 93 years (median, 49 years; interquartile range [IQR], 38–66 years),

73

and 138 patients (59.7%) were male and 93 (40.3%) were female. According to their presentation

74

during hospitalization, the symptomatic cases were subdivided into 3 groups at the end of

75

hospitalization. Severe symptomatic cases were defined as patients showing clinical symptoms of

76

pneumonia (percutaneous oxygen saturation < 93% and need for oxygen therapy). Critical cases

77

were defined as showing a need for oxygen therapy using a high-flow nasal cannula and

78

non-invasive positive pressure ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation. The remaining

79

symptomatic cases were classified as mild cases. Among the 231 patients, 170 (74.0%), 31 (13.4%),

80

and 30 (13.0%) were classified as having mild, severe, and critical COVID-19 at the end of the

81

hospitalization period, respectively. All patients were examined for SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative

reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) using pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal

83

swabs collected at public health institutes and hospitals in accordance with the nationally

84

recommended method in Japan [16]. In brief, the gene encoding the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 was

85

amplified by RT-qPCR using the following sets of primers and probes. N-1 set: N_Sarbeco_F1,

86

N_Sarbeco_R1, and N_Sarbeco_P1; N-2 set: NIID_2019-nCOV_N_F2, NIID_2019-nCOV_N_R2,

87

and NIID_2019-nCOV_N_P2 [16]. Serum samples were collected on admission and during

88

hospitalization. Briefly, the median number of collected serum specimens for all 231 patients was 2

89

(IQR, 1–3) samples, with 2 (IQR, 1–2) samples for the 170 mild cases, 3 (IQR, 2–4) samples for the

90

31 severe cases, and 3 samples (IQR, 2–6) for the 30 critical cases. All serum samples were stored at

91

-80°C before use in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).

94

Negative samples from patients without COVID-19
To determine the optimal cutoff value for each ELISA, we used 150 serum samples

95

collected from 150 patients at Saitama Medical University Hospital, Japan, from April to October

96

2019, before SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in China. All serum samples were stored at -80°C

before use in ELISAs.

To measure antibody titers against N and S1, a QuaResearch COVID-19 Human IgM IgG

101

ELISA Kit (Nucleocapsid Protein) (RCOEL961N; Cellspect Co., Ltd., Iwate, Japan) and

102

QuaResearch COVID-19 Human IgM IgG ELISA kit (Spike Protein-S1) (RCOEL961S1; Cellspect

103

Co., Ltd.) were used, respectively. These kits are based on the indirect ELISA method, and each kit

104

comes with different immobilized antigenic proteins. The plate of the COVID-19 Human IgM IgG

105

ELISA Kit (Nucleocapsid Protein) contains immobilized recombinant N protein (1–419 AA) of

106

SARS-CoV-2 expressed in Escherichia coli. The plate of the COVID-19 Human IgM IgG ELISA Kit

107

(Spike Protein-S1) contains immobilized recombinant S1 protein (S1, 251–660 AA) of SARS-CoV-2

108

expressed in E. coli. Serum and plasma samples were diluted 1:1000 in 1% bovine serum

109

albumin/phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20 (PBST) for ELISAs with N and S1 proteins. The

110

plates were read at 450 nm with an automated ELISA system (QRC5LB925; Cellspect Co., Ltd.) in

111

accordance with the manufacturer’s measurement protocol.

these measurements was defined as the test result. Continuous variables were expressed as the mean

127

and standard deviation (SD) or median and IQR, and compared using the t-test or Wilcoxon

128

rank-sum test for parametric or non-parametric data, respectively. The optimum cutoff OD value for

129

each ELISA was determined to minimize the OD value obtained from 150 negative samples from

130

patients without COVID-19 to ensure specificity > 98.0%. All statistical analyses were conducted

critical cases, but not in the mild cases (Figure 1A). The peaks were observed approximately 15 days

139

after symptom onset in the severe and critical cases (Figure 1A). The fitting curves for IgM-S1

140

stayed at a low level in all 3 groups (Figure 1B). The peaks of the fitting curves for IgG-N were

141

observed approximately 18 days after symptom onset in the severe and critical cases and 25 days in

142

the mild cases. The peaks were higher in the severe and critical cases than in the mild cases. The

143

peaks of the fitting curves for IgG-S1 were delayed compared with IgG-N (Figure 1C and 1D); the

144

peaks were observed approximately 28 days after symptom onset in the mild and critical cases and

145

40 days in the severe cases. The peak values were higher in the order of critical, severe, and mild

146

cases (Figure 1D).

147

Within 10 days after symptom onset, the OD values for IgM-N were lower in the critical cases

148

than in the mild cases, and then the OD values increased rapidly in the critical cases (critical vs. mild,

149

p = 0.017) (Figure 2A). There were significant differences in the OD values for IgM-N between the

150

severe and mild cases and between the critical and mild cases at 11–21 days after onset (severe vs.

151

mild, p < 0.001; critical vs. mild, p = 0.020) (Figure 2A). The OD value for IgM-S1 was higher in

152

the mild cases than in the severe and critical cases within 10 days after onset (critical vs. mild, p =

153

0.007) (Figure 2B). At 11–21 days after onset, the OD value for IgM-S1 was still significantly

154

higher in the mild cases than in the critical cases (critical vs. mild, p = 0.007) (Figure 2B), and this

155

difference disappeared at 22 days after onset (critical vs. mild, p = 0.065) (Figure 2B). There were

162

Two antibody response patterns in severe and critical cases

163

A strong IgM-N response pattern (OD > 1.5) was observed in only the severe and critical cases

164

during the clinical course (Figures 1A and 2A). A strong IgM-N pattern (OD > 1.5) was observed in

165

6.5% (2/31) of the severe cases and in 35.0% (7/30) of the critical cases. The 2 types of longitudinal

166

antibody response among samples from individual patients in the severe and critical cases are shown

167

in Figure 3: a strong IgM-N pattern (Figure 3A–C) and a weak IgM-N pattern (Figure 3D–F). In

168

the strong IgM response pattern, IgM-N and IgG-N increased simultaneously. In both response

169

patterns, the OD values of IgG-N increased earlier than those of IgG-S1 during the clinical course.

Seroconversion rate of antibodies in patients with COVID-19 in Japan
The seroconversion rates of each ELISA at the optimal cut-off value in the clinical course of

173

these patients with COVID-19 are shown in Figure 4. Based on the results for 150 negative samples

174

from patients without COVID-19, the optimal OD cutoff values were determined as 0.4 and 0.25 for

175

IgM-N and IgM-S1, respectively, and 0.7 and 0.26 for IgG-N and IgG-S1, respectively (Figure

2A-D). Among all patients, the seroconversion rate of IgG was higher than that of IgM against both

177

N and S1 during the clinical course (Figure 4A and 4B). In a comparison of the seroconversion rate

178

according to disease severity, the seroconversion rate of IgG was also higher than that of IgM against

179

both N and S1 (Figure 4C–H). Except for 1 mild case, IgG-N seroconversion was observed in all 3

180

groups during the clinical course (mild, 95.7%; severe, 100.0%; critical, 100.0%). On the other hand,

181

the seroconversion rates during the clinical course were higher in the severe and critical cases than in

182

the mild cases for IgM-N (mild, 30.4%; severe, 70.8%; critical, 61.1%), IgM-S1 (mild, 8.7%; severe,

183

44.4%; critical, 44.4%), and IgG-S1 (mild, 47.8%; severe, 88.9%; critical, 94.4%) (Figure 4C–H).

Discussion

186

Here, we presented analytical results for antibody response patterns according to disease

187

severity in patients with COVID-19 in Japan. We showed several important features of the antibody

188

response patterns in these patients. First, IgM-N and IgG-N increased at the same time, and the peak

189

OD values for IgM-N and IgG-N appeared simultaneously. In addition, we showed that the

190

seroconversion rate of IgG antibodies was higher than that of IgM antibodies, even in the early phase

191

after symptom onset (<10 days). In viral infections such as Dengue virus that can cause reinfection,

192

IgM becomes detectable earlier than IgG after the first viral infection. In the second infection, IgG is

193

detectable earlier than or around the same time as IgM, and the titer of IgG increases rapidly after

194

infection, while the titer of IgM becomes lower than during the first viral infection [17]. Sun et al.

195

and Wang et al. reported the same antibody response patterns as described here in Chinese patients

196

with COVID-19, and suggested they were affected by potential cross-reactivity of the humoral

197

response between SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses (HCoVs) [4, 10]. In Japan, no

198

outbreaks of SARS-CoV or Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV have been reported; thus,

199

cross-reactivity may have been caused by past infection with other seasonal HCoVs, such as

200

HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. Although seroprevalence data for

201

seasonal HCoVs in the Japanese population are not available, seasonal epidemics of HCoVs occur

202

mainly during the winter in Japan [18]. Thus, the seroprevalence rate of seasonal HCoVs is expected

203

to be high in the Japanese population. The antibody response patterns in our patient population

204

support the hypothesis that cross-reactivity occurred in patients with COVID-19 in Japan. In addition,

205

the low production of IgM antibody against N and S1 in our population can explain the low

206

sensitivity of serological tests for IgM antibodies in Japan [19]. Thus, it is necessary to pay attention

207

to the false-negative results of serological tests used for the initial diagnosis of COVID-19 in the

208

clinical setting.

209

Second, a stronger IgM-N, IgG-N, and IgG-S1 response was observed in the severe and

210

critical cases than in the mild cases of COVID-19, as observed in previous studies [4, 7, 10]. Several

211

viral infections, such as Dengue virus, Ebola virus, and SARS-CoV, can cause antibody-dependent

212

enhancement (ADE), which is the phenomenon by which antibodies paradoxically provide a means

213

of enhancing virus entry and replication. A high viral load can amplify the secretion of cytokines by

214

virus-infected cells and T cells and cause a cytokine storm, which consequently leads to increased

215

viral pathogenicity and disease severity [7, 20, 21]. As in other viral infections, researchers have

216

assumed that ADE may be one of the factors responsible for disease exacerbation in COVID-19 [7,

217

22]. Interestingly, a strong IgM-N response was observed in only the severe and critical cases. In

218

patients infected with Ebola virus, it has been reported that IgM antibodies against viral antigens are

219

mainly associated with ADE, and ADE may facilitate the rapid spread of the virus in the host during

220

the early phase of infection [21]. Further studies are warranted to determine whether the excess

221

production of antibodies is induced by only severe disease or if it is partly responsible for disease

222

exacerbation in patients with COVID-19.

223

Third, a low seroconversion rate and weak response for IgG-S1 were observed in the mild

224

cases. In our study, seroconversion of IgG-S1 antibody was observed in 47.8% of the mild cases,

225

while it was detected in approximately 90% of the severe and critical cases. Several reports have also

226

shown correlations between IgG-S1, RBD, and neutralizing antibody levels with disease severity,

227

and a relatively low level of antibodies is observed in mild cases [23, 24]. It is assumed that

228

SARS-CoV-2 infection is well controlled by the innate immune response and cellular immunity in

229

mild cases. Additionally, Long et al. and Ibarrondo et al. showed the time course of a decrease in

230

neutralizing antibodies at 2–3 months after initial infection in mild and asymptomatic cases [25, 26].

231

Taken together, patients who are asymptomatic and mild cases may have low levels of antibodies and

232

a short period of humoral immunity.

233

This study has some limitations. First, we used only commercial ELISAs to detect the

234

antibodies; thus, it is possible that the antibody response patterns are assay-specific. There is a

235

possibility that the absence of seroconversion in several patients was caused by the test conditions

236

and antigens used in the ELISAs utilized in our study. Second, cross-reactivity between

237

SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal HCoVs in COVID-19 was suspected, but it was not examined in this

238

study. Further investigations are required to verify the antibody response patterns by using several

239

different serological methods and to examine cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal

240

HCoVs.

241

242

Conclusion

243

The findings of this study showed a stronger antibody response in Japanese patients with

244

more severe COVID-19 and a low seroconversion rate of IgG-S1 in mild cases after infection. In

245

addition, the antibody response patterns in the Japanese population suggest that there is

246

cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and past infection with other HCoVs.
