ABSTRACT

44
45

Background

46

Transgender and non-binary people are disproportionately burdened by barriers to quality

47

healthcare, mental health challenges, and economic hardship. This study examined the impact

48

of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and subsequent control measures on

49

gender-affirming care, mental health, and economic stability among transgender and non-binary

50

people globally.

51
52

Methods

53

We collected global cross-sectional data from 964 transgender and non-binary adult users of

54

the Hornet and Her apps from April to August 2020 to characterize changes in gender-affirming

55

care, mental health, and economic stability as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We

56

conducted Poisson regression models to assess if access to gender-affirming care and ability to

57

live according to one’s gender were related to depressive symptoms, anxiety, and changes in

58

suicidal ideation.

59
60

Results

61

Individuals resided in 76 countries, including Turkey (27.4%,n=264/964) and Thailand

62

(20.6%,n=205). A majority were non-binary (66.8%,n=644) or transfeminine (29.4%,n=283).

63

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 55.0% (n=320/582) reported reduced access to gender-

64

affirming resources, and 38.0% (n=327/860) reported reduced time lived according to their

65

gender. About half screened positive for depression (50.4%,442/877) and anxiety

66

(45.8%,n=392/856). One in six (17.0%,n=112/659) expected losses of health insurance, and

67

77.0% (n=724/940) expected income reductions. The prevalence of depressive symptoms,

68

anxiety, and increased suicidal ideation were 1.63 (95% CI: 1.36-1.97), 1.61 (95% CI: 1.31-

70

affirming resources was reduced versus not.

Discussion

73

The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced access to gender-affirming resources and the ability of

74

transgender and non-binary people to live according to their gender worldwide. These

75

reductions may drive the increased depressive symptoms, anxiety, and suicidal ideation

76

reported in this sample. To improve transgender and non-binary health globally, increased

77

access to gender-affirming resources should be achieved through policies (e.g., digital

78

prescriptions), flexible interventions (e.g., telehealth), and support for existing transgender

79

health initiatives.

INTRODUCTION

81

The global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in more than 37 million

82

cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and over one million deaths.1 In response,

83

countries have implemented a wide range of measures to quell its spread — shelter-in-place

84

orders, closures of business and schools, and the cancellation of surgeries perceived to be

85

elective.2 While these interventions are focused on reducing COVID-19 cases and increasing

86

healthcare capacity, they have also negatively affected healthcare access, mental health, and

87

economic stability worldwide.3–6

88
89

A growing body of literature describes global interruptions to prescriptions for diseases like HIV,

90

increases in depression, and significant losses of job, insurance, and food security as a result of

91

the COVID-19 pandemic.7–11 However, recent work has demonstrated that these effects

92

disproportionately burden groups that have been historically marginalized. Specifically,

93

pandemic control measures have exacerbated existing health disparities and social inequities

94

along lines of poverty and occupation, race and ethnicity, and sexual orientation.12–16 The

95

COVID-19 pandemic may also uniquely affect transgender and non-binary people.

96
97

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, transgender and non-binary individuals experienced barriers

98

to care, greater mental health challenges, and economic vulnerabilities caused by stigma,

99

discrimination, and minority stress.17–19 Transgender and non-binary populations face a scarcity

100

of clinicians trained in gender-affirming practices and widespread transphobia among healthcare

101

staff, both of which make healthcare less accessible.20–22 Yet access to gender-affirming

102

healthcare (e.g., chest/breast surgery), services (e.g., hair removal), and goods (e.g., binders

103

and packers) can substantially improve the quality of life and mental health of transgender and

104

non-binary populations, who frequently have elevated levels of depression, anxiety, and suicidal

105

ideation.23–26 A disproportionate number of transgender and non-binary individuals also

106

experience structural vulnerabilities, such as economic, food, and housing insecurity, that can

107

reinforce or worsen barriers to gender-affirming resources and mental health counseling.27,28

108
109

The COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating these risks among transgender and non-binary

110

individuals. For example, there have been documented cancellations and delays in gender-

111

affirming surgeries;29 such delays and cancellations have previously been connected to

112

negative mental health consequences.23,30 Furthermore, many transgender and non-binary

113

individuals who were living according to their gender prior to the COVID-19 pandemic have had

114

to return to living according to their sex assigned at birth upon moving in with relatives.31

115

Researchers have also reported on gendered policies from Panama, Peru, and Columbia that

116

attempted to reduce the density of crowds in public places by requiring women and men to

117

access essential services on alternating days — a policy that, like other gender-based laws,

118

would likely result in violence against transgender communities.32 In these situations,

119

transgender and non-binary individuals may be limited in their ability to live safely and

120

comfortably as themselves. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to be especially

121

adverse for those who are already economically marginalized, occupying other marginalized

122

identities (e.g., people who are racial or ethnic minorities, living with HIV, or living with

123

disabilities), or both.

124
125

Of the studies to date about the impact of COVID-19 on transgender and non-binary individuals,

126

a majority have been conducted in a single country like the United States and focused on

127

measuring a narrow spectrum of indicators. The objective of this study was to describe the

128

global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent control measures on gender-affirming

129

care, mental health, and economic stability among transgender and non-binary individuals. We

130

also examined the association between reduced access to gender-affirming care and ability to

131

live according to one’s gender with multiple mental health indicators.

METHODS

133

Study Design and Participants

134

For this cross-sectional study, we used data from the global COVID-19 Disparities Survey

135

distributed between April 16 and August 3, 2020 via Hornet and Her — social networking apps

136

marketed to sexual minorities, both cisgender and transgender. We sent survey invitations to

137

the app-specific inboxes of all users who had been active on their app for at least one year. To

138

take the survey, individuals had to report being 18 years or older, view a consent form, and

139

indicate their informed consent by clicking a button to begin.

140
141

A total of 24,618 individuals began the survey. For these analyses, we included 1,285

142

transgender and non-binary adults, which we defined as people 18 years or older who self-

143

reported being transgender, non-binary, or a gender different than their sex assigned at birth.

144

We excluded all women assigned female or intersex at birth (n=161), all men assigned male or

145

intersex at birth (n=12,740), individuals who did not report a gender (n=9,751), individuals who

146

only reported not knowing, not wishing to disclose, or being unable to disclose their gender

147

(n=654), and non-transgender identifying men and women who did not report an assigned sex

148

at birth (n=27).

149
150

To ensure the quality of our study population, we screened for duplicate survey responses

151

based on IP address, and again by searching for identical responses to twenty randomly

152

selected variables but found none. We also excluded individuals who completed 89% or less of

153

the survey (n=271), who finished in less than the minimum piloted time of seven minutes (n=47),

154

or provided conflicting responses for multiple questions (n=3) for a final sample size of 964. The

155

Johns Hopkins School of Public Health Institutional Review Board provided a Category 4

156

exemption to the larger survey prior to distribution.

Demographic Measures

159

Individuals self-reported gender by choosing any number of the following options: woman, man,

160

transgender man, transgender woman, or non-binary (including gender-diverse, genderqueer,

161

gender nonconforming, gender expansive, and agender). They also self-reported their country

162

of residence, age, socioeconomic status, years of education, ethnic minority and immigration

163

status, access to masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether the government in their

164

area had ever imposed confinement orders (e.g., mobility restrictions to stay-at-home). We

165

categorized countries according to regions defined by the World Health Organization.

166
167

We used eight mutually exclusive categories to describe reported genders. To increase the

168

power for our analyses, we then collapsed individuals into three groups, building on

169

recommendations from Reisner et al: (1) transmasculine, i.e., people who were assigned female

170

at birth (AFAB) or intersex who self-reported being transgender or being a man; (2)

171

transfeminine , i.e., people who were assigned male at birth (AMAB) or intersex who self-

172

reported being transgender or being a woman; and (3) non-binary, i.e., individuals who reported

173

being either solely non-binary, both a man and a woman, or a transgender man and

174

transgender woman.

175
176

We chose to operationalize three gender categories for multiple reasons. First, while some non-

177

binary individuals explicitly reported also being transgender, the majority did not. We wanted to

178

honor this distinction while also allowing for individuals who reported being both men and

179

women to transcend the transfeminine versus transmasculine binary. Second, our survey

180

presented a limited number of gender options to a global audience in which being a third gender

181

(e.g., two-spirit, bissu, fa’afafine, qariwarmi) is distinct from many Western concepts of being

182

transgender 33. Lastly, in line with recommendations from Restar et al., we saw statistically

183

significant differences when comparing non-binary individuals with transmasculine and

184

transfeminine individuals 34. Therefore, presenting results stratified by gender (i.e., a “gender-

185

specific” approach) was more appropriate than conducting analyses on all individuals together

186

and presenting them as a single population (i.e., a “gender-inclusive” approach).

187
188

COVID-19 Impact Measures

189

Individuals answered questions about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting

190

response on their access to gender-affirming resources, their mental health, and their economic

191

stability. For indicators related to gender-affirming resources, we asked those who self-identified

192

as transgender or non-binary (n=865) whether the COVID-19 pandemic limited their access to

193

the following: hormone therapy and/or medications; surgical aftercare materials (e.g., vaginal

194

dilators); cosmetic supplies and services (e.g. makeup, wigs, and hair removal); mental health

195

counseling and therapy services; and body modifiers (e.g., binders and packing materials); to

196

which they could respond, “Yes,” “No,” or “Not Applicable.” We characterized the severity of

197

interruptions to gender-affirming care by whether individuals reported that more than one

198

resource had been impacted. We also asked whether the COVID-19 pandemic had changed the

199

amount of time that the individual could live according to their gender (“Compared to before the

200

COVID-19 crisis, how often are you able to live according to your gender identity?”). We

201

categorized the five-point Likert scale into three categories: More than before (i.e., more or a lot

202

more as compared to before COVID-19), about the same as before COVID-19, and less than

203

before (i.e., less than or not at all as compared to before COVID-19).

204
205

For mental health indicators, we used the 4-item patient health questionnaire (PHQ-4) to screen

206

for common symptoms of depression and anxiety, which we dichotomized with a score of three

207

or more being considered positive

208

(“Have you been feeling lonely since the COVID crisis began?”) using a four-point Likert Scale,

209

which we dichotomized into a positive sentiment (“not lonely” or “not much lonely”) and negative

35

. We assessed the impact of COVID-19 on loneliness

210

sentiment (“very much lonely” or “a little lonely”). We also asked how often they had thought

211

about taking their own life presently and in the six months prior to the COVID-19 pandemic with

212

the following answer options: “never,” “seldom,” “quite often,” “very often,” and “all the time.” We

213

created four categories to describe changes from pre- to mid-pandemic: was and remains rare

214

(i.e., “never” or “seldom”), was and remains frequent (i.e., “quite often,” “very often,” or “all the

215

time”), decreased, or increased. To characterize resiliency, we asked about the following in the

216

face of the COVID-19 pandemic: if they had “sources of hope, strength, comfort, and peace”; if

217

they were “intent on finding emotional support and therapy for themselves”; and if they believed

218

that they were able to “live a happy, full life despite the crisis.”

219
220

Statistical Analyses

221

We conducted descriptive analyses of demographic measures and presented descriptions of

222

the COVID-19 impact measures stratified by gender, using chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests

223

as appropriate. We also stratified results by country in the supplementary materials. We used

224

Poisson regression models with complete case analyses to assess for differences in the

225

prevalence of screening positive for depression and anxiety among individuals with reduced

226

(versus continued) access to gender-affirming resources and individuals who reported being

227

able to live according to their gender less (versus more) since the COVID-19 pandemic started.

228

We reported these comparisons as prevalence ratios. We used the same approach to assess

229

the impact of reductions in access to care and changes in ability to live according to one’s

230

gender on changes in suicidal ideation, stratified on baseline levels of suicidal ideation. We

231

conducted all analyses in Stata version 14.36

232

RESULTS

233

These analyses primarily consisted of non-binary (66.8%, n=644/964) and transfeminine

234

(29.4%, n=283) individuals (Table 1). About 47% (n=451) were from the European region and

235

25.1% (n=242) were from the South-East Asia region. There were 76 countries represented in

236

the sample; a majority of individuals were residents of Turkey (27.4%, n=264), Thailand (20.6%,

237

n=199), and Russia (11.5%, n=117). No other single country accounted for more than 5% of the

238

sample. Individuals were young and highly educated, with 50.5% (n=487) being between 18 and

239

29 years old and 42.6% (n=410) having at least a university degree. Few (12.7%, n=122) had

240

ever lacked access to a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic and 75.6% (n=729) lived in a

241

country that had issued COVID-related confinement or “stay-at-home” orders.

242
243

More than half (55%, n=320/582) of the sample reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had

244

limited their access to one or more gender-affirming resource (Table 2). Mental health

245

counseling and therapy was the most commonly cited resource to be affected (42.9%,

246

n=192/448), with a somewhat greater proportion of transmasculine individuals reporting reduced

247

access to counseling (61.9%, n=13/21) than non-binary (43.0%, n=122/284) and transfeminine

248

(39.9%, n=57/143) individuals (p-value=0.16). Transmasculine and transfeminine individuals

249

were more likely than non-binary individuals to report that the COVID-19 pandemic limited their

250

access to gender-affirming hormones and medications (55.0% [n=11/20] and 42.1% [n=61/145]

251

vs. 30.1% [n=71/236], p-value=0.01) as well as surgical aftercare materials (42.9% [n=6/14]

252

and 40.2% [n=51/127] vs. 28.8% [n=62/215], p-value=0.08). All geographic regions reported

253

reductions in access to gender-affirming resources; at least half of the individuals in each

254

region, beside the Western Pacific, reported reduced access to one or more resource (S1

255

Table). More than a third (38.0%, n=327/860) of individuals reported that the COVID-19

256

pandemic had reduced or completely eliminated their ability to live according to their gender,

257

with more transfeminine individuals (43.1%, n=100/232) being unable to living according to their

gender as compared to transmasculine (28.6%, n=8/28) and non-binary (36.5%, n=219/600)

259

individuals (p-value <0.001).

260
261

About half of the sample screened positive for depression (50.4%, n=442/877) and anxiety

262

(45.8%, n=392/856), with a larger proportion of transfeminine individuals reporting these

263

outcomes than transmasculine and non-binary individuals (Table 3). Overall, 10.0% (n=93/928)

264

reported that suicidal ideation had increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 12.5%

265

(n=116) reported that it had decreased. Transfeminine individuals were more likely to report

266

increases in suicidal ideation (11.6%, n=31/263) while being less likely to agree with statements

267

of resiliency, such as having sources of hope, strength, comfort, and peace (47.9%, n=100/209)

268

when contrasted with transmasculine (8.3%, n=3/36; 71.0%, n=22/31) and non-binary (9.5%,

269

n=59/624; 69.5%, n=367/528) individuals (p-value=0.98; p-value < 0.001). Sixteen percent

270

(n=136/851) of individuals reported that they were not intent on finding emotional support and

271

therapy for themselves during the COVID-19 pandemic. Seventy-seven percent (n=724/940) of

272

the sample expected a reduction in their income, 17% (n=112/659) expected to lose health

273

insurance, and 53.4% (n=428/801) reported not having received financial aid, despite need

274

(Table 4). Though 40% (n=361/900) of individuals overall reported cutting or reducing their

275

meals, fewer non-binary individuals had done so (34.9% [n=212/607] versus 51.4% [n=18/35] of

276

transmasculine individuals and 50.8% [n=131/258] of transfeminine individuals).

common among those who had lost access to one or more gender-affirming resource during the

280

COVID-19 pandemic as compared to those without reductions in access (Table 5). Similarly, a

281

positive screen for anxiety was 1.61 (95% CI: 1.31-1.97) times more common among those who

282

had lost access to one or more gender-affirming resource compared to those without reductions

in access. Trends were similar for suicidal ideation. For example, among those with rare or no

285

access to gender-affirming resources were 1.74 (95% CI: 1.07, 2.82) times more likely to report

286

increased suicidal ideation. Screening positive for depression and anxiety were also 1.21 (95%

the COVID-19 pandemic had decreased the amount of time they could live according to their

289

gender, versus those who had increased that time. However, among individuals who had no or

290

rare suicidal ideation prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, a smaller proportion of those living less

291

according to their gender during the COVID-19 pandemic had increased suicidal ideation

292

compared to those who lived more as their gender (prevalence ratio = 0.57 [95% CI: 0.33-

0.98]).

DISCUSSION

296

This survey provides early insights into the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to

297

gender-affirming resources, mental health, and economic stability among transgender and non-

298

binary communities globally. Roughly half of individuals reported that the COVID-19 pandemic

299

had restricted their access to gender-affirming resources, and nearly two in five reported the

300

COVID-19 pandemic had negatively impacted their ability to live according to their gender.

301

Screening positive for depression and/or anxiety and increases in suicidal ideation were

302

common, but more so for those who experienced reduced access to gender-affirming

303

resources. Of these resources, counseling and therapy were the most affected by COVID-19,

304

but most people who responded to the survey also reported resiliencies, such as having

305

sources of hope and being intent on finding emotional support. This intent to seek support,

306

however, may be dampened by the fact that many individuals expected reductions in income

307

and loss of health insurance. This is the first empirical study to examine the effect of COVID-19

308

and its impact on gender-affirming resources, mental health, and economic stability among a

309

global, multi-region sample of transgender and non-binary individuals.

310
311

Half of the individuals in our survey reported reduced access to one or more gender-affirming

312

resource. This was higher in our sample than in an online survey of 1,240 transgender and non-

313

binary individuals in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria.29 A third or more of individuals from the

314

European region in our study reported reductions in access to hormone therapy and surgical

315

aftercare materials, which was higher than the 18% and 3% of individuals from the European-

316

specific survey respectively. That survey also found about a quarter of individuals had delayed

317

or cancelled aftercare for a recent surgery. Differences may be due to the populations sampled,

318

as our survey primarily drew from countries in Eastern Europe where there is substantial stigma

319

against and policing of transgender individuals. Together, though, these results signify that the

320

COVID-19 pandemic is causing decreases in access to gender-affirming resources even in

321

high-income settings.

322
323

Our study demonstrated that reduced access to gender-affirming resources due to the COVID-

324

19 pandemic were associated with poorer mental health. Screening positive for depression,

325

screening positive for anxiety, and increased suicidal ideation were more common for those

326

whose access to one or more gender affirming resource had been reduced due to the COVID-

327

19 pandemic. These results mirror anecdotal data from clinics serving transgender patients in

328

China.37 Gender-affirming resources are crucial to transgender and non-binary individuals, as

329

these resources often activate and enhance the interactive process of receiving recognition for

330

their gender, sense of self, and sense of humanity.38 Given the abundant literature that gender

331

affirmation results in better mental health and quality of life, these data underscore the

332

importance of ensuring that transgender and non-binary individuals have access to these

333

essential services and products.23,24,30,39–41 Access to these resources should also be fortified to

334

avoid negative physical health outcomes. For example, about a third of this sample reported

335

reductions in access to hormones and 17% reported that they expected to lose their health

336

insurance, which may support hormone therapy procurement. These disruptions may force

337

some transgender and non-binary individuals to discontinue hormone therapy or mete out their

338

limited doses to last longer. Sustained interruptions or sub-optimal dosing of hormone therapy

339

have been connected with symptoms of hypogonadism, such as osteoporosis and

340

cardiovascular disease.42 Similarly, aftercare for gender-affirming surgeries is critical for

341

avoiding negative physical outcomes like urinary tract hesitancy and needing re-operation, yet a

342

third of individuals in this study reported that they had reduced access to the surgical aftercare

343

that they needed.43

345

A third of individuals reported decreased time lived according to their gender. In comparison, a

346

poll conducted by the Trevor Project in the United States of 600 lesbian, gay, bisexual,

347

transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth (13-19 years) reported that 56% of the

348

transgender and non-binary individuals had reduced their ability to express their LGBTQ identity

349

due to the COVID-19 pandemic.44 Youth often attributed needing to move back in with

350

unsupportive caretakers as a reason for not being able to live according to their gender,31,44

351

which may explain the elevated proportion compared to adults in our study. Living less

352

according to one’s gender during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with screening

353

positive for depression and anxiety. However, a counterintuitive result was found among

354

individuals in our study who had rare suicidal ideation prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and lived

355

more according to their gender during the COVID-19 pandemic. This subset of the sample was

356

more likely to have increased suicidal ideation as compared to individuals who were living

357

according to their gender less. These results, however, may reflect a limitation of our

358

measurement tool. For example, the former group likely had a low baseline ability to live

359

according to their gender pre-pandemic and hence could only increase the amount of time lived

360

according to their gender. The worse mental health in this group may be linked to low pre-

361

pandemic levels of living according to their gender, rather than the recent increase in their ability

362

to do so. Because we did not measure pre-pandemic and current ability to live according to

363

one’s gender separately, we could not control for baseline levels in the model. It is also possible

364

that people who recently began living in their gender more may be subjected to elevated levels

365

of anticipated and experienced stigma that could be driving increased suicidality; prior research

366

has shown discrimination due to gender expression, rather than gender identity itself, to be

367

associated with mental distress.45–47

368
369

Positive screens for depression and anxiety were correlated with decreases in access to

370

gender-affirming care and decreased time lived according to one’s gender, and were present in

nearly half the sample. These data align with results from transgender and non-binary youth

372

from the Trevor Project poll and another sample of 201 young adults (19-25 years) attending

373

college, both from the U.S.44,48 Findings in a small study of 15 Latinx trans women in the United

374

States suggest that these poor mental health indicators represent declines as a result of the

375

COVID-19 pandemic rather than just a high baseline prevalence.49 These findings are

376

particularly concerning when contrasted against the large proportion of individuals in this and

377

other studies who reported that COVID-19 had decreased their access to mental health therapy

378

and counseling.44,48 To mitigate the immediate trauma of the COVID-19 pandemic and potential

379

long-lasting effects, innovative mental health interventions — from remote video and phone

380

therapy to self-help apps — have been emerging, but additional investments are needed,

381

especially to reach those with limited to no access to Internet.50,51 Furthermore, our findings

382

support the notion that transmasculine, transfeminine, and non-binary populations are having

383

distinct experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and should receive gender-specific

384

support.37 For example, transmasculine individuals were more likely to report having reduced

385

access to gender-affirming resources but generally reported better mental health outcomes, as

386

well as having sources of strength and comfort. Combined with the fact that transgender and

387

non-binary youth have been more likely to reach out to friends and family than cisgender

388

lesbian, gay, and pansexual youth according to the Trevor Project data, it may be possible to

389

enhance these resiliencies by strengthening and expanding trauma-informed, online peer-to-

390

peer support efforts such as Q Chat Space

391

transfeminine, transmasculine, and non-binary individuals may be needed.

Lastly, we found that transgender and non-binary communities worldwide are experiencing

394

strains across basic needs such as finances, food, and health insurance, all as a result of

395

COVID-19 pandemic. These strains, in addition to pre-existing economic vulnerabilities, will

396

contribute to even greater barriers to gender-affirming care, mental health counseling, services,

397

and products.27 For example, approximately 10% of transgender and non-binary individuals in

398

the U.S. lacked health insurance before the COVID-19 pandemic.27 Though some may have

399

health insurance through their employers, transgender and non-binary people are also more

400

likely to be employed in the industries most impacted by business shutdowns.12 We found that

401

more than three quarters of the sample expected a reduction in their income, one in six

402

expected to lose their health insurance, and more than half reported needing and not receiving

403

financial aid. These results display the pronounced structural vulnerabilities that shape

404

experiences of transgender and non-binary communities in the current context of the COVID-19

405

pandemic, and likely contribute further as stressors to mental health. These stressors may climb

406

as transgender and non-binary communities continue to experience worsening economic

407

instability due to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated control measures. Further research is

408

necessary to examine the syndemic impact of COVID-19-related stressors on transgender and

409

non-binary communities, particularly those who are experiencing multiple, intersectional

410

stressors at the individual, interpersonal, and structural levels.

411
412

This study had some limitations. While the survey reached individuals from six continents and

413

was available in 13 languages, these data are not a representative sample of transgender and

414

non-binary individuals worldwide. As a survey distributed through a mobile app, participation

415

was limited to individuals with Internet and a smartphone. Individuals in the survey were also

416

generally highly educated. Our survey likely missed highly disadvantaged individuals, and

417

consequently, likely underestimates the true magnitude of impact of COVID-19 on this

418

community. Our study also had a methodological limitation in its categorization of genders

419

— while we aimed to offer an inclusive set of options, we did not capture the full spectrum nor

420

fluidity of genders across the cultural diversity of the countries represented. Yet, our sample

421

does present results from a large number of non-binary individuals, which is a population that

422

has generally been understudied but increasingly recognized as distinct from binary transgender

423

individuals.53 Furthermore, the survey only presented questions about access to gender-

424

affirming resources to individuals who self-identified as transgender (e.g., versus those who

425

selected being a man and were AFAB but did self-report as transgender). The next wave of data

426

collection will present the module to all persons whose sex assigned at birth does not match

427

their current gender.

428
429

The findings of the current study provide insights for future directions. Namely, future research

430

should expand on this work by identifying protective factors that can be potentially leveraged to

431

buffer the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on gender-affirming resources, mental health, and

432

economic stability. There is also a need to contextualize and understand how transgender and

433

non-binary communities are currently responding to the economic instabilities due to the

434

epidemic, particularly in regions where mandatory stay-at-home orders remain. These

435

restrictions may have led or will lead some transgender and non-binary individuals to turn to

436

more dangerous work for income, unregulated and unmonitored markets for gender-affirming

437

services or goods, or the use of alcohol and other substances to cope. Lastly, given the mobile

438

and online nature of recruitment for this study, researchers should look for feasibility and

439

opportunity with Hornet and other mobile apps as a platform for outreach, programming, and

440

interventions for transgender and non-binary communities in regions where the apps are

441

utilized.

442
443

CONCLUSION

444

Along with these research implications, our findings suggest the need for multiple programmatic

445

interventions specific to transgender and non-binary populations. Maintaining and increasing

446

secure access to lifesaving gender-affirming resources, mental health services, and economic

447

stability will require backing from both typical and atypical sources — from nonprofit

448

organizations to for-profit companies to academic researchers — both during and after the

COVID-19 pandemic. This could include, for example, instrumental support according to

450

community needs (e.g., coordinating food bank deliveries or monetary support for bills) or

451

resource mapping to help transgender and non-binary individuals identify where they can seek

452

pandemic-related relief and aid without stigma or discrimination

453

healthcare facilities could also transparently communicate changes in policies and logistics for

454

gender-affirming services to alleviate anxieties around loss of access due to pandemic control

455

measures. To prevent detrimental mental health consequences due to inaccessibility of gender-

456

affirming resources and economic hardships, rapid policies (e.g., digital prescription refills) and

457

flexible interventions (e.g., telehealth) are needed to maintain continuity of gender-affirming

458

hormones as well as therapy and counseling. To achieve these interventions, innovative

459

partnerships will be needed to reach the most marginalized— both by supporting trans-led,

460

community-based organizations to maintain and expand their transgender health services as

461

well as by increasing the capabilities of nation- and/or state-sponsored programs and private

sector companies to better serve transgender and non-binary communities.
