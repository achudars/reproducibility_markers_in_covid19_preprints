The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) became a pandemic and a global health
emergency. The SARS‐CoV‐2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly
expressed in nasal epithelial cells and plays a major role in cellular entry leading to
infection. High expression of ACE2 has been suggested to be a potential risk factor for
virus infection and disease severity. However the profile of ACE2 gene expression in
diseases of the upper airways remains poorly understood. We herein investigated ACE2
gene expression in the nasal tissues of a cohort of Swedish patients with chronic
rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNPs) using RT-qPCR. ACE2 mRNA expression
was significantly reduced in the nasal mucosa of CRSwNP patients compared to that of
controls. Moreover, we observed a sex-dependant difference in nasal ACE2 expression,
where significantly lower levels of the ACE2 transcript were detected in the nasal mucosa
of only female CRSwNP patients. These findings indicate that CRSwNP patients with a
decrease in ACE2 gene expression may thereby be less prone to be infected by SARSCoV-2. These results enhance our understanding on the profile of ACE2 expression in the
nasal mucosa of patients with upper airway diseases, and their susceptibility to infection
with SARS-CoV-2.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the detection of the virus in Wuhan, China, COVID-19
has spread worldwide, and the high transmissibility of the virus along with the high fatality rate
of the disease has caused a global health emergency [1,2]. Whilst the most common symptoms
of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 include fever and cough, a proportion of patients
additionally exhibit multi-organ damage and dysfunction including acute respiratory distress
syndrome, acute respiratory injury and acute renal injury [3]. Another very specific symptom

which has been established for COVID-19 includes the loss of smell [4]. Further, patients with

comorbidities such as hypertension, pulmonary disease and diabetes are highly represented
among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [5,6]. This suggests that the presence of risk
factors may determine the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is hence an urgent
need to learn more about the mechanisms involved in human infection and the factors that
determine disease severity in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive sense, single stranded ribonucleic acid enveloped virus comprising
of glycoprotein spike (S) on its outer surface which mediates its entry into the cell [7]. It has
recently been shown that SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as
its receptor to gain entry into the cell [7]. In order to fully understand the susceptibility for
SARS-CoV-2 infection and the role of ACE2 in the disease severity, a major focus has
therefore been aimed at uncovering the cell type-specific gene expression of ACE2 in human
tissues. Several studies have recently reported on the gene expression of ACE2 in the
respiratory tract. A study of infected COVID-19 patients documented a significantly higher
SARS-CoV-2 viral load in nasal swab samples compared to those of throat swabs [8]. Higher
ACE2 gene expression has been reported in the nasal compared to throat tissue [9], where
ACE2 has been shown to be more highly expressed in the upper respiratory tract compared to
the lower, implicating the upper respiratory epithelium as the most likely port of entry for
SARS-CoV-2 [10]. Moreover, whereas ACE2 has been shown to be expressed in the epithelial
support and stem cells [11], it has also been shown to be co-expressed in the nasal epithelium
with genes involved in innate immunity, referring to the potential role of these cells in initiating
SARS-CoV-2 infection [12]. Whilst higher ACE2 expression in the upper respiratory
epithelium suggests that these cells can serve as a reservoir for viral invasion and facilitate
SARS-CoV-2 replication, it is not clear whether any potential underlying factors may affect
the expression of ACE2 receptors and therefore increase the severity of the disease. An
increased expression of ACE2 has recently been reported in the lungs of patients with
comorbidities, suggesting that patients with comorbidities may have a higher risk of developing
severe COVID-19 by facilitating SARS-Cov-2 entry into the lungs during infection [13].
Moreover, the infection mediated by SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to increase in severity with
age [14,15], where an age-dependant expression of ACE2 has been reported in the nasal
epithelium, with lower ACE2 expression found in children which increases with age [16].
Herein, we sought to investigate whether chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP),
influences the expression of ACE2 in the nasal tissues and hence might influence the risk of
infectivity with SARS-CoV-2.
CRSwNP is defined as a subgroup of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) that is characterised by the
presence of fleshy swellings (nasal polyps) of the nasal mucosa, developing in the lining of the
nose and paranasal sinuses, presumably due to chronic inflammation. CRSwNP is difficult to
treat and recurrences are frequent, despite medical treatment and surgical interventions.
Additionally, patients suffering from CRSwNP are often as affected by chronic asthma [17,18].
Given that CRS affects 3-15% of the population in the US and Europe, with a prevalence of
2.7% in Sweden [19–21], the major focus of this study was therefore to determine whether
ACE2 expression is altered in patients with CRSwNP. To achieve this, RT-qPCR was used to
evaluate the expression of the ACE2 mRNA transcript in the nasal epithelium of patients with
CRSwNP. To determine whether there were any differences in ACE2 expression, tissue
samples from patients were collected from non-polyp ‘healthy’ tissue and adjacent polyp tissue,
as well as from control individuals without CRSwNP.

Recent studies have demonstrated that ACE2 is highly expressed in the nasal epithelial cells,
highlighting the importance of the upper airway tissues as the primary target site of SARS‐
CoV‐2 [9–11]. To determine ACE2 mRNA expression in the nasal epithelium of CRSwNP
patients, we performed RT-qPCR on total RNA extracted from concha inferior or middle and
polyp mucosa in a total of 16 patients and 18 non-CRSwNP controls. We found that ACE2
mRNA expression was significantly reduced in the nasal mucosa of non-polyp ‘healthy tissue’
of CRSwNP patients compared to that of non-CRSwNP controls, and in turn ACE2 expression
in non-polyp ‘healthy tissue’ was significantly reduced compared to that of their adjacent polyp
tissue (Figure 1). However, no significant differences in expression of the ACE2 gene transcript
were observed between healthy CRSwNP controls and polyp tissues of CRSwNP patients
(Figure 1). Taken together, these observations indicate that patients with CRSwNP may have
a lower risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection due to lower expression levels of ACE2 gene.
Whilst an age-dependant gene expression of ACE2 has recently been reported [16], the impact
of gender on ACE2 gene expression remains poorly understood. Here we found that ACE2
mRNA levels significantly differ between female CRSwNP patients compared to that of males.
More specifically, we found that ACE2 mRNA expression was significantly reduced in the
nasal mucosa of female non-polyp ‘healthy tissue’ of CRSwNP patients compared to that of
non-CRSwNP female controls, whereas no significant differences were observed in males
(Figure 2 and Table 1). Moreover, ACE2 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in
non-polyp ‘healthy tissue’ of female CRSwNPs patients compared to their adjacent polyp
tissue, where no significant differences were observed in males (Figure 2 and Table 1). Taken
together, our results indicate a gender bias of ACE2 expression in CRSwNP patients, where
females with CRSwNPs have a lower expression of nasal ACE2 gene expression.
The mechanisms driving altered susceptibility to COVID-19 remains a crucial question for the
field. The high expression of ACE2 has been suggested to be a potential risk factor for virus
invasion, therefore understanding the association between CRS and ACE2 expression is
particularly important for the management of upper airway conditions which may help to
predict the patient’s susceptibility to COVID-19. In this study we have demonstrated that
ACE2 is differentially expressed in the nasal tissue of patients with CRSwNPs compared to
healthy individuals, where ACE2 gene expression is significantly reduced in non-polyp
‘healthy tissue’ of CRSwNP patients but not adjacent polyp tissue. These changes seem to
occur in a sex dependent manner where changes to the ACE2 gene transcript is only observed
within female patients in a more profound manner. This is the first study to report a lower
ACE2 gene expression in the nasal tissue of females CRSwNPs patients compared to that of
CRSwNPs males. Taken together, our results thereby suggest that CRSwNP patients,
especially females that have a reduction in nasal ACE2 gene expression, may be associated
with a lower risk to be infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Whilst ACE2 gene expression has previously been examined in CRS patients, the current study
confirms previous observations and reports a significantly lower ACE2 gene expression in the
nasal mucosa of patients with CRSwNPs compared to healthy individuals [22–24]. However,
this is the first study to report a lower ACE2 gene expression in CRSwNP patients in a Swedish
cohort. Interestingly, similar ACE2 gene expression profiles have been reported in other airway
conditions, including asthma and chronic rhinitis, which have both been associated with
significant reductions in ACE2 gene expression in airway epithelial cells [25–27]. CRS is often
associated with asthma [17,18,28,29], and diseases of the upper airways with a decrease in

ACE2 expression may thereby play an important role in lowering the risk of infection with
SARS-CoV-2. In keeping with this notion, a recent report has shown that CRS prevalence in
hospitalised COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, was 6.1%, which is somewhat lower than
the prevalence of the disease in the general population of China (8%), and that CRS
comorbidity is not associated with the severity of COVID-19 [30]. Further, Chhiba et al., 2020
have reported that COVID-19 patients with asthma and rhinosinusitis present a lower risk of
hospitalisation than patients without these conditions [31]. However, whilst a direct link
between decreased ACE2 expression and decreased susceptibility to acquisition of SARSCoV-2 has been reported, there is also evidence to suggest that a downregulation of ACE2
could potentially worsen COVID-19 symptoms. Lung involvement is the most severe
complication of COVID-19, often evolving into acute respiratory distress syndrome [3].
Previous reports have suggested that ACE2 plays a protective role in acute respiratory distress
syndrome, where studies have shown that loss of ACE2 expression exacerbates symptoms in
different models of acute lung injury [32,33]. Lastly, although a reduction in ACE2 gene
expression has been reported in CRS, conflicting observations exist regarding ACE2 protein
expression in CRS patients. For example, whilst using immunohistochemistry to evaluate
ACE2 protein expression within the nasal cavity of CRS patients, no differences were observed
in ACE2 protein expression compared to that of healthy controls [34,35]. Contradictory to this,
Wang et al., 2020 reported a reduction in ACE2 protein expression in CRS patients both with
and without nasal polyps [22]. Therefore, more studies are warranted to determine exactly
whether the expression of ACE2 in the upper airway patients could influence the risk of
infection with SARS-CoV-2.
A striking feature of the COVID-19 outbreak is the difference in morbidity and mortality
between the sexes. The infection rate between males and females seem to vary depending on
geographical location, albeit the Global Health 50/50 project has found similar numbers of
COVID-19
cases
in
men
and
women
in
18
different
countries
(https://globalhealth5050.org/the-sex-gender-and-covid-19-project/). Whilst the infection rate
between men and females are similar, a much higher mortality and more severe presentation
of the disease is observed in men. For example, in Chinese confirmed cases the death rate
among men is 4.7% compared with 2.8% for women, where in Italy the death rate among men
is 16.6% compared with 9.1% in women [36,37]. More recently, a meta-analysis study of 39
reports, including 206,128 reported cases, confirmed a sex bias where male patients with
COVID-19 have more than double the rate of requiring intensive treatment and have a
significantly higher mortality rate than females [38]. Lastly, in Sweden, the percentage of
confirmed COVID-19 cases is slightly lower in males (46.32%) compared to that of females
(53.68%) the mortality rate in males is 3.39% compared to 2.44% in females
(https://globalhealth5050.org/the-sex-gender-and-covid-19-project/). In the current study, we
report a significant decrease in the nasal ACE2 gene expression in only female CRSwNP
patients. A lower ACE2 gene expression in females could potentially explain part of the gender
disparity observed in COVID-19, it however remains unclear whether there are any general
gender differences in ACE2 gene expression. Recently, Cai 2020 analysed four large-scale bulk
transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets and
did not find any sex differences in ACE2 mRNA expression between males and females [39].
In contrast to this, Shastri et al., 2020 observed that ACE2 was more highly expressed in
testicular cells compared to ovarian tissue, raising the possibility that testicular ACE2
reservoirs may play a role in viral persistence in males. Lastly, a higher activity, but not

expression, of ACE2 has been reported in male mouse kidneys compared to females [40]. To
our knowledge, our study herein is the first report on a gender difference in the nasal ACE2
gene expression.
The recruitment and activation of eosinophils, mast cells and innate lymphoid cells have been
shown to contribute to the chronic inflammatory state in CRS [41,42]. Significantly higher
levels of the prominent Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 have been reported in nasal polyp
tissue from CRSwNP patients which coincided with reduced ACE2 expression [24].
Interestingly, IL-4 has been shown to modulate ACE2 gene expression in SARS‐CoV-2
infected cells, where treatment of Vero E6 cells with IL-4 decreased the susceptibility of these
cells to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and decreased the expression of ACE2 [43]. In a similar
fashion, IL-13 has additionally been shown to modulate ACE2 gene expression in airway
epithelial cells in asthma [44]. However, it is important to take into account that all CRSwNP
patients that participated in our study were treated with corticosteroids locally in their nasal
cavity, which might have served as a confounding factor in our study. A recent report suggested
that in asthmatic subjects, ACE2 expression is significantly lower in patients who are on
inhaled corticosteroids compared to those who are not [45]. Similarly, corticosteroid
administration was shown to reduce the expression of ACE2 in airway epithelial cell cultures
from COPD patients [46]. Given that there has additionally been evidence to suggest that ACE2
expression may directly be regulated by exposure to corticosteroids [24], it is therefore likely
that the local corticosteroid administration impacts ACE2 gene expression in CRSwNP
patients. The beneficial effect of short-term treatment with corticosteroids in severe covid-19
patients could, at least in part, be explained by the role of corticosteroid in lowering ACE2
expression. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of the observed beneficial effect of
treatment with corticosteroids in CRS and other airway disorders in suppression of ACE2
expression, and reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be established.
In summary, this study reports that the gene expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry factor ACE2
is differentially expressed in the nasal mucosa of patients with CRSwNPs in a Swedish cohort.
We also report a sex-dependant difference in nasal ACE2 expression, where significantly lower
levels of the ACE2 transcript were detected in the nasal mucosa of only female CRSwNP
patients. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the altered
ACE2 expression in CRSwNPs patients nasal mucosa, and its potential impact on the
acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the disease severity of COVID-19.
Methods
Patients and sample collection
A total of 35 individuals were included in this study, divided into two groups: CRSwNP
patients (n=16) and healthy controls (n=18). Control samples were obtained from individuals
aged 40 to 84, with a median age of 60 years and without any history of sinus disease. Patients
with CRSwNP ranged in age from 35 to 73, with a median age of 60 years. The diagnosis of
CRS was based on the definition of the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal
Polyps 2012 guidelines [47]. Cutting through biopsies were taken from concha inferior or
middle from CRSwNP patients and controls under narcosis with Rudolf Weil-Blakesley 3mm
forceps. An additional biopsy was taken from the polyp tissue of CRSwNP patients. All
biopsies were immediately put in RNA later preservative fluid (ThermoFisher, San Diego, CA,
USA). All patients were on oral corticosteroids for the treatment of CRS as recommended by

the current Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps 2012 guidelines. The study was carried out in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Local Ethics Committee
in Gothenburg, Sweden (Date for approval 2012-12-30, Dnr 829-12).
RT-qPCR analysis
RNA Total RNAs from biopsies were isolated using the Kingfisher total RNA extraction kit
(ThermoFisher, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNAs were
synthesized from total RNAs by using a cDNA synthesis kit (Vilo cDNA kit/ ThermoFisher,
San Diego, CA, USA), according to the manufacture’s protocol. RT-qPCR was performed on
the quantstudio12Kflex instrument (ThermoFisher, Life Technologies, CA, San Diego, USA)
using TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (ThermoFisher, San Diego, CA, USA) with
technical duplicates. Primer and probe sets for ACE2 (Hs01085333_m1 and Hs00222343_m1)
were purchased from ThermoFisher, San Diego, CA, USA. Relative gene expression was
calculated using the comparative crossing threshold (CT) method, where the geometrical means
of YWHAZ (Hs01122445_g1), HPRT1 (Hs02800695_m1) and GUSB (Hs00939627_m1)
were used as a reference for housekeeping genes.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis for ACE2 expression was performed using R Version 3.6.2, and data are

presented as medians and interquartile range. A general linear model using age or sex as
covariates was used to compare ACE2 expression of controls vs non-polyp ‘health tissue.
Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was used for the analysis of paired data (i.e. nonpolyp ‘healthy’ tissue vs adjacent polyp tissue). Differences were considered statistically
significant at P‐value < 0.05.
