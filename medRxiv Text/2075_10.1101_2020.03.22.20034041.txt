Abstract
As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), started in China in January, 2020, repurposing approved
drugs is emerging as important therapeutic options. We reported here the first clinical study using
hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor, danoprevir, to treat COVID-19 patients. Danoprevir
(Ganovo®) is a potent HCV protease (NS3/4A) inhibitor (IC50 = 0.29 nM), which was approved
and marketed in China since 2018 to treat chronic hepatitis C patients. Ritonavir is a CYP3A4
inhibitor to enhance plasma concentration of danoprevir while it also acts as a human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor at high doses. The chymotrypsin-like protease of
SARS-CoV-2 shares structure similarity with HCV and HIV proteases. In the current clinical
study (NCT04291729) conducted at the Nineth Hospital of Nanchang, we evaluated therapeutic
effects of danoprevir, boosted by ritonavir, on treatment naïve and experienced COVID-19
patients. The data from this small-sample clinical study showed that danoprevir boosted by
ritonavir is safe and well tolerated in all patients. After 4 to 12-day treatment of danoprevir
boosted by ritonavir, all eleven patients enrolled, two naïve and nine experienced, were discharged
from the hospital as they met all four conditions as follows: (1) normal body temperature for at
least 3 days; (2) significantly improved respiratory symptoms; (3) lung imaging shows obvious
absorption and recovery of acute exudative lesion; and (4) two consecutive RT-PCR negative tests
of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide acid (respiratory track sampling with interval at least one day). Our
findings suggest that repurposing danoprevir for COVID-19 is a promising therapeutic option.

Introduction
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly since
its identification in patients with severe pneumonia in Wuhan, China. The Coronavirus disease-19
(COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, has been reported more than 118,000
cases in 114 countries, and 4,291 people have lost their lives by March 11, 2020 [1]. Given its
global outbreak and strong human-to-human transmission and high mortality in elderly or in
patients with complications, the World Health Organization (WHO) has made the assessment on
March 11, 2020 that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic [2].
Investigation into approved drugs for new therapeutic indications, which is also known as drug
repurposing, has been proved to be a practical strategy in the situation of an outbreak such as
COVID-19 [3-4]. Danoprevir is a potent hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor with an IC 50
of 0.29 nM against HCV protease [5] and was approved and marketed in 2018 in China as an oral
direct-acting antiviral agent to treat hepatitis C. The results of a phase 3 clinical trial with 140
patients showed that the triple regimen of ritonavir-boosted danoprevir plus pegylated-interferon
a-2a and ribavirin produced a sustained virologic response (SVR12) rate of 97.1% after 12-week
treatment in non-cirrhotic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1-infected Chinese patients [6]. In
another phase 2/3 clinical trial, the SVR12 rate is 99% in treatment-naïve, non-cirrhotic HCV
GT1- infected patients after 12-week all oral treatment of ritonavir-boosted danoprevir combined
with ravidasvir (an HCV NS5A inhibitor) and ribavirin [7]. These results indicated danoprevir
boosted by ritonavir is highly efficacious, safe, and well tolerated in HCV patients.
During SARS-COV-2’s life cycle, chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro) can cleave viral
polyprotein to form the RNA replicase-transcriptase complex, which is essential for both viral
transcription and replication [8-9]. The proteases of HCV and human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) showed similar function as SARS-COV-2, so protease inhibitors are hypothesised to have
the therapeutic potential against COVID-19. In vitro and clinical studies in patients with SARS
and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) to some extent proved this hypothesis [10-12]. The
homology modeling data indicated that HCV protease inhibitors have the highest binding affinity
to SARS-CoV-2 protease among approved drugs [13]. Yet there is still a paucity of clinical data on
HCV protease inhibitors in treating COVID-19 patients.
In this study, we for the first time demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of danoprevir boosted
by ritonavir in both treatment naïve and experienced COVID-19 patients.
Methods
Diagnosis
According to the “Diagnosis and Treatment Program for Novel Coronavirus Infection (Trial
Version 6)” issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (China
National Standards) [14], patients with RT-PCR positive of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide acid are
diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 patients, demonstrating pneumonia
manifestation in imaging, respiratory tract symptoms and RT-PCR positive of SARS-CoV-2
nucleotide acid, are categorized as moderate COVID-19 patients per China National Standards
[14].
Study design, patients, treatments and discharge
In this open clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
NCT04291729), patients were treated with danoprevir boosted by ritonavir in the presence or

absence of interferon nebulization (the background therapy). 10 patients were planned to be
enrolled and actually 11 patients were enrolled. All patients were moderate COVID-19 patients
per China National Standards [14]. These patients were recruited and screened, and eligible
patients were enrolled and treated with danoprevir boosted by ritonavir in the presence or absence
of interferon nebulization (as the background therapy) for 4 to12 days until being discharged from
the hospital. Treatment naïve patients never received any antiviral therapies such as
lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon nebulization prior to the treatment of danoprevir boosted by
ritonavir. Treatment experienced patients had received at least one dose of any antiviral therapies
such as lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon nebulization prior to the treatment of danoprevir boosted
by ritonavir. Treatment regimen and dosing frequency are: (1) danoprevir, 100 mg per tablet, 1
tablet at a time, twice per day; (2) ritonavir, 100 mg per tablet, 1 tablet at a time, twice per day; (3)
if administered, aerosol inhalation of α- interferon (interferon nebulization), 5 million units at a
time, twice per day.
The conditions of the patients were monitored daily by attending physicians. Routine
laboratory test of blood indexes, biochemical parameters, and chest computer tomography (CT)
were carried out in need.
According to China National Standards [14] , the following four conditions must be all met
prior to the discharge: (1) normal body temperature for more than 3 days; (2) significantly
recovered respiratory symptoms; (3) lung imaging shows obvious absorption and recovery of
acute exudative lesion; and (4) two consecutive RT-PCR negative tests of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide
acid (respiratory track sampling with interval at least one day). Furthermore, patients were
reviewed by expert committee comprised of elite clinicians before the discharge.
All patients signed informed consent form. The Ethics Committee of the hospital approved the
study.

the researchers judged that the patient was not suitable to participate in this clinical study (for
example, patients with multiple basic diseases, etc.).
RT-PCR protocol
Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) testing of SARS-COV-2 ORF1ab gene was performed in the clinical
laboratory of the Ninth Hospital of Nanchang following the test kit instruction of DAAN Gene
(manufacturer), Guangzhou, China. The lowest detection limit of this kit is 1×103 copies/ml.
Briefly, Nasal and phlegm swab specimens were collected and then put in a sterile tube containing
2 to 3 ml of viral transport medium. Total cellular RNA was isolated by TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen) from 200 µl transport medium. RT-PCR was conducted in LightCycler 480 (Roche)
by mixing 17 µl PCR solution A, 3 µl PCR solution B and 5 µl sample RNA in one tube. A
positive control was used to determine the positivity of the samples.
CT scans
Chest CT scans were conducted using Highspeed dual-slice spiral CT (GE, USA). All CT
images were axial thin-section non-contrast and were undergone 5 mm reconstruction.
Efficacy endpoints
Efficacy endpoints include (1) time to discharge; (2) rate of two consecutive RT-PCR negative
tests of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide acid (respiratory track sampling and sampling interval at least
one day apart); (3) lung imaging showing obvious absorption and recovery of acute exudative
lesion ; (4) significantly improved respiratory symptoms; (5) normal body temperature for at least
3 days.
Results
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics
A total of 11 moderate COVID-19 patients were enrolled, including two naive patients and
nine experienced patients. The baseline demographic characteristics for all enrolled patients are
illustrated in Table 1. The age range of the patients were 18 to 66 years old, with 4 males in total
11 patients. Two experienced patients, patient 5 6 and patient 78, had a history of hypertension.
The symptoms reported at illness onset were mainly fever, cough and shortness of breath. Two
naive patients were hospitalized for 9 and 7 days, respectively, and the experienced patients were
hospitalized for a median duration of 20 days.
The key parameters of 11 patients were presented in Table 2 and illustrated graphically in
Figure 1. In general, nine patients experienced lopinavir/ritonavir along with interferon
nebulization treatment were enrolled and switched to danoprevir/ritonavir treatment, including
four patients with interferon nebulization and five patients without interferon nebulization after
switching. Two naive patients received danoprevir/ritonavir plus interferon nebulization treatment.
After initiation of danoprevir/ritonavir treatment, the first negative RT-PCR test occurred at a
median of 2 days, ranging from 1 to 8 days, and the obvious absorption in CT scans occurred at a
median 3 days, ranging from 2 to 4 days.
Naïve patients receiving danoprevir/ritonavir plus interferon nebulization
Two treatment naïve patients received danoprevir/ritonavir plus interferon nebulization upon
hospitalization. The medical history, treatment and various examinations for one of two patients,
patient 1, were described in details below.
 On February 19, 2020, a woman in her 40’s, who had a close contact with a COVID-19 patient,
was tested positive SARS-COV-2 in nasal swab with RT-PCR and thus admitted to the hospital.

The vital sign of the patient showed body temperature (BT) of 36.4℃ and oxygen saturation
(SPO 2 ) of 99% under ambient air. The breathing sound was normal initially. She had no other
underlying disease before this onset.
 In the morning of February 20, she was given the first dose of danoprevir boosted by ritonavir,
along with interferon nebulization.
 On February 20, both lower lungs showed multiple diffuse patch-shape areas and ground-glass
opacity (GGO), especially obvious in the left lower lung, based on chest CT scans (Figure 2A).
The laboratory results revealed lymphopenia (0.62 ×109 /L) and elevated platelet (322 ×109 /L)
(Table 3).
 On February 22, 3 days after receiving danoprevir boosted by ritonavir treatment, the patient
didn’t show abnormal symptoms or vital signs. The lower lobe of bilateral lung showed
decreased GGO and patch-shaped areas compared to the previous image on February 20,
indicating partial absorption (Figure 2B). The RT-PCR results of nasal swab became negative.
These results indicated the patient had a quick response to the treatment of danoprevir boosted
by ritonavir, along with interferon nebulization.
 On February 24, 5 days after receiving danoprevir boosted by ritonavir treatment, the GGO
and patch-shaped areas in both lungs significantly decreased in density and scale (Figure 2C)
compared to the previous image on February 22. And the RT-PCR results of nasal swab were
repeatedly negative on February24 and February 26.
 On February 28, Patient #1 was given the last dose of danoprevir boosted by ritonavir, along
with interferon nebulization. Since she met all four discharge standards described in Methods
section, the patient was discharged from the hospital on the same day.
Experienced patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon nebulization and
switched to danoprevir/ritonavir with or without interferon nebulization
Nine treatment experienced patients were on lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon nebulization
treatment ranging from 2 to 13 days. Four Patients experienced lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon
nebulization treatment for 2 to 5 days with CT scans worsened and switched to
danoprevir/ritonavir with interferon nebulization. The medical history, treatment and various
examinations for one of patients, patient 6, were described in details below.
 On February 14, 2020, a man in his 40’s was admitted in to the hospital for positive RT-PCR
nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swab. His family member was diagnosed with
COVID-19 on February 11. Based on chest CT scans, subpleural area of the right lower lung
showed GGO (Figure 3A). On admission, the patient reported a 3-day history of chest distress
and fatigue. He showed no signs of fever, shortness of breath, nausea, and diarrhea. He had a
history of hypertension.
 In the evening of February 14, he was given the first dose of Kaletra (lopinavir (200 mg)
/ritonavir (50 mg), per tablet), 2 tablets at a time, twice per day, along with interferon
nebulization.
 On February 15, the patient reported he still had chest distress. Soft thin stool was still reported
and occasional cough and white sputum appeared. The patient continued lopinavir/ritonavir
treatment and received rehydration supportive care.
 On February 17, 3 days after receiving lopinavir/ritonavir treatment, the lower lung showed
further consolidation, along with GGO and patch-shape areas based on CT scans (Figure 3B).
Therefore, in the evening of February 17, lopinavir/ritonavir treatment was stopped and the

patient was switched to danoprevir boosted by ritonavir, along with interferon nebulization. On
February 18, patient had a weak positive RT-PCR test for viral RNA in nasal swab.
 On February 20, 4 days after receiving danoprevir boosted by ritonavir treatment, the right
lower lung showed shrunken patch-shape areas and decreased density of GGO (Figure 3C). On
the same day, RT-PCR test with the nasal swab became negative and remained negative at the
next day RT-PCR test.
 In the morning of February 23, the patient received the last dose of danoprevir boosted by
ritonavir treatment. Since he met all four discharge standards described in Methods section, the
patient was discharged from the hospital on the same day.
Five patients failed lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon nebulization and switched to
danoprevir/ritonavir without interferon nebulization. The medical history, treatment and various
examinations for one of patients, patient 8, were described in details below.
 On February 9, a woman in her 40’s, who was a permanent resident in Wuhan City, was
admitted to the hospital due to maximum BT 38℃ and RT-PCR positive SARS-CoV-2 in nasal
swab. She had occasional coughs with white sputum. The vital sign of the patient showed BT
of 37.4℃ and SPO2 of 99% under ambient air. The patient had half-year history of
hypertension. The patient was given the first dose of lopinavir/ritonavir, 2 tablets at a time,
twice per day, along with interferon nebulization in the evening of February 9.
 On February 10, based on CT scans, subpleural areas of both lower lungs and the tongue-like
segment of the left lung showed GGO and patch-shape areas (Figure 4A). From February 10 to
February 13, the patient showed slightly fluctuating BT (maximum 37.3℃ to minimum
36.4℃), coughs with white sputum, anorexia and diarrhea with yellow thin stool. The

laboratory results revealed leukopenia (3.40 ×109 /L) and lymphopenia (0.7 ×109 /L) (Table 3).
On February 13, 4 days after receiving lopinavir/ritonavir treatment, GGO and patch-shape
areas showed a slightly higher density (Figure 4B) compared to previous CT image on
February 10.
On February 17, 8 days after receiving lopinavir/ritonavir treatment, the patient reported
improved appetite and sleeping while coughing with white sputum remained. CT scan showed
that no significant changes were obat served compared to previous CT image on February 13
and the opacities at tongue-like segment increased (Figure 4C).
On February 19, the patient received the last dose of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon
nebulization. The treatment duration of both lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon nebulization
exceeded the recommendation by China National Standards [14]. As a result, both
lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon nebulization were stopped.
On February 20, she was switched to danoprevir boosted by ritonavir without interferon
nebulization .
On February 22, 3-day after receiving danoprevir/ritonavir treatment, RT-PCR test was
negative in both nasal and phlegm swabs.
On February 23, 4 days after switching to danoprevir boosted by ritonavir, the patient showed

improved white blood cell count (4.31 × 109 /L) (Table 3). CT scans showed GGO and
patch-shape areas decreased in density compared to previous CT images on February 17,
indicating absorption in both lungs (Figure 4D).

completely absorbed. Opacities in both lower lungs decreased in density compared to previous
CT images (Figure 4E).
 RT-PCR tests were repeatedly negative in both nasal and phlegm swabs on February 26 and
February 27.
 On February 29, the patient was discharged from the hospital since she met all four discharge

Discussion
Our study for the first time demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy in moderate COVID-19
patients with the treatment of danoprevir, an HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor marketed in China,
boosted by ritonavir, a pharmacokinetic enhancer of Danoprevir and an HIV protease inhibitor. As
a marketed drug, danoprevir has been demonstrated safe and well tolerated in thousands of HCV
patients in China. Ritonavir is approved HIV drug and pharmacokinetic booster with more than
15-year clinical use.
Although many clinical trials involving many different drugs are ongoing in China and
globally, including protease inhibitors, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) inhibitors, none
of them has been approved for COVID-19 indication by regulatory authorities of major counties.
Around 5% of COVID-19 cases were critical with a mortality of over 50% [15], so it is
essential to treat and prevent the mild or moderate cases progressing into severe or critical ones.
Our report demonstrated that danoprevir boosted by ritonavir can suppress viral replication in less
than one week and effectively reduce GGO and patch-shape areas. Viral nucleic acids in nasal
swabs turned negative at a median of 2 days and the absorption occurred at a median of 3 days
after the initiation of danoprevir/ritonavir treatment.
The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and with
preexisting comorbid conditions was much higher than normal patients (6.0% to 10.5% vs 2.3%)
[15]. Two patients involved in this report had a history of hypertension, but they showed a quick
response with negative PCR tests in 2 days and normalized lung imaging in 3 days after the
initiation of danoprevir/ritonavir treatment, respectively. This finding suggests that
danoprevir/ritonavir treatment could be an effective therapy to reduce the risk of those patients.
Of 11 patients enrolled, eight patients showed significant clinical manifestations such as fever,
cough and dry coughing, while three patients didn't show significant clinical manifestations.
Therefore, the most reliable indicators for treatment efficacy should be improved lung imaging via
CT scans and dramatically reduced virus load through RT-PCR tests.
This study highlights the first-time successful treatment of three COVID-19 patients by HCV
protease inhibitor. Nucleic acid testing results suggested 4 to 12-day treatment of
danopreivir/ritonavir can effectively suppress viral replication and improve patient’s health
conditions, especially for those patients with moderate COVID-19. This report also highlights the
therapeutic effect of danopreivir/ritonavir treatment on both anti-viral naive and experienced
patients. SARS-COV-2 is an RNA virus and thus prone to mutate under the anti-viral drug
pressure. In the real world of clinic practice, patients usually experience various kinds of
treatments, which could lead to drug-resistant mutations. Combination of agents that target
different phases of viral life cycle should minimize the incidents of drug-resistance.
In conclusion, repurposing danoprevir, a marketed HCV protease inhibitor, represents a
promising therapeutic option for COVID19 patients.
