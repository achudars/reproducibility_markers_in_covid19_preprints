ABSTRACT
Background: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the major cause of death in coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19). Multiple autopsy-based reports of COVID-19 lung pathology describe diffuse alveolar damage
(DAD), organizing pneumonia (OP) and fibrotic change, but data on early pathological changes as well as during
progression of the disease are rare.
Research question: Comparison of histopathological and ultrastructural findings in paired transbronchial
biopsies (TBBs) and autopsy material from three patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infection.
Methods: We prospectively enrolled 3 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Full clinical evaluation
was performed including high-resolution computed tomography (HR-CT). We took TBBs at different time points
during the disease and autopsy tissue samples after the patients’ death.
Results: SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-PCR and/or FISH in all TBBs. Lung histology revealed pneumocyte
hyperplasia and capillary congestion in one patient who died short after hospital admission with detectable
virus in 1/2 autopsy samples from the lung. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 2/2 autopsy samples from a patient
with a fulminant course of the disease and very short latency between biopsy and autopsy, both showing
widespread DAD. In a third patient with a prolonged course, i.e. five weeks of ICU treatment with ECMO,
autopsy samples showed extensive interstitial fibrosis without detectable virus by RT-PCR and/or FISH.
Interpretation: We report the course of COVID-19 in paired TBB and autopsy samples from three patients at an
early stage, in rapidly progressive and in a prolonged disease course. Our findings illustrate vascular, organizing
and fibrotic patterns of COVID-19-induced lung injury and suggest an early spread of SARS-CoV-2 from the
upper airways to the lung periphery with diminishing viral load during disease.

Since SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting disease, COVID-19, emerged in late 2019, much effort has been put in a
better understanding of the clinical course of the disease. While most patients present with a rather mild
symptoms, some patients – especially those sharing risk factors such as older age, cardiovascular disease or
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – are at risk of developing life-threatening respiratory failure1.
Early autopsy studies conducted in China described diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with an early edematous
phase followed by hyaline membrane formation, desquamation of pneumocytes and an increased interstitial
mononuclear infiltrate2. In one case, Tian et al. report loose intra-alveolar fibromyxoid proliferation reminiscent
of organizing pneumonia (OP)3. In the meantime, it is widely accepted that COVID-19 follows a biphasic pattern
of an initial viral response phase followed by an inflammatory second phase, and that mortality is linked
primarily to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)1 4. Based on a meta-analysis of 131
reported autopsy cases, Polak et al. postulated that the main histologic patterns of COVID-19-related lung

injury can be categorized into epithelial (reactive changes and DAD), vascular (microvascular damage, thrombi
and OP) and fibrotic5, however these patterns may overlap and be coexistent in the same patient at a given
time point. Nicholson et al. proposed that an initial (pre-)exudative phase of DAD (0-7 days) is followed by an
organizing phase (1 week to months) and might ultimately progress to fibrosis (months)6. The exact
mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-related ARDS development are not fully understood. Is has been postulated that
severity of COVID-19 might correlate with a hyper-inflammatory response and uncontrolled secretion of
cytokines , showing similarities to cytokine releasing syndrome (CRS)7; however, it has been shown that
cytokine levels in severe cases of COVID-19 are lower compared to severe influenza patients8. Our own group
demonstrated overlapping clinical, serological, and imaging features between severe COVID-19 and lung
manifestation of autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or systemic sclerosis9. In our
study, the presence of autoantibodies (antinuclear antibodies and extractable nuclear antibodies, ANA/ENA)
was significantly associated with a need for intensive care treatment and the occurrence of severe
complications. This finding has now been confirmed by others and might be attributed to extrafollicular B cell
activation with excessive production of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) in critically ill COVID-19 patients 10-12. A
better understanding of the pathophysiology of lung injury in COVID-19 would also shed light on the urgent
question of long-term sequelae of the disease in millions of COVID-19 survivors. Despite a large number of
autopsy studies which represent a snapshot of the disease at the time of death, to the best of our knowledge,
there is so far no study comparing antemortem vs. postmortem histopathological and ultrastructural features
of COVID-19. We report here the histopathology of transbronchial biopsies and autopsy material together with
RT-PCR- and FISH-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 and ultrastructural analyses from three patients with
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS
We consecutively included three (n=3) patients with positive SARS-CoV-2-RT-PCR (mucosal swab) admitted to
the Bundeswehrkrankenhaus (German Armed Forces Hospital) Ulm in March and April 2020 after obtaining
informed consent. Patients or their relatives had given written informed consent to routine diagnostic
procedures (serology, bronchoscopy, radiology) as well as (partial) autopsy in the case of death, respectively, as
well as to the scientific use of data and tissue samples in the present study. This project was approved by the
local ethics committee of the University of Ulm (ref. no. 129-20) and conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki.

Clinical characteristics
We collected clinical information from electronic patient files. Data included disease-related events, preexisting
comorbidities, imaging, and clinical follow-up. Baseline clinical characteristics are given in Table 1. The “Berlin
definition’’ was used to categorize ARDS.13 The Horovitz quotient (PaO2/FiO2) was assessed in all ARDS cases
based on arterial blood gas analysis. During ICU treatment, ventilation parameters, duration of invasive
ventilation, catecholamine support, prone positioning, Murray lung injury score and the need for additional
temporary dialysis were continuously assessed14. A profitable trial of prone positioning was defined by an

increasing Horovitz quotient of 30 mmHg or more. One entire trial covered 16 hours of sustained prone
positioning.

Serology/Laboratory values
Laboratory values upon admission to ICU included D-dimers, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), interleukin-6 (IL-6)
and C-reactive protein (CRP) (Table 1). ANA/ANCA/ENA screening was performed as previously described9.

Imaging
Imaging was performed on a Somatom Force Scanner (Dual Source Scanner 2*192 slices, Siemens, Erlangen,
Germany) in accordance with the guidelines of the German Radiological Society and our hospital's COVID-19
guidelines, using low-dose CT (computed tomography) with high-pitch technology.15 The following parameters
were used: Tube voltage: 100kV with tin filtering, tube current: 96 mAs with tube current modulation. In two
cases examination was performed as a non-contrast enhanced full-dose protocol because of suspected ILD, in
one case as a contrast-enhanced CT scan to exclude pulmonary thromboembolism. X-ray examinations were
performed at the respective wards as bed-side X-ray examinations (Mobilett Mira Max, Siemens, Erlangen,
Germany) as a single anterior-posterior view. The CT images were evaluated according to the Expert Consensus
Statement of the RSNA and classified as typical, indeterminate, atypical and negative appearance for COVID19.15 16

Histology and SARS-CoV-2 detection
Lung tissue specimens were obtained as transbronchial biopsies. In three deceased patients, partial autopsies
were performed in which lung (central and peripheral areas), heart and liver tissue were sampled extensively.
Specimens were stained with haematoxylin-eosin (HE), Phosphotungstic-Acid-Hematoxylin (PTAH), Elasticavan-Gieson (EvG) and Masson-Goldner (MG). For SARS-Cov-2 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
Paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded 1µm sections of transbronchial biopsies (TBBs) and lung autopsy
material were deparaffinized followed by dehydration with 100% ethanol. FISH was performed with
the RNAscope® Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2 assay (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Inc.) according to the
maufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, a heat-induced target retrieval step followed by protease was
performed. Afterwards sections were incubated with the following RNAscope® Probe -V-nCoV2019-S (#848561C1), -V-nCoV2019-S-sense (#845701-C1), -Hs-ACE2-C2 (#848151-C2) and -Hs-TMPRSS2-C2 (#470341-C2). After
the amplifier steps the fluorophores OpalTM 570 and 650 (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical
Sciences) were applied to the tissues incubated with C1 and C2 probe, respectively. Finally, nuclei
were stained with DAPI and the slides were mounted with ProLongTM Gold antifade
reagent (Invitrogen). Section were analyzed with Zeiss Axio Imager 2 and image analysis software (ZEN 3.0 blue
edition). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was extracted using Maxwell® 16 FFPE Plus Tissue LEV DNA Purification KIT
(Promega) on Maxwell® 16 IVD Instrument (Promega). Using TaqMan® 2019-nCoV kit (ThermoFisher),
detection of SARS-CoV-2 E-gene was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Electron microscopy
Lung tissue was immersion-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M PBS, pH 7.4. After several washing steps in
0.1M PBS, tissue was osmicated with 1% OsO4 in 0.1 M cacodylate and dehydrated in increasing ethanol
concentrations. Epon infiltration and flat embedding were performed following standard procedures.
Methylene blue was used to stain semithin sections of 0.5 µm. Seventy to ninety-nanometer-thick sections
were cut with an Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Fa. Reichert) and stained with 1% aqueous uranylic acetate and
lead citrate. Samples were studied with a Zeiss EM 109 electron microscope (Fa. Zeiss) coupled to a TRS USB
(2048x2048, v.596.0/466.0) camera system with ImageSP ver.1.2.6.11 (x64) software

The study included two male and one female patient who were hospitalized for RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection at the Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm, Germany. The timeline of disease course is depicted in Fig. 1 A.
Baseline laboratory values and clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Of note, ANA screening was
positive in all three patients; in patient #3, a specific autoantibody (Scl-70) could be detected by immunoblot.
While patients #1 and #3 had to undergo invasive ventilation 2 and 3 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19,
patient #2 was transferred from another hospital in a critical state. In patient #1, TBB was performed before
knowledge of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (day 0). This patient died from pulmonary thromboembolism 5
days later. Except for the continuation of a treatment protocol with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin that
had been established in the previous hospital for patient #2, no specific therapeutic regimens were
administered to patients #1 and #3. TBBs in patient #2 and #3 were performed after 13 and 23 days of ICU
treatment, respectively, to assess the fibrotic change of lung parenchyma and to evaluate a possible use for
antifibrotic treatment options. An Autopsy was performed in all three cases on the day after the patients’
death following the published guidelines17.

Imaging
Representative CT scans from all patients are shown in Fig. 1 B. While there was a discrete NSIP-like pattern
with only minimal ground-glass opacities (GGO) in patient #1, patient #2 showed far more widespread GGOs
combined with consolidations and a positive aerobronchogram, suggestive of OP. In patient #3, imaging
showed severe parenchymal damage with diffuse GGOs, bronchiectasis, cyst formation and air trapping.

Histopathologic findings in vital transbronchial biopsies (TBB) and lung autopsy samples
The main finding in TBBs from patient #1 was reactive changes of pneumocytes (multinucleated cells,
“Napoleon hat sign”) together with a discrete interstitial mononuclear infiltrate. In some alveoli, there was
accumulation of fibrin without hyaline membrane formation (Fig. 1 C). Autopsy samples from the same patient
showed focal capillary congestion together with microthrombosis and very few fibromyxoid plugs in the
alveolar lumen. TBBs from patient #2 - who was already mechanically ventilated at the time of biopsy - showed
alveolar collapse with entrapment of fibrin as well as reactive changes in few pneumocytes. Autopsy samples

from the same patient showed widespread fibromyxoid plugging with entrapment of ball-like fibrin and only
very few residual ventilated alveoli. In some alveoli, there was a shedding of reactive pneumocytes. In patient
#3, TBBs showed extensive OP with only very sparse interstitial inflammation. There was extensive interstitial
fibrosis and pseudo-honeycombing in autopsy samples from patient #3 with the formation of subepithelial
fibroblast foci.

SARS-CoV-2 testing on tissue samples and SARS-CoV-2/ACE2/TMPRSS2-FISH
RT-PCR analyses from tissue samples detected SARS-CoV-2 in TBBs from all three patients and in both autopsy
samples from patient #2(Fig. 1 D). SARS-CoV-2 testing from autopsy samples revealed positivity in one out of
two samples in patient #1, while both autopsy samples were negative in patient #3. In line with that, SARS-CoV2 could be detected by FISH in TBBs, but not in autopsy samples from patients #1 and #3 (Fig. 2 A-B and E-F).
The virus was detected in airway epithelial cells but not in pneumocytes in patient #1. SARS-CoV-2 was
detected in both TBBs and autopsy samples from patient #2 (Fig. 2 C-D). There was only a weak and focal signal
for angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) in all investigated samples (Fig. 2 A’’-F’’), while the signal for
transmembrane protease serine subtype 2 (TMPRSS2) was strongly detectable in all TBBs and autopsy samples
from patient #2, correlating with the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2 A’’’-F’’’)

Ultrastructural findings in lung autopsy samples
Electron microscopy (EM) was performed on autopsy samples from all three patients. There was capillary
congestion with erythrocytes and fragmentocytes in patient #1. Of note, we observed long and thin
cytoplasmic protrusions of erythrocytes consistent with acanthocytosis. There was only minimal collagen
deposition in the interstitium (Fig. 3 A and B). In patient #2, there was widespread desquamation of alveolar
epithelium, interstitial edema and deposition of loosely organized collagen in the interstitium (Fig. 3 C). There
was extensive extracellular matrix deposition containing collagen and elastic fibrils in patient #3 (Fig. 3 D).
Moreover, we found luminal extension of endothelial protrusions consistent with intussusceptive (splitting)
angiogenesis (Fig. 3 E).

DISCUSSION
In the current paper, we report on antemortem and postmortem pathology in three patients with confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection including severe courses of COVID-19. From a clinical viewpoint, all three patients shared
established risk factors for a severe disease course (middle or advanced age, cardiovascular risk factors/disease
and/or history of smoking)18. Laboratory findings at the point of ICU admission showed elevated levels for LDH,
D-dimers, IL-6, and CRP, in line with published data19. Of note, two of the three patients (patients #2 and #3)
were positive for autoantibodies (ANA titers ≥1:320 and/or positive ENA immunoblot). Previously, our group
showed that detection of autoantibodies is associated with a need for intensive care (ICU) treatment and the
occurrence of severe complications in COVID-199. Since all patients were treated in the spring of 2020, no
immunosuppressive agents (dexamethasone) had been administered.
Histopathologic findings in lung biopsies from living COVID-19 patients have rarely been reported. A very early
report described oedema, proteinaceous exudate, focal reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes with patchy

inflammation, and multinucleated giant cells in two patients who underwent lobectomy for lung cancer and
who were retrospectively found to have COVID-19 at the time of operation3. We observed similar changes in
patient #1 who was also not yet known to have COVID-19 at the time of biopsy, indicating that pneumocyte
hyperplasia with proteinaceous exudate represents the earliest response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The virus
was detected by RT-PCR and FISH while the latter method demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 in bronchiolar epithelium
where it was co-expressed with TMPRSS2, but not ACE2. This is in line with data from the literature showing
that TMPRSS2-expressing cells are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and TMPRSS2 expression might
correlate with age, sex and smoking habits20 21. We observed low ACE2 expression in airway epithelial cells in
patient #1, consistent with previous reports 22.
Only 1 of 2 autopsy samples from patient #1 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in RT-PCR, and characteristic
histopathological changes were very focal, supporting the assumption that the patient died early during the
disease before widespread involvement of the lung. Such intrapulmonary heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2
infection has previously been described23. Since the cause of death was pulmonary thromboembolism with
high D-dimer levels (>30 mg/l, ref. ≤0.5 mg/l), it is very interesting that electron microscopy showed capillary
congestion with erythrocytes and fragmentocytes in this patient. Endothelial inflammation and activation of
coagulation are associated with multiorgan failure and increased mortality, and antithrombotic drugs have
been proposed as potential therapies to prevent thrombosis in COVID-1924. Given these findings, we think that
patient #1 might represent the vascular pattern of COVID-19-associated lung injury which has been shown to
occur early in the course of the disease5 and that these patients might profit from anti-coagulative therapy at
an early time point.
While patient #1 represents an early phase of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, both TBBs and
autopsy samples from patient #2 showed widespread DAD with ball-like-fibrin and fibromyxoid plugging. This
acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP)-like pattern has previously been reported in response to
SARS-CoV-2 infection, and is believed to represent an intermediate form of lung injury between exudative DAD
and OP6 25. In line with that, we think that the pattern of lung injury we observed in this patient represents the
climax of lung injury in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the virus could be detected in all samples from
this patient by RT-PCR and FISH, respectively. TMPRSS2, but not ACE2, was highly expressed in both respiratory
epithelium and pneumocytes in TBBs and autopsy samples. It has to be noted that the uniformity of the
histologic findings might reflect the short time span between TBB and autopsy (48h) in this patient.
Ultrastructural analyses revealed the deposition of collagen fibrils in the interstitium, predicting the
development of interstitial fibrosis. While we know now that the application of corticosteroids would be
beneficial for patients with SARS-CoV-2 induced organizing lung damage, it is unclear whether such treatment
would also prevent the development of fibrosis. In patient #3, TBBs on day 23 showed extensive organizing
pneumonia and only sparse inflammation, while autopsy samples after the patient’s death on day 42 showed
extensive interstitial fibrosis and microscopic honeycombing. The virus was still detectable in TBBs, but no virus
could be detected by RT-PCR and FISH in autopsy samples. Ultrastructural analyses confirmed extensive
collagen deposition. These findings support previous reports describing long-term follow-up of severe COVID19 and underline the potential of the development of interstitial fibrosis26. Interestingly, in our previous study,
5/6 specific autoantibodies in patients with severe COVID-19 were associated with some form of sclerosing

CTD, raising the question if a pro-fibrotic (auto)immune response contributes to the development of lung
fibrosis in COVID-19 patients9. EM further confirmed the presence of intravascular endothelial protrusions
consistent with intussusceptive (splitting) angiogenesis as reported before27.
INTERPRETATION
Taken together, we show here antemortem and postmortem biopsies from three patients with severe COVID19, illustrating histopathological changes during the disease (Fig. 4). Early changes include pneumocyte
hyperplasia and capillary congestion, which may be a sign of the risk of thromboembolic complications,
especially when high D-dimers are present. At this point, the virus has not necessarily spread throughout the
lung. The climax of lung injury is widespread DAD with or without organization, possibly including intermediate
AFOP-like patterns; at this point, virus is present in the airways and the lung. When this phase is survived, there
is increasing honeycomb-like fibrosis, however, viral load decreases over time and SARS-CoV-2 may not be
detected in late-stage disease. Development of lung fibrosis as a long-term consequence of COVID-19 is
associated with high morbidity and mortality and should definitely be circumvented whenever possible, raising
the question of a possible use of anti-fibrotic therapies, such as pirfenidone, in survivors of severe COVID-19.
