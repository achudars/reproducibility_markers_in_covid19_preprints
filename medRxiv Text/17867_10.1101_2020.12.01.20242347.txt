Abstract

21

The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 37 million people

22

worldwide. The control responses varied across countries with different outcomes in terms of epidemic

23

size and social disruption. In this study, we presented an age-specific susceptible-exposed-infected-

24

recovery-death model that considers the unique characteristics of COVID-19 to examine the effectiveness

25

of various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in New York City (NYC). Numerical experiments

26

from our model show that the control policies implemented in NYC reduced the number of infections by

27

72% (IQR 53-95), and the number of deceased cases by 76% (IQR 58-96) by the end of 2020,

28

respectively. Among all the NPIs, social distancing for the entire population and the protection for the

29

elderly in the public facilities is the most effective control measure in reducing severe infections and

30

deceased cases. School closure policy may not work as effectively as one might expect in terms of

31

reducing the number of deceased cases. Our simulation results provide novel insights into the city-

32

specific implementation of NPIs with minimal social disruption considering the locations and population

33

characteristics.

Introduction

37

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic with unanticipated

38

consequences to the global community. As of 13 October 2020, severe acute syndrome coronavirus 2

39

(SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19, has infected more than 37 million people and resulted in more

40

than 1 million deaths (1). A variety of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were introduced to reduce

41

the transmission by lowering contact intensity at different locations (2), such as school closure, workplace

42

shutdown, and the closure of bars, churches, and other public facilities, which has been shown to be

43

successful in China (3), South Korea (4), and other countries (5). The NPIs, such as city-wide school

44

closures, were implemented as part of its State of Emergency plan (6) in New York City (NYC) that has

45

been identified as a major epicenter with over 258,000 cases and 23,915 confirmed deaths (7). However,

46

the effectiveness of these NPIs remains unclear, promoting a critical need to evaluate them and to derive

47

more effective NPIs with the consideration of social disruption.

48
49

Increasing evidence shows that the demographic structure and age-specific contacts at different locations

50

play an essential role in the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as the effectiveness of varying NPIs (8-12). For

51

instance, school closure is useful in controlling the infections among the young people (13, 14), who tend

52

to have mild or moderate symptoms and usually can recover without treatment. On the other hand, severe

53

and deceased cases are often among the elderly and those with comorbidities (15). According to the data

54

from the CDC of the US, 79.2% of death in the US are the population whose age is over 64. (16) Existing

55

studies (17, 18) addressed this problem by dividing the population into several age groups and defining

56

the social contacts at different locations. However, utilizing these unique epidemiological characteristics

57

to reduce the total number of infections and the severe and deceased cases and the social disruption is

58

under-researched.

59
60

In this article, we develop a novel age-specific susceptible-exposed-infected-recovery-death (A-SEIRD)

61

model (19, 20) to examine the effect of a set of common NPIs on reducing the total number of infections

62

and the severe and deceased cases. More importantly, we obtain the NPIs that can contain the epidemic

63

with minimal social disruption by quantitatively examining all possible NPIs. The latest epidemiological

64

parameters (21, 22) of COVID-19 were adopted by the A-SEIRD model.

Methods

Adjusted Contact Matrix and Transmission Rate

68

The contact patterns vary across locations. Previous studies (17, 18) divide the contact intensity into four

69

locations within a city: households, workplaces, schools, and public facilities represented as 𝐶 𝐻 , 𝐶 𝑊 , 𝐶 𝑆 ,

70

and 𝐶 𝑃 individually. Note here the original contact matrix 𝐶 is estimated by survey data achieved in 2008

71

(17). To get the updated contact matrix, we adjust the original contact matrix 𝐶 by the latest population

72

structure that refers to the age distribution which is assumed to be static during the simulation period for

73

the same city. We divide the total population of a city into 17 age groups including 16 groups with a 5-

74

year band between birth and 80-year-old, and the 17th group representing aged >80. The adjusted contact

75

intensity (𝑀𝑖𝑗 ) of age group 𝑗 made by age group 𝑖 is obtained by taking the product of 𝐶𝑖𝑗 and the ratio of

76

the current population sizes of age group 𝑖 (𝑝𝑖 ) and age group 𝑗 (𝑝𝑗 ) as follows:
𝑀𝑖𝑗 = 𝐶𝑖𝑗 ×

77

𝑝𝑖
,
𝑝𝑗

78

The overall social mixing pattern is defined as the weighted sum of the adjusted contact matrix across the

79

four locations,

80

𝑀 = 𝑤 𝐻 𝑀𝐻 + 𝑤 𝑊 𝑀𝑊 + 𝑤 𝑆 𝑀 𝑆 + 𝑤 𝑃 𝑀𝑃 ,

81

where 𝑤 𝐻 , 𝑤 𝑊 , 𝑤 𝑆 , 𝑤 𝑃 are the location-specific decay factors compared to the normal situation (𝑤 𝐻 =

82

𝑤 𝑊 = 𝑤 𝑆 = 𝑤 𝑃 = 1) and the effects of different NPIs are reflected by the reduction of these decay

83

factors. The contact matrixes of the four locations under the normal situation are shown in Figure 1.

The transmission rate 𝛽 varies with NPIs shown on the overall adjusted social mixing pattern 𝑀.

The A-SEIRD Model

99

The proposed A-SEIRD model is based on the classic SEIR model (19, 20). In the classic SEIR model,

100

the population is divided into four groups according to the infection status: susceptible (𝑆), exposed (𝐸),

101

infected (𝐼), and recovery (𝐸). Based on the evidence of the asymptomatic infections of COVID-19 (23,

102

24), we add three new statuses for the infected individuals: asymptomatically infected (𝐼 𝑎𝑠 ), mildly

103

infected (𝐼 𝑚 ) and severely infected (𝐼 𝑠 ). Susceptible individuals may become exposed after contacting

104

infected ones. Exposed individuals may become either mildly infected or asymptomatically infected. We

105

assume that the deceased cases come from both mild and severe infections, and all asymptomatically

106

infected individuals will recover. The model structure is presented in Figure 2.

Figure. 2: The proposed age-specific SEIRD model.

110
111

Considering the huge drop in human movement between cities (25), we assume that NYC is a closed

112

system throughout the course of the epidemic (from 1 Jan 2020 to 31 Dec 2020) and initially there are

113

1,000 infected individuals for simplicity. The initially infected individuals are distributed in different age

114

groups with the same proportion (0.016%). The epidemic parameters are age-dependent, such as the elder

115

individuals have a higher severe rate and death rate than the youth (22).

116

For a given age group 𝑖, the epidemic transitions can be described by

where 𝑆𝑖 , 𝐸𝑖 , 𝐼𝑖𝑎𝑠 , 𝐼𝑖𝑚 , 𝐼𝑖𝑠 , 𝑅𝑖 , and 𝐷𝑖 denote the number of susceptible, latent, asymptomatic infectious,

mild infectious, severe infectious, recovery, and deceased individuals at age group 𝑖, respectively. 𝑁𝑗 is

126

the number of individuals in age group 𝑗. 𝛽 is the transmission rate that differs by the contact intensity

127

and population structure and 𝛼 is the proportion of the transmission rate of the asymptomatic infections

128

over that of the mild infections (26). Note that here we assume the severe infections will not spread the

129

virus due to their limited mobility (usually isolated in hospital). 𝑀𝑖𝑗 denotes the total contact intensity of

130

age group 𝑗 made by age group 𝑖. For individuals in the age group i, 𝜌𝑖 = 𝐼𝑖𝑎𝑠 /(𝐼𝑖𝑎𝑠 + 𝐼𝑖𝑚 ) is the estimated

131

fraction of asymptomatic cases among both asymptomatic and mild infections; 𝜎𝑖 = 1/𝑑𝐿 is the daily

132

probability that an exposed individual becomes infectious (either asymptomatic or mild) where 𝑑𝐿 is the

133

average latent period; 𝛾𝑖𝑎𝑠 , 𝛾𝑖𝑚 , and 𝛾𝑖𝑠 are the daily recovery probability for the asymptomatic, mild, and

134

severe infections, respectively. They are related to specific disease period: 𝛾𝑖𝑎𝑠 = 1/𝑑𝐼 , 𝛾𝑖𝑚 = 1/𝑑𝑚 ,

135

𝛾𝑖𝑠 = 1/𝑑𝑠 , where 𝑑𝐼 , 𝑑𝑚 , 𝑑𝑠 are the infectious period, mild duration, and severe duration generated from

136

literature, respectively. 𝜇𝑖 is the daily probability of hospitalisation that a mildly infected patient becomes

137

severely infected. 𝜅𝑖𝑚 = 𝜅𝑖𝑠 = 𝜓𝑖 /𝑑𝑑 is the daily crude mortality rate, where 𝜓𝑖 is the crude mortality rate

138

and 𝑑𝑑 is the period from the symptom onset to death. The crude mortality rate 𝜓𝑖 is estimated from the

139

official confirmed case report (27) which equals the proportion of the number of deceased individuals to

140

the infected individuals within one age group. The parameters used in the model from literature are

Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention Scenarios

149

Some study (34) points out that the seeding of the virus likely occurred in the US between 25 December

150

2019 and 15 January 2020, thus we set the starting date of the simulation to be 1 January 2020 for a better

151

fitting, and simulate the epidemic based on the real-time responses by the government. Before the state

152

governor declared a state of emergency in New York State on 7 March, we assume the residents have

153

already had a certain degree of awareness of the COVID-19, and thus the contact intensities at schools,

154

workplaces, and public facilities were reduced by 20%. Between the emergency declaration and the state-

155

wide stay-at-home order (7 March to 22 March), the awareness of precaution has been elevated to reduce

156

the contact intensity at workplaces, schools, and public facilities by 50%. After the state-at-home order

157

was put in place, the city was at a full lockdown status (6), so we set the decay factor of the contact

158

intensity at schools to 0 and further reduce the contact intensities at workplaces and the public facilities to

159

30% of the normal situation. To model the four reopening phases (35) implemented on 8 June, 22 June, 6

160

July, and 20 July, respectively, we assume the contact intensities at both the workplaces and public

161

facilities increase by 5% at each phase. In addition, we simulate the scenario in which NYC has a larger-

162

scale reopen back to the situation before the state-at-home order (50% for all locations except household)

163

on 1 September. The decay factor of contacts in households is set to 1 over the course of the epidemic.

164
165

We investigate five common NPIs: theoretical no intervention, school closure, social distancing for the

166

entire population, social distancing for the elderly (age > 64 years) (36), and adaptive policy proposed by

167

Ferguson et al. (37). In the adaptive policy, a stringent control measure (full lockdown) is triggered when

168

certain conditions are met. Here we assume that the condition is the number of daily new severely

169

infected cases is over 𝑁. We examined two values of 𝑁 (100 and 150) for the robustness of results. The

170

details of the decay factor setting for each NPIs are shown in Table 3. We assume the NPIs were

171

implemented through the whole course of the epidemic simulation.

Identifying Effective NPIs Considering Social Disruption

176

The objective of NPIs should not be limited to reducing infections without the consideration of social

177

disruption. First, we measure the social disruption caused by the NPIs at the four locations. Here, the

178

social disruption at a location is measured as (1 − 𝑤)𝑀 × 𝑠, which is the product of the reduced amount

179

of contacts (1 − 𝑤)𝑀 and the relative importance of these contacts 𝑠 . Thus, the total social disruption 𝐿

180

caused by the NPIs can be represented as follows,

181

𝐿 = 𝑠 𝑆 (1 − 𝑤 𝑆 )𝑀 𝑆 + 𝑠 𝐻 (1 − 𝑤 𝐻 )𝑀𝐻 + 𝑠 𝑊 (1 − 𝑤 𝑊 )𝑀𝑊 + 𝑠 𝑃 (1 − 𝑤 𝑃 )𝑀𝑃 .

(12)

182
183

Second, we aim to identify the NPIs that reduce the social disruption 𝐿 as much as possible under the

184

condition that the COVID-19 epidemic does not exceed that of the actual NPIs implemented in NYC.

185

Specifically, we consider three measures of the COVID-19 epidemic: the number of all infections, the

186

number of severe infections, and the number of deceased cases as of 31 December 2020, respectively.

187

It is challenging to quantify the relative importance of the activities at different locations in a very

188

detailed manner. In this study, we make the following intuitive assumptions about relative importance:

189

workplaces have the highest importance, 𝑠 𝑊 = 1; public facilities has the second highest importance,

190

𝑠 𝑃 = 0.5; households and schools have the lowest importance, 𝑠 𝐻 = 𝑠 𝑆 = 0.2. Here, we set low

191

importance for school thanks to the availability of online schooling. We also consider the simplified

192

scenario in which the relative importance of all locations is identical. Therefore, in total, we consider

193

three distinct measures of the COVID-19 epidemic and two assumptions about the relative importance of

194

locations, so in total, we consider six scenarios, as illustrated by Table 4.

195
196

For intuitive interpretation and simple implementation, we discretize the continuous value of the decay

197

factors into 11 discrete values with equal intervals, 0, 0.1, 0.2, …, 0.9, 1.0. We set the minimal decay

198

factor of the contacts at the public facilities to 0.1 as it is unrealistic to shut down all public facilities. In

199

addition, we assume that 𝑤 𝐻 = 1, because there is little we can do for the contacts within households. In

200

this way, the total number of solutions is restricted to 11 × 11 × 10 × 1 = 1210 for each of the six

201

scenarios, and an exhaustive search can be used to identify the best NPIs for a certain scenario.

Fit the Model from Data

206

Figure 3 presents the comparison of the simulation results of the proposed A-SEIRD model and the

207

number of confirmed cases in NYC (27). Note that the simulation of the A-SEIRD model obtains the

208

onset of COVID-19. The actual confirmation of COVID-19 infection usually has a six-days-delay (38).

209

Thus, we incorporated the six-days-delay in presenting the simulation results in Figure 3. In general, the

210

simulation results (blue curve) capture the trend of the confirmed case data (black bars). The simulated

211

curve is higher than the confirmed curve, which is common given the wide existence of undiagnosed

212

cases (39). The implementations of the control measures are represented by the red lines, and the four-

213

phases reopening policies are represented by the brown bars. The effects of control measures became

214

obvious with a lag of several weeks, due to the incubation period of the disease. Additionally, the

215

reopening slowed down the decreasing trend.

Quantify the Effectiveness of NPIs

225

We present the simulated epidemic sizes with the five common NPIs in Figure 4. Without any control, we

226

would expect a peak of asymptomatic and mild infections in early April. The peak of severe infections

227

occurs two-week later due to disease progression. In such a case, 70% (IQR 60-77) of NYC residents

228

would be infected by the end of 2020. The peak of deceased cases is around early May. Comparing the

229

case with actual NPIs and theoretical no intervention scenario, we observe a 72% (IQR 53-95) decline in

the total number of infections and a 76% (IQR 58-96) decline in the number of deceased cases. The

231

effects of each NPIs vary across age categories. More specifically, school closure is effective: the total

232

infections and deceased cases are nearly the same as the results of those without any control (theoretical

233

no intervention). School closure slightly reduces (4% (IQR 3-7)) the number of infections among young

234

people (< 25 years), who are not the most vulnerable. On the other hand, the social distancing for the

235

entire population effectively reduces 47% (IQR 33-84) of infections and 51% (IQR 39-86) deceased

236

cases. In addition, social distancing for the elderly could reduce 47% (IQR 46-56) of total infections and

237

47% (IQR 46-48) deceased cases in the elderly groups (> 64 years), but not so much for other age groups.

We also examined the effectiveness of the adaptive policy, which naturally forms an oscillation curve as

248

shown in Figure 5. The grey blocks represent the periods with stringent strategies (“full lockdown”). We

249

adopt two variants of the adaptive policy from Ferguson et al. (37), “100-severe” (with 100 new severe

250

infections per day as the threshold to trigger the control), and “150-severe” (with 150 as the threshold).

251

Results show that both adaptive policies can reduce the total number of infections and the number of

252

severe infections well. However, the triggered time period of the control is too long, and the interval is

253

only around six days. In practice, such frequent switches between different policies are not realistic.

Identify the Best NPIs

We derive the best NPIs by exhaustively examining all the possible 1210 solutions for each of the six

scenarios introduced in Methods. All scenarios lead to similar NPIs: to reduce the contact intensity at

265

public facilities (social distancing for the entire population) while largely maintaining the function of

266

schools and workplaces. This indicates that, although school closure is associated with lower social

higher risk by mixing various age groups in the city.

Discussion

278

Since most COVID-19 infections appear to have mild or moderate symptoms that can heal themselves

279

and there are many asymptomatic cases (15), it is critical to reduce the number of severely infected and

280

deceased cases rather than only flattening the total epidemic curve. In this study, we expanded the age-

281

specific SEIR model to develop a new A-SEIRD model that considers the asymptomatic infections of

282

COVID-19 and evaluated the effectiveness of various NPIs in NYC. We found that not all the NPIs were

283

effective, and the social distancing at the public facilities are essential for reducing the number of severe

284

infections and deaths.

285
286

Counterintuitively, we find that nearly all the countries decided to close the schools, while our model

287

shows that it is not that effective in controlling the epidemic. As shown in Figure 4, school closure would

288

only slightly reduce the number of total infections compared to the extreme theoretical no intervention

289

policy. As shown in Figure 1. It is obvious that the contacts in schools concentrated on the young

290

population (age <25 years) who make up only a small fraction of the vulnerable population. Meanwhile,

291

the contacts among the young population are also very active in households and public facilities. Thus,

292

school closure alone may not work as effectively as one would have expected. A recent systematic review

293

(40) also concluded that there are no data on the relative contribution of school closures to transmission

294

control and some modelling studies proved that school closure would prevent only 2-4% deceased cases

295

(37). At the same time, school closure would bring more pressure on the medical system since many

296

healthcare workers would be distracted to take care of their children. Jude et al.’s modelling analysis

297

found that 28·8% (95% CI 28·5–29·1) of the health-care workforce need to provide care for children aged

298

3–12 years (14). A trade-off needs to be taken into consideration while making the school closure

299

decision.

300
301

Compared with the social distancing only for the elderly, social distancing for the entire population comes

302

with greater social disruption. Thunström et al. (41) found that the cost of social distancing measures is

303

$7.21 trillion in the USA utilized epidemiological and economic forecasting. Although the social

304

distancing for the elderly would not significantly reduce the total number of infections, it can effectively

305

reduce the number of deceased cases. These results reflect the clinical characteristics of COVID-19: high

306

transmissibility but a high mortality rate only among the elderly (42, 43). That is why the social

307

distancing for the elderly policy has already been adopted in many countries (44).

308
309

NPIs lead to social disruptions. We used the proposed A-SEIRD model to identify the NPIs that flatten

310

the curve with minimal social disruptions. We found that the social distancing at public facilities could

311

effectively reduce the number of infections and the number of deaths. As shown in Figure 1, the contacts

312

of the elderly are concentrated in public facilities and households. Although it is difficult to shut down all

313

the public facilities, we suggest that the social distancing for the elderly only at the public facilities would

314

be an effective and practical way to reduce the number of deceased cases without large-scale social

315

disruption. In practice, the protection of the elderly in public areas has already been adopted, such as

316

cresting flow to make room for the elderly in the supermarket.

317
318

Apparently, it is not practical to implement the NPIs for a long period, because the social disruption could

319

lead to enormous economic loss, which may, in turn, cause other public health problems. Here, we

320

simulated the ongoing process when relaxing at the beginning of July, August, September, and October as

321

shown in Figure 6. Our model suggests that relaxation after the peak of the outbreak would cause an

322

instant rebound. At the same time, it can be observed that the later relaxing implemented, the smaller the

323

rebound size is. Thus, the resumption of work and production shall be carefully taken place. The adaptive

324

policy, which seems to work in controlling the epidemic size, but leads to unrealistically frequent

325

switches between lockdown and relaxation, making it difficult to be realized (Figure 5).

333

In conclusion, our study proposed a comprehensive mathematical model that takes into account both the

334

age-specific contacts between people, the latest epidemiological parameters of the COVID-19, and the

335

social disruption. The simulation results provide novel insights into the implementation of NPIs with

336

minimal social disruption. We call for more research on the trade-off between epidemic control and

337

economic loss.
