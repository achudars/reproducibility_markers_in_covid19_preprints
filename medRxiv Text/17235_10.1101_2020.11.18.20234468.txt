Abstract
Importance: Healthcare workers (HCW) are slated to be early recipients of SARS-CoV-2
vaccines due to increased risk of exposure to patients with COVID-19, and will be tasked with
administering approved vaccines to the general population. As lynchpins of the vaccination
effort, HCWs’ opinions of a vaccine’s safety and efficacy may affect both public perception and
uptake of the vaccine. Therefore, it is crucial to understand and address potential hesitancy prior
to vaccine administration.
Objective: To understand healthcare workers’ attitudes about vaccine safety, efficacy, and
acceptability in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, including acceptance of a novel
coronavirus vaccine.
Design, Setting, Participants: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to participants enrolled in
a longitudinal cohort study surveilling SARS-CoV-2 infection among 1,093 volunteer sampled
University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Health System employees. Surveys were
completed online between September 24 and October 16, 2020. In total, 609 participants
completed this supplemental survey.
Results: We averaged a 9-statement Likert scale matrix scored from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 5
(“strongly agree”) and found respondents overwhelmingly confident about vaccine safety (4.47);
effectiveness (4.44); importance, self-protection, and community health (4.67). Notably, 47.3%
of respondents reported unwillingness to participate in a coronavirus vaccine trial, and most
(66.5%) intend to delay vaccination. The odds of reporting intent to delay coronavirus vaccine
uptake were 4.15 times higher among nurses, 2.45 times higher among other personnel with
patient contact roles, and 2.15 times higher among those without patient contact compared to
doctors. Evolving SARS-CoV-2 science (76.0%), current political climate (57.6%), and fast-

tracked vaccine development timeline (83.4%) were cited as primary variables impacting HCW
decisions to undergo vaccination. Of note, these results were obtained prior to release of Phase
III data from companies manufacturing vaccines in the U.S.
Conclusions and Relevance: Despite overall confidence in vaccines, a majority of HCW
expressed concerns over a novel coronavirus vaccine. A large proportion plan to delay vaccine
uptake due to concerns about expedited development, emerging scientific discoveries, and the
political climate. Forthcoming vaccination campaigns must address these unique points of
coronavirus vaccine hesitancy in order to achieve adequate vaccine coverage.

Background
Vaccines prevent disease, disability, and death for millions annually, yet public support for their
use has been waning worldwide. The rise of vaccine hesitancy, including the delay or refusal of
immunization, poses real and existential threats to progress against vaccine-preventable disease
outbreaks, and is increasingly being recognized as a barrier to immunization program success.1,2
Indeed, in 2019 the World Health Organization listed vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten
threats to global health.3

Long-term coronavirus disease (COVID-19) control will likely hinge on successful vaccine
development and delivery to a large portion of the population in order to achieve adequate
vaccine coverage to prevent ongoing community spread. The highly politicized U.S.
governmental pandemic response has ignited concerns that public acceptance of a novel
coronavirus vaccine may be insufficient to establish herd immunity as a result of mistrust of
authorities, misinformation on the internet, and other sources of vaccine hesitancy. Indeed,
several recent surveys in the U.S. and abroad have shown mass uncertainty regarding vaccines
and the influence of modern political movements,4 with implications for coronavirus vaccine
acceptance.5,6 Skepticism over the fast-tracked vaccine development and approval process
known as Operation Warp Speed, also has the public worried that politics rather than science
might be driving a vaccine to market.7-9

Studies in high-, middle-, and low-income settings have consistently shown that healthcare
workers (HCW) offer guidance on vaccine recommendations and help combat misinformation,
confusion, and ignorance about the risks and benefits of vaccination to the public.10 Nonetheless,

blanket HCW support for vaccines should not be taken for granted. A recent study found that
43% of health practitioners in France did not recommend vaccines to key demographic groups,
and carried strong perceptions of vaccine risk based on decades-old societal controversies.11
Similar beliefs color health practitioner vaccine behaviors around the world, and underscore the
fact that vaccine hesitancy is often influenced by broader political, religious, social, and
historical factors.12

To understand the extent of generalized vaccine acceptance and specific attitudes towards
forthcoming coronavirus vaccines among HCW in Los Angeles, we conducted a cross-sectional
survey delivered to health system employees enrolled in a longitudinal SARS-CoV-2
surveillance program.

Methods
Study design and population
To understand the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers13 we enrolled a
cohort of asymptomatic healthcare workers employed by University of California, Los Angeles
(UCLA) Health at two medical centers into a longitudinal study from April 8 to October 14,
2020. Participants were asked to complete biweekly mid-turbinate swab sampling for SARSCoV-2 testing via nucleic acid amplification, and to provide blood samples once per month to
assess the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Subjects also completed an online baseline
questionnaire on basic demographics, as well as a biweekly survey on recent occupational
exposures, including contact with patients or biologic samples that had tested positive for SARSCoV-2.

Survey design
As an addendum to this study, a brief cross-sectional survey designed to assess attitudes towards
vaccines and prospective acceptance of a novel coronavirus vaccine was distributed to
participants on September 24, 2020 and completed online through October 16, 2020. Survey
questions were modeled on validated vaccine questionnaires published as part of the World
Health Organization (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization’s
vaccine hesitancy Likert scale questions14,15, and a survey on public perceptions of COVID-19
from the Vaccine Confidence Project.16

Nine Likert scale questions from SAGE were modified to examine attitudes about vaccines at
large, rather than childhood vaccination (Table 1). Answers to each statement were assigned a
point value from 1-5 (from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”). Additional questions were
incorporated to address prospective acceptance of a novel coronavirus vaccine; factors
influencing participants’ opinions of such a vaccine, including political, social, and religious
variables; and which groups, if any, they believe should have priority access. Subjects were also
asked to reflect on how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted their willingness to vaccinate.

Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic factors of both the greater study cohort
and those who opted to complete the vaccine hesitancy survey (Table 2). Answers to the vaccine
hesitancy Likert scale questions were tabulated, and then averaged for the whole group and for
specific demographic categories. T-tests or ANOVAs were also run to detect meaningful

differences in answers across these groups, with linear regression conducted to examine trends
across ordinal education levels.

Attitudes surrounding a novel, as-of-yet unspecified, coronavirus vaccine were graphed.
Proportions of subjects intending to accept, delay, or refuse a future vaccine were calculated, as
were the motivating factors behind these decisions. All vaccine attitudes were stratified by sex,
race, ethnicity, and level of educational attainment. Finally, a logistic regression model was run
to examine the relationship between prospective COVID-19 vaccine receipt and various
demographic factors of interest. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (Cary, NC)
and R (R Core Team, 2014) statistical software; figures were produced using the R package
ggplot2 (Wickham, 2009).

Ethical considerations
Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the UCLA Institutional Review Board (IRB
#20-000478).

Results
Study population
Among 1,069 participants in our healthcare worker cohort, 609 (55.7%) opted to complete a
vaccine hesitancy questionnaire. Similar to the larger cohort, these participants were majority
female (68.8%), white (56.7%), between the ages of 30-49 (60.1%) and in possession of an
advanced degree (59.6%, Table 2). Vaccine module respondents also mirrored the larger HCW
cohort in terms of job role, with 39.9% physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, or

certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs); 33.8% nurses; 16.6% in other patient contact
roles in the health system; and 9.8% personnel without patient contact.

General vaccine attitudes
When asked about attitudes towards nine statements designed to measure acceptance of vaccines
at large, respondents were overwhelmingly positive. Ninety-three percent (range: 84.0% 96.9%) surveyed agreed or strongly agreed with Statements 1-7 (listed in Table 1), indicating
high vaccine confidence (average response of 4.51/5 on the Likert scale). 85.7% (n=522) of
participants responded ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ to all seven statements; 33.5% (n=204)
responded ‘strongly agree’ to all seven statements.

Responses to statements designed to assess vaccine hesitancy (Statements 8-9, also listed in
Table 1) were less positive than those that measured acceptance of vaccines at large (Statements
1-7). The average response to the statement ‘new vaccines carry more risk than older vaccines’
was 3.23/5 and the average response to ‘I am concerned about serious adverse effects of
vaccines’ was 2.9/5. Over one third of participants (35.0%) expressed concern about serious
adverse effects from vaccine use; almost a quarter (23.3%) were neutral on the issue.

The average Likert response was higher among men compared with women for statements
regarding the safety and effectiveness of vaccines (Statements 2-4) and the importance of
vaccines for community health (Statement 5). A greater proportion of men strongly agreed with
Statements 1-7 compared with women, and participants identifying as Latino were less likely to
respond ‘strongly agree’ compared with non-Latinos. When asked whether they trusted

vaccination information provided by healthcare and public health professionals, 17.4% of Latino
respondents were neutral, 50.7% agreed that this information was trustworthy, and 29% strongly
agreed, compared with 11.9%, 39.2% and 45.8% of non-Latinos, respectively.

Nearly all of our participants (95.4%) reported either some college, associate's, or a vocational
degree; completion of a bachelor's degree; or attainment of an advanced degree. We observed a
linear, dose-response trend in vaccine acceptance and hesitancy across these three levels of
education. We observed a positive linear trend signaling increasing vaccine confidence
(Statements 1-7) with increased educational attainment, and a negative linear trend signaling
reduced vaccine hesitancy (Statements 8-9) with increased education level.

Attitudes towards novel coronavirus vaccine
Participants were asked about a prospective novel coronavirus vaccine during a period when
many vaccine candidates were under development globally, and several had advanced to Phase
III testing in the United States. Almost half of participants (46.0%) agreed that a coronavirus
vaccine would protect them from COVID-19 disease, 48.4% responded neutrally, and 5.60%
disagreed. Among Latinos, 27.5% agreed that a novel coronavirus vaccine would protect them
from COVID-19, 65.2% responded neutrally, and 7.25% disagreed. Confidence in the scientific
vetting process of a novel coronavirus vaccine dropped markedly and did not differ according to
ethnicity, with 37.6% of participants expressing neutrality on the matter, and 27.8% stating they
were not confident in these procedures. Finally, almost half of respondents (47.3%) stated they
were unwilling to participate in a novel coronavirus vaccine trial (Figure 1).

Of importance, most participants (66.5%) indicated that they would delay vaccination if a new
coronavirus vaccine became widely available: 49.9% would prefer to wait and see how the
vaccine affects others first and 16.6% would not get it soon, but indicated they might in the
future; 1.31% (n=8) never intend to get vaccinated. The remaining participants (32.3%) reported
that they intended to get a coronavirus vaccine as soon as possible. We fit a logistic regression
model to measure the association between coronavirus vaccine intent and demographic factors of
interest (Table 3). Compared with physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and
CRNAs, other HCW had significantly lower odds of coronavirus vaccine acceptance. The odds
of delay or refusal of a coronavirus vaccine was 4.17 times higher (95% CI: 2.53-6.87) among
nurses, 2.71 times higher (95% CI: 1.51-4.84) among other personnel with patient contact roles,
and 1.71 times higher (0.87-3.34) among those with other roles in the health system that did not
include patient contact.

Those planning to delay or refuse vaccination cited concerns regarding the fast-tracked nature of
vaccine development and a lack of transparency and/or publicly available information on a
vaccine as their primary rationale. Those factors were noted again amongst the survey
respondents at large, regardless of vaccination timing preferences. Opinions guiding intentions
for a potential coronavirus vaccine were most heavily influenced by the fast-tracked
development timeline, the novel and unfolding science of SARS-CoV-2, and the political climate
in which the research and regulatory process were playing out at the time of survey distribution
(Figure 2). These three concerns persisted across different demographic groups including, sex,
ethnicity, and education level.

When asked if the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted their willingness to be immunized in
general, 70.1% of subjects reported no change, 20.9% felt somewhat more likely or much more
likely to receive a vaccine, and 9.04% felt somewhat or much less likely to receive a vaccine.
After being shown a comparison of the reproductive numbers for SARS-CoV-2 (R0~ 3) and
measles (R0~ 14), participants were asked about their willingness to accept measles-containing
vaccines. Over three-quarters (77.2%) said the relative infectiousness of measles disease led to
no change in their feelings around vaccination, 20.0% felt somewhat more likely or a lot more
likely to accept measles-containing vaccines, and 2.8% felt somewhat or a lot less likely to
vaccinate against measles.

Discussion
As arbiters of scientific and public health information, healthcare workers serve as ambassadors
for evidence-based medical interventions, and are critical in promoting vaccine acceptance.17
That has never been more important than in the wake of COVID-19. Not only do HCW serve on
the frontlines of pandemic response efforts, at high risk for occupational SARS-CoV-2 exposure
and transmission, but they are almost universally identified as priority recipients of a
forthcoming coronavirus vaccine.18 HCW also serve as trusted and influential community
members on topics of public health concern, and will ultimately be prescribing and administering
approved coronavirus vaccines to their patients. While our study population generally regarded
vaccines very positively and indicated high willingness to follow public health guidelines around
vaccination, they expressed some skepticism and specific concern over a COVID-19 vaccine.

Although participants overwhelmingly acknowledged the safety, efficacy, and importance of
vaccination to public health practice, 35% expressed apprehension over serious adverse effects
from vaccines, and 23% said they were “neutral” with respect to serious adverse effects. While
it’s impossible to precisely define “neutral” responses in this context, this could indicate a lack of
assuredness over the perceived safety of all vaccines, or may suggest that respondents make
vaccination decisions on a vaccine-by-vaccine basis.

Notably, we observed several instances where women and racial or ethnic minorities expressed
more hesitant attitudes towards vaccines than their counterparts. Persistent issues of trust in the
modern medical system among these groups speaks to a larger trend in perceptions of healthcare
among minority groups in the U.S., which may drive individuals to seek alternative or
complimentary medicine, or to neglect health concerns altogether.19-21 This trust gap, which
stems in part from long-term issues of systemic biases in health research and healthcare
delivery22,23, will have important implications for the adoption and roll-out of a novel
coronavirus vaccine.

At the time of survey distribution in late September of 2020, hesitancy over an upcoming
coronavirus vaccine in our cohort appeared to be grounded in a lack of confidence about the
timeline and motives pushing such vaccines to market. Several polls and surveys of the adult
U.S. population from this same time period show concern surrounding ongoing Phase III trials of
several vaccine candidates, owing to perceived lack of data clarity, financial and political
conflicts of interest, and other current events playing out in the news cycle.7-9 A perceived lack
of transparency in government-supported vaccine development programs and regulatory

decision-making has further perpetuated and broadened public mistrust, including messaging
around the public-private partnership known as Operation Warp Speed, which to some connotes
“cutting corners” to rapidly advance vaccines to market.24 As a reflection of these collective
public sentiments, an alliance of governors from Western states and New York state are vowing
to conduct secondary scientific reviews of any federally approved vaccines before distributing
them to their residents.25

In the context of healthcare uptake and delivery, apparent meddling of the government in the
scientific process of vaccine development may hamper enthusiasm around novel interventions
without a long history of post-market surveillance supporting their use. This may help explain
why two-thirds of respondents wanted to delay use of a novel coronavirus vaccine, some with no
intention of getting the vaccine in the immediate future. Alternatively, the perceived risk of
COVID-19 may be lower for young, generally healthy individuals in the workforce than the
perceived risk of adverse effects from a coronavirus vaccine. For individuals under age 50
without comorbidity, the risk of death from COVID-19 remains low, and up to 40% have
completely asymptomatic disease.26 HCWs may thus be more hesitant to receive a novel vaccine
when they do not perceive the disease it protects against as a significant personal threat.

Hesitancy around uptake of a coronavirus vaccine was greater among nurses than among
physicians and physician counterparts. This trend has been shown in numerous studies of
attitudes around influenza vaccination, and should be taken seriously by public health authorities
considering the fact that nurses frequently interface with patients, particularly around vaccine
administration, and often are in charge of directly administering vaccines.27-29

In the context of forthcoming distribution efforts, in which healthcare workers have frequently
and publicly been touted as priority vaccine recipients18, these findings seem to suggest that
many in the field might be wary of serving as “guinea pigs” for vaccines that have had limited
public messaging around their effectiveness, side effects, and other parameters of interest to this
group. Despite this, 69.3% of our cohort still felt that healthcare workers should have early
access to a vaccine. These apparent contradictions may be explained by a desire to ensure
vaccine accessibility while maintaining decisional autonomy over one’s personal healthcare.
They may also reflect the inherent role that emotions, personal values, and worldviews play in
health decision making,30-32 a key facet for public health communicators to take into account
when marketing novel vaccines to both the healthcare community and the general public.33

This study had several limitations. Although the majority of participants opted in to this
supplemental vaccine attitudes survey, a high proportion of cohort members did not. Despite this,
a side-by-side comparison of the full study cohort and vaccine module respondents shows similar
demographic breakdowns for each, diminishing the risk of selection bias. Our cohort was
overwhelmingly highly educated and of higher socioeconomic status. This trend is, in part, a
reflection of the post-graduate degrees required by those in many healthcare positions, though a
more thorough sampling of other health system employees with diverse economic backgrounds
and job types should be pursued for recruitment in future studies. Additionally, this crosssectional study measured vaccine attitudes at a specific time point in the COVID-19 pandemic
from late September to mid-October, 2020. As major vaccine news, political circumstances, and

regional epidemiologic data change on a daily basis, it is likely that vaccine attitudes will change
frequently over time, and thus will need to be longitudinally monitored.

As national and local experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic have unveiled our
deficiencies in public health communication, HCW remain key allies in disease control
strategies. Hesitancy towards a novel coronavirus vaccine among this cohort should serve as a
warning sign to public health authorities, as it could trigger a ripple effect in the general public.
It may also signal an unwillingness on the part of health practitioners to administer a vaccine to
patients in later stages of vaccine distribution, once more doses are available.10,34

A public health-led coronavirus vaccine roll-out will need to address concerns raised by the
public and HCW regarding the ‘warp speed’ research and development timeline, lack of publicly
available data from ongoing vaccine trials, and the highly politicized vaccine approval process if
it hopes to gain broad acceptance and public buy-in. Our survey found that being confronted with
simple scientific facts regarding disease transmission, like a reproductive number, can increase
one’s willingness to vaccinate. Future inquiries on this topic should examine the politicization of
vaccine development and whether results of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election have in any way
modified the likelihood of coronavirus vaccine acceptance. Examining the impact of sciencebased marketing strategies will also be key to this effort. A recent study on coronavirus vaccine
attitudes suggests reporting higher rates of vaccine effectiveness is correlated with greater public
vaccine acceptance.35 Publicized, data-driven updates from ongoing vaccine trials may have a
positive effect on healthcare worker willingness to receive and recommend coronavirus vaccines.
Successful rollout of a novel coronavirus vaccine will need to build trust and confidence in
