Abstract

30

Type III interferons have been touted as promising therapeutics in outpatients with coronavirus

31

disease 2019 (COVID-19). We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial in 120 patients

32

with mild to moderate COVID-19 to determine whether a single, 180 mcg subcutaneous dose of

33

Peginterferon Lambda-1a (Lambda) could shorten the duration of viral shedding (primary

34

endpoint) or symptoms (secondary endpoint, NCT04331899). In both the 60 patients receiving

35

Lambda and the 60 receiving placebo, the median time to cessation of viral shedding was 7 days

36

(hazard ratio [HR] = 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56 to 1.19). Symptoms resolved in 8

37

and 9 days in Lambda and placebo, respectively (HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.39). At enrollment;

38

41% of subjects were SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositive; compared to placebo, lambda tended to

39

delay shedding cessation in seronegatives (aHR 0.66, 95% CI 0.39-1.10) and to hasten shedding

40

cessation in seropositives (aHR 1.58, 95% CI 0.88-2.86; p for interaction = 0.03). Liver

41

transaminase elevations were more common in the Lambda vs. placebo arm (15/60 vs 5/60; p =

42

0.027). In this study, a single dose of subcutaneous Peginterferon Lambda-1a neither shortened

43

the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding nor improved symptoms in outpatients with

44

uncomplicated COVID-19.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

49

Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to nearly 1 million deaths worldwide as of September

50

2020.1 Although most infected patients display mild symptoms, even uncomplicated infections

51

can contribute to transmission to those with co-morbid conditions and other high risk groups,

52

increasing overall mortality.2 With the unprecedented health and economic threats imposed by

53

COVID-19, therapeutics are urgently needed to shorten the duration of viral shedding, relieve

54

symptoms, and prevent hospitalizations..

55
56

Interferons (IFNs) are promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics, given their importance in the

57

early response to viral infections.3 Innate immune sensing of viral nucleic acids leads to

58

production of type I (IFN-α, IFN-β) and type III (IFN-λ) IFNs that, after binding to their cognate

59

receptors, activate genes critical for host protection.4-6 SARS-CoV-2 encodes proteins that

60

suppress production of endogenous IFN7, and infection has been associated with markedly

61

reduced type I and type III IFN signaling8, particularly in patients with severe manifestations of

62

disease.9,10 Both type I and type III IFNs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro11,12, suggesting potential

63

utility of exogenous IFN administration to aid in viral control and prevent disease progression. In

64

support of this hypothesis, recent trials in hospitalized COVID-19 patients have reported that

65

type I IFN administration may reduce the duration of viral shedding and symptoms.13-15

66
67

Whereas cognate receptors to type I IFNs are expressed ubiquitously, the receptor complex

68

(IL28R) for IFN-λ is expressed on only a few cell types, including epithelial cells in the

69

gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.4,16,17 These cellular affinities have led investigators to use

70

this agent to target viral hepatitides18,19 and respiratory viral infections16. In a murine model of

71

influenza infection, IFN-λ treatment post-infection was associated with significantly lower

72

mortality compared to mice treated with IFN-α, and this was associated with lower influenza

73

viral loads20. A pegylated form of recombinant IFN-λ, Peginterferon Lambda-1a (Lambda) has

74

been developed for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis. Lambda, given weekly as 180 mcg

75

subcutaneous injections, has comparable antiviral efficacy and an improved tolerability profile

76

compared with type I IFN for the treatment of hepatitis21, likely due to its relatively limited

77

receptor distribution. In a murine model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, subcutaneous administration

78

of Lambda prophylactically or early after infection diminished SARS-CoV-2 replication in the

79

lower respiratory tracts of mice in vivo11.

80
81

Lambda has thus emerged as a promising treatment candidate for SARS-CoV-222,23 given a

82

plausible mechanism of action, the suppression of IFN activity by SARS-CoV2, and in vitro and

83

in vivo studies showing that IFN-λ administration can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. To date,

84

no therapies have been approved for outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. We

85

therefore conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of Lambda for outpatients with

86

uncomplicated SARS-CoV-2 infection. We tested the hypothesis that a single, 180 mcg

87

subcutaneous injection of Lambda would be associated with a shorter duration of viral shedding

88

in comparison to a normal saline placebo injection.

Cohort Characteristics

92

We enrolled 120 participants between April 25 and July 17, 2020, of whom 110 (91.7%)

93

completed 28 days of follow up (Fig 1a). The median age was 36 years (range 18-71), 50

94

participants (41.7%) were female, and 75 (62.5%) were Latinx ethnicity (Table 1). Eight (6.7%)

95

participants were asymptomatic at baseline. Of those with symptoms, the median duration of

96

symptoms prior to randomization was five days. The most common symptoms were fatigue,

97

cough, headache, and myalgias (Table 1, Fig S1). Only 13 (10.8%) participants had an elevated

98

temperature (>99.5°F) at baseline; the median oxygen saturation was 98%.

Baseline oropharyngeal viral RNA level and SARS-CoV-2 IgG serostatus

101

The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was assessed at baseline and at 8 follow-up visits using

102

oropharyngeal swabs, a Centers for Disease Control approved method for SARS-CoV-2

103

detection24. This method was selected given the frequency of repeated assessments and improved

104

tolerability for participants compared with nasopharyngeal swabs. The median SARS-CoV-2

105

oropharyngeal viral PCR cycle threshold at enrollment was 30.3 (corresponding to a median viral

106

load of 4.4 Log10 copies/ml), and did not differ significantly between groups (Table 1).

107
108

IgG antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) were

109

assessed at enrollment by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.25 At enrollment, 49 (40.8%)

110

participants were SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositive. Baseline SARS-CoV-2 serostatus did not

111

significantly differ between groups (Table 1). The median duration of symptoms prior to

112

enrollment was significantly shorter in SARS-CoV-2 IgG seronegative vs. seropositive

113

participants (median [interquartile range [IQR]]: 3.5 [2.5-5] days vs. 5 [4-7] days, P=0.0051).

114

Seronegative participants also had significantly higher oropharyngeal viral RNA levels at

115

enrollment compared with seropositive participants (median [IQR] log10 viral load 4.4 [2.5] vs.

116

2.0 [2.4]).

Primary Virologic Analysis

119

Of 120 enrolled participants, 60 were randomized to receive Lambda and 60 randomized to

120

receive placebo and included in the analysis. The median time to cessation of oropharyngeal

121

viral shedding was 7 days in both arms (95% CI 5-10 days for placebo vs 5-13 days for Lambda,

122

Table 2). There was no significant difference in the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for shedding

123

cessation between Lambda and placebo; participants in the lambda arm were 19% less likely to

124

cease shedding at any point during the study period compared to participants in the placebo arm

125

(aHR 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56 to 1.19; p = 0.29, Fig 2A.) Overall, 108

126

participants met the primary endpoint and were not censored. Because two participants, after

127

randomization, inadvertently were injected with the incorrect syringe, we also conducted an as-

128

treated analysis according to treatment actually received. Findings from an as-treated analysis

129

(aHR 0.83, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.21; p = 0.33) and an analysis performed in symptomatic patients

130

only (aHR 0.77, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.15, p = 0.21) were similar.

131
132

In exploratory analysis, seropositivity at baseline was associated with significantly hastened

133

shedding cessation. The median time to shedding cessation was 10 days in SARS-CoV-2 IgG

134

seronegative individuals vs. 3 days in seropositive individuals (95% CI 7-14 days for

135

seronegative vs 1-6 days for seropositive, aHR 2.65, 95% CI 1.74-4.03, P<0.001, Fig S2).

136

Baseline serostatus also significantly modified the effect of treatment on time to shedding

137

cessation (p = 0.03). Among seronegative individuals, Lambda delayed shedding cessation

138

compared with placebo (aHR 0.66, 95% CI 0.39-1.10, Fig 3a). Among seropositive individuals,

139

Lambda hastened shedding cessation (aHR 1.58, 95% CI 0.88-2.86, Fig 3a).

140
141

Higher oropharyngeal viral RNA levels at baseline were associated with significantly delayed

142

shedding cessation (aHR 0.32 comparing baseline CT <30 vs baseline CT >=30, 95% CI 0.21-

143

0.50, P<0.001, Fig S3). Although baseline oropharyngeal viral RNA levels did not significantly

144

modify the effect of treatment on time to shedding cessation (p=0.15), among individuals with

145

high baseline viral RNA levels, Lambda delayed shedding cessation compared with placebo

146

(aHR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26-1.04, Fig 3b). There was no difference in shedding cessation between

147

arms with low baseline viral RNA levels (aHR 0.95, 95% CI 0.60-1.52, Fig 3b). No other

148

baseline features of interest significantly modified the effect of treatment and the primary

149

outcome (Table S1).

150
151

Secondary analyses

152

No significant difference in time to resolution of symptoms (aHR 0.94; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.39; p =

153

0.76, Fig 2B) or sustained resolution of symptoms (aHR 0.92; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.41; p = 0.70)

154

was observed, nor did we find any significant difference in resolution of symptom complexes

155

(Table 2, Fig S4). Time to clinical progression was not significantly different between the two

156

arms (aHR 1.38; 95% CI 0.52 to 3.63; p = 0.52). Trajectory of viral RNA levels did not vary by

157

treatment arm (p=0.91, Fig S5) nor did viral RNA area under the curve (p = 0.95, Table 2).

159

Adverse Events

160

Twenty-five (42%) Lambda and 21 (35%) placebo participants experienced adverse events

161

(Table 3). Two serious adverse events (hospitalizations) were reported in each arm. Liver

162

transaminase elevations were more common in the Lambda vs. placebo arm (15 vs 5; p = 0.027).

163

Furthermore, we observed significant elevations in alanine transaminase levels from day 0 to day

167

Discussion

168

In this study of outpatients with uncomplicated SARS-CoV-2 infection, a single subcutaneous

169

injection of Lambda did not significantly reduce time to viral clearance or resolution of

170

symptoms compared with placebo. We recruited participants within 72 hours of diagnosis,

171

giving us an excellent opportunity to intervene early within the course of infection. We attained

172

excellent follow-up and retention, with few missed visits (<5%), and little missing data. Despite

173

these strengths and compelling preclinical data--i.e., a plausible mechanism of action, the

174

suppression of IFN activity by respiratory coronaviruses, and both in vitro and in vivo studies

175

showing inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by IFN-λ11,12--this phase 2 trial yielded little

176

promise of efficacy at the tested dose and administration schedule. Lambda was well-tolerated,

177

with few adverse effects, though asymptomatic liver transaminase elevations occurred more

178

frequently in participants randomized to Lambda and are consistent with previous reports.21,26

179
180

The lack of effect of Lambda was surprising given recently described in vitro data and benefits

181

seen in an in vivo model with early therapeutic and prophylactic administration12. There are

182

several potential reasons for this lack of benefit. First, although we attempted to randomize

183

participants as soon as possible after the COVID-19 diagnosis was made, the median symptom

184

duration was 5 days at the time of randomization, and 40% of participants were already SARS-

185

CoV-2 IgG positive at enrollment. It is possible that earlier administration, or prophylactic

186

administration prior to established infection, would have been beneficial. Arguing against this,

8

187

we observed no evidence of benefit among SARS-CoV-2 seronegative individuals, who

188

presumably have been infected a shorter period of time. Second, a single, 180 mcg subcutaneous

189

injection of Lambda may not achieve adequate therapeutic levels of drug in the upper respiratory

190

epithelia. Consistent with this, a murine model of SARS-CoV-2 infection found that

191

subcutaneous administration of Lambda did not result in significant reductions of SARS-CoV-2

192

viral titers in upper respiratory epithelium.12 It is possible that higher, or more frequent, dosing

193

may have been beneficial. However, subcutaneous doses greater than 180 mcg in humans are

194

limited by increasing drug toxicity, including significant liver transaminase elevations21. Finally,

195

IFN-λ has been shown to disrupt the lung epithelial barrier in mice, leading to worsened disease

196

course and increase susceptibility to bacterial superinfection27,28. This may negate any positive

197

antiviral effects.

198
199

These data are in contrast to reports of benefits of Type I IFN in hospitalized COVID-19

200

patients. Subcutaneous IFN-β along with ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with

201

shortened duration of symptoms and viral shedding in hospitalized patients in Hong Kong14, and

202

a randomized clinical trial in England also suggest benefits of inhaled IFN-β for COVID-19.29

203

Although both type I and type III IFN activate the same dominant JAK-STAT signaling

204

pathway6, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro10,11, and have receptors on respiratory epithelia16, in vivo

205

activity and efficacy may differ6. A recent report found that inborn errors of Type I IFN

206

immunity, including autosomal recessive IFNAR1 deficiency, were enriched in patients with

207

life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia30. Furthermore. patients with COVID-19 pneumonia

208

were also more likely to have neutralizing auto-antibodies against type I, but not type III, IFNs31.

209

These data suggest the possibility that type I IFN administration may be more beneficial than

210

type III IFN in preventing adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

211
212

Although there was some evidence that SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity at baseline modified the

213

effect of treatment on shedding cessation, the effect modification was in the opposite direction

214

than we had anticipated; Lambda appeared to prolong shedding relative to placebo among those

215

who were seronegative at baseline, and to shorten the duration of shedding among those who

216

were seropositive at baseline. Furthermore, Lambda also appeared to prolong shedding relative

217

to placebo among those with high baseline viral RNA levels. These findings should be

218

interpreted with caution for two reasons. First, these were exploratory analysis only and should

219

be considered hypothesis generating. Second, these observations defy biological plausibility

220

based on in vitro and animal model data.

221
222

The majority (62.5%) of participants in our study were Latinx, reflecting the high burden of

223

COVID-19 among the Latinx community in our surrounding communities.32 Minority

224

populations are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with higher rates of infection and

225

deaths observed due to a multitude of socioeconomic and demographic factors.33,34 Attention has

226

recently been called to the relative absence of the most affected minorities in treatment trials35,36,

227

and we prioritized recruitment efforts to the Latinx community in our study.

228
229

The study did have a few limitations. We recruited both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.

230

Asymptomatic patients contributed less to secondary outcomes since they presented with lower

231

viral RNA levels and could not contribute to analyses of symptom alleviation. However, these

10

232

patients represented <10% of the enrolled cohort. Additionally, despite a reported median

233

duration of symptoms prior to randomization of only 5 days, 40% of participants were already

234

seropositive at enrollment. Unpublished data from a Regeneron outpatient monoclonal antibody

235

study with similar study design (REGN-COV2) found similar rates of baseline SARS-CoV-2

236

IgG seropositivity (45%).37 These data suggest that enrolling COVID-19 outpatients early in the

237

course of disease, before they develop an antibody response, may be challenging. Nonetheless,

238

we found no suggestion of benefit of Lambda in seronegative individuals. Finally, the median

239

time to cessation in the placebo arm was shorter than assumed in our sample size calculations,

240

potentially due to less severe disease in this population. However, our original sample size

241

estimates based on the number of events and median time to event were conservative; a shorter

242

time to cessation, keeping all other assumptions the same, increases the power to detect

243

differences between groups.

244
245

In conclusion, a single dose of subcutaneous Peginterferon Lambda-1a, while safe, neither

246

reduced time to cessation of viral shedding nor symptom duration in outpatients with

247

uncomplicated COVID-19 in this large, Phase 2, single-center study. Further investigation into

248

the therapeutic utility of type III interferons for COVID-19 in patients with severe illness or as a

249

prophylactic treatment are underway.

conducted within the Stanford Health Care System. Adults aged 18-65 years with an FDA

257

emergency use authorized reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive for

258

SARS-CoV-2 within 72 hours from swab to the time of enrolment were eligible for participation

breaths per minute, room air oxygen saturation <94%, pregnancy or breastfeeding, history of

261

decompensated liver disease, recent use of interferons, antibiotics, anticoagulants or other

amended on June 16th, 2020 after 54 participants were enrolled but before results were available

265

to include adults up to 75 years of age and eliminate exclusion criteria for low white blood cell

266

and lymphocyte count. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04331899). The

study was performed as an investigator initiated clinical trial with the FDA (IND 419217), and

268

approved by the Institutional Review Board of Stanford University.

Recruitment and Enrolment

271

Participants were recruited with flyers, online advertising, and phone calls to Stanford patients

272

with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Recruitment materials and phone calls were provided in

273

multiple languages, including English and Spanish. After confirming eligibility and providing

274

informed consent in the patient’s primary language, participants underwent a standardized

275

history and physical exam, and completed bloodwork. If inclusion criteria were met, participants

276

were randomly assigned to Lambda or placebo using a 1:1 REDCAP-based computer-generated

277

randomization scheme that stratified by age (≥ 50 and < 50 years old) and sex. A password-

278

protected electronic spreadsheet containing the randomization allocation, along with the code

Study drug administration

283

Phase 2 studies established the optimal dose for virologic suppression and minimizing treatment-

284

related adverse events (mainly aminotransferase and/or bilirubin elevations) for hepatitis C at

285

180 mcg given subcutaneously21. This dose is also currently being used in hepatitis D trials, and

286

was provided by Eiger BioPharmaceuticals for use in this study. Those assigned to Lambda

287

received a single 180 mcg subcutaneous injection of study drug (0.45 mL volume), and those

288

assigned to placebo received a 0.45 mL subcutaneous injection of saline (prepared by the

289

Stanford Investigational Pharmacy). The study medication/placebo syringe was dispensed by the

290

Stanford Investigational Pharmacist and administered by a study nurse. Lambda and placebo

291

syringes were identically labeled but differed in the appearance of the needle hub. Since the

292

nurse administering the medication might see syringe differences, the study was not strictly

293

“double-blind” even though all participants and investigators were blinded to treatment arm.

294

Participants were monitored for adverse events for thirty minutes after injection.

295
296

Participant Follow Up

297

Participants completed a daily symptom questionnaire using REDCap Cloud version 1.5.

298

Participants also provided in-home measurements of temperature and oxygen saturation using

299

study-provided devices. In-person follow-up visits were conducted at Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21,

300

and 28, with assessment of symptoms and vitals, and collection of oropharyngeal swabs (FLOQ

Swabs; Copan Diagnostics). Peripheral blood was also collected at Day 5 and 14 to assess for

302

safety events.

303
304

Laboratory procedures

305

Laboratory measurements were performed by trained study personnel using point-of-care CLIA-

306

waived devices or in the Stanford Health Care Clinical Laboratory. Oropharyngeal swabs were

307

tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the Stanford Clinical Virology Laboratory using an emergency use

308

authorized, laboratory-developed, RT-PCR.38,39 40 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

309

guidelines identify oropharyngeal swabs as acceptable upper respiratory specimens to test for the

310

presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA,24 and detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA swabs using

311

oropharyngeal swabs was analytically validated in the Stanford virology laboratory.

312
313

IgG antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) were

314

assessed at enrolment.25 Briefly, heat inactivated serum samples at enrolment were diluted 5-fold

315

starting at 1:50 and IgG antibody titers against RBD determined by ELISA. Absorbance was

316

measured at 450nm (SPECTRAmax 250, Molecular Devices). Samples were considered

317

seropositive against RBD if their absorbance value was greater than the mean plus four standard

318

deviation (SD) of all negative controls (n=130).

319
320

Data and Safety Monitoring

321

Adverse events were assessed and graded for severity according to standardized criteria.20 A

322

Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) was established and conducted an interim analysis

323

to review clinical trial progress, integrity, and safety data.

Study Outcomes

326

The primary outcome was time to first of two consecutive negative oropharyngeal tests for

327

SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Secondary outcomes included: 1) Time to alleviation of all

328

symptoms, defined as time until the first day when no symptoms were reported; 2) SARS-CoV-2

329

oropharyngeal viral RNA levels over time; 3) SARS-CoV-2 oropharyngeal viral RNA area under

330

the curve (AUC); and 4) Incidence of emergency department visits or hospitalizations within 28

331

days of initiation of treatment. Adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) were the primary

332

safety endpoints. For secondary outcomes utilizing oropharyngeal viral RNA levels, we used the

333

following conversion formula from cycle threshold values to copies/ml PBS:

334
335
336

10^(-0.288*Ct + 11.007) X 120

337

Exploratory outcomes included: 1) Time until sustained resolution of symptoms, defined as the

338

first day when no symptoms were reported for the duration of the study; 2) Progression of

339

disease, defined as admission to the emergency department, hospitalization, or worsening cough

340

or shortness of breath defined as an increase in severity of two points or more on a five-point

341

scale.

342
343

Statistical Analysis

344

Analyses were performed according to assigned randomization arm (intent-to-treat). Absolute

345

standardized differences are displayed to compare the distribution of baseline characteristics41.

346

All models were covariate-adjusted for the randomization strata of age group and sex. Unless

347

otherwise noted, all tests were two-sided and conducted at the 0.05 level of significance.

348

Analyses were performed in R version 4.0.2.42

349
350

Primary analysis: Time until shedding cessation was compared between arms using a Cox

351

proportional hazards model covariate-adjusted for age and sex, with the final hypothesis test

352

conducted at the alpha = 0·04999 level of significance to allow for an interim analysis. The

353

hazard ratio for shedding cessation was estimated, along with its 95% confidence interval.

354

Participants who dropped out prior to having two consecutive negative tests were censored at the

355

time of their last positive test or on Day 1 if no positive tests were observed. The proportional

356

hazards assumption was verified by examining the Schoenfeld residuals. Efron’s approximation

357

was used to handle ties in the Cox proportional hazards model.

358
359

Secondary analysis: Time until resolution of symptoms was compared using a Cox proportional

360

hazards model. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were reported. Change in viral load

361

during follow-up was compared using a linear mixed-effects model with random intercepts for

362

participant. The AUC of viral load was compared using linear regression. Multiple

363

imputation using chained equations was used to impute missing viral load data prior to area

364

under the curve calculation. Five data sets were imputed, and imputed values calculated using

365

non-missing viral load on each of the 7 sample collection days, treatment arm, age, sex, and

366

whether or not a participant was hospitalized. Model estimates were pooled across the five

367

imputed datasets by computing the total variance over the repeated analyses.

368
369

Estimates for change in viral load and viral load AUC for lambda compared to placebo and

370

corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the linear models were reported. The incidence of

371

hospitalizations and emergency department visits was estimated for each arm, with 95%

372

confidence intervals. AEs were compared by arm using the Chi-squared test and Fisher’s exact

373

test for SAEs.

374
375

A sensitivity analysis was performed for the primary endpoint using only symptomatic patients

376

at baseline. Because two participants, after randomization, inadvertently were injected with the

377

incorrect syringe, we also conducted an as-treated analysis according to treatment actually

378

received.

379
380

A statistical interaction term between treatment arm and symptomatic status at baseline was

381

added to the Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age group and sex to test whether

382

symptomatic status was an effect modifier of the relationship between treatment and time to

383

shedding cessation. The main effect of each potential effect modifier was also included in the

384

model. Additional effect modifiers specified a priori were 1) having a CT value < 30 (vs ≥ 30)

385

on baseline oropharyngeal swab, 2) IgG seropositivity at baseline, and 3) number of risk factors

386

or predictors for severe disease present at baseline (temperature ≥ 99.5, cough, or shortness of

387

breath present at randomization [symptoms count as a single risk factor], age ≥ 60, male sex,

388

Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, body mass index ≥ 30, and lab values of baseline lymphocyte

389

counts < 1000 and baseline ALT ≥ 94). Effect modification was considered significant if the P

390

value for interaction was <0.05.

391

Post hoc analyses were conducted to test for differences in both median duration of symptoms

392

pre-randomization and baseline log10 viral load between seronegative and seropositive

393

participants. The Kruskal-Wallis rank sum was used to test for differences in symptom duration

394

while a two-sample t-test was used to test for differences in log10 viral load.

395

Sample Size Determination

396

Assuming 1:1 randomization and the use of a two-sided log rank test at the alpha=0.04999 level

397

of significance for the final analysis, we anticipated the occurrence of 79 shedding cessation

398

events, which provided 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 2.03. We additionally assumed

399

median time to shedding cessation of 14 days in the control arm and 7 days in the treatment arm,

400

a two-month accrual period, a two-week follow-up period after randomization of the last patient,

401

and 10% drop out in the control arm. This enabled an interim analysis conducted at

402

alpha=0·00001 to assess overwhelming efficacy after 50% of participants completed 24 hours of

403

follow-up. We estimated that the total sample size required to achieve 79 events was 120 (60

404

participants per arm).
