Abstract
Background
COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading disease that has caused extensive burden to individuals, families,
countries, and the world. Effective treatments of COVID-19 are urgently needed. This is the second
edition of a living systematic review of randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of all
treatment interventions for participants in all age groups with COVID-19.

Methods and findings
We planned to conduct aggregate data meta-analyses, trial sequential analyses, network metaanalysis, and individual patient data meta-analyses. Our systematic review was based on PRISMA
and Cochrane guidelines, and our eight-step procedure for better validation of clinical significance
of meta-analysis results. We performed both fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analyses.
Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were
admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, quality of life, and
non-serious adverse events. According to the number of outcome comparisons, we adjusted our
threshold for significance to p = 0.033. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We
searched relevant databases and websites for published and unpublished trials until November 2,
2020. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial methodology.
We included 82 randomized clinical trials enrolling a total of 40,249 participants. 81 out of 82 trials
were at overall high risk of bias.
Meta-analyses showed no evidence of a difference between corticosteroids versus control on allcause mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79 to 1.00; p = 0.05; I2 =
23.1%; eight trials; very low certainty), on serious adverse events (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.99; p
= 0.04; I2 = 39.1%; eight trials; very low certainty), and on mechanical ventilation (RR 0.86; 95%
CI 0.55 to 1.33; p = 0.49; I2 = 55.3%; two trials; very low certainty). The fixed-effect meta-analyses
showed indications of beneficial effects. Trial sequential analyses showed that the required
information size for all three analyses was not reached.
Meta-analysis (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.07; p = 0.31; I2 = 0%; four trials; moderate certainty) and
trial sequential analysis (boundary for futility crossed) showed that we could reject that remdesivir
versus control reduced the risk of death by 20%. Meta-analysis (RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.00; p =

0.05; I2 = 38.9%; four trials; very low certainty) and trial sequential analysis (required information
size not reached) showed no evidence of difference between remdesivir versus control on serious
adverse events. Fixed-effect meta-analysis showed indications of a beneficial effect of remdesivir
on serious adverse events.
Meta-analysis (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.87; p = 0.02; I2 = 0%; two trials; very low certainty)
showed evidence of a beneficial effect of intravenous immunoglobulin versus control on all-cause
mortality, but trial sequential analysis (required information size not reached) showed that the result
was severely underpowered to confirm or reject realistic intervention effects.
Meta-analysis (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.35 to 1.14; p = 0.12; I2 = 77.4%; five trials; very low certainty)
and trial sequential analysis (required information size not reached) showed no evidence of a
difference between tocilizumab versus control on serious adverse events. Fixed-effect meta-analysis
showed indications of a beneficial effect of tocilizumab on serious adverse events. Meta-analysis
(RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.96; p = 0.02; I2 = 0%; three trials; very low certainty) showed evidence
of a beneficial effect of tocilizumab versus control on mechanical ventilation, but trial sequential
analysis (required information size not reached) showed that the result was severely underpowered
to confirm of reject realistic intervention effects.
Meta-analysis (RR 0.32; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.69; p < 0.00; I2 = 0%; two trials; very low certainty)
showed evidence of a beneficial effect of bromhexidine versus standard care on non-serious adverse
events, but trial sequential analysis (required information size not reached) showed that the result
was severely underpowered to confirm or reject realistic intervention effects.
Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses (boundary for futility crossed) showed that we could
reject that hydroxychloroquine versus control reduced the risk of death and serious adverse events
by 20%.
Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses (boundary for futility crossed) showed that we could
reject that lopinavir-ritonavir versus control reduced the risk of death, serious adverse events, and
mechanical ventilation by 20%.
All remaining outcome comparisons showed that we did not have enough information to confirm or
reject realistic intervention effects. Nine single trials showed statistically significant results on our

outcomes, but were underpowered to confirm or reject realistic intervention effects. Due to lack of
data, it was not relevant to perform network meta-analysis or possible to perform individual patient
data meta-analyses.
Conclusions
No evidence-based treatment for COVID-19 currently exists. Very low certainty evidence indicates
that corticosteroids might reduce the risk of death, serious adverse events, and mechanical
ventilation; that remdesivir might reduce the risk of serious adverse events; that intraveneous
immunoglobin might reduce the risk of death and serious adverse events; that tocilizumab might
reduce the risk of serious adverse events and mechanical ventilation; and that bromhexidine might
reduce the risk of non-serious adverse events. More trials with low risks of bias and random errors
are urgently needed. This review will continuously inform best practice in treatment and clinical
research of COVID-19.

Introduction
In 2019, a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) caused an international outbreak of the respiratory illness COVID-19 [1]. Since the initial
outbreak in China, SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally and COVID-19 is labeled a public health
emergency of global concern by the World Health Organization [2]. The full spectrum of COVID19 ranges from subclinical infection over mild, self-limiting respiratory tract illness to severe
progressive pneumonia, multiorgan failure, and death [3]. Severe disease onset might result in death
due to massive alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure [4-6].

Many randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of different potential treatments for COVID19 are currently underway. However, a single trial can rarely validly assess the effects of any
intervention and there is an urgent need to continuously surveil and update the aggregated evidence
base so that effective interventions, if such exist, are implemented in clinical practice [7].

The present living systematic review with aggregate meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses
aims to continuously inform evidence-based guideline recommendations for the treatment of
COVID-19, taking risks of systematic errors (‘bias’), risks of random errors (‘play of chance’), and
certainty of the findings into consideration [8].

Methods
We report this systematic review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines (S1 Text) [9,10]. The updated methodology used in this

living systematic review is according to the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of
Interventions [11] and described in our protocol [8], which was registered in the PROSPERO
database (ID: CRD42020178787) prior to the systematic literature search.

Search strategy and selection criteria
Electronic searches
An information specialist searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)
in The Cochrane Library, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE
Ovid), Excerpta Medica database (Embase Ovid), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences
Literature (LILACS; Bireme), Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED; Web of
Science), Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science (CPCI-S; Web of Science), BIOSIS
(Web of Science), CINAHL (EBSCO host), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China
Network Knowledge Information (CNKI), Chinese Science Journal Database (VIP), and Wanfang
Database to identify relevant trials. We searched all databases from their inception and until
November 2, 2020. Trials were included irrespective of language, publication status, publication
year, and publication type. For the detailed search strategies for all electronic searches, see S2 Text.

Searching other resources
The reference lists of relevant trial publications were checked for any unidentified randomized
clinical trials. To identify unpublished trials, we searched clinical trial registries (e.g.
clinicaltrials.gov, clinicaltrialregister.eu, who.int/ictrp, chictr.org.cn) of Europe, USA, and China,
and websites of pharmaceutical companies and of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and
European Medicines Agency (EMA). We also searched the COVID-19 Study Registry [12] and
the real-time dashboard of randomized trials [13].

We included unpublished and grey literature trials and assessed relevant retraction statements and
errata for included trials. We also searched preprint servers (bioRxiv, medRxiv) for unpublished
trials. We contacted all corresponding authors to obtain individual patient data.

Living systematic review
In this living systematic review, two independent investigators receive a weekly updated literature
search file, and continuously include relevant newly published or unpublished trials. The relevant
meta-analyses, trial sequential analyses, and network meta-analysis will be continuously updated,
and if new evidence is available (judged by the author group), the results will be submitted for
publication. Every month, the author group will discuss whether searching once a week is
necessary. For a detailed overview of the living systematic review work flow, see our protocol [8].
As this is a living systematic review analyzing results of randomized clinical trials, no ethical
approval is required.

Data extraction
Two authors (EEN and JF) independently screened relevant trials. Seven authors in pairs (SJ, EEN,
JF, FS, CKJ, EB, JH) independently extracted data using a standardized data extraction sheet. Any
discrepancies were resolved through discussion, or if required, through discussion with a third
author (JCJ). We contacted corresponding authors if relevant data were unclear or missing.

Risk of bias assessment
Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool – version 2 (RoB 2) [11,14]. Seven
authors in pairs (SJ, EEN, JF, FS, CKJ, EB, JH) independently assessed risk of bias. Any

discrepancies were resolved through discussion or, if required, through discussion with a third
author (JCJ). Bias was assessed with the following domains: bias arising from the randomization
process, bias due to deviations from the intended interventions, bias due to missing outcome data,
bias in measurement of outcomes, and bias arising from selective reporting of results [11,14]. We
contacted corresponding authors of trials with unclear or missing data.

Outcomes and subgroup analyses
Primary and secondary outcomes were predefined in our protocol [8]. Primary outcomes were allcause mortality and serious adverse events (as defined by the ICH-GCP guidelines) [8,15].
Secondary outcomes were admission to intensive care (as defined by trialists), mechanical
ventilation (as defined by trialists), renal replacement therapy (as defined by trialists), quality of
life, and non-serious adverse events. We classified non-serious adverse events as any adverse event
not assessed as serious according to the ICH-GCP definition.
We chose to add time to clinical improvement as a post hoc outcome. We planned several subgroup
analyses, which are described in detail in our protocol [8]. For all outcomes, we used the trial
results reported at maximum follow-up.

Assessment of statistical and clinical significance
We performed our aggregate data meta-analyses according to Cochrane [11], Keus et al. [16], and
the eight-step assessment by Jakobsen et al. [17] for better validation of meta-analytic results in
systematic reviews. Review Manager version 5.4 [18] and Stata 16 (StataCorp LLC, College
Station, TX, USA) [19] were used for all statistical analyses. We used risk ratios (RR) for
dichotomous outcomes. We assessed a total of two primary outcomes per comparison, and we

therefore adjusted our thresholds for significance [17] and considered a p-value of 0.033 or less as
the threshold for statistical significance [8,17]. Because we primarily considered results of
secondary outcomes as hypothesis generating, we did not adjust the p-value for secondary
outcomes. We conducted both random-effects (DerSimonian-Laird) and fixed-effect (MantelHaenszel) meta-analyses for all analyses and chose the most conservative result as our primary
result [11,17,20,21]. We used trial sequential analysis to control for random errors [22-30]. Trial
sequential analysis estimates the diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS), which is the
number of participants needed in a meta-analysis to detect or reject a certain intervention effect.
Statistical heterogeneity was quantified by calculating heterogeneity (I2) for traditional metaanalyses and diversity (D2) for trial sequential analysis. We used Grading Recommendations
Assessment Development Evaluation (GRADE) to assess the certainty of evidence. We
downgraded imprecision in GRADE by two levels if the accrued number of participants were below
50% of the DARIS, and one level if between 50% and 100% of DARIS [17]. We did not
downgrade if benefit, harm, futility or DARIS were reached. We used Fisher’s exact test to
calculate p-values for all single trial results.

Results
Study characteristics
On November 2, 2020 our literature searches identified 15,359 records after duplicates were
removed. We included a total of 82 clinical trials randomizing 40,249 participants (Fig 1) [31-114].
We identified several trials including participants suspected of COVID-19 [115,116]. None of the
trials reported separate data on COVID-19 positive participants compared to the remaining
participants. We included trials if approximately 50% or more participants had a confirmed

Characteristics of included trials and the trial results can be found in S2 Table. Most trials were at
high risk of bias (S3 Table).

The identified trials compared the following interventions: 10 trials compared corticosteroids versus
standard care [52,56,87,89,96-99] or placebo [68,88]; four trials compared remdesivir versus

standard care [39,51,78,91]; three trials compared azithromycin versus standard care [83] or cointerventions with standard care [54] or without standard care [82]; three trials compared colchicine
versus standard care [49], placebo plus standard care [92], or placebo plus a co-intervention [107];
two trials compared immunoglobulin versus standard care [57] or placebo [95]; six trials compared
tocilizumab versus standard care [93,111-113], placebo with standard care [90] or favipiravir alone
as co-intervention [114];two trials compared bromhexine versus standard care [94,104]; and three
trials compared favipiravir versus standard care [41,67] or a co-intervention alone [114].

The maximum follow-up time ranged from five [34,35] to 60 days [90,99] after randomization. For
several of our outcomes it was not possible to conduct meta-analysis due to insufficient data.

Corticosteroids versus control
We identified 10 trials (11 comparisons) randomizing 7,918 participants to corticosteroids versus
standard care [52,56,87,89,96-99] or placebo [68,88]. One trial was assessed at low risk of bias
[88]. The remaining trials were assessed at high risk of bias (S3 Table). Five trials assessed the
effects of methylprednisolone [56,68,96-98], three trials assessed the effects of dexamethasone
[52,87,99], and two trials (three comparisons) assessed the effects of hydrocortisone [88,89]. One
trial assessing the effects of methylprednisolone was not eligible for meta-analysis, as
approximately half of the participants in the experimental group were non-randomized [56]. We
contacted the trial authors and asked for separate data for all randomized participants, but did not
receive any response. Another trial assessing the effects of methylprednisolone was not eligible for

meta-analysis, as the trial did not report on any of our review outcomes [96]. We requested data for
our review outcomes from the trial authors but did not receive a response.

Meta-analysis of all-cause mortality
Random-effects meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between corticosteroids and
control on all-cause mortality (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.00; p = 0.05; I2 = 23.1%; eight trials; very
low certainty) (Fig 2, S4 Table). Fixed-effect meta-analysis showed evidence of a beneficial effect
of corticosteroids versus control on all-cause mortality (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.82 to 0.95; p = 0.00; I2
= 23.6%, eight trials) (S1 Fig). Visual inspection of the forest plot and measures to quantify
heterogeneity (I2 = 23.1%) indicated no substantial heterogeneity. The time-points of assessment
varied from 21 [88] to 30 days after randomization [97,118]. The trial sequential analysis showed
that we did not have enough information to confirm or reject that corticosteroids versus control
reduce the risk of all-cause mortality with a relative risk reduction of 20% (Fig 3). The subgroup
analysis assessing the effects of the different corticosteroids versus control showed no significant

Meta-analysis of serious adverse events
Random-effects meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between corticosteroids and
control on serious adverse events (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.99; p = 0.04; I2 = 39.1%; eight trials;
very low certainty) (S3 Fig, S4 Table). Fixed-effect meta-analysis showed evidence of a beneficial
effect of corticosteroids versus control on serious adverse events (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.82 to 0.95; p
= 0.00; I2 = 43.1%; eight trials) (S4 Fig). Visual inspection of the forest plot and measures to
quantify heterogeneity (I2 = 39.1%) indicated no substantial heterogeneity. The time-points of
assessment varied from 21 [88] to 30 days after randomization [97,118]. The trial sequential
analysis showed that we did not have enough information to confirm or reject that corticosteroids
versus control reduce the risk of serious adverse events with a relative risk reduction of 20% (S5
Fig). The subgroup analysis assessing the effects of the different corticosteroids versus control
showed no significant subgroup differences (p = 0.71) (S3 Fig). The serious adverse event data is
predominately based on mortality data, and assessed according to the ICH-GCP definition of a
serious adverse event [15].

Meta-analysis of mechanical ventilation
Random-effects meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between corticosteroids versus
control on mechanical ventilation (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.33; p = 0.49; I2 = 55.3%; two trials;
very low certainty) (S6 Fig, S4 Table). Fixed-effect meta-analysis showed evidence of a beneficial
effect of corticosteroids versus control on mechanical ventilation (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.94; p
= 0.01; I2 = 55.4%, two trials) (S7 Fig). Visual inspection of the forest plot and measures to

assessment varied from 7 days [68] to 28 days after randomization [47]. The trial sequential
analysis showed that we did not have enough information to confirm or reject that corticosteroids
versus control reduce the risk of receiving mechanical ventilation with a relative risk reduction of
20% (S8 Fig). The subgroup analysis assessing the effects of the different corticosteroids versus
control showed no significant subgroup differences (p = 0.13) (S6 Fig). One of the two trials [68]
had substantial missing data for this outcome, but it was a small trial that did not contribute with
much data compared to the second trial.

Remdesivir versus control
We identified four trials randomizing 7,370 participants to remdesivir versus standard care [86,110]
or placebo [43,65]. All trials were assessed at high risk of bias (S3 Table). One trial assessed two
different dosages of remdesivir versus standard care [86], and the two comparisons were both
included in the meta-analysis. We halved the control group to avoid double counting [11].

Meta-analysis of all-cause mortality
Random-effects meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between remdesivir versus
control on all-cause mortality (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.07; p = 0.31; I2 = 0%; four trials;
moderate certainty) (Fig 4, S5 Table). Visual inspection of the forest plot and measures to quantify
heterogeneity (I2 = 0%) indicated no heterogeneity. The assessment time points were 28 [43,86,110]
and 29 days after randomization [65]. The trial sequential analysis showed that we had enough
information to reject that remdesivir versus control reduces the risk of all-cause mortality with a
relative risk reduction of 20% (Fig 5). The subgroup analysis assessing the effects of the different

Hydroxychloroquine versus control interventions
We identified 13 trials randomizing 10,276 participants to hydroxychloroquine versus standard care
[34,35,42,48,54,55,58,59,105,110], or placebo [53,108]. All trials were assessed at high risk of bias
(S3 Table). One trial was not eligible for meta-analysis, as the results were not reported in a usable
way; i.e., the results were reported as per-protocol and several participants crossed over [42].

Meta-analysis of all-cause mortality
Fixed-effect meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between hydroxychloroquine versus
control on all-cause mortality (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.20; p = 0.08; I2 = 0%; 10 trials; moderate
certainty) (S17 Fig, S6 Table). Visual inspection of the forest plot and measures to quantify
heterogeneity (I2 = 0%) indicated no heterogeneity. The assessment time points varied from five
days after randomization [34,35] to 30 days after randomization [108]. The trial sequential analysis
showed that we had enough information to reject that hydroxychloroquine versus control reduces
the risk of all-cause mortality with a relative risk reduction of 20% (S18 Fig). The subgroup

interventions showed no significant subgroup differences (p = 0.30) (S43 Fig).

Meta-analysis of mechanical ventilation
Fixed-effect meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between azithromycin versus control
on mechanical ventilation (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.94; p = 0.83; I2 = 53%; two trials; very low
certainty) (S44 Fig, S10 Table). Visual inspection of the forest plot and measures to quantify
heterogeneity (I2 = 53%) indicated moderate heterogeneity. The time-point of assessment was 15
days after randomization in the first trial [54], and unclear in the second trial [82]. We have
contacted the trial authors and requested information on the assessment time-point, but we have not
received a response yet. The trial sequential analysis showed that we did not have enough
information to confirm or reject that azithromycin versus control reduces the risk of receiving
mechanical ventilation with a relative risk reduction of 20%. The subgroup analysis assessing the
effects of azithromycin versus different control interventions showed no significant subgroup
differences (p = 0.15) (S44 Fig).

Meta-analysis of non-serious adverse events
Fixed-effect meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between azithromycin versus control
on non-serious adverse events (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.34; p = 0.38; I2 = 0%; two trials; very

different control interventions showed no significant subgroup differences (p = 0.71) (S45 Fig)

Colchicine versus control
We identified three trials randomizing 248 participants to colchicine versus standard care [49],
placebo plus standard care [92], or placebo plus hydroxychloroquine [107]. In the latter trial, the
colchicine group also received hydroxychloroquine as a co-intervention [107]. All trials were
assessed as at high risk of bias (S3 Table).

Meta-analysis of all-cause mortality
Fixed-effect meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between colchicine versus control
on all-cause mortality (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.07 to 16.01; p = 0.98; I2 = 0%; two trials; very low
certainty) (S47 Fig, S11 Table). Visual inspection of the forest plot and measures to quantify
heterogeneity (I2 = 0%) indicated no heterogeneity. The time-point of assessment was unclear in
both trials [92,107]. We have contacted the trial authors and requested information on the
assessment time-points, but we have not received a response yet. The trial sequential analysis
showed that we did not have enough information to confirm or reject that colchicine versus control
reduces the risk of all-cause mortality with a relative risk reduction of 20%. The subgroup analysis
assessing the effects of colchicine versus different control interventions showed no evidence of a

differences (p = 0.01) (S48 Fig)

Intravenous immunoglobin versus control
We identified two trials randomizing 93 participants to intravenous immunoglobulin versus
standard care [57] or placebo [95]. Both trials included immunoglobulin from healthy donors
[57,95]. Both trials were assessed at high risk of bias (S3 Table).

Meta-analysis of serious adverse events
Fixed-effect meta-analysis showed evidence of a beneficial effect of intravenous immunoglobulin
versus control on serious adverse events (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.87; p = 0.02; I2 = 0%; two
trials; very low certainty) (S51 Fig, S12 Table). This data is solely based on all-cause mortality
data according to the ICH-GCP guidelines [15], since no other serious adverse events were
reported. Visual inspection of the forest plot and measures to quantify heterogeneity (I2 = 0%)
indicated no heterogeneity. The outcome was assessed only in hospital in the first trial [95] and up

Tocilizumab versus control
We identified six trials randomizing 1038 patients to tocilizumab versus standard care [93,111113], placebo with standard care [90] or favipiravir alone as co-intervention [114]. All trials were
assessed as at high risk of bias (S3 Table).

We identified two trials randomizing 96 participants to bromhexidine versus standard care [94,104].
Both trials were assessed at high risk of bias (S3 Table).

Remaining trial data
Because of lack of relevant data, it was not possible to conduct other meta-analyses, individual
patient data meta-analyses, or network meta-analysis. Nine single trials showed statistically
significant results but were all underpowered to confirm or reject realistic intervention effects.

One trial randomizing 402 participants compared five versus ten days of remdesivir and showed
evidence of a beneficial effect of five days of remdesivir on serious adverse events (p = 0.003
(Fisher’s exact test)) [37]. One trial randomizing 92 participants compared the immunomodulator
interferon β-1a added to standard care versus standard care alone and showed evidence of a
beneficial effect of interferon β-1a on all-cause mortality (p = 0.029) [36]. This trial also showed
evidence of a harmful effect of interferon β-1a on non-serious adverse events (p = 0.006) [36]. One
single trial randomizing 81 participants compared high-dosage versus low-dosage chloroquine
diphosphate and showed evidence of a beneficial effect of low-dosage chloroquine on all-cause
mortality (p = 0.024) [50]. One single three group trial randomizing 667 participants to
hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin versus standard care and showed evidence of a
harmful effect of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin on adverse events not considered serious
(p = 0.015) [54]. One single trial randomizing 76 participants compared calcifediol versus standard
care and showed evidence of a beneficial effect of calcifediol on admittance to intensive care (p =
0.0001) [84]. One single trial randomizing 200 participants compared recombinant human
granulocyte colony–stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) versus standard care and showed evidence of a

beneficial effect of rhG-CSF on all-cause mortality (p = 0.017), and receipt of mechanical
ventilation (p = 0.003) [85]. This trial also showed evidence of a harmful effect of rhG-CSF on nonserious adverse events (p = 0.0001) [85]. One single trial randomizing 84 participants compared
electrolyzed saline versus standard care and showed evidence of a beneficial effect of electrolyzed
saline on all-cause mortality (p = 0.019) [100]. One single trial randomizing 78 participants
compared bromhexidine hydrochloride versus standard care and showed evidence of a beneficial
effect of bromhexidine hydrochloride on admittance to intensive care (p = 0.013) and receipt of
mechanical ventilation (p = 0.014) [104]. One single trial randomizing 100 participants compared
hydroxychloroquine combined with arbidol versus hydroxychloroquine combined with lopinavirritonavir and showed evidence of a beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine combined with arbidol
on admission to intensive care (p = 0.0001) [109].

None of the remaining single trial results showed evidence of a difference on our predefined review
outcomes. Two trials did not report the results in a usable way; one trial reported results of the
experimental group with a proportion of participants being non-randomized [56], and the second
trial reported the results as per-protocol, and there was participant crossover [42]. Seven trials did
not report on our review outcomes [44,62,63,67,71,96,101]. We have contacted all corresponding
authors, but we have not been able to obtain outcomes for our analyses from the trialists yet. Most
trials were assessed at high risk of bias (S3 Table). Characteristics of the trials and their results on
the review outcomes can be found in S2 Table. Certainty of the evidence was assessed as ‘low’ or
‘very low’ for all outcomes (S15-S66 Table).

Possible future contributions of ongoing trials
On November 2, 2020, a search on the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register revealed 2527
registered randomized clinical trials [13]. From these, 106 different interventions for treatment of
COVID-19 patients were identified [13]. The ten most investigated experimental interventions were
hydroxychloroquine (162 trials), convalescent plasma (55 trials), azithromycin (52 trials), lopinavir
and ritonavir (40 trials), tocilizumab (33 trials), chloroquine (30 trials), favipiravir (24 trials),
remdesivir (15 trials), sarilumab (15 trials), and dexamethasone (13 trials). Eligible trials will
continuously be included in the present living systematic review once results become available.

Discussion
We conducted the second edition of our living systematic review assessing the beneficial and
harmful effects of any intervention for COVID-19. We searched relevant databases and websites for
published and unpublished trials until November 2, 2020. We included a total of 82 trials
randomizing 40,249 participants. Our study showed that no evidence-based treatment for COVID19 currently exists.

Very low certainty evidence indicated that corticosteroids might reduce the risk of death, serious
adverse events, and mechanical ventilation.

Moderate certainty evidence showed that we could reject that remdesivir reduces the risk of death
by 20%. Very low certainty evidence indicated that remdesivir might reduce the risk of serious
adverse events.

Very low certainty evidence indicated that intraveneous immunoglobin might reduce the risk of
death and serious adverse events, that tocilizumab might reduce the risk of serious adverse events
and mechanical ventilation, and that bromhexidine might reduce the risk of non-serious adverse
events.

Moderate certainty evidence showed that we could reject that hydroxychloroquine reduces the risk
of death and serious adverse events by 20%, and that we could reject that lopinavir-ritonavir
reduces the risk of death, serious adverse events, and risk of mechanical ventilation by 20%.

Otherwise, we could neither confirm nor reject the effects of other interventions for COVID-19.
More trials with low risks of bias and random errors are urgently needed. For several interventions
we found a large number of currently ongoing trials.

The present review concludes that no evidence-based treatment currently exists for COVID-19.
Previous studies [118-120] including our first edition of the present review [120] have concluded
that both corticosteroids and remdesivir showed promising results. Since our last edition, we have
included more trials, and we therefore have more information, causing this difference, but there are
other reasons for these contrary conclusions. One previous systematic review published in JAMA
assessed the association between corticosteroids and 28-day all-cause mortality and concluded that
corticosteroids are effective for treating critically ill patients with COVID-19 in reducing all-cause
mortality [118]. This review assessed the certainty of evidence for all-cause mortality to be
moderate, while we assessed the certainty of evidence to be very low.

Our present results showed a discrepancy between the random-effects meta-analysis result and the
fixed-effect meta-analysis result (due to heterogeneity) of corticosteroids versus control
interventions when assessing all-cause mortality, i.e., the fixed-effect meta-analysis indicated a
more beneficial effect of corticosteroids. Due to the discrepancy between the random-effects and
the fixed-effect model we believe that these results should be interpreted with great caution
considering the uncertainty of the evidence. Furthermore, the meta-analytic effect estimate was 0.89
which may be considered relatively small.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved remdesivir for use in adult and
pediatric patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization
[121]. Based on the current evidence, we conclude that remdesivir is not effective in reducing allcause mortality, neither for patients not requiring oxygen nor for patients requiring oxygen or
respiratory support at baseline. There was a discrepancy between the random-effects and the fixedeffect meta-analysis (due to heterogeneity) of remdesivir versus control on serious adverse events,
i.e., the fixed-effect meta-analysis indicated a more beneficial effect of remdesivir. Due to the
discrepancy between the random-effects and the fixed-effect model we believe that these results
should be interpreted with great caution considering the uncertainty of the evidence. On all other
outcomes when assessing the effects of remdesivir, we conclude that more information is needed to
confirm or reject the effects of remdesivir. Hence, the clinical effects of remdesivir are unclear
based on current evidence.

Our results are similar to the results of a preprint of an international collaborative meta-analysis of
randomized clinical trials assessing mortality outcomes with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine
for participants with COVID-19 [122]. This review included some unpublished data [122]. We have

contacted the trialists of the trials that provided unpublished data for this review, but we have not
received any data yet. Nevertheless, our conclusions that hydroxychloroquine does not reduce
mortality in COVID-19 patients are the same [122].

Although we could exclude an intervention effect at 20% or above for most of our interventions
with our trial sequential analyses, we did not assess smaller and still worthwhile intervention
effects. If patients and investigators feel that such smaller intervention effects are worth pursuing,
then we recommend the conduct of trials with much larger sample sizes than the ones we have
identified in the present systematic review. That will require more national and international
collaboration [123].

Our living systematic review has a number of strengths. The predefined methodology was based on
the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [11], the eight-step assessment
suggested by Jakobsen et al. [17], and trial sequential analysis [22]. Hence, this review considers
both risks of systematic errors and risk of random errors. Another strength is the living systematic
review design, which allows us to continuously surveil and update the evidence-base of existing
interventions for treatment of COVID-19 resulting in a decreased timespan from publication of our
results to optimization of clinical practice. This is particularly important in this international healthcare crisis, where a large number of new randomized clinical trials are continuously registered and
published.

Our living systematic review also has limitations. First, the primary limitation is the paucity of trials
currently available, and the results from most current meta-analyses are of low or very low
certainty. This must be considered when interpreting our meta-analysis results. Second, the trials

that we included were all at risks of systematic errors so our results presumably overestimate the
beneficial effects and underestimate the harmful effects of the included interventions [124-131].
Third, it was not relevant to perform individual patient data meta-analyses, network-meta-analysis,
or several of the planned subgroup analyses due to lack of relevant data. We contacted all trial
authors requesting individual patient data, but until now we only received five datasets
[38,69,79,80,107]. We did not perform network meta-analysis because the ranking of the
interventions is not unclear, i.e., no evidence-based intervention currently exits for COVID-19.
Fourth, we included ’time to clinical improvement’ as an outcome post hoc. We did not initially
plan to assess ‘time to clinical improvement’ [8] because this outcome is poorly defined and if
outcome assessors are not adequately blinded, assessments of ‘improvement’ may be biased.
Furthermore, time to clinical improvement is not one of the most patient-important outcomes. As an
example, most patients would rather survive without complications than recover a few days sooner.
Fifth, the included trials assessed the outcomes at different time points, which might contribute to
increased heterogeneity. Sixth, some data are included from preprints, and these might be subject to
change following peer-review. Therefore, some results, bias risk assessments, and GRADE
summaries might change in later editions of this living systematic review following inclusion of the
published peer-reviewed manuscripts.

We have identified two important reviews that are comparable to our present project [119,132]. The
first is a network meta-analysis published in BMJ [119]. However, this review only includes drug
treatments for COVID-19, does not include individual patient data meta-analyses, and does not use
trial sequential analysis or similar methods to handle problems with multiplicity (repeating updating
of meta-analysis, multiple comparisons due to inclusion of multiple interventions, assessing

The second project is a living mapping of ongoing randomized clinical trials with network metaanalysis on all interventions for COVID-19 [132]. The authors are producing and disseminating
preliminary results through an open platform [132]. This review includes both prevention and
treatment and does not use trial sequential analysis or similar methods to handle problems with
multiplicity (repeating updating of meta-analysis, multiple comparisons due to inclusion of multiple
interventions, assessing multiple outcomes) [8].

Conclusions
No evidence-based treatment for COVID-19 currently exists. Very low certainty evidence indicates
that corticosteroids might reduce the risk of death, serious adverse events, and mechanical
ventilation; that remdesivir might reduce the risk of serious adverse events; that intraveneous
immunoglobin might reduce the risk of death and serious adverse events; that tocilizumab might
reduce the risk of serious adverse events and mechanical ventilation, and that bromhexidine might
reduce the risk of non-serious adverse events. More trials with low risks of bias and random errors
are urgently needed. This review will continuously inform best practice in treatment and clinical
research of COVID-19.

Differences between the protocol and the review
We erroneously reported the adjusted TSA alpha as 2% in our published protocol [8]. This has now
been corrected to 3.3% according to two primary outcomes [17]. Further, we included ‘time to
clinical improvement’ as an outcome post hoc.
