Abstract (250 words)

2

Background: COVID-19 has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality

3

worldwide. Lateral flow assays can detect anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

4

Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies to monitor transmission. However,

5

standardized evaluation of their accuracy and tools to aid in interpreting results are

6

needed.

7

Methods: We evaluated 20 IgG and IgM assays selected from available tests

8

in April 2020. We evaluated the assays’ performance using 56 pre-pandemic negative

9

and 56 SARS-CoV-2-positive plasma samples, collected 10-40 days after symptom

10

onset, confirmed by a molecular test and analyzed by an ultra-sensitive immunoassay.

11

Finally, we developed a user-friendly web app to extrapolate the positive predictive

12

values based on their accuracy and local prevalence.

13

Results: Combined IgG+IgM sensitivities ranged from 33.9% to 94.6%, while

14

combined specificities ranged from 92.6% to 100%. The highest sensitivities were

15

detected in Lumiquick for IgG (98.2%), BioHit for both IgM (96.4%), and combined

16

IgG+IgM sensitivity (94.6%). Furthermore, 11 LFAs and 8 LFAs showed perfect

17

specificity for IgG and IgM, respectively, with 15 LFAs showing perfect combined

18

IgG+IgM specificity. Lumiquick had the lowest estimated limit-of-detection (LOD) (0.1

19

µg/mL), followed by a similar LOD of 1.5 µg/mL for CareHealth, Cellex, KHB, and

20

Vivachek.

21

Conclusion: We provide a public resource of the accuracy of select lateral flow

22

assays with potential for home testing. The cost-effectiveness, scalable manufacturing

23

process, and suitability for self-testing makes LFAs an attractive option for monitoring

24

disease prevalence and assessing vaccine responsiveness. Our web tool provides an

Introduction

30

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with the severe

31

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a global

32

pandemic on March 11th, 20201. A second wave of the pandemic is well underway1, 2,

33

3, 4.

34

immunosurveillance tools to measure SARS-CoV-2 infection in diverse community

35

settings. Among SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, 40-45% are estimated to remain

36

asymptomatic5, suggesting that prevalence is likely underestimated6. Therefore,

37

detecting prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 as opposed to other viruses, including other

38

coronaviruses is crucial7.

However, accurate estimates of transmission rely on accurate and widely available

39

There are different types of clinical SARS-CoV-2 tests8. Diagnostic testing

40

relies on reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and

41

antigen-based immunodiagnostics to detect active infection9,

42

serological tests can monitor population prevalence and prior exposure by measuring

43

antibodies against SARS-CoV-212, 13, 14. These include enzyme-linked immunosorbent

44

assays (ELISAs), chemiluminescence assays, and lateral flow assays (LFAs)11, 15, 16.

45

LFAs are attractive for home testing and population surveillance, since they are

46

affordable, scalable, rely on easily accessible specimens such as fingerstick whole

47

blood and give a result readout within minutes13. Since multiple vaccines received

48

emergency use authorization17, LFAs could be used to determine whether vaccines

49

elicit a detectable and durable immune response18,

50

seroconversion was shown to predict better clinical outcomes23, 24. Hence, easy-to-

51

use LFAs will have important applications in the upcoming phases of the pandemic.

52

Since the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic, multiple studies evaluated the accuracy of

Many of these tests received Emergency Use

55

Despite the utility of SARS-CoV2 antibody tests, misinterpretation of results is

56

very likely31. A negative serological test result does not preclude prior infection since

57

seroconversion occurs 9-11 days after symptoms onset for IgM and 18-20 days for

58

IgG antibodies, respectively16,

59

active infection31. Furthermore, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is highly variable

60

and known to directly impact the predictive value of a test result. A higher prevalence

61

increases the likelihood that positive test results indicate a real infection (i.e. higher

62

positive predictive value)35, but will also decrease the negative predictive value,

63

resulting in more false negative results35. Therefore, accessible tools to assist the

64

public with interpreting results based on test accuracy and different prevalence

65

scenarios are critical31, 36.

In April 2020, the Mass General Brigham Center (MGB) for COVID Innovation’s

67

direct-to-consumer working group scanned available serological assays and selected

68

20 lateral flow assays, based on reported assay characteristics and supply chain

69

availability37. The LFAs were evaluated by blinded operators using the same samples

70

to standardize the evaluation of their accuracy. Additionally, we developed a user-

71

friendly web-tool to provide context for the end user to interpret their results. Here, we

72

report the evaluation data to serve as a public resource to guide implementation of

73

LFAs, and the tool to aid the interpretation of home testing results.

Methods

76

Sample procurement

77

We procured 56 SARS-CoV-2 positive, 46 pre-pandemic negative, and 10 HIV+ EDTA

78

plasma samples. SARS-CoV-2 positive EDTA plasma samples were obtained from

79

clinical discards banked within 24-72 hours of collection at the Crimson Core of the

80

MGB Biobank from hospitalized symptomatic patients. All samples had positive

81

SARS-CoV-2 PCR results using an EUA approved test at the Brigham and Women’s

82

Hospital (Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay, Hologic, Inc., San Diego, CA or Xpert

83

Xpress SARS-CoV-2, Cepheid, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) or the Clinical Research

84

Sequencing Platform at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard (in house Laboratory

85

Developed Test) 10-40 days prior to sample collection. The participants’ charts were

86

reviewed by study staff to identify samples collected ≥10 days after onset of symptoms

87

and to exclude immunosuppressed participants, after which samples were

88

anonymized and stripped of protected health information. Pre-pandemic negative

89

control samples were randomly selected from healthy participants with a Charlson

90

Age-Comorbidity Index38 score ≤2, with EDTA plasma banked in the MGB Biobank

91

between Jan 1-Dec 1, 2019 from inpatients. HIV-positive control samples were

92

obtained from EDTA plasma samples banked prior to January 2020 in a study on

93

neuropathic pain in HIV. All HIV-positive participants were on antiretroviral therapy.

94

For 8 out of the 10 HIV-positive samples, viral load quantification was available and

95

showed 256 copies/ml or less, and 5 showed either undetectable loads or under 20

96

copies/ml. The study was approved under the Massachusetts General Brigham (MGB)

97

Institutional Review Board (protocol no. 2020P001204).

98

Lateral Flow Assays (LFAs)

99

Twenty commercial IgG/IgM lateral flow assays (LFAs) from 18 manufacturers were

100

evaluated (Supplementary Table 1). LFAs were analyzed by blinded operators

101

according to manufacturer instructions for use (IFU), with the exception of using

102

micropipettes instead of manufacturer-provided droppers to minimize technical

103

variability. Samples were thawed on ice, randomized, and brought to room

104

temperature. Kit components were also brought to room temperature. The IFU-

105

specified volumes of sample and buffer were added to the cassette. Specified sample

106

volumes varied for different LFAs but were typically in the 5-20µL range. The cassettes

107

were run at room temperature on a flat surface and results read immediately after the

108

time interval defined in the IFU (typically ranging from 10-15 minutes). Each cassette

109

was independently scored by two blinded raters as either “positive,” “negative,” or

110

“invalid”. Ratings were designated according to the interpretation guidelines outlined

111

in each individual IFU. Each cassette was photographed under four standardized

112

illumination conditions and viewpoints for future analysis.

113
114

Reproducibility testing

115

For inter-operator reproducibility analysis, separate pools of EDTA plasma were

116

obtained from >30 pre-pandemic healthy individuals (negative pool) and >30

117

convalescent participants collected after symptom resolution at the Massachusetts

118

General Hospital (MGH) respiratory illness clinic (positive pool). Convalescent

119

samples for the positive pool were confirmed to be positive using the COBAS SARS-

120

CoV-2 PCR test (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) at MGH. A total of 20 replicates

121

per pool were run by two independent pairs of blinded operators, alternating between

122

positive and negative pools (10 replicates per pair). Reproducibility was calculated

123

according to agreement between operator ratings as well as concordance of readout

124

with sample pool COVID status.

125
126

Sensitivity and specificity testing

127

Our cohort of 112 EDTA plasma samples was used across all 20 LFAs to evaluate

128

performance: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative

129

predictive value (NPV). Samples were sub-aliquoted throughout the analysis to

130

minimize freeze-thaw cycles. Binary presence/absence were used, and discordant

131

calls were resolved by a third operator inspecting photographs taken of the relevant

132

LFA.

LFA usability

In addition to initial screening

136

based on complexity of kit materials, sample requirements, and IFU clarity. Supplied

137

kit components were documented for completeness and examined for ease-of-use.

138

IFU protocols were rated on a scale from 0-14 according to a predefined rubric

Results

156

Study Population

157

We obtained plasma samples from 56 pre-pandemic patients, including 10 HIV+, and

158

56 symptomatic patients in March and April 2020. HIV-negative samples were

159

matched for sex and age between the COVID- and COVID+ groups. The overall study

160

population included 25.9% Blacks, 4.5% Latinx, 9.8% Asian and 43.8% Non-Hispanic

161

Whites (Table 1). COVID+ samples were from individuals between 10-40 days post

162

symptom onset, with 60.7% samples taken between 2-4 weeks. Of all the COVID+

163

participants, 7 (12.5%) were symptomatic outpatients and 49 (87.5%) were

164

hospitalized. Among those hospitalized, 25 (51%) required intensive care unit (ICU)

165

treatment and 4 (8.2%) were deceased at the time of chart review (Table 2). Additional

166

mortalities were possible after chart review since some participants were in critical

167

condition in the ICU.

LFA Performance: Reproducibility

169

Four independent operators working in teams of two on separate days applied each

170

pool 10 times to each LFA, with processing as dictated by the instructions for use

171

(IFU). API version1 LFAs were not assessed for reproducibility due to limited cassette

172

availability and high sample volumes required. Of the remaining 19 LFAs, three

173

(BTNX, Camtech, and Carehealth) had 100% consistent correct outcomes across both

174

isotypes, with an additional three (BioHit, Zhuhai Livzon, and Phamatech) having no

175

incorrect or inconsistent outcomes with one or two invalid tests (Figure 1). IgG was

176

the more reproducible isotype. The majority of incorrect consistent calls came from

177

operators calling a COVID+ sample IgM negative (Figure 1).

178
179

LFA Performance: Practicalities of Use

180

We assessed the LFAs according to this rubric (Supplementary Table 2) by three

181

independent raters and assigned a composite score on a scale of 0-14

182

(Supplementary Table 3). Five LFAs (BioHit, InTec, Lumiquick, Phamatech, and

183

U2U) received full marks for IFU clarity. LFAs frequently lost points for imprecise

184

instructions regarding correct usage of disposable droppers as well as optimal time

185

between adding sample and reading the results. Important kit usability criteria, such

186

as whether the included pipette droppers show clear volume markings, were also

187

recorded (Supplementary Table 3). While these kits may not yet be intended for the

188

general public, it will be important to clarify the instructions moving forward and include

189

clearly marked droppers to minimize potential for sample volume errors.

191

LFA Performance: Sensitivity and Specificity

192

To focus on LFA specificity, given the likely use of these tests in low-prevalence

193

settings, disagreement between operators was interpreted as a negative call. Across

194

all but three of the LFAs (Biohit, BTNX, Vivacheck), sensitivity was higher for IgG than

195

IgM. Sensitivity for IgG ranged from 98.2% (Lumiquick) down to 72.7% (Oranoxis),

196

and for IgM from 96.4% (BioHit) to 23.2% (Oxo and U2U) (Table 3). LFA specificity

197

was much higher for both isotypes, with 11 LFAs having a specificity of 100% for IgG

198

(API, API v2, BTNX, Camtech, Genobio, Oranoxis, Phamatech, Ray Biotech, Ray

199

Biotech_v2, U2U and Zhuhai Livzon), and 8 LFAs having a specificity of 100% for IgM

200

(API, CareHealth, Cellex, Lumiquick, Oranoxis, Ray Biotech v2, U2U, Zhuhai Livzon)

201

(Table 3). Under the assumption that the likelihood of two randomly occurring false

202

positives for any one individual is low, an IgG/IgM composite score (averaged operator

203

scores, see Methods) was produced to maximize test specificity. Using this composite

204

score, all LFAs except BioHit, Cellex, Edinburgh, InTec and Vivachek achieved a

205

specificity of 100%. This result underscores the potential of considering the outcome

206

in both isotypes to minimize false positives, although it is more likely that a single

207

isotype will be used in clinical testing.

208
209

We created heatmaps to visualize individual sample outcomes across all LFAs

(Figure 2). False negatives (blue squares in the COVID+ panel) amongst COVID+

212

patients were somewhat reproducible, with three COVID+ samples called negative in

symptom onset) (Figure 2, bottom panel). To investigate whether these miscalls were

216

related to low titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from participants with a

217

suppressed immune response, all 112 samples were analyzed for anti-spike IgG and

218

IgM antibodies using a custom quantitative Simoa assay39. The three samples that

219

were called negative across almost all LFAs, which were collected 2-3 weeks after

220

symptoms onset, had the lowest levels of anti-spike antibodies in COVID+ samples

221

for both IgG and IgM, suggesting these participants had slower or suppressed immune

222

responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

223

Unlike false negatives, most false positives (Figure 2, red squares in COVID-

224

panel) amongst COVID- individuals appear largely uncorrelated between LFAs.

225

However, two samples showed IgG false positives across multiple LFAs, which may

226

suggest long lasting antibodies from exposure to coronaviruses other than SARS-

227

CoV-2. Nonetheless, this observation is not reflected in the antibody levels from the

228

Simoa analysis, which showed barely detectable anti-spike antibodies in these two

229

samples.

230
231

Defining the limit of detection for qualitative LFAs

232

The custom Simoa anti-spike IgG and IgM antibody assays use a standard curve to

233

determine standardized antibody concentration in each sample39. The results obtained

234

from this assay can therefore be used to estimate a limit of detection (LOD) for each

235

of the qualitative LFAs. The cumulative number of false negative LFA calls in COVID+

236

samples (Figure 3, y-axis) were computed as a function of decreasing antibody

237

concentrations (Figure 3, x-axis) separately for IgG and IgM. We define the LOD for

238

each LFA/antibody as the concentration at which ≥95% of the COVID+ samples are

239

called unambiguously positive (Supplementary table 4). Using this definition, for IgG,

240

all LFAs (except Genobio, Oranoxis, OZO, Ray Biotech, and U2U) have an LOD within

241

the linear range of the SIMOA assay (1 - 10,000 µg/mL). Lumiquick has the lowest

242

LOD at 0.1 µg/mL, which was extrapolated by dilution to be within the linear range of

243

the Simoa standards, and CareHealth, Cellex, KHB and Vivachek all have an LOD of

244

1.5 µg/mL (Supplementary table 4). Considering the generally lower sensitivity

245

observed with the IgM assays (Figure 2), IgM assays consistently have higher LODs,

246

with 9 exceeding 1,000 µg/mL. BioHit has the lowest IgM LOD at 0.6 µg/mL, and API

247

version2, BTNX, CareHealth and Vivachek all have LODs under 10 µg/mL.

248
249

Interpreting test positivity with low prevalence in the general population

250

Low prevalence places a high burden on specificity35. Given the high proportion of true

251

negative individuals in the population being studied, prevalence increases the ratio of

252

false positive to true positive test outcomes41. Positive predictive values (PPV)

253

correspond to the likelihood that a positive test result reflect true positivity as measured

254

by a gold standard PCR result. We computed PPVs as a function of the cumulative

255

fraction of the population infected with (and assumed to have produced antibodies to)

256

SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 4). Here we see that even with the conservative interpretation

257

of LFA outcome (requiring the majority of operators to see a band to call a sample

258

positive for either IgG or IgM), when the population seroprevalence is ~5% the PPV

259

for these assays spans a large range (from ~30% to 100%). As the population

260

prevalence increases, the burden on specificity is decreased, and at 50% prevalence

261

the PPV of all LFAs is above 87.5%. Posterior PPV can be improved for most LFAs

262

by requiring both IgG and IgM to be read as positive in order to count an individual as

263

positive (Figure 4, right panels).

264

To visualize the effect of changing population prevalence on the PPV, we

265

created an interactive webapp (https://covid.omics.kitchen; Figure 5), which allows

266

the user to extrapolate the likelihood that they do in fact have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

267

if they have a positive LFA result, given the infection prevalence and test accuracy.

268

The app includes benchmark performance of all 20 LFAs evaluated here, as well as

269

those reported in Whitman et al16 (filtered to remove samples taken under 10 days

270

post symptom-onset). In an effort to further generalize the utility of this tool, we allow

271

the user to explore the effects of assay performance under difference prevalence

272

scenarios, and to input the reported prevalence data from specific geographic

273

locations within the US1, based on national, state, and county records.

Discussion

276

In this study, we report a standardized cross-evaluation of LFAs on the same

277

pre-pandemic SARS-CoV-2-negative and PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive

278

samples, and rate their reproducibility, usability, and performance characteristics.

279

Overall, the LFAs showed a higher propensity for false negative than false positive

280

readings. Results are public: https://covidinnovation.partners.org/evaluation/. We use

281

the Simoa technology39 to measure the concentrations of anti-spike protein IgG and

282

IgM antibodies and extrapolate the assays’ limits of detection. We also established a

283

web tool to aid users in understanding the likelihood they have anti-SARS-CoV-2

284

antibodies given a positive test result. This resource of performance characteristics of

285

several LFAs and a tool for result interpretation, can both be used for

286

immunosurveillance and future home testing applications.

287

LFAs are tractable tools to estimate community seroprevalence, especially with

288

anticipated seasonal fluctuations in the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and

289

other viruses that cause the common cold, which confound the symptomatologic

290

diagnosis of COVID-1942. As new waves of the COVID-19 pandemic resurge around

291

the globe1, and with commencing vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 infections18, 19, 20,

292

293

antibodies28, 43. Affordable LFAs offer an attractive option for monitoring the presence

294

and longevity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and determining population-level herd

295

immunity44. LFAs also obviate the need for complex laboratories to process the

296

samples45. As the pandemic expands to previously unexposed communities, it is

297

critical to use simple tools to monitor exposure dynamics and seroconversion in SARS-

298

CoV-2-exposed individuals, as well as vaccine-induced immunity22. We tested a

299

mixture of LFAs targeting SARS-CoV2 nucleocapsid, spike proteins, or both.

300

Moderna’s mRNA-1273 and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines encode SARS-

301

CoV2 spike proteins to induce anti-spike antibodies20, 46. Therefore, LFAs targeting the

302

spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV2 could be used to differentiate vaccine-

303

and infection-induced antibody responses, respectively.

304

there is a renewed interest in serological tests to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2

309

Unfortunately, the rush to market introduced many tests that did not meet typical US

310

or international standards47. Therefore, the FDA and international regulatory agencies

311

continue to update guidelines for authorization of new serological tests. Our evaluation

312

plan mirrored the FDA guidelines for evaluating serological tests30. We included 10

313

HIV-positive samples to test whether they have higher false positive results in SARS-

314

CoV2-negative samples48, and did not detect higher false positive results.

315

The mere detection of IgG or IgM responses does not guarantee that

316

neutralizing antibodies are present at protective titers

317

suggest a slight over-representation of African Americans among cases, as reported50.

318

However, the sample size was underpowered to formally determine the effect of race

319

on test performance. In our analysis, IgM detectability was less sensitive and

320

reproducible than IgGs across multiple LFAs, possibly due to both lower IgM titres,

321

and lower limits of detection for the assays. Waning antibody responses have been

322

reported in some SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals51, 52, 53, 54. Furthermore, reported

323

cases of re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 suggest that prior exposure, and even

324

seroconversion, do not universally protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection54, 55, 56. This

325

could result from low antibody titers as shown in an immunocompromised patient57,

326

low durability of infection-induced antibodies52, 53, 54, or low neutralizing potential of

327

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in some individuals44. IgG and IgM antibodies may also target

328

irrelevant epitopes outside the spike and receptor binding domains, and consequently

329

be less efficient at intercepting infection by the virus58. The WHO cautions against

330

interpreting presence of antibodies, even neutralizing ones, as lower risk of re-

331

infection and transmission59. The presence of antibodies could, however, be used for

15

13, 49.

332

rapid immunosurveillance to monitor extent of population transmission, particularly in

333

asymptomatic but SARS-CoV2-exposed individuals6, 43.

334

One major concern about the deployment of these tests is the misinterpretation

335

of positive results13, 49. As more tests move towards FDA clearance for home use,

336

clear scientific communication about the result interpretation becomes more crucial31,

337

49.

338

Although combined use of molecular and seroconversion results can be used to

339

confirm the diagnosis of symptomatic and hospitalized individuals45, a positive

340

serological test in the absence of symptoms dissociates the presence of the antibodies

341

from the time of infection54. Additionally, it is important to understand the implication

342

of false positive and false negative results, particularly in the context of a low-

343

prevalence disease such as COVID-1935. Low prevalence decreases the negative

344

predictive value of a test, but increases the rate of false positives35. A false positive

345

serological test result may prematurely instill confidence that one has immunity against

346

SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus resulting in behavioral changes that increase risk of

347

transmission61. Hence, the probability that a person without antibodies will test

348

negative on a serological test is more important than test sensitivity59, 60, 61.

A positive serological result does not necessarily mean active infection31,

41, 60.

349

Our study presents a few limitations. Although we successfully benchmarked the

350

performance of the LFAs to a quantitative assay39, we did not determine the

351

neutralizing potential of these antibodies. Secondly, samples were acquired when

352

PCR testing was restricted to severely ill patients. For epidemiological studies and

353

population surveillance, it will be important to evaluate assay performance on

354

asymptomatic individuals.

Supplementary Methods:
Analysis
Computational analyses were performed in R/markdown. LFA evaluation reports are
available

(http://publicdata.omics.kitchen/Projects/MGBCCI/LFA/VendorReports/).

Formulae for computing performance metrics and confidence intervals are provided
below. IgG/IgM bands were called via visual inspection by two experienced human
operators. Invalid LFAs (e.g. missing a control band) were excluded entirely from further
analysis and the sample was not re-run.

A score was computed for each sample/assay/antibody combination, using the following
algorithm:
-

Each of N operators reading the LFA were assigned a weight of 1/N to final score

-

If an operator observed a band, the score would increase by 1/N. If the operator
saw no band, the score would decrease by 1/N

This process was performed separately for the IgG and IgM channels, with an overall
score produced for each antibody. This per-sample/per-antibody score thus has the
following values: -1 (all operators agree: no band), 0 (operators disagree), and +1 (all
operators agree: band observed). Given that COVID-19 remains, even in late 2020, a
low-prevalence disease, we apply a conservative case definition (score ≥0), where
discordant operator readings (score=0) are classed as negative for presence of the

antibody, in order to favor specificity. A combined IgG and IgM score was computed as
the average of the two individual scores: (IgG+IgM)/2.

Reproducibility analysis used the same scoring system above. Tests of the COVID+ pool
that received a score >0 were called “correct”. COVID- tests were ones that received a
score <0. A score of 1 or -1 was called “consistent”, with all other scores indicating
disagreement between operators called as “inconsistent.” These two classifications were
concatenated to produce the outcomes “correct consistent”, where both operators agreed
on the correct outcome, “incorrect consistent,” where both operators agreed on the
incorrect outcome, and “inconsistent,” where operators disagreed on the outcome. The
outcome of each individual test was plotted as a proportion of total tests of each pool on
each of the two days of testing.

Webapp
We developed an interactive web-application (https://covid.omics.kitchen) to help
visualize false positive and false negative LFA readings based on test accuracy and
disease prevalence. We incorporate data from the 20 LFAs reported here as well as the
6 LFAs evaluated by Whitman, et al16. County, State, and US-wide disease rates
(cumulative numbers of individuals confirmed to have been infected since the start of the
outbreak) are pulled dynamically from the New York Times github repository
(https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data). The webapp is implemented in d3.js
JavaScript and hosted on Amazon Web Services AWS/Amplify.
