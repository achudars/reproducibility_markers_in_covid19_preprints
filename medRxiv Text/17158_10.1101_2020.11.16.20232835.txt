ABSTRACT

34

The rapid rise of coronavirus disease 2019 patients who suffer from vascular events after their initial

35

recovery is expected to lead to a worldwide shift in disease burden. We aim to investigate the impact of

36

COVID-19 on the pathophysiological state of blood vessels in convalescent patients. Here, convalescent

37

COVID-19 patients with or without preexisting conditions (i.e. hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia) were

38

compared to non-COVID-19 patients with matched cardiovascular risk factors or healthy participants.

39

Convalescent patients had elevated circulating endothelial cells (CECs), and those with underlying

40

cardiovascular risk had more pronounced endothelial activation hallmarks (ICAM1, P-selectin or CX3CL1)

41

expressed by CECs. Multiplex microbead-based immunoassays revealed some levels of cytokine

42

production sustained from acute infection to recovery phase. Several proinflammatory and activated T

43

lymphocyte-associated cytokines correlated positively with CEC measures, implicating cytokine-driven

44

endothelial dysfunction. Finally, the activation markers detected on CECs mapped to the counter receptors

45

(i.e. ITGAL, SELPLG, and CX3CR1) found primarily on CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells, suggesting

46

that activated endothelial cells could be targeted by cytotoxic effector cells. Clinical trials in preventive

47

therapy for post-COVID-19 vascular complications may be needed.

INTRODUCTION

54

As of 11 October 2020, there have been more than 37 million confirmed cases and 1 million deaths

55

from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While many countries are still in their first wave of infection,

56

some countries are now facing a second or third wave of resurgence upon reopening their economy,

57

prompting new lockdown. Intensive ongoing research has shed light on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and

58

the extent of damages caused directly or indirectly by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

59

(SARS-CoV-2). Conversely, the intermediate and long-term complications of COVID-19 remains unclear

60

(Del Rio, Collins et al., 2020). While most infected people recover completely within a few weeks, a

61

considerable proportion continue to experience symptoms after their initial recovery (Yelin, Wirtheim et al.,

62

2020) similar to SARS survivors (Ngai, Ko et al., 2010).

63
64

COVID-19 is mainly a respiratory infection. However, both autopsy findings and clinical observations have

65

described vascular damages and thrombotic complications in a wide range of organs (Gupta, Madhavan et

66

al., 2020) (Price, McCabe et al., 2020). Acute pulmonary edema was observed in severe COVID-19 patients

67

with occlusion and thrombosis of pulmonary microvasculatures (Xu, Shi et al., 2020). A study of renal

68

tissues found no vasculitis, hemorrhage or interstitial inflammation, but revealed endothelial activation and

69

even frank necrosis (Su, Yang et al., 2020). The multi-organ impact of COVID-19 may increase the risk of

70

long-term complications after recovery.

71
72

Importantly, systemic presence of the SARS-CoV-2 entry factor, angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)

73

on the surface of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and pericytes suggests that the virus, once present

74

in the circulation, may disseminate beyond the respiratory tract via the cardiovascular system (Hamming,

75

Timens et al., 2004, Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber et al., 2020). While SARS-CoV is mainly a respiratory tract

76

disease, the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for vascular endothelial cells can be plausibly explained by the ability

77

of SARS-CoV2 to use multiple viral entry-associated proteins expressed at various level in the vascular bed

78

(Wazny, Siau et al., 2020). Underlying a viral-induced vascular dysfunction, multisystem inflammatory

79

syndrome and chilblains reported in children and young adults are caused by inflammation of blood vessel

walls and characterized by immune cell infiltration and thrombotic events (Colmenero, Santonja et al., 2020,

81

Dolhnikoff, Ferreira Ferranti et al., 2020). Similarly, autopsy of COVID-19 patients’ tissues revealed

82

evidence of endothelium damage resulting of direct viral infection together with extensive thrombosis,

83

microangiopathy and T cell infiltration (Ackermann, Verleden et al., 2020, Varga, Flammer et al., 2020).

84

Endothelialitis occurs in different organs as a consequence of viral infection and overactive host immune

85

response.

86
87

Systematic evaluation of the long-term sequelae of COVID-19 is currently lacking. COVID-19 infection can

88

cause extrapulmonary pathologies that persist after recovery such as cardiovascular events with ongoing

89

myocardial inflammation (Puntmann, Carerj et al., 2020) acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (Mao, Jin et

90

al., 2020) as well as liver injury, neurological deficits, and acute kidney injury necessitating dialysis (Gupta

91

et al., 2020). The thrombotic complications of COVID-19, such as pulmonary embolism may lead to lasting

92

organ failure (Price et al., 2020). Independent of acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe pneumonia

93

has been consistently associated with augmented risk of cardiac impairment both during convalescence

94

and in later years (Corrales-Medina, Alvarez et al., 2015). We hypothesize that the risk of vascular

95

complications in COVID-19 survivors will be higher, if compounded by a confluence of SARS-CoV-2-

96

mediated damages, pro-inflammatory cytokine overdrive and comorbidities with hypertension and diabetes.

97
98

Circulating endothelial cells (CECs), dislodged from blood vessels as a consequence of vascular injury,

99

constitute an ideal cell-based biomarker as it is indicative of in situ endothelial pathophysiology (Farinacci,

100

Krahn et al., 2019, Hill, Zalos et al., 2003). Although CECs are a rare population in peripheral blood, they

101

reflect endothelial dysfunction from a variety of vascular disorders including myocardial infarction, acute

102

ischemic stroke, atherosclerosis and vasculitis (Nadar, Lip et al., 2005, Schmidt, Manca et al., 2015). In

103

COVID-19, there are conflicting reports as to the frequency of CEC counts compared with healthy controls

104

(Mancuso, Gidaro et al., 2020, Nizzoli, Merati et al., 2020). This discrepancy may reflect disease severity

105

as COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) have a higher CEC count, suggesting more

106

pronounced endothelial injury in severe COVID-19 (Guervilly, Burtey et al., 2020). Interestingly, among

107

non-ICU patients, those with chronic kidney disease had significantly higher CEC counts, implying that

108

patients with pre-existing conditions may be more susceptible to vascular damage (Guervilly et al., 2020).

109

This study aims to understand the state of vascular health in convalescent COVID-19 patients, and to

110

evaluate subclinical endothelial dysfunction through the phenotyping of CECs.

P ATIENT AND HEALTHY PARTICIPANTS CHARACTERIZATION

114

To understand the intermediate consequence of COVID-19, we performed vascular phenotyping

115

using CECs and endothelial activation markers as the cellular and molecular measures of endothelial

116

dysfunction. Written informed consent was received from participants prior to inclusion in the PROTECT

117

study (Young, Fong et al., 2020a, Young, Ong et al., 2020c). All study groups were almost gender-balanced,

118

with prior comorbidities and self-identified ethnicity/race summarized in Table 1. Convalescent COVID-19

119

patients who had no pneumonia throughout admission (mild); pneumonia without hypoxia (moderate) or

120

pneumonia with hypoxia (desaturation to ≤94%) requiring supplemental oxygen (severe), and discharged

121

for 15 days [median (interquartile range, IQR 11-26)] were screened for pre-existing cardiovascular risk

122

factors. Among our selected convalescent COVID-19 patients (n = 30), half had at least one cardiovascular

123

risk factor including mainly hypertension, diabetes and/or hyperlipidemia. They were benchmarked to

124

healthy participants (n = 13) and non-COVID patients with matched cardiovascular risk factors (n = 20).

COVID-19 AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION

131

Identification of the CEC population from individual peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)

132

samples was carried out with high stringency using a panel of established CEC immunophenotypic markers

133

(Fig. 1a). We first gated for the CD45-/CD31+ population to isolate CECs along with bone marrow-derived

134

endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and platelets, while ruling out CD45+ leukocytes that also expressed the

135

endothelial marker CD31 (PECAM1) (Duda, Cohen et al., 2007). This population was further subtyped

136

based on the progenitor marker, CD133, to rule out EPCs. Finally, a nucleic acid stain was used to

137

distinguish anucleate platelets from nucleated CECs defined here by a combined immunophenotypic profile

138

of CD45-/CD31+/CD133-/DNA+ (Burger & Touyz, 2012, Duda et al., 2007, Yu, Lee et al., 2013). Identified

139

CECs were further characterized for the expression of markers of endothelial cell activation, namely

140

intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), P-selectin (SELP) and fractalkine (CX3CL1), that are integral

141

for the processes of leukocyte adhesion, platelet aggregation and trans-endothelial migration respectively

142

(Goncharov, Nadeev et al., 2017, Johnson & Jackson, 2013).

143

CECs are typically rare in healthy individuals, occurring at between 0.0001% and 0.01% of the mononuclear

144

cell population in peripheral blood (Khan, Solomon et al., 2005). Postulated as being shed from damaged

145

vessels, elevated CEC numbers in the peripheral blood have been demonstrated as a cell-based biomarker

146

for vascular dysfunction across a range of diseases including cardiovascular disease, preeclampsia,

147

chronic kidney failure and sickle cell anemia (Goon, Boos et al., 2005). We enumerated and compared the

148

mean CEC number per million PBMC between healthy individuals, convalescent COVID-19 patients,

149

convalescent COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular risks and patients with cardiovascular risk but no

150

history of COVID-19. While statistical significance was only found for the difference in mean CECs between

151

healthy (M = 55.43, SEM = 10.64) and non-COVID-19 cardiovascular risk groups (M = 191.50, SEM =

152

44.77, p = .001), we observed a trend of more than two folds higher mean CEC numbers in both

153

convalescent COVID-19 groups relative to healthy individuals (Fig. 1b). Between the two convalescent

154

COVID-19 groups, patients with cardiovascular risk had higher mean CEC numbers (M = 153.75, SEM =

155

51.55) than patients without cardiovascular risk (M =116.21, SEM =28.17). These observations are

156

consistent with our hypothesis that COVID-19 patients, especially those with pre-existing cardiovascular

157

risk, may display persistent signs of vascular dysfunction even after recovery from COVID-19.

175

To ascertain the consequence of COVID-19 on endothelial dysfunction, we regrouped the convalescent

176

COVID-19 patients by their disease severity during acute infection (Fig. 1c). We found that both

177

convalescent COVID-19 patients who recovered from moderate symptoms (p = .0284) and non-COVID-19

178

patients with cardiovascular risks (p = .0033) had significantly higher numbers of CECs than healthy

179

controls. It was surprising that convalescent COVID-19 patients from severe symptoms did not result in

180

significantly higher CEC counts, probably due to limited representations in our current sample pool.

181

Collectively, Figures 1b and 1c demonstrate the potential impact of COVID-19 and cardiovascular risk

182

factors on endothelial injury, as indicated by the number of CECs in circulation. In Figure 1d, we further

183

performed molecular profiling of CECs for endothelial activation markers. Our data revealed significant

184

difference between the mean number of SELP+ CECs in convalescent COVID-19 patients with

185

cardiovascular risk and healthy individuals (p = .0291). When we analyzed their endothelial activation

186

hallmarks by disease severity (Fig. 1e), we observed a trend that convalescent COVID-19 patients who

187

recovered from severe symptoms had the highest number of SELP+ CECs, though insignificant. As seen

188

in the spread of data in Figures 1d and 1e, large inter-individual variations in CEC numbers was expected

189

and could obscure observations of statistically significant differences in mean values. To overcome this, we

190

compared the proportion of patients with regard to the numbers of activation markers expressed by CECs

191

in each group and a chi-square goodness-of-fit test was carried out to assess if the percentages of patients

192

were similar across the groups. We found a significant relationship between the number of endothelial

PERSISTENT CYTOKINE PRODUCTION IN CONVALESCENT COVID-19 PATIENTS

201

Multiplex microbead-based immunoassay was performed to determine the cytokine levels in COVID-

202

19 patient plasma during hospital admission and after discharge. To investigate the association between

203

cytokine responses and cardiovascular risks, cytokine and chemokine levels were compared between

204

COVID-19 patients with and without cardiovascular risk during the acute and convalescent phases of

205

infection (Fig. 2a). We found that COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular risk had lower levels of growth

206

factors BDNF (median concentration, 22.70 pg/mL vs. 38.57 pg/mL, p = .015), PDGF-BB (median

207

concentration, 31.08 pg/mL vs. 62.51 pg/mL, p = .023) and PIGF-1 (median concentration, 30.69 pg/mL vs.

208

1.49 pg/mL, p = .040) compared to patients without cardiovascular risk at the early acute phase of infection

209

(first plasma sample collected after hospital admission, at a median 10 days after symptom onset, IQR 7-

210

15) (Fig. 2b). These growth factors are known to promote vascular function (Alomari, Khabour et al., 2015,

211

Brown, Hong et al., 1995, Carmeliet, Moons et al., 2001) and our observations suggest that the endothelial

212

dysfunction underlying patients with cardiovascular risk may impede vascular repair following injury during

213

the acute phase of virus infection. Interestingly, the plasma levels of proinflammatory IL-1 (median

214

concentration, 4.95 pg/mL vs. 3.51 pg/mL, p = .026), IL-17A (median concentration, 3.12 pg/mL vs. 0.09

215

pg/mL, p = .003), IL-2 (median concentration, 48.82 pg/mL vs. 27.07 pg/mL, p = .007) and RANTES (median

216

concentration, 105.00 pg/mL vs. 72.47 pg/mL, p = .037) were significantly higher in patients with

217

cardiovascular risk than those without (Fig. 2b) during the early convalescent phase (first plasma sample

218

collected after hospital discharge, median 7 days post hospital discharge, IQR 3-12). Notably, the levels

219

proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-17A, IL-2 and RANTES remained elevated in COVID-19

220

patients at the early convalescent phase, particularly in those with prior cardiovascular risk, compared to

221

healthy controls (Fig. 2b). Result from simple linear regression analysis showed that age was significantly

222

associated with the presence of cardiovascular risks in our COVID-19 patients. After adjustment for age by

223

multiple linear regression analysis, levels of RANTES at the early convalescent phase was significantly

224

associated with cardiovascular risks (Supplementary Table 1).

CORRELATIVE STUDIES IMPLICATING ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION WITH PERSISTENT CYTOKINE PRODUCTION

244

To understand whether persistent immune activation may impact on endothelial dysfunction, we

245

performed correlation analysis of cytokine levels with the aforementioned CEC attributes. Interestingly, CEC

246

attributes from convalescent patients without prior cardiovascular risk correlated significantly with a greater

247

number of cytokines than those with cardiovascular risk (Fig. 3). This may suggest that persistent cytokine

248

production contributed primarily to endothelial injury (CEC counts) and activation hallmarks (CX3CL1+ and

249

SELP+) in convalescent patients without previously known risk factors. On the other hand, more

250

pronounced endothelial injury and activation in those with cardiovascular risk would have been attributed

251

to their preexisting cardiovascular risk factors, on top of aftermath of COVID-19. Among the positively

252

correlated cytokines in the cardiovascular risk group (Fig. 3), MIP-1α (CCL3) related to a chemoattractant

253

for leukocytes, along with IL-17A,(Williams, Huang et al., 2019) IL-8(Apostolakis, Vogiatzi et al., 2009) and

254

IL-18(Gerdes, Sukhova et al., 2002) known to evoke activation of endothelial cells during atherogenesis,

255

may suggest chronic development of atherosclerotic plaques already in these individuals.

256

For the convalescent patients without prior risk factors, the measures of CEC attributes reflected greater

257

sensitivity to cytokine-driven endothelial dysfunction that could signify a more direct consequence of

258

COVID-19. Further protein-protein interaction network analyses with STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval

259

of Interacting Genes/ Proteins) highlighted the direct and indirect interactions between the significant

260

cytokines and their functional associations with biological processes involved in inflammatory response,

261

vasculature development, angiogenesis, leukocyte chemotaxis, B cell proliferation and T cell activation

262

(Supplemental Fig.1). Among the positively correlated cytokines (Fig. 3), we observed growth factors

263

associated tissue regeneration and remodeling, namely EGF, LIF, PDGF-BB and PIGF-1 (PGF), indicating

264

possibility of adaptive angiogenesis taking place as a response to preceding damages caused by viral

265

infection and cytokine overdrive. IL-1RA, an IL-1 pathway inhibitor, could be an inflammation resolving

266

mediator post infection. Conversely, IP-10 (CXCL10) is known to limit angiogenesis (Bodnar, Yates et al.,

267

2006). This collective turnover of endothelial cells during blood vessel remodeling may result in elevated

268

number of CECs. A number of significantly correlated cytokines are chemokines known to induce

269

endothelial activation and promote chemotaxis of leukocytes to vascular endothelium. Chemotactic factors

270

such as IP-10 (CXCL10), CXCL12 and RANTES (CCL5) regulate adhesion and transmigration of T

271

lymphocytes, monocytes and/or neutrophils through endothelial barrier (Sokol & Luster, 2015). Our data

272

resonated with the findings from a study on high-cardiovascular-risk patient cohort, where RANTES

273

correlated positively with endothelial injury marker, and that increased perivascular expression of RANTES

274

was associated with vascular accumulation of T cells (Mikolajczyk, Nosalski et al., 2016). Moreover,

275

RANTES was specifically correlated with SELP+ CEC (r = 0.5677, p = 0.0295), indicating that activated

276

platelet-derived RANTES may work in concert with endothelial SELP to mediate platelet aggregation and

277

trigger coagulation cascade. In partial correlation analyses, a majority of these CEC-cytokines correlations

278

were sustained even after accounting for age (Supplemental Table 2).

279

Overall, CEC attributes of convalescent COVID-19 patients correlated with a vast majority of differentiation

280

and activation factors associated with T cells and B cells (IL-4, IL-5, IL-7, IL-17A, IL-18, MIP-1α and

281

RANTES) (Turner, Nedjai et al., 2014) implicating a broad adaptive immune response with endothelial

282

dysfunction. Besides being a target of the immune mediators, we recognize that endothelial cells, once

283

activated, could also be a source of these cytokines, which in turn could activate their immune counterparts.

ENDOTHELIAL -IMMUNE CROSSTALK

291

Our ability to measure activation markers directly on CECs motivated us to better understand the receptor-

292

receptor and chemokine-receptor interactions between activated endothelial cells with putative immune

293

subpopulations in COVID-19. We performed data mining of published single-cell transcriptomic datasets

294

on PBMCs from healthy participants, mild and severe COVID-19 patients (Wilk, Rustagi et al., 2020), and

295

COVID-19 patients with or without cardiovascular disease (Schulte-Schrepping, Reusch et al., 2020). Then

296

we re-analyzed the expressions of counter receptors (i.e. ITGAL, SELPLG and CX3CR1) to our endothelial

297

activation markers (i.e. ICAM1, SELP and CX3CL1 respectively), in order to identify the potential immune

298

interactors with activated endothelial cells. We found that those counter receptors were most pronouncedly

299

expressed by CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells and to some extent monocytes (Fig. 4a and

300

Supplemental Figure 2). In Wilk et al. dataset, the expression of CX3CR1 was intensified in mild and

301

severe COVID-19 patients than healthy participants (Fig. 4a). The relationship between counter receptors

302

expression and COVID-19 disease was even more marked in Schulte-Schrepping et al. dataset with a

303

higher proportion of NK or both CD8+ and NK cells expressing all three counter receptors found in mild and

304

severe COVID-19 samples, respectively, regardless of comorbidity with cardiovascular disease

305

(Supplemental Figure 2).As those counter receptors generally marks cytotoxic effector lymphocytes in

306

peripheral blood (Nishimura, Umehara et al., 2002), we correspondingly found that CD8+ T cells and NK

307

cells were the major cytotoxic populations expressing perforin and granzymes (Fig. 4b), especially in

308

COVID-19 patients (Supplemental Figure 2). Published immunophenotyping studies on convalescent

309

COVID-19 patients are still limited. Several immunophenotyping studies have reported immune exhaustion

310

phenotype and reduced antiviral cytokine production capability that were inversely correlated with COVID-

311

19 severity during acute infection (summarized in Supplemental Table 3). The reason underlying such

312

lymphopenia remains unclear and could be either due to an impaired maturation possibly due an increased

313

level of inflammatory cytokine such as IL-6 (Cifaldi, Prencipe et al., 2015, Mazzoni, Salvati et al., 2020) or

314

the recruitment of the mature T and NK cells into the lungs or other organs (Liao, Liu et al., 2020, Varga et

315

al., 2020, Xu et al., 2020). Conversely, in many convalescent patients and even in those who had recovered

316

from mild symptoms, broad CD8+ T-cell response against multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins mediated by

317

functional effector and memory T cell populations were detected, suggesting a key role for T cells in

318

protective immunity in COVID-19 convalescents (Supplemental Table 3). Intriguingly, a recent

319

immunophenotyping study using high-dimensional flow cytometry reported a higher proportion of activated

320

CD8+ T cells in healthy participants and to some extend recovered individuals than in COVID-19 patients

321

(Mathew, Giles et al., 2020). Therefore, we postulate that persistent cytokine production not only activates

322

endothelial cells in convalescent COVID-19 patient but may promote direct interaction between activated

323

endothelial cells and cytotoxic effector cells. Therefore, these individuals could be susceptible to further

324

cytotoxicity-induced endothelial injury.

DISCUSSIONS

334

The rapid rise of COVID-19 “long-haulers” with lingering symptoms post-infection, or recovered

335

individuals who suffer from sudden cardiovascular events, are expected to lead to a worldwide shift in

336

disease burden in the near future that would continue to place tremendous strain on our healthcare

337

systems. The understanding of COVID-19 intermediate and long-term impact on vascular health is still

338

lacking. Thus, we performed vascular phenotyping through the analysis of CECs in convalescent COVID-

339

19 patients. Our findings reveal that endothelial dysfunction was most pronounced in convalescent COVID-

340

19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors (i.e. hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes).

341

Furthermore, markers of endothelial injury and activation in convalescent COVID-19 patients were

342

significantly correlated with a number of proinflammatory cytokines that persisted into convalescent phase,

343

suggesting that recovered individuals may be vulnerable to vascular instability.

344

About 2.5% of convalescent COVID-19 patients are found with thrombosis (including arterial and venous

345

events), 30 days post discharge (Patell, Bogue et al., 2020). As endothelial dysfunction often precedes

346

serious thrombotic complications and ischemic damages to organs, we detected subclinical endothelial

347

changes using CECs and associated activation markers. Most previous studies focused on enumeration of

348

vascular progenitor and endothelial cells in the blood. Here, even with a stringent marker profile of CD45-/

349

CD133-/ DNA+/ CD31+ to identify live CECs, it is common that CEC numbers present high inter-individual

350

variability. Circulatory release of CECs may be altered if some patients had been treated with metformin or

351

drugs that may confer some vasculoprotective effects,(Ahmed, Rider et al., 2016) potentially leading to

352

fewer endothelial cells being shed off the vascular lining. Beyond enumeration of CECs, we further

353

measured ICAM1, SELP and CX3CL1 on CECs, expressions of which would suggest proinflammatory and

354

procoagulant state of the endothelial cells originating from sites of vascular injury. In comparing with non-

355

COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular risk factors (i.e. hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease),

356

the compounded effects of COVID-19 with prior cardiovascular risk factors rendered convalescent patients

357

with more SELP-expressing CECs, and the greatest proportion within this group of individuals possessed

358

all three endothelial activation markers. This suggests a potential role of endothelial damage in the

359

pathogenesis of post infection thrombosis.

361

The sequence of events leading to post COVID-19 complication has not been fully elucidated, but likely a

362

vicious cycle caused by vascular leakage, activation of coagulation pathway and inflammation (Teuwen,

363

Geldhof et al., 2020). Breach of endothelial barriers might have occurred early due to impairment of ACE2

364

upon SARS-CoV-2 entry, indirectly perturbing the kallikrein–bradykinin pathway,(Garvin, Alvarez et al.,

365

2020) thus resulting in vascular hyperpermeability. Direct SARS-CoV-2 infection impair the renin–

366

angiotensin pathway (Ingraham, Barakat et al., 2020). Angiotensin II is known to promote vascular

367

inflammation and stimulates endothelial secretion of CXCL10 which in turn acts in an autocrine manner to

368

promote angiotensin II-induced endothelial cell apoptosis (Ide, Hirase et al., 2008). Here, our cytokine

369

profiling confirmed that cytokine production remained heightened post-infection. Of interest, the CEC

370

attributes of convalescent patients correlated significantly with a number of proinflammatory cytokines,

371

indicating that prolonged overactive state of the immune system was implicated with endothelial

372

dysfunction, especially for those without prior cardiovascular risk factors. Hence, viral-induced damage

373

exposes tissue factors on endothelial cells which are activated by persistent cytokines to produce

374

chemoattractants in recruiting leukocytes to endothelial cells. Together with activated monocytes and

375

platelets, endothelial cells mediate extrinsic coagulation pathway, leading to blood clotting.

376

In our study, a number of chemokines and activated T cell-associated cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-17A, and

377

RANTES) remained elevated post-infection, reflecting a broad adaptive immune response. We noted much

378

heterogeneity in the immune profiles of COVID-19 patients where one study described no substantial

379

expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes by T cells, NK cells or monocytes, to another that found

380

higher proportion of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in severe COVID-19 individuals (summarized in Supplemental

381

Table 3). Similarly, we also noted differences in the expression of counter receptor and cytotoxicity

associated genes between the two scRNA datasets that we analyzed although both studies supported

383

higher proportion of CD8+ and NK cells expressing counter receptor and cytotoxicity associated genes in

384

COVID-19 samples. Importantly, no difference in the expression of counter receptor and cytotoxicity

385

associated genes were noted in COVID-19 patients with or without cardiovascular risk. While the nature of

386

the cardiovascular risk in Schulte-Schrepping et al dataset is not elaborated, it supports that factors other

387

than immune cytotoxicity may impact vascular health. Correspondingly, SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells were

388

described in COVID-19 convalescents and even unexposed individuals (Grifoni, Weiskopf et al., 2020). We

389

postulate that activated endothelial cells express receptors and ligands which regulate interactions with the

390

counter receptors on functional effector and memory T cell populations, making activated endothelial cells

391

a potential target of cytotoxic effector lymphocytes. Immune cell-mediated endothelial injury has been

392

observed in other viral infections, including Ebola, human cytomegalovirus infection and malaria, where T

393

cells recruited to infected site by inflammation could induce apoptosis of infected endothelial cells, causing

394

vascular leakage (Claser, Nguee et al., 2019, van de Berg, Yong et al., 2012, Wolf, Kann et al., 2015, Yang,

395

Duckers et al., 2000). Likewise, in non-infectious diseases such as acute coronary syndrome and systemic

396

sclerosis, cytotoxic CD4+ T cells were capable of causing damages to endothelial cells (Maehara, Kaneko

397

et al., 2020, Nakajima, Schulte et al., 2002). It is plausible that infected endothelial cells could be susceptible

398

to direct cytotoxic T cell-mediated killing due to the immune overdrive in COVID-19. Subsequently, how

399

persistent cytokine response and functional effector T cell populations could translate into endothelial

400

dysfunction during convalescence warrant further investigation.

401
402

We are mindful of the limitations with this current study. First, we noted the major determinants of

403

cardiovascular risks in convalescent COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, but there might have been

404

unmeasured confounding conditions that could contribute to some heterogeneity in our CEC and cytokine

405

profiling. Second, convalescent blood samples were collected at various time points due to logistical

406

constraints in recalling recovered patients on the same day post-infection. Finally, to understand post-

407

COVID-19 complications, long-term phenotyping of vascular functions and immune profiles of convalescent

408

patients is still lacking due to short term horizons from when these individuals were first infected. There is

409

a critical need to monitor prospective cohorts of recovered individuals in order to establish the full spectrum

410

of clinical courses of complications. Global efforts in this aspect are evident and are underway.

411

Hematologic assessment (i.e. thrombin generation, platelet activation studies, von Willebrand factor) is

412

commonly performed to help manage convalescent patients who have been re-admitted for acute

413

thrombosis. It would be valuable to risk stratify convalescent patients before adverse events happen. Our

414

profiling of CECs may serve as a form of vascular surveillance to complement hematologic assessment in

415

identifying early molecular and endothelial changes in high-risk individuals. Analysis of CECs may detect

416

subclinical changes in the vasculatures and be able to provide accurate and easily transferable endpoints

417

in clinical assessment.

418

In summary, managing the aftermath of COVID-19 is an imperative. Endothelial instability may be a key

419

mechanism underpinning the development of post-infection vascular complications. Clinical trials in

420

preventive therapy for vascular complications may be needed.

Study protocols were approved by ethics committees of the Nanyang Technological University Singapore

459

(IRB-2020-09-011). PBMC samples were washed with DPBS (Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline,

460

Hyclone, SH30028.02) + 1% BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin, Hyclone, SH30574.02), and then resuspended

461

in 100 µl of DPBS + 1% BSA for antibody staining (Supplemental Methods & Materials). Staining was

462

carried out in the dark for 10 minutes at room temperature, followed by 20 minutes at 4°C on an analog

463

tube rotator. After staining, cells were rinsed and resuspended in DPBS + 1% BSA for downstream flow

464

cytometry analysis. Flow cytometry was performed using BD LSRFortessa X-20 (BD Biosciences) and data

465

acquisition was performed on FACSDiva software, version 8.0.1 (BD Biosciences). Spectral overlap

466

between INDO-1, APC, PE, PE-Cy7, AF488 and BV711 channels was calculated automatically by the

467

FACSDiva software after measuring single-color compensation controls from pooled PBMCs. Optimal

468

compensation was achieved using compensation control beads (Anti-Mouse Ig, κ/Negative Control

469

Compensation Particles Set, 552843) together with corresponding conjugated antibodies. Acquired data

470

were analyzed using FlowJo software, version 10.7.1. Analysis of each patient typically included between

471

50,000 – 200,000 PBMCs depending on sample availabilities. CECs were detected by a combined

472

immunophenotypic profile of CD45-/CD31+/CD133-/DNA+ and were further characterized for the

473

expressions of ICAM1, SELP and CX3CL1. Attributes such as CECs or ‘activated’ CECs were represented

474

as cells per million of PBMCs in Figure 1.

489

timepoints were measured with the Luminex assay using the Cytokine/Chemokine/Growth Factor 45-plex

490

Human ProcartaPlex Panel 1 (ThermoFisher Scientific; Supplemental Methods and Materials). Patient

samples with a concentration out of measurement range were assigned the value of the logarithmic

transformation of the limit of quantification. Data analysis was done with Bio-Plex Manager 6.1.1 software.

S TATISTICS

495

Due to inter-individual heterogeneities of flow cytometric and cytokine data, nonparametric tests of

496

association were preferentially used throughout this study unless otherwise stated. For flow cytometric data

497

on CEC attributes, statistical differences between groups were calculated using Kruskal-Wallis test with

498

Dunn’s multiple comparison post-test. Significant p values (< 0.05) were indicated on the graphs directly.

499

To assess for differences in the frequencies of patients with CECs expressing endothelial activation

500

markers, ICAM1, SELP or CX3CL1 and the cumulative frequencies for all markers, the number of patients

501

per group were summarised in contingency tables. These were then analysed with Chi-square goodness

502

of fit test with expected values generated from the data using GraphPad Prism, version 8.3.1.

503

For the cytokine analysis, Mann Whitney U tests were used to discern the differences in cytokine levels

504

between the patients with or without cardiovascular risk factors. A multiple linear regression analysis was

505

conducted to examine the association between plasma cytokines and the presence of cardiovascular risks

506

in COVID-19 patients after adjustment for age. Heatmap and scatter plots were generated using GraphPad

507

Prism version 8. Concentrations of immune mediators were scaled between 0 and 1 for visualization in the

509

illustrated with Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database (STRING) (version

510

11.0; available at: https://string-db.org). All the interactions between cytokines were derived from high-

511

throughput lab experiments and previous knowledge in curated databases at a confidence threshold of 0.4.

512

For correlative study between CEC attributes and cytokine levels, we selected non-parametric Spearman

513

correlation with no assumption regarding value distribution. Non-linear regression and Spearman rank

514

correlation coefficients were calculated to access associations between the level of serum cytokines and

515

CEC attributes for convalescent COVID-19 patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors. The level

516

of statistical significance was set at two-tailed test with p values of <0.05 to detect any significant

517

associations between specific cytokines and CEC attributes. Statistical analyses for this correlative study

518

were performed using GraphPad Prism software, version 8.3.1. To address potential age-related

519

contributions to the correlations observed between CEC and plasma cytokines in Figure 3, non-parametric

520

partial correlation coefficients based on Spearman’s rank correlations were determined for the identified

521

correlated variables while controlling for age. The R package ‘ppcor’ was used to compute the coefficients,

522

p values and test statistics in Supplemental Table 2. (Kim, 2015).
