Summary
2019 novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) had typical clinical manifestations (fever and
cough) ,and presented with characteristic chest CT imaging features (multiple lesions in
both lungs, often accompanied by GGO, vascular enlargement and cobblestone/reticular
pattern), which are helpful to the radiologist in the early detection and diagnosis of this
emerging global health emergency. In addition, changes in these main CT features can
indicate development of the disease.

Highlights:
1.Fever (85.7%) and cough (80.9%) were the two main symptoms of NCP patients.The
incidence of shortness of breath was 85.7% in the severe cases, significantly higher than
21.4% in the mild cases.
2. Multiple lesions in both lungs and with incidence of GGO (100%), vascular enlargement
(76.5%) and cobblestone/reticular pattern (70.6%) were the major features of NCP
patients. 85.7% of cases in serve group displayed 4-5 lobes were involved
simultaneously.
3.Changes in these main CT imaging features can indicate development of the disease.
About 19.1% of patients (4 of 21) presented with a normal CT.

Abstract
Background and Objective: WHO Director-General declared that the 2019-nCoV outbreak
constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern,and the outbreak is still
on-going.Chest CT had been a key component of the diagnostic workup for patients with
suspected infection. In this retrospective study, we attempt to summarize and analyze the
chest CT features of 2019-nCov infections, and to identify the typical features to improved
the diagnostic accuracy of new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). Methods:Chest CT scans
and Clinical data of 21 patients confirmed NCP in our hospital were enrolled.These
patients were divided into mild and sever group according to clinical manifestations
described by the 6th clinical practice guideline of NCP in China. Main clinical and chest
CT features were analyzed and identify. Results: Fever (85.7%) and cough (80.9%) were
the two main symptoms of NCP patients.More significantly higher incidence (85.7%) of
shortness of breath in the severe cases. Multiple lesions in both lungs and with incidence
of GGO(100%),vascular enlargement (76.5%) and cobblestone/reticular pattern(70.6%)
were the major feature.The incidence of consolidation, mixed pattern and vascular
enlargement features were up to 100% in the severe group, significantly higher than that
of patients in mild group. In addition, the incidence of air-bronchogram, dilated bronchi
with thickened wall and fibrosis in the severe group was significantly higher than that in
the mild group. Conclusions: Fever and cough are the typical clinical features of NCP
patients, and chest CT mainly manifested as multiple lesions in both lungs, often
accompanied by GGO, vascular enlargement and cobblestone/reticular pattern.Changes
in these main CT features can indicate development of the disease

1.Introduction
The atypical pneumonia case, caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCov), was first
reported and confirmed in Wuhan, China in December 31, 2019 (Pneumonia of unknown
cause-China,2020)[1]. Initially confined to Wuhan, the infection has spread elsewhere,
sporadic cases exported from Wuhan were reported in many foreign countries.On
January 30, the WHO Director-General declared that the 2019-nCov outbreak constitutes
a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [2]. So far, the outbreak is still
on-going, the number of reported cases of 2019-nCov infection continue to
increase.Several relevant literatures estimated the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV, the
mean estimate of R0 for the new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) ranges from 1.4 to
3.58[3,4]. As of 18 February 2020, NCP has caused 73400 confirmed cases including
1870 deaths, 6242 suspected cases, and 12734 cured cases in mainland released by the
National Health Commission of China. Now Japan has become the second most affected
country with 519 confirmed cases, and followed by Singapore with 77 confirmed cases.
Person-to-person transmission of NCP has been confirmed and with several ways of
transmission, moreover the asymptomatic individual is identified as a potential source of
infection. Fever and cough were reported as main clinical manifestations of NCP
patients[5]. Based on the clinical observations and summary, the main diagnostic
criteria[6] of 2019-nCov infections are : 1) Contact history of the epidemic area and related
patients; 2) Nucleic acid is positive; 3) Fever, cough, shortness of breath and other clinical
symptoms; 4) Laboratory examination showed that white blood cells were normal or
decreased and lymphocytes decreased; 5) Lung lesions. Especially,the 1th and 2th
standards were the most important for 2019-nCov infected confirm. However, in the
diagnosis and treatment process, it was found that the above diagnostic criteria could not
fully meet the needs of clinical prevention and control, and some atypical clinical
manifestations appeared[5,7,8], which brought great difficulties and challenges to the
prevention and control of the epidemic.
Due to the large and complex population movements, the diversity of transmission
pathways[5,8,9](droplets,contact, fecal-oral and aerosol pathways),and natural and
intermediate hosts are not fully understood, this leads to ambiguous contact history
information. In addition, some patients do not have typical symptoms of fever and cough,
and there may be basic lesions or complex infections that lead to the lack of changes in
the number of typical white blood cells and lymphocytes, which all increase the difficulty of
clinical diagnosis. At present, nucleic acid detection was still as gold standard to
confirmed NCP, but the sensitivity and specificity of NCP was not evaluated
[10].According to current clinical observation, the positive rate is only 30%-50%. It has
been found that patients with high clinical suspicion still have negative viral nucleic acid
test for 2 times, while chest CT has displayed obvious lesions[11]. Unlucky, at the
beginning, these patients failed to timely and effectively prevent and control due to
negative nucleic acid test, leading to the expansion of the infection. CT diagnosis
specificity is not as good as nucleic acid, but its sensitivity is significantly higher than
nucleic acid. Therefore, to fight the epidemic front in Wuhan, doctor Zhang urgently called
for " NPC diagnosis should not blindly believe in nucleic acid testing, chest CT findings
should take as the main diagnostic basis". Therefore, the fifth edition of NCP diagnostic

criteria took chest CT as the main diagnostic basis[6]. Radiologists will encounter NCP
patients with the number of patients continues to increase. Therefore, radiologists must be
familiar with the CT features of NCP.
In this study, we attempt to summarize and analyze the chest CT imaging data of
patients confirmed with 2019-nCov infections, and to identify the typical imaging features
to improved the diagnostic accuracy of NCP, and to reduced missed diagnosis and
misdiagnosis.
2.Materials and Methods
2.1 Patients and CT examination
From January 20, 2020 to February 6, 2020, 21 patients in the First people’s hospital
of Foshan in Guangdong Province, China, with confirmed 2019-nCov were enrolled. these
patients were divided into mild and sever group according to clinical manifestations
described by the 6th clinical practice guideline of NCP in China[6]. All patients were
underwent chest CT examination on an Aquilion ONE scanner (Toshiba Medical
Systems;Tokyo,Japan), and imaged with 1mm slice thickness, Max 512×512. All patients
were positive for 2019-nCov via laboratory testing of respiratory secretions.
Our institutional review board approved this retrospective study analyzing existing
patient data with patient information de-identified and all subjects gave written informed
consent. And this study involved no potential risk to patients.
2.2 CT Images and Clinical Data Analysis
The HRCT findings of NCP, according to previously described [9] and clinical
observation, each of the 21 patients, the initial chest CT findings were categorized the
predominant pattern as followed: ground glass opacification (GGO),consolidation,
cobblestone/reticular pattern; mixed pattern (combination of consolidation, GGO and
reticular opacities); air-bronchogram; vascular enlargement in lesion; nodule (D<30mm)
and thorn pear signs; slightly dilated bronchi with thickened wall; fibrosis,etc. The the main
HRCT characteristics and related exposition were showed in Fig.1. In addition, the
distribution characteristics of lesions, the extent of pulmonary involvement, mediastinal
lymph node status and pleural effusion were also analyzed.
All CT images were reviewed on PACS by two cardiothoracic radiologists with 10
years ( Dr. Xu) and 8 years (Dr.Wu) of clinical experience, respectively. Each patient’s
chest CT findings was reviewed independently and final decisions reached by consensus.
If the interpretations of features extracted by two primary radiologist are inconsistent, a
third fellowship trained senior radiologist with 25years of experience (Dr.Pan) adjudicated
a final decision.
The calinical manifestations of NCP patients, such as fever,cough, shortness of
breath, weak,diarrhoea and muscle pain were analyzed.

2.3 Statistical Analysis
We used statistical software SPSS 2.0. The differences among the constituent ratios of
various signs in NCP patients were analyzed with the X2 test. The differences of the
constituent ratios of various signs between mild group and severe group were also
analyzed with X2 test test. Differences of p<0.05 were considered statistically significant.
3.Results
3.1Clinical manifestations of NCP patients
Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of 21 patients with NCP. 21 patients all had
clear contact history, including 10 men and 11 women with average age was 43.1 years.
Fever (85.7%) and cough (80.9%) were the two main symptoms, followed by shortness of
breath (85.7%) and weak (28.6%).Besides,diarrhoea and muscle pain were rare.
Compared with patients in mild group, male proportion and onset age of patients in serve
group were both higher (p<0.05). Fever and cough were found in 100% of the severe
cases, but there was no significant difference between these two groups. The incidence of
shortness of breath was 85.7% in the severe cases, significantly higher than 21.4% in the
mild cases.
3.2 Distribution Patterns of Lesions
Lung lesions occurred in 17 (80.9%) patients with NCP, while normal lungs occurred in 4
(19.1%) patients. Among the 17 patients with pulmonary lesions, 14 (82.4%) cases
showed multiple lesions in both lungs (Fig.2A). Besides,10 patients had lesions distributed
in the peripheral zone (subpleural)(Fig.2A), and 7 cases showed both peripheral zone and
medium-to internal zone were all involved.15 (88.2%) cases showed simultaneous
involvement of multiple pulmonary lobes (≥2)(Fig.2B), among them 12 cases (70.6%) with
more than 4 lobes were involved.6 patients (85.7%) in serve group displayed 4-5 lobes
were involved simultaneously, which was significantly higher than that in the mild group
(60% ). However,there was no difference in lesion location and whether bilateral lung
involvement between these two group.
3.3 Representation of Major CT characteristics in NCP
Table 2 shows the manifestations of various major chest CT features in 17 patients with
NCP. GGO, Vascular enlargement and Cobblestone/Reticular pattern were the three
major feature of the disease(Fig.3), with an incidence of 100%, 76.5% and 70.6%,
respectively and followed by Consolidation and Mixed pattern, accounting for 52.9%.In
addition, mediastinal lymphadenopathy and hydrothorax had the lowest incidence of
17.6% and 5.9%, respectively.

Table 3 shows the manifestations of various CT features between the two groups. GGO
were present in all patients(100%) in both groups, and Cobblestone/Reticular pattern
occurred in mild and sever group were 60% and 85.7%, respectively, without significant
different. The consolidation, Mixed pattern and Vascular enlargement features were up to
100% in the severe group, significantly higher than 20%, 20% and 60% in the mild group.
Consolidation and Mixed pattern had significant differences between the two groups (p
=0.002). In addition, the incidence of Air-bronchogram, Dilated bronchi with thickened wall
and Fibrosis in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the mild group (10%).
Nodule/Thorn pear signs were found 50% in mild cases, significantly higher than those in
severe cases (p<0.01). Mediastinal lymphadenopathy and hydrothorax were rare,but both
occurred in severe cases. Fig.4 and Fig.5 showed the CT features of mild case and serve
case underwent NCP.
4. Discussion
4.1 Clinical features of NCP patients
All 21 patients in our study all had a history of recent travel to Wuhan or directly
contact with NCP patients.This results was convincing proof that the disease is
characterized by human-to-human transmission. A new study revealed that the
reproductive number of COVID-19 is up to 3.28 [3]. However, in this study, the patients did
not be acquired a clear transmission route, because the virus may have multiple
transmission modes[12,13]. Previous study demonstrated that common symptoms at
onset of the illness were fever, cough and shortness of breath and with less common
symptoms were sputum production, headache and diarrhoea etc[4,5,7,12,13]. Our results
revealed that main symptom of NCP patients manifested as fever (85.7%), cough (80.9%),
followed by shortness of breath(42.9%)and fatigue(28.6%),diarrhea and muscle
pain,which was consistent with previous studies.However,a large clinical cases(1099
cases) study by professor zhong et al [7] found that only 43.8% showed fever in the early
stage, but up to 87.9% showed fever after hospitalization.It dmonstrated that fever is
closely related to the development of the disease, therefore fever as a screening indicator
may miss a large number of early patients. In addition,our study and all previous showed
that diarrhea was rare, and we found that diarrhea only occurred in serve patients.
Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the damage of digestive tract function in
these patients and be alert to the risk of fecal-oral infection. 85.7% of severe cases
manifested shortness of breath, were significant higher than that of mild cases. Shortness
of breath would be a better indicators to reflect the disease's progression. A new study[12]
base on 72314 patients revealed that middle-aged(30-79 years old) and elderly men
(51.4%) were prone to the NCP,and looking at the sex ratio, men are more likely to die
(2.8%) than women (1.7%). our results showed NCP patients with average 43.1 years old,
and men are more likely to be worse(57.1%), showed similar characteristics.
4.2. CT features of NCP and the relationship with the disease development
Lung lesions in NCP patients mainly manifested as subpleural multiple lesions in
bilateral lung[14,15],our results showed 82.4% cases displayed multiple lesions in

bilateral lungs, and all cases showed significant peripheral distribution characteristics,
wich was consistent with previous studies[14-16].We speculated that the main reasons for
the distribution characteristics of NCP as followed: 1)The 2019-nCov infect alveolar
epithelial cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and cause acute lung
injury[17].The peripheral lobe of the lung is relatively well developed, abundant alveolar
epithelial cells may express more ACE2. 2) The ventilation function of alveolar tissue in
the peripheral part of the lung is relatively weak, which may more easily lead to the
aggregation of high concentration of virus particles and the onset of disease. In addition,
some scholars believe that virus particles are extremely small (2019-nCov is about
120nm), which can directly enter the distal alveoli with respiration. In this study, CT
features of NCP patients mainly displayed GGO (100%), vascular enlargement sign
(76.5%) and cobblestone/reticular pattern (70.6%), as followed by consolidation and
mixed pattern (GGO and consolidation) with about 52.9%. While mediastinal lymph nodes
and pleural effusion were rare, which was basically consistent with literature
reports[14,15].In general, the lung characteristics of NCP patients were mainly associated
with pulmonary interstitial inflammation, which was similar to Middle East respiratory
syndrome(MERS)[18] and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome(SARS)[19] caused by
coronavirus. In fact, the pathological characteristics of NCP were confirmed to be similar
to SARS and MERS[20]
Previous reports revealed that GGO as the key CT feature.It can exists for a long
time throughout the course of the disease, and may be unique CT feature in some early
patients[15,16]. In the recent study, GGO feature was observed in all NCP patients.
Pathological basis of GGO is mainly diffuse alveolar injury, accompanied by cell
fibromyxoid exudate,and lung transparent membrane formation. GGO at the early stage
could be completely absorbed and improved after effective treatment [21]. With the
development of the disease, the interlobular septa thickened on the basis of GGO, and
showed typical cobblestone/reticular pattern,and when increased exudation in the alveoli
and alveolar collapse resulted in consolidation. Compared with the mild group patients,
the incidence of consolidation, mixed pattern, air-bronchogram, dilated bronchi with
thickened wall and fibrosis significantly increased in severe patients. In addition,
cobblestone/reticular pattern and vascular enlargement sign were both common findings
in severe patients without significant different. It is suggested that the changes of
pulmonary imaging characteristics can effectively reflect the changes of lung tissue and
functional injury.Vascular enlargement in or around the lesions were considered to be an
important features for NCP diagnosis,76.5% patients in our study presented this features.
This may be due to inflammatory vascular congestion, or to thickening or fluid buildup in
the perivascular interstitium[20]. Additionally,all these findings suggest the presence of
fibrosis, which also presented commonly in patients underwent SARS and MERS.In this
study, consolidation and mixed manifestations were observed in 52.9% of NCP patients,
and the incidence rate was up to 100% in severe patients. Combined with previous
literature results, lung tissue appeared multiple consolidation with the aggravation of the
disease. That's the main difference from MERS[18]. 6 patients (85.7%) in serve group
displayed 4-5 lobes were involved simultaneously, which was significantly higher than that
in the mild group (60% ).Our result demonstrated that almost all lobes involvement exists
in severe patients, which well explains the pathologic basis for the high incidence of
dyspepsia. It was found that CT can not only detect early and diagnose NCP accurately,

but also follow up the change trend of CT features can effectively predict the outcome of
NCP patients.
4.2 Limitations
The main limitations of this study, firstly, the small number of NCP cases enrolled in
this study and additional study cases are needed in the following study. Besides, This
study lacks patient follow-up data, so further follow-up is needed to better observe the
relationship between CT signs and clinical course.

5. Conclusions
Fever and cough are the main clinical features of NCP. CT showed multiple peripheral
lesions in bilateral lungs, mainly characterized by GGO, paving stones and vascular
thickening. There were some differences in CT manifestations between mild cases and
severe cases. In severe cases, pulmonary consolidation, mixed consolidation, slight
bronchial dilatation and thickening, bronchial gas image and fibrosis were significant,
which were consistent with NCP as pathological manifestations of pulmonary interstitial
lesions. According to the characteristics of chest CT, early accurate diagnosis and
prognosis of NCP can be achieved.

Figure 3. 76-year old man with history of recent travel to Wuhan, presenting with fever
and productive cough. Axial thin-section non-contrast CT image shows diffusion lesions in
bilateral lung, mainly manifested as ground-glass opacification (red arrow and red line
around region),and cobblestone/Reticular pattern( blue arrow and blue line around region).
Besides,Vascular enlargement sign was observed in the lesions(yellow arrow).

Figure 4. 57-year old man as mild NCP patients with history of recent travel to Wuhan.
Ground-glass opacities with a peripheral distribution in bilateral lung( green arrow), and
with enlarged image in the upper right corner of A image. Vascular enlargement sign was
observed in the lesion located in the left upper lobe, and with enlarged image in the upper
left corner of B image ( yellow arrow). The lesions in the left lower lobe shows
cobblestone/reticular pattern, and with enlarged image in the lower right corner of B
image(red yellow).

Figure 5. 68-year old female as serve NCP patients with history of recent travel to Wuhan,
presenting with fever and productive cough. Axial thin-section non-contrast CT image
shows diffusion lesions in bilateral lung. A showed many CT features such as
ground-glass opacification,cobblestone/reticular pattern(blue arrow and bule line around
region), frbrosis and dilated bronchi with thickened wall (the enlarged image in the upper
right corner, red arrow). B showed consolidation (pink arrow) and mixed pattern (yellow
arrow and yellow line around region) in the bilateral lower lobes.
