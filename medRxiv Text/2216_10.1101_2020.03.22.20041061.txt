ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND
There is little information about the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) during pregnancy.
This study aimed to determine the clinical features and the maternal and neonatal outcomes of
pregnant women with Covid-19.

METHODS
In this retrospective analysis from five hospitals, we included pregnant women with Covid-19
from January 1 to February 20, 2020. The primary composite endpoints were admission to an
intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Secondary endpoints
included the clinical severity of Covid-19, neonatal mortality, admission to neonatal intensive
care unit (NICU), and the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of
pregnant women and newborns.

RESULTS
Thirty-three pregnant women with Covid-19 and 28 newborns were identified. One (3%)
pregnant woman needed the use of mechanical ventilation. No pregnant women admitted to
the ICU. There were no moralities among pregnant women or newborns. The percentages of
pregnant women with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms were 13 (39.4%),19(57.6%), and
1(3%). One (3.6%) newborn developed ARDS and was admitted to the NICU. The rate of
perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was 3.6%.

CONCLUSIONS
This report suggests that pregnant women are not at increased risk for severe illness or
mortality with Covid-19 compared with the general population. The SARS-CoV-2 infection
during pregnancy might not be associated with as adverse obstetrical and neonatal outcomes
that are seen with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection during pregnancy.

INTRODUCTION
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has spread quickly from Wuhan,
China to all other major cities in China and is rapidly spreading to a growing number of other
countries despite efforts at containment and isolation1. The population is generally susceptible
to this newly identified coronavirus2, initially termed 2019-nCoV and subsequently
SARS-CoV-2. Early efforts have focused on describing the clinical characteristics and
outcomes of Covid-19 in the general population1,3,4. However, the disease appears to be
particularly impactful in special populations that include those older than sixty-five years of
age 5. Pregnant women are also considered to be a special population group because of the
unique ‘immune suppression’ caused by pregnancy6. The immunologic and physiologic
changes might make pregnant women at higher risk of severe illness or mortality with
Covid-19, compared with the general public. However, there is little information on Covid-19
during pregnancy. This study aimed to determine the clinical features and the maternal and
neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with Covid-19.

METHODS
STUDY DESIGN AND PARTICIPANT
This is a retrospective analysis of data from multiple centers. From January 1 to February 20,
2020, all consecutive pregnant women with Covid-19 in five hospitals were enrolled. The five
hospitals were Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Renmin
Hospital of Wuhan University, Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province,
Yichang Central People’s Hospital, and Jinmen Second People’s Hospital. Among the five

hospitals, three hospitals were in Wuhan, and two hospitals were in other cities of the Hubei
Province that are adjacent to Wuhan and in endemic areas of Covid-19. All five hospitals
assigned by the government to be responsible for the treatments of pregnant women with
Covid-19. The Institutional Review Board of Huazhong University of Science and
Technology approved this study (#TJ-IRB20200222). All pregnant women gave informed
consent to participate in this study.

LABORATORY CONFIRMATION
Based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (6th edition)
published by the National Health Commission of China7, those with one of the following
laboratory evidence is considered to have a confirmed Covid-19 case: (1) positive for
SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by real-time reverse-transcription–polymerase-chain-reaction
(RT-PCR); (2) viral gene sequencing showing highly homogeneity to the known
SARS-CoV-2. Real-time RT-PCR assays were performed following the protocol established
by the WHO8 .

DATA COLLECTION
We collected data of all pregnant women and newborns from electronic medical records with
data collection forms. If there were deficiencies in the data, we directly communicated with
the pregnant women and/or their family members by telephone to acquire additional
information. The information collected included demographic data, exposure history, past
medical history, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, chest computed tomographic (CT)

scans, and treatment received.
According to the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (6th
edition) published by the National Health Commission of China7, the clinical severity of
Covid-19 is classified into four levels: (1) Mild: Presence of mild clinical symptoms without
CT/X-ray abnormalities. (2) Moderate: Presence of fever or upper respiratory symptoms, and
CT/X-ray imaging consistent with pulmonary infection. (3) Severe: Presence of one of three
conditions: i) shortness of birth, and respiratory rate≥30 breaths per minute; ii) resting
Oxygen Saturation≤93%; iii) partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ≤
300mmHg. (4) Severe acute: Presence of acute respiratory distress and need for mechanical
ventilation, or presence of shock, or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of the
development of organ dysfunction.
Exposure history is defined as a history of travel to or residence in Wuhan or other cities
with continuous transmission of local cases in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms,
contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan or other cities with
continuous transmission of local cases in the last 14 days before the onset of symptom, or
being epidemiologically connected to SARS-CoV-2 infections or clustered onsets2.
The Pregnancy outcome was classified based on the gestational age at delivery (<37 weeks
or ≥37 weeks), mode of delivery (vaginal or cesarean section), indication for cesarean section,
and obstetrical complications. Information collected from newborns included birth weight,
Apgar score, neonatal death, tests for SARS-CoV-2, and manifestations of Covid-19. Low
birth weight was defined as a birth weight of less than 2,500 grams9. Very low birth weight
was defined as a birth weight of less than 1,500 grams9.

STUDY OUTCOMES
The primary composite endpoints were admission to an ICU, the use of mechanical
ventilation, or death. Secondary endpoints included the clinical severity of Covid-19, neonatal
mortality, admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and the incidence of acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of pregnant women or newborns.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Patient characteristics were presented using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables were
summarized using the mean and standard deviations, while categorical variables were
calculated using the frequency and percentage. All statistical analyses were performed using
SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
CHARACTERISTICS OF PREGNANT WOMEN
Our retrospective analysis revealed a total of 33 pregnant women with Covid-19 who were
admitted to 5 public hospitals in Hubei Province. The maternal age ranged from 24 to 36
years. Among the affected, there were 8 (24.2%) health care workers, and 32 (97%) of women
had a history of exposure. Three women were in the second trimester (17 weeks, 20 weeks,
and 26 weeks), and the other 30 women were in the third trimester at the time of presentation.
Fifteen (45.5%) women had chronic disorders involving cardiovascular and cerebrovascular,
digestive, endocrine, and nervous systems, as well as infectious diseases and depressive

disorders (Table 1).
Among the 33 pregnant women, the most common symptoms were fever (21[63.6%]), dry
cough (13 [39.4%]), fatigue (7 [21.2%]), and shortness of breath (7 [21.2%]). Less common
symptoms were diarrhea, post-partum fever, muscle ache, sore throat, chest pain, and
stomachache. Four (12.1%) pregnant women had no obvious symptoms. The clinical severity
of most women was mild (13[39.4%]) and moderate (19[57.6%]). Only one (3%) woman
proceeded to a severe type of COVID-19 (Table 1).
By chest CT, 13 (40.6%) women showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (43.8%) had showed
unilateral pneumonia, and 5 (15.6%) showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity
(Table 1).
Twenty-nine (87.9%) pregnant women required oxygen supplementation via a nasal
cannula or mask, and one (3%) patient needed noninvasive mechanical ventilation. All
women received antiviral therapy. Twenty-nine (87.9%) women were given antibiotic
treatment, 11 (33.3%) were treated with glucocorticoids, and 12 (36.4%) received traditional
Chinese medicine (Table 1).

MATERNAL OUTCOMES
Twenty-two (81.5%) women delivered via cesarean section, and 5(18.5%) had vaginal
deliveries. The overall rate of obstetrical complications was 22.2%, including three cases of
preterm premature rupture of membranes, two cases of hypertensive diseases of the pregnancy,
two cases of gestational diabetes mellitus, and one case of spontaneous preterm labor. As
February 20, 2020, five pregnancies were ongoing, and one woman decided to terminate her

pregnancy for personal reasons (Table 2).
By February 20, 2020, 9 (27.3%) women had been discharged while the remaining were
still hospitalized. No pregnant women proceeded to severe complications or were admitted to
the ICU, and there was no mortality.

NEONATAL OUTCOMES
There were 28 newborns born to 27 women, ten (35.7%) of whom were delivered preterm.
The 1-min Apgar score of all newborns ranged from 8-10. The 5-min Apgar score of all
newborns ranged from 9-10. All newborns were isolated after birth and fed by milk formula.
Five (17.9%) newborns had low birth weight, and no newborn had very low birth weight.
Four (14.3%) newborns were diagnosed with fetal distress. One newborn who was born at 34
weeks of gestation, was transferred to the NICU with a diagnosis of ARDS. At the end of the
follow-up, this newborn recovered and was discharged. No newborns had clinical symptoms
of Covid-19 or died (Table 3).
At the end of the follow-up, two newborns had not been tested for SARS-CoV-2 because
their parents asked to delay the test to 14 days after birth. Twenty-six newborns were tested
for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR assays of throat swabs. Among those, one newborn
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus yielding a perinatal transmission rate of 3.6%.
The mother of this newborn was sent to the hospital because of a fever. The mother wore N95
masks during the cesarean section. All medical staff wore protective suits. The newborn had
no contact with his mother and other family members. He was directly transferred to the
neonatal department and isolated immediately after birth. A throat swab from this mother was

collected for the nucleic acid test when she was admitted to the hospital. However, the result
was not reported until 36 h after birth because of the massive number of samples that needed
testing during the Covid-19 outbreak. Real-time RT-PCR showed that the mother was positive
for SARS-CoV-2 infection. At the same time, the throat swab sample was taken from the
newborn for a nucleic acid test, which also came back positive. In addition, the chest X-ray of
the newborn 53 h after birth was consistent with pulmonary infection. However, the cord
blood and placental samples were both negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The newborn had
no clinical manifestations of Covid-19. The newborn was retested and found to negative for
SARS-CoV-2 infection on days 4, 8, and 15 after birth as detected by the nucleic acid test of
the real-time RT-PCR of subsequent throat swabs. The chest X-ray of the newborn showed
that pulmonary infection had resolved. The newborn did not receive any treatment and was
discharged 16 days after birth.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we reported a case series of pregnant women with Covid-19 and newborns born
to these women. The primary composite endpoint occurred in one (3%) pregnant woman who
needed the use of mechanical ventilation, while no pregnant women admitted to the ICU or
died. For the secondary outcomes, the percentages of pregnant women with mild, moderate,
and severe symptoms were 13 (39.4%),19(57.6%), and 1(3%). One (3.6%) newborn
developed ARDS and was admitted to the NICU. There were no moralities among newborns.
There is limited knowledge regarding Covid-19 that occurs during pregnancy. What is
known has been bases on the experiences from two different coronaviruses, severe acute

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV)6,10,11. The clinical outcomes among pregnant women with SARS or
MERS were worse than those occurring in non-pregnant women6,10. However, our data
suggest the contrary to Covid-19. Among the 33 pregnant women with confirmed Covid-19,
39.4% of women presented mild, 57.6% presented moderate, and 3% presented with severe
symptoms. For most pregnant women (87.9%), oxygen therapy supplied via a nasal cannula
or mask was sufficient for supportive care. Only one (3%) pregnant woman needed the use of
mechanical ventilation. At the end of the follow-up, no pregnant women had severe
complications or needed to be transferred to the ICU or died. Compared with the general
population, in which 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who needed mechanical
ventilation, and 1.4% who died12, it seems that the severity and mortality rate of Covid-19 in
pregnant women are lower.
The risk of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was low, as only one out of 26
newborns was confirmed to have a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In our study, this newborn’s
SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by the detection of virus in throat swab and chest
X-ray abnormalities. However, we cannot prove that this is a case of vertical transmission
because the cord blood and placental samples were both negative for SARS-CoV-2.
How SARS-CoV-2 invades the human body remains a mystery. Xu et al. first reported that
SARS-CoV-2 shares 76.47% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV, and may use the
same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entry into target host cells13.
Zhao et al. found that ACE2 is specifically expressed in type II alveolar epithelial cells (AT2)
in human lung, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may target ACE2-positive AT2 cells to induce

pneumonia14. Further studies showed that ACE2 protein is abundantly present in humans in
the epithelia of the lung and small intestine15, heart16, arterial smooth muscle cells,
gastrointestinal system, renal tubules of kidney17 and testes 18, suggesting potential routes for
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urinary and male
reproductive systems. Thus, this newborn could have been infected from many possible paths,
such as via the respiratory system.
However, this newborn’s case may also be real vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 since
the mother wore N95 masks during the cesarean section, and all medical staff wore protective
suits. Furthermore, the newborn was isolated immediately after birth. These preventive
measures should have decreased the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the respiratory
system of the mother, medical staff, and hospital environment. Second, previous studies have
shown that ACE2 is expressed by the human endometrium and placenta

19,20

. A recent study

revealed that ACE2 is highly expressed in maternal-fetal interface cells, including stromal
cells and perivascular cells of decidua, and cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast in
placenta21. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 may also be attracted to the human endometrium and placenta
though ACE2, causing vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Also, the SARS-CoV-2 has
been detected in urine and stool22, suggesting a possibility of ascending infection of the uterus,
placenta, and fetus. Third, it has been reported that the ACE2-expressing cell ratio is variable
between individuals, which may explain why some people are more vulnerable to
SARS-CoV-214. This characteristic of ACE2 may explain why SARS-CoV-2 infected only
one out of 26 newborns.
Another novelty of our study, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of infected

newborns have never been reported. This 36-hour-old newborn is the youngest baby ever to
be reported with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, the newborn with SARS-CoV-2
infection did not have any clinical symptoms. He converted to seronegative in 2 days and
recovered without treatment. This limited information suggests that the newborns may
generally be resistant to infection with SAR-Cov-2 and, if infected, likely not suffer from
significant consequences.
During the SARS outbreak, Wong et al. evaluated the obstetrical outcomes from a cohort of
pregnant women with SARS in Hong Kong6. Four of the seven patients who presented in the
first trimester had a spontaneous miscarriage. Four of the five patients who presented after 24
weeks delivered preterm. Two mothers recovered without delivery, but their ongoing
pregnancies were complicated by intrauterine growth restriction6. In our study, we included
three women in the second trimester and 30 women in the third trimester at presentation.
Among the 33 women, 27 women delivered 28 newborns, and the live birth rate was 100%.
Five women had ongoing pregnancy without severe obstetrical complications at the time of
manuscript preparation. The overall rate of obstetrical complications was 22.2%, including
three cases of preterm premature rupture of membranes, two cases of hypertensive diseases of
the pregnancy, two cases of gestational diabetes mellitus, and one case of spontaneous
preterm labor. Therefore, the obstetrical outcomes from pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2
infection appear better than that for pregnant women with SARS. However, it’s worth noting
that most pregnant women were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the third trimester in this
study. The gestational age when women are infected may affect obstetrical outcomes.
In a review of 11 pregnant women with MERS-CoV infection, the infant death rate was

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041061; this version posted March 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

27%11. For SARS during pregnancy, the fetal/neonatal complications included preterm labor,
intrauterine growth restriction, intrauterine demise, and neonatal death 6. In this current study,
no newborn infants died. The preterm birth rate was 35.7%, and the rate of low birth weight
was 17.9%. Four (14.3%) of 28 newborn infants had signs of fetal distress. One newborn
infant who was born at 34 weeks developed ARDS and was admitted to the NICU. At the end
of the follow-up, this newborn infant had recovered and was discharged. Our experience
showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy might not be associated with as adverse
neonatal outcomes as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection during pregnancy.
The clinical features of Covid-19 in pregnant women has not yet been reported. In this
study, we report some clinical features of pregnant women with Covid-19: First, four (12.1%)
pregnant women had no apparent symptoms during hospitalization. However, they were
positive for SARS-CoV-2 by the real-time RT-PCR assay. This finding suggests that there are
some asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. Because asymptomatic
carriers of SARS-CoV-2 may transmit virus23, we recommend that all pregnant women should
be tested for SARS-CoV-2 during the Covid-19 outbreak. Second, in our study, five women
delivered babies by vaginal birth, and their newborns were negative for SARS-CoV-2. This
finding implies that vaginal delivery may not increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
to newborns. Therefore, Covid-19 should not be the sole indication for the cesarean section.
The timing and mode of delivery should depend on the gestational age, the maternal and fetal
condition.
This observational study consisted of 33 pregnant women and 28 newborns. Although this
report is the most extensive case series so far, the sample size is small. We caution our readers

to take this into account when interpreting the results and conclusions drawn from this study,
since some of the above observations may be due to chance occurrence. However, there is
currently no large series of pregnant women with confirmed Covid-19, so we believe that this
study will be useful for guiding us in the management of pregnant women with Covid-19 and
their newborns.
In conclusion, pregnant women are not at increased risk for severe illness or mortality with
Covid-19 compared with the general population. The SARS-CoV-2 infection during
pregnancy might not be associated with as adverse obstetrical and neonatal outcomes that are
seen with the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection during pregnancy. There appears to be a
low risk of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, we should not rule out the
potential risk of vertical transmission of SARS-COV-2.
