Abstract
Background:
To mitigate and slow the spread of COVID-19, many countries have adopted unprecedented
physical distancing policies, including the UK. We evaluate whether these measures might be
sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number (R0, the
average number of secondary cases generated per case).
Methods:
We asked a representative sample of UK adults about their contact patterns on the previous
day. The questionnaire documents the age and location of contacts and as well as a measure of
their intimacy (whether physical contact was made or not). In addition, we asked about
adherence to different physical distancing measures. The first surveys were sent on Tuesday
24th March, one day after a “lockdown” was implemented across the UK. We compared
measured contact patterns during the “lockdown” to patterns of social contact made during a
non-epidemic period. By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction number as
a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed. We used a meta-analysis of
published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions
were put in place.

Findings:
We found a 73% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant
(from 10.2 to 2.9). This would be sufficient to reduce R0 from 2.6 prior to lockdown to 0.62 (95%
confidence interval [CI] 0.37 - 0.89) after the lockdown, based on all types of contact and 0.37
(95% CI = 0.22 - 0.53) for physical contacts only.

Interpretation:
The physical distancing measures adopted by the UK public have substantially reduced contact
levels and will likely lead to a substantial impact and a decline in cases in the coming weeks.
However, this projected decline in incidence will not occur immediately as there are significant
delays between infection, the onset of symptomatic disease and hospitalisation, as well as
further delays to these events being reported. Tracking behavioural change can give a more

rapid assessment of the impact of physical distancing measures than routine epidemiological
surveillance.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Many governments have adopted physical distancing measures to mitigate the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is unclear to what extent these measures reduce the number
of contacts and therefore transmission. We searched PubMed and medRxiv on March 28,
2020, with the terms “(coronavirus OR COVID-19 OR influenza) AND ((school OR work) AND
(closure OR holiday)) AND (contact OR mixing)” and identified 59 and 17 results, respectively.
Only one study conducted in China during the COVID-19 pandemic reported a reduction in daily
contacts outside the home during the period of “lockdown”. We found no other published articles
that empirically quantify the impact of these measures on age- and location-specific mixing
patterns.

Added value of this study
By surveying adults’ behaviour in the UK during a period of stringent physical distancing
(“lockdown”) and comparing the results to previously collected data, we found a large reduction
in daily contacts particularly outside the home, resulting in a marked reduction in the estimated
reproduction number from 2.6 to 0.62 (95% bootstrapped confidence interval [CI] 0.37 - 0.89).
This method allows for rapid assessment of changes in the reproduction number that is
unaffected by reporting delays.

Implications of all the available evidence
Changes in human contact behaviour drive respiratory infection rates. Understanding these
changes at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic allows us to rapidly quantify the impact
of physical distancing measures on the transmission of pathogens.

Introduction
Over 600,000 cases and over 30,000 deaths from COVID-19 have been recorded worldwide as
of 28th of March 2020 1. In an attempt to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries
have adopted unprecedented physical distancing policies2. On the 23rd of March, with just over
6,000 confirmed cases, the UK Government implemented strict physical distancing measures
instructing individuals to stay at home and avoid leaving their house except for essential work,
to take one form of exercise a day, and to buy essential items such as food and medicines. This
followed the closure of sporting events, schools, restaurants, bars, gyms and other leisure or
hospitality-related businesses the previous week3 and an increase in social distancing among
the population that had been taking place for several days before the announcement4.
Physical distancing interventions attempt to reduce contacts relevant to infectious disease
spread between individuals. Multiple surveys have been instigated on the uptake of different
physical distancing measures during this current pandemic, but these have not explicitly
measured contacts between people 5–7. To make accurate predictions on the impact of these
measures, quantitative data on relevant contact patterns is required 8–11. Only one previous
survey—conducted in two Chinese cities, Wuhan and Shanghai, in February 2020—quantified
the impact of these measures on individuals’ contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic
12

. In this paper, we describe a survey of contact patterns and compliance with physical distance

measures and present results from a sample of adults in the UK. We evaluate whether these
measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the
reproduction number (the average number of secondary cases generated per case).

Survey methodology
We commissioned the market research company Ipsos to conduct a survey of UK adults
(referred to here as the CoMix survey). Adults (≥18 years) were recruited into the survey by
sending email invitations to existing members of their online panel. Representativeness of the
general UK population was ensured by setting quotas on age, gender, and geographical
location. This cohort of individuals will be requested to answer the survey every two weeks for a
total of 16 weeks to track changes in their self-reported behaviour. The first surveys were sent
on Tuesday 24th March, one day after a lockdown was announced for the UK.

Participants were asked about their attitudes towards COVID-19 and the effect of physical
distancing interventions, whether they or any of their household members experienced any
recent symptoms, whether they were tested for COVID-19, whether they had had any contact
with known COVID-19 cases and whether they were affected by physical distancing measures.
Participants reported (i) if any person in their household were advised to quarantine, isolate, or
limit time in their workplace or educational facility in the preceding seven days due to COVID19, and (ii) if they heeded the advice and isolated, quarantined, or stayed away from their
workplace or educational facility. In the survey, we defined quarantine as limiting contacts and
staying at home, with restricted allowance for movement outside the home after a potential
exposure with a COVID-19 case. We defined isolation as completely separating from uninfected
contacts, including household members, either in the home or in a health facility. To assess the
impact of advice and policy changes regarding physical distancing, we asked participants to
indicate if they had planned to participate in a set of events in the preceding week. For each
event type, they reported (i) whether they proceeded with their plan, or (ii) if it was cancelled or
they decided not to go, and (iii) the frequency of the event type in the previous seven days.
Additional questions were asked about preventive behaviours, such as hand washing or
wearing masks, and about the use of public transport in the previous seven days.

In addition, we asked participants to record all direct contacts made between 5 am the day
preceding the survey and 5 am the day of the survey. A direct contact was defined as anyone
who was met in person and with whom at least a few words were exchanged, or anyone with
whom the participants had any sort of skin-to-skin contact.

For every recorded contact, participants documented the age and gender of the contact,
relationship to the contact, the frequency with which they usually contact this person, whether
contact was physical (skin-to-skin) or not, and the setting where the contact occurred (e.g. at
home, work, school, or while undertaking leisure activities, etc), including whether contact
occurred in- or outside an enclosed building. Questions on social contacts were consistent with
those from the UK arm of the POLYMOD survey13, which was used as the baseline prepandemic comparison dataset. Details on survey methodology and a copy of the questionnaire
used are provided as supplementary material.

Statistical analysis
We grouped study participants and contacts into the following age bands 18-29, 30-39, 40-49,
50-59, 60-69, and 70+. Age, gender, and locations of participants were compared to the 2018
mid-year estimates provided by the UK Office of National Statistics (ONS) to assess the
representativeness of the study sample14. We descriptively analysed answers related to
symptoms, attitudes, exposure to physical distancing measures, and individual preventative
measures. We present the number and percentage or mean and standard deviation where
appropriate (Table 3).

We calculated the average number of social contacts per person per day overall, and stratified
by age category, sex, household size, location of contact, type of contact, and day of the week.
We then compared the mean total number of daily contacts by age group to POLYMOD
stratified by contact location.

We calculated social contact matrices for the age-specific daily frequency of direct social
contacts, adjusting for the age distribution in the study population and reciprocity of contacts,
using the socialmixr package in R15.

As children (<18 years) were not included as survey participants, we imputed contacts for
younger age groups (child-child and child-adult contacts) using the POLYMOD UK data.
Specifically, for those child contact groups that were missing, we used a scaled version of the
POLYMOD social contact matrix. Following previous methods developed by Klepac et al16, as
the scaling factor, we took the ratio of the dominant eigenvalues of the POLYMOD and CoMix

matrices, for all age groups present in both studies, stratified by setting. Furthermore, to reflect
school closures during the collection of our survey we removed school-contacts from the
POLYMOD data from our analysis.

The basic reproduction number, or R0, is the average number of secondary infections arising
from a typical single infection in a completely susceptible population, and can be estimated as
the dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix 17. The exact form of the next generation
matrix is model dependent. For respiratory infections, such as SARS-CoV-2 (the pathogen
causing COVID-19), this is usually a function of the age-specific number of daily contacts, the
probability that a single contact leads to transmission, and the total duration of infectiousness.
Therefore, R0 is proportional to the dominant eigenvalue of the contact matrix 15.
We assumed that contact patterns prior to physical distancing were similar to those observed in
the POLYMOD data, and that the duration of infectiousness and the probability that a single
contact leads to transmission did not change during the study period. Under these assumptions,
the relative reduction in R0 is equivalent to the reduction in the dominant eigenvalue of the
contact matrices. By multiplying the value of R0 prior to the interventions by the ratio of the
dominant eigenvalues from the POLYMOD and CoMix contact matrices, we were able to
calculate R0 under the physical distancing interventions. Prior to interventions we assumed R0
followed a normal distribution with mean 2.6 and standard deviation of 0.54 based on a metaanalysis of the literature presented in the supplementary material.

To assess uncertainty, we repeated the age imputation process by taking 10,000 bootstrapped
samples from both POLYMOD and CoMix matrices. For every bootstrap sample, we calculated
the ratio between the dominant eigenvalues for the sampled POLYMOD and CoMix matrices.
This sampling provided a distribution of relative change in R0 from the contact patterns observed
in POLYMOD and CoMix. Subsequently, we scaled the initial distribution of R0 with the
distribution of bootstrap samples to estimate R0 under physical distancing interventions.
Recent results of the BBC Pandemic study 16 suggested a decrease of nearly 50% in the
average number of contacts made by teenagers (13-18 years) compared with the POLYMOD
data. We assessed the sensitivity of our results to a potential reduction in contacts over time by
taking a conservative reduction of 50% between 5-18 year olds in the POLYMOD study, and
repeating our approach to estimate the reduction in R0.

Results
Participants characteristics
We surveyed 1,356 UK participants who recorded 3,849 contacts. The average age of
participants was 47.2 years (Standard Deviation (SD) = 15, Max = 86) and 45% (608/1,356)
were female (see table 1). The average household size was 3.1 (SD = 1.2, Max = 10). Data
were collected between Tuesday 24th and Thursday 26th of March 2020 inclusive. Participants
were recruited from across the UK. The sample included participants from London (16.5%),
North of England (16.0%), Midlands and East of England (26.5%), South of England (24.4%),
Wales (4.4%), Scotland (9.8%), and Northern Ireland (2.6%), while 116 participants did not
report their region (Table 1). Further details of participant demographics and the average
number of contacts stratified by age, gender, household size and location are presented in
Table 2. Compared to the mid-year ONS population estimates taken from 2018, individuals over
70 years and individuals between the ages of 20-29 year of age were undersampled.

Thirteen participants reported having been tested for COVID-19 with seven testing positive, and
two participants still waiting for their results. Forty-one participants stated they had been in
contact with a known COVID-19 case. In terms of perceived risk, 26.4% (359/1356) thought that
it was likely that they would develop coronavirus and 48.0% (652/1356) agreed or strongly
agreed that COVID-19 would be a serious disease for them if they acquired the infection.

Impact of physical distancing measures
Participants reported data on a total of 3,824 household members, including themselves, of
whom 508 (13.2%) had been asked to quarantine and 826 (21.6%) had been asked to isolate.
Nearly a quarter (921; 24.1%) of household members lived in a house with someone who had
at least one symptom of fever, aches, shortness of breath, or cough. Roughly 50% of the 2,122
employed individuals had either been asked to limit their time at work, had their work closed,
and/or did not visit their work in the preceding 7 days (Table 3). Of those household members
who attend educational establishments 67.2% (818/1217) had their institution closed with 63.3%
not visiting during the previous 7 days.

There were clear suggestions that physical distancing in the previous week had impacted
planned activities for survey participants with 32.5% of participants having to cancel plans to
visit a pub (Table 3). Contrastingly, only a small percentage of participants (2.5%) who intended
to go to the supermarket were unable due to COVID-19.

Contact patterns
The mean number of physical and non-physical contacts per person measured during this study
was 2.9 (IQR = 1-4) which was 73.1% lower than was measured in POLYMOD (10.8; 6-14). The
reduction in mean contacts between POLYMOD and CoMix was consistent across age, gender,
and household size (Table 2). The respective social contact matrices (including physical and
non-physical contacts) also reflected a much lower number of mean contacts across the age
strata as presented in Figure 1.

The majority of contacts (57.6%) occurred at home, contrasting with 33.7% reported in the
POLYMOD survey. Figure 2 displays the average number of contacts across age groups for all,
physical, home, work, school, and other contacts. The matrices are consistent with the majority
of contacts being in the home, with work, and other contributing very little to the overall number
of contacts.

Estimated the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 under
physical distancing
We estimated the current R0 under physical distancing measures to be 0.62 (95% confidence
interval [CI] 0.37 - 0.89) based on all types of contact (Figure 1). Based on physical contacts
only, we estimated R0 to be 0.37 (95% CI = 0.21 - 0.52). The average pre- to post-intervention
ratio in R0 was 0.24 (min =0.21 , max = 0.27) for all contacts and 0.14 (min = 0.12, max = 0.17)
for physical contacts only. Based on these values, the physical distancing measures would have
reduced the mean estimate of R0 to below one even if the initial R0 had been as high as 3.6
assuming all contacts are equally risky, or 4.2 assuming only physical contacts result in
transmission.

In a sensitivity analysis, reducing contacts made by 5-17 year olds by 50% resulted made little
difference to the results. Under this assumption the estimated value of R0 for all contacts would
be 0.69 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.98) and 0.37(CI 0.22 - 0.53) if physical contacts alone result in
transmission.

Discussion
The measures introduced by the UK Government appear to have high levels of uptake among
participants and have resulted in very large (73%) reductions in the total number of contacts. If
similar changes are observed across the UK population, we would expect the basic
reproduction number to now be below 1 (0.62; 95% CI 0.37 - 0.89), and that these physical
distancing measures will lead to a decline in cases in the coming weeks. However, this
projected decline in incidence will not result in an immediate decline in reported cases, as there
are significant delays between infection and the onset of symptomatic disease and
hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported. Hence, routine
surveillance data are unlikely to show a decline in cases for some time. However, by directly
measuring individuals' contact patterns and estimating the corresponding basic reproduction
number, we are able to rapidly quantify the impact of physical distancing on transmission.

The total number of daily contacts (mean of 3.1 per person) was significantly reduced compared
to patterns previously estimated in the POLYMOD study (10.7; excluding children <18 years
old) and more recently by the BBC Pandemic study (10.5; excluding under 13-year-olds)16. The
observed reduction appears to be unlikely due to chance given the large difference in average
contacts, and is consistent with a recent study conducted in Wuhan, China that estimated a
reduction in the average number contacts per day from 14.6 prior to the outbreak to 2.0 under
physical distancing interventions 12. While we are unaware of any directly comparable data from
the UK, our findings are certainly consistent with other reports from the UK of a dramatic
reduction in social contacts, with, for example, only half of respondents in one survey reporting
having the house at all in the past 24hrs4.

There are several limitations to this survey. Asking individuals to report their contacts from the
day before may result in recall bias. Moreover, individuals who are adhering to physical
distancing measures may have been more likely to respond to this survey, potentially resulting
in selection bias and in an overestimate of the impact of these measures. We were not able to

sample any children, so child-child contacts had to be imputed from comparison with a previous
survey.

We were not able to quantify any additional effect from the interventions on transmission, such
as reduction in infectiousness by increased handwashing. In addition, we were not able to
calculate the net reproductive number, R0, as we did not account for the proportion of the
population that is no longer susceptible. These could all reduce the net reproductive number to
values lower than estimated in our analysis.

Our analysis assumed that direct contacts are an appropriate proxy for effective contacts, and
thus that transmissibility is equal across age-groups (e.g. contact between a single infected
child and susceptible adult is as likely to result in transmission as contact between a single
infected adult and a susceptible adult). We further assume that the reduction in non-school
contacts in children is similar to that observed in adults. Furthermore, we assume that the
contact patterns prior to interventions are consistent and of similar magnitude. A recent study
has found significantly lower numbers of contacts reported by teenagers compared with the
POLYMOD survey16. Decreasing mixing among 5-17 years by 50%, whilst reducing the
magnitude of reduction in R0, did not affect the qualitative conclusions from the analysis.

This study is planned to continue in the UK for the next 15 weeks. Future analyses will be able
to explore changes in contact patterns during different interventions and may provide early
warning signs of changes in contact patterns due to interventions being lifted or decreasing
adherence with restrictions.

Conclusions
We have shown that behavioural monitoring can give a rapid insight into transmission of
COVID-19 and have provided the first evidence that the restrictions adopted by the UK
government have led to a decrease in transmission of COVID-19.

Table 3 shows compliances with different social distancing measures due to COVID-19. N
symptoms shows the total number of household members who were living in a household where
someone had any of the following symptoms: (fever, aches, shortness of breath, cough), and
how many individuals reported having COVID-19 symptoms themselves. The column Asked to
refers to the total number of people who reported being asked to quarantine or isolate. The
column Have been in shows the total number of people who reported having been in quarantine
or isolation for at least one day in the seven days before the survey.
