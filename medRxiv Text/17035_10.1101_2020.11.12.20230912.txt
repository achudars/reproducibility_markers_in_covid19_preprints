SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was low (<1%) in this large population of healthcare
workers (HCWs) across the state of Tennessee (n=11,787) in May-June 2020. Among
those with PCR results, 81.5% of PCR and antibody test results were concordant.
SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was higher among HCWs working in high-communitytransmission regions and among younger workers.

These results may be seen as a baseline assessment of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence
among HCWs in the American South during a period of growth, but not yet saturation, of
infections among susceptible populations. In fact, this period of May-June 2020 was
marked by the extension of renewed and sustained community-wide transmission after
mandatory quarantine periods expired in several more populous regions of Tennessee.
Where community transmission remains low, HCWs may still be able to effectively
mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission, preserving resources for populations at high risk of
severe disease, and these sorts of data help highlight such strategies.

Background

55

Infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)

56

causes coronavirus infectious disease from 2019 (COVID-19) (1) and is associated with

57

the development of a humoral immune response, measurable by the presence of

58

circulating immunoglobulins (Ig) G and M (2). Although the extent to which serological

59

status against SARS-CoV-2 correlates with immunity against future infection remains

60

uncertain (3), there is utility in using antibody testing to estimate the prevalence of

61

infection within select populations, including healthcare workers (HCWs) (4).

62
63

The first laboratory confirmed case of COVID-19 in Tennessee was reported on March

64

4th, 2020. By mid-June there had been more than 30,000 cases diagnosed statewide

65

(5). During this period, the Tennessee Department of Health partnered with healthcare

66

systems belonging to the Tennessee Public and Teaching Hospital Association to

67

estimate serological status of employees using a chemiluminescent immunoassay for

68

IgG against SARS-CoV-2 (6). “Frontline” HCWs and employees previously diagnosed

69

with COVID-19 were targeted.

70
71

Methods

72

Study population

73

HCWs ≥18 years of age were recruited and enrolled in the study between mid-

74

May, 2020 and mid-June, 2020 at Erlanger Health System (Chattanooga, TN), Ballad

75

Health (northeast TN), University of Tennessee Medical Center (UTMC, Knoxville, TN),

76

Vanderbilt Wilson County Hospital (Lebanon, TN) and Vanderbilt University Medical

77

Center (VUMC, Nashville, TN) sites (the latter two analyzed as VUMC). Ballad Health

78

sites encouraged testing of all HCWs with direct patient contact while other sites

79

recruited HCWs through convenience sampling among those in COVID-19 units,

80

emergency departments, outpatient COVID-19 testing sites, and other service areas

81

with high SARS-CoV-2 exposure probability.

82
83
84

Sample collection & laboratory methods
Whole blood specimens were collected and an immunoassay for qualitative

85

detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-directed IgG in human serum and

86

plasma was performed on these samples using the Abbott Architect i2000 with

87

chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay technology (7).

88
89
90

Outcomes
The primary outcome was positive IgG result, reported within 7 days of sample

91

collection. Among a sub-sample, PCR test results were self-reported on laboratory

92

requisition forms or extracted from a surveillance database within the Tennessee

93

Communicable and Environmental Diseases and Emergency Preparedness program.

94
95
96

Covariates
Dates of sample collection and result reporting were used to assess trends in test

97

volume. Outcomes and differences in age at the date of sample collection and sex

98

assigned at birth (male or female) were also summarized by study enrollment site (as

99

available).

Statistical analysis

102

Non-parametric tests were used to describe contrasts in categorical and

103

continuous variables across categorical variables such as serostatus, study site, and

104

sex. For differences in proportions, the Pearson χ2 test was used; for differences in

105

distributions, Wilcoxon rank-sum and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used. Age distributions

106

were illustrated by violin plots. Temporal trends in testing were illustrated by kernel

107

density plots using an epanechnikov kernel. Analyses were conducted using Stata

108

v.15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

Results

115

Among 11,787 individuals participating, most had study-related IgG tests

116

conducted in mid-May to mid-June 2020 (Figure 1a); 116 (0.98%) were seropositive for

117

SARS-CoV-2 by IgG, though the proportion IgG+ was significantly different across

118

facilities, with higher proportions IgG+ at UTMC and VUMC (1.3% and 2.6%,

119

respectively, vs. ≤1% everywhere else, χ2 p-value<0.001; Figure 1b).

121

Median ages among those testing IgG- and IgG+ were 40.3 (interquartile range [IQR]:

122

30.9, 52.4) and 32.4 (IQR: 26.5, 43.4) years, respectively (Kruskal-Wallis p-

123

value<0.001; Figure 2a).

124
125

Among 6,108 individuals with sex assigned at birth available, 77% were female and

126

23% male. There were no significant differences by sex, with 22.8% and 22.0% male

127

among IgG- and IgG+ participants, respectively (χ2 p-value=0.86).

128
129

Among 146 individuals who also had self-reported PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2, the

130

lapses between PCR and IgG test dates were available for 54 individuals. Among

131

participants with PCR test histories available, their first SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests

132

(whether PCR or IgG) were collected from early March 2020 through June 2020, with

133

most pre-study PCR testing done in mid-March and most IgG testing done in May; the

134

distribution of lapses showed most PCR testing preceded study-related IgG testing by

135

approximately 2 months (median lapse of 55 days).

136
137

Ages at sample collection were available for 143 individuals (97.9%) who had PCR test

138

history. In this group, median age was 41.1 (IQR: 28.2, 51.8) years among those who

139

were IgG- and 34.5 (IQR: 26.6, 47.6) years among those who were IgG+ (Figure 2b).

140
141

Among those ever PCR+, the proportion IgG+ was largely in agreement (percent

142

agreement=81.5%), though they were not completely concordant: 3 of 54 individuals

143

(5.6%) with test dates for both were IgG- even though they reported being PCR+ on ≥1

Discussion
In a broad sero-survey of nearly 12,000 HCWs in systems across Tennessee

149

during May-June 2020, the overall seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was low, approaching

150

1%. There was significant variation in seropositivity between healthcare systems, with

151

higher seropositivity among workers in larger urban centers in middle and eastern

152

Tennessee (Nashville and Knoxville). Seropositive persons were significantly younger

153

than seronegative individuals, though there were no sex differences.

154

The depth and breadth of the regional COVID-19 epidemic in the American

155

South had not yet made itself felt during the period of this particular sero-survey (8, 9).

156

A smaller seroprevalence study (including 249 HCWs) from Nashville, conducted in

157

April, 2020, found a higher seroprevalence (7.6%) but focused on high-risk hospital

158

settings and detected any immunoglobulin isotype, including IgM, IgG, and IgA (10).

159

These results may be seen as a baseline assessment of SARS-CoV-2

160

seroprevalence among HCWs in the American South during a period of growth, but not

161

yet saturation, of infections among susceptible populations. In fact, this period of May

162

was marked by the extension of renewed and sustained community-wide transmission

163

after mandatory quarantine periods expired in several more populous regions of

164

Tennessee (5). Though the statewide average of newly detected infections was 5.49

165

per 100,000, Davidson county (middle Tennessee, home to VUMC) saw 10-20 new

166

cases per 100,000 population; by contrast, Knox (northeast Tennessee, home to Ballad

167

Health and UTMC) and Hamilton (southeast Tennessee, home to Erlanger Health

168

System) counties saw only 1-5 new cases per 100,000 population in the same period.

169

As may be expected, these pronounced regional differences in community transmission

170

were reflected in differing levels of seropositivity among the corresponding HCW

171

populations.

172

There were limitations in this study. First, differences in sampling schemes

173

across health systems, and the voluntary participation of particular health systems, may

174

render this study population not representative of the entire population of HCWs in the

175

state of Tennessee, limiting generalizability. There also may have been outcome

176

misclassification present, as no test, has perfect diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (7).

177

Finally, this study did not have information on social network structures or other

178

characteristics to identify high-risk groups for SARS-CoV-2 exposure and transmission

179

among HCWs.

180

Seroprevalence patterns among HCWs, inherently at higher risk of exposure,

181

might change as local and regional epidemics evolve and might be impacted by disease

182

activity in the community, exposure mitigation efforts, personal protective equipment

183

supplies, and public health policies (quarantines, mask mandates, etc.). The nature of

184

SARS-CoV-2 transmission merits continued monitoring in this population in both the

185

long and short-term.
