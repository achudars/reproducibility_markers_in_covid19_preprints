Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), previously known as 2019-nCoV, is
responsible for the atypical pneumonia pandemic designated as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The number of cases continues to grow exponentially reaching 492,000 people in 175 countries as of
March 25, 2020. 22,169 people (~4.5%) infected with SARS-COV-2 virus have died. We have
developed an exponential regression model using the COVID-19 case data (Jan 22 ‚Äì Mar 22, 2020). Our
primary model uses designated Phase 1 countries, who exceed 2500 cases on Mar 22. The model is then
applied to Phase 2 countries: those that escaped the initial Phase 1 global expansion of COVID-19.
With the exception of stabilizing countries (South Korea, Japan, and Iran) all Phase 1 countries are
growing exponentially, as per ùêº2500 (ùë°) = 120.4 √ó ùëí 0.238ùë° , with a rate, r = 0.238 ¬± 0.068. Excluding
China, the BRICS developing nations and Australia are in Phase 2. Case data from Phase 2 countries
are following the model derived from Phase 1 countries. In the absence of measures employed to flatten
the curve including social distancing, quarantine, and healthcare expansion, our model projects over
274,000 cases and 12,300 deaths in the US by Mar 31. India can expect 123,000 cases by April 16. By
flattening the curve to the growth rate of stabilizing countries (r = 0.044 ¬± 0.062), the US would prevent
8,500 deaths by Mar 31, and India would prevent 5,500 deaths by April 16.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), previously known as 2019-nCoV, is a
novel virus in the coronaviridae family of positive sense, enveloped, RNA viruses1. It is responsible for
the atypical pneumonia pandemic designated as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), by the World
Health Organization. First identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, COVID-19 has spread to 175
countries/territories, with over 492,000 cases as of March 25, 20202,3. During this period, there has been
a stepwise escalation of international, national, and regional governmental responses. The Wuhan
Government confirmed that local hospitals were treating 27 cases of viral pneumonia on December 31,
20194. However, approximately three weeks later, on January 20, the United States confirmed its first
case5. Due to the rapid expansion of cases across the world, the World Health Organization (WHO)
designated COVID-19 as Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 20206. On
the same day, India confirmed its first case in the state of Kerala7.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issuing a travel alert to the Wuhan
region on January 6, 20208. Various countries systematically blocked international travel from known
COVID-19 hot-spots, including China, Iran, and the European Union. At the time of writing, nearly 80
nations have a global travel ban with an additional 9 implementing global quarantine measures9. These

efforts hope to prevent local seeding of infection, each of which can rapidly increase case numbers.
When examining smaller confined communities exposed to SARS-COV-2, the disease spreads
unabated. Initial studies examined high-density exposed cohorts, including cruise ships, prisons, nursing
homes, and healthcare workers10‚Äì13. Therefore, it appears that containment of COVID-19 primarily be
mitigated by preventing local seeding through travel restriction and reducing the population density
around potential infected person.
A wide array of models exists for the predicting the spread of infectious disease across various cohorts.
These models may be stochastic in nature, creating probability distributions by moving about random
variables, or deterministic in nature, compartmentalizing the population across various groups. The
Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) model is a widely utilized mathematical model in the
COVID-19 outbreak14. Liu et al reviewed the models of 12 studies which calculated the basic
reproductive number (R0) of the SARS-COV-2 virus15. The studies examined employed various
techniques of subdividing the population and utilizing historical data of related diseases (i.e. SARS,
MERS) to estimate the potential impact of COVID-19. While these models help simulate the possible
course of a disease given population and disease characteristics, each model becomes outdated as
various governments implement restrictions on its population. Infectious disease dynamics are
classically considered as exponential in nature. However, Maier and Brockmann demonstrate that
COVID-19 is affected by ‚Äúfundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological
models‚Äù16. This is notably true in early phases of disease expansion. Consequentially, COVID-19‚Äôs
behavior warrants the examination of models outside of inductive logic.
The authors of this paper seek to understand the expansion of COVID-19 through a deductive
examination of existing case data. Our study examines this pandemic through data provided by the Johns
Hopkins University‚Äôs Systems Science and Engineering Group (JHU CSSE)17. Our approach is
inherently simplistic as it examines COVID-19 case numbers first. This deductive ‚Äòoutside-in‚Äô
observational approach allows us to derive models without consideration of ever-changing population
dynamics reflective of health policy measures being implemented. We seek to apply our model to
nations which have avoided the initial expansion of COVID-19. In this study, we model the pandemic‚Äôs
impact on the United States and BRICS developing nations. India‚Äôs 657 cases, as of March 25, represent
ample seeding, priming the nation for a devastating expansion of cases and fatalities.

Methods and Results
Raw Data - COVID-19 Case Numbers
The pandemic case data is provided by JSU CSSE‚Äôs GitHub repository on COVID-19. It is an
aggregation of case data starting on January 22, 2020, from several sources17. Cases in the data set
include laboratory confirmed cases and presumptive cases of COVID-19.
Sampled Data:
‚Ä¢ Phase 1 Countries: All countries reporting greater than 2500 cases as of March 22, 2020
‚Ä¢ Members of the Group of 7 (G7): Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK, US
‚Ä¢ Members of the BRICS developing nations: Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa
‚Ä¢ Developed nations of interest in Phase 2: Australia

We include a series of countries into our data set for comparative purposes. We designate Phase 1
countries as those who exceed 2500 cases of COVID-19 as of March 23, 2020. These countries, which
suffered the initial global expansion of SARS-COV-2, provide a working example for countries who
recently acquired the virus. We also include members of the Group of 7 (G7) to examine differences
between developed and Phase 1 countries. We include BRICS countries as an example of large,
developing countries likely to become part of Phase 2. The Phase 2 countries are hypothesized to
acquire SARS-COV-2 either through direct seeding from the epicenter, China, or via secondary seeding
from Phase 1 countries. We include Australia as a nation of interest, due to its developed status,
geographic proximity to China, and relative escape from Phase 1.

Excluding Data Prior to the 100th Case Per Country
In the early expansion of COVID-19 within each country, cases primarily expanded from international
seeding from China, rather than internal human-to-human spread. The sporadic nature of these cases
spreading around the world can be visualized through notable sub-exponential, erratic growth patterns,
within a country. After a country reaches its 100th case, the disease load increases exponentially (Figure
1). The time it takes to exceed 100 cases also demonstrates substantial variation (Figure 2).

placed indicating 100 cases. Below the line, we note sub-exponential, erratic growth patterns. During this time, cases
primarily expand from international seeding, rather than internal human-to-human spread. Therefore, we exclude data

Figure 2: Days to exceed 100 cases of COVID-19 from January 22, 2020. The JHU CSSE data set starts on January 22,
2020. From this date, we count the number of days each country takes to exceed 100 COVID-19 cases. The initial expansion
is primarily from international seeding, rather than internal human-to-human spread. Countries which reached 100 cases
likely have greater international travel with China. For the countries shown, the number of days to reach 100 cases has a
mean of 40 days, with standard deviation 6.4 days.

Of the countries already exceeding 2500 cases, the mean time to exceed 100 cases is 40 days, with
standard deviation 6.3 days, calculated from Jan 22, 2020. The high variance in data supports excluding
the first 100 cases from the modeling equations.

Model 1: All countries reporting greater than 2500 cases as of March 23, 2020
Model 2: G7 countries

Exclusion Criteria for the Predictive Model
We exclude four countries: China, Iran, Japan, and South Korea. China is excluded due to notably
unreliable data and changed its methodology. Numerous reports exist demonstrating the suppression of
case data by Chinese authorities18‚Äì20. Iran, Japan, and South Korea are excluded as outliers, which
approached the stationary phase of COVID-19 early in the timeline (Figure 3).

Figure 3: Cases of COVID-19 in Stabilizing Countries. We isolate Iran, Japan, and South Korea from Fig. 1. On a
logarithmic scale graph, the rate of exponential growth is visualized by the slope of the curve. These countries obtained early
COVID-19 expansion reduction, noted by a significant change in slope. They are excluded from the modeling equations.

Creating a Predictive Model
Eleven countries pass the inclusion and exclusion criteria. For each of them, an exponential regression is
applied, as per the function:
ùêº(ùë°) = ùëÅ √ó ùëí ùëüùë°
where I is the number of infected cases at a time t in days, N is the initial case load, r is the rate of
growth. The results are reported in Tables 1-3Table 1. We then average the values for N and r,
producing:
ùêº2500 (ùë°) = 120.4 √ó ùëí 0.238ùë°
Model Equation 1: Countries Exceeding 2500 cases of COVID-19

ùêºùê∫7 (ùë°) = 122 √ó ùëí 0.245ùë°
Model Equation 2: Group of 7 (G7) Countries. Japan is excluded from the model due as it meets the exclusion criteria.

Figure 4 presents our primary model, I2500, with 95% confidence intervals and case data of Phase 1
countries. We aligned the data from each Phase 1 country, such that t = 1 day when the number of cases
is closest to, but greater than 100. The 95% confidence intervals continue to contain the trajectories of
nearly all Phase 1 countries beyond Mar 22.

the 100-case cutoff at varying rates. Many reasons exist for early variation in case detection, including, but not limited to, differences in international seeding from
China, testing capabilities, healthcare systems, public health policy, including quarantine measures.

Figure 5: Projection of COVID-19 expansion on Phase 2 BRIAS countries. This group of countries includes the
large developing nations of Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa. We have additionally included Australia as a
country of interest, which escaped the initial international expansion of COVID-19.

Applying the Model to Developing Nations
We have excluded the SARS-COV-2 source nation of China from the BRICS countries for future
modeling. We hypothesize that these major developing countries escaped the first phase of
global COVID-19 expansion due to reduced seeding. With a smaller amount of air travel
between China and the other BRICS countries, the time to reach the 100th case will fall later in
the pandemic‚Äôs timeline. Next, we fit the equation, ùêº2500 (ùë°) = 120.4 √ó ùëí 0.238ùë° , to each country
(Figure 5). For t=1 day, the model projects 152 cases. Thus, we start the model for each country
on the date with number of COVID-19 cases closest to 152.
The actual number of infected persons will be affected by statistical uncertainties. We use our fit
and standard deviation in the fitted parameter to estimate the range of growth at ¬± 1œÉ and 2œÉ
levels for India. We expect all Phase 2 countries to have a similar band of cases (Figure 6).

COVID-19 expands at the same rate as Phase 1 countries. Existing case data is plotted with red markers.

Modeling the Impact of Stabilizing Expansion
For theoretical consideration, we examine what would happen if a country could instantaneously
shift from the Phase 1 growth rate to that of the stabilizing countries, starting March 26, 2020.
ùê∂ùëÉ‚Ñéùëéùë†ùëí 1 (ùë°) = ùëÅ25‚àíùëÄùëéùëü √ó ùëí 0.238ùë°

Model Equations 3 and Model Equation 4: ùëÅ25‚àíùëÄùëéùëü as the number of cases in a country on March 25 and t is the
number of days after March 25. The growth rates are derived from Tables 1 and 3, respectively.

The estimated case fatality rate (CFR) of the COVID-19 is 4.51%, based on arithmetic division
of fatalities to known cases17. We can then estimate the number of preventable deaths when if a
country instantly stabilized its growth to that of South Korea, Japan, and Iran.

stabilizing countries.

Discussion
Through our examination of COVID-19‚Äôs expansion around the world, we draw several
conclusions on the intrinsic nature of SARS-COV-2 and the impact of human intervention to
curtail its spread. First, we note that most countries affected in the Phase 1 growth of disease
follow exponential growth curves with comparable rates. Norway exhibits the minimum rate at
0.191, while the United States has the greatest at 0.295. The mean rate of expansion of Phase 1
countries is 0.238 (95% CI 0.170-0.306). For G7 countries, the mean rate of expansion is 0.245
(95% CI 0.184-0.306). Thus, we observe that G7 nations follow closely with other Phase 1
nations in COVID-19 cases.
When compared with the three stabilized countries of Iran, Japan, and South Korea, we notice
more troubling picture. The average rate of growth of stabilized countries is in excess of 5 times
less than the rate of growth of Phase 1 and G7 countries. If the US follows I2500, we expect over
119,000 cases by Mar 31. More concerning, though, is that the US is growing one standard
deviation above I2500. The cases based on ùê∂ùëÉ‚Ñéùëéùë†ùëí 1 is over 274,000 by Mar 31. If it were possible
to instantaneously change to the rate of growth calculated for stabilized countries, the expansion
of COVID-19 would be limited to approximately 85,800. If we apply the CFR to ùê∂ùëÉ‚Ñéùëéùë†ùëí 1 of the
United States, we expect in excess of 12,300 fatalities resulting from COVID-19 by March 31.
Applying the same CFR to ùê∂ùëÜùë°ùëéùëèùëñùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë , we expect about 3,800 deaths. If the United States
implements the measures noted in South Korea, Japan, and Iran, approximately 8,500 of deaths
could be prevented.
The Phase 2 nations we examined, Australia plus the developing nations of Brazil, Russia, India,
and South Africa, have a unique opportunity to compare the differences between the stabilized
nations and expanding Phase 1 nations. India, the second most populous country in the world,
has a population density over 3 times greater than that of China (454 vs 145 persons per square
kilometer)21. This is far greater than the remaining Phase 2 nations, indicating the greatest
potential for COVID-19 expansion. If India expands as per ùê∂ùëÉ‚Ñéùëéùë†ùëí 1 , we expect approximately
123,000 cases, resulting in over 6,800 fatalities, by April 25. However, if India expands as per
ùê∂ùëÜùë°ùëéùëèùëñùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë , we expect 1,745 cases. Given the high attack rate and rapid spread of COVID-19 in
densely populated, confined areas such as cruise ships, prisons, and hospitals, I2500 may
underestimate India if its dense urban population interacts normally. However, if India
successfully executes its 21-day lockdown on its 1.3 billion people, we calculate approximately
5,500 lives saved by April 16.
Our model may prove to be optimistic when considering the application of Phase 1 Country‚Äôs
largely developed healthcare systems with those of the Phase 2 developing countries. South
Africa, Brazil, India, and have 2.8, 2.2, and 0.7 hospital beds per 1000 people, respectively.
Though closer to Iran‚Äôs 1.5 hospital beds per 1000 people, they are far below Japan and South
Korea with 13.4 and 11.5, respectively22. Therefore, even with robust laboratory testing and
quarantine measures, we must prepare for greater COVID-19 growth in developing countries. It
is equally important to note that South Korea has a population density in excess of India (530 vs

347 people per square kilometer. Therefore, a country‚Äôs ability to manage COVID-19 is not
primarily limited by population or population density.
Looking forward, we advise countries to rapidly implement policies to augment the spread of
COVID-19. The exponential spread of disease is difficult to intuitively explain to the general
population. In everyday life, we encounter arithmetic changes more often than exponential
changes. Our instinct of examining relatively manageable changes to the case load to make
policy decisions will quickly be eclipsed by the exponential expansion of this disease. Further
complicating the matter is an estimation that 17.9% of COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic23.
Looking at the data from the Diamond Princess cruise line, most of the cases occurred before or
around the start of the quarantine. This reemphasizes the importance to make proactive, as
opposed to reactive, policy decisions. It additionally demonstrates the importance of individual
responsibility towards social distancing and personal hygiene. Should countries integrate the
methods behind the success noted in South Korea, Japan, and Iran, thousands, perhaps millions,
of deaths be prevented.

Limitations
It is important to consider the significant limitations of this preliminary study. First, our model
assumes continuous, regular exponential growth. Disease epidemics ultimately follow a
sigmoidal shape, as they approach the carrying capacity of the disease. SEIR models account for
a decreasing susceptible population and increasing recovered population with immunity. These
models prove to be superior in long term analysis of a disease‚Äôs expansion. It is most likely that
our model is only applicable for the initial exponential expansion of a disease. For COVID-19,
we caution its usage beyond 60 days after initial seeding of 100 cases.
The data collected by the JHU CSSE is impacted by the reporting capabilities of each country.
Subclinical cases are improbable to detect through surveillance screening due to lack of
laboratory resources in most countries. Such cases would be entirely missed as presumptive
cases, as these patients would not report to a healthcare facility. As mentioned earlier, the
presumptive asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 positive population is 17.9%23. Beyond sub-clinical
cases, governments are instructing mildly symptomatic patients to quarantine at home rather than
seek hospital care. These cases would also avoid detection and registration in the data set.
The model equations serve to average the differences between healthcare systems, hospital bed
per capita, laboratory testing capabilities, population dynamics, etc. When applying the model to
any given country in initial phase of growth (<60 days after 100 cases), though, these differences
are expected to exert considerable influence on COVID-19‚Äôs growth rate. This further
emphasizes the caution to utilize this model beyond the initial expansion of the disease.
