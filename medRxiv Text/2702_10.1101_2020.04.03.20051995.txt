Abstract
Background: COVID-19 originated in China and has quickly spread worldwide causing a pandemic.
Countries need rapid data on the prevalence of the virus in communities to enable rapid containment.
However, the equipment, human and laboratory resources required for conducting individual RT-PCR is
prohibitive. One technique to reduce the number of tests required is the pooling of samples for analysis by
RT-PCR prior to testing.
Methods: We conducted a mathematical analysis of pooling strategies for infection rate classification
using group testing and for the identification of individuals by testing pooled clusters of samples.
Findings: On the basis of the proposed pooled testing strategy we calculate the probability of false alarm,
the probability of detection, and the average number of tests required as a function of the pool size. We
find that when the sample size is 256, using a maximum pool size of 64, with only 7.3 tests on average,
we can distinguish between prevalences of 1% and 5% with a probability of detection of 95% and
probability of false alarm of 4%.
Interpretation: The pooling of RT-PCR samples is a cost-effective technique for providing much-needed
course-grained data on the prevalence of COVID-19. This is a powerful tool in providing countries with
information that can facilitate a response to the pandemic that is evidence-based and saves the most lives
possible with the resources available.

Research in context

Evidence before this study
The pooling of RT-PCR samples has been shown to be effective in screening for HIV,
Chlamydia, Malaria, and influenza, among other pathogens in human health. In agriculture, this
method has been used to assess the prevalence of many pathogens, including Dichelobacter
nodosus, which causes footrot in sheep, postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, and
antibiotic resistance in swine feces, in addition to the identification of coronaviruses in multiple
bat species. In relation to the current pandemic, researchers in multiple countries have begun to
employ this technique to investigate samples for COVID-19.
Added value of this study
Given recent interest in this topic, this study provides a mathematical analysis of infection rate
classification using group testing and calculates the probability of false alarm, the probability of
detection, and the average number of tests required as a function of the pool size. In addition the
identification of individuals by pooled cluster testing is evaluated.
Implications of all the available evidence
This research suggests the pooling of RT-PCR samples for testing can provide a cheap and
effective way of gathering much needed data on the prevalence of COVID-19 and identifying
infected individuals in the community, where it may be infeasible to carry out a high number of
tests. This will enable countries to use stretched resources in the most appropriate way possible,
providing valuable data that can inform an evidence-based response to the pandemic.

The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, has become a
rapidly emerging threat that has spread throughout the world. With a crude case fatality rate of
5.2%,1 COVID-19 poses the highest risk for serious disease and death in the over 65 year-old
population.2 Current early stage models predict that the virus will continue to spread in the
coming months and many health systems will be overwhelmed.3 However, these models require
data on a large scale to inform an evidence-based reaction to COVID-19 that uses limited
resources as effectively as possible on a rapid timescale.
Tracking the spread of COVID-19 is essential to mounting an effective public health response,
understanding the current impact of the virus, and ensuring that health systems are prepared. The
most accurate way of identifying COVID-19 is through the use of reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction or RT-PCR on samples.4 However, facilities for RT-PCR are limited,
even in high-income countries, and further, test costs are high both in terms of consumables and
trained technicians. Delays in testing have slowed the public health response in Europe and the
United States, and challenges to testing in low- and middle-income countries are even greater.
Many countries in which transmission of COVID-19 is occurring in the community are in the
acceleration phase and data describing community prevalence of the virus is much needed.
Given limitations in public health capacity, it is essential to identify high-risk clusters of infected
individuals while in the stage of community containment. In the absence of sufficient RT-PCR
capacity, we propose an alternative that may provide this essential data in a way that is coursegrained but at lower cost using the pooling of samples from multiple patients and performing
RT-PCR on this combined sample.5‚Äì8 If the test is negative, this implies that no one in the pool is
infected and if the test is positive, it may be concluded that at least one person in the pool is
infected. Pooling and group testing can be very effective in reducing the number of tests required
to both identify infected people in a population and to estimate the infection rate in a population.
Another benefit of this method is that it is likely to reduce testing time as fewer samples need to
be prepped and put through the RT-PCR process. This technique has been shown to be effective
in screening for bacteria, parasites and viruses in human health, including HIV, 5 Chlamydia,9
Malaria,9 and influenza.7 In the agricultural sector, where cost-effectiveness is essential to
efficient food production, the epidemiology of various pathogens, including Dichelobacter
nodosus, which causes footrot in sheep,10 postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome,11 and
antibiotic resistance in swine feces12 has been measured using this method. Pooled sampling and
testing via PCR has also been used to successfully identify coronaviruses in multiple bat
species.13
Infection rate classification using group testing
Group testing can be very beneficial in reducing the number of tests required to assess whether
the infection rate in a population is low or high. We conducted a mathematical analysis of pooled
sample testing in which a group of ùëÅ people is randomly selected from the region and split into ùêø
subpools, each of size ùëÅ/ùêø. A subpool is infected if at least one person within it is carrying the
virus. Then, we perform group testing using binary splitting at the subpool level to determine the
number of subpools that are infected. We set a threshold ùëâ, whereby if ùëâ or fewer subpools are

infected, we accept the low rate of infection, and if more than ùëâ subpools are infected, we accept
the high rate of infection.
For example, let‚Äôs take a low rate of 1% and a high rate of 5%. We choose ùëÅ = 64 people from
a region and form ùêø = 4 subpools labeled S1, S2, S3, and S4.This number has been selected as
the maximum number of samples per pool as previous work from other groups suggests it is
possible to detect a single positive sample in a pooled sample of 64.16 Finally, we choose our
threshold ùëâ to be 1. Our group testing procedure is shown in the flowchart in Error! Reference

Figure 1. Flowchart showing the binary splitting procedure.
The initial test, T1, is performed by pooling the samples from all four subpools, S1, S2, S3, and
S4. If the result of T1 is negative, we accept the low rate of infection. If the result of T1 is
positive, we perform two more tests, T2 (containing samples S1 and S2) and T3 (containing
samples S3 and S4). If the results of both T2 and T3 are positive, we accept the high rate of
infection. If the result of only one test, T1 or T2, is positive, then we perform two more tests by
breaking that pool into two smaller subpools. For example, if the result of T2 is positive, then we
perform two more tests, T4 on sample S3 and T5 on sample S4. If the result of only one test, T4 or
T5, is positive, then we accept the low infection rate. If the results of both tests are positive, we
accept the high infection rate.
We can analyze the probability of false alarm, the probability of detection, and the average
number of tests required. The distribution of the number of infected subpools, the chosen
hypothesis, and the number of tests required in each case are shown in Table 1 for four subpools
(ùêø = 4).

Table 1 describes the number of tests required depending how many subpools are infected. When
there are two infected subpools three or five tests are required. For example, if samples S1 and
S2 are infected, five tests are required; whereas if S1 and S3 are infected, only 3 tests are
required. When the number of people being tested, ùëÅ, is large, the result of the initial test of all
pooled samples, T1, will be positive with high probability whether the infection rate is low or
high. In this case, testing the all pooled samples together will not be very informative and this
test can be skipped to directly start with tests at the next level, namely T2 and T3. This strategy
will reduce the number of tests without affecting the probability of false alarms or the probability
of detection.
An important difference between the strategy suggested here and conventional binary splitting is
that here we perform binary splitting only until we are able to ascertain if the number of infected
subpools is greater than the threshold, ùëâ, or not; we do not necessarily infer all the infected
subpools. Hence fewer tests are required on average compared to conventional binary splitting.
The probability of false alarm, the probability of detection, and the average number of tests
required are shown in Figure 1 as a function of the sample size, with samples divided into eight
pools and a threshold of 4 (i.e. ùêø = 8, ùëâ = 4). The maximum pool size used for the tests is 64.
The probability of detection increases with sample size, however the probability of false alarm is
also increased. Figure 2 shows the tradeoff between the probability of detection and the
probability of false alarm for two sets of parameters.

probability of false alarm for three sets of parameters.
This method of pooling samples has the potential to dramatically reduce the number of tests to be
performed and this is likely to be associated with a substantial reduction in costs. In addition, as
the sample size grows, it becomes easier to distinguish between high and low prevalence rates.
When the sample size is of the order of 1000s, the probability of false alarm and probability of
detection are greatly reduced. For example, given 256 samples and a number of samples per pool
of 64, just 7.3 tests are needed on average to differentiate 1% prevalence from 5% prevalence
with a probability of detection of 95% and a probability of false alarm of 4%. Further examples
are provided in Table 2.

Identification of infected individuals by pooled sample testing
Next we turn to the use of pooled testing to identify infected individuals. There are many options
for constructing sets of pools.14 One of them is the use of a binary search tree,15 particularly
when the prevalence of COVID-19 is low. Samples may be collected in a cluster of say 32
individuals from households in close vicinity, packed and labelled individually and mapped
locally by healthcare workers. In the laboratory, each cluster of samples is divided into two
groups. The total number of samples in each group should typically be the largest power of 2 that
gives the lowest acceptable sensitivity for the given test ‚Äì either RT-PCR or next-generation
sequencing (NGS), which is reported to have higher sensitivity for COVID-19.
To use the example case of a cluster of 32 samples, the group of samples pooled together shall be
16 each. Given the COVID-19 outbreak in a locality is spatially clustered, each batch or cluster
of samples should consist of individual samples from houses in close vicinity to each other. This
can be arranged by mapping the locality or the urban slum, plotting the households, and making
sure that the samples are taken from contiguous clumps of households. After thoroughly mixing
the samples individually, defined quantities of 16 samples may be pooled through a common
appropriate membrane filter, and the filtrate reconstituted and tested by RT-PCR or NGS. If the
pooled sample tests negative, none of the individual samples in that batch are infected. If the
pooled sample tests positive, it is equally divided into two batches of half the original size, and
these are tested again in the same manner.
Considering the maximum kit requirement situation, if there is nobody infected in the population
cluster of 32 individuals, it will be detected in a single test. If there is a single infected individual
among the cluster of 32, then the number of tests required will vary between 5 and 10 assuming a

maximum pool size of 16. In minimum kit requirement situations, the kit requirements will be
even smaller.
Discussion
For evolving and novel outbreaks of infectious diseases like COVID-19, widespread individual
tests are not only costly but also time consuming. Pooling of samples can help accelerate the
surveillance for COVID-19 identification in a community or group of people living together. If
found positive, tracing back to the individual(s) can be done by a pooled sampling exercise. In
some countries this technique is already being used to make COVID-19 testing more costeffective. In Israel, researchers at Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology and Rambam Health
Care Campus successfully identified a positive carrier from a pooled analysis of 64 samples. 16 In
the US, the Nebraska Public Health Lab pooled 60 samples obtained from across the state. 17
These samples were tested in groups of five, and two groups were found to be positive. The
samples from each positive group were then tested individually to identify positive carriers and
the use of this technique halved the consumption of reagents. Blood banks commonly use pooled
testing, combining 4 to 24 samples in each test and rising to 96 combined specimens when
testing plasma fractionation. Pooled testing for COVID-19 could be combined with nucleic acid
testing, to screen blood donations and reduce the risk of transfusion transmitted infections, with
improved accuracy.
Methods using NGS are highly sensitive to the identification of microbes, even in pooled
samples.18 To date, a total of 226 SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2) sequences have been submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
GeneBank.19 NGS enables the identification of different strains present in the pool accounting
for the contribution of different individual samples, which is not possible with RT-PCR. In the
case of SARS, individual tracheal aspirate, a high-risk aerosol generating procedure, had the
highest diagnostic yield by RT-PCR, followed by stool samples. Pooled throat and nasal swabs,
rectal swab, nasal swab, throat swab, and nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens provided only a
moderate yield. Procedures for the collection of stool and pooled nasal and throat swab
specimens were the least hazardous, and the combination gave the highest yield for coronavirus
detection by RT-PCR.20 For community surveillance of respiratory pathogens among adults and
children, self-collected gargle samples have been found to be comparable or even more sensitive
than throat swab samples with lower detectable Ct values in RT-PCR21, 22 and less bio-hazardous
for collection by community healthcare workers.
At present, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Indian Council of Medical Research
(ICMR) recommend RT-PCR based tests for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis as this test produces results
within a few hours, is available in many countries on both manual and automated platforms, and
can identify infected individuals from early infectious stages to recovery. Tests using viral
antigens can detect COVID-19 three days after the onset of symptoms, however, in many
countries these are not available. Rapid diagnostic tests using antibodies are unable to identify
early cases as antibodies are only detectable 6-12 days after patients become symptomatic. In
addition, tests using antibodies are not able to distinguish recovered cases from those who are
currently infectious, however they may be useful in surveillance for individuals who have been
infected with COVID-19.

The first pooled RT-PCR method suggested here for classifying the infection rate in a population
using group testing is viable when population prevalence is low. When prevalence is high, then it
is likely that the optimal size of the pool will have to be very small and the method is unlikely to
present a dramatic reduction in resource use. On the other hand, we recommend using the second
RT-PCR pooling method proposed to identify individuals only on samples from individuals who
exhibit symptoms. The optimal pool size depends on the sensitivity of the test, and this is a
function of viral load. Salivary viral load has been found to be highest in the first week after the
onset of symptoms.23 While patients are asymptomatic, early in infection, the viral load is low
making this technique unlikely to be useful in these individuals.
One limitation of pooling multiple RT-PCR samples is that the sensitivity of testing is reduced.
To address this, it has been suggested that the number of samples being pooled be kept as low as
possible to reduce dilution24,25 and special kits for extracting DNA from larger volumes be used.8
However, in some settings, pursuing optimal pool size may still not be possible due to fixed
testing resources.
Herein we recommend the use of the pooled sample method with a binary hierarchical testing
strategy for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in community surveillance particularly in
resource limited settings where testing kits, facilities, and personnel are scarce. Our best
estimates are that for the currently estimated prevalence of COVID-19 in many low- and middleincome countries, a single cluster of 30 tests could be combined from patients exhibiting cough,
fever and other mild-flu like symptoms. Clustering should be undertaken at a geographic level to
prioritize neighborhoods or localities for additional containment efforts.
