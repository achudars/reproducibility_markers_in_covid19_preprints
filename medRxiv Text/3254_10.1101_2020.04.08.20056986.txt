Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a
rapidly spreading global pathogen stressing the need for development of rapid testing protocols
ever than before. The aim of present study was to develop a SARS-CoV-2 detection protocol
which can be performed within minimal resources and timeframe. For this purpose, we
implemented the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP)
methodology for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In order to improve the
detection capability, the RT-LAMP assay was developed to simultaneously amplify two viral
genes: ORF1a and N. A total of 45 SARS-CoV-2 associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) and 25 non-COVID-19 cases were enrolled. Viral RNA was extracted from the
nasopharyngeal swab samples and analyzed simultaneously using PCR and RT-LAMP protocols.
Overall, our SARS-CoV-2 dual gene RT-LAMP assay was found to be 95% accurate in
detecting positive cases and showed no cross-reactivity or false-positive results in non-COVID19 samples. Further evaluation on larger and multi-centric cohorts is currently underway to
establish the diagnostic accuracy and subsequent implementation into clinical practice and at
point-of-care settings.

INTRODUCTION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped, nonsegmented single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus comprising of 29,881 nucleotides in
length. At genomic level, SARS-CoV-2 shares ~88% nucleotide sequence homology with
previously reported SARS-like coronavirus strains from bats, indicating its potential origin and
transmission route [1].
SARS-CoV-2 associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a global
public health emergency since its outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [2]. The current
recommended testing method for patients exhibiting clinical features of COVID-19 is the
qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 via real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (rRT-PCR). The rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 can be performed on nasopharyngeal
and/or oropharyngeal swabs, sputum or alveolar lavage fluid depending upon the sample
processing local/international guidelines and available facilities [3, 4]. However, COVID-19
outbreak has highlighted several caveats of the PCR-based testing when it comes down to the
point of mass-testing coupled with urgent reporting. For instance, PCR testing requires wellequipped centralized laboratories capable of handling respiratory pathogens, dedicated
instruments such as PCR machines and skilled staff to ensure the smooth processing which isn’t
always possible particularly in less developed or resource limited communities. Unfortunately,
the COVID-19 has pushed even the developed nations to levels where they are struggling to
ensure rapid and effective testing for every suspected case, one can imagine how catastrophic the
situation can be in countries with limited healthcare facilities and resources. In addition, falsenegative PCR results from several COVID-19 patients is also becoming a matter of concern
raising questions about the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays [5-7]. Therefore, a great deal
of effort is shifting towards deployment of accurate yet rapid, cost-effective and point-of-care
testing methodologies.
As the basic principle of PCR-based methods is to amplify the genomic content to the level of
detection, alternative molecular amplification approaches can be of great value under crisis
situations. One such method is loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) which since its
development became one of the highly popular and implemented isothermal method for the rapid
detection of animal [8, 9], plant [10, 11] and human pathogens [12, 13]. Unlike PCR, LAMP
utilizes a combination of uniquely designed pair of four to six primers and a specialized version

of DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity to bypass the need of denaturation by heat.
In summary, it is well-established that LAMP is a stable and rapidly deployable approach with
sensitivity profile surpassing the PCR [10, 14, 15]. Recently, several LAMP assays for the
detection of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and showed promising data [16-23]. In the present
study, we report a novel SARS-CoV-2 dual gene RT-LAMP assay and its preliminary evaluation
on “real-world” cases.

MATERIAL & METHODS
Study design:
The present study aimed towards development and assessment of a rapid SARS-CoV-2 detection
protocol based upon the concept of LAMP. Informed consent from study participants and ethical
approval was obtained as per institutional guidelines.
Study cohort:
A total of 45 PCR-confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 and 25 non-COVID-19 cases were
selected for the present study. The steps of rRT-PCR-based detection of COVID-19 infection
were conducted as follows. All the procedures were performed in a biosafety level-3 facility as
per instructions set forth for the handling of COVID-19 samples.
Viral RNA isolation
Total Viral RNA was extracted from the deactivated NP swab samples by using viral RNA kit
following manufacturer’s recommendations. The eluted viral RNA was stored at -80°C until
further use.
cDNA synthesis
The eluted viral RNA was reverse transcribed by using Hifair II 1st stand cDNA Supermix
(Yeasen, China) as per manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly, 10ul of Supermix containing
optimized concentration of Hifair II reverse transcriptase, RNase inhibitor, dNTPs, random
hexamer/oligo dT primer mix in an optimized buffer system was mixed with 5ul of Viral RNA
followed by addition of 5ul DNase/RNase free water (Invitrogen, USA) for a final reaction
volume of 20ul. The procedure was performed on MiniAmp thermocycler (Applied biosystems,
USA) and the cycling conditions were 25°C for 5min followed by 42°C for 30min and final
elongation/termination at 85°C for 5min.
COVID-19 rRT-PCR assay
The COVID-19 rRT-PCR was performed using 2X EasyTaq PCR Supermix (TransGen, China)
and China CDC approved primer (Forward primer: CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA; Reverse
primer: ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA) and probe (5'-FAMCCGTCTGCGGTATGTGGAAAGGTTATGG-TRAMA-3') pair targeting ORF1ab gene
segment. Briefly, 1ul of cDNA was added to the mix comprising of 10X EasyTaq buffer (2ul),

2.5nM dNTPs (1.6ul), EasyTaq DNA polymerase (0.3ul), 10uM primer forward/reverse (0.4 ul)
10uM probe (0.2ul), and nuclease free water (14.5ul) to makeup a final reaction volume of 20ul.
The amplification was performed on QuantStudio qPCR system (Applied biosystems, USA) and
the cycling conditions were; 50°C for 2min followed by denaturation step at 95°C for 10min and
40 cycles of 95°C for 10s and 60°C for 1min.
LAMP assay development:
The full-length genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from GISAID [24]
(accessed on March 10, 2020). The multiple sequence alignment was performed using MAFFT
[25] with manual correction of alignment files in alignment editor wherever necessary. The
consensus SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence as representative of multiple sequence alignment was
generated for further analysis. The LAMP primers were designed using Primer Explorer v5
(http://primerexplorer.jp/lampv5e/index.html) software targeting the ORF1a and N gene
segments of consensus genome sequence. Multiple primer pairs were generated which were
further evaluated based upon principles of LAMP primer design. Each primer set comprised of
an outer forward primer, outer backward primer, forward inner primer, backward inner primer,
loop forward primer, and loop backward primer. The pair of primers (available upon request)
targeting ORF1a and N genes that were found to be non-homologous to non-COVID-19
coronavirus strains based upon BLAST analysis.
The RT-LAMP reaction was performed using WarmStart Colorimetric LAMP 2XMaster Mix
(New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, United States). Briefly, 10ul of WarmStart master mix was
mixed with 2ul of 10x primer mix, 3ul of template viral RNA and adjusted with 5ul of water for
a final volume of 20ul. The reaction tubes were incubated at 65°C for 5min in a pre-heated dry
bath. Blank and negative controls were included in each cycle. Results were interpreted based on
visualization of change in color once the amplification was terminated. Positive samples turned
yellow whereas negative samples remained pink.
Statistical analysis:
The Fisher’s exact test was used to computer the diagnostic accuracy of dual-gene RT-LAMP
assay in comparison to rRT-PCR.

RESULTS & DISCUSSION
In the present study, we report a novel dual-gene RT-LAMP assay for the qualitative detection of
SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 cases. As the aim is to mature this protocol as a point-of-care and
on-field testing approach, therefore, the protocol was kept simple, quick and easily deployable.
For this purpose, ready-to-use master mixes and primer mixes were prepared. Multi-gene
approach has previously shown to improve the performance of SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays. The
same approach was applied here, and RT-LAMP was designed to simultaneously detect ORF1a
and N genes. Recently, several studies have reported LAMP assays for COVID-19. Overall, all
these studies highlight the strength of LAMP especially in situations where a rapid and reliable
testing is required. Moreover, few commercially developed isothermal systems are already in
pipeline for the approval by the relevant authorities however, majority of the reported SARSCoV-2 LAMP assays were evaluated on synthetic constructs and lack validation on actual
samples. Theoretically, such assays shouldn’t suffer from any drastic differences, however, the
true sensitivity: specificity profile of an assay demands validation on clinical cohort. Therefore,
one strength of our assay is validation on COVID-19 positive patients’ samples. As given in
Table 1, dual-gene LAMP assay was able to detect 43 out of 45 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV2
positive samples based upon consensus findings of ORF1a and N genes whereas, none of the
non-COVID-19 samples were found to be positive indicating 95% sensitivity and 100%
specificity.

The two PCR-positive samples designated as sample A (ID#1112-4) and B (ID# 390-3) showed
ed
conflicting results. As shown in Figure 1, sample A showed positive amplification in N assay
ay
whereas no amplification was noted with ORF1a assay. On the other hand, sample B showed
ed
positive amplification with ORF1a whereas negative according to the N assay. As we considered
ed
same output from both assays to assign samples as positive or negative, we concluded these
se
samples as negative. The Cq value of sample B was 36.90 that is indicate of low viral load
ad
whereas, sample A had Cq value 31.30. As there was no additional viral RNA available for
testing of sample A and B, the negative result of sample A for ORF1a is currently unclear. On
n
the other hand, positive detection of low viral load sample B is indicative that LAMP ORF1a
1a
assay is more sensitive than N assay. Evaluation with additional samples is currently underway.
y.
Overall, the reported dual-gene LAMP assay is an effective and quick approach to handle mass-testing of COVID-19 without the need of expensive equipment, access to centralized laboratories
ies
and highly trained staff.
