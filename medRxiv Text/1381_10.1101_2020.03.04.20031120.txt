Summary
BACKGROUND The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously provisionally
named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) since December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has become
an emergency of major international concern. Apart from the respiratory system, it is unclear
whether SARS-CoV-2 can also directly infect other tissues such as the kidney or induce acute renal
failure.
METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
along with other clinical parameters from 85 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
admitted to a hospital in Wuhan from January 17, 2020 to March 3, 2020. Kidney tissues from six
patients with postmortem examinations were analyzed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and in situ
expression of viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) antigen, immune cell markers (CD8, CD68 and CD56)
and the complement C5b-9 was detected by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, the viral particles in
kidneys were also investigated by transmission electronic microscope (EM).
RESULTS 27.06% (23/85) patients exhibited acute renal failure (ARF). The eldery patients and
cases with comorbidities such as hypertension and heart failure more easily developed ARF (65.22%
vs 24.19%, p< 0.001; 69.57% vs 11.29%, p< 0.001, respectively). H&E staining demonstrated
kidney tissues from postmortems have severe acute tubular necrosis and lymphocyte infiltration.
Immunohistochemistry showed that SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen was accumulated in kidney tubules.
EM observation also demonstrated that viruses- like particles are visible in the kidneys. Viral
infection not only induces CD68+ macrophages infiltrated into tubulointerstitium, but also enhances
complement C5b-9 deposition on tubules.
CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 induces ARF in COVID-19 patients. Viruses directly infect human
kidney tubules to induce acute tubular damage. The viruses not only have direct cytotoxicity, but
also initiate CD68+ macrophage together with complement C5b-9 deposition to mediate tubular
pathogenesis.

Introduction
In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases caused by a novel severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.1-3 This
disease, now designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO, rapidly spread to
other cities of China and around the world.4-6 By March 3, 2020, 80270 cases were laboratory
confirmed with 2981 deaths in China based on CCDC (Chinese Center For Disease Control And
Prevention) reports.7
Some studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV (Severe acute respiratory
syndrome-Coronavirus) and MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus) share a
common ancestor resembling the bat coronavirus HKU9-1.8,9 Recently, Shi et al., reported that
SARS-CoV-2 interacts with human ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme-II) molecules via its
Spike protein.10 In addition to respiratory organs, the expression of ACE2 protein has also been
observed in human kidneys,11,12 and Cheng et al., reported that some COVID-19 patients had an
elevated level of proteinuria.13 However, no evidence directly demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 can
infect the kidney to cause acute renal failure.
We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data on kidney function from 85 cases of COVID-19
who were admitted into the General Hospital of Central Theatre Command in Wuhan, Hubei
Province, from January 17, 2020 to March 3, 2020. To elucidate the mechanism of renal injury, we
also used H&E staining and immunohistochemistry to visually assess tissue damage and viral
presence in kidney tissues from six biopsies.
Methods
Patients Medical records from 85 COVID-19 patients (aged from 21 years to 92 years) with
dynamic observation of renal function in General Hospital of Central Theatre Command in Wuhan
from January 17, 2020 to March 3, 2020 were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Postmortem
autopsies were conducted on six patients who had been admitted in Hospital. Diagnosis of
COVID-19 was based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (5th
edition) published by the National Health Commission of China. All the patients were
laboratory-confirmed positives for SARS-CoV-2 by use of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on
throat swab samples. This study was approved by the National Health Commission of China and

Ethics Commission of General Hospital of Central Theatre Command ([2020]017-1) and Jinyintan
Hospital (KY-2020-15.01). Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of the
designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases.
Data collection and definitions We reviewed clinical records and laboratory findings for all the
patients. All information was obtained and curated with a customized data collection form. eGFR
was calculated by the CKD-EPI equation based on serum creatinine level, sex, race and age. Acute
renal impairment was defined as a decline of eGFR by at least 30% of the baseline value on
admission or below 90mL/min on admission. Three investigators (C Wang, Z Fen and Y Chen)
independently reviewed the data collection forms to verify data accuracy.
Tissue morphology detection and immunohistochemistry Due to the special infection-control
precaution of handling deceased subjects with COVID-19, postmortem examination was performed
in a designated pathology laboratory. Kidney specimens from autopsy were retrieved for standard
examination via light microscopy. Briefly, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were cut into 3 μm
slices and mounted onto poly-lysine-coated glass slides, and tissue injury was stained for by H&E.
Sections were also used for immunohistochemistry as following: Antigen retrieval was performed
by microwaving these sections in citrate buffer (10 mM, pH6.0). The sections were then incubated
in 3% BSA plus 0.1% H2O2 for 1h at RT to block nonspecific binding. The sections were then
incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocaspid protein (NP) antibodies
(clone ID: 019, 1:100, rabbit IgG; Sino Biological, Beijing), anti-CD8 (Clone ID:4B11, 1:100,
mouse IgG2b; BIO-RAD), anti-CD68 (Clone ID:KP1, 1:100, mouse IgG1; BIO-RAD), anti-CD56
(Clone ID:123C3, 1:100, mouse IgG1; BIO-RAD), anti-C5b-9 (clone ID: aE11, 1:100, mouse IgG;
Dakocytomation) or rabbit-isotype antibody controls (1:100; Dako). Sections were further
incubated with the HRP-anti-Rabbit secondary antibodies for 1h at RT. Peroxidase activity was
visualized with the DAB Elite kit (K3465, DAKO), and the brown coloration of tissues represented
positive staining as viewed by a light microscope (Zeiss Axioplan 2, Germany).
Transmission electron microscopy Two kidneys from 2 cases of autopsy were collected and fixed
with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphoric buffer (pH 7.4), post-fixed with 1% osmate, dehydrated
with gradient alcohol, embedded in Epon 812, double-stained with uranium acetate and lead
citromalic acid. The virus- like particles were observed under a JEM1200 transmission electron
microscope (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan).

Results
1. SARS-CoV-2 induces ARF in COVID-19 patients
We retrospectively analyzed laboratory kidney functions from 85 cases of COVID-19 patients,
and focusing on eGFR. Results showed that 27.06% (23/85) COVID-19 patients exhibited acute
renal failure. Patients who are elderly (≥60 years) or carry comorbidities (65.22% vs 24.19%,
p<0.001, 69.57% vs 11.29%, p<0.001, respectively), such as hypertension (39.13% vs 12.90%,
p=0.0007) and coronary heart disease (21.74% vs 4.84%, p=0.018) more easily developed ARF
(Table1), suggesting renal function impairment is relatively common in COVID-19 patients.
2. SARS-CoV-2 induces human kidney tubular injury
Next, the histopathological examination was performed by H&E- staining in kidney specimens
from autopsy of six COVID-19 subjects with observed renal function impairment. Varying degrees
of acute tubular necrosis, luminal brush border sloughing and vacuole degeneration, were found in
different areas of all six renal specimens. Severe infiltration of lymphocytes in the
tubulointerstitium was observed in two patients, and moderate infiltration was seen in three cases,
and the remaining one case manifested absence of lymphocyte infiltration. Moreover, viral infection
associated-syncytia were also observed in three cases. At the same time, dilated capillary vessels
were observed in the glomeruli of these 6 cases. Nevertheless, severe glomerular injury was absent
in all of these six cases, although benign hypertensive glomerulosclerosis and autolysis were noted
in three hypertensive patients (Figure 1, Table 2). Collectively, these results demonstrated that
SARS-CoV-2 infection mainly induces severe acute tubular necrosis and lymphocyte infiltration.

To confirm that SARS-CoV-2 might directly infect kidney tubules thus lead to tubular damage, the
viral NP antigen was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results showed that SARS-CoV-2 NP
antigens could be seen in kidney tissues from all of these six samples, with NP expression restricted
to kidney tubules, and NP- positive inclusion body was also observed. The NP- positive expression
was observed in cytoplasm, but nuclear signals were not observed (Figure 2A). Some NP-positive
tubular epithelial cells were dropped from normal tubules (Figure 2B), while NP- antigen was also
absent in the glomerulus (Figure 2C). The expression of NP protein in lung tissues from COVID-19
patients was used as positive controls (Figure 2D), whereas normal kidney tissues (Figure 2E) or
renal sections from unrelated autopsies treated with rabbit isotype control antibodies (Figure 2F)
were used as negative controls. Collectively, these data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects
kidney tubules.
4. Direct observation of virus- like particles in kidneys by EM
Transmission electron microscopy (EM) was used to detect virions and virus- like particles in
two kidneys from two autopsies. The results showed that cells in infected renal tissues were
markedly swollen with expansion of mitochondria and lysosomes. The rough endoplasmic
reticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) are also dilated greatly. Interestingly,
viruses- like particles with 80 ～ 160 nm diameters are observed in the broken lysosomes in
cytoplasm, clearly identifiable due to high electron density and complete coating (Figure 3).
Moreover, virus- like particles are all seen in both cases, demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 directly
infects kidneys.
5. SARS-CoV-2 induces CD68+ macrophage infiltration and complement C5b-9 deposition
Since the infiltration of proinflammatory cells can significantly accelerate tubular damage, we next
examined the identity of these infiltrated cells. Immunohistochemistry showed strong presence of
CD68+ macrophages were in the tubulointerstitium of these six cases, while moderate numbers of
CD8+ T cells were also observed in two cases, whereas, CD4+ T cells and CD56+ natural killer (NK)
cells were seldom found in the examined tissues (Figure 4A, Table 2), suggesting that
SARS-CoV-2 might cause further tubular damage through recruiting macrophages to infiltrate into
the tubulointerstitium.

As the deposition of the complement membrane-attack complex (MAC, also named C5b-9) on
tubules or glomeruli may also cause renal damage,14 we further analyzed C5b-9 status in kidney
tissues from these postmortems. Interestingly, strong C5b-9 depositions on tubules were observed in
all of these six cases. Very low levels of C5b-9 deposition on glomeruli and capillaries were also
seen in two cases. However, C5b-9 expression is absent in normal kidney tissue (Figure 4B, Table
2), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces acute tubular necrosis and ARF through
triggering C5b-9 deposition.
Discussion
In this study, we found that 27.06% of patients with COVID-9 had abnormal eGFR, and patients
who are aged or have comorbidities more commonly developed ARF (Table 1), suggesting that
ARF is relatively common following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This phenomenon is different from
the 2003 outbreak of SARS, in which ARF was uncommon, despite being one of the top risk
factors for mortality. 15 Recently, Yan et al., reported that 63% (32/51) of COVID-19 patients
had an elevated level of proteinuria.13 Collectively, these results illustrate that SARS-CoV-2
mediated ARF may be one of the major causes of multiorgan failure and eventual death in
COVID-19 patients.
The extents of tubular atrophy and interstitial disease are the strongest histological parameters
which correlate with renal function and predict progression. To further analyze how SARS-CoV-2
affects renal function, we focused on analyzing renal tissue morphology from autopsies. H&E
staining showed that acute renal tubular damage and lymphocyte infiltration was observed in all six
cases during postmortem examinations, while the glomeruli were intact, except for some cases with
slight glomerulosclerosis, suggesting that other conditions such as hypertension and diabetic
nephropathy may have been involved in the pathogenesis（Figure 1). It has been shown that the
ACE-2 receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is highly expressed in renal tubules.12 ,16 We used
immunohistochemistry to analyze the expression of viral NP antigen in situ in kidney tissues, and
found that viral NP antigen was restricted to the renal tubular cells of the infected tissues (Figure 2).
Most important, EM observation demonstrated that viruses- like particles are also visible in the
infected kidneys (Figure 3). This phenomenon is consistent with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both
of which can also infect human kidneys. 1 7,1 8 Recently, some researchers have reported they have

successfully isolated SARS-CoV-2 virus particles from the urine of COVID-19 patients, suggesting
that kidney-originated viral particles may enter the urine through glomerular filtration. Taken
together with our study, these results demonstrate that the kidney is also a site of viral infection and
replication outside of the lungs.
While SARS-CoV-2 is a cytopathic virus which can also directly induce renal tubular injury
during infection and replication, the occurrence of such injury may also initiate complex immune
responses. After all, although host immune cells can infiltrate into infected tissue to counteract viral
replication, hyperactivation of immune cells may instead promote fibrosis, induce epithelial cell
apoptosis, and cause microvasculature changes.19-21 We report here that SARS-CoV-2 virus recruits
high levels of CD68+ macrophages to infiltrate into the tubulointerstitium (Figure 4A), suggesting
that proinflammatory cytokines derived from macrophages would induce tubular damage. Both
clinical and experimental models suggest that the abnormal presence of serum-derived complement
components in the tubular lumen leads to the assembly of the complement C5b-9 (via the
alternative pathway) on the apical brush border of tubular epithelial cells (TECs), and that this is an
important factor in the pathogenesis of tubulointerstitial damage.22-24 We here observed that
SARS-CoV-2 initiates complement C5b-9 assembly and deposition on tubules (Figure 4B). We
therefore demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 causes tubular damage through direct cytotoxicity, but also
initiates immune- mediates tubule pathogenesis.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can directly infect human renal
tubules and consequently lead to acute renal tubular injury. Moreover, improvement of eGFR would
increase the survival of COVID-19 patients who have ARF. We strongly suggest that applying
potential interventions including continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) for protecting
kidney function in COVID-19 patients, particularly for ARF cases, maybe a key method to
preventing fatality.

in two kidney tissues from two autopsies, and viruses- like particles with 80～160 nm diameters are
observed in the broken lysosomes in cytoplasm, clearly identifiable due to high electron density and
complete coating. Arrow indicated virus- like particles.
