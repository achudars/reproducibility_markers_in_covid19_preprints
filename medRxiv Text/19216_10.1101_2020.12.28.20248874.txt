Summary: Our results showed that, excluding environmental pollution after birth and vaginal infection
during childbirth, SARS-CoV-2 was less likely to be transmitted vertically in utero.

Abstract
Background

：Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), mainly transmitted by droplets

and close contact, has caused a pandemic worldwide as of November 2020. According to the current case
reports and cohort studies, the symptoms of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to normal
adults and may cause a series of adverse consequences of pregnancy (placental abruption, fetal distress, epilepsy
during pregnancy, etc.). However, whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to the fetus through the placental
barrier is still a focus of debate.

：

Methods In this study, in order to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 infect fetus through placental barrier, we
performed qualitative detection of virus structural protein (spike protein and nucleoprotein) and targeted
receptor protein (ACE2, CD147 and GRP78) expression on the placental tissue of seven pregnant women
diagnosed with COVID-19 through immunohistochemistry. Amniotic fluid, neonatal throat, anal swab and
breastmilk samples were collected immediately in the operating room for verification after delivery, which were
all tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Results: The result showed that CD147 was expressed on the basal side of the chorionic trophoblast cell
membrane and ACE2 was expressed on the maternal side, while GRP78 was strongly expressed in the cell
membrane and cytoplasm. The RT-PCR results of Amniotic fluid, neonatal throat, anal swab and breastmilk
samples were all negative.
Conclusions: We believed that despite the detection of viral structural proteins in the placenta, SARS-CoV-2
cannot be transmitted to infants due to the presence of the placental barrier.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped single positive stranded RNA virus, which has caused a worldwide pandemic for
its high infection rate. It has been proved that SARS-CoV-2 was mainly transmitted by droplets and close
contact. Clinically, mild patients have fever, dry cough, and fatigue as the main manifestations, while severe and
critically ill patients may have breathing difficulties, acute respiratory distress and other symptoms that are

life-threatening [1]. The infection of pregnant women with COVID-19 has been widely concerned since the
previous epidemics of emerging viral infections have caused many poor obstetric outcomes including
maternal-fetal transmission of the virus, perinatal infections and death, maternal morbidity and mortality.
According to the current case reports and cohort studies, the symptoms of pregnant women infected with
SARS-CoV-2 were similar to normal adults and may cause a series of adverse consequences of pregnancy
(placental abruption, fetal distress, epilepsy during pregnancy, etc.) [1, 2]. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 can
be transmitted to the fetus through the placental barrier is still a focus of debate.
Vertical transmission was defined as the transmission of the infectious pathogen from the mother to the
fetus during the antepartum and intrapartum periods, or to the neonate during the postpartum period via the
placenta in utero, body fluid contact during childbirth, or through direct contact owing to breastfeeding after
birth [3]. There were many reports about fetal infection with COVID-19 [1, 2, 4-6], but these experiments did
not clarify the relationship between the viral load of placental tissue, amniotic fluid, umbilical cord and neonatal.
In addition, there was no distinction between transplacental or transvaginal route and environmental exposure in
the experimental design. We retrieved only three case reports and one cohort study, which reported neonatal
infection with SARS-CoV-2, that the throat swabs of positive newborns and the placental tissue or amniotic
fluid of pregnant women were tested for the virus [7-10]. Two of the 22 newborns delivered by COVID-19
positive pregnant women tested positive for COVID-19 based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results of
an NP swab [8]. One case of placental tissue on the maternal and fetal side was positive (RT-PCR), but the fetus
had only intrauterine distress and negative for SARS-CoV-2 [9]. Vivanti and his colleagues reported a case of
SARS-CoV-2 infection in a pregnant woman who gave birth to a newborn. Amniotic fluid, placenta, neonatal
blood and non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were positive for E and S genes of SARS-CoV-2.
The neonatal NP and rectal swabs were positive at 1h, 3d and 18d after delivery [7]. According to the published
classification for the case definition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women, fetuses and neonates,
detection of the virus by PCR in umbilical cord blood or neonatal blood collected within first 12 hours of birth
or amniotic fluid collected prior to rupture of membrane is considered to be a congenital infection of newborns
[11].
The presence of targeted receptors on cell membrane is a prerequisite for virus entry into host cells. Similar
to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 mainly utilizes spike (S) protein to target angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
on the cell membrane, and then entry into the host cell [12, 13]. CD147, also known as Basigin or EMMPRIN,
is a transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily [14]. It is an important marker

in tumorigenesis and development, and also plays a role in the infection process of HIV, measles, SARS-CoV
and other viruses [15-17]. Recently, studies have shown that CD147 mediates virus entry into cells by
interacting with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 [18, 19]. The Glucose Regulating Protein 78 (GRP78) or
Binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) is the master chaperone protein of the unfolded protein response (when
unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate) [20-22]. Under normal circumstances, GRP78 is located in the
lumen of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). When the cell is stressed, the over-expressed GRP78 escapes the
retention of the endoplasmic reticulum and transfers to the cell membrane, which makes it a target for many
viruses to enter the cell [23]. Previous studies have shown that GRP78 acts as a coordinating factor to promote
the virus's entry into host cells by increasing the adhesion of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(MERS-CoV) to target cells [24]. Ibrahim M. Ibrahim and his colleagues used bioinformatics methods to predict
the binding ability of GRP78 to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [22].
In this study, we discussed the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 crossing the placental barrier and the role of
placental barrier in virus transmission. To this end, we collected the placental tissues of 7 pregnant women
diagnosed by nucleic acid testing and 2 negative pregnant women. Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase
Chain Reaction Assay (RT-PCR) for amniotic fluid, breast milk, neonatal throat and anal swab was examined,
and the protein expression of targeted receptors (ACE2, CD147 and GRP78) and viral structural protein (S
protein and N protein) in placental tissues were estimated through immunohistochemical experiment to evaluate
the possibility of vertical transmission. We hope that these results will provide valuable clinical data for
managing pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2.

Methods
Case acquisition
The positive placenta tissue came from the pregnant women who were diagnosed with COVID-19 from Tongji
and Union Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan. Two cases of negative placental
tissues were obtained as negative controls, tested negative by viral nucleic acid at the same time period. Seven
female patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and
Control Program (6th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China [46]. Treatments were
informed to the patient and consent was obtained. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Ethics
Committee of Wuhan Union and Tongji hospitals of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Written
informed consent was obtained from each enrolled patient.

Sample collection and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR nucleic acid detection
Maternal throat swab samples from the upper respiratory tract were collected at admission in viral-transport
medium. Amniotic fluid, placenta, neonatal throat and anal swab samples were collected immediately after
delivery in the operating room. The operation was performed in a negative pressure operating room, and doctors
and nurses were well protected. All babies were separated from their mothers immediately after delivery and
admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Nucleic acid RT-PCR detection of newborn swabs was performed at
0h, 24h, and 48h after birth. Breastmilk samples were also collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing to evaluate the
evidence of vertical transmission. We believed that the infection came from the contact with mother's body
fluids or the external environment if the newborn's nucleic acid test was negative at 0h and became positive after
24h and 48h. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was detected with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) recommended kit (BioGerm, Shanghai, China), following WHO guidelines for RT-PCR [47].
The primers used have been described previously [40].
Construction and Synthesis of Viral Monoclonal Protein
Antigen preparation: Recombinant protein expression plasmids with P-peptide, 6×His or other labeling were
constructed using recombinant DNA technology to purify target proteins by affinity chromatography. (For
protein information, see Supplementary Table S1 and Figure S1)
Immunized animals: Each tumor-associated marker antigen immunized 5 BALB/C mice (male and female) aged
8 ~ 12 weeks. The dosage of recombinant protein antigen for the first immunization was 50ug for each mouse,
followed by the addition of Forster's complete adjuvant, and then the immunization was enhanced for 2-4 times
according to the serum antibody titer (the interval was generally 2 weeks). The dosage of recombinant protein
antigen for each immunization was 25ug for each mouse, with the addition of Forster's incomplete adjuvant.
Cell fusion was performed 3 ~ 4 days after the last immunization, when the serum antibody titer of mice reached
its peak value.
Cell fusion: In the preparation of mouse B-cell hybridomas using polyethylene glycol (PEG) fusion cells, the B
cells from the spleen cells of immunized mice were mixed with mouse myeloma cells, and only the fusion cells
formed by B cells and myeloma cells could form hybridoma cells secreting specific antibodies. The hybrid cells
of B cells and myeloma cells could be screened by HAT culture.
Cloning and culture of hybridoma cells. Monoclonal hybridoma cell lines were obtained by several rounds of
limited dilution. In the 96-well culture plate, the dilution was generally 0.8 cells/well. According to Poisson
method, there should be 36% of the Wells as 1 cell/well. The supernatant was detected by enzyme-linked

immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the positive clones were screened.
Antibody identification and Mass production of antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies were identified by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and SDS-PAGE (see Supplementary Figure S2). Mice were
inoculated intraperitoneally (BALB/C).
Immunohistochemistry
Formalin fixed and paraffin embedded the placental tissues of seven positive and two negative pregnant women.
Five-micron serial sections were taken for immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed using
an automated stainer (Bond-III; Leica Microsystems Bannockburn, IL) with ACE2 Monoclonal Antibody
(ab15348 [2ug/mL], abcam), CD147 Monoclonal Antibody (ab15348 [2ug/mL], abcam) and GRP78
Monoclonal Antibody (promab). SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and spike protein monoclonal antibodies
were produced by our cooperation with ProMab Biotechnologies, the antibody specificity has been verified by
SDS-PAGE and elisa.

Result
Clinical findings
The clinical information of the nine cases was introduced in Table 1. The gestational age at delivery averaged 39
6/7 weeks (range 38–42 weeks, median 40 weeks). XGp1 to XGp7 were positive pregnant women diagnosed by
throat swab virus nucleic acid test, No-1 and No-2 were negative pregnant women as controls. Maternal
COVID-19 test was performed peripartum on all cases within an average of 9 days before delivery (range from
4 days to 17 days ante partum). XGp3, XGp7 and No-1 were for cesarean section, and the other cases were for
vaginal delivery. XGp1, XGp3 and XGp7 had fever during the perinatal period, and XGp7 also had diarrhea. All
newborns were singletons and did well in the early perinatal period. Nine newborns had a 1-minute apgar score
of 8, and a 5-minute score of 9. The average fetal heart rate before delivery was 136/min (range from 125/min to
154/min). In Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay for SARS-CoV-2, all pregnant
women's colostrum, amniotic fluid, and neonatal throat swab specimens (0h, 24h and 48h after birth) were
negative.
Expression of ACE2, CD147 and GRP78 in placental tissue
It could be clearly seen from Fig. 1A that GRP78 has strong membrane and cytoplasmic expression in chorionic
syncytiotrophoblast (ST). There was also scattered GRP78 expression in the cell membrane of chorionic
cytotrophoblast (CT) (Fig. 1 A). CD147 was expressed in ST cell membrane with polarity, such that expression

was strongest at the membrane adjacent to the CT and villous stroma. In most cases, the expression of CD147
was restricted to the basement membrane side, weaker expression in the maternal side and usually showed a
circumferential membranous pattern. No CD147 staining was present in villous stroma (Fig. 1 B). ACE2 is
highly expressed in ST membrane and also expressed in the extravillous trophoblast (EVT) in the decidua
basalis (Fig. 1 C). It was worth noting that the expression of GRP78, CD147 and ACE2 on the ST cell
membrane of placental villi of negative pregnant women were relatively weaker than that of positive pregnant
women (Fig. 1D-F).
Viral expression via IHC and Histopathology
Immunohistochemistry of the structural protein of SARS-CoV-2 showed that S protein and nucleoprotein were
positive in the cytoplasm of syncytial trophoblasts (Fig. 2). In our research, nucleoprotein was also expressed by
rare intervillous macrophages and Hofbauer cells (not shown in the picture). SARS-CoV-2 proteins were not
detected in fetal stromal tissue, including villous blood vessels. Pathologic diagnoses were made and lesions
graded as per the Amsterdam criteria [25]. Our histopathology result showed that six of the seven positive
pregnant women had fibrin deposition between the local villi in the placenta tissue (Fig. 2F). No-1 and No-2

were used as negative controls to verify the specificity of the antibody. The results of two negative controls
immunohistochemistry were showed in the supplementary materials.

Discussion
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 infection has resulted in an epidemic that has rapidly expanded to become one
of the most significant public health threats in recent times. Pregnant women and their fetuses represent a
potential high-risk population during the COVID-19 outbreak. Given that multiple viruses, such as
Varicella-zoster virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola virus and Zika virus, have been confirmed
to be transmitted to the fetus through the placenta and cause a series of adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g.
miscarriage, growth restriction, fetal distress, microcephaly etc.) [26-30] . It is urgently needed to find out
whether SARS-CoV-2 infects the fetus through the placenta.
In the study herein, the specimens of the nine pregnant women were collected in the negative pressure
operating room immediately after giving birth, and the doctors and pregnant women were well protected. We
believed that the specimens collected in this way would minimize the possibility of sample contamination. In
addition, throat swabs were collected at 0h, 12h and 48h after delivery. Recently, the SARS-CoV-2 clinical
classification of congenital infections in newborns has been published. The possible congenital infections of live

births were defined as "detection of the virus by PCR in nasopharyngeal swab at birth (collected after cleaning
baby) and placental swab from fetal side of placenta in a neonate born via cesarean section before rupture of
membrane or placental tissue" [11]. According to clinical classification, if the fetus has a positive result at 0h
and 12h after birth, it can be considered that the infection comes from an intrauterine infection of a
COVID-19-positive mother. If it is negative at birth and becomes positive after 48h, it is more likely to be
contaminated by the environment. [31]
Currently, the analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs by RT-PCR is the "gold standard" for diagnosing
COVID-19 in children and adults, but its efficacy for neonatal diagnosis has not been established. However,
many factors affect the sensitivity and specificity of the test and produce laboratory test errors, such as sampling
time, sampling method, sample source, storage and transportation, etc. [32]. Studies have shown that the false
negative rate of SARS-CoV-2 detected by RT-PCR is related to the exposure time, and RT-PCR analysis may
have a higher false negative rate in the early stages of exposure [33]. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of throat swabs as a molecular test because SARS-CoV-2 is mainly
transmitted through the respiratory tract and has a high viral load in the nasopharynx [34]. Unlike adults, it is
impossible to determine the mechanism of nasopharyngeal virus colonization in infants infected by intrauterine
infection. In some cases, specimens collected shortly after birth were negative, and then became positive a few
days or even weeks later [8, 35, 36]. On the contrary, there were reports showed that newborns were positive in
the early stages [2]. Among our seven newborns with positive mothers, the possibility of false negatives cannot
be ruled out, although throat swabs were negative at 0h, 12h, and 48h after birth and the newborns need to be
tested and tracked for longer.
Immunohistochemistry technology can locate antigens in placental tissues without destroying the tissue
structure and has the advantage of identifying SARS-CoV-2 receptors and nucleic acid expression on specific
cell types. The presence of the GRP78, CD147 and ACE2 receptors on the cell membrane is a prerequisite for
the placenta to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In our results, ACE2, CD147 and GRP78 were all expressed in
syncytiotrophoblasts. Meanwhile, the immunohistochemical results of the nucleoprotein and S proteins of the
syncytial trophoblast virus were positive in the placenta, suggesting that these viruses could infect the placenta
and possessed the possibility of crossing the placental epithelial barrier. However, the expression of viral
antigens in the villous matrix and interstitial blood vessels, which directly contact with the fetus, was negative.
This was consistent with the negative result of our newborn throat swab nucleic acid test. The possible
explanation for this result was that the expression of target receptors in the villous matrix was weak, so that the

virus could only stayed in the villous syncytiotrophoblast cell layer and cannot enter the villous matrix and
interstitial blood vessels to infect the fetus. Roger Pique-Regi and his colleagues performed scRNA-seq studies
on placental tissues and found that ACE2 transcription levels were low in placental tissues, which provided a
basis for our speculation [37]. Although the immunohistochemical results showed the presence of viral structural
proteins in the placental villus syncytiotrophoblasts, the PCR results of neonatal throat and anal swab at 0h, 12h
and 48h after birth were all negative, which was indicated that this novel coronavirus was less likely cross the
placental barrier to infect the fetus despite it could infect placenta tissues. In addition, the incidence of vertical
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been considered rare from the limited information. In a meta-analysis, 27 of
936 newborns delivered by COVID-19-positive pregnant women were positive for viral nucleic acid throat
swabs, indicating a pooled proportion of 3.2% (95% confidence interval, 2.2-4.3) for vertical transmission [3]. It
was noted that the ST membrane of placental tissue of positive pregnant women expressed relatively more
receptor proteins than that of negative pregnant women in our study. We speculate that infection with
SARS-CoV-2 increases the expression of GRP78, ACE2 and CD147 in ST cell membranes, which makes it
easier for the virus to enter syncytiotrophoblasts. However, the underlying mechanism that prevents the virus
from crossing the placental barrier needs further studied.
Another possible way for SARS-CoV-2 to be transmitted to infants may be through breast milk. Comparing
scRNA-seq datasets extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas and FANTOM5, it was observed that ACE-2
translation in breast tissue was similar to that of the lung tissue [38]. Despite the presence of ACE2 expression
in breast tissue, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in breast milk in most studies [39-41]. Most guidelines recognize
the relative safety of breastfeeding during the COVID-19 period, but more data about breastfeeding safety is still
needed [42, 43].
There were many studies reported the abnormal findings in placental pathology among COVID-19-positive
mothers. In some cases, HE sections of placental tissue showed low-grade fetal vascular perfusion (FVM). The
specific manifestations were vascular occlusion and contiguous, uniformly hyalinized, avascular villi.
COVID-19 was often accompanied by a hypercoagulable state of the circulatory system [44], with development
of ischemic changes including gangrene of fingers and toes, with evidence of d-dimer elevation, and, in some
patients, with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in one series [45]. However, whether the emergence of
FVM is related to the hypercoagulable state associated with COVID-19 needs further research. In our study, we
found no specific pathological changes related to COVID-19.
Our advantage lies in performing a comprehensive PCR test and immunohistochemical analysis on the

collected specimens. Neonatal swabs have been analysed with paired maternal throat swab, breast milk and
amniotic fluid to exclude possible environmental contamination after delivery. However, there were still some
limitations in our study, on the one hand, there were only seven cases of positive pregnant women, which might
be biased when analyzing the results, on the other hand, we lack cord blood and newborn blood samples.
According to the classification of clinical cases, if RT-PCR results are positive in umbilical cord and newborn
blood samples, it is even more reasonable to believe that the infection originates from the transmission of the
positive pregnant woman to the fetus through the placenta [11].

Fig.1 Expression of three host cell receptor proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in placental tissues by
Immunohistochemical staining (200×).
GRP78 (A and D), CD147 (B and E) and ACE2 (C and F) were all expressed on placental syncytial trophoblasts. A, B and C came from the
placenta tissue of positive pregnant women. D, E and F were from negative pregnant women. The intense brown cytoplasmic and
membranous positivity of syncytiotrophoblast (arrows) (A). In our case, ACE2 was expressed on the maternal side membrane of syncytial
trophoblasts, while CD147 was expressed on the stromal side (B,C). The expression of GRP78, CD147 and ACE2 in the placenta tissue of
negative pregnant women was relatively weaker than that of positive pregnant women . Bar corresponds to 500um for figs. A-F, 250um for
fig. A inset and 200um for figs. B-F inset.
