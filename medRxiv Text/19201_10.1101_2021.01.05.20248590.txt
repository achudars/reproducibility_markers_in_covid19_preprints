Abstract:
Shortages in N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are significant as FFRs are essential for the
protection of healthcare professionals and other high-risk groups against Coronavirus Disease of 2019
(COVID-19), a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In response to these
shortages during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration issued an
Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) permitting FFR decontamination and reuse. However, although
industrial decontamination services are available at some large institutions, FFR decontamination is not
widely available.

Effective FFR decontamination must 1) deactivate the virus; 2) preserve FFR integrity, specifically fit
and filtering capability; and 3) be non-toxic and safe. Here we identify and compare at-home methods
for heat-based FFR decontamination that meet these requirements, but utilize common household
appliances. Our results identify viable protocols for simple and accessible FFR decontamination, while
also highlighting methods that may jeopardize FFR integrity and should be avoided.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), is thought to be transmitted predominantly through exposure to short-range droplets
and aerosols 1. To protect against infectious airborne particles, possibly including sub-micrometer
aerosols carrying SARS-CoV-2 2, filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) such as the N95

standard for healthcare professionals 4. With appropriate donning and doffing procedures, combined
with proper fit, N95 FFRs can effectively limit cross-contamination and the transmission of COVID19 5.

Limiting disease transmission is one of the primary means of controlling the COVID-19 outbreak 6.
However, the global increase in demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) during the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic has led to an international shortage of high-performance FFRs 3. Under
conventional standards, N95 FFRs are intended to be disposable and are not approved for reuse.
However, the rapid increase in hospitalizations, combined with large public demand for PPE, resulted
in severe shortages and significant price inflation of N95 FFRs. This led the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to issue an emergency use authorization for N95 FFR reuse and decontamination
during the COVID-19 pandemic 7. Several different approaches can be used to decontaminate FFRs, as
defined by the FDA to be a minimum of a 3-log (i.e., 99.9%) reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral activity 8.
In addition to inactivating the virus, decontamination strategies for N95 FFR reuse must maintain
overall mask integrity, as measured by fit (ability to form a tight seal) and filtration (ability to limit
penetration of particulates) 9.

Some methods of decontamination have been shown to satisfy these criteria. For example, ultraviolet
(UV) germicidal irradiation (radiation-based); hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) (chemical-based); and
heat-humidity treatments 10, have all been used successfully. Unfortunately, these procedures can be
difficult to implement reliably at a large scale, and/or present safety risks at a small scale, especially in
resource-limited environments, outside large hospitals or research settings. HPV, for example, is a

severe irritant that can be hazardous to the lungs and eyes. Most UV-C light sources have spectral
variation, including wavelengths that can damage the skin or eyes, and proper decontamination by
UV-C light requires every surface to receive a sufficient dose of radiant energy, which is hard to ensure
for masks due to their three-dimensional shape and metal inserts 11.

Another significant obstacle is that methods that provide sterilization, the complete elimination of all
forms of microbial life, using heat (e.g., autoclaving) are highly likely to damage mask integrity. As a
result, existing FFR decontamination methods, even though effective against SARS-CoV-2, do not
typically remove all other forms of pathogens and contaminants. This constraint necessitates returning
decontaminated masks to the original user, a major logistical challenge on an institutional scale,
particularly during a healthcare crisis. Therefore, establishing safe and economical decontamination
methods for FFR reuse, that could be implemented in a personal, household or resource-limited setting,
is both necessary and urgent, considering the current global strain on the supply of N95 FFRs and the
vast number of individuals vulnerable to COVID-19 and other respirable infectious agents worldwide.

In this study, we recognized the potential of widely available, commercial household heat-generating
appliances to be used for FFR decontamination. We performed quantitative testing of a series of
appliances and decontamination methods, evaluating both their ability to reliably establish and
maintain decontamination conditions, and the effects of repeated treatments on mask fit and material
filtration performance. We identify rice cookers with thermostatically-controlled warming functions
as being the best of our tested heat-treatment methods at achieving decontamination conditions for

N95 FFRs reuse by retaining FFR fit and filtration integrity for up to five repeated treatments. We also
confirm that boiling FFRs is damaging to FFR fit.

RESULTS
Establishing decontamination parameters through literature review
Based on a review of previous studies that successfully used heat to deactivate enveloped viruses, we
identified parameters that were likely to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 within FFR fabric using heat, while
also preserving the fit and filtering properties of the mask. As a result of the COVID-19 response,
extensive non-regulatory agency (e.g., National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH),
CDC) testing and review of N95 decontamination strategies have been done 12. Table 1 summarizes 1)
temperature, humidity, exposure times and substrates that achieve viral inactivation; and 2) how these
different conditions were found to affect FFR fit and filtration.

In conjunction, these studies indicate that sustaining a temperature of 70-85°C for 30 minutes at 50%
humidity 17,19 or 60 minutes (with dry heat 15) should be sufficient to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Based on
prior studies

, we hypothesized that both of these conditions should preserve fit and filtration

efficiency of FFRs for up to five rounds of treatment, in line with the CDC’s recommendation of a
maximum of five donning and doffing cycles for FFRs 10. Additionally, treatment with steam autoclaves
or immersion boiling should inactivate SARS-CoV-2 from FFRs, but previous studies indicated that
these types of treatments may reduce FFR filtration efficiency and impact fit after as few as one round
of treatment 14,20.

Identifying home appliances capable of accurately attaining decontamination conditions

A wide range of commercial heat-generating appliances, including microwaves, rice cookers, sous vide
machines, tumble driers, hair dryers, and ovens, were considered for achieving FFR-compatible heat
conditions of 70°C for one hour. Appliances with minimum temperatures nominally above 70ºC or
maximum temperatures nominally below 70ºC were first excluded. For example, standard gas ovens
cannot be programmed to maintain temperatures lower than 76.7°C 21 and commercial tumble dryers
and hair dryers do not exceed 60ºC during operation at the hottest setting 22. Appliances that posed a

potential safety risk to the user were also deemed unsuitable. Microwave-generated heat may cause
FFRs with metallic components, such as the nosepiece, to spark or the plastic from the straps to melt
23,24

.

Based on these temperature and safety criteria, we selected rice cookers and sous vide machines for
further evaluation

25,26

. Although many types of rice cookers with varying quality and accuracy exist,

only a subset can maintain relatively precise temperatures around our target temperature of 70-85oC
through a Keep Warm setting. Sous vide machines, with basic components that include a heating
element, temperature feedback circuit, and water circulator, are the basis for a popular method of
cooking which involves encasing food inside water-tight plastic bags and heating it in temperaturecontrolled water. The sous-vide machine is dipped into the water, circulating it and establishing and
precisely maintaining the desired cooking temperature (over a range including our desired 70-85oC
condition).
Two types of rice cookers with Keep Warm settings were selected for testing: 1) the Cuckoo (CR-0655F,
retail ~$110), and 2) the Aroma (ARC-743-1NGB, retail ~$20). We also tested an AuAg Immersion
Circulator sous vide machine (A808, 950 W, retail ~$50).

Basic device performance assessment
Initial testing was performed to confirm whether each device could reach and maintain a target
temperature of 70ºC for one hour. A one hour treatment time was chosen since none of the selected
devices were expected to reliably provide and maintain the 50% humidity level required for a 30minute treatment. For both rice cookers, a temperature sensor (Inkbird Thermometer IBS-TH1) was

placed in an elevated plastic tub containing 120 ml of water within the inner pot and heated using the

Keep Warm setting. For the sous vide machine, a temperature sensor (MeatStick Wireless
Thermometer 4335995327) was immersed in a 20.5 x 15.5 x 12 cm3 polystyrene box with 3.2 L of water
and warmed using a sous-vide temperature setting of 70ºC. Temperature was recorded during initial
heating and then for one hour after each appliance’s temperature had stabilized. The total process time,
including time to reach the target temperature, were also recorded (Table 2, Fig S1).

The Keep Warm setting of the Cuckoo rice cooker and the AuAg Immersion Circulator sous vide

the Keep Warm setting of the Aroma rice cooker did not allow for precise temperature control. As it
was impossible to maintain a stable temperature within the required range, the Aroma rice cooker was
excluded from all subsequent tests. This result suggests that, even among rice cookers with Keep Warm

functions, not all may be suitable for FFR decontamination, and users should consult appliance manuals
and specifications to confirm the device’s ability to maintain the specified temperature range.

Evaluating the effects of appliance-based heat treatment on quantitative FFR fit
Based on the temperature measurements, we decided to test and compare the effects of three different
decontamination protocols on mask fit and function: 1) boiling at 100ºC for 10 minutes, 2) maintaining
70ºC for 60 minutes using the Cuckoo rice cooker and 3) maintaining 70ºC for 60 minutes using the
sous vide machine. Boiling was included as it is simple to perform at home, but was expected to impair
FFR function 9,14 (Fig 1).

control FFRs using a modified version of the standard NIOSH test (Fig 4). Filtration efficiency was
tested on two different FFR areas. For the Uniair San Huei SH3500 (TC-84A-4313) model, FFRs were
only exposed to heat using the Cuckoo rice cooker and the sous vide machine. They were treated up to
three times. Fit was estimated for both treatment and control FFRs as it is described in (C), the masks
were not tested for filtration performance.

FFRs assigned to be heated by the rice cooker were placed in breathable paper bags during the
treatment in order to reproduce how a home user would be advised to handle contaminated FFRs (Fig
2, bottom center picture) 10. For heat treatment with the sous vide machine, FFRs were sealed securely
in a polypropylene plastic bag (double protection Ziploc© Freezer Bags) before being placed in water.
In order to completely submerge the FFR within water, two 140 g weights were placed on top of the
plastic bag (Fig 2, bottom right picture). For boiled FFRs, as described in a previous study 9, the N95
mask material was directly immersed in the water while most of the elastic components were kept out
of the water to prevent altering the elasticity (Fig 2, bottom left picture). For all three conditions, extra
care was taken to ensure that the masks were positioned flat for the duration of the treatment in order
to avoid deforming the mask.

Experiments were performed using two models of donated FFRs: the Halyard Fluidshield 3 (TC-84A7521) (Fig 2, top) and the Uniair San Huei SH3500 (TC-84A-4313) (Fig S2). Care was taken to minimize
the total number of masks used in these experiments considering that this research was conducted
during the pandemic when PPE supplies were limited. Individual FFRs underwent one to five rounds
of heat treatment followed by quantitative fit testing, and material filtration assessment in comparison
to an untreated control (IRB reference AAAT5503) (Fig 1, Fig S2 and Supplemental Methods for full
details of treatments and fit testing protocols).

As shown in Fig 2 (top), exposing Halyard Fluidshield 3 FFRs to 70°C of dry heat for 60 minutes in the
Cuckoo rice cooker up to five times did not decrease their fit quality (no significant difference among
test group and the control FFR; p > 0.05). Halyard Fluidshield 3 FFRs that were treated with the sous
vide machine showed a significant decrease in fit quality, and failed fit testing after four rounds of
treatment (p < 0.01). Halyard Fluidshield 3 FFRs boiled for ten minutes failed fit testing after the second
round (p < 0.01) (Fig 2 and Table S1). We conclude from these results that, out of the three tested
methods, the Cuckoo rice cooker, and by extension, dry heat, is best at preserving Halyard Fluidshield
3 FFR fit.

Fig S3 shows equivalent analyses for the Uniair FFR model. However, overall fit quality of this FFR on
our testers was found to be poor, and even the control FFR failed two out of three technical replicate
fit test measurements (Fig S3, Fig S4, Table S2 and Table S3). Based on our recorded poor fit
performance and the lack of trends in fit quality with treatment conditions (Fig S4), we cannot
meaningfully draw conclusions on how the number of treatment repetitions affect the Uniair FFR fit.
These results underscore the importance of performing regular quantitative fit testing of specific PPE
to specific subjects to ensure proper FFR fit under a respiratory protection plan 27. The conclusions of
this paper regarding FFR fit and filtration efficacy after treatment thus pertain primarily to the Halyard
Fluidshield 3 (TC-84A-7521). It is, however, possible that trends in fit following heat-treatment holds
for similarly manufactured FFRs.

Comparison of individual fit test categories gives insights into how to improve fit

Quantitative fit testing of FFRs involves a series of different test conditions for a specific wearer (normal

breathing, deep breathing, head side to side, head up and down, talking, bending over, and normal
breathing). These results are often only examined using the overall fit factor, a geometric mean of the
individual categories. However, more detailed analysis (Fig 3) of results for each part of the test can
provide valuable insights. For example, while FFRs exposed to 70°C in the Cuckoo rice cooker passed

fit testing after five rounds of treatment, and sous vide machine FFRs passed after four rounds of
treatment, they did not score equally in all the test’s categories.

methods and repetitions of heat-treatment, the fit for different testing categories was estimated with

when there is significant variation in means among treatment category groups and control. Significance
(*) p < 0.05.

For FFRs decontaminated in the Cuckoo rice cooker, there was a progressive decrease of the fit score
(y = 212−16.8x, r2 = 0.24) when the subject was bending over (Fig 3). For FFRs that were boiled (y =
131−31x, r2 = 0.99) or heated using a sous vide machine (y = 206−22.8x, r2 = 0.66) there was a
progressive decrease in fit score for all categories. For sous vide machine treatment, this trend was
strongest when the subject was bending over (y = 212−27.9x, r2 =0.34) or turning their head side to

side (y = 224 −28.3x, r2 = 0.38). After three rounds of sous vide machine treatment bending over factors
were significantly lower than control (p < 0.05) but the FFR still passed (i.e., overall fit factor of 100 or
greater) the fit test with an overall fit factor of 123. After four rounds of sous vide machine treatment,
the FFR failed the fit test with an overall fit factor of 69. The FFR performed significantly worse than
the control (p < 0.05) in all fit categories but one (normal breathing) (Fig 3, Table S4, Table S5, Table
S6).

Evaluating the effects of appliance-based heat treatment on FFR filtration performance
To determine whether each of our three heat treatment methods affected the filtration performance of
Halyard Fluidshield 3 FFRs, we performed filtration efficiency (FE) analyses on samples of material
from each mask that underwent quantitative fit testing. For this analysis, we developed a modified
version of the standard NIOSH test (TEB-APR-STP-0059) assessing the penetration of non-neutralized
saline aerosols. Particle counts were measured in six different size bins, by a calibrated particle counter
(bins of 0.3 μm, 0.5 μm, 1 μm, 2.5 μm, 5 μm, and 10 μm size classes). While this is not the first of such

pipelines 26, our apparatus has all the major design elements needed to normalize for constant flow rates
regardless of filter impedance (Fig 4A, Table S7). Furthermore, our experiments were conducted with
a steady flow rate per unit area of the filter that exceeds the rates expected under standard NIOSH
testing, which generally decreases filtering efficiency compared to lower flow rates

. Testing was

through the fabric to mimic inhalation, and the other site testing flow in the exhalation direction.

as an aerosol generator. FFRs were attached to a sample holder and air and any suspended particles
were drawn through the FFR by an evacuator suction pump and diverted to a particle counter. FFR
impedance was measured through a pressure sensor attached to the sample holder. (B) The filtration
efficiency for different particle sizes (bins of 0.3 µm, 0.5 µm, 1 µm, 2.5 µm, 5 µm, and 10 µm size classes)
were determined for two mask regions of FFRs that were exposed to different methods and repetitions
of heat-treatment. None of the treatment methods tested reduces Halyard Fluidshield 3 FFR filtration
performance below 95%.
Comparisons between filtration efficiencies in the control and heat-treated FFRs indicate that none of
our possible decontamination strategies reduced FFR FE below 95%, meaning that the required
performance of ‘N-95’ FFRs was met by all of our treated masks under our test conditions (Fig 4B, Table
S7). We note further that a passing score during any of the quantitative fit testing procedures supports
these results, as any damage to the N95 mask material would compromise the overall filterability of the
mask and result in the FFR failing the fit test. On the other hand, FE testing also demonstrates that
flow and filtration properties of the mask material are not the only important consideration, as proper
mask fit is critical to maintain a high level of protection. As both a check of our novel filter test rig and
a demonstration of very small leaks significantly affecting effective filter performance, we used an 18gauge needle to introduce small holes in the filter after normal testing. FE decreased as a function of
the number of pinholes introduced into the mask material (Fig S5) and pressure across the N95 FFR
material decreased at a flow rate of 10 lpm (Table S8).

DISCUSSION
Pasteurization of pathogens in food and vaccines occurs between 60°C and 70°C for 30 minutes 25 and
SARS-CoV-2 has been experimentally inactivated in FFRs after one hour at 70°C

. Under these

15

temperature conditions, some FFRs have been shown to preserve fit and filtration efficiency from three
to over ten rounds of decontamination using dry heat

. Here we assessed different heat-based

methods that are likely to deactivate SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1) using common household appliances (Table
2).

We tested two FFR models, the Halyard Fluidshield 3 and the Uniair San Huei, after sequential rounds
of heat treatment and performed blinded comparisons of their fit and filtration properties to control,
untreated FFRs. The control Uniair San Huei FFR did not fit any of our volunteers and exhibited widely
varying fit test results, and was thus excluded from our final analysis of potential decontamination
methods. This result emphasizes the importance of regular fit testing, as proper fit is paramount for
appropriate protection. For the Halyard Fluidshield 3 FFRs, we measured fit and filtration efficiency
after each round of treatment. We found that bending over reduces fit factor, and therefore protection,
the most (Fig 3). We propose that paying special attention to movement-specific fit testing results when
fitting a respirator could aid the end user to adjust their behavior while wearing FFRs (e.g., kneeling
vs. bending).

We show that the Halyard Fluidshield 3 fit and filtration efficiency are preserved for up to five rounds
of treatment using the Keep warm function of a rice cooker with precise temperature control. The CDC
does not recommend re-using FFRs more than five times, so we did not subject the respirators to more
than five rounds of treatment 10. Sous vide machine treated masks preserved fit only up to four rounds,
possibly because the respirator was slightly deformed by the water and weights. Flow and filtration
analysis of treated FFRs demonstrated that none of the heat treatment methods lowered filtration
efficiency below the required 95%. Moreover, we found that even the boiled Halyard Fluidshield 3
FFRs tested for this study preserved FE after three rounds of treatment, which is greater than what has

been previously reported 32. It should be noted that this particular model of FFR, which was designed
to protect against fluid splashes in the operating room, is rated as a surgical N95 and is thus considered
water-resistant. Further research should be done to determine whether splash-protective respirators
are more resistant to changes in FE during humid or water-immersive treatment conditions. Overall,
while boiling may be a suitable way to decontaminate FFRs, repeated treatment reduced fit below the
passing score much faster than ‘dry’ heat 9,31.

Our results suggest that at-home appliances are a viable option for decontamination of masks. Since
only a limited number of appliances were tested, it is essential for the user to test the selected appliance
to guarantee it can reach and maintain 70°C for 60 minutes before attempting decontamination. Such
testing can be done in a home environment, for example, by using a precise meat thermometer. As is
also the case for commercial decontamination methods, it is essential to carefully examine the FFR after
each round of heat exposure to ensure that it has no material damage, burns or tears. As indicated by
differences in the goodness of fit between FFR models and between individual FFRs exposed to the
same decontamination treatment, it is imperative to carefully examine the FFR before the first use and
after each treatment and ensure close fit of the mask all around the face.

It is also important to note that FFRs treated with a dry heat at 70°C decontamination procedure as
demonstrated here, will not be sterilized. Pathogens such as Clostridium difficile will not be killed and
could still pose a risk to public health. Therefore, appliance-heat treated FFRs using methods like the
ones described here should always be re-used by the same person 33.

While not recommended for clinical or routine use, the potential decontamination methods evaluated
here demonstrate that household appliances could constitute a low-cost strategy for N95
decontamination that could be performed in resource-constrained settings or situations where no
viable alternative exists. We note also that our analysis of decontamination conditions and test results
on medical-grade FFRs suggest that similar at-home heat-treatment methods would likely be effective
for decontaminating other COVID-exposed materials, such as cloth face masks, as long as the same
provisions are taken.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mask treatment
Testing was performed on two N95 FFR models, the standard Halyard Fluidshield 3 (TC-84A-7521)
and the Uniair San Huei SH3500 (TC-84A-4313) (Fig S2). FFRs were randomly assigned to either a
treatment group or a control group of untreated masks 15,34. Potential decontamination protocols were
repeated up to five times for masks treated at 70ºC and up to three times for masks that were boiled
(Fig 1). The maximum of five rounds of treatment follows the current CDC safety recommendations
for FFR reuse as part of crisis capacity and conservation strategies

. The Columbia University

Institutional Review Board reviewed this study’s protocol and determined that ethical approval could
be waived (IRB reference AAAT5503).

To heat the FFRs at 70ºC for one hour, we used two different types of home appliances: a rice cooker
and a sous vide machine. Temperature within each appliance was recorded for the duration of the
treatment using a wireless sensor (Inkbird Thermometer IBS-TH1) for the rice cooker and MeatStick

Wireless Thermometer 4335995327 for the sous vide machine. Both thermometers were benchmarked
against a calibrated lab thermometer (Oakton Acorn Series pH 5 Meter and Thermometer) for accuracy.
FFRs that were assigned to be decontaminated in the rice cooker were placed in breathable paper bags
and the rice cooker was preheated to 70ºC using the Keep Warm mode. After the rice cooker reached
the specified temperature, the paper bag containing the mask was inserted and the temperature held at
70º C for 60 minutes. For treatment with the sous vide machine, FFRs were sealed in a polypropylene
plastic bag (double protection Ziploc© Freezer Bags) before being placed in the water preheated to 70º
C. In order to completely submerge the FFR, a 140 g weight was placed on top of the plastic bag. The
temperature of the sous vide machine was set to 70ºC for 60 minutes. FFRs subjected to boiling were
submerged directly in 1.3 L of boiling water at 100 ºC within a 1.4 L pot and were drained and allowed
to air-dry overnight post-treatment (Fig 2, photo panels).

FFR fit test
Quantitative fit tests were performed using the manufacturer provided “N95” setting of a calibrated TSI
PortaCount Pro+ Respirator Fit Tester 8038 with ambient particulates and aqueous aerosols produced
by an ultrasonic humidifier (NYC tap water). Adherent to the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration’s (OSHA’s) Respiratory Protection Standard (29CFR 1910.134), the Condensation
Nuclei Counter (CNC) Quantitative Fit Test for Filtering Facepiece Respirators was used 27. This test
reports a quantitative fit factor score for seven sequential test components (normal breathing, deep
breathing, head side to side, head up and down, talking, bending over, and normal breathing) as well
as an overall fit factor that is the geometric mean of the seven individual scores. A fit score of ≥ 100 is
considered passing in each individual category. Based on the OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard,

an overall fit factor of ≥ 100 is required for passing, regardless of performance (i.e., pass or fail) on each
test component 27. It should be noted that the system gives a maximum possible score of 200+ reported
as 201 34.

The CNC quantitative fit test was performed three times on all FFRs used in the experiment. We
obtained a pre-treatment baseline fit factor (blind control) and post-treatment fit tests (also blind) to
quantify fit factors and variance. All tests were performed on the same test subject to control for
variability in facial features. To minimize user bias, the experimenter and subject were both blinded to
which (if any) treatment each mask had undergone. Each mask was punctured and fitted with the
commercial metal hose adapter designed for use with the PortaCount Pro+ Respirator Fit Tester 8038
and then coupled via 3/16” vinyl tubing to the Portacount unit. As per CDC recommendations, a user
seal check was performed prior to each fit test measurement and adjustments were made until the user
deemed that there were no detectable air leaks during forceful breathing 10.

FFR filtration efficiency test
Due to the limited availability of NIOSH test apparatus, a modified version of the standard NIOSH
procedure (TEB-APR-STP-0059) was developed to determine the particulate filter efficiency of N95
FFRs (41). Respirator filters were challenged by a NaCl aerosol generated using a humidifier (Vicks©
Filter-Free Cool Mist Humidifier) filled with 2% saline solution. Non-neutralized particles were
released into a polycarbonate test chamber (~150 L volume), which was maintained at a minimum 0.3μm particle count of 5000 particles per ft 3. Each FFR was manually secured over an iso-KF 25 fitting.
After ~10 cm of ~25 mm ID stainless steel tubing, another KF-25 to barbed fitting joined via 3/8” ID

silicone tubing connected to the both the calibrated particle counter (Extech Instruments VCP300) and
a high-performance surgical smoke removal device used as an evacuator (Buffalo Filter VisiClear)
through a “wye” fitting (Fig 4A). Pressure drop across the filter is monitored with a Sensirion SDP8500 differential pressure sensor, and the air flow volume is monitored by a Sensirion Mass Flow Meter
(part number SFM3300-D). Both devices are read through their I2C communications channel through
a custom program running on an Arduino Uno and then recorded on a PC at rates over 10 Hz.

Tests were conducted at a flow rate of 10 lpm with a 4.54 cm2 area of effective filtration, which exceeds
the rate of 85 lpm used during NIOSH testing when our filter patch is scaled proportionally to the area
of the entire mask 35. We compensated for any variation in the impedance of the mask material by
changing the strength of the suction of the evacuator to obtain a flow rate of 10 lpm through each mask
or blank (nozzle open to allow for unimpeded ambient air flow) prior to each filtration test.

Before measuring the filtration efficiency of each decontaminated or control FFR, the baseline ambient
particle count within the aerosol shield chamber was measured as the particle count downstream of an
open nozzle. First, particles were suctioned through either a blank or mask at a flow rate of 10 lpm for
20 seconds, then the suction was switched off. Then, following a 5 second pre-counting sample draw,
the cumulative number of same-sized particles downstream of each mask or blank were counted over
a 20 second sampling period at a 2.83 lpm sampling rate controlled by the particle counter’s internal
pump. The total volume of the internal tubing, sensors, and stainless port was ~1.35 liters, and designed
such that the bulk of the air sampled by the particle counter during its total 25 second counter operation
was air drawn through the filter unit at the 10 lpm volume flow rate, not air drawn through the filter

by the pump action of the particle counter. Particles binned into 0.3 μm, 0.5 μm, 1 μm, 2.5 μm, 5 μm,
and 10 μm size classes were measured. The filtration efficiency (FE) was calculated using the equation,
𝐹𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 (𝐹𝐸) = (1 −

𝐶𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘
𝐶𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟

) × 100%

where 𝐶𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘 and 𝐶𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 denote the concentrations of particles of the same size downstream of the
mask and within the aerosol chamber, respectively. For each FFR, flow test measurements of two
different central N95 material areas were obtained to sample the variance.

To assess the sensitivity of our modified flow test, the filtration efficiency of an untreated control FFR
before and after introducing damage was measured using the same experimental setup and
methodology as described above. Filtration efficiency test sensitivity was determined in two mask areas
that were punctured with an 18-gauge needle one to three times (Fig S5, Table S8). Each puncture was
at most 0.3% of the filter area, yet reduced filtering efficiency of the 0.3 um particles by roughly 25%
(e.g., from >95% to 75%). This large reduction in efficiency from such a small leak highlights the
importance of proper fit, with no voids, for effective protection.

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were run in the R software environment (v4.0.1). The decrease of fit factors
over repeated treatment was evaluated using linear regressions (stat_smooth function, method=lm,
ggplot2 v3.3.0). Variance component analyses were calculated with nested one-Way ANOVA
(aov(score~treatment+Error(mask)). F-values and significance levels for the F-statistics reported 36.

three appliance-based heat treatment methods: Cuckoo rice cooker, sous vide machine and boiling.
Boiled FFRs were treated up to three times. FFRs heated with sous vide machine and Cuckoo rice
cooker were treated up to five times. Control FFRs were not exposed to any treatment. (C) Treatmentexposed and control FFRs were fit tested using the built-in N95 setting of a TSI PortaCount Pro+

Fit Factors (Fig 2) and fit values for the different testing categories (Fig 3) were recorded. (D) The effect
of appliance-based heat treatment on FFR filtration performance was evaluated for treatment and
control FFRs using a modified version of the standard NIOSH test (Fig 4). Filtration efficiency was
tested on two different FFR areas. For the Uniair San Huei SH3500 (TC-84A-4313) model, FFRs were
only exposed to heat using the Cuckoo rice cooker and the sous vide machine. They were treated up to
three times. Fit was estimated for both treatment and control FFRs as it is described in (C), the masks
were not tested for filtration performance.

were drawn through the FFR by an evacuator suction pump and diverted to a particle counter. FFR
impedance was measured through a pressure sensor attached to the sample holder. (B) The filtration
efficiency for different particle sizes (bins of 0.3 µm, 0.5 µm, 1 µm, 2.5 µm, 5 µm, and 10 µm size classes)
were determined for two mask regions of FFRs that were exposed to different methods and repetitions
