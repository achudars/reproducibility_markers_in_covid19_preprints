The Evaluation of Sleep Disturbances for Chinese Frontline Medical Workers
under the Outbreak of COVID-19

Summary
Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in China remains to be a
serious challenge for frontline medical workers (fMW). They are under high risk of
being infected and high mental stress, which may lead to sleep disturbances, anxiety,
and depression.
Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate sleep disturbances of fMW
and made a comparison with non-fMW. The medical workers from multiple hospitals
in Hubei Province, China, were volunteered to participate. An online questionnaire,
including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), and
Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and mental
status of fMW. Sleep disturbances were defined as PSQI>7 points or/and AIS>6
points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS, and
prevalence of sleep disturbances between fMW and non-fMW. Subgroup analysis for
different gender in fMW was conducted.
Findings A total of 1306 subjects (including 801 fMW and 505 non-fMW) were
enrolled. Compared to non-fMW, fMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (p

＜

＜0.0001), anxiety (p＜0.0001) and depression (p=0.0010), and
higher prevalence of sleep disturbances with PSQI > 7 points (p＜0.0001) and AIS >
6 points (p＜0.0001). In subgroup analysis, compared to male fMW, female fMW had

Introduction
As a group of enveloped RNA viruses, coronaviruses are distributed broadly among
humans and other animals, and can cause multi-organ infections, mainly invade the
respiratory system.1 In December 2019, several pneumonia patients with cryptogenic
etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.2 A novel coronavirus was
identified as the arch-criminal and has established efficient human-to-human
transmission. It subsequently was named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by
the World Health Organization (WHO). With the unknown mighty infectivity,
COVID-19 has spread rapidly, confirmed cases were reported in Wuhan, Hubei
Province, other regions in China, and other countries successively.3,4 The grim
situation has attracted worldwide attention. More than 75000 cases were confirmed
with COVID-19 in China, including 3000 doctors and nurses at least,5 who have
become the high-risk susceptible population to the disease. In addition to the risk of
being infected with COVID-19, frontline medical workers (fMW) may have sleep
disturbances, anxiety, and depression when facing with a magnitude outburst public
health incident.

Sleep disturbances are defined as the mental or/and physical status that trigger a series
of adverse symptoms owing to abnormal amount of sleep or/and poor sleep quality,
and remain to be one of the global health concerns. Sleep disturbances have a
prevalence ranging from 8.3% to 45%.6,7 By comparison to the general population, it
was reported that medical workers may have higher prevalence of insomnia.8 Medical

workers are generally under great pressure, irregular work time, and frequent
day-night work shifts, which may lead to the increasing of sleep disturbances.9 In a
meta-analysis from China, Qiu et al.7 found that 39.2% of Chinese medical workers
suffered from sleep disturbances, and the prevalence was much higher than the
general population. The outbreak of COVID-19 in China remains to be a serious
challenge for fMW. There is no doubt that they are not only under high risk of being
infected with the disease but also high mental stress, which may lead to acute sleep
disturbances or mental disorders. However, as far as we know, few studies have
concentrated on the sleep disturbances of fMW under the emergent events of public
health, especially in the outbreak of COVID-19.

Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate the sleep disturbances of
fMW in the battle against COVID-19, and made a comparison with non-fMW.

Methods
Study samples
This cross-sectional study included medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei
Province, China. The Institutional Review Board of Chinese PLA General Hospital
approved this study. The study protocol was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was waived due to the cross-sectional
nature of this study. All of subjects included in the study were anonymous and
volunteered to participate. Subjects were divided into two groups according to the

existence of directive exposure to COVID-19 patients, including fMW and non-fMW.
The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (a) age older than 18 years old;
(b) medical workers from hospitals in Hubei Province, including local medical
workers and supportive medical workers from other Chinese regions; (c) involved in
the battle against COVID-19 directly or/and indirectly, and (d) volunteered to
participate in the survey. The exclusion criteria were listed as follows: (a) has been
diagnosed as sleep disturbances; (b) sleep quality was affected by physical or
psychological diseases; (c) sleep quality was affected by negative personal events; (d)
within the treatment course for mental or/and physical diseases, and (e) incomplete
data of the online questionnaires.

Data collection
The online survey was conducted in February 2020 among medical workers from
multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, with the contents encompassing basic
information (age, gender, marriage, education level, etc.), epidemiological
investigation, details of work, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens
Insomnia Scale (AIS), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the factors influencing sleep
quality, etc. PSQI is a self-reported questionnaire which assesses subjective sleep
quality within one month. It comprises of seven components, including sleep quality,
sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, sleep medication,
and daytime function. A subject with total score > 7 points is defined as poor sleep
quality.10 In general, the higher the PSQI, the worse the sleep quality. AIS is a brief

instrument to assess the severity of insomnia. It contains eight items with each item
rated from 0 to 3 points. The sum of eight items’ scores is regarded as total score. A
subject with total score > 6 points is diagnosed as insomnia. In general, the higher the
AIS, the severer the insomnia.11 A 10-items VAS measure was used to investigate
emotional status of subjects, including work pressure, attention, anxiety, energy,
confidence, irritability, stress, impatience, fear, and depression. The VAS was
conducted online as a horizontal graphic slider, which was divided into ten segments
from one (weakest) to ten (strongest). The VAS scores could represent the degree of
their feelings. Higher scores indicate stronger feeling of each emotional state. We
used scores of VAS to compare anxiety and depression between fMW and non-fMW.

Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were described as frequencies and percentages, and continuous
variables were described as the mean ± SDs. Statistical analyses were performed
using SPSS 23.0 for Windows (IBM, Somers, NY). The demographic characteristics
were compared by non-parametric test for continuous variables and by Pearson’s
chi-square test for categorical variables between two groups. The scores of PSQI, AIS,
anxiety, and depression VAS were compared by ANOVA. The variables with
significant differences between two groups in demographic characteristics were
described as covariates and joined in the process of ANOVA. In the subgroup analysis
of fMW, the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety, and depression VAS were compared by
ANOVA between male and female fMW. Partial correlation analysis was conducted to

was considered to indicate statistical significance in all statistical analyses.

Results
Subject demographic characteristics
A total of 1306 medical workers (801 in fMW group and 505 in non-fMW group;
Figure 1) with age of (33.1±8.4) years old were enrolled in the study, comprising 256
(19.6%) males and 1050 (80.4%) females. There were 161 (20.1%) males and 640
(79.9%) females in fMW group. The detailed demographic characteristics are
presented in Table 1. There were 893 (68.4%) subjects married and 156 (11.9%)
subjects had high education level (Master’s degree and Doctor’s degree). Only 148
(11.3%) subjects had advanced-rank in hospitals, who may present with more affluent
working experience and positive attitudes toward COVID-19. In demographic
characteristics, significant differences of age ([32.4±7.7] vs [34.1±9.3]; p=0.016),
education level (p=0.0020), and rank (p=0.0010) were found between the fMW group
and non-fMW group.

Comparison of scores and prevalence
The detailed comparisons of scores between two groups are presented in Table 2. The
scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety, and depression VAS in fMW group were 9.3±3.8,
6.9±4.3, 4.9±2.7, 4.1±2.5, respectively, and in non-fMW group, they were 7.5±3.7,
5.3±3.8, 4.3±2.6, 3.6±2.4, respectively. Compared to non-fMW group, the fMW

depression (4.1 vs 3.6; p=0.0010; Figure 2D).

The detailed comparison of prevalence of sleep disturbances between two groups are
presented in Table 3. There were 538 (67.2%) of 801 fMW and 241 (47.7%) of 505
non-fMW with PSQI > 7 points, which indicated over 60% of fMW had poor sleep
quality. Meanwhile, AIS > 6 points was observed in 414 (51.7%) of 801 fMW and
180 (35.6%) of 505 non-fMW, which indicated that over half of fMW had insomnia.
Furthermore, compared to non-fMW group, the fMW group had significantly higher
prevalence of sleep disturbances, according to PSQI > 7 points (538 [67.2%] of 801

In the subgroups analysis, detailed comparisons of scores between male and famale
fMW are presented in Table 4. The scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety, and depression VAS
in male fMW group were 8.6±4.3, 6.4±4.7, 4.6±2.7, 3.8±2.4, respectively, and in
female fMW group, they were 9.4±3.8, 7.0±4.2, 5.0±2.7, 4.2±2.5, respectively.
Compared to the male fMW group, female fMW group had significantly higher score
of PSQI (9.4 vs 8.6; p=0.022; Figure 4A), while no significant differences were found
in AIS (7.0 vs 6.4; p=0.11), anxiety (5.0 vs 4.6; p=0.14), and depression (4.2 vs 3.8;
p=0.20). In addition, 450 (70.3%) of 640 female fMW and 88 (54.7%) of 161 male

fMW had PSQI >7 points. And compared to male fMW group, the female fMW group
had significantly higher prevalence of sleep disturbances, according to PSQI > 7
points (450 [70.3%] of 640 vs 88 [54.7%] of 161; p<0.0001; Figure 4B). In summary,
the female fMW in battle against COVID-19 are more vulnerable to suffering from
sleep disturbances according to the PSQI score.

The factors influencing sleep quality
The detailed comparisons of factors influencing sleep quality between fMW group
and non-fMW group are presented in Table 5. From the perspective of 1306 medical
workers, severity of COVID-19 was the leading factor (497 [38.1%]) influencing
sleep quality, followed by frequent work shifts (415 [31.8%]), work stress (408
[31.2%]), and insufficient sleep time (235 [18.0%]). Compared to non-fMW, more

Partial correlation analysis of PSQI, AIS, anxiety, and depression VAS
Partial correlation analysis was conducted to explore association between PSQI, AIS,
anxiety, and depression VAS by adjusting for gender (Table 6). PSQI was significantly
correlated with anxiety (rp=0.442; p<0.0001) and depression (rp=0.329; p<0.0001).
And significant association was observed between AIS and anxiety (rp=0.526;

Discussion
The outbreak of COVID-19 in China has aroused extensive public concern in recent
months.2 Many countries are also experiencing the invasion of COVID-19, such as
Japan, South Korea, Italy, Iran, etc.12 The rapid spread of the disease and inadequate
early realization toward COVID-19 challenged the health institutions in many
countries. In addition, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2.3%, and medical workers
accounted for 3.8% in COVID-19 patients, as reported by the latest epidemiological
study.13 Previous studies have indicated that in ordinary times, medical workers were
vulnerable to sleep disturbances, which may be higher than the general population.7,8
Therefore, we hypothesized that fMW under the outbreak of COVID-19 in China may
be more susceptible to sleep disturbances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to evaluate the sleep disturbances of fMW under the outbreak of
COVID-19.

Although sleep disturbances distribute widely among the population, the prevalence
varies among different occupations and work pressure.14-16 A USA National Health
Interview Survey showed short sleep duration disturbed 29.9% of civilian employed
workers, including 40.5% of enterprise managers, 37.1% of
transportation/warehousing, and 34.8% of manufacturing, and indicated that sleep
disturbances have increased over the past decades.15 Similarly, a nationwide study in

China demonstrated that civil servants had the shortest sleep duration (Mean 7.85
hours) and the worst sleep quality, who may experience with more work pressure.14
Meanwhile, 64.1% of police officers had PSQI > 5 points, and were regarded as sleep
disturbances as reported. Their sleep disturbances were related to posttraumatic stress
and general psychopathology.17 A survey from Japan indicated that high occupational
stress was significantly associated with insomnia, especially the presence of high
efforts but low reward.18 And exposure to long working hours and irregular work
shifts may attribute to stress, fatigue, and chronic diseases,19 which may influence the
quantity and quality of sleep. Schiller et al.16 compared sleep quality and sleep
duration between full worktime subjects and 75% reduced worktime subjects, and
found the latter presented with improved sleep quality and sleep duration. The
reduction of worktime may be useful for alleviating sleep disturbances.

Accompanied with long working hours, frequent day-night shifts, excessive workload,
and high stress, medical workers were vulnerable to sleep disturbances or sleep
deprivation all over the world.20 Pikovsky et al.21 found that 63% and 49% of medical
residents presented with low professional performance and judgement levels after the
night shifts, respectively. The long working hours could potentially increase the
fatigue of medical workers and be linked to the occurrence of medical errors. 22
Meanwhile, sleep deprivation could influence the medical workers in making quick
and appropriate decisions for patients, which was fatal to patient care.23 Deng et al. 24
reported that job difficulty, doctor-patient relationship, psychosomatic state,

environment or events, promotion or competition, and total pressure scores were
related to sleep disturbances for community nurses. Tucker et al.25 found moderate
work time control for medical workers could improve the sleep quantity that frequent
nigh work resulted in, and work time control had association with fewer sleep
disturbances. Therefore, it is rational to believe that increased work stress plays a
critical role in sleep disturbances of medical workers. With the booming of Chinese
economy in past decades, patient visits per physician in China increased by 135% and
inpatient admissions per physician rose by 184%. Workload has increased
dramatically for Chinese physicians, which exerted a trend that potentially threatened
physicians’ health and quality of patient care.26 The prevalence of sleep disturbances
in Chinese medical workers was 12.9%-78%.7 The present study showed that over
50% of fMW under the outbreak of COVID-19 had sleep disturbances. Although it is
even higher than that of in normal times, the prevalence is still compatible to previous
results from China. The high prevalence of sleep disturbances of fMW in battle
against COVID-19 should be put much emphasize. It was reported that sleep
characteristics may exert critical effects on immune functions, which may increase the
inflammatory response to sleep deprivation and exert negative feedback to aggravate
the short sleep duration and increase the risk of cardiovascular, respiratory, and
metabolic disorders. 27 Thus, sleep disturbances would further increase the possibility
of fMW being infected with COVID-19 owing to affected immune system. Therefore,
it is imperative to concern on sleep disturbances of fMW, aiming to maintain their
healthy condition and guarantee their professional performance in the battle against

COVID-19.

Our study showed that the overall scores of PSQI and AIS for fWM were significantly
higher than that of non-fWM, which indicated fMW had worse sleep compared to
non-fMW. There were 538 (67.2%) and 414 (51.7%) of 801 fMW with PSQI > 7
points and AIS > 6 points, respectively, which were regarded as having sleep
disturbances. Our study also demonstrated that the fWM group had significantly
higher prevalence of sleep disturbances than that of non-fWM. In addition, the fWM
group had significantly longer sleep latency, shorter sleep duration, lower sleep
efficiency, and worse daytime function according to the scores of components of
PSQI. Change of work environment may underpin the severer sleep disturbances of
fMW. With the direct contact with COVID-19 patients, fMW are inclined to emerge
anxiety and worries of being infected. The rapid spread of COVID-19 boomed the
medical demands, aggravated the shortage of medical resources, and increased work
stress for fMW, especially for those with continuous working and frequent day-night
shifts. And in terms of factors influencing sleep quality, severity of COVID-19,
frequent work shifts, and work stress were the leading factors according to our study.
We further found anxiety and depression were significantly correlated with PSQI and
AIS in fMV, which indicated that anxious and depressive symptoms may influence
sleep quality of fMW. The result was consistent with previous studies demonstrating
that anxiety and depression played a key role in the development of sleep
disturbances.28 This would provide evidence for further targeted interventions to

improve sleep disturbances in fMW. However, with the import of supportive fMW
from other regions of China, the work duration of fMW may be decreased. By
comparison, the non-fMW worked in a relatively mild environment and had less
possibility of being infected, thus having less sleep disturbances. Our study also found
that scores of PSQI among female fMW were significantly higher than that of male
fMW although other scores showed no significant difference, which indicated that
female fMW had worse sleep quality than male fMW in emergent events of public
health. In a meta-analysis, Zhang et al. 29 calculated a hazard ratio of 1.41 for female
versus male toward insomnia. In general, females had inferior symptom bearing and
more bodily vigilance, and the social culture encouraged females to express the
indisposition more,30 which potentially exaggerated the severity and prevalence of
sleep disturbances. In addition, females tended to report more sleep problems even if
having a similar degree of morning awakening compared to males.29

Our study has several limitations that should be noted. First, this is a cross-sectional
study. All subjects were volunteered to participate in the survey, so there may be
subject selection bias. Second, other occupations who directly expose to COVID-19
patients may experience sleep disturbances potentially, such as police and social
workers, but our study merely included the medical workers. Third, our
questionnaires did not contain sufficient items, such as the potential risk factors for
sleep disturbances of fMW, which can provide more information and be used to
explore the underlying mechanisms. Forth, our study lacked of interventions and

follow-ups, which may show the following changes of sleep disturbances for fMW .

In conclusion, our study showed that over half of the fMW had sleep disturbances in
the outbreak of COVID-19. fMW had higher prevalence of sleep disturbances and
worse sleep quality than non-fMW. And female fMW showed severer sleep
disturbances compared to male fMW. Further interventions should be administrated
for fMW, aiming to maintain their healthy condition and guarantee their professional
performance in the battle against COVID-19. However, further prospective
randomized controlled trials are warranted to validate our results.
