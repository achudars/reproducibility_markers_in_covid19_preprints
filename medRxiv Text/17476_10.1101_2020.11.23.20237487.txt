Abstract
Background
South Korea was one of the epicenters for both the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
and 2019 COVID-19 outbreaks. However, there has been a lack of published literature,
especially using the Electronic Medical Records (EMR), that provides a comparative
summary of the prognostic factors present in the coronavirus-derived diseases. Therefore, in
this study, we aimed to evaluate the distinct clinical traits between the infected patients of
different coronaviruses to observe the extent of resemblance within the clinical features and
to identify unique factors by disease severity that may influence the prognosis of COVID-19
patients.
Methods
We utilized the common data model (CDM), which is the database that houses the
standardized EMR. We set COVID-19 as a reference group in comparative analyses. For
statistical methods, we used Levene’s test, one-way Anova test, Scheffe post-hoc test,
Games-howell post-hoc test, and Student’s t-test for continuous variables, and chi-squared
test and Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. With the variables that reflected
similarity in more than two comparisons between the disease groups yet significantly
different between the COVID-19 severity groups, we performed univariate logistic regression
to identify which common manifestations in coronaviruses are risk factors for severe
COVID-19 outcomes.
Findings
We collected the records of 2840 COVID-19 patients, 67 MERS patients (several suspected
cases included), 43 SARS suspected patients, and 87 HCoV patients. We found that a
significantly higher number of COVID-19 patients had been diagnosed with comorbidities
compared to the MERS and HCoV groups (48.5% vs. 10.4 %, p < 0.001 and 48.5% vs.
35.6%, p < 0.05) and also that the non-mild COVID-19 patients reported more comorbidities
than the mild group (55.7% vs. 47.8%, p < 0.05). There were overall increases in the levels of
fibrinogen in both sets of disease and severity groups. The univariate logistic regression
showed that the male sex (OR: 1.66; CI: 1.29-2.13, p < 0.001), blood type A (OR: 1.80; CI:
1.40-2.31, p < 0.001), renal disease (OR: 3.27; CI: 2.34-4.55, p < 0.001), decreased creatinine
level (OR: 2.05; CI: 1.45-2.88, p < 0.001), and elevated fibrinogen level (OR: 1.59, CI: 1.212.09, p < 0.001) are associated with the severe COVID-19 prognosis, whereas the patients
reporting gastrointestinal symptoms (OR: 0.42; CI: 0.23-0.72, p < 0.01) and increased
alkaline phosphatase (OR: 0.73; CI: 0.56-0.94, p < 0.05) are more less likely to experience
complications and other severe outcomes from the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Interpretation
The present study observed the highest resemblance between the COVID-19 and SARS
groups as clinical manifestations that were present in SARS group were linked to the severity
of COVID-19. In particular, male individuals with blood type A and previous diagnosis of
kidney failure were shown to be more susceptible to developing the poorer outcomes during
COVID-19 infection, with a presentation of elevated level of fibrinogen.

Background
COVID-19, a global pandemic that has caused more than 2 million deaths and over 90
million cases since its outbreak1, is a novel respiratory viral disease caused by the SARSCoV-2 virus that was first discovered in Wuhan, China, in December of 20192-5.
Coronaviruses are the RNA viruses that are commonly present in bats and belong to the
family Coronaviridae. The family comprises four genera, Alphacoronavirus,
Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus, of which the two,
Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus are known to cause respiratory infections in humans.
In addition to the COVID-19, there are six other human coronaviruses that have been
previously reported since the 1960s6, including HCoV229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43,
HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV. While the HCoV strains cause mild upper
respiratory diseases, the zoonotic strains including the SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and
SARS-CoV-2 cause severe respiratory symptoms and complications with high mortality
rates6-15. With the continuum of emergency outbreaks from coronavirus, a comparative
assessment of the clinical traits between the infections and a stratification of common clinical
variables by severity of the novel COVID-19 can be, therefore, useful in determining the
specific at-risk population of each disease, risk factors of infection and severity, and degree
of resemblance between the coronaviruses, in order to establish a comprehensive set of data.
Thus, in this study, we aim to perform, using the real-world data of Seoul National University
Hospital, a clinical characterization of the infected and suspected South Korean patients of
HCoV strains, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, and observe whether any
common or distinct trait observed between the diseases may significantly influence the
prognosis of the COVID-19 patients.

Methods
I. Data source
We designed a retrospective cohort observational study using Observational Medical
Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) based in Seoul National
University Hospital located in Seoul, South Korea. CDM is the database that houses the
Electronic Medical Records (EMR) transformed into the common format to be used by the
multiple institutions for research purposes. It is the global data network shared by 19 different
countries with more than half a billion patient records altogether16. The platform provides
deidentified patient records of demographics, diagnosis, hospital admission, provider,
prescription, and laboratory values, and vital statues16. Due to the privacy policy, there was
no patient mortality information in our database. There was no patient or public involvement
in this study. The study was approved by the Seoul National University Hospital Institutional
Review Board (Seoul, South Korea) on April 2nd, 2020.
II. Study Cohort
The follow-up period was from October 15th of 2004 to July 31st of 2020. Without any
restriction on age and gender, we collected the records of symptoms, comorbidities, and
laboratory test results of patients who were diagnosed with HCoV229E, HCoV-NL63,
HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 (HCoVs), SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2

infections using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)17. The
index date of virus infection was determined by the first visit to the hospital. It is to note that
the PCR results were not available, and the study cohorts were established solely on the
diagnoses from the EMR. Therefore, SARS-CoV-1 group in this study involves the suspected
individuals who showed clinical symptoms of SARS at the time of their hospital visits and
had been diagnosed as SARS. MERS-CoV group also includes the several suspected cases.
We divided the COVID-19 patients by their disease severity based on the published criteria
from the World Health Organization (WHO)18. Among the COVID-19 patients, those who
experienced mild cold-like symptoms with no existing pneumonia were classified as mild,
whereas the patients who reported any clinical presentation of pneumonia only or with
oxygen saturation (SpO2) under 90% were classified as non-mild. Laboratory test results
were divided into low, normal, and high levels with a reference to published ranges by Seoul
Clinical Laboratories19 (Appendix 1).
III. Statistical analysis
There are total three statistical analyses in this study. First, we conducted a comparative
clinical characterization of four disease groups with COVID-19 group as a reference.
Continuous variables were expressed by the mean values with ± standard deviations (SD)
with the appropriate units whereas categorical variables were represented by frequency and
percentage (%). The Levene’s test, one-way Anova test, Scheffe post-hoc test, Games-howell
post-hoc test, and Student’s t-test were used to compare continuous variables, and the χ2 test
or Fisher’s exact test were used for the categorical variables20-25. With the same set of
variables, listed analyses above were performed to compare between the mild and non-mild
COVID-19 groups. To perform a univariate logistic regression26-27 to explore the extent of
influence by risk factors on severity of COVID-19, we set two criteria for a variable
selection. First, we considered statistical similarity between the variables of disease groups to
reflect clinical resemblance between the patients. Second, among the variables that showed
such similarity, we selected the ones with p-values less than 0.05 in severity analyses. The
regression model was adjusted for age and gender. We excluded any variable that had null or
sparse patient records. All statistical analyses were carried using R version 3.6.2.

Results
I. Comparative analyses between the coronavirus infections
Demographic and clinical characteristics
For the study, we collected the records of 2840 COVID-19 patients, 67 MERS patients, of
which some may be the suspected cases, 43 SARS suspected patients, and 87 other HCoV
patients. Table 1 shows the summary of clinical characteristics of the COVID-19, MERS,
SARS, and HCoV patients. Among the COVID-19 patients, the mean age was 49.5 ± 25.9
and 1457 (51.3%) were males. Among the MERS patients, the mean age was 33.0 ± 21.7 and
35 (52.2%) were males whereas among the SARS and HCoV patients, the mean age of
patients was 45.6 ± 30.9 and 10.6 ± 17.9, and 31 (72.1%) and 46 (52.9%) were males,
respectively. From the comparison, COVID-19 group was significantly more likely to
experience cancer (29.5% vs. 3.0%, p < 0.001) and gastrointestinal diseases (14.4% vs. 1.5%,
p < 0.01) compared to the MERS group, whereas a higher proportion of SARS patients

reported cerebrovascular (11.6% vs. 2.6%, p < 0.001), hepatic disease (11.6 % vs. 4.6 %, p <
0.05), renal disease (16.3% vs. 6.4%, p < 0.01) than the COVID-19 group. In symptom
presentation, MERS and HCoV patients experienced fever (79.1% vs. 33.0%, p < 0.001 and
56.3% vs. 33.0%, p < 0.001, respectively) and upper respiratory infections (28.4% vs 0.8%, p
< 0.001 and 34.5% vs 0.8%, p < 0.001) more frequently than the COVID-19 patients.

whereas the HCoV group reported an increase in the level of alkaline phosphatase. All groups
experienced high levels of fibrinogen. In complete blood cell counts, the levels of
hemoglobin (13.18 ± 2.12 vs. 10.87 ± 2.47, p < 0.001), hematocrit (39.66 ± 5.59 vs. 33.03 ±
7.24, p < 0.001), and red blood cell count (4.54 ± 0.73 vs. 3.58 ± 0.85, p < 0.001) were
significantly higher in the MERS group, whereas lymphocyte count (38.90 ± 27.00 vs. 18.44
± 17.10, p < 0.001), red blood cell count (3.80 ± 0.75 vs. 3.58 ± 0.85, p < 0.05), eosinophil
count (4.38 ± 6.09 vs. 1.37 ± 2.61, p < 0.01) were significantly higher in the HCoV group.
Within the kidney function, blood urea nitrogen level was significantly higher in COVID-19
group than the MERS group and SARS group (23.38 ± 20.07 vs. 15.78 ± 13.80, p < 0.01 and
23.38 ± 20.07 vs. 12.90 ± 11.77, p < 0.001, respectively) and a significantly higher level of
creatinine than the HCoV group (1.33 ± 1.77 vs. 0.58 ± 0.64, p < 0.01). eGFR was
significantly higher in the MERS and SARS groups compared to the COVID-19 group
(105.50 ± 61.10 vs. 78.27 ± 40.62, p < 0.001 and 107.50 ± 48.12 vs. 78.27 ± 40.62, p < 0.05,

We performed an additional association analysis between the ABO blood type and
coronavirus infections. As shown in Table 3, there were no statistically significant differences
between the COVID-19, SARS, and HCoV groups by blood types. Due to the missing
number of MERS patients who performed ABO blood test, we observed low p-values of less
than 0.05 between the COVID-19 and MERS group comparison.

In Table 4, the mean age of mild group was 47.9 ± 25.7 and 1298 (50.0%) were males, and
the mean age of non-mild group was 66.7 ± 22.6 and 159 (65.2%) were males. There were
total 1376 COVID-19 patients with the comorbidities, of which 1240 and 136 patients
belonged to the mild and non-mild group, respectively. By comparison, non-mild COVID-19
group presented significantly more comorbidities upon their hospital visits (55.7% vs. 47.8%,
p < 0.05), including cardiovascular disease (13.1 % vs. 7.0%, p < 0.001), cerebrovascular
disease (4.9% vs. 2.3%, p < 0.05), and renal disease (16.4% vs. 5.5 %, p < 0.01). For
symptoms, non-mild group had significantly higher proportion of individuals reporting
dyspnea (19.3% vs. 3.1%, p < 0.001), chest pain (5.7% vs. 1.9%, p < 0.001), and upper
respiratory infections (2.5% vs. 0.7%, p < 0.001).

Laboratory findings
Laboratory findings of each severity group are summarized in Table 6. From the table, we
observed an increase in the count of white blood cell and the levels of blood nitrogen urea
and fibrinogen within the non-mild group and an increase in the level of alkaline phosphatase
within the mild group. Both severity groups reported elevated levels of aminotransferases and
creatinine. Compared to the mild group, non-mild group showed statistically higher levels of
white blood cell count (11.13 ± 9.44 vs. 9.99 ± 0.16, p < 0.05), eosinophil count (1.93 ± 4.30
vs. 1.28 ± 2.25, p < 0.01), procalcitonin (0.21 ± 0.11 vs. 0.20 ± 0.11, p < 0.01), and platelet
(208.26 ± 120.78 vs. 190.18 ± 120.26, p < 0.05). While in liver function measurements, the
mild group showed higher levels of albumin (3.56 ± 0.74 vs. 3.30 ± 0.64, p < 0.001), alkaline
phosphatase (156.52 ± 200.38 vs. 123.94 ± 106.64, p < 0.001), and total bilirubin (1.45 ±
2.47 vs. 0.94 ± 1.16 , p < 0.001), they had lower levels of blood nitrogen urea (22.50 ± 19.56
vs. 29.56 ± 22.45, p < 0.001), creatinine (1.28 ± 1.71 vs. 1.78 ± 2.18, p < 0.001), and
fibrinogen (392.81 ± 135.42 vs. 449.46 ± 117.01, p < 0.001) compared to the non-mild group.

III. Logistic regression
In order to observe the extent of common clinical characteristics among disease groups that
may uniquely affect the prognosis of COVID-19 patients, we conducted a nominal logistic
regression with the variables that showed the p values higher than 0.05 in two thirds of the
comparative groups between the diseases and less than 0.05 in the analyses between the
disease severity groups. We found no collinearity between the variables. Table 7 below
shows the results from regression that has been adjusted for both age and gender. The
univariate logistic regression showed that the male patients (OR: 1.66; CI: 1.29-2.13, p <
0.001) with ABO blood type A (OR: 1.80; CI: 1.40-2.31, p < 0.001), renal disease (OR: 3.27;
CI: 2.34-4.55, p < 0.001), decreased creatinine (OR: 2.05; CI: 1.45-2.88, p < 0.001), and
increased level of fibrinogen (OR: 1.59, CI: 1.21-2.09, p < 0.001) are associated with the
higher risks of progressing towards the more severe stage whereas the patients with
gastrointestinal symptoms (OR: 0.42; CI: 0.23-0.72, p < 0.01) and increased alkaline
phosphatase (OR: 0.73; CI: 0.56-0.94, p < 0.05) are less likely to experience the severe
prognosis of the disease. Age was not associated with risk of high severity.

Figure 2 shows the proportion of patients with risk factors in non-mild group, of which
elevated fibrinogen level (72.5%) and male sex (58.2%) most commonly appeared. When
comparing the identical parameters in different disease groups, Figure 3 shows that the
proportions of patients in male sex (72.1%), blood type A (32.6%), dyspnea, and renal
disease were the highest in SARS group whereas the number of patients with elevated WBC
was the highest in MERS group. The rates of elevated fibrinogen were similar in SARS and
MERS groups with 25% and 26.2%, respectively.

Discussion
The present retrospective cohort study examined the clinical resemblance between the
coronavirus infected patients within South Korea and identified the common characteristics
and risk factors that can potentially influence a severity of the novel COVID-19. In our
findings, we discovered the most similarities in clinical features between the COVID-19
group, especially the non-mild COVID-19 patients, and SARS group, showing statistical
similarities that range from 75-89.5% in their manifestations. Our observation between the
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, analogous to a previous study by Petrosillo et al28, maybe
attributed to a resemblance of more than 80% in genomic sequences29. It is also to note that
the two viruses utilize an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, suggesting the
common cellular binding mechanism as the basis of parallel pathogeneses in COVID-19 and
SARS patients30-32.
Another important finding was that the male sex, blood type A, renal disease, and elevated
level of fibrinogen were major risk factors in virus infections and severe prognosis of
COVID-19. In line with our observation in the patient demographics, of which more than
50% of individuals were males, previous research on SARS data in Hong Kong showed
enhanced fatality rate in men by 21.9% compared to women with 13.2%33-34 whereas the
South Korean and Saudi Arabic MERS-CoV data predominantly reflected male sex in
infected population, with the respective frequencies of 65.2% and 59.1%35. One theory for a
higher risk in males includes greater circulating ACE2 levels than in women, which creates a
sex-dependent difference in virus infection36-39, evidenced by a positive correlation of
susceptibility of male mice to SARS-CoV and virus titers observed in a vitro study39.
However, sex-dependent discrepancy is multifactorial, which would also require further
investigations in relation to socioeconomic and behavioral elements.
In our study, we did not see a significant difference within a distribution of ABO blood types
between the disease groups, yet the proportion of blood type A individual was significantly
higher in the non-mild COVID-19 group. Such finding parallels to the meta-analysis on
Spanish and Italian patient data where the odds for having severe COVID-19 were higher in
A/AB groups as compared with B/O group40-41. While the research regarding the association
between ABO blood type and coronavirus infection is relatively new, one potential
mechanism of type A group’s susceptibility can be attributed to a strong affinity of SARSCoV-2 spike protein to the carbohydrates, such as galactose in the A antigen, unlike a
galactose amine that is present as end group saccharide in the B and O antigens42-43. Another
speculation pertaining to severity risk difference between the type A and non-A patients
involves a protective role of neutralizing anti-A antibody blocking the interaction of ACE2
and S protein44.

The kidney failures were evident in all disease groups and were shown to be the variable with
the second-highest risk rate next to dyspnea. Firstly, ACE2, which is present in multiple
organs has also been found to be highly expressed on renal cells, facilitating SARS-CoV-2
entry and consequent acute tubular injury, and occasionally collapsing focal segmental
glomerulopathy in the kidney tissue45-47. Studies suggest a decrease in the ACE2 as a result of
viral attachment to the receptor and the consequent elevation in the level of AngII and AT1R
l stimulation, which induce an aggravation of respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients48-52.
Further, CKD patients are predisposed to the poorer outcomes—their immunosuppressed
state and chronic systemic inflammation can increase the risks of developing more severe
complications and mortality53-54. Likewise, in our data, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and
acute kidney injury (AKI) were the two most frequently reported diagnoses.
Of the major laboratory findings, we noticed the overall increase fibrinogen in our cohorts,
especially within the non-mild COVID-19 group. Elevated fibrinogen level can be an
indicator for hypercoagulability due to viral pneumonia, which is a common complication in
coronavirus infections55-57. A literature review by Abou-Ismail et al revealed the
prothrombotic traits in SARS-CoV-2 patients globally58, which is also evidenced by our
records that showed occurrences of thrombotic manifestation including pulmonary embolism,
myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in COVID-19 and
SARS patients. Coagulopathy in coronavirus infected patients has been linked to a
heightened inflammatory response that typically leads to thrombo-inflammation. The
inflammation is suspected to begin in lungs damaging the pulmonary vasculature that leads to
thrombosis in the early stage of the disease58-66.
To conclude, our study detected the highest resemblance between the COVID-19 and SARS
groups. Further, clinical manifestations that were present in SARS group were linked to the
severity of COVID-19. The regression model, upon applying the common variables between
the disease groups, indicated male sex, blood type A, dyspnea, renal disease, and elevated
levels of white blood cell, platelet, fibrinogen and alkaline phosphatase, and decreased
creatinine level as the risk factors of severe COVID-19. Our study had several limitations;
first, there existed missing data, which may explain a disparity in our creatinine analyses.
Considering the relative nature of logistic regression, we speculate the model to presume the
contradictory correlations between the disease severity and creatinine level—only 16% of the
individuals with high creatinine level belonged to the non-mild group, yet it should be noted
that the number of admitted severe patients in Seoul National University Hospital was
relatively low. Further, there were missing PCR data available on our database— although
we utilized the diagnoses that existed on the system, there may involve the suspected cases,
especially within the SARS group. Therefore, this study provides the limited clinical
observations that represent the disease groups. Second, the study population was limited to
the patients at a single national hospital due to the limited study period. Thus, the results in
this study should not be generalized fully to other populations and ought to be considered
with a caution.
Yet, we maximized the benefit of utilizing the anonymized EMR data integrated into CDM,
which now is expanding in its scope globally for the vitalization of medical research67. Upon
choosing a database, we ensured that the domains from the CDW were equally available in
our CDM and that there were no gaps between the amount of data in each database with the
frequent extract, transform, and load (ETL) process. Thus, through the use of CDM, we were
able to reflect the real-world medical challenges in managing coronavirus infection,
providing the most updated clinical dynamics. To our knowledge, this is the first study that

attempts to clinically characterize and compare four major human coronavirus infections as
well as to identify the common risk factors found in previous viral infections that may
influence the prognosis of novel COVID-19. With our analyses that applied the variables of
both the statistical and clinical significance, we expect the results from the present study to
provide clinical insights that can be used as a basis for predicting the prospective clinical
representations by yet another coronavirus-derived illness in near future and to serve the
guidelines for clinical treatments of current patients. However, there still left a great
uncertainty around the set of symptoms and complications from coronavirus, and it is
absolutely crucial to further investigate for attaining a better understanding of the disease. For
future study, therefore, we recommend performing a cross-country clinical characterization
and survival analysis to determine risk factors that are particular to ethnic group, which shall
aid in developing more specific control and prevention schemes for each country. Moreover,
it will be insightful to analyze the manifestations at a multidimensional perspective, including
the patients’ socioeconomic background, nutritional status, and behavioral habit that might
exert an influence on the disease outcomes, with the integration of additional data from
multiple institutions.
