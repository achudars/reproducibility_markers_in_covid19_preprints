Abstract
Strict interventions were successful to control the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in China. As
transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing,
susceptibility to infection and disease, and COVID-19 dynamics remains unclear. To answer these
questions, we analyze contact surveys data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and
contact tracing information from Hunan Province. Daily contacts were reduced 7-9 fold during the
COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. Children 0-14
years were 59% (95% CI 7-82%) less susceptible than individuals 65 years and over. A transmission
model calibrated against these data indicates that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during
the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. While proactive school closures cannot interrupt
transmission on their own, they reduce peak incidence by half and delay the epidemic. These findings can
help guide global intervention policies.
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 originated in Wuhan
City, China in December 2019 and quickly spread nationally and globally, with 179,111 cases reported in
159 countries/territories/areas as of March 17, 2020 (1). A total of 80,894 cases of COVID-19, including
3,237 deaths, have been reported in mainland China, including 50,005 cases in Wuhan City and 361 cases
in Shanghai City. The epidemic in Wuhan and in the rest of China slowed down after implementation of
strict containment measures and movement restrictions (2). However key questions remain about the age
profile of susceptibility, symptoms, and infectivity with this disease, how social distancing alters
age-specific contact patterns, and how these factors interact to affect transmission. These questions will

also estimate age differences in susceptibility to infection and clinical disease based on contact tracing
information gathered by the Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), China.
Based on those findings, we develop a mathematical transmission model to disentangle how transmission
is affected by age differences in the biology of COVID-19 infection and disease, and altered mixing
patterns due to social distancing. In turn, we project the impact of social distancing and school closure on
COVID-19 transmission.
To estimate changes in age-mixing patterns associated with COVID-19 interventions, we performed
contact surveys in two cities, Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, and Shanghai, one of the largest and
most densely populated cities in southeast China. Shanghai experienced extensive importation of
COVID-19 cases from Wuhan as well as local transmission(3). The surveys were conducted from
February 1, 2020 to February 10, 2020, as transmission of COVID-19 peaked across China and stringent
interventions were in place. Participants in Wuhan were asked to complete a questionnaire describing
their contact behavior (4, 5) on two different days: i) a regular weekday between December 24, 2020 and
December 30, 2020, before the COVID-19 outbreak was officially recognized by the Wuhan Municipal
Health Commission (used as baseline); and ii) the day before the interview (outbreak period). A similar
survey was conducted in Shanghai to obtain information on contacts during the COVID-19 outbreak
period; contacts for the baseline period were based on a survey using the same design conducted in the
same city in 2017-2018 (6). Details are given in the Supplementary Material.
We analyzed a total of 1,245 contacts reported by 636 study participants in Wuhan, and 1,296 contacts
reported by 557 participants in Shanghai. In Wuhan, the average daily number of contacts per participant
was significantly reduced from 14.6 for a regular weekday (weighted mean contacts by age structure: 14.0)
to 2.0 for the outbreak period (weighted mean contacts by age structure: 1.9) (p<0.001). The reduction in
contacts was significant for all stratifications by sex, age group, type of profession, and household size,
except for pre-school children aged 0-6 years old (Tab. 1). A larger reduction was observed in Shanghai,
where the average daily number of contacts declined from 20.6 (weighted mean contacts by age structure:
21.7) to 2.3 (weighted mean contacts by age structure: 2.1). Although an average individual in Shanghai
reported more contacts than one in Wuhan on a regular weekday, this difference disappeared during the
COVID-19 outbreak period.
The typical features of age-mixing patterns(5, 6) emerge in Wuhan and Shanghai when we consider the
regular baseline weekday period (Fig. 1A and 1D). These features can be illustrated in the form of
age-stratified contact matrices (provided as ready-to-use tables in the Supplementary Materials), where
each cell represents the average number of contacts that an individual has with other individuals, stratified
by age groups. The bottom left corner of the matrix, corresponding to contacts between school age
children, is where the largest number of contacts is recorded. The contribution of contacts in the
workplace is visible in the central part of the matrix, while the three diagonals (from bottom left to top
right) represent contacts between household members. In contrast, for the outbreak period where strict
social distancing was in place, much of the above-mentioned features disappears, essentially leaving the
sole contribution of household mixing (Fig. 1B and 1E). In particular, contacts between school-age
individuals are fully removed, as highlighted by differencing baseline and outbreak matrices (Fig. 1C and
1F). Overall, contacts during the outbreak mostly occurred at home with household members (94.1% in
Wuhan and 78.5% in Shanghai), thus the outbreak contact matrix nearly coincides with the
within-household contact matrix in both study sites and the assortativity by age feature observed for
regular days almost entirely disappear (see Supplementary Materials).

To understand the interplay between social distancing interventions, changes in human mixing patterns,
and outbreak dynamics, we also need to consider potential age differences in susceptibility to infection.
This is currently a topic of debate, as little information on the age profile of asymptomatic cases is
available(7, 8). To this aim, we analyzed contact tracing information from detailed epidemiological field
investigations conducted by the Hunan CDC (Supplement). We calculated the age-specific relative risk of
infection for close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 index cases. Briefly, all close contacts of COVID-19
cases reported in Hunan province were placed under medical observation for 14 days and were tested
using real-time RT-PCR. Those who developed symptoms and tested positive were considered as
symptomatic confirmed cases, while contacts who tested positive without exhibiting symptoms were
considered as asymptomatic infections. The total of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections was used
to estimate the relative susceptibility to infection by age. The ratio of symptomatic cases to total
infections was used to estimate the relative probability of developing symptoms (see Supplementary
Material). We found age differences in susceptibility to SARS-CoV2 infection, where young individuals
(aged 0-14 years) had a lower risk of infection than individual ages 65 years and over (OR=0.41 (95%CI:
0.18-0.93), p-value=0.026). There was a weak non-significant trend towards lower susceptibility in
middle-aged adults, relative to seniors (OR=0.76, 95%CI: 0.46-1.24, Tab. 2). These findings are in
contrast with a previous study in Shenzhen, where susceptibility to infection did not change with age (7).
Moreover, we found that the relative probability of developing symptoms also increased with age,
however the difference was not statistically significant (Tab. 2).
Based on the estimated age-specific mixing patterns and susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, we
developed a SIR model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and tested the impact of social distancing measures
on disease dynamics. In the model, the population is divided into three epidemiological categories:
susceptible, infectious, and removed (either recovered or deceased individuals), stratified by 14 age
groups. Susceptible individuals can become infectious after contact with an infectious individual
according to the estimated age-specific susceptibility to infection. Because we did not see age differences
in the probability of developing symptoms upon infection, we assumed equal infectivity across all age
groups. The rate at which contacts occur is determined by the estimated mixing patterns in each age group.
A key parameter regulating the dynamics of the model is the basic reproduction number (R0), which
corresponds to the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case in a fully susceptible
population. The mean time interval between two consecutive generations of cases was taken to be 5.1
days (2). Details are reported in the Supplementary Materials.
For baseline R0 values in the range 2.0-3.5 associated with a regular weekday contact patterns
(corresponding to the early phase of COVID-19 spread in Wuhan (9-15)), we find that the profound
alteration of mixing patterns of the magnitude observed in Wuhan and Shanghai leads to a drastic
decrease in R0. When we consider contact matrices representing the outbreak period, keeping the same
baseline disease transmissibility as the pre-intervention period, the reproductive number drops well below
the epidemic threshold both in Wuhan and Shanghai (Fig. 2A). In an uncontrolled epidemic (without
intervention measure, travel restriction, or spontaneous behavioral response of the population), we
estimate the mean infection attack rate to be in the range 64%-92% after a year of SARS-CoV-2
circulation, with slight variation between Wuhan and Shanghai (variations of about 5%-12%, Fig. 2B).
On the other hand, if we consider a scenario where social distancing measures are implemented early on,
as the new virus emerges, the estimated R0 remains under the threshold and thus the epidemic cannot take
off in either location. Furthermore, we estimate that the magnitude of interventions implemented in
Wuhan and Shanghai would have been enough to bring the reproduction number below 1.0 for baseline
R0 up to ~7 in Wuhan and ~11.5 in Shanghai (Fig. 2A). We also conduct sensitivity analyses on

assumptions about the susceptibility profile of infections, since there is still uncertainty about this
parameter (see Supplementary Material). Our conclusions are robust to assuming equal susceptibility in
all age groups.
Finally, armed with a carefully calibrated model, we turn to assess the impact of a preemptive mass
school closure. We used the same estimates of relative susceptibility to infection by age as in our main
analysis (see Supplementary Material for a sensitivity analysis assuming equal susceptibility to infection).
We considered two different contact pattern scenarios, based on data from Shanghai: contacts estimated
during vacations period (6) and contacts estimated during regular weekdays, after all contacts occurring in
school settings have been removed (6). Either one of these scenarios represent a simplification of a school
closure strategy as during vacations children can still attend additional education, while removing all
contacts in the school setting does not take into account that, for instance, parents may need to leave work
to take care of children. We estimated that limiting contact patterns to those observed during vacations
would interrupt transmission for baseline R0 up to 1.5 (Fig. 2C). Removing all school contacts would do
the same for baseline R0 up to 1.2. If we apply these interventions to a COVID-19 scenario, assuming a
baseline R0 of 2 - 3.5, we can achieve a noticeable decrease in infection attack rate and peak incidence,
and a delay in the epidemic, but transmission is not interrupted (Fig. 2D). For instance, for baseline
R0=2.5 and assuming a vacation mixing pattern, the peak daily incidence is reduced by about 57%. In the
corresponding scenario where school contacts are removed, we estimate a reduction of about 20%.
Overall, school-based policies are not sufficient to entirely prevent a COVID-19 outbreak but they can
have a significant impact on disease dynamics, and hence on hospital surge capacity.
This study suffers from several limitations. First, the estimated mixing patterns for a regular weekday in
Wuhan may be affected by recall bias since contacts were assessed retrospectively. For Shanghai, we
relied on a survey conducted in December 2017 - May 2018, using the same design as the one conducted
during the outbreak period, thus avoiding recall bias. It is also important to note that changes in contact
patterns were measured in a context where social distancing was applied together with rapid isolation of
infected individuals (including suspected cases) and quarantine of close contacts for 14 days. Only a
small portion of the population in the two study sites was affected by contact tracing and quarantine, thus
having little to no effect on the average contact patterns of the general population. However, in
reconstructing the observed epidemics in Wuhan and Shanghai, it is not possible to separate the effects of
case-based strategies from population wide social distancing. In our simulation model, we estimated the
effect of social distancing alone; combining social distancing and case-based interventions would have a
synergistic effect to further reduce transmission. Further, our estimates of age differences in susceptibility
to infection and probability of developing symptoms are based on active testing of contacts of 57 primary
confirmed cases. These data suffer from the usual difficulties inherent to identifying epidemiological links
and index cases. Seroepidemiology studies are currently lacking but will be essential to fully resolve the
population susceptibility profile of COVID-19.
While the age patterns of contacts were not significantly different between the two study locations during
the COVID-19 outbreak period, these patterns may not be fully representative of other locations in China
and abroad, where social distancing measures may differ. Modeling results may possibly be
underestimating the effect of social distancing interventions as our results account for a decreased number
of contacts but ignore the impact of increased awareness of the population, which may have also affected
the type of social interactions (e.g., increased distance between individuals while in contact, or use of face
mask(16, 17)). Finally, our school closure simulations are not meant to formulate a full intervention
strategy, which would require identification of epidemic triggers to initiate closures and evaluation of

different durations of intervention (5). Nonetheless, our modeling exercise provides an indication of the
possible impact of a nation-wide preemptive strategy on the infection attack rate and peak incidence. To
generalize these findings to other contexts, location-specific age-mixing patterns and population
structures should be considered.
Our study provides evidence that the interventions put in place in Wuhan and Shanghai, and the resulting
changes in human behavior, drastically decreased daily contacts, essentially reducing them to household
interactions. Assuming the same scale of contact-distancing measures were to be put in place in other
locations, human mixing patterns could be captured by data on within-household contacts, which are
available for several countries around the world (4-6, 18-20). Further research should concentrate on
refining age-specific estimates of susceptibility to infection, disease, and infectivity, which are
instrumental to evaluating the impact of school- and work-based control strategies currently under
consideration worldwide (21, 22).

Figure 1. A Regular weekday contact matrix for Wuhan. An alternative visualization of this contact
matrix is shown in Appendix (Sec.11). B Outbreak contact matrix for Wuhan. C Difference between the
regular weekday contact matrix and the outbreak contact matrix in Wuhan. D-F Same as A-C, but for
Shanghai.
Figure 2. A Estimated R0 obtained with the outbreak contact matrix, as a function of baseline R0 derived
from the regular weekday contact matrix, where the transmission rate is held constant. The solid light
grey rectangle represents the region where the R0 in the outbreak situation is under the epidemic threshold.
The shaded dashed black rectangle represents a plausible range of R0 values in the early phase of the
COVID-19 epidemic, as estimated in the literature. B Infection attack rate a year after the initial case of
COVID-19 as a function of baseline R0, derived from the regular weekday contact matrix. The
corresponding value of R0 for the outbreak situation can be seen in panel A. The shaded colored areas
represent 95%CI. C As A, but for Shanghai only and including two scenarios of contact patterns reduction:
(i) during vacations (Vacation) and (ii) during regular weekdays, after removing all contacts occurring in
school setting (No schools). D Daily incidence of new infections for the four scenarios presented in panel
C (median and 95%CI). The inset shows the mean infection attack rate after a year.
