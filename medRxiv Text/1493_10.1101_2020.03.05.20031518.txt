Abstract
Background: Imagery techniques have been used as essential parts of diagnostic workup for
patients suspected for 2019-nCoV infection, Multiple studies have reported the features of
chest computed tomography (CT) scans among a number of 2019-nCoV patients.
Method: Study Identification was carried out in databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane
Library) to identify published studies examining the diagnosis, the 2019 novel coronavirus
(2019-nCoV). Heterogeneity among reported prevalence was assessed by computing p-values
of Cochrane Q-test and I2-statics. The pooled prevalence of treatment failure was carried out
with a fixed effects meta-analysis model, generating the pooled 95% confidence interval. A
random-effect model was used to pool the results since this model could incorporate the
heterogeneity of the studies and therefore proved a more generalized result.
Results: According to the combined results of meta-analysis, the total 55% of corona patients
were males. The mean age of the patients was 41.31 (34.14, 48.47). Two prevalent clinical
symptoms between patients were fever, cough with prevalence of 85%, and 62%, respectively.
Either Ground Glass Opacity GGO or consolidation was seen in 86% but 14% had NO GGO
or consolidation.
The other rare CT symptoms were pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion with 4, 5, 7%
prevalence, respectively. The most prevalent event was Either GGO or consolidation in 85%
of patients.
Conclusion: The most CT-scan abnormality is Either Ground Glass Opacity GGO or
consolidation however in few patients none of them might be observed, so trusting in just CT
findings will lead to miss some patients.

Introduction:
The first cases of unusual pneumonia in early December of 2019 reported in Wuhan, China (1).
Within 4 weeks, the pathogen identified as a novel betacorona virus named Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) or 2019-nCoV that mostly affects type II
alveolar cells of human lungs (2). The virus uses a glycosylated spike protein and binds to
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) Receptor that is similar to SARS-CoV virus (3).
The incubation period is 1-14 days and it seems that asymptomatic patients can transmit the
disease (4). The clinical manifestations include fever (83-98% of cases), dry cough (76-83%
of cases), fatigue and myalgia (11-44% of cases). Also, other symptoms like headache, sore
throat, abdominal pain and diarrhea has been reported in some cases. Laboratory tests showed
lymphopenia (70%), increased Prothrombin Time (58%) and increased LDH (40%). The RTPCR of the virus genome is still the standard diagnostic tool to confirm the disease (3).
Imagery techniques have been used as essential parts of diagnostic workup for patients
suspected for 2019-nCoV infection (5). Multiple studies have reported the features of chest
computed tomography (CT) scans among a number of 2019-nCoV patients (5-8). Findings
such as ground glass opacities or mixed ground glass opacities and consolidations are of
common reported features (9). However, the other related patterns and features of Chest CT
such as the pulmonary lobes involved, remain to be better documented for 2019-nCoV
infection.
Due to lack of approved treatment or vaccine, the attention has now been focused on the public
health strategies to prevent the transmission of the new corona virus 2019 in the community
(10). Therefore, in epidemic areas, it is crucial to early diagnose the patients highly suspected
for 2019-nCoV according to epidemiological history and clinical presentation. The use of

laboratory tests for 2019-nCoV may be time consuming or even limited by the lack of supply
test kits. There is report of 5 patients with initially negative RT-PCR tests and positive chest
CTs that eventually confirmed as 2019-nCoV infection via repeated swab tests (11).
Furthermore, it has been proposed that in comparison with initial RT-PCR, chest CT had higher
sensitivity to detect patients with 2019-nCoV. In this study the sensitivity of chest CT in
suggesting 2019-nCoV was 97% based on positive RT-PCR results. The authors concluded
that chest CT maybe considered as primary tool for detection of 2019-nCoV(12).
In this review, we systematically investigated the key features of chest CT findings of patients
with confirmed diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection. According to quick spread of 2019-nCoV
(13) these CT characteristics may prompt the physicians suggest the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV
as soon as indicated.
Method:
Study Identification and Selection:
A systematic search was carried out in databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to
identify published studies examining the diagnosis, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),
in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines. There were two independent reviewers 2019-nCoV, respectively. We
used “2019 Novel coronavirus”, “Wuhan virus”, "covid-19" and "CT-scan", "Computed
tomography" to identify the relevant studies. For the 2019-nCoV, we searched for all studies
published in all language between till 20 February 2020. We used English and Chinese studies.
Statistical analysis:
Data on study design, sample size, study population and publication year were extracted in
Microsoft Excel format, and then analysis was carried out using Stata software (version 13.1,
Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA). Heterogeneity among reported prevalence was

assessed by computing p-values of Cochrane Q-test and I2-statics (14). The pooled prevalence
of treatment failure was carried out with a fixed effects meta-analysis model, generating the
pooled 95% confidence interval. A random-effect model was used to pool the results since this
model could incorporate the heterogeneity of the studies and therefore proved a more
generalized result. With regard to the continuous variable presented in this meta-analysis, the
standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed using
the random effects model. The SMD and 95% CI represent the pooled results of this study.
Publication bias was assessed by Egger’s and Beggs’ tests at 5% significant level (15). Point
prevalence, as well as 95% confidence intervals, was presented in the forest plot format for
categorical variables (appendix). In this plot, the size of each box indicated the weight of the
study, while each crossed line refers to 95% confidence interval. The reported values were twotailed, and hypothesis testing results were considered statistically significant at p = 0.05.
Results:
Literature search and study identification:
The flowchart of database search was summarized in Fig. 1. Overall, 16 studies were identified
after the initial database search, and 7 were excluded based on titles and abstracts mainly
because they were irrelevant to the study purpose. The 9 remaining studies underwent full-text
review.
Meta-analysis for the different clinical and CT-scan symptoms in Corona patients:
Nine datasets with 293 patients from the different data bases were included in meta-analysis.
Significant heterogeneity was detected (p for Cochrane’s Q test <0.001). Meta-analysis with
random-effect model or fixed effect model if appropriates are showed in tabel.1.

The results based on clinical and CT-scan symptoms are presented in table.1. According to the
combined results of meta-analysis, the total 55% of corona patients were males. The mean age
of the patients was 41.31 (34.14, 48.47). Two prevalent clinical symptoms between patients
were fever, cough with prevalence of 85%, and 62%, respectively. The rare CT-scan symptoms
were lymphadenopathy (LAP), pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion with 4, 5, 7%
prevalence, respectively. Bilateral involvement of lung was observed in 82% of patients
(Figure.2).
Total, 7 studies presented consolidation in 40% of Corona subjects (Figure. 3), and 5 studies
CT-scan results showed GGO status in about 80% of patients (Figure.4). Either GGO or
consolidation (86%), and neither GGO, nor consolidation (14%) status reported only in a study
with 21 subjects. The GGO with consolidation, and GGO without consolidation reported in 4
studies with 83 sample size in which GGO without consolidation was more prevalent (72%)
than the other one.
Publication bias:
The funnel plots for the meta-analysis of the prevalence of different symptoms in Corona
patients were not shown. The plots were symmetrical on visual inspection, indicating low risk
of publication bias in most of status. The Egger’s regression tests also demonstrated in Table.1.
For studies with high risk of publication the adjusted trim and fill statistics were presents in
table.1
Grading the quality of evidence:
The quality of evidence and confidence for the main outcomes (primary outcomes) of including
studies in our review will be evaluated and assessed on the basis of the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guideline (16). The
quality of evidence will be adjudicated into 4 levels: “very low”, “low”, “moderate” or “high”

judgment. Any discrepancy will be resolved by consensus or consultation with a third review
author (RK). All studies had the high score in judgment.
According to rapid spread of new corona virus 2019 in the world (reported in 86 countries as
of March 5, 2020), it is crucial to stablish robust clinical data to help health care providers
control the outbreak (17). Early diagnosis of 2019-nCoV can lead to patient isolation strategies
which in turn leads to reduction of viral transition. The epidemiological history may be vague
and the sign and symptoms of the disease may resemble other viral infections. The RT-PCR
tests of serum or respiratory specimens may be unavailable for all suspected patients as well.
There is the possibility of initial false negative results of RT-PCR tests due to lack of replicable
nucleic acid or technical errors as well (18). In this context, chest CT images are important
elements of clinical workflow of 2019-nCoV, with respect to screening, diagnosis and followup. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to find the answer for this question
that whether there is any fix pattern of pulmonary involvement in chest CT scans of patients
with 2019-nCoV infection according to available evidence.
Our pooled data revealed that the most common patterns of CT scan in infected patients were
Ground Glass Opacity (GGO), interlobular septal thickening and consolidation (presented in
79%, 66% and 40% of cases respectively) especially in bilateral lower lobes of lung (reported
in 38% of patients). Right middle lobe, right upper lobe and left upper lobe are involved less
than lower lobes (26%, 15% and 3% respectively). The patterns of lesions are mostly bilateral
(82%) and peripheral (56%). Crazy paving pattern, LAP, pericardial and pleural effusion and
sub-pleural signs were the other CT scan findings accordingly (6, 19, 20). However there are
positive RT-PCR cases with normal pattern of chest CT scan suggesting not to exclude these
patients of 2019-nCoV (21).

Above findings are in consistent with recent studies in which the chest CT characteristics of
2019-nCoV pneumonia were identified. Bilateral peripheral ground-glass and consolidative
pulmonary opacities were found in CT scans of 21 patients from China. In this study, 15 cases
(71%) had the involvement of more than 2 lobes. Also pulmonary nodules, cavitation, pleural
effusions, and lymphadenopathy were absent in the cases (5). Another study among 6 patients
with confirmed diagnosis of 2019-nCoV in China revealed multifocal or unifocal involvement
of ground-glass opacity (GGO) with consolidation and fibrosis as basic pattern. In this study
pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were absent as well. Also the lesions generally
progressed in follow-up CT scans obtained between 2 to 6 days after initial images (22).
It is worthwhile to consider the dynamic nature of chest CT findings of 2019-nCoV, i.e., the
alteration of finings that may be observed in repeated measures. In a study among 21 nonrespiratory compromised patients with 2019-nCoV, multiple CT images were performed in the
process of recovery. The authors classified 4 radiologic stages. In stage 1 (0-4 days after onset
of disease), GGO in the lower lobes was the main finding. In stage 2 (5-8 days after the onset)
the infection extended and diffuse GGO, crazy-paving pattern and consolidation were
observed. In stage 3 (9-13 days after the onset, peak stage), the consolidation was the dominant
abnormality and finally in sage 4 (≥14 days after the onset, absorption stage), consolidation
was absorbed. There was no crazy-paving pattern but still a remarkable GGO abnormality in
this stage. Furthermore, in this study, GGO and peripheral distribution were dominant (more
than 50% of patients) in all 4 stages. Also, bilateral multilobe involvement was dominant in
stages 2, 3 and 4. Similar to some case reports (23, 24), it can be concluded that chest CT
findings of individuals with 2019-nCoV infection may be diverse and rapidly change during
the disease course. Future research may focus on the main characteristics of the 2019-nCoV
pulmonary lesions in different clinical stages and the correlation of these findings with the
prognosis or outcome in the affected individuals.

In our study we observed neither consolidation nor GGO in 14% of patients, So, trusting only
on CT scan findings leads to miss a few patients with confirmed laboratory finding of 2019nCoV.
2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV and MERS are subtypes of a common family. The comparison of
radiologic features of pulmonary involvement of these viral pathogens with other viruses, may
help radiologists make more accurate diagnoses based on CT images. Generally, the chest CT
scan findings of the 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV and MERS are similar (25, 26), however 2019nCoV may present with specific characteristics. CT scan in patients with influenza lower
respiratory tract infection (LRTI) shows diffused GGO and localized bronchial wall thickening
in upper and mid lobes in comparison with 2019-nCoV that mostly affects lower lobes (21, 27,
28). GGO and bronchial wall thickening in mid and upper lobes and centrilobular opacities are
radiologic manifestations of RSV LRTI and bronchiolitis but the consolidation and GGO can
be present in severe cases(29-31). SARS-CoV infection is another LRTI that appears with
progressive pneumonia shows GGO in early phase of the disease and gradually turns into
reticular opacities within 4 weeks. The pattern remains in CT scan for months especially in
patients with prolonged dyspnea. The CT scan patterns of viral LRTI are not characteristic but
the epidemic parameters in addition to signs and symptoms can lead us to the diagnosis (3234).
In summary, bilateral peripheral pattern of GGO, interlobular septal thickening and
consolidation mostly in bilateral lower lobes of lung in chest CT scans of suspected individuals
in combination with epidemiological data, presence of fever and cough and laboratory positive
results, are highly in favor of the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV in an individual, but this pattern does
not observed in all cases as we showed 14% with laboratory finding may not have either
consolidation or GGO which may be missed during screening with CT scan.
