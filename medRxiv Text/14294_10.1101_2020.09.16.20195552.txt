Abstract
Objective: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), broke out in December 2019, and is now
a global pandemic. In the past few months, a large number of clinical studies have been initiated
worldwide to find effective therapeutics, vaccines, and preventive strategies for COVID-19. In
this study, we aim to understand the landscape of COVID-19 clinical research and identify the
gaps such as the lack of population representativeness and issues that may cause recruitment
difficulty.
Materials and Methods: We analyzed 3,765 COVID-19 studies registered in the largest public
registry - ClinicalTrials.gov, leveraging natural language processing and using descriptive,
association, and clustering analyses. We first characterized COVID-19 studies by study features
such as phase and tested intervention. We then took a deep dive and analyzed their eligibility
criteria to understand whether these studies: (1) considered the reported underlying health
conditions that may lead to severe illnesses, and (2) excluded older adults, either explicitly or
implicitly, which may reduce the generalizability of these studies to the older adults population.
Results: Most trials did not have an upper age limit and did not exclude patients with common
chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes that are more prevalent in older adults.
However, known risk factors that may lead to severe illnesses have not been adequately
considered.
Conclusions: A careful examination of existing COVID-19 studies can inform future COVID-19
trial design towards balanced internal validity and generalizability.
Keywords: COVID-19, clinical trial, eligibility criteria, natural language processing

Introduction

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) broke out in December 2019 and has quickly become a global
pandemic with serious health and social consequences [1]. As of October 27, 2020, more than
70 million confirmed cases have been reported around the world and about one-fifth are from the
U.S. [2]. Globally, more than 1,592,000 people have died due to COVID-19 and 295,000 in the
U.S. alone. In April 2020, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the Accelerating
COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) public-private partnership to
prioritize and speed up the clinical evaluation of the most promising treatments and vaccines [3].
In July 2020, NIH released its strategic plan for COVID-19 research to speed up the
development of treatments, vaccines, and diagnostics [4]. Traditionally, it may take years to
discover, develop, and evaluate a therapeutic agent; nevertheless, for COVID-19, the goal has
been to compress the timeline to months while continuing to apply rigorous standards to ensure
safety and efficacy. Strategies such as applying complex computer-generated models of SARSCov-2 and its biological processes to determine key interactions and pathways have been applied
to develop therapeutic agents and vaccines (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) to neutralize the virus.
A significant efforts have also been made to screen existing drugs approved for other indications
to treat COVID-19 [4]. Recently, the COVID-19 vaccine developed and manufactured by PfizerBioNTech has been approved to be administered in a few countries including the United
Kingdom [5], Canada [6], and the US [7].
Clinical studies, especially randomized controlled trials (RCT), are the gold standard for
evaluating the efficacy and safety of a treatment. Regardless of the techniques (e.g., in vivo, in
silico, or in vitro) used for drug discovery, the therapeutics and vaccines have to go through three

phases of clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy and safety before approvals (e.g., by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) can be granted for mass production and use in the general
population. In the past few months, many COVID-19 clinical studies have been launched around
the world, leading to situations where studies have to compete for participants from the same
pool of eligible participants. Trials such as those for the promising drug – Remdesivir – were
suspended due to the lack of trial participants in China [8]. Other issues such as population
representation are also critical. In the past, older adults are often excluded from clinical trials
with overly restrictive exclusion criteria, which lead to concerns on the generalizability of those
clinical studies across many disease domains [9]. A recent New York Times article conjectured
that older adults are left out form COVID-19 trials [10]. It is therefore important to understand
the landscape of COVID-19 clinical research and further identify the gaps and issues that may
cause delays in patient recruitment and the lack of real-world population representativeness,
especially for older adults.
To date, 12 other studies have analyzed registered COVID-19 clinical studies [11-22] (see
Supplementary Material I for details).

For example, Wang et al. analyzed the basic

characteristics and the drug interventions of 306 COVID-19 trials from ClinicalTrials.gov
as of April 3, 2020 [11].

Paudi et al. analyzed 1,551 COVID-19 studies registered

between March 1, 2020 and May 19, 2020 in ClinicalTrials.gov and focused on basic
characteristics, primary and secondary outcomes, and study design [12]. Kim et al.
evaluated the impact of frequently used quantitative eligibility criteria in 288 COVID-19
studies (as of June 18, 2020) on the recruitment and clinical outcomes using the EHR data
of COVID-19 patients in Columbia University Irving Medical Center [22]. While most of
these studies analyzed the basic characteristics of the included trials, some studies further

analyzed the interventions [18-21], locations [13,14,18], data monitoring characteristics
[14], timing of the registration and enrollment [15,21], outcomes [19,20], risk of biases
[16], Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) keywords (Words or phrases that best describe the
protocol) [19], sample size [17], and a subset of eligibility criteria [16,22]. Nonetheless,
existing studies have not comprehensively investigated the qualitative eligibility criteria
and the consideration of known risk factors of severe illnesses in COVID-19 clinical
studies. To do so, advanced approaches such as natural language processing (NLP) are
necessary. As such, we can gain a better understanding of the landscape of COVID-19 research
and answer a number of important research questions: (1) What eligibility criteria are used in
COVID-19 clinical studies? Are these criteria too restrictive? (2) Further, as more COVID-19
cases have been identified and treated in the past 8 months, we have accumulated important
knowledge on the underlying health conditions and other risk factors that may cause severe
illness among COVID-19 patients (e.g., hypertension and diabetes) [23]. Have existing clinical
studies sufficiently considered these known risk factors? (3) Last but not the least, because of the
concerns on study generalizability in older adults, it is of interest to assess whether the COVID19 clinical studies excluded subjects with common chronic conditions that are prevalent in older
adults, potentially leading to their underrepresentation.
In this study, we conducted a systematic analysis of the registered clinical studies on
COVID-19 (as of November 27, 2020) from ClinicalTrials.gov to answer the aforementioned
research questions. The contribution of this paper is multi-fold: (1) it systematically summarizes
various important aspects of the COVID-19 clinical studies; (2) it identifies the research gaps on
the risk factors related to serious illness caused by COVID-19; (3) it groups COVID-19 studies
based on their eligibility criteria, and (4) it identifies salient exclusion criteria that may implicitly

exclude older adults, who are most vulnerable and should be studied when evaluating the efficacy
and safety of COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. Our findings could inform future trials
designed for COVID-19 treatment and prevention and identify strategies to rapidly but
appropriately stand up a large number of clinical studies for future pandemics similar to COVID19.

Materials and Methods
Data Source
ClinicalTrials.gov, built and maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, is the largest
clinical study registry in the world [24]. In the U.S., all drugs and devices regulated by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are required to be registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov.
ClinicalTrials.gov is thus considered as the most comprehensive trial registry in the world and
has been widely used for secondary analysis [25].

Dataset Acquisition and Processing
From ClinicalTrials.gov, we downloaded records of 4,028 clinical studies that are tagged with a
condition of “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2” on November 27, 2020. We excluded studies
tagged with the study type “Expanded Access” and studies that were tagged as patient registries,
leaving 3,765 records that met our inclusion criteria. We extracted the NCTID (an unique
identifier of a study record), conditions, agency, agency class, brief summary, detailed summary,
status, start date, eligibility criteria, enrollment, study phase, study type, intervention type,
intervention name, study design (i.e., allocation, masking, observation model, time perspective),
primary purpose, and endpoint classification. We split the eligibility criteria into inclusion

criteria and exclusion criteria and further extracted individual criteria for natural language
processing. To identify the top frequently tested drugs, we extracted the drugs information from
the “intervention” field from the study record. We used QuickUMLS to normalize the drug
names and removed the dosage information before analyzing their frequencies.

Consideration of Risk Factors in COVID-19 Clinical Studies
We first identified known risk factors of COVID-19 from online resources such as the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [26] and Mayo Clinic [27] (as of July 17, 2020).
Then, we coded the risk factors with the concepts from Unified Medical Language System
(UMLS). To do so, we used the risk factor terms as the input and identified their corresponding
Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) using QuickUMLS [28] with the default setting (Jaccard
similarity threshold > 0.8, all semantic types included). As a concept of the UMLS is associated
with its synonyms from UMLS source ontologies, we were able to unify all the terms mentioned
in the text. Table 1 lists the risk factors that may lead to severe COVID-19 and their associated
UMLS CUIs. This list was used as a dictionary in QuickUMLS [28] to identify risk factors from
the study description. As reported in Soldaini et al. [28], QuickUMLS achieved better
performance than MetaMap and cTAKES on a number of benchmark corpora. Nevertheless, we
manually reviewed the risk factors extracted by QuickUMLS on a random sample of 100
clinical studies; and QuickUMLS achieved a precision of 91% 1 . We also identified the
studies that used these risk factors in the inclusion/exclusion criteria using the parsing results of
the eligibility criteria parsing tool [29] described below. T-test and analysis of variance
(ANOVA) were employed to assess the association between the number of risk factors in the trial

We did not evaluate the recall due to lack of a benchmark dataset for trial description with all the risk factors
annotated manually.

Analysis of Eligibility Criteria
Quantitative criteria: We used the open-source Valx tool [30] to extract and standardize the
quantitative eligibility criteria from the COVID-19 studies. Valx is a system that can extract
numeric expressions from free-text eligibility criteria and standardize them into a structured
format. For example, from the inclusion criterion “BMI > 25 kg/m 2”, the variable name “BMI”,
the comparison operator “>”, the threshold value “25”, and the measurement unit “kg/m2”
were extracted into 4 discrete fields. Valx is also able to recognize synonyms of a variable
and convert the units to standard ones. We then analyzed the frequency of the quantitative
criteria and the threshold values used for patient eligibility determination.

Qualitative eligibility features: To extract the qualitative eligibility features from COVID-19
studies, we used a new eligibility criteria parsing tool [29], which consists of a context-free
grammar (CFG) and an information extraction (IE) modules to transform free-text eligibility
criteria to structured formats for downstream analysis. The CFG module uses a lexer to divide
criteria into tokens and a modified Cocke-Younger-Kasami algorithm to build parse trees from
tokens, which are subsequently analyzed by removing duplicates and subtrees. The IE module
uses an attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory with a conditional random field
layer for named entity recognition to extract MeSH terms from criteria text. Based on the
evaluation in [29], its performance is competitive in entity recognition, entity linking, and
attribute linking. As it only extracted MeSH concepts from eligibility criteria but not their
temporal constraints and other qualifiers, we called them “eligibility features” in this paper. To
evaluate its concept extraction accuracy, we manually reviewed a random sample of 300 rows of

extracted results along with their original criteria. In the extracted results, there are cases where a
term was identified but was not matched to a MeSH concept. In such cases, we considered them
to be false negatives. The precision is 98.9%. The recall is 81.1%. The false negative ones were
mostly quantitative criteria (29.3%) or due to missing concepts in MeSH (48.3%). We manually
corrected the parsing errors of the frequent concepts. For example, we corrected the parsing
results of the criterion “men”, which was parsed as “multiple endocrine neoplasia”. It is fine to
miss some quantitative criteria as they were extracted by Valx [30] with a high sensitivity and
specificity. We also merged similar concepts in the parsing results based on the analysis needs.
Detailed information about the merging of extracted concepts can be found in the Supplementary
Material II. To evaluate the accuracy of extracting known risk factors from eligibility criteria
using the tool [29], we reviewed a random sample of 300 rows of extracted risk factors, the
precision is 100%. Regarding the recall, we took a random sample of 200 unique criteria. 72 of
them contain a risk factor and the program extracted 61 of them, making the recall to be 84.72%.
After the qualitative eligibility features of COVID-19 studies were parsed, we conducted three
types of analyses: (1) frequency of the qualitative eligibility features; (2) clustering analysis of
the clinical studies based on the parsed eligibility features; and (3) frequency of exclusion
eligibility features on chronic conditions and risk factors. Since (1) is intuitive, we explain the
process of (2) and (3) in details as follows.

Clustering analysis of clinical studies: We used the clustering analysis to group the clinical
studies based on their eligibility features. After the inclusion and exclusion criteria are parsed by
the aforementioned tool [29], we utilized the parsed concepts as features to construct clinical
study representation. For inclusion and exclusion eligibility features, we first removed the

duplicated concepts for each clinical study. For example, if “pregnancy women" is mentioned
multiple times in the exclusion criteria, only one was kept. Then, we append the prefixes ‘inc’ or
‘exc’ to the concepts extracted from inclusion or exclusion criteria respectively to differentiate
them. After data preprocessing, we constructed the data representations by treating each clinical
study as a text document that contains concepts from inclusion and exclusion eligibility features.
The Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting scheme was employed
to construct the feature vectors to feed to the K-means clustering algorithm [31]. K-means is
rather easy to implement and apply on large and high dimensional data sets. The algorithm
assigns the instance to one of the clusters. The objective is to minimize the sum of the distances
of the instances within the cluster to the cluster centroid. The silhouette value and CHindex were
jointly used to measure the clustering results of K-means to determine the optimal number of
clusters. The silhouette values measures similarity of an instance to its own cluster compared to
other clusters. In this research, we experimented with k values from 2 to 50 for k-means. The
optimal k was chosen when the silhouette value average of all instances is high and there are at
least 20 instances for each cluster. To visualize the clustering result, we employed the uniform
manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) [32] to project the high dimensional data into
two-dimensional space for visualization. The UMAP reduces the dimensions by estimating the
topology of the high dimensional data. It considers the local relationships within groups and
global relationships between groups. UMAP can be applied directly to sparse matrices. In
addition, we also clustered the interventional studies considering both the extracted eligibility
features and the enrollment values. The reason we included only interventional studies in this
analysis is that observational studies often have a huge enrollment value, thereby dominating the
clustering results. In addition, the eligibility criteria of observational studies are usually broad

and unrestrictive. We used Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of
eligibility features (weighted by TF-IDF) to 10 and then added two more features: the enrollment
value (normalized to 0-1) and the intervention type, due to their importance deemed by the study
team. We used UMAP to visualize the clustering result following the same process as the one
using only eligibility features.

Exclusion eligibility features on chronic conditions and risk factors: First, we examined the
upper limit and lower limit of the age criterion, which are structured data in the study summaries.
Then, from the results of the criteria parsing tool [29], we examined the use of exclusion
eligibility features about 15 most prevalent chronic conditions among older adults in the National
Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) (appearing in over 6%
of the older adults in NIS) [33].

These conditions include hypertension, hyperlipidemia,

ischemic heart disease, diabetes, anemia, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis, rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis,
acquired hypothyroidism, Alzheimer disease and related disorders or senile dementia,
depression, osteoporosis, and asthma. In addition, we also considered three chronic conditions
that are prevalent in all adults: cancer, stroke, and high cholesterol. We then analyzed the use of
risk factors that may lead to serious illnesses in the eligibility criteria.

Qualitative Eligibility Features
Figure 4 illustrates frequent concepts extracted from inclusion and exclusion criteria of COVID19 clinical studies. According to these results, COVID-19 diagnosis, polymerase chain reaction,
pneumonia, diabetes, therapeutics, mechanical ventilation were often used eligibility features in
the inclusion criteria, whereas pregnancy, therapeutics, kidney diseases, cancer, HIV, mechanical
ventilation, hydroxychloroquine, hepatitis C were often used eligibility features in the exclusion
criteria.

Figure 5 shows the number of studies that used an exclusion eligibility feature about a common
chronic condition prevalent among older adults in the included studies. Even though a majority
of studies did not exclude patients with these chronic conditions, some highly prevalent chronic
conditions such as cancer, heart failure, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease, COPD, and
diabetes are among the most frequently used exclusion criteria in 2.76% - 8.42% studies. Few
studies purposely included patients with a risk factor that may lead to serious illnesses, but few
studies explicitly excluded them except for pregnant women. According to the results of the
statistical tests, on average, interventional studies used more risk factors in eligibility criteria
than observational studies (mean: 1.19 vs. 0.22, p<0.001, two-tailed t-test). There is a statistically
significant association between the number of risk factors used in eligibility criteria and the
intervention type (p < 0.001, ANOVA), and primary purpose of the studies (P< 0.001, ANOVA).

Table 4 shows the top 10 frequent inclusion and exclusion features used in the studies in
each of the 7 clusters resulting from the clustering analysis with eligibility features only.
Pregnancy is the most frequent exclusion criterion in all the 7 clusters. Studies in Cluster #0
often included patients with pneumonia and excluded patients with cognition/cognitive
behavioral therapy/cognitive dysfunction. Studies in Cluster #1 often excluded patients who are
on therapeutics, kidney diseases, and cancer. Studies in Cluster #2 often included patients with
polymerase chain reaction. Studies in Cluster #5 often excluded HIV/HIV Infections, Hepatitis B,
Hepatitis C, and Cancer. Figure 6 shows the visualization of these 7 clusters using UMAP. The

Discussion
As the novel coronavirus COVID-19 has significantly impacted our lives and even taken lives of
hundreds of thousands of people in the past 8 months, we must quickly identify repurposed drugs
gs
or develop new drugs and vaccines to safely and effectively control the spread of the virus and
nd
save lives. Clinical studies, especially randomized controlled trials, are a fundamental tool used
ed
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new medical interventions for disease prevention or
treatment. Many clinical studies are being conducted to find safe and effective treatments and
nd
vaccines. Thus far, significant efforts have been devoted to repurposing existing FDA-approved
ed
drugs including immunosuppression (e.g., Hydroxychloroquine, Tocilizumab), anti-virus (e.g.,
g.,
Fevipiravir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir), anti-parasite (e.g., Ivermectin, Nitazoxanide), antibiotics (e.g.,
g.,

Azithromycin), and anticoagulant (e.g., Enoxaparin). In our analysis of the COVID-19 clinical
studies, we found that the use of eligibility criteria and consideration of risk factors in these
studies did not change much from June 18, 2020 to November 27, 2020 even though the number
of COVID-19 studies in ClinicalTrials.gov grew from 2,192 to 4,028.
To transform clinical trials and lower their cost, a notion of “digital clinical trial” was
created to leverage digital technology to improve important aspects such as patient access,
engagement, and trial measurement [34]. The US National Institutes of Health and the National
Science Foundation held a workshop in April 2019 about the implementation of digital
technologies in clinical trials, in which “defining and outlining the composition and elements of
digital trials” and “elucidating digital analytics and data science approaches” were identified as
two of the five top priorities. As COVID-19 is a major health crisis that impacts people
regardless of their age, gender, and race/ethnicity, it is in our interest to understand if clinical
studies on COVID-19 adequately considered the representation of real-world populations. Based
on our analysis, most clinical studies consider both genders (97.4%, N=3,667), do not have an
upper age limit 67.3% (N= 2,534), and have a lower age limit of 18 (75.9%, N=2,856). The
exclusion of children in these studies may be due to lower susceptibility and lower rates of
mortality and hospitalization for children with COVID-19 compared to adults [35]. As serious
illnesses of COVID-19 mostly occurred in older adults with underlying health conditions, it is
not surprising that they are in general considered by most COVID-19 studies, based on our
analysis of their eligibility criteria. Most studies did not set an upper age limit (67.3%, N= 2534)
and did not exclude older adults with common chronic conditions. This is contrary to the recent
New York Times articles conjecturing that older people are left out form COVID-19 trials [10].
As older adults are the most likely to be hospitalized due to COVID-19, clinicians may be more

likely to choose to include them to fulfill the sample size requirement of the trials. Nonetheless,
conducting COVID-19 clinical studies could still be challenging in the traditional clinical trial
eco-system, where patient accrual is often delayed due to logistical constraints [36]. The
generalizability of the study results to the real-world population should be evaluated with stateof-the-art techniques [9]. Older adults could have still been underrepresented in COVID-19
clinical studies due to logistical reasons, which can only be assessed with the published results
after the completion of the studies [37]. In addition, pregnant women are often excluded in
COVID-19 studies. Even though pregnant women are in general excluded in most clinical trials
due to the potential risks to both the women and the unborn babies, observational studies should
carefully evaluate the vertical transmission of the virus and negative impact of COVID-19 on the
well-being of mothers and infants [38]. Clinical studies should adequately evaluate the efficacy
and safety of treatments and vaccines on vulnerable population groups.

Limitations
A few limitations should be noted. First, some data in ClinicalTrials.gov are missing. For
example, 33.8% (N=775) of the interventional studies miss study phase information. 39%
(N=1,470) of studies do not have primary purpose information. Second, we relied on the search
function of ClinicalTrials.gov when retrieving COVID-19 studies. There may be study indexing
errors, but the scale should be minimal and would not impact the findings. Third, we used the
QuickUMLS and the new eligibility criteria parsing tool [29] to extract risk factors, chronic
conditions, disorders, and procedures from study records. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of
the term extraction and normalization are dependent on the quality of the UMLS Metathesaurus
and the eligibility criteria parsing tool. Nonetheless, we have carefully curated the term
extraction results to ensure that our results are as accurate as possible.

Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper, we systematically analyzed COVID-19 clinical study summaries in
ClinicalTrials.gov using natural language processing. Specifically, we analyzed whether these
clinical studies considered the underlying health conditions (and other risk factors) that may
increase the severity of the COVID-19 illness. Given the ongoing nature of this pandemic, it is
inevitable that early trials will start with different knowledge of risk factors than later trials. In
future work, we will perform a longitudinal analysis of COVID-19 studies to assess the changes
in the use of eligibility criteria and consideration of risk factors for severe illness in COVID-19
patients. As results of COVID-19 studies become available, we will be able to assess the extent
to which the trial design and eligibility criteria in particular would impact the findings as well as
the real-world population representativeness of these studies using generalizability assessment
methods [9].
