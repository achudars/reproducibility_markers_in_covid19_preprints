Metabolic disturbances and inflammatory dysfunction predict severity of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19): a retrospective study
Abstract
Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading worldwide with
16,558 deaths till date. Serum albumin, high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), and C-reactive
protein have been known to be associated with the severity and mortality of
community-acquired pneumonia. However, the characteristics and role of metabolic and
inflammatory indicators in COVID-19 is unclear.
Methods: We included 97 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.
Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory indices; radiological features; and treatment were
analysed. The differences in the clinical and laboratory parameters between mild and severe
COVID-19 patients and the role of these indicators in severity prediction of COVID-19 were
investigated.
Results: All were Wuhan residents with contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases. The
median age was 39 years (IQR: 30–59). The most common presenting symptoms were fever
(58.8%), cough (55.7%), and fatigue (33%). Other features were lymphopenia, impaired
fasting glucose, hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminemia, low high-density lipoproteinemia.
Decrease in lymphocyte count, serum total protein, serum albumin, high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C), ApoA1, CD3+T%, and CD8+T% were found to be valuable in
predicting the transition of COVID-19 from mild to severe illness. Chest computed
tomography (CT) images showed that the absorption of bilateral lung lesions synchronized
with the recovery of metabolic and inflammatory indicators.
Conclusions: Hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminemia, low high-density lipoproteinemia, and
decreased ApoA1, CD3+T%, and CD8+T% could predict severity of COVID-19. Lymphocyte
count, total serum protein, and HDL-C may be potentially useful for the evaluation of
COVID-19.
Keywords: Coronavirus disease 2019; infectious disease; metabolism; inflammation;

Introduction
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia was reported in
Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and rapidly spread throughout the world[1 2]. As of 24
March, 2020, there were 38,3407 laboratory-confirmed cases worldwide, resulting in 16,558
deaths. The disease spectrum analysis of 44,415 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by the
Chinese Centre for Disease Control found that the mild type accounted for 81%, severe type
for 14%, critical type for 5%, and the overall case-fatality rate (CFR) was 2.3%, but the
fatality rate in critically ill patients was as high as 49% [3]. In 2003, SARS caused 774 deaths
in 29 countries, and the CFR was about 10%. The number of deaths caused by COVID-19
was much higher than that by SARS. Although the total mortality rate of COVID-19 was
lower than that of SARS, the mortality rate of critically ill patients with COVID-19 was
much higher [4]. During the process of clinical diagnosis and treatment of patients with
COVID-19, we found that some patients with mild disease quickly deteriorated or even died.
Since the patients with mild disease account for the majority of COVID-19 patients, and the
mortality rate is high in critically ill patients (49%), there is an urgent need to identify factors
that can predict the transition of mild COVID-19 patients to critical patients.
The seventh edition of the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plan issued by the National
Health Commission of China indicates that in adult patients with COVID-19, the progressive
decrease in peripheral blood lymphocytes and the progressive increase in inflammatory
factors IL-6 and C-reactive protein are early warning indicators for the progression of mild
patients to severe and critical types. Our early reports demonstrate that cellular immunity, as
indicated by the number of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+T cells may be related to the severity of

the disease in COVID-19[5]. However, cellular immunity and inflammatory factors are not
routinely tested, and not all medical institutions can detect them. Therefore, in addition to the
above indicators, there is an urgent need for a more simple and accessible technique to
predict the potential of developing severe type of COVID-19 in patients with mild disease.
We found that there were abnormalities in the levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum
total protein, albumin, and blood lipid metabolism of patients with COVID-19. In this study,
we compared the levels of fasting blood glucose, serum total protein, albumin, blood lipid,
cytokines, cellular and humoral immunity indices in patients with different severity types of
COVID-19 and their clinical course. Furthermore, we studied the correlation between these
indices and evaluated the role of biochemical metabolism and immune inflammation in
predicting the development of severe COVID-19.
Materials and Methods
Study participants and design
This study was approved by the institutional ethics board of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan
University. Requirement for written informed consent was waived by the ethics board of
Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (WDRY2020-K100). The patients with confirmed
COVID-19 were admitted to Renmin Hospital from 9 February to 28 February, 2020. All
patients with COVID-19 enrolled in this research study were laboratory-confirmed cases with
positive results for fluorescence reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
detection of SARS-CoV-2. The final date of follow up was 10 March, 2020. According to the
guidelines for diagnosis and treatment plan for COVID-19 issued by the National Health
Commission of China[6], patients with COVID-19 were divided into three main types

according to the clinical manifestations: (1) Mild: with fever, respiratory or digestive
symptoms, and physician-diagnosed pneumonia by chest computed tomography (CT). (2)
Severe: Having one of the following features: shortness of breath and respiratory rate (RR) ≥
30 times/min; oxygen saturation ≤ 93% at rest; chest CT imaging showing that the lesion
had progressed more than 50% within 24–48 hours. (3) Critical: Meeting any of the following
criteria: respiratory failure needing mechanical ventilation; shock; and additional organ
failure needing critical care and treatment. In response to the requirements of the Hubei
provincial government with regard to treatment of COVID-19 patients according to grades,
Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University only received mild and severe patients. Therefore, the
patients included in this study were patients with mild and severe COVID-19. According to
the course of the disease (from the onset of COVID-19-related symptoms to the testing time),
we divided the mild patients into two groups: the course of disease in group one was 14 days
(mild 1 group), and in the other group was 30 days (mild 2 group). The average course of
disease in severe patients (severe group) was 12 days.
Laboratory Confirmation and Detection
Nasopharyngeal and anal swab samples were collected and fluorescence RT-PCR was used to
detect open reading frame 1ab (open reading frame1ab, ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein
(nucleocapsid protein, N) of 2019-nCoV. RT-PCR procedure was performed according to the
protocol issued by the World health Organisation (WHO). The novel coronavirus
(2019-nCoV) ORF1ab/N gene double nucleic acid detection kit (fluorescent PCR method)
was purchased from the Shanghai Jienuo Company. The detection equipment QuantstudioDx
and 7500 fluorescent PCR instrument were purchased from ThermoFisher Company of the

United States. The 2019-nCov-positive case confirmation needs to meet the requirement that
both the target genes are positive simultaneously, or that the ORF1ab is positive in two
different samples from the same patient.
To investigate the effect of 2019-nCoV on the production of cytokines and immunity in
different types and stages of the illness, plasma cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10,
tumor necrosis factor, and interferon-γ), cellular immunity indicators (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+,
CD19+, CD16+56), and humoral immunity indicators (Immunoglobulin G [IgG],
Immunoglobulin M [IgM], Immunoglobulin A [IgA], Immunoglobulin E [IgE], Complement
C3, Complement C4) were measured according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Data Collection
We obtained the medical records of patients with COVID-19, as reported to the National
Health Commission of China. Data on blood routine and fasting blood glucose, liver function,
renal function, total protein and albumin, full set of lipids, CRP, creatine kinase, lactate
dehydrogenase, cytokines, humoral immunity, and cellular immunity indicators were
extracted. The data were analysed by the research team of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan
University. Exposure history, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests data, radiological features,
and treatment data were obtained from the medical records from 9 February to February 28,
2020.
Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages, and continuous
variables were described using median and interquartile range (IQR) values. For numerical
variables, we first performed the Gaussian distribution test. Means for continuous variables

were compared using independent sample t tests when data were normally distributed;
otherwise, nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test was used. For categorical variables, the
comparison between groups was made by χ2 test, and the Fisher exact test was used when the
data were limited. Hotmap of correlation analysis was performed by Graphpad Prism 8. To
evaluate the value of metabolic and inflammatory indices in predicting the severity of
COVID-19, a receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC
curve (AUROC) were performed. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 26
software. P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Patients with COVID-19
This study included 97 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. The median age of
the patients was 39 years (interquartile 30–60; range 23–82) and 63 (64.9%) patients were
women. All the patients were residents of Wuhan without contact with wildlife, but all had
contact with patients with COVID-19. Compared with patients in the mild group (n = 72), the
patients in the severe group (n = 25) were significantly older (median age, 58 years [IQR,
47–67] vs. 37 years [IQR, 29–55]; p <0.001) and were more likely to have clinical
comorbidities, including hypertension (10 [40%] vs. 5 [6.9%]), diabetes (2 [8%] vs. 3 [4.2%]),
cardiovascular disease (2 [8%] vs. 0 [0%]), and cerebrovascular disease ( 2 [8%] vs. 1 [1.4%])
(Table 1).
Of the 97 patients in this study, asymptomatic cases accounted for 7.2% of the patients.
Analysis of the clinical characteristics of 72,314 COVID-19 patients by the Chinese Centre
for Disease Control revealed that asymptomatic cases accounted for 1%[3]. The most

common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (58.8% on admission), cough (55.7%), and
fatigue (33%). The second most common symptoms were sputum production (15.5%),
vomiting and diarrhoea (12.4%), nasal congestion (10.3%), and neurological symptoms such
as dizziness and headache (7.2%) (Table 1).
Laboratory Parameters in Patients with COVID-19
According to the course of disease, the patients with mild type COVID-19 were divided into
two groups: the average course of disease was 14 days in the mild 1 group and 30 days in
mild 2 group. Lymphopenia was a feature of patients with severe COVID-19, and a lower
lymphocyte count was found in the severe group compared with the mild 1 group
(0.99[0.78–1.43] vs. 1.9[1.4–2.3]). The levels of apolipoproteins A1(ApoA1) (1.52[1.40–1.60]
vs. 1.37[1.23–1.59]) and ApoB (0.88[0.71–1.05] vs. 0.76[0.66–0.87]) were significantly
increased in mild 2 group compared with mild 1 group. There was no statistical difference
observed in the hepatic and renal function between the two groups of patients with mild
COVID-19. The pattern of impaired fasting blood glucose (FBG) in mild COVID-19 patients
was fasting hypoglycaemia, while that in severe patients was predominantly fasting
hyperglycaemia. Fasting hypoglycaemia was found in 21.4% of patients in mild 1 group with
no case of fasting hyperglycaemia. In the mild 2 group, 34.1% of the patients had fasting
hypoglycaemia, and 2.3% had fasting hyperglycaemia. Compared with mild COVID-19
patients, we found that 24% of severe COVID-19 patients had fasting hyperglycaemia and 4%
had fasting hypoglycaemia. Patients in the severe group had a lower level of serum total
protein (59[58–63] vs. 65[63–70]), serum albumin (36[34–39] vs. 41[37–43]), total
cholesterol (3.6[3.3–4.0] vs. 3.8[3.5–4.4]), and HDL-C (0.88[0.81–1.10] vs. 1.05[0.93–1.50])

compared with the mild 1 group (Table 2).
The levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase (230[197–268)] vs. 175[155–199]), IL-2
(4.2[4.0–4.4] vs. 3.8[3.6–4.3]), IL-6 (9.93[8.58–11.92] vs. 5.78[5.10–7.19], and IL-10
(6.54[5.96–7.44] vs. 4.93[4.25–5.55]) in severe patients were significantly higher than those
in mild patients with COVID-19, suggesting an overactive inflammatory response in severe
illness. Furthermore, compared to the mild group, the proportion of CD3+T cells
(60%[50%–71%]

vs.

72%[69%–77%])

and

CD8+T

cells

(20%[16%–25%]

vs.

26%[24%–30%]) was significantly decreased, while the proportion of CD16+56T cells was
increased (18[12–31] vs. 12[8–19]), in the severe group indicating impaired cellular
immunity. The level of complement C4 in patients with severe COVID-19 was higher than
that in the mild group (0.24[0.19–0.35] vs. 0.16[0.13–0.23]) (Table 2).
Relationship between the metabolic and inflammatory indices in patients with
COVID-19
In order to investigate the correlation between metabolic abnormalities and severity of disease
in COVID-19, partial correlation analysis was performed on the basis of controlling the
variables of CRP, inflammatory factors (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-6/IL-10), and cellular immunity
indicators (CD3+, CD8+, CD16+56), C3 and C4 (Figure 1). It was found that the severity of
COVID-19 positively correlated with FBG (r = 0.334, p = 0.023). Serum total protein (r =
-0.422, p = 0.004), serum albumin (r = -0.351, p = 0.017), HDL-C (r = -0.332, p = 0.024), and
ApoA1 (r = -0.325, p = 0.028) displayed negative correlation with the severity of COVID-19.
FBG in patients with COVID-19 positively correlated with the level of CRP (r = 0.353, p<
0.001), and negatively correlated with the lymphocyte count (r = 0.27, p = 0.008) and

percentage of CD3+T cells (r = 0.206, p = 0.044). Serum total protein showed positive
correlation with the percentage of CD8+T cells (r = 0.208, p = 0.042). Serum albumin
displayed positive correlation with the lymphocyte count (r = 0.452, p<0.001) and CD8+T cell
percentage (r = 0.237, p = 0.02), and negative correlation with the levels of CRP (r = -0.252, p
= 0.013), IL-6 (r = -0.334, p = 0.001), IL-10 (r = -0.265, p = 0.009), and IL-6/IL-10 (r =
-0.284, p = 0.005). Total cholesterol positively correlated with the percentage of CD3+T cells
(r = 0.277, p = 0.006) and negatively correlated with the level of IL-6 (r = -0.219, p = 0.032).
The level of HDL-C negatively correlated with the level of IL-2 (r = -0.222, p = 0.030) and
IL-10 (r = -0.211, p = 0.039) in patients with COVID-19, and ApoA1 negatively correlated
with the level of CRP (r = -0.371, p<0.001), IL-2 (r = -0.207, p = 0.043), IL-6 (r = -0.237, p =
0.020), and IL-10 (r = -0.252, p = 0.013) (Table 3).
Role of metabolic and inflammatory indicators in predicting severity of COVID-19
In order to evaluate the value of the metabolic and inflammatory indices for predicting
severity of the disease, a receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve and the area under
ROC curve (AUROC) were analysed. Decrease in lymphocyte count, serum total protein,
serum albumin, HDL-C, ApoA1, CD3+T%, and CD8+T% were of considerable value in
predicting the transition of COVID-19 from mild to severe illness. Among the above indices,
lymphocyte count and serum total protein had more predictive value. AUROC and 95%
confidence interval (95% CI) of lymphocyte count, serum total protein, serum albumin, and
CD3+T% were 0.838 (95% CI: 0.727–0.949), 0.833 (95% CI: 0.714–0.951), 0.781 (95% CI:
0.652–0.910) and 0.784 (95% CI: 0.656–0.913), respectively (Figure 2). The severity
predictive value of lymphopenia was improved by adding serum total protein. AUROC of

lymphocyte count plus total protein was 0.899 (95% CI: 0.811–0.986) (Table 4).
Treatments and outcomes of patients with COVID-19
All patients in this study were treated with bed rest and supportive treatment. A total of 86
(88.7%) patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir or arbidol), 47 (48.5%) received
antibiotic therapy, 35 (36.1%) received immunomodulatory therapy (hydroxychloroquine or
chloroquine phosphate), 27 (27.8%) patients were given short-term (3–5 days) and low-dose
systematic corticosteroids. Higher percentages of severe patients received these therapies
(Table 5). Nasal cannula oxygen support was given to 15 patients (15.5%), with a higher
percentage among the severe patients than patients in the mild 1 group (40% vs. 7.1%). As of
10 March, 2020, which was the final date of follow up, out of the 97 patients, 66 (68%) had
been discharged, 30 (30.9%) were still hospitalized, and one (1%) had died. Severe patients
with COVID-19 had a higher chance of hospitalization than those with mild disease (52% vs.
28.6%) (Table 5).
Dynamic profile of laboratory tests in patients with COVID-19
To investigate the major laboratory and radiological features that appeared during COVID-19
progression, the dynamic changes in seven laboratory parameters and chest CT of two severe
patients were evaluated (Table 6). By 6 March, 2020, both the patients had been discharged
with negative novel coronavirus RNA nasopharyngeal swab test and absorbed lesions on CT
imaging. During hospitalization, majority of the patients had lymphopenia, hypoproteinaemia,
hypoalbuminemia, and low high-density lipoproteinemia in the early stage of the disease.
However, severe COVID-19 patients showed worsening of the parameters over time.
Additionally, we observed that the red blood cell count and haemoglobin concentration

progressively decreased during COVID-19 progression.
Chest CT scan demonstrated bilateral multiple small patches and interstitial changes in the
lungs after symptom onset (Figure 3). The lesions seen on chest CT gradually increased and
reached a peak with progressive lymphopenia, hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminemia, and low
high-density lipoproteinemia (Figure 3 and Table 6). In the late stage of COVID-19,
absorption of bilateral ground glass lesions was observed following treatment along with the
recovery of lymphocyte count, and increase in total protein, albumin, and HDL-C.
Discussion
The consequences of human exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus are closely related to the
functional status of the body, in addition to the virulence and dose of the exposure. Looking
for early warning indicators for severe type of COVID-19 may be helpful to reduce the
mortality. We found that the combination of a variety of chronic diseases was one of the
factors that contributed to high mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19. The
coexisting disorders in patients with severe COVID-19 in our study included hypertension
(40%), cardiovascular disease (8%), and diabetes (8%). A higher percentage of comorbidities
(hypertension and coronary heart disease) was found in severe patients than in mild patients
with COVID-19. An analysis of the clinical characteristics of 1,099 patients with COVID-19
revealed that 23.7% of the patients had coexisting diseases, including hypertension (15%),
diabetes (7.4%), coronary heart disease (2.5%), cerebrovascular disease (1.4%), and chronic
kidney disease (0.7%)[7]. Out of the above 1,099 patients, 15.7% had the critical type of
COVID-19, and 38.7% had other chronic diseases, including hypertension (23.7%), diabetes
(16.2%), coronary heart disease (5.8%), cerebrovascular disease (2.3%), and chronic kidney

disease (1.7%). CFR of the patients with comorbidities was significantly higher than that of
patients without comorbidities[3]. Cardiovascular diseases, especially hypertension, may
increase the risk of illness and death from COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection might attack
the cardiovascular system, leading to acute myocardial injury, hypotension, and
tachycardia[8]. The specific role of cardiovascular system in the pathogenesis of COVID-19
is still unclear. The high expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the
endothelial cells of the coronary arteries and the immune damage caused by the cytokines
released during the inflammatory storms in critically ill patients might explain the
involvement of the cardiovascular system [8 9].
The manifestation of impaired FBG in patients with mild COVID-19 was fasting
hypoglycaemia, while that in severe patients was predominantly fasting hyperglycaemia.
Since most of these patients did not have a history of diabetes, this might indicate impaired
glucose regulation in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 with severe COVID-19 patients
consuming more energy. These results suggest that supportive care and maintenance of
caloric intake are crucial during treatment. Progressive decrease in blood lymphocytes and
increase in IL-6 and CRP were found to be early clinical warning indicators for the
progression of mild COVID-19 patients to severe and critical patients, which were consistent
in our study. Moreover, we demonstrated that serum total protein, serum albumin, HDL-C,
ApoA1, CD3+T%, and CD8+T% were of significant value in predicting the progression of
patients with mild COVID-19 to severe and critical types of COVID-19. Serum albumin has
been thought to be an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with
community-acquired infectious diseases[10]. Hypoproteinaemia and hypoalbuminemia are

indicative of malnutrition and underlying infectious processes. In our study, the predictive
value of lymphocyte count for predicting the severity of COVID-19 was improved by adding
serum total protein. HDL-C and ApoA1 are known to play protective roles in normal health
and function of the lungs, as well as in a variety of disease states, including viral
pneumonia[11]. Serum HDL-C levels and serum albumin levels might decrease and serum
total cholesterol/HDL-C ratios and log (TG/HDL-C) values might increase proportionally in
community-acquired pneumonia[12]. In our study, hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminemia, and
low high-density lipoproteinemia were discovered in both mild and severe patients with
COVID-19, but were much worse in severely ill patients, thus suggesting that metabolic
disturbances contributed to the development of COVID-19. It has been reported that blood
urea nitrogen (BUN) to serum albumin ratio could be used as a prognostic factor for mortality
in patients with aspiration pneumonia [13]. However, this was not confirmed in our study.
Liver function damage was found to be more frequent in COVID-19 patients than in
non-COVID-19 patients[14]. In the present study, liver and kidney dysfunction were not
apparent in patients with COVID-19, possibly because only mild and severe cases of
COVID-19 were included in this study and liver and renal function damage mainly occurs in
critically ill patients.
IL-10 is a very important anti-inflammatory cytokine in pneumonia. In our study, the level of
IL-10 was higher in severe patients with COVID-19 than in mild patients. The levels of IL-6,
IL-10, and IL-6/IL-10 ratio were significantly elevated in the severe group, suggesting the
development of an overactive inflammatory response during the progression of the disease. A
recent pathological study demonstrated that acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was

the common immunopathological event in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections[15].
Cytokine storm is a feature of ARDS, and a severe systemic inflammatory response resulting
from the release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-6, TNF-α, TGFβ,
etc.) by immune effector cells develops in SARS-CoV infection, which might also occur in
SARS-CoV-2 infection[16]. Our previous study revealed that the number of cellular
immunity CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+T cells may be related to the severity of COVID-19[5]. It
has been shown that CD8+ T cells protect against pneumovirus-induced disease in mice[17].
In our study, the proportion of CD3+, CD8+, and CD16+56 T cells in the peripheral blood was
significantly reduced in severe COVID-19 patients compared with mild patients, suggesting
that these indices may be useful as an indicator of the disease status. Analysis of ROC curve
further confirmed the value of the proportions of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in predicting the
severity of COVID-19.
As a retrospective study, this study has some notable limitations. Firstly, due to the
requirements of the government to treat COVID-19 patients according to disease grades, our
institute only treated mild and severe patients, while critically ill patients were transferred to
other designated hospitals. This study was performed in a single centre and only included
patients with mild and severe types of COVID-19. Secondly, since the data generation was
clinically driven and not systematic, we did not include other markers that have been
associated with the outcomes of viral infectious diseases, such as D-dimer. Several patients
did not receive procalcitonin and sputum pathogenic microbe detection tests due to
overwhelmed medical resources.

severity of COVID-19. Decrease in lymphocyte count, serum total protein, serum albumin,
HDL-C, ApoA1, CD3+T%, and CD8+T% were of great value in predicting the transition of
COVID-19 from mild to severe illness. Among the above indices, lymphocyte count and
serum total protein had more predictive value.
