Abstract: - The Covid-19 pandemic is rapidly extended into the extraordinary crisis. Based on the SIR model
and published datasets the Covid-19 spread is assessed and predicted in USA in terms of susceptible, recovered
and infected in the communities is focused on this study. For modelling the USA pandemic prediction several
variants have been utilized. The SIR model splits the whole population into three components such as
Susceptible (S), Infected (I) and Recovered or Removed (R). A collection of differential equations have been
utilized to propagate the model and resolve the disease dynamics. In the proposed study, the prediction of
covid-19 based on time is performed using the modified SIR derived model SIR-D with discrete markov chain.
This proposed technique analyse and forecasting the covid-19 spread in 19 states of USA. The performance
analysis of the proposed Analytical results revealed that though the probable uncertainty of the proposed model
provides prediction, it becomes difficult to determine the death cases in future.

INTRODUCTION

COVID-19 expanded as Corona Virus Disease is an exact respiratory disease in human-beings that is caused by
a virus called corona. At present there is no medicine that is clinically proven to cure this disease. Researchers
have recommended that a tested and medically proven vaccine is away at a rate of one to two years. Many
countries have adopted national lockdown as per the guidelines of WHO (World Health Organization) so as to
reduce its spread. Formerly as per the study [1, 2] the COVID-19 case commenced in USA on 21st of January,
2020 in the state of Washington. Later this particular disease spread rapidly to almost many countries once the
virus has been tested in many centres. Epidemiology is a field of medicine that handles distribution, incidence
and potential disease control in a population. SIR model, one of the epidemiological models [3] is employed to
model the disease outspread in a population. This [4] particular model calculates the theoretical count of people
affected with an infectious disease over a time in a closed population. This SIR model [5] functions by making
an assumption such that there is an uninterrupted contact amongst the susceptible and infected population. This
assumption is a contravention with regard to a situation where various constraints such as social distancing and
quarantine have been imposed. In this, the population that have been infected is quarantined and will not
contribute to the disease spread. Thus to enhance the prediction of disease outspread, this research has made
several modifications in SIR model based on the existing SIR model to make predictions more accurately. On
the other hand, the infected individuals have been categorized on the basis of testing which is shown in figure.1.
The infected person is quarantined or not quarantined based on the results attained from testing. If the result of
the particular person is positive then he/she is quarantined. Likewise if a negative result is obtained then the
particular person is un-quarantined. Hence the overall predictions for the spread of the disease is possible
through the use of the proposed SIR model.

RELATED WORK

The following section deals with the different schemes, for the covid-19 pandemic prediction in various
countries, The COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease) was initially stated at 2019 by the end of the year and it has
been spreading rapidly to nearly all countries. It has extreme infectious nature. Due to this impact, most of the
countries have made compulsory measures to manage its spread. This article has used the infectious data in the
early phase to discuss certain parameters such as average duration of the infectious period, determination of the
fundamental reproduction number and assessment of the peak timing of the epidemic wave. Day-to-day
fatalities and case reports for many countries over a certain period has been assessed through the use of SIR
(Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model. The proposed model has been evaluated by conducting a comparative
analysis in which the actual data and the predictions has been compared. The analytical results revealed that the
predictions have been appreciated for all countries excluding USA as far as measures for lock-down were
maintained [6]. Additionally, [7] Conducted a study on a Euclidean network regarding the day-to-day COVID19 cases as well as cumulative data in China. The cumulative data is attained from a SIR model and can be
made suitable to an empirical form. It has been stated that this SIR model can replicate with efficient accuracy
for certain metric values. It can also detect the time at which the particular epidemic will be over. Similarly [8]
assessed the SIR model for COVID-19. The transmission rate is varied across many countries and excels the
recovery rate that permits a fast spread. Various analysis of this study has been conducted. From the analysis it
has been concluded that the spread of COVID-19 occurs except three countries that is japan, china and Korea.
Further [9] examined the pandemic of COVID-19 with the use of machine learning techniques and SIR model
for forecasting. Beneath the optimistic estimation regarding the pandemic of corona in few countries will come
to an end soon. It has also been found that for many part of the countries, the anti-pandemic hit will occur by the
April end. Here [10] Investigated the pandemic of COVID-19 particularly in Sweden. SIR and SI (Susceptibleinfected) model have been utilized for analysis. The proposed model replicate the infected cases and provides
similar predictions. Analytical results revealed that though the probable uncertainty of the proposed model
provides prediction, it becomes difficult to determine the death cases in future. Thus policy response has been
developed [11] by introducing three models on the basis of data driven for COVID-19 by means of minimum
parameters to give visions into the disease spread that might be utilized for policy responses development. The
three models that have been involved in the study include a self-exciting branching which is a process model,
exponential growth and SIR model. The proposed three models have been associated quantitatively. The SIR
model have been utilized for potential-effects demonstration with respect to distancing measures in short-term in
the US (United States).
Moreover [12] Studied the detection issues in a network where the information spread tracks the famous SIR
model. Here an assumption has been made in the undertaken simulation where all the nodes are initially in the
susceptible state in the network except the information source. The information source has been assumed to be
in the infected state. Thus the simulation results revealed that, the estimator provided by the algorithm called
reverse-infection (RI) is nearer to the actual source for tree networks. Further evaluation has been executed to
assess the RI performance on various real world networks. Likewise [13] attained an accurate analytical solution
of SIR model in a parametric form. The major characteristics of the accurate solution have been numerically
examined and it has been revealed that it replicates accurately the numerical result of the model equations. The
accurate solution has been found to be significant as biologists could utilize it to run experiments to detect the
outspread of COVID-19 by presenting natural conditions. Hence this study can be utilized to learn the several
ways to manage the epidemic spread. Further [14] introduced an approach on the basis of α – path that can
regulate the proposed SIR model. This approach has been utilized to compute the uncertainty distributions and
pertained Expected Values (EV) of the solutions. The results specify that the lockdown policy accomplishes
hundred percent efficiency after thirteenth of February in the year 2020 that is constant with the existing studies.

The proposed system creates new opportunities to solve multi-dimensional doubtful new applications and
differential equations in other fields. Hence this paper [15] used Gaussian mixture model for prediction of
COVID-19. The proposed system has been analysed to determine the performance and efficiency in terms of
prediction. The analytical results have shown that the proposed system provides optimistic results with the
ability to function as a better supplement to the existing methods for monitoring the predictions of COVID-19
pandemic continuously. Further the spread of COVID-19 within a community has been examined through the
[16] Proposed SIR model that affords a theoretical framework. Analysis has been performed by considering the
period from January to June of 2020. This particular period consisted data previously and at the time of strict
measure implementation. Various predictions have been proposed based on certain parameters. Comparative
analysis of the recorded data with the actual data has been performed to determine the spread of this particular
disease. The results from comparative analysis revealed that the disease spread can be managed in all
communities if strong policies and correct restrictions are employed to manage the infection rates before the
disease outspread. Similarly an another model called Poisson model has been developed [17] by means of
removal rates and transmission with respect to time-dependency to account for potential random errors while
computing and reporting a reproduction number with respect to time-dependent disease. This might reflect the
efficiency of the virus management approaches. The proposed method can be employed to review the pandemic
in many severely affected countries. The forecast and analysis has been performed regarding the growing
outspread of the disease. An interactive web application has also been developed to help the readers to use the
proposed method. Various other analytical tools has also been presented [18] for prediction, planning and
forecasting at the time of pandemic. Prognosticated the growth rate of COVID-19 with epidemiological,
statistical, a new forecasting technique and deep and machine learning models on the basis of clustering and
nearest neighbours. Additionally forecasting has been performed with regard to abundant demand for services
and products at the time of pandemic through the use of simulations (decisions of government regarding
lockdown) and auxiliary data. It has been found that the results can aid planners and policy makers to take better
decisions in the course of future and ongoing pandemics. Thus many forecasting models is yet to be identified.
Although [19] many theoretical methods have been proposed for predicting the threshold of epidemics that
includes QMF (Quenched-Mean Field), MFL (Mean-Field Like) and DMP (Dynamical Message Passing)
method. Once these methods have been employed for epidemic threshold prediction they frequently provide
different outcomes and its accuracy level has also been found to unknown. These challenges has been
consistently analyzed between accuracy level and different outcomes by examining and studying the SIR model
on configuration networks that is uncorrelated. It has been found that the performance of MFL method has been
better than QMF and DMP. Several transactional datasets has also been incorporated in [20] to examine the role
of policies of social distancing in many countries. The study has also reviewed the pandemic of coronavirus
disease and its transmission rate over a period of five weeks. This process depend on the official reports of
COVID-19 and SIR model. Simulation has been carried to assess the system performance. The simulation
results revealed the concerning of social distancing envelopments has been found to be effective in reducing the
COVID-19 spread. Few models have also been designed to predict the pandemic of COVID-19. [21] This study
has incorporated the (EPM) Epidemic Prediction Model with respect to real pandemic data globally and has
taken into account the execution of control measures and the impact of environmental factors to create a
prediction system globally. Thus the proposed study predicts the disease (COVID-19) over globe day by day in
each country. Similarly in Brazil [22] Demonstrated and forecast the early commencement of the pandemic of
COVID-19 by utilizing the recent Brazilian data. This study has used SIR model with two variations and
comprised the influence of measures in social distancing. Hence the results exhibited that the policy of social
distancing executed by the government is capable of reducing the infection pattern of COVID-19. Likewise [23]
COVID-19 has caused pandemic situations and an elaborate analysis of this study is yet to come. But at the
same time an evaluation regarding the disease parameters has to be executed to estimate early predictions about
the possible durations for the sustaining pandemic. For this purpose SIR model has been proposed to make early
estimations about the pandemic. It has been found that the prediction accuracy diminishes when the isolation
speed gets altered. Thus measures for lockdown of this particular disease can be implemented to reduce the
spread. For this purpose [24] Employed SIR model to detect and predict the various pandemic of COVID-19.
This study has explored the rate of infection spread and aids doctors to take decisions accordingly to prevent the
spread of disease.

by utilizing SIR differential equation model (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) the information is retrieved.
Based on the standard SIR model the proposed study derived a mathematical model. For evaluating the

infectious disease outbreaks, SIR model is considered as fundamental statistical tool. However, it is not
considering the asymptomatic cases which are the infection source in the whole population and also infection
transmitted through the touching objects. With respect to disease transmission, various random factors are
presented. By considering all these factors, the proposed study developed the modified SIR derived (SIR-D)
model. For SIR-D, the parameter estimation is applied to the time-series data related with covid-19 infection
rate in USA which define its impacts.

with discrete markov chain. The performance analysis results are depicted in the following section
4.1 Dataset Description
For covid-19 prediction and analysis, the dataset is collected from Covid-19 confirmed cases from US. The
number of confirmed cases, number of recovered cases and number of susceptible cases are collected from Jan
22, 2020 to April 14, 2020 considered as proposed dataset. The dataset is collected from 19 states in USA. The
source of the dataset link is https://data.world/shad/covid-19-time-series-data.
4.2 Performance analysis

Figure.2. Different cases of COVID-19 in Alabama
The cases of COVID-19 in Alabama is shown in figure 2. Here the susceptible case is found to be in peak
initially, but as time and days passed the rate of susceptible cases gradually decreased. The infected rate is found
to be moderate and this rate also gradually decreased as days and time passed. The recovered rate of COVID-19
cases is found to be zero initially, that is the susceptible and recovered rate has been found to be inversely
proportional. It has been predicted that the recovery rate gradually increased and reached the peak when the
days passed.

cases is found to be zero initially, that is the susceptible and recovered rate has been found to be inversely
proportional. It is predicted that the recovery rate gradually increased and reached the peak when the days
passed.

Conclusion

This proposed study has incorporated the covid-19 pandemic Prediction Model with respect to real pandemic
dataset from USA on account of the execution of control measures and the impact of environmental factors to
create a prediction system in USA. Based on the SIR model the proposed system is assessed and predicted the
covid-19 forecasting in terms of susceptible, recovered and infected in the communities. The prediction of
covid-19 with respect to time/days is performed using the modified SIR derived model SIR-D with discrete
markov chain. This proposed technique analysed and predicted the covid-19 spread in 19 states of USA.
