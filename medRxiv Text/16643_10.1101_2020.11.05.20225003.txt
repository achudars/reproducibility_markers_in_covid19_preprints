Abstract

48

Several tests based on chemiluminescence immunoassay techniques have become available to test for

49

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. There is currently insufficient data on serology assay performance beyond 35

50

days after symptoms onset. We aimed to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests on three widely used

51

platforms. A chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA; Abbott Diagnostics, USA), a

52

luminescence immunoassay (LIA; Diasorin, Italy), and an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay

53

(ECLIA; Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) were investigated. In a multi-group study, sensitivity was

54

assessed in a group of participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (n=145), whereas specificity was

55

determined in two groups of participants without evidence of COVID-19 (i.e. healthy blood donors, n=191,

56

and healthcare workers, n=1002). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, multilevel likelihood

57

ratios (LR), and positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were characterized. Finally,

58

analytical specificity was characterized in samples with evidence of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) (n=9),

59

cytomegalovirus (CMV) (n=7) and endemic common cold coronavirus infections (n=12) taken prior to the

60

current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The diagnostic accuracy was comparable in all three assays (AUC 0.98).

61

Using the manufacturers’ cut-offs, the sensitivities were 90%, 95% confidence interval,[84,94] (LIA), 93%

62

[88,96] (CMIA), and 96% [91,98] (ECLIA). The specificities were 99.5% [98.9,99.8]( CMIA) 99.7%

63

[99.3,99,9] (LIA) and 99.9% [99.5,99.98] (ECLIA). The LR at half of the manufacturers’ cut-offs were 60

64

(CMIA), 82 (LIA), and 575 (ECLIA) for positive and 0.043 (CMIA) and 0.035 (LIA, ECLIA) for negative

65

results. ECLIA had higher PPV at low pretest probabilities than CMIA and LIA. No interference with EBV

66

or CMV infection was observed, whereas endemic coronavirus in some cases provided signals in LIA

67

and/or CMIA. Although the diagnostic accuracy of the three investigated assays is comparable, their

68

performance in low-prevalence settings is different. Introducing gray zones at half of the manufacturers’

69

cut-offs is suggested, especially for orthogonal testing approaches that use a second assay for

70

confirmation.

Introduction

78

COVID-19 is a recently emerging pandemic disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although

79

there are considerable differences regarding its incidence, hospitalization rate, morbidity rate, and case

80

fatality rate between different countries, disease control at the moment is uniformly achieved by strict

81

prevention measures such as social distancing, wearing of face masks, hand-washing, contact tracing

82

and testing, quarantine or isolation 1. Whereas the diagnosis of acute disease in the medical laboratory

83

most importantly relies on RT-PCR testing, serological testing for antibodies specifically directed against

84

viral proteins of SARS-CoV2 has increasingly come into the focus of public health authorities and medical

85

institutions 2-8. The clinical presentation of COVID-19 has been shown to be heterogeneous in severity as

86

well as in clinical signs and symptoms 9. A substantial proportion of patients have only minimal

87

symptomatology or are even asymptomatic

88

therapies are very limited

121

different specific antigens, i.e., the internal nucleocapsid (N) antigen or the surface spike protein (S1 or

122

S1/S2) 27. Not all SARS-CoV2 antibodies exhibit neutralizing properties. However, it has been shown that

123

antibodies against nucleocapsid antigen and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein have

The predictive values of negative and positive results depend on the pretest probability of the

126

presence of COVID-19 disease. In low-prevalence settings (<5% seropositivity), positive predictive values

are critically dependent on specificity 35. Since the specificity of SARS-CoV2 antibody tests has been the

128

subject of debate, false positive results can occur in low-prevalence settings

129

results are particularly problematic in low prevalence settings, as these could lead concerned individuals

130

COVID-19 patients to assess diagnostic sensitivity. Subsequently, we assessed the diagnostic specificity

135

of these tests in a cohort of healthcare workers and a cohort of healthy blood donors. Finally, we assessed

136

the analytical specificity of the different assays in samples collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,

137

which may potentially contain cross-reacting antibodies. In a model, we finally related the identified

138

diagnostic characteristics to negative and positive predictive values depending on the pretest probability

139

of having had COVID-19 in the personal history.

Methods

142

Study setting and study population

143

This is a study on diagnostic tests used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in individuals originating

144

from Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Anonymized samples originating from four different types of patients

145

were investigated with three CLIAs. The first group of patients was retrospectively assembled from

146

Liechtenstein and Swiss patients having their laboratory evaluations sent to labormedizinisches zentrum

147

Dr. Risch in Vaduz (Liechtenstein) and Buchs (Switzerland) and consisted of COVID-19 patients (mainly

148

outpatients) whose serum was drawn after COVID-19 disease was confirmed by RT-PCR between March

149

2nd and April 23rd, 2020 (n=145). This group was used for determination of sensitivity. The method of RT-

150

PCR measurement has been conducted as reported elsewhere

151

prospectively and consecutively enrolled within a national COVID-19 cohort, whereas the Swiss patients

152

consisted from a retrospectively assembled convenience sample, both detailed in references

153

second group of individuals was prospectively assembled and consisted of consecutive healthy blood

154

donors from the Blutspendedienst Graubünden without clinical suspicion of COVID-19 providing blood for

155

testing SARS-CoV2 antibodies from April 15th to May 4th, 2020 (n=191). In addition to fulfilling the normal

156

criteria of blood donation, these blood donors specifically responded they had had no had flu-like

157

symptoms or contact with a known COVID-19 patient during the past 14 days. The third cohort was

158

prospectively assembled within a study setting from the Kantonsspital St. Gallen and consisted of

159

healthcare workers providing a blood sample for detecting SARS-CoV2 antibodies between March 19th

160

and April 3rd, 2020 (n=1002) as described elsewhere

161

second week of April 2020. The blood donors and the healthcare workers were used to determine

162

specificity. Since these 2 groups did not have RT-PCR testing available, samples with at least two of the

164

individuals had occult SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such an orthogonal testing approach for SARS-CoV-2

165

antibodies has been reported to have a very high positive predictive value for COVID-19 and therefore is

166

suited to reliably exclude individuals with recent COVID-19 infection 40-42. Characteristics of the excluded

167

10 seropositive individuals among the healthcare workers are detailed elsewhere (i.e. 6 individuals had

168

all three assays positive, 3 had CMIA and ECLIA positive, one had CMIA and LIA positive)

169

individuals were excluded among the blood donors (one individual with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR

170

result 24 days before sampling, three asymptomatic individuals). In the excluded blood donors, all three

171

chemiluminescence assays were positive. The fourth group of samples consisted of historical samples

172

sent to the labormedizinisches zentrum Dr. Risch in Buchs (Switzerland) that were known to have an

173

active or reactivated specific viral disease (Epstein–Barr virus, EBV, n=9; cytomegalovirus, CMV, m=7;

174

other common-cold coronaviruses: HKU1, NL63, OC43, 229E, n=12) to explore any cross-reactivity

175

causing false positive results in SARS-CoV2 serology. Endemic coronavirus disease was diagnosed

176

during 2019 in 10 cases, in January 2020 in 1 case, and in mid-February 2020 1 case, 8 days before the

177

first case of COVID-19 was reported in Switzerland. The last serum sample of patients with endemic

178

coronavirus disease was collected on March 2nd, 2020, which was 7 days after the first case in Switzerland

179

was identified. Samples from patients with active EBV (VCA IgM positive, EBNA IgG negative) as well as

180

active or reactivated CMV infection (IgG positive, IgM positive) were all drawn in 2019, i.e., before COVID-

181

19 was first diagnosed in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The study protocol was verified by the cantonal

182

ethics boards of Zurich (BASEC Req-20-00587) and Eastern Switzerland (EKOS; BASEC Nr. Req’s 2020-

183

00502 and 2020-00586). Whereas the cohort with healthcare workers provided written informed consent,

184

informed consent for performing laboratory analysis on anonymized samples in the other three groups

was waived. The study was taking into account the STARD guidelines 43.

nucleocapsid antigen for detection of total immunoglobulin. The molecular target from the Abbott

195

Diagnostics assay (SARS-CoV-2 IgG; CMIA) is also the nucleocapsid antigen, and it measures specific

196

IgG levels. The Diasorin assay (LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG; LIA) measures specific IgG directed

197

against S1/S2 antigens. To further elucidate the effects of any cross-reacting antibodies in the 3

198

chemiluminescence assays in the samples with EBV, CMV, or following endemic coronavirus, we also

199

employed the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (Euroimmun, Luzern, Switzerland) to measure specific IgG

200

and IgA on a DSX instrument (Dynex Technologies, Denkendorf, Germany). The coefficients of variation

201

(CV’s) of the employed methods in our hands were 2.7% for ECLIA, 3.6% for CMIA, 5.4% for LIA, 4.6%

202

for IgG ELISA, and 3.6% for IgA ELISA.

203
204

Statistical methods

205

Specificity was determined in the samples originating from blood donors and healthcare workers. The

206

sensitivity of the different assays was assessed in the group of patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-

207

19 disease. The following cut-offs provided by the manufacturers were employed: a COI (COI= cutoff

208

index) >0.9 for ECLIA, a S/C value (S/C=extinction of the patient sample divided by the extinction of the

209

calibrator) >12 for LIA, a S/C value >1.4 for CMIA, and a S/C value of >1.1 in the ELISA. We also applied

210

alternative cut-offs (half and double of the manufacturers’ cut-offs), in order to better understand the

211

relationship between signal strength and associated diagnostic characteristics. Positive and negative

212

likelihood ratios (LR) were calculated for the different cut-off levels 44. Regarding interpretation of LR, it is

213

generally acknowledged that a +LR >10 as well as a –LR <0.1 generate large and often conclusive

214

changes from the pretest to the posttest probability. A +LR between 5 and 10 as well as a –LR between

215

0.1 and 0.2 generate moderate shifts from the pretest to the posttest probability, whereas a +LR between

216

2 to 5 and a –LR from 0.2 to 0.5 generate small but sometimes important changes from the pretest to the

217

posttest probability

218

(AUCs) calculated as an indicator of diagnostic accuracy. The AUCs for the different parameters were

219

compared by the method of Hanley and McNeil. Positive and negative predictive values for each of the

220

employed assays were then plotted as a function of pretest probability, as described earlier 45. Continuous

221

variables are given as medians and interquartile ranges [IQRs], whereas proportions are given as

222

percentages together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Agreement between the two methods was

223

assessed by Cohen’s kappa. The associations between variables were calculated with Spearman rank

44.

Baseline characteristics

230

The group of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients consisted of 145 individuals with a median age of 46

231

years (IQR [30,58] years), and 79 of the patients, i.e., 48% (95% CI [40,56]), were female. The sera were

232

taken after a median of 47 IQR [40,54; minimum 21, maximum 66] days after first presentation with

233

suspected COVID-19. The blood donors had a median age of 44 years IQR [28,53], and 90 of the 191

234

donors, i.e., 47% (95% CI [40,54]) were female. In the cohort of healthcare workers, the median age was

235

38 years (IQR [30,49]), and 753 (75.1%, 95% CI [72.4,77.7]) were female. The cohort with prior EBV,

236

CMV or endemic coronavirus had a median age of 31 years (IQR [16,60]), and 17/30 (57%, 95% CI

237

[39,73]) were women. Serum samples of patients with common cold caused by endemic coronavirus had

238

their samples taken a median of 94 (IQR [30,235]) days after diagnosis. As shown in Figure 1 a-c, antibody

239

titers were different between COVID-19 patients and individuals without COVID-19. The correlation

240

between the 3 different assays was highly significant (p<0.0001). The agreement of the methods when

241

we used the manufacturers’ cut-offs showed a kappa value of 0.92 between CMIA and LIA, 0.96 between

242

CMIA and ECLIA, and 0.94 between LIA and ECLIA. In the COVID-19 patients, there was a significant

243

inverse association between days after RT-PCR and S/C in CMIA (r=-0.25, p=0.003), but not in LIA or

244

ECLIA.

Diagnostic specificity and sensitivity at the manufacturers’ cut-offs

When looking at specificities of the different assays at the cut-offs provided by the manufacturers within

248

the group of blood donors and healthcare workers without COVID-19, the following characteristics were

249

observed: 99.5% specificity (95% CI [98.9,99.8], i.e., 1187/1193 individuals; 3 false positives from blood

250

donors, 3 false positives from healthcare workers) for the CMIA, 99.7% specificity (95% CI [99.3,99,9],

251

i.e., 1190/1193 individuals; 1 false positive from blood donors, 2 false positives from healthcare workers)

252

for the LIA, and 99,91% specificity (95% CI [99.5,99.98], i.e. 1192/1193 individuals; 1 false positive from

253

healthcare workers) for the ECLIA. There was no overlap between the participants with false positive

the CMIA, 90% (95% CI [84,94], i.e., 130/145) for the LIA, and 96% (95% CI [91,98], i.e., 139/145) for the

256

ECLIA. When performing ROC analysis on all COVID-19 cases and healthy controls, the AUCs of the

257

different assays in detecting COVID-19 disease were 0.984 (95% CI [0.976,0.99]) for CMIA and 0.982

258

(95% CI [0.974,0.989]) for both the LIA and the ECLIA (curves not shown). There were no significant

259

differences between the AUCs of the three assays.

261

Multilevel likelihood ratios

262

We then calculated multilevel likelihood ratios at the manufacturers’ cut-off levels as well as at half and

263

double the manufacturers’ cut-off levels, i.e., a S/C of 0.7, 1.4 and 2.8 for the CMIA, respectively, a S/C

264

of 6, 12, and 24 for the LIA, and a COI of 0.5, 1, and 2 for the ECLIA. Table 1 illustrates the different

265

positive (+LR) and negative likelihood ratios (-LR). Regarding diagnostic value of the LR, the investigated

266

serological tests can be considered to offer meaningful diagnostic characteristics. Of note, clinical

267

characteristics are already meaningful at lower cut-off levels than recommended by the manufacturer.

268
269

Operational test characteristics

270

The positive predictive values (PPVs) for three different cut-offs (manufacturers’ cut-offs and half as well

271

as double the manufacturers’ cut-off values are shown in Figures 2a (CMIA), 2b (LIA), and 2c (ECLIA)). It

272

can be seen that ECLIA, especially in low pretest probability settings, due to the high specificity has

273

somewhat higher PPVs than the other assays: at the manufacturer’s cut-off, the PPV was 97% at a pretest

274

probability of 3 percent, whereas at half of the manufacturer’s cut-off, the PPV at a pretest probability of

275

3% was 95%. For the LIA, the PPV at a pretest probability of 5% was 95%, whereas the same PPV at half

276

of the manufacturer’s cut-off was achieved with a pretest probability of 18%. At double the manufacturer’s

277

cut-off, a PPV of 95% in the LIA was achieved with a pretest probability of 2%. Finally, with the CMIA, at

278

the manufacturer’s cut-off, a PPV of 95% was achieved at a pretest probability of 5%, whereas at half of

279

the manufacturer’s cut-off, the same PPV was seen at a pretest probability of 23%. At double the

280

manufacturer’s cut-off, the CMIA had a PPV of 95% at a pretest probability of 4%.

281

Regarding negative predictive values (NPVs), the ECLIA due to the highest sensitivity had a NPV

282

of 99% up to a pretest probability of 26% at the manufacturer’s cut-off. At half of the manufacturer’s cut-

283

off, a NPV of 99% was seen up to a pretest probability of 30%. With the LIA, the NPV at the manufacturers’

cut-off was at 99% up to a pretest probability of 11%, whereas at half of the manufacturer’s cut-off, the

285

NPV was at 99% up to a pretest probability of 30%. In the CMIA, the NPV at the manufacturer’s cut-off

286

was 99% up to a pretest probability of 21%, whereas at half of the cut-off, the NPV was 99% up to a

287

pretest probability of 26%.

289

Analytical specificity

290

None of the assays showed positive antibodies in sera from patients with active EBV or CMV disease. Of

291

the sera taken after endemic coronavirus infection, 4 were infected with RC229E, 3 were infected with

292

RCNL63, 2 were infected with RCHKU1, 2 had an infection with RCOC43, and one patient had both

293

RC229E and RCNL63. None of the patients showed antibody positivity in the ECLIA. In three patients

294

following infection with different coronaviruses, the CMIA showed an S/C result of 0.4 (infection with

295

RCHKU1; SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG 0.1; IgA 0.3), 0.5 (infection with RCOC43; SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG

296

0.1; IgA 0.1), and 0.1 (infection with RC229E; SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG 0.7; IgA 4.1), whereas the other

297

samples did not reveal a detectable signal. The sample of a patient with RCOC43 infection with a

298

detectable CMIA signal also had a detectable LIA signal of 6.1, whereas all other samples had

299

unmeasurable signals. All together, even if SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers following endemic coronavirus

300

infections were below the manufacturers’ cut-offs for positivity, 3 samples exhibited detectable antibodies

301

in the CMIA assay, one of which was also in the LIA assay.

302
303
304

Discussion

305

The present study investigated the analytical (analytical specificity), diagnostic (diagnostic sensitivity and

306

specificity), and operational characteristics (likelihood ratios, predictive values) of three highly automated

307

assays for the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. These characteristics were investigated after

308

a median of 47 days after PCR-positivity. Although the three test formats showed comparable diagnostic

309

accuracy, test performance varied regarding positive predictive values in the low-prevalence setting.

310

Finally, the investigated tests did not show interference with two commonly encountered infections, i.e.,

311

EBV and CMV. There was, however, cross-reactivity in some patients with proven previous infection by

312

endemic coronaviruses for two of the three analyzed tests.

313

The timing of antibody development in COVID-19 disease is crucial. Long and colleagues

314

demonstrated that IgG or IgM can be detectable in approximately 60% of patients at days 5-7 after

315

symptom onset, in 95% of patients after 12-14 days and in 100% of patients after 17 to 19 days 6. Tang

316

and colleagues demonstrated a seroconversion rate of 93.8% for CMIA and 89.4% for ECLIA 14 days

317

after symptom onset and later

318

regarding the usefulness of antibody tests to diagnose current or past infection with SARS-CoV-2 stated

319

that there are too few studies available to estimate test sensitivity beyond 35 days after symptom onset

320

30.

321

therefore fills an important gap.

A systematic review performed by the Cochrane collaboration

The present study, with a median of 47 days after presentation for symptomatic COVID-19 disease,

Laboratory results are interpreted by combining pretest probabilities with diagnostic

323

characteristics to obtain negative and positive predictive values according to Bayes’ theorem

324

best of our knowledge, there is no clinical score available to predict the pretest probability of COVID-19

325

based only on clinical symptoms and history without any laboratory or imaging results

326

based on clinical history taking would improve the interpretation of COVID-19 serology results, not least

327

in a retrospective setting, where accurate laboratory results are not available because no blood has been

328

drawn. However, there are several other proxies to assess pretest probabilities. In the Swiss and

329

Liechtenstein setting, several situations can be described, in which the risk for patients to contract COVID-

330

19 can be quantified

331

patients with fever >38°C and respiratory symptoms. Knowing the temporal and regional seroprevalence

332

of the region also allows for an approximation of pretest probability even without knowing the clinical

333

symptoms of a specific patient 50.

Such a score

334

The predictive values depend not only on the pretest probability but also on the sensitivity and

335

specificity of a test at a given cut-off. Negative results using the manufacturers’ cut-offs had an NPV of

336

99% up to a pretest probability of 11% to 26%. At half of the manufacturer’s cut-off, past COVID-19 could

337

be ruled out with a probability of 99% up to a pretest probability of 26% (CMIA) to 30% (LIA, ECLIA).

338

These pretest probabilities are in the range of those observed in symptomatic individuals. Thus, serology

339

done in patients with clinical symptoms three or more weeks before drawing blood together with

340

manufacturers’ and modified manufacturers’ cut-offs can be considered safe to exclude COVID-19

341

disease. Nevertheless, serological non-responders can occur with a frequency of approximately 3% and

342

may go overlooked. False negative results, if they occur at a low frequency, can be considered of minor

343

importance because they are not expected to change an individual’s behavior in response to its potential

344

damage.

345

Regarding PPV, which is the probability that a positive result indicates a past infection with SARS-

346

CoV-2, the ECLIA with the manufacturer cut-off provided the best operational characteristics at low pretest

347

probabilities < 5%. In this assay, the PPV at 3% pretest probability was 97%, which raises the question

348

whether positive ECLIA results should be confirmed by an orthogonal testing approach

349

taking the lower limit of the 95% CI of the specificity, i.e. 99.5%, the PPV at 1% pretest probability is 66%,

350

and 91% at 5% pretest probability. We therefore recommend continuing with the confirmation of positive

351

ECLIA results with a second assay 40. Our data also show that at the manufacturer cut-offs, the CMIA and

352

LIA need confirmatory testing in low pretest probability (<5%) settings. Otherwise, the risk of false positive

353

results is larger than 5%. The problem of false positive results is that they can change the behavior of

354

individuals in that they will not adhere to hygienic and distancing measures after the (false) positive result

355

has been disclosed. This puts individuals at increased risk for contracting COVID-19, with its potentially

356

devastating consequences 13. The medical laboratory thus has a great responsibility to deliver meaningful

357

results to the patients and their physicians.

meaningful changes from pretest to posttest probability

Our findings suggest that all three assays

360

provide meaningful information, even at half of the manufacturers’ cut-off values. The figures of pretest

361

probabilities against NPV illustrate that taking half of the manufacturer cut-off as a decision limit will still

362

safely rule out COVID-19: a cut-off as low as half of the manufacturer cut-off will correctly detect 98.9%

363

(95% CI [98.1,99.4]) (13/1193) of the COVID-19-negative cases in the CMIA. The respective proportions

364

are similar for the LIA (98.8%, 95% CI [98,99.3], (14/1193) and ECLIA (99.7%, 95% CI [99.3,99.9],

365

3/1193). For ruling out COVID-19, modified decision limits thus seem appropriate.

366

Looking at the relationship between pretest probability and PPV at a cut-off half of the

367

manufacturer’s cut-off illustrates that such a cut-off does not reliably diagnose past COVID-19 in low test

368

probability settings. However, using an orthogonal testing approach recommended by the U.S. Food and

369

Drug Administration 41, i.e., an ECLIA result of 0.6 together with an LIA result of 6.1, would lead to a PPV

370

of 99.1% at a pretest probability of 1%. A similar result would be achieved with a CMIA result of 0.7

371

together with an LIA result of 6.1, which at a pretest probability of 2% results in a PPV of 99%. This

372

example illustrates that the introduction of gray zones should be considered not only for ELISA but also

374

professionals 53.

375

The fact that we found some cross-reactivity in patients with prior endemic coronaviruses raises

376

the question whether this finding represents analytical cross-reactivity or reflects cross-reactive immunity

377

conferred by recent endemic coronavirus disease. We did not conduct neutralization assays to clarify this

378

issue. However, Ng and colleagues reported that patient sera from human coronaviruses variably reacted

379

with SARS-CoV-2 S-antigen and nucleocapsid antigen, but not with the S1 subunit 29. These patient sera

380

exhibited neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotypes according to the levels of SARS-CoV-

381

2 S-binding IgG and with efficiencies comparable to those of COVID-19 patient sera

382

had one case with a LIA signal (targeting S1-S2 antigen) and a CMIA signal (targeting nucleocapsid

383

antigen) without a signal in the IgG ELISA (which is targeted against S1). This patient had his serum

384

taken in September 2019 after infection with RCOC43 was diagnosed in January 2019. We are convinced

385

that identifying patients with endemic coronaviruses with potential neutralizing cross-reactivity will be of

386

increasing importance in the future. Whereas CMIA and LIA could play a role in identifying such

387

individuals, ECLIA is not expected to help further in this aspect, as none of the patients with endemic

388

coronavirus had a measurable antibody response. The measurements in the healthcare workers as well

389

as in the blood donors suggest that such constellations do not occur often: 1147/1193 (i.e., 96.1 (95% CI

390

[94.9,97.1])) have unmeasurable antibody titers in the LIA, whereas this frequency amounts to 921/1193

391

(i.e., 77.2% (95% CI [74.7,79.5])) in the CMIA.

29.

In our study, we

392

Our study has strengths and limitations. A strength is that specificity has been assessed in a large

393

group of 1193 individuals without evidence of COVID-19. Such an approach offers the possibility to

394

describe the specificity with relatively narrow confidence intervals. A further strength is that we investigate

395

several potential cut-offs for clinical decision making. A limitation of the study is that samples employed

396

for evaluation of specificity were selected from contemporary and not pre-pandemic participants. Two

397

positive serology results in an orthogonal testing approach cannot provide 100% certainty that any

398

remaining false positives are truly false positive. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that combination of two

399

positive results with chemiluminescence assays has a very high positive predictive value even at low

400

pretest probabilities, comparable to that known from molecular methods 42. Further, inclusion of the index

401

serology tests as part of the reference standard definition of absence of disease carries a risk of bias in

402

results. At low pretest probabilities, such a bias might have a considerable impact on positive predictive

403

values. There are several factors mitigating such a misinterpretation: a.) utilizing an orthogonal testing

404

approach in initially positive results, b.) the fact that even in the first wave of COVID-19, COVID-19

405

prevalence in some regions of Europe was already more than 10%, which cannot be considered low

406

The specificities identified in our study from contemporary samples are comparable to those obtained in

407

a similar study on pre-pandemic samples 54. The study is finally limited by the fact that we did not have a

408

full clinical description of the COVID-19 patients included in this study, and patients hospitalized due to

409

COVID-19 represented a minority of the COVID-19 patients. However, since the majority of patients

410

subjected to serology will originate from the outpatient setting, we believe that this fact actually strengthens

411

our findings. In sum, we think that the limitations do not invalidate our findings.

50.

412

In conclusion, we evaluated the serology in patients at a median of 47 days following the first

413

presentation of suspected COVID-19 infection and selected individuals without COVID-19 during the

414

pandemic. We found that the diagnostic accuracy of the three investigated assays was comparable. Assay

415

cut-offs have not been designed for orthogonal testing. Introducing gray zones at half of the

416

manufacturers’ cut-offs is suggested. These differentiated cut-offs would allow for safer ruling out or ruling

417

in of past COVID-19 infections. Such an approach would allow us to more appropriately select samples

418

for further testing in an independent assay in an orthogonal testing algorithm. We propose that our findings

419

be replicated in other populations.
