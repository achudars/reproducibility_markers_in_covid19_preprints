Abstract
Objectives: The epidemiology of post-COVID syndrome (PCS) is currently undefined. We quantified
rates of organ-specific impairment following recovery from COVID-19 hospitalisation compared with
those in a matched control group, and how the rate ratio (RR) varies by age, sex, and ethnicity.

Design: Observational, retrospective, matched cohort study.

Setting: NHS hospitals in England.

Participants: 47,780 individuals (mean age 65 years, 55% male) in hospital with COVID-19 and
discharged alive by 31 August 2020, matched to controls on demographic and clinical characteristics.

Outcome measures: Rates of hospital readmission, all-cause mortality, and diagnoses of respiratory,
cardiovascular, metabolic, kidney and liver diseases until 30 September 2020.

Results: Mean follow-up time was 140 days for COVID-19 cases and 153 days for controls. 766
(95% confidence interval: 753 to 779) readmissions and 320 (312 to 328) deaths per 1,000 personyears were observed in COVID-19 cases, 3.5 (3.4 to 3.6) and 7.7 (7.2 to 8.3) times greater,
respectively, than in controls. Rates of respiratory, diabetes and cardiovascular events were also
significantly elevated in COVID-19 cases, at 770 (758 to 783), 127 (122 to 132) and 126 (121 to 131)
events per 1,000 person-years, respectively. RRs were greater for individuals aged <70 than ≥70
years, and in ethnic minority groups than the White population, with the biggest differences observed
for respiratory disease: 10.5 [9.7 to 11.4] for <70 years versus 4.6 [4.3 to 4.8] for ≥70 years, and 11.4
(9.8 to 13.3) for Non-White versus 5.2 (5.0 to 5.5) for White.

Conclusions: Individuals discharged from hospital following COVID-19 face elevated rates of multiorgan dysfunction compared with background levels, and the increase in risk is neither confined to the
elderly nor uniform across ethnicities. The diagnosis, treatment and prevention of PCS require
integrated rather than organ- or disease-specific approaches. Urgent research is required to establish
risk factors for PCS.

Introduction
In the early coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in the UK, approximately 6% of people were
thought to have had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection, rising
to 13% in London.[1] The majority of the research, health service and media response to the virus has
focused on direct (through infection) and indirect (through impact on individual behaviours and health
system changes) effects of COVID-19 on mortality[2] and short-term impacts.[3,4] However, the
longer-term effects on morbidity need to be studied in order to plan for effective healthcare delivery
and capacity.

Since SARS-CoV2 infection was recognised in late 2019, academic and clinical emphasis has been
on respiratory manifestations.[5] However, there is increasing evidence for direct multi-organ
effects,[6-10] as well as indirect effects on other organ systems and disease processes, such as
cardiovascular diseases and cancers, through changes in healthcare delivery and patient
behaviours.[11-13] Although the long-term impact of COVID-19 on individuals and health systems is
becoming clear, there is an urgent need for investigation across organ systems.

Long COVID, or post-COVID syndrome (PCS), is not a single condition, and has been defined by the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as “signs and symptoms that develop during
or following an infection consistent with COVID-19 which continue for more than 12 weeks and are
not explained by an alternative diagnosis.”[14] Guidelines recommend referral to PCS assessment
clinics if post-COVID symptoms persist for 6-12 weeks.[14] Pre-existing conditions and risk factors are
predictors of acute COVID-19 outcomes (such as intensive care admissions and mortality[2]), but the
epidemiology of PCS has been less well defined[15,16] due to unclear medium- and long-term
pathophysiology across organ systems. As PCS clinics are implemented, characterisation of disease
epidemiology will aid appropriate diagnosis, care, public health interventions and policy, and resource
planning.

The existing evidence base shows large variations in estimates of PCS prevalence and incidence due
to differences in study populations, recruitment methods, follow-up periods, and sample sizes. Most
studies to date have concentrated on symptoms associated with PCS rather than organ impairment,
and few have made use of a control group permitting the inference of counterfactual outcomes.
Therefore, using national electronic health records and death registrations for individuals in England,
we quantified the incidence of mortality, health service utilisation, and organ-specific impairment
following discharge from hospital with COVID-19. We estimated rate ratios of post-discharge adverse
events compared with those in a matched control group, and heterogeneity in this rate ratio across
demographic groups.

Methods
Study design and data sources
This was an observational, retrospective, matched cohort study of individuals in hospital with COVID19 using Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) Admitted Patient Care (APC) records for England until 31
August 2020. The study also utilised the General Practice Extraction Service (GPES) Data for
Pandemic Planning and Research (GDPPR) dataset, an extract of approximately 35,000 clinical
codes for over 56 million individuals registered at General Practices in England, until 30 September
2020. Death registrations data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) were linked for deaths
until 30 September 2020 and registered by 7 October 2020.

Study population
Individuals with COVID-19 were included in the study if they had a hospital episode starting from 1
January 2020 and ending by 31 August 2020 with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19, identified using
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD10) codes U07.1 (virus identified) and U07.2 (virus not identified); that is, by a positive laboratory test
or clinical diagnosis. Individuals with COVID-19 were excluded if they had not been discharged alive
by 31 August 2020 or had an unknown date of birth and/or sex. The index date was set to date of
discharge following the first hospital episode with COVID-19 as the primary diagnosis.

Candidate controls comprised individuals who: (i) did not meet the COVID-19 inclusion criteria
specified above; (ii) had at least one GDPPR record between 1 January 2019 (one year before the
start of the follow-up period) and 30 September 2020 (the end-of-study date); and (iii) had not died
before 1 January 2020. Each control had the same index date as their matched COVID-19 case.

Outcome variables
All individuals were followed-up from index date to 30 September 2020 or date of death (whichever
was earlier) for the following adverse events: all-cause mortality; hospital readmission for any reason;
respiratory disease; major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE, a composite of heart failure [HF],
myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, and arrhythmia); diabetes (type 1 or 2); chronic kidney disease
(CKD) stages 3-5 (including dialysis and kidney transplant); and chronic liver disease (CLD).

Respiratory, MACE, diabetes, CKD and CLD events were identified from diagnoses made in primary
care and in hospital (using only primary ICD-10 codes for the latter), except for the arrythmia
component of MACE for which primary care data were not available.

Matching variables
COVID-19 cases were matched to controls on baseline demographic and clinical characteristics that
may confound the relationship between COVID-19 and outcomes (Supplementary Table 1),
established over the ten-year look-back period 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2019. Comorbidities
were identified from diagnoses made in primary care and in hospital (using both primary and
secondary ICD-10 codes for the latter).

Statistical techniques
Distributions of baseline characteristics were compared between individuals with COVID-19 and a
random 0.5% sample of the general population using Chi squared tests and standardised differences
in proportions, where a standardised difference in excess of 10% was taken as evidence of large
imbalance between the groups.[17]

COVID-19 cases and controls were matched using exact 1:1 matching. Matched pairs were discarded
if the control died before the corresponding COVID-19 case’s index date. All covariates were
discretised prior to matching, including an ‘Unknown’ category comprising individuals with missing
values.

We computed rates of adverse events per 1,000 person-years of exposure time in COVID-19 cases
and controls, and derived rate ratios contrasting these event rates, to estimate the ‘average treatment
effect on the treated.’ 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the Poisson distribution.

We estimated events rates for the full study population firstly by using all adverse events, and
secondly by considering only new-onset cases (that is, where the individual did not have a diagnosis
for the condition over the ten-year look-back period). All-diagnoses event rates were stratified by sex,
coarse age group (<70 years, ≥70 years), and coarse ethnic group (White, Non-White). In secondary
analysis, individuals with COVID-19 were stratified according to whether they were admitted to an
intensive care unit (ICU) during their hospital spell as a measure of disease severity. All statistical
analyses were conducted using R version 4.0.2.

Results
Study participants
Of 86,955 individuals in hospital with COVID-19 during the study period, 53,795 (61.9%) had been
discharged alive by end-of-study (Figure 1). After excluding individuals with unknown age or sex and
those who could not be matched to a control, 47,780 COVID-19 cases (4,745 ICU and 43,035 nonICU) were included in the analysis, representing 90.8% of those discharged alive with known age and
sex. Mean follow-up times were 140 days (standard deviation [SD] 50 days, maximum 253 days) for
COVID-19 cases and 153 days (SD 33 days, maximum 253 days) for controls.

At baseline, individuals with COVID-19 had a mean age of 64.5 years (SD 19.2 years) and 54.9%
were male. Compared with the general population, individuals in hospital with COVD-19 were more
likely to be aged ≥50 years, male, living in a deprived area, a former smoker, and overweight or obese
(Table 1). Individuals with COVID-19 were also more likely to be comorbid than the general
population, with a higher prevalence of prior hospitalisation and all measured pre-existing conditions
(most notably hypertension, MACE, respiratory disease and diabetes).

Rates of adverse events in individuals with COVID-19 following discharge
Of 47,780 individuals in hospital with COVID-19 over the study period, 29.4% were re-admitted and
12.3% died following discharge (Table 2). These events occurred at rates of 766 (CI: 753 to 779)
readmissions and 320 (312 to 328) deaths per 1,000 person-years, which were 3.5 (3.4 to 3.6) and
7.7 (7.2 to 8.3) times greater, respectively, than those in matched controls. Respiratory disease was
diagnosed in 14,140 individuals (29.6%) following discharge, with 6,085 of these being new-onset
cases; the resulting event rates of 770 (758 to 783) and 539 (525 to 553) per 1,000 person-years,
respectively, were 6.0 (5.7 to 6.2) and 27.3 (24.0 to 31.2) times greater than those in controls.

Post-discharge diagnoses of diabetes, MACE, CKD and CLD were made for 4.9%, 4.8%, 1.5% and
0.3% of individuals with COVID-19, respectively, occurring at rates of 127 (122 to 132) diabetes, 126
(121 to 131) MACE, 39 (36 to 42) CKD and 7 (6 to 9) CLD events per 1,000 person-years (Figure 2).
A similar pattern was observed when only new-onset cases were considered, but at lower rates of 29
(26 to 32) diabetes, 66 (62 to 70) MACE, 15 (13 to 17) CKD and 4 (3 to 5) CLD events per 1,000
person-years. Those with COVID-19 received post-discharge diagnoses of MACE, CLD, CKD and
diabetes 3.0 (2.7 to 3.2), 2.8 (2.0 to 4.0), 1.9 (1.7 to 2.1) and 1.5 (1.4 to 1.6) times more frequently,
respectively, than in the matched control group. See Supplementary Table 2 for detailed results.

In secondary analysis, rates of post-discharge adverse events remained significantly elevated among
individuals with COVID-19 compared with matched controls after stratifying by ICU versus non-ICU
admission (Supplementary Table 3). Individuals requiring ICU admission experienced greater rates of
post-discharge respiratory disease and diabetes than those not in ICU, but the opposite was true for
rates of death, readmission and MACE.

Rate ratios of adverse events across demographic characteristics
Rates of all post-discharge adverse events were greater in individuals with COVID-19 aged ≥70 years
than <70 years, while rates of all events other than diabetes were greater in the White ethnic group
than the Non-White group (Supplementary Table 4). However, the rate ratio of adverse events
(contrasting COVID-19 cases and matched controls) was greater in individuals aged <70 years than
≥70 years for all event types (Figure 3), with the biggest differences in rate ratios being observed for
death (14.1 [11.0 to 18.3] for <70 years versus 7.7 [7.1 to 8.3] for ≥70 years) and respiratory disease
(10.5 [9.7 to 11.4] for <70 years versus 4.6 [4.3 to 4.8] for ≥70 years). Ethnic differences in rate ratios

were most pronounced for respiratory disease, at 11.4 (9.8 to 13.3) for individuals in the Non-White
group compared with 5.2 (5.0 to 5.5) in the White group. Differences in rate ratios of adverse events
between males and females were generally small. See Supplementary Table 4 for detailed results.

Discussion
Principal findings
In the largest study to-date to examine PCS in individuals hospitalised with COVID-19, comprising
47,780 COVID-19 cases with matched controls, we describe three major findings. Firstly, COVID-19
hospitalisation was associated with increased risk of readmission and death following discharge,
relative to that in individuals of similar demographic and clinical profiles over the same period; nearly
a third of people post COVID-19 hospital discharge were re-admitted and more than 1 in 10 died.

Secondly, rates of post-discharge multi-organ dysfunction were elevated in individuals with COVID-19
compared with those in the matched control group, suggesting extrapulmonary pathophysiology.
Diabetes and MACE were particularly common, both when considering all post-discharge events
(which may reflect a combination of new-onset cases and exasperation of pre-existing conditions) and
only incident cases.
Finally, the absolute risk of post-discharge adverse events was greater for individuals aged ≥70 years
than <70 years, and for individuals of White ethnic background than in the Non-White group.
However, when contrasted against the background rates of adverse events that might be expected to
occur in these groups in the general population, younger and ethnic minority individuals faced greater
relative risks than those aged ≥70 years and those in the White group, respectively.

Comparison with related studies
Our results are consistent with hypothesised biological mechanisms associated with respiratory,[18]
cardiovascular,[19] metabolic,[20] renal,[10] and hepatic[8] involvement in COVID-19, and extend the
early evidence base surrounding PCS which has been described as being “limited” and generally of
low quality.[21]

In a more recent study of 1,775 US veterans hospitalised with COVID-19, 20% were readmitted and
9% died within 60 days of discharge;[22] after restricting follow-up time in our study to the same
duration, we found similar prevalence rates of 23% and 9%, respectively. The US study did not
analyse organ-specific endpoints and was conducted in a specific population; we can thus now add
that COVID-19 is associated with post-discharge manifestations in a range of organs in the general
population.

Multi-organ involvement following COVID-19 infection was detected in 201 low-risk individuals in the
UK (18% hospitalised with COVID-19), with impairment of the lungs (33%), heart (32%), kidneys
(12%) and liver (10%) found to be common.[23] These prevalence rates are higher than those
estimated in our study, though the degree of organ impairment was generally found to be mild and
therefore likely to be subclinical.

In a case series of 213 discharged individuals with COVID-19 in the US, 10% were re-admitted and
2% died over a median follow-up time of 80 days,[24] compared with our much greater estimates of
29% and 12%, respectively (but over a longer median follow-up time of 160 days). However, the small
sample size precludes extrapolation to broader populations.

COVID-19 was associated with increased odds of acute kidney injury, renal replacement therapy,
insulin use, pulmonary embolism, stroke, myocarditis, arrythmia, and elevated troponin in US
veterans hospitalised with COVID-19 versus a control of seasonal influenza.[25] The index event was
admission rather than discharge, so the results do not necessarily capture long-term outcomes of
COVID-19, but they are indicative of physiological changes in multiple organs at the acute phase of
the disease and therefore support our own findings.

Pulmonary lesions were found in hospitalised COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, though only at a
short follow-up duration of three weeks post-discharge.[26] Cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) imaging revealed myocardial inflammation in German participants who recovered from acute
COVID-19,[6] while myocarditis was also detected by CMR imaging in post-acute US college
athletes.[27] These studies are suggestive of pulmonary and myocardial involvement in individuals
with COVID-19 and, although small sample sizes and highly specific study populations make it difficult
to generalise the results, they shed some light on possible pathophysiological mechanisms that
underly our own findings.

Implications of findings
With over 3 million people in the UK having tested positive for COVID-19 at the time of writing,[28]
and many more who had the disease but never received a test, our findings suggest that the longterm burden of COVID-related morbidity on hospitals and broader healthcare systems is likely to be
substantial. PCS comes on a backdrop of healthcare challenges, particularly sustainable high-quality
care for long-term conditions: inequalities in health, access and provision; incomplete pathways
across community and hospital care; inadequate research translation to clinical practice; and
insufficient resources. Our findings across organ systems suggest that the diagnosis, treatment and
prevention of PCS will require integrated rather than organ- or disease-specific approaches.
Integrated care pathways are structured, multidisciplinary care plans for specific conditions,[29] which
have been effective in other diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and may have
utility in the management of PCS.

Strengths and limitations
The main strength of our study lies in its size and completeness, as it includes all individuals in
England in hospital with COVID-19 observed over a follow-up period of up to several months. Use of
a matched control group allowed rates of post-discharge adverse events in individuals with COVID-19
to be compared against counterfactual outcomes – what might have been observed given the
background risk in these individuals.

Like all observational studies, we cannot rule out the possibility of residual confounding (for example,
due to biomarkers or socio-economic exposures omitted from our matching set) which precludes our
ability to draw definitive causal conclusions. The limited number of events in the control group meant
we were unable to disaggregate rate ratios stratified by age and ethnicity beyond broad ‘<70 years
verses ≥70 years’ and ‘White versus Non-White’ comparisons, despite the likelihood of heterogeneity
in outcomes within these groups. The threshold for hospital admission may be lower among
individuals with a recent history of COVID-19 than in the general population, and rates of diagnoses in
general may have decreased as an indirect result of the pandemic, particularly among people who
were not admitted to hospital with COVID-19. We did not have access to testing data and thus were
unable to remove individuals infected with COVID-19 who did not require hospitalisation from our
control group. Moreover, our results are unlikely to fully capture the lived experience of individuals
living with PCS who were possibly asymptomatic and untested at the time of infection. Multi-organ
manifestations beyond the acute phase of COVID-19 infection have been identified in nonhospitalised individuals,[23] who were beyond the scope of our study, and we did not capture
symptoms such as fatigue, disturbance of taste and smell, and anxiety, which have been widely
reported by individuals with suspected PCS.[21]

Conclusions
Individuals discharged from hospital following acute COVID-19 face elevated rates of mortality,
readmission and multi-organ dysfunction compared with the background levels that exist for these
individuals, and the relative increase in risk is neither confined to the elderly nor uniform across ethnic
groups. Urgent research is required to further understand the risk factors for PCS, so that treatment
provision can be better targeted to demographically and clinically at-risk populations.

Table notes: CI: confidence interval; CKD: chronic kidney disease stages 3-5; MACE: major adverse
cardiovascular event. Adverse events calculated from hospital episodes to 31 August 2020, and primary care
records and deaths registrations to 30 September 2020. COVID-19 cases were matched to controls on baseline
demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, region, Index of Multiple Deprivation quintile, smoking status)
and clinical histories (hypertension, major adverse cardiovascular event, respiratory disease, chronic kidney
disease, chronic liver disease, diabetes, cancer). ). Rates and rate ratios for CKD could not be stratified by ethnic
group due to insufficient event counts in the control group.
