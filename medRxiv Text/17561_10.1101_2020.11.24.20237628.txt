Significance
The measured intensity of light can reveal information about different cellular parameters under study.
When light passes through a bio-composition, the intensity is associated with its content. The nuclei
size, cell shape and the refractive index variation of cells contributes to light intensity. In this work, an
optical label-free real time detection method incorporating the smartphone light source and a portable
mini spectrometer for SARS-CoV-2 detection was developed based on the ability of its spike protein to
interact with the ACE2 receptor. The light interactions with control and viral protein solutions were
capable of providing a quick decision regarding whether the sample under test was positive or negative,
thus enabling SARS-CoV-2 detection in a rapid manner.

Abstract
This study proposes a novel optical method of detecting and reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the
virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic that is sweeping the world today.

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to

the β-coronaviruses characterized by the crown-shaped spike protein that protrudes out of the virus
particles, giving the virus a “corona” shape; hence the name coronavirus.

The technique being proposed uses a light source from a smart phone and a mobile spectrophotometer
to enable detection of viral proteins in solution or paper as well as protein-protein interactions.

The

proof-of-concept is shown by detecting soluble preparations of spike protein subunits from SARS-CoV-2,
followed by detection of the actual binding potential of the spike protein with its host receptor, the
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

The results are validated by showing that this method can

detect antigen-antibody binding using two independent viral protein-antibody pairs. The binding could
be detected optically both in solution and on a solid support such as nitrocellulose membrane.

this technique is combined with DC bias to show that introduction of a current into the system can be

Introduction
The world is currently facing the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the appearance of a novel coronavirus

1

in the human population towards the end of 2019 .

Within only a few months, this virus had spread to

most countries of the world, infecting millions (> 21 million as of Aug. 17 2020) and causing > 770,000

2

deaths .

Unfortunately, the complete clinical picture of COVID-19 is not yet fully known and most likely

depends upon a number of factors, including both the virus as well as the host characteristics. Successful
detection of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) plays an important role in stopping its spread. At the
moment, oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs are primarily used for virus detection. However, it is
not clear how many virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 are needed to trigger an infection. It is also not clear
whether

since

asymptomatic individuals and patients with COVID-19 symptoms can demonstrate similar viral loads

It

has been estimated that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a higher rate of virus replication compared to SARS-CoV-1,

4

which can increase disease transmissibility . Statistically, confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide are 100

5

times higher than the confirmed cases of SARS and MERS .

This is because, 1) SARS-CoV-2 replicates at

much higher levels in the nose and mouth than SARS and MERS, and 2) this leads to much higher levels
of virus shedding in the environment by people who are either pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic. Thus,

procedure that takes long processing times over days for results .

Several other molecular assays have

been developed to detect SARS-CoV-2, such as enzyme-based assays like ELISAs, and rapid tests that aim

4

to detect either antibodies against the virus or the viral antigen themselves . Nevertheless, most of
these antigen-antibody-based assays have failed quality control due to their rapid development without
proper testing and result in either false negative or false positive detection due to the long time it takes

9

to develop serum responses to the viral infection (from days to weeks) . Thus, most of the methods
used so far either require skilled manpower and are time consuming if accurate, or not reliable at all, if
fast. On the other hand, biosensor technology provides excellent sensitivity, but have their own caveats.
For example, some biosensors require metal coating deposited on the device, thereby raising cost

In this study, we demonstrate the use of a light-based method to detect SARS-CoV-2 and potentially
disrupt its binding ability with its receptor, rendering the virus non-infectious by combining optical
detection with electric current.

Results and discussions
Experimental Design: The experimental setup utilized in this study is shown in Fig. 2(a), incorporating a
mini spectrometer and a smart mobile phone that was employed as a light source with its power

wavelength of 623 nm

This experimental setup was first used to characterize the two spike proteins subunits, S1 and S2 that
are encoded by all coronaviruses and, as mentioned, allow virus entry into susceptible cells (Fig. 1(b)).
Figure 3(a) shows the optical responses for both proteins along with their corresponding blank samples.
The measured optical intensity changed from 600 to 750 nm, within the light source spectrum measured
earlier in Fig. 2(b). The response of the blank samples was performed first, followed by the two protein
suspensions, the responses to which were recorded individually as shown in Fig. 3(a).

path versus loaded mass. All optical responses were measured at 623 nm. Light intensity was measured as
arbitrary units (a.u).

Figure 3(a) reveals that S2 exhibited a higher “back scattering” and/or absorbance than S1. The response
of the two blank samples was quite comparable, showing the reproducibility of the results.

Since the

maximum difference between the blank and the two protein samples was observed at 623 nm, this
wavelength was chosen for further experimentation, which is also the wavelength at which the optical
power of the smart phone is at its maximum.

Optimization of the Sample Reading Conditions:

Initial test of this experimental setup revealed that it

had one major drawback; i.e., when samples were loaded into the holder, the angle and position of the
microcentrifuge tube changed which affected the results obtained. To ensure that the results were
reproducible, the measurements for the same samples were conducted over different days and on each
day the setup was standardized since the position of the mobile phone, spectrometer and samples could
vary.

be added after ~ 100 mSecond, while keeping the measurement mode on.

Figure 3(b) illustrates the

corresponding measurement profile for S1B and S2B individual samples suspended in water over time.
Initially, a fluctuation in the light intensity was observed with time as each sample was added to the
tube, but then it stabilized with time. As expected, the blank exhibited the maximum measured light
intensity, while the suspended samples showed lower light intensity than the blank once stabilized.

Test of the Spike Proteins Using the Proposed Experimental Set Up:

To test the proof-of-principle,

initially a mixing experiment was conducted at a light wavelength of 623 nm.

Towards this end, 250 μL

of S1B protein solution was tested at the same maximum concentration at 5,000 copies/mL followed by
addition of same amount of S2B. Figure 3(c) shows the light intensity (as arbitrary units, a.u.) with time
as the protein samples were added to the transparent measurement container in a sequential manner.
This was followed by addition of 250 μL of ten-fold serial dilutions of the S2 protein at equal time
intervals to the S1B + S2B samples. As can be seen from Fig. 3(c), with the addition of the S2 protein, the
light intensity increased.

The biggest increase was observed with the concentrated S2B sample followed

by its ten-fold dilution samples S2C, S2D, S2E, etc., until S2F addition as a 1:10,000 dilution had no extra
effect on the increase in light intensity, revealing the limit of detection of the assay (5000 molecules per
mL x 250 µl x 1/10,000 = 125 molecule per mL). These results reveal that the ratio between the S1 and
S2 protein concentration plays an important role in the light intensity levels measured. The ratio of S1
and S2 in the virus is the same since both originate from the cleavage of S protein.

However, the S1

subunit is expressed on the cell surface, while the S2 subunit is embedded in the lipid bilayer of the cell
membrane; therefore, S2 is less available at the cells surface, which should affect light intensity less than
S1 despite equal ratios. Table 1 lists the extracted parameters at specific time points. The relative
change in light intensity per light path length is a constructed parameter that should correlate with the
loaded mass (concentration) of the protein in a suspension.

Test of Binding Interactions between Spike and ACE2 Using the Optical Assay:

After

successful

demonstration that our set up could detect spike proteins in solution using light, we asked if light
intensity could be used to characterize the binding interactions of the spike protein with the viral
receptor ACE2.

Towards this end, two different variants of the S1 subunit of the spike protein, S1X and

S1Y were tested (one form that could bind ACE2 with a much stronger affinity than the other one), along
with a non-specific control protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA) that should not bind to ACE2. These
proteins were selected to demonstrate the detection of the binding process with ACE2 over time. The
measurement process started with the blank, and after 200 seconds, 250 μL of ACE2 protein suspension
was tested (Fig. 5(a)). This process was repeated for S1X, S1Y, and BSA and their responses to light were
measured individually in the same manner as ACE2. The corresponding individual profiles of ACE2, S1X,
S1Y and BSA are depicted in Fig. 5(a) which showed a straight constant line over time.

Next, each

protein was mixed with the ACE2 separately to detect any possible binding effect. The measurements
started with first loading the ACE2 in the blank container, then after 200 ms, the test protein was added
to the ACE2 in solution.

The responses of the various protein mixtures were read over a period of 15

minutes and are shown in Fig. 5(b).

Figure 5(b) shows the corresponding slopes that represent the change of the light intensities over time.
The ACE2+BSA and ACE2+S1Y responses exhibited almost constant lines, suggesting highly reduced or
lack of any interaction as observed when the proteins were tested individually Figure 5(a). However, the
ACE2+S1X profile showed a linear straight line with the maximum-recorded slope. The corresponding
light intensity line increased over time, suggesting an interaction between the SIX protein and the ACE2
receptor. We interpret this to mean that there was no protein-protein interaction if the slope of the line
was zero; otherwise protein-protein interaction occurred. Based on these observations, our results
suggest that the S1X protein exhibits stronger interactions with ACE2, while BSA and S1Y had weaker
interactions with ACE2.

These observations are confirmed by the fact that whereas S1X has a higher

affinity for ACE2 (2 µg/mL S1X can bind 1.5-15 ng/mL ACE2), while S1Y reportedly has a much lower
affinity (2 µg/mL S1B binds 0.5-8.7 ng/mL ACE2), as tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(ELISA) by the company that synthesized these proteins

measurement time between the two proteins was extended over one hour, the results of which are
plotted in Fig. 5(c). As can be seen, a nice “hump” was observed as an increase in arbitrary units (a.u.)
with time that was not observed in the other protein mixtures tested which we feel is indicative of the
binding reaction between the two proteins.

Validation of the Optical Assay Using Known Antigen/Antibody Pairs:

Next, we wanted to confirm our

observations by using our optical system to detect protein-protein interactions using proteins that are
well known to interact with each other.

This was addressed by testing the molecular interactions

between an antigen and an antibody which is similar to the interaction between the spike protein and
its receptor.

Towards this end, two proteins were tested along with their specific antibodies:

the first

protein was the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its antibody and the
other was the nucleocapsid protein (NCP) of SARS-CoV-2 and its antibody.

Similar to the procedure

described earlier, the two proteins were tested individually in our optical assay followed by addition of
their corresponding antibodies that were mixed and then tested for their interactions.

Figure 6(a) shows the binding between RBD and its antibody. Upon the addition of the antibody, as
observed earlier, an “interaction peak” was recorded that is circled in blue color. Similarly, Figure 6(b)
shows the binding between NCP and its antibody. However, in this case, we realized that the binding

concentration and once the interaction had taken place, no further interaction took place. For a virusbased suspension, it is therefore suggested to use a fixed antibody concentration and serially dilute the
virus suspension to conduct the binding measurements. Certainly, at a specific virus concentration,
binding effect will appear in the form of an optical response.

Figure 6(c) and (d) illustrate the corresponding optical responses for NC protein and its corresponding
antibody when they were mixed either inside (Fig. 6(c)) or outside (Fig. 6(d)) the microcentrifuge tube,
respectively. Inside mixing means that the protein was added to the tube and the antibody was added
after 10 seconds, while in the outside mixing scenario, both the protein and antibody were mixed prior
to being loaded in the tube for optical measurements. As can be seen, the binding response could be
detected in each case in the form of appearance of the hump.

sequentially.

This is good news for the real-life scenario where in a patient sample, the antibody should

be already bound to the viral or bacterial antigen at the time of detection.

After 20

seconds, the antibody suspension was loaded on the membrane and measurements were conducted up
to 100 seconds.

Next, the spike protein sample was loaded and measurements were continued up to

500 seconds. As revealed from Fig. 7(b), the interaction peak clearly appeared as circled in blue. It is
worth noting that the membrane size, shape, and charge of biomolecules, pH and viscosity of the
control buffer, as well as the composition influences the corresponding optical response and binding
interactions and must be carefully standardized

Role of Electric Current in Disrupting Protein-Protein Interactions:

Finally, we studied the effect of

direct current (DC biasing) on the ability of two proteins to bind specifically.

This was achieved by

subjecting the NC protein solution to DC voltage bias, as depicted in Fig. 8(a). An applied bias should
result in an induction of current across the suspension. If this current is high enough, it should have the
potential to destroy the protein physiology and functionality, resulting in the loss of specific proteinprotein interactions. To test this hypothesis, the NC protein solution was loaded in an electroporation
cuvette (rather than a microcentrifuge tube) that incorporates two electrodes with a volume of 0.5 mL
and a separation distance of 0.4 cm. This should result in a breakdown electric field of 7.5 V/cm.

At this

field onwards, the binding between the protein and the antibody should be affected. Above this field,
the sample should be incapacitated for binding. Figure 8(a) reveals that the optical response decays

The breakdown field depends on the electrical characteristics of both the buffer and the analyte such as
proteins, viruses, etc. To explore this further, the suspension of protein was subjected to 3 V for 1
minute and then the antibody to NC was added to the NC protein solution. The corresponding measured
response is shown in Fig. 8(b). The measured response was observed to be noisy and did not show a
clear binding effect when compared with Fig. 6(c) that reported the optical response for the same
protein and antibody without the application of DC bias. It is worth mentioning that it may be possible

Discussion
This study establishes the proof-of-principle that optical methods can be used to detect specific SARSCoV-2 spike proteins or their subunits (S, S1, & S2) as well as their interactions with the ACE2 receptor in
solution, whenever present (Figs. 3 & 5).

The principle was further validated by testing specific protein-

protein interactions by testing two viral protein-antibody pairs (RBD and NC proteins with their specific
antibodies) and testing them either in solution (Figs. 6) or on a solid matrix (Fig. 7). Finally, it was shown
that application of a weak current into the system could lead to the disruption of NC protein-antibody
interactions which could be optically detected (Fig. 8). In other words, our technique could be used not
only to detect specific SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-receptor interactions, but also result in destruction of
protein interactions important for virus replication; thus, inhibiting rate of infection.

The time slot denoted by (i) represents the time just before the interaction

occurs. As the interaction starts, the corresponding optical profile ascends incrementally as indicated by
(ii) due to the increase in binding events, releasing more photons energy. The peak pointed by (iii)
occurs at the maximum event of binding between antigens and their antibodies. The height of the peaks
indicates stronger interactions and

vice versa.

time to maximum peak reflects the speed of the binding interactions; thus, the earlier the peak appears,
the faster the binding interaction takes place.

As can be seen in Fig. 9, the speed of NC protein binding

to its antibody took place between 100 and 1000 seconds irrespective of the dilution of the proteins.

Figure 9: Optical profiles for normalized interactions versus binding time under different conditions for RBD and
NCP. (a) NCP with its antibody at the maximum concentration of 22 μg per ml (b) RBD with its antibody, (c) NCP
with its antibody at a 1:10 dilution (d) NCP with its antibody at 1:10 with outside mixing.
Next, we analyzed the interaction profiles of these samples further by fitting them to Gaussian function.
Table 2 lists their corresponding fitting parameters. The most important parameters are the width and
the maximum peak amplitude. Base and center parameters represent the offset level and the maximum
peak location, respectively. These two parameters provide minor information and could be set to fixed
values such as zero in all profiles. The multiplication of the maximum amplitude with its corresponded
width can be utilized as an indicator to describe the speed of interaction. This “indicator” has been listed
in Table 2, last row. Accordingly,NCP2 exhibited the fastest binding, while NCP3 exhibited the slowest
binding with the arrangement from fast to slow being as follows: NCP2, NCP1, RBD, and NCP3.

to integrate the portable sensor and the smart phone as well. The concept of strips can be further used
to detect different specimens taken from blood, breath, urine, nasal swabs, stool, etc. For example, the
subject can breathe, exhale, or sniff into a device with a probe coated with antibodies. If binding occurs,
the integrated device should be able to pick up the interaction, confirming that the patient is infected
with the virus to which the antibodies are directed against.

The current methodology provides a rapid, reproducible and accurate detection mechanism that can be
used to create home-based COVID-19 detection tests that can be used by anyone. The authors envision
that such tests would not require any laboratory setting, and could be performed using test strips
coated with antibodies without prior sample processing. Interestingly, our approach does not require
any electrode patterning which makes it the best fit for massive production and high-volume use. It can
be adapted as a point-of-care testing platform with high-throughput to be used in schools, airports,
malls and public services places as well. The cost per test is expected to be less than one dollar which
will make it competitive with current market price. The detection platform can be easily equipped with
standard electronic data transmission systems to transmit and process data in place and share it with

Conclusions:

In summary, this study provides the proof-of-principle for an optical-based, quick, simple,

and sensitive screening technology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.

It is based on the principle that

when light passes through a sample, interactions between the photons and sample occurs within a
specific range of frequencies. The current approach utilizes a smartphone light source and a portable
mini-spectrophotometer to convert the variations in light intensity into measured signal. The optical
detection exhibited high sensitivity towards selected SARS-CoV-2 proteins with a low detection limit
which was five times more sensitive than published real time quantitative PCR assays. The optical
responses could further be analyzed using the principle component analysis technique to enhance and
allows precise detection of the specific target in a multi-protein mixture. This approach can be further
developed to accommodate mass screening that should provide fast and accurate positive or negative
test results.
