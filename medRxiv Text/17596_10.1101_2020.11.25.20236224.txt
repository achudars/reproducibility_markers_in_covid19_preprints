Abstract
Background: COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is among the
most obscure global pandemics resulting in diverse health and economic disruptions. It adversely
affects the routine health care delivery and health service uptake by patients. However, its impact
on care-seeking behaviour is largely unknown in Ethiopia.
Objective: This study was to determine the impact of the pandemic on care-seeking behaviour of
patients with chronic health condition at Tikur Anbessa Specialized hospital in Addis Ababa.
Methods: A cross-sectional hospital-based survey conducted between May and July 2020 on
patients whose appointment was between March to June 2020. Sample of 750 patients were
approached using phone call and data collection was done using a pretested questionnaire. After
cleaning, the data entered in to IBM SPSS software package for analysis.
Results:
A total of 644 patients with a median age of 25 years, and M: F ratio of 1:1.01 was described
with a response rate of 86%. A loss to follow up, missed medication and death occurred in 70%,
12%, and 1.3% of the patients respectively. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis,
patients above 60 years old were more likely to miss follow-up (OR-23.28 (9.32-58.15), P<001).
Patients who reported fear of COVID-19 at the hospital were 19 times more likely to miss
follow-up (adjusted OR=19.32, 95% CI:10.73-34.79, P<0.001), while patients who reported
transportation problems were 6.5 times more likely to miss follow-up (adjusted OR=6.11, 95%
CI:3.06-12.17, P<0.001).

Conclusions: COVID-19 pandemic affected the care-seeking behaviour of patients with chronic
medical condition adversely and the impact was more pronounced among patients with severe
disease, fear of COVID19 and with transportation problems. Education on preventive measures
of COVID-19, use of phone clinic and improving chronic illness services at the local health
institutions may reduce loss to follow-up among these patients.

Keywords: COVID-19, coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, Health seeking behaviour, chronic illness

What is already known?
As a result of COVID-19, an essential maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH)
services in Addis Ababa city showed that first antenatal attendance and under-five
pneumonia treatment decreased by 12 and 35% .
A drop in client flow was ascribed to fear of acquiring COVID-19 at health facilities,
limited access due to movement restrictions, and dedication of health facilities as
COVID-19 treatment centers.
What are the new findings?
A cross-sectional hospital-based telephone survey indicated that a loss to follow up,
missed medication and death occurred in 70%, 12%, and 1.3% of patients with chronic
medical conditions respectively.
What do the new findings imply?
Fear of COVID-19 and transportation problems are the most commonly stated reasons
thus, the finding implies that since health care services to patients with chronic medical
conditions is concentrated in specialized referral hospitals mostly aggregated in big cities,
patients who travel long distance to get the service are at high risk of Loss to follow up.
Strengthening the chronic care service at a local health institutions, and promoting
COVD-19 preventive measures, may help decrease the LTFU and associated
complications.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease19 (COVID-19) has originated first in China Wuhan Hubei province as a
health crisis that struck the global community causing dismal repercussions. It begun late
December 2020, when China reported a cluster of pneumonia-like diseases in a family setting,
SARS-CoV-2 has spread fast all over the world to involve over 200 countries, making itself a
pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) notified COVID-19 as pandemic on March
12, 2020(1, 2). Ethiopia had the first COVID-19 positive case confirmed on March 13th, 2020
(3). At this time, the government declared a state of emergency labeling the pandemic as a
national threat and launched overall preventive measures including advising the community to
stay at home, practice strict and frequent hand washing and wearing a face mask. The
government also restricted the movement of its people from place to place and laid temporary
restrictions in market places, restaurants, shops, cinema houses, religious gatherings and other
meetings. There was also a temporary restriction on public transport across-regions and cities
(4). During this time, the number of hospital visits dropped sharply at least in large hospitals like
Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH). For example, the number of patients who visited
the pediatric outpatient and chronic care clinic dropped by 30-70% in April.

Evidence from countries with previous epidemics has revealed that people lose trust in the
healthcare system and develop a fear of getting the disease in a health facility. Thus, they avoid
seeking treatment for their illness or sending a loved one for medical care, the consequences of
which may be increased mortality (5).

Factors like distance from a service center were reported to have a significant association with a
reduction in the utilization of the health service delivery during influenza pandemic. Similarly,
disease severity was reported to have an association with more health-seeking behavior amongst
individuals with influenza-like illness (6, 7). Specific factors predicting the loss to follow up
(LTFU) and its consequence in the current pandemic at a tertiary care center were not yet
reported in the region to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, the study aimed to assess the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care seeking behavior of patients in the chronic
care clinics.

Patients and Methods
Study design: A facility-based cross-sectional telephone survey conducted from May and July
2020, among patients who had an appointment between Mid-March and Mid-June 2020 at
Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH). TASH is the government-funded hospital located
in Addis Ababa, which for the last 48 years has served the community as a national referral
center. There are several specialty and sub-speciality clinics for the care of chronically ill
patients with over half a million patients are visiting annually. The hospital has 700 beds, 1021
doctors (faculties and postgraduate trainees), 379 nurses, 115 other health professionals and 950
permanent and contract administrative staff dedicated to providing health care services (8). The
study was conducted with in several speciality clinics mainly in the pediatric and adult chronic
care units. The average monthly Pediatric Neurology, Cardiac, Renal, Gastrointestinal, Chest,
Infectious disease (PID), High-risk infant, and Rheumatology clinics visits before the pandemic
were 620, 510, 129,100, 60, 300, 230, and 18 patients respectively. The respective figure for
adult Neurology, Cardiac, Renal, Gastrointestinal (GI), Chest, Infectious disease(ID) and
Rheumatology clinics, was 1307,1653, 565,785,521, 1082 and 343 in respective order.

Majority of the patients used to take lifelong medications uninterrupted or discontinued.
Qualified Doctors ranging from consultants to resident doctors run these clinics on regular basis.
The hospital renders service to patients based on a different payment system including, Free
(13.5%), out of pocket payment (78.4%), Insurance system (6.1%), post-payment (1.9%) and
subsidized payment system (0.1%) respectively (8). Since the occurrence of COVID-19, TASH
has introduced phone clinics as one mitigation strategy to reach patients who might have missed
their appointment and to manage those at risk of COVID-19 while they were at home.
Source population: adult and pediatric patients with chronic illness having regular follow up at
TASH.
Study population:-adult and pediatric patients with chronic illness having scheduled follow up
between March 15 and mid of June 2020.
Inclusion criteria: patients and caretakers with chronic illness having scheduled follow up
appointment during the study period were included.

Exclusion criteria: Patients and caretakers who did not volunteer to participate and the profile of
those who were lost to follow up or died before COVID-19 pandemics were excluded.
Sample size
Sample size was calculated using a single population proportion formula based on a 50%
prevalence estimate of the loss to follow-up of patients in the hospital at 95% confidence level,
4% precision and 20% non-response rate. Accordingly, the sample size required for the study
was 750 patients.
Sampling frame
Sample size was distributed proportionally to each clinic based on the caseload of the specific
units. Health management information system (either electronic or registration book) were used
to prepare both appointed and attended patients separately. By dividing the allocated sample size
number to the total number of patients appointed for the study period gave us the sampling
interval. First case was selected using simple random number and using the sampling frame we
continued counting until the desired sample size was obtained. by identifying the card numbers
and mobile phone numbers of the selected cases, participants were approached for their consent.
Independent variables includes: - age, sex, address, patient diagnosis, severity of illness, type of
treatment, and year of follow up at TASH. These were extracted from the paper-based chart of
the patients. Mobile interview was made to get information’s on patient treatment cost,
occupation, parental education, monthly income, means of transport, patient choice to attend
their follow up, and whether the telephone call was received or not. Dependent variables were
LTFU, missed medications, reasons LTFU, worsening of symptoms, alternative measures taken
by patients/caretakers, and the role of local pharmacies and local government health institutions.
Data collection
A one-day training was given for general practitioners and residents on the use of the data
collection tool. Thenafter, demographic and clinical data were abstracted from the charts, to be
supplimented by mobile interview. The tool on to which data were collected was adopted, piloted
and modified on a group of 20 patients before it was used for data collection. The information
gathered from this piloted group were not included in the analysis. In this study, LTFU was
defined as any number of missed appointments before the beginning of the study and after the
notification of COVID-19 in Ethiopia. Similarly, chronic illness was defined as a disease or
condition that usually lasts for 3 months or longer.

Data Analysis
After manually proof read to maintain data quality, data were entered into SPSS software
package version 25 IBM, USA. Data were analyzed using frequency, percentile, mean, median,
standard deviation, and interquartile range. To evaluate associations between dependent and
independent variables cross-tabulation used first, then bivariate and multivariate regression
model was used.
We run logistic regression models to check any dependency among the 10 independent variables
using the Odds Ratios (ORs) with their 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) to quantify any
association between an outcome variable and possible predictors. Also, differences in
proportions were compared for significance using the chi-square test. A P-value <0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Ethical Considerations
Ethical clearance from the Institutional Review Board of the College of Health Sciences, AAU
was obtained. In addition, letter of permission was obtained from the hospital director to access
the logbook and the information from the chart. Informed consent was obtained from each
patient and caregivers for the interview. Data confidentiality was maintained by avoiding patient
identifiers like name and patient card number. Data access was secured by password controlled
by the principal investigator.

Result
Out of the 750 samples, 94 of the patients and caretakers were not traced, there was major
information gap in 12 of the 656 interviewed then, we remained to analyze 644. The response
rate was 86%.
The age ranged between 1 month and 90 years with the median age of participants was 25 years.
Close to half (47.5% ) of the participants age were in the category of 19-60 years and the male
to Female ratio is 1:1.03, while the median age of females is higher than males (31-IQR-38 and
14.5: IQR-44years) (Table 1).
Hemato-oncology, cardiology and diabetic clinics were the three chronic care clinics with higher
caseloads compared to other clinics. 448(70%) of the participants were missing one or more
appointments and 53(12%) of them also missed their medications. On the other hand, nearly two
third 379(59%) of the participants reported that the local pharmacies did not have the necessary
medications and medication price was increased in 167(26%) of the cases. Local Government
Health Institutions (LGHI) were considered useful only by 105(16%) of the respondents amid
the pandemic. Worsening of symptoms in 68(10.8%) of the case and 8(1.3%) died during the
study period (Table 2).

Table 3 shows the relationship between independent and the outcome factors in both the
univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses. In the bivariate logistic regression
analysis, older patients had higher odds to be lost-to-follow-up compared with the younger
patients. Similarly, patients with moderate to severe diagnoses had higher odds to miss the
follow-up. Fear of COVID-19 (OR=7.76, 95% CI:5.27-11.41, P<0.001), pocket or insurance
payment for treatment (OR=1.90, 95% CI:1.34-2.70, P<0.001), and transportation problem
(OR=2.66, 95% CI: 1.74-4.07, P<0.001) were the main factors associated with lost-to-follow-up
of patients.
In the multivariable logistic regression analysis model, (Table 3) performed using the 10
independent variables, older patients again had higher odds to miss a follow-up. The odds of loss
to follow up among patients who reported the fear of COVID-19 were 19 times higher than
among patients who did not have fear. (adjusted OR=19.32, 95% CI:10.73-34.79, P<0.001), the
odds of loss to follow up among patients who reported transportation problems were 6.5 higher
than among those who don’t have transport problem (adjusted OR=6.11, 95% CI:3.0612.17, P<0.001). Factors such as sex, years of follow-up, distance and means of transport, and
treatment costs did not have a significant influence on the loss-to-follow-up. The multivariable
binary logistic regression model presented in Table 3 had goodness-of-fit under the HosmerLemeshow test (X2=13.32, P=0.101), and the full model containing all predictors was
statistically significant X2 (8, N=604) = 292.6, P<0.001. The model as a whole explained
between 38% (Cox-Snell R2) and 54% (Nagelkerke R2) of the variance in satisfaction level.
There were eight mortality cases, cancer being the diagnosis in six of them, diabetes mellitus in
one of them, and valvular heart disease in the remaining one. All the mortality cases were lost to
follow up during the pandemic while; half of them also missed their medications. In all of them,
disease severity was moderate to severe. The reasons for missed appointment were fear of
COVID-19 infection in 6 of them. The majority lived in an area with more than 200 km away
from the referral hospital (TASH).
As depicted in figure 2, Fear of COVID-19 infection, and lack of transport were the main reasons
to be lost for follow up. Other COVID related reasons like family member illness by COVID-19
were also shown.

Figure 2 showed types of medications that patients were taking on while having follow up at
TASH. Multiple medications, antiepileptics, chemotherapies and antiretroviral drugs were
among the common ones. Majority of the participants did not seek alternative ways to
compensate for their missed appointments. However, self-refill is the most common alternative
action taken by the patients figure 3.
As depicted in Figure 4, 207(27.6% ) of the patients responded to the question about alternative
source of medication when they were missing the appointment. Of these 132(20.5%) did not
search for any alternative source of treatment. 29(4.5%) of them bought their medications
without prescription. The rest sought health care provider (HCP) in the nearby private or
government health institutions. 11 (1.7%) of them opted for Holy water.

Discussion
The study demonstrated that there was a decreased in the care seeking behavior of patients at
follow-up clinic of TASH in the first 3 months of COVID-19 pandemic, March 15 - June 15,
2020. This was more pronounced in older age and moderate to severely ill patients.
Patients and caregivers who have had received phone calls from the hospital prior to the study
also missed follow up. In addition, patients who reported fear of acquiring COVID-19 infection
in the hospital and transportation problem as the main reason of absence from the clinics were
among those who missed the follow-up appointment more frequently than their counterparts did.
The finding that 70% of the participants missing appointment during March 15 to June 15, 2020,
were comparable to the experience of others during former epidemics. A similar response to the
Ebola epidemic in 2013/14 has also been observed in Sera Leon, Guinea and Liberia ((9, 10). For
example, in Sierra Leone, two studies including primary health facilities and facilities offering
basic emergency obstetric care observed that facility-based deliveries were reduced by 27–37%.
In Guinea, a sharp decline of 74–81% in delivery care seen in two of the regions most affected
by Ebola virus disease. On the other hand, essential health service disruption in Pakistan by the
COVID-19 pandemic was estimated to increase by 22 per cent and as many as 5,424,900 fewer
children would have received oral antibiotics for pneumonia, 5,441,800 fewer would have
received DPT vaccinations (11, 12).

Although the WHO reported a 4% LTFU rate globally, these data are at odds with experience in
the field and there is growing concern over the accuracy of population-level estimates (13).
LTFU from various health care services were common in the population with socio-economic
difficulties even before COVID-19 pandemic.
Reports from various LMICs revealed that for patients with hypertension, diabetes, and epilepsy,
the LTFU rate was 22% to 42%, 35%, and 27% to 34% respectively (14, 15). Similarly,
literature from child-nutrition programs and women after screening positive for cervical cancer,
the LTFU rate showed a similar picture (16, 17). The 70% LTFU rate in the current study may be
expected in low-income community particularly in the face of COVID-19 pandemics.
The high LTFU rate observed in the current study can be explained by the temporary lockdown
and abandoning of elective surgeries as some of the preventive measures to halt the spread of the
virus. Earlier report in this country amid the pandemic , showed a decreased in attendance of essential

maternal, newborn, child health services in Addis Ababa city and under-five pneumonia
treatment by 12% and 35% respectively(18).
These reasons were in line of evidences from many countries. Cancellations of planned
treatments, a decrease in public transport available and a lack of staff because health workers
were reassigned to support COVID19 services were among the few. On the other hand, in one in
five reporting countries, the main reasons for discontinuing services were a shortage of
medicines, diagnostics and other technologies (19). Similar chronic illness care disruptions in
Romania, both in the general and specialist medical services were significantly limited because
of the rules imposed to prevent COVID-19 propagation (20).

Old age was an important determinant factor to the LTFU in the current study. Report from
COVID-19 hard hit countries; mortality and severe disease were higher among aged people (1821). Therefore, it is highly probable that older patients avoided coming to the hospital may be
due to consideration of their vulnerability. Fear of Covid-19 was found to be a very strong
predictor of LTFU in the current study. Similar observation made elsewhere in this country,
north-west Ethiopia, acquiring COVID-19 virus was highly threatening for nearly half (52.54%)
of patients with chronic diseases (19, 20).

In this study, those who reported transportation problem missed their follow up visit more
frequently than their counterparts did. It was observed that the novel coronavirus has had a
profound, dramatic impact on the transport system. Because of the contagion, risk caused by the
COVID 19 leads drastic reduction in transport services. It was suggested that limiting transport
for health reason was there in the past, but the scale of the restrictions in the current pandemic
was unprecedented (21). On the other hand, it was an undeniable fact that transport and mobility
have become a potential site for the spread of the virus—especially in situations where transport
is provisioned with enclosed spaces and large concentrations of people, as is often the case in
poor communities like ours (22, 23). Contrary to the developed world where, many aspects of
daily lives have moved online, in low-income countries it is an abrogate to move from one place
to another to get service. Preventive measures like restricting transportation with in a country
thus, affects patients and caretakers directly affecting those who necessarily taking uninterrupted
medications (21, 24).

Seventy-three per cent of the respondents in the current study did not consider local government
health institutions useful during the pandemic. According to WHO Essential NCD package,
making chronic illness care, available at primary care centers, will help to relieve the stress of
going far distance to tertiary centers particularly during COVID-19 pandemic (21).
In fact, the current finding is contradictory to the Ethiopian, Health Service Transformation Plan
2015/2016 that reported 23% to 76 % of local government health institutions were offering
services to people with NCD (25).
In this study, over three-quarters of the cases have received a telephone call. The high figure in
LTFU should have been also the result of the mobile phone call made by the hospital. During the
call, patients were rescheduled, told to buy their medications at local pharmacies or few
requested to come to the hospital for further evaluation (Table 2). As the mobile phone call was
delivered by the hospital in an attempt to link the patients during this difficult time, it did not
follow a uniform standard and the outcome is difficult to evaluate. In fact, it may not be
considered as an important determinant factor for loss to follow up. However, since there was no
standardized protocol and it may not be accessible to all patients, mobile phone service may be
false reassurances to patients to miss their hospital follow up, the current finding may be
important to influence LTFU negatively.
It was argued that in the absence of clear protocols and standardized guidelines for the delivery
of telemedicine consultations, telemedicine might result in harm than benefit. The
implementation in the field of such alternative consultation requires the development of relevant
standards and procedures (26). On the other hand, it was also emphasized that twining the mobile
phone clinic (telemedicine) with tele pharmacy is important to increase healthcare delivery while
decreasing the SARS COV-2 spread (27-29).
A quarter (26%) participants responded that medication price has increased following COVID19 confirmation. Similar observations were made in other reports as well. Furthermore, WHO
stated that COVID-19 pandemic has affected the availability of medicines in many countries (26,
27). National, as well as an international transportation problem, the workforce and the lockdown
measures, have been among the few reasons cited as contributing factors (27, 28). Global Health
Action reported that medicines for non-communicable diseases in many countries were not
available. Countries are already facing the problems when things were made worse by the
COVID-19 pandemic (30)

The other observation made in this study was patients with moderate to severe medical
conditions were loss to follow up more frequently. A contrary observation was made in the
European study, among influenza patients where disease severity was reported to have an
association with more health-seeking behavior (6). Experience also told that, the severity of
COVID-19 infection is directly related to severity of the underlying medical conditions (30).
However, the two scenarios are too different as the former is about risk exposure to viral disease
(COVID-19) while the latter is getting sick by the virus (influenza) itself.
In the current study, 11.8% of the loss to follow up cases also missed their medications. Those
who did not miss medications despite LTFU, have given information on further inquiries, that
they had extra pills at home, or they were able to buy their medications with old prescriptions. A
similar observation was reported during Ebola epidemics (31).
As depicted in Figure 4, Patients had opted to the different alternative medicine. Apart from the
current pandemic, report showed that the use of alternative medicines are commonly practiced
among patients with hypertension and other NCDs; faith in treatment with alternative medicine,
dissatisfaction with conventional medicine and the desire to reduce medication costs are the
reasons for opting(32).
The use of undocumented prescription and its consequence has been discussed (33). Selfmedication is an intermittent or continued use of prescribed drugs for chronic or recurrent
disease or symptoms; a major shortfall of it is the lack of clinical evaluation of the condition by a
trained medical professional, which could result in missed diagnoses and delays in appropriate
treatments (34).
In this study, we received report of 8 deaths between the beginning of Covid 19 pandemics and
the end of the study among the study group. Whether the death was directly related to COVID19 or not was not known. However, their disease severity and the probable shortage of the
medicines due to the lockdown and the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 may have contributed
to their death. The fact that most of them were a cancer case would mean a high risk during
crises time like COVID-19.
Limitation of the study
This is a telephone surveys where many were not accessible. The inaccessibility may be due to
nonfunctioning cellphones, battery death because of frequent power interruption, no smartphones
and low or non- response is also common. Further, the fact that one-third of the patients received

a telephone call from the hospital would dilute our observation as three-quarters of them missed
their follow appointment.
Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic impacted the care-seeking behavior of patients with chronic
health condition negatively and the impact was more severe among patients with severe disease,
those with fear of COVID-19, and transportation problem. Education on preventive measures of
COVID-19 and improving chronic illness care services by the local health institutions including
availability of essential drugs may reduce the dire effect of the loss to follow up among patients
with a chronic medical condition. The practice of phone service in LMIC, should be based on the
local standard operation procedure taking into account the communities’ interest and access to
technology.
