Abstract
Conventional reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)
technology has struggled to fulfill the unprecedented need for diagnostic testing created by the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Complexity and cost
hinder access to testing, and long turnaround-time decreases its utility. To ameliorate these
issues, we focus on saliva and introduce several advances to colorimetric reverse-transcription
loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) technology; RT-LAMP offers a minimal
equipment alternative to RT-qPCR. First, we validated the use of the novel dye LAMPShade
Violet (LSV), which improves the visual clarity and contrast of the colorimetric readout. Second,
we compared different inactivation conditions on infectivity and RNA yield from saliva. Third,
we developed a ten-minute RNA purification protocol from saliva. We call this magnetic bead
protocol SalivaBeads. Finally, we developed a magnetic stick, StickLAMP, which provides
reliable bead-based RNA purification as well as simple and low-cost access to scalable testing
from saliva.

Introduction
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has highlighted
many shortcomings in our national response and has driven an enormous increase in our need for
in vitro diagnostics. A diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 using quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction (qPCR) technology and nasopharyngeal swabs was developed within weeks of
identifying the virus but is suboptimal for serving all diagnostic needs of this global pandemic.
This technology has struggled with turnaround time, supply chain shortages, and cost in the
effort to increase the amount of testing worldwide1. Many entities, commercial and academic
alike, have risen to the challenge of adapting and developing molecular technologies to address
these shortcomings. Among the myriad efforts that subsequently emerged, reverse transcription
loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) technology may prove to be a viable if not
preferable alternative to qPCR technology in addressing at least some of the diagnostic needs of
a global pandemic.
LAMP is a nucleic acid detection technology that operates like PCR on the principle of
nucleic acid amplification.2 Unlike PCR however, LAMP is an isothermal technology and
therefore obviates the need for thermal cyclers that would otherwise gate diagnostics behind
equipment that costs several thousand dollars. Briefly, LAMP requires at least four (and up to
six) different primers: two that contain a self-complementary region that generates a perpetually
single-stranded loop structure as well as two that target the region within the single-stranded loop
structure. A strand invasion event with the two self-complementing primers initiates production
of the initial product containing open loops at either end; exponential amplification can then
occur using the loop-targeting primers and a polymerase with strand-displacement ability. In
short, LAMP can generate a detectable amount of DNA in a comparable amount of time to PCR

but at a single reaction temperature. The DNA can be detected through several different
means, including turbidity or through fluorescence with the inclusion of a fluorescent
dye. However, a result interpretable to the naked eye would be optimal for a test to enjoy
widespread use3,4.
Earlier efforts have explored the use of colorimetric detection of amplification
products using a pH dye, phenol red, or a magnesium indicator, hydroxynaphthol blue
(HNB)5–9. With phenol red, the color will change from red to yellow as more DNA
acidifies the reaction. With HNB, the color will change from light blue to dark blue in the
presence of magnesium which is a byproduct of amplification. These color changes are
adequate but suffer from limited visible contrast and can often exhibit ambiguous color
changes. Our work here uses the novel pH dye LAMPShade Violet (LSV) as an
alternative to phenol red in RT-LAMP10. LSV has greater visual contrast between high
and low pH and a stronger inflection point, both easing interpretation and reducing the
number of ambiguous events.
Saliva is growing increasingly popular as an alternative respiratory specimen to
nasopharyngeal swabs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Saliva is much easier to collect,
and some report that it is a comparable, even superior specimen for SARS-CoV-2
diagnostics11. Previous efforts have identified saliva as compatible with RT-LAMP even
in the absence of RNA purification. It was replaced by an inactivation step that
normalizes the pH, releases RNA, and inactivates RNases5. However, saliva is very
heterogenous between individuals, which confounds a one-size-fits-all inactivation
strategy. We therefore optimized an inactivation protocol with improved success across
heterogenous saliva samples when combined with LAMPShade Violet. We suggest that

this direct method is suitable for small-scale testing environments where it is easy to resample.
Despite this improvement, many saliva samples were still incompatible with direct input
into a colorimetric RT-LAMP reaction. This is prohibitive at scale, where samples cannot be
individually resampled or modified for compatibility. We therefore developed and introduced a
magnetic bead-based rapid RNA-purification procedure for saliva, which we term
“SalivaBeads.” It features a saliva-optimized bead binding solution and uses a magnetic stick
(MS) to isolate RNA-bound magnetic beads, which not only improves processing time and
scalability but also resolves issues surrounding saliva compatibility with colorimetric RT-LAMP.
The SalivaBeads procedure also takes less than ten minutes and substantially improves
sensitivity over direct input.
This paper therefore describes our efforts to develop and optimize this low-cost, scalable,
and sensitive saliva RT-LAMP protocol, which also minimizes reliance on specialized
equipment. The MS is an inexpensive and dramatically more scalable alternative for RNA
purification from saliva compared to magnetic racks and multichannel pipettes. We also
improved several previous efforts with enhanced visual fidelity, sample compatibility, and
sensitivity at minimal additional cost. Altogether, our protocol exhibits a limit of detection of 3.7
copies/µl in a 200µl saliva sample, costs less than $5 per sample without pooling or accounting
for labor, and takes approximately 1 hour to conduct from beginning to end.

Results
We present two different SARS-CoV-2 protocols. The first, named “the direct assay” is
conducted on inactivated, unpurified saliva; it is suitable for low throughput testing in low
resource environments. However, high frequency or large population testing is likely to prove
problematic. This is in part due to the pH variation exhibited by different sources of saliva. In
order to address this issue, we developed a second version, “the purified assay”, which adds a
novel and rapid purification step. It normalizes saliva pH from different sources while improving
sensitivity.
Both protocols begin identically: the crude saliva samples are inactivated by
addition of a TCEP, EDTA, and NaOH solution. The samples are then heated to 95°C for
5 minutes and allowed to cool at room temperature for at least 3 minutes. In the direct
assay, 5µl of inactivated saliva is then added to two RT-LAMP reactions, one targeting
SARS-CoV-2 and the other actin. In the purified assay, 2 volumes of SalivaBeads –
described below - are added for 5 minutes before being removed by a magnetic stick. The
stick-bound beads are washed in water for 30 seconds and then eluted twice sequentially,
first directly into a SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP reaction and then into an actin RT-LAMP
reaction. In both assays, RT-LAMP reactions are incubated at 65°C for 45 minutes.
Both assays rely on the color difference caused by successful DNA amplification.
A positive test is indicated by both reactions turning clear, a negative test is indicated by
the actin reaction turning clear and the SARS-CoV-2 reaction remaining purple, and an
inconclusive/unsuccessful test is indicated by the Actin reaction remaining purple.
Comparing the color changes in the two reactions is critical in the direct assay, where

baseline color may be affected by the pH of the input saliva sample. However, a careful
comparison is less important in the purified assay, where all samples exhibit comparable
baseline pH values following purification.
What follows describes our efforts in developing and optimizing the parameters of our protocol.

Lamp Shade Violet (LSV) and modifications to avoid heterogeneity to avoid saliva pH
variation
In our initial tests, we used a previously described 100x inactivation reagent consisting of 2.5M
TCEP, 100mM EDTA, and 1.2M NaOH5. The NaOH concentration is critical, as the
colorimetric readout varies with pH. As in this publication5, we initially used the colorimetric
RT-LAMP reagent provided by NEB, which use Phenol Red as a pH sensor. Phenol Red changes
from red to yellow upon acidification by successful amplification.
Although 1.2M NaOH was sufficient in most cases, many samples were still too acidic
and caused the reaction to turn prematurely positive, meaning even prior to incubation. To
address this problem, we took two approaches which were evaluated on four different samples
from four individuals (Figure 1A). First, we increased the NaOH concentration to 1.4M and
1.6M and observed the color changes pre- and post-incubation. Second, we used a different pHsensitive dye – LAMPShade Violet (LSV)10. It changes from purple to clear upon successful
amplification. Because LSV has sharper contrast and fewer intermediate color changes than
Phenol Red, we hypothesized that LSV may help with the interpretation of samples from saliva
with outlier pH values.
1.4M NaOH was the best concentration to accommodate samples across different pH
values. Although a color difference was observed between positive and negative samples, more

alkaline samples were still ambiguous with Phenol Red. LAMPShade Violet in contrast
was superior in distinguishing positive and negative samples.
To compare our in-house RT-LAMP reaction to NEB-supplied reagents, we used
them both to detect 20 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which is near the threshold for
success (Figure 1B). They were qualitatively similar: our in-house version was positive 5
out of 8 times, whereas the commercial was positive 4 out of 8 times. Yet we prefer LSV
because of its superior contrast and performance with samples of heterogenous pH
values.

Viral Inactivation at 65°C is effective
The current protocol involves virus inactivation at 95°C followed by a 65°C RT-LAMP
incubation. To simplify the protocol and further reduce equipment demands, we assayed virus
inactivation at 65°C or even at room temperature (RT) with or without inactivation reagent.
Whereas 5 min at RT was insufficient to eliminate biological activity even with the addition of
inactivation reagent, 5 min at 65°C with or without reagent addition reduced activity to
undetectable, i.e., by at least 5-6 log units (Figure 2A).
We also compared SARS-CoV-2 RNA yield from a 65°C vs a 95°C incubation.
To create specimens that most closely resembled clinical samples, we contrived saliva
samples using inactivated but intact SARS-CoV-2 virions from Zeptometrix (Figure 2B).
A 65°C degree inactivation for 15 minutes led to a significant 1-cycle, approximately 2fold loss in RNA yield compared to a 95°C inactivation for 5 min (t(4)=3.274, p=0.0307).
This modest decrease suggests that 65°C inactivation is an acceptable alternative in
environments that can only afford minimal equipment or are otherwise averse to near-

boiling temperatures. However, the improvement in yield at 95°C suggests that it is preferred in
environments that can accommodate this temperature,. Further efforts described below use this
inactivation temperature.

Testing means of purifying RNA from saliva
To further improve sensitivity and sample compatibility, we sought to develop a rapid RNA
purification protocol optimized for saliva. We first measured RNA recovery using fluorimetry
with a Qubit device and compared various bead-based methods with Trizol purification (Figure
3A). They included: 2 volumes of Ampure Beads XP, 2 volumes of magnetic silica beads in an
NaCl/PEG-8000 solution, 2 volumes of magnetic carboxylated beads in an NaCl/PEG-8000
solution, glass milk in a NaCl/PEG-8000 solution as well as glass milk in a Sodium Iodide (NaI)
solution as previously described5,12. Ampure XP beads as well as the NaCl/PEG-8000 based bead
mixes were comparable to Trizol (Figure 3A). Due to lower cost and the advantage of being
suitable for scale and automation, we decided to use the NaCl/PEG-8000 based bead mix with
carboxylated beads for further optimization of RNA purification from saliva.
Because current inactivation procedures were developed for direct input of saliva into an
RT-LAMP reaction, we further optimized inactivation for input into bead-based RNA
purification. Different concentrations of TCEP as well as Proteinase K were assayed, the later
with a 5 min 65°C incubation followed by a 5 min 95°C incubation (Figure 3C).
Although Proteinase K was effective in increasing RNA yield compared to the initial
condition of 2.5mM TCEP, 6.25mM TCEP was even better and used below.

Optimizing salt and salt concentration

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.26.20248880; this version posted January 2, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

To optimize the NaCl/Peg-8000 bead mix, we examined the effects of salt type, salt
concentration, and PEG-8000 concentration on RNA yield from saliva. For reference, the
original purification recipe calls for 1M NaCl, and 18% PEG-800012. Different concentrations of
NaCl and different concentrations of Sodium Acetate (NaOAc) were assayed; the latter is also
commonly used in nucleic acid precipitation. Different concentrations of Guanidine
Hydrochloride (GuHCl) – another reagent commonly used in nucleic acid purification – were
also assessed (Figure 4A). Although all salts at all concentrations tested could purify RNA, NaCl
at a reduced concentration of 0.7M produced a significant higher yield compared to the original
recipe at 1M (P<1x10-4, One-Way ANOVA, Tukey’s HSD) and compared to the other salts.
In other tests, the addition of PEG-8000 to RT-LAMP increased the false positive
rate (data not shown). Although we did not see a similar change with the purified assay, it
is possible that a modestly increased rate becomes relevant with large scale testing. We
therefore decided to reduce the concentration of PEG-8000 until it affected yield. We
found no significant difference between 18% PEG-8000 and 12% PEG-8000 (Figure 4B).
Because visual examination of the data suggested a slight loss of sensitivity between 14%
and 12% (data not shown), we adjusted the buffer to 14% PEG-8000. Our final adjusted
recipe therefore uses 0.7M NaCl and 14% PEG-8000.

Optimizing elution and binding times
In our purification protocol, the bead mix is left to bind RNA for a certain amount of time before
being removed by a magnet, henceforth referred to as binding time. At the end of the protocol,
the beads are left to release RNA in the reaction mix for a certain amount of time, henceforth
referred to as elution time. Our earlier development procedures used a 5 minute binding time and

a 1 minute elution time. To minimize the test processing time, we determined the minimal
binding and elution times without sacrificing sensitivity.
We first tested a 1 minute, 5 minute, and 15 minute binding time with a 1 minute elution.
We observed a significant difference between 1 minute and a 5 minute binding time (p < 0.01,
One-Way ANOVA, Tukey’s HSD) but no significant difference between 5 minutes and 15
minutes (Figure 5A). We therefore chose a 5 minute binding time. We then compared 10
second, 1 minute, and 5 minute elution time (Figure 5B). We found no significant differences
and so chose an elution time of 30 seconds for improved operational consistency.

Optimizing wash buffers
The majority of bead-based RNA purification protocols feature a 70-80% ethanol wash to
remove non-specifically bound contaminants without removing nucleic acids. Because ethanol is
incompatible with many downstream enzymatic reactions, protocols involving an ethanol wash
typically require a long drying step to remove all traces of ethanol. To eliminate this drying step,
we compared this standard 80% ethanol wash to Water and to 130mM NaCl, which was used in
a cellulose dipstick-based purification assay.13 We therefore washed the beads for 30 seconds in
200µl of the indicated wash buffers and then eluted in 50µl of Deionized H2O for 30 seconds.
We then ethanol precipitated the RNA under standard conditions (see methods) and assayed
recovery by qPCR.
There was no significant difference between RNA levels in the 80% EtOH and in the
Water wash fractions (Figure 7A). However, 130mM NaCl washed off significantly more RNA
(p<1x10-4, One-Way ANOVA, Tukey’s HSD). In the eluate, there was no significant difference
between RNA recovered from the 130mM NaCl-washed beads and the 80% EtoH-washed beads,

but the H2O-washed beads exhibited a significant 1-cycle improvement (p<1x10-3, Oneway ANOVA, Tukey’s HSD) (Figure 7C). We therefore decided that water was the most
suitable wash reagent for quick purification, also because water is compatible with the
RT-LAMP reaction and requires no drying step following washing.
These changes and optimizations and our bead mix are henceforth referred to as
“SalivaBeads”.

StickLAMP
Most nucleic acid isolation procedures that use magnetic beads also employ an elution step,
which releases the purified RNA into an intermediate buffer such as water or Tris prior to
addition to a reaction. We sought to simplify this strategy by eluting RNA from SalivaBeads
directly into the RT-LAMP mix. However, the sensitivity was poor compared to the direct assay.
Both assays were able to routinely detect 100 copies/µl of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but only the
direct assay was able to detect 25 copies/µl. (Figure 7A).
To address whether this was due to a poor RNA yield from SalivaBeads, we
compared this yield to that from Ampure XP beads. This was done from saliva as well as
from purified RNA in water (Figure 7B). SalivaBeads had superior yield to Ampure XP
beads from saliva but inferior from water. Moreover, the SalivaBeads yield from saliva
was comparable to the Ampure XP yield from water. This indicates that the reduced
sensitivity is not due to poor yield but rather from some sort of contaminant carryover or
other incompatibility.
Indeed, we noticed that considerable debris clung to the SalivaBeads that
persisted through the wash step and contaminated the RT-LAMP mix (Figure 7C, left).

We therefore developed a magnetic stick that would remove the beads prior to downstream
processing (Figure 7D). Importantly, the stick appeared to be selective for removing the beads
without most of the saliva debris (Figure 7C, right). Consistent with this observation, magnetic
stick purification could faithfully detect 10 copies/µl, whereas magnetic rack purification could
not (Figure 7E).

Performance analysis of StickLAMP
To evaluate the performance of StickLAMP purification, we determined the copy number at
which 95% of reactions score positive, henceforth referred to as the limit of detection (LOD).
Our LOD was at least 3.7 copies per microliter, i.e., 19 of 20 contrived samples with 3.7 copies
of SARS-CoV-2/µl in 200ul saliva scored positive (Figure 8A).
To ensure that this LOD is similar across a wide variety of saliva types, we collected
saliva from 16 different individuals and created two contrived samples per individual with 3.7
copies/µl of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 8B). For 15/16 individuals, both samples were positive. For
the 16th individual, only one sample was positive, but both samples were positive upon retesting.
The 3.7 copy/µl LOD is therefore robust across different individuals.

Discussion
We present two protocols for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from saliva, which feature
several innovations. First, LAMPShade Violet (LSV) is an attractive alternative to Phenol Red
for the colorimetric detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva; LSV improves visual fidelity
without sacrificing sensitivity. Second, 65° is completely successful at viral inactivation in
saliva. Compared to the more standard 95°C, 65°C enhances safety, reduces testing time and
equipment demands with only somewhat reduced detection sensitivity. Third, we present a rapid
purification protocol. It adds less than ten minutes to the processing time, costs less than 20 cents
per sample, and is optimized for saliva. The purification improves sensitivity over tenfold and
normalizes sample pH for downstream colorimetric detection.
Purification uses a magnetic stick (MS)as an integral tool for rapid nucleic acid
purification. Saliva contains substantial and variable levels of debris. It sticks to nucleic acid
binding media like beads and inhibits the LAMP colorimetric assay. One previous effort also
focused on this assay circumvented the debris issue with centrifugation5. However, this solution
is undesirable for scaled testing as centrifuges are difficult to introduce into an automated
workflow. They are also expensive and are contrary to the goal of minimizing equipment
requirements. The MS selectively binds magnetic beads over saliva debris and therefore
substitutes for centrifugation. MS also has several advantages over the other traditional method
of bead separation, magnetic rack purification.
First, MS has superior scaling potential. Multichannel pipettes are typically used
in magnetic rack purification to improve throughput and sample processing time in both
manual and automated workflows. Importantly however, the number of channels is
constrained by mechanical considerations in multichannel pipettes, whereas the MS

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.26.20248880; this version posted January 2, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

simplicity enables the number of simultaneous “channels” to scale well beyond traditional
limitations. Indeed, we developed 4-channel, 8-channel, and a 24-channel versions for the
purpose of large-scale multiplex purification reactions, as well as a custom rack designed for a
24-channel MS to elute directly into a 96 or 384-well plate (Figure 9B and 9C).
Second, this superior scaling potential also reduces the additional processing time
required by more samples. The addition of every 8 samples increases the required processing
time with an 8-channel multipipette, but a 24-channel MS increases processing time only beyond
24 samples. The processing time is further reduced because 2-3 pipetting steps are replaced with
a single dipping step.
Third, the cost of a MS is dramatically less than a multichannel pipette. A 24-channel
magnetic stick costs less than $5.00 to produce, and each tip is less than $0.05, about $6.00 in
total. An 8-channel multipipette in contrast costs well over a thousand dollars.
Our purification optimization results also suggest several unexplored directions for future
saliva-based nucleic acid diagnostics. The optimal NaCl concentrations were well below the
theoretical limit required for purifying nucleic acids, suggesting that uncharacterized minerals or
salts present in saliva are aiding nucleic acid binding to carboxylated beads14. In addition, all
saliva samples benefitted from additional TCEP, greater than previously published
concentrations5. However, the degree to which they benefit and even the amount of RNA
purified from different saliva samples varied. This suggests potential heterogeneity of RNase
levels and/or RNA content between samples, which future saliva-based diagnostic test efforts
should consider to make further improvements. We are nonetheless confident in our reported
LOD, given its consistency across the wide variety of tested samples.

In summary, these new SARS-CoV-2 detection protocols are inexpensive, less
than $5 per test without considering labor and sample pooling, and offer improved
scalability over existing tests without sacrificing sensitivity. They are especially suited
for workplaces or schools with modest numbers of employees and students, from single
digits to the low thousands. The minimal equipment requirements and low cost also make
them well-suited for low resource environments, which still might be able to mount a
medium complexity CLIA lab. We note in this context that low-resource and underserved
environments have been disproportionately vulnerable to the spread of SARS-CoV-215.

Table 1 describes primer sequences and concentrations used to produce a 5x primer solution.
Primer sequences are derived from previous work4,5.
Control RNA
Contrived samples were created using either heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 RNA from BEI (NR52286), or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viral particles from Zeptometrix (CAT#
NATSARS(COV2)-ST). In order to optimize and evaluate magnetic-bead purification
procedures, RNA from BEI was diluted in 1ng/µl Drosophila RNA to 1000 copies/µl and spiked
in to inactivated saliva at the stated concentration. In order to evaluate the full-process
performance of the protocol, limit of detection experiments and experiments intended to evaluate
RNA release from viral particles were conducted using Zeptometrix SARS-CoV-2 particles
added into raw saliva at the stated concentrations. In the proceeding methods, the control used
will be specified.
Saliva inactivation
10x inactivation was prepared with 62.5mM TCEP(Goldbio TCEP1), 10mM EDTA
(ThermoFisher Scientific 10977015), and 130mM NaOH. 10x inactivation reagent was added to
a final concentration of 1x to raw saliva and inverted 10 times, or vortexed for 5 seconds at
maximum speed. Saliva samples were then heated to 95°C for 5 minutes and allowed to cool at
room temperature for 3 minutes prior to downstream processing. When testing 65°C inactivation,
we inactivated for 15 minutes at 65°C and let samples cool to room temperature for 3 minutes

prior to downstream processing.[But what about 65 degree change?]During optimization
experiments, TCEP concentrations used are as described in figures and results.During Proteinase
K testing, the indicated amount of Proteinase K (NEB P8107S) was added to saliva and heated at
65°C for 5 minutes and inactivated at 95°C for 10 minutes. Virus titers in untreated or treated
samples were then determined using Vero E6 cells (grown in 10% FBS-DMEM). For plaque
assays, cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde 3 days after infection and stained with crystal
violet.
Purification
Commercial Ampure XP beads (Beckman-Coulter Life Sciences A63881) were used according
to protocol at 2x volumes and eluted in 30µl Milli-Q H2O.
Unmodified homemade magnetic bead buffer was prepared using 100mM NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich
S9888), 20% PEG-8000 w/v (Sigma-Aldrich 1546605), 10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1mM EDTA
(ThermoFisher Scientific 10977015, and Milli-Q H2O to 50ml. 1000µl Sera-mag Speedbeads
(FisherScientific 09-981-123) were washed twice in 1ml 10mM Tris ph 8, 1mM EDTA, and
added to bead buffer.
The final SalivaBeads recipe uses the same materials as listed above, but with 700mM NaCl,
14% PEG-8000 w/v, 10mM Tris-HCl, pH8, 1mM EDTA, 200µl Sera-mag Speedbeads, and
Milli-Q H2O to 50ml.
Commercial Ampure XP beads and unmodified homemade magnetic bead buffer was used
according to commercial Ampure XP protocols.
For Salivabeads, two volumes of SalivaBeads were added to inactivated saliva samples and
inverted 5 times. Bead+saliva mix was incubated at room temperature for 3 minutes. A magnetic
stick with tip was added to bead+saliva mix for two minutes, with agitation at one minute and

before removing. Magnetic stick with bound beads were dipped in 100µl Milli-Q H2O prepared
in a PCR strip tube up and down 5 times, then left to incubate for 20-25 seconds. The magnetic
stick was then removed from the water and placed in SARS-CoV-2 reaction mix for 60 seconds.
After 60 seconds, the magnetic stick was removed from the SARS-CoV-2 reaction mix and
placed in Actin reaction mix for 30 seconds, then removed and the tip was discarded.
For purifying RNA from wash steps, ethanol was added to each sample to a final concentration
of 75% and a final volume of 200µl. Sodium acetate (Invitrogen AM9740) was added to a final
concentration of 0.3M. Samples were left to precipitate overnight at -20°C. The next day,
samples were spun down for 30 minutes at 18000 RCF. Samples were washed once in 80%
ethanol and eluted into 20µl of Milli-Q H2O, 5µl of which was subsequently used in qPCR
reactions.
qPCR
qPCR was done using Luna Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (NEB E3006L) and the
CDC N1 primer (IDT 10006713). Reactions and cycling conditions were prepared according to
manufacturer’s protocol.
3D Printing
Magnetic Sticks and Tips were printed using Siraya Tech Blu (Siraya Tech) on an Epax X10 UV
LCD 3D Printer with 8.9 inch 4K mono LCD (Epax) using the following settings: 0.05mm Layer
Height, 8 Bottom Layers, 3.2s Exposure Time, 12.4s Bottom Exposure Time, 7mm Lift,
35mm/min Lift Speed, 125mm/min Retract Speed. Magnets used were 2.54mm Diameter, 0.600”
Length N50 magnets (SuperMagnetMan, Cyl0072-20).
