Abstract
Background: Many risk factors have emerged for novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). It is relatively
unknown how these factors collectively predict COVID-19 infection risk, as well as risk for a severe infection
(i.e., hospitalization).
Methods: Among aged adults (69.3 ± 8.6 years) in UK Biobank, COVID-19 data was downloaded for 4,510
participants with 7,539 test cases. We downloaded baseline data from 10-14 years ago, including
demographics, biochemistry, body mass, and other factors, as well as antibody titers for 20 common to rare
infectious diseases. Permutation-based linear discriminant analysis was used to predict COVID-19 risk and
hospitalization risk. Probability and threshold metrics included receiver operating characteristic curves to
derive area under the curve (AUC), specificity, sensitivity, and quadratic mean.
Results: The “best-fit” model for predicting COVID-19 risk achieved excellent discrimination (AUC=0.969, 95%
CI=0.934-1.000). Factors included age, immune markers, lipids, and serology titers to common pathogens like
human cytomegalovirus. The hospitalization “best-fit” model was more modest (AUC=0.803, 95% CI=0.6630.943) and included only serology titers.
Conclusions: Accurate risk profiles can be created using standard self-report and biomedical data collected in
public health and medical settings. It is also worthwhile to further investigate if prior host immunity predicts
current host immunity to COVID-19.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel beta-coronavirus called severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1, is a worldwide pandemic that continues to severely disrupt the
economic, social, and psychological well-being of countless people. Clinical presentation of COVID-19 widely
varies, ranging from asymptomatic profiles to mild symptoms like high fever or cough to acute respiratory
disease syndrome and death. Given this heterogeneous symptom presentation, as well as difficulties with
serology testing, contact tracing, and more recently vaccine administration, it remains important to isolate or
maximize safety for adults most at risk for COVID-19 infection and severe disease.
By extension, a large body of research has investigated potential factors that increase COVID-19 infection and
disease severity risk. It is well known, for example, that adults aged >65 years are much more likely to be
hospitalized or die due to COVID-19. Obesity itself and adverse health behaviors like smoking also increase
infection risk and likelihood of hospitalization2,3. Several age and obesity-related conditions such as
cardiovascular disease, cardiometabolic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes), hypertension, and other disease
states and syndromes are also of concern4. Non-white ethnicity, particularly being black regardless of country
of origin, socioeconomic deprivation, and low levels of education even after adjustment for health factors
point to less privilege unfortunately conferring risk5. Among biological markers, COVID-19 infection or severity
has been related to higher C-Reactive Protein and more circulating white blood cells and lower counts of
lymphocytes or granulocytes (e.g., monocytes)6-8. SARS-CoV-1 has a similar profile except for a relatively
normal total white blood cell count9.
These studies are invaluable for establishing or validating risk factors to guide clinical decisions and
policymaker choices. However, we ultimately need to develop risk profiles derived from these factors to
accurately predict who will and will not develop COVID-19, and if a COVID-19 disease course will be mild or
presumptively severe (i.e., require hospitalization). Data-driven modelling using machine learning can be used
to create robust prediction models based on routinely collected biomedical data like demographics, a
complete blood count, and standard medical biochemistry data. Critically, by using non COVID-19 serological
data, we may gain insight into the host’s ability to fight COVID-19 by examining antibody titers that detail the
host response to past infectious pathogens. This “virome” may affect host innate and adaptive immunity9,10.
For example, human cytomegalovirus vastly changes the composition of T and B cells11, and may induce
immune senescence that could account for worse SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes.
Therefore, our objective was to use classification machine learning to determine how baseline measures,
collected 10-14 years ago, could best predict which older adults developed COVID-19. Our second objective
was to make similar predictions but for determining if someone positive with COVID-19 had a mild or severe
infection. In summary, we achieved > 90% sensitivity and specificity with outstanding diagnostic value
(AUC=0.969) for correctly predicting COVID-19 infection based on factors like age, biochemistry and white
blood cell markers, and antibody titers to common pathogens like human cytomegalovirus, human
herpesvirus 6, and chlamydia trachomatis. For COVID-19 severity, only antibody titers loaded for finals models
that more modestly predicted severe disease (AUC: 0.803; specificity=61.1%, sensitivity=85.7%). Nonetheless,
this report shows that trait-like baseline data from 10-14 years ago can better characterize who is most at risk
for COVID-19 and if they are likely to be hospitalized with a presumptively severe infection. In addition, our

results suggest that past infection history and antibody response may be an invaluable, novel predictor of host
immunity to COVID-19 that warrants further study.

Methods
Study design and participants
This retrospective study involved the UK Biobank cohort12. UK Biobank consists of approximately 500,000
people now aged 50 to 84 years (mean age=69.4 years). Baseline data was collected in 2006-2010 at 22
centers across the United Kingdom13,14. Summary data are listed in Table 1. This research involved deidentified
epidemiological data. All UK Biobank participants gave written, informed consent. Ethics approval for the UK
Biobank study was obtained from the National Health Service Health Research Authority North West Haydock Research Ethics Committee (16/NW/0274). All analyses were conducted in line with UK Biobank
requirements.
The following categories of predictors were downloaded: 1) demographics; 2) health behaviors and long-term
disability or illness status; 3) anthropometric and bioimpedance measures of fat, muscle, or water content; 4)
pulse and blood pressure; 5) a serum panel of thirty biochemistry markers commonly collected in a clinic or
hospital setting; and 6) a complete blood count with a manual differential.
Demographics
These factors included participant age in years at baseline, sex, education qualifications, ethnicity, and
Townsend Deprivation Index. Sex was coded as 0 for female and 1 for male. For education, higher scores
roughly correspond to progressively more skilled trade/vocational or academic training. Ethnicity was coded
as UK citizens who identified as White, Black/Black British, or Asian/Asian British. The Townsend index 15 is a
standardized score indicating relative degree of deprivation or poverty based on permanent address.

Health Behaviors and Conditions
This category consisted of self-reported alcohol status, smoking status, a subjective health rating on a 1-4
Likert scale (“Excellent” to “Poor”), and whether the participant had a self-described long-term medical
condition. As noted in Table 1, 48.4% of participants indicated having such an ailment. We independently
confirmed self-reported data with ICD-10 codes while at hospital. These conditions included all-cause
dementia and other neurological disorders, various cancers, major depressive disorder, cardiovascular or
cerebrovascular diseases and events, cardiometabolic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes), renal and pulmonary
diseases, and other so-called pre-existing conditions.

Vital Signs
The first automated reading of pulse, diastolic and systolic blood pressure at the baseline visit were used.

Body Morphometrics and Compartment Mass
Anthropometric measures of adiposity (Body Mass Index, waist circumference) were derived as described16.
Data also included bioelectrical impedance metrics that estimate central body cavity (i.e., trunk) and whole
body fat mass, fat-free muscle mass, or water content17.

Blood Biochemistry and Immunology
Serum biomarkers were assayed from baseline samples as described 18. Briefly, using immunoassay or clinical
chemistry devices, spectrophotometry was used to initially quantify values for 34 biochemistry analytes. UK
Biobank deemed 30 of these markers to be suitably robust. We rejected a further 4 markers due data
missingness >70% (estradiol, rheumatoid factor), or because there was strong overlap with multicollinear
variables that had more stable distributions or trait-like qualities (glucose rejected vs. glycated
hemoglobin/hba1c; direct bilirubin rejected vs. total bilirubin). A complete blood count with a manual
differential was separately processed for red and white blood cell counts, as well as white cell sub-types.

Serology Measures for Non COVID-19 Infectious Diseases
As described (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/crystal/docs/infdisease.pdf), among 9,695 randomized UK
Biobank participants selected from the full 500,000 participant cohort, baseline serum was thawed and
pathogen-specific assays run in parallel using flow cytometry on a Luminex bead platform19.
Here, the goal of the multiplex serology panel was to measure multiple antibodies against several antigens for
different pathogens, reducing noise and estimating the prevalence of prior infection and seroconversion in at
least UK Biobank. All measures were initially confirmed in serum samples using gold-standard assays with
median sensitivity and specificity of 97.0% and 93.7%, respectively. Antibody load for each pathogen-specific
antigen was quantified using median fluorescence intensity (MFI). Because seropositivity is difficult to assess
for several pathogens, we did not use pathogen prevalence as a predictor in models.
Table 2 shows the selected pathogens, their respective antigens, estimated prevalence of each pathogen
based roughly on antibody titers, and assay values. This array ranges from delta-type retroviruses like human
T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 that are rare (<1%) to human herpesviruses 6 and 7 that have an estimated
prevalence of more than 90%.

COVID-19 Testing
Our study was based on COVID PCR test data available from March 16 th to May 19th 2020. Specifically, we used
the May 26th, 2020 tranche of COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) data from Public Health England.
There were 4,510 unique participants that had 7,539 individual tests administered, hereafter called test cases.
For modeling COVID-19 infection data, each test case was coded as ‘0’ and ‘1’, respectively representing a

negative or positive PCR test. For modeling COVID-19 disease severity, each test case was coded as ‘0’ and ‘1’,
which represented out-patient testing (i.e., presumptively mild case) or hospital in-patient testing with clinical
signs of infection (i.e., presumptively severe case).

Statistical Analyses
For a more technical description of the specific machine learning algorithm used to classify test cases, see
Supplemental Text 1. SPSS 27 was used for all analyses and Alpha set at .05. Preliminary findings suggested
that baseline serology data performed well in classifier models, despite a limited number of participants with
serology. To determine if this serology sub-group was noticeably different from the full sample, MannWhitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were done (Alpha=.05). Hereafter, separate sets of classification analyses
were performed for: 1) the full cohort; and 2) the sub-group of participants that had serology data. In other
words, due to the imbalance of sample sizes and by definition the absence or presence of serology data,
classifier performance in the serology sub-group was never statistically compared to the full cohort.
Next, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to create predictive models that discriminated between
negative vs. positive COVID-19 diagnosis or mild vs. severe disease status. LDA is a regression-like classification
technique that finds the best linear combination of predictors that can maximally distinguish between groups
of interest. To determine how useful a given predictor or related group of predictors (e.g., demographics)
were for classification, simple forced entry models were first done. Subsequently, to derive “best fit,” robust
models of the data, stepwise entry (Wilks’ Lambda, F value entry=3.84) was used to exclude predictors that
did not significantly account for unique variance in the classification model. This data reduction step is critical
because LDA can lead to model overfitting when there are too many predictors relative to observations20,21,
which are COVID-19 test cases for our purposes. Finally, because there were multiple test cases that could
occur for the same participant, this would violate the assumption of independence. To guard against this
problem, we used Mundry and Sommer’s permutation LDA approach. Specifically, for each LDA model,
permutation testing (1,000 iterations, P<.05) was done by randomizing participants across groupings of test
cases to confirm robustness of the original model22.
LDA model overfitting can also occur when there is a sample size imbalance. Because there were many more
negative vs. positive COVID-19 test cases in the full sample (5,329 vs. 2210), the negative test group was
undersampled. Specifically, a random number generator was used to discard 2,500 negative test cases at
random, such that the proportion of negative to positive tests was now 55% to 45% instead of 70.6% to 29.4%.
Results without undersampling were similar (data not shown). No such imbalance was seen for COVID-19
severity in the full sample or for the serology sub-group. A typical holdout method of 70% and 30% was used
for classifier training and then testing23. Finally, a two-layer non-parametric approach was used to determine
model significance and estimated fit of one or more predictors. First, bootstrapping24 (95% Confidence
Interval, 1000 iterations) was done to derive estimates robust against any violations of parametric
assumptions. Next, ‘leave-one-out’ cross-validation20 was done with bootstrap-derived estimates to ensure
that models themselves were robust. Collectively, the stepwise LDA models ensured that estimation bias of
coefficients would be low because most predictors are “thrown out” before models are generated using the
remaining predictors.

For each LDA classification model, outcome threshold metrics included: specificity (i.e., true negatives
correctly identified), sensitivity (i.e., true positives correctly identified), and the geometric mean (i.e., how well
the model predicted both true negatives and positives). The area under the curve (AUC) with a 95%
confidence interval (CI) was reported to show how well a given model could distinguish between a COVID-19
negative or positive test result, and separately for COVID-19+ test cases if the disease was mild or severe.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves plotted sensitivity against 1-specificity to better visualize results
for sets of predictors and a final stepwise model. For stepwise models, the Wilks’ Lambda statistic and
standardized coefficients are reported to see how important a given predictor was for the model. A lower
Wilks’ Lambda corresponds to a stronger influence on the canonical classifier.

Results
As shown in Table 1, 7,539 total test cases for COVID-19 were conducted among 4,510 UK Biobank
participants (69.6 ± 8.8 years) between March 16th to May 19th 2020, either in outpatient or inpatient settings.
There were 5,329 negative cases and 2,210 positive cases. Of the positive cases, there were 996 mild and
1,214 presumptively severe disease outcomes. Baseline data from 10-14 years ago (Mean = 11.22 years) was
available for demographic, laboratory, biochemistry, and clinical indices. Similar data from 2020 was not
available. A central theme of this report is examining prediction models for the so-called full sample, but also
an entirely separate set of models for a sub-group of test cases with serology data (Table 2). Table 1 indicates
that the full cohort and serology sub-groups largely did not differ on most measures. A few significant
differences were clinically unremarkable for the serology sub-cohort and well within the range of normal
values, including lower pulse rate, several markers reflecting better kidney function, and lower total white
blood cell count due to fewer lymphocytes.
Next, each baseline variable was used to predict COVID-19 infection for a given test case. For context, model
performance was judged by: 1) the AUC as a measure of probability, where 0.5 is at-chance prediction and 1.0
is perfect prediction; and 2) the geometric mean or g-mean as a threshold metric, with a higher percentage
corresponding to greater likelihood of correctly identifying both true positives and true negatives. Among all
participants (Supplementary Table 1), as expected, model fit was poor for individual predictors that loaded
significantly (mean AUC=0.532; AUC range=0.517-0.551). For example, known risk factors included larger body
composition indices (AUC=0.526-0.548; g-mean=16.2%-29.6%), older age (AUC=0.522; g-mean=38.8%), and
markers of dysmetabolism like higher hba1c % (AUC=0.537; g-mean=13.3%) and high diastolic blood pressure
(AUC=0.519; g-mean=17.9%).
For the serology sub-group (Supplementary Table 2), several established risk factors that loaded had better
overall fit (mean AUC=0.656, AUC range=0.601-0.731). Like the full sample, examples included larger body
mass like fat-free mass (AUC=0.687; g-mean=65.0%), hba1c % (AUC=0.638; g-mean=52.8%), and diastolic
blood pressure (AUC=0.633; g-mean=55.2%). Some unexpected factors included total protein (AUC=0.662;
65.8%) and testosterone (AUC=0.731; g-mean=55.8%). We then tested if antibody titers to antigens of 20 rare
to common infectious pathogens could predict host immunity in 2020 to COVID-19. As shown in
Supplementary Table 3, antibody titers to 15 antigens across 12 pathogens each performed as well on
average as other non-serology predictors (mean AUC=0.653, AUC range=0.612-0.710). Specificity and

sensitivity were notable for antibody levels to the pp150 Nter antigen to human cytomegalovirus (gmean=61.0%) and U14 to Human Herpes Virus-7 (g-mean=66.1%), given their prevalence in the sample.
Next, sets of similar predictors were used to gauge how well they collectively predicted COVID-19 infection, as
listed in Table 3 and shown using ROC curves in Figure 1. A stepwise model was also used to create a classifier
that only included predictors where each provided unique predictive utility, and to minimize likelihood of
overfitting models. For the full sample (Table 3, top row), sets of predictors including the stepwise model were
able to identify COVID-19 negative and positive test cases up to 96.1% and 23.8% of the time respectively.
Supplementary Table 4 (top row) illustrates that the stepwise model included triglycerides, body mass, age,
ethnicity, and other known risk factors for COVID-19. Importantly, for the serology sub-group (Table 3, bottom
row), forced entry models showed worse performance compared to the same models among the full sample,
except for the biochemistry set. This suggests that small sample size for the serology sub-group did not lead to
model overfitting. While the forced entry serology model itself is likely overfitted, the stepwise model loaded
15 predictors and performed well (g-mean=0.920). As shown in Supplementary Table 4 (bottom row),
predictors that loaded in the stepwise model included antibody titers for antigens of several common
pathogens (e.g., human cytomegalovirus, C. trachomatis), lipid markers, age, white and red cell counts, and
testosterone. Due to potential concerns with model overfitting, the stepwise model was re-run with only
predictors that had individually loaded significantly in forced entry models (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).
This stepwise model had 10 variables and achieved a g-mean of 85.4%, suggesting that stepwise models were
not overfitted.
Separately, another set of analyses determined how each baseline predictor could predict which of the 2,210
positive COVID-19 cases had a mild or severe disease course. For context, 45% and 55% of test cases were
mild or severe respectively. Among all positive test cases (Supplementary Table 5), significant predictors
showed a trade-off between better sensitivity or specificity and were only modestly useful (AUC mean and
range=0.536, 0.524-0.572). Similarly, for the serology sub-group, Supplementary Table 6 shows that only
alanine aminotransferase and neutrophil count significantly predicted disease severity. For serology data
itself, Supplementary Table 7 indicates that the only significant predictors were U14 antigen to human
herpesvirus 7 (AUC=0.729; g-mean=0.600) and JC VP1 antigen to human JC polyomavirus (AUC=0.671; gmean=0.591). Table 4 shows the relative predictive value of groups of predictors for whether a COVID-19
infection would be severe. Figure 1 shows the ROC curves for model fit. Supplementary Table 8 illustrates that
the stepwise model included only alanine aminotransferase, age in years, and monocyte count. For the
serology sub-group, despite strong concerns about model overfitting, the AUC and g-mean were similarly
modest compared to the full sample, except for the stepwise model that performed noticeably better
(AUC=0.803; g-mean=0.724). As shown in Supplementary Table 8, this model had only 2 predictors: antibody
response to two antigens for two diseases (HTLV-1 gag for HTLV-1 and JC VP1 for Human Polyomavirus JCV).

Discussion
The objectives of this study were to determine if baseline data from 2006-2010 could predict which older
adults would develop COVID-19 in 2020, and if an infection was mild or presumptively severe due to being at
hospital. In summary, using a permutation-based LDA approach, we developed separate risk profiles that did

well at predicting test cases that were negative or positive (stepwise g-mean=92%), and to some degree
among positive test cases whether the infection was mild or severe (stepwise g-mean=72.4%). Such profiles
would require retrospective, routine self-report, blood test panels typically collected during annual medical
wellness visits, and serology information for several antigens. As proof-of-principle that these profiles are
sensible, we confirmed as others have noted that non-white ethnicity, low socioeconomic status, larger body
mass, and alcohol use can increase infectious risk5.
Our most novel finding was that antibody titers to past infections were strong predictors of COVID-19
infection and severity, both as a group and especially in concert with established risk factors. This “virome”
may consist of beneficial and detrimental pathogens, or fine-grained efficacy of the immune system to clear
certain pathogens, that change how the immune system responds to a persistent viral challenge like COVID1910. For example, antibodies to human cytomegalovirus antigens were the strongest predictors of infection
risk in our stepwise model. Older adults with prior infection show exhaustion of the naïve T cell pool and fewer
memory versus effector cells25. This may explain why monocyte count was one of the few variables to predict
COVID-19 severity among all test cases in this study, as innate immunity must compensate for deficits in
acquired immune function. For COVID-19 severity, antibody titers to the HTLV1 virus and human JC
polyomavirus were the only predictors that loaded significantly in our stepwise model. While HTLV1 is rare,
57.5% of at least the UK Biobank sample have antibody levels that suggest prior infection with the human JC
polyomavirus. This virus can induce hemagglutination in type O blood cells26, which may in some way
influence why this blood type is protective against COVID-19 infection.
For other immunologic factors, as expected, mobilization of innate immunity was relevant to infection risk and
severity. In particular, granulocytes (e.g., neutrophils, monocytes) loaded significantly in stepwise models for
COVID-19 infection and severity, but not cytokines such as C-Reactive Protein. C-Reactive Protein has been
cited as a strong risk factor for COVID-1927. However, this marker merely reflects signaling of the acute phase
response due to systemic infection, and changes to granulocytes in circulation already reflect this response.
Although lymphopenia and suppression of humoral immunity have been noted in COVID-19, lymphocyte cell
count did not load in final stepwise models.
We also confirmed and extended the importance of age, lipids, vascular health, and socioeconomic status, but
while body mass was important it was not adiposity per se. Among mostly elderly adults in our UK Biobank
sample, age was one of the few factors to impact both infection and severity risk. Perhaps in concert,
lipoprotein metabolism changes with aging can induce hyperlipidemia, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular
disease and may increase COVID-19 infection risk28. The lack of association with anthropometric or
bioimpedance-derived fat mass was unexpected, whereas fat-free mass such as muscle and bone did load as a
factor. We speculate that more bone mineral density and somatic muscle would reflect less cardiometabolic
impairment and systemic inflammation, but mechanisms are unclear. Finally, levels of testosterone weakly
loaded as a predictive factor for who would later develop COVID-19. Sex differences favoring COVID-19
infection in men are clear, bout andropause induces less testosterone production, which normally
downregulates inflammation, and could increase COVID-19 susceptibility29.
Several major limitations should be noted. The number of UK Biobank participants with COVID-19 and
serology data is low, particularly for positive test cases. This could consequently lead to model overfitting or
misestimation. Several steps were taken to guard against this problem, including feature reduction through

LDA, bootstrapped parameter estimation to guard against parametric assumption violations, and several
cross-validation steps to maximize robustness. We also rigorously tested each predictor or set of predictors in
the main sample and serology sub-group, where we found that model fit was not overly biased in general
despite sample size differences. Nonetheless, we recognize future work must use much larger sample sizes to
verify the usefulness of serology data. Another limitation was that using test case data nested within a
participant violates the assumption of independence, which can lead to gross misestimation. While we
ameliorated this issue using permutation testing, other latent concerns with the data like type 2 error may be
present. We also chose to use LDA over other machine learning algorithms, where LDA tends to provide more
conservative estimates. This was intentional, because it is still largely unknown how risk factors alone or
additively reflect overall risk for COVID-19 infection and disease severity. Finally, we only looked at the so
called main effects of all predictors instead of complex interactions, such as darker skin, vitamin D levels, and
COVID-19 infection risk. Such interactions were beyond the scope of this report, but may be promising
avenues to explore in future studies.

Conclusions
In summary, this study systematically used retrospective data in a large community cohort to predict who
would develop COVID-19 and if the disease course was presumptively severe. Despite baseline data having
been collected 10-14 years ago, we achieved excellent to encouraging results by combining several sets of
established and novel risk factors together. It is especially interesting that serological data performed as well
as or better than other data types. Future work should leverage markers of host immunity to inform what may
happen when the host is challenged by COVID-19.

Figure and Table Legends
Figure 1. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves illustrating the relative classifier performance of various sets of
predictors. Outcomes of interest were COVID-19 infection risk and whether an infection was mild or severe. Two
separate sets of analyses were done for the full tested sample and a sub-group of participants with serology data. Test
statistics for predictors are provided in Tables 3 and 4.
Table 1. Blood pressure (BP); high-density lipoprotein (HDL); low-density lipoprotein (LDL). A summary and comparison
of data among either all participant test cases or a sub-group of test cases that also had non COVID-19 serology.
Contemporary COVID-19 testing data has no shading. All retrospective baseline data has “gray” shading. Values are in
Mean ± SD, percentages, or frequency. P values less than .05 were considered significant and applicable predictors and
indices are bolded.
Table 2. Antibody levels are specific to each antigen and expressed in Median Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) units.
Seroprevalence of at least the main UK Biobank cohort was estimated on samples from 9,695 randomized participants,
as described in white papers (see Methods). The “gray” and “white” shading are used to distinguish between pathogens
and their respective antigens. *CagA levels are based on roughly half of the original sample due to a technical lab error.
Table 3. Area Under the Curve (AUC); Confidence Interval (CI); Geometric Mean (G-Mean). Non-parametric
bootstrapping (1000 iterations, 95% CI) was used for robust estimation. P values less than .05 were considered
significant. “Blue” and “white” shading are used to distinguish between predictors that loaded for a given model. *Due
to several variables representing the same construct (i.e., being multicollinear), body composition consisted of: wholebody water mass; whole-body fat mass; whole-body non-fat mass (i.e., muscle, bone).
Table 4. Area Under the Curve (AUC); Confidence Interval (CI); Geometric Mean (G-Mean). Non-parametric
bootstrapping (1000 iterations, 95% CI) was used for robust estimation. P values less than .05 were considered
significant. “Orange” and “white” shading are used to distinguish between predictors that loaded for a given model.
*Due to several variables representing the same construct (i.e., being multicollinear), body composition consisted of:
whole-body water mass; whole-body fat mass; whole-body non-fat mass (i.e., muscle, bone). ^= Due to the full serology
panel of 44 antibody titers exceeding degrees of freedom, titers for 6 antigens were excluded for pathogens with the
lowest estimated prevalence in the cohort (HIV, HCV, HTLV-1).

Supplemental Text 1.
To reiterate, the main objectives of this report are to use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for probabilistic determination via naïve Bayesian
classification of: 1) a two-class grouping defined as a positive vs. negative COVID-19 test case; and 2) a two-class grouping nested within positive
COVID-19 tests, defined as a test case occurring in a hospital vs. non-hospital setting. For positive tests, these settings are considered as proxies for
mild vs. severe COVID-19 disease status. Because two or more test cases could be nested within a given participant, this would normally violate
independence and potentially invalidate results. While one could use a single random test case per participant, this reduces sample size and does
not represent real world data and within-subject variability (e.g., changes in COVID-19 status or infection severity). Thus, for estimation robust to
non-independence, we used Mundry and Sommer’s permuted LDA approach 22. The unit of randomization across participants was a grouping of all
test cases originally nested in a given participant. The null hypothesis was that a given LDA model with randomized data would not perform better
than the original non-randomized data in 95% of permutations. As recommended, 1,000 permutations were run for each model using macros
provided by the authors and Python scripting for automation. To ensure that models were stable and generalizable, we used a typical “holdout”
method of 70% and 30% respectively for the training and test samples23.
As discussed in the main text, forced entry models were first conducted for each predictor, and then among sets of similar predictors (e.g.,
demographics, vital signs). It was known from the outset that model overfitting would likely occur when a predictor set had dozens of features
(e.g., biochemistry). This procedure was done for two reasons: 1) to show clinicians, researchers, and policymakers how a set of common features
would discriminate COVID-19 groups in ideal circumstances, where in some cases model overfit is frankly likely; and 2) to contrast such models with
the comparable or superior performance of stepwise models that had substantial feature reduction and enough n > p that model overfit was
guarded against.
We now explain why LDA was used. Foremost, prediction models derived using LDA are straightforward to interpret by a general audience, which is
appropriate for the journal in question. For example, the Wilks’ Lambda statistic allows a clear interpretation for how well a given predictor
distinguishes between classes and its directionality (e.g., higher age in years predicts increased likelihood of positive COVID-19 classification).
Equally important, LDA creates models that maximally separate classes of interest, where a new observation’s data can be used to determine
which class that observation would belong in. Since it is of central importance to have equally valid diagnostic assessment for who is and is not at
risk for COVID-19 or if a positive would have a mild or severe infection, LDA is most appropriate. As a generative, supervised learning classification
technique, LDA is also best used in complex datasets with high dimensionality composed of a few to hundreds of features per data category, where
it can remove most redundant or dependent features that do not maximize model fit. Reducing the feature set size reduces the risk of model
overfitting20,21. This procedure minimizes the High Dimensional, Low Sample Size (i.e., p>>N, or “small n, big p”) problem20 by reducing the
22

likelihood of the within-class covariance matrix approaching singularity30 and leading to instability of parameter estimation.
LDA has several key assumptions that we wish to address. LDA is relatively robust to overfitting provided there is a relative lack of outliers,
multivariate normality and lack of multicollinearity, and independence of data values between participants. To begin, UK Biobank removes extreme
values during data quality control before posting datasets to their data showcase 12. We further log-transformed all quantitative variables to
normalize distributions and “bring in” outliers defined as data points >3SD from the mean. As described in the main text, we also removed
biochemistry variables that were multicollinear (e.g., direct vs. total bilirubin). While some antigens of the same pathogen approached
multicollinearity, removing them from feature selection led to identical results and thus they were kept in. Participant-level data was not
dependent on data from other participants. To be clear, however, multiple observations were nested within a given participant and would violate
independence. Because the permutation LDA testing randomizes which participants have a group of one to several COVID-19 test cases, however,
these models are robust to non-independence.
While other machine learning techniques are also appropriate for classification, we discuss why they were not used. Regarding logistic regression,
this technique is attractive because it has no distribution assumptions. However, it assumes observations are independent. This does not occur
with COVID-19 testing, in which a participant will often have multiple test cases. Logistic regression also requires a large numbers of observations
to provide reliable estimates. Finally, it does not produce robust models for well-separate types of classes. As there are very clear immunologic
differences that determine if someone has or does not have COVID-19, and a clear demarcation between mild vs. severe symptom presentation,
we believe logistic regression model estimations might be inflated and thus less accurate. Finally, despite their methodological differences, LDA and
logistic regression may perform the same with real data31, where LDA may be more conservative and was one of our goals for this proof-ofprinciple study.
More complex algorithms vs. LDA were also not considered due to feature complexity, the need for transparent model estimates, and sample size.
First, in the dataset there are many features present for biochemistry markers, antibody load to specific antigens, and to a lesser degree immune
factors. Data reduction is therefore important to determine which features are most useful for COVID-19 data and should receive attention. By
contrast, clustering methods are not suitable because the dimensionality space is too high and model fit is likely to be poor. For newer machine
learning techniques, such as deep learning, it is often unclear what set of features are selected or their relative contribution when a given
prediction is made. This is unacceptable for predicting COVID-19 infection or severity risk. For researchers, it is unknown how various risk factors
converge to affect risk and this information is necessary to better understand underlying mechanisms. In population health or the clinic, certain
features have prohibitive time or cost constraints (e.g., body compartment imaging; ordering one versus multiple antigen tests). More importantly,
it is critical for clinicians, policy makers, or other stakeholders to point out which exact features led or would lead to a predicted outcome. Finally,
deep learning, support vector machines (SVM), and similar approaches also require much larger sample sizes to train and adapt a classifier to
23

produce robust estimates. By comparison, our dataset only had several thousand testing datapoints in the “full” sample and just over one-hundred
in the sub-group that had serological data.
We recognize that LDA has several limitations and used non-parametric estimation to minimize these issues. To begin, using simulation data, LDA
performs comparably to logistic regression when predictor distributions are normal or near normal, but has worse fit when there are clear
normality violations32. While we log-transformed quantitative measures with appreciable skewness (>3SD), normality nonetheless remained a
concern, particularly for the serology sub-group that had 124 observations. To reduce potential problems, bootstrapping24 was used (95% CI, 1000
iterations) to estimate model coefficients. This allows unbiased estimation of generalized absolute error, taking into account potential model
overfit by substantially varying training and test sets from the selected sample. Nevertheless, with the serology sub-group, the small n, big p
problem may still be a concern. Regularized LDA has been a popular choice to overcome this issue of within-class covariance singularity, where
cross-validation presents a reasonable solution33. Due to computation problems in tandem with bootstrapping, we used a simple “leave-one-out”
approach with bootstrap estimates.

Area Under the Curve (AUC); Confidence Interval (CI); Geometric Mean (G-Mean). Specificity and sensitivity are the likelihood of correctly detecting when
COVID-19 infection for a test case was negative or positive respectively. G-Mean is the degree to which a given predictor correctly predicts both true negatives
26

and true positives for COVID-19 infection. “Blue” and “white” shading are used to better visualize predictors within a set of similar variables. P values less than
.05 were considered significant and applicable predictors and statistics are bolded.

Area Under the Curve (AUC); Confidence Interval (CI); Geometric Mean (G-Mean). Specificity and sensitivity are the likelihood of correctly detecting if COVID-19
infection for a test case was negative or positive respectively. G-Mean is the degree to which a given antigen correctly predicts both true negatives and true
positives for COVID-19 infection. “Blue” and “white” shading are used to better visualize antigens specific to a given pathogen. P values less than .05 were
considered significant and applicable antigens and statistics are bolded. *The CagA antigen was excluded from analysis due to roughly half of sample analyte
values being lost to lab error.

Wilks’ λ represents the relative strength of a given predictor in contributing to the final model fit. Seroprevalence is the proportion of participants whose assay
values were high enough such that they were considered positive for having a given disease. “Blue” and “white” shading are used to distinguish between
predictors that loaded for a given model.

Wilks’ λ represents the relative strength of a given predictor in contributing to the final model fit. Seroprevalence is the proportion of participants whose assay
values were high enough such that they were considered positive for having a given disease. "Orange" and "white" shading are used to better visualize each
predictor that loaded into a given model.
