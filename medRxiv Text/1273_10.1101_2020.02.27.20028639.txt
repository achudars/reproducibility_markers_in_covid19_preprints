Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading in China
and more than 30 countries over last two months. COVID-19 has multiple
characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including high infectivity during
incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed number of confirmed
cases, and the intervention effects of implemented quarantine and control measures.
Method: We develop a Susceptible, Un-quanrantined infected, Quarantined infected,
Confirmed infected (SUQC) model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and
explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures, which is more
suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models.
Results: The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed
infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan),
China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We found that, before
January 30th, 2020, all these regions except Beijing had a reproductive number R  1 ,
and after January 30th, all regions had a reproductive number R  1 , indicating that the
quarantine and control measures are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19.
The confirmation rate of Wuhan estimated by our model is 0.0643, substantially lower
than that of Hubei excluding Wuhan (0.1914), and that of China excluding Hubei
(0.2189), but jumps to 0.3229 after Feb 12th when clinical evidence was adopted in
new diagnosis guidelines. The number of un-quarantined infected cases in Wuhan on
February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines to 334 on February 21th, 2020.

After fitting the model with data as of February 21th, 2020, we predict that the end time
of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei is around late March, around mid March for China
excluding Hubei, and before early March 2020 for the four tier-one cities. A total of
80,511 individuals are estimated to be infected in China, among which 49,510 are from
Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei (excluding Wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions
of China (excluding Hubei). Note that the estimates are from a deterministic ODE
model and should be interpreted with some uncertainty.
Conclusion: We suggest that rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept
before early March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late
March in Hubei. The model can also be useful to predict the trend of epidemic and
provide quantitative guide for other countries in a high risk of outbreak, such as South
Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran.

INTRODUCTION
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was initially identified in midDecember 2019 in Wuhan, China [1,2]. The earliest patients in Wuhan are related to
exposure from a seafood market. Later, the number of patients grows drastically due to
human-to-human transmission [3]. The incubation period of COVID-19 is reported to
be 3-7 days, at most 14 days, which varies greatly among patients [2]. The novel
coronavirus is believed to be infectious during incubation period when no symptoms
are shown on the patients [4], an important characteristics differentiating COVID-19
from its close relative SARS. Considerable measures have been implemented to control
the outbreak in Wuhan and China, mainly by quarantine to reduce transmission. On Jan
23rd, 2019, Wuhan restricted travel outside the city. Any person exposed to COVID-19
is required to perform a self-isolation for 14 days. Around Jan 25rd, 2019, nucleic acid
kit was developed to diagnose the patients. On Feb 12th, 2020, clinical diagnosis was
used to assist the confirmation of infection in Hubei province. Nonetheless, COVID-19
has spread to all provinces of China and more than 30 other countries in the last two
months [5,6].
COVID-19 has three features that make it hard to describe with the existing epidemic

models including SIR, SEIR etc [7,8]. Firstly, COVID-19 has a relatively long
incubation period, which causes a time delay between real dynamic and the dailyobserved case numbers. Secondly, the epidemic trend heavily depends on multiple
artificial factors, including local medical resources, quarantine measures, and the
efficiency of confirmation approaches, which should be explicitly modeled. For
example, the outbreak is more severe in Wuhan compared to other cities in China that
constrains the medical resources, therefore the infected need a longer time to be
confirmed and reported in the official released numbers. This potentially leads to a
larger difference between real and reported infected cases in Wuhan than in other places.
This could also explain why a sudden increase of confirmed infected cases was
observed when clinical diagnosis was adopted in confirmation in Wuhan. Lastly, the
quarantine measures are widely implemented, and the quarantined have a lower chance
to infect the susceptible individuals. This is critical for controlling the spread across
China.
The characteristics of COVID-19 outbreak and control are distinct from existing
infectious diseases, and the existing epidemic models cannot be applied to describe the
observed data directly. We thus propose to use a simple SUQC model (Susceptible, Unquarantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected). SUQC distinguishes
the infected individuals to be un-quarantined, quarantined but not confirmed, and
confirmed. Among the three types, the confirmed number is the data we can directly
observe from the official released report. Only un-quarantined infected have ability to
infect susceptible individuals and affect the development of the epidemic. In our
proposed model, the quarantine rate parameter is used to quantify the strength of
quarantine policy on the development of epidemics, and the confirmation rate
parameter is used to measure the efficiency of confirmation based on the released data.
The two parameters can be solved from fitting the observed confirmed cases over time.
Note that the model contains only four variables and three parameters to model both
artificial factors and characteristics of epidemics using the data we can directly observe.
We expect that the simplified model will not over fit the data given the short time span,
but will adequately characterize the essential dynamics.
We apply the SUQC model to the daily released numbers of confirmed cases in Wuhan
city, Hubei province (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier

20th, 2020 to Feb 21th, 2020 released by the National Health Commission of the
People's Republic of China (see Table S1). The parameters in the model, such as the
quarantine rate, are time varying, and thus we divided data into different stages
(according to the changes of measures during the epidemic), and we assumed the
parameters within each stage are relatively stable. We defined time before Jan 30, 2020
as stage Ⅰ, and after Jan 30th, 2020 as stage Ⅱ. To guarantee enough data points
within the two stages, the start and end of the stages may vary by one or two days.
Wuhan has recently undergone stricter measures of quarantine and transmission
limiting, and clinical diagnosis was adopted after Feb 12th, we thus further did a stage
III analysis of the dynamics in Wuhan using data after Feb 13th.
Remarkable difference among trends inferred from three-stage data
Figure 1 shows the inference and prediction of epidemic dynamics of Wuhan using
stage Ⅰ, Ⅱ and Ⅲ data respectively. The first 15 daily data points (from Jan 28th
to Feb 11th) of stage Ⅱ were used to fit the model and infer parameters. The following
10 daily data points were used as test data for evaluating the performance of the model.
In Figure 1(B), the blue curve presents the model fitting result; blue dots present the
predicted numbers of the confirmed infections with the fitted model; and red dots are
the observed number of the confirmed infections. Note that the reported numbers of
confirmed are based on nucleic acid diagnosis before Feb 12th; both results of nucleic
acid and clinical diagnosis are provided from Feb 12th to 14th, and only the total
confirmed numbers of the two diagnoses are provided from Feb 15th to 21th. By
comparing with three daily data points of the nucleic acid diagnosis, we can see the
fitted model predicts the trend well. The predicted numbers of all infected ( I (t ) ) are
also plotted in Figure 1(B). We can see big gap between the predicted numbers of total
infections and the predicted numbers of confirmed infections in Wuhan. Clinical
diagnosis is adopted by Wuhan local medical agency as an additional diagnosis criterion
after Feb 12th, increasing the confirmation rate and causing a big boost of the number
of confirmed infections. Note that a proportion of the total infected still remains
unidentified even with clinical diagnosis.
With the inferred parameters, we further plot the long-term predictions of the numbers
of total infected ( I ), un-quarantined infected ( U ), quarantined infected ( Q ) and
cumulative Confirmed infections ( C ) in Wuhan (Figure 1(A)). The end time (increment

of confirmed infections equals zero) is predicted to be 147 days from Jan 28th, 2020.
The total number of infected individuals is 62,577 (Table 1).
We can do a similar analysis using stage Ⅰ data of Wuhan. The stage Ⅰ data is
informative for predicting the epidemic trend assuming no rigorous quarantine and
control measures. The first 10 daily data points (from Jan 20th) were used to infer the
parameters. The rest data points were used to test the performance of the model (Figure
1(C-D)). As clearly seen in Figure 1(C), the predicted numbers of C (t ) and I (t )
increase dramatically, which are far beyond the observed numbers after Jan 21. The
number of total infected can be as large as 8,923,823, and the epidemic lasts for a much
longer time (328 days, see Table 1). The dramatic difference between predictions from
stage Ⅰ and stage Ⅱ data indicates the preventing measures and quarantines, such
as travel restrict, are very efficient in controlling the outburst of the epidemic.
Since more strict quarantine and traffic control measures were executed recently to
inhibit the infection of COVID-19 in Wuhan and clinical diagnosis was adopted after
Feb 12th, we also analyzed the stage Ⅲ data (from Feb 13th). The estimated
quarantine rate is 0.6185, much higher than that of 0.3917 estimated based on stage Ⅱ
data. The total number of infected individuals is estimated to be 49,510, indicating a
further acceleration of the epidemic end (Table 1).
Similar analysis was accomplished on stage Ⅰ and Ⅱ data of Hubei province
(excluding Wuhan), the whole country (excluding Hubei), and four tier-1 cities in China
(Figures 2-3, S1-S4, Tables 1-2). Overall, the model predictions are in high accuracy.
We see similar trends in these regions: the predicted numbers of infected are distinct
between results from the two stage data, indicating the necessity and efficiency of
quarantine and control measures. We note that even with stage Ⅰ data, Beijing have
a reproductive number smaller than 1 (Figure S1, Table 2, 0.8840), indicating an earlystage prompt and effective response to COVID-19.
Confirmation rate. From Figures 2-3, S1-S4, we notice that the difference between
C (t ) and I (t ) in Wuhan is the biggest. Wuhan has the most infected individuals than

any other places in China (more than 50 %), highly beyond the limit of local clinical
resources, leading to a long waiting time for confirmation, and the lowest confirmation

rate of 0.0643 in Wuhan, compared with 0.1914 of Hubei (excluding Wuhan), 0.2189
of China (excluding Hubei), 0.2680 of Beijing , 0.2846 of Shanghai, 0.2871 of
Guangzhou, and 0.2599 of Shenzhen. As predicted by the model, 26,810 quarantined
infections haven't been confirmed in Wuhan by Feb 11th, 2020. The confirmation rate
of Wuhan increases to 0.3229 (Table 1) after Feb 12th when clinical diagnosis was
adopted in Wuhan.
Quarantine rate and reproductive number. At stage Ⅱ, Wuhan has the smallest
quarantine rate (0.3917) compared to the other six regions (all close to or larger than
0.5). This leads to a larger reproductive number ( R   /  1 ). The reproductive number
of Wuhan decreases from 0.7575 at stage Ⅱ to 0.4797 at stage Ⅲ . Based on
reproductive numbers, the epidemic all over China is apparently under control.
Un-quarantined. The un-quarantined individuals are the source of new infection.
Using stage Ⅱ data, the estimated number of U (t ) individuals in Wuhan (Figure
1(A)) on Feb 12th is still as high as 3,509. The person-to-person transmission will last
for more than two months to mid May 2020. However, estimated with stage Ⅲ data,
the quarantine rate of Wuhan increases to 0.6185 and the un-quarantined infected
individuals decreases to 334 on Feb 21th, 2020 (Figure 1(E)).
PREDICTION S
After fitting the model with the recent data from stage Ⅱ and stage Ⅲ (for Wuhan),
we make a series of predictions about future dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in
China.



The end time of the epidemic (with zero new confirmed infections as the criterion)
of Wuhan and Hubei (excluding Wuhan) is around late-March, and around midMarch of China. The end time of the four first-tier cities, Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou and Shenzhen, is before early March. The end time with zero unquarantined infections as a criterion is usually earlier than that with zero new
confirmed infections.



The final reported infected number of the whole country is predicted to be 80,511
individuals, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan and 17,679 from Hubei

(excluding Wuhan), and the rest 13,322 are from other regions of China.



Given the inferred end times, rigorous quarantine and control measures should be
kept before March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late
March in China (including Hubei). We should further point out that, the real
confirmed infections in Beijing (Figure S1(B)), Shanghai (Figure S2(B)) and
Shenzhen (Figure S4(B)) are a bit larger than the predicted values by our model.
This is likely caused by the recent return-to-work tide after the traditional Chinese
Spring festival.

DISCUSSION
We developed a model SUQC for the epidemic dynamics and control of COVID19. SUQC uses four variables and as few parameters as possible to avoid over-fitting
the data, while adequately characterizes the epidemic dynamics. The model is different
from the well-known epidemic SEIR model in the following aspects: (1) the infected
individuals are classified into un-quarantined, quarantined and confirmed. And only the
un-quanrantined can infect the susceptible individuals; While in SEIR, all the infected
are infectious; (2) the quarantine rate is a parameter in SUQC to explicitly model the
effects of quarantine and control measures; (3) SUQC distinguishes the confirmed
infected individuals (observed data) and the total infected individuals, and the
parameter confirmation rate is affected by medical resources and the sensitivity of
diagnosis methods. Overall, SUQC is developed to characterize the dynamics of
COVID-19, and is more suitable for analysis and prediction than adopting existing
epidemic models. However, we should emphasize that the estimates of SUQC are from
a deterministic ODE model without confidence intervals, and the uncertainty from
various sources will be taken into account in future study.
SUQC is applied to the daily released data of China to analyze the dynamics of COVID19 outbreak, and demonstrates an accurate prediction of the trends with the test data.
COVID-19 has currently spread to more than 30 countries. Some countries, such as,
South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran are in their early stage of an outbreak, and the
governments are attempting to minimize further spread. SUQC can serve as a useful
tool for quantifying parameters and variables concerning the effects of quarantine or

confirmation methods on the epidemic, and further provide guidance on the control of
the outbreak in these countries.
METHODS
SUQC model
SUQC takes into account the following novel epidemic features of COVID-19: (1) the
epidemic has an infection probability during the incubation (presymptomatic) period;
(2) various isolation measures are used to control the development of the epidemic; (3)
the main data source is the daily number of confirmed infections released in the official
report, which is affected by the detection method and has a delay between the real
infected and confirmed infected number. Four variables related to the features are used
to model the flows of people between four possible states:
S  S (t ) , the number of susceptible individuals with no resistance to disease in the

population. S is the same as that in existing infectious disease models, e.g. SIR and
SEIR.
U  U (t ) , the number of infected and un-quarantined individuals that can be either

presymptomatic or symptomatic. Different from E in the SEIR model, U are
infectious, and can render a susceptible to be un-quarantined infected.
Q  Q(t ) , the number of quarantined infected individuals. The un-quarantined

infected become Quarantined infected by isolation or hospitalization, and lose the
ability of infecting the susceptible.
C  C (t ) , the number of confirmed infected cases. The number of confirmed

infections is released by the official agency or media, which may be the only variable
with observation that we can access. Note that C is usually smaller than the number
of real infected individuals, due to the limited sensitivity of diagnosis methods. The
duration of incubation can also cause a time delay of confirmation. Nevertheless, C is
also the number useful for monitoring and predicting the trend of epidemic dynamics.
Besides the aforementioned variables, we have a composite variable
I (t )  U (t )  Q(t )  C (t ) , representing the real cumulative number of infected individuals

at time t . The limitation of detection methods and the medical resources can greatly
delay the confirmation process, insomuch the confirmation proportion C / I is less
than 1 and time-varying.
R , the number of removed individuals, is not included in the model as in the

SIR/SEIR models. Once the infected are quarantined, we assume their probability of

infecting susceptible individuals is zero, and thus no matter the infected are recovered
or not, they have no effect on the dynamics of the epidemic system.
The model comprises the following independent parameters:
 is the infection rate, the mean number of new infected caused by an un-quarantined

infected per day.   [0, ) .
 1 is the quarantine rate for an un-quarantined infected being quarantined, with

the range  1  [0,1] . The quarantines can be centralized isolation, self isolation,
hospitalization and so on. It is a parameter representing multi-resource measures to
reduce infection caused by U .
 2 , the confirmation rate of Q , is the probability that the quarantined infected are

identified to be confirmatory cases by a conventional method, such as the laboratory
diagnosis, with the range  2  [0,1] .  2 is affected by the incubation period duration,
medical conditions, accuracy of laboratory tests, and other artificial factors such as the
time delay between case confirmation and the official release.  2 is time-varying since
the change of diagnosis criterion and

the improvement of nucleic acid test can

accelerate the confirming process.
 is the subsequent confirmation rate of those infected that are not confirmed by

the conventional methods, but confirmed with some additional tests. If no other special
approaches used,  is set to 0. Combing two sources of confirmation approaches
   2  (1   2 ) is the total confirmation rate.

 is the confirmation rate of the un-quarantined infected who can be identified as

confirmed infections without being quarantined.
We thus set up a set of ODE equations to model the dynamics of an infectious disease
and the control by artificial factors (Eqn. 1). In the model, U goes directly to C , or
go through Q indirectly. Actually, the former can be viewed as a special case of the
later with zero delay time during Q  C . Thus we delete the direct way and simplified
the model as Eqn. 2.

Among the four variables of the model, the number of cumulative confirmed infections,
C (t ) , is usually the only variable with daily observed data to be used for model fitting

and parameter inference.
The initial value of susceptible individuals S (0) is approximately equal to the
population size. The initial confirmed infections C (0) is the number of infected
obtained from the official report. Note that the initial time of the ODE system does not
have to be at the beginning of the epidemic, and can start from any time point during
the break of COVID-19.
Some parameters can be calculated beforehand using the public data directly. We
calculate the infection rate  using the confirmed infected numbers of Wuhan city
during Jan 20th and Jan 27th. By fitting an exponential curve, we get   0.2967 .

Confirmed infected numbers during this time interval may be less biased and represent
natural character of COVID-19, while confirmed numbers are small and fluctuating at
early stages before Jan 20th and are affected by strict quarantine measures in later stages.
The parameter  is hard to estimate accurately. The values estimated by using
different methods or different data sets range from 0.3 to 0.5 [9,10,11]. Luckily in
SUQC an accurate value of  is not necessary; the overall infection ability measured
by the reproductive number R   /  1 as a compound parameter is sensitive in
parameter optimization, and thus the bias of  can be balanced by  1 .
Other free parameters and initial values, including  1 ,  , U (0) and Q (0) , are
estimated by fitting the daily time series of confirmed infections to the model. Denote
Cˆ  f ( 1 ,  ,U 0 , Q0 ) as the expected daily time series of confirmed infections provided

by the model (Eqn 2), which was solved by the fourth order Runge-Kutta method with
given values of  1 ,  , U (0) and Q (0) . Define the loss function,
err ( ,  1 ,U 0 , Q0 ) || C  Cˆ || 2

（3）

The loss function is then optimized with the interior-point method implemented in the
MATLAB function fmincon to infer the parameter values. We try different initial values
in parameter optimization, and notice that the inferred parameter values are not
sensitive to the provided initial values.
Note that the loss function (Eqn 3) may give too much weight to later observations since
the cumulative case numbers are higher than earlier days. We tried another two
weighted loss functions to better integrate information across the whole epidemic (Eqns
S1 and S2 in the Supplementary information), and compared the prediction of the loss
functions. The prediction seems robust on the choice of loss functions (Figures S5 and
S6). In practice the loss functions may be chosen by their performances evaluated on
the test data.
