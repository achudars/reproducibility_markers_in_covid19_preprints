Summary

63

Background

64

Due to the large number of patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), rapid

65

diagnosis at the emergency department (ED) is of critical importance. In this study we

66

have developed a flowchart based on two well-known diagnostic methods: the

67

‘corona-score’ and the ‘CO-RADS’. This flowchart can be used in hospitals that use

68

chest-CT, instead of chest X-ray, for COVID-19 suspected patients at the ED.

69

Methods

70

ED patients (n=1904) from the Jeroen Bosch Hospital, Amphia Hospital,

71

HagaHospital, Elisabeth TweeSteden Hospital, Bernhoven Hospital and Slingeland

72

Hospital were included. A laboratory-based ‘corona-score’, without radiology, called

73

the ‘lab-corona-score’ was combined with a chest-CT based radiology scoring system

74

(CO-RADS), to develop a flowchart. The performance was assessed by

75

sensitivity/specificity analyses using the RT-PCR outcome or the physician’s final

76

diagnosis as golden standard.

77

Results

78

Out of the 1904 patients, 611 (32.1%) patients tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2

79

virus. The lab-corona-score alone had an AUC of 0.86, a sensitivity of 87% and a

80

specificity of 88% using cut-off values of 0-2 (negative) and 8-10 (positive). Of 255

81

patients, from the Amphia and Slingeland Hospitals, a CO-RADS score was

82

determined. The flowchart, which combined the ‘CO-RADS’ with the ‘lab-corona-

83

score’, was developed based on data from Slingeland Hospital (sensitivity 97%,

84

specificity 96%). Hereafter, the performance of the flowchart was validated using an

85

independent dataset from Amphia hospital, and reached a sensitivity of 98% and

86

specificity of 93%. A decision could be made in 79% of the patients, which was

87

correct in 95% of the cases.

88

Conclusion

89

This flowchart, based on radiology (CO-RADS) and clinical chemistry parameters

90

(lab-corona-score), results in a rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 at the ED.

INTRODUCTION

93

The outbreak of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus in March has resulted in a huge

94

increase in the number of patients at the emergency department (ED). ‘Corona-virus

95

disease 2019’ (COVID-19) is diagnosed by the detection of viral genetic material by

96

real-time reserve transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, it

97

takes considerable time before the result of the RT-PCR is available, in which time

98

the clinicians need to take decisions regarding treatment and isolation protocols. In

99

order to make a well-balanced decision whether a patient is infected with COVID-19,

100

the treating ED physician has to combine the clinical presentation, radiology and

101

clinical chemistry parameters, which therefore require a standardized interpretation

102
103

In March 2020 the CO-RADS (COVID-19 Reporting and Data System) was

104

introduced: a method for standardized documentation and risk stratification of a

105

chest-CT for all patients with a suspected COVID-19 infection.(1) The goal of the

106

classification is to improve the communication between physicians, facilitate the

107

comparison of results between institutions and to provide a basis for scientific

108

research. The CO-RADS methodology should be mainly used in a medium-to-high

109

prevalence of COVID-19.(1) In addition, authors of CORADS diagnostics studies have

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.29.20218743; this version posted November 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

110

suggested to add routine laboratory parameters to improve the performance of the

111

CORADS classification system.(2)

112
113

COVID-19 patients often present with a moderately elevated c-reactive protein

114

(CRP), an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LD), elevated ferritin, lymfocytopenia and

115

a normal neutrophil count. (3, 4)

116
117

The interpretation of clinical chemistry parameters is an excellent way to differentiate

118

between a viral and bacterial pneumonia. Based on the situation in March 2020, the

119

‘corona-score’ was developed (www.corona-score.com). The corona-score has

120

received

121

implemented in multiple hospitals worldwide.(5-7) The corona-score is a diagnostic

122

algorithm that, based on clinical chemistry parameters, age, sex and a crude

123

interpretation of the chest X-ray, can determine with high accuracy whether a patient

124

at the ED is positive or negative for COVID-19.(8) The scoring system and chosen

125

cut-off points for each variable have been optimized using artificial intelligence. In

126

order to combine the corona-score with the CO-RADS classification, the points for

127

the radiological interpretation have been removed from the corona-score, resulting in

128

the so-called ‘lab-corona-score’.

In this retrospective multicenter research we investigated whether combining the

positive from negative patients at the ED.

Patient population

136

In this retrospective multicenter study the performance of the ‘lab-corona-score’

137

separately, and in combination with the CO-RADS score, was investigated. For the

138

performance of the lab-corona-score separately all ED patients were included that

139

received a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test. Patients were excluded if there were missing

140

clinical chemistry parameters due to a (pre-)analytical error, an invalid RT-PCR result

141

or a hemolytic blood sample (Figure 1A). In total 1904 patients were included: Jeroen

145

TweeSteden Hospital (n=248, 8-30 April, 2020) (Figure 1A).

146
147

Laboratory measurements

148

Venous blood was drawn from all patients that presented at the ED with symptoms

149

that could be related to COVID-19. A nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab was

150

taken for the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test. These were performed by the department of

151

medical microbiology at the institute using the following methods: Thermofisher

152

7500SDS Thermofisher and Roche cobas-6800 for E-and RdRP gene (Amphia

153

Hospital), Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 on a GeneXpert DX System

159

Clinical chemistry and hemocytometric tests were measured in the venous sample

160

from the initial presentation at the ED using the following analysers: Siemens Advia

161

Chemistry XPT and Advia 2120i (Jeroen Bosch Hospital), Roche cobas-8000 and

162

Sysmex XN-6000 (Amphia Hospital), Dimension Vista 1500 and CELL-DYN Sapphire

163

(Bernhoven Hospital), Roche and Sysmex (Elisabeth TweeSteden Hospital), Roche

164

cobas-6000 and Sysmex XN-1000 (HagaHospital), and Roche CobasPro and

165

Sysmex XE-5000 (Slingeland Hospital). Due to the large variation in the ferritin

166

measurements between the platforms, the ferritin concentration by Roche was used

167

as a reference. Ferritin measurements were harmonized by multiplying the

168

concentrations measured by Siemens analysers by a factor of 1.2 (8).

169
170

Lab-corona-score

171

In order to combine the ‘corona-score’ with the CO-RADS classification we removed

172

the interpretation of the chest X-ray, resulting in the so-called ‘lab-corona-score’. In

173

this score, points are attributed to each parameter as described in Table 1. The ‘lab-

174

corona-score’ is trimmed from a minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 10.(1)

175

The result of this ‘lab-corona-score’ can be easily implemented into the electronic

176

laboratory system, so that it is automatically reported directly into the patient file.

Radiology

180

The chest-CT images were interpreted and scored according to the CO-RADS

181

classification by the radiologists of the Amphia and Slingeland Hospitals.(1) The CO-

182

RADS classification is scored from 1 to 6 (Table 2). A CO-RADS score of 1 is the

183

lowest grade of suspicion, fitting a normal chest CT-image or a non-infectious image.

184

A CO-RADS score of 5 is the highest grade of suspicion, in which chest CT-findings

185

include typical signs of COVID-19, such as multifocal and bilateral ground glass

186

consolidations which extend into the pleura, with or without consolidations.

and a Siemens Somatom Flash CT (Slingeland Hospital).

Development of the flowchart

191

For the development of the flowchart (Figure 3), based on the lab-corona-score in

192

combination with the CO-RADS score, data from hospitals were used that perform

193

routine CT-scans at the ED for each COVID-19 suspected patient. Data from

194

Slingeland Hospital (n=104) was used to design the flowchart. In designing this

195

flowchart, we evaluated for which CO-RADS scores the ‘lab-corona-score’ could

196

provide a contribution in making the correct diagnosis. The final decision of the

197

treating physician was used as a golden standard. In 5 patients with a negative RT-

198

PCR result, the treating physician concluded that the RT-PCR result was a false-

199

negative, and the patient was registered as COVID-19-positive. To validate the

200

flowchart an independent dataset was used from the Amphia Hospital (n=148). The

201

result of the RT-PCR was used as golden standard.

202
203

Statistics

204

Data were analyzed using Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corporation, VS) and SPSS (IBM,

205

Version 25.0, VS). Lab-corona-scores were compared between the two groups using

206

an unpaired t-test with a Welch correction. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered

207

statistically significant.

Ethical statement

210

This study was conducted according to the declaration of Helsinki and Guidelines for

211

Good Clinical Practice. The execution of this retrospective observational study of

212

patient records was approved by the regional Medical Research Ethics Committee

213

(METC Brabant), which declared that the use of anonymized patient data is not

214

subject to the regulations of the WMO (Dutch Medical Research Involving Human

215

Subjects Act). Consent was obtained by an opt-out agreement.

216
217

RESULTS

218

In order to combine the ‘corona-score’ with the CO-RADS classification, the

219

radiological interpretation has been removed from the corona-score, resulting in the

220

so-called ‘lab-corona-score’ (Table 1). The original corona-score can be used if chest

221

X-rays are routinely used at the ED instead of chest CT-scans (Figure 1B). The

222

performance of the ‘lab-corona-score’ has been retrospectively analyzed based on

223

1904 patients from 6 different hospitals. The prevalence of COVID-19 positive

224

patients at the ED ranged from 10% (HagaHospital) to 59% (Bernhoven Hospital,

225

Table 3). Using cut-off values for the ‘lab-corona-score’ of 0-2 (negative) and 8-10

226

(positive), the sensitivity was 87% and the specificity 88% (Table 3). In this manner, a

227

decision could be made in 61% of the patients. The area under the receiver operating

228

characteristic (AUROC) curve was 0.86 (Figure 2A). The median of the ‘lab-corona-

229

score’ in the COVID-19 negative patients was 2 (n=1293) and in the COVID-19

230

positive patients 8 (n=611, Figure 2B, p<0,001).

231
232

The flowchart was developed based on data of Slingeland Hospital (n=104). Patients

233

were classified based on their CO-RADS score (Figure 3A). Patients with a CO-

234

RADS of 1 or 2 were classified as COVID-19 negative, except if their ‘lab-corona-

235

score’ was 9-10. For patients with a CO-RADS score of 3, patients were considered

236

negative if their ‘lab-corona-score’ was 0-2. Patients with a CO-RADS score of 4

237

were classified as COVID-19 positive, except if their ‘lab-corona-score’ was 0-3. All

238

patients with a CO-RADS score of 5 were considered COVID-19 positive. The

239

flowchart obtained a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 96%. The flowchart could

240

make a decision in 85% of the patients, which was correct 97% of the times. In the 16

241

patients where no decision could be given, 4 patients were COVID-19 positive. These

242

all had a CO-RADS score of 3 with a ‘lab-corona-score’ between 4 and 10.

243
244

The performance of this flowchart was validated on an independent dataset of

245

Amphia Hospital (n=148, Figure 3B). In this analysis the result of the RT-PCR was

246

used as golden standard. If a patient that initially tested negative for COVID-19

247

tested positive within 7 days after their initial visit, this patient was considered

248

COVID-19 positive. Nonetheless, it is possible that this population still contains a

249

number of false-negative results due to incorrectly performed swabs. When running

250

this validation-population through the flowchart, 69 (47%) patients were considered

251

COVID-19 negative, of which 1 patient (1.4%) had a positive RT-PCR test. In the

252

flowchart 48 (32%) patients were considered COVID-19 positive, of which 90% had a

253

positive RT-PCR. In conclusion, the validation of the flowchart reached a sensitivity of

254

98% and a specificity of 93%. In 79% of the patients a decision could be made, which

255

corresponded with the RT-PCR result in 95% of the patients. In the 31 patients where

256

no conclusive decision could be reached by the flowchart, 6 patients tested positive

257

for SARS-CoV-2. Of these 6 patients, 5 patients had a CO-RADS of 3 (lab-corona-

258

score between 3 and 7) and 1 patient had a CO-RADS of 4 (lab-corona-score of 0).

259

The ‘lab-corona-score’ is significantly different between COVID-19 positive and

260

negative patients with a CO-RADS score of 3 or 4 (p<0.05, Figure 4A-B),

261

demonstrating the additive diagnostic value of the ‘lab-corona-score’ in combination

262

with radiology.

263
264

DISCUSSION

265

The total diagnostic accuracy of the flowchart is 95-97% and is able to diagnose

266

approximately 80% of patients, using chest-CT and routine laboratory parameters.

267

The proposed flowchart allows for a fast and accurate indication whether patients at

268

the ED with COVID-19 related symptoms are infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus or

269

not.

270

Multiple flowcharts have been proposed to support and improve triaging of COVID-19

271

suspect ED patients. For example, the Dutch Association of Medical Specialists

272

employs a flowchart based on CO-RADS classification, but the flowchart does not

273

take advantage of changes in clinical chemistry parameters in COVID-19 infected

274

patients. In addition, the use of flowcharts that rely on the outcome of SARS-CoV-2

275

RT-PCR tests are both time-consuming and complicated by the occurrence of false-

276

negative RT-PCR outcomes. Another research group has proposed the use of LD

277

and lymphocyte count as a means to assess the probability of a SARS-CoV-2

278

infection.(10) However, the use of merely these two parameters raises the possibility

279

of misclassification. For example, LD will always be relatively high in a patient

280

suffering from hemolysis and lymphopenia has numerous pathophysiological causes

281

as well. By combining a larger set of multiple laboratory parameters, this effect will be

282

largely diluted. From our results it is clear that using the lab-corona-score and the

283

CO-RADS classification provides added value as compared to using CO-RADS

284

alone. In this instance a high lab-corona-score will confirm the diagnosis if CO-RADS

285

is 4, but will it often rightfully cast doubts in case of a low lab-corona.

286
287

Our study has several strengths. To start with, the study contained data from six

288

independent Dutch hospitals that all calculated and/or reported the corona-score or

289

lab-corona-score. The development and validation of the flowchart was performed on

290

two independent datasets from different hospitals. This strongly contributes to the

291

validity and robustness of the diagnostic performance of the flow chart. Secondly, the

292

lab-corona-score is easy to implement in the laboratory information system. It can be

293

readily reported to the hospital information system, where it will be accessible to all

294

emergency physicians. This, however, will require that a standardised set of

295

laboratory parameters will be requested by ED professionals in order to calculate the

296

(lab-)corona-score. Lastly, the use of this flowchart is significantly faster than current

297

RT-PCR tests, and can therefore reduce both triage time and time to start treatment.

298
299

This study also has a set of limitations. During the development of the flowchart, the

300

medical diagnosis of the physician was used as the golden standard. However, in the

301

validation of the flowchart, the results of the RT-PCR were used as golden standard.

302

Because false-negative RT-PCR results as a result of sampling are not uncommon, it

303

is possible that a number of COVID-19 patients have been incorrectly classified as

304

negative. This could have led to an underestimation of the diagnostic performance of

305

the flow chart. A second limitation is that the use of the flowchart requires the

306

performance of a CT-scan for all suspected patients. If a hospital is unable to perform

307

a CT-scan, they will not be able to use this flowchart. In that case, we would like to

308

recommend the use of the original corona-score, with cut-off values of 0-4 and 11-

14.(8) A third limitation might be that the diagnostic accuracy of the flowchart might be

310

affected by geographical location and population characteristics, as this study was

311

performed in Dutch hospitals only.(7) Therefore we recommend that hospitals perform

312

a small local validation of the performance of the flowchart prior to implementation.

313

Lastly, as of now we have not been able to whether the performance of the flowchart

314

would be diminished when a large portion of the patients is infected by season flue

315

(influenza). However, it is unlikely that influenza leads to such drastic changes in

316

clinical chemistry parameters, such as ferritin and LD, as seen in COVID-19

317

infections.

318
319

Based on the results of this study we conclude that a flowchart based on a

320

standardised lab-corona-score and radiological CO-RADS classification is an

321

accurate and fast diagnostic tool. Because results of CT-scans and laboratory

322

parameters are rapidly available, it is possible to expeditiously assert the risk of a

323

SARS-CoV-2 infection in EDs. Moreover, the diagnostic tool also reflects the chance

324

of a RT-PCR test result possibly being false-negative. Using this flowchart it is

325

possible to quickly triage COVID-19 suspected patients, and decide on isolation

326

measures.

Figure 1. Flow chart of the study setup
(A) Patients from the emergency department (ED) of the Jeroen Bosch Hospital,
Amphia Hospital, Slingeland Hospital, HagaHospital, Elisabeth TweeSteden Hospital
and Bernhoven Hospital that received an SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, were included.
Patients with a missing or non-interpretable RT-PCR result, and patients with missing
clinical chemistry parameters, were excluded. In total 1904 patients were included, of
whom 252 (from Slingeland Hospital and Amphia Hospital) also had a CO-RADS
score. (B) If a hospital uses chest-CT scans for the triage at the ED, the left arm of
the flow chart can be used. If the ED uses chest X-ray, the corona-score can be
used.

In the ‘lab-corona-score’ the points for the interpretation of the radiological image
have been removed from the corona-score. (A) The ROC curve of the ‘lab-coronascore’, in which the area under the curve (AUC) is 0.86. (B) Box-plots of the ‘labcorona-score’ in patients with a negative and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result.
Figure 3. Diagnostic flow chart for COVID-19-suspected patients at the
emergency department
(A) The flowchart was developed based on 104 patients of the Slingeland Hospital.
The final conclusion of the treating physician was used as golden standard to
determine whether a patient was considered COVID-19 negative or positive. (B)
Hereafter, the flowchart was validated using an independent dataset of 148 COVID19-suspected patients of the Amphia Hospital. The result of the RT-PCR was used as
golden standard to determine whether a patient was considered COVID-19 negative
or positive.

Table 3. Diagnostic accuracy of the lab-corona-score per hospital.
In the lab-corona-score, only the laboratory parameters contributed to the scoring
system. The sensitivity and specificity of the lab-corona-score was determined for the
individual hospitals, as well the fraction of patients that could be classified. In this
instance, a score of 0-2 was judged as negative, while a score of 8-10 was judged as
positive. Other cut-offs could lead to a higher sensitivity or specificity, or could be
used to classify a higher number of patients.
