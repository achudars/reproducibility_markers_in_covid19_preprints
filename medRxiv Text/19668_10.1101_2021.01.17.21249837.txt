Abstract: The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) infection has resulted in an ongoing pandemic affecting
health system and economy of more than 200 countries around the world. Mathematical models are used
to predict the biological and epidemiological trends of an epidemic and develop methods for controlling
it. In this work, we use mathematical model perspective to study the role of behavior change in slowing
the spread of the COVID-19 disease in Saudi Arabia. The real-time updated data from 1st May 2020 to 8th
January 2021 is collected from Saudi Ministry of Health, aiming to provide dynamic behaviors of the
pandemic in Saudi Arabia. During this period, it has infected 297,205 people, resulting in 6124 deaths with
the mortality rate 2.06 %. There is weak positive relationship between the spread of the infection and
mortality (ùëÖ# = 0.412). We use Susceptible-Exposed-Infection-Recovered (SEIR) mode, the logistic
growth model and with special focus on the exposed, infection and recovery individuals to simulate the
final phase of the outbreak. The results indicate that social distancing, good hygienic conditions, and
travel limitation are the crucial measures to prevent further spreading of the epidemic.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus are the large family of virus that are spread among humans, animals and livestock. The
virus may spread from birds such as bats to human through various intermediate host and cause severe
respiratory syndrome [7]. They cause generally mild respiratory infection, dry cough, fever, and difficult
of breathing. During the month of November, the first coronavirus outbreak has occurred in Wuhan, the
capital city of the Hubei province and the seventh largest city of China [2-4]. In 31 December 2019, the first
reported cases of the infected persons in Wuhan city were 25, including 7 critical ill cases. Since then, the
epidemic outbreak has drawn a serious concern and global attention. The Chinese authorities on 7 January
2020, has identified the novel coronavirus as the causative agent. However, on 10 January 2020, the World
Health Organization (WHO) has designated the novel coronavirus as 2019-nCoV. On the same day, the
WHO released a wide range of interim guidance for all countries on how to get prepare for and responding
to COVID-19 pandemic. This includes strategy and plan on how to monitor for potentially infected people,
collect and test samples. A practical guidance on how to manage patients, control and mitigate the burden
generated by the infection in health centers. This guidance also highlights the maintenance of right drug
supplies and effectively communicate with the lay public regarding the new virus [5]. On 12 February 2020,
the WHO has re-named the 2019-nCoV as sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
It has been announced that the official name of the virus responsible for causing coronavirus disease is

SARS-CoV-2. The World Health Organization officially declared the outbreak as a global pandemic as the
new coronavirus has rapidly spread to all over around 220 countries around the world [1].
On 2 March 2020, the first case of coronavirus in Saudi Arabia was identified and announced by
Ministry of Health. From the first week of March, the number of confirmed coronavirus COVID-19 cases
are gradually increasing and has led to 2932 confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia as of April 9, 2020. The pick
time of increasing the infection cases were noticed in June and July months. At present the new cases of
infection is decreasing gradually. On 8th January 2021 the total number of 363061 confirmed cases of
COVID-19 infection with 354,443 recovered and 6246 deaths have been conformed in Saudi Arabia (shown
in Figure 1).

Mathematical modeling and simulations are used as an important tool to predict the possibility and
severity of disease outbreak and provide information to understand its dynamic behavior of the
infection. Further, mathematical models have been widely used as an essential tool for investigating
the dynamics of the spread of infectious diseases such as Foot-and-Mouth Disease, SARS, Ebola and
Zika [10],[1]],[12],[13].This article aims to further understand the transmission dynamics of the virus
infection and facilitate the control measures using the real data from 1st March 2020 to 8th January 2021.
We study the basic reproduction number of the virus at the current outbreak. It is important to predict
the pandemic trend of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia to help the strategies of control and prevention
measures taken by the Ministry of health.

2. Related works
Adiga et al. [14] used both Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and logistic growth
models to study the trend and to provide short and long-term forecasting of the prevalence of COVID-19
cases and dynamics. The main idea of the ARIMA model is to precisely estimate the short-term prevalence
of recovered and death cases due to infection in Saudi Arabia. The result of the model was outstanding
with regards to mean absolute percentage error, mean absolute percentage error, mean absolute error and
coefficient of determination. It has more advantage in short-term forecasting which gives more accurate
projections of the pandemic. For the long-term forecasting they used logistic growth model.
Batista, M. [26] estimated the final size and its peak time of coronavirus COVID-19 in China, South Korea,
and the rest of the world by using logistical growth regression model. According to the model prediction,
the daily epidemic size forecasts begin to converge, and concluded that the outbreak is under control.
Ashleign et al. [15] proposed an aged-structured compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in the
population of Ontario, Canada. The model was stratified by age groups and used modified susceptibleexposed-infectious-recovered incorporating additional compartments for public health, severities of
clinical symptoms and risk of hospital admission.
Chen et al., [16] developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People (BHRP) transmission network model to simulate
the infection probability from bats to human. Further, they simplified the model as reservoir-people (RP)
transmission. The estimated result of basic reproduction number was 2.30. And the simulation results
showed that it was 3.58 from person to person. The results indicated that infection rate for coronavirus in
some countries might be higher than MERS.
Din et al., [17] used SIR model showed that some factors such as exposure, death, and cure rates affect the
susceptible, infected and recovered population involving immigration. The simulated results for infection
rate increase with involving the concern immigration rate. And with smaller immigration rate the infection
slows as compare at higher over and vice versa.
When the novel COVID-19 started to spread in China, many researchers discussed applying different
models in integer, stochastic and in fractional order. Thabet et al., [19] modeled an existence results using
Atangana‚ÄìBaleanu‚ÄìCaputo (ABC) derivative with fractional order. Further, simulation is performed using
Adams Bashforth numerical technique concerning results for two famous cities of China known as Wuhan
and Huanggang. Fractional models are more likely to be accurate in predicting the infection dynamics.
The SIR model with stochastic approaches are likely to produce the results different from deterministic
models whenever the model is run for some parameters. Zhang et al., [18] study the effects of the
environment on spreading of COVID-19 using stochastic modeling. The threshold of the stochastic COVID19 model is determined according to the large and small noise.
Meo et al., [20] investigated the biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due
to outbreaks of COVID-19 infection. The data of the outbreak were obtained from World Health
Organization. The study is done on gender-bases analysis demonstrates that the identified cases consisted
mostly of men with a median age range of 50-65 years. And concluded that there was a large variation in
the biological and epidemiological trends both in growth factor of number of cases and the mortality cases.
The nature of the spread of this pandemic in each country follows almost the same scenario. At the first
phase, the number of infected people increases exponentially and then its growth slows down. A number

of mathematical models of different complexity levels are used to predict the dynamics of the spread of
COVID-19. The logistic model describes properly the growth rate of infected people by coronavirus and
fitted with the available data. The use of a generalized logistic growth model improves the agreement with
the real data, however, prognostic number of the total number of cases is slightly higher than the simple
logistic model [33].
Wu et al., [23] employ for the classical logistic growth model and generalized form of the model to compare
the outbreak dynamics in the 29 provinces in China. The model estimates growth rate of infection decays
as fewer susceptible people are available for infection and better prediction at the later stage of the
epidemic.
Alrasheed et al., [24] built a network simulation model of the spread of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia using
SIR model. A set of attributes such as age, gender, nationality and location are defined for nodes in network
simulation. They also computed the percentage of people that must be vaccinated to stop the epidemic.
Adekunle et al., [21] analyses various forms of mathematical models that are relevant for the containment,
risk analysis, and features of COIVD-19. The SEIR model seems the most reliable extension model because
of its plausibility in explaining heterogeneous changes in behavior. And concluded, that mathematical
models can significantly guide the implementation of public health decision when properly expressed and
estimated.
3. Materials and Methods
The study of this research work is conducted in the department of mathematics, college of science,
Jazan University, Jazan, Saudi Arabia. We collected the real-life data on based on the number of confirmed
cases, recovered cases and number of deaths due to coronavirus COVID-19 infections all over the regions
of Saudi Arabia. The cumulative data are collected and obtained from the World Health Organization
(WHO) and Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia (Covid19 Command and Control Center CCC,). We also
obtained data from search engines including [1] and research articles published in [8]. We access the
reproduction number which represents the average number of people to which an infected person can
transmit the virus. Preliminary studies had estimated the reproduction number to be between 1.5 and 3.5.
The spread of the virus will disappear gradually with a reproduction number below1. As for comparison,
the reproduction number for common flu is 1.3 and SARS is 2.0. [1].
3.1 Ethical consideration
In our study, the information on epidemiological trends and current situation of coronavirus COVID
19 infection is taken from the World Health Organization, Worldmeter-Coronavirus and Ministry of
Health, Covid19 Command and Control Center CCC. So, ethical approval is not required.
3.2 Statistical Data and Analysis
The updated data related to cumulated infected cases and recovery are analyzed. The Table 1, shows
the number of confirmed and death cases at seven major cities in Saudi Arabia. The regression analysis is
performed using the data from the Table 1. We found that the coefficient of determination ùëÖ# is 0.34 and a
p-value is .00014, which is considered significant. According to the population in each city, the city of
Dhahran has the highest percentage of confirmed (average 4.5%) and death (average 0.8%) cases. The city
of Tabuk has the lowest percentage of confirmed (average 0.89%) and death (average 0.018%) cases.

From the reported cases, the number of newly confirmed case has been decreasing with higher recovery
rate. This is due to effective control and prevention measures imposed by Saudi Arabia government. The
following figure shows statistical analysis to interpret the real data. The analysis is performed by
considering the confirmed, recovered and death cases. The Figure 2 (a) and (b), show the analysis with the
daily confirmed cases as independent variable and the death cases as dependent variable. We have found
that the Multiple ùëÖ= 0.642, ùëÖ# = 0.412, Adjusted ùëÖ# = 0.410, Standard error = 9.452, Statistically significant ùêπ

3.3 The models
We introduce long-term forecasting of the COVID-19 infection in real time by using susceptibleexposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) and Logistic growth models. We consider both the continuous and
discrete cases of the logistic model equation. These models help to facilitate the prevention measure
provided by the Ministry of health, Saudi Arabia by predict the number of infected people per day.
3.3.1 Susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model
The simulation of the well-known SEIR model is performed to represent the dynamic behaviors of
spreading process of COID-19 epidemic in Saudi Arabia. SEIR model framework is an epidemic spreading
model inspired by [22]. In epidemiology, SEIR model is one of the compartmental epidemic models widely
used for characterizing the outbreak of COVID-19. In this model the spread of infection depends on the
number of susceptible population and the number of infected populations. The incubation period is
considered which individuals have been infected but without showing symptoms. Since the coronavirus
disease has a long incubation period, it is reasonable to model the epidemic with another compartment
which is Exposed humans which they are infected but not virus spreaders.
We perform simulation process to estimate the parameters of model to get the best fit on reported data
of COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia. In SEIR model, we assume that the time is long-term, no vital
dynamics and the population ùëÅ size is constant. In this model, individuals are classified into four groups
or compartments according to their infectious status. We classify the infection types with and without
symptoms. The compartments of the model are as follows:
o Susceptible (ùëÜ0 ): number of humans that are not infected by the virus but may catch the disease.
o Exposed (ùê∏0 ): number of humans that are already infected but can‚Äôt spread the virus.
o Infected (ùêº0 ): number of infected humans with symptoms.
o Infected (ùêº3 ): number of infected humans without symptoms.
o Recovered (ùëÖ0 ): number of humans that are recovered from infection.

The compartmental model diagram representing the SEIR is based on the dynamic behaviors of the
disease, epidemiological status of the individuals and intervention measures (shown in Figure 3). We
estimate the parameters of the model by using the data obtained from the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in
Saudi Arabia.

FIGURE 3: Diagram of the SEIR model adopted for simulating the novel coronavirus infection. The infection type
including symptomatic and asymptomatic types.

In this model, one important parameter to understand the basic characteristics of the epidemic is the
basic reproduction number (ùëÖK ). It represents the average number of secondary persons in a complete
susceptible population infected by a single infected person with or without symptoms during its spreading
life cycle. It indicates the transmission potential of the infectious disease. The value of ùëÖK is not certain and
fixed until the outbreak is over and affected by several factors:
o The period of infectiousness;
o Probability of infection being transmitted during contact between an infected person (with or
without symptoms) and susceptible person;
o The rate of contact between infected and susceptible person.
As the total population size is much large than the infection size. The basic reproduction number
threshold is studied as an indication of transmissibility of the virus, representing the average number. We
have the ùëÖK given as follows;

The infection of the virus is considered to be still spreading in the population when ùëÖK > 1. And when
ùëÖK < 1, means the infection of the virus becomes decrease due to run out of susceptible and exposed
individuals.

2.3.2 Logistic Growth models
The logistic growth model has been widely used for predicting the population growth rate with
limited resources and space. The model was originally developed by Haberman [ 25] and have been used
to predict 2015 Ebola epidemic [27, 28]. In this model, the dynamic of epidemic is expressed as a cumulative
number of cases in predicting the infection of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia; provided that all the control
measures have been implemented.
The classical logistic equation in continuous case, the epidemic can be defined as,
4S
45

S

(7)

= ùëüùê∂ 91 ‚àí VB

C = cumulative infection cases at time t,
r = increasing infection rate,
K = maximum infection size.
To investigate the relationship between the number of cases per day and the total number of maximum
infection size, we have the following solution from (7)
V

ùê∂(ùë°) = XNY Z [\ , ùê¥ =

V_S`

(8)

S`

At the initial stage of the epidemic, the solution is represented by an exponential function
ùê∂(ùë°) = ùê∂K ùëí b5
(9)
and, if graph of this equation approximates the increase in the number of cases at the initial stage, we
will be able to determine the growth rate ùëü. We can ignore this logistic model equation if the data do not fit
with the exponential dependence.
To predict the maximum possible number of infected people is the most important characteristics.
This can be predicted only at the stage of the noticeable difference the data and the exponential curve,
provided the number of infected people is not small. Since the health centers, operates with the case per
day, it is necessary to consider the difference logistics equation. Difference equation, which is discrete case
of the logistic equation governing the epidemic as defined as follows,
ùê∂(ùëõ) ‚àí ùê∂(ùëõ ‚àí 1) = ùëüùê∂(ùëõ ‚àí 1) 91 ‚àí

S(3_X)
V

B

(10)

ùëõ = discrete time interval in days,
ùê∂K = initial number of infections.
From equation (10), we can obtain a simple equation representing the relationship between the
number of cases per day and the total number cases (maximum infection size).

The above Figures 7 and 8 show the dynamics of the spread of coronavirus infection to human with
the parameters ùúáF and ùúáG estimated from the actual number of cases in Saudi Arabia. From the simulated
result our model predicts that the infection of the coronavirus to the environment will decrease gradually

at the end of February 2021.
Using the above model equations, we consider the following direction field in the various region of
phase space.

at the equilibrium points.

From the above direction field diagrams, we can see that in Figure 9 (a), both the number of infected
humans with symptoms and without symptoms heading towards a stable equilibrium point depending on
the initial conditions. This states that both the infected human with and without symptoms will reduce in
size the other grows towards the equilibrium point. The Figure 9 (b) shows the phase portal diagram for
number of infected humans with symptoms and susceptible humans, we get negative eigenvalues and so,
the equilibrium point at the ùëÜ0 axis is stable. Hence, the susceptible humans obtain a stable stage while the
infected human is minimum (almost zero infection). And the Figure 9 (c) shows the three-dimensional
phase portal for susceptible, infection and recovery; the recovery humans increase with no bounds for the
change in parameters related to infection and susceptible.

4.2 Simulation results of Logistic model
We use MATLAB to simulated both continuous and discrete case of the logistic model equation. From
the simulation results we compare the prediction of the cumulative infection cases with the real data. The
following figures, shows the comparison of the actual and prediction of cumulative infection cases in Saudi
Arabia bases on logistic growth equation.

Saudi Arabia. In Figure 10 (a), (b) and (c) shows predicted cumulative infection cases with infection rate
0.015 for 360, 400 and 460 days respectively. The simulation is repeated with the infection rate 0.016 for 360,

400 and 460 days shown in Figure 10 (b), (d) and (f) respectively. These models both discrete and
continuous cases tend to underestimate the maximum infection size K, and thus could serve as lower
bounds of future prediction. The logistic growth model provides accurate results in estimating the final
size of the epidemic in Saudi Arabia.

5. Discussion
Our proposed SEIR model considering both the infection types with and without symptoms is suitable
for slow transmission of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. The parameters are simulated from the real data and
found different with different scenarios. Moreover, the logistic growth model is used to predict future
dynamics of the outbreak in Saudi Arabia.
COVID-19 infection is an important issue concerning the global health and has infected wide area of
the world‚Äôs population. In this study, we investigated the biological and epidemiological trends in the
prevalence and mortality due to outbreak of novel coronavirus infection. The infection of COVID-19 is
expanding to over 220 countries and territories. It has infected 89,858,494 people, and has caused 1,930,829
(2.14%) death during the period December 2019 to 8th January 2021.
The infection of COVID-19 is rapidly transmitted during the months June, July and August. The
spreading phase of coronavirus has gradually slow down due to various control measure such as lockdown
and limitation of traveling. It is highly contagious due to its biological characteristics [31]. The infected
people can transmit the disease before they show clinical symptoms and it is contagious. This is one of the
main reasons that the virus could swiftly spread from Wuhan city, China to rest of the world and in Saudi
Arabia. However, the Ministry of Health (MOH), Saudi Arabia has taken various precautionary measures
to control the spread of COVID-19. Some of the preventive measures taken by MOH are as follows; (1)
providing COVID center help line number 937 and suspension of entry into Saudi Arabia for Umrah, (2)
ceasing to issue visas individuals coming from countries that had already been affected by COVID-19, (3)
banning citizen of Gulf countries entering two holy cities Makkah and Almadinah, (4) more than twenty
five hospitals all over Saudi Arabia were addressed COVID-19 cases, (5) massive campaigns for awareness
in public places and educational organizations [32]. All these preventive and precautions played an
important role in limiting the spread of COVID-19 infection in Saudi Arabia. Also, the number of death
rate as compare with the other countries is very low, which might be due to good care of infected patients
in hospitals in Saudi Arabia.
Recently, the outbreak of the new mutated coronavirus variant has been identified in UK. The health
secretary of UK has mentioned that new variant of COVID-19 may be driving infection in south east region.
One of the most significant mutation of this virus is in the spike protein that may result in becoming more
infectious and spreading rapidly between people [29].
The three main characteristics that comes together making the new coronavirus variant SARS-CoV-2
easier to spread are as follows;
o rapidly replacing another version of the virus,
o mutations that affect part of the virus,
o some of those mutations increase the ability of the virus to infect cells [30].
Over time, as more such mutations occur, the existing vaccine may need to adjusted accordingly.
However, SARS-CoV-2 doesn‚Äôt not mutate quickly as flu virus, and the vaccines that have so far proved
effective in trails is an improvement. There is no detection of new strain of the coronavirus in Saudi Arabia.
The Saudi health representative also stated that the mutated coronavirus variant did not change the way
the virus affects human [6] (accessed on 27 December 2020).
Considering the present scenario, adopting the precaution measures and travel limitations with the
other countries, we have predicted the possible number of cumulative infection cases in Saudi Arabia. The

Table 6, shows estimated prediction for future epidemic trends using logistic growth rate model. The
graphical representation of predicting the epidemic is shown in Figure 8. We can observe that the
prediction using our models are less significant difference with the real data. The prediction number with
the exact solution of the continuous logistic growth model shows more accurate and very close to the
cumulative case of the real data. Using the exact solution of the logistic model, the estimation of the
cumulative coronavirus cases around 360 days is 293544 which is close to the real cumulative case 296492.
Further, we have estimated the possible cumulative infection cases for 400 and 460 days.

In Table 7, prediction of the possible number of daily infection cases (Active cases) in Saudi Arabia is
shown using the SEIR model. Simulation of the outbreak prediction is performed for three phases 360, 400
and 460 days. The prediction of the daily infection cases using the SEIR model considering the type of
infection with symptoms and without symptoms is simulated and its graphical representation is shown in
the Appendix A. From the simulation process, the SEIR model with infection types has higher prediction
compare with the real data on daily active cases. However, the estimation of the infection nature has
reduced over the period of time. The infection rate of the virus from the asymptomatic individuals are seem
to have higher than the asymptomatic individuals. It is suggested that the asymptomatic people should be
identified to contain the spread of the disease.
Our future research directions would focus on extension of the proposed models with availability of
vaccination and more suitable with the mutated SARS-CoV-2.
5. Conclusions
The aim of this research work is to model and simulate the spread of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia using
compartmental epidemic models. We study the dynamic nature of the coronavirus outbreak in Saudi
Arabia for the reported cases from 1st May 2020 to 8th January 2021 using mathematical modeling and
simulation. We used both the SEIR and logistic growth models to simulate the further spread of COVID19. The SEIR model has been extended by considering the infection types both symptomatic and
asymptomatic. According to the model, the asymptomatic infected individuals have higher chance of

spreading the virus. Also, we adopted logistic growth model for both discrete and continuous time to
understand the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus in Saudi Arabia. The models predict the
cumulative confirmed cases and daily active cases through simulation process. However, the logistic
growth model provides a very good prediction close to the real number of cases. To describe the daily
active cases, the deterministic logistic model is more appropriate. Both the models have their own
advantages in predicting the future number of cases with SEIR model has higher than the logistics model.
In conclusion, we would like to say that our models predicted the future nature of the outbreak and
assess the effectiveness of Saudi Health Ministry control measures on infection. Furthermore, according to
our model predictions, the future outbreak under the strict control measures, is expected to its minimum
during the month of February 2021.
