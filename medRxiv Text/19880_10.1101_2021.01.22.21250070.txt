Abstract

35

Coronaviruses remodel intracellular membranes to form specialized viral replication

36

compartments, such as double-membrane vesicles where viral RNA genome replication takes

37

place. Understanding the factors affecting host response is instrumental to design of therapeutics

38

to prevent or ameliorate the course of infection.

39
40

As part of explorative tests in hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection

41

participating in ODYSSEY trial, we obtained samples for whole genome sequencing analysis as

42

well as for viral genome sequencing. Based on our data, we confirm one of the strongest severity

43

susceptibility locus thus far reported in association with severe COVID-19: 3p21.31 locus with

44

lead variant rs73064425. We further examine the associated region. Interestingly based on LD

45

analysis we report 3 coding mutations within one gene in the region of FYVE and Coiled-Coil

46

Domain Autophagy Adaptor 1 (FYCO1). We specifically focus on the role of FYCO1 modifiers

47

and gain-of-function variants. We report the associations between the region and clinical

48

characteristics in this severe set of COVID-19 patients.

49
50

We next analyzed expression profiles of FYCO1 across all 466 compounds tested. We

51

selected only those results that showed a significant reduction of expression of FYCO1. The most

52

significant candidate was indomethacin – an anti-inflammatory that could potentially

53

downregulate FYCO1. We hypothesize that via its direct effects on efficiency of viral egress, it

54

may serve as a potent therapeutic decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus. Clinical

55

studies will be needed to examine the therapeutic utility of indomethacin and other compounds

56

downregulating FYCO1 in COVID-19 infection and other strains of betacoronaviruses.

Introduction
The emergence of highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses calls for further research in order to

64

understand, treat and ideally prevent such infections ultimately circumventing epidemics.

65

Currently accurate prognoses are confounded by our inability to predict disease severity and

66

virulence across space and time. Virus-human interactions have driven around 30% of the human

67

genome evolution since divergence from chimpanzee. Different variants, genes affect severity to

68

a range of infections, for example: IFITM3, IRF7 in influenza, SFPA/D and VTR in RSV, CCR5

69

in HIV, IFNG in HTVL-1 and TNF in HPV to name a few. The complex interplay between

70

environmental, viral, and host genetic factors drives differences in individual disease

71

progression, severity, and outcome results. Understanding resilience and susceptibility factors

72

should enable one to design prophylactics and therapeutics.

73
74

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that has led to a worldwide pandemic1. There is a

75

high mortality rate associated with the virus and despite measures implemented to contain the

76

spread of the virus, over 2.1 million deathswere reported worlwide (1/26/21). The ACE2 binding

77

affinity with RBD on the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 10-20x higher than that of the SARS-

78

CoV. The clinical spectrum of this disease is heterogeneous, and infected individuals viral RNA

79

shedding pattern differ across individuals at baseline. Similarly to other positive-sense RNA

80

viruses, coronaviruses remodel intracellular membranes to form specialized viral replication

81

compartments. Depending on the time course of the infection, the structure, composition, and

82

formation of virus replication organelles appear to be varied and dynamic. Understanding the

83

mode of action of this virus in the context of its interaction with the host genome is fundamental

84

to the design of optimal therapeutic strategies.

85

In the early months of the epidemic it became apparent that advanced age and

86

comorbidities are associated with higher risk for severe infection yet none of these fully explain

87

the heterogeneous course of the infection amongst individuals2. To that end several sequencing

88

projects have been commenced since the beginning of the epidemic. Initial results from COVID-

89

19 initiative suggest a locus on chromosome 3p21.31, the peak association with severity of the

90

disease, signal that has been observed by the Severe Covid-19 GWAS Group and further

91

replicated by other host genome sequencing consortia345 and the UKbiobank6. The genetic

92

variants on chromosome 3 that are most associated with severe COVID-19 are all in high linkage

disequilibrium (LD). Furthermore recent phylogenetic analysis showed that the risk haplotype

94

thus entered the modern human population from Neanderthals (Vindija 33.19 Neanderthal)7.

95

Specifically, we focused on this region is because the 3p21.31 regional severity association was

96

the strongest one replicated by multiple consortia including the COVID-19 initiative and latest

97

Nature report by Casteneira et al., (rs73064425, OR=2.14, discovery p=4.77 × 10-30) (top

98

variants can be accessed in the supplementary material)

99
100

As part of explorative tests in hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive

101

infection participating in ODYSSEY trial, we obtained blood samples for whole genome

102

sequencing analysis as well as nasopharyngeal swabs for further viral genome sequencing. We

103

have conducted whole genome sequencing on first cohort participants as well as deep clinical

104

phenotyping. Based on our data, we confirm one of the strongest susceptibility locus reported

105

and now replicated with lead variant being rs73064425. We further examine the associated

106

region, with specific focus on the role of FYCO1 gene. We further discuss the associations

107

between the region and clinical characteristics in this severe set of COVID-19 patients.

Regional association

113

We replicate the strongest susceptibility locus reported and now replicated is within, 3p21.31

114

locus, rs73064425 Leucine Zipper Transcription Factor Like 1 (LZTFL1) reported by Casteneira

115

et al., as the strongest association with severity (rs73064425, OR=2.14, discovery p=4.77 × 10-

116

30). We replicate this association in our cohort of hospitalized patients (OR 3.2, CI

117

1.8728 to 5.4637, p-value<0.0001). The variant has a global gnomAD MAF of 0.05. We report

118

an increased MAF 0.19 in ODYSSEY, and consistently with gnomAD, we report a MAF of 0.05

119

in Vanda 2000 controls. The highest allelic frequency for this variant globally is present in

120

Ashkenazi Jewish (MAF 0.12) and the lowest frequency is present amongst East and South

121

Asian populations (MAF 0.0006). The GWAS signal covers a cluster of six genes (SLC6A20,

122

LZTFL1, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6, and XCR1), several of which with functions that could be

123

potentially relevant to Covid-19. The variant is a strong eQTL for CXCR6 and SLC6A20 in

124

GTEX8. The locus itself is within a highly regulatory region, as an enhancer for Primary B cells

125

from peripheral blood and modifier H3K4me1 in accordance with Haploreg. Furthermore the

126

locus is associated with monocyte percentage (UK Biobank field: 30190-0.0) in Gene Atlas.

127
128

Next we reconstructed LD to test if the signal (non-coding, top SNP by p-value) from

129

other large studies can be reproduced and extended to nearby genes, Where are the “limits” of

130

the signal on Odyssey data, Are there any coding variants .Interestingly there are 3 coding

131

mutations within one gene in the region (FYCO1) causing 2 amino acid substitutions (Table1;

132

two mutations within same codon, 1001, resulting in one missense mutation, third in strong LD).

133

All 3 coding variants are in strong LD with top SNPs published previously within the region and

134

seem to be the strongest signal for our Odyssey samples. Having ~2000 control genomes we can

135

see that all 3 coding variants form a strong LD. Quintessentially the risk is conveyed by the

136

extent of existing LD structure in that region as shown in Supplementary Table1. Specifically,

137

rs33910087 is an eQTL for CXCR6 and based on GeneAtlas, the genotyped variant is highly

138

significant modifier of monocyte percentage (p=3.8479e-46).

139
140
141

The association of the locus with severity of infection in interaction with SARS-CoV-2
remains to be examined. Functionally FYCO1 encodes a protein involved in vesicle transport and

142

autophagy. It has been suggested as a key mediator linking ER-derived double membrane

143

vesicles, the primary replication site for coronaviruses, with the microtubule network9. FYCO1

144

through its LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif was shown to be important for the fusion of

145

autophagosomes with lysosomes. FYCO1 dimerizes via the CC region, interacts with PI3P via

146

its FYVE domain, and forms a complex with Rab7 via a part of the CC region located in front of

147

the FYVE domain9. Specifically, FYCO1 was shown to act as a Rab7 effector that binds to LC3

148

and PI3P to mediate microtubule plus end-directed vesicle transport10. The depletion of Rab7

149

inhibits maturation of late endosomes/MVBs and leads to reduced lysosome numbers in cells11.

150

FYCO1 also mediates clearance of αsynuclein aggregates through a Rab7dependent

151

mechanism, overexpression reducing number of cell with αsynuclein aggregates12. In another

152

recent report authors perform a genome-scale CRISPR loss-of-function screen in human alveolar

153

basal epithelial carcinoma cells to identify genes whose loss enabled resistance to SARS-CoV-2

154

viral infection13. Loss of RAB7A reduces viral entry/egress by sequestering the ACE2 receptor

155

inside cells13. Furthermore, depletion of FYCO1 or antibodies against the N-terminus of LC3

156

blocks the subcellular redistribution of autophagosomes14. Indeed, rare FYCO1 variants some of

157

which contain missense mutations in the LIR domain have recently been associated with

158

inclusion body myositis a disease characterized by impaired autophagic degradation.

We stipulate gain of function variants in FYCO1 confer higher risk of severe course of

163

COVID-19 induced infection and likely other betacoronaviruses. Temporarily downregulating

164

FYCO1 seems to be protective, hence the locus is likely crucial to designing therapeutic

168

We have conducted a high throughput drug screen gene expression analysis to identify

169

compounds that would downregulate the expression of FYCO1. To discover potential,

170

pharmaceutical agents capable of affecting transcriptional expression levels of FYCO1

171

implicated in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 patho-physiology, we have screened 466 compounds

172

belonging to 14 different therapeutic classes. Screening was conducted using human retinal

173

pigment epithelia cell line (ARPE-19) and gene expression changes were collected across 12,490

174

genes. We analyzed the expression profiles of FYCO1 across all 466 compounds tested. In order

175

to find positive hits we selected only those results that showed a reduction of expression of

176

FYCO1 (1.5 -fold difference). The top significant candidate indomethacin is (displayed in Table

177

2) a drug that has both anti-inflammatory and antiviral actions. Indomethacin was previously

178

shown to have potent direct antiviral activity against the coronaviruses SARS-CoV and CCoV.

179

Its potent antiviral activity (>1,000-fold reduction in virus yield) was previously confirmed in

180

vivo in CCoV-infected dogs (Amici). These screens warrant further confirmatory tests

report coding mutations in SARS-CoV-2 based CoV-GLUE annotations15. All known variants

Discussion
Coronaviruses remodel intracellular membranes to form specialized viral replication

207

compartments, such as double-membrane vesicles where viral RNA genome replication takes

208

place. Understanding the formation and operation of these vesicles is instrumental to optimal

209

design of therapeutics to prevent or ameliorate the course of infection. Here via findings from

210

whole genome sequencing and association with severity of COVID-19, we were led to a locus

211

that may in fact be functionally relevant in predisposing individuals to severe course of infection

212

via its direct effects on efficiency of viral egress.

213
214

FYCO1 has a direct link to formation of vesicles and autophagy. Pathogenic mutations in

215

FYCO1 can affect intracellular transport of autophagocytic vesicles. Depletion of FYCO1 has

216

been shown to block distribution of autophagosomes. FYCO1 also mediates clearance of

217

αsynuclein aggregates through a Rab7dependent mechanism, overexpression reducing

218

number of cell with αsynuclein aggregates. Recently using single cell RNAseq authors

219

identified a group of genes (ATP6AP1, ATP6V1A, NPC1, RAB7A, CCDC22, and PIK3C3)

220

whose knockout induced shared transcriptional changes in cholesterol biosynthesis pathway13.

221

They showed how the actual perturbation of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway reduced viral

222

infection. That furthermore reveals the links via RAB7. We hypothesize fewer pLOFs in NPC1

223

to be present in cohorts of severe hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Niemann-Pick disease

225

homozygous recessive mice ((Npc1- /-))18,19 . Furthermore, bat species show selective sensitivity

226

to Ebola versus Marburg viruses20. Our hypothesis is that people with certain lysosomal storage

227

diseases may be resistant to one of these viruses. Along these lines there is suggestive evidence

228

for this to be exactly the case. This is in line with a report by Sturley et al., authors propose that

229

50 loci that in the homozygous state cause a lysosomal storage disorder, may account for

230

divergent clinical outcomes in COVID-19.

231
232

Blocking or perturbing viral egress whether via Rab7, FYCO1 or other components may

233

be a viable strategy to stop the proliferation of the virus reducing viral load. In the case of

234

betacoronaviruses unconventional egress can be blocked by the Rab7 GTPase competitive

235

inhibitor CID106770011 - compound potently decreasing viral egress in a dose-dependent

236

manner. Here we focused on downregulation of FYCO1: based on cell line expression with

237

resulting potential candidates including indomethacin - a drug that has both anti-inflammatory

238

and antiviral actions. Slowing viral spread by targeting regulators of lysosomal trafficking, by

239

focusing on egress and double membrane vesicles may offer a therapeutics strategy for novel

240

strain of betacoronaviruses.

241
242
243

The GWAS locus has led for further understanding of not only the more efficient egress

244

leading to successful propagation of the viral particles but also to potential protective

245

mechanisms and greater understanding of the heterogeneous clinical outcomes. We hence

246

stipulate gain of function variants in FYCO1 confer higher risk of infection with SARS and other

247

betacoronaviruses. Downregulating or temporarily limiting, FYCO1 activity may be protective.

248

This susceptibility locus in fact highlights the potentially druggable cellular aspects of the host.

Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. COVID-19 Cohort:

269

WGS cohort consisted of 80 COVID-19 hospitalized patient samples and 1876 WGS controls.

270

DNA was extracted from 200 µl of whole blood using QIAamp blood mini kit and eluted into

271

100 µl volume in order to obtain 500 ng of DNA. Libraries were prepared by random

272

fragmentation of DNA followed by adapter ligation using Illumina TruSeq adapters. Paired-end

273

libraries 2x150 bp were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 S4 with a target of 90Gb raw

274

read depth per sample. The cohort was multi-ethnic and the age ranged from 35-87 for severe

275

hospitalized COVID-19 cases (68% male, 32% female). Specifically the PC defined ancestry

276

was as follows (African 9.8%, European 46.3%, Asian 4.9%, Hispanic 22% and other 17.1%).

277

Furthermore, 16% of the cohort were patients hospitalized on mechanical ventilation or ECMO,

Paired-end 150bp reads were aligned to the GRCh37 human reference (BWA-MEM v0.7.8)

281

followed by Picard (MarkDuplicates) and processed with GATK best-practices workflow

282

(GATK v3.5.0). The mean coverage was 35.8x. All high quality variants obtained from GATK

283

were annotated. Annotations include variant effect predictions using VEP; allele frequencies

from Gnomad;dbSNP 150 rsIDs; conservation scores from PhyloP, GERP, PhastCons; damaging

285

effect predictions from Polyphen 2, SIFT and clinically relevant information from ClinVar. We

286

removed samples with a discordance between self-declared and sequence-derived gender, we

287

used KING for detection of related individuals and performed PCA for ancestry adjustment. The

288

lead variant was in addition verified with genotyping (Supplementary Material). Logistic

289

regression was conducted in PLINK, MATLAB. The analysis was corrected for PC 1-15, age

290

and sex.

291

Viral sequencing and genome assembly

292

Sequencing was attempted on all samples with a positive RT-PCR assay result that had Ct <32

293

using either a metagenomic approach described previously21, via IDT probe-capture22, or by

294

amplicon sequencing with SWIFT library preparation. Libraries were sequenced on Illumina

295

MiSeq or NextSeq instruments using 1x150 or 1x75 runs respectively. Consensus sequences

296

were assembled using a custom bioinformatics pipeline [https://github.com/proychou/hCoV19]

297

adapted for SARS-CoV-2 from previous work22,23. Briefly, raw reads were trimmed to remove

298

adapters and low quality regions using BBDuk and a k-mer based filter was used to pull out

299

reads matching the reference sequence NC_045512. Filtered reads were de novo assembled using

300

SPAdes24 and contigs were ordered against the reference using BWA-MEM. Gaps were filled by

301

remapping reads against the assembled scaffold and a consensus sequence was called from this

302

alignment using a custom script in R/Bioconductor.

303
304

Cell culture and drug treatment

305

Drugs screening was carried out, the same one as applied in our previous study25. The retinal

306

pigment epithelia cell line, ARPE-19/HPV-16, was chosen to establish a database of drug

307

profiles because of its non-cancerous, human origin, with a normal karyotype. It can also be

308

easily grown as monolayer in 96-well plates. Compounds were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis,

309

MO) or Vanda Pharmaceuticals (Washington, DC). Cells were aliquoted on 96-well plates

310

(~2×10e5 cells/well) and incubated for 24 h prior to providing fresh media with a drug, or the

311

drug vehicle (water, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanol, methanol, or phosphate-buffered saline

312

solution). Drugs were diluted 1000 fold in buffered in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium:

313

Nutrient Mixture F-12 (D-MEM/F-12) culture medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing

314

nonessential amino acids and 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate. In these conditions, no significant

315

changes of pH were expected, which was confirmed by the monitoring of the pH indicator

316

present in the medium. A final 10 μM drug concentration was chosen because it is believed to fit

317

in the range of physiological conditions25. Microscopic inspection of each well was conducted at

318

the end of the treatment to discard any samples where cells had morphological changes

319

consistent with apoptosis. We also verified that the drug had not precipitated in the culture

320

medium.

321
322

Gene expression

323

Cells were harvested 24 h after treatment and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy 96 protocol

324

(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Gene expression for 22,238 probe sets of 12,490 genes was generated

325

with U133A2.0 microarrays following the manufacturer’s instructions (Affymetrix, Santa Clara,

326

CA). Drugs were profiled in duplicate or triplicate, with multiple vehicle controls on each plate.

327

A total of 708 microarrays were analyzed including 74 for the 18 antipsychotics, 499 for the

328

other 448 compounds, and 135 for vehicle controls. The raw scan data were first converted to

329

average difference values using MAS 5.0 (Affymetrix). The average difference values of both

330

treatment and control data were set to a minimum of 50 or lower. For each treatment category,

331

all probe sets were then ranked based on their amplitude, or level of expression relative to the

332

vehicle control (or the average of controls was selected when more than one was used).

333

Amplitude was defined as the ratio of expression (t−v) / [(t+v) / 2] where t corresponds to

334

treatment instance and v to vehicle instance. Each drug group profile was created using our novel

335

Weighted Influence Model, Rank of Ranks (WIMRR) method which underscores the rank of

336

each probe set across the entire gene expression profile rather than the specific change in

337

expression level. WIMRR takes the average rank of each probe set across all of the members of

338

the group and then reranks the probe sets from smallest average rank to largest average rank. A

339

gene-set enrichment metric based on the Kolmogorov– Smirnov (KS) statistic. Specifically, for a

340

given set of probes, the KS score gives a measure of how up (positive) or down (negative) the set

341

of probes occurs within the profile of another treatment instance.
