Abstract
Background and objective: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
(SARS-CoV-2)-induced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been pandemic
worldwide. Several reports observed a reduction of lymphocytes among COVID-19
patients. However, clinical significance of lymphocyte reduction in COVID-19
patients remains unclear. The objective of this study was to analyze the association
between lymphocyte reduction at early stage and the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.
Methods: All 192 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Electronic
medical records, including demographic data, clinical characteristics, comorbidities
and exposure history, were collected. Biochemical indexes on admission and chest
computed tomography (CT) were detected. Patient's prognosis was followed up.
Results: On admission, 84 (43.8%) patients suffered from lymphocyte reduction
among COVID-19 patients. The count and percentage of lymphocytes on admission
were lower among more than seventy-year-old patients than those of younger patients.
Multivariate logistic regression revealed that older age was a risk factor of
lymphocyte reduction. Of interest, chest CT score, a key marker of lung injury, was
increased among COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. By contrast, PaCO2,
SpO2 and oxygenation index, several respiratory function markers, were decreased in
COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. Moreover, TBIL and DBIL, two
markers of hepatic injury, creatinine and urea nitrogen, two indices of renal function,
and creatine kinase, AST and LDH, three myocardial enzymes, were elevated in
COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. Among 84 COVID-19 patients with
lymphocyte reduction, 32.1% died. Fatality rate was obviously higher in COVID-19
patients with lymphocyte reduction than those with normal lymphocyte (RR=5.789,
P<0.001).
Conclusion: Older COVID-19 patients are more susceptible to lymphocyte reduction.
Lymphocyte reduction at early stage aggravates the severity of multiple organ injuries
and elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients.

In December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia emerged in Wuhan City in
Central China’s Hubei Province. Genetic sequencing of isolates obtained from
patients with pneumonia identified a novel coronavirus as the etiology, now officially
classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1).
Subsequently, the new disease has been officially named as corona virus disease 2019
(COVID-19) by WHO (2-4). Since COVID-19 broke out in Wuhan City,
SARS-CoV-2 injection has been pandemic in the whole world. As of March 18, 2020,
total 81151 confirmed cases have been identified and 3242 patients died from
SARS-CoV-2 infection in China. Moreover, 114408 confirmed cases and 4651 death
cases were found in other countries (5).
The clinical symptoms and features of COVID-19 patients include fever, dry
cough, bilateral lung ground glass opacity, dyspnea and diarrhea. In severe and critical
ill cases, SARS-CoV-2-caused pneumonia leads to not only severe acute respiratory
syndrome but also multiple organ failure even death (6). Furthermore, several studies
found that lymphocyte count from peripheral blood was decreased in most patients
with COVID-19. Lymphocyte count in severe patients was obviously lower than that
of common patients (1, 6, 7). Nevertheless, what factors lead to lymphopenia remains
unclear. The association between lymphocyte reduction and the prognosis of
COVID-19 patients needs to be determined.
The objective of this study was to analyze influence factors of lymphocyte
reduction as well as the association between lymphocyte reduction and prognosis of
COVID-19 patients in a hospital-based case-cohort study. Our results showed that
older age was a risk factor of lymphocyte reduction on admission. We found that
lymphocyte reduction on admission aggravated the severity of multiple organ injuries
and elevated death risk of COVID-19 patients. This research provides evidences for
the first time that peripheral lymphocyte count on admission may be a potential
indicator of prognosis for COVID-19 patients.

Subjects
In the present research, 220 cases confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection were
enrolled from Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology
from January 1 to January 30, 2020. Union Hospital of Huazhong University of
Science and Technology is one of COVID-19-designated hospitals for the
hospitalization of probable and confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan City in central
China’s Hubei Province. Medical team from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui
Medical University zealously went to Union Hospital and taken part in medical
treatment of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan City. We excluded cases with a negative
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection result, incomplete data or testing result. Children and
pregnant women were also excluded from this research. At last, 192 patients involved
in this trial and 28 cases eliminated. We reviewed and collected clinical electronic
medical records including demographic data, clinical characteristics, comorbidities,
nursing records and disease exposure history for all patients with laboratory
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Biochemical indexes on admission and chest
computed tomography (CT) were detected. We followed up the outcomes of
COVID-19 patients. This study was approved by the institutional ethics board of the
Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and Union Hospital of
Huazhong University of Science and Technology. All participants or guardians gave
written informed consent.
Date collection
Demographic data, laboratorial results and CT image findings were acquired
from medical records in the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and
Technology. The demographic data of all patients were collected: gender, age,
smoking history, exposure history, comorbidities including cardiovascular disease,
hypertension, chronic pulmonary disease, hepatic disease, diabetes and other chronic
diseases, symptoms and signs including: cough, fever, fatigue and diarrhea.
Biochemical indexes on admission included: blood routine, oxygen saturation, partial

All patients underwent chest CT scan. The total CT images were analyzed by two
independent radiologists with rich clinical experience. All images were viewed on
both lung (width, 1500 HU; level, -700 HU) and mediastinal (width, 350 HU; level,
40 HU) settings. The presence or absence of all image features was recorded:
ground-glass opacities, consolidation, traction bronchiectasis, bronchial wall
thickening, reticulation, subpleural bands, vascular enlargement and lesion
distribution. The detailed CT image characteristics of 200 COVID-19 patients were
described in other work (8). On the image scans, the pulmonary tissues were divided
into two single lungs (left and right lung) and three zones (upper, middle, and lower
zones of lung in the bilateral lungs). These areas of the lung were defined as the
“upper zones” above the level of the carina; the “middle zones” between the level of
the carina and the level of the inferior pulmonary veins; and the “lower zones” below
the level of the inferior pulmonary veins. The CT score was determined by visually
estimating the extent of disease in each zone. The severity scores were evaluated
according to the percentage of lung parenchyma in each zone that showed evidence of
each recorded abnormality: (1) no injury; (2) 1 point, involvement of less than 25% of
the image; (3) 2 ponits, 25% to 50%; (4) 3 points, 50% to 75%; (5) 4 ponits, more
than 75%. A total severity scores (between 0 and 24) for each lung were generated via
adding all the partial areas. The total scores represented the damage area for each lung
tissue (9).
Statistical analysis

All data were statistically analyzed with SPSS 21.0 software. Categorical
variables were expressed with frequencies and percentages. Data were expressed as
mean or median for the continuous variables. Means for continuous variables were
compared with independent-samples t tests when the data were normally distributed;
if not, the Mann-Whitney test was used. The comparison of discrete variables between
different groups was evaluated using the chi-square and Fisher’s exact test. Moreover,
the main risks related with lymphocyte reduction were examined using multivariable
logistic regression model. Statistical significance was determined at p values of less
than 0.05.
Results
1. Demographics data and clinical characteristics among COVID-19 patients
All the 192 patients (49.5% males) aged between 22 to 87 years were included in
the analysis. The normal range of lymphocyte count in the peripheral blood is from
0.8 to 4 (109/L). The demographic and clinical characteristics of all COVID-19
patients are showed in Table 1. Patients with high and low counts of lymphocyte (split
at the low thresholds, 08×109/L) were on difference in gender, comorbidities
including smoker, diabetes, hypertension, hepatic disease, cardiac disease, pulmonary
disease and other chronic disease. Clinical symptoms, such as fever, diarrhea, fatigue
and cough, as well as injured pulmonary nodes (bilateral lungs, single left lung, single
right lung) were no difference in COVID-19 patients with normal lymphocyte and
lymphocyte reduction (Table 1). Nevertheless, the number of patients under 49 years
old with lymphocyte reduction was less than those with normal lymphocyte
[11(13.1%) vs 37(34.3%)]. On the contrary, the number of patients over 70 years old
with lymphocyte reduction was more than those with normal lymphocyte [24(28.6%)
vs 14(16.0%)].
2. Older COVID-19 patients are more susceptible to lymphocyte reduction
The blood routine of the whole COVID-19 patients on admission to hospital
were measured and the number of abnormal cases was calculated. As shown in Table

2, we found that 84 (43.8%) cases’ lymphocyte count were decreased, 97 (50.8%)
cases’ lymphocyte percentage were decreased and 4 (2.1%) were increased. 64
(33.5%) cases’ white blood cell (WBC) were under the normal range and 15 (7.9%)
above the normal range. 105 (55.2%) cases’ eosinophils count and 120 (62.5%)
eosinophils percentage were below the normal range. 114 (59.4%) neutrophil
percentage were higher than the upper limit. The effects of different gender on
lymphocyte count and lymphocyte percentage were analyzed. As shown in Table 3,
lymphocyte counts were similar in male and female patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocyte percentage in males were obviously lower than those in females (16.1%

vs 22.3%, P 0.012). The effects of ages on lymphocyte count and lymphocyte
percentage were then evaluated. The lymphocyte counts in patients over 70 years old
were evidently lower compared with those under 60 years old and from 60 to 69 years

old (0.66 vs 0.92 with 0.92, P 0.012). Similarly, the lymphocyte percentage in
patients over 70 years old were lower than those under 60 years old and between 60 to
69 years old (12.1% vs 22.1% with 15.8%, P

＝0.001). Besides, there were no

differences of lymphocyte count and lymphocyte percentage in the smokers and
non-smokers. Among all cases, 163 (81.5%) had at least one of comorbidities, such as
137 (68.5 %) diabetes, 101 (51.5%) hypertension, 9 (4.5%) hepatic disease, 16 (8.0%)
cardiac disease, 8 (4.0%) pulmonary disease and 7 (3.5%) other chronic diseases. The
impacts of comorbidities on lymphocyte count and lymphocyte percentage were then
analyzed. There were no statistical difference of lymphocyte count and lymphocyte
percentage between COVID-19 patients with and without diabetes, hypertension,
hepatic disease and other chronic diseases (Table 3). Interestingly, we found that
lymphocyte percentage in patients with cardiac disease and pulmonary disease were
prominently lower than those in patients without cardiac disease and pulmonary

disease (12.0% vs 20.6%, P 0.028; 10.6% vs 20.1%, P 0.045 ). Multivariable
logistic regression was used to analyze risk factors of lymphocyte reduction in 192
patients with COVID-19. As shown in Table 4, the OR of lymphocyte reduction in
patients from 60 to 69 years old was 0.290 (95% Cl: 0.096, 0.874; P=0.028), the OR

of lymphocyte reduction in patients under 70 years old was 0.350 (95% Cl: 0.124,
0989; P=0.048). No significant correlation was observed between gender, smoker
with comorbidities and lymphocyte reduction in COVID-19 patients (Table 4).
3. Lymphocyte reduction on admission aggravates lung damage among
COVID-19 patients
Chest CT were examined among COVID-19 patients. As shown in Figure 1A,
mild lung markings and patch clouding lung ground glass shadow in the subpleural
area of bilateral lungs were found in COVID-19 patients with normal lymphocyte.
Whereas, increased pulmonary brochovascular shadows, indistinct lung markings and
blur, pulmonary consolidation and nodules, and extensive high-density area with
obvious lung ground glass shadow in the bilateral lungs were the main lung
manifestations in COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction (Figure 1B). Besides,
the severity of lung damage was scored by two experienced radiologists blind to the
clinical data. As shown in Figure 1C-1E, the results showed that left lung CT score,
right lung CT score and bilateral lungs CT score were all evidently increased in
patients with lymphocyte reduction (5.0 vs 3.0, 6.0 vs 3.0, 11.0 vs 6.0). Further
correlation analysis indicated that lymphocyte count was significantly and negatively

4. Lymphocyte reduction aggravates extrapulmonary multiple organ injuries
among COVID-19 patients
The effect of lymphocyte reduction on admission on extrapulmonary organ
multiple organ injures was analyzed in COVID-19 patients. Hepatic function related
biochemical indexes on admission were detected among all COVID-19 patients. As
shown in Table 5, TBIL and DBIL in patients with lymphocyte reduction were
obviously higher than those in patients with normal lymphocyte. The level of ALT
was no difference between two groups. Compared with patients with lymphocyte
reduction, total protein and albumin were lower than those in patients with normal

lymphocyte. There was no difference in globulin and albumin/globulin ratio between
two groups. Renal functions were also measured on admission among COVID-19
patients. As shown in Table 5, creatinine and urea nitrogen were increased in patients
with lymphocyte reduction. No significant difference on uric acid was observed
between two groups. Moreover, myocardial function results suggested that creatine
kinase, LDH, AST and AST/ALT ratio were significantly increased in patients with
lymphocyte reduction compared with in patients with normal lymphocyte. The
numbers of myoglobin-positive and cardiac troponin

-positive

patients with

lymphocyte reduction were more than the patients with normal lymphocyte. The
number of creatine kinase isoenzymes-positive patients were equal between two
groups. Besides, respiratory function related biochemical indexes of COVID-19
patients were evaluated on admission. PaCO2, SpO2, oxygenation index were
remarkably decreased in patients with lymphocyte reduction. In addition, we found
that D-dimer and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were prominently increased in
patients with lymphocyte reduction.
5. Lymphocyte reduction on admission elevates disease severity of COVID-19
patients
The effect of lymphocyte reduction on admission on disease severity of
COVID-19 was analyzed. Among all patients, severe and critical ill cases, defined as
oxygenation index lower than 300, accounted for 107 (55.9%). Common cases,
oxygenation index higher than 300, accounted for 85 (44.1%). The relationship
between lymphocyte count and disease severity of COVID-19 was analyzed. As
shown in Table 6, the severe or critical ill patients were 59 (72.0%) in patients with
lymphocyte reduction, and were 43 (41.0%) in patients with normal lymphocyte. The

RR was 1.757 (95% Cl: 1.346, 2.292; P 0.001) in severe and critical ill COVID-19
cases with lymphocyte reduction.

patients

The effect of lymphocyte reduction on admission on the fatality rate was
evaluated. As shown in Table 6, 32.1% (27/84) died in COVID-19 patients with
lymphocyte reduction, whereas only 5.56% (6/108) died in patients with normal
lymphocyte. Further analysis showed that lymphocyte reduction elevated death risk of
COVID-19 patients. The RR was 5.789 (95% Cl: 2.504, 13.367; P

＜0.001) in

COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction.
Discussion
The present research analyzed the association between lymphocyte reduction at
early stage and prognosis of COVID-19 patients in a hospital-based case-cohort study.
The main findings of the present research include: older COVID-19 patients are more
susceptible to lymphocyte reduction; lymphocyte reduction on admission aggravates
the severity of multiple organ injuries among COVID-19 patients; lymphocyte
reduction on admission elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients.
Several studies found that lymphocyte count was decreased in COVID-19
patients (1, 7, 10, 11). In addition, several reports showed that lymphocyte count was
lower in severe COVID-19 patients than in common ones (12). What factors lead to
lymphocyte reduction on admission among COVID-19 patients remains obscure. In
the present research, we analyzed the relationship between age and lymphocyte
reduction among COVID-19 patients. Our results showed that almost half of patients’
lymphocyte count and percentage were reduced to below normal range. Moreover, the
number and percentage of lymphocytes were lower in COVID-19 patients over 70
years old than those of younger patients. The effects of gender and comorbidities on
lymphocyte reduction were analyzed among COVID-19 patients. Our results showed
that lymphocyte percentage were obviously decreased in males than those of females.
Of interest, lymphocyte percentage was reduced only in COVID-19 patients with
either cardiac diseases or pulmonary chronic diseases. To control possible
confounding factors, multivariable logistic regression was used to further analyze the
influence of gender, age and comorbidities on lymphocyte reduction in COVID-19

patients. We found that older age was the major risk factor of lymphocyte reduction
on admission among COVID-19 patients. Our results suggest that lymphocytes may
be a direct target of SARS-CoV-2. Elderly patients are more susceptible to suffer
from lymphocyte reduction at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Previous studies found that multiple organ injures were prevalent in almost all
COVID-19 patients, especially in critical ill cases (13-15). In the present research, we
evaluated the severity of lung injury in COVID-19 patients using CT scores. We
observed an obvious lung damage in almost all COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the CT
scores were higher in COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction than those in
COVID-19 patients with normal lymphocyte. Correlation analysis revealed that
lymphocyte counts were negatively associated with CT scores. The association
between lymphocyte reduction and respiratory function indices was then analyzed
among COVID-19 patients. As expected, PaCO2, SpO2 and oxygenation index,
several respiratory function markers, were decreased in COVID-19 patients with
lymphocyte reduction. Next, the association between lymphocyte reduction and
extrapulmonary organ injuries was analyzed among COVID-19 patients. We found
that TBIL and DBIL, two markers of hepatic injury, creatinine and urea nitrogen, two
indices of renal function, and creatine kinase, AST and LDH, three myocardial
enzymes, were obviously elevated in COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction.
These results suggest that lymphocyte reduction at the early stage may be a potential
indicator of multiple organ injures among COVID-19 patients.
Several reports demonstrated that lymphocyte reduction was more obvious in
critical ill patients (16-19). However, the relationship between lymphocyte reduction
at the early stage and the severity and death risk of COVID-19 patients has not
yet to be determined. Our results showed that the severity of COVID-19 patients was
positively associated with lymphocyte reduction on admission. Moreover, fatality rate
was higher in patients with lymphocyte reduction than those of patients with normal
lymphocyte. These results indicate that lymphocyte reduction elevates the severity

and death risk of COVID-19 patients, which explains why the fatality rate was higher
in older COVID-19 patients than in younger ones. The present study provides
evidence that lymphocyte reduction on admission may be a potential negative
prognostic indicator for COVID-19 patients.
In summary, the present study analyzed the association between lymphocyte
reduction at the early stage and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. We showed that
older patients were more susceptible to lymphocyte reduction. Moreover, lymphocyte
reduction on admission was positively associated with multiple organ injuries. In
addition, lymphocyte reduction on admission elevated the severity and death risk of
COVID-19 patients. Our results suggest that lymphocytes may be a direct target of
SARS-COV-2. We provide evidence that lymphocyte reduction at early stage may be
a potential negative prognostic indicator for COVID-19 patients. Therefore,
surveillance of lymphocyte count is helpful for the early screening, diagnosis and
treatment of critical ill COVID-19 patients.
