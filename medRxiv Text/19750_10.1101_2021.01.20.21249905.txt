Title: A cross-sectional analysis of demographic and behavioral risk factors of SARS-CoV-2
antibody positivity among a sample of U.S. college students
Abstract
Background: Colleges and universities across the United States are developing and
implementing data-driven prevention and containment measures against severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Identifying risk factors for SARS-CoV-2
seropositivity could help to direct these efforts.
Objective: To estimate the associations between demographic factors and social behaviors and
SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and self-reported positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test.
Methods: In September 2020, we randomly sampled Indiana University Bloomington (IUB)
undergraduate students. Participants completed a cross-sectional, online survey about
demographics, SARS-CoV-2 testing history, relationship status, and risk behaviors. Additionally,
during a subsequent appointment, participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a
fingerstick procedure and SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG rapid assay kit. We used unadjusted modified
Poisson regression models to evaluate the associations between predictors of both SARS-CoV-2
seropositivity and self-reported positive SARS-CoV-2 infection history.
Results: Overall, 1,076 students were included in the serological testing analysis, and 1,239
students were included in the SARS-CoV-2 infection history analysis. Current seroprevalence of
SARS-CoV-2 was 4.6% (95% CI: 3.3%, 5.8%). Prevalence of self-reported SARS-CoV-2
infection history was 10.3% (95% CI: 8.6%, 12.0%). Greek membership, having multiple
romantic partners, knowing someone in one’s immediate environment with SARS-CoV-2
infection, drinking alcohol more than 1 day per week, and hanging out with more than 4 people
when drinking alcohol increased both the likelihood of seropositivity and SARS-CoV-2 infection
history.
Conclusion: Our findings have implications for American colleges and universities and could be
used to inform SARS-C0V-2 prevention and control strategies on such campuses.

1 Introduction
1.1 Background and rationale
The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused major challenges for
both colleges and students including school closures, shifts to remote and hybrid educational
formats, and negative financial impacts (1). More importantly, the disease burden on college
campuses has been substantial with at least 397,000 severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases and at least 90 deaths reported at more than 1,900 colleges
as of December 11, 2020 (2). Furthermore, because of the collegiate semester schedules, there
are mounting concerns that infected asymptomatic students might spread the virus to their family
members when traveling back home (3). Identifying predictors of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity
can help to plan and coordinate mitigation testing programs, containment efforts, and vaccination
strategies.
Previous studies among the general U.S. adult population have established that race, gender, and
age are associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (4, 5). However, these characteristics have not
been thoroughly studied among college students. Moreover, there are demographic factors
specific to college student populations, such as participation in Greek life (6), dating, and year in
school, that might be significant predictors of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in this population.
Lastly, because of the drinking culture and social context of drinking among college students (7),
alcohol use patterns may be another potential predictor of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in this
population. Young adults with a hazardous drinking problem have reported to comply less with
the stay-at-home order on days that they were drinking, compared to days that they did not drink
(8). The effects of alcohol are compounded in the social setting of college drinking: when the

number of friends present in an alcohol drinking event increases, the number of consumed
alcohol drinks increases (at an individual level) (9). Crowded social events also, by definition,
limit the ability to maintain physical distance. Since alcohol consumption is prevalent among
college students (10), assessing the relationship between this behavior and SARS-CoV-2
positivity is imperative to better understand the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among
college students. Therefore, in the current study we examined the relationship between drinking
behaviors and SARS-CoV-2 positivity.
1.2 Objective
The primary aim of the current study was to estimate the associations between different
demographic characteristics and social behaviors and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and selfreported positive test history outcomes among college students. We also estimated the
seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody (in September 2020) and the prevalence of selfreported SARS-CoV-2 positive test history among Indiana University Bloomington (IUB)
undergraduate students.
2 Methods
We used the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)
guidelines (11) to report our findings about the baseline characteristics of IUB COVID-19
Serosurvey Study participants and predictors of SARS-CoV-2 positivity.
2.1 Study Design
The parent study design was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test whether receiving
SARS-CoV-2 antibody test results alters students’ protective behaviors against infection (12).
3

The RCT data collection was longitudinal and lasted for two months. We collected data at
baseline and every two weeks post-baseline. In the current study, we used data from baseline
survey and baseline antibody test results in a cross-sectional study design. Participants were
compensated with a maximum of $30 USD for completing all the steps in the RCT. This study
protocol #2008293852 received approval from the University’s Institutional Review Board.
2.2 Setting
Study invitation emails were sent to a random sample of 7,499 IUB undergraduate students. The
emails included information about the study and a student-specific link to an online survey. The
online survey consisted of an eligibility criteria instrument, an online consent form, a laboratory
test appointment scheduler for SARS-CoV-2 antibody test, and a baseline survey. The baseline
survey measured participants demographics, SARS-CoV-2 testing history, and risk behaviors.
Eligible students who consented to participate were able to schedule a laboratory test
appointment and complete the online baseline survey. Study invitation and reminder emails were
sent on September 8-20, 2020. Students scheduled their baseline appointments and responded to
the baseline survey between September 8 and September 30, 2020.
The SARS-CoV-2 antibody laboratory tests were conducted in-person outdoors on the IUB
campus, between September 14 - 30. During laboratory test, recommended protocols to reduce
the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the study site were employed, including physical
distancing, mask wearing, glove wearing, and disinfection of laboratory equipment. Students
were advised not to attend their appointment if they were experiencing COVID-19 symptoms,
had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the last two weeks before their appointment, or had been
directed to isolate or quarantine. Participants checked in with their unique study ID, which they

had created in the online survey. Using a fingerstick procedure, trained nursing staff took a small
blood sample from each participant and placed the blood sample on the antibody testing kit.
Trained field staff read the antibody test results from the test kit, took a high-quality picture of
the kit and uploaded it to a secured cloud drive, and entered the test results into the REDCap data
management system. To increase the accuracy of the antibody test readings, a trained research
assistant independently assessed the results using the pictures that field staff had taken from the
test kits. Discordant results were adjudicated by five research team members.
2.3 Participants
We selected a random sample of IUB undergraduate students (n=7,499) from the sampling frame
of all IUB undergraduate students (n~33,084). Selected students were eligible to participate in
this study if they were 1) age 18 or older, 2) a current IUB undergraduate student, and 3)
currently residing in Monroe County, IN.
2.4 Variables and data sources/measurement
2.4.1 Outcomes
Objective outcome: The main outcome was the participants’ SARS-CoV-2 antibody laboratory
test result. The virus can cause immune response in both symptomatic and asymptomatic
individuals (13, 14). The antibody test kits we used were SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG rapid assay kit
(Colloidal Gold method). These kits can detect IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in
the blood and provide accurate and rapid results at the testing site. If the antibody test result was
negative for both IgM and IgG antibodies, the antibody test result was coded as negative.

Otherwise, if the test kit results for any of the two types of antibodies was positive, the outcome
was coded positive.
Subjective outcome: The second outcome of interest was self-reported SARS-CoV-2 testing
history. This was measured by the following questions in the baseline survey.
1) “Have you ever been tested for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) before? Note: By this, we mean
testing for active infections, usually done with a nasal swab or saliva test” (Responses:
“Yes”, “No”, “Don’t Know”).
2) [Displayed if 1 equals Yes] “Have you ever tested positive for a SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)
infection?" (Responses: “Yes”, “No”, “Don’t Know”)
Participants who responded “Yes” to both questions were categorized as ever tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2.
2.4.2 Demographic and behavioral predictors
We collected data on the following baseline characteristics and potential risk factors for a
positive SARS-CoV-2 test result: age (≥22 years old vs. <22 years old), sex at birth (Female vs.
Male), race (Asian, Black, Multi-racial, Other, White), Hispanic or Latinx ethnicity (Yes vs. No),
year in school (1st through 5th), residence (On-campus vs. Off-campus), Greek membership (Yes
vs. No), relationship status (Multiple partners, Single partner, No partner), know others who
were infected (Yes vs. No), and number of days per week drinking alcohol (>1 day in a week vs.

≤1 day in a week). Moreover, among those who self-reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 testing
history we collected data about their symptoms, symptomatic (Yes vs. No), and among students
who reported drinking alcohol, we collected data about the number of people they hung out with

while drinking (>4 people vs. ≤4 people). All the above-mentioned predictors were self-reported
in the online baseline survey (Appendix A).
Three of the above-mentioned variables were collected as continuous variables but were
dichotomized for analyses: (1) Age: Undergraduate students are mainly 18-22 years old. We
recoded this continuous variable as categorical with 22 years old as the cut-off point. (2) Number
of days per week drinking alcohol: This continuous variable could range from 0 to 7. We used
the median of one as the cut-off point for this variable. (3) Number of people hanging out with
while drinking: This continuous variable could range from 0 to 1,000. We used the median of
four as the cut-off point.
2.5 Bias
We took several measures to reduce different sources of bias, such as non-response and selection
biases. We used a random sample to decrease selection bias. Besides the initial study invitation
email, we sent two reminders to participants to increase the response rate. We also identified
different types of partial responses and sent reminder emails to participants who had only
completed part of the baseline study. Moreover, to maximize the number of participants showing
up for their SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing appointment, we sent appointment reminders to
participants 6-12 hours before their appointments.
2.6 Study Size
The sample size calculation for the RCT was calculated before conducting that study. However,
the power analysis was specific to the RCT aims, and therefore no sample size calculation was
conducted for the current cross-sectional analysis of the baseline data.

2.7 Statistical Methods
We used the normal approximation interval (Wald interval) to calculate the point
prevalence/seroprevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for positive SARS-CoV2 antibody test and self-reported history of positive SARS-CoV-2 test. We used Poisson
regression models with a robust error variance to calculate the unadjusted/crude associations
between different baseline variables and the self-reported SARS-CoV-2 testing history and
SARS-CoV-2 antibody laboratory test outcome variables (15, 16). We report the unadjusted
prevalence ratios and 95% CIs for these associations. Values of “Don’t Know” were recoded as
missing in the analysis. We used complete case analysis. Lastly, in a sensitivity analysis, to
remove any biases that age outliers were potentially introducing to our findings, we restricted our
sample to students below 30 years old and ran the models.
3 Results
3.1 Participants
We sampled 7,499 IUB undergraduate students, 4,069 students were likely eligible based on
county of residence, 1,397 confirmed eligibility and consented to participate in the study, and
1,076 attended a laboratory test visit and provided SARS-CoV-2 antibody test data. Overall, 21
students explicitly refused to participate in the study while 2,651 tacitly refused via non-response
or by not signing the consent form. Moreover, among students who consented to participate in
the study, 321 students did not schedule or attend a baseline antibody test appointment.
For the self-reported SARS-CoV-2 testing history outcome, out of the 1,397 students who
consented to participate in the study, 133 did not answer any of the questions in the baseline

survey, and 25 students had missing values for the self-reported outcome. Overall, 1,239
answered the survey questions about SARS-CoV-2 testing history (Figure 1). We calculated the
response rate to be 26.4% for the antibody testing outcome and 30.4% for the self-reported
SARS-CoV-2 testing history outcome.
3.2 Descriptive Data
For the SARS-CoV-2 antibody laboratory test outcome, participants were on average 20 years
old (Median, Standard Deviation: 20, 2.5), female (64%), white (79%), non-Hispanic (93%),
senior student (28%), off-campus residents (69%), non-Greek affiliated (76%), and single and
not dating/hooking up with anyone (40%). Moreover, 49% of participants knew others with
SARS-CoV-2 positive history, 46% reported drinking alcohol >1 day per week, and 41%
reported hanging out with >4 people while drinking (Table 1). Similar trends in demographic and
behavioral variables were found for the self-reported SARS-CoV-2 testing history outcome.
3.3 Outcome Data
Overall, 49 students (out of 1076) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [Prevalence (95%
CI): 4.6% (3.3%, 5.8%)] and 128 students (out of 1239) self-reported ever having tested positive
for SARS-CoV-2 infection [Prevalence (95% CI): 10.3% (8.6%, 12.0%)] (Table 2).
3.4 Main Results
3.4.1 Objective outcome: SARS-CoV-2 antibody laboratory test
Students affiliated with Greek fraternities or sororities were 3.28 (95% CI: 1.91, 5.64) times
more likely to have a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody test result compared to non-Greek

students. Those with multiple partners were 2.52 (95% CI: 1.19, 5.33) times more likely to have
a positive antibody test compared to students with no partner. However, those with single
partners had similar distribution of positive antibody tests compared to those with no partner [PR
(95% CI): 1.04 (0.5, 1.93)]. Students who knew others in their immediate environment with
SARS-CoV-2 positive history were 4.23 (95% CI: 2.07, 8.63) times more likely to test positive
for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies compared to those who did not know anyone with SARS-CoV-2
infection. Students who self-reported drinking alcohol more than one day a week were 1.79 (95%
CI: 1.02, 3.16) more likely to have a positive antibody test compared to those who self-reported
drinking alcohol equal to or less than one day a week. Similarly, students who socialized with
more than four people when drinking alcohol were 2.21 (95% CI: 1.26, 3.90) times more likely
to have a positive antibody test result compared to those who socialized with four or less people
while drinking alcohol (Table 2). Because there were few to zero observations in many of the
cells of race and outcome variables cross tabulations, we could not fit the unadjusted models
with race as independent variable (Models with race variable did not converge).
3.4.2 Subjective outcome: self-reported SARS-CoV-2 testing history
Similar results were observed for the associations between the aforementioned factors and the
self-reported SARS-CoV-2 testing history outcome (Table 2). However, the point estimates for
this outcome were measured more precisely with tighter confidence intervals, likely because of
the larger sample size. For all associations, the magnitude of the prevalence ratios attenuated, yet
they remained significantly and substantially above null. The largest attenuation in the
magnitude occurred for knowing others who were infected variable, from 4.23 to 3.03 (95% CI:
2.04, 4.49).

3.5 Other analysis
We also evaluated the association between SARS-CoV-2 antibody laboratory test and selfreported SARS-CoV-2 testing history outcomes (Table 2). Of the 46 students who tested positive
for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and had complete self-reported testing data, 29 self-reported they
had previously tested positive for an active SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 17 self-reported they had
never tested positive for an active SARS-CoV-2 infection. The magnitude of the association was
large [PR (95% CI): 16.73 (9.54, 29.33)]. Lastly, similar results were found in our sensitivity
analysis of restricting the sample size to students below 30 years old (Appendix B).
4 Discussion
4.1 Key Results
In September 2020, near the beginning of the fall semester, seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in
our random study sample of Indiana University Bloomington undergraduate students was 4.6%,
while the prevalence of students who self-reported SARS-CoV-2 infection history was 10.3%.
We found that students who had Greek membership, had multiple partners, knew others in their
immediate environment with SARS-CoV-2 infection, drank alcohol more than one day a week,
and hanged out with more than four people when drinking were more likely to be tested positive
for SARS-CoV-2 antibody test and self-report positive SARS-CoV-2 test history.
4.2 Interpretation
The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among IUB undergraduate students was lower than the
nationwide seroprevalence estimate in July 2020 (9.3%) (17) and higher than the Indiana
statewide estimate in April 2020 (1.1%) (18). However, our findings are comparable to that of
11

other large universities in the U.S. (2, 19). Selection bias might have influenced our
seroprevalence estimate because we asked students not to attend their laboratory test
appointment if they were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the last two weeks, had been
directed to isolate or quarantine, or were experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. This selection bias
could have altered our seroprevalence estimate in either direction. However, because people with
COVID-19 symptoms are more likely to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, the bias likely caused an
underestimation of the true seroprevalence. Selection bias did not affect our estimate for the
prevalence of students who self-reported ever having a SARS-CoV-2 positive test because this
information was collected on the baseline online survey.
We also found that the prevalence of a self-reported SARS-CoV-2 positive test was higher than
the seroprevalence collected via the laboratory test visit. At least some of this difference could be
explained by the time lag between SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody development and the
fact that some infected individuals might never develop antibodies against the virus (20).
However, it is less likely that the difference is because of immune memory loss in previously
infected students. A recent study (yet to be peer reviewed) found that antibodies might last for
years in recovered individuals (21, 22). This difference could also be due to the selection bias
explained in the previous paragraph. Our team plans future analyses to further evaluate the
reasons for the observed difference in the outcomes’ prevalence estimates.
Living in one of IU’s fraternities and sororities was a strong risk factor for seropositivity.
Similarly, on other campuses, clusters of COVID-19 cases have been linked to Greek houses
(23). Congregate living settings and the unofficial activities and gatherings (e.g., rush events)
could possibly explain this strong association (23). We further found that students who were
dating/hooking up with multiple people were more likely to self-report a positive SARS-CoV-2

test or have a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody test result. To our knowledge, this is the first study
that quantitatively evaluated this association. SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted through
direct contact with infected individuals or contaminated surfaces (i.e., fomite transmission)
and/or exposure to large and small droplets that contain the virus (24), all of which are possible
when students are dating/hooking up with multiple partners. Likewise, students who knew others
with SARS-CoV-2 infection in their immediate environment were more likely to self-report a
positive SARS-CoV-2 test or have a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody test result. These students
could also have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 because of being in prolonged contact with the
infected individuals.
Drinking alcohol more than once a week and drinking in groups of larger than four increased the
likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Young adults might adhere less strictly to COVID-19
prevention measures when drinking alcohol (8), probably because of cognitive distortion that
follows drinking (25). In a social drinking event, students are likely to drink more when more
friends are present (9), because of peer pressure, which can exacerbate the cognitive distortion
and correspondingly cause further noncompliance with COVID-19 prevention measures. More
importantly, presence of more friends in a drinking event brings in more possible sources of
SARS-CoV-2 infections. Holding social events via online video-conferencing technologies, such
as Zoom, or in settings where physical distancing is possible, avoiding excessive drinking, and
drinking only with people who live in one’s household could help to reduce transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 among college students.
4.3 Limitations and generalizability

In this study, because we used cross-sectional baseline data, we cannot assess temporal ordering
between different study variables and outcomes. Even though confounding is usually a limitation
in observational studies, adjusting for confounding was not necessary in the current study
because our research questions were descriptive and predictive, and they were not about causal
inference (26). Lastly, all data, except SARS-CoV-2 antibody laboratory test results, were
collected through self-reported surveys. Different sources of bias, such as measurement and
recall biases, could affect the quality of self-reported data. However, we found a very strong
association between a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody laboratory test result and a positive selfreported SARS-CoV-2 testing history, suggesting measurement bias may not be a significant
concern for the self-reported data.
Despite the limitations, our study provides insight into the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2
seropositivity among college students and can help educational administrators and policy makers
when developing future strategies for combating the pandemic in these settings. Particularly, as
we used random sampling methods in this study to increase the external validity of our results,
our findings may be applicable to other large universities in the U.S.
