Abstract
Background
The efficacy of interleukin-6 receptor antagonists in critically ill patients with coronavirus
disease 2019 (Covid-19) is unclear.

Methods
We evaluated tocilizumab and sarilumab in an ongoing international, multifactorial,
adaptive platform trial. Adult patients with Covid-19, within 24 hours of commencing organ
support in an intensive care unit, were randomized to receive either tocilizumab (8mg/kg)
or sarilumab (400mg) or standard care (control). The primary outcome was an ordinal scale
combining in-hospital mortality (assigned -1) and days free of organ support to day 21. The
trial uses a Bayesian statistical model with pre-defined triggers to declare superiority,
efficacy, equivalence or futility.

Results
Tocilizumab and sarilumab both met the pre-defined triggers for efficacy. At the time of full
analysis 353 patients had been assigned to tocilizumab, 48 to sarilumab and 402 to control.
Median organ support-free days were 10 (interquartile range [IQR] -1, 16), 11 (IQR 0, 16)
and 0 (IQR -1, 15) for tocilizumab, sarilumab and control, respectively. Relative to control,
median adjusted odds ratios were 1.64 (95% credible intervals [CrI] 1.25, 2.14) for
tocilizumab and 1.76 (95%CrI 1.17, 2.91) for sarilumab, yielding >99.9% and 99.5% posterior
probabilities of superiority compared with control. Hospital mortality was 28.0% (98/350)
for tocilizumab, 22.2% (10/45) for sarilumab and 35.8% (142/397) for control. All secondary
outcomes and analyses supported efficacy of these IL-6 receptor antagonists.

with the IL-6 receptor antagonists, tocilizumab and sarilumab, improved outcome, including
survival. (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT02735707)

Background
Globally, there have been over 79 million reported cases of Coronavirus Infectious Disease
2019 (Covid-19) with over 1.75 million deaths.1 Only corticosteroids are known to improve
survival for severely ill patients.2 The benefit from corticosteroids in critically ill patients
supports the concept that an excessive host inflammatory response is responsible for much
of the morbidity and mortality from Covid-19.
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is released in response to infection and stimulates inflammatory
pathways as part of the acute phase response. Tocilizumab and sarilumab are monoclonal
antibodies that inhibit both membrane-bound and soluble IL-6 receptors and are used to
treat inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and cytokine release syndrome
after chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy (tocilizumab). Their clinical use has
been described in Covid-19,3-5 however, randomized controlled trials to date have been
inconclusive.6-10
We investigated the effectiveness of tocilizumab and sarilumab on survival and organ
support in critically ill patients with Covid-19 in the Randomized, Embedded, Multifactorial
Adaptive Platform Trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (REMAP-CAP).

Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
REMAP-CAP is an international, adaptive platform trial designed to determine best
treatment strategies for patients with severe pneumonia in both pandemic and nonpandemic settings. REMAP-CAP’s design and first results, regarding corticosteroids in Covid19, were published previously.11,12
Patients eligible for the platform are assessed for eligibility and potentially randomized to
multiple interventions across multiple domains. A 'domain' covers a common therapeutic
area (e.g., antiviral therapy) and contains two or more interventions (including control e.g.
'no antiviral'). Patients are randomized to one intervention in each domain for which they
are eligible. The REMAP-CAP trial is defined by a master ('core') protocol with individual
appendices for each domain, regional governance and adaptations for a declared pandemic.
The trial is overseen by a blinded International Trial Steering Committee (ITSC) and an
unblinded independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The trial is approved by
relevant regional ethics committees (see Supplementary Appendix for more detail) and is
conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki. Written or verbal informed consent, in accordance with regional
legislation, is obtained from all patients or their surrogates.
The trial has multiple funders, internationally, with multiple regional sponsors. Roche
Products Ltd and Sanofi supported the trial through provision of tocilizumab and sarilumab
in the United Kingdom. The funders, sponsors, and Roche and Sanofi had no role in
designing the trial, analyzing data, writing the manuscript, or making the decision to submit
for publication. All authors vouch for the data and analyses, as well as for the fidelity of this
report to the trial protocol and statistical analysis plan.

Participants
Critically ill patients, aged >18 years, with suspected or confirmed Covid-19, admitted to an
intensive care unit (ICU) and receiving respiratory or cardiovascular organ support were
classified as severe state and were eligible for enrollment in the Covid-19 Immune
Modulation Therapy domain. Exclusion criteria included presumption that death was
imminent with lack of commitment to full support, and prior participation in REMAP-CAP
within 90 days. Additional exclusion criteria, specific for the Immune Modulation Therapy
domain, are listed in the Supplementary Appendix.

Randomization
The Immune Modulation Therapy domain included five interventions: two IL-6 receptor
antagonists, tocilizumab and sarilumab; an IL-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra; and
interferon beta-1a; as well as control (no immune modulation). Investigators at each site
selected a priori at least two interventions, one of which had to be control, to which
patients would be randomized. Participants were randomized via centralized computer
program to each intervention (available at the site) starting with balanced assignment for
tocilizumab, sarilumab or control (e.g. 1:1 if two interventions available, 1:1:1 if three
interventions available).
Tocilizumab, at a dose of 8mg/kg of actual body weight (up to a maximum of 800mg), was
administered as an intravenous infusion over one hour; this dose could be repeated 12-24
hours later at the discretion of the treating clinician. Sarilumab, 400mg, was administered as
an intravenous infusion once only. All investigational drugs were dispensed by local
pharmacies and were open-label.

Procedures
Other aspects of patient management were provided per each site's standard of care. In
addition to assignments in this domain, participants could be randomized to other
interventions within other domains, depending on domains active at the site, patient
eligibility, and consent (see www.remapcap.org). Randomization to the Corticosteroid
domain for Covid-19 closed on June 17, 2020.12 Thereafter, corticosteroids were allowed as
per recommended standard of care.
Although clinical staff were aware of individual patient intervention assignment, neither
they nor the ITSC were provided any information about aggregate patient outcomes.

Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was respiratory and cardiovascular organ support-free days up to day
21. In this composite ordinal outcome, all deaths within hospital are assigned the worst
outcome (–1). Among survivors, respiratory and cardiovascular organ support-free days are
calculated up to day 21, such that a higher number represents faster recovery. This outcome
was used in a recent Food and Drug Administration approved trial and 1.5 days was
considered a minimally clinically important difference.13 Secondary outcomes were all prespecified and details are in the Supplementary Appendix.

Statistical Analysis
REMAP-CAP uses a Bayesian design with no maximum sample size. Regular, interim analyses
are conducted and randomization continues, potentially with response-adaptive
randomization with preferential assignment to those interventions that appear most
favorable, until a pre-defined statistical trigger is met.

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.07.21249390; this version posted January 9, 2021. The copyright holder for this

The primary analysis was generated from a Bayesian cumulative logistic model, which
calculated posterior probability distributions of the 21-day organ support-free days (primary
outcome) based on evidence accumulated in the trial and assumed prior knowledge in the
form of a prior distribution. Prior distributions for individual treatment effects were neutral.
The primary model adjusted for location (site, nested within country), age (categorized into
six groups), sex, and time-period (two-week epochs). The model contained treatment
effects for each intervention within each domain and pre-specified treatment-by-treatment
interactions across domains. The treatment effects for tocilizumab and sarilumab were
“nested” in the model with a hierarchical prior distribution sharing a common mean and
variance. This prior structure facilitates dynamic borrowing between the two IL-6 receptor
antagonists that borrows more information when the observed effects are similar and less
when they are different.14

The primary analysis was conducted on all severe state patients with Covid-19 randomized to
any domain up to November 19, 2020 (and with complete follow-up). The inclusion of
additional patients enrolled outside the Immune Modulation Therapy domain allows
maximal incorporation of all information, providing the most robust estimation of the
coefficients of all covariates, as per the principle of the REMAP-CAP design.11,12 Importantly,
not all patients were eligible for all domains nor for all interventions (dependent on active
domains and interventions at the site, eligibility criteria, and patient/surrogate consent).
Therefore, the model included covariate terms reflecting each patient's domain eligibility,
such that the estimate of an intervention’s effectiveness, relative to any other intervention
within that domain, was generated from those patients that might have been eligible to be
randomized to those interventions within the domain.

The cumulative log odds for the primary outcome was modeled such that a parameter >0
reflects an increase in the cumulative log odds for the organ support-free days outcome,
implying benefit. There was no imputation of missing outcomes. The model was fit using a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that drew iteratively (10,000 draws) from the joint
posterior distribution, allowing calculation of odds ratios with their 95% credible intervals
(CrI) and the probability that each intervention (including control) was optimal in the
domain, that an intervention was superior compared with control (efficacy), that two noncontrol interventions were equivalent, or an intervention was futile compared with control.
An odds ratio >1 represents improved survival and/or more organ support-free days. The
pre-defined statistical triggers for trial conclusions and disclosure of results were: a >99%
posterior probability that an intervention was optimal compared with all other interventions;
an inferiority conclusion if <0.25% posterior probability that an intervention was optimal; an
intervention efficacy if >99% posterior probability the odds ratio was >1 compared with
control; intervention futility if <5% posterior probability the odds ratio was >1.2 compared
with control, or equivalence if >90% probability the odds ratio was between 1/1.2 and 1.2 for
two non-control interventions.

Analysis of the primary outcome was then repeated in a second model using only data from
those patients enrolled in domains that had stopped and were unblinded at the time of
analysis with no adjustment for assignment in other ongoing domains. The secondary
outcomes were also analyzed in this second model. One subgroup analysis, based on terciles
of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) at inclusion, was pre-specified. Further details of all
analyses are provided in the Supplementary Appendix. Pre-specified analyses are listed in
the statistical analysis plan. Data management and summaries were created using R version

Results
These are preliminary results. As further follow-up and analysis continues, minor changes
may occur.
The first patient with Covid-19 was enrolled into REMAP-CAP on March 9, 2020 and the first
patient randomized in the Immune Modulation Therapy domain on April 19 as tocilizumab
became available. Sarilumab only became available later. At a scheduled interim analysis,
the independent DSMB reported that tocilizumab had met the statistical trigger for efficacy
(posterior probability 99.75%, odds ratio 1.87, 95%CrI 1.20, 2.76) based on an interim
analysis of patients as of October 28. As per protocol, further assignment to control closed
on November 19 with randomization continuing between different active immune
modulation interventions. At this time, 2,046 patients had been randomized in at least one
domain in the severe disease state of REMAP-CAP and 895 had been randomized in the
Immune Modulation Therapy domain (366 to tocilizumab, 48 to sarilumab, 412 to control
and 69 to other interventions within the domain) in 113 sites across six countries (Figure 1).
Thirty patients subsequently withdrew consent, and 11 patients had missing primary
outcome data. Following a subsequent interim analysis, the DSMB reported that sarilumab
had also met the statistical trigger for efficacy and so these results are also reported.

Patients
Baseline characteristics were balanced across intervention groups and typical of a critically
ill population with Covid-19 (Table 1). All but three patients were receiving respiratory
support at the time of randomization, including high flow nasal oxygen (28.8%), noninvasive (41.5%) and invasive (29.4%) mechanical ventilation. The majority of patients
(n=707) were enrolled after June 17 and the announcement of the dexamethasone result

from the RECOVERY trial15 and of these patients, 93.3% (610/654) were treated with
corticosteroids at enrollment or within the following 48 hours. Of the 158 patients recruited
before June 17, 107 were randomized in the previously published Corticosteroid domain
within REMAP-CAP, 41 allocated to a seven-day course of hydrocortisone and 39 to shockdependent hydrocortisone.12 Remdesivir use was recorded in 32.8% (265/807) of patients.
In the tocilizumab group, 92% received at least one dose, 29% receiving a second dose at
the discretion of the treating clinician. In the sarilumab group, 90% received the allocated
drug and in the control group, 2% were given one of the immune modulating drugs outside
the trial protocol.

Primary Outcome
Median organ support-free days were 10 (interquartile range [IQR] -1, 16), 11 (IQR 0, 16)
and 0 (IQR -1, 15) for tocilizumab, sarilumab and control groups, respectively (Table 2 and
Figure 2). Compared with control, median adjusted odds ratios (primary model) were 1.64
(95%CrI 1.25, 2.14) for tocilizumab and 1.76 (95%CrI 1.17, 2.91) for sarilumab, yielding
>99.9% and 99.5% posterior probabilities of superiority. Hospital mortality was 28.0%
(98/350) for tocilizumab, 22.2% (10/45) for sarilumab and 35.8% (142/397) for control. The
hospital mortality pooling both IL-6 receptor antagonists was 27.3% (108/395). Compared
with control, median adjusted odds ratios for hospital survival were 1.64 (95%CrI 1.14, 2.35)
for tocilizumab and 2.01 (95% CrI 1.18, 4.71) for sarilumab, yielding 99.6% and 99.5%
posterior probabilities of superiority. The sensitivity analyses were consistent with the
primary analysis (Tables S1 and S2). Of note, the estimates of the treatment effect for
patients treated either with tocilizumab or sarilumab and corticosteroids in combination
were greater than for any intervention on its own (Tables S3 and S4), suggesting benefit of

using both IL6 receptor antagonists and corticosteroids together in this critically ill
population.

Secondary Outcomes
The secondary outcomes are listed in Table 2 and Figure 3. Tocilizumab and sarilumab were
effective across all secondary outcomes, including 90-day survival, time to ICU and hospital
discharge, and improvement in the World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale at day
14.16 Similar effects were seen in all CRP subgroups (Table S1).
There were nine serious adverse events reported in the tocilizumab group including one
secondary bacterial infection, five bleeds, two cardiac events and one deterioration in
vision. There were 11 serious adverse events in the control group, four bleeds and seven
thromboses; and no serious adverse events in the sarilumab group.

Discussion
We show that in critically ill patients with Covid-19 the IL-6 receptor antagonists,
tocilizumab and sarilumab, are both effective compared with current standard of care,
which included corticosteroids in the majority of patients (>80%). Benefit was consistent
across primary and secondary outcomes, and across subgroups and secondary analyses.

Multiple observational and ex-vivo laboratory studies have demonstrated that IL-6 is an
important cytokine associated with disease severity and mortality.17-19 A recent genomic
analysis of critically ill patients with Covid-19, demonstrated that genetic variants in the IL-6
inflammatory pathway may have a causal link to life-threatening disease.20 There is
therefore a good rationale to support inhibiting IL-6 pathways in severe Covid-19.

Our study should be compared with other trials of IL-6 receptor antagonists in Covid-19.
Many previously reported trials included less severely ill patients and excluded patients
already receiving respiratory support.6-8 In those studies, there was no clear evidence that
tocilizumab was effective at preventing disease progression, and no evidence of benefit on
survival, although they may have lacked power to detect differences in patient-centered
outcomes. The EMPACTA trial reported that patients treated with tocilizumab were less
likely to progress to need mechanical ventilation or to die by day 28 (hazard ratio 0.56,
95%CI 0.32, 0.97), although there was no difference in overall mortality (risk difference

patients. It reported no difference in clinical status or mortality at day 28, although the time

trial of sarilumab reported no benefit in the whole population but a trend towards reduced
mortality in the critically ill group.21 We saw both an improved time to clinical improvement
as well as a reduction in mortality. It is therefore possible that the maximum benefit from IL6 inhibition is seen in the most severely ill patients with Covid-19. However, it is important
to note that in our trial, patients had to be enrolled within 24 hours after starting organ
support. This may be an important factor to maximize effectiveness; treating critically ill
patients early, while any developing organ dysfunction may be more reversible.

Investigators have proposed using CRP or other inflammatory markers to select patients
with a hyperinflammatory state for treatment.6,8 We saw beneficial effects of IL-6 inhibition
across all CRP subgroups in this critically ill population. Although Covid-19 has been
described as producing a “cytokine storm”,22 recent studies have shown that systemic levels
of cytokines may not be as high as seen in other causes of sepsis and ARDS.23 It may be that
local inflammation, demonstrated by respiratory dysfunction, is a more useful indicator of
which patients will benefit from IL-6 inhibition. There has been concern about administering
immune modulating drugs, such as tocilizumab and sarilumab, to patients critically ill due to
a novel virus infection. One consistent result across all trials to date, including our trial, is
there has been no increased rates of serious adverse events reported.

REMAP-CAP’s pragmatic, international design means that our results are likely generalizable
to the wider critically ill patient population with Covid-19. It, of course, has limitations. Most
notably, it uses an open-label design but awareness of intervention assignment is unlikely to
affect the primary outcome. Furthermore, as IL-6 inhibition is known to have a profound
effect on CRP,24,25 even if the study drug was blinded, intervention assignment would

become “revealed” rapidly after administration. As this is an early, preliminary report some
data are missing including 11 outcomes. Some patients still remain in hospital and so longterm outcomes may differ from the short-term outcomes presented here. The multifactorial
design also allows multiple different interventions to be evaluated simultaneously, providing
more efficient results and accounting for potential treatment-by-treatment interactions.
Many of these interventions continue, and their effects and possible interactions are still to
be reported.

In conclusion, in critically ill adult patients with Covid-19 receiving organ support in intensive
care, treatment with the IL-6 receptor antagonists, tocilizumab and sarilumab, improved
outcomes, including survival.

supplement
b = only includes patients when tocilizumab and /or sarilumab was a randomization option
c = other interventions includes anakinra, interferon β1a, and no immune modulation when
tocilizumab and / or sarilumab was not available as a randomization option
d = The primary analysis of alternative interventions within the immune modulation domain
is estimated from a model that adjusts for patient factors and for assignment to
interventions in other domains. To obtain the most reliable estimation of the effect of these
patient factors and of other interventions on the primary outcome, all patients enrolled in
the severe COVID-19 cohort (for whom there is consent and follow-up) are included.
Importantly, however, the model also factors eligibility for the immune modulation domain
and its interventions, such that the final estimate of an immune modulation domain
intervention’s effectiveness relative to any other within that domain is generated from
those patients that might have been eligible to be randomized to those interventions within
the domain.

The primary analysis of organ support-free days (OSFD) and in-hospital mortality used data from all
participants enrolled in the trial who met COVID-19 severe state criteria and were randomized within at least
one domain (n=1928), adjusting for age, sex, time period, site, region, domain and intervention eligibility and
intervention assignment.
Other analyses were restricted to participants enrolled in the Immune Modulation domain and any domains
that have ceased recruitment (Corticosteroid and Covid-19 Antiviral domains) (n=1293), adjusting for age, sex,
time period, site, region, domain and intervention eligibility and intervention assignment.
Definitions of outcomes are provided in Methods and the study protocol.
All models are structured such that a higher OR or HR is favorable. The WHO scale ranges from 0 (no disease)
