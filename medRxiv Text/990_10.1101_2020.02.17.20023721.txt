Abstract

63

The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak originating from Wuhan, China, poses

64

a threat to global health. While it’s evident that the virus invades respiratory tract and

65

transmits from human to human through airway, other viral tropisms and transmission

66

routes remain unknown. We tested viral RNA in stool from 73 SARS-CoV-2-infected

67

hospitalized patients using rRT-PCR. 53.42% of the patients tested positive in stool.

68

23.29% of the patients remained positive in feces even after the viral RNA decreased

69

to undetectable level in respiratory tract. The viral RNA was also detected in

70

gastrointestinal tissues. Furthermore, gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelia showed

71

positive immunofluorescent staining of viral host receptor ACE2 and viral

72

nucleocapsid protein in a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results provide

73

evidence for gastrointestinal infection of SARS-CoV-2, highlighting its potential

74

fecal-oral transmission route.

82

Since the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in Wuhan, China, at the

83

end of 2019, the virus has spread to 25 countries, infecting more than 68000 people

84

and causing over 1600 deaths globally. Although a series of extraordinary social

85

distancing measures have been implemented in China, the number of infections

86

continues to rise. The viral infection causes a series of respiratory illness including

87

severe respiratory syndrome, indicating the virus most likely infects respiratory

88

epithelial cells and spreads mainly via respiratory tract from human to human.

89

However, viral target cells and organs haven’t been fully determined, impeding our

90

understanding of the pathogenesis of the viral infection and viral transmission routes.

91

According to a recent case report, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in a stool

92

specimen1, indicating the possibility of the viral extrarespiratory infection and

93

additional transmission routes to respiratory one. It has been proved that

94

SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a viral receptor for entry process2,3. ACE2 mRNA is

95

highly expressed in gastrointestinal system4, providing a prerequisite for

96

SARS-CoV-2 infection. To further understand the clinical significance of

97

SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces, we examined the viral RNA in feces from 71 patients

98

with SARS-CoV-2 during their hospitalization. Viral RNA and intracellular viral

99

protein staining were also examined in gastrointestinal tissues from one of the

100

patients.

Methods

102

From February 1 to 14, 2020, clinical specimens including serum, nasopharyngeal and

103

oropharyngeal swabs, urine, stool and tissues from 73 SARS-CoV-2-infected

104

hospitalized patients were obtained in accordance with China Disease Control and

105

Prevention (CDC) guidelines and tested for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 73

106

hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected patients using the China CDC-standardized

107

quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay5. Clinical characteristics of the 73

108

patients were shown in Table 1. The esophageal, gastric, duodenal and rectal tissues

109

were obtained from one of the patients using endoscopy. The patient’s clinical

110

information was described in Supplementary Case Clinical Information and

111

Supplementary table 1. Endoscopic overview images were shown in Supplementary

112

Figure 1. Histological staining (H&E) as well as viral receptor ACE2 and viral

113

nucleocapsid (NP) staining were performed as described in Supplementary methods.

114

The images were obtained using a laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSM880, Carl

115

Zeiss MicroImaging) and shown in Figure 1.

Results

117

From February 1 to 14, 2020, of all the 73 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, 39

118

(53.42%) including 25 males and 14 females tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in

119

stool (Table 1). The age of patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool ranges

120

from 10 months to 78 years old (Table 1). Duration time of positive stool ranges from

121

1 to 12 days till the date of writing the manuscript on February 14, 2020 (Table 1).

122

Furthermore, 17 (23.29%) patients remained positive in stool after showing negative

123

in respiratory samples (Table 1).

124

Gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed on the patient described in Supplementary

Material. Abnormality was not observed in the gastric, duodenum, colon and rectum

126

except for mucosal lesions and bleeding in esophagus as described in Supplementary

127

results (Supplementary Figure 1). All the gastrointestinal tissue samples obtained

128

from esophageal, esophageal non-lesion, gastric, duodenum and rectum mucosa tested

129

positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Supplementary Table 1).

130

The mucous epithelium of esophagus, stomach, duodenum and rectum showed no

131

significant damage with H&E staining (Figure 1). Infiltrate of occasional lymphocytes

132

was observed in esophageal squamous epithelium (Figure 1). In lamina propria of

133

stomach, duodenum and rectum, numerous infiltrating plasma cells and lymphocytes

134

with interstitial edema were seen (Figure 1).

135

Importantly, viral host receptor ACE2 stained positive mainly in the cytoplasm of

136

gastrointestinal epithelial cells (Figure 1). To note, we observed that ACE2 is rarely

137

expressed in esophageal epithelium, but abundantly distributed in cilia of glandular

138

epithelia (Figure 1). Staining of viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) was visualized in

139

the cytoplasm of gastric, duodenal and rectum glandular epithelial cell, but not in

140

esophageal epithelium (Figure 1).

141

Discussion

142

In this manuscript, we provide evidence for gastrointestinal infection of SARS-CoV-2

143

and its possible fecal-oral transmission route. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread,

144

it’s important to elucidate the viral transmission routes and take appropriate measures

145

to control viral spread. Since viruses spread from infected to uninfected cells6, viral

146

specific target cells or organs are determinants of viral transmission routes.

147

Receptor-dependent viral entry is the first step of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our

148

immunofluorescent data showed that ACE2 protein, which has been proved to be the

149

receptor of SARS-CoV-2, is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric,

150

duodenal and rectal epithelia, allowing the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cells. ACE2

151

staining is rarely seen in esophageal mucosa probably because esophageal epithelium

152

is mainly composed of squamous epithelial cells, while gastrointestinal epithelium

153

below esophagus has abundant ACE2-expressed glandular epithelial cells.

154

Coronavirus genome encodes the spike protein, nucleocapsid protein, membrane

155

protein and envelop protein to form a complete viral particle7. Beyond binding to viral

156

genome to make up nucleocapsid, the nucleocapsid protein (NP) localizes to

157

endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi region to facilitate viral assembly and budding8. Our

158

results of viral RNA detection and intracellular staining of NP in gastric, duodenal and

159

rectal epithelia demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infects these gastrointestinal glandular

160

epithelial cells. Although viral RNA was also detected in esophageal mucous tissue,

161

absence of NP staining in esophageal mucosa indicates low viral infection in

162

esophageal mucosa probably due to lack of ACE2 protein expression. The data of

163

viral protein staining are in line with the data of ACE2 staining, confirming the

164

importance of ACE2 protein expression for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

165

After viral entry, virus-specific RNA and proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm to

166

assembly new virions9, which can be released to gastrointestinal tract. Recently, we

167

and others have isolated infectious SARS-CoV-2 from stool (Manuscript under

168

revision), confirming the release of the infectious virions to the gastrointestinal tract.

169

Therefore, fecal-oral transmission could be an additional route for SARS-CoV-2

170

spread. Prevention of viral fecal-oral transmission should be taken into consideration

171

to control the spread the virus.

172

The immune response to the viral infection of gastrointestinal tract needs to be further

173

investigated. In this report, we observed infiltration of plasma cells and lymphocytes

174

without obvious damage in gastrointestinal mucosa. The lesion and bleeding of the

175

esophageal mucosa from a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was probably

176

stress-associated.

177

Our results highlight the clinical significance of testing viral RNA in feces by

178

real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) since infectious

179

virions released from gastrointestinal tract can be monitored by the test. According to

180

the current CDC guidance for disposition of patients with SARS-CoV-2, the decision

181

to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions for hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients

182

is based on negative results of rRT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from at least two

183

sequential respiratory tract specimens collected ≥24 hours apart10. However, we

184

observed in more than 20% of SARS-CoV-2 patients that the viral RNA remained

185

positive in feces even after negative conversion of the viral RNA in respiratory tract,

186

indicating that viral fecal-oral transmission can occur even after viral clearance in

187

respiratory tract. Therefore, we strongly recommend that rRT-PCR testing for

188

SARS-CoV-2 from feces should be performed routinely in SARS-CoV-2-infected

189

patients, and Transmission-Based Precautions for hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected

190

patients should continue if feces tests positive by rRT-PCR testing. In summary, our

191

results provide evidence for gastrointestinal infection of SARS-CoV-2, which could

192

result in fecal-oral transmission.
