Abstract
The outbreak of COVID-19 originated in Wuhan has become a global epidemic of contagious
diseases, which poses a serious threat to human life and health, especially for those with
underlined diseases. However, Impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD center and HD patients
are still unknown. In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in
the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University from January 14, 2020, the day the first
case was confirmed, to February 17, 2020, the day the epidemic extinction. There are
totally 37 cases among 230 HD patients （16.09%） and 4 cases among 33 （12.12%）staff
being diagnosed with COVID-19. The epidemiology, clinical presentation and immune profile
of dialysis patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied. We found that the two key
measures we took in response to the epidemic, one was upgrading level of prevention and
protection on January 21 and the other one starting universal screening, isolating, and
distributing the infected cases on February 4, were effective in the epidemic control. No new
COVID-19 case had been diagnosed since February 13. During the epidemic, 7 HD patients
died, including 6 with COVID-19 and 1 without COVID-19. The presumed causes of death
were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
diseases, hyperkalemia, etc. Most of the leukocytes in the peripheral blood of the HD patients
infected with COVID-19 decreased, and the CT images of the chest mostly showed the
ground glass like changes on the right side. The symptoms of most of the patients were mild,
and there were no cases admitted to ICU. The frequency of lymphocytes in PBMCs and the
serum level of inflammatory cytokines were assessed in HD patients contracted COVID-19 or
not, non-HD COVID-19 patients, as well as healthy volunteers. The results showed that
lymphocytes of

T cell, Th cells, killer T cells, as well as NK cells in PBMCs of HD patients

decreased significantly than other groups. HD patients with COVID-19 also displayed
remarkable lower serum level of inflammatory cytokines than other COVID-19 patients. Our
study indicates that HD patients are the highly susceptible population and HD centers are high
risk area in the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. Measures of prevention, protection,
screening, isolation, and distribution are essential in the epidemic management and should be
taken in the early stage. HD Patients with COVID-19 are mostly clinical mild and unlikely

progress to severe pneumonia due to the impaired cellular immune function and incapability
of mounting cytokines storm. More attention should be paid to prevent cardiovascular events,
which may be the collateral impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD patients.

Introduction
In December 2019, the initially outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan city spread
rapidly to all over China and even the world, becoming a serious pandemic [1-3]. As
of February 17, 2020, the confirmed COVID-19 case in Wuhan city, nationwide of
China, and world globally reached to 37152, 70635, and 71429 respectively [4, 5]. In
the patients with COVID-19, some special population should be paid special attention
to. Epidemiological survey shows that COVID-19 patients with underlined conditions
such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease or the elderly are not only
susceptible, but also often more serious. These patients are at higher risk of admission
to intensive care or death [6, 7]. In addition, the profound impact inflicted by
COVID-19 on pregnant women and newborns has also been noticed [8, 9]. However,
as far as we know, the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on chronic kidney disease
patients, especially uremic HD patients has not yet been reported. Considering the
large population size of HD patients (There are 7184 registered patients receiving HD
treatment in 61 centers in Wuhan city.), the high aggregation and mobility of HD
center population, and the low immune function of uremic patients [10], the situation
of HD patients under the COVID-19 epidemic should not be ignored.
In this study, we described an outbreak of COVID-19 in one HD center in
Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, which is located in the downtown of Wuhan
city of China. A cluster of HD patients contracted COVID-19 were surveyed and
followed until the day on February 17, 2020. The epidemiological, clinical, laboratory,
and radiological characteristics, and outcomes of some of these patients were
reviewed. We expect our findings will shed light on the appropriate management of
the HD center and HD patients in face of COVID-19 or other similar epidemic
emerging.

Methods
Study design and participants
We reviewed the epidemic course from the first case of COVID-19 infection on
January 14 to the control of the epidemic on February 17 in the HD center of Renmin
Hospital of Wuhan University. Totally 230 maintained HD patients and 33 medical
staff were included in this study. Diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was based on
the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (5th edition)
published by the National Health Commission of China [11]. In brief, the suspect case
of COVID-19 is defined as the one has the epidemiological history or clinical
presentations of fever, respiratory symptoms, or decreased white blood cells or
lymphocytes count. The clinical diagnosed case is recognized when the suspect case
displays the imaging features of pneumonia. The confirmed case is identified if the
suspected cases or clinical diagnosed case is positive in pathogenic test. According to
the guidance of the government, all patients were transferred to the corresponding
designated hospitals for treatment after infection and disease assessment and
classification. We followed up all patients and examined some patients with their
consent. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Renmin
Hospital of Wuhan University (WDRY2020-K064). Written informed consent was
waived by the Ethics Commission of the hospital for emerging infectious diseases.

Data collection
The medical records of all participants were analyzed by the research team of the
Department of Nephrology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. Epidemiological,
clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and outcomes data were obtained
with data collection forms from electronic medical records or specific data
questionnaire. Some data were retrieved from the Hubei Province kidney disease
quality control information platform. The data were reviewed by a trained team of
physicians. Information collected including demographic data, medical history,
underlying comorbidities, symptoms, signs, blood routine test, chest computed

tomographic (CT) scans. During the period of follow up, the odd episode of death
happened among these patients were recorded and the presumed cause of death were
proposed by the research team, based on the time, place and clinical manifestation of
the death.

Virologic Studies
The SARS-CoV-2 detection was done by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) as described
previously [12]. Briefly, nasopharyngeal swab samples of participants were collected
for SARS-CoV-2 test with the detection kit (Bioperfectus, Taizhou, China). The
ORF1ab gene (nCovORF1ab) and the N gene (nCoV-NP) were used for real-time
RT-PCR according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reaction mixture were prepared
and RT-PCR assay was then performed under the following conditions: incubation at
50 °C for 15 minutes and 95 °C for 5 minutes, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for
15 seconds, and extending and collecting fluorescence signal at 55 °C for 45 seconds.

Cellular immune profiling and cytokines measurement
To explore the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the cellular immune profile
and the cytokines production, we successfully recruited 19 COVID-19 contracted HD
patients and 19 non-COVID-19 HD patients in further blood sample collection under
their permission and cooperation. 30 Healthy volunteers were simultaneously enrolled.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum were isolated from the blood
sample from the participants. Isolated PBMCs were stained with a BD multitest IMK
Kit (Cat340503, BD Biosciences) for analyzing the frequency and cell number of total
T, CD4+ T，CD8+ T, B and NK in healthy controls and patients. After being stained,
the cells were measured by flow cytometry on an LSR Fortessa Cell Analyzer (BD
Biosciences) and data analyzed using the FolwJo software (TreeStar). Serum level of
a panel of cytokines covering IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-α, IFN-γ were assayed
using Human Cytokine Standard 27-Plex Assays panel and the Bio-Plex 200 system
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) for all patients according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. All experimental procedures were completed under biosafety level II plus

condition.

Statistical Analysis
Measurement data were expressed using median and interquartile range (IQR) values
and compared using independent group t test. Enumeration data were described as
number (%). All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Statistical Package
for Statistical analysis), and a P value of less than 0.05 is considered as significant
difference.

Results
230 patients and 33 staff in our HD center were included in this study. The
dynamic course of COVID-19 epidemic from emerging to development is schematic
presented in Figure 1. We can see that the first COVID-19 patient was diagnosed on
January 14, and the second diagnosed patient appeared on January 17. Since January
21, patients with COVID-19 had been requested to be isolated and all medical staff
had be asked to upgrade their personal prevention and protection, which including
wearing full protective gear such as waterproof disposable gown, cap, gloves, face
shield, and N95 face mask, and more rigorous cleaning and disinfection. On February
4, 2 new patients and 1 medical staff were further confirmed with COVID-19. So the
center decided to screen all patients and staff on February 4 with the examination
methods of the chest CT and selective blood routine test. There are 31 cases were
newly diagnosed with COVID-19 including 29 HD patients and 2 medical staff on
February 10. Then 4 new COVID-19 diagnose were made on HD patients on
February 13. Since then, until the screening was fully completed on February 17, no
new COVID-19 case had been found. During the period of screening, all of the
patients and staff were classified, isolated, or distributed to designated hospital
according to the government instruction. Figure 2 summarize the management flow
and the outcomes of the followed cluster in the epidemic. It showed that 37 (16.09%)
patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 of which 6 patients had died (Figure 2A).

The other 31 patients were distributed to the designated hospital receiving HD and
other treatment. 4 (12.12%) medical staffs with COVID-19 were treated in isolation
wards. There are totally 7 episodes of death were recorded since the epidemic
outbreak, 2 happened in hospital and 5 at home. Among the 7 died cases, 6 were HD
patients with COVID-19 and the other one was COVID-19 free (Figure 2B). All of
the death were followed and reviewed by our research team, the presumed cause of
death was heart failure, hyperkalemia and cerebrovascular disease, and none of them
succumbed to severe pneumonia based on the appearance of death (Figure 2B).
37 HD patients with COVID-19 demographic and biochemical clinical data were
summarized in Table 1. In total, 23 (62%) men and 14 (38%) women were concluded.
The median age of all patients was 66 years (IQR, 55-81), and the median HD age
was 34 months (IQR, 13-61). Meanwhile, all clinical data involving dry weight,
hemoglobin, albumin, blood calcium, blood phosphorus, blood intact parathyroid
hormone (iPTH) and Kt/VUrea values were also listed in Table 1. Unlike previous
studies, the clinical symptoms of HD patients with COVID-19 were not obvious since
the medical records showed that 4 (11%) patients had fever, 3 (8%) patients had
fatigue, and only 1 (3%) patient had the symptom of cough, chest pain or nausea
respectively (Table 2). Besides, no other symptoms were observed in these patients.
According to chest CT scans reports, 15 (41%) patients showed unilateral
involvement (13 cases in right lung and 2 cases in left lung) and 22 (59%) patients
showed bilateral involvement. 23 (62%) patients had multiple “ground-glass opacity”
lesions in the lung which were regarded as the characteristics of COVID-19
pneumonia (Table 3 and Figure 3).
The immune system is the key defense line for the body to resist and eliminate
the virus. In the antiviral immune response, cellular immunity (including T cells and
NK cells) plays a central role, while humoral immunity plays a coordinating role. The
underlined mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 inflicted harmful effects leading to severe
condition or death in COVID-19 patients is the over response against the virus by
immune system and large amount of cytokines production (cytokine storm) [13]. The
above results show that most of the HD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were in

relatively mild condition. We speculated that this might be related to the special
immune dysfunction of HD patients. Therefore, we detected the frequency of T cell,
NK cell, as well as B cell subpopulation in PBMCs of HD patients in the condition of
SARS-CoV-2 infection or not, and also examined the serum level of several cytokines
simultaneously. We found that the proportion of T cells, Th cells, killer T cells, NK
cells and B lymphocytes in PBMCs of HD patients was very low compared with that
of non HD patients. The proportion of these cells in HD patients with SARS-CoV-2
infection was decreased much more. (Figure 4) In addition, we observed that the
serum levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF - α, inf - γ in non HD patients with
SARS-CoV-2 infection were significantly higher than the normal level, while the
serum levels of these cytokines in HD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection or not are
comparable in significantly lower than those in non HD patients with SARS-CoV-2
infection. (Figure 5) These results show that the immune system of HD patients is
compromised, which may be worsened furthermore upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, and
unable trigger effective immune response and cytokine release.

Discussion
In the first two decades of this century, three members of the coronavirus family,
SARS-CoV, MERS- CoV and SARS- CoV-2, have caused three major pandemic
outbreaks of respiratory infectious diseases. At present, it is believed that SARSCoV-2 is more infectious, but its pathogenicity is weaker than the other two viruses.
Compared with the previous two outbreaks, the epidemic area of COVID-19 caused
by SARS- CoV-2 is wider, the number of infected people is larger, more patients died,
and the global economic loss is greater. As the origin source of the epidemic and the
center of the pandemic, more than 46607 confirmed cases have been reported in
Wuhan city, China, 8329 of which are in severe condition and 1987 have died as of
February 23[14]. Previous epidemiological survey showed that the elderly or patients
with comorbidities were more susceptible to COVID-19, and the incidence of severe
cases and the risk of death were high [13, 15-17]. However, there is no report about

the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on HD patients. HD patients are distinct different
cluster from other population because: 1. They compose a large scale cluster. For
instance, there are more than 7000 HD patients in Wuhan city; 2. They are scattered in
different centers across the city; 3. They are highly mobile. Patients should regularly
return to their residences and hospitals; 4. They usually receive concentrated dialysis
treatment in a large space; 5. Their immune function are impaired; 6. When they are
infected, they become a potential source of mobile infection. Considering these
natures, HD patients and HD centers need to be given priority in epidemic prevention
and control. According to our investigation on single center, the infection rate of HD
patients in the COVID-19 epidemic is indeed much higher than that of other
population, and the staffs in HD center are also susceptible to infection.
Reviewing the epidemic situation in our center can bring some important
experiences and lessons. On January 14, 2020, the center found the first HD patient
infected with COVID-19. This patient had fever symptoms at that time, and the chest
CT showed typical viral pneumonia with ground glass like changes. The staff of the
center isolated and distributed the patient with vigilance. On January 17, a second
case of infection was found, and isolation and distribution measures were also taken.
Until January 21, Hubei provincial government launched the secondary emergency
response to public health emergencies, and the center immediately upgraded the level
of prevention and protection. However, staff and patients were still infected on
February 4. In that situation, the center began to carry out general screening of
patients and staff, and the screening item was chest CT. The reason why the nucleic
acid of pharyngeal swab virus was not adopted was that, on the one hand, the
detection resources were limited, and on the other hand, the reported positive rate of
nucleic acid detection was not high. Because HD patients come to the center for
dialysis treatment at intervals, and during the epidemic period, many patients are
worried about being infected, reducing the number of dialysis times and prolonging
the dialysis interval, resulting in the screening work of more than 230 patients being
completed until February 13. However, the confirmed infected case during the
screening were all isolated and distributed. As can be seen from the figure 1, the vast

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027201; this version posted February 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this

majority of patients with COVID-19 infection were found at this stage, since then, no
new cases of infection occurred in the center. Recapitulate of the COVID-19 epidemic
in our center imply that, although SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious, it can still get
control through strict and standardized protective measures, as well as timely patient
screening based on chest CT result, and followed patient distribution and isolation.
During the outbreak of COVID-19 in our center, 7 episode of death were
recorded, with a mortality of 3%, which is far higher than that of the same period in
history. The high mortality is obviously related to the epidemic situation. However, it
was found that no one patient died of pneumonia directly after tracing the causes of
death of 7 patients. The main causes of death were cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
complications or hyperkalemia, which was presumed due to the reduction of dialysis
times for fear of contracting the virus. It should be noted that although HD patients
are highly susceptible to COVID-19, the infection for them is likely less severe or
fatal. Actually, none of the 37 infected patients in our center has been admitted to ICU
due to severe pneumonia. Some infected patients even have no obvious clinical
symptoms. These suggest that in the face of the COVID-19 epidemic emerging,
measures of prevention and protection certainly should be taken to avoid infection,
but the sufficient dialysis remains the key issue for patients to survive the epidemic.
During the outbreak of SARS in 2003, it was observed that the severity and mortality
of HD patients infected with SARS-CoV were similar to other infected population,
but the duration of shedding virus through stool or breath was significantly longer
than other patients[18]. Considering the high biological similarity between
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, we estimate that HD patients infected with
SARS-CoV-2 will take longer to clear the virus, and these patients may need longer
isolation to prevent the spread of infection.
An intriguing phenomenon we observed in this study is that SARS-CoV-2 virus
seems to be less detrimental to HD patients. Previous studies have shown that
SARS-CoV-2 infection can reduce the number of lymphocytes in general patients, but
the level of inflammatory cytokines in vivo increases significantly. Cytokine storm
may be the key cause of the worsened condition and even death of patients [13]. We

therefore tested the frequency of immune cells in the PBMCs of patients with and
without SARS-CoV-2 infection and the level of cytokines in the body of patients. The
results showed that compared with the general population, the T cells, Th cells, killer
T cells, as well as NK cells was reduced remarkably in PBMCs of HD patients,
irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the serum level of serial cytokines
of IL-4, IL-6, TNF-α in SARS-CoV-2 infected HD patients remain relatively lower in
comparison with non-HD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This indicates that the
impaired immune system seems to be unable to mount effective cellular immune
response upon the invasion of SARS-CoV-2, thus results in no cytokine storm and no
severe organs damage. In the current clinical guidelines and practice for COVID-19
therapy, glucocorticoids are regularly recommended and usually prescribed, for the
purpose of inhibiting the overactive immune response and reducing the cytokine
storm [6, 11]. However, with regard to the management of COVID-19 in HD patients,
we suggest the administration of glucocorticoids should be prudent since the immune
system in HD patients have already been suppressed [19-21].

Figure 1．The schematic diagram of dynamic course about COVID-19 epidemic in our HD center.
The first COVID-19 patient was diagnosed on January 14. The second patient was diagnosed on
January 17. The personal prevention and protection of medical staff was upgraded on January 21.
2 new patients and 1 medical staff were confirmed with COVID-19 on February 4. 29 HD patients
and 2 medical staff were diagnosed on February 10. 4 new HD patients were diagnosed with
COVID-19 on February 13.

Figure 2．The management flow and the outcomes of the cluster in the epidemic. 37 patients and 4
medical staff were diagnosed with COVID-19 in our center. 6 patients confirmed with COVID-19
had died and the other 31 patients were distributed to the designated hospital for treatment. The
presumed cause of death was heart failure, hyperkalemia and cerebrovascular disease.

Figure 3．Representative images of chest CT scans (the transverse plane). Patients with COVID-19
had unilateral or bilateral pneumonia. The multiple “ground-glass ” lesions were the
characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia. The green arrows represent the sites of lesions.
Figure 4. The frequncy of immunocytes in the PBMCs of patients with or without COVID-19.The
proportion of T cell, Th cells, killer T cells and B cells of HD patients decreased significantly than
other groups. Meanwhile, the proportion of these cells in patients with COVID-19 was decreased
than healthy volunteers group.
Figure 5. The serum level of cytokines of patients. The values of IL4, IL6 and TNFα in non-HD
COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than those in HD patients with COVID-19.
