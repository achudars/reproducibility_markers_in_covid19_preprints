Abstract

28

Background: As the increasing number of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)

29

patients caused by the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which

30

caused an outbreak initiated from Wuhan, China in December, 2019, the clinical

31

features and treatment of COVID-19 patients have been understood. However, it is

32

urgent to need the rapid and accurate detection for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis.

33

We aimed to evaluate the antibodies-based and nucleic acid-based tests (NAT) for

34

SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.

35

Method: We retrospectively and observationally studied 133 patients diagnosed with

36

SARS-CoV-2 and admitted in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, China, from

37

Feb 17 to Mar 1, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, clinical examination,

38

laboratory tests, and clinical outcomes were collected. Data were compared between

39

IgM-IgG antibody test and real-time RT-PCR detection for COVID-19 patients.

40

Results: Of 133 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, there were 44 moderate cases,

41

52 severe cases, and 37 critical cases with no significant difference of gender and age

42

among three subgroups. Overall, the positive ratio in IgM antibody test was higher

43

than in RT-PCR detection. In RT-PCR detection, the positive ratio was 65.91%,

44

71.15%, and 67.57% in moderate, severe, and critical cases, respectively. Whereas,

45

the positive ratio of IgM/IgG antibody detection in patients was 79.55%/93.18%,

46

82.69%/100%, and 72.97%/97.30% in moderate, severe, and critical cases,

47

respectively. Moreover, the concentrations of antibodies were also measured in three

48

subgroups.

49

Conclusion: The IgM-IgG antibodies-based test exhibited a comparative superiority

50

to the NAT for COVID-19 diagnosis, which provides an effective complement to the

51

false negative results from NAT for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis.

Introduction

55

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread all over the globe and caused

56

coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in infected persons after its initial emergence in

57

Wuhan, China, in December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 has infected 76,819 people out of

58

which 12,077 were critical, 2251 died (2.9% fatality rate) and 18,878 clinically

59

recovered during the first 50 days of the outbreak (1, 2). To mitigate the risk of spread

60

it is necessary to investigate and develop effective treatment and diagnostic options.

61

The signs and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are not specific, most are

62

associated with respiratory complications such as cough dyspnea, and viral

63

pneumonia, but the mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is

64

also considerable (3, 4). Therefore, specific COVID-19 diagnostic tests are required to

65

confirm suspected cases. Besides diagnostic techniques, appropriate samples or

66

specimens for the detection of the viral genome are also of high concern (5, 6).

67

Previous studies on COVID-19 pneumonia have largely focused on clinical

68

characteristics and epidemiology (7, 8). However, very limited details are available

69

related to effective diagnostic strategies. In the current situation, the specificity and

70

sensitivity of the tests are not widely known, therefore, testing of multiple specimen

71

types is recommended (9, 10). The most widely used tests in the current situation are

72

based on nucleic acid detection and antibodies detection. Although the viral nucleic

73

acid RT-PCR test has become the standard method for SARS-CoV-2 infection

74

diagnosis, high false negative rates were reported (11). Upon coronavirus infection,

75

IgM antibodies are produced as an early immune response after infection in the body,

76

which may indicate current infection or new infection. IgG antibodies are the main

77

antibodies produced as an immune response, indicating that the disease has entered a

78

recovery period or that there is a prior infection (12, 13). Therefore, combined tests of

79

immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies can not only

80

provide early diagnosis of infectious diseases but also help to evaluate the stage of

81

infection in the body (11).

82

To further facilitate the efforts of clinical staff in testing, we compared the

83

sensitivity and effectiveness of the currently available tests. We reported that serum

84

antibodies-based testing was more sensitive and efficient to be used as a diagnostic

85

option as compared to reverse transcriptase PCR, which exhibited comparatively

86

superior to the nucleic acid-based test for patients in different stages of SARS-CoV-2

87

infection. Our findings suggested that IgM-IgG antibody test provides an effective

88

complement to the false negative results from nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2

89

infection diagnosis.

Patients

93

A total number of 133 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 in Renmin Hospital

94

(Wuhan University, China) from Feb 17 to Mar 1, 2020, were included as the case

95

group. All patients were diagnosed according to the "pneumonia diagnosis protocol

96

for novel coronavirus infection (trial version 5)", subjected to the tests including

97

clinical examination, Computed Tomography (CT) and real-time reverse-transcription

98

polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 group was

99

divided into three additional subgroups according to new pneumonia diagnosis and

100

treatment of COVID-19 (trial version fifth). The information of three subgroups was

101

divided as 44 moderate cases (22 males and 22 females, median age was 67.5

102

[64~71.75]), 52 severe cases (28 males and 24 females, median age was 68

103

[61.25~74]), and 37 critical cases (20 males and 17 females, median age was 70

Data collection

107

Data on biochemical parameters were obtained from all 133 confirmed SARS-CoV-2

108

infection patients, which was confirmed by a broad series of investigations including

109

clinical examination, laboratory tests, chest x-rays and two independent real-time

110

reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2, with

111

SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab/N qPCR detection kit (GeneoDx Biotech, Shanghai, China), as

112

well as using a SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection kit (YHLO Biotech, Shenzhen,

113

China). Clinical and laboratory information was collected during routine clinical work,

114

and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee and Institutional Review Board

115

of the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (certificate no. WDRY2020-K066).

Statistical analysis

118

SPSS software version 25.0 was used for statistical analysis. All quantitative data in

119

non-normal or unknown distribution were expressed as median and interquartile range.

120

Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to analyze differences among groups for the

121

measurement data that did not meet the normal distribution. The Chi-square (χ2) test

122

was used for the difference between groups of enumeration data. In all tests, P<0.05

123

was defined as statistically significant

in RT-PCR detection for SARS-CoV-2 infection, respectively, suggesting a higher

130

detection sensibility in IgM antibody test than in RT-PCR test (Table 1). However,

131

there were still false positive and false negative results in two tests. Overall, the

132

sensitivity was higher in case of antibody-based test, while lower sensitivity in case of

133

RT-PCR.

The value of RT-PCR detection for viral RNA in COVID-19 patients in different

stages

137

Considering the severity of COVID-19 patients from the critical care resources in

138

hospitals (3), for further analysis in details, the COVID-19 patients was divided into

139

three additional subgroups as 44 moderate cases (22 males and 22 females, median

140

age was 67.5 [64~71.75]), 52 severe cases (28 males and 24 females, median age was

141

68 [61.25~74]), and 37 critical cases (20 males and 17 females, median age was 70

142

[60~76.5]) with no significant difference of sex and age among three subgroups

143

(P>0.05).

144

Then, we desired to figure out the RT-PCR detection for viral RNA in three

145

subgroups of COVID-19 patients. In RT-PCR detection for viral RNA in patients

146

infected with SARS-CoV-2, the positive ratio was 65.91% in moderate cases, 71.15%

147

in severe cases and 67.57% in critical cases, respectively (Table 2). Of note, we didn’t

148

observe significant differences in positive ratio among three subgroups of COVID-19

149

patients.

patients, moderate, severe and critical cases. In IgM antibody detection in patients

155

infected with SARS-CoV-2, the positive ratio was 79.55% in moderate cases, 82.69%

156

in severe cases and 72.97% in critical cases, respectively. Similarly, the positive ratio

157

from IgG antibody test was 93.18% in moderate cases, 100.00% in severe cases and

158

97.30% in critical cases, respectively (Table 3). We observed the positive ratio was

159

still higher in case of antibody-based test, while lower in case of RT-PCR for the

160

diagnosis of three subgroups of patients.

164

Finally, the concentrations of IgM and IgG antibodies in serological test for

165

COVID-19 patients in different stages were measured. The concentration of IgM in

166

patients was 29.19 AU/ml [17.04~61.02] in moderate cases, 40.76 AU/ml

167

[13.56~90.13] in severe cases and 23.25 AU/ml [8.67~104.5] in critical cases,

168

respectively. Meanwhile, the concentration of IgG in patients was 147.73 AU/ml

169

[89.53~171.6] in moderate cases, 148.63 AU/ml [130.95~167.7] in severe cases and

170

140.4 AU/ml [93.79~162.8] in critical cases, respectively (Table 4). Collectively,

171

there were no significant differences in antibodies concentrations among three

172

subgroups of COVID-19 patients, but the test results still revealed as a considerable

173

diagnosis for COVID-19 progression.

Discussion

176

The outbreak of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 spreads rapidly, posing a serious

177

threat to the lives and health of the people. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the coronavirus

178

beta genus, with a linear single-stranded positive-chain RNA, the seventh coronavirus

known to infect humans after SARS (2002) and MERS (2012) (14). There are various

180

assays developed to detect different regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome using

181

RT-PCR (9, 15). In the present study, we applied both antibody and nucleic acid based

182

diagnostic strategies on suspected patients with moderate to critical symptoms for

183

COVID-19. Total 133 patients were tested, where 68.42% (91/133) were positive in

184

case of RT-PCR and 78.95% (105/133) in case of antibody test. It was observed that

185

antibody testing was rapid and had significantly higher efficiency and sensitivity.

186

Recently, chest CT scans were applied for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2

187

induced COVID-19 (10, 16). The chest X-ray or chest CT provides more information,

188

but these are not conclusive as not all the patients with COVID-19 develop

189

pneumonia, and many other things can cause pneumonia (17, 18). Therefore, a more

190

effective strategy such that testing antibodies or RNA is important. The conventional

191

serologic assays and CRISPR-nCoV based detection is also a novel approach for the

192

detection of SARS-CoV-2 (11, 19, 20). As SARS-CoV-2 is a new infectious disease

193

and the immunological testing reagents have recently been developed (11). Although

194

the antibodies generated after a period of the onset of infection, their detections were

195

found more promising in the current situation.

196

The IgM and IgG testing in combination are of great value for improving the

197

clinical sensitivity of early COVID-19 diagnosis. Certainly, it was been confirmed

198

that the detection sensibility was higher in IgG-IgM combined antibody test than in

199

individual IgG or IgM antibody test (11). In general, the coronavirus stimulates the

200

immune response and IgM antibodies are produced firstly and then quickly decline

201

until disappear, while on the other hand, IgG antibodies are usually produced after

202

IgM and continue to rise and remain high in the body for long periods of time (12, 13).

203

For treatment monitoring and status of the disease, the decrease or even disappearance

204

of the concentration of IgM and the increase in the concentration of IgG indicates the

205

severity of the patient and the immunity to the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.

206

Therefore, further investigations should be made on a broad range and mainly focus

207

on the antibody’s response pattern and severity status of the patient on the bases of

208

antibodies production.

209

In conclusion, the higher sensitivity for IgM/IgG antibody-based testing may be

210

associated with its concentration level. The higher level of confirmation of infection

211

in severe cases, the higher sensitivity, and lesser false negative results indicate that

212

diagnostic testing based on IgG has the potential to be accepted widely. Considering

213

the significance of this ongoing COVID-19 epidemic and risk of pandemics, we

214

believe that our findings are important in terms of providing the promising diagnostic

215

options based on age and sex groups, as well as the severity of symptoms. We further

216

recommend IgM-IgG antibody test provides an effective complement to the false

217

negative results from nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis.
