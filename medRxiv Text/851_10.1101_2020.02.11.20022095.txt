Primary Care Practitioners' Response to 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak in
China
The emerging outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originated from
Wuhan poses a great challenge to healthcare system in China.1 Primary care
practitioners (PCPs) have an important role in district communicable disease control.2
However, because primary health-care system in China still needs to be substantially
strengthened,3,4 whether PCPs are proactive and capable in responding to the
outbreak remains unclear. Using an electronic questionnaire, we surveyed a national
sample of PCPs to assess their response to novel coronavirus outbreak.

Methods From Jan 28, 2020 to Feb 3, 2020, we invited a national random sample
of PCPs in China to participate in an online survey through social media. The
questionnaire was adapted from The Notice of Improving Prevention of 2019-nCoV
causing Pneumonia in Primary Care Settings issued by China’s National Health
Commission on Jan 27, 2020.5 It included 6 questions of demographic information,
duration and scope of clinical practice as well as types of practice settings, and 8
statements regarding whether the PCPs were making efforts to respond to novel
coronavirus outbreak in daily practice.
Eligible PCPs participated in this survey voluntarily and were not compensated.
Once completed and returned, the survey was regarded as informed consent by
participants. This study was deemed exempt from review by the Sir Run Run Shaw

Hospital Ethics Committee.
One of the authors (Z. X.) reviewed the returned questionnaires and excluded
the unqualified data. All statistical analyses were performed with Stata version 15.0
and a two-sided P﹤.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results Among 1751 respondents (response rate: 62%), 784 (45%) were men and
1135 (65%) were family physicians. The mean (SD) age of respondents was 38(8)
years, and the duration of practice was 15 (9) years (Table 1). Most of PCPs were
proactive in studying knowledge and skills of containing 2019-nCoV (99%, n=1741),
teaching their consulting patients ways of prevention (94%, n=1650), and comforting
the worried patients (86%, n=1509). The study also showed that 69% (n=1221) of
PCPs used online consultation for health education. However, less than half (48%,
n=849) reported to transfer the suspected infected patients to hospitals for further
diagnosis and treatment. The rates of visiting, transferring and monitoring the
suspected cases varied among PCPs in different practice settings, geographic regions,
and specialties, respectively (Table 2).

Discussion We found that most of China’s PCPs attached great importance to the
national epidemic outbreak and had some preparation of knowledge and skills for
the emerging situation. They took multiple control measures instructed by health
authorities, and the majority spontaneously provide online consultation to local
community, which effectively increased the coverage of health services during a

pandemic period and strengthened the relationship between PCPs and the public.
Nevertheless, the capacity of transferring suspected cases remained relatively
inadequate. Hence, China’s hierarchical medical system for managing communicable
disease remains to be improved.
The result that PCPs’ responses varied among practitioners, regions and settings
may be attributed to the uneven distribution of healthcare providers and resources
across the country. It indicates that policies for containing the coronavirus outbreak
in primary care should consider different challenges PCPs encounter and adjust
measures to individual conditions.
Our study includes several limitations. First, there is a diversity of control
measures among districts and PCPs’ response may be affected by local authorities.
Second, PCPs other than clinicians are not included in our study because they are not
responsible for screening and transfer.
Policy-makers should take steps to improve PCPs’ capacity and consciousness to
ready for rapid response, and strengthen collaboration between PCPs and specialists
in hospitals.
