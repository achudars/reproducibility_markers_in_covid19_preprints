Abstract
Background
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
emerges in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, spreads worldwide, and threats the
human life. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 is important for the prevention of the
outbreak and management of patients. Real-time reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay detected the virus in clinical
laboratory.
Methods
This study utilized primers and single-quencher probes in accordance
with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA and the
National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan. Moreover, we designed
the double-quencher probes (YCH assay) according to the oligonucleotide
sequence established by NIID. Using these assays, we conducted a one-step
real-time RT-PCR with serial DNA positive control to assess the detection
sensitivity.
Results
The threshold cycle (Ct) value of RT-PCR was relatively low in CDC and
YCH assays compared to NIID assay. Serial dilution assay showed that both CDC
and YCH assays could detect a low-copy number of DNA positive control. The
background fluorescent signal at the baseline was lower in YCH than that of NIID.
Conclusion
Double-quencher probes decreased background fluorescent signal and
improved detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
In early December 2019, the first pneumonia cases of unknown origin
were identified in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province [1]. The novel
human-infecting coronavirus was tentatively named 2019 novel coronavirus
(2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO) and, currently, renamed
as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. As of March 9, 2020, more
than 109,577 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had been
confirmed, of which 80,904 cases are in China and 28,673 cases outside of
China, with 3,809 deaths globally (WHO Situation Report–49). Human-tohuman transmission of the virus accounts for the spread of the virus around the
world [2-7]. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for
SARS-CoV-2 and one of the potential therapeutic targets [8, 9].
SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus
Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) which had previously been found in
bats in China [10]. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that bats are possibly the
original hosts of this virus [11]. SARS-CoV-2 has a single-strand, positive-sense
RNA genome with 29,903 base pairs in length (NCBI Reference Sequence:
NC_045512.2) [12]. A viral genome sequence was released for immediate
public health support via the community online resource (virological.org),
followed by 169 genome-sequencing data that were deposited in the database
curated by the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) [13].
These data showed how SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks occurred worldwide in genetic
variations.
Human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has become a global health
concern. The molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 is highly prioritized to establish
the prevention of the viral outbreak and treatment of infected patients. Therefore,
demands in detecting the virus in suspected patients in hospitals and clinical
laboratories are growing. The Japanese government announced the approval of
real-time PCR analysis to detect SARS-CoV-2 for health insurance on March 6,
2020. Here, we compared the detection sensitivity among the primer/probe sets
designed by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States of
America. These probes were designed as single-quencher probes. We originally
designed the double-quencher probes consisting of the same nucleotide

sequencing imposed by the NIID. The results showed that double-quenching
probes reduced the background signal and improved the detection sensitivity of
SARS-CoV-2.

Materials and Methods
Primer and probe sets
The CDC has designed real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) assays and published a protocol for the detection of the 2019nCoV
(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-panel-primerprobes.html). We purchased the 2019-nCoV CDC qPCR Probe Assays (renamed
as 2019-nCoV RUO Kit) from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA,
USA), which contained research-use-only primer and probe sets based on the
protocol announced from CDC (hereafter called CDC assay). The CDC assay
includes three sets of primers and 5’ FAM dye and 3’ Black Hole Quencher®
(BHQ) probes (Table 1).
The NIID has designed RT-PCR assays and published the data [14]. The
primer and probe sets were sent from the NIID (hereafter called NIID assay). The
CDC assay includes three sets of primers and 5’ FAM dye and 3’ TAMRA probes
as shown in Table 1.
We also originally designed double-quencher probes (IDT) containing the
same sequence in accordance with the NIID protocol (hereafter called YCH
assay). This probe has 5’ FAM dye, internal ZEN Quencher, and 3’ Iowa Black®
Fluorescent Quencher (IBFQ) (Table 1). Internal ZEN Quencher is incorporated
between the ninth and tenth bases from the 5’ end of probe. This design
decreased the distance between the dye and quencher and expected to reduce
the background signal and achieve a higher dynamic signal. All primer/probe sets
of CDC, NIID, and YCH assays amplified the nucleocapsid (N) gene of SARSCoV-2 (Figure 1). CDC assay targets three sites of N gene, while both NIID and
YCH target the two sites (Figure 1).
DNA positive control
For the DNA positive control, we purchased 2019-nCoV_N_Positive
Control (IDT, catalog #10006625), which is composed of plasmids containing the
complete N gene (1,260 base pairs) of SARS-CoV-2. We prepared a serial
dilution DNA control using nuclease-free water (Thermo Fisher Scientific

Waltham, MA, USA) to evaluate the detection sensitivity of CDC, NIID, and YCH
assays. We also purchased Hs_RPP30 Positive Control (IDT, catalog
#10006626), which contains a portion of the ribonuclease P 30 subunit (RPP30)
gene of the human genome. RPP30 genes were analyzed for internal positive
control.
One-step real-time RT-PCR
To detect SARS-CoV-2, we performed RT-PCR with the use of probes
and primers. In CDC and YCH assays, the reaction mixture was made up of 5 μL
of 4× TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1.5 μL of
probe/primer mixtures (IDT), 11.5 μL of nuclease-free water (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), and 2 μL of serial-diluted DNA control (2019-nCoV_N_Positive
Control) in a 20 μL total volume. We also performed one-step real-time PCR using
the NIID assays according to the protocol (version 2.7) established by the NIID.
Briefly, in the N1 of the NIID assay, the reaction mixture comprised of 5 μL of 4×
TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix, 1.2 μL of forward primer, 1.6 μL of reverse
primer, 0.8 μL of probe, 9.4 μL of nuclease-free water (Thermo Fisher Scientific),
and 2 μL of serial-diluted DNA control in a 20 μL total volume. In the N2 of the
NIID assay, the reaction mixture consisted of 5 μL of 4× TaqMan Fast Virus 1Step Master Mix, 1.0 μL of forward primer, 1.4 μL of reverse primer, 0.8 μL of
probe, 9.8 μL of nuclease-free water (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 2 μL of serialdiluted DNA control in a 20 μL total volume. RT-PCR was conducted under a
ViiA7 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the following cycling
conditions: 50°C for 5 min for reverse transcription, 95°C for 20 s, and 45 cycles
of 95°C for 3 s and 60°C for 30 s. Data were analyzed using the ViiA7 software
v2.2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The threshold line was set at 0.2. The threshold
cycle (Ct) value assigned to each PCR reaction and amplification curve was
visually assessed.

Results
Design of primer and probes to detect SARS-CoV-2
SARS-CoV-2 has a single-strand, positive-sense RNA genome with

assays target two sites (N1 and N2) (Figure 1). Previous study showed the
mismatch of reverse primer in the N1 of the NIID assay with the sequence in the
current database because it was constructed based on another reported
sequence (GenBank: MN908947.1) [14]. In addition, this mismatch in the reverse
primers had no influence on the detection sensitivity compared to the perfectmatched reverse primer stated in the previous report [14]. CDC and NIID assays
contain single-quencher probes in each assay; however, we originally generated
the double-quencher technology in YCH assays to reduce background signal.
Expected amplicon sizes of CDC assays are 72 bp, 67 bp, and 72 bp in length
by the N1, N2, and N3, respectively. Expected amplicon sizes of NIID and YCH
assays are 128 bp and 158 bp in length by N1 and N2, respectively.
Serial dilution analysis determined detection sensitivity
To assess the detection sensitivity of each assay, we conducted RT-PCR
analysis using a serial-diluted DNA control. We input the DNA positive control at
concentrations of 10,000 copies, 1,000 copies, 100 copies, 10 copies, and 1 copy.
We set the threshold value to 0.2 in all assays to determine the threshold cycle
(Ct). Fluorescence amplification signals were detected using 10,000 copies, 1000
copies, and 100 copies of DNA positive control by all CDC, NIID, and YCH assays
(Figure 2). With the use of 10 copies of DNA positive control, amplification signals
by CDC-N2, YCH-N1, YCH-N2, and NIID-N2 were detected (Figure 2). All of
these assays could not detect using 1 copy of DNA positive control (Figure 2).
Overall, the Ct value is found to be lower in the YCH assay using the serial-diluted
DNA positive control.
Double-quencher probes reduce background signal
As observed, the Ct values in both the N1 and N2 sites of the NIID assay
were relatively higher compared to those of the YCH assay (Figure 2), although
the primer and probe sequence was the same between NIID and YCH assays.
We concluded that the double-quencher probe (ZEN/IBFQ) reduced the
background signal and lowered the Ct value compared to the single-quencher
probe (TAMRA). To this end, we analyzed the fluorescent signals during the
cycles of RT-PCR at three independent experiments. As expected, the doublequencher probes decreased the background FAM fluorescent signals at the
baseline (Figure 3). The baseline fluorescent signal of the N1 site of NIID ranged
from 150×104 to 200×104. However that of YCH was around or less than 50×104

(Figure 3). Similarly, the signal in the N2 site of NIID was around 125×104 to
200×104, and that of YCH was 75×104 to 100×104. Results suggested that
double-quencher probes improved the detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 using
one-step real-time RT-PCR owing to the reduction of background signal.

Discussion
SARS-CoV-2 is the primary cause of an ongoing international outbreak
of a respiratory illness known as COVID-19. The detection of this virus is
important in order to prevent outbreak and manage patient care. In this study, we
performed RT-PCR using different types of primer and probes. As a result,
double-quencher probes decreased background signals compared to singlequencher probes. Owning to less background signals, the dynamic changes of a
single fluorescence is high and demonstrate a lower Ct value. Results showed
the relevance of a double-quencher probe in increasing the sensitivity in the
detection of SARS-CoV-2.
Several companies developed a commercially available kit for the RTPCR. To the best of our knowledge, the IDT launched assays targeting the three
sites of N gene and human RPP30, as used in this study. Thermo Fisher Scientific
provided the assay targeting Orf1ab, spike (S) gene, N gene, and human RNase
P; Roche Diagnostics provided an assay targeting RdRP (in Orf1ab), E gene, and
N gene. Jung et al. recently compared several types of primer and probe sets
reported in China, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand, and the USA [15].
They showed that ORF1ab is best according to China. In the N gene, CDC-N2
(USA), CDC-N3 (USA), and NIID-N2 (Japan) sets should be selected for sensitive
and reliable laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. We have also observed that
the CDC-N2 (USA) and NIID-N2 (Japan) assay could detect low number of DNA
positive control.
We confirmed that the N1 site of NIID assay was not detected when using
less than 10 copies of DNA positive control. In addition, as observed, Ct value
was also high by the N1 site of the NIID assay. Similar to these observations,
Shirato et al. also demonstrated less sensitivity of the N1 site of NIID assay using
RNA positive control. The assessment of N1 site was originally reported by the
groups in Germany. To improve the detection sensitivity, we recommended the
use of a double-quencher probe for detection of SARS-CoV-2, especially in the
N1 site.

The background fluorescent signal was mainly determined by two factors.
First, high background fluorescence is due to longer probe sequence in length.
This means the shorter the distance between the fluorescence dye and the
quencher, the better the quenching performance due to the fluorescence
resonance energy transfer. Second, the background signal is prone to be low if
the probe forms three-dimensional structure owing to self-quenching. To detect
the low number of virus in human sample, the reduction of background signal is
important. To this end, we utilized a double-quencher system for detecting SARSCoV-2 by a one-step real-time RT-PCR. As expected, a double-quencher probe
decreased the background signal at the baseline which led to a higher dynamic
range. Our data suggested that double-quencher probe enables us to detect low
number of SARS-CoV-2 in routine clinical practice.
