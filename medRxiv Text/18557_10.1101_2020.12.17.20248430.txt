Abstract
Background: Protecting health care workers (HCWs) during the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic is essential. Serologic testing can identify HCWs who had minimally
symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections that were
missed by occupational screening based on daily symptom and temperature checks. Recent studies
report conflicting results regarding the impact of occupational factors on SARS-CoV-2
seropositivity amongst HCWs.
Methods: The study population included all hospital workers at an academic medical center in
Orange County, California. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was assessed from a fingerstick blood
specimen using a coronavirus antigen microarray, which compares IgM and IgG antibodies against
a panel of SARS-CoV-2 antigens with positive and negative controls to identify prior SARS-CoV2 infection with 98% specificity and 93% sensitivity. Demographic, occupational, and clinical
factors were surveyed and their effect on seropositivity estimated using multivariable logistic
regression analysis.
Results: Amongst 1,557 HCWs with complete data, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was 10.8%. Risk
factors for increased seropositivity included male gender, exposure to COVID-19 outside of work,
working in food or environmental services, and working in COVID-19 units. Amongst the 1,103
HCW who were seropositive but missed by occupational screening, additional risk factors included
younger age and working in administration.
Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity is significantly higher than reported case counts even
amongst HCWs who are meticulously screened. Seropositive HCWs missed by occupational
screening were more likely to be younger, work roles without direct patient care, or have COVID19 exposure outside of work.

Background
Protecting health care workers (HCWs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic is essential to mounting an effective response, as outbreaks among this population could
potentially cripple health care delivery. Current case identification relies on symptom and
temperature screening with follow-up testing by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
(SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR). This approach
underestimates disease prevalence due to the high proportion of asymptomatic infections and the
impaired sensitivity of rt-PCR due to suboptimal timing, flawed specimen collection, overamplification, or low viral load[1, 2]. Given the importance of asymptomatic persons in the
dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, identification of risk factors that may augment identification of
asymptomatic infection in HCWs is crucial to protecting patients and the health care system[1].
Serologic testing can help to determine the true cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 by
identifying previously infected persons who had minimal symptoms so were missed by the current
testing paradigm[3, 4]. Multiple COVID-19 seroprevalence studies have been performed in
different populations but are limited by low specificity in low-prevalence populations or potential
selection bias from the use of convenience sampling[5-10]. Estimated seroprevalence among
HCW varies widely, with some studies finding similar or even lower prevalence compared to the
surrounding community[7, 11-14].
Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HCW were initially extrapolated from
studies of hospitalized patients with severe disease that may not be generalizable to the population
at large[15]. Early studies to identify risk factors amongst HCWs were performed in early outbreak
setting prior to current infection control practices so may not be currently applicable[16, 17]. More
recent studies have conflicting results as to whether occupational exposures confer an increased
risk of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and are limited by heterogeneity and suboptimal performance
of the assays and inadequate control for confounding[18, 19].
This study measured SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity amongst 1,557 HCWs at the University
of California-Irvine Health, a 418-bed academic medical center in Orange County, California,
from May 15th to June 30th 2020, using a novel coronavirus antigen microarray (CoVAM). This
CoVAM utilizes 11 SARS-CoV-2 antigens to determine prior infection with 98% specificity and
93% sensitivity based on validation in 91 rt-PCR-positive cases and 88 pre-pandemic negative
controls[20]. This performance and level of validation compares favorably to other serologic
assays based on a single antigen[21-23]. A digital survey collected data on potential demographic,
occupational, and clinical risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. A multivariable analysis tested
the null hypothesis that demographic, clinical, and occupational risk factors do not affect SARSCoV-2 seropositivity among HCWs.
Methods
Study Design, Setting, and Population
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of CaliforniaIrvine under Protocol HS 2020-5818. All employees who worked in the hospital were eligible.
Universal daily symptom and temperature screening was initiated on April 14, 2020, with
subsequent immediate rt-PCR testing for any HCW with symptoms or fever or disclosure of a
confirmed or suspected COVID-19 contact. A primary study site in the main hospital building was
open from May 15 to May 29, 2020 to all employees who provided electronic consent (open

enrollment cohort). In addition, all employees who had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 by rt-PCR
due to symptoms or possible exposure, or who provided direct patient care in COVID-19 clinical
units or similar control units, were invited via email and provided electronic consent to participate
at a secondary study open from May 15 to June 30, 2020 (targeted enrollment cohort). This second
cohort was included to enrich the study for HCW with COVID-19 infection, symptoms, or
exposure.
Study Procedures
Participants were given a unique study identifier and a mobile phone link to a Research
Electronic Data Capture (REDCap, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) survey to collect data
on demographic, clinical, and occupational risk factors (Appendix A). At the primary study site,
participants then underwent capillary blood collection via fingerstick using a disposable lancet into
microfuge capillary tubes. After centrifugation at 1500 x g for 10 min, supernatant plasma was
collected, frozen, and transported for laboratory analysis. At the secondary study site, participants
underwent phlebotomy into gold-top tubes (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for centrifugation and
collection of serum, from which an aliquot was frozen and transported for laboratory analysis. All
specimens were labeled with unique identifiers accessible only via a secure key.
Laboratory Assays
The CoVAM includes 67 antigens from respiratory viruses, including 11 antigens from
SARS-CoV-2 (Sino Biological U.S. Inc., Wayne, PA). Antigens were printed onto microarrays in
quadruplicate, probed with serum specimens and secondary antibodies for IgM and IgG, and
imaged to determine background-subtracted median fluorescence intensity[24-26]. Briefly,
CoVAM data for each specimen were compared with 91 rt-PCR-positive cases with blood
collected ≥ 7 d (range, 7-50 d, median 11 d) post-symptom onset and 88 pre-pandemic controls
with blood collected prior to November 1, 2019, which were split randomly into 70% derivation
and 30% validation cohorts. Based on IgM and IgG antibodies against the 11 SARS-CoV-2
antigens on the array, a linear regression model was trained on positive and negative controls in
the derivation cohort to determine optimal weighted combinations of reactive antigens to calculate
composite SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers that discriminate the two groups, with reactivity
thresholds selected to achieve maximum sensitivity while maintaining ≥ 98% specificity. The
model was tested on the validation cohort and achieved 92.7% sensitivity and 97.7% specificity
for detecting prior SARS-CoV-2 infection based on composite IgM or IgG positivity.
Statistical Analysis
SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was calculated as the proportion of HCWs who were classified
as seropositive in the study population and within categories of each demographic, clinical and
occupational risk factor, expressed as the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval compared
to the study population. In order to assess the associations between clinical and occupational risk
factors and seropositivity, multivariable models were constructed to control for potential
confounding due to demographic and health-related factors associated with both occupational
exposure and underlying risk for seropositivity. We forced demographic variables into the model
a priori, which included age, gender, and race/ethnicity, which have well-established associations
with occupation and health outcomes. Health-related covariates included comorbidities (asthma or
COPD, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, self-reported smoking or vaping) and known COVID-19
exposure outside of work, which would likely influence seropositivity. Occupation-related

variables included self-reported role, location, and COVID-19 patient contact. Health- and
occupation-related exposures were selected based on bivariate associations with seropositivity
using a p<0.1 criterion for inclusion. The final model for clinical and occupational risk factors was
adjusted for age (quartiles), gender, race/ethnicity (Asian, White, Latino, Black, and
Mixed/other/not reported), known COVID-19 exposure outside of work, and workplace role,
location, and COVID-19 patient contact. Adjusted analyses were conducted among the entire
sample and replicated among the subgroup of HCWs not tested previously via rt-PCR. Model fit
was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and C-statistic. All analyses were
conducted using R software v4.0.3 (R Consortium for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
Results
Study Population
From an eligible population of 5,349 HCWs, 1,841 (34.4%) consented to participate,
including 1,108 in the open enrollment cohort and 733 in the targeted enrollment cohort. Of the
targeted cohort, 343 had been tested by rt-PCR for COVID-19, 237 worked in a COVID-19 unit
and 153 worked in a matched control unit of similar acuity. A total of 1,557 HCWs completed the
survey and provided blood specimens to be analyzed by CoVAM, including 1,044 in the open
enrollment cohort and 513 in the targeted cohort. Compared to the population of Orange County,
the study population has a higher proportion of females and Asian race/ethnicity.
SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was 10.8% in the overall HCW cohort (Table 1).
Seropositivity was 17.7% amongst the 419 HCWs who had been tested by rt-PCR previously, and
8.0% among the 1,138 HCW who had not. Seropositivity in the targeted versus open enrollment
cohorts matched closely the seropositivity among HCWs tested previously versus not tested by rtPCR respectively, indicating that the difference between the cohorts is largely driven by rt-PCR
testing. Of the 343 HCW tested by rt-PCR, 38 were PCR+ and 322 PCR-, with 36 (94.4%) of the
PCR+ testing seropositive whereas 30 (9.3%) of the PCR- were seropositive, higher than the
seropositivity rate of those not tested by rt-PCR (Supplementary Table 4).
Potential demographic risk factors included age, gender, race/ethnicity, and co-morbid
conditions, as well as confirmed SARS-CoV-2 exposure outside the hospital (Table 1). No
significant effect of age was noted among HCWs overall; however, a non-significant increase in
seropositivity was observed for younger HCWs who were not previously tested by rt-PCR,
indicating that younger HCW with SARS-CoV-2 infection may be less likely to screen positive
for symptoms and be tested by rt-PCR. Male gender was associated with increased seropositivity,
whereas race/ethnicity and co-morbidities were not. Confirmed COVID-19 exposure outside the
hospital was the most significant demographic risk factor for seropositivity, with a higher OR
among HCWs not tested by rt-PCR. These data indicate that either exposures occurred prior to
widespread availability of rt-PCR testing which is unlikely given implementation of universal
employee screening and testing early in the course of the local epidemic, or more likely that HCW
were not always accurately reporting COVID-19 exposures during screening.
Impact of Occupational Risk Factors on SARS-CoV-2 Seropositivity
Among roles within the hospital, only HCWs working in food services or environmental
services showed significantly increased seropositivity as compared to the overall HCW population,
and the effect was restricted to those not tested by rt-PCR. Similarly, working in administration
was associated with increased seropositivity only amongst HCWs not tested by rt-PCR. Among

locations in the hospital, working in COVID-19 units was associated with increased seropositivity,
whereas working in labor and delivery units was associated with decreased seropositivity. COVID19 patient contact and participation in aerosol-generating procedures on these patients were not
associated with seropositivity.
Multivariable analyses included the non-occupational covariates discussed above, in
addition to role and location within the hospital (Table 2). The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-offit test was non-significant (p=0.55) and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve
showed moderate discriminant ability (C-statistic=0.62), indicating that the adjusted model fit the
data well.
Correlation of COVID-19 Symptoms with Seropositivity
A separate multivariable analysis was conducted that included non-occupational covariates
discussed above, in addition to symptoms of COVID-19 (Table 3). Overall, multiple symptoms
(fatigue, myalgias, fever, chills, and anosmia) were associated with increased seropositivity, with
the strongest association observed for anosmia. These associations were entirely restricted to HCW
tested previously by rt-PCR, indicating that occupational health screening was indeed effective in
identifying symptomatic infections.
Discussion
This study provides several insights into the relationships between non-occupational and
occupational risk factors and COVID-19 seropositivity among HCWs (Figure 1). Exposure to
COVID-19 outside of work was a greater risk factor for seropositivity than any occupational
exposure other than working in food or environmental services. The HCW roles associated with
the greatest risk of seropositivity did not involve direct patient care. Nurses, who have the most
direct and sustained patient contact, were not at significantly increased risk. The only locations
associated with increased seropositivity were the dedicated COVID-19 ICU and floor units. The
operating room, an area of great concern due to intubation of multiple patients, was not associated
with increased risk. Performing aerosol-generating procedures on known COVID-19 patients was
also not significantly associated with seropositivity, which is reassuring given that perceived risk
of transmission during these procedures can delay patient care.
Stratification of HCWs based on whether or not they were tested previously by rt-PCR
yielded several additional insights into the strengths and weaknesses of universal symptom
screening. The association between COVID-19 symptoms and seropositivity was restricted to
HCW tested previously by rt-PCR, indicating that universal screening was effective in identifying
symptomatic infections. Younger HCWs who were COVID-19-seropositive were more likely to
be missed by occupational screening, which is consistent with the increased prevalence of
minimally symptomatic infection among younger individuals[27]. Decreased seropositivity
among HCW in labor and delivery units may be due to increased vigilance amongst HCW who
care for pregnant patients or low disease prevalence among these patients. While the hospital’s
mandatory screening was only implemented one month prior to this study, the prevalence of
COVID-19 in Orange County was low at that time and increased subsequently (Figure 2). The
CoVAM was trained and validated on blood specimens collected relatively soon after symptom
onset (minimum 7 d, median 11 d) consistent with known kinetics of the antibody response to
COVID-19 [3]. Therefore, we believe the effects of occupational health screening are at least
partially captured in our analysis. In addition, the study hospital was able to maintain infection

prevention best practices consistent with guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), including continuous, ample availability of PPE throughout the pandemic.
No data were available for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in the surrounding community at
the time that the study was performed. The cumulative COVID-19 prevalence in Orange County
at the time of this study’s enrollment was 0.2%. The overall seropositivity rate was 10.8% in this
study, but the 8.0% seropositivity amongst HCW not previously identified by screening, which
matches the seropositivity in the open enrollment cohort, is most appropriate for comparison to
community prevalence to avoid the enrichment effect of the targeted enrollment cohort. This
seropositivity is 40-fold higher than community prevalence as determined by rt-PCR testing
(Figure 2). Whereas more recent seroprevalence studies show a 10-fold increase compared to case
counts, our result is most comparable to early seroprevalence studies prior to significant local
outbreaks of COVID-19 that have found larger disparities between seropositivity rates and case
counts[5-9, 13]. Recently, a community study sampled 2,979 random participants in Orange
County from July 10 through August 16, 2020 and found a seropositivity rate of 11.5% using an
updated version of the CoVAM with a more stringent threshold for seropositivity[28]. Taken
together, these observations imply that HCW are not more likely to be seropositive than the
surrounding community, although the different study periods limit this direct comparison.
The findings of this study are largely consistent with recently published studies of COVID19 seropositivity among HCWs[18, 19]. In particular, the lack of association of either
race/ethnicity or co-morbidities with seropositivity in our study is consistent with these prior HCW
studies and differs from a prior community study that did observe such associations[29]. This study
provides additional insight compared to prior studies by examining specific roles in the hospital
and controlling for multiple likely sources of confounding. For example, nurses had significantly
elevated seropositivity in bivariate analyses (unadjusted OR [CI]=1.52 [1.10-2.10]) but this finding
did not persist after adjusting for work location; in contrast, null associations between
seropositivity and roles without direct patient care became significant and positive after adjusting
for location (unadjusted OR [CI] for administrative = 1.08 [0.66, 1.69]; food/environmental = 1.54
[0.62-3.29]) .
Strengths of this study include the validated test performance of the CoVAM, which
compares favorably to currently available single-antigen assays; the large sample size with
inclusion of 34.4% of HCW at the hospital; and the use of multivariable analysis to control for
confounding. The weaknesses of this study include the non-random enrollment methodology as
the targeted enrollment cohort was invited from groups expected to have higher seroprevalence
and the open enrollment cohort was subject to self-selection, which both could lead to sampling
bias. Also, different blood sampling methodology was used in the open and targeted enrollment
cohorts due to institutional interest in banking specimens from the latter group. The subgroup
analysis based on prior rt-PCR testing was used to control for the heterogeneous sampling, as prior
testing was the primary driver of increased prevalence in the targeted enrollment cohort. When the
study population is stratified based on method of recruitment (Supplementary Tables 1-3), the
results are largely similar to stratification based on rt-PCR testing (Tables 1-3).
The results of this study have several implications for the local and global responses to the
COVID-19 pandemic. The finding of a significantly increased SARS-CoV-2 prevalence by
serology as compared with rt-PCR provides evidence that the reported counts of confirmed
COVID-19 cases are significant underestimates. The observations that HCWs who are younger,
work in non-patient care roles, or have COVID-19 exposure outside of work are more likely to
have COVID-19 seropositivity without prior testing indicates that screening and vaccination

efforts need to focus on these groups. The lack of association of aerosol-generating procedures
with COVID-19 seropositivity in the context of adequate availability and presumably appropriate
use of PPE is reassuring. The increased seropositivity in COVID-19 units is less reassuring but
may potentially be explained by employee-to-employee spread in these locations given that caring
for COVID-19 patients was not a significant risk factor. Further studies that include longitudinal
follow-up are needed to confirm these observations.

Adjusted ORs and 95% CI are adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, known COVID exposure
at home, role, location, and whether individual cared for COVID patient.
2
Each role is compared to the entire HCW population, e.g., physicians vs. non-physicians.
3
Individuals may select multiple locations, thus categories are not mutually exclusive. Each aOR
corresponds to relative odds of being COVID AB-seropositive for individuals who worked in the
specified location versus those who did not.
4
HCWs may report multiple exposures or symptoms. Each aOR corresponds to relative odds of
being COVID AB-seropositive for individuals who reported versus did not report the specified
exposure or symptom.
5
Days in contact with COVID patient and participated in aerosol-generating procedure only
applicable for HCWs who reported “yes” to caring for COVID patients.

1

Adjusted ORs and 95% CI are adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, known COVID exposure
at home, role, location, and whether individual cared for COVID-19 patient.
2
HCWs may report multiple exposures and/or symptoms. Each adjusted OR corresponds to
relative odds of being COVID AB seropositive for individuals who reported versus did not report
the specified exposure or symptom.

exposure at home, role, location and whether an individual cared for a COVID-19 patient.
2
HCWs may have reported multiple exposures or symptoms. Each adjusted OR corresponds to
relative odds of being COVID-19 AB-seropositive for individuals who reported versus did not
report the specified exposure or symptom.
3
Days in contact with a COVID-19 patient and participated in aerosol-generating procedure only
applicable for HCWs who reported “yes” to caring for COVID-19 patients
