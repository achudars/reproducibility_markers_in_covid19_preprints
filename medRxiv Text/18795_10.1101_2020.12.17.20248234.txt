Abstract

24

Due to airborne transmission of infection with the coronavirus, the question arose as to how

25

high the risk of spreading infectious particles can be while playing a wind instrument.

26

To contribute to this question and to help clarify the possible risks, we analyzed 14 wind

27

instruments, first qualitative by making airflows visible while playing and second quantitative

28

by measuring air velocities at three distances (1m, 1.5m and 2m) in direction of the

29

instrument’s bell.

30

Measurements took place with wind instrumentalists of the Bamberg Symphony in their

31

concert hall.

32

Our findings highlight that while playing all wind instruments no airflow escaping from the

33

instruments – from the bell with brass instruments, from the mouthpiece, keyholes and bell

34

with woodwinds – was measured beyond a distance of 1.5m from the instruments’ bell,

35

regardless of volume, pitch or what was played. With that, air velocity while playing

36

corresponded to the usual value of hall-like rooms, of 0.1 m/s. For air-jet woodwinds, alto

37

flute and piccolo, significant air movements were seen close to their mouthpieces, which

38

escaped directly into the room without passing through the instrument and therefore

39

generating directed air movements.

Introduction

42

The coronavirus pandemic has had and continues to have a grave impact on music making,

43

especially concerning the playing of wind instruments and singing. Airborne transmission

44

plays an important role for the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus [1]. Thus, forms of musical

45

sound generation that involve breathing are suspected of being risky. In this regard, it seems

46

of great importance to learn more about airflow and air velocity produced by playing wind

47

instruments and singing that could contain infectious droplets or aerosols and spread them in

48

indoor situations.

49

Up-to-date research looked into air dispersion, while playing wind instruments or singing,

50

using different forms of measuring.

51

In a recent publication, conducted at the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar [2] the spread of

52

breathing air while playing wind instruments and singing was observed, using the Schlieren

53

imaging with a Schlieren mirror and the Background Oriented Schlieren method (BOS), as a

54

way to make respiratory air visible. Two professional singers (baritone and soprano) and

55

eleven wind instruments (woodwinds: oboe, bassoon, Bb clarinet, bass clarinet, flute, piccolo,

56

alto flute, and brass: Bb trumpet, tenor trombone, French horn, F tuba) of the philharmonic

57

orchestra Thüringen Philharmonic Gotha – Eisenach, were positioned in front of the Schlieren

58

mirror while playing or singing. The findings show that the spreading range as well as the

59

angle at which the air escapes mouth or outlet, varies strongly from instrument and player,

60

depending on the structure of the instrument, the structure of the mouthpiece, the way an

61

instrument is blown and individual blowing or breathing capacities. In general their

62

measurements with wind instruments reached a maximal distance of 1.12m, measured by

63

side-air movements of the piccolo.

64

The authors also discovered that special barrier caps – used with brass instruments – do have

65

a significant impact on the spread of air, which can strongly reduce the dispersion, while

66

hardly interfering with the sound of the instrument. Furthermore, they found out that the

67

escaping air ascends due to natural convection or mixes with the surrounding room air [3].

68

A study by the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München and the University of Erlangen [4],

69

pre-published in July 2020, investigated different forms of speaking and singing with 10

70

professional singers of the Bavarian Radio Choir. They made respiratory flows visible by

71

exhaling smoke of e-cigarettes (not containing nicotine). Tests were conducted in a shaded

72

room, documenting the exhaled aerosol clouds with the help of a high speed camera and laser

73

light. Comparing different settings (singing text, speaking text and singing without text, once

74

with soft and once with loud phonation) they learned that singing text and speaking text

75

reaches comparable mean distances of dispersion at up to 0.85m, while singing without text

76

reached the lowest values of airflow at 0.63m. Even though the mean measurements of air

77

dispersion stay within a reach of 1m, some singers reached airflow distances of up to 1.4m.

78

These measurements were then compared to coughing, which turns out to reach farther

79

distances, with a mean of 1.3m and a maximum of 1.9m. On the base of their study, they

80

announce a suggestion for distance regulations of at least 2m to the front [5].

81

First insights on their second study on wind instruments, using the same test setting are

82

published online [6]. They point out, that respiratory clouds to the front reach farther than to

83

the side, with instrument-specific outcomes. For an alto flute they recommend 3m spaces to

84

the front and 2m to the side, for all other wind instruments they recommend 2m to the front

85

and 1.5m to the side [7].

86

Another study conducted by the University of the German Armed Forces in Munich [8],

87

which was pre-published in May 2020, analyzed larger droplets, when singing and speaking,

88

as well as flow-related small droplets when singing and playing wind instruments. The study

89

was conducted with a professional singer, two amateur choir singers, five professional

90

musicians (clarinet, flute, oboe, bassoon, and trumpet) and an amateur brass player (trumpet,

91

trombone, and euphonium). The motion of droplets and air leaving either mouth or outlet was

92

observed during exhalation, which was then illuminated with laser and recorded with a digital

93

camera, producing a series of images that were subsequently quantitatively analyzed. The

94

analysis points out that while singing no more airflow was detectable at a distance of 0.5m,

95

regardless of volume, pitch or if the singer was a professional or an amateur. As for wind

96

instruments the analysis of brass instruments showed strong air movements in front of the

97

instrument, which did not reach farther than 0.5m. Woodwinds produced comparably more

98

airflow, reaching a distance of around 1m. Concluding, they recommend a minimal radial

99

distance of 1.5m between singers and wind instrumentalists [9].

100

They furthermore point out the risks of infection in choir singing by the fact that there are

101

social contacts between choir members that are usually part of choir repetitions, e.g. during

102

breaks [10].

103

In addition, there is another study by Parker and Crookston [11] (pre-published in July 2020)

104

which measured aerosols while playing brass instruments and singing. The authors analyzed 7

105

brass instruments (cornet, horn, baritone, euphonium, trombone, Eb tuba and Bb tuba),

106

investigating the effect that playing for a more extended period of time has on the release of

107

particles with comparison to singing, breathing and using a special barrier cap. To investigate

108

the particles released, they were size sorted and counted with a six-channel laser particle

109

counter. It is figured out that breathing produces more respiratory droplets than playing, and

110

the authors state that the use of a barrier reduces the release of aerosols by 95%. They also

111

found that within variation of time the production of aerosols increases again and fresh air

112

conditioning is required [12].

113

At the University of Minnesota a study on aerosol generation from different wind instruments

114

analyzed 15 musicians from the Minnesota Orchestra [13] (playing trumpet, bass trombone,

115

French horn, tuba, piccolo, bassoon, oboe, clarinet and bass clarinet) while playing their

116

instruments, breathing and speaking. By use of an aerodynamic particle sizer, the aerosol

117

concentration and size was measured. In comparison to the aerosol generation of speaking and

118

breathing, the instruments are thereafter categorized into low, intermediate and high-risk

119

levels. They point out that air-jet instruments (piccolo and flute) produce aerosols at the outlet

120

and the other half near the embouchure. Bassoon also produces aerosols at the keyholes, as

121

well as the bell. For woodwinds, in general, the mouthpiece and tube structure play a

122

significant role in the generation of aerosols. For brass instruments they find, that the total

123

length of the tube correlates with the concentration of aerosols (trumpet > bass trombone >

124

French horn > tuba) [14].

125

Furthermore, Mürbe et al. [15] pre-published a study on the increase of aerosols during

126

professional singing. Testing 8 professional singers (two female soprano, two female alto, two

127

male baritone and two male tenor) of the RIAS chamber choir Berlin, they measured particle

128

emission rates with the help of a laser particle counter, during breathing, reading, singing and

129

holding a long tone. They confirm their assumption of singing producing higher emission

130

rates than speaking, with mean measurements of 4.71 – 84.76 P/s during speaking and 753.4 –

131

6093.14 P/s during singing. Women also produced more particle emission rates than men,

132

leading to the assumption that high voices produce a higher sound pressure level than lower

133

voices. On the base of their findings, they assume that singing produces more emission rates

134

of aerosols than speaking or breathing and that an increase of aerosol rates can be observed

135

with an increasing sound pressure level during singing, especially while holding long tones

136

[16].

137

In consideration of their study, Mürbe et al. [17], Kriegel and Hartmann [18], and Hartmann,

138

et al. [19] publish various risk assessments on the risk of infection with virus-loaded aerosols,

139

while singing indoors during the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic, assuming that different styles of

140

singing – e.g. singing vs. speaking – as well as different intensity of voice can lead to various

141

sizes and density of droplets and aerosols [20] and that room situations of choir rehearsals

142

have to be taken into account [21, 22].

143

They also found out that child voices emit fewer aerosols during singing that adults [23]. The

144

study tested 8 children (four girls and four boys) of semiprofessional children’s choirs (Staats-

145

und Domsingknaben Berlin and a girls choir of the Berliner Singakademie), who were all 13

146

years old (except one girl was 15 years old). The study was conducted the same as their

147

previous study on professional adult singers, as mentioned above. Their mean measurements

148

show emission rates of 16 – 267 P/s for speaking, 141 – 1240 P/s for singing, and 683 – 4332

149

P/s for shouting [24].

150

These up-to-date studies looked into the spreading of air or aerosols, while playing wind

151

instruments or singing, focusing on different instruments, singing styles or using different

152

forms of measuring and making airflows visible. They give similar results focusing the

153

visualization of airflows while playing wind instruments and singing. Accordingly different

154

methods were used like the Schlieren method to make respiratory airflows visible [25], the

155

visualization of airborne transmission of professional singers and wind instruments by use of

156

e-cigarette smoke [26, 27], the observation of large and small droplets from wind instruments

157

and singers, on the basis of illuminating airflows with laser and analyzing picture series [28],

158

the release of respiratory aerosols, while speaking and playing brass instruments, as well as

159

for using barrier caps [29], the generation of aerosols of different wind instruments, measured

160

with an aerodynamic particle sizer [30] and the measurement of particle emission rates of

161

professional singers [31] and children [32], leading to several risk assessments of singing

162

indoors during the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic [33, 34, 35].

163

The measurements of our study took place at the beginning of May 2020, when wind

164

instrumentalists had to maintain distances of 12m following official instructions and

165

recommendations by statutory accident insurance. With this background it was tremendous to

166

bring evidence into the field of music making. In this respect, our study aimed to provide

167

funded data on velocity, direction and distance of respiratory air while playing wind

168

instruments.

Materials and Methods

171

Sample

172

Players of brass instruments (trumpet, trombone, horn and tuba), as well as woodwind players

173

(alto flute, piccolo, oboe, English horn, clarinet, bass clarinet, bassoon and contrabassoon) of

174

the Bamberg Symphony voluntarily took part in the study. Two further professional

175

musicians – tenor saxophone and recorder players who are not part of the classical orchestra –

176

have also been included, leading to a total sample of 14 wind instrument players.

177

All persons were asked by the administration of the Bamberg Symphony to take part in the

178

measurements. At this time of lockdown musicians were highly motivated to contribute to

179

research in order to make playing possible again.

180

Consent for the study was given by the Ethics Committee of the Universitätsklinikum

181

Freiburg.

182

In order to exclude infectious persons, all players were questioned before the measurements if

183

they had typical symptoms of the Covid-19 disease. Additionally, everyone’s temperature was

184

taken with an electric fever thermometer, directly before entering the concert hall. No one

185

indicated suspicious symptoms and the measurements of the temperature showed values

186

under the cut-off of 37.5°C in all persons.

187
188

Design and procedure

189

At the beginning of May 2020 measurements were conducted, which were initiated by the

190

Bamberg Symphony Orchestra during the first lockdown of the Covid-19 pandemic in

191

Germany. All solo players for wind instruments of the orchestra (brass: trumpet, trombone,

192

horn and tuba; woodwinds: bassoon, contrabassoon, alto flute, piccolo, oboe, clarinet, bass

193

clarinet and English horn), and an additional professional tenor saxophone and a recorder

194

player, were examined, while playing their instruments.

195

The measurements took place in a typical surrounding for classical musicians, using the stage

196

of the Bamberg Symphony (see S1 Appendix). The aim of the measurements was to first

197

make respiratory air visible and then to measure air velocities at and coming from the

198

instruments’ bell, as well as other outlets (e.g. keyholes or side airs). We wanted to find out

199

where air velocities can be measured, at what value and to what extent. Therefore, special air

200

velocity sensors were put at the bell of the instrument, at the distances of 1m, 1.5m and 2m

201

(see S2 Appendix, S3 Appendix). For the qualitative analysis, the measurements were also

202

filmed on a digital camera, producing videos. For all wind instruments except recorder,

203

qualitative and quantitative measurements could be analyzed. Due to technical disruptive

204

factors for the recorder only qualitative observations are available.

205

All wind instrumentalists played scales, excerpts of music pieces and long tones with different

206

pitches and dynamics (pp – ff), as well as different articulations (e.g. staccato). Particular to

207

the instrument, the measurement focused on the escape of air through tone holes and outlets

208

specifically. Since warming up is different for every instrument and concerning brass winds

209

usually includes a lot of blowing through the mouthpiece (without using the whole

210

instrument), these situations were analyzed as well.

211
212

Visualization of airflow

213

The flow visualization, by use of artificial mist, is one option for on-site-inspection of

214

airflows. Using the technique of flow visualization with the FlowMaker™, swirls have been

215

qualitatively made visible, at the outlet of wind instruments [36, 37].

216

Coming into operation was a harmless artificial fog of SAFEX®-Chemie GmbH [38], which

217

consists of water droplets and is usually used as stage fog [39]. The fog droplets have a size

218

smaller 5µm (see S4 Appendix) and can therefore be compared to the dangerous core droplets

219

of the coronavirus [40].

220

The artificial fog was transported through a system called „Hydra“, using a flexible tube, to

221

the release spot of the instruments, embouchure area, bell, and key openings. Through the

222

application tube, installed on a stand, the fog escaped into the free space of the room and

223

created a cloud of fog. It was oriented towards the musicians, who placed the outlet of their

224

instrument directly into the cloud (see S5 Appendix, showing the horn player).

225

The movement of the fog was filmed with a video camera and qualitatively analyzed

226

afterwards.

227
228

Measurement of air velocity (anemometry)

229

For the measurement of air velocity, omnidirectional (independent of direction) hot film

230

probes type DISA 54N50 Low Velocity Air Flow Analyzer, manufactured by DANTEC were

231

used. The probes have a measuring area of 0 - 1 m/s with an accuracy of 0.2 – 0.4 % full

232

scale. The corresponding electronics (LVFA) give a linear voltage signal of 0 – 2 Volts,

233

according to its velocity, which is recorded with a 20 bit-AD converter in the computer.

234

Before the measurements, the measurement chain (sensor – electronic measurement

235

equipment – signaling cable – converter – computer) was verified in the company-owned

236

wind tunnel against a laser-Doppler anemometer.

237

With a distance of 1m, 1.5m and 2m from the exhaust opening, ball tubes were put on stands

238

and placed in a line. All sensors were at a height of 1m above ground and were adjusted

239

according to the different instruments and their outlet holes (see S3 Appendix).

240

The linear output signal of the controller was mapped with a 20 bit AD converter and

241

recorded on the cable-connected computer every second.

242

The relation of the measuring signal and the actual velocity was verified according to the

243

measurements of the in-house calibration wind tunnel, in the area of 0.15 – 0.7 m/s.

244

Parallel to the measurements of the velocity, video recordings with a manual camera were

245

also conducted.

246

The quantitative measurements were used to support the qualitative observations by focusing

247

the distances of 1m, 1.5m and 2m, measuring air velocities in direction of the instruments’

248

outlets. The video sequences of the qualitative observations were timed with the

249

measurements of the velocity measurement probes, to get the relation of distance, direction

250

and velocity of the emitted air. Hereinafter, the findings are presented by selected measuring

251

charts (e.g. see S6 Appendix). These charts were used as basis for the analysis and were

252

compared to data numbers and video sequences, in order to understand what air velocities

253

were measured where and while doing what kind of playing or warming up.

254
255

Measurement report

256

Among circles of experts on air technology, room air velocities are part of indoor climate

257

discussions. The indoor climate of habitable rooms is called comfort climate: “A climate of

258

comfort persists, when people feel thermally at ease in habitable rooms” [41]. Whether a

259

person is feeling comfortable within a room is – amongst other components, like temperature,

260

etc. – dependent of air velocities, since a comfortable climate is free from draught. Draught is

261

the undesired cooling of the body through air movement. It can be felt from a merit of 0.15

262

m/s, and depends on the size of a room and its ventilation system [42].

263

The perception of comfortableness of concert halls is therefore closely related to ventilation

264

systems of the hall. So-called “well-like ventilations”, coming from the ground, are usually

265

used nowadays [43]. In this relation, the velocity, in which the air exits the ventilation system

266

has to be taken into account, since it is regulating how comfortable the audience feels. For

267

concert halls exit velocities of 0.2 m/s are recommended (in relation to a room temperature of

268

20°), to not surpass an air velocity of 0.15 m/s at the height of 1m (were the audience is

269

sitting) and to stay in the comfort zone of 0.1 – 0.2 m/s [44]. Hence, for concert halls, which

270

have a room temperature of 20°, room air velocities of 0.1 – 0.16 m/s are usually estimated

271

[45].

272

Looking at the circumstances of the concert hall of the Bamberg Symphony, the ventilation

273

system was analyzed in 2017 to understand draught appearances on stage, giving our study

274

funded data on the room air conditions, including the room temperature of 22.3°. Hence, the

275

draught risks – where people start to feel uncomfortable – was stated at 0.15 m/s the highest

276

and therefore considered an area of comfortableness at 0.1 – 0.15 m/s [46].

277

These numbers show that measurements under a merit of 0.1 m/s cannot be recognized by

278

people and are comparable to “background noises”. Simultaneously, they point out that a

279

merit of 0.15 m/s is already felt as draught, leading to a range of room comfortableness

280

between 0.1 – 0.15 m/s. These numbers help to understand the measurements of the air

281

velocities of wind instruments, giving them a relation and comparability. Merits under 0.1 m/s

282

are therefore not considered, while merits of 0.15 or even 0.2 m/s can be understood as

283

remarkable.

284

As a basis for the analysis graphs for every instrument were produced, indicating the findings

285

of an instrument. These charts compare the airflow visualizations of the video sequences to

286

the measured numbers of airflows within the three distances (1m, 1.5m, 2m) in direction of

287

288

Making use of the descriptive analysis, the measurements of every instrument were also put

289

into a table, comparing air velocities of different instruments, at the three different distances.

290

This overview showed the maximum values of every instrument, at every distance – which

291

were compared and put into a relation to the numbers of room comfortableness. Air velocities

292

produced by a wind instrument that are lying under a value of 0.1 m/s do not have an impact

293

on the compartment air and “disappear” amongst “background noises”, meaning velocities.

294

Whereas air velocities with a value over 0.3 m/s are comparable to strong draughts or

295

coughing and therefore have a strong impact on dispersion of air, and in the following, on the

296

dispersion of core droplets, such as SARS-CoV-2 virus droplets.

Results

299

Qualitative flow visualizations by use of artificial fog

300

The qualitative observations served the analysis of airflows while playing (see S8 Appendix)

301

and gave a first insight into the movement of airflows from the different outlets of the

302

instruments. Aside from that, these observations were significant to the position of the sensor

303

for the air velocity measurements, showing precisely at what spot of the instrument airflows

304

escaped the instrument. The sensor of the tuba, for example, was positioned above the

305

instrument, since its outlet directs upgrade, whereas the outlet of the oboe points to the floor

306

and the output of the horn points backwards. The main outlet for the observed brass

307

instruments (trumpet, trombone, horn and tuba) was the bell, whereas for woodwinds

308

keyholes as well as airflows close to the mouthpiece have to be considered.

309

Brass

310

Next to airflows, which escaped at the bell of the brass instruments, further air movements

311

were seen while deflating the instrument, which concerned mainly the trumpet and trombone.

312

This procedure is part of warming-up and generates visible airflows, which can only be seen

313

within a distance of 1m. Comparing these air movements to directed blowing (in direction of

314

the sensors), blowing without the instrument showed stronger and faster air movements in the

315

artificial fog. While the trumpet and trombone players were playing an excerpt of a music

316

piece, only very small air movements were made visible, which mixed with the surrounding

317

room air velocity quickly. As for the tuba and horn no air movements were made visible,

318

while playing.

319

Air-jet woodwinds

320

For the piccolo and alto flute side airflows could be made visible, escaping the mouth close to

321

the mouthpiece, directly reaching to the ground and staying visibly close to the player’s body.

322

Aside from these significant observations no further airflows could be seen at the bell of these

323

two air-jet instruments.

324

For the recorder (early baroque in g, and soprano) small air movements were visible at the

325

labium of the instrument, at a distance of max. 20 cm (see S9 Appendix). Further airflows

326

were not visible at the bell of the recorder, leading to the presumption that the labium can be

327

understood as the instruments’ main outlet (see S10 Appendix).

328

Reed woodwinds

329

Further reed woodwind instruments, which were measured (single reeds: clarinet, bass

330

clarinet, saxophone and double reeds: bassoon, contra bassoon, oboe and English horn)

331

mainly showed airflows escaping the instruments’ bell, with little observations at the

332

keyholes. Even though these instruments showed airflows escaping from the keyholes as well,

333

these air movements showed only little dispersions in the artificial fog.

334

While playing the clarinet, for example, small airflows were visible at the bell of the

335

instrument, which were thereafter compared to blowing without the instrument. This

336

comparison showed how small the air movements with the instrument were, in comparison to

the fast and strong airflows, produced by blowing from the mouth of the clarinetist without

338

the instrument.

340

Measurements of air velocity (anemometry)

341

The air velocity measurements with all wind instruments mostly did not surpass a value of 0.1

342

m/s (see Table 1), while playing an excerpt of a music piece, scales, or different pitches and

343

volumes. Even though air movements were qualitatively seen at the bell of some wind

344

instruments, these qualitative observations did not reach measurements of more than 0.1 m/s,

345

which is the value of usual room air velocities in hall-like rooms. Hence, some little air

346

movements were measurable at the 1m sensor (concerning tuba: 0.13 m/s, oboe: 0.15 m/s and

347

contrabassoon: 0.11 m/s – at the 1m sensor), not surpassing measurements of 0.1 m/s at the

348

1.5 or 2m sensor.

351

Brass instruments

352

The playing of trumpet, trombone, horn and tuba showed only little or no airflows in the

353

artificial fog. However, there was a difference between playing and warming up. Since brass

354

players often use only mouthpieces while warming up, direct airflows are produced, which

355

can reach measurements higher than 0.1 m/s. In comparison, loudness or pitch did not have an

356

impact on the air velocities (see S6 Appendix, S7 Appendix).

357

Trumpet

358

While playing different scales, high and medium pitches, all measurements of the trumpet

359

stayed under 0.1 m/s at any distance, which corresponds with the usual room air velocity.

360

However, when the player deflated the instrument air velocities reached 0.14 m/s at a distance

361

of 1m from the bell, while at 1.5m and 2m they stayed under 0.1 m/s. Comparing these

362

numbers to the values of blowing without the instrument, the measurements were much

363

higher, producing air movements of 0.52 m/s to the front, at a distance of 1m. At 1.5m during

364

blowing without the instrument they dropped to 0.15 m/s and at a distance of 2m they stayed

365

under 0.1 m/s.

366

Trombone

367

Similar to the measurements of the trumpet, air velocities of the trombone did not surpass a

368

value of 0.1 m/s while playing scales and different pitches, and even while deflating, at any

369

distance.

370

When the person only blowing, without the instrument or the mouthpiece, the highest

371

measurements were made, reaching a value of 0.4 m/s at 1m, 0.18 m/s at 1.5m to the front and

372

0.1 m/s at 2m.

373

Horn

374

For the horn all measurements stayed under a value of 0.1 m/s at all three distances,

375

regardless of whether they were playing an excerpt from a music piece, different pitches or

376

volumes.

377

Tuba

378

The tuba did reach the highest measurements of all brass instruments during playing a music

379

piece or warm up with the instrument. While playing scales and while deflating they did not

380

surpass a value of 0.1 m/s, at every distance. But, when the player did an excerpt of a music

381

piece or warmed up the instrument, the measurements reached 0.13 m/s at a distance of 1m

382

upwards (in the direction of the bell), and stayed again under 0.1 m/s at 1.5m and 2m.

383
384

Wood-wind instruments

385

For some wood-winds, the measurements indicate that air movements were not only visible at

386

the bell of the instrument, but also at other outlets, such as side-air observations or airflows

387

escaping tone holes – concerning difference between air-jet woodwinds and reed woodwinds.

388

As for single reed and double reed woodwinds, there were no significant differences in the

389

measurements.

390

Air-jet woodwinds

391

Since there were qualitative observations of side-air movements for both air-jet woodwinds,

392

another sensor was put up at 0.5m to the side of the player, measuring side-air velocities.

393

Alto flute

394

Regardless of what the flute player was playing all measurements to all sides and distances

395

stayed under 0.1 m/s. The additional measurements to the side reached a value of 0.15 m/s at

396

a distance of 0.5m.

397

Piccolo

398

The measurements at the bell of the piccolo stayed under a maximal value of 0.1 m/s and

399

therefore mixed with the usual room air velocity of the concert hall. Other than the flute, side-

400

air measurements for the piccolo showed a slightly smaller value of 0.13 m/s.

401

Single reed woodwinds

402

The qualitative observations showed air movements at the keyholes of several reed

403

woodwinds, which were considered due to the front sensor at 1m.

404

Clarinet

405

The measurements for the clarinet, at all distances did not surpass a value of 0.1 m/s,

406

regardless of whether they were playing scales, different pitches or an excerpt from a music

407

piece.

408

Bass clarinet

409

Air velocity measurements for the bass clarinet did not surpass a value of 0.1 m/s, with no

410

difference of what was played (an excerpt from a music piece, long tones or staccato), at a

411

distance of 1m in the direction of the bell, and stayed under a value of 0.1 m/s at 1.5m and

412

2m.

413

Tenor saxophone

414

The measurements for tenor saxophone playing did not reach a measurement of air velocity

415

over 0.1 m/s at all distances – regardless of what the player was playing.

416

Double reed woodwinds

417

Oboe

418

The measurements of the oboe reached a value of 0.15 m/s at a distance of 1m, 0.12 m/s at

419

1.5m and stayed under the usual room air movement of 0.1 m/s at 2m.

420

Bassoon

421

All measurements of the bassoon stayed under a value of 0.1 m/s at all distances,

422

independently of what was played.

423

Contrabassoon

424

All measured data of the contrabassoon stayed at 0.1 m/s, with no difference between long

425

tones or an excerpt from a music piece, at all distances from the bell.

426

English horn

427

While playing the English horn, regardless of what was played, all measurements in direction

428

of the bell stayed under a value of 0.1 m/s.

429
430

Woodwind and brass instruments, with ambient noises

431

As a counter phase to the individual measurements, situations with ambient noises were also

432

considered, since they happen frequently during orchestra rehearsals or concerts, e.g. while

433

setting up, rebuilding the stage or simply while everyone walks to their seats. Within these

434

test set-ups the musicians were also playing, while someone walked across the room or other

435

people were talking to each other.

436

During these measurements we tried to differentiate between air velocities coming from the

437

players or the surroundings. Hence, it was shown that the air velocities could clearly be

438

separated, since they stayed very close to the instrument’s player (see S11 Appendix) or came

439

from the disturbing noises, which rose instantly as soon as someone passed the measurement

440

points or spoke to the player. Simply raising a hand making a very small movement did show

441

air velocity measurements at the closest sensor, making it very sensitive to airflow

442

movements.

443

The measurements concerning ambient noises are obviously higher than those of measuring

444

individual instrumentalists. They rose up to 0.55 m/s, when people around the players were

445

talking and stayed within a measurement range of 0.18 – 0.55 m/s, when someone walked

446

pass the person playing.

447

448

Discussion

449

This study observed 14 wind instruments played by soloists of the Bamberg Symphony:

450

trumpet, trombone, horn, tuba, alto flute, piccolo, oboe, clarinet, bass clarinet, bassoon, contra

451

bassoon, English horn, saxophone and recorder (the last two instruments by external

452

professional players). Since the measurements with all players were conducted in the concert

453

hall of the Bamberg Symphony, it has a high external validity for professional classical music

454

settings.

455

On the basis of our air velocity measurements, we find that distance regulations of 2m to the

456

front and 1.5m to the side are maintainable. A finding that is supported by Becher, et al. [47],

457

Kähler and Hain [48], He, et al. [49], Echternach, et al. [50], and Mürbe, et al [51]. The values

458

of the analyzed wind instruments mostly did not surpass a value of 0.1 m/s at all distances

459

while playing an excerpt from a music piece, scales, or different pitches and volumes, with

460

exceptions for the tuba: reaching a value of 0.13 m/s at 1m, oboe: 0.15 m/s at 1m and

461

contrabassoon: 0.11 m/s at 1m. These exceptions concern measurements at the 1m sensor, all

462

of them not surpassing measurements of 0.15 m/s, which is still considered to be part of the

463

comfortable room air climate [52]. Furthermore, some slight air movements were

464

qualitatively seen at the bell of some wind instruments. These qualitative observations did not

465

reach measurements of more than 0.1 m/s, which is the value of usual room air velocities in

466

hall-like rooms.

467

Only one study, conducted at the LMU [53] suggests a farther distance regulation of 3m to the

468

front and 2m to the side for alto flute players, since the investigators observed farther

469

respiratory air clouds for this instrument especially. On the basis of our observations as well

470

as the measurements, air-jet woodwinds produce strong side air movements, which did, in our

471

case, stay within a reach of 1m to the player. Therefore, we cannot relate to the suggestion of

472

3m to the front and 2m to the side, but agree with the fact that side air movements have to be

473

seriously considered.

474

Due to their production of side air movements, the air-jet woodwinds alto flute and piccolo

475

receive a special position in our findings. They reached high measurements of 0.13 m/s

476

(piccolo) and 0.15 m/s (alto flute) to the side at a distance of 0.5m, which escaped directly

477

into the room. This observation highlights the importance of the structure and the mouthpiece

478

of wind instruments and that it is relevant which wind instrument is taken into account.

479

Becher et al. [54] support this finding, by observing a maximal value of air dispersion at

480

1.12m from the mouth of the piccolo player into the room. The measurement from the bell of

481

the piccolo though was around 0.2m. The high number of 1.12m came from the side air,

482

which was released due to way the instrument is overblown. This finding also corresponds

483

with Becher et al.’s [55] finding on the importance of individual blowing techniques for air

484

movements. We thus affiliate with Becher et al.’s [56] as well as He et al.’s [57] assumption

485

that the structure on an instrument as well as the way a mouthpiece is blown has a significant

486

influence on the generated air velocity while playing, the distance it reaches, and in the

487

following, its generation of aerosols [58].

488

Hence, our findings do point out that there is a difference between playing the instrument and

489

warming up the instrument, by simply using a mouthpiece – a typical practice for brass winds.

490

As with the study of Kähler and Hain [59], we observed that pitch or volume do not have a

491

significant impact on the velocity of air movements. Thereinafter, we found out that using

492

only a mouthpiece for warm-up-playing, produces strong and fast airflows. Measurements of

493

up to 0.5 m/s were made for warming up, in relation to 0.13 m/s for playing (at the 1m

494

sensor), confirming the suggested visual observations. These warm-ups usually take place in

495

single rooms, before the concert, but they are often conducted as well during a concert or

496

rehearsal. Regarding the high air velocities produced we strongly suggest, to not blow through

497

a mouthpiece (without the instrument), when other musicians are around.

498

Comparing brass and woodwinds, it was qualitatively seen as well as quantitatively measured

499

that professional brass players do not produce air movements at the mouthpiece, but at the

500

bell of the instruments. Unlike Kähler and Hain [60], we did not observe a severe difference

501

between the production of respiratory air movements between woodwinds or brass winds. The

502

difference we observed lies more within the structure of the instrument and its mouthpiece, as

503

mentioned above. He et al. [61] also point out the difference between brass and woodwinds,

504

which we can relate to but not support to its full content, since air velocity measurements did

505

not diversify significantly.

506

As for woodwinds, a difference between so-called air-jet woodwinds and reed woodwinds

507

was not only qualitatively observed, but also quantitatively measured.

508

The difference between reed and double reed woodwinds was not significant according to our

509

measurements, and is therefore not taken into account. But it has to be mentioned, that reed

510

woodwinds produce little air movements at their tone holes. These air movements were seen

511

in the qualitative observations, but did not reach significant values that would surpass usual

512

room air velocities of 0.1 m/s.

513

As for the measurements of the oboe, which are comparably high (0.15 m/s at 1m and 0.12

514

m/s at 1.5m), we assume that surrounding air velocities lead to these values. Otherwise, the
22

515

values are not plausible, considering the way the instrument and the mouthpiece are played

516

and also regarding our qualitative observation. It can be expected that the measurements

517

should be similar to those of other double reed instruments, such as bassoon or contrabassoon,

518

which reach a merit of 0.1 m/s at 1m (for the contrabassoon) and stay below 0.1 m/s beyond

519

1.5m (for both double reeds).

520

Aside from our findings, some limitations of our study have to be taken into account.

521

First, the study was conducted with highly professional classical wind instrumentalists and the

522

results can therefore not automatically be taken into account for other musical genres and

523

settings or amateur musicians.

524

Second, the test situation was rather specific. We took into account different test settings:

525

playing setting up the stage (concerning noises and movements of the surrounding) and

526

playing with nothing else happening around. Furthermore, the difference between playing and

527

warming-up was considered. Therefore, the findings are very representative for orchestras and

528

a high level of playing, with restricted transferability for the amateur music sector. Since the

529

players have been a part of the analysis and know their instruments very well, relevant airflow

530

outputs were identified, for each instrument. This seems to be one of the strengths of our

531

study.

532

Further limitations concern the fact that the measurements were conducted with one person

533

per instrument only, while being sensitive to individual differences of blowing or lung

534

volume, etc. And they were only performed once for every instrument, whereas more

535

repetitions of the same sequence played, would have given more information on

536

reproducibility of the test setting.

537

Another limitation for the measurement is the fact that the air velocity measurements are very

538

sensitive to surrounding movements, with the waving of a hand already influencing the

539

measurements at the sensors.

540

541

Conclusion

542

The test results have pointed out that most wind instruments do not have any visual or

543

measureable influence on the movement of compartment air. Merely while playing alto flute

544

light flow movements were visible, close to the musician’s body. Regarding all wind

545

instruments, beyond a distance of 1.5m to the front, no airflows could be measured and

546

therefore no difference compared to usual airflows of hall-like rooms (e.g. movie theatres,

547

theatres, auditoriums, opera, etc.) could be located.

548

Since no respiratory air movements – of any wind instrument analyzed – were measured at

549

the 2m sensor, we find distance regulations of 2m to the front of wind instrument players

550

maintainable.

551

In order to maintain a responsible risk management, we find it crucial that besides distance

552

regulations and line-up (e.g. large ensembles), constant fresh air conditioning and the social

553

behavior are being considered. Starting from April 2020, the Freiburg Institute of Musicians’

554

Medicine constantly updated an official paper on “risk assessment of a coronavirus infection

555

in the field of music” (updated: 2020 May 19, 2020 July 1, 2020 July 17, 2020 December 14),

556

stating the findings of our various studies publicly [62] and establishing a permanent

557

consultation on questions concerning the relationship between the coronavirus and music

558
