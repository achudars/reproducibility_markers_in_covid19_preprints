CONDENSED ABSTRACT
COVID-19 has affected every aspect of life worldwide. In the electrophysiology labs
of Wenzhou, Milan and London, activity was suspended as the disease took hold.
Only Wenzhou has resumed normal services, facilitated by a monumental
nationwide program of public health interventions and supported by stringent testing
protocols.

WHAT’S NEW
•

We describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on interventional
electrophysiology units in 3 cities: Wenzhou, Milan and London.

•

In all cases, the routine work of the electrophysiology was virtually suspended
within a week of the recognition of widespread virus transmission in the area.

•

During the period of restricted activity imposed by the pandemic, centres have
dealt with a small number of emergency ablations only, a balanced mix of
atrial, ventricular and junctional arrhythmias.

•

In 2 of the 3 centres, electrophysiologists were redeployed to perform other
medical duties including in COVID-19 wards.

•

COVID-19 infection occurred in medical and nursaing staff in 2 of the 3
centres.

•

Only in the cases of Wenzhou, China, has a resumption of normal activity
been possible; this follows intensive public health intervention and is protected
by stringent testing.

ABSTRACT

Aims: To chart the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the activity of
interventional electrophysiology services in affected regions.
Methods: We reviewed the electrophysiology laboratory records in 3 affected
cities: Wenzhou in China, Milan in Italy and London, United Kingdom. We
interviewed electrophysiologists in each centre to gather information on the
impact of the pandemic on working patterns and on the health of staff
members.
Results: There was a striking decline in interventional electrophysiology
activity in each of the centres. The decline occurred within a week of the
recognition of widespread community transmission of the virus in each region
and shows a striking correlation with the national figures for new diagnoses of
COVID-19 in each case. During the period of restriction, work-flow dropped to
<5% of normal, consisting of emergency cases only. In 2 of 3 centres,
electrophysiologists were redeployed to perform emergency work outside
electrophysiology. Among the centres studied, only Wenzhou has seen a
recovery from the restrictions in activity. Following an intense nationwide
program of public health interventions, local transmission of COVID-19
ceased to be detectable after February 18th allowing the electrophysiology
service to resume with a strict testing regime for all patients.
Conclusion: Interventional electrophysiology is vulnerable to closure in times
of great social difficulty including the COVID-19 pandemic. Intense public
health intervention can permit suppression of local disease transmission
allowing resumption of some normal activity.

BACKGROUND
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused suffering and death across the world since late
2019.1,2 Physicians and journalists encountering the arrival of the epidemic in an
area typically describe a wave, a tide or a tsunami of disease. It has had a widely
publicised impact on the economy of afflicted areas. Medical services have suffered
massive disruption. Even services far removed from respiratory medicine and critical
care have suffered because of the diversion of resources needed to support the
victims of the epidemic and through the illness of staff. As a resource-intensive
speciality that deals predominantly with non-emergency cases, interventional
electrophysiology is particularly vulnerable to disruption.
While the pandemic disrupts the delivery of routine electrophysiology services,
COVID-19 is associated with cardiac complications which could bring an additional
burden of acute problems to electrophysiology.3-5 The relative importance of the
reduction in elective cases and any increase in emergency work is undefined.
Wenzhou, Milan and London are each cities with a metropolitan area population of
more than 4 million people; each has each been struck by the pandemic. During the
initial months of 2020, Wenzhou experienced the greatest concentration of COVID19 cases of any Chinese city outside the Hubei province.6 Following an intense
program of public health interventions7, new cases declined and have now vanished.
As of March 27th 2020, Wenzhou has had no new case of COVID-19 for the last 38
consecutive days. With this, many sectors have begun to return toward normality
with stringent precautions. Milan was close to the centre of the Italian outbreak of
COVA-19 and had to suspend all activity the first week in March.8 London, like the
rest of the United Kingdom has seen an abrupt rise in the disease incidence only
since the second week of March 2020.9 The disruption for cardiac electrophysiology
labs has begun.

METHODS
We reviewed the catheter lab records of electrophysiology laboratories in a centre
that experienced a high burden of COVID-19 early and near the origin of the
pandemic and one in which the onset was delayed. The impact on workflow resulting
from the redirection of staff and resources was correlated with the case-load of

COVID-19. We charted the burden of emergency procedures performed to look for
evidence of any augmentation of these arising from COVID-19, and we interviewed
the

encountered in the COVID-19 population. We looked for instances of COVID-19
infection acquired in hospital by electrophysiology patients and staff. We
documented the protocols used to permit the resumption of activity after the first
wave of the epidemic and examined the success of anti-infective precautions.

RESULTS
The first diagnosis of COVID-19 in Wenzhou Medical University was in mid-January
2020; In Lomardy a large outbreak became evident on February 22nd, while in St
George’s Hospital, London cases began to arrive in large number from the second
week in March. In all cases, there was a sharp downturn in activity within days after
the recognition of widespread COVA-19 transmission in the area (figure 1).

Effect on routine work
In each of the centres, routine activity of the EP lab was suspended within a week of
the first locally diagnosed COVID-19 case in the hospital (table 1). The primary
reason for the prompt suspension in each case was the concern that continuing to
admit patients for elective procedures would expose patients to the risk of infection
from undiagnosed COVID-19 patients already in the hospital.

Electrophysiological emergencies during the COVID-19 crisis
We encountered no instance of an arrhythmia occurring as a definable consequence
of COVID-19 that required ablation as an emergency procedure. A small number of
patients required emergency ablation during the period of restricted activity (table 2,
figure 2), but this represented less than 5% of the normal workload of the centres.
The distribution of cases was similar to that encountered in normal times with
supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation all
represented.

Nosocomial Infection
One patient in London acquired COVID-19, apparently in hospital after her ablation.
She died of pneumonia associated with the condition at 18 days after the ablation.
Two electrophysiologists in London including a co-author of this paper acquired it
and recovered without complication. Three nurses in a cardiology ward in Milan were
infected, but none of the electrophysiologists. In Wenzhou, no staff member was
infected.

Resumption of normal activity
Of the centres involved, only Wenzhou has been able to resume routine activity. This
became possible because of a country-wide suppression of the epidemic produced
by an intensive program of public health interventions across the country. This
included a period of lock-down accompanied by intensive contact-tracing and use of
isolation. Mobile technology played an integral part. Electronic tracking of each
individual was conducted with a traffic-light system to inform the person and those in
close proximity of their health and travel status.
Having achieved the virtual elimination of virus transmission in most of the country
by late February, routine activity resumed with stringent precautions:
1) Patients underwent a pre-assesment visit the day before hospital admission.
At this visit, a nasal swab was analysed by PCR for evidence of the virus.
2) Patients with a satisfactory screening visit were admitted on the morning of
the scheduled procedure and underwent a second nasal swab. If the PCR
was negative for the virus, the procedure went ahead as planned.

Outpatient activity
In all centres, outpatient activity was moved to a telephone-based or internet-based
format in all possible cases from the time that widespread local transmission of the
virus was recognised. Only those who were clinically urgent and were unable to to
use a telephone or required an instrumental test were allowed to keep their physical

appointments. Outpatient investigations were cancelled unless clinically urgent.
Patients who had access to mobile-phone associated ECG recording were
encouraged to use these and transmit recordings in preparation for telephone
consultations.

EP Education
As part of social distancing, all EP educational meetings were suspended in all
centres, and all major international meetings have been cancelled. Electronic
learning has been put into practice across several medical disciplines and improving
web-based educational tools. Major medical examinations such as the Membership
exam (MRCP) and university entrance exams have been delayed indefinitely.

EP team redeployment
The EP team in Wenzhou and that in London defaulted to emergency mode at the
arrival of the first COVID cases. With elective work being cancelled, the
electrophysiologists concentrated on urgent inpatient intervention including
pacemaker implantation to minimist the time that any patient had to spend in
hospital. The centres differed in their policies on redistributing staff to other duties.

DISCUSSION
“I think it better that in times like these
A poet's mouth be silent, for in truth
We have no gift to set a statesman right”

William Yates10

The electrophysiologist, like the poet is a luxury that society may dispense with when
times are exceptionally difficult. Our work reduces or resolves troublesome
symptoms; in narrow subgroups of the population that we serve, we may increase
life expectancy, albeit marginally. In achieving this we expend resources that may be
better used elsewhere in difficult times and we bring patients into a healthcare

environment that has suddenly become dangerous. We have no expertise that is
relevant to the management of an epidemic but we have qualities that might be
useful: Being delicate and unnecessary we may serve as an indicator of the health of
our surroundings.
The results presented show that in representative centres from several of the worstaffected countries, the arrival of COVID-19 caused a complete cessation of routine
electrophysiological intervention. A small number of urgent ablations were performed
in patients without infection. Although arrhythmias were encountered in patients
hospitalised with COVID-19, these were all either terminal events in the context of
cardiomyopathy resulting from the condition or were related to the metabolic and
haemodynamic stress arising from infection and mechanical ventilation. No instance
was encountered of an arrhythmia arising from COVID-19 requiring urgent ablation.

COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronarvirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent
responsible for COVID-19 has an affinity for angiotensin converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) receptors.11 This is central to the pathophysiology of the condition, leading to
pneumonia and in critical stages, associated fulminant acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure.12 The primary affected organ is the lung
but cardiovascular injury is also common. There is enhanced expression of ACE-2 in
those with cardiovascular conditions, possibly accounting for the apparent greater
severity of COVID-19 related illness in these patients. In one study, a majority (58%)
of those with severe infection had a background of hypetension, and non-specifically
44% had a history of ‘arrhythmia’.13
Binding of the virus to ACE2 receptors in the lung and the heart initiates the acute
inflammatory response. Pneumonia results, but also evidence of myocarditis; those
with a rise in high-sensitivity Troponin I are more likely to require admission to
intensive care.14 There is a strong association between a history of hypertension and
mortality from COVID-19. Systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in those
with COVID-19 treated in intensive care units compared to those not requiring this
level of care (144 versus 122, P<0.001).14 This may relate to up-regulation of ACE2
receptors in those receiving ACE inhibiting drugs.

A history of ischaemic heart disease also predicts mortality in COVID-19. Any acute
inflammatory condition can destabilise coronary plaque and triger acute coronary
syndromes. A minority of patients with COVID-19 may present acutely with cardiac
sounding symptoms.13 It is not clear whether the apparent high mortality in patients
with ischaemic heart disease represents an effect on ACE2 receptor expression, a
vulnerability to ischaemic complications of the systemic illness or a bias against such
patients when ventilatiors must be rationed. The pathophysiology of COVID-19 and
its routes of systemic transmission remain incompletely understood. Observations
had been noted of its neuroinvasive potential via peripheral neuronal trans-synaptic
route and viral preponderance in organs with low expression of ACE2.15
Brugada syndrome is a concern as the prolonged febrile illness characteristic of
COVID-19 has the propensity to trigger arrhythmias. No such case has been
reported, but like patients with heart failure and ischaemic heart disease, those with
Brugada syndrome should take particular care to isolate themselves from likely
sources of infection.
No specific pharmacological therapy exists, but drugs being trialled in treating
aspects of COVID-19 include anti-retrovirals and hydrochloroquine. These drugs
may cause cardiotoxicitiy and prolong corrected QT intervals. No instance of a lifethreatening arrhythmia from this source has been reported.

Transmission to Healthcare providers
The risk of COVID-19 transmission to healthcare workers is high, with over 8%
reported in Italy.16 Ophthalmologists have been disproportionately affected, probably
because of the close contact with the patients in whom conjunctivitis has been a
presenting symptom.17 Intensivists are at risk due to their inevitable extensive
contact with severely affected patients and due to aerosol generation during
intubation. Cardiology, including ablation and trans-esophageal echo also involves
aerosol generating procedures (AGP) and close proximity to the patient.
Under normal circumstances, a patient entering the cardiac catheter lab will
encounter approximately 10 healthcare professionals before moving to a ward for
recovery. The combination of numerous close contacts and fomites creates a risk of
transmission. It makes sense to defer procedures whenever possible. Emergency

procedures should be undertaken with strict infection control including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
Before COVID-19, China was already experienced in infection control protocols due
to their experience of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003,
and a rapid and effective response took place once the problem was recognised. In
contrast, without any recent experience to draw on, Italy and the UK had been
relatively unprepared for the scale of the events.
Like China, Hong Kong was culturally sensitised by experience of SARS and
produced swift and effective intervention to protect the public and healthcare
workers, avoiding the spread of infection in healthcare settings. This involved a 3level hierarchy of control measures: administrative control, environmental control and
the use of PPE.17 Rigorous screening of the prospective patients took place to avoid
bringing the virus into the uninfected healthcare environment.

EP patient cohort
Many patients scheduled for EP procedures fall into categories at high risk of death if
exposed to COVID-19. In the London cohort, the average age is 65, and >60% are
male.18 Co-existing diabetes, hypertension or heart failure are common. All of these,
particularly hypertension are strong risk factors for COVID-19 related mortality. It
was therefore obligatory to halt the performance of routine ablation procedures until
the risk recedes.
Not all EP patients can wait on indefinitely. Guidelines published by NHS England,19
include narrow criteria for ablation in this crisis, recommending that it is limited to
cases of rapidly conducted pre-excited atrial fibrillation, heart failure secondary to
tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia that is controllable with medication. All of the
ablations conducted in all 3 centres during the period of restricted activity met these
criteria (figure 2, table 2).

Catheter lab protocols
Strict guidelines were put in place in each centre to minimise the risk to patients and
staff in cases where ablation had to be performed. Local protocols mirored published

consensus documents.20 Strict isolation measures were applied before and after any
procedure. During the procedure, staff wore PPE.

EP Industry
The reduction in electrophysiology caseload related to the pandemic will effect the
EP industry. Companies which supply equipment have shut offices and distribution
networks. Loss of revenue will last for many months. Companies may prosper and
may help the fight against the pandemic by switching production to items of
relevance to that fight: Ventilators and associated equipment, viral test kits and
thermometers.

Public Health Measures
In China, the official recognition of the seriousness of the outbreak and the take-over
by central government of direct responsibility for its handling coincided with the
introduction of an integrated set of measures.7 Best publicised was the lock-down of
society and industry to achieve extreme social distancing. The less-publicised
adjunct to the lock-down was the introduction of a system for screening all persons
with fever or with a history of contact with known cases, so that they could be
isolated in designated facilities. The use of electronic technology and surveillance
served as an adjunct to these measures.
The short-term impact of China’s program of public health measures is evident from
the progression of the epidemic (figure 1). In China, a single decisive act brought all
necessary measures into being at a time when deaths were in low double figures. In
Italy and in the UK as across Europe, distancing measures were introduced
piecemeal and later in the course of events, and the infrastructure for the
identification of infected individuals and the tracing, testing and isolation of contacts
has not yet been developed.
The experience from Wenzhou shows that with energetic public health intervention,
the epidemic may be suppressed, and normal life may resume with precautions. In
the longer term, a vaccine may permit us to dispense with these precautions. The
less stringent interventions chosen by the UK and other North European countries

risk allowing a lingering epidemic that drags on for so long that by the time a vaccine
comes, production and supply chains will have fallen into habitual disuse and
operators will have lost familiarity with their craft. Many patients will also have died
by then.

CONCLUSION
In the Spring of 2020, as in the Summer of 1914, it feels as though “the lamps are
going out all over Europe”, but there is reason for hope. Vigorous public health
measures have suppressed the epidemic in parts of Asia, permitting a resumption of
some normal routine activity with stringent precautions.

FIGURE LEGENDS

Figure 1: Chronology of events in the first 87 days of 2020
In each of the electrophysiology labs, routine activity was cancelled as soon as the
country detected significant numbers of COVID-19 cases. During the period of
suspension of routine activity, very few emergency procedures were performed. Of
the 3 centres, only Wenzhou had been able to resume normal activity.

Figure 2: Impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on workflow in electrophysiology.
The pie-charts indicate the mean number of each category of each procedure carried
out per week in 2020 in each centre in the period before COVID-19 arrived, in the
period of restricted activity and in the case of Wenzhou after the resumption of
normal activity. The workload during the period of crisis represents the mean number
of cases per week per centre across all 3 centres, and represents a fall of more than
95% compared to pre-crisis activity without a clear-cut alteration in the breakdown of
procedure types.
