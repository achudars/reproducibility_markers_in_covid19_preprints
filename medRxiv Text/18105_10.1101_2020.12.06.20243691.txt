Abstract:
Introduction:
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 and the associated disease, Covid-19, continue to pose a global
health threat. The CovidCalculatorUK is an open-source online tool (covidcalculatoruk.org) that
estimates the probability that an individual patient, who presents to a UK hospital, will later test
positive for SARS-CoV2. The objective is to aid cohorting decisions and minimise nosocomial
transmission of SARS-CoV2.
Methods:
This n = 500 prospective, observational, multicentre, validation study compared the
CovidCalculatorUK’s estimated probability of Covid-19 with the first SARS-CoV2
oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swab result for individual patients admitted to hospital during the
study period (01.04.20 - 18.05.20). A comparison with senior clinicians’ estimates of the probability
of Covid-19 was also made.
Results:
Patients who were prospectively grouped, by the CovidCalculatorUK, into 0-30% estimated
probability, 30-60% and 60-100% estimated probability went on to have first swab SARS-CoV2
positive results in: 15.7%, 30.5% and 61.9% of cases, respectively. CovidCalculatorUK performance
demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.76 (95% CI 0.71 – 0.81) (p < 0.001). Senior clinician
stratification of the estimated probability of Covid-19 performed similarly to the CovidCalculatorUK.
Conclusion:
The CovidCalculatorUK provides a reasonably accurate estimate of the probability of an individual
testing positive on their first SARS-CoV2 nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab. The
CovidCalculatorUK output performs similarly to a senior clinician’s estimate. Further evolution of the
calculator may improve performance.

Introduction:
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 and its associated disease, Covid-19, continue to pose a global
health threat. Throughout 2020, UK hospitals have treated exceptional numbers of patients with
Covid-19 . Given the infectious nature of Covid-19, patients with suspected or confirmed Covid-19
are often admitted to predetermined wards, in a process known as “cohorting”. The Centres for
Disease Control (CDC) define cohorting as: “the practice of grouping together patients who are
colonised or infected with the same organism to confine their care to one area and prevent contact
with other patients” . In UK hospitals, nosocomial SARS-CoV2 transmission occurred in large
numbers during the first wave before specific control measures were introduced .

RT-PCR (reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) testing on nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal
swabs, or sputum/deep tracheal samples, is the current gold standard diagnostic test . During the
first wave of Covid-19 in the UK the delay from taking a swab in hospital to receiving the result
ranged from one to three days , though more rapid options are being explored . During this time,
whilst cohorting was being used to minimise nosocomial transmission, the uncertainty regarding the
possible diagnosis of Covid-19 led to difficult clinical decision-making regarding the optimal ward for
individual patients that required admission to hospital .

The “CovidCalculatorUK” is a simple, open-source, not-for-profit online tool
(https://CovidCalculatorUK.org/) that provides an estimate of the probability that an individual
patient will later test positive for SARS-CoV2. The calculator is based upon published international
data on SARS-CoV2 diagnostic features, including cough, fever, radiological findings and results from
the full blood count. The calculator input is seven simple questions, the output is an immediatelyavailable estimation of the probability (expressed as a percentage) that an individual patient will
later test positive for SARS-CoV2. The CovidCalculatorUK was launched on 31 March 2020, in the
early phase of the first wave of Covid-19 in the UK.

Many diagnostic aids for triaging suspected Covid-19 cases are available , including
programs/apps , online resources , scoring systems , decision trees and nomograms . Jehi
et al. 2020 describe an open-source online calculator with a similar output to the CovidCalculatorUK,
though with a focus on community prediction of Covid-19 diagnoses . Though many are available,
the authors are not aware of any diagnostic aid using the method employed in the present study,
which is based upon the JAMA Rational Clinical Examination Bayesian methodology . Of the
available diagnostic aids, few offer the simplicity and rapidity of the format used by the
CovidCalculatorUK – allowing results to be gained in under 15 seconds of data entry from any online

device. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study that includes and compares estimates
produced by a Covid-19 diagnostic tool, estimates produced by senior clinicians, SARS-CoV2 swab
results and the cohorted location of the patients.
We present an examination of whether the CovidCalculatorUK produces an accurate prediction of
the first SARS-CoV2 swab result, as well as a comparison with senior clinicians’ judgements. The
wider objective is to aid and inform cohorting decisions and minimise nosocomial transmission of
SARS-CoV2.

Methods:
The method used to create the CovidCalculatorUK is described in supplementary file 1. This
prospective, observational, validation study gathered data from three NHS hospitals within the UK,
two in England, one in Scotland. At site one 38 days between 01.04.20 and 18.05.20 were selected
(chosen for research team availability) and all patients admitted through the medical “take” on the
selected days were included in the analysis. At site two and three all medical patients admitted in
the defined period were included (site two 23.4.20 - 28.4.20, site three 20.3.20 - 20.04.20). The
availability of the research team defined the study period at each site. The validation study ran until
500 patients were included in the analysis. Temperature (assessed with an infra-red tympanic
thermometer) and fraction of inhaled oxygen were recorded from the first set of observations taken
upon arrival to hospital. Presence or absence of cough was assessed by the clerking doctor. Whether
the chest radiograph or computed tomography scan of the chest were deemed “abnormal” was
recorded according to the judgement of the clinical team.
Within eight hours of admission, the research team used the CovidCalculatorUK to estimate the
probability of Covid-19 for each individual and recorded this data. Senior clinicians (Consultants,
Registrars & SAS Doctors) did not have access to this data at the time. The senior clinicians were
asked about their feelings regarding the probability of Covid-19 (in two formats: binary yes/no and in
graded probability: no suspicion/some suspicion/high suspicion) in the individual in question and the
data recorded. If the clinical team was unavailable the medical notes were examined to ascertain the
documented suspicion of Covid-19 and the cohorting location. Clinicians’ assessments and cohorting
locations were available at study site one and two only.
Patients were excluded from the validation analysis if there was insufficient clinical data. As a
minimum, for the data entry to the calculator, the presence/absence of fever and cough had to be
recorded. Patients were excluded if there was a known positive SARS-CoV2 swab in the 14 days prior

to admission. Hospital protocol, at all three sites (during the study period), dictated that SARS-CoV2
swabs be sent for all medical admissions. SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR swab results were reviewed 10 days
later, and the results of any swabs within that time period entered into the dataset. Patients without
a swab result during the 10-day period were excluded from the study.
Statistical analysis (SPSS V26, Excel 2016) was performed by grouping the CovidCalculatorUK output
into estimated probability groups of 0-30%, 30-60% and 60-100% (group thresholds were
determined post hoc). Division into three categories was chosen to mirror clinical protocols
categorising patients into low, medium and high risk, or by the red-amber-green “traffic light”
system. The analysis assessed accuracy of prediction when compared with the observed test results
using the current gold standard test (RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs), as well as
comparison with clinician estimates. Laboratory assay used: Altona RealStar SARS-CoV-2 Assay.
Primary analysis focused on the first SARS-CoV2 swab for each included patient. Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves were used to explore the optimal cut-offs (of the calculator output) to
categorise individuals/groups most effectively. Student’s t-test was calculated for difference of
means, Mann-Whitney U test for ROC AUC analysis and χ for 2x2 tables.

Results:
The CovidCalculatorUK estimated the probability of Covid-19 in 529 individual medical patients
admitted to three hospitals in the UK (246 patients from site one, 44 from site two and 210 from site
three). The predefined exclusion criteria resulted in the following exclusions: five patients with
positive SARS-CoV2 swab results prior to admission, four patients with insufficient clinical notes and
20 patients without a SARS-CoV2 swab sent to the laboratory. Following these exclusions, 500
patients remained in the completed dataset.
Of the 500 patients, 141 had a positive first SARS-CoV2 swab result, giving a prevalence in this
validation cohort of 28.2%. A further 7 patients (with a negative first SARS-CoV2 swab) had a positive
result on their second SARS-CoV2 swab (using the definition of any positive SARS-CoV2 swab in the
first 10 days of admission gives a study Covid-19 prevalence of 29.6%).

Though the majority of clinicians’ predictions were made by Consultants (220 of 246 predictions,
data regarding seniority of clinician available for site one only), the remaining predictions were made
either by Registrars or SAS doctors. If the clinician predictions are classified as “correct” (i.e. if a
positive SARS-CoV2 swab result was predicted and this later proved true, or a negative SARS-CoV2
result was predicted and this later proved true), then the proportion of “correct” predictions over
the total number of predictions can give an idea of how well the patients were categorised by their
SARS-CoV2 status. Using this measure, Registrars/SAS doctors made “correct” predictions 69.2% of
the time, compared with Consultants, who made “correct” predictions 73.2% of the time - this
slightly improved performance was not statistically significant (p = 0.67 by χ ) when comparing the
number of correct and incorrect predictions between Consultants and Registrars/SAS doctors.
2

Using this same measure, if the CovidCalculator cut-off value of 50% estimated probability of Covid19 was used to categorise patients as predicted positive or negative, then this prediction was
“correct” 74.6% of the time. If the cut-off value of 75% was used, then the prediction was “correct”
78.4% of the time. There was no statistically significant difference in performance for either of these
cut-offs, by this measure, when compared with senior clinicians (p > 0.1 by χ ).
2

Cohorting patients:

The data collected at site one and two recorded the clinicians’ verbal or documented feelings
regarding the probability of Covid-19 in individual patients – this was gathered solely for the purpose
of this study. The actions clinicians took in deciding which “cohort” to place a patient in was also
recorded. There were 289 cohorting actions made at site one and two. 144 patients were cohorted
to Covid-19 areas (i.e. “red” or “amber” areas), 145 were cohorted to non-Covid-19 areas (i.e. a
“green” area). Of the 145 cohorted to a non-Covid-19 area, there were 12 positive first SARS-CoV2
swabs (8.3% of patients). Of the 144 cohorted to a Covid-19 area, there were 41 positive first SARSCoV2 swabs (28.5% of patients). 174 of 289 (60.2%) cohorting decisions were, by this definition,
“correct”. This is a highly simplified model of cohorting and not a balanced representation of the
true clinical picture, which utilised side rooms, barriers within bays and more graded risk
assessments within clinical areas.
Alternative definition for Covid-19 cases - any positive SARS-CoV2 swab in the first 10 days of

admission:

Of the 500 included patients, there were seven cases where the first SARS-CoV2 swab result was
negative and a further swab result in the following 10 days was SARS-CoV2 positive. Re-analysis of

the data presented in the current study with this altered definition had no clinically significant effect
upon the results.

Discussion:
Predicting the diagnosis of Covid-19 in patients presenting to hospital has challenged clinicians
throughout 2020. This prediction, and the cohorting of patients to reduce the transmission of SARSCoV2 in hospitals, is vital. The CovidCalculatorUK resource provides an estimated probability that an
individual patient, assessed on admission, will go on to test positive for SARS-CoV2. The current
study sought to prospectively validate the output of the CovidCalculatorUK resource.
The results of this validation study show that the CovidCalculatorUK estimate of the probability of
Covid-19 in the group that went on to have a first SARS-CoV2 test positive was significantly different
to the group that went on to test negative (mean estimated probability 52.2% vs 20.6% respectively,
p < 0.001). Using a CovidCalculatorUK threshold of greater than 90% estimated probability detected
patients that would later test positive for SARS-CoV2 with a specificity of 0.96 (PPV 0.69). Using a
threshold of greater than 5% estimated probability detected patients that would later test positive
for SARS-CoV2 with a sensitivity of 0.89 (NPV 0.91). The AUC across the range of estimated
probabilities showed reasonable performance, at 0.76 (95% CI 0.71 – 0.81). If binary predictions are
classified as “correct” if a positive SARS-CoV2 swab result was predicted and this later proved true,
or a negative SARS-CoV2 result was predicted and this later proved true, then Consultants made
“correct” decisions 73.2% of the time. The CovidCalculatorUK (at a cut-off of 50% estimated
probability) binary prediction was “correct” 74.6% of the time.
An important added consideration, with Covid-19 diagnostic predictions, is the proportion of
asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV2 infection, estimated to vary between 5% and 80% .
Presence or absence of cough and fever are important inputs into the CovidCalculatorUK - as a result
there is a risk of underestimating the probability of Covid-19 in asymptomatic patients. Indeed, the
sensitivity of the CovidCalculatorUK for the detection of patients that would later test positive for
SARS-CoV2 was lower than expected. Perhaps this is a reflection of the performance of the
calculator itself, or due to the proportion of patients with an asymptomatic or atypical presentation
of Covid-19. Added to the challenge of asymptomatic presentations is the false negative rate from
swabs tested using the RT-PCR method – this was estimated to be 20-40% during the first wave of
Covid-19 (though this does appear to vary greatly depending upon the day of SARS-CoV2 exposure
and the day the SARS-CoV2 swab was collected in the individual in question) . The current study
shows that the “expected” outcomes estimated by the CovidCalculatorUK were generally higher

than the observed outcomes from swab results (as groups: Estimated probability 0-29.9%: 15.7%
positive observed; 30-59.9%: 30.5% positive; 60-100%: 61.9% positive). This result may be explained
by the CovidCalculatorUK producing overestimates, and/or a tendency for SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR swab
tests to under-report true positives.
The current study is not unique, sitting within a sphere of similar prediction tools. However, the use
of the Bayesian method in Covid-19 prediction is believed to be, at the time of writing, unique. The
use of an estimate of regional population prevalence (albeit regional hospital presenter prevalence)
as the starting point for further calculations means this method is well suited to adapt to the
dynamic nature of a pandemic - where population prevalence in a given region can vary by an order
of magnitude in a matter of weeks. This method does have its shortcomings: it is only as accurate as
the data available to it – much of which is, in itself, estimated. The likelihood ratios for the
symptoms and investigations are based upon published data for a population outside of the UK – the
assumption that this data can be directly applied to the UK population may have compromised
accuracy. Though the current study has focused on the diagnosis of Covid-19 in UK hospitals, the
method described here could potentially be applied to any region with a known hospital presenter
Covid-19 prevalence and has potential utility in a range of international settings.
Many tools that aid in predicting the diagnosis of Covid-19 have been made available in 2020, using
a variety of methods and user interfaces. The resource with the greatest similarity to the current
study was produced by Jehi et al. and gives an online open-source estimate, based on a calibrated
nomogram approach from 18 possible data entry inputs . The AUC from the validation cohort in
Jehi et. al was 0.84. This study focused more heavily on screening and testing in lower probability
groups in the community. Increasing in complexity the Soltan et al. artificial intelligence modelling,
using electronic patient records, vital signs, blood gas results and laboratory values (for patients
admitted to hospital, incidentally in the same region of the UK as site one and two of the current
study) yielded an impressive AUC of 0.87 in its validation cohort, a PPV of 0.4 and NPV of 0.98. Many
other diagnostic tests have focused exclusively on radiological findings . The CovidCalculatorUK
does integrate chest radiographic assessment and CT chest assessment – interestingly the former
was almost ubiquitous, whilst the latter was rarely included in the calculations on admission –
perhaps due to the time delay often associated with acquiring computed tomography scans during
the Covid-19 pandemic. Simplicity and rapidly-available estimates are a central feature of the
CovidCalculatorUK – in competition for simplicity of prediction with the current study is the elegant
PARIS score. Tordjman et al. assign zero, one or two points based on cut-off values of the eosinophil,
lymphocyte, neutrophil and basophil counts to assign patients as low, intermediate or high

probability of Covid-19. This method achieved an AUC of 0.89 in their validation cohort – though the
prevalence of Covid-19 in the retrospective validation cohort was 69%, which may elevate the
sensitivity and specificity found during validation. The authors of the current study believe the use of
regional prevalence as the starting point for further calculation in the CovidCalculatorUK generates
more reliable results across a range of population prevalences, as compared to the
nomogram/algorithm-based approaches - where the sensitivity and specificity may vary dramatically
depending upon the population the tool is applied to .
13

There has been an abundance of new diagnostic or prognostic aids during the Covid-19 pandemic .
Set against the need for rapid innovation in the face of a new clinical problem is the need for sound
statistical analysis and the appropriately cautious use of novel unvalidated tools. Though the current
study does describe a novel prediction tool, the method of creating the tool is fully described
(Supplementary file 1) and the reasonably large prospective validation in 500 patients in three
centres seeks to provide sufficient evidence for an external judgement to be made on the utility of
this novel tool.
10

When compared with other published prediction tools, the CovidCalculatorUK does appear to be
less accurate. Balanced against this diminished accuracy is the simplicity, relative paucity of data
required, easy availability and rapidity with which the CovidCalculatorUK can be used. The format of
the output, as an estimated probability expressed as a percentage, has utility for application to
cohorting policy that is flexible to the hospital space/s available and disease prevalence in a local
area. The current study has been purposefully silent on clinical recommendations for cohorting or
setting thresholds where certain actions are recommended - as this will depend upon the number of
cohorting options and facilities available at each site, as well as population factors. The statistically
optimal cohorting strategy is clearly complex. Blanket recommendations are unlikely to have
universal clinical utility. Best practice in this area is centred around the “enhanced traffic care
bundle” – based upon the successful measures used in the SARS outbreak of 2003 . This traffic
care bundle is a more practical organisational approach, with less emphasis on the individual
decisions regarding patient allocation to different zones of the hospital. A core difficulty is in
balancing the sensitivity and specificity of a predictive or diagnostic test for Covid-19. A highly
sensitive, less specific test risks the Covid-19 cohort “red” zone containing SARS-CoV2 negative
patients (and therefore highly susceptible to nosocomial infection), with a relatively safer “green”
zone. By contrast, a highly specific, less sensitive test ensures the “red” zone contains predominantly
Covid-19 patients, though the “green” zone, as a result of the compromised sensitivity (in favour of
specificity) is likely to house SARS-CoV2 positive infectious individuals placing a greater number of

susceptible patients at risk of nosocomial infection. Though the “susceptible-infectious” model is
well established - the optimal statistical strategy to balance these risks and minimise nosocomial
transmission in various hospital spaces is sorely needed during the current Covid-19 pandemic.
25,26

The method used by the CovidCalculatorUK draws on the well-established Bayesian methodology
described by the JAMA rational clinical examination series , building a post-test probability from the
prevalence in the hospital-presenter population and known symptoms/investigations of the disease
in question. This method iterates towards a diagnosis through information sequentially added into
consideration. Though Bayesian theory is not overly welcomed in clinical medicine, many believe
that clinicians naturally formulate their diagnoses, using their clinical experiences, using this same
iterative method and Bayesian inference , even if it is not labelled as such. The current study
demonstrates, for the first time, that it is possible to apply this method, with reasonably accurate
results, to predict the diagnosis of a novel disease in individual patients. This study also
demonstrates the performance of clinicians undertaking the same task. It is interesting to note the
marked similarities between the CovidCalculatorUK and clinician estimates, though these estimates
were generated entirely independently of one another. Their similarity may allude to the common
ground shared between a calculated Bayesian method and clinical decision-making amongst senior
clinicians.
20

27,28

Perhaps the similarity in performance, when compared with senior clinicians, means the
CovidCalculatorUK tool has limited additional clinical utility. In the presence of senior clinicians this
may be true, though the calculator can produce rapidly equivalent results in the absence of senior
clinicians, on a large scale, throughout the day and night or in remote settings – where senior
clinician input may not be readily available. Anecdotally, from both Consultant colleagues and other
healthcare professionals, the calculator has provided a welcome second assessment. It is
noteworthy that in the early phase of the present study, clinicians were asked to estimate the
numerical probability of Covid-19 in individual patients – many had difficulty with this request,
favouring verbal descriptions of probability, such as “very unlikely”. Subjective statements such as
these have been shown to vary greatly in meaning between individuals .
29

Prediction of SARS-CoV2 infection status has wide-reaching impact. Though the current study has
focused on the probability of testing positive and the influence upon cohorting - there are other
practical concerns - including whether relatives/contacts should be advised to self-isolate and
operational considerations, such as oxygen utilisation and hospital/staff resourcing.

The authors hope the need for this work, and the CovidCalculatorUK resource, will diminish as
accurate near-patient tests become available, with possible results in 30-90 minutes . If these tests
perform perfectly, the uncertainty in cohorting will be eliminated and nosocomial transmission
dramatically reduced. However, if concerns remain regarding false negative results in patients felt to
have a high pre-test probability, the uncertainty in cohorting will remain. In such scenarios, the pretest probability remains necessary to place the result of the test in context and facilitate further
decision-making. The CovidCalculatorUK can calculate the influence of a negative or positive SARSCoV2 swab (LR 0.41 and LR 47.5 respectively) on the estimated probability of Covid-19. This feature
was not validated in the current study due to the circularity of incorporating swab results into the
calculation. The SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR swab results, as the current gold standard test, were required as
the independent comparison with the CovidCalculatorUK output.

Conclusion

The present study describes a method for estimating the probability, using readily available
parameters, of an individual patient testing positive for SARS-CoV2 following admission to hospital.
Successfully cohorting patients during the first wave of Covid-19 in the UK has been challenging. The
goal of the present study was to validate the output of the CovidCalculatorUK resource and in doing
so, prepare for further work seeking to mathematically optimise cohorting strategy and minimise the
transmission of SARS-CoV2 within hospitals. The open-source CovidCalculatorUK resource
(covidcalculatoruk.org) performed similarly to senior clinicians’ estimates, both producing
reasonably accurate predictions of which individuals would later test positive for SARS-CoV2. Further
evolution of the calculator will aim to improve performance.
