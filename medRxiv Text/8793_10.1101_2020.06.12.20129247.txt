Abstract
Strategies for monitoring the COVID-19 infection are crucial for combating the pandemic. Here we

4

describe a method for multiplex isothermal amplification-based sequencing and real-time analysis of

5

multiple viral genomes. It can simultaneously detect SARS-CoV-2 and co-infecting respiratory viruses,

6

and monitor mutations for up to 96 samples in real time. The method, termed NIRVANA for Nanopore

7

sequencing of Isothermal Rapid Viral Amplification for Near real-time Analysis, showed high sensitivity

8

and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 in 70 clinical samples. It also simultaneously detected other viral

9

pathogens (e.g. influenza A) in clinical and municipal wastewater samples. It provides a rapid field-

10

deployable solution of COVID-19 and co-infection detection and surveillance of the evolution of

11

pandemic strains.

Introduction

15

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is one of the most serious challenges to public

16

health and global economy in modern history. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense RNA betacoronavirus that

17

causes COVID-19 . It was identified as the pathogenic cause of an outbreak of viral pneumonia of

18

unknown etiology in Wuhan, China, by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) on

19

Jan 7, 2020 . Three days later, the first SARS-CoV-2 genome was released online through a collaborative

20

effort by scientists in universities in China and Australia and Chinese public health agencies (GenBank:

21

MN908947.3) . One week after the publication of the genome the first diagnostic detection of SARS-

22

CoV-2 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was released by a

23

group in Germany .

24
25

To date, rRT-PCR assays of various designs, including one approved by the US Centers for Disease

26

Control and Prevention (US CDC) under emergency use authorization (EUA) , have remained the

27

predominant diagnostic method for SARS-CoV-2. Although proven sensitive and specific for providing a

28

positive or negative answer, rRT-PCR provides little information on the genomic sequence of the virus,

29

knowledge of which is crucial for monitoring how SARS-CoV-2 is evolving and spreading and ensuring

30

successful development of new diagnostic tests and vaccines. To this end, samples need to go through a

31

separate workflow–typically Illumina shotgun metagenomics or targeted next-generation sequencing

32

(NGS) . Because NGS requires complicated molecular biology procedures and high-value instruments in

33

centralized laboratories, it is performed in < 1% as many cases as rRT-PCR, evidenced by the number of

SARS-CoV-2 infections often cause symptoms similar to other respiratory viruses, thus making it

5

challenging to distinguish co-infection especially in the flu season. Several studies have reported co-

6

infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses–respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza

7

being the most common viral pathogens identified

8

patients . The detection of co-infection is potentially useful for monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic

9

and benefiting the treatment of patients. To date, no method can rapidly diagnose multiple viral

7,8

, and influenza was particularly high in dead

9

10

infections in a high-throughput manner. Ideally, such methods should be field-deployable to allow

11

timely assessment of outbreaks anywhere anytime.

12
13

Both rRT-PCR and NGS are sophisticated techniques whose implementation is contingent on the

14

availability of highly-specialized facilities, personnel and reagents. These limitations could translate into

15

long turn-over time and inadequate access to tests even in developed countries. To address these issues,

16

several PCR-free nucleic acid detection assays have been proposed as point-of-care replacements of rRT-

17

PCR. Chief among them is reverse transcription coupled loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-

chance of non-specific amplification and makes it difficult to multiplex. Additionally, LAMP amplicons

Here we developed isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assays to simultaneously

2

amplify multiple regions (up to 2184 bp) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and three respiratory viruses. This

3

forms the basis for an integrated workflow to detect the presence of viral sequences and monitor

4

mutations in multiple regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in up to 96 patients at a time (Fig. 1a). We

5

developed a bioinformatics pipeline for on-the-fly analysis to reduce the time to answer and sequencing

Singleplex RPA was first performed to test its ability to amplify the SARS-CoV-2 genome from a

11

Sixteen primers were tested in 12 combinations to amplify 5 regions harboring either reported signature

13

pairs of primers showed robust amplification of DNA of predicted size (range: 194-466 bp) in a 20-min

14

isothermal reaction at 39 °C (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1a). The specificity of all 5 RPA products was

15

verified by restriction enzyme digestion (Supplementary Fig. 1b). The limit of detection of RPA reaches

16

below 10 copies (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Furthermore, we showed that these RPA reactions could be

17

multiplexed to amplify the five regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in a single reaction (Fig. 1c), thus

18

significantly simplifying the workflow.

20

We next performed multiplex RPA using ten SARS-CoV-2 positive samples (SARS-CoV-2 , determined by

21

US CDC assays , CT value range: 15 to 27.9). Multiplex RPA products of the 10 samples were individually

22

barcoded, pooled and prepared into a Nanopore sequencing library using an optimized protocol to save

23

time. The whole workflow from RNA to sequencing took approximately 4 hours (Fig. 1a). The barcoded

24

library was sequenced on a Nanopore MinION using a R9.4.1 flow cell. After 12-h sequencing, we

25

acquired a total of 1.7 million reads from this barcoded library (Supplementary Fig. 2a). The

26

demultiplexed reads were distributed relatively evenly among the barcodes (samples). We further

27

aligned the reads to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome and found that all RPA amplicons were covered

28

by thousands of reads in all samples, suggesting that barcoded multiplexed RPA sequencing worked

effectively (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 2b).

existence of transcripts of the human housekeeping gene ACTB as a quality check of sample collection.

The sequencing results showed that the ACTB gene could be effectively amplified without significantly

affecting the amplification of SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig. 2c).

RPA primers that robustly amplify influenza A (FluA), human adenovirus (HAdV), and non-SARS-CoV-2

13

human coronavirus (HCoV), respectively (data not shown). We added the three pairs of respiratory virus

14

primers to the multiplex SARS-CoV-2 RPA panel to achieve simultaneous isothermal amplification of four

15

viral pathogens (Supplementary table 1). To ensure effective amplification of all targets, we adjusted the

16

concentration of each primer pair based on the read depth of the cognate genomic region when

17

sequencing a contrived co-infection sample made from a SARS-CoV-2

18

panel of 21 respiratory viruses including FluA, HAdV, and HCoV (Respiratory21 ). The final primer mix

24

population. To evaluate the possibility of using multiplex RPA to detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, we

simultaneous acquisition of viral sequences, this method can also survey the strains circulating in the

2

population (see below).

3
4

We next performed multi-virus multiplex RPA assay followed by Nanopore sequencing in 60 clinical

5

samples suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Following RT and RPA (Fig. 1a), amplicons of each sample

6

were barcoded and sequenced in one Nanopore MinION flow cell. To take advantage of the unique

7

feature of real-time base-calling offered by Nanopore sequencing, we developed a bioinformatics

8

algorithm termed Real-Time Nanopore sequencing monitor (RTNano) (Fig. 1e). RTNano continuously

9

monitors the output folder of basecalled data during the sequencing run and generates analysis reports

10

in a matter of seconds. After detecting new fastq files (basecalled sequence output format of Nanopore

11

sequencing), RTNano quickly aligns the reads to the targeted amplicons of the viruses. To confidently

12

determined the existence of a virus, RTNano filters the alignment records by percentage identity and

13

amplicon coverage and provides the number of positive records for each targeted viral amplicon, which

14

is then used to evaluate the infection status of the sample.

15
16

When demultiplexing a large number of samples, barcode misclassification could potentially happen due

17

to base-calling errors in the barcodes. RTNano includes an additional round of demultiplexing using

18

stringent parameters to reduce the chance of barcode misclassification (see methods). Furthermore, a

19

no template control (NTC) is included to monitor barcode misclassification. The reads of targeted

20

amplicons assigned to the NTC barcode likely represented background errors in demultiplexing. The

21

positive record number of the NTC will be subtracted from individual sample analysis to further reduce

22

false positive identification. After the real-time analysis, RTNano generates a report for each of the 60

23

sample, including current read number, base number, and details of alignment positive records (Fig. 1e).

24

To simplify the interpretation of the result, RTNano provides a summary score of SARS-CoV-2 based on

25

predefined rules (Supplementary table 2). SARS-CoV-2 positive samples (POS) are assigned with

26

different confidence levels based on the number of covered amplicons and corresponding positive

27

records, range from 0 to 3 (lowest to highest). When there is no record of SARS-CoV-2, the sample could

28

be categorized as either negative (NEG) if there are enough records of ACTB; or unknown (UKN) if there

29

are insufficient records of ACTB. The introduction of confidence level can improve the accuracy of

30

diagnosis, which is in principle similar to the CT value of rRT-PCR but based on quantitative information

31

of multiple amplicons. Since base calling and demultiplexing may lead to a brief delay, we refer to the

RTNano has an integrated function to quickly analyze variants in each sample during sequencing. We

used it to analyze sequence variants in ten SARS-CoV-2 positive samples (Fig. 1d). It detected 16 single

21

nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the ten samples and all of them had been reported in GISAID (Fig. 2f, as of

22

June 7, 2020). The reported SNVs suggested that the strains in samples 01-03 are close to clade 19B

(nt14408 C/T, 23403 A/G), first becoming endemic in Europe. Given the fact that samples 01-03 were

25

collected early in the pandemic, while the others were later (around May), the SNV signature of the

26

strains revealed by NIRVANA is consistent with the pattern of COVID-19 case importation, which initially

Taken together, NIRVANA provides high-confidence detection of both SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory

7

viruses, and mutation surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 on the fly. Compared to the Oxford Nanopore’s official

8

method termed LAMPore

9

longer amplicons and higher level of multiplexing. LAMPore generated short amplicons (~80 bp), of

29

, which is based on RT-LAMP, NIRVANA offers several advantages including

10

which half was composed of primer sequences. Thus, the read alignment may be more prone to

11

amplification artifacts that lead to false-positive calling. In NIRVANA, significantly longer amplicons (up

12

to 466 bp in this study) combined with alignment record filter can significantly improve the accuracy of

13

positive result by eliminating the influence of amplification artifacts. In addition, LAMP-based LAMPore

14

requires multiple primers (at least 4) to amplify one amplicon, which was challenging for multiplexing. In

15

contrast, we showed that RPA-based NIRVANA is able to amplify and detect nine amplicons in one pot

the pandemic and the treatment of patients.

19

The whole workflow of NIRVANA can be further shortened by performing one-pot RT-RPA

20

(Supplementary Fig. 1d) so that the time from RNA to answer can be as short as 3.5 hours. All molecular

21

biology reactions in the workflow can be done in a simple heating block, and all necessary supplies fit

22

into a briefcase (Supplementary Fig. 3b). The framework of NIRVANA was built with flexibility of

23

detecting other viruses by changing primers. We expect it to provide a rapid field-deployable solution of

24

pathogen detection and surveillance of pandemic strains.

METHODS

2
3

RNA samples and primers

4
5

Anonymized RNA samples were obtained from Ministry of Health (MOH) hospitals in the western region

6

in Saudi Arabia. The use of clinical samples in this study is approved by the institutional review board

7

(IRB# H-02-K-076-0320-279) of MOH and KAUST Institutional Biosafety and Bioethics Committee (IBEC).

8

Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs were carried out by physicians and samples were steeped in

9

1 mL of TRIzol (Invitrogen Cat. No 15596018) to inactivate virus during transportation. Total RNA

10

extraction of the samples was performed following instructions as described in the CDC EUA-approved

11

protocol using the Direct-Zol RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research Cat. No R2070) or TRIzol reagent

12

(Invitrogen Cat. No 15596026) following the manufacturers’ instructions. The Respiratory (21 targets)

13

control panel (Microbiologics Cat. No 8217) was used as positive control in the amplification of FluA,

14

HAdVs and HCoV. A list of primers used in this study can be found in Supplementary table 1.

15
16

Wastewater samples

17
18

Raw sewage was collected at 9 AM and 4 PM on 7 June 2020 from the wastewater equalization tank in

19

KAUST, and then mixed together to constitute a composite sample. A 300-500 ml of sewage mixture was

20

concentrated by electronegative membrane in the present of cation as previously described

21

eluate of viruses was recovered in a tube with 50 μL of 100 mM H2SO4 (pH 1.0) and 100 μL of 100× Tris–

22

EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) for neutralization. Centripep YM-50 (Merck Millipore) was used to further

23

concentrate the samples to a volume of 600-700 µl.

Reverse transcription

26
27

Reverse transcription of RNA samples was done using either NEB ProtoScript II reverse transcriptase

28

(NEB Cat. No M0368) or Invitrogen SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat. No

29

18090010), following protocols provided by the manufacturers. After reverse transcription, 5 units of

30

thermostable RNase H (New England Biolabs Cat. No M0523S) was added to the reaction, which was

31

incubated at 37 ˚C for 20 min to remove RNA. The final reaction was diluted to be used as templates in

32

RPA. All of the web-lab experiments in this study were conducted in a horizontal flow clean bench to

prevent contaminations. The bench was decontaminated with 70% ethanol, DNAZap (Invitrogen, Cat no.

2

AM9890) and RNase AWAY (Invitrogen, Cat no. 10328011) before and after use. The filtered pipette tips

3

(Eppendorf epT.I.P.S.® LoRetention series) and centrifuge tubes (Eppendorf DNA LoBind Tubes, Cat. No

4

0030108051) used in this study were PCR-clean grade. All of the operations were performed carefully

5

following standard laboratory operating procedures.

rRT-PCR

8
9

The rRT-PCR assay of SARS-CoV-2 was purchased from IDT (Cat. No 10006770). The rRT-PCR assay for

10

FluA was purchase from IDT (Cat. No 1079729). Respiratory Virus PCR Panel kit (Diagenode diagnostics,

11

DDGR-90-L048) was used for the determination of FluA, HAdVs and HCoV. All reactions were run on a

12

CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-rad) following the instruction of manufacturers. The

13

copy number of SARS-CoV-2 is determined by the IDT SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR assay based on the standard

14

curve of CT values of known copies of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 N gene RNA (nt28,287-29,230 in

15

NC_045512.2, DNA template purchased from IDT). A serial dilution of the synthetic RNA is performed to

16

obtain final concentrations of 10, 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10

17

using 1 µl of diluted RNA, followed by rRT-PCR using 2.5 µl of 5-fold diluted cDNA.

Singleplex RPA

20
21

Singleplex RPA was performed using TwistAmp® Basic kit following the standard protocol. Thirteen pairs

22

of SARS-CoV-2 primers covering N gene, S gene, ORF1ab and ORF8 were tested and the corresponding

23

amplicons were purified by 0.8X Beckman Coulter AMPure XP beads (Cat. No A63882) and eluted in 40

24

µl H2O. The purified amplicons were first analyzed by running DNA agarose gel to check the specificity

25

and efficiency. The most robust five pairs of primers with correct size were further analyzed by NlaIII

26

(NEB Cat. No R0125L) and SpeI (NEB Cat. No R0133L) digestion following standard protocols. For one-pot

27

RT-RPA, 10 U of AMV Reverse Transcriptase (NEB Cat no. M0277S) and 20 U of SUPERase•In™ RNase

28

Inhibitor (Invitrogen Cat no. AM2694) were added to a regular RPA reaction mix. The RT-RPA was carried

29

out per the manufacturer protocol. For the RPA of respiratory viruses, reverse-transcribed cDNA from

30

the Respiratory (21 targets) control panel (Microbiologics Cat. No 8217) was used as the template.

Multiplex RPA was done by add all of the primers in the same reaction. The total final primer

3

concentration is set to 2 μM. To achieve an even and robust amplification, we empirically determined

4

the final concentration of the five-amplicon primers (for the initial test of 10 SARS-CoV-2 positive

5

samples) as follows: 0.166 µM for each pair-4 primer, 0.166 µM for each pair-5 primer, 0.242 µM for

6

each pair-9 primer, 0.26 µM for each pair-10 primer, 0.166 µM for each pair-13 primer, 29.5 µl of primer

7

free rehydration buffer, 1 µl of 10-fold diluted cDNA, 7µl H2O. In the multiplex RPA of 9-amplicon and 7-

8

amplicon (remove pair 9 & 10) primers, the primer mixtures were obtained by combining different

9

amount of 10 µM primers according to the ratios in Supplementary table 1, and 2.5 µl of 5-fold diluted

10

cDNA were used as template. The reaction was incubated at 39 ˚C for 4 min, then vortexed and spin

11

down briefly, followed by a 16-min incubation at 39 ˚C.

13

Library preparation and sequencing

14
15

The RPA library preparation was done using Native barcoding expansion kit (Oxford Nanopore

16

Technologies EXP-NBD114 and EXP-NBD196) following Nanopore PCR tiling of COVID-19 Virus protocol

17

(Ver: PTC_9096_v109_revE_06Feb2020) with a few changes to save time. The RPA reaction was purified

18

using Qiagen QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen Cat No. 28106) and elute in 30 µl H2O. The end-prep

19

reaction was done separately in 15 µl volume using 5 µl of each multiplex RPA samples. After that, we

20

followed the same procedures as described in the official protocol. The RT-PCR library preparation was

21

done using Native barcoding expansion kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies EXP-NBD104) according to

22

the standard native barcoding amplicons protocol. The sequencing runs were performed on an Oxford

23

Nanopore MinION sequencer using R9.4.1 flow cells.

Bioinformatics

26
27

RTNano scanned the sequencing folder repeatedly based on user defined interval time. Once newly

28

generated fastq files were detected, it moved the files to the analysis folder and made a new folder for

29

each sample. If the Nanopore demultiplexing tool guppy is provided, RTNano will do additional

30

demultiplexing to make sure reads are correctly classified. The analysis part utilized minimap2

31

quickly align the reads to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (GenBank: NC_045512). After alignment,

32

RTNano will filter the alignment records based on defined thresholds of parentage identity and amplicon

31

to

coverage, followed by counting the alignment records of each amplicon. A read with >= 89% alignment

2

identity and >= 96% amplicon coverage will be counted as one positive record. If an NTC barcode

3

number was provided, RTNano will subtract this number in individual sample analysis to further ensure

4

confident demultiplexing. In the end, RTNano will assign samples with different result marks (POS, NEG

5

and UNK) based on the number of alignment records of each amplicon. With the sequencing continuing,

6

RTNano will merge the newly analyzed result with completed ones to update the current sequencing

7

statistics. RTNano is ultra-fast, a typical analysis with additional guppy demultiplexing of 5 fastq files

8

(containing 4000 reads each and sequenced with 12-barcode kit) will take ~10s using one thread in a

Figure 1. Multiplex RPA workflow for SARS-CoV-2 detection and Nanopore sequencing

2

a, Schematic representation of NIRVANA. RNA samples were subjected to reverse transcription,

3

followed by multiplex RPA to amplify multiple regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The amplicons were

4

purified and prepared to the Nanopore library using an optimized barcoding library preparation protocol.

5

In the end, the sequencing was performed in the pocket-sized Nanopore MinION sequencer and

6

sequencing results were analyzed by our algorithm termed RTNano on the fly.

7

b, The RPA primers used in this study were plotted in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The RPA amplicons are

8

highlighted in red. The corresponding prevalent variants were labeled under the genome.

9

c, Agarose gel electrophoresis results of multiplex RPA. All of the five amplicons were shown in the gel

10

with correct size (asterisks, note that pair 5 and 13 have similar sizes). The no template control (NTC)

11

showed a different pattern of non-specific amplicons. M: molecular size marker.

12

d, IGV plots showing Nanopore sequencing read coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. All samples

13

showed reads covering all of the targeted regions.

14

e, Pipeline of RTNano real-time analysis. RTNano monitors the Nanopore MinION sequencing output

15

folder. Once newly generated fastq files are detected, it moves the files to the analyzing folder and

16

makes a new folder for each sample. If the Nanopore demultiplexing tool guppy is provided, RTNano will

17

do additional demultiplexing to make sure reads are correctly classified. The analysis will align reads to

18

the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome, filter, and count alignment records, and assign result mark (POS,

19

NEG or UNK) for each sample. As sequencing proceeds, RTNano will merge the newly analyzed results

20

with existing ones to update the current sequencing statistics.
