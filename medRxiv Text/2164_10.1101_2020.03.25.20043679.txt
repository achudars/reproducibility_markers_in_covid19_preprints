SUMMARY
The outbreak of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which occurred in Wuhan, China
in December 2019, has caused a worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). However, there is a lack of epidemiological tools to guide effective public
policy development. Here we present epidemiological evidence that SARS-CoV-2 S
type exited Wuhan or other epicenters in China earlier than L type and conferred partial
resistance to the virus on infected populations. Analysis of regional disparities in
incidence has revealed that a sharp decline in influenza epidemics is a useful surrogate
indicator for the undocumented spread of SARS-CoV-2. The biggest concern in the
world is knowing when herd immunity has been achieved and scheduling a time to
regain the living activities of each country. This study provides a useful tool to guide the
development of local policies to contain the virus.

The pandemic of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 1-4 fills the world with fear and
confusion, threatening the collapse of health care and the global financial crisis.
Flattening the epidemic curve to avoid loss of healthcare capacity is a major global
strategy, but has the downside of slowing the achievement of full herd immunity and
sacrificing economic activity. Once the herd immunity is completed, the government
can confidently decide when to lift the restriction. Therefore, the government must
predict trends in the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. There is no waiting in a pandemic and
no time to wait for scientific confirmation. At such times epidemiology exists to
determine public health policy first and foremost. Unfortunately, no government knows
epidemiological methods for predicting their own SARS-CoV-2 status. Here, we
developed the world's first influenza-based epidemiological method as a useful proxy to
detect the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the establishment of partial herd immunity in
countries.

METHODS
SOURCES OF DATA
Epidemiological data were obtained from the Worldometer
(https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/), the COVID Tracking Project
(https://covidtracking.com/data/), and websites operated by Su Wei (https://covid2019.live/), the Infectious Disease Surveillance Center, National Institute of Infectious
Diseases, Japan
(https://nesid4g.mhlw.go.jp/Hasseidoko/Levelmap/flu/2019_2020/trend.html), the
Hokkaido government (http://www.pref.hokkaido.lg.jp/hf/kth/kak/hasseijoukyou.htm),
and the World Health Organization
(https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZTIxMzAwMzYtZWE4NC00YTU2LWE3M

STATISITICAL ANALYSIS
The quantification and modeling of the epidemiological curve was performed under
contract with Shin Nippon Biomedical Laboratories, Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Analyses of
Spearman correlation coefficient were performed with the use of the Statcel4 add-in
package (OMS Publishing, Tokorozawa, Japan) for Microsoft Excel.

RESULTS
A population genetic study of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes has identified two viral
subtypes designate S and L.5 The S type is the ancestral version of the virus. Notably,
only 1 out of 27 (3.7%) viral strains isolated from Wuhan was S type, while 10 out of 31
(32.3%) from other places in China and 18 out of 45 (40.0%) outside the country were S
type. The L type has accumulated more mutations than the S type and the orf1ab
replicase/transcriptase gene of L type has a codon that is more preferred for translation
than S type, suggesting that the L type replicates and/or transmits faster than the S type.
However, it remains to be determined whether the L type is more virulent than the S
type.
We examined whether viral subtypes isolated from countries outside China are
correlated with patterns of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. As shown in Table 1, lower ratio of
isolated S type is associated with delayed spread of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the
epidemic seems to be subsiding in areas where S type virus is predominant. These
results prompted us to hypothesize that (i) S type SARS-CoV-2 exit Wuhan or other
epicenter in China earlier than L type virus without recognition by infectious disease
surveillance systems of China and other countries; (ii) the infection by S type induced
herd immunity that provides at least partial protection against spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Clonal competition between L and S subtypes should have taken place in Wuhan and it
is likely that the L type took over the S type because of higher replicative potential
and/or faster transmission. Asymptomatic ratio of Japanese nationals evacuated from
Wuhan, who are more likely to be infected by the L type, is 30.8% (95% confidence
interval: 7.7-53.8%).6 In contrast, 51.4% (318/619) of RT-PCR confirmed cases among
passengers in the cruise ship Diamond Princess, an outbreak traced to a Hong Kong

passenger who is most likely to have S type virus, were asymptomatic
(https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/en/2019-ncov-e/9417-covid-dp-fe-02.html). Although the
subtypes of the virus remain to be clarified, the higher asymptomatic ratio among cruise
ship passengers supports the view that infection by S type is more likely to be
asymptomatic than that by L type and easier to avoid recognition by surveillance
systems.
Medical doctors in Japan have noticed that influenza epidemic suddenly faded
this winter season. Type I interferons induced by S type SARS-CoV-2 may interfere
with infection by influenza virus. We therefore performed regional disparity studies
comparing influenza warning reports from prefectures in Japan with current positive
rate of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Only 15 prefectures were selected where more than
400 samples were examined because positive rates in other prefectures show Poisson
distribution and are not reliable as an indicator of incidence. As shown in Fig. 1, the
presence of sharp declines in influenza warning reports correlated with lower incidence
of SARS-CoV-2 infection. From early November 2019 to 23 January 2020, about
1,840,000 tourists from China entered Japan, suggesting that unrecognized spread of S
type SARS-CoV-2 interfered with influenza epidemic. Interestingly, the timing of
decline suggests that S type SARS-CoV-2 spread from 23 December 2019 in Tokyo,
Kanagawa, Saitama, and Hiroshima; from 20 January 2020 in Fukuoka and Niigata;
from 27 January in Kyoto, Shizuoka, and Ibaraki; and from 2 February in Wakayama.
No outbreak has been recognized in Japan before February 2020 and the Chinese
government implemented blockades in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province on 23
January 2020, suggesting that only S form entered those prefectures.
The maximum number of infected cases in Japan has been reported in

Hokkaido. Fig. 1 suggests that Hokkaido was not or incompletely exposed to S type and
the current epidemic is due to the L type. Mathematical modeling has shown that
undocumented infections of SARS-CoV-2 were the infection source for most
documented cases.7 Because children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic8 or
mildly symptomatic,4 we surmise that children are major sources of SARS-CoV-2
spread. Hokkaido is divided into several General Promotion Bureau jurisdictions.
Incidents of influenza-like illness in kindergartens reported from health centers in the
jurisdictions were compared with current prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. As shown in Fig.
2, strong negative correlation was observed (Spearman correlation coefficient ρ= -0.73),
suggesting that undocumented infection SARS-CoV-2 in Hokkaido suppressed
influenza-like illness among small children. Influenza-like illnesses among older
children did not reflect the epidemic (ρ= -0.14 in elementary school, 0.07 in junior high
school, and -0.04 in high school), possibly because influenza-like symptoms of COVID19 in these age groups4 confounded the analyses.
Europe has become the center of the pandemic. But why mortality rates vary
from country to country remains enigmatic. We arranged influenza epidemic curves of
European countries in descending order of COVID-19 mortality (Supplementary Figs. 1
and 2). There seems to be a pattern in the curve related to COVID-19 case fatality rates
(CFR). Depending on the likelihood of S-type SRS-CoV-2 transmission, a scoring
system was developed to model the mortality-related curve patterns. As shown in Fig. 3,
this score correlates with the SARS-CoV-2 CFR in each country, implying that the
extent of S type SARS-CoV-2 transmission determines the severity of the current
infection. This scoring system is useful as a country-specific COVID-19 severity risk
score. As shown in Fig. 4, the risk score reveals geographic effects on the spread of the

DISCUSSION
Our epidemiological analyses provided evidence for herd immunity against the S type
SARS-CoV-2 that exited Wuhan or other epicenter in China earlier than the L type.
Undocumented spread of SARS-CoV-2 can be monitored through influenza surveillance
systems based on viral competition. The findings have led to the development of an
epidemiological tool that predicts severity of COVID-19 in each region and its
application in Europe.
Because the L type is likely to transmit faster than the S type, the basic
reproduction number of the L type (R0L) is expected to be higher than the S type (R0S).
When herd immunity to the S type is established,, the proportion of the population with
immunity (pS) is 1 - 1/R0S.9 If R0L = 2.2 and R0 S = 2.17, which are plausible values,10 pL
= 1 - 1/R0 L = 0.55 (55%) of the population will be infected when a non-immune
population is exposed to the L type. When a population with herd immunity to the S
type is exposed to the L type, pL - pS = 1/R0S – 1/ R0L = 0.006 (0.6%) will be infected,
consistent with the positive rates of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in some Japan prefectures
(Fig, 1). If 80% of a population is exposed to the S type and then the whole population
is exposed to the L type, pL – 0.8 x pS = 1 - 1/R0L – 0.8 (1 - 1/ R0L) = 0.114 (11.4%) is
infected, consistent with the positive rates observed in Aichi and Hokkaido in Japan
(Fig. 1). Thus, the spread of S type before the L type confers partial herd immunity to
the L type.
Until March 9, 2020, the Japanese government did not restrict entry of tourists
from areas of China outside Hubei Province which might have unintentionally allowed
selective influx of S form to Japan. S type influx into Ireland and the Balkans may be
due to travel restrictions in those countries restricted to infected individuals. In contrast

to other areas in Japan, epidemic is ongoing in Nagoya City in Aichi prefecture and
Sapporo City in Hokkaido, where the spread of the S form may have been incomplete as
discussed above. In the United States of America and most European countries, travel
from across China was restricted from the beginning of February, blocking the inflow of
the S form from China. There is deep concern that serious outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in
the United States and Europe may have been caused by the spread of the L form
preceding the S form, by which up to 55% of the population may be infected as
calculate above.
Although traditional public health outbreak response tactics implemented in
China have been shown to be effective,7 they incur massive costs such as economic
losses.11 Conversely, herd immunity policy will face substantial mortality among high
risk population.12,13 We propose that a policy that expects herd immunity are dangerous
in the areas indicated in brown, red, and magenta in Fig. 4. In areas marked in yellow,
policies that balance social closure and population immunity are desirable. In the areas
marked in green, in contrast, no social isolation may be required except for individuals
over 60 and at high risk, such as those with diabetes, coronary heart disease, high blood
pressure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, and
cancer.12,13 Thus, with the use of the new epidemiological tool, governments may be
able to predict SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality in their countries and use them in
public health policies. Applying this scoring system to small geographies should allow
for finer-grained policy creation.
Quantitative analysis for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG antibodies in the
blood of healthy persons may reveal herd immunity against S type SARS-CoV-2. Such
seroepidemiological data will predict the effectiveness and risk of herd immunity

policies. Detection of "S type SARS-CoV-2 herd immunity" might also help schedule a
timing to lift travel restrictions, event restraints, closure of schools, social distancing,
and contact precautions. However, collection of sera and analyses require significant
logistic effort, time, and cost,6 which developing countries may not be able to cover.
Moreover, to determine the normal range of the test, the test values in unaffected
individuals must be determined. For diseases with many subclinical infections, such as
SARS-CoV-2, it may be difficult to determine the cutoff value,9 especially if the
subclinical infection is prevalent in the majority of the population. Meanwhile, quick
epidemiological tools should be useful for policy making that balances herd immunity
approaches with containment policies. The approach used in this study will lay the
foundation for further developing epidemiological tools to support political decisions on
infection control.
