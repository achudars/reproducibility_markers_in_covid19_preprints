Abstract

：Since December 2019, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2（SARS-CoV-2）-infected disease (Coronavirus Disease 2019，COVID-19) emerged
in Wuhan , China，and rapidly spread throughout China，even throughout the world.

Background

We try to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in
non-Wuhan area

：

，and explore its effective treatment.

Methods Retrospective, single-center case series of the 51 hospitalized patients with
confirmed COVID-19 at Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital in Chongqing,

；

China, from January 20 to February 3, 2020 The discharge time was from January 29
to February 11, 2020. The main results and indicators of epidemiology, demography,
clinical manifestation, laboratory examination, imaging data and treatment data of 51
patients with covid-19 were collected and analyzed. The changes of blood routine and
biochemical indexes at discharge and admission were compared. Compare the clinical
characteristics of severe patients (including severe and critical patients) and nonsevere patients (general patients).

： Of 51 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 45 years
(interquartile range, 34-51; range, 16-68 years) and 32 (62.7%) were men.43（84.3%）
patients had been to Wuhan or Other Hubei areas outside Wuhan，and 4（7.7%）

COVID-19.Common symptoms included fever (43 [84.3%]), cough (38 [74.5%]) and
fatigue (22 [43.1%]). Lymphopenia was observed in 26 patients (51.0%), and elevated
C-reactive protein level in 32 patients (62.7%). Ground-glass opacity was the typical

radiological finding on chest computed tomography (41 [80.4%]) Local consolidation
of pneumonia in some patients(17 [33.3%]).Most of the patients were treated with
traditional Chinese medicine decoction (28 [54.9%])

，all of them received aerosol

inhalation of recombinant human interferon a-1b for injection and oral antiviral
therapy with Lopinavir and Ritonavir tablets (51 [100%]); Most of the patients were
given Bacillus licheniformis capsules regulated intestinal flora treatment (44 [86.3%]).
10 patients (19.6%) received short-term (3-5 days) glucocorticoid treatment.
Compared with non-severe patients (n = 44), severe patients (n = 7) were older
(median age, 52 years vs 44 years), had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (4
[57.1%] vs 0 [0.0%]), most of them needed antibiotic treatment (7 [100%] vs 4 [9.1%],
most of them needed nutritional diet (6 [85.7%) vs 0 [0.0%], and were more likely to

have dyspnea (6 [85.7%] vs 5 [11.4%]) most of them needed noninvasive mechanical
ventilation (6 [85.7%] vs 0 [0.0%]). Except one patient died, the remaining 50
patients were discharged according to the discharge standard, the common clinical
symptoms disappeared basically, the lymphocyte increased significantly (P=0.008),
CRP decreased significantly (P <0.001). The median length of stay was 12 days (IQR,
9-13).

：In 51 single center cases confirmed as COVID-19 and discharged from

Conclusion

the hospital, 13.7% of the patients were severe. The main clinical symptoms of

，

patients with COVID-19 were fever, cough and asthenia Some patients had obvious
dyspnea. They had clinical laboratory and radiologic characteristics. There is no
specific drug treatment for the disease. For the treatment of COVID-19, in addition to
oxygen inhalation and antiviral treatment, attention should be paid to the dialectical
treatment of traditional Chinese medicine, regulation of intestinal flora, nutritional
support treatment and other comprehensive treatment.

Key words: COVID-19

；Severe

Introduction
In December 2019, a group of acute respiratory diseases with unknown causes[1],

（

now known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID-19

（

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2

）, caused by Severe acute

）[2-4],occurred in Wuhan, Hubei

Province, China. The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was declared a Public

（

）

Health Emergency of International Concern PHEIC by the world health organization
on January 30, 2020[5],.The disease has spread rapidly from Wuhan to all over China

，

and other countries [5-9 ].In China(excluding Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) As of
24:00 on February 14, 2020, 66492 confirmed cases have been reported, 8096
discharged cases have been cured and 1523 deaths have been reported [10].

，

Despite the rapid spread worldwide the clinical characteristics of COVID-19
remain largely unclear. Recently, a series of studies have reported the epidemiological
and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19[1

、

，11-14].In three recent

studies documenting the clinical manifestations of 41 99and138 patients respectively
with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Wuhan, the severity of
some cases with COVID-19 mimicked that of severe acute respiratory syndrome

，11-12].Recently, a large sample study recorded data of
confirmed cases, According to the researchers [13] ； The

coronavirus (SARS-Cov) [[1
1099 laboratory

SARS-CoV-2 epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. The
disease

severity(including

oxygen

saturation,

respiratory

rate,

blood

leukocyte/lymphocyte count and chest X-ray/CT manifestations) predict poor clinical

，

outcomes. Another large sample study suggests[14] Compared with SARS-CoV,
2019-nCoV had comparable transmissibility and lower case fatality rates (CFR).

Their findings based on individual-level surveillance data emphasize the importance
of early detection of elderly patients, particularly males, before symptoms progress to
severe pneumonia.
At present, many studies are aimed at the patients with COVID-19 in or
including Wuhan area, Hubei Province. We know that [13-14], the medical resources
in Wuhan area are in short supply in the early stage, and it may take a long time from
the onset of the patients to the diagnosis, and the patients admitted to the hospital in
the early stage tend to be in a serious condition. As of 24:00 on February 14, 2020, the
mortality rate in Wuhan area is 2.96% (The mortality rate was calculated by the
cumulative number of deaths / the number of confirmed cases involved)

，

Significantly higher than 1.40% in non Wuhan areas of China (excluding Hong Kong,
Macao and Taiwan) and 0.55% in non Hubei areas of China (excluding Hong Kong,
Macao and Taiwan)[10].
At present, there is no effective treatment or vaccine for COVID-19.Therefore, it
is necessary to explore the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19
patients hospitalized in non-hubei areas.
The Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital is one of the four designated
hospitals in Chongqing for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, mainly for the
treatment of COVID-19 patients in the northeast of Chongqing. As of 24:00 on
February 14, a total of 537 confirmed cases and 5 deaths have been reported in
Chongqing [15].As of February 11, 2020, Chongqing University Three Gorges
Hospital has involved 50 cases of cured discharge and 1 case of death. Here, by
collecting the data of 51 laboratory confirmed cases, we try to provide a description of
the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Chongqing,
and explore the changes of clinical characteristics of patients during hospitalization.
Data and Methods
Case data
51 patients were admitted to the Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital
from January 20, 2020 to February 3, 2020. All of them were confirmed cases. The

Methods
Data sources
This case series was approved by the institutional ethics board of Chongqing
University Three Gorges Hospital. All patients diagnosed as COVID-19 in the
Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital, who had been discharged by February

，

11, 2020, were included in the study. Oral consent was obtained from patients Written
informed consent was waived in light of the urgent need to collect clinical data. All
COVID-19 patients were diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim
guidance[16] and

》[17]. Laboratory confirmation of the SARS-CoV-2 was achieved

through the Chongqing Wanzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Data Collection
The internal medicine research group of the Chongqing University Three Gorges
Hospital analyzed the patient's medical records. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory
and radiologic characteristics, as well as treatment and outcome data are obtained
through electronic medical records. The data were collected and reviewed by a team
of trained doctors. The recorded information includes demographic data, medical
history, exposure history, potential comorbidities, symptoms, physical signs,
laboratory test results (including blood cell analysis, liver and kidney function,
coagulation test, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine
kinase

，Interleukin 6 and urine routine, etc.), chest computed tomography (CT) and

treatment measures (i.e. antiviral treatment, corticosteroid treatment, respiratory
support, traditional Chinese medicine treatment, nutritional support, etc.). The onset
date is defined as the date when the symptom first appears. The severity of
COVID-19 was classified according to World Health Organization interim

《Diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia (trial

according to the Berlin definition[18]. The durations from onset of disease to
diagnosis

，diagnosis to discharge were recorded

.

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as the medians and interquartile ranges
(IQR) as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized as the counts and
percentages in each category. Means for continuous variables were compared using
independent group t tests when the data were normally distributed; otherwise, the
Mann-Whitney test was used. Proportions for categorical variables were compared
using the χ 2test, although the Fisher exact test was used when the data were limited.
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences) version 19.0 software (SPSS Inc). For unadjusted comparisons, a 2-sided α
of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The analyses have not been
adjusted for multiple comparisons and, given the potential for type I error, the
findings should be interpreted as exploratory and descriptive.
Results
General baseline data
The median age of 51 inpatients with COVID-19 was 45 years (interquartile
range, 34-51; range, 16-68 years) , including 32 males (62.7%) and 19 females
(37.3%); There were 8 cases (15.7%) with comorbidities, 4 cases (7.8%) with diabetes,
4 cases (7.8%) with hypertension, 1 case (2.0%) with diabetes and hypertension, 1

On the first day of admission (n = 51), the laboratory test results (leukocyte
count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, platelet, creatine kinase,
lactate dehydrogenase, glutamic pyruvate transaminase, glutamic oxaloacetylase,
albumin, creatinine, urea nitrogen, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, interleukin-6) are
shown in Table 2. There are many differences in laboratory test results between severe
patients and non-severe patients (Table 2), including the significant decrease of
lymphocyte count, the decrease of serum albumin level, and the significant increase of
LDH, CRP, D-dimer and PCT levels.

The results of laboratory test results of patients on the first day of admission (n =
50) and before discharge (n = 50) are compared (Table 3). We found that lymphocyte

（L）, PLT, CK, LDH and CRP of patients before discharge were significantly
increased, while CK, LDH and CRP were significantly reduced (Table 3).
Imaging examination
51 cases of chest CT were abnormal at the time of admission. During the course
of the disease, chest CT mostly showed multiple patchy, flocculent fuzzy shadows,
ground glass shadows or high-density shadows, some of which were consolidation;
There were 41 cases of typical ground glass shadow (80.4%), 17 cases of local
consolidation of pneumonia (33.3%), 20 cases of pleural thickening (39.2%), 7 cases
of small amount of pleural effusion (13.7%), 8 cases of streak shadow of lung

Clinical outcomes
Except one patient died, the remaining 50 patients were discharged according to
the discharge standard, the common clinical symptoms disappeared basically, the
lymphocyte increased significantly (P =0.008), CRP decreased significantly (P
<0.001). The median length of stay was 12 days (IQR, 9-13).
Discussion
This study is a series of patients who have been discharged from non-Wuhan
area. As of February 11, 2020, a total of 51 patients were discharged from the single
center of the Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital, of which 50 were cured
and discharged, and 1 critically Patients was died. Among the 51 patients in this study,
the median number of days from onset to Confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 was 6
days (IQR, 3-8 days); among the 50 patients who were discharged alive, the Average
hospitalization day was 12 days (IQR , 9-13 days).
Most patients had visited Wuhan or other Hubei areas or had close contact with
COVID-19 patients within 14 days before the onset of the disease, but 4 cases had no
clear epidemiological history of COVID-19 patients, which indicates that there may
be active SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The rapid spread of close contact between
people is an important feature of COVID-19 [12], which requires close monitoring to
prevent further large-scale spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. The 51 infected people
were mainly young adults, mostly imported cases, which may be related to large-scale
population migration during the Chinese New Year.
The more common clinical symptoms in this group of cases are: fever 43

（84.3%）, cough 38（74.5%）and fatigue 22 (43.1%). However, a small proportion of
patients initially did not feel obvious fever, atypical Symptoms, such as diarrhea and
nausea and retching, are similar to Professor Zhong Nanshan's

On the first day of admission, the decrease of lymphocyte count was more

range; most patients (32 [62.7%]) had an increase of CRP; some patients had an
increase of LDH (20 [39.2%]), D-dimer (10 [19.6%]), IL-6 (16 [31.4%]) and PCT (25
[49%]); and urine routine urine protein was positive in 8 cases. Compared with the
non-severe patients, the lymphocyte count decreased more significantly in the severe
patients, the serum albumin level was lower, and the LDH, CRP, D-dimer and PCT
levels were significantly higher. Compared with the results of various laboratory
indexes of patients on the first day of admission (N=50) and before discharge (N=50),
we found that the lymphocyte and PLT of patients before discharge increased
significantly, while CK, LDH and CRP decreased significantly.
Therefore, we speculate that a decrease in lymphocyte count and an increase in
CRP are an important feature of COVID-19. Compared with non-severe patients,
severe patients have a lower lymphocyte count and an increase in CRP. The
lymphocyte count was significantly increased and CRP was significantly decreased
before discharge of the 50 surviving patients

，which suggested that the decrease of

absolute lymphocyte count and the increase of CRP might be related to the severity of
the disease. Therefore, dynamic observation of lymphocyte count and CRP level may
be of great significance to the change of the disease and prognosis of the patients,
which needs further study and confirmation.
51 cases of chest CT were abnormal at the time of admission. During the course
of the disease, chest CT mostly showed multiple patchy, flocculent fuzzy shadows,
ground glass shadows or high-density shadows, some of which were consolidation;

；

most of them had typical ground glass Shadows (41 cases [80.4%]) In severe patients
(n = 7), most of them had pleural thickening (6 [85.7%]) and a small amount of
pleural effusion (6 [85.7%]), while non-severe patients

，the proportion is smaller (14

[31.8%], 1 [2.3%]). This suggests that in the course of COVID-19 clinical treatment,
if chest CT indicates a small amount of pleural effusion with pleural thickening, the
patient may be in a serious condition, which needs to be paid attention to and actively
treated.
The common clinical symptoms of 50 living patients basically disappeared at the

time of discharge, but the chest CT lesions still existed. The lesions increased in 1(2%)
case, no significant change in 4 (8%)cases, and decreased in 45 (90%)cases. This
suggests that the imaging manifestations of chest may not be parallel to the clinical
symptoms. Lung lesions still exist after the negative detection of SARS-CoV-2
nucleic acid test. Further follow-up is needed.

，antibacterials and
antiviral drugs had no definite effect on SARS and MERS. In a recent study[12]，all
Previous studies on SARS and MERS [19] showed that

of the patients with COVID-19 received antibacterial agents, 90% received antiviral
therapy, and 45% received methylprednisolone. However, no effective outcomes were
observed.There is no clear evidence that patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection will
benefit from hormone therapy and are more likely to face the risks of hormone
therapy. Glucocorticoid is not recommended for the treatment of COVID-19[20].
Therefore, traditional Chinese medicine

（TCM）treatment may be a useful

choice. Although Western medicine is currently used in many Eastern countries as a
mainstream medicine, Chinese medicine also plays an important role against various
diseases. As we know, to reach a conclusion regarding the effectiveness of Chinese
medicine in any specific disease, controlled clinical trials are needed. Moreover, for a
devastating epidemic outbreak like SARS, only retrospective study reports can be
found [21]. Chinese medicine may also have a role in the prevention of acute and
critical diseases like the SARS virus. Chinese medicine was used as adjuvant therapy

（

in the SARS patients. It seems that the combined treatment Chinese herbs combined

）

with western medicine was helpful for SARS patients. Chinese herbs combined with
Western medicines made no difference in decreasing mortality versus Western
medicines alone. It is possible that Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines
may improve symptoms, quality of life and absorption of pulmonary infiltration, and
decrease the corticosteroid dosage for SARS patients [22].
Among the 51 patients in this study, Except for routine administration of
recombinant human interferon a-1b for injection nebulized inhalation, oral antiviral

therapy with lopinavir or ritonavir tablets (51 [100%]), According to their clinical
manifestations and TCM syndromes, most patients were given antiviral therapy with
Chinese medicine decoction (28 [54.9%]), and achieved good clinical effects. But just
like above-mentioned, to reach a conclusion regarding the effectiveness of Chinese
medicine in COVID-19,controlled clinical trials are needed.
Compared with non-severe patients (n = 44), severe patients (n = 7) were older
(median age, 52 years vs 44 years), with a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (4

；

[57.1%] vs 0 [0.0%]) This suggests that age and comorbid diabetes may be an
important factor affecting the patient's condition and prognosis, which was also
confirmed by Wei J's study [12]. In this study, only one critically ill patient (dead
patient) needs invasive mechanical ventilation, which is lower than previous studies in
Wuhan [1, 12]. Due to the shortage of early medical resources in Wuhan [13, 14], this
may be related to the serious condition of inpatients in Wuhan.
This study has several limitations. First, the sample size is small, especially in
severe patients. Second, the majority of discharged patients are non-severe patients.
Severe and critically ill patients often have more complications and may require
longer hospital stays. Most are still in hospital. Third, there are four COVID-19
treatment centers in Chongqing, and there is still no relevant comparative analysis.
Conclusions
In the case analysis of 51 discharged patients of COVID-19 in the single center
of Northeast Chongqing, most of the infected patients were young and middle-aged,
and most of them were imported cases. Most cases have typical symptoms such as
fever and cough, and a few cases have atypical symptoms such as diarrhea. The
changes of CRP and other inflammatory indexes may be related to the severity of the
disease. Traditional Chinese medicine provides an alternative for the treatment of
COVID-19.
