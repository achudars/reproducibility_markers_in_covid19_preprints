COVID-19 collateral: Indirect acute effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical and mental health in the UK
Mansfield, Mathur, Tazare, Henderson, Mulick, et al.

ABSTRACT [300 words]
Background: Concerns have been raised that the response to the UK COVID-19 pandemic may have worsened
physical and mental health, and reduced use of health services. However, the scale of the problem is
unquantified, impeding development of effective mitigations. We asked what has happened to general
practice contacts for acute physical and mental health outcomes during the pandemic?
Methods: Using electronic health records from the Clinical Research Practice Datalink (CPRD) Aurum (20172020), we calculated weekly primary care contacts for selected acute physical and mental health conditions
(including: anxiety, depression, acute alcohol-related events, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease [COPD] exacerbations, cardiovascular and diabetic emergencies). We used interrupted time series
(ITS) analysis to formally quantify changes in conditions after the introduction of population-wide restrictions
(‘lockdown’) compared to the period prior to their introduction in March 2020.
Findings: The overall population included 9,863,903 individuals on 1st January 2017. Primary care contacts for
all conditions dropped dramatically after introduction of population-wide restrictions. By July 2020, except for
unstable angina and acute alcohol-related events, contacts for all conditions had not recovered to prelockdown levels. The largest reductions were for contacts for: diabetic emergencies (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.250.50), depression (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.52-0.53), and self-harm (OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.54-0.58).
Interpretation: There were substantial reductions in primary care contacts for acute physical and mental
conditions with restrictions, with limited recovery by July 2020. It is likely that much of the deficit in care
represents unmet need, with implications for subsequent morbidity and premature mortality. The conditions
we studied are sufficiently severe that any unmet need will have substantial ramifications for the people
experiencing the conditions and healthcare provision. Maintaining access must be a key priority in future
public health planning (including further restrictions).

RESULTS IN CONTEXT
Evidence before this study
A small study in 47 GP practices in a largely deprived, urban area of the UK (Salford) reported that primary
care consultations for four broad diagnostic groups (circulatory disease, common mental health problems,
type 2 diabetes mellitus and malignant cancer) declined by 16-50% between March and May 2020, compared
to what was expected based on data from January 2010 to March 2020. We searched Medline for other
relevant evidence of the indirect effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical and mental health from
inception to September 25th 2020, for articles published in English, with titles including the search terms
(“covid*” or “coronavirus” or “sars-cov-2”), and title or abstracts including the search terms (“indirect impact”
or “missed diagnos*” or “missing diagnos*” or “delayed diagnos*” or ((“present*” or “consult*” or “engag*”
or “access*”) AND (“reduction” or “decrease” or “decline”)). We found no further studies investigating the
change in primary care contacts for specific physical- and mental-health conditions indirectly resulting from
the COVID-19 pandemic or its control measures. There has been a reduction in hospital admissions and
presentations to accident and emergency departments in the UK, particularly for myocardial infarctions and
cerebrovascular accidents. However, there is no published evidence specifically investigating the changes in
primary care contacts for severe acute physical and mental health conditions.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge this is the first study to explore changes in healthcare contacts for acute physical and
mental health conditions in a large population representative of the UK. We used electronic primary care
health records of nearly 10 million individuals across the UK to investigate the indirect impact of COVID-19 on
primary care contacts for mental health, acute alcohol-related events, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) exacerbations, and cardiovascular and diabetic emergencies up to July 2020. For all conditions
studied, we found primary care contacts dropped dramatically following the introduction of population-wide
restriction measures in March 2020. By July 2020, with the exception of unstable angina and acute alcoholrelated events, primary care contacts for all conditions studied had not recovered to pre-lockdown levels. In
the general population, estimates of the absolute reduction in the number of primary care contacts up to July
2020, compared to what we would expect from previous years varied from fewer than 10 contacts per million
for some cardiovascular outcomes, to 12,800 per million for depression and 6,600 for anxiety. In people with
COPD, we estimated there were 43,900 per million fewer contacts for COPD exacerbations up to July 2020
than what we would expect from previous years.
Implicatins of all the available evidence
While our results may represent some genuine reduction in disease frequency (e.g. the restriction measures
may have improved diabetic glycaemic control due to more regular daily routines at home), it is more likely
the reduced primary care conatcts we saw represent a substantial burden of unmet need (particularly for
mental health conditions) that may be reflected in subsequent increased mortality and morbidity. Health
service providers should take steps to prepare for increased demand in the coming months and years due to
the short and longterm ramifications of reduced access to care for severe acute physical and mental health
conditions. Maintaining access to primary care is key to future public health planning in relation to the
pandemic.

COVID-19 collateral: Indirect acute effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical and mental health in the UK
Mansfield, Mathur, Tazare, Henderson, Mulick, et al.

INTRODUCTION
By October 2020, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been diagnosed in more than 40 million
individuals, with over one million deaths reported worldwide.1 Much research and public health attention has,
understandably, focused on preventing infections and reducing mortality. However, there are concerning
reports of decreased health service use.2–5 Inevitably, there will be impacts on non-COVID-19-related
healthcare provision; healthcare resources have been reallocated to the COVID-19 response and care delivery
has been modified due to mitigation measures including social distancing.6–11 Additionally, individuals may
have delayed seeking care (due to fear of infection, or to avoid burdening health services). Psychological
health will have been affected by pandemic-related fears, employment and financial concerns, and control
measures (including social distancing, closures of social spaces and isolation),12,13 and lockdown measures are
likely to have reduced access to mental health care (face-to-face visits and talking therapies). Understanding
the indirect effects of the pandemic and its control measures is essential for public health planning,
particularly when/if the COVID-19 pandemic is under control (or if further restrictions are needed), and for
informing control measures for future pandemics.
Reports indicate that accident and emergency department attendance and hospital admissions for nonCOVID-related acute concerns in the UK have declined since March 2020.2–4 However, it is not yet clear what
has happened in primary care across the UK where clinical work has changed rapidly to include more remote
consultations,14–17 although a regional report indicates reduced primary care consultations.18
We asked how primary care contacts (including face-to-face or remote consultations, and recording of
diagnoses from hospital discharge summaries) have changed for selected indirect acute physical and mental
health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, to inform decisions on policy responses and resource allocation.
Although a wide range of diagnoses could be indirectly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, we focused on
specific acute conditions that could plausibly be affected including: mental health conditions, acute alcoholrelated events, cardiovascular and diabetic emergencies, and asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) exacerbations. We specifically selected diabetic and cardiovascular emergencies (including
myocardial infarction, unstable angina), and asthma/COPD exacerbations, as affected individuals are likely to
be considered vulnerable (and asked to ‘shield’, i.e. advice for the vulnerable to avoid unnecessary contacts,
to avoid infection),19 creating a barrier to accessing healthcare resources.

METHODS
We used routinely collected primary care data from electronic health records from general practices
contributing to Clinical Research Practice Datalink (CPRD) Aurum database (August 2020 build) in the three
years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and four months after introducing population-wide restrictions (i.e.
‘lockdown’) on 23rd March 2020 (1st January 2017- 12th July 2020).20 Code lists for defining all outcomes and
stratifying variables, and analytic code are available (https://github.com/johntaz/COVID-Collateral).

Data source
CPRD Aurum includes de-identified routinely collected primary care health record data from participating
general practices covering 13% of the UK population, and is broadly representative of the English population
with respect to age, sex, ethnicity, and geographic region.20

Study population
Our overall study population included individuals with at least one year of registration with practices
contributing to CPRD Aurum (January 2017-July 2020). Included populations (i.e. denominators) varied
depending on the condition being investigated (Table 1, Figure S1). For example, for diabetic emergencies the
study population (denominator) only included individuals (aged ≥11 years) with an existing diabetes mellitus
diagnosis, while for depression, the study included all individuals from the overall study population aged 5
years and older.
We followed all individuals from the latest of: study start (1st January 2017), one year from GP registration or,
for diabetes and respiratory conditions, from meeting our definitions for having diabetes or respiratory
disease, as appropriate (Table 1). Follow-up ended for all study populations at the earliest of: end of
registration with GP, death, practice stopped contributing to CPRD, or end of the study period.

Exposures, outcomes and stratifying variables
Our exposure was the introduction of population-wide COVID-19 restrictions (i.e. ‘lockdown’ on 23rd March
2020). As outcomes, we considered the number of weekly primary care contacts for the following conditions
(separately): mental health (i.e. depression, anxiety, fatal and non-fatal self-harm, severe mental illness, and
eating and obsessive-compulsive disorders), acute alcohol-related events, diabetic emergencies (e.g.
ketoacidosis), asthma and COPD exacerbations, and acute cardiovascular (CVD) events (i.e. unstable angina,
myocardial infarction, transient ischaemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, cardiac failure and venous
thromboembolisms). We used the term ‘contact’ broadly to represent remote and face-to-face consultations,
diagnoses from hospital discharge letters, and secondary care referrals. We identified conditions using
primary care records for diagnoses, symptoms and/or prescribing (Table 1). All outcomes, except
asthma/COPD exacerbations, were captured based on presence/absence of specific morbidity codes.
Asthma/COPD exacerbations were based on validated algorithms requiring a combination of specific
morbidity codes and prescriptions for corticosteroids or, for COPD additionally antibiotics.21,22 For some
conditions we defined an exclusion period during which we regarded further coding for the same outcome as
representing the same acute event (e.g. for diabetic emergencies we regarded multiple records within seven
days of each other as representing the same event). We used different condition-specific time periods to
define outcome events to account for differences in natural history of study outcomes (Table 1).
We stratified on the following pre-specified variables: age (in 10-year bands), sex, geographic region, and
ethnicity.

Statistical analysis
We described all denominator study populations in the first week of January each year (2017-2020). We
plotted the percentage of our study populations with contacts for particular conditions in given weeks in 2020
and historical averages for that week (2017-2019). We repeated analyses stratified by age, sex, region, and
ethnicity.
To quantify changes in consultation behaviour following introducing restrictions we used an interrupted time
series (ITS) analysis separating our time series into two periods: 1) Pre-lockdown: 1st January 2017 to March
1st 2020 for all outcomes except self-harm (which excluded data from 2017 and 2018, Text S1); and 2) Withrestrictions: from 29th March 2020 to the study end (12th July 2020).
Although restrictions were announced on 23rd March,23 activity levels (measured by mobile phone
applications and public transport journeys) had declined before the announcement.24–26 To account for
anticipatory behaviour, we conservatively defined the start of restrictions as the first week of March, and
removed all data in March up to, and including, the week restrictions were announced from the ITS analysis.
For our ITS analysis, we used binomial generalised linear models with number of weekly contacts weighted by
dynamic population sizes (updated weekly).27 We included a linear effect of time to capture long-term
behaviour trends, a binary pre-lockdown/with-restrictions variable to measure the direct ‘step’ change in
behaviour, and an interaction between the two to allow for a recovery ‘slope’ change in behaviour. We
accounted for seasonal effects by including calendar month as a categorical variable, and autocorrelation by
including first order lagged residuals. Standard errors were scaled to account for overdispersion.27
To estimate the reduction in contacts as restrictions were introduced (the `step’ change) we reported odds
ratios (ORs) for the relative difference in contacts at the start of the with-restrictions period compared to the
end of the pre-lockdown period. To estimate the recovery of contacts over time (the `slope’) we used the
coefficients from the ITS model to estimate the weekly log odds of contact during the with-restrictions period
(further details: Text S2).
To estimate absolute effects of restrictions on the number of contacts, we repeated our analysis using Poisson
regression to generate linear predictions of the estimated log contact count and the estimated log count if the
‘restrictions’ term was set to zero (i.e. there had been no restrictions). To quantify absolute changes in
behaviour over time we compared the point estimate of the estimated number of contacts with and without
restrictions at two time points: 1 month (26th April) and 3 months after introduction of restrictions (28th June).
We used Stata version 1628 and R version 4.0.229 for our analyses.
Sensitivity analyses
Our definitions for pre-lockdown and with-restrictions periods may have influenced our estimates, so we
repeated the ITS analysis with the same pre-lockdown period but with variable data-exclusion periods (5 and 7
weeks, versus 3 weeks in the main analysis) and repeated analyses with the pre-lockdown period ending on
15th March, the week before restriction introduction,23 excluding data for 0, 3, 5 and 7 weeks as sensitivity
analyses. Additionally, given the small number of diabetic emergency contacts we varied our definition using
less specific codes in a post-hoc sensitivity analysis (Text S3).

RESULTS
The overall denominator population included 9,863,903 individuals on 1st January 2017 and numbers
remained relatively stable throughout the study (Table 2). Characteristics of condition-specific study
populations are in the Appendix (Tables S1-S5).
Figure 1 shows the percentage of a given study populations with primary care contacts for each condition in
2020 (red line) and a 3-year historical average for the corresponding week (black line). Across the majority of
conditions, we observed rapid and sustained decreases in GP contacts between March and July 2020
compared to pre-lockdown periods. Despite gradual increases in the percentage of contacts following
restrictions, levels remained below the three-year average for all conditions except acute alcohol-related
events, which were higher than the historical average in 2020, and unstable angina. During March 2020 we
observed pronounced increases in contacts related to asthma exacerbations. Patterns were broadly
consistent when stratified by age (Figure 2), sex, region, and ethnicity (Figures S2-S4).

There was evidence that contacts for all studied conditions, except acute alcohol-related events, were lower
after restrictions were announced compared to pre-restriction levels (Figure 3A). The largest relative
reductions in contact behaviour following restriction introduction were observed for diabetic emergencies
(OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.25-0.50), depression (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.52-0.53), and self-harm (OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.540.58) (Figure 3B, Table S6). From March 28th 2020, we saw evidence of increasing contacts for most conditions
over time. Acute alcohol-related events and unstable angina contacts appeared to recover faster (3-5%
increase in odds of contact per week) (Figure 3C, Table S7) than, for example, mental health contacts, where
odds of contact increased by 1-2% per week, despite a 20-40% drop following restrictions (Figure 3B, Table
S6). Sensitivity analyses varying the choice of restriction period provided broadly consistent results over a
wide range of scenarios with a notable exception of acute alcohol-related events (Tables S6-S7, Figures S8S14).
Table 3 illustrates the potential impact of reduced contacts on relevant populations. While for some rare
conditions, the absolute change in contacts was relatively small, other more common conditions had a larger
absolute change in contacts, for example, in a population of 1 million people with COPD, from the end of
March to the end of June, we estimated that there were cumulatively 43,900 fewer COPD exacerbation
contacts per million people with COPD than expected. During the weeks commencing 26th April and 28th June
we estimated there were 3,640 and 3,230 fewer contacts (per million) than expected respectively, indicating a
slow return to pre-lockdown contact levels, but not complete recovery. For example, we estimated there
were cumulatively fewer contacts for: 1) asthma exacerbations (14,100 for every one million people with
asthma; and 2) depression and anxiety contacts (12,800 and 6,600 respectively) for every one million people
in the general population (aged ³11 years).

DISCUSSION
Primary care contacts for key physical and mental health conditions dropped dramatically after the
introduction of population-wide restriction measures in March 2020. By July 2020, with the exception of
unstable angina and acute alcohol-related contacts, primary care contacts for all conditions studied remained
below pre-lockdown levels. We estimate that by July 2020, per million people in the general population, there
were very small (<10) drops in contacts for myocardial infarction, unstable angina and venous
thromboembolism, but drops of around 6,600 and 12,800 anxiety and depression contacts. Per million people
with COPD, we estimate 43,900 fewer exacerbation contacts.

Results in context
Our study is the first to explore the effect of lockdown measures on primary care contacts for specific acute
physical and mental health conditions across the UK. A study (47 primary care practices) in a largely deprived
urban area, badly affected by the pandemic in North West England (Salford) suggested primary care
consultations across four broad categories (common mental health problems, cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer) had reduced by up to 50% by the end of May 2020.18 In
contrast to the Salford study, our sample was nationally representative and focused on contacts for specific
disease categories we would expect to present to healthcare providers. Our large sample size allowed us to
investigate detailed diagnoses (for example, different types of CVD and mental health conditions).
In September 2020 GPs conducted more face-to-face appointments than any week since March, and more
consultations overall than prior to the pandemic (43% were telephone appointments).30,31 A study of 51 GP
practices already offering remote consultations before the pandemic indicated a dip in overall consultations at
lockdown, but unlike our results for specific acute conditions, their post-lockdown overall consultation
decrease was less extreme than during Christmas 2019.32 In England there was a 30% decrease in GP
consultations from the beginning to the end of March 2020,33 with an increase in calls to NHS 111, the nonurgent telephone helpline. However, over 50% (1,573,835/2,962,751) of these calls went unanswered.34
Diabetic emergencies
The reduced diabetic emergency contacts we observed are consistent with the 49% reduction in new type 2
diabetes contacts (new prescriptions for metformin) in Salford. While the Salford study highlighted missed
new diagnoses, our study identifies missed contacts for acute deteriorations. Given that 90% of diabetes
management is in primary care, the large relative reduction in the proportion of people with diabetes with
diabetic emergency contacts is concerning.35

Recent evidence indicates a two-way interaction between diabetes and COVID-19, with a potentially causal
association between COVID-19 infection and dysglycaemia, such that each condition exacerbates the
other.36,37 Further, there is evidence that other emergency situations impair control of diabetes.38–40
Consequently, we would expect an increase, rather than decrease, in diabetic emergency contacts. One
potential explanation for our findings is that individuals experiencing diabetic emergencies may be presenting
directly to secondary care with delayed recording in the primary care health record.

Mansfield, Mathur, Tazare, Henderson, Mulick, et al.

Cardiovascular disease
The reduction in CVD contacts is consistent with reports from other UK studies.18,41 Taken alongside findings
of similar reductions in Emergency Department presentations and hospital admissions for cardiovascular
outcomes in the UK, our findings highlight an area of major concern,3,42 particularly as evidence from France
indicates increased out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.43 Severe COVID-19 affects the cardiovascular system;44
hence, increased primary and secondary care presentations for CVD are expected.45 Indeed, it is possible that
the more rapid recovery in unstable angina contacts (compared to other study conditions) may reflect COVID19-related CVD (however, numbers were small).46
Respiratory disease
Reports from Germany, consistent with our findings, indicate reduced community and hospital presentations
with acute COPD exacerbations.47 COPD is associated with more severe COVID-19 infection;48 individuals with
COPD in the UK were recommended to avoid contact with others until September 2020.19,49 Decreased
emergency department visits for childhood asthma have been reported in the USA, consistent with our
observations.50 There is no compelling evidence that individuals with asthma are at greater risk of severe
COVID-19 outcomes, although there was uncertainty at pandemic onset.51–53 Viruses commonly trigger
asthma exacerbations, so we might have expected to see more asthma contacts. Anecdotally, GPs reported
increased prescription of asthma therapies around the lockdown period,54 which may explain initial increased
asthma contacts. Similar increases in COPD exacerbation contacts were not seen around introduction of
restrictions, despite our definition including prescriptions for oral corticosteroids. One explanation might be
that, as COPD is a progressive respiratory condition, individuals with COPD may have repeat prescriptions,
reducing need (compared to those with asthma) to stockpile drugs in a crisis.
Mental health
Surveys have reported increased anxiety, depression and self-harm during the pandemic,12,13,55–57 and
exacerbations of existing OCD, severe mental illness (SMI) and eating disorders have also been reported.58–60
However, we saw a sustained reduction in primary care contacts for anxiety, depression and other mental
health conditions consistent with other reports;18 this is concerning as the majority of common mental
disorders are managed in primary care. Similarly, reduced healthcare contacts for people with SMIs are
concerning, as people with SMIs are likely to be at greater risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19 due to high
prevalence of risk factors for adverse outcomes (e.g. CVD, deprivation61–63).
Alcohol
Findings from surveys on alcohol consumption in lockdown are mixed, with some reporting increased alcohol
consumption in up to a third of those surveyed, while others produced differing findings.64 We saw primary
care contacts for acute alcohol-related events increase before and after restrictions, which is troubling given
the reduction in contacts for other conditions studied (however, numbers were small).

Strengths and limitations
We performed a rapid assessment of changes in primary care contacts following the introduction of UKpopulation-wide restrictions up to July 2020 in a large sample respresentative of the UK population. Historical
data allowed us to compare observed patterns in 2020 to trends in the previous 3-years. We estimated
relative and absolute changes in contact patterns, with a focus on easy to interpret measures.
Our study describes and quantifies the reduction in primary care contacts across a wide range of health
conditions likely to be affected by COVID-19 to generate hypotheses. Further research is needed to

individuals who did not consult their GP. Specifically, were they treated in secondary care or did they selfmanage, and how much of our findings can be explained by genuine changes in disease frequency?
Without hospital and mortality data, we are unable to investigate whether, for example, any reduction in GP
contacts resulted in corresponding increases in hospital attendances or deaths. We focused on studying any
record of study conditions, hence, our results reflect all primary care contacts, including diagnoses recorded
by general practice staff from hospital discharge letters.
To avoid problems arising from the timing of behaviour change associated with restrictions, our ITS analysis
excluded a predefined intervention period when individuals’ behaviour was changing dynamically. We took a
conservative approach and defined our intervention period between 1st March and 28th March 2020 assuming
that some people would have modified behaviour before the introduction of restrictions. Sensitivity analyses
varying the start date showed consistent findings.
Detailed exploration of whether consultation behaviour varied in those considered clinically vulnerable and
advised to ‘shield18 is beyond the scope of this paper, and any changes in health-seeking behaviour would not
have reduced the need for care.

Clinical interpretation
Given evidence suggesting reduced emergency department attendances and hospital admissions for our study
conditions, while one explanation could be genuine changes in disease frequency (unlikely, given consistent
results across disease categories), it is more likely our findings reflect missed opportunities for care. There are
plausible mechanisms that might explain real reductions in frequency for some of our outcomes. For example:
1) better glycaemic control in diabetes due to more regular routines when staying home; 2) less respiratory
disease due to lower exposure to air pollution during lockdown,65 and reduced community-aquired respiratory
infections due to ‘shielding’ guidelines;19 and 3) reduced alcohol consumption due to pub closure and reduced
social contact. Conversely, there are plausible mechanisms that could explain genuine increased frequency of
these conditions (e.g. distress related to the pandemic affecting mental health and alcohol consumption,
reduced exercise affecting cardiovascular health, changes in diet influencing glycaemic control); and for some
of our outcomes, e.g., mental health conditions, there is some evidence indicating increased
frequency.12,13,55,56,58–60 Increases in non-COVID-related excess mortality also make it more likely our observed
reduction in primary care contacts was due to behavioural changes rather than reduced disease
frequency.13,66–69 Further, emerging evidence of the systemic complications of COVID-19 infection (particularly
CVD and diabetes)36,70,71 indicates we might have expected more need for care for these conditions as a direct
result of the pandemic.

Implications for policy and research
Our results are likely to represent a large burden of unmet need, particularly in relation to COPD and mental
health conditions; healthcare providers should prepare for increases in morbidity and mortality. Further
research should address whether reduced clinical contact has resulted in excess mortality, and whether we
need to increase service provision for individuals with increased healthcare needs resulting from delaying
seeking access to care. While numbers of unstable angina events were small, we note more rapid (compared
to other study outcomes) return to pre-pandemic consultation rates; this observation needs investigation as it
may be a direct consequence of the pandemic. Finally, our findings highlight a need to ensure equitable
access to primary care in future pandemic planning. Countries such as Singapore, which had experienced
SARS, implemented control measures in primary care rapidly.72 The current pandemic has generated a wealth

of experience with alternative ways to access care remotely.73 These lessons must be systematised and
implemented.

Conclusions
We saw substantial reductions in primary care contacts for acute physical and mental health conditions. Our
findings are likely to represent a considerable burden of unmet need, which may lead to substantial increases
in subsequent mortality and morbidity.

TABLES
Table 1. Description of denominator populations and condition definitions.
Condition

Denominator population (condition-specific denominator populations)

Condition definition

All individuals (aged ≥11 years) with prevalent diagnoses of diabetes mellitus at
the start of each week of follow-up. Individuals contributed to the study
population from the latest of the start of follow-up in the overall population and
the date of their first record indicating a diagnosis of diabetes.

Any record of diabetes-related hyperglycaemia, hypoglycaemia, ketoacidosis, or
diabetic coma. Multiple records occurring within seven days of each other were
considered as representing the same event.

Anxiety

All individuals (aged ≥11 years) from the overall study population.

Any record of symptoms or diagnoses of: social phobia, agoraphobia, panic,
generalized anxiety disorder, and mixed anxiety and depression. Multiple records
occurring within seven days of each other were considered as representing the
same event.

Depression

All children (aged 5-17 years) and adults (aged ≥18) from the overall study
population.

Any record of major depressive disorder, dysthymia, mixed anxiety and
depression, and adjustment disorders with depressed mood. We also included
codes for depressive symptoms. Multiple records occurring within seven days of
each other were considered as representing the same event.

Self-harm

All children (aged 5-17 years) and adults (aged ≥18 years) from the overall study
population.

Self-harm defined as records that indicated explicit or undertermined intention to
self-harm, non-suicidal or suicidal self-harm (including overdoses with drugs
commonly implicated in suicide, e.g. paracetamol). Multiple records occurring
within seven days of each other were considered as representing the same event.

Serious mental illness

All children (aged 5-17 years) and adults (aged ≥18 years) from the overall study
population.

Severe mental illness included diagnoses of schizophrenia and other psychotic
disorders, and bipolar disorders. Multiple records occurring within seven days of
each other were considered as representing the same event.

Eating disorders

All children (aged 5-17 years) and adults (aged ≥18 years) from the overall study
population.

Eating disorders included anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and other specified
feeding and eating disorders. Multiple records occurring within seven days of
each other were considered as representing the same event.

Obsessive compulsive disorder

All children (aged 5-17 years) and adults (aged ≥18 years) from the overall study
population.

Obsessive compulsive disorder was defined by codes for body dysmorphic
disorders, hypochondriasis, hoarding disorder, and body focused repetitive
behaviour disorders. Multiple records occurring within seven days of each other
were considered as representing the same event.

Condition

Denominator population (condition-specific denominator populations)

Condition definition

Asthma exacerbations

All individuals (aged ≥11 years) with a current asthma diagnosis (i.e. asthma code
in the last two or three years if aged <18 years or 18+ years, respectively).
Individuals joined the study population from the start of follow-up in the overall
population if there was a current asthma diagnosis (i.e. within last 2-3 years) at
this time or from the date of their first record indicating an asthma diagnosis
within overall follow-up. Participants remained in the study until there was no
current asthma diagnosis or the end of overall follow-up. They were able to reenter the study if there was a later diagnostic code for asthma before the end of
overall follow-up. Following an existing definition, individuals 40 years and over
with asthma were considered as likely to have COPD (and therefore not included
in the asthma study population [denominator]) if they had a subsequent COPD
diagnosis recorded within the two years following the current asthma record.74

Asthma exacerbations were defined as records for morbidity codes for asthma
exacerbations and status asthmaticus, and a primary care prescription for an oral
corticoseroid.21 Multiple records occurring within 14 days of each other were
considered as representing the same event.

COPD exacerbations

Adults (aged ≥41 years) with an established diagnosis of COPD and evidence of a
smoking history.75 Individuals joined the study population from the latest of the
start of follow-up in the overall population and the date of their first record
indicating diagnosis of COPD.

Exacerbations of COPD were defined using morbidity codes in individuals with
existing COPD for COPD exacerbations, lower respiratory tract infections,
breathlessness or sputum production, and a new prescription for an oral
corticosteroid or antibiotic.22 Multiple records occurring within 14 days of each
other were considered as representing the same event.

Myocardial infarction

All adults (aged >31 years)

Any record for myocardial infarction allowing for a 1-year window between
successive records. Multiple records occurring within one year of each other
were considered as representing the same event.

Unstable angina

All adults (aged ≥31years)

Any record for unstable angina, allowing for a 6-month window between
successive records. Multiple records occurring within six months of each other
were considered as representing the same event.

Transient ischaemic attacks

All adults (aged ≥31 years)

Any record for transient ischaemic, allowing for a 6-month window between
successive records. Multiple records occurring within six months of each other
were considered as representing the same events

Cerebrovascular accident

All adults (aged ≥31 years)

Any record for cerebrovascular accidents, allowing for a 1-year window between
successive records. Multiple records occurring within one year of each other
were considered as representing the same event.

Denominator population (condition-specific denominator populations)

Condition definition

Cardiac failure

All adults (aged ≥31 years)

Given the complexity with capturing acute events for a chronic condition, we only
counted an individual’s first ever diagnosis with cardiac failure.

Venous thromboembolism
(pulmonary embolism and deep
venous thrombosis)

All adults (aged ≥31 years)

Any record for venous thromboembolism, allowing for a 1-year window between
successive records. Multiple records occurring within one year of each other
were considered as representing the same event.

All adults (aged ≥18 years)

Any record for acute physical or psychological alcohol-related event, including
acute alcoholic pancreatitis, Multiple records occurring within 14 days of each
other were considered as representing the same event.

Table 3. Estimated reduction in estimated number of primary care contacts.
Estimated number of primary care contacts for acute physical and mental health conditions in a hypothetical non-COVID year compared to the number of contacts estimated
from our model for 2020 at two weekly time points: 26th April and 28th June 2020. Estimates for the number of contacts are in a hypothetical population of one million people
but the reference populations are condition specific. For example, the estimated number of contacts for diabetic emergencies is among a population of 1 million people aged
11 years and older with a diabetes mellitus diagnosis, whereas the estimated number of people with depression contacts among one million individuals from the general
population aged 5 and over.

* Estimates of the difference between scenarios and cumulative difference have been rounded to 3 significant digits to avoid overly precise estimates. We did not intend to estimate the exact number of
“missed” consultations but obtained an estimate of the absolute indirect effect of COVID-19 on different conditions. If the expected difference was <100 or <10 then estimates have been censored for the same
reason.

COVID-19 collateral: Indirect acute effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical and mental health in the UK
Mansfield, Mathur, Tazare, Henderson, Mulick, et al.

Figure 3 – Interrupted time series
An interrupted time series analysis of the change in GP contacts before and after introduction of UK-wide restrictions.
A; grey line, the percentage of the study population with primary care contacts for each health condition. Blue region,
predicted percentage of contacts from the full ITS model. Black vertical lines, data excluded data from the analysis
from 1st March to 29th March (adjustment-to-restrictions period). B; 95% CI for the estimated relative reduction in the
percentage of contacts for each health condition immediately after the adjustment-to-restrictions period (29th March
2020) compared to the pre-restriction period (OR closer to 0 shows a greater reduction in the estimated percentage
of people with GP contacts). C; estimated effect of time (in weekly increments) post-restriction introduction on the
percentage of contacts for each condition. (OR greater that 1 indicates increasing percentage of population with
contacts over time). Results for 2020 only are shown here (Figure S13 for full model fit to data from 2017) (full relative
reduction/recovery estimates [95% CIs] Tables S6 and S7).
