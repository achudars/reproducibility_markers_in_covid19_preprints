Abstract:

48

Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global public health

49

emergency causing a disparate burden of death and disability around the world. The molecular

50

characteristics of the virus that predict better or worse outcome are largely still being discovered.

51

Methods: We downloaded 155,958 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

52

CoV-2) genomes from GISAID and evaluated whether variants improved prediction of reported

53

severity beyond age and region. We also evaluated specific variants to determine the magnitude

54

of association with severity and the frequency of these variants among the genomes.

55

Results: Logistic regression models that included viral genomic variants outperformed other

56

models (AUC=0.91 as compared with 0.68 for age and gender alone; p<0.001). Among

57

individual variants, we found 17 single nucleotide variants in SARS-CoV-2 have more than two-

58

fold greater odds of being associated with higher severity and 67 variants associated with ≤0.5

59

times the odds of severity. The median frequency of associated variants was 0.15% (interquartile

60

range 0.09%-0.45%). Altogether 85% of genomes had at least one variant associated with patient

61

outcome.

62

Conclusion: Numerous SARS-CoV-2 variants have two-fold or greater association with odds of

63

mild or severe outcome and collectively, these variants are common. In addition to

64

comprehensive mitigation efforts, public health measures should be prioritized to control the

65

more severe manifestations of COVID-19 and the transmission chains linked to these severe

66

cases.

Introduction

69

Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic emerged, humans have faced

70

unprecedented disruption from the newfound obligate parasite. Within the United States alone,

71

the unwelcome guest has already caused an estimated 2.5 million years of life lost.(1) Beyond

72

the United States, the global burden is substantial and growing, but it is not uniform; continents,

73

nations, communities, families, and patients are all affected differently. Understanding the basis

74

for this variability is an important global health priority.

75

One of the most common measures to describe the severity of COVID-19 is the infection fatality

76

ratio (IFR) or the number of deaths for every infection. There are widespread differences in IFR

77

between studies,(2-4) and this heterogeneity is not due to chance alone (p<0.001).(2) One meta-

78

analysis of 26 studies estimated an IFR of 0.68% (0.53-0.82%) while cautioning this was likely

79

an “underestimate” and another meta-analysis with 61 studies estimated a median IFR of 0.26%,

80

outside the range of the first meta-analysis.(2, 3)

81

Other studies have suggested the variability in infection fatality ratio is more consistent when

82

infections are stratified by age, but is more likely to vary between studies when considering the

83

population above age 65.(4-6) In fact, one paper even estimated that “differences in age structure

84

of the population and the age-specific prevalence of COVID-19 explain nearly 90% of the

85

geographical variation in population IFR.”(4)

86

Although vulnerable age groups should be protected as recommended by the U.S. Centers for

87

Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are likely more factors at play in the IFR than age

88

alone. First, there is variability among some younger groups. In the most recent meta-analysis

89

among those age <70, IFR estimates varied from 0.00% to 0.31% with a median of 0.05%.(3)

90

Second, even within the same hospital systems, there are strong time trends in case fatality rate

91

after adjusting for baseline characteristics/risk (7) even at the national scale (8), which authors

92

attributed to better treatment. Unless baseline risk adjustments were inadequate, there are likely

93

time trends in IFR, which would also help reconcile the disparate estimates noted in the two

94

meta-analyses cited above.

95

Another possibility is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virulence

96

could differ across geographic locations because some local strains have higher or lower

97

virulence than others. Previous reports have argued that evolution of attenuated strains is

98

expected for RNA viruses and that “determination of naturally circulating attenuated SARS‐

99

CoV‐2 variants is an urgent matter.” (9) Previous publications on evolution of virulence

100

observed that pathogens transmitting with a respiratory route (unlike vector-borne diseases)

101

typically evolve toward lower virulence after emergence because healthier hosts tend to engage

102

in more social contact.(10)

103

Using publicly available data from GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data),

104

we interrogate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 variants and associated patient outcomes

105

in the GISAID metadata. We differentiate between severe and mild patient outcomes and utilize

106

a logistic regression model in order to better understand how viral genomic SARS-CoV-2

107

variants are linked with COVID-19 patient outcomes.

111

SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were obtained from GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All

112

Influenza Data) on October 21, 2020 (11, 12), (GISAID Acknowledgments Table,

113

Supplementary Table 1). GISAID sequences were filtered to include those of human origin.

114

FASTA sequences were aligned to the reference sequence, Wuhan-Hu-1 (NCBI: NC_045512.2;

115

GISAID: EPI_ISL_402125) using Minimap2 (version 2.17).(13) Resulting VCF (Variant Call

116

Format) files were annotated using SnpEff (version 5.0) and filtered using SnpSift.(14, 15) The

117

shell scripts used for variant alignment and variant calling, along with the Python scripts used to

118

perform the steps described below, are available on GitHub at https://github.com/mskar/variants.

119
120

Metadata Preprocessing and Cohort Building

121

Raw GISAID patient data was parsed from the JSON file using Python (version 3.8.2). Patient

122

outcomes were then aggregated into positive (“Mild”) outcomes or negative (“Severe”)

123

outcomes (detailed in Supplemental Figure 1). Briefly, “Mild” outcomes included: Outpatient,

124

Asymptomatic, Mild, Home/Isolated/Quarantined, and Not Hospitalized. “Severe” outcomes

125

included: Hospitalized (including severe, moderate, and stable) and Deceased (Death). Patient

126

outcomes that were unclear or empty were not included in our analyses.

127
128

Variant and Metadata Modeling

129

Annotated VCF files were parsed, pivoted to wide format, and joined with GISAID patient data

130

using Pandas (version 1.0.3).(16) Logistic regression models with the default L1 penalty (Lasso

131

regularization) were fit to the patient (rows) and variant (columns) data using Scikit-learn

132

(version 0.23.2).(17) Logistic regression model Area Under the Curve (AUC) and accuracy

133

values were calculated using Scikit-learn.(17) Models were persisted as pickle files using joblib

134

(version 0.14.1).

135
136

Plotting and Statistical Analysis

137

Scatter and bar plots were created using Pandas (version 1.0.3),(16) Matplotlib (version

138

3.2.1),(18) and Seaborn (version 0.10.1).(19) Logistic regression model AUC p-values and Chi-

139

square test p-values for association of variants with “Severe” outcomes were obtained using

140

Scipy (version 1.5.0).(20) Variant frequency was calculated using Pandas.(16) Genome position

141

tracks were added to scatterplots using DNA Features Viewer (version 3.0.3).(21) ROC curves

142

were plotted using Scikit-learn (version 0.23.2),(17) and Matplotlib.(18) Logistic regression

Sample population characteristics

147

We collected a total of 155,958 viral genomes along with clinical metadata. The metadata

148

included numerous entries whereby the severity of the condition could not readily be discerned.

149

For example, “recovering”, “recovered and released”, and “mild symptoms inpatient for

150

observation” were found in the raw data and were not included. The full downloaded dataset

151

included 148,121 entries with empty or unknown clinical observations, and 4,200 entries for

152

which clinical severity could not be classified. From the remaining 3,637 sequences with clear

153

severity indications, we generated two classes (Supplemental Figure S1) by recoding the

154

observational metadata into consistent terminology and creating a “Severe” class of “deceased”,

155

“hospitalized”, “ICU”, and “pneumonia” (n=2,870); and a “Mild” class of “outpatient”, “mild”,

156

“epidemiology study”, “asymptomatic”, “screening”, and “stable in quarantine” (n=767). 85% of

157

these genomes had at least one variant associated with patient outcome. Viral sequences were

158

obtained from the six major geographical regions in GISAID between January and October 2020

159

(Supplemental Figure S2).

160

SARS-CoV-2 variants associated with “Severe” / “Mild” outcome categories

161

The overwhelming majority of variants in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes assessed were rare, with

162

only 12 common variants with at least a 5% minor allele frequency (Figure 1C). Two of these

163

common variants (C26735T and C28311T) were associated with “Severe” or “Mild” outcomes,

164

as measured by having an odds ratio of greater than 2 or ≤0.5, respectively. We also observed 84

165

of 157 rare variant associations with “Severe” or “Mild” outcomes. Collectively, 17 variants

166

were associated with “Severe” classification with at least an odds ratio of 2, while we found 67

167

associations with “Mild” classification (OR≤0.5). The variants associated with outcomes were

168

distributed across the genome, including the strongest “Severe” association within the C-terminal

169

end of the spike protein (Figure 1B). The majority of variants characterized here were transitions

170

(121, 71%), with 47% of those transitions (79) being C>T (Supplemental Figure S3). All

171

individual variant associations and frequencies are reported in Supplementary Table 2.

172
173

Predicting clinical outcomes for patients based upon clinical metadata and viral genomics

174

Age and gender have been previously reported to be predictive of clinical outcomes.(22) Our

175

observations predicting “Severe” outcomes confirm these prior associations (Figure 2); however

176

we found that the c-statistic for predictions based on age or age and gender are only slightly

177

better than random chance at 0.677 (0.642-0.712) and 0.679 (0.644-0.714), respectively. We

178

hypothesized that viral genomic variants in the virus could also contribute to severity

179

classification. When accounting for the region of collection, we observed an increased c-statistic

180

to 0.817 (0.817-0.818). Previous observations show that regions tend to be dominated by

181

individual viral clades, and we found that adding clade to an age/gender/region model resulted in

182

moderate improvement of accuracy (81% vs. 86%, respectively) with a nearly identical AUC of

183

0.818 (0.817-0.818). While the difference between region and clade appears insignificant, adding

184

clade-level information increased the predictive ability of our model beyond age and gender

185

alone. We then considered whether variant-level information would further improve model

186

performance. We found that substituting clade with 4,499 genomic variants in the model

187

increased the c-statistic to 0.911 (0.910-0.911), significantly improving predictability for clinical

188

outcomes. In addition to the improvement in c-statistic, we compared the accuracy of our

189

predictions, which started at 81% for the age-only model and improved to 86% and 88% for each

190

additional step in the model building before finally reaching a maximum at 91% accuracy for the

191

age/gender/region/variant model.

192

Classifications based solely on age or on age and gender resulted in insignificant odds ratios in

193

our models. Both models had the same odds ratio (4.4), confidence interval (2.8-6.0), and p-

194

value (0.072). However, the other three models all had significant odds ratios with p-values less

195

than 0.0001. Consistent with the AUC results, the odds ratio was greatest for the full model

196

(age/gender/region/variant) followed by age/gender/region/clade and finally age/gender/region

197

(odds ratios: 12.3 (11.8-12.8), 8.4 (8.0-8.9), and 8.0 (7.6-8.4), respectively). Similarly, the

198

negative likelihood ratio for the full model displayed a large reduction in the likelihood of a

199

patient classified as “Mild” developing “Severe” symptoms (-LR=0.039) as compared to a

200

moderate reduction in the post-test outcomes for the age-only or age and gender models (-

201

LR=0.231 for both models).

202
203

Discussion:

204

We demonstrate that including genomic viral variants can substantially improve classification of

205

COVID-19 patient outcomes as compared with models using only age and region. Moreover, in

206

our models, we observe that some individual variants are particularly important with substantial

207

associations with severity, and that collectively these variants are not rare.

208

Associations between viral genomic variants and patient outcomes are not unexpected.

209

Consistent with known patterns in the evolution of virulence in RNA viruses (9, 10, 23), we

210

would expect many common strains have differing association with patient severity by this point

211

in the pandemic by chance alone and even as sampling is more likely to occur with severe

212

outcomes, variants correlated with mild outcomes are still being identified.

213

Though respiratory pathogens often evolve toward lower virulence, there have been historical

214

exceptions.(24) Modeling future fitness landscapes suggests that even partial isolation of

215

symptomatic cases can substantially reduce deaths with less transmission in the short term.

216

Importantly, this isolation can also potentially alter the evolutionary path by favoring less

217

virulent strains.(24) Alterations in virulence can happen with a small number of selections. For

218

example, E. faecalis evolved from a pathogen to a commensal strain in 15 passages in a worm

219

model, but most of the worm phenotype changed after just 5 rounds of bacterial selection.(25) A

220

mouse experiment showed higher virulence after 10 passages of a modified SARS-CoV-2 virus

221

with an additional ~1% drop in mouse body weight with each selection (26). Based upon these

222

findings and the large number of passages in the human outbreak, it can be expected that

223

significant evolution affecting virulence could occur in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

224

Indeed, others have previously found and characterized individual variants with in vitro assays

225

(27) or provided correlates of severity with any change in protein coding,(28) or genomic

226

correlates of mortality.(29) We have taken a comprehensive approach to describe all variants

227

associated with mild or severe outcome regardless of whether it is synonymous. There are

228

challenges in identifying signatures of selection in non-coding regions, but “for RNA

229

viruses…critical aspects of the life cycle rely on molecular processes that are not reflected in

230

protein sequence.”(30) Empiric tests of selection and structural modeling of RNA and protein

231

interaction can identify regions under selection without using the ratio of nonsynonymous to

232

synonymous mutations.(30) Studies of selection in SARS-CoV-2 have also advised not to

233

underestimate the role of synonymous substitutions.(31) Beyond RNA molecule interactions,

234

there also appear to be selective pressures on which codon is used for an amino acid, which

235

could be attributed to tRNA abundance (32) or could be related to broader patterns of host RNA

236

editing involving deamination and similar mechanisms. (33-35) Alternatively, a variant

237

correlated with severity might represent an epiphenomenon that is linked to multiple variants that

238

each have a smaller association with severity. Regardless of the applicability of these

239

explanations for why synonymous changes could be important indicators of virulence, we

240

wanted to take an agnostic approach to characterize all variants correlated with severity so that

241

they could be further resolved with additional study and additional surveillance (particularly

242

among asymptomatic cases). These studies, in addition to comprehensive prognostic study, could

243

better clarify how unexpected a patient’s severity was as compared with additional risk factors.

244

For example, one mutation we identified (C13620T) is associated with 5.9 times the odds of

245

severe disease. Although it does not result in any change in an amino acid of the NSP12 (RNA-

246

dependent RNA polymerase), it could result in altered expression. Because NSP12 is required

247

for the transcription of all viral RNA in coronaviruses (36), increased replication could increase

248

virulence.

249

Other mutations were nonsynonymous. We identified two previously reported spike mutations,

250

V1176F (G25088T) and S477N (G22992A), as important indicators for COVID-19 disease

251

severity. Recent protein modeling studies have indicated that both mutations cause favorable

252

energetic changes that result in a more flexible Spike protein and can change RBD-ACE2

253

binding. Importantly, both mutations have been associated with higher mortality rates, and are

254

therefore expected to have significant impacts on public health.(37, 38) Other mutations were

255

observed less commonly, but could still be relevant for understanding higher viral pathogenesis.

256

The G26144T causes amino acid change G251V in Orf3a and was associated with 4.3 times the

257

odds of severe disease. Protein trafficking is a complex multifactorial process (39) and Orf3a

258

functions as a modulator of the trafficking properties of the spike protein of SARS-1 and is

259

dependent on the protein-protein interaction of Orf3a and S.(40) A structural analysis of the

260

G251V in Orf3a of SARS-CoV-2 results in significant changes in the overall protein structure

261

and weaker affinity for both the S and M proteins with Orf3a. One possible outcome of the

262

weaker Orf3a-S and Orf3a-M interaction could be an increased Orf3a-TRAF3 interaction

263

resulting in increased activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by promoting TRAF3-dependent

264

ubiquitination of ASC.(41, 42) Thus, the altered protein-protein interaction of the G251V Orf3a

265

may impact the trafficking of Orf3a resulting in a higher propensity for inflammatory cytokine

266

activation.

267

We also identified that the C28311T mutation was associated with a lower odds ratio of 0.14.

268

This mutation lies within the probe of the N1 assay in the CDC’s PCR assay (43), creating a

269

P13L change in the nucleocapsid protein. A previous study evaluated how this mutation may

270

alter protein-protein interaction and proposed it impacted virus stability, potentially contributing

271

to lower pathogenesis.(44) Additional follow-up studies will help to illuminate effects of these

272

variants on viral fitness, infectivity, host response, and evolutionary trajectory.

273

Identifying genetic variants associated with outcomes could provide mechanistic understanding

274

of the life cycle.(45) Efforts such as the CDC’s annual influenza surveillance rely upon

275

understanding those key genetic variants to predict seasonal intensity and attempt to develop

276

effective countermeasures (vaccines) (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm).

277

Although deep molecular insights are important, they are not necessary for public health

278

applications. The CDC offers symptom-based criteria for prioritizing testing and symptom-based

279

criteria are also included in recommendations for prioritizing contact tracing

280

(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/contact-

281

tracing.html#). By prioritizing cases and contacts with symptoms (as compared with

282

asymptomatic cases and their asymptomatic contacts) in addition to the recommended global

283

mitigation efforts, there could be relative selective pressure against strains that are more likely to

284

cause symptoms. This could favor the emergence of attenuated strains over the long term.

285

The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the limitations of the global healthcare system in

286

intensive care units, mechanical ventilators, and emerging therapeutics and other medical

287

countermeasures.(46, 47) Early in the outbreak, cities such as New York became inundated with

288

infections and their ability to adequately sort and treat patients was quickly overwhelmed.(48)

289

The existence of a rapid and accurate tool that could help identify COVID-19 patients or clusters

290

that are more likely to experience severe symptoms or require intensive medical resources (e.g.,

291

inpatient hospitalization and ventilation) may be able to help healthcare systems allocate

292

resources to the regions with the most critical needs. Therefore, by providing a molecular risk

293

factor for more severe outcomes, these findings could help prioritize limited treatment supplies

294

to those at greatest risk, particularly as therapeutic interventions for infectious disease often need

295

to be given early in the disease course (e.g., empiric antivirals for influenza).

296

There are limitations with our analyses. First, the SARS-CoV-2 genomes uploaded to GISAID

297

are not necessarily representative of all circulating genomes, which can introduce a selection or

298

sampling bias into our analyses based on region, patient severity, or other unmeasured factors. In

299

Supplemental Figure S2 we show the sampling patterns over time by our patient severity

300

categorization. We sought to mitigate these limitations by eliminating the categories that had

301

ambiguous severity (e.g., “live” or “recovered”), and adjusting the associations for known

302

confounders. In addition, we do not seek to make causal claims about any specific viral genomic

303

variant. In aggregate these variants are predictive of outcome and the candidates we identify can

304

be further studied using molecular and other methods.

305

In summary, we have demonstrated that some SARS-CoV-2 genomic variants are strong

306

predictors of COVID-19 disease severity, and these variants appear to be commonly circulating.

307

This study provides a rationale for prioritizing control efforts for cases and populations

308

manifesting with unusually high severity, consistent with symptom-based criteria for testing used

309

by the CDC. Longitudinal monitoring of genomic variants within a novel pathogen such as

310

SARS-CoV-2 will be important for understanding drivers and effects of its evolution and

311

ultimately, its spread or control.

517
518

B) The counts of variants with odds ratios not equal to one (n=170) plotted
against half-open intervals of 3 kilobases (kb), e.g. [0, 3000) in the SARS-CoV-2
genome.

519
