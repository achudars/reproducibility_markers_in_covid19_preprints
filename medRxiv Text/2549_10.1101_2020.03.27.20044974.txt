Abstract
Objectives: To assess outcomes in patients who have severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and
were treated with either China guideline based Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) plus standard care
or standard care alone.
Design: A pilot randomized controlled trial.
Setting Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Wuhan, China
Patients: A total of 42 adults with severe COVID-19.
Interventions: Participants in the CHM plus standard care group received CHM and standard care, and
the control group received standard care alone.
Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was the change in the disease severity
category of COVID-19 after treatment at 7 days. Among 42 participants who were randomized (mean
[SD] age 60.43 years [12.69 years]; 21 [50%] were aged ≥ 65 years; and 35 [83%] women, 42 (100%)
had data available for the primary outcome. For the primary outcome, one patient from each group
died during treatment; the odds of a shift towards death was lower in the CHM plus group than the
standard care alone group (common OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.148 to 2.352 P=.454). Three (2 from the CHM
plus group and 1 from the standard care alone group) patients progressed from severe to critical
illness. After treatment, mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 disease accounted for 18% (5) vs 14%
(2), 71% (20) vs 64% (9), and 0% (0) vs 7% (1) of the patients treated with CHM plus standard care vs.
standard care alone.
Conclusions: For the first time, the G-CHAMPS trial provided valuable information for the national
guideline-based CHM treatment for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. CHM effects in
COVID-19 may be clinically important and warrant further consideration and studies.

Introduction
Approximately 14-16% patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) suffer from severe diseases
like pneumonia and 5% become critically ill(1, 2). The mortality rate of COVID-19 among those
suffering critical illness was reported to be over 50%(1).The National Health Commission and the
National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of the People’s Republic of China developed
clinical guidelines for the management of COVID-19 (NHC-NATCM-China guidelines)(3, 4). In these
guidelines, CHM was included as part of the treatment plans for severe COVID-19. These
recommendations were developed by the consensus of experts. We thus conducted this pilot
randomized clinical trial (RCT) to test the potential effectiveness of the guideline-based CHM
treatment for severe COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.

Methods
Study design
This was an open-label, pilot, randomized trial for severe COVID-19. The trial was approved by the
ethics committee at Dongzhimen Hospital (No. DZMEC-KY-2020-09). The trial was registered at the
Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000029418). The trial protocol and protocol amendments were
provided in Appendix 1 protocol.
Patient Enrollment
Patients were screened for eligibility of the G-CHAMPS trial upon admission. During the ongoing
epidemic of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, patients with a confirmatory diagnosis of COVID-19 were
directly admitted or transferred to designated COVID-19 hospitals. By Jan 27, 2020, the Chinese
government had designated over 40 hospitals for the treatment of COVID-19 in Wuhan. Hubei

Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine is one of the government-designated
hospitals for the treatment of COVID-19. Inclusion criteria comprised of: adult patients (≥ 18 years),
positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 on a polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay, respiratory rate (RR) ≥
30/min or SaO2≤93% or a PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤300mmHg(4), and able to provide informed consent.
Patients were excluded if known life expectancy was 48 hours or less, on home oxygen at baseline,
pregnant or lactating, diagnosed with end stage diseases, or using immunosuppressants for six
months or longer. Eligible patients were provided with oral information about the trial and given the
opportunity to ask questions. Patients who were willing to take part in the trial were invited for an
interview to gather necessary information including a verbal consent; the audio of the interview was
electronically recorded.
Randomization and masking
Eligible participants were randomized with a 2:1 ratio to the CHM plus standard care (CHM plus) group
or the standard care alone group, using a simple random allocation method. Allocation was concealed
to laboratory personnel and outcome assessors.
Procedures
Per NHC-NATCM-China guidelines, all patients received standard care, which included hemodynamic
monitoring, laboratory testing, supplementary oxygen, intravenous fluids, and routine pharmaceutical
medications and other medical care when deemed appropriate by on-duty physicians. Oral
ribavirin/arbidole (not remdesivir) was part of the standard care in China (Appendix 1 protocol). Per
the NHC-NATCM-China guidelines, patients in the CHM plus group also received CHM within 12 hours
after randomization (Appendix 1 protocol). The herbal formulas were supported by Jiangyin Tianjiang
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Quality of the herbs was in accordance with the 2015 Chinese

Pharmacopoeia(5). All herbs were tested for heavy metals, microbial contamination, and residual
pesticides to ensure they meet the safety standards in China prior to use. Trained and experienced
technicians prepared the decoction from the formulas according to a standardized procedure; each
unit of formula yielded 400mL of decoction, divided into two equal portions. Nurses administered the
decoction 200mL to patients orally (via feeding tube if needed) twice daily for a total of seven days in
the CHM plus group. Data were retrieved from electronic medical records using the standardized case
record forms which created by members of ISARIC(6) (International Severe Acute Respiratory and
Emerging Infection Consortium) in collaboration with the World Health Organization.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the change in the disease severity category of COVID-19 after treatment.
The severity of COVID-19 was assessed based on the Six-Point Clinical Status Scale for COVID-19
(COVID-19 severity scale) (Score 0: Hospital discharge or meet discharge criteria- Discharge criteria are
defined as: 1 Normal body temperature for more than 3 days; 2 Significantly improved respiratory
symptoms: no oxygen supplementation requirement, stable and normal vital signs for longer than 1
day; 3 Lung imaging shows obvious absorption and recsolution of acute infiltrates; 4 Negative results
of the nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 for consecutive two times with at least 1 day interval between
tests. ). (Score 1: Mild-Improving and/or mild clinical symptoms and no pneumonia changes in
radiological imaging studies.). (Score 2: Moderate-Active symptoms like fever and respiratory tract
symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates seen in imaging.). (Score 3: Severe Meeting any of the following:
1 Respiratory distress, RR ≥30 breaths/min; 2 Pulse oximetry (SpO2) ≤ 93% on room air at rest state; 3
Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / oxygen concentration (FiO2) ≤ 300 mmHg).(Score 4:

complications that require intensive care unit care). (Score 5: Death). The Six-Point Clinical Status Scale
for COVID-19 was defined according to NHC-NATCM-China guideline and WHO R&D Blueprint. An
independent clinical event adjudication committee (CEAC) performed the final the outcome
assessment based on the pre-specified criteria. Secondary outcomes included the overall survival
through last day of treatment, the proportion of patients without improvement (scored 3 to 5 on the
COVID-19 severity scale) and the change in serum procalcitonin level after treatment and the
prevalence of antibiotic use during treatment.

Statistical analysis
Since this is a pilot randomized trial, sample size calculation was not performed. For pharmaceutical
interventions, a minimum sample size of 12 per group was usually recommended as a rule of thumb
for a pilot study(7). Considering a dropout rate of 10%, we aimed to recruit a total sample size of 42
patients (standard care group, n=14; CHM plus group, n=28).
We compared the severity of COVID-19 with ordinal logistic regression (shift analysis). The proportion
of patients without clinical improvement after treatment was assessed using the generalized linear
model. laboratory findings were performed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Hodges–Lehmann
estimates of location shift and 95% CIs were presented.
All outcomes were assessed in the intention-to-treat population with no imputation for missing data.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) with a 2-sided p value
of less than .05 considered significant.

Forty-two out of 100 screened patients were included in the trial (Appendix Figure 1). The two groups
were generally well balanced at baseline, although older and more women were enrolled in the CHM
plus group than the standard care alone group (Table 1). During the G-CHAMPS trial, supportive
measures of standard care were similar in the two groups (Appendix 1 protocol).
For the primary outcome, one patient from each group died during the first three days of treatment;
the odds of a shift towards death was lower in the CHM plus group than the standard care group
(common OR 0.589, 95% CI 0.148 to 2.352 P=.454; Figure 1).

For secondary outcomes, 11% (3/28) of

patients in the CHM plus group and 21% (3/14) of patients in the standard care alone group had no
clinical improvement (difference -10.71 (-35.07 to 13.64), P=0.3496) after treatment. More secondary
outcomes and safety outcomes were provided in Appendix Table 1-5.

Discussion
To our best knowledge, this is the first prospective randomized trial to investigate the effect of
NHC-NATCM-China guideline-based CHM in patients with severe COVID-19. In this trial, the odds of a
shift towards death or critically ill at 7 days after treatment was lower in the CHM plus group, at a
non-significant level. The result was collaborated with the universal normalization or near
normalization of leukocytes and different inflammatory markers. In a retrospective study with data of
1,099 patients with COVID-19, 5% of the patients were admitted to the ICU, 2% underwent invasive
mechanical ventilation, and 1% died; whereas the composite of these endpoints occurred in 25% of
the patients with severe disease(8). In our trial, 12% of the patients with severe COVID-19 required
ICU care and 5% died within 7 days. Disease severity is an important factor when considering
treatment for COVID-19 and likely contributed to the differences between these two studies. An

ongoing trial of Gilead Sciences’ Remdesivir utilized a category ordinal scale to define its primary
outcome (NCT04257656).
Although COVID-19 is caused by a virus and will heal without treatment in the majority of patients,
most patients in the G-CHAMPS trial received antibiotics. The percentages of antibiotic use are
comparable to the previous study (80%)(8).
Our study has several limitations, including an open-label design, a small sample size. Additionally, this
study lacks long term outcomes and the COVID-19 disease severity scale deserves further investigation.
Despite these substantial limitations, the G-CHAMPS trial provided an important opportunity to better
understand CHM for severe COVID-19.
For the first time, the G-CHAMPS trial provided valuable information for the national guideline-based
CHM treatment for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. As effective antiviral treatment is still
lacking for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread outside of China(9), all potentially effective
treatments including CHM worth vigorous further investigation.
