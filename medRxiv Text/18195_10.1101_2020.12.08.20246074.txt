Abstract

Understanding the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on
students’ health and financial stability is important to establish effective
interventions to mitigate these effects, which may have long-term consequences on
their health and wellbeing. Public universities in urban centers represent a
substantial proportion of college students in the United States. We implemented a
cross-sectional population-based online survey of 2,282 students in a large, public
university in New York City in April 2020. We created weights to account for nonresponse and used Poisson regression with robust standard errors to estimate
adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for factors associated with mental health
outcomes. Students experienced high rates of anxiety/depression and financial
instability due to the pandemic. Half of the students reported anxiety/depression
(54.5%) and an increased need for mental health services (49.0%) as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The majority (81.1%) reported loss of household income, and
half (49.8%) reported worries about losing housing. High levels of food (aPR=1.4,
95% CI 1.2, 1.6) and housing (aPR=1.3, 95% CI 1.2, 1.4) insecurity were the
strongest predictors of anxiety/depression. Household and personal experiences
with possible COVID-19 symptoms were also associated with anxiety/depression or
the need for increased mental health services. Addressing student needs at public
urban universities requires an integrated holistic approach that targets urgent
mental health and economic needs related to the impact of COVID-19. Students who
become infected need mental health services as well as health monitoring.

Introduction

In the United States (US), New York City (NYC) became the first epicenter of the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in late March 2020.1 During this
first wave in NYC, the epidemic peaked with an estimated seven-day rolling average
high of over 5,200 cases in early April 2020 and a death rate of 228 confirmed
COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people between March and August 2020;2 the true
death rate is likely higher.3 The primary public health response to the pandemic
promoted social distancing to reduce community transmission, including shifting to
online learning environments for schools and college campuses. The City University
of New York (CUNY), a public university with 25 campuses across the five boroughs
of NYC, officially closed its physical facilities and began virtual classes on March 19,
2020 in response to the pandemic.4

In 2019-2020, CUNY enrolled a large, diverse student body, with an estimated
274,000 matriculated students in programs that offer associate, baccalaureate or
graduate degrees. Many CUNY students come from low income households; in
2016, an estimated three in five CUNY undergraduates lived in households with
annual incomes of less than $30,000.5 At the same time, a number of CUNY
campuses rank highly among US colleges for the upward financial mobility of their
graduates.6 Further, about 40% of New York City’s 689,000 college students are
enrolled at CUNY.7 Understanding how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected their
health and wellbeing can inform interventions and policies to mitigate harm, with
implications for health, equity, economic development, higher education and social

justice in the region. These findings may also be applicable to other large public
urban universities across the country. We sought to investigate the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on CUNY students’ self-reported general and mental health, as
well as on their financial stability at the height of the first wave of the epidemic in
NYC.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of a representative sample of CUNY
students from April 14-22, 2020. The study was reviewed and approved by the
CUNY School of Public Health’s Institutional Review Board (Protocol #695980); the
survey began with informed consent, requiring participants to indicate consent
electronically prior to starting the survey. The first 1,000 respondents received a
$20 gift card for their participation by email, and five respondents among all who
participated were randomly selected to receive $100 gift cards.

Sample

In collaboration with the CUNY Office of Institutional Research, which maintains a
centralized database of CUNY students, we used simple random selection to select
10,000 students from the approximately 274,000 matriculated students in the
spring 2020 semester. Of those, 2,282 completed 70% or more of the entire survey
(response rate of 23%) and are included in this analysis. Given response bias, we
created sampling weights to account for non-response based on sex, race/ethnicity,

type of campus (undergraduate versus graduate), and full-time or part-time student
status; all measures available in the CUNY central database.

Survey instrument

The survey was pilot tested with five students to ensure comprehension and
readability and was designed to take 15 minutes to complete. The survey comprised
five domains: educational experience, household/living situation, economic impact,
health impact and socio-demographic characteristics; other socio-demographic and
student status data such as sex (categorized as male or female), race/ethnicity,
campus and full-time or part-time student status were taken from the centralized
student database. Items to assess health included a question on general health as
recalled at the beginning of the semester and at the time of the survey taken from
the Health Related Quality of Life Healthy Days Core Module (CDC HRQOL– 4),8 the
Patient Health questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) to measure anxiety and depression,9, 10 and
changes in patterns of substance use. Experiences with COVID-19 symptoms and
testing were also assessed. To measure economic impact, we included questions on
loss of income, changes in household expenses, food insecurity (adapted from the 6item USDA Food Security Survey),11 and concerns about housing costs. Each domain
primarily consisted of closed ended questions; all but the socio-demographic section
ended with an open-ended question for students to describe anything that was
missed about their experiences in their own words. Similarly questions that
allowed students to select more than one option included an ‘other’ category with
space for text, in case important response categories were missed. The current

analysis focuses on the health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
CUNY students; future analyses will focus on the effect on educational experiences.

Analysis

We present weighted estimates of socio-demographic characteristics by level of
students (graduate, bachelors or associate degree) as an overview of the CUNY
student population. Next we present weighted estimates of students’ reports on the
impact of the COVID-19 on health and economic measures. We used chi-squared
tests to compare reports on changes in substance use and anticipated graduation by
anxiety/depression. Finally, we conducted weighted multivariable Poisson
regression models with robust standard errors to estimate the prevalence ratios for
factors hypothesized to be associated with anxiety/depression, and an increased
need for mental health services as a result of the pandemic. For these models, we
explored bivariate associations with exposures to stressors including: concerns
about losing housing, reduced ability to buy needed food, students or household
members experiencing COVID-19-like symptoms, having a household member who
is a healthcare worker, being a parent or guardian, being a caretaker of adult(s) over
age 65, and whether students expected to graduate later than previously
anticipated, as hypothesized contributors to anxiety/depression. Changes to
substance use were not included, as we hypothesized that anxiety/depression may
have led to increased substance use. We also explored bivariate associations with
socio-demographic characteristics (sex, race/ethnicity, age) and student
characteristics (associates, bachelors or graduate; full-time versus part-time

student; New York City, New York state, other state or international residency
status) as potential confounders of our hypothesized exposures. No independent
variables in the final adjusted models were strongly correlated with one another
(correlation of 0.50 or greater). Final models include exposures associated with the
outcome at the bivariate level, which remained significant (p<0.05) in multivariable
models, after adjusting for race/ethnicity and age. Type of degree (associates,
bachelors or graduate), full-time versus part time student, residency status, being a
parent/guardian, and having a family member work in healthcare were not
significantly associated with anxiety/depression or increased need for mental
health in fully adjusted models and were not included in the final models.

For open-ended questions or ‘other’ response categories, we identified common
themes and had two independent reviewers code each quote in a blinded fashion
with discussion to resolve discrepancies. We present the frequency with which
themes about mental health and financial stability arose, and include illustrative
quotes to contextualize the quantitative findings and illuminate the lived
experiences of students.

Results

CUNY students are generally young (66.0% 18-25 years of age) and more female
than male (57.9% versus 42.1% respectively, Table 1). Over one quarter of students
are Hispanic (29.4%), followed by Black non-Hispanic (24.9%), White non-Hispanic
(23.0%), and Asian Pacific Islander (22.1%), with 0.4% American Indian/Native

Alaskan. Students enrolled in graduate, bachelor and associate degree programs
differ by socio-demographic characteristics such as female-male ratio, age and
race/ethnicity (Table 1). Only 1.9% of students reported living in school
dormitories prior to the pandemic, with the remainder in different types of offcampus living situations; living with a parent or relative (56.2%) or in their own
house/rental apartment (34.7%) were the most common.

Health outcomes

While only 8.2% reported that their general health had been fair/poor at the
beginning of the semester, 26.6% reported their general health as fair/poor at the
time of the survey, (Table 2), with no differences by type of degree (not shown).
More than one quarter (29.4%) reported experiencing symptoms that could be
COVID-19, of whom only 15.4% were tested. Among all students, 5.8% were tested
for COVID-19 of whom 29.1% reported a positive result (at the time of the survey,
testing was not widely available in New York City12). More than a quarter (29.5%)
of students also reported someone in their household had experienced symptoms
that could be COVID-19.

More than half of students (54.5%) reported experiencing anxiety and/or
depression, with 43.2% reporting anxiety and 42.2% depression. Feeling
overwhelmed, anxious, and/or depressed was also a common theme identified in
open-ended questions. When asked, to describe other effects of the coronavirus on
their educational experience in an open-ended question, 37.3% of the participants

responded. Mental health was identified as a theme in 26.8% of these responses.
One student described it this way, “I have this feeling of impending doom like world
war three will start, I’m scared.”

Almost half (49.0%) reported an increased need for mental health services to help
cope with stress, anxiety or depression due to the pandemic. Some students
reported increased substance use in response to the pandemic: 13.6% reported
increased usage of alcohol, 8.1% marijuana, 4.0% vaping, and 3.4% cigarette
smoking. Students who had anxiety/depression were two to three times as likely to
report an increase in substance use as those not reporting anxiety/depression:
alcohol usage (17.8% versus 8.3%, p<0.01), marijuana use (10.6% versus 4.9%,
p<.01), vaping (5.8% versus 1.9%, p<.01) and cigarette smoking (4.5% versus 2.1%,
p<0.01).

More than half of students (56.8%) reported their ability to do schoolwork
decreased as a result of the pandemic, of whom 73.4% identified their mental state
as a reason for this decrease. This belief was also identified in open-ended
responses. When asked, “What has affected your ability to do schoolwork,” 4.5%
(n=102) selected “other” and provided text responses, of which 30.4% were coded
as mental health-related. One student wrote, “My mind wanders too much because I
am anxious.” Another student explained, “It is mentally exhausting not knowing
what’s happening. Not knowing what the future holds.” One quarter (26.2%)
reported expecting to graduate later than anticipated as a result of the pandemic,

and another 29.3% were uncertain of its impact on graduation date (Table 2).
Those experiencing anxiety/depression were more likely to report anticipating
graduating later than expected than those not reporting anxiety/depression (32.1%
versus 19.2%, p<0.01).

Economic outcomes

The majority of students (81.1%) reported that they (54.1%) and/or someone else
in their household (68.9%) lost income as a result of the pandemic. Nearly half
(47.8%) reported their weekly household expenses increased, with 21.2% reporting
a decrease in weekly expenses and 30.9% no change. The biggest increases in
household expenses reported were an increase in the cost of cleaning supplies
(72.9%) and food costs (71.4%), followed by an increase in the cost of support for
family members outside of the household (37.4%), entertainment (30.8%), and
medical costs (28.8%).

Half of the students (49.8%) reported being very or somewhat worried about losing
their housing as a result of the pandemic and about half reported experiencing some
forms of food insecurity in the two weeks preceding the survey (Table 2). For
example, 13.2% reported often and 37.0% sometimes being worried they would run
out of food before being able to afford more, and 4.5% often and 13.3% sometimes
had gone hungry for lack of access to food. Sixty percent (60.0%) reported their
household’s ability to purchase food had been reduced a lot (24.1%) or somewhat
(35.9%) as a result of the pandemic. Food insecurity was identified as a theme in

open-ended responses as well. For example, when asked about other ways the
coronavirus has affected their current living situation, of the 21.6% who responded
(n=493), 9.7% of the responses were coded as relating to food insecurity. One
student reported, “Since the epidemic began, unfortunately only my uncle is
working and we are trying to make ends meet with the rent and the utility bills. It’s
been stressful because some days we eat less just to be cautious of how much
money is being spent.”

Students also identified general financial concerns. Among the 21.6% who
described other ways the coronavirus has affected their current living conditions,
61.1% of the responses were coded as financial concerns. One student explained,
“My mom has been reduced to working 10-15 hours, risking her health to pay her
rent which hasn’t been postponed. She has no health care, so my income is going to
her for her to pay for food and rent.” Another student reported, “I’m not sure how
long I’ll be employed. While I work additional hours online now, there is no
guarantee that I’ll be working much longer. My landlady isn’t exactly understanding
so there is a chance that eviction could be an issue.”

Factors associated with anxiety/depression and increased need for mental health
services

Females were 1.4 (95% confidence intervals CIs, 1.2, 1.5) times as likely as males to
report anxiety/depression, with no significant differences by age (Table 3).
Financial stressors—the ability to buy food reduced by a lot (aPR=1.4, 95% CIs 1.2,
11

1.6) and being very worried about losing housing (aPR=1.3, 95% CIs 1.2, 1.4)—and
expecting to graduate later than originally planned (aPR=1.3, 95% CIs 1.1, 1.4) had
the strongest associations with anxiety/depression in adjusted models. Being a
caretaker for an adult over the age of 65 (aPR=1.2, 95% CIs 1.1, 1.4) and having a
household member who experienced COVID-like symptoms (aPR=1.2, 95% CIs 1.1,
1.3) were also associated with anxiety/depression. Similarly, financial stressors and
being female were the exposures with the strongest association with reporting an
increased need for mental health support (Table 2). Reports of needing an
increased level of mental health support were associated with the student
experiencing COVID-like symptoms (aPR=1.2, 95% CIs 1.1, 1.3), rather than a
household member experiencing symptoms.

The synergistic impact of financial stressors, health of family members, and one’s
own health on respondents’ mental health was also evident in many of the openended responses. One student explained the relationship between mental health
and financial stressors as follows, “Being fired from my job gives me plenty of free
time but causes many panic attacks. I am very stressed and scared for my health
and my family as well. Financially we’ve been struggling a lot.” In talking about the
health of family members, a student explained, “I find it extremely difficult to
concentrate because I am in constant fear my child or my elderly parents are going
to die...” Another student described coping with loss, “My father passed away
because of the virus. It has been really hard because he was my everything…” One
student described why the virus was stressful for her, “During the time I believed I

had the virus, I was very worried and unable to focus. Now is mostly a concern
about how long this will go on and will it affect my ability to take care of my family
financially.”

Discussion

In April 2020, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was high among CUNY
students—more than double the estimate of these conditions from a representative
survey of CUNY students in 2018.13 This finding is consistent with national studies
indicating elevated levels of depression and anxiety among adults as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic.14 Furthermore, CUNY students reported high levels of
economic instability, with a high percentage reporting loss of household income,
concerns about housing, and food insecurity. Many students were also concerned
about delays to graduation as a result of the pandemic. Previous studies have
shown that food insecurity, depression and anxiety can undermine academic
success.15-17 The significant increase in these conditions among college students
found in our survey and other studies on the impact of the COVID-1918 suggest that
the pandemic may disrupt the progress of many students in completing their college
degrees, a credential that offers lifetime health, economic and social benefits.19

In multivariable models, concerns about the ability to pay for housing and food, the
student or someone in their household experiencing possible COVID-19 symptoms,
and caretaking for adults over the age of 65 were associated with worse mental
health outcomes. These findings are consistent with a study of medical college
13

students in China during the COVID-19 pandemic, which found that family economic
stability was associated with reduced levels of anxiety, and being sick or having a
family member be sick were associated with increased anxiety levels.20 Findings are
also consistent with a study conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), which found that, for young adults, being an unpaid caretaker
was associated with poor mental health outcomes during the first wave of the
COVID-19 pandemic.14 Females generally have higher rates of anxiety/depression
then males in the general population21 and tend to have higher caretaking
responsibilities22 which may explain our finding that females were at higher risk for
anxiety/depression than males.

Our study has a number of limitations. Recall bias may have affected students’
reports on general health at the beginning of the semester. We collected crosssectional data in April 2020 prior to the first stimulus bill, which temporarily
increased unemployment benefits. The financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
is changing, and students may be experiencing different levels of financial instability
given the temporal changes to available benefits. We had a 23% response rate,
which may introduce bias in our results, even with the creation of non-response
weights. Finally, our study is cross-sectional, and thus factors associated with
mental health outcomes may not be causal. We note, however, that there is a
plausible mechanism by which financial stressors, dealing with COVID-19 illness,
being a caretaker and worries about delays in graduation could lead to poor mental

health and many of the open-ended responses support the direction of these
associations.

Our results suggest that to mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on low-income urban college students requires a multi-pronged approach. First,
universities need to ensure that students have access to campus, community and
telehealth mental health services. In our study, students with anxiety/depression
were more likely to report increased substance use and increased anxiety around
delays to graduation, than those not experiencing anxiety/depression, highlighting
the importance of reaching these students. Even before the pandemic, college
students and other young adults often had limited access to affordable mental
health services;23 this problem likely has been exacerbated by COVID-19. Despite
the need to ensure remote services during COVID-19, a review of 138 college
websites in the NYC metropolitan area found that only half included information on
how students could access remote mental health services.24

Ensuring access to mental health services may not be sufficient to address high rates
of anxiety/depression without also addressing basic needs. The fact that a sizable
proportion of CUNY students are experiencing financial instability including fear of
losing housing and food insecurity needs to be addressed. These findings likely
apply to many college students in public universities in the United States. A study of
651 college students in a large state-funded university in Texas, found 34.5% of
their students reported food insecurity in the month prior to the survey, with those

indicating loss of income and changes in living situations due to the COVID-19
pandemic at the highest risk for food insecurity.25 Interventions to address these
concerns include expansion of federal eligibility and benefit levels, simplifying the
process for college students to enroll in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
(SNAP) and other public benefits, increasing access to financial aid, moving toward
free college tuition, maintaining supplemental cost of living expenses to
unemployment benefits and/or implementing a universal basic income.

Delays to graduation caused by the pandemic at institutions such as CUNY, which
serves a high proportion of low income and Black and Hispanic students, could
further exacerbate existing economic disparities and social inequities.
Implementation of new policies and programs to increase college student access to
mental health services and public benefits can help to prevent these inequities from
growing. Finally, while becoming infected with COVID-19 takes a toll on students
and their loved ones physically, the mental health aspect of becoming infected or
thinking one may be infected cannot be ignored. We found a substantial increase in
students reporting their general health was poor or fair as a result of the pandemic.

Public Health Implications

Much of the public discussion of COVID-19 on campuses has emphasized the role of
the pandemic on community transmission of infection.26 However, the majority of
US college students do not attend residential campuses, but rather go to community
colleges or local campuses and live at home with their families or peers.27 As a

population, CUNY students more resemble the majority of US college students than
those attending private institutions with on-campus housing. Thus, preventing
further increases to and mitigating the consequences of spikes in food and housing
insecurity, depression, and anxiety among college students such as those at CUNY
can contribute both to mitigating the effects of the pandemic and to achieving
national health and equity goals.
