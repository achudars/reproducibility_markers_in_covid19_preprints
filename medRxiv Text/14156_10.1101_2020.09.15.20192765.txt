Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically impacted work, economy, and way of life worldwide in 2020.
Sensitive measurement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies would provide new insight into pre-existing
immunity, virus transmission dynamics, and the nuances of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. To date, existing
SARS-CoV-2 serology tests have limited utility due to insufficient reliable detection of antibody levels lower
than what is typically present after several days of symptoms. To measure lower quantities of SARS-CoV-2
IgM, IgG, and IgA with higher resolution than existing assays, we developed a new ELISA protocol with a
distinct plate washing procedure and timed plate development via use of a standard curve. This ‘BU ELISA’
method exhibits very low signal from samples added to buffer coated wells at as low as a 1:5 dilution. Use of
this method revealed circulating SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (N)
reactive antibodies (IgG, IgM, and/or IgA) in 44 and 100 percent of pre-pandemic subjects, respectively, and
the magnitude of these antibodies tracked with antibody levels of analogous viral proteins from the 229E and/or
NL63 endemic coronavirus (eCoV) strains. The disease status (HIV, SLE) of unexposed subjects was not linked
with SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibody levels; however, quantities were significantly lower in subjects over 70
years of age compared with younger counterparts. Also, we measured SARS-CoV-2 RBD- and N- specific IgM,
IgG, and IgA antibodies from 29 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals at varying disease states, including 10 acute
COVID-19 hospitalized subjects with negative serology results by the EUA approved Abbott IgG
chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Measurements of SARS-CoV-2 RBD- and N- specific IgM,
IgG, IgA levels measured by the BU ELISA revealed higher signal from 9 of the 10 Abbott test negative
COVID-19 subjects than all pre-pandemic samples for at least one antibody specificity/isotype, implicating
improved serologic identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection via multi-parameter, high sensitive antibody
detection. We propose that this improved ELISA protocol, which is straightforward to perform, low cost, and
uses readily available commercial reagents, is a useful tool to elucidate new information about SARS-CoV-2
infection and immunity and has promising implications for improved detection of all analytes measurable by
this platform.

Introduction
From the first reported case of COVID-19 caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019

1,2

there have

been more than 76 million reported cases and 1.69 million deaths worldwide as of December 20, 2020.
Common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection include fever, cough, myalgia, and fatigue and these symptoms
vary widely in magnitude, nature, and duration between individuals for reasons that are not clear to date 3,4, with
some individuals with confirmed infections remaining asymptomatic 5. Epidemiological evidence indicates
silent viral spread via asymptomatic individuals within communities and the extent of this form of transmission
is currently unclear 6. SARS-CoV-2 has homology to other alpha and beta ‘common cold’ endemic
coronaviruses (eCoVs) in circulation, and cross-reactive T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and
nucleocapsid (N) proteins are present in a substantial percentage of unexposed individuals

7-10

. Also, reactive

antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins are present in unexposed individuals, with virus neutralization
activity reported from pre-pandemic pediatric samples

11,12

. It is postulated that this cross-reactive immunity

may influence the nature and severity of COVID-19 symptoms upon infection and impact disease course 13 and
may impact herd immunity.

Sensitive and accurate detection of virus-specific immune factors, such as antibodies, is imperative in order to
measure rates of SARS-CoV-2 infections within communities with greater accuracy, to more fully define crossreactive immunity in unexposed individuals, and to gain new understanding about the nature of effective versus
potentially deleterious immune responses upon SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Antibody measurements are of
particular importance, as pathogen-specific immunoglobulins are a known first line of defense upon exposure
and can prevent new infections. Antibody titers are used to assess both likelihood of protection from reinfection and general vaccine efficacy 14. A variety of SARS-CoV-2 serological assays have been developed by
multiple manufacturers and academic institutes and many are CE-marked and granted emergency use
authorization (EUA) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Varieties include point-of-care rapid
lateral flow assays, chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA), multi-plex bead/cell based-assays15,16, and

enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)17-20. These tests detect antibodies that primarily target the
nucleocapsid protein (N) or the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, and specifically the Receptor Binding
Domain (RBD) of spike which is an immunodominant surface protein targeted by neutralizing antibodies and a
main target antigen for vaccine development

20-22

. Some of these tests possess high sensitivity and specificity

for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 14 days after diagnosis and/or symptom onset

23-26

. However, others

report negative results from individuals who are asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic, or symptomatic for less
than 14 days, even when SARS-CoV-2 infection is confirmed

19,27,28

; whether such individuals possess

antibodies below the limit of the detection of the particular test used or lack these antibodies altogether is
unresolved.

To enable detection of low levels of SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies, we modified the standard ELISA
procedure, particularly the plate washing method, to improve sensitivity. Our protocol (the ‘BU ELISA’) allows
clear SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibody signal resolution at sample dilutions as low as 1:5. Using this protocol we
measured the levels of SARS-CoV-2-reactive IgM, IgG, and IgA from plasma or serum from three groups of
individuals: (1) 71 subjects that varied by age, HIV infection, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease
status with all samples collected before November 8th, 2019 (‘pre-pandemic’); (2) 20 subjects hospitalized with
COVID-19 (‘Acute’) (3) nine subjects with samples collected three-six months after confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection (‘Convalescent’). In addition, the performance of the BU ELISA, Antagen’s IgM IgG Lateral Flow
Device (LFD) test and the Abbott IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) were directly
compared from samples from the three subject groups.

Results
A modified ELISA protocol demonstrates low noise from high concentration human serum and plasma
samples. The Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) is a commonly used method for the
measurement of analytes in a suspension sample. While low cost and easy to adapt in most lab settings, a
limitation of this platform is high background from some biological samples at low sample dilutions.

Specifically, optical densities (ODs) from sample dilutions lower than 1:100 is often sizeable and can mask the
analyte of interest. This issue is particularly germane to serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2, as antibodies that
are cross-reactive in unexposed individuals, newly generated in asymptomatic and/or recent infections, induced
from an encounter with low viral dose, or waned post convalescence may be missed because levels are below
the limit of detection of current assays. To address this issue, we have developed an ELISA protocol with
unique steps to reduce non-specific signal at low sample dilutions. One change is the plate washing procedure,
which is performed manually by an operator using a multichannel pipettor and includes agitation and soaking
steps with repeated complete removal of residual fluid as described (Methods and Supplemental Figure 1).
ELISAs were performed that compared buffer coated well OD values of five human plasma samples with plates
washed with our method or an automated plate washer and the total levels of non-specifically bound IgG was
determined. The manual washing procedure resulted in a notably lower average and range of ODs at 1:5, 1:10,
and 1:25 dilutions as compared with the automated washer (Figure 1A). This BU ELISA protocol was run on
samples from a total of 71 pre-pandemic and 29 SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects (Table 1), with paired antigen
coated and buffer coated wells for six or seven sample dilutions (Supplemental Figure 1) for all subjects. The
average ODs for buffer coated, 1:5 diluted sample loaded wells from all subject samples measured at this
dilution were 0.16, 0.098, and 0.076 for IgM, IgG, and IgA respectively (Figure 1B). Given these low
background OD values and the results from the wash method comparison, it’s possible that details of our
protocol other than the washing method may contribute to these low background ODs, such as the type of
plates, the blocking buffer/sample diluent used, and the number and placement of washing steps (Methods and
Supplemental Figure 1). This buffer only coat ‘noise’ is remarkably consistent between multiple runs of a given
sample (Supplemental Figure 2) and appears to be due to components within the sample, such as IgG and
inflammatory factors29 and not due to assay variability. Importantly, when ODs from uncoated wells with the
same dilution of sample are not measured and properly subtracted, incorrect interpretation of results as positive
can occur30; therefore, the no coat values were subtracted from coated OD results for all results to determine the
true antigen-specific signal. Also, detection antibodies were tested for specificity to confirm accuracy of

isotype-specific readouts and the ability of our IgG detection reagent to measure all four IgG subclasses
(Supplemental Figure 3).

Modification of ELISA development duration based on standard curve signal detection enables accurate
comparison of antibody levels between experimental runs by minimizing impact of OD drift. During
assay development we noted differences in OD values in different experimental runs even with strict adherence
to all procedures and length of steps. Therefore, for all sample runs, we included a standard curve using
recombinant monoclonal IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies that recognize SARS-CoV-2 RBD for each of the
respective isotype assays and stopped the development reaction when there was a visible difference between the
seventh dilution (1.37ng/ml) of the standard and the ‘zero’ (sample diluent only) well. Addition of these
standards and timing of development in this manner helped to ensure accurate calculation of the relative
antibody levels (termed ‘Arbitrary Units’ on a ng/ml scale, calculated as described in Methods) between
samples run on different days, plates, and/or by different operators. The OD values of the standard curves
following this development procedure for the IgM, IgG, and IgA assays for 15 representative runs are shown
(Figure 1C). The development time of these runs to complete visualization of the standard curve development
ranged from ~8-30 minutes, demonstrating the need to adjust substrate incubation time per experimental run to
maximize signal detection.

SARS-CoV-2 RBD-reactive antibodies were detected at low levels in 44 percent of pre-pandemic samples.
SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgM, IgG, and IgA ELISA assays were performed on 40, 71, and 40 pre-pandemic samples,
respectively (Table 1) using the BU ELISA protocol. The OD curves from the BU ELISA for both the buffer
coat and SARS-CoV-2 RBD coated wells (after first subtracting the blank well(s) with paired coat) from seven
pre-pandemic subjects for IgM, IgG, and/or IgA is shown (Figure 2A). There is clear RBD-specific signal with
with a linear loss of OD with sample dilution, providing evidence of true specific signal (Figure 2A). The
calculated Arbitrary Units (AUs) from the buffer only and antigen coated wells from these curves is shown
beneath each respective isotype graph. We defined a subject as positive for a given antibody readout as follows:

the OD value from the RBD-coated well ≥2.5x the uncoated well from the paired sample dilution for at least
two dilutions in the series and ≥0.1 for at least one dilution. Following this guideline, 31/71 of the unexposed
individuals possessed reactive antibodies of at least one isotype to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, albeit all at very low
levels in the circulation (~40 ng/ml) (Figure 2B). We compared the calculated AUs from IgG reactive to SARSCoV-2 Spike (S) and RBD from 14 pre-pandemic subjects and found no significant correlation (Supplemental
Figure 4). These results could be due to differences in portions and/or presentation of the RBD antigen in the
different tests.

All pre-pandemic subjects contained circulating SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) IgG and/or IgA
antibodies with a wide range of levels found between individuals. Using the BU ELISA protocol, we
measured IgM, IgG, and IgA levels reactive with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N) from 20, 53, and 20
subjects from our pre-pandemic cohort, respectively. Seven dilutions were run for all samples with and without
N coated wells as with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD assays; sample dilution curves were generated, and positive
results were determined using Metric 1 and AUs calculated. A wide range of pre-existing antibody levels were
found; for example, the IgG levels range from 0.0134 to 54 µg/ml (Figure 2C).

No correlation between levels of cross-reactive SARS-COV-2 antibodies to RBD and N antigens. We
compared the levels of SARS-COV-2 RBD- and N- reactive antibodies between individual pre-pandemic
subjects in our cohort and found no correlation between the two readouts (Figure 2D). This suggests these
antibodies to different portions of SARS-CoV-2 are elicited during distinct immune responses.

IgG reactive with SARS-CoV-2 RBD and N in pre-pandemic samples correlate with immunity to NL63
and both NL63 and 229E eCoV strains, respectively. To determine if antibodies elicited by endemic
coronavirus (eCoV) infections are linked to antibodies reactive to SARS-CoV-2 in unexposed subjects, IgG
specific for NL63 and HKU1 RBD proteins, and IgG reactive with the N protein from all four eCoV strains in

the circulation (NL63, HKU1, 229E and OC43) were measured. The levels of antibodies to eCoV RBD and N
proteins in pre-pandemic samples showed general differences, with more IgG reactive to HKU1 than NL63
RBDs among the subjects and similar levels of IgG reactive with N proteins of the NL63, 229E, and OC43
strains, with lower levels reactive with the HKU1 N (Figure 3A). IgG reactive with SARS-CoV-2 RBD
significantly correlated with NL63 and not HKU1 RBD-specific IgG (Figure 3B) and IgG reactive with SARSCoV-2 N correlated with NL63 and 229E but not HKU1 or OC43 N-specific IgG (Figure 3C). Taken together,
these results suggest previous coronavirus infections with the NL63 and 229E strains elicit SARS-CoV-2 crossreactive antibody immunity.

HIV or SLE disease status does not impact SARS-CoV-2 reactive RBD and N antibody levels in
unexposed individuals. We next compared the levels of eCoV and/or SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies in our
pre-pandemic cohort with the subjects re-classified by HIV and SLE status. We found lower levels of NL63
RBD-reactive IgG in HIV+ as compared to uninfected subjects (Figure 4A); however, there were no other
differences found between the antibody levels reactive to the RBD or N proteins, for either the eCoV strains or
SARS-CoV-2, between groups classified via HIV or SLE status (Figure 4A, B).

Unexposed individuals over 70 years old have significantly lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and N
reactive IgG than younger counterparts. We next re-categorized our pre-pandemic cohort into two groups by
age, <70yo (n=29-59) and >70 yo (n=12). All eCoV and SARS-CoV-2 reactive IgG levels measured were
lower in the >70yo group, with high significance for SARS-CoV-2 RBD (p=.0007) and N (p=.0045). It should
be noted that comparisons of younger (<35yo) and middle aged (40-65yo) groups did not yield notable
differences (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that age may impact the magnitude of eCoV
and SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibody immunity more than a chronic viral infection (HIV) or an
autoimmune disease (SLE).

Comparison of SARS-COV-2 specific RBD and N antibody levels between hospitalized COVID-19
subjects with acute disease and convalescent survivors of infection. We next used the BU ELISA to
measure the IgM, IgG, and IgA RBD- and N-specific antibodies from individuals at different times and
magnitudes of severity after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 20 COVID-19 hospitalized subjects (Acutes), 10
scored negative and 10 positive on the EUA approved Abbott SARS-CoV-2 N-specific IgG CMIA. RBD- and
N- specific IgM and IgA was higher in all Acutes as compared with the Convalescent subjects, but IgG levels
were similar, suggesting waning of IgM and IgA over time or reduced induction of these isotypes in subjects
that do not require hospitalization (Figure 5A). Also, RBD- and N- specific IgG levels significantly correlate
among all COVID-19 subjects in the study (n=29) and IgM and IgA also trend in a similar manner (Figure 5B).

Comparison of RBD- and N-specific antibody levels measured by the BU ELISA from hospitalized, acute
COVID-19 subjects with positive versus negative Abbott test results. Next, we compared the RBD- and NSARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels detected from the BU ELISA between Acute subjects with negative or
positive Abbott IgG test results. The BU ELISA detected reactive antibodies from all samples, with all the
Abbot test positive subjects with AU values above the pre-pandemic range for RBD and N- specific IgG (Figure
5C). The AU values for six Abbott test negative subjects were above the pre-pandemic range for RBD- specific
IgM and for N-specific IgA, and two Abbott test negative subjects have RBD-specific IgG above the prepandemic range (Figure 5C), indicating serological evidence of infection in many of these subjects.

Evidence of diversity of adaptive B cell response induction among acutely infected, hospitalized COVID19+ subjects. Next, we compared the levels of RBD- and N- reactive IgM, IgG and IgA from our cohort of
acute COVID-19 subjects, and found general trends showing higher antibody levels with more days of
symptoms; however, some subjects have pre-pandemic levels of RBD and/or N- reactive IgG, even after as long
as 40 days symptomatic (Figure 5D, E).

Combinational analysis of readouts by the BU ELISA reveal SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibody levels are
significantly higher in acutely infected COVID-19+ subjects with negative Abbott test results than prepandemics. Next, we compared the combined AU values of both RBD- reactive IgM and N- reactive IgA and
all six readouts performed and found significant differences between the pre-pandemic and acute Abbott test
negative groups, as well as between acute Abbott test negative versus positive groups (Figures 5F, G). These
results indicate that multi-parameter detection, comprised of multiple isotypes and antigen reactivities from a
sensitive serology test, could improve serologic diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Three-way comparison of the BU ELISA results with the Antagen LFD and Abbott CMIA reveal 9 of 10
Abbott test negative COVID-19 subjects exhibit SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels above all prepandemic samples for at least one readout by the BU ELISA. The AU values from 10 pre-pandemic
subjects with highest AU values for SARS-CoV-2 RBD and/or N-reactive IgG were directly compared with
results from the Abbott CMIA assay and a lateral flow rapid test (Antagen Pharmaceuticals). The Abbott CMIA
test measures IgG reactive to SARS-CoV-2 N, and the Antagen LFD test measures SARS-CoV-2 RBD-reactive
IgG and IgM. Both commercial tests detected no SARS-CoV-2 reactive IgG in the pre-pandemic samples, and
correctly identified the infection status of all subjects within the convalescent group (Table 2). Among the
Acute subjects, of the 10 samples that scored positive by the Abbott test, they were also positive by the LFD test
for IgG. Of the 10 Acute subjects that scored negative on the Abbott test, the LFD test successfully identified
5/10 subjects as SARS-COV-2 antibody positive for IgG and/or IgM (Table 2). Also, nine of 10 acute COVID19 subjects that scored negative on the Abbott test have AU values above all pre-pandemics tested for at least
one of the six BU ELISA readouts (all but Subject A4).

Discussion
Accurate and sensitive measurement of virus-specific antibodies could complement diagnostic testing, provide
information about the true prevalence of infection, provide insight into anti-viral immunity, and help assess
vaccine responses. However, a lack of required sensitivity and specificity of many of the SARS-CoV-2

antibody tests available to date have led some to conclude that they have limited clinical utility in combating
COVID-19 31. Here, we present a modified ELISA protocol with exceptional sensitivity with high concentration
samples that enables the detection of low levels of antigen-specific antibodies in human specimens.

The BU ELISA is straightforward, comprised of reagents that are readily available from commercial vendors
and can easily be adapted for other applications and analytes. However, a limitation of this assay is that it is
currently considerably lower in throughput compared to other serological platforms. This protocol requires an
operator for the manual wash steps, limiting the number of plates that can be run compared to automated
methods, however, there is potential for throughput increase if automated washers/ELISA systems can be
adapted to more closely mimic this protocol.

Other important features of our approach include the inclusion of paired sample dilutions with buffer only
coated wells to enable detection of true antigen-reactive signal and adjustment of the length of substrate
incubation time based on standard curve development for OD standardization to enable direct comparison
between samples on different plates. Quantification of relative antibody levels via Arbitrary Units (AU) or a
similar method will be imperative for determining which convalescent samples have antibody levels sufficient
for effective plasma transfer as well as other applications. However, while we believe this is a preferred
approach for determining of relative output values within all samples, it is critical to note that the unique
dynamics of the panoply of antibodies of varying affinities and isotypes within a given specimen causes
inherent confounding factors to serologic readouts. For example, a specimen with a high level of SARS-CoV-2
RBD reactive IgM antibodies could have a lower detected signal for IgG and IgA due to IgM’s pentameric
conformation blocking many binding sites. Also, higher affinity antibody clones (IgG and IgA vs IgM, for
example) may outcompete for binding sites of the coated antigen and thereby be detected more readily than
others. We can account for this issue to some extent via measurement of all three major isotypes in all samples.

Here, we report links between antibody responses to endemic coronavirus (eCoV) strains and levels of crossreactive antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 in unexposed individuals. These results support recent reports of SARSCoV-2 T cell responses correlating with eCoV T memory in pre-pandemic samples.. Importantly, hospitalized
COVID-19 subjects with recent eCoV infections were significantly less likely to require the ICU or die 32, and
blood samples from virally unexposed children were found to possess neutralization activity against SARSCoV-2

11

. These results collectively implicate past eCoV infections with protection from severe outcomes to

COVID-19 due to cross-reactive immunity, including antibodies. We found widely varying quantities of SARSCoV-2 reactive N IgG within our pre-pandemic cohort, an agreement with another study

12

and reports of N-

specific T cell immunity in unexposed subjects 7-10. The magnitude and signature of one’s eCoV immunity may
partially explain the profound diversity of outcomes that occurs upon SARS-COV-2 infection. Therefore,
screening for this cross-reactive immunity may provide new insight into an individual’s risk of serious COVID19.

44 percent of the pre-pandemic subjects possessed antibodies that bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, albeit at very low
levels. These results are in contrast with the conclusions of other reports, which state that RBD-reactive
antibodies are not detected in unexposed individuals

17,20

. However, in these studies the assays were run at

higher sample dilutions and therefore low signal may have been missed or misinterpreted as noise. While these
RBD-reactive antibody levels are low in the blood, it is possible that they are present in higher concentrations in
other sites, such as the mucosa. Also, as antibodies to RBD are associated with virus neutralization both in vitro
and in animal models,

18,33-35

performing detailed functional analyses of plasma samples from pre-pandemic

samples with RBD-reactive antibodies is an important next step. Preliminary experiments from our group
indicated that neutralization activity was not present in four subjects (data not shown) but future experiments
are needed to more thoroughly address this question.

Individuals over 70 years of age possessed lower levels of both eCoV and cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2
antibodies (Figure 4C). A study comparing pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cell immunity in different age

serious COVID-19 complications 37-40 future research investigating connections between age, eCoV and SARSCoV-2 reactive immunity, and vulnerability to severe COVID-19 is warranted.

Direct comparison of our ELISA protocol with two commercially available serological assays for SARS-CoV2, Antagen’s LFD test and Abbott’s CMIA IgG assay yielded interesting results. Both the LFD and CMIA
performed well in identification of the convalescent subjects via detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG to RBD
(Antagen test) and N (Abbott test), and the BU ELISA detected signal from many pre-pandemic samples which
all scored negative in the Antagen and Abbott tests (Table II). However, these commercial tests are specifically
designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, unlike the BU ELISA which is measuring all SARS-CoV-2 reactive
antibodies; therefore, it is possible the antigens have been modified in the commercial assays to minimize crossreactive antibody detection, designated as noise in these tests. Interestingly, of the 10 acute subjects that scored
negative on the Abbott test, five scored positive for IgM and/or IgG by the LFD test. Also, of the six
parameters measured by the BU ELISA, AU values were higher than all pre-pandemic samples for at least one
readout for 9/10 subjects. Taken together, these results indicate multi-parameter detection of SARS-CoV-2
reactive antibodies with sensitive tests may improve use of serologic data for diagnostics.

The BU ELISA protocol enables the measurement of low levels of antigen-specific antibodies within high
concentration human specimens. Use of this assay could provide new insight into viral transmission and help
elucidate the nature of the virus-specific antibody response. Also, this protocol may complement other tests for
diagnostics, measurements of COVID-19 vaccine responses, screening of convalescent plasma for clinical use,
and perhaps most importantly, to accurately determine a history of exposure to SARS-COV-2.

Participants: Pre-pandemics: Samples were collected for unrelated studies prior to December 2019. Acutes:
de-identified samples from hospitalized patients at Boston Medical Center with confirmed PCR positivity for
SARS-CoV-2. Samples were collected at various timepoints after onset of symptoms. Convalescent: Subjects
were recruited by contacting individuals who had been confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection through their
exposure at a biomedical conference in March 2020. None were hospitalized. Samples were collected 3-6
months after positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Samples were collected and/or used in this study with proper IRB
approval from the Boston University Institutional Review Board.

The BU ELISA Protocol: Antibodies reactive to all four eCoV2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD or N were assayed
from sera or plasma as described in accompanying SOP (Supplemental Figure 1). Briefly, wells of 96-well
plates (Pierce 96-Well Polystyrene Plates; cat#15041, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with 50µl/well of
a 2µg/ml solution of each respective protein in sterile PBS (Gibco) or with PBS only for 1 hour at room
temperature. Coating solution was removed manually by a swift flick of the plates into a biohazard waste
container. Next, 200µl per well of sterile PBS was added with a multichannel pipettor and liquid was removed
via swift flick and the plate was banged on absorbent paper towels to remove residual liquid; this washing
procedure was performed three times. Next, 200µl of casein blocking buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
cat#37528) was added to wells at room temperature for 1 hour. Next, plates were washed three times as
previously described. Subject samples and monoclonal SARS-CoV-2 RBD reactive antibodies (IgG, clone
CR3022, gift from the Ragon Institute; IgA, clone CR3022, Absolute Antibodies; IgM, clone BIB116, Creative
Diagnostics) were diluted in Thermo Fisher casein blocking buffer, and 50µl of each were added to the plates
for 1 hour at room temperature, with dilution buffer only added to blank wells. After incubation, samples were
removed by a swift flick into a biohazard waste container. The plates were again washed three times with PBS
containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and banged on absorbent paper towels, and immediately anti-human
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies for IgG (cat#A18817, Thermo Fisher, 1:2000),
IgM (cat#A18841, Thermo Fisher, 1:8000), and IgA (Jackson Immunoresearch, cat#109-035-011, 1:2000)
diluted in casein blocking buffer were added to the plates at 50µl per well for 30 minutes at room temperature.

Next, plates were washed four times with 0.05% PBST as described, and 50µl per well of 3,3’,5,5’Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)-ELISA substrate solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# 34029) was added and
incubation occurred in the dark until a visible color difference between the well with the seventh dilution
(1.37ng/ml) of recombinant antibody and the diluent only ‘zero’ well appeared, this time ranged from ~8-20
minutes. The reaction was stopped by adding 50µl of stop solution for TMB (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
cat#N600) and the optical density was measured 450 nm (OD 450nm) on a SpectraMax190 Microplate Reader
(Molecular Devices). Seven-point sample dilution curves were run in uncoated wells and paired antigen coated
wells (SARS-CoV-2 RBD and NP). An example of a plate map shown in Supplemental Figure 1.

Antigens: SARS-CoV-2 RBD was a gift from the Schmidt lab at the Ragon Institute and was expressed and
purified as previously described

41

. SARS-CoV-2 N (Cat# 40588-V08B) and S (Cat# 40591-V08H), NL63 N

(Cat# 40641-V07E), 229E N (Cat# 40640-V07E), OC43 N (Cat# 40643-V07E) and HKU1 N (Cat# 40641V07E) was purchased from Sino Biological. Histidine-tagged NL63 and HKU1 RBD sequences were inserted
into plasmid vector VRc (gift from the Schmidt lab at the Ragon Institute) and was expressed in 293 Freestyle
cells (293F, ThermoFisher) and purified on Ni-NTA resin as previously described 42 (ref).

Determination of Arbitrary Units: Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8. Arbitrary units (AU) on a
ng/ml scale were calculated from the optical density (OD) values according to standard curves generated by
known amounts of monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG, IgM, or IgA. The OD values of blank (diluent
only) wells with the same coat and secondary detection antibody were averaged and subtracted from the OD
values of each respective sample well and then the ODs were logarithmically transformed. Next, a non-linear
regression of the sigmoidal standard curve was used to extrapolate a “concentration” for the patient samples,
which was then inverse log transformed and multiplied by the respective dilution factor. AU values for each
sample were chosen from the linear portion of the dilution curve for the antigen coated wells, and the paired
buffer only coat value was subtracted to determine the net AU amount.

Determination of the presence versus absence of SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies in samples and of
Arbitrary Unit Values: First, the average ODs of corresponding ‘blank’ wells (sample diluent only in buffer
only coated or antigen coated) on a given plate was subtracted from all wells with samples. ODs for blank wells
was consistently ~0.05 regardless of coat. Metric 1: Signal was considered positive from a given subjects if (1)
the OD values from the antigen coated wells was a minimum of 2.5x higher than that of the paired buffer coated
well for at least two sample dilutions and (2) one antigen-coated well OD value was over 0.1, after the average
OD values of the respective blank wells were subtracted.

LFD tests: Antagen’s DISCOVID IgM IgG LFD test was used to detect SARS-CoV-2 RBD specific IgM and
IgG antibodies following manufacturer instructions. Briefly, 20µl of plasma or serum was added to the
indicated sample port, immediately followed by provided diluent, and incubated at room temperature before
reading at 45 minutes. The results were scored as positive or negative for IgM and IgG by two independent
readers blinded to donor sample status.

Abbot Serology Test: The SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA)
used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-specific IgG in human samples. The assays were
performed according to manufacturer’s protocol.

Automated Washer: Plates were washed with Molecular Devices SkanWasher 400 microplate washer with
three rounds of aspiration and wash with a final aspiration step for each run. This protocol was run twice after
the coating, blocking, and sample incubation steps and three times after the addition of the secondary detection
antibody step in the experiment shown in Figure 1A. Plates were rotated 180° between each run. Residual wash
buffer was left in the plates (plates were not blotted post-wash) to mimic a fully automated system.

Figure 1. The modified ELISA (BU ELISA) protocol
exhibits low background signal at high sample
concentration and use of SARS-Cov-2 RBD-recombinant antibody standard curves allows for accurate sample quantification via accounting for OD
drift between experimental runs. (A) Dilution
curves of buffer only coated wells from five donor
samples after using an automated plate washer or the
BU ELISA method of multichannel plate washing.
Experiment was performed once. (B) Representative
dilution curves of buffer only coated wells from 30
subjects, average and range of 1:5 sample dilution for
each isotype from all subjects; IgM, IgG, and IgA were
detected in individual assays. (C) Representative IgM,
IgG, and IgA standard curves from 15 different experimental runs are shown. The average of all runs shown

a. Sterile 1x PBS, no calcium and no magnesium
b. 0.05% Tween 20
(8) HRP-conjugated anti-human antibodies (IgG, ThermoFisher, cat# A18817; IgM, ThermoFisher,
cat# A18841; IgA, Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat# 109-035-011)
(9) TMB-ELISA substrate solution (ThermoFisher, cat# 34029)
(10) Sulfuric acid stop solution (ThermoFisher, cat#N600)
(11) Disinfectant (i.e. 70% v/v ethanol disinfectant – spray bottle, 10% v/v bleach or 10% v/v
Wescodyne – bucket or beaker)

Procedure:
All work should be performed inside biological safety cabinets (BSC), level 2 or higher, at room
temperature (15-30°C).
Spray down all surfaces, racks, and reagent bottles with 70% v/v ethanol prior to entering and using BSC.
See Figure 1 for example of experimental plate layout.

Step 1: Coating plates
(1) Dilute stock RBD to 2µg/ml in sterile 1x PBS in polypropylene tubes or directly in reagent
reservoirs.
a. Vortex stock RBD for four seconds at max speed prior to removing aliquot for dilution.
Next, mix coating solution with RBD thoroughly by pipetting 8 times with 10ml pipette or
by vortexing if using polypropylene tubes.
(2) Plate 50µl per well of prepared RBD or PBS as coating control with sterile tips, using caution to not
touch the bottom of the wells.
(3) Cover tightly with a plate sealer and gently tap plates on all sides, while rotating, to ensure
complete coating of the wells.
(4) Incubate for 1 hour at room temperature.

Washing Step - (3 times with Wash Buffer 1 unless stated otherwise)

Washing Step Details:
Perform washing step one plate at a time using multichannel pipettors.
(1) Invert plate and flick out coating solution/blocking buffer/samples into waste container (shallow
rimmed Tupperware, for example) lined with dry paper towels to prevent splashing of liquid.
(2) Immediately add 200µl of washing solution to each well, again careful to not touch the bottom of
the wells with the pipette tips.
a. When wash buffer is added to all wells necessary, lift plate and gently tap 3 times to mix a
bit, allow wash buffer to sit in plate for ~30 seconds, then repeat gentle tapping, and then
flick out wash buffer into paper-towel lined waste container and bang plates on dry paper
towels 3 times, rotate 180 degrees, bang 3 more times, ensure liquid is removed but do not
allow them to sit dry.
(3) Repeat step 2 for a total of 3 times, unless stated otherwise.
Step 2: Blocking plates
(1) Plate 200µl of cold casein blocking buffer per well.
(2) Seal plate with a plate sealer and allow to incubate for 30 minutes – 1.5 hours at room
temperature.
Washing Step- (as described above, 3 times with Wash Buffer 1)
Plates can sit in Wash Buffer 1 until ready to add samples and must not be left dry.

Step 3: Add Samples
Samples can be either serum or plasma. If stored at ≤-20°C, allow to thaw completely at 4°C or on ice
prior to use. Recommended to not use samples that have undergone more than one freeze-thaw cycle.

(1) Prepare samples and standards prior to adding to the plate in separate polypropylene tubes;
cluster tubes or microcentrifuge tubes, for example.
a. Dilute samples in casein blocking buffer to 1:5, 1:10, 1:25, 1:125, 1:625, 1:3,125, 1:30,125
(dilutions may vary per experiment). Prepare standard curves using a 3-fold serial
dilutions, starting at 1000ng/mL, in casein blocking buffer.
b. Mix thoroughly by pipetting or vortexing between each dilution and using new tips every
time moving liquid from one dilution stock to another.
∗ Recommended to transfer prepared samples and standards to cluster tubes for ease of
transfer to plates.
(2) Add 50µl of prepared standard and sample dilution per well, as well as 50µl of casein blocking
buffer per well as a negative control for each sample (see example plate map below).
∗ Add samples quickly, gently pipette to mix each sample briefly prior to transfer to plates,
using caution to not touch the bottom of the wells and change tips between samples.
(3) After all samples are added to a plate, seal with a plate sealer and check for complete coating of
the wells; if necessary, gently tap plates on all sides, while rotating.
(4) Allow to incubate for 1 hour at room temperature.

Washing Step (as described above, 3 times with Wash Buffer 2)
Plates can sit in Wash Buffer 2 until ready to add samples and must not be left dry.

Step 4: Add HRP-conjugated antibodies
(5) Prepare HRP-conjugated antibodies using casein blocking buffer as diluent in polypropylene
tubes. Mix stocks and diluted solutions thoroughly by pipetting or vortexing.
a. IgM – 1:8,000
b. IgG – 1:2,000
c. IgA – 1:2,000
(2) Add 50µL per well of prepared antibodies to corresponding wells.
(3) Seal with a new plate sealer and check for complete coating of the wells; if necessary, gently tap
plates on all sides, while rotating.
(4) Allow to incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Washing Step (as described above, 4 times with Wash Buffer 2)
Plates can sit in Wash Buffer 2 until ready to add samples and must not be left dry.

Step 5: Development of Plates and Addition of Stop Solution
(1) Add 50µl of TMB-ELISA substrate solution to each well.
∗ TMB-ELISA substrate solution should be equilibrated to room temperature prior to use.
∗ Check for complete coating of the wells; if necessary, gently tap plates on all sides, while
rotating.
(2) Allow to incubate for decided number of minutes in the dark, unsealed (ranging 8-20 minutes or
when visible color difference is seen between most diluted standard (dilution 7) and casein
blocking buffer only well, but multiple reads at 652nm can be taken before stopping assay to
ensure best signal:noise is achieved).
(3) Stop reaction by adding 50µl of sulfuric acid stop solution to each well.
Step 6: Read Plates on Microplate reader
