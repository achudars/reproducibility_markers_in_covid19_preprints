Intention of health care workers to accept COVID-19 vaccination and related
factors: a systematic review and meta-analysis

Abstract
Background: Considering medical and economic burden of the coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19), a high COVID-19 vaccination coverage among health care
workers (HCWs) is an urgent need.
Objective: To estimate the intention of HCWs to accept COVID-19 vaccination and
to find out related factors.
Design: We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analysis guidelines for this study.
Data sources: We searched PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest,
CINAHL and medRxiv from January 1, 2020 to December 02, 2020.
Methods: The heterogeneity between results was very high and thus we applied a
random effect model to estimate pooled effects. We performed subgroup and metaregression analysis to identify possible resources of heterogeneity.
Results: Eleven studies, including 8847 HCWs met the inclusion criteria. The overall
proportion of HCWs that intent to accept COVID-19 vaccination was 55.9% (95% CI:
43.6-67.9%) with a wide range among studies from 27.7% to 81.5%. Intention of
HCWs to accept COVID-19 vaccination was higher in studies with moderate quality
and in studies that were conducted in Europe. The following factors were associated
with increased HCWs’ willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19: male gender,
older age, physician profession, fewer work experience, comorbidity among HCWs,
seasonal influenza vaccination, stronger vaccine confidence, positive attitude towards
a COVID-19 vaccine, fear about COVID-19, individual perceived risk about COVID19, and contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.
Conclusions: HCWs represent a high-risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The
reluctance or refusal of HCWs to vaccinate against COVID-19 could diminish the
trust of individuals and trigger a ripple effect in the general public. Since vaccination

is a complex behavior, understanding the way that HCWs take the decision to accept
or not COVID-19 vaccination will give us the opportunity to develop the appropriate
interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccination uptake. Knowledge of the factors
that affect intention of HWCs to accept COVID-19 vaccination is limited and there is
an urgent need for further and more valid studies.

Background

Α

second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is hitting

worldwide threatening societies, with an immense number of deaths and a
catastrophic economic impact [1,2]. Indicative, as of December 8, 2020, the World
Health Organization (WHO) reported more than 66 million cases globally and more
than 1.5 million deaths due to COVID-19 [3].
Seasonal influenza vaccination among health care workers (HCWs) is an effective
infection control measure in health care settings [4,5]. Also, the importance of HCWs
vaccination against H1N1 during the 2009/2010 influenza pandemic has already
noticed [6,7]. Seasonal influenza immunization is a priority in countries where the
proportion of elderly is high [8–10]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified HCWs as a
population with significant elevated risk of being infected from the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has recommended the rapid
and prioritized vaccination of HCWs against COVID-19 to protect the HCWs and the
public health [11–13].
HCWs’ vaccination against infectious diseases is of utmost importance to prevent the
spread of viruses, especially in health care settings with patients. There are plenty of
research studying factors influence vaccines’ acceptance by HCWs [14–19]. Several
factors are identified in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, e.g. desire for selfprotection, desire to prevent illness in family or friends, perceived severity and risk of
the disease, perceived safety and effectiveness of vaccination, more favorable
attitudes toward vaccination, seasonal influenza vaccination, and physician profession
[14–19].
The positive attitude of HCWs towards the COVID-19 vaccination is imperative since
they should accept the vaccination and promote vaccine acceptance in general public
to achieve herd immunity as soon as possible. To date, no systematic review and
meta-analysis has investigated the willingness of HCWs to accept COVID-19
vaccination. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate
the intention of HCWs to accept COVID-19 vaccination and to find out related
factors.

Methods
Data sources and strategy
We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalysis (PRISMA) guidelines [20] for this systematic review and meta-analysis and
the respective checklist is presented in Web Table 1. We searched PubMed, Medline,
Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, CINAHL and pre-print services (medRxiv) from
January 1, 2020 to December 02, 2020. We used the following strategy in all fields:
((("health care worker*" OR "healthcare worker*" OR "healthcare personnel" OR
"health care personnel" OR "health personnel" OR "health care professional*" OR
"healthcare professional*" OR HCWS OR HCW OR HCPS OR HCP OR staff OR
"nursing staff" OR employee* OR professional* OR personnel OR worker* OR
doctor* OR physician* OR clinician* OR nurs* OR midwives OR midwife* OR
paramedic* OR hospital* OR practitioner*) AND (vaccin*)) AND (intent* OR
willing* OR hesitancy)) AND (COVID-19 OR COVID19 OR COVID OR SARSCoV* OR "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus*" OR coronavirus*).
Also, we examined reference lists of all relevant articles and we removed duplicates.

Selection and eligibility criteria
Study selection was performed by two independent reviewers, while a third, senior
reviewer resolved the discrepancies. Firstly, we screened title and abstract of the
records and then full-text. We included studies examining HCWs’ intention to accept
COVID-19 vaccination and related factors. Also, we included all studies that were
written in English, except qualitative studies, reviews, case reports, protocols,
editorials, and letters to the Editor. All types of HCWs working in clinical settings
were accepted for inclusion, while we excluded studies that included students of
health sciences, retired HCWs, patients, and general population.

Data extraction and quality assessment
We extracted the following data from each study: authors, location, sample size, age,
gender, study design, sampling method, assessment of intention to accept COVID-19

vaccination, response rate, data collection time, type of publication (journal or preprint service), number of HCWs with intention to accept COVID-19 vaccination, type
of occupation (physicians, nurses, assistant nurses, paramedical staff, etc), factors
related with intention to accept COVID-19 vaccination, and the level of analysis
(univariate or multivariable).
Two independent reviewers used the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools to
assess quality of studies (poor, moderate or good quality). An 8-point scale is used for
cross-sectional studies with a score of ≤3 indicates poor quality, a score of 4-6 points
indicates moderate quality, and a score of 7-8 points indicates good quality [21].

Statistical analysis
For each study we divided the number of HCWs with intention to accept COVID-19
vaccination with the sample size to calculate the proportion of HCWs with intention
to accept vaccination and the relative 95% confidence interval (CI). Then, we
transformed the proportions with the Freeman-Tukey Double Arcsine method before
pooling [22]. We used the I2 and Hedges Q statistics to assess between-studies
heterogeneity. I2 values higher than 75% indicate high heterogeneity and a pvalue<0.1 for the Hedges Q statistic indicates statistically significant heterogeneity
[23]. The heterogeneity between results was very high and thus we applied a random
effect model to estimate pooled effects [23]. We considered sample size, age, gender,
response rate, data collection time, publication type (journal or pre-print service), type
of occupation, studies quality, and the continent that studies were conducted as prespecified sources of heterogeneity. Due to the limited variability of data in some
variables, we decided to perform subgroup analysis for publication type, studies
quality, and the continent that studies were conducted and meta-regression analysis
for sample size, gender distribution, and data collection time as the independent
variables. We conducted a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis to determine the
influence of each study on the overall effect. A funnel plot and the Egger’s test were
used to assess the publication bias with a P-value<0.05 indicating publication bias
[24]. We did not perform meta-analysis for the factors related with intention of HCWs
to accept COVID-19 vaccination since the data were highly heterogeneous and
limited. We used OpenMeta[Analyst] for the meta-analysis [25].

Results
Identification and selection of studies
Flowchart of the literature search according to PRISMA guidelines is presented in
Figure 1. Initially, we identified 1442 potential records through electronic databases
and 545 duplicates were removed. After the screening of the titles and abstracts, we
removed 850 records and we added one more record found by the reference lists
scanning. We included 11 studies [26–36] in this systematic review and meta-analysis
that met our inclusion criteria.

Characteristics of the studies
Main characteristics of the 11 studies included in this review are presented in Table 1.
A total of 8847 HCWs were included in this systematic review with a minimum of
123 HCWs [29] and a maximum of 2047 HCWs [26] among studies. Five studies
were conducted in Europe (France, Malta and Greece) [26,27,29,30,32], three studies
in Asia (China and Hong Kong) [31,33,34], two studies in Africa (Democratic
Republic of the Congo and Zambia) [28,35], and one study in North America (USA)
[36]. Females were more in six studies [26,30,31,33,34,36], while males were more in
two studies [28,35]. All studies were cross-sectional using a convenience sample.
Seven studies were published in journals [26–32] and four studies in pre-print services
[33–36]. Three studies did not report data regarding age [27,29,32], three regarding
gender distribution [27,29,32], and four regarding response rate [26,28,32,35]. Five
studies used Likert-type scales to assess intention of HCWs to accept COVID-19
vaccination [27,29,30,32,34], three studies used a yes/no/uncertain answer [31,33,35],
and three studies used a yes/no answer [26,28,36].
Intention of HCWs to accept vaccination and study population in the studies included
in this systematic review are presented in Table 2. Intention ranged from 27.7% [28]
to 81.5% [32]. Percentage of physicians that participated in studies ranged from
20.4% [27] to 100% [29], while percentage of nurses ranged from 18.1% [26] to
100% [31,34]. Two studies did not report data regarding study population [32,33].

Quality assessment
Quality assessment of cross-sectional studies included in this review is shown in
Table 3. Quality was moderate in six studies [27,29,30,32,33,35] and good in five
studies [26,28,31,34,36].

Meta-analysis
The overall proportion of HCWs that intent to accept COVID-19 vaccination was
55.9% (95% CI: 43.6-67.9%) (Figure 2). The heterogeneity between results was very
high (I2=99.25%, p-value for the Hedges Q statistic<0.001). A leave-one-out
sensitivity analysis showed that no single study had a disproportional effect on the
pooled proportion, which varied between 53.1% (95% CI: 40.8-65.2%), with Fu et al.
[33] excluded, and 58.8% (95% CI: 46.9-70.2%), with Nzaji et al. [28] excluded (Web
Figure 1).
According to subgroup analysis, the proportion of HCWs that intent to accept
COVID-19 vaccination was almost the same for the studies that were published in
journals (56.5% [95% CI: 39.8-72.5%], I2=99.43) and those in pre-print services
(54.9% [95% CI: 35.7-73.4%], I2=98.75). Moreover, the proportion was much higher
for the studies with moderate quality (62.4% [95% CI: 46.6-77.0%], I2=98.78)
compared to those with good quality (48.1% [95% CI: 28.4-68.2%], I2=99.54). The
proportion of HCWs that intent to accept COVID-19 vaccination was higher in
studies that were conducted in Europe (65.6% [95% CI: 50.6-79.1%], I2=99.06)
compared to those in Asia (60.1% [95% CI: 40.5-78.2%], I2=98.85) and Africa
(36.7% [95% CI: 19.6-55.9%], I2=95.86). Meta-regression showed that the proportion
of HCWs that intent to accept COVID-19 vaccination was independent of the sample
size (p=0.13), gender distribution (p=0.56), and data collection time (p=0.66).
P-value<0.05 for Egger’s test and the asymmetrical shape of the funnel plot (Web
Figure 2) implied potential publication bias.

Eight studies [26–31,34,36] investigated factors related with intention of HCWs to
accept COVID-19 vaccination, while five studies used multivariable analysis to
control confounding [26,28,31,34,36] (Table 4).
We found that several demographic characteristics were associated with COVID-19
vaccination acceptance. Profession was the most frequent predictor since five studies
[26–28,30,36] found that physicians were more prone to get vaccinated against
COVID-19 than other HCWs and especially nurses and paramedical staff (odds ratios
[ORs] ranged from 1.59 to 7.76). Male HCWs were more likely to be vaccinated than
females with ORs ranged from 1.17 to 1.88 [26–28,30]. Three studies [26,27,29]
found that older age was associated with an increase in COVID-19 vaccine
acceptance, while Kwok et al. [34] found the opposite. Papagiannis et al. [30] found
that fewer work experience increase the intention of HCWs to accept COVID-19
vaccine. Also, HCWs with chronic conditions were more likely to be vaccinated
against COVID-19 [31]. Flu vaccination during previous season was associated with
intention to accept COVID-19 vaccination with ORs ranged from 2.03 to 4.69
[26,31].
Stronger vaccine confidence [34] and positive attitude towards a COVID-19 vaccine
[28] increased HCWs’ willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Fear about
COVID-19, individual perceived risk about COVID-19, and weaker complacency
about the COVID-19 were related with increased COVID-19 vaccination acceptance
[26,34]. Wang et al. [31] found that HCWs exposed and in contact with suspected or
confirmed COVID-19 patients were more likely to accept COVID-19 vaccine.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis that assesses
the intention of HCWs to accept COVID-19 vaccination and related factors. We found
that the proportion of HCWs that intent to accept COVID-19 vaccination was
moderate (55.9%) with a wide range among studies from 27.7% to 81.5%. This
moderate level of acceptance may be attributable to several reasons, e.g. inadequate
knowledge among HCWs regarding COVID-19 [37,38], negative attitude towards the
disease [37,39], and feelings of fear and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic [40–

43]. Also, concerns raised for COVID-19 vaccination are related with inadequate
knowledge about such new vaccines regarding the long term side effects,
effectiveness, efficacy etc. [27,29]. Better knowledge of COVID-19 among HCWs
affects their attitude, increases their confidence, and promotes preventive measures
such as the vaccination [44–46].
Although the positive effects of influenza vaccine in health outcomes and in financial
terms are well known [9,47–49], the vaccination rate is low even among HCWs. In
particular, low vaccination coverage was found in a meta-analysis [18] with 45 studies
in mainland China where the influenza vaccination rate was 17.7%, 9.4%, 7.8%, and
3.5% for HCWs, general population, pregnant women, and people with chronic
conditions respectively. Also, a systematic review [16] found that the median
vaccination rate against seasonal influenza and H1N1 among HCWs in Asia is low
(37.4%) although is higher than high-risk groups, students/military, and general
population (37.3%, 35.5% and 14.3% respectively). Similar findings are found in
studies in Europe (United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Spain) where HCWs
receive influenza vaccination more often than the general population but in low levels,
ranging from 15% to 29% [50]. A meta-analysis included studies in Italy found that
the proportion of influenza vaccination among nurses and ancillary workers was
13.47% and 12.52% respectively [51]. Influenza vaccination coverage is higher in
Canada, ranging from 35.5% to 51% [52,53] and much higher in USA approaching
80.6% during the 2019-2020 season among 2454 HCWs [54] but still lower than the
national Healthy People 2020 target of 90% [55].
According to our subgroup analysis, the proportion of HCWs that intent to accept
COVID-19 vaccination was higher in studies in Europe than those in Asia and Africa.
This finding is in accordance with a study [56] in 10 countries in Africa, Latin
America, Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East where the influenza
vaccination coverage rate in general population was much higher in Europe than in
Asia and Africa. This difference may be attributable mainly to the fact that a national
influenza vaccination policy and recommendations for seasonal influenza vaccination
are standard in developed countries but this is not the case in many developing
countries in Asia and Africa. Also, the availability of influenza vaccines is low in
Africa [57], while the number of influenza vaccines per capita is much higher in high-

income countries compared to lower and middle-income countries (median number;
139.2 vs. 6.1 per 1000 population) [58].
We found a difference in intention to accept COVID-19 vaccination between the
professions, with physicians most inclined to get vaccinated compared to other HCWs
and especially nurses and paramedical staff. This finding is confirmed by two metaanalyses [51,59] including studies in Italy, where the prevalence of influenza
vaccination among physicians was 23.18% [59], among nurses was 13.47%, and
among ancillary workers was 12.52% [51]. Several other studies worldwide confirm
the fact that the influenza vaccination coverage among physicians is the highest
[54,60,61]. Also, a systematic review [62] with regards to pandemic influenza A
vaccine (H1N1) 2009 found that physicians were more likely to accept influenza
vaccine and to have a positive attitude toward vaccination. In general, physicians are
more prone to accept vaccination than other HCWs, e.g. the full hepatitis B
vaccination coverage among physicians is 2.6 times higher than nurses [19]. Several
reasons could be behind this observation such as greater misconceptions about
vaccines among nurses and other HCWs, less fear and care about infectious diseases,
less knowledge and more doubt about vaccine efficacy. This finding is a major
concern in health care settings especially during the COVID-19 pandemic since
nurses and assistant nurses have more and longer direct contact with patients than
other HCWs [63]. Also, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is higher
among frontline health care workers and health care assistants [64] indicating that
nurses and assistant nurses represent a high-risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
We found that older age was related with an increase in willingness to get vaccinated
against COVID-19. This finding is unsurprising since HCWs are quite familiar with
the fact that older age is one of the strongest risk factors for COVID-19 mortality [65–
67]. Therefore, it is more probable for older HCWs to take the COVID-19 vaccine
due to their own self-interest. In a similar way, we found that HCWs with chronic
conditions were more prone to get vaccinated against COVID-19. This finding makes
sense since HCWs with comorbidity is a high-risk group for complications and death
from COVID-19 as this is the case for the general population also according to several
meta-analyses [66–70]. Older HCWs with comorbidity confront COVID-19 with fear
and anxiety affecting critically their decision to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. An
interesting result in our review is that male gender was associated with greater
likelihood of taking COVID-19 vaccine. Two reviews regarding influenza vaccination

[18] and hepatitis B vaccination [19] did not find any relation between gender and
vaccination coverage. A possible explanation for our observation could be that the
individual perceived risk about COVID-19 is higher among male HCWs.
According to our study, being vaccinated against flu during previous season was
associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Similarly, HCWs with vaccine
confidence and positive attitude towards a COVID-19 vaccine were more likely to be
vaccinated against COVID-19. These findings are of utmost importance since the
WHO named vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten threats to global health in 2019
[71]. Health care workers especially at primary care should communicate in a clear
way the message that vaccines are safe and effective to improve vaccination coverage
in communities [72]. Since a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine seems to be the
only solution for this pandemic, the positive attitude of HCWs towards vaccination is
imperative. Vaccine hesitancy among HCWs with regard to other vaccines, such as
seasonal influenza vaccine already exists [73–75]. In case of the COVID-19 vaccine
the situation can be worse since vaccine hesitancy is fuelled by fake news and
conspiracy theories [76]. The reluctance or refusal of HCWs to vaccinate against
COVID-19 could diminish the trust of individuals and trigger a ripple effect in the
general public [77,78]. There is a need to build confidence and trust in communities to
rollout successfully a COVID-19 vaccine.
Additionally, we found that individual perceived risk about COVID-19 was related
with increased COVID-19 vaccination acceptance among HCWs. HCWs may be
reluctant to receive a novel COVID-19 vaccine when they believe that it is not protect
against a significant personal threat. On the other hand, the self-perceived
susceptibility to and seriousness of a vaccine infectious disease such as COVID-19
may increase vaccine acceptance [79]. This association has already observed in case
of COVID-19 not only in the general public [80] but also in HCWs [7,15]. A warning
sign to public health safety is that vaccine hesitancy is greater among nurses than
among physicians [81–83].
Our study is subject to several limitations. In particular, more than the half of studies
was of moderate quality, while four out of eleven studies were published in pre-print
services which do not apply peer-review process. We performed subgroup analysis
according to studies quality and publication type to overcome this limitation. The
statistical heterogeneity in results was very high due probably to variability in study
designs and populations. In that case, we applied a random effects model and we

performed subgroup and meta-regression analysis. Data with regards to the factors
related with intention of HCWs to accept COVID-19 vaccination were limited, while
five studies used multivariable models to eliminate confounding. We consider this as
a potential area for future study. Moreover, all the studies included in this review were
cross-sectional studies making causal inferences impossible. Finally, the proportion of
HCWs that intent to accept COVID-19 vaccination may be an overestimation since
studies evaluated self-reported answers that could be subject to social desirability
bias, with HCWs knowing that the general public expects a high COVID-19
vaccination coverage among them.

Conclusions
HCWs are identified worldwide as priority recipients of the novel COVID-19 vaccine
since they represent a high-risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission
risk of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical settings between patients and HCWs is high. Also,
HCWs serve as trusted community workers on public health topics and their role in
promoting COVID-19 vaccine acceptance is critical. Thus, COVID-19 vaccine
hesitancy among HCWs should be eliminated to inspire the general public towards a
positive attitude regarding a novel COVID-19 vaccine. Knowledge of the factors that
affect intention of HWCs to accept COVID-19 vaccination is limited and there is an
urgent need for further studies to make more valid inferences. Since vaccination is a
complex behavior, understanding the way that HCWs take the decision to accept or
not COVID-19 vaccination will give us the opportunity to develop the appropriate
interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccination uptake.
