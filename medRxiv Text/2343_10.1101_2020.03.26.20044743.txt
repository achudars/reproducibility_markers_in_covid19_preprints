Abstract
Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak turned into a
pandemic, with hundreds of thousands of cases reported globally. The number of cases
dramatically increased beginning in early March 2020.
Aim: We assessed the cumulative change in the incidence and case-fatality rates of COVID-19
at the global, regional, and national levels from January to March 16, 2020, in 154 affected
countries and territories globally.
Methods: We collected data of COVID-19 cases using the GitHub repository, which provided
real-time surveillance information developed by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering
(CSSE), Johns Hopkins University (USA). Information such as confirmed COVID-19 cases,
deaths, and recoveries reported across all affected countries was collected from January 22 to
March 16, 2020. We estimated the change in the incidence rate, case-fatality rate, and recovery
rate from January 22 to February 29 and from March 1 to March 16, 2020.
Results: From January 22 to March 16, 2020, globally, the number of incident COVID-19 cases
increased by 276.2%, and Europe recorded 65,281 new cases from March 1 to 16, 2020. Overall,
the case-fatality rate was 3.92%, with a high COVID-19 fatality rate in Italy (7.7%), Iran (5.7%),
China (4.2%) and the United Kingdom (3.6%). The estimated percentage change in COVID-19
cases from March 1 to 16, 2020, was highest in Belgium (105.8/100,000 population), followed
by Qatar (439/100,000 population) and Portugal (331/100,000 population). The overall recovery
rate of COVID-19 was 43%; China (35.5%) had the highest recovery rate, while the United
States of America recorded a recovery rate of 0.3%.
Conclusion: Overall, all the COVID-19-affected countries showed an upward trend in incidence,
with little change in the incidence rate of -0.20% from January to Mid-March. The case-fatality
rate was found to be 3.92%, and the recovery rate was observed to be less than half (43%) among
COVID-19 patients. Italy, Iran, and Spain had the largest numbers of new cases of COVID-19
from March 1 to 16, 2020.

Introduction
In early January, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology from Wuhan, Hubei
Province in China, was identified as novel coronavirus, which is now referred to as severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the illness as coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) [1]. In January, COVID-19 spread throughout Wuhan with several cases, and other
countries started to report their first cases of the disease. The outbreak of COVID-19 continues to
spread around the world and has become a significant public health problem [2]. Subsequently,
several hundreds of thousands of cases were reported around the world, and on March 11, 2020,
the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic [3].
As of March 31, 2020, over 800,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported across 203
countries and territories, and more than 38,000 deaths had been reported [4]. Currently, the
dynamics of COVID-19 are placing tremendous strain on countries, citizens, resources, and
economies. In the absence of an antiviral treatment or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, preventive
measures such as hand hygiene practices, social distancing measures, movement restrictions,
self-quarantines, closure of institutions, and other interventions have been intensified [5]. As
these interventions are gradually implemented, early epidemiological estimates of COVID-19
distribution, cumulative changes in the incidence, and case-fatality rate are crucial for effective
interventions. Therefore, we assessed the cumulative change in the incidence and case-fatality
rates of COVID-19 at global, regional, and national levels from January 22 – March 16, 2020,
across 154 affected countries and territories globally.
Methods
In our analysis, we used the GitHub data repository, a publicly available dataset of the newly
confirmed COVID-19 cases updated daily [6]. First, we extracted the data of confirmed cases,
death, and recovery reported from January 22 to March 16, 2020. Second, the collected
information was filtered and categorized into regions. These data were used to assess the trends
in COVID-19 cases, case-fatality rates, and recovery rates at the global, regional, and national
levels. Thus, we calculated the relative change in the incident cases and deaths reported in each
country and territory and truncated percentage changes in the new cases and the case-fatality rate
during the January 22 – March 16, 2020 period. We also reported the recovery rate of the known
cases in each country.

Statistical analysis
Frequencies and percentages are used to summarize the information. The case-fatality rate was
defined as (number of deaths reported/total number of cases) x 100. The estimated percentage
change was calculated using the formula: ((y2-y1)/y1)*100, where y1= initial value and y2= end
value. All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA 16 data analysis and statistical
software (StataCorp, LLC, TX, USA).
Results
As of March 16, 2020, the global incidence of COVID-19 increased to 181,546 cases across 154
countries and territories, with a case-fatality rate of 3.92% and a recovery rate of 43%. The
distribution of COVID-19 at the regional and national levels is presented in Table 1. For
European and North American countries, the number of new cases showed an upward trend, and
Europe reported a higher case-fatality rate (4.2%) than Asia (3.8%). By the middle of March,
China (n=81033), Italy (n=27980), Iran (n=14991), Spain (n=9942), South Korea (n=8236) and
Germany (n=7272) reported the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases. However, of these, Italy
(7.7%), Iran (5.7%), and China (4.2%) reported a higher mortality rate than the global average
(3.9%).
From January to March 16, 2020, the COVID-19 incidence increased in a total of 154 countries
(Figure 1A). Within a short period, the COVID-19 cases dramatically increased all over the
world, except for in some sub-Saharan African countries. From March 1 to 16, 2020, the number
of incident COVID-19 cases increased in a total of 152 countries (Figure 1B). The percent
change in the incidence cases was less than 1000% in 70 countries, including China (102%),
while the greatest increase in percentage change was observed in Belgium (1058/100,000
population), Qatar (439/100,000 population), Portugal (33,100%), and Denmark (310.6/100,000
population).
Globally, from January to March 16, 2020, the number of new COVID-19 cases worldwide
increased by 276.2% from 555 cases to 153,312 [Table 2]. With a decline in the number of new
cases in China, a slight change in the incidence of -0.20% was noticed during the first half of
March 2020. However, the most pronounced increase in new COVID-19 cases was observed in
Europe by 66,749%, from “0” cases in January to 1467 cases in February to 65,281 cases in mid-

March 2020. The affected countries and territories experienced an increase in incidence, except
the cases in China, which had an incidence of -0.97%, and the cases reported from a cruise ship
(-1.01%). In March, South Korea (0.62%), Singapore (0.38%), and Thailand (1.68%) showed a
decrease in COVID-19 incidence rates compared to the previous period.
A total of 7126 COVID-19 deaths occurred globally as of March 16, 2020, with a relative change
of 242.2% compared to the deaths that occurred through the end of February 2020 (Figure 2A).
From March 1 to 16, a relative increase in the death rate was observed in Iran (8.53%) and Spain
(3.42%) (Figure 2B).
Discussion
Between January 22 and March 16, 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases increased rapidly
worldwide, and thousands of deaths have been reported in several countries. Our results indicate
that the global trends in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic rapidly emerged in all countries in
early March 2020, and the observed incidence increased by 276.2%. In particular, an increase in
incidence and mortality rates were prominent in most regions worldwide (albeit the majority of
cases still occurred in China and Italy). Nevertheless, the incidence of COVID-19 cases varies
significantly between countries and regions. The difference between the highest and the lowest
incidence was 1088-fold (Belgium: 1056 versus China: 0.97), and the difference in the mortality
rate was 26.6-fold (Italy: 7.71 versus Austria: 0.29). It is worth noting that countries such as
South Korea, Singapore, and Thailand showed a decreasing trend in the COVID-19 incidence
rates in early March 2020.
Our estimates of the case-fatality rate of COVID-19 in Italy and Iran are nearly double that of the
global case-fatality rate (3.9%). These findings reflect the situation in these countries. This
suggests that the situation of COVID-19 in these countries is particularly dire and requires
intensive support to reduce fatalities. Moreover, insufficient healthcare resources in many
countries, inadequate screening among travelers, lack of preparedness of healthcare workers, and
misconceptions among the general public can lead to substantial diagnosis gaps, which may have
caused the disproportionate distribution in incidence and mortality. Our data are in agreement
with the estimates of the worldwide incidence and mortality from the World health organization
(WHO), the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the European
Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) [7-9]. Regarding the regional variations in

the incidence of COVID-19 from March 1 to 16, the highest values were found in South America
and Africa and the lowest were found in Australia and parts of Asia.
Improvement in early screening, diagnosis, and strict adherence to preventive measures may play
a key role in halting the global epidemiological transition, including the numbers of incident
cases and deaths. These factors might have been responsible for the sharp changes observed in
China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea [10-12]. Indeed, mainland in China and
neighboring countries experienced a sharp increase in incidence, as well as in death, in February
2020. The following factors may have contributed to the gradual leveling off in incidence: a)
responding aggressively by implementing travel restrictions on passengers to prevent
transmission [13], b) early recognition and epidemic preparedness with 124 “action items,”
including border control, school closures, and work policies [14] and (c) rigorous detection and
strict quarantine measures to break the long chain of COVID-19 outbreaks [15]. However,
further epidemiological analysis addressing the current situation, knowledge gaps in its etiology,
and comprehensive management of COVID-19 at national and regional levels are warranted.
The study has some unavoidable limitations. Our analysis relies on epidemiologic data reported
through March 16, 2020. Therefore, the accuracy of the results depends on the quality of the data
reported. In terms of quality, the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at John
Hopkins University (USA) obtained confirmed information from respective centers prior to the
collection of information and is coordinated by a team of experts from John Hopkins University
[16]. Most of the information presented in the GitHub repository by the CSSE is consistent with
the data reported by the WHO [16]. There may be missing information due to limited reporting
resources, delays in investigations, and reluctance to update the information in some countries.
Thus, information bias is inevitable. Due to the limitations of the data, we cannot perform further
investigation in regard to the clinical, etiological, treatment and risk stratification of the COVID19 cases.
Conclusion
Overall, all the COVID-19-affected countries showed an upward trend in incidence globally,
with little change in the incidence rate of -0.20% from January to Mid-March. The case-fatality
rate was found to be 3.92%, and the recovery rate was observed to be less than half (43%) among
