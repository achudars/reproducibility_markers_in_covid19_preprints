Abstract
An outbreak of new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was occurred in Wuhan, China and rapidly
spread to other cities and nations. The standard diagnostic approach that widely adopted
in the clinic is nuclear acid detection by real-time RT-PCR. However, the false-negative
rate of the technique is unneglectable and serological methods are urgently warranted.
Here, we presented the colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic (ICG) strip
targeting viral IgM or IgG antibody and compared it with real-time RT-PCR. The sensitivity
of ICG assay with IgM and IgG combinatorial detection in nuclear acid confirmed cases
were 11.1%, 92.9% and 96.8% at the early stage (1-7 days after onset), intermediate
stage (8-14 days after onset), and late stage (more than 15 days), respectively. The ICG
detection capacity in nuclear acid-negative suspected cases was 43.6%. In addition, the
consistencies of whole blood samples with plasma were 100% and 97.1% in IgM and IgG
strips, respectively. In conclusion, serological ICG strip assay in detecting SARS-CoV-2
infection is both sensitive and consistent, which is considered as an excellent
supplementary approach in clinical application.

Introduction
In December 2019, an outbreak of new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, also known as
2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (COVID-19) was occurred in Wuhan, China and soon
spread to other cities and countries. According to the epidemiological analysis conducted
by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC), 80.9% of the cases
are mild/moderate pneumonia, and the crude overall motility rate is 2.3% (1). The clinical
manifestations of most patients include fever, cough, shortness of breath and myalgia etc,
and radiographic evidence demonstrated pneumonia with multiple mottling and
ground-glass opacity (2). A fraction of patients in serious condition will proceed to
complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm,
which may account for the reasons for COVID-19 caused death (3-5). Despite the
relatively low fatality, the transmissibility of COVID-19 is proved to be high. Basic
reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 ranging from 1.4 to 6.47, while most of the
modeling studies showed the R0 value greater than 3 (6, 7).

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to lineage B of the beta-coronavirus family, the zoonotic-origin
single-strand RNA viruses that are transmitted between animals and people. The four
prevalent viruses of seven coronavirus family members, 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1,
cause only the mild upper respiratory diseases, while the other two highly pathogenic
strains, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, together with the new identified SARS-CoV-2 are
regarded to pose the global threats to public health. The full-genome sequencing data
from two groups revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 comprises of six major open reading

frames (ORFs) and shares approximately 80% of similarity with SARS-CoV, but 98.65%
nucleotide identity to partial RdRp gene and 96.2% identity to RaTG13 of SARS-like bat
coronavirus strain, respectively (8, 9). Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 recognizes the
same cell entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Real-time
reverse-transcript Polymerase Chain Reaction (real-time RT-PCR) is regarded as the
“gold-standard” in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 (10). Designed primers targeting
ORF1ab, envelop protein gene (E gene) or nucleocapsid protein gene (N gene) are
proved to be both sensitive and specific toward the new SARS-CoV-2 virus and ruled out
most of the other coronaviruses (229E, OC43 and MERS) and influenza viruses (H1N1,
H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9 subtype) (11, 12).

Despite the real-time RT-PCR is widely adopted as the standard diagnostic method of
SARS-CoV-2 in China and worldwide, the limitation of this technology is obvious. The
patients that are positive to RT-PCR tests can be diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 infection,
while negative to the tests cannot rule out the possibility. The increasing number of reports
from local authorities addressed the unneglectable false-negative rate in the diagnosis of
suspected cases, which poses much threat to the community and adds an extra burden to
the epidemic prevention. For example, the chest CT scanning from 5 suspected cases
demonstrated ground-glass opacity and/or mixed consolidation, yet the initial real-time
RT-PCR test showed to be negative. After a few days, all the 5 cases tested for the
second or third examinations had eventually confirmed to be positive to SARS-CoV-2 (13).
Complementary to RT-PCR, pneumonia radiography provides strong evidence for the

diagnosis. Nevertheless, more specific measurements, such as serologic methods are
urgently needed in the supplement to the current diagnosis. Here we present the newly
developed serological detection methods targeting the viral antibody, colloidal gold-based
immunochromatographic (ICG) strip, that conducted in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan
University, hoping to provide supplementary diagnostic approaches for the SARS-CoV-2
infected patients.

Methods
Colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic (ICG) strip assay
The blood samples were collected, and blood serum, plasma or whole blood were
subjected to ICG assay in accordant with the manufacturer’s protocol (Zhuhai Livzon
Diagnositic Inc.). In brief, 10 μL of serum or plasma, or 20 μL of whole blood samples
were added onto the sample loading area followed by 100 μL (2 drops) of sample dilution
solution. After a short time (no longer than 15 minutes) of incubation, viral IgM- or
IgG-containing positive samples (figure 1) could show up both the T line (test) and C line
(control); the samples with only C line were regarded as negative (figure 1); the strips with
no C line showed up should be considered as the invalid test.

Real-Time RT-PCR Assay
Throat swab samples were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 with the Chinese Center
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended Kit (BioGerm, Shanghai, China),
following WHO guidelines for qRT-PCR. All samples were processed simultaneously at

the Department of Laboratory Medicine of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. All
patients with COVID-19 pneumonia tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by use of quantitative
RT-PCR on samples from the respiratory tract. This study was reviewed and approved by
the Ethical Committee of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. Written informed
consent was waived by the Ethics Commission for emerging infectious diseases.

Statistical analysis
In the ICG strip sensitivity assay with real-time RT-PCR confirmed cases and ICG
detection capability with nuclear acid negative cases, the numbers of IgM positive, IgG
positive and either IgM or IgG positive were counted, and the percentages were
presented. In the ICG detection consistency assay, the consistency rate was calculated by
the formula: TPR = TP / (TP+FN); TNR = TN / (TN+FN); Consistency = (TP+TN) /
(TP+FP+TN+FN). TPR: true positive rate; TP: true positive; TN: true negative; FP: false
positive; FN: false negative.

years (range from 20 to 96 years old) that hospitalized at Zhongnan hospital were
enrolled in the study. Seventy-eight patients were collected the blood once, 25 patients
were collected twice and 2 of the patients were collected three times. Among the samples,
95 of the samples from 76 patients were initially confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection by
real-time RT-PCR, 8 of the patients were initially negative to nuclear acid detection but
positive to the following tests; in total 39 nuclear acid negative samples from 37 of the
patients were “clinically diagnosed” as SARS-CoV-2 infection according to the 5th edition
of guideline on diagnosis and treatment of the novel coronavirus pneumonia. Specifically,
the “clinical diagnosis” means the suspected cases were negative to the real-time
RT-PCR test but presented viral pneumonia by radiography. The study was conducted
with the consent from all patients and approved by the ethics committee of Zhongnan
hospital.

All the blood samples were collected between February 6 and February 21, and the ICG
strip assay was performed between February 10 and 23. In total of 108 samples,
including 86 of confirmed samples and 22 clinical diagnosed samples, were available for
the symptom onset information (disease duration 0-34 days), which was range from
January 7, 2020 to February 18, 2020, and subjected to the IgM or IgG sensitivity assay;
the symptom onset information was not available for remaining 26 cases. Among all the
samples, 39 “clinically diagnosed” samples from 37 patients were subjected to antibody
detection capability in nuclear acid negative patients; 47 of the samples were used for the
comparison of the consistency in plasma and whole blood samples, 13 of which were

ruled out as the samples were expired.

Sensitivity of IgM or IgG ICG strip assay
A total of 86 samples from 67 cases of real-time RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive
patients with disease duration information were subjected to the analysis. According to
the disease progress stage calculated from the start of symptom onset, the disease was
divided into early stage (1-7 days from onset), intermediate stage (8-14 days) and late
stage (more than 15 days). As summarized in table 1, the positive rates of IgM or IgG in
the early stage are relatively low, and gradually increase during the disease progression.
The IgM positive rate rising from 11.1% of early stage to 78.6% and 74.2% in intermediate
and late stage, respectively. The IgG positive rate in the confirmed patients is 3.6% in
early, 57.1% in intermediate and 96.8% in late stage, respectively. Noteworthy, combining
the result of IgM and IgG, i.e. patients with either IgM or IgG positive, would significantly
increase the sensitivity of IGC assay, especially at the intermediate stage. While IgM and
IgG positive rates at the intermediate stage are 78.6% and 57.1%, respectively,
combining both parameters would bring a positive rate to 92.9%. Collectively, in response
to the virus invade, the IgM was firstly produced against the virus; with the disease
progression, IgG antibody start to produce and gradually become detectable. The
sensitivity of ICG assays increase and peak at around 15 days. Combining both IgM and
IgG would largely sensitize the result of ICG assay.

According to the 5th edition of the guideline on diagnosis and treatment of the novel
coronavirus pneumonia, highly suspected COVID-19 patients with real-time RT-PCR
negative but present radiographic viral pneumonia were regarded as “clinically diagnosed”
patients. Although the nuclear acid test is regarded as the “gold standard” of the
diagnosis, due to certain limitations, the false-negative cases are not rare. Hence, the IgM
and IgG anti-viral antibody were also examined in clinically diagnosed patients. In total 39
samples from 37 clinically diagnosed patients were included. Among these samples, 9
(23.1%) of them were positive to IgM and 15 (38.5%) of them were positive to IgG; when
combine the IgG and IgM results in total 17 (43.6%) of samples were positive from 39
nuclear acid negative cases.

Considering the disease stage affects the detection of viral antibody, we also analyzed
the clinically diagnosed patients in different stages. As shown in table 2, 22 samples from
clinical diagnosis patients with disease duration information were included. 9 cases were
at early stage, 6 cases at the intermediate stage and 7 cases at late stage. The positive
percentages of IgM at early, intermediate and late stages were 22.2%, 33.3% and 57.1%,
respectively; the positive rate of IgG at early, intermediate and late stages were 44.4%,
66.7% and 71.4%, respectively. When it came to IgM and IgG combination, the positive
rate boosted to 83.3% in cases at intermediate stage. Comparing with confirmed cases,
the IgG and IgM positive rates were similar, albeit relatively lower. In accordant with
nuclear acid positive cases, the IgG and IgM combinatorial detection strategy in
clinically-diagnosed intermediate-stage patients demonstrated the maximal detection

efficacy. In summary, IgM or IgG ICG strip detection in nuclear acid negative suspected
patients showed promising detection capability, which would be an excellent
supplementary approach in the clinically diagnostic application.

ICG assay consistency between whole blood and plasma samples
In order to study the consistency of whole blood samples with plasma, 34 paired whole
blood and plasma samples were collected and subjected to IgM or IgG detection.
Twenty-four of the plasma positive and 10 of the negative samples were used as a
reference. Notably, all the IgM detection in whole blood samples were 100% consistent
with plasma samples. In the cases of IgG (shown in table 3), 23 of the plasma positive
samples were identified in whole blood samples, which represented the positive
consistency rate of 95.8%. As of 10 negative samples in plasma, the whole blood
detection of these samples were all negative and demonstrated the 100% negative
consistency rate. Compared with plasma antibody detection, the total consistency rate in
whole blood ICG assay was 97.1% [(23+10)/(23+0+1+10)]. Collectively, the whole blood
antibody detection consistencies were 100% and 97.1% in IgM and IgG ICG assay,
respectively, which indicated that the whole blood samples showed excellent agreements
with plasma samples.

Discussion
The late 2019 and early 2020 have witnessed the third and the largest coronavirus
outbreak in recent two decades. Due to the limited knowledge related to the new virus

SARS-CoV-2 at early stage of the outbreak and the capacity of human-to-human
transmissibility in the latent period, the infected cases were exponentially arising in
Wuhan, the center of the epidemic, and rapidly spread to domestic and abroad areas.
Scientific groups have quickly deciphered the viral whole-genome sequence and specific
primers targeting SARS-CoV-2 were designed and tested preclinically before massively
diagnostic application in clinic. The viral whole-genome sequencing and viral nuclear acid
detection by real-time RT-PCR are regarded as standard diagnostic approaches. While
the whole-genome sequence is both time-consuming and labor-intensive, real-time
RT-PCR is relatively fast and easy to carry out in hospital laboratories, which makes the
latter technique as the “gold standard” of clinical diagnosis. However, the gold standard
also has its limitations. Based on more than 3,000 detected cases by real-time RT-PCR in
the clinical laboratory of Zhongnan hospital, our previous review summarized several
reasons for false-negative incidence, at both detection level and patients level (14). From
detection aspects, the quality and sensitivity of detection kits and viral preservation
solutions from different companies may all affect the detection accuracy and result in the
false-negative possibility. Besides, it is indicated that, during the disease progress, the
heavy infection at the nasopharyngeal area of early stage would possibly become
negative and the lower respiratory tract may severely be infected at late stage. Thus, the
nasopharyngeal swab may not be the best sampling site for all patients at various
disease stage. Moreover, patients with persistent anti-viral medication (such as anti-HIV
drugs) may decrease the viral loading at the undetectable level. Therefore, additional
detection techniques are urgently needed in the supplement to the current diagnostic

shortages for the nuclear acid-negative suspected cases, whom would otherwise be ruled
out.

In this study, we investigated the quick detection approach targeting viral IgM or IgG
antibody, the colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic (ICG) strip assay, in
comparison with real-time RT-PCR testing. The antibodies are produced and secreted by
B lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system when the foreign pathogens invaded. IgM
is usually the first responded antibody that eliminating pathogens before sufficient IgG is
produced, while IgG serves as the most robust antibody-based immunity. From the
retrospective study of immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV, IgM and IgG were started to
be detected after 7 days of onset and persistent for 2-3 years (15, 16). Similar to
SARS-CoV, COVID-19 patients also showed similar characteristics. As demonstrated by
Zhang et al., both IgM and IgG can be detected after 5 days of onset by anti-SARS-CoV-2
ELISA assay (17). In accordant with Zhang et al., our study showed that both IgM and IgG
were firstly detected on day 4 among the confirmed cohort and the positive rate of IgM
and IgG were 11.1% and 3.6% in early stage patients, respectively. The positive rate of
IgM remained approximately 75% in the intermediate and late stage patients, while IgG
positive rate kept increasing during the disease progression and up to 96.8% of late-stage
confirmed patients showed detectable IgG. Noteworthy, combining IgM and IgG detection
results could reach the maximal testing efficacy, especially in intermediate stage. A similar
trend could be captured in clinically diagnosed patients. In addition, the consistency rate
of whole blood and plasma samples in IgM and IgG assays were 100% and 97.1%

respectively, demonstrating an excellent consistency between two types of samples. As
the whole blood samples are capable of detecting antibody by ICG strip assay, the quick
and massive viral detection in equipment-insufficient laboratories and communities is
realizable.

The advantages of ICG strip viral antibody detection are obvious. First of all, the
sensitivity of ICG strip is comparable, especially after 7 days of onset; the detection
capacity in nuclear acid-negative “clinically diagnostic” patients is impressive. Therefore,
ICG strip is highly recommended to be utilized as the supplementary diagnostic approach
in clinical applications. The ICG strip can also be widely adopted in the areas where the
diagnostic capacity is limited. Secondary, the ICG strip assay is operational as it is ready
to use and time-saving. The assay can be finished within 15 minutes without specialized
equipment. Thirdly, unlike oral swab sampling that may cause stimulated retching and
coughing, which increases the exposure risk of laboratory technicians, the blood
collection could avoid the unnecessary risk and reduce the operation steps that may
cause aerosol. Fourthly, the detection of antibodies may also indicate the disease
recovery, as immunoglobulins are among the most important soldiers in the battle of
viruses. Patients that initially detected as virus-positive and gradually become negative
but with detectable IgG or IgM during the disease progress may be considered as
recovered from this battle. It is noteworthy that ICG strip can only provide qualitative
results but the serological ELISA assay against viral antibody offered the quantitative
antibody titer and regarded as the superior alternation at this point. Last but not least, ICG

strip can be used for community surveillance. Some healthy people in epidemic areas
may already get infected but without any symptoms, the detectable antibody from their
blood is the evidence of infection. The surveillance detection in epidemic areas for both
healthy members and patients could provide useful information for mapping the whole
pictures of viral transmission, which would help us to better understand the real situation
and establish optimal policies against the epidemic.

Although ICG strip assay is characterized as a rapid and sensitive complementary
detection method against SARS-CoV-2, there are several limitations of our test. One is
that the assay was carried out without specificity analysis. Our hospital is located in
Wuhan, the center of the epidemic, and there are hundreds of, sometimes thousands of,
confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases each day. It is inoperable to select “uninfected”
cases for the negative control of specificity analysis, as the patients received after the
outbreak may possibly get infected with or without any symptoms. Such assay can be
carried out in the areas where the epidemic is not severe and community transmission is
at a low chance. Another limitation, as mentioned above, is that the ICG results are
qualitative. Despite the positive bands on the strips may provide diverse gradations of
color, i.e. deep or light red, the color itself doesn’t correlate with the abundance of
antibody. A more precise way of detecting antibody titer is by ELISA assay, though
compromised the convenience.

Collectively, we provided a sensitive and consistent serology diagnostic approach in

complementary to the current clinically used real-time RT-PCR testing in diagnosis with
