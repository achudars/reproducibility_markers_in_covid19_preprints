Abstract
Background: China has experienced an outbreak of a novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
since December 2019, which quickly became a worldwide pandemic in early 2020. There is
limited evidence on the mortality risk effect of pre-existing comorbidities for coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19), which has important implications for early treatment.
Objective: Evaluate the risk of pre-existing comorbidities on COVID-19 mortality, and provide
clinical suggestions accordingly.
Method: This study used a nested case-control design. A total of 94 publicly reported deaths in
locations outside of Hubei Province, China, between December 18th, 2019 and March 8th, 2020
were included as cases. Each case was matched with up to three controls, based on gender and
age Â± 1 year old (94 cases and 181 controls). The inverse probability weighted Cox proportional
hazard model was performed.
Results: History of comorbidities significantly increased the death risk of COVID-19: one
additional pre-existing comorbidity led to an estimated 40% higher risk of death (p<0.001). The
estimated mortality risk in patients with CHD was three times of those without CHD (p<0.001).
The estimated 30-day survival probability for a profile patient with pre-existing CHD (65-yearold female with no other comorbidities) was 0.53 (95% CI [0.34-0.82]), while it was 0.85 (95%
CI [0.79-0.91]) for those without CHD. Older age was also associated with increased death risk:
every 5-year increase in age was associated with a 20% increased risk of mortality (p<0.001).
Conclusion: Extra care and early medical intervention are needed for patients with pre-existing
comorbidities, especially CHD.

Introduction
Since the first report of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019 in
Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, the novel virus infection has rapidly spread to other cities in
China, and has now been detected in 186 countries and locations internationally [1]. On March
11th, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and has called for
aggressive actions from all countries to fight the disease. Current research has indicated that
COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a betacoronavirus similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the
genetic sequence [2]. Epidemiological evidence suggests that initially reported cases in China
had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market [3-4]. With the escalated spread of the
infection, there has been clear evidence of human to human transmission [5-6]. The most
common symptoms include fever, dry cough and fatigue [5-8], with presence of asymptomatic,
yet contagious cases [9].
According to the COVID-19 situation reports of WHO, as of March 29th, 2020, the
infection has caused 81,445 confirmed cases in mainland China, including 3,300 deaths.
Internationally, a total of 601,020 confirmed cases have been reported from 186 countries
outside of China, including 28,747 deaths. Considering the global public health threat posed by
COVID-19, unraveling the prognostic factors for patients, especially the risk factors of mortality
associated with COVID-19, has important implications for clinical practice and is urgently
warranted.
Studies have indicated that severe cases tend to be older in age [6, 8] and are more likely
to have had pre-existing medical conditions, including but not limited to hypertension [3, 6, 8],
diabetes [6, 8], cardiovascular diseases [3, 6, 8, 10-12], cerebrovascular diseases [6], chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [3, 8], cancer [13], and digestive diseases [14], in
comparison to non-severe cases [3, 6, 8-15]
Recently, scholarly attention focuses on identifying the risk factors for death from
COVID-19. Some evidence suggests that pre-existing medical conditions are likely death risk
factors for COVID-19. For example, a study based on 72,314 cases in China indicated that the
case-fatality rate (CFR) tends to be higher among those with older age, and having pre-existing
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension compared to all the patients [9]. Similarly, by
conducting logistic regression on odds of in-hospital death among 54 diseased patients and 137

recovered patients in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, Zhou et al. [16] found that older age, higher
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and d-dimer greater than 1ug/ml at hospital
admission were associated with increased odds of in-hospital death. Chen et al. (2020) found that
pre-existing hypertension and other cardiovascular complications were more common among
diseased patients than recovered patients (unpublished data).
However, several gaps remain in the understanding of risk factors for mortality of
COVID-19. First, most current research on pre-existing comorbidities of COVID-19 was based
on univariate comparison, which did not account for important confounders such as age and
gender [17-20]. Second, no studies have investigated the hazard of the identified risk factors over
time, or the probability of survival at a given time. Under the rapidly changing pandemic
situation, it is crucial to provide timely survival-time guidance for implementing the targeted
treatment to the high-risk patients in clinical practice. Third, most existing studies on mortality
risk factors were focused on patients diagnosed in Wuhan, Hubei Province, with little
understanding about the mortality risk factors outside of Hubei Province. The risk factors are
likely different inside and outside of Hubei Province, since current research has found that the
clinical symptom severity [5] and the fatality-case rate [9, 21] to be higher in Hubei Province
(the center of outbreak) than cities outside of Hubei Province in China. Fourth, no studies thus
far have taken into account the pandemic stage when evaluating mortality risk factors. It has
been found that average daily attack rate in China was different before and after January 11th
2020, since non-pharmaceutical interventions were taken by the government before this date
[22]. The change of pandemic stage may also influence the risk factors for fatality associated
with COVID-19.
To fill the above research gaps in the existing literature about the morality risk factors for
COVID-19, the present study conducted a nested case-control (NCC) study, aiming to evaluate
the risk of the common pre-existing comorbidities (hypertension, coronary heart disease,
diabetes and etc.) for mortality associated with COVID-19 in mainland China outside of Hubei
Province. NCC, also called risk set sampling, has been widely used in studying the fatal disease
risk effect in large pharmacoepidemiologic studies [23-28] and risk prediction in pandemic
influenza A (H1N1) 2009 (pH1N1) [29]. NCC is cost-effective in data collection, and is
especially suitable for research on the death risk of diseases such as COVID-19, where the
number of event-free people largely exceeds those who experienced events [30]. To attain this

goal, we employed survival analysis on 275 publicly reported confirmed cases, adjusting for age,
gender and the change in the pandemic stage in China (i.e., before and after January 11th, 2020).

Method
Study Design and Rationale
This study performed survival analysis under a nested case-control (NCC) design to
assess the roles of common comorbidities (cardiocerebrovascular, endocrine and respiratory
disease, etc.) in predicting mortality for COVID-19, among patients in mainland China outside of
Hubei Province. The study period was from December 18th, 2019, when the first laboratoryconfirmed case was announced in China, till March 8th, 2020.
The study cohort was defined as all the publicly reported confirmed COVID-19 patients
outside of Hubei Province in mainland China between the study period. During this period, 112
deaths outside of Hubei Province were reported by the National Health Committee of China, and
18 were excluded from the present study due to missingness of important clinical information. A
total of 448 publicly reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases (94 deaths and 354
survivors) were initially collected. The data collection procedure was blinded to patient
comorbidity information. All deaths were included as cases, and each case was matched with up
to three controls on gender and age Â± 1 year old (94 cases and 181 controls). The sample
distribution across all 32 province-level regions in mainland China is presented in Appendix
Table A1.
Data Collection Procedure
We routinely searched for daily news and public health reports on confirmed COVID-19
cases in all areas in mainland China outside of Hubei Province. Patientsâ clinical and
comorbidity characteristics were recorded and doubly confirmed by
national/provincial/municipal health commission websites, the official COVID-19 data reporting
websites in China. Follow-up time was defined as the duration from the date of disease onset till
the end of observation on March 8th or when the participant died, whichever came first. For each
eligible patient, we followed local reports to update their survival status until the end of followup time.
As illustrated in Figure 1, the inclusion criterion was publicly reported COVID-19 patients
who had complete information on basic demographics (age, gender and region), disease onset

date--the first time a patient became symptomatic, and history of comorbidities (include but not
limited to hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and respiratory diseases) were included
in the analysis. Asymptomatic patients were not included in this study. In addition, we defined
âcomorbidity-free patientsâ as those who were specifically described as âno pre-existing medical
condition/comorbidityâ on the national/provincial/municipal health commission websites.
In the following three steps, we used the No. 261 patient in the sample as an example to
introduce the dynamic tracking method we used to identify any missing dates:
Step 1. Conducting an internet search on confirmed cases on baidu.com, the largest search
engine in China, using keywords âconfirmed COVID-19 cases reportâ and âpre-existing
comorbidities.â A search result pertained to one confirmed case reported on the website of
Municipal Health Commission of Binzhou (Shandong Province) on February 17th,
described as âthe 15th confirmed case: 30-year-old male without pre-existing morbidities,
who lives in the neighborhood of Xincun Village. This patient was diagnosed positive on
February 16th and is being treated with precaution in Bincheng hospital.â We recorded
age, gender, region and comorbidity-free for this patient.
Step 2. We then determined the onset date of this patient based on another announcement
on the same website. In this announcement titled âPossible exposure locations and times of
the 15th confirmed case,â it says, âthe patient was symptomatic on February 14th.â
Step 3. Finally, we confirmed the event status of this patient as discharged on March 3rd,
by following the updates on this website.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were performed in R 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Baseline
clinical characteristics were shown as mean (SD), median (range), or number (%), with a
comparison of characteristics in subjects stratified by case and control via t-test for continuous
variables and chi-squared or Fisherâs exact test for binary variables.
In order to utilize the time-to-event information under the NCC design, the inverse
probability weighting Cox proportional hazard regression model was employed [32]. The
matching between cases and controls, and relative weights were simultaneously obtained via
KMprob function in multipleNCC R package [31], by specifying the Kaplan-Meier type weights
with additional matching on gender and age Â±1 year old. Only survivors were assigned weights,

since all cases (deaths) were included as designed with a weight of one. Those survivors with
sampling probabilities of zero were considered as âfail to matchâ and excluded from the study.
The total number of comorbidities was defined as the summation of comorbidities,
ranging from zero to four or above. Kaplan-Meier curve was plotted to check the proportional
hazard assumption and the Pearson correlation test was used to rule out the multicollinearity
concern before fitting any model. Univariate weighted Cox models were performed for each
comorbidity. The multivariate weighted Cox model was used to determine if pre-existing
comorbidity yielded prognostic hazard information. We included those comorbidities that were
marginally significant (p<0.1) in the univariate analysis to the multivariate model. Other than the
common risk factors (age and gender), the multivariate model also adjusted for early period of
pandemic (after vs. before January 11th, 2020 when no-intervention was taken by the
government) [22]. Although matching was based on age and gender, we adjusted for the
matching covariates, since the matching was broken with inverse probability weighting [32]. A
separate multivariate model was built by using the total number of pre-existing comorbidities as
an ordinal predictor, adjusting for the same covariates. Hazard ratios (HRs) from the weighted
Cox model were reported along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values. Sensitivity
analysis was performed using multivariate logistic regression to provide estimated odds ratio
(ORs), which includes the same covariates as the multivariate weighted Cox model.
Weighted Cox model-based survival estimates were plotted for an example patient profile
(65-year-old female with no other comorbidities) to compare the survival probability over time
with and without CHD. The log-rank test was used to compare the median survival difference.
Ethics Approval
The study was approved by Shanghai Jiao Tong University Public Health and Nursing
Medical Research Ethics Committee (SJUPN-202001).

age tended to be older in the case group (70.7 years old) than in the control group (64.2 years
old). Median ages were similar to mean ages in both groups. A majority (62.9%) of the patients
were male. Overall, 25.5% of the total patients had clinical symptoms associated with COVID19 before January 11th, 2020. A relatively small proportion of the total sample had COPD, renal
failure, history of surgery and hepatic failure (4.4%, 4.4%, 3.6% or 1.1%). Among all preexisting comorbidities with over 5% of the total sample, hypertension was the most common
(39.6%), followed by diabetes (26.2%), CHD (14.5%), cardiac failure (8%), cerebral infarction
(6.9%) and chronic bronchitis (6.9%). Patients in the case group had more CHD (p<0.001) and
more cerebral infarction (p=0.05), compared to those in the control group. A majority of the total
sample had at least one pre-existing comorbidity (67.6%), specifically around 25% had one, 22%
had two, 11% had three, and 10% had four or more. Compared to the control group, more
patients in the case group had pre-existing comorbidities (p=0.02), especially those who had four
or more comorbidities (p<0.001).
Model Results
Results of the Pearson correlation test showed no significant correlations among the
presence of comorbidities of interest, and the assumption of the proportional hazard was not
violated.
Table 2 presents the results of univariate and multivariate weighted Cox models. Older
age was associated with significantly higher death risk with similar magnitude in univariate and
multivariate models. In the adjusted model, every 5-year increase in age was associated with an
estimated 20% higher risk of death (p<0.001). No significant hazard difference was found
between male and female patients. Disease infection during the early no-intervention period was
associated with a higher risk of death, although not statistically significant.
The increasing number of cumulative comorbidities was associated with higher mortality
risk in both unadjusted and adjusted models (p<0.001). Moreover, one additional pre-existing
comorbidity was associated with a 40% increased risk in mortality of COVID-19. All preexisting comorbidities were associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality in the
univariate model, of which CHD had the largest hazard ratio (HR) of 4.2 (p<0.001), followed by
cerebral infarction (HR=2.9, p=0.004), COPD (HR=2.6, p=0.01), renal failure (HR=2.3, p=0.09),
cardiac failure (HR=1.9, p=0.1), history of surgery (HR=1.7, p=0.34), hypertension (HR=1.4,

p=0.17), diabetes (HR=1.1, p=0.61) and chronic bronchitis (HR=1.1, p=0.55). After adjusting for
age, gender, and early period of pandemic in China, CHD was the only comorbidity that yielded
a significant death risk: COVID-19 patients with pre-existing CHD had an estimated 2.9 times
death risk of those without CHD. In addition, cerebral infarction, COPD, and renal failure all had
an estimated HR of around 2.0, respectively. Similar results were observed by using unweighted
logistic regression in a sensitivity analysis (Appendix Table A2).
The overall median follow-up was 40 days, during which 94 deaths were observed.
Figure 2 shows the estimated survival probability over 70 days for an example patient profile
with and without CHD (65-year-old female with no other comorbidities). For such patient
profile, having pre-existing CHD led to a significantly shorter survival probability over time,
compared to those without CHD (p<0.001). For those with CHD, the estimated 30-day survival
probability was 0.53 (95% CI [0.34-0.82]), with an estimated 34 daysâ median survival time. On
the other hand, the estimated 30-day probability was 0.85 (95% CI [0.79-0.91]) for those without
CHD, with the corresponding median survival time over 70 days.
Discussion
In this paper, we used survival analysis to estimate the fatal risk of pre-existing
comorbidities in COVID-19, based on publicly reported confirmed cases and adjusted for the
confounding effect of age, gender, and early period of the pandemic when no-intervention was
taken. There were three major findings: First, a history of comorbidities significantly increased
the death risk of COVID-19: one additional pre-existing comorbidity led to an estimated 40%
increase of death risk (p<0.001). Second, after adjusting for confounders, CHD was the only
significant risk factor for COVID-19 mortality. Patients with CHD had a 200% higher risk of
mortality in COVID-19, compared to patients without CHD (p<0.001). For a patient profile (65year-old female without other comorbidities), the estimated median survival times for those with
CHD was 34 days, while it was over 70 days for those without CHD (p<0.001). Third, older age
was associated with increased death risk. Specifically, every 5-year increase in age was
associated with a 20% increased risk of mortality (p<0.001).
To our best knowledge, the present study is the first to provide substantial statistical
evidence to show the effect of CHD in predicting mortality for COVID-19. This result is
consistent with previous studies that found higher case-fatality rate among patients with

cardiovascular disease [9, 15]. It is worth pointing out that the existing studies [9, 16] that
investigate prognostic factors for death used chi-square tests or univariate logistic regression that
does not control for potential confounders. In contrast, by conducting weighted Cox proportional
hazard regression models, our study used time-to-event outcomes, which offers more survivaltime-related information to help guide the clinical intervention and more statistical power to
detect risk factors [33-34].
Previous studies have indicated that cardiovascular events following pneumonia may
increase the risk of mortality [35-41], which explained our findings from the point view of
pathophysiological mechanisms. One potential mechanism underlying the association between
pneumonia and cardiovascular events is inflammation [38]. Specifically, the inflammatory
reaction following pneumonia can result in plague instability and damage in the blood vessels,
where evidence of elevated local inflammation in the atherosclerotic coronary arteries following
acute systemic infections have been shown in many studies [38, 40]. Thus, infections may result
in heightened loading imposed on cardiomyocytes, and lead to sympathetic hyperactivity,
ischemia, which may increase the risk of arrhythmia and heart failure in COVID-19 patients with
pre-existing CHD [37].
Given the limited understanding of the prognostic factors for COVID-19, more research,
potentially prospective studies, are needed to investigate the mechanism by which pre-existing
CHD may influence the survival probability among patients with COVID-19. From the clinical
point of view, early evaluation of patient medical history is necessary to implement early
medical interventions and decrease the mortality risk. We suggest monitoring the dynamic heart
rate for patients with pre-existing CHD. For those severe-symptomatic patients who had preexisting heart ischemia and abnormal heart function, early medical intervention may be needed
[41].
Furthermore, our results indicated that the hazard of COVID-19 death was significantly
higher in patients at older ages. Adjusting for others, every 5-year increase in age was associated
with a 22% increased risk of death, similarly to what was found in previous studies [8, 9, 16].
Alongside the evidence of prognostic risk in CHD, we suggest that extra care is needed for those
with CHD, especially for elderly patients.
The design of excluding patients from Hubei Province was based on the concerns of
unknown confounders caused by insufficient medical resources in the epicenter. CDCâs report

has pointed out that the rapidly increasing number of infections could easily crash the health care
system by exceeding its maximum capacity [42]. Therefore, analyzing patient data outside of
Hubei Province can avoid the competing death risk caused by insufficient health care resources,
and reveal the true underlying impact of pre-existing comorbidities on COVID-19 mortality [44].
One limitation of the present study lies in the nature of publicly reported data.
Researchers have pointed out that severe cases may be over-represented in publicly reported data
[45]. Nevertheless, we have managed to reduce the potential bias caused by severe case overrepresentation, through the appropriate matching between cases and controls in NCC design. The
auto-matching procedure via statistical program also prevented the possibility of tendentiously
selecting survivors with comorbidity-free history during data collection. In addition, NCC design
is favored in our situation where the risk factor data and event of interest can be identified
opportunistically from publicly reported confirmed cases [30]. Therefore, NCC was the optimal
choice, given the restricted availability of public data.
In conclusion, our findings provided preliminary yet strong evidence supporting the
association between pre-existing CHD and mortality risk for patients with COVID-19. Based on
our findings, close monitoring, extra care, and early medical intervention are needed for patients
with pre-existing CHD, to reduce the mortality risk associated with COVID-19.
