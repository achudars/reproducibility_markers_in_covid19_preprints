Abstract
Objectives Healthcare workers have a greater exposure to individuals with confirmed SARSnovel coronavirus 2, and an estimated 5-fold higher probability of contracting coronavirus
disease (COVID)-19, than the general population. Many organisations have called for risk
assessments to be put in place to minimise this risk. We wished to explore the predictive
role of basic demographics in order to establish a simple tool that could help risk stratify
healthcare workers.
Setting We undertook a review of the published literature (including multiple search
strategies in MEDLINE with PubMed interface) and critically assessed early reports on
medRxiv, a pre-print server (https://www.medrxiv.org: date of last search: December 21,
2020). We explored the relative risk of mortality from readily available demographics in
order to identify the population at highest risk.
Results: The only published studies specifically assessing the risk of healthcare workers had
limited demographics available, therefore we explored the general population in the
literature.
Clinician Demographics. Mortality increased with increasing age from 50 years onwards.
Male sex at birth, people of black and minority ethnicity groups had higher susceptibility to
both hospitalisation and mortality. Co-morbid Disease. Vascular disease, renal disease,
diabetes and chronic pulmonary disease further increased risk.
Risk stratification tool. A risk stratification tool was compiled using a Caucasian female
<50years with no comorbidities as a reference. A point allocated to risk factors associated
with an approximate doubling in risk. This tool provides numerical support for healthcare
workers when determining which team members should be allocated to patient facing
clinical duties compared to remote supportive roles.
Conclusions. We have generated a tool which can provide a framework for objective risk
stratification of doctors and health care professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic,
without requiring disclosure of information that an individual may not wish to share with
their direct line manager during the risk assessment process.

Strengths and limitations of this study
•

There is an increased risk of mortality in the clinical workforce due to the effects of
COVID-19.

•

This manuscript outlines a simple risk stratification tool that helps to quantify an
individual’s biological risk

•

This will assist team leaders when allocating roles within clinical departments.

•

This tool does not incorporate other external factors, such as high-risk household
members or those at higher risk of mental health issues, that may require additional
consideration when allocating clinical duties in an appropriate clinical domain.

•

This population-based analysis did not explain for the very high risk observed in BAME
healthcare workers suggesting there are other issues at play that require addressing.

The Health and Safety executive mandate that all employers protect their employees from
harm under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999. There are
three key elements to this, identify what could cause the injury (the hazard), decide how
likely that someone could be harmed and how seriously they are likely to be harmed (the
vulnerability), and what actions can be taken to minimise this risk (the mitigation). In the
current coronavirus pandemic, it is clear the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the agent
that causes injury. The risk of harm is higher in healthcare workers compared to the general
population1, and thus action is required to minimise this risk. In the early phase of the
pandemic, the Office of National Statistics reported medical practitioners had a 2.5-fold
increase (95% CI 1.5-4.3) in mortality compared to the average mortality from 2014-2018.2.
This compared to a 50% increased risk in the age-matched general population (HR 1.5,
95%CI 1.5-1.6). This trend was in keeping with observations in other countries of higher
mortality amongst health care workers3-7.
Whilst reasonable measures must be taken to protect all staff members from infection,
individuals thought to be at particularly vulnerable from infection may require modification
of their practice. The Faculty of Occupational Medicine and NHS Employers in England
produced recommendations that all health care practitioners should receive an occupational
risk assessment8 9. These frameworks were borne of the observation that certain ethnic
groups appeared to be at higher risk than others9, whilst recognising there are several other
biological parameters, such as age, male sex, prior cardiovascular disease, and diabetes that
were also associated with adverse outcomes. These predictors of hospitalisation, progression
to intensive care units, and ultimately death were been reaffirmed in the Public Health
England document10.
Despite the intention to improve risk assessment in healthcare settings, these frameworks
failed to produce an objective tool in order to improve stratification across the health care
system. The need for an such a tool is highlighted by the disproportionate impact of COVID19 on healthcare workers of black, Asian and minority ethnicity (BAME) descent. Up to the
21st April 2020, 36% and 27% of the fatalities came from people of Indian Asian heritage and
Black African descent respectively, despite those populations only representing 10% and 6%
of the work force. Existing data suggest biological parameters do not account for all this

increased risk, raising the possibility of cultural differences in self-assessment of risk or
systemic challenges in modification of hazards for people of different ethnic background.
Indeed, these cultural challenges have been proposed as a contributor to the increased risk
in BAME populations.
Using published data on the demographics of those who have been hospitalised, and
ultimately died, due to COVID-19 compared to the general population prevalence in these
determinants we have developed an objective risk stratification tool. Creation of such an
objective tool that can be applied equally and without favour to all health care practitioners
allows biological risk to be evaluated and used to reduce hazard.
Methods.
We reviewed the published literature (including multiple search strategies in MEDLINE with
PubMed interface), EMBASE and critically assessed early reports on medRxiv, a pre-print
server (https://www.medrxiv.org/) (date of last search: December 21, 2020).
Eligibility criteria
Studies were included according to the following criteria
Search terms: COVID-19, Coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, Coronavirus AND mortality,
hospitalisation
Participants: As it had already been observed that there were differences in the
impact of COVID-19 in different geographic locations and different socio-economic
circumstances, we limited the search to reports from the UK.
Outcomes: Given there are selection biases in testing for coronavirus, COVID-19 care
and reporting, we explored predominantly the ‘hard outcomes’ of admission to the intensive
care unit and mortality. Whereas, the occurrence of mild symptoms and asymptomatic
disease may have an impact on the health systems ability to function and nosocomial spread,
it would not cause significant long term consequences and thus was not considered as an
outcome.
Information sources and search strategy
We searched the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the preprint server
MedRxiv from inception to 22nd December 2020. Only English language manuscripts were

included. The reference lists of included reports were also searched for additional reports.
The majority of the existing analyses are based on retrospective and often single-centre
series. No published or completed prospective cohort studies or randomized controlled
trials were present in this literature search. We reviewed the case reports and cohort
studies and where possible the local demographics. Because of the urgency to improve risk
stratification in the middle of the ongoing pandemic, reports were considered that
otherwise would not have met the rigors of a systematic review. All reports were assessed
for risk of bias (ROB) using the Cochrane ROB 2.0 tool 11, however this assessment was used
to inform the weighting given to the information contained therein when being reviewed by
the experts in order to form a consensus risk assessment tool.
The nature of the risk tool was the subject of several focus group meetings. The
requirement was for it to be simple to complete, be objective such that it could stratify
vulnerability of exposure, and not reveal personal information such as may be misused by
“line managers” after the pandemic. The latter requirement was a particular request of the
Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) representatives to the focus groups, who feel that
they are particularly vulnerable to workplace bullying 12. As a result, the requirement for a
single page risk assessment tool presenting cumulative factors that could be completed
ahead of a conversation with the designated manager and present a clear stratification of
vulnerability.
Risk of hospitalisation and mortality was analysed compared to population prevalence.
Multivariate Cox regression modelling was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratio. Risk was
normalised to a female aged 40-49, and an integer to approximate the impact of
demographics, such as age13, ethnicity14 and important co-morbidities15 assigned.
There were two principle sources of data; the intensive care national audit and research
centre (ICNARC) report which collated data from the national clinical audit covering all NHS
adult, general intensive care and combined intensive care/high dependency units in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland, plus some additional specialist and non-NHS critical care units,
and the OPENSAFELY report which quantified a range of risk factors for death from COVID-19
based on primary care records16. Given these two principle sources of data, we collated and

compared to the risk of admission to ITU and mortality from the ICNARC study with general
population data 17. Predictive risk modelling was used to predict vulnerability of individuals.
This risk tool was standardised to the risk of mortality of a female under the age of 50 years.
A point was then allocated for each approximate doubling in risk. Given the likely co-linearity
of multiple risk factors where risk was a greater multiple than two it was rounded down. Since
the purpose of this objective risk assessment tool is to supplement rather than supplant
existing Public Health England recommendations, characteristics that warranted shielding
according to the NHS Digital shielded patient list algorithm were discounted. Risk factors were
only included in the derived objective risk assessment tool if they confidence interval of their
independent predictive role did not cross the line of unity (i.e. p<0.05)
Once a simplified risk tool was compiled this was validated using the composite hazard ratios
derived from the OpenSafely platform report18. We evaluated the risk in 317 cases within a
trust and stratified them into low, middle and high risk. Agreement between the objective
risk assessment tool and the calculated hazard ratio was evaluated using Cohen’s kappa
coefficient for inter-rater agreement.

Results
Multiple global observational studies were identified describing the risk of hospitalisation and
mortality due to COVID-19, however there was significant heterogeneity in these studies,
such that the robust nature of the data when applying to a UK population of health care
providers was questionable (Supplementary table 1). One point of agreement, however, was
that multiple co-morbidities appeared to confer cumulative risk. As a result, the development
of a risk calculator was based exclusively on UK data, with multiple co-morbidities being given
additive weighting.
Clinician Demographics.
Age and sex. In all age groups, mortality was at least twice as high in men as in women (Table
1). Compared to those under the age of 50, mortality was doubled in 50-59 year-olds,
quadrupled in the 60-69 years age group, and 12 times higher after the age of 70 years in
men.

Ethnicity.
People of non-white ethnic origin were at a higher risk of hospitalisation and mortality than
the general population. Raw data suggested this was between 2-4 fold increased risk
compared to the local population, and for COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19 viral
pneumoniae over the previous 3 years.19 This was, in part, explained by the premature onset
of co-morbidities that also conferred risk, such as type 2 diabetes, ischaemic heart disease
and stroke.

20-23

After multivariate adjustment, however, some of this risk could not be

accounted for with conventional risk factors, and therefore an ethnicity adjustment was
included. This is most accentuated in people of black African descent where the risk was twofold elevated compared to those of white European descent. People of Indian Asian descent
also had an approximately 50% increased risk of hospitalisation compared to their European
counterparts.
Socioeconomic status. As with flu, 25% of ICU admissions are people from the most deprived
quintile as evaluated compared with just 15% from the least deprived (Table 2). Once on ITU,
however, there were only slight differences in mortality between people in the most deprived
vs least deprived status.
Co-morbidities.
There were multiple co-morbid factors that were each incrementally associated with
increased mortality. The most common recorded comorbidities are chronic cardiac disease
(29%), uncomplicated diabetes (19%), chronic pulmonary disease excluding asthma (19%) and
asthma (14%) (Table 2) 24. These represented 16,749 patients: 7,924 (47%) patients had no
documented reported comorbidity. Although numerically not a large percentage of patients,
those with active malignant neoplasms, chronic kidney disease or liver disease were at
between 3 and 5-fold increased risk of hospitalisation respectively compared to the
prevalence in the general population. Although data was sparse, there was a suggestion that
other conditions requiring long term immunosuppressant therapy was similarly overrepresented by approximately 50% (data not shown). Similarly, dementia was associated with
a significantly higher risk than the general population of both hospitalisation (~7.7 times
increased) and mortality in hospital (39% increase). This has limited relevance for modifying

clinical exposure, although may be pertinent if using this tool to assess risk within the
community. Contrary to many popular media reports, the increased risk of hospitalisation and
mortality for people living with obesity was in the first stages accounted for by co-morbidities
such as diabetes, ischaemic heart disease and stroke. Beyond a BMI of 35kg/m2 (or 30kg/m2
in people of Asian and Black African descent), however, there was an independent predictive
increased risk.
Generating an objective risk stratification tool
By considering each of the demonstrated associated factors for COVID-19 hospitalisation and
subsequent mortality, a risk stratification tool was generated that may be considered when
allocating clinical individuals to standard or higher risk duties (Table 3). The risk model
attributes a point for every approximate doubling of risk compared to the reference
population (Hazard Ratio ≥1.75 and ≤2.25). By adding the risk score from each category, it
gives every individual a personal risk score which provides an estimate of their biological
hazard.
When validating this tool against the 317 predefined cases in a single NHS trust, the outcomes
of the ORS tool correlated well with absolute risk scores in the OpenSafely platform (Cohen’s
kappa 0.76 SD 0.071; p<0.0001; Table 4). A final validation was performed against the Public
Health England document “Disparities in the risk and outcomes of COVID-19”.10 This
demonstrated a similarly high level of agreement (Cohen’s kappa 0.81 SD 0.063; p<0.0001).
Pregnancy
There is currently insufficient data to make any meaningful assessment about the risk of
COVID-19 to either the mother or the unborn child. Early reports from the UK and the USA
suggest there is no risk to either, however these are based on small numbers. 25 26 Given the
unknown risk to both parties, although pregnancy is not considered as a risk factor in its own
right, we would recommend all people who are pregnant be regarded as high risk and offered
the option to shield.

There are currently no reliable data for COVID-19 related deaths in health care professionals
including doctors; and surprisingly few data on the differences in risk in different healthcare
settings. There is an urgent need for high quality research. We have applied general
population risk factors to health care workers in order to generate a simplified biological risk
stratification tool. This may serve to inform employers when allocating specific duties within
the health care provision system, in order to fulfil their duty of care to their employees.
There are three types of risk for medical staff. The first relates to their biology, the second
their environment and the third to the exposure. This tool evaluates the former in order to
advise mitigation of the latter by stratifying individuals to lower, medium and higher risk. This
biological risk assessment tool does not in any way replace the need for universal precautions
with appropriate personal protective equipment. It should only be used to inform the need
for modification of allocated duties to roles with little or no direct contact with patients, such
as “advice and guidance” services, or virtual clinic provision. It incorporates and weights
recognised risk factors. Many of these factors are predictable, such as age, gender, and preexisting respiratory disease all of which have been associated with many previous viral
infections such as H1N1 influenza.
The importance of pre-existing cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease is a novel
observation for a respiratory disease. This may be due to the method of cellular invasion of
SARS-CoV-2 using the ACE2 enzyme; an enzyme which is responsible for physiological vascular
health responses to hypertension and obesity. It does not, however, explain the risk
associated with diabetes27, nor does it account for the increased risk in some ethnic groups.
A recent finding showed that Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) individuals account for
63 per cent, 64 per cent and 95 per cent of deaths in the Nurse, Health Care Assistant and
Doctor staff groups, respectively1. These figures are substantially higher than the proportional
increase in BAME patients in UK intensive care units (mortality of 18% compared to 12% in
the general population)19. Interestingly, our tool distinguished between people of Black
African descent and people of other non-European backgrounds, awarding a higher risk to
those of West African descent. When validating the ORS tool against the OpenSafely report,
however, the differential point award demonstrated similar overall predictive role in people
of Black African descent as other ethnicities. This is likely due to different confounding disease

profile in these populations. People of Indian subcontinent heritage develop additional risk
factors such as diabetes and premature cardiovascular disease approximately 10 years earlier
than the European counterparts. People of Black African descent, however, are more likely to
be affected by unmeasured risk factors such as haemoglobinopathies and systemic
microvascular dysfunction 28 29.
Application of the ORS tool
The primary role of any risk stratification tool is to provide a standardised approach to
individual risk management by identifying those with the greatest hazard of adverse
consequences from hazards.
Once individual risk is stratified, decisions regarding mitigating actions are required.
Unfortunately, there remains uncertainty regarding the best action. The impact of recurrent
exposure compared to high-risk exposures with high viral load, or the environment of the
clinical domain is uncertain. Likewise, the relative impact of different environments has not
adequately been assessed. Currently, employees in front-line emergency and acute medical
settings such as A&E medicine, anaesthesia, respiratory medicine or gastroenterology may be
considered at increased risk, as may be those who may need very close proximity with the
patient such as ENT and ophthalmology. Some paradoxes have been observed. One recent
paper found that the rate of infection with COVID-19 in staff in patient-facing occupations
was no different from that in clerical/administrative staff without patient contact30 suggesting
that PPE provides effective protection. Conversely, those later in the disease process with
severe illness (particularly at the time of cytokine storm requiring high dependency care) may
have reduced viral load and shedding31 therefore paradoxically have a lower potential to
transmit infection compared to those at an early stage of the disease with no or relatively
mild symptoms.
The ORS tool enables employers to decide when to exclude workers from working in
presumed higher risk environments - even if workers do not wish to do so – or modify the
nature of their duties, in order to fulfil the employers’ legal duty of care obligations to their
work force. It must be acknowledged that this tool is based purely on biological risk of an
individual. The prevalence of the disease in the community is another determinant which

13

should be considered; when prevalence is low, the increased relative risk may not reflect a
significant absolute risk, allowing health care practitioners to return to their usual role.
Study limitations.
Selection bias in testing, care and reporting can lead to differences in prevalence estimates
of pre-existing risk factors and presentation across the reports from various countries. The
majority of the existing analyses are based on retrospective and often single-centre series.
No published or completed prospective cohort studies or randomised controlled trials were
present in this literature search. A limitation is that we only searched Pubmed, EMBASE and
preprint servers. There is an urgent need for high quality research, using individual level data
for healthcare workers that will allow full mediation analyses in order to determine whether
(for example) it is the age, the diabetes, or the cardiovascular disease that actually carries the
greatest prognostic risk, given that these conditions commonly co-exist, and explore the
disparity in BAME individuals between the general population and the healthcare deaths.
There are currently only limited observational data for COVID-19 related deaths in health care
workers or doctors, again without full access to all potentially pertinent information..
Importantly, this tool was derived from UK data, and therefore may not be relevant in other
countries, however the methods employed here can be replicated in other healthcare
settings.
Patient and public involvement
The primary target of this research was healthcare professionals, occupational health teams
and medical managers. There was significant engagement with members of the British
Medical Association – the trade union representing UK doctors - COVID group, and the staff
members. Several members of this group are listed as co-authors, including the chair of the
representative body. It is important to distinguish that these individuals are reporting
personal views based on their branch of practice and these are not necessarily the views of
the Association.
Concluding Remarks and Key Messages.
As part of an employer’s legal obligation under the Health and Safety legislation all individuals
are required to have a formal risk assessment. Although many organisations have advocated

the need for individualised risk evaluation there remains no standardised methodology for
this assessment. Without a consistent approach to stratification, comparing individuals’
personal risk within a department is difficult if not impossible. We have presented a robust
scoring tool that allows comparisons and thus decisions to be made regarding the appropriate
allocation of duties within a team. This also facilitates open discussion between staff who are
being asked to work in patient facing areas and their team leaders, so they also understand
their risks. All healthcare workers should wear appropriate PPE for any clinical examination
or investigation on the basis that 20-40% of infected patients, especially if less than 40 years
of age may be asymptomatic32. Within a specialty team, the highest risk individuals should be
excluded from patient facing clinical areas; those at intermediate risk should have careful
consideration to exclude them from front line areas or given limited duties avoiding close
contact such as in ENT, ophthalmology and dentistry. Those at the lowest risk may be assigned
duties with more patient contact. Neither the ORS tool, nor any other risk score, negates the
need for good personal protective equipment and training.
