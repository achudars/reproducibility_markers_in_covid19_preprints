Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel respiratory disease caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in December 2019.
It is vitally important to perform a seroprevalence study to estimate the percentage of
people with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the patient population with ocular surface
diseases. IgG and IgM antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and
nucleoprotein were measured using a commercially available magnetic
chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay kit. Throat swabs were tested for SARSCoV-2 RNA in a designated virology laboratory. A total of 6, 414 individuals were
enrolled. All participants throat swabs were RT-PCR-negative for SARS-CoV-2.
Seroprevalence in the patient population was 0.31%. And the seroprevalevce in ocular
surface diseases, no-ocular surface diseases and no-ocular diseases are 1.82% (6/330),
0.22% (10/4614) and 0.27% (4/1470) respectively.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel respiratory disease caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in December
2019.1 It is noteworthy that some patients have ocular manifestations, including
conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, and increased secretions. 2 SARS-CoV-2
receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and entry protease transmembrane
serine protease 2 are strongly detected in human ocular surfaces, indicating that they
might provide SARS-CoV-2 with a portal of entry.3 Thus, it is vitally important to
perform a seroprevalence study to estimate the percentage of people with SARS-CoV2 antibodies in the patient population with ocular surface diseases.
Methods
This study included individuals with various ocular diseases in the Eye and ENT
Hospital of Fudan University (Fenyang branch and Pujiang branch) from May to
October 2020. Ethics approval was obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of the
Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University. The study adhered to the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.
IgG and IgM antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleoprotein
were measured using a commercially available magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme
immunoassay kit (Bioscience, Chongqing, China). Antibody levels were expressed as
the ratio of the chemiluminescence signal to the cutoff (S/CO) value. An S/CO value
higher than 1 for either IgG or IgM was considered positive. If the S/CO value was
higher than 0.7 but lower than 1.1, the serum sample was re-analyzed. Serological
assays for SARS-CoV-2 infection have been validated in a previous study. 4 Throat
swabs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a designated virology laboratory
(KingMed Diagnostics, Shanghai, China) using RT-PCR assays.
Results
A total of 6, 414 individuals were enrolled. All participants' throat swabs were RTPCR-negative for SARS-CoV-2. The levels of IgM and IgG antibodies are presented in
Figure 1.
Seroprevalence in the patient population was 0.31%. And the seroprevalevce in
ocular surface diseases, no-ocular surface diseases and no-ocular diseases are 1.82%
(6/330), 0.22% (10/4614) and 0.27% (4/1470) respectively (Table 1).
In the 20 seroprevalence positive patients，there are 15 females and 5 males.
Patients with IgM seropositivity were twice as many as those with IgG seropositivity.
Only one patient had both IgG and IgM seropositivity.

Our results showed that seroprevalence in ocular surface diseases group were
particularly higher than other groups. Clinical and scientific evidence suggests that the
human ocular surface is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.5 Our previous study
suggested that SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is expressed in human, especiallydiseased
conjunctival tissue.6 Therefore, it is possible that in patients with ocular diseases—
especially ocular surface diseases, such as keratitis and conjunctival cyst— ACE2 is
upregulated, making them more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.6 This may be
the reason that seroprevalence was particularly high in patient population with ocular
surface diseases.
Our study has certain limitations. It was a single-center study, and the patient
sample was not large enough, which might have influenced the seroprevalence
estimation. Moreover, if samples were collected before infected individuals had a
serological response, the serological assays may have produced false negatives. In
conclusion, seroprevalence was particularly high in patients with ocular surface
diseases. Therefore, increasing awareness of eye protection during the pandemic is
necessary, especially for individuals with ocular surface diseases.

calculated by dividing the chemiluminescence signal by the cutoff value (S/CO). The
dotted line means that the antibody level is at the cutoff point (S/CO = 1).
