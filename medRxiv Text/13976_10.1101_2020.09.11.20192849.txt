Abstract

24

Evidence has shown that the prescribed lockdown and physical distancing due to the novel

25

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have made accessing essential health care services much

26

difficult in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Access to contraception is essential and

27

should not be denied, even in a global crisis, because it is associated with several health benefits.

28

It is paramount to maintain timely access to contraception without unnecessary barriers. Hence,

29

this study examines the factors contributing to limited access to condoms and sources of

30

condoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa (SA).The first secondary dataset on

31

coronavirus from the National Income Dynamic Study (NIDS) conducted in SA during the

32

coronavirus pandemic was employed in this study. This study involved 4,517 respondents. Data

33

were analysed using frequency analysis, chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis.

34

Almost one-quarter of South Africans could not access condoms, and every 7 in 10 South

35

Africans preferred public or government hospitals as a source of condoms. Female South

36

Africans (aOR=0.86; 95% CI=0.69-1.08), those aged 35-45 (aOR=0.96; 95% CI=0.73-1.28) and

37

those residing in KwaZulu-Natal province (aOR=0.30; 95% CI=0.17-0.52) were 14%, 4% and

38

70% respectively less likely to have access to condoms during the COVID-19 lockdown.

39

Findings from the study suggest strategies and interventions that will be tailored towards non-

40

obstruction of contraception access during the on-going COVID-19 or any future pandemic.

41

Moreover, special consideration should be given to certain provinces, the uneducated and those

42

in the 4th quintile of wealth-income in South Africa.

Introduction

47

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has revealed how strikingly unprepared the

48

world is for a pandemic and how easily viruses spread in our interconnected world (1). It has also

49

been shown to be highly contagious (2), and this has radically changed social relations in the

50

world (3).

51

The strain that the outbreak imposes on health systems will undoubtedly impact the sexual and

52

reproductive health of individuals living in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) (4, 5)

53

with such consequences as halt the supply of contraceptive products, including condoms, due to

54

restriction imposed as a result of lockdown and physical distancing (6, 7).

55

Developing countries within Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia bears the maximum burden

56

of unmet need for modern contraceptives, accounting for 57% of total global unmet needs, of

57

which 39% of these women reside in developing countries (8). Despite the doubling in the

58

number of women consuming modern contraceptive methods from 470 million in 1990 to around

59

840 million in 2019, an estimated 214 million women in developing countries still had unmet

60

needs for contraceptives (8).

61

This is equally apparent as Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region continues to have the lowest

62

contraceptive prevalence at 24% and the highest level of unmet need at 25% (9). There are

63

numerous barriers to receiving high-quality healthcare in SSA (10). However, multiple factors

64

such as poverty, illiteracy, lack of knowledge and awareness about contraceptives, non-

65

availability of contraceptives and other factors have been linked to low use of contraceptive in

66

this region (8), but the most recent is the limited access to sexual and reproductive healthcare

67

(SRH) services which makes accessibility of contraception limited (11).

68

Healthcare access is defined as the opportunity to identify healthcare needs, seek healthcare

69

services, reach, obtain or use healthcare services, and require services fulfilled (12). It’s pertinent

70

to know that access to required medications or services is central to achieving universal health

71

coverage (13). For instance, a recent study in Italy concluded that nine out of every fifteen adults

72

indulged in risky sexual behaviour due to lack of access to condoms due to coronavirus outbreak

73

in the country (14).

74

Evidence has also shown that the prescribed lockdown and physical distancing due to COVID-19

75

have made accessing essential health care much more difficult in LMICs (15). Access to

76

contraception is essential and should not be denied, even in the time of a global crisis (16).

77

Effective contraception significantly reduces maternal mortality by preventing unintended

78

pregnancy and the inherent risks associated with pregnancy; for these reasons and more, it is

79

paramount to maintain timely access to contraception without unnecessary barriers (16).

80

Guttmacher Institute Authors and other studies estimated that if there were a 10% decline over a

81

year in the use of contraception as a result of inadequate access because of the ongoing

82

pandemic, an additional of over 48 million women would have an unmet need for contraception

83

worldwide, resulting in more than 15 million additional unintended pregnancies (17-19), which

84

may lead to unsafe abortions and higher extra spending in the future on sexual and reproductive

85

health outcomes as a result of coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (20-22).

86

The first cases of SARS-CoV-2 were declared in Africa in late February and early March 2020

87

(23). South Africa (SA) had its first case reported on March 06, 2020 (24); since then, cases have

88

increased to over 638,000 and more than 15,000 deaths have been recorded as of 8th of

89

September, 2020 (25).

90

President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a nationwide lockdown on 23 March 2020 to help curb the

91

spread of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease outbreak (COVID-19) in SA and to encourage health

92

systems to plan for the may influx of moderate to severe cases of COVID-19 (26, 27). In

93

addition to the national lockdown, other physical distancing steps such as isolation of persons

94

infected with the COVID-19 and quarantining of anyone who might have been exposed or in

95

contact with an infected individual were also encouraged and implemented (28).

96

Despite World Health Organization (WHO) advises to Federal and state governments that

97

preparedness efforts should focus on access to “essential medicines” and healthcare services to

98

satisfy the priority health needs of the population (29). However, certain individuals within

99

households and communities in South Africa were deprived of access to essential medicine or

100

health care services, including sexual and reproductive health services and contraception,

101

because they feel obligated to uphold the lockdown and prevent transmission of COVD-19, as

102

such these individuals choice of contraception are being influenced by location or source of

103

contraception (30).

104

South Africa's overall unmet need for contraception of 18%, while the contraceptive prevalence

105

rate (CPR) for married women is 54% and 64% for unmarried women (31). Although the effects

106

of contraceptive obstruction during pandemics are often not the direct result of the pandemic,

107

instead they are indirect consequences of strained health care systems, disruptions in care and

108

redirected resources to pandemic needs (32, 33)

109

It’s imperative to note that before the COVID-19 outbreak, access to optimal healthcare has also

110

been facing major sociodemographic inequalities (34) and these Socio-demographic

111

inequalities contribute to unequal access to quality health care (35). However, with the current

112

evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need for concerted actions towards ensuring

113

individuals who need essential access to sexual and reproductive health, including the provision

114

of contraception services, are not obstructed (4, 36). Thus, there is a need to examine South

115

Africans' demographic and economic characteristics’ access to condoms and sources of condoms

116

during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods and Materials

123

Study design and settings

124

This study used data from the National Income Dynamics Study-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile

125

Survey (NIDS-CRAM) (37). NIDS-CRAM is a nationally-representative survey of the NIDS,

126

which involves a sample of South African adults from 2017 NIDS wave 5 (38). This survey's

127

primary investigator is the Southern Africa Labour and Development Research Unit (SALDRU),

128

which is affiliated with the University of Cape Town (UCT). SALDRU is aided by the South

129

Africa Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (39). The NIDS wave 5 survey

130

employed a stratified, two-stage cluster sample design to interview respondents in all nine South

131

African provinces. Hence this study maintained the NIDS wave 5 study design and settings for

132

NIDS-CRAM (40).

Data collection

135

NIDS-CRAM is a computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) survey, with the first wave

136

conducted during the coronavirus pandemic in South Africa between May and June 2020.

137

Respondents were mainly asked retrospective questions about their circumstances in February

138

and April 2020. The NIDS-CRAM constitutes a sample of 7,074 individuals drawn from the

139

adult sub-sample of the fifth wave of NIDS conducted in 2017. Information such as demographic

140

characteristics, economic characteristics, access to contraception and sources of contraception

141

during the coronavirus pandemic in South Africa were the variables extracted from the NIDS-

142

CRAM wave 1 dataset. The de-identified dataset can be accessed upon request at

143

http:/www.nids.uct.ac.za while the redefined dataset used for this study has been deposited to

144

open science framework (OSF) and can be accessed here https://doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/J4XQR.

145
146

Sampling

147

All the age groups interviewed in the survey were included. After eliminating respondents who

148

failed to answer questions related to access to condoms or source of condoms during the

149

coronavirus pandemic in South Africa, a total of 4,517 respondents were eligible for the study

150

out of 7,074 individuals. The eligible respondents were those within the reproductive age group

151

between the ages of 17 to 45 years.

154

NIDS_CRAM wave 1 dataset was recoded and analyzed using STATA version 16. Descriptive

155

statistics were used to summarize data on demographic characteristics, economic characteristics,

156

access to condoms and preferred sources during the 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic in South

157

Africa. Outcome variables were access to condoms and sources of condoms. Access to condoms

158

was measured by asking the respondents if they have access to condoms during COVID-19

159

lockdown or not, followed by the source they preferred, while the explanatory variables were

160

demographic and economic characteristics of the respondents. Selected demographic

161

characteristics include; age, population group, gender and province of the respondents while

162

Economic characteristics was measure by employment status, educational level and income of

163

the respondents. Income of the respondents were measured using the nation’s wealth quintile

164

categorization (Upper quintile: R52 078 and above, 4th quintile: R23 156 – R52 077, 3rd

165

quintile: R12 781 – R23 155, 2nd quintile: R7 030 – R12 780, and Lower quintile: R7 029 and

167

Source of condoms has three variable which includes; private sources (respondent getting

168

condoms from the private source like private clinic or hospital), public (respondent getting

169

condoms from the public source like public/government clinic or hospital) and other sources

170

which includes pharmacy shops, road sellers etc.). Dataset was weighted by applying the

171

recommended weight command of “svyset cluster [pw=w1_nc_wgt], strata(stratum)”and

172

summarized as percentages (%) for both explanatory and outcome variables (37). Chi-square was

173

done to check the significant association of the selected demographic and economic variables on

174

access to condoms and sources of condoms. Binary logistic regression tests were performed to

175

determine adjusted likelihood of the explanatory variables on only access to condoms in the

176

outcome variables due to its dichotomy nature; those who had access were coded “1” as “yes”

and those who did not have access were coded “0” as “No”. P-value < 0.05 was considered

178

statistically significant at 95% confidence interval (CI), and explanatory variables with an

179

adjusted odds ratio (aOR) greater than 1 were considered to have a higher likelihood on the

Ethics approval and consent to participate

183

This study is a secondary analysis of the NIDS-CRAM wave 1 dataset. Ethical approval for

184

NIDS-CRAM was granted by the University of Cape Town (UCT) Commerce Faculty Ethics

185

Committee. In 2017, the NIDS data collectors (Wave 5) conducted a written informed consent

186

process for all participants and only resumed interviews until this procedure had been completed.

187

NIDS-CRAM 2020 was drawn from the same population sample of wave 5; hence, the

188

participants' consent was re-validated via telephone interview before proceeding with relevant

189

questions.

The majority of the respondents were between the age group 25-34 years (39.55). Almost 8 in 10

204

(84.07%) of the respondents were Africans or Black, while the lowest population group was

205

among Asians/Indians with 1.85%.

206

A little above half of the respondents were female (51.67%), while males involved in the survey

207

were below average (48.33%). Gauteng had the highest respondents, with 27.64%, followed by

208

KwaZulu-Natal 18.08%, while the lowest was among Northern-Cape (2.75%). Almost 8 in 10 of

209

the respondents dwells in a House or flat residence, while 1.07% of the respondents dwell in

210

other forms of dwelling types other than those listed above (Table 1).

211

Economic Characteristics

212

More than two-fifths of the respondents interviewed were employed (47.79%), while 13.12%

213

were not economically active at the time of data collection. More than three-fifths of the

214

respondents were in the lower quintile (60.18%), while those in the third quintile were the least

215

with 4.05% of the respondents' wealth-income category. The majority of the respondents had

216

secondary school education (94.16%), whiles 1.36% had tertiary education.

Almost every 3 in 10 respondents with primary education had no access to condoms, while 9 in

273

10 respondents of the same group preferred public sources of condoms. Both access to condoms

274

and sources of condoms was significantly associated education of respondents as both P-values

275

were less than 0.05.

281

Table 3 showed the binary logistic regression results between independent variables and access

282

to condoms during the coronavirus pandemic in South Africa.

283

Respondents between the age group, 25-34 years, were 6% more likely to have access to

284

condoms with a 95% confidence interval (0.81-1.38). Population group respondents who were

285

Coloured and White were 15% and 46%, respectively, more likely to have access to condoms

286

than the Black or African population.

287

Female respondents were 14% less likely to have access to condoms with a confidence interval

288

of (0.69-1.08) compared to the male respondents. Both respondents who reside in KwaZulu-

289

Natal and Mpumalanga were 70% and 45% likely to have access to condoms, respectively,

290

compared to Western-Cape respondents.

291

The respondents' employment status showed that unemployed respondents were 3% less likely to

292

have access to condoms compared to the reference category (RC), who were not economically

293

active. Those who were within the 4th quintile of wealth-income were 24% less likely to have

294

access to condoms compared to those in the upper quintile who were 14% more likely to have

295

access to condoms.

296

Respondents who had no education were 14% less likely to have access to condoms with a

Discussion

329

This study examined the factors contributing to inadequate access to condoms and sources of

330

condoms during the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in South Africa (SA) using the first

331

national income dynamic study-coronavirus rapid mobile survey (NIDS-CRAM) dataset

332

conducted during 2019-nCoV. I described national-level variation in accessing condoms and

333

sources of condoms during the 2019-nCoV lockdown in the year 2020, and the role which

334

selected demographic and economic characteristics played. This study acquired and contributed

335

to the existing literature on how limited access to condoms can increase the unmet need for

336

contraception, which may lead to poor sexual and reproductive health outcomes. The study

337

further expands the scope of the unmet need for contraception by including limited access to

338

condoms during the 2019-nCoV lockdown and physical distancing in SA.

339

The study is in concordance with the study that concluded that inadequate or limited access to

340

condoms is part of the contributing factors to the unmet need for contraception (9). The result

341

showed that more than two in every ten South Africans experienced limited access to condoms

342

during the pandemic. A study conducted in Indonesia and Kenya on preferred contraception

343

sources showed that most of the population preferred public/government hospitals to obtain their

344

contraception prescriptions (42, 43). This is in line with the study result in that more than two-

345

thirds of South Africans preferred public/government hospitals to get condoms. This could be

346

one of the reasons why the respondents were unable to access condoms as most public or

347

government hospitals were occupied or overwhelmed due to the influx of 2019-nCoV patients

348

(32, 33) and also limited transportation as a result of lockdown/ physical distancing (12, 44).

349

The study further showed evidence that there is variation in respondents' adopted sources of

350

condoms as all selected demographic and economic variables were significantly associated with

351

the source of condoms. This means that South Africans demographic or economic characteristics

352

determine their sources of condoms. This is also in line with a study conducted in Kenya that

353

showed a large variation in respondents' socio-demographic characteristics and contraception

354

sources (43).

355

As the access to contraception continues to be a major contributor to high unmet needs in

356

developing countries (8), this study results showed that South Africans who were between 35-45

357

years, the female respondents, those who reside in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga provinces

358

and finally, those who were unemployed, not educated and those in the 4th quintile of wealth-

359

income experienced were less likely to have access to condoms during the 2020 lockdown/

360

physical distancing due to 2019-nCoV pandemic. This is contrary to the studies conducted in

361

South Africa and Ghana prior to the 2019-nCoV pandemic in terms of socio-demographic

362

characteristics of respondents affected (45, 46).

363

However, this study results showed similarity in most studies, commentaries and editorial

364

opinions that obstruction in sexual and reproductive services in the ongoing 2019-nCoV

365

pandemic could lead to a high unmet need for contraception (15, 17, 32) and to the best of my

366

knowledge this is the first paper that holistically employed NIDS-CRAM dataset to examine how

367

2019-nCoV influence limited access to condoms, preferred sources of condoms and demographic

368

& economic characteristics of South Africans affected.

Strengths and Limitations

371

The use of secondary datasets has its limitations as some questions of interest to further probe the

372

respondents in terms of retrospective questions were not asked during data collection, and this

373

limited the scope of the study. The strength of this study is the use of aboriginal staff during the

374

telephone interview. The use of computer-assisted telephone interviewing during 2019-nCoV is

375

another important strength of the study.

376
377

Conclusion and Recommendations

378

Limited access to condoms is the ignored elephant in the room. This study added to the body of

379

literature that there was limited access to condoms during 2019-nCoV and that the preferred

380

source of condoms was very skewed in South Africa.

381

The study concluded that demographic and economic characteristics of South Africans

382

influenced their adopted sources of condoms and that limited access to condoms was more

383

experienced among the aged population, Black South African population groups, those who

384

reside in Free state, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal provinces and those who were either poor

385

nor rich, i.e., those in the 4th quintile of wealth income and those uneducated. Policies,

386

strategies, and interventions that will consider the contraception demands of South Africans

387

during the ongoing or future pandemic should be targeted at similar demographic and economic

388

characteristics. This will reduce the unmet need for contraception in South Africa and tackle the

389

unequal family planning use coverage.
