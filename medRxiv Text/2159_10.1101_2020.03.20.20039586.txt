Summary
Background The novel coronavirus (CoV) severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS)-CoV-2 outbreak started at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and spread over
100 countries. SARS-CoV-2 uses the membrane protein Angiotensin I converting
enzyme 2(ACE2) as a cell entry receptor. Indeed, it was reported that the balance of
Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS), regulated by both ACE and ACE2, was altered in
COVID-19 patients. It is controversial, however, whether commonly used
anti-hypertensive drugs Angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and
Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) shall be continued in the confirmed
COVID-19 patients. This study was designed to investigate any difference in disease
severity between COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity. The included
COVID-19 patients used ACEI, ARB, calcium channel blockers (CCB), beta blockers
(BB), or thiazide to treat preexisting hypertension prior to the hospital were compared
to patients who did not take any of those drugs.
Methods In this multicentre retrospective study, clinical data of 511 COVID-19
patients were analyzed. Patients were categorized into six sub-groups of hypertension
comorbidity based on treatment using one of anti-hypertension drugs (ACEI, ARB,
CCB, BB, thiazide), or none. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the use of
ACEI and ARB associated with pneumonia using published studies.
Findings Among the elderly (age>65) COVID-19 patients with hypertension
comorbidity, the risk of COVID-19-S (severe disease) was significantly decreased in
patients who took ARB drugs prior to hospitalization compared to patients who took
no drugs (OR=0·343, 95% CI 0·128-0·916, p=0·025). The meta-analysis showed that
ARB use has positive effects associated with morbidity and mortality of pneumonia.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles published up to March 15, 2020 using keywords
“2019-nCoV”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “novel coronavirus”, and COVID-19 AND “ARB”,
and “angiotensin II receptor blocker” for papers published in both English and
Chinese. We found three papers: one from our group, published in Science China Life
Science that demonstrated an elevated Angiotensin II level in blood samples from
COVID-19 patients; another a perspective article in Chinese recommending ACEI
and ARBs as potential remedies for SARS-CoV-2 infections; the third a retrospective
study in Chinese identifying no significant difference between ACEI/ARB associated
with outcomes in 112 COVID-19 patients with CVD comorbidity. The International
society of Hypertension stated on March 16th, 2020: “there are no clinical data in
human to show that ACE-inhibitors or ARBs either improve or worsen susceptibility
to COVID-19 infection nor do they affect the outcomes of those infected”.
Added value of this study
We retrospectively reviewed different types of anti-hypertensive drugs taken by
COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity prior to entering the hospital. We
discovered that ARB hypertensive drugs were associated with a decreased risk of
severe disease in elderly (age>65) COVID-19 patients (OR=0·343, 95% CI
0·128-0·916, p=0·025), the first evidence of ARBs association to COVID-19
infections in human. We conducted a meta-analysis in the literature and found that
ARB has positive effects associated with morbidity and mortality of pneumonia.
Implications of all the available evidence
ARB drugs are widely used in the population with hypertension. Treatments with

ACEI and ARBs should be continuous according to medical guidelines. RCT trials of
ARB associated with morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection are
recommended in the future.

Introduction
At the end of 2019, a cluster of lethal pneumonia cases was first reported in Wuhan,
China. A SARS-CoV-like coronavirus in the respiratory tracts of patients was soon
isolated and the viral genome sequenced; it was later named SARS-CoV-21-4. In
severe cases of COVID-19 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) and often died with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). By March
11th of 2020, the virus infection had spread to over 100 countries and SARS-CoV-2
infection was labeled a global pandemic by the World Health Organization5. Studies
have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 shares the cell entry receptor as SARS-CoV:
angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)1,3,4,6-9, a crucial negative regulator of
renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2
are homologues with distinct important functions in RAS. ACE cleaves angiotensin I
to generate angiotensin II, whereas ACE2 decreases the level of angiotensin II and
negatively regulates RAS system10-12. RAS plays a crucial role in maintaining blood
pressure homeostasis, fluid, and salt balance13,14. Anti-hypertensive drugs ACE
inhibitor (ACEI) and ARB target RAS and have been used clinically for decades15-18
to treat millions of patients worldwide. Controversy about novel use of RAS blockers
has been raised. By March 12th 2020, the European Society of Hypertension (ESH)
stated that “the currently available data on COVID 19 infections did not support a
different use of RAS blockers”. The international society of Hypertension endorsed
the ESH statement on March 16th 2020 and stated “there are no clinical data in human
to show that ACE-inhibitors or ARBs either improve or worsen susceptibility to
COVID-19 infection nor do they affect the outcomes of those infected24”.

Our previous studies on SARS-CoV and acute lung failure elucidated the molecular
pathogenesis signaling through RAS19. SARS-CoV infection and the spike protein of
SARS-CoV reduce ACE2 expression, increase angiotensin II level signaling through
the angiotensin II type1a receptor (AT1a), promote disease pathogenesis, induce lung
edemas and impair respiratory function8,11. We demonstrated that losartan, a
commonly used ARB drug, could attenuate acute lung failure in a mouse model
whose condition had been worsened after injection of SARS-CoV spike protein8. We

reported that RAS was imbalanced in the cases of many diverse predisposing factors
for ARDS including sepsis, acid aspiration, bacteria, SARS-CoV, and avian influenza
(H5N1 and H7N9) infections, as well as nanoparticle aspiration8,10-12,20. These studies
indicated that blocking the RAS pathway and reducing angiotensin II level could
ameliorate mice lung injury8,10,11,15,20.
Previous population-based studies of ACEI and ARB have shown use of the drugs to
be largely associated with improved pneumonia outcomes21. Our previous study
reported that plasma level of Angiotensin II in COVID-19 patients was significantly
elevated7, indicating a altered RAS balance in COVID-19 patients. Here we
conducted a retrospective study on the effects of RAS blockers on disease severity in
COVID-19 patients. We also performed an updated meta-analysis of ACEI and ARB
effects in reducing the risk of pneumonia and on pneumonia-related outcomes.

Methods
Study design and patients
Medical records of three cohorts (adult patients ≥18 years old) were included in this
retrospective study: COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the Shenzhen Third People’s
hospital (Shenzhen, China) from Jan 11 to Feb 5, 2020; patients with COVID-19
admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, China) from Jan 12 to
Feb 9, 2020; and patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Fifth Medical Center of
People's Liberation Army General Hospital (Beijing, China) from Dec 27, 2019 to
Feb 29, 2020. All patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia basing on the
New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program published by the
National Health Commission of China22. Patients with hypertension comorbidity
follow the criteria of National Guidelines for Hypertension Management in China
(2019)23. This study was performed in accordance with guidelines approved by the
Ethics Committees from the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of
Medical Sciences (002-2020). Verbal informed consent was obtained from patients or
patients’ family members if available and the requirement for informed consent was
waived by the Ethics Commission.
Clinical data collection
Demographic, clinical, disease severity, and outcome data were extracted from
medical records. Disease severity was classified as severe or mild according to the
guidelines of 2019-nCoV infection from the National Health Commission of the

People’s Republic of China. All data were independently checked by more than one
physician.
Meta-analysis
We searched the NCBI and Medline databases for potentially eligible records. Articles
related to ACEI or ARB drug effects on pneumonia were considered in our
meta-analysis. The search terms were as follows:
#1: pneumonia
#2: (angiotensin II Receptor Blocker) OR ARB
#3: irbesartan OR losartan OR valsartan OR telmisartan OR Candesartan OR
Irbesartan
#4: (ace inhibitor) OR (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor)
#5: captopril OR enalapril OR perindopril OR fosinopril OR lisinopril OR quinapril
OR ramipril OR cilazapril OR benazepril
#6: #2 OR #3 OR #4 OR #5
#7: #1 AND #6
Non-human studies, non-English articles, articles not related to ARB or ACEI drugs
effect on pneumonia, and case reports were excluded. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale
(NOS)24 was used for assessing the quality of studies included in meta-analysis by
three researchers independently.
We collected the data from each article including journal name, publication year, first
author’s name, population included in the article research, duration of follow-up,
whether the study was prospective or retrospective, total sample size, treatment drug
(ARB/ACEI and control), and risk results (OR) in the article.
The primary endpoint of articles included was defined as the incidence rate of
pneumonia, and the secondary endpoint was the mortality of pneumonia patients. The
diagnosis of pneumonia was based on clinical symptoms, chest radiograph results,
and the criteria of International Classification of Diseases (ICD)25 provided in
included articles.
Statistical analysis

Mann Whitney U tests were used to compare differences in continuous variables
between severe and mild COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Chi-squared tests were used
to compare differences in categorical variables between severe and mild COVID-19
pneumonia patients. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were
calculated for risk evaluation. Adjusted OR were calculated using “Enter” stepwise
multivariable logistic regression32. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS
16·0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc.). Chi-square tests were used to examine heterogeneity
between trials; inverse variance (IV) method of fix or random effect model in
meta-analysis were used based on the results of heterogeneity analysis. The software
Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5) was used for meta-analysis. Two tailed P value<0·05
was considered to be statistically significant.

Results
To evaluate the effects of RAS blockers on disease severity of COVID-19 patients, we
conducted a retrospective study by obtaining hypertension comorbidity patient
information from three cohorts and recording the types of anti-hypertensive drugs
they took prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 78 COVID-19 patients with
hypertension comorbidity were qualified for the study (Figure 1). Among the 78
patients, 40 were classified as having mild disease (COVID-19-M), and 38 were
classified as severe condition (COVID-19-S) according to New Coronavirus
Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program published by the National Health
Commission of China22. Age and sex were found to be statistically significant
differences between COVID-19-M and COVID-19-S patients (Table S1)7,26. Our
previous report showed that the AUC of ROC for age as a predictor of disease
severity is 17. There is no statistical difference in disease severity between any of the
5 different types of anti-hypertensive drugs (CCB, ARB, ACEI, Thiazide or BB)
compared to no drugs taken by all COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity
in the study (Table S1). We further analyzed the data from 46 elderly COVID-19
patients over the age of 65 and found that patients who took ARB drugs prior to

entering the hospital had a reduced risk of disease severity upon SARS-CoV-2
infection (OR=0·343, 95% CI 0·128-0·916, p=0·025) (Table 1). The effect of ARB
remains positive in protecting from severe respiratory failure upon SARS-CoV-2
infection after the data are adjusted by multivariable logistic regression modeling with
a sex variable (OR=0·25, 95% CI: 0·064-0·976, p=0·046) (Table 1).
Furthermore, we performed meta-analysis of ACEI and ARB drugs associated with
morbidity and mortality of pneumonia. By searching the Pub-Med database, we found
210 potentially eligible published papers and included 31 studies (Figure S1, Table
S2). There are few detailed studies in the literature concerning ARB drugs associated
with pneumonia studies, however ARBs were found to be associated with the reduced
risk of pneumonia morbidity in a total of 70346 patients in three studies (OR=0·55, 95%
CI; 0·43-0·70, p<0·01) (Figure 2A). By analysis of OR values from three studies
available in the literature, ARBs were found to be associated with a decreased
mortality rate for pneumonia (OR=0·55, 95% CI; 0·44-0·69, p<0·01), but not
morbidity (Figure 2B-C). Previous meta-analysis studies have reported that ACEI
drugs reduced morbidity and mortality of pneumonia patients27. Our updated
meta-analysis of ACEI confirmed these results (Figure S2, S3). Taken together, our
results indicate that ARB anti-hypertensive drugs associated with reduced disease
severity of elderly COVID-19 patients and may have positive effects on morbidity
and mortality of all-cause pneumonia.

Discussion
In this retrospective study, we report that ARB anti-hypertensive drugs significantly
reduced the risk of severe pneumonia in elderly COVID-19 patients with hypertension
comorbidity. There is no statistical difference in disease severity between patients
who took CCB anti-hypertensive drugs compared to those who took no
anti-hypertensive drugs (Table 1). Due to the limited number of COVID-19 patients
who had taken ACEI, BB, and Thiazide prior to hospitalization, the association of
these anti-hypertensive drugs with disease severity of COVID-19 patients with
hypertension comorbidity had no statistical significance compared to patients who
had taken no drugs. Further studies including more cohorts of COVID-19 patients are
necessary in the future.
A previous retrospective study reported that ACEI and ARBs had no statistical
significance in the outcomes of 112 COVID-19 patients with combined
cardiovascular diseases (CVD) 28. The average age of the cohort in that study was

relatively young at 62 years (range 55-67), and the disease severity of most cases was
mild (96 of 112 cases)28.
Although the number of studies of ARB associated with pneumonia is limited in the
literature, and none of the studies is a randomized controlled trial, our meta-analysis
shows the positive effects of ARB associated with morbidity and mortality of
pneumonia. Interestingly, none of the studies in the meta-analysis showed negative
effects of ARB associated with morbidity and mortality of all-cause pneumonia.
The molecular mechanism of ARDS and severe pneumonia involved in RAS is
complicated. Although the predisposing factors that induce ARDS are diverse
(SARS-CoV, sepsis, acid aspiration, bacteria, and avian influenza (H5N1 and H7N9)
infections, as well as nanoparticle aspiration), the imbalance of RAS seems to be a
common mechanism8,10-12,20. Our previous studies have elucidated that ACE,
angiotensin II, and the angiotensin II type 1a are problematic components in RAS that
lead to disease pathogenesis, while ACE2 and the angiotensin II type 2a are beneficial
components of RAS that protect mice from severe acute lung injury8,11. The level of
angiotensin II in patient blood samples was usually elevated compared to healthy
individuals7,10,12, and our previous study demonstrated that the plasma level of
angiotensin II collected from COVID-19 patients was significantly increased7. Thus,
the level of angiotensin II may indicate the RAS imbalance in patients. Regulators
that balance RAS may be potential treatments of ARDS, and as such, ARB
anti-hypertensive drugs might be an effective and economic remedy for COVID-19
patients already available in the market.
Moreover, it has not escaped our notice that ARBs may also have beneficial effects in
the treatment of renal cancers, as well as heart failure 29,30. A study of the molecular
mechanism underlying these treatment effects is necessary in the future. Taken
together, our results not only support the continuous, wide use of ARBs in
hypertension patients, but also suggest that an ARB trial for COVID-19-S patients in
ICU with normal blood potassium level, normal renal function, normal blood pressure,
or hypertension comorbidity is warranted.

Figure 1. Study design and included patients.
A total of three cohorts (adult patients ≥ 18 years old) were included in this
retrospective study. Cohort A recorded 333 COVID-19 pneumonia patients admitted
to the Shenzhen Third People’s hospital (Shenzhen, China) from Jan 11 to Feb 5,
2020; Cohort B recorded 111 COVID-19 pneumonia patients admitted to the Renmin
Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, China) from Jan 12 to Feb 9, 2020; Cohort C
recorded 67 COVID-19 pneumonia patients admitted to the Fifth Medical Center of
People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital (Beijing, China) from Dec 27,
2019 to Feb 29, 2020. In total, 78 COVID-19 patients woith hypertension comorbidity
(having a with antihypertension medication record) were included in this study.

Figure S1. Literature search process for meta-analysis.
NCBI and Medline databases were searched for potentially eligible records. Articles
related to ACEI or ARB drugs effect on pneumonia were considered as potentially
eligible studies. Non-human studies, non-English articles, articles not related to ARB
or ACEI drugs effect on pneumonia, mixed data of ARB and ACEI drugs effect on
pneumonia, and case reports were excluded. ACEI, angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor. ARB, angiotensin II receptor blocker.
Figure S2. Meta-analyses of the pneumonia risk of patients taking ACEIs.
(A) Meta-analysis of the risk of morbidity of pneumonia in patients taking
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) compared with no medication or
other antihypertension treatment as control. A total of 180493 patients in 16 studies
with detailed case/control numbers were included. (B) Meta-analysis of the risk of
mortality of pneumonia in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
(ACEIs) compared with no medication or other antihypertension treatment as control.
A total of 4084 patients in the three studies with detailed case/control numbers were
included. CI confidence interval; IV, inverse variance; SE, standard error.
