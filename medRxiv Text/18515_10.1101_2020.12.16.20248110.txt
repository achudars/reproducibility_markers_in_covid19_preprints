ABSTRACT

39

Background: The coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to

40

impose a significant impact on medical education. We aimed to describe the

41

clinical learning experience of undergraduate medical students undertaking

42

internal medicine clerkship during the COVID-19 pandemic at Makerere

43

University, Uganda.

44

Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional study among medical students in

45

clinical years of study pursuing the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of

46

Surgery undergraduate degree program was conducted in November 2020.

47

Only 3rd (junior clerks) and 5th (senior clerks) year medical students whose

48

internal medicine clerkships were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic

49

were studied.

50

Results: Data of 188 (95%) eligible clinical year students; junior (101,

51

54.0%) and senior (86, 46.0%) were analysed. Median age was 24 (range: 22-

52

42) years. Majority (70.1%) were male and Ugandan nationals (94.1%).

equipment, 152 (81.7%) felt at risk of contracting COVID-19, and 127

55

(67.9%) said it was difficult to observe COVID-19 standard operating

56

procedures. Twenty-two students (11.9%) were discouraged from pursuing a

57

career in internal medicine. Overall, most students reported good or

58

excellent clinical experience pre-COVID-19 era compared to during the

59

COVID-19 era (4.0 vs. 3.5, p<0.0001). Senior clerks significantly believed

60

that the time allocated for the rotation was adequate (p<0.0001) and they

61

were able to complete their study objectives (p<0.001), compared to the

62

junior clerks. Senior clerks believed that learning was difficult when

63

combined with junior clerks (p=0.013). About half of the students (51.4%,

64

n=95) reported clinical teaching should remain as it was in the pre-COVID-

65

19 era.

66

Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significantly negative

67

effect on the clinical learning experience of the students. There is need to

68

review the current teaching and learning methods to suit teaching and

69

learning during pandemics of highly infectious diseases to ensure safe and

70

effective learning experience.

INTRODUCTION

74

The on-going coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by

75

the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)

76

continues to be a global crisis with devastating effects across all sectors,

77

including healthcare and medical education [1,2]. Within a year, the highly

78

infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus has rapidly spread in all continents of the

79

world infecting over 74 million persons resulting in approximately 1.6

80

million deaths worldwide [3]. Preventive approaches such as physical

81

distancing, wearing of face masks, and observing respiratory and hand

82

hygiene remains the mainstay of averting the spread of the virus [4–6].

83

Healthcare systems across the world have been over-stretched by the

84

increasing number of patients with COVID-19 [7]. In fact, in some countries

85

hit-hard by the pandemic, medical students in their final clinical year of

86

medical training were fast-tracked to graduate to boost the existing

87

healthcare workforce [8]. Medical students are experiencing this unique

88

training environment for the first time during their clinical training. The

89

impact of this situation on their acquisition of clinical knowledge and skills

90

and how this may affect their future career choices remains elusive.

91

In Uganda, as lockdown was being eased, following standard operating

92

procedures (SOPs) outlined by the Ministry of Health, medical students in

93

their clinical years of training at Makerere University were allowed back on

94

the hospital wards to continue with their clinical learning in early October

95

2020 [9].

96

As the number of COVID-19 cases in Uganda continues to exponentially

97

increase in excess of 28,168 cases with over 225 deaths including frontline

98

healthcare workers [3], the fear of contracting the disease from patients may

99

have a significant effect on the learning experience of medical students. The

100

teachers were concerned that students' acquisition of clinical skills

101

competence may be compromised as patient access is limited and some of

102

the routine clinical examination procedures could be affected by the

103

standard operating procedures for preventing COVID-19 transmission.

104

The clinical learning experience of the medical students during the

105

pandemic in Uganda is poorly understood and not documented. We

106

therefore aimed to describe the clinical learning experience of medical

107

students who undertook internal medicine clerkship during the pandemic at

108

Makerere University, Uganda.

12 undergraduate degree programs with a population of approximately

119

2,000 students as of Academic Year 2019/2020. The duration of study

120

ranges from 3 years to 5 years depending on the courses offered. Students

121

on the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBChB) degree

122

program take a minimum of 5 years to complete their training. There are

123

about 200 5th year (senior clerks) and 180 3rd year (junior clerks) students in

124

the academic year 2019/2020 undertaking the MBChB program. The

125

students for junior and senior clerkship rotations are divided into 4 groups,

126

with each semester having 2 groups rotating in internal medicine each for a

127

period of 7.5 weeks.

128

Study population

129

All 3rd and 5th Year MBChB students who undertook the internal medicine

130

rotation during the October –November 2020 clinical clerkship period were

131

included in the study after informed consent was obtained.

132

Data collection

133

We employed purposive sampling. For the quantitative study, paper-printed

134

semi-structured questionnaires were self-administered. Data was collected

135

immediately after candidates wrote their final internal medicine theory

136

exams. In all settings during data collection, COVID-19 standard operating

137

procedures (SOPs) as outlined by Ministry of Health, Uganda [9] were

138

observed.

Study variables

142

Independent variables were demographic characteristics including sex, age,

143

year of study, and nationality. Dependent variables were teaching and

144

learning experience and challenges to clinical clerkship during COVID-19

145

pandemic. A 5-point Likert scale (very poor [1], poor, fair, good and excellent

146

[5] OR strongly agree [5], agree, neutral, disagree and strongly disagree [1])

147

was used to evaluate overall learning experience of the learners during the

148

study period. The study questionnaire was adapted from a previously

149

validated and published tool [10].

150

Statistical analyses

151

Data from completed questionnaires were entered into Microsoft Excel 2016

152

for cleaning and coding and later exported to STATA version 16.0 for

153

analyses. Numerical data were summarized as means and standard

154

deviations if normally distributed and medians and ranges if non-normally

155

distributed.

156

percentages. Associations between independent variables and dependent

157

variables were assessed using parametric or non-parametric tests and

158

multivariable analysis as appropriate. Internal reliability of each of the

159

questions was assessed using Cronbach alpha reliability test. A P<.05 was

160

considered statistically significant.

RESULTS

164

Characteristics of participants

165

All 201 eligible medical students completed the survey (response rate=

166

100%). However, 13 participants had incomplete questionnaires and were

167

therefore excluded from the final analysis.

168

Overall, data of 188 medical students with a median age of 24 (interquartile

169

range: 21 to 40) years were analysed (Table 1). Majority of the participants

170

were Ugandans (94.2%, n=177), male (70.7%, n=133) and residing in

171

university halls (50%, n=94). About 72% (n=161) of the participants got food

172

from nearby restaurants and the median daily expenditure on food was

173

5,000 Uganda Shillings (~1.4 US dollars (USD)). Only 110 (58.5%) medical

174

students used the bus provided by the university whereas the others spent a

175

median amount of 10,000 UGX (~2.3 USD) daily on transport to the

176

hospital.

Learning experience during the COVID-19 pandemic.

187

Table 2 summarizes the experiences of medical students during internal

188

medicine rotation amidst the pandemic. The mean experience scores for

189

most items assessed were ≥4 indicating good experiences for the respective

190

items assessed (Table 3).

191

Of concern, experiences on opportunities for outpatient contacts (mean:

192

2.8±1.2), emergency care contacts (mean: 3.0±1.0) and teaching from nurses

193

(mean: 2.9±1.1) were generally poor. On bivariate analysis (Table 3), senior

194

clerks had better experiences in most of the items assessed. Experiences

195

were significantly better among senior clerks than junior clerks for

196

performing physical examinations (P= 0.019), ward procedures (P= 0.006),

197

opportunities for self-study (P= 0.001), opportunities for peer discussions

198

(P= 0.008), emergency care contacts (P= 0.013), and teaching from nurses

Attitudes

towards

internal

medicine

rotation

during

COVID-19

pandemic.
The majority of participants reported feeling safe with and having
opportunity to learn from their senior or junior counterparts (Table 4).
Overall, 81.7% (n=152) of the medical students felt at risk of contracting
COVID-19 during the rotation and more than two-thirds (67.9%, n=127)
agreed that it was difficult to follow the standard operating procedures for
control of COVID-19 while clerking patients. In addition, about one-third
(34.2%) felt that they did not have adequate personal protective equipment
during the rotation. However, 124 participants (67.8%) agreed that they had
a sufficient number of patients for them to learn from during the rotation.
Notably, 86 participants (46%) agreed that assessments by tutors were
difficult when senior and junior clerks were combined together. About one
fifth of the medical students (11.9%, n=22) felt discouraged from pursuing a
career in Internal Medicine during the rotation.
Table 5 summarizes the mean attitude scores for each of the items assessed.
Overall, attitudes were moderately positive for most of the items. On
bivariate analysis (Table 5), senior clerks significantly believed that the time
allocated for the rotation was adequate (P<.0001) and they were able to
complete

their

study

objectives

(P<.001),

compared to

their

junior

counterparts. Senior clerks also significantly believed that learning is
difficult when combined with junior clerks (mean attitude score: 3.0 vs 2.5,
P=0.013).

DISCUSSION

26

Besides interrupting with clinical clerkships, the COVID-19 pandemic has

27

brought a myriad of challenges in clinical bedside teaching since medical

28

students now have limited direct patient care activities, such as physical

29

examinations and procedures [11,12]. In this study, we found that nearly

30

half of the medical students felt at risk of contracting SARS-COV-2, had

31

difficulties in observing COVID-19 preventive SOPS, and had inadequate

32

exposures to outpatient and emergency departments. This was consistent

33

with anecdotal observations by the clinical supervisors during the course of

34

the clinical rotation.

35

Previous studies have evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on

36

surgical training [13] and fellowships [14], radiology residency [15],

37

gastroenterology residency [16] and assessment of medical students [17].

38

Between 40 and 100% of surgical residents reported severe impact of the

39

COVID-19 pandemic on their training [13]. However, there is no published

40

study examining experience of medical students or residence in general

41

internal medicine. For the senior clerks, majority reported a good or

42

excellent clinical experience pre-COVID-19 pandemic compared to clerkship

43

during the pandemic.

44

To minimise risks of contracting SARS-CoV-2 by the learners and their

45

teachers, many schools and universities have opted for blended online and

46

ward teachings. Due to the negative impact of COVID-19 pandemic on

47

medical education, there has been a shift towards e-learning at all levels of

21 | P a g e

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.16.20248110; this version posted December 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this

48

education, which may represent an optimal solution to maintain learning

49

during this unprecedented time [18]. However, e-learning may not facilitate

50

acquisition of clinical skills and competencies. In resource limited settings

51

were online learning platforms are not well established it is essential that

52

the experience of medical students is described to guide future trainings in

53

the same setting. Despite the challenges, over half of the participants

54

reported clinical teaching should remain as it was in the pre COVID-19 era,

55

that is, uninterrupted clinical rotations along with class lectures. It was also

56

interesting to note that less than 4% of the medical students opted for

57

online only or use of simulations and mannequins as alternatives to

58

traditional clinical teaching. This is consistent with a previous study that

59

showed that e-learning in the clinical years is associated with low students’

60

satisfaction and technical challenges [18]. In Uganda, we have recently

61

reported that medical student think e-learning is inefficient and associated

62

with poor acquisition of knowledge [19]. Moreover, cost of data and internet

63

stability remains a big barrier to e-learning among medical students in

64

Uganda [19]. The use of simulations and mannequins have not been

65

frequently implemented at Makerere University hence the low number of

66

students who opted for it.

67

Notably, the costs incurred by the students during the rotation in the

68

COVID-19 pandemic era could have had an impact on the learning

69

experience. The government reduced the number of travellers that each

70

public transport means was supposed to carry to enforce social distancing

71

as a guideline for prevention of COVID-19 transmission. Costs of using

72

public transport therefore increased to more than twice the previous costs.

73

The means of transport provided by the university was also inadequate to

74

cater for all the students.

75

The impact of interruption of clinical clerkship in internal medicine due to

76

the COVID-19 pandemic and whether the experience of clinical clerkship

77

during the pandemic has affected performance in theory and clinical exams

78

of our students is not known. However, in Columbia [17], students who sat

79

their exams during the pandemic had higher scores compared with historic

80

cohort. However, these high scores were attributed to the open book nature

81

of the exams and that students had more time to prepare for them.

82

Study limitations

83

Our study had some

84

standardized and validated tool to assess clinical learning experience during

85

this COVID-19. However, we adapted an existing validated and published

86

tool used in a similar setting but in a non-pandemic situation. Secondly,

87

there’s paucity of published literature in this area and therefore not

88

sufficient published studies to compare and contrast our findings with.

89

However, to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to explore

90

clinical learning experience of medical students in their clinical years during

91

this pandemic in Uganda and Africa at large. Despite the above limitations,

92

our findings provide valuable information about teaching and learning

93

clinical medicine during the pandemic in resource-limited settings.

In this study, we have reported a considerable negative effect of the COVID-

Clinical teaching of junior clerks should be separate from senior clerks to
