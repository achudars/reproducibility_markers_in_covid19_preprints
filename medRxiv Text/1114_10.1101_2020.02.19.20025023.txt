Summary
Objective To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the Coronavirus
Disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalized patients and to offer suggestions to the urgent needs
of COVID-19 prevention, diagnosis and treatment.

Methods We included 102 confirmed COVID-19 cases hospitalized in Xiangyang No.1
people’s hospital, Hubei, China until Feb 9th, 2020. Demographic data, laboratory findings
and chest computed tomographic (CT) images were obtained and analyzed.

Findings All cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, including 52 males and 50 females
with a mean age of 50.38 years (SD 16.86). Incubation time ranged from one to twenty days
with a mean period of 8.09 days (SD 4.99). Fever (86[84.3%] of 102 patients), cough
(58[57%]), fatigue (28[27%]), shortness of breath (24[23%]), diarrhea (15[15%]),
expectoration (13[12%]), inappetence (11[10%]) were common clinical manifestations. We
observed a decreased blood leukocyte count and lymphopenia in 21 (20.6%) and 56 (54.9%)
patients, respectively. There were 66 (68%) of 97 patients with elevated C-reactive protein
levels and 49 (57.6%) of 85 with increased erythrocytes sedimentation rate. Higher levels of
procalcitonin and ferritin were observed in 19 (25.3%) of 75 and 12 (92.3%) of 13 patients,
respectively. Eight patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), six developed
respiratory failure, three had multiple organ failure and three died. The cumulative positivity
rate over three rounds of real-time RT-PCR was 96%. One-hundred patients were found with
typical radiological abnormalities in two rounds of chest CT scans, indicating a 98%
consistency with real-time RT-PCR results.

Interpretation Most COVID-19 patients in Xiangyang were secondary cases without sex
difference, and the rate of severe case and death was low. Middle-to-old-age individuals were
more susceptible to the virus infection and the subsequent development of severe/fatal
consequences. The average incubation period was longer among our patients. We recommend
prolonging the quarantine period to three weeks. Three times real-time RT-PCR plus two
times CT scans is a practical clinical diagnosis strategy at present and should be used to
increase the accuracy of diagnosis, thereby controlling the source of infection more
effectively.

Introduction
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia epidemic outbroke in Wuhan,
Hubei province, China. It has spread to all over China and many other countries within a
short period of time[1, 2]. The virus was later whole-genome sequenced and identified as a new
coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The
syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was called as COVID-19, short for “coronavirus
disease 2019” by World Health Organization[3].

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are the viruses with an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded
ribonucleic acid (RNA) genome[4]. The name comes from the typical appearance of the
virions under the electron microscopy that they all have glycoprotein spike on the surface
which resembles the shape of crown. CoVs exist extensively in the nature, could infect birds
and mammals, including human[5, 6]. CoVs are known to spread through close contact,
especially through respiratory droplets during cough and sneeze. Most infections only cause
mild respiratory symptoms like common cold. Severe cases could develop acute respiratory
distress syndrome, multiple organs failure, and even fatalities [7]. CoVs could be divided into
α, β, γ and δ genera. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β-coronavirus together with the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that outbroke in 2003 and the Middle
East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that outbroke in 2012[8].

Until February 11, 2020, a total number of 38 800 COVID-19 cases have been diagnosed in
China, among which 8 204 were severe cases and 1 113 deaths have been reported. COVID19 has become a great threat to human health and cause great burden to the whole society.
Further exploration of SRAS-CoV-2 would benefit COVID-19 prevention, diagnosis and
treatment. Although Huang et al[9] and Chen et al[10] uncovered some basic epidemiological

and clinical features of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan city, data for the patients from other
regions in Hubei Province were still scarce. Xiangyang is the second biggest city in Hubei
with a large number of labor-force migrant to Wuhan. At the moment, Xiangyang had many
diagnosed cases already. In order to understand the features of COVID-19 in Xiangyang, we
conducted a cross-sectional study to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics
of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Xiangyang No.1 people’s hospital.

Methods
Study design and participants
We recruited patients with positive real-time RT-PCR results who were admitted to
Xiangyang No.1 People’s Hospital before February 9th, 2020. Data were collected until
February 10th, 2020. Diagnosis was made by three physicians based on Diagnosis Guidance
for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia the 5th Edition published by National Health Commission
of the People’s Republic of China and National Administration of Traditional Chinese
Medicine[11]. The current study was approved by the ethics review board at Xiangyang No.1
People’s Hospital (No. 2020GCP012).
Data collection
Data were extracted by two groups (three physicians per group) from the hospital information
system using a consistent data collection protocol and cross-checked. We collected following
information: demographic information, exposure history, medical history, principal clinical
symptoms and their onset time, real-time RT-PCR results, laboratory findings, radiological
findings, comorbidities and disease progression. Laboratory examination included blood
routine and blood biochemistry such as

alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate

aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase isoenzymes-MB (CK-MB),
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (α-HBDH), C-reactive
protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and serum ferritin.
Positive real-time RT-PCR was defined as having at least one time of positive result at our
hospital or other hospitals. Diagnostic results of chest computed tomographic (CT) scans was
given by two radiologists independently, and then were cross-checked. For the patients with
inconsistent diagnosis results or were suspected, final diagnosis was made after the

deliberation of two radiologists. Only first laboratory findings and CT scan results after
hospitalization were used in the present study.
Statistical analysis
Categorical data were described using frequency and percentage. Normalibility of continuous
data was tested. We used mean (standard deviation, SD) to describe variables with normal
distribution, otherwise median were used. All the analyses were performed in Stata 14.

Results
Epidemiological characteristics
A total of 102 cases (52 males and 50 females) with positive real-time RT-PCR results were
included in our study. The mean age was 50.38 (16.86) years old, ranging from 1.5 to 90. The
majority of cases fell into the age group of 50-70 years old. Among 71 cases with confirmed
contact history, seven were Wuhan residents, 37 had travel history to Wuhan, four contacted
with diagnosed patients, and 23 were family-clustered cases. In the analysis of 44 cases with
clear contact time, incubation periods ranged from one to twenty days with a mean of 8.09
(4.99) days (Table 1).
Thirty-nine cases (38.2%) had comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary
artery disease, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and chronic bronchitis. Eight cases (7.9%) were
admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). Among those, six cases acquired respiratory failure,
three developed organ failure and three died. The fatality rate was 3%. After two weeks of
treatment, symptoms of seven (7%) patients subsided and CT image showed clear absorption
of ground-glass opacity in lungs, negativities detected in two rounds of virus RNA detections.
However, they are still being quarantined in case of false negativity.
Real -time RT-PCR
All suspected cases were performed with real-time RT-PCR. The next test was performed in
other day in cases with negative result. There are 67 (66%) cases with positive results in the
first round of test, 21 were found in the second-round with cumulative positivity rate of 86%,
10 were found in the third-round with cumulative positivity rate of 96%, and 2 cases were in
the fourth and fifth round, respectively.
Chest CT scan

In 102 cases confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, 90 cases had typical radiological abnormalities
in first chest CT scan, which indicated an 88% consistency with molecular test. In the 11
cases who took re-examination after 5-7days, 10 cases showed radiological abnormalities.
Taking together, CT scan had a 98% diagnostic rate consistent with real-time RT-PCR.
The mild radiographic abnormalities demonstrated as sparse subpleural nodular or patchy
ground-glass opacities that principally distributed in lung segments and under pleura, with
clear borderline and vascular shadows showing around (Figure 1 A). Moderate abnormalities
were characterized with increased number of ground-glass opacities and their expansion to
multiple lobes. Nodular ground-glass opacities occurred with consolidation, with ambiguous
borderline and blood vessels going through (Figure 1 B-C). In severe abnormalities, diffuse
patchy or grid ground-glass opacities with heterogeneous density presented, partially with
clear borderline, in which air bronchogram and vascular shadow can be seen. Both lungs
showed white lung change, with thickening of interlobular septum and multiple
consolidations in mediastinal window (Figure 1 D).
Principal clinical symptoms
Of 102 patients with COVID-19, 86 (84.3%) cases experienced fever, ranging from 37.2 ℃
to 38.5 ℃, with only two cases had extreme body temperature over 39 ℃. Fifty-eight (56.9%)
cases had cough, mainly dry cough. Ten (9.8%) had white sputum and two (2%) had purulent
sputum. Chest X-ray, clinical signs and laboratory examinations indicated that purulent
sputum was caused by co-infection with bacteria in lung. Twenty-eight (27.5%) cases showed
fatigue and myalgia. Twenty-four (23.5%) cases had respiratory problem, mainly shown as
chest tightness, asthma and shortness of breath. Nine (8.8%) cases developed respiratory
failure. Fifteen (14.3%) cases showed diarrhea and seven (7%) cases had decreased appetite

(Table 1). Two (2%) cases had diarrhea as first appeared symptom, while the other had fever
and/or respiratory symptoms as the first manifestation.
Laboratory findings
Some cases had increased ALT, AST, CK, CK-MB, LDH, α-HBDH. Nineteen (25.3%) cases
had increased PCT of 75 patients tested; Thirteen cases underwent ferritin test of which 12
(92.3%) increased (Table 2). Of all 102 patients, leukocyte count decreased in 21 (21.6%)
cases and lymphocyte count decreased in 56 (54.9%) cases; CRP increased in 66 (68%) cases
of 97 patients; ESR became higher in 49 (57.6%) cases among 85 patients (Table 3).
Other pathogens screening
All cases underwent common etiological examination, including MR-IgM, CP-IgM, TBAbIgG, ADV-IgM, RSV-RNA, H7, Flu A and Flu B. Results were negative in most patients.
Only two cases were detected to be weak positive and positive in MR-IgM, respectively.
Three cases showed weakly positive and one showed positive in CP-IgM. Additionally, three
cases without tuberculosis history were tested to be positive in TBAb-IgG.

Discussion
SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infective virus. Although strict control measures were taken in
Wuhan, Hubei, there were still a large number of new cases every day. Further understanding
of the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 is of great importance for the early
detection of patients and reduction of severe cases and deaths[12].
The present study was based on 102 diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in Xiangyang
No.1 People’s Hospital, Hubei. There was no significant sex difference among our cases with
a men-to-women ratio of 1.04 (52:50), which is not in line with previous studies. Huang et
al[9] and Chen et al[10] found a higher percentage of men with a men-to-women ratio of 2.71
(30:11) and 2.09 (67:32) in a total of 41 and 99 inpatients, respectively. Discrepancy may be
attributed by the differences of the occupational feature between the first- and secondgeneration transmission cases. In Huang et al

[9]

study, 27 out of 41 patients were directly

exposed to the seafood market in Wuhan where was suspected to be the source of infection.
However, in Xiangyang area, the patients were mostly secondary cases. In the process of
transmission, the sex difference was gradually diluted, indicating that there might be no
gender difference in being infected.
Seven cases were imported from Wuhan and 37 had travel history to Wuhan, together
accounting for 43% of 102 cases. The rest were secondary transmission cases, among which
23 were family clustering and 31 patients without clear contact history. Compared with
previous studies[9, 10], the main routes of transmission in our cases were different. The family
is the fundamental unit of society in China. It is unlikely to avoid close contact without clear
diagnosis of the disease, or even if the diagnosis is clear but the patient is not isolated. Based
on the family-clustering feature of SARS-CoV-2 infected population in Xiangyang, it is of

great significance to confirm suspected cases and quarantine them from their family as early
as possible, especially in areas dominated by secondary transmission cases [13, 14].

In our analysis of 44 patients with clear contact history, we found that the mean incubation
period of COVID-19 was 8.08 (5.06) days and ranged from 1 to 20 days. Compared with
previous studies[9,

10]

, the incubation period of our patients varied more greatly with

maximum of 20 days. The prolonged incubation period will increase the risk of virus
transmission. According to Diagnosis Guidance for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia the 5th
Edition[11], individuals with close contact history need to be quarantined for 14 days. The
present study suggested that those potential patients were still likely to transmit the virus even
after a 14-day quarantine. Real-time RT-RNA testing and medical observation before release
should be strengthened and the quarantine time should be extended if necessary.

Only two cases were under 18 years old (one case with 15 and 1.5 years old), which indicated
that people with good health status and immunity were not susceptible. The majority of our
patients were 50 to 70 years old with common chronic diseases, such as hypertension,
diabetes, tuberculosis, hepatitis B, chronic bronchitis, etc. Those people have low immunity,
organic damage, and decreased body regulation, which may explain the high incidence of
SARS-CoV-2 infection in this age group[15]. In addition, disease severity and fatality were
higher among the elderly compared with the rest cases. The three deaths in this study were 72,
73 and 78 years old. Among three deaths, one was infected with SARS-CoV-2 after recent
lung cancer surgery, one had diabetes, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and hyperthyroidism, and
one had hypertension and coronary heart disease[16, 17]. In the absence of cure, it is essential to
protect the elderly population, and therefore, to reduce the incidence. Meanwhile, early

intervention and control of basic diseases may be a way to reduce the critical ill rate and
mortality of the aged-infected population.

SARS-CoV-2 mainly causes lower respiratory tract infections[18]. Among 102 patients, the
major clinical characteristics were fever (84.3%), cough (56.9%), fatigue (27.5%), etc. Most
cases had mild fever (body temperature 37.3 ℃ -38.5 ℃) and irritant dry cough. A few
patients (12.7%) have a small amount of white frothy sputum and runny nose (2%). In our
patients, two cases had diarrhea as the main symptom and 13 cases had diarrhea during the
course of the disease. The total incidence of diarrhea and loss of appetite was 15% and 10%,
respectively, which differed from previous studies[9, 10]. The disagreement may be caused by
the nature of the systemic infection of the virus, the insufficient understanding of the disease.
A recent study reported that ACE-2-expressingcolonocytes are vulnerable for SARS-CoV-2
infections[19].

The positive rate of the first throat swabs real-time RT-RNA test in patients was 66%; the
cumulative positivity rate in two rounds was 86%, and the cumulative positivity rate in three
rounds was 96%. Therefore, the sensitivity of virus RNA test as the main diagnostic method
is not high, could be due to the low viral load in upper respiratory tract[20, 21]. In the absence
of more sensitive diagnostic methods, we recommend ≥3 repeated molecular tests to increase
the diagnostic rate, in order to effectively control transmission.

Accumulative positivity rate of twice chest CT was 98% consistent with real-time RT-PCR,
which means the vast majority of patients with positive real-time RT-PCR results will
eventually have typical radiological features. In addition, it was not difficult to discern
COVID-19 because of its specific radiological abnormalities on chest CT image[22,

14

23]

.

Therefore, CT should be used as the basic diagnostic method for COVID-19. A CT reexamination of patients without any clear clinical features at intervals of about 5 days would
give a clear radiological sign and thus improved the positive rate of diagnosis.

The included individuals in this study were all patients with positive real-time RT-PCR
results. All of them had different clinical manifestations and 98% had typical radiological
findings indicating that real-time RT-PCR detection may be a diagnostic method with a low
misdiagnosis rate. However, the positive rate of the first real-time RT-PCR test was only 66%.
Thus, the rate of missed diagnosis is relatively high if only use single real-time RT-PCR
test[24]. The rate of right diagnosis is 88% for CT examination at the first time and all firsttime diagnosed patients had fever and cough. RNA detection combined with CT at the first
diagnosis, along with clinical manifestations can greatly increase the sensitivity and reduce
the rate of missed diagnosis. The cumulative positive rate of three times of throat swabs virus
RNA tests was 96%, and the cumulative diagnostic coincidence rate of two times CT tests
and nucleic acid tests reached 98%. The simultaneous application of two methods can
basically detect all potential patients. Based on this, we inferred that "3+2 " combined
strategy can diagnose most SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, which had great reference value
for the diagnosis of “clinically diagnosed cases”. The application of the "3+2" diagnostic
method was conducive to the effective control of the source of infection and was a key point
to improve SARS-CoV-2 prevention and control.

It has showed that SARS-CoV-2 is similar with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, using S-protein
interacts with human ACE2, thereby infecting human respiratory epithelial cells, causing
immune and inflammatory responses, and then producing cytokines and inflammatory
mediators, such as IL1β, IFNγ, IP10, MCP1, et al[25]. Moreover, studies have shown that the

15

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025023; this version posted February 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this

levels of GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFɑ are significantly higher in patients with
severe symptoms (ICU patients) than patients with mild symptoms, suggesting that the
"cytokine storm" may be related to the severity of the disease[26, 27]. Our study showed that
the levels of C-reactive protein was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients (66 [68%]
of 97 patients), and ESR was significantly accelerated (49 [57.6%] of 85 patients), indicating
that there is a significant inflammatory response among COVID-19 patients. Blood routine
results showed a decrease in lymphocytes count (56 [54.9%] of 102 patients), which means
that the acute immune response consumes immune cells and suppresses cellular immune
function, especially T lymphocyte function when the body encounters a new unknown virus
invasion[28]. Our studies also revealed that most patients had elevated ferritin levels (12
[92.3%] of 13 patients), and some patients had abnormal liver function and elevated muscle
enzymes, which indicated the damage of lung, liver and other organ, and enhanced tissue
repairment. Previous studies did not find an increase in ferritin among COVID-19 patients.
The phenomena of elevating levels of ferritin may make it a new indicator of the severity of
the disease's tissue damage and inflammation. However, whether C-reactive protein, ESR,
serum ferritin elevation, and lymphocyte reduction and their abnormalities are related to the
severity of the disease merits further study.

COVID-19 patients in our hospital all received antiviral and symptomatic treatment, antiinflammatory treatment and oxygen therapy if necessary. Symptoms released markedly after
one-week treatment on most patients. The rate of transferring to ICU and death was 8% and
3%, respectively, which was significantly lower than previous studies in Wuhan city. The
improvement in clinical outcome revealed that an early prevention and timely treatment could
effectively reduce the rate of critical illness and fatality proven in Xiangyang region with
relatively sufficient medical resources.

This study is a cross-sectional study, which only described and analyzed COVID-19 patients
with positive real-time RT-PCR results. However, concerning the low sensitivity of throat
swabs virus RNA detection in previous studies[20, 21, 24], we speculated that a part of suspected
patients or undiagnosed patients might be COVID-19 positive cases. Thus, studies excluding
those patients may not actually reflect the real picture of clinical and epidemiological feature
of SARS-CoV-2 infected population. Also, accounting for the limited follow-up duration, our
data may not reflect the complete course of COVID-19 development. In addition, it is a
cross-sectional study with limited ability to infer the causal associations. In the current state
of emergency, we hoped that our data-based findings could provide help for disease
prevention, control, diagnosis and treatment.

Conclusion
Patients in Xiangyang were mostly secondary transmission cases with the family-clustering
feature and unclear contact history. The rate of severe illness and death were low, whereas
some patients had longer incubation period. We, therefore, recommend prolonging the
quarantine period to three weeks when necessary. All patients with positive real-time RTPCR results had significant clinical symptoms and radiological features, which suggests we
could use a combination of real-time RT-PCR, chest CT scans and clinical manifestations on
admission to increase the diagnostic accuracy. Sensitivity of three rounds of real-time RTPCR together with two rounds of chest CT scans was higher compared with other diagnostic
methods. Thus, “3+2” strategy should be used to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, thereby
controlling the source of infection more effectively.
