The number of new daily SARS-CoV-2 infections is frantically rising
in almost every country of the EU. The phenomenological explanation offered is a new mutation of the virus, first identified in the UK.
We use publicly available data in combination with a controlled SIR
model, which captures the effects of preventive measures on the active cases, to show that the current wave of infections is consistent
with a single transmission rate. This suggests that the new SARSCoV-2 variant is as transmissible as previous strains. Our findings
indicate that the relaxation of preventive measures is closely related
with the ongoing surge in cases. We simulate the effects of new
restrictions and vaccination campaigns in 2021, demonstrating that
lockdown policies are not fully effective to flatten the curve. For effective mitigation, it is critical that the public keeps on high alert until
vaccination reaches a critical threshold.

The susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model (1)
(Fig. 1.a), is a popular vanilla model for computational scrutiny
used in numerous studies, often to estimate the characteristic
transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2. However, despite its flexibility and mathematical elegance, the model introduces some
important limitations. To determine whether new variants of
the SARS-CoV-2 are more transmissible than their predecessors, data analysis must cover the entire pandemic outbreak
and include the effects of preventive measures and contagion
policies taken by populations and governments, respectively.
The model also does not account for the social preventive
response which characterises the new normal, e.g. social distancing, mask wearing, limited commuting, remote working,
or local curfews and lockdowns, to name but a few examples.
Fitting data to a model which does not capture how these
important social changes affect the spreading of the virus is
not a reliable method to discern the transmission (β), recovery
β
(α) and basic reproductive (R0 = α
) rates. For instance, different values of R0 for the same virus with the same inherent
properties under different social contexts, e.g. partial and full
lockdown, are obtained. Data for the United Kingdom suggest
much higher values for β and R0 during September-December
2020 if analysed under the SIR premises (2). Despite the good
fitting of data achieved over limited temporal windows (2–5),
there are two important limitations compromising the accuracy of the predictions: a) one cannot fit the whole temporal
series, characterised by multiple infection waves, and indeed
the fit would eventually diverge; and b) the SIR model, or
the equivalent logistic growth model (2), would never forecast
a second or further upsurge in cases. Refined SIR models
to include additional factors, such as “shield immunity” (6),
do not come to our rescue. Indeed, despite their increased
flexibility they are still only capable of showing a single wave.
Additionally, many studies fitted SIR-like models to data from
the last stages of the first wave – even though the models

suffer from the inherent limitation of a single-wave prediction
– thus effectively assuming that the epidemic was coming to an
end. Yet it was already known at the time that the number
of cases was decreasing because of the preventive measures
which in turn should have been sufficient to abandon the corresponding models. Thus, current studies are incomplete and
an alternative approach is necessary.
The main results of the present work are as follows. Consideration of the full-history of the data with a controlled
SIR model (Fig. 1.b) avoids the drawbacks of previous models,
by capturing the essence of how the new normal affects the
number of infected people. This unveils unique and constant β
and R0 for the entire pandemic. Thousands of mutations have
emerged in the SARS-CoV-2 genome since the first outbreak
in 2019, and only the UK strain, known as B.1.1.7, is being
reported as a more “aggressive” form of the virus, because of
an alarming surge in new cases thought to be correlated with
the new UK variant, and was one the reasons for the lockdown
imposed in the UK at the beginning of 2021, e.g. Ref. (7).
According to the law of parsimony: chose the simplest explanation from those that fit. Indeed, our results show that the
fierce increase in cases is captured without the need of a more
transmissible variant, suggesting that genomic data during the
pandemic might have been overinterpreted. Our approach includes characteristic parameters which could be pivotal in the
decision-making process in the coming months. For instance,
there seems to be an inertia of society which plays a crucial
role on the flattening of the curve. For preventive measures
to be effective, these should be encouraged quite early in the
surge of cases, taking into consideration the inherent social
inertia, which typically leads up to three-weak delay up until
society gets to its maximum level of alert. We also include
the effect of vaccination, and show that social relaxation as
of March 2021 without fulfilling a sufficient vaccination rate

showing a maximum of effectiveness η1 ' 65%, social inertia δi ' 21 d, and social relaxation starting at mid June 2020, with prediction of no measures in δr ' 45 d
after relaxation begins. The second wave of social awareness begins in September (confirmed by Prime Minister (9)), reaching η2 ' 60% by mid October 2020 (three-tier
system was introduced (10)). The upsurge of CoVid-19 cases in December 2020 is again a consequence of social relaxation. (c)-(e) Controlled SIR model with vaccination
rates: 0.1%d−1 , 0.2%d−1 , and 0.4%d−1 , respectively, along with a third-wave of preventive measures (expected to reach maximum effectiveness, η3 = 70%, by the mid
January 2021). To avoid a fourth wave, the vaccination campaign would need to deliver ∼ 200 × 103 vaccines per day (∼ 0.4%N/d) as of the first week of January 2021.

(determined below) will lead to a new wave of infections over
May-June 2021, independently of the more strict lockdown
currently imposed since January 2021.
Figure 2 reports curve fits and predictions of the free and
controlled SIR models. The free version (Fig. 1.a) fits well the
data of the first wave of infections from March to June 2020,
but completely fails to predict any second or further wave. This
is because in a free SIR model the decay of the infected cases
is only possible when the pandemic is already in recession. [As
we know now and back in June 2020, this was not the reason
for the decrease in cases back then; rather the reduction of
susceptible people is due to preventive measures.] Yet has been
a standard way of extracting estimates for β, α and R0 . Some
works even published estimates for these quantities via manual
fitting to data (5), effectively a trial-and-error approach. The
authors justified this by asserting that a rigorous non-lineal
fitting did not follow the data as close as their approach.

However, instead of imposing the SIR model and changing
the fitting method to achieve agreement with the model, the
disagreement with a nonlinear fit means that they should have
abandoned the model.
Not only does the controlled SIR model fits better the firstwave data (inset plot, Fig. 2.b), but also captures the reason for
the decrease in cases from mid April to August 2020, namely
a wave of social awareness (A) which effectively reduced the
number of susceptible people. A embodies both contagion
policies and the citizens efforts made to “flatten the curve”, e.g.
wearing masks, reducing travelling or self-isolating. Moreover,
the model predicts a sudden rise in cases when society relaxes,
because the downtrend in new infections is not related with
the end of the pandemic but with a temporary removal of
susceptible candidates from the system. This is precisely what
happened from July to September 2020, and what eventually
led to the surge in cases in early September 2020. This sharp

where η k ∈ [0, 1] is the effectiveness of the preventive measures
taken in the k−th wave, T k is related to the time extension of these
measures, and δi,r are the social inertia (i) and relaxation (r) time
scales, respectively. With A = 0 and ν = 0, Eq. (1) becomes the
free SIR model. For A 6= 0 we get a controlled SIR model. The
initial condition used: I0 = 1 (number of infective cases reported
on January 11, 2020), S0 = N − I0 and R0 = V0 = 0. Thus fitting
of five parameters is needed, and this is done at the first wave.

increase immediately raised the alarm (8, 9), and A started
growing again, reaching a maximum effectiveness when the
three-tier restrictions system was imposed (10). However, these
measures were not enough to flatten the curve and a new
increase appeared in December 2020 because of a gradual
relaxation over the month of November. By incorporating
new waves of preventive measures in A the model is able to
reproduce the above observations, as illustrated in Figs 2.b-e.
This provides evidence of the predictive capabilities of the
model.
Figures 2.c-e reveal the effects of the third lockdown imposed on January 4, 2021 and of the vaccination campaign
with rates 0.1%d−1 , 0.2%d−1 , and 0.4%d−1 , respectively. The
trends illustrate that unless the campaign delivers ∼ 200 × 103
vaccines per day, a fourth wave is unavoidable. At the same
time, if the vaccination rate is less than 100 × 103 vaccines per
day, the fourth wave will be as severe as previous ones.
Analysis of European countries’ data depicted in Fig.3,
including countries severely hit by the pandemic, like Spain
and Italy, reveals that virtually in all cases, the UK pattern
persists and similar conclusions can be drawn. This means,
social relaxation – typically two-to-three months – driving an
abrupt increase of cases, followed by increased awareness and
preventive measures leading to temporal stagnation, which is
then followed by further growth, i.e. a third, more powerful,
wave.
Methods
Population dynamics. The population is split into four groups: sus-

ceptible (S), infected (I), recovered (R) and vaccinated (V ), as
illustrated in Fig.1. The groups follow the delayed dynamical system:

where R + V =
ds (αI(s) + νN ), N = S + I + R + V is the

total population, assumed 60 million. The parameters β, α, ν
are the transmission, recovery, and vaccination rates, respectively,
and A(t − τ ) is the percentage of susceptible people using effective preventive measures at time t − τ , (τ being a characteristic
time for such preventive measures to become apparent, assumed 14
days, the incubation period,(14)) with general functional form:

least squares to fit the daily new cases ∆ =
to the firstdt
wave data (training dataset). This fitting yields for the free model:
β
β = 0.515d−1 and α = 0.420d−1 so that R0 = α
' 1.23. For the
−1
controlled model we get: β = 0.211 d , α = 0.102 d−1 , η = 0.65,
140 d, δa = 21 d and δr = 45 d, which yields R0 ' 2.068. To test the
models we numerically integrate Eq. (1) for both cases, i.e., A(t) = 0
and A(t) 6= 0. The controlled-model prediction for new infections
grows exponentially as of September 2020 (testing dataset) when
the first wave of preventive measures would vanish according to the
summer trend. With δi,r fixed from the first wave, we fit the parameters η and T of a second social response to unveil the behavioural
changes adopted against the apparent second wave of cases, obtaining a maximum of social response by mid-end October 2020. This is
in perfect agreement with the declaration of the UK Prime Minister
“seeing a second wave” on September 18, 2020 (9), and his statement
on coronavirus where the three-tier restrictions system was imposed
on October 12, 2020 (10). For predictions as of January 2021, we
introduce a third wave of measures aiming at an 70% of effectiveness,
i.e. η = 0.70, starting in January and ending in April 2021, T = 90 d,
which represents the current contagion policies being taken by the
UK government. Finally, we adopt three potential values for ν:
