ABSTRACT

23

In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Solidarity Program

24

probably the largest global initiative to encourage and support research in four

25

promising drugs and therapies (Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, β interferon and the

26

combination Lopinavir / Ritonavir) to reduce the mortality of COVID-19. Considering

27

the potential impact of this project to restrain the current pandemic, the present study

28

aims to investigate whether it was designed upon a scientific basis. For this proposal,

29

we collected all documents on coronavirus indexed in Scopus database by using a

30

search strategy based in MESH terms. Among the studied groups of documents, we

31

looked in more detail the Coronavirus group in order to find documents related to

32

WHO´s drugs or to other drugs and therapies extracted from another source. The main

33

findings indicate that the number of documents related to WHO’s drugs are higher than

34

in the other groups and this subset of documents involves a larger number of institutions

35

and countries. Hence, the results shown in this study illustrate that decisions by an

36

international body, as WHO, may be science-based and not be merely bureaucratic

37

decisions.

INTRODUCTION

45

Although coronaviruses became popular in 2020, these types of viruses have

46

been considered pathogens for several groups of animals, including humans, since

47

decades. Today, it is widely known that coronaviruses are a large family of viruses with

48

the potential to cause a spectrum of diseases ranging from a simple cold to a severe

49

acute respiratory syndrome (1).

50

In the 1960s, coronaviruses that infect humans were isolated for the first time

51

from samples of nasal secretion of patients with symptoms of cold (2). Since then,

52

seven types of human coronavirus (HCoV) have been identified, among which four are

53

endemic, that is, are exclusively found in some regions and are associated with mild

54

symptoms of respiratory diseases (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and

55

HCoV-HKU1). Two other types include the acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-

56

CoV), identified in 2002, and the Middle East syndrome virus (MERS-CoV), identified

57

in 2012, both are associated with severe respiratory symptoms and high mortality rates

58

(3). The last type, identified in 2019 and known as “new coronavirus” (SARS-CoV-2),

59

is also associated with severe respiratory symptoms, but unlike previous ones, it is

60

highly transmissible (4; 5), which favored the rapid spreading of the current pandemic.

61

According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI),

62

coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, which

63

is divided into four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and

64

Deltacoronavirus. Alpha and Betacoronavirus infect only mammals, while most gamma

65

and Deltacoronavirus infect birds but it may also infect mammals (6; 7). Out of the

66

seven HCoV already identified, two belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus (HCov-229E

67

and HCoV-NL63) and the other five belong to the genus Betacoronavirus (7).

68

The Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, that is, the new coronavirus is highly

69

pathogenic and responsible for the coronavirus disease pandemic started in late 2019,

70

named COVID-19. This pandemic has been mobilizing the global scientific community

71

in the search for alternatives to diagnose and prevent new cases, as well as alternatives

72

to treat patients already infected by SARS-CoV-2 (8-10). The current efforts of

73

scientists from different parts of the world to increase and to share rapidly the new

74

knowledge on COVID or coronavirus have been discussed and presented in several

75

studies (11-15).

76

The growing literature about scientific publications on COVID or coronavirus at

77

a time when the world still suffers from the pandemic has highlighted not only general

78

analyzes such as the studies mentioned above, but has also emphasized other aspects

79

including: the contribution of a specific country or region (16, 17), comparison with the

80

scientific publication on other viruses (18), publication analysis based in different

81

information sources (19, 20) and about the faster editorial flow (21). Despite the wide

82

thematic variety in this literature, we have not observed studies focusing on scientific

83

publication on drugs and preventive treatments, such as vaccines, to restrain the new

84

coronavirus.

85

The discovery and development of new drugs, as well as other treatments, can

86

take years to result in a prototype and product (10, 22, 23). However, in an emergency

87

situation, one way to fasten this process is the repositioning of drugs, that is, the

88

investigation of a new use for an existing drug, thus avoiding expensive and time-

89

consuming toxicological essays (24, 25). Such initiatives have been taking place in the

90

COVID-19 epidemic, being the Solidarity Program probably the largest example.

91

Launched in March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO), the program aims

92

encouraging and supporting worldwide research in four promising drugs and therapies

93

(26, 27): (i) remdesivir, an antiviral that inhibits the RNA virus cycle, (ii)

94

hydroxychloroquine, a drug used as a therapy against malaria and rheumatoid arthritis,

95

(iii) berta interferon, a drug used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and (iv) the

96

combination lopinavir / ritonavir, drugs used to treat HIV. After almost four months and

97

in the face of negative results, WHO reviewed the program and withdrew the support

98

for research with hydroxychloroquine and the combined drugs lopinavir/ritonavir.

99

Although the motivation for choosing these therapies, and not others, is not clear

100

in the Solidarity Project (20), it is expected that the WHO's choice was based on

101

existing scientific evidences that place these therapies in a prominent position.

102

However, we may not discard that many national and even global initiatives, in this case

103

related to the epidemic, can also be motivated by other aspects, such as politics, as was

104

observed in a recent study (28).

105

Considering both the lack of studies about research on drugs related to

106

coronavirus and the potential impact of the Solidarity Project in to restrain the current

107

pandemic, the present study aims to investigate whether WHO’s project was designed

108

upon a scientific basis, that is, the extent to which the drugs indicated in the project

109

reflect the efforts of the global scientific community related with coronavirus. For this,

110

we carried out a comparative bibliometric study regarding both the drugs indicated in

111

the Solidarity Project and other drugs and vaccines already in an advanced stage in the

112

clinical trials, as indicated in the Report “Disease Briefing: Coronaviruses”, by

113

Clarivate Analytics (29). The Clarivate report in March 2020, by the time we started

114

collecting data, was an international reference with wide coverage and details on

115

coronavirus research, compiling information from Cortellis, Web of Science, and

116

BioWorld.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

119

We used the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) browser (30) to define the

120

search strategy. On April 25, 2020, by using the exact match term ‘coronavirus’ in the

121

filters Full Word Search, Exact Match and Main Heading Terms, we found three main

122

terms in MeSH Tree Structures, which we named coronavirus groups, as presented in

123

Figure 1. Note that the Deltacoronavirus is not presented among the three main groups

124

in the MeSH Tree Structure, which explains its absence in the following analysis.

125
126

127
128

After testing variations of MeSH terms, we decided to collect data separately in

129

four groups: a generalist and other three groups that correspond to coronavirus genera

130

found in MeSH Tree. The search strategies used to collect documents for each group are

131

as following:

132

- Coronavirus: coronav*;

133

- Group Alphacoronavirus: alphacoronav* OR "alpha coronav*" OR alphacoronavirus-1

134

OR "Transmissible gastroenteritis vir*" OR hcov-nl63 OR hcov-229e OR "Porcine

135

136

- Group Betacoronavirus betacoronavirus-1 OR betacoronav* OR beta-coronav* OR

137

139

OR ("Gastroenteritis Vir*" W/1 murine) OR mhv-jhm OR "SARS Vir*" OR ("Severe

140

144

Data collection was carried out on May 30, 2020 at the Scopus database, due to

145

its greater collection coverage when compared to other databases. Using the advanced

146

search mode, the search strategy of each group was searched in title, abstract and

147

keyword filters. The results were exported in the BibTeX format considering data on

148

Citation information, Bibliographical information, Abstract & keywords and Funding.

149

The totals of retrieved documents in the four groups were: 2,719 documents on

150

alphacoronavirus, 13,655 on Betacoronavirus, 2,745 on Gammacoronavirus and 28,013

151

on coronavirus. The later, that is, the most generalist and largest group, was used as

152

reference for all analysis, with the exception of Figure 2.

153

The 28,013 documents on coronavirus were classified according to the type of

154

research application as: vaccine, diagnosis and treatment. To identify documents

155

classified as vaccine, we used the words vaccine, vaccines, vaccinia and vaccination. As

156

for diagnosis, we used the diagnos while for those classified as treatment, we used the

157

words treat and therap. For this process, we used a script developed in the R language

158

(31) and the words were searched in the title, abstract and database and author’s

159

keywords.

160

Documents on coronavirus were also classified according to the drug or therapy

161

they are related with, that is, WHO’s drugs and other drugs or therapies listed in the

162

Clarivate’s report. To identify documents that are related with WHO’s drugs, we used

163

the following terms: “hydroxychloroquine sulfate”, remdesivir, “lopinavir / ritonavir”,

164

“ritonavir / lopinavir”, “lopinavir plus ritonavir”, “ritonavir plus lopinavir”, “lopinavir

165

ritonavir”, “ritonavir lopinavir”, “interferon beta”, “beta interferon”, “interferonbeta”

166

and “betainterferon”. As for second group, initially we have selected 31 drugs or

167

therapies all listed as clinical trials in phases I, II or III in Clarivate’s report.

168

Nevertheless, we discarded 11 drugs and therapies since they were not found within

169

documents on coronavirus. Thus, documents related to 20 drugs and therapies were

170

classified in three groups: other drugs, antibody and vaccine. The group Other drugs

171

includes documents with at least one of the terms: “darunavir/cobicistat”,

172

“cobicistat/darunavir”, “darunavir plus cobicistat”, cobicistat plus darunavir”,

173

“darunavir cobicistat”, “cobicistat darunavir”, “chloroquine phosphate”, “danoprevir”,

174

“diammonium glycyrrhiinate”, “favipiravir”, “leronlimab” or “oseltamivir phosphate”.

175

As for the group Antibody, documents include at least one of the terms: “sarilumab”,

176

“regeneron 3048”, “regn 3048”, “regn3048”, “regn-3048”, “regeneron 3051” “regn

177

3051”, “regn3051”, “regn-3051”, “sab-301”, “sab 301”, “sab301” or “siltuximab”.

178

Finally, the group vaccine includes documents with at least one of the following terms:

179

“gls5300”, “gls-5300”, “gls 5300”, “chadox1 mers”, “chadox1-mers”, “mva-mers-s”,

180

“mvamers-s”, “mrna 1273” or “mrna-1273”. All these terms were searched in the

181

abstract, document title and database and author keywords.

182

For the analysis of institutions, we have considered the data on “author’s

183

affiliations – disambiguated” of documents classified as WHO’s drugs or Other drugs,

184

Antibody and Vaccine. With the help of a script developed in R language, affiliations

185

were checked and duplications in a single document were deleted. Thus, based on the

186

list of institutions without duplications, it was possible to rank institutions and countries

187

according to the frequency of documents in each group.

188

In order to verify whether the most prolific institutions among documents on

189

coronavirus are also the most prolific in terms of the development of therapies against

190

COVID-19, in 23 July, 2020, we collected the list of agreements in progress catalogued

by Cortellis, a database of Clarivate Analytics. By searching the term “coronavirus

192

infection”, we have found 2,226 agreements, which encompass 186 institutions, 766

193

drugs and 879 patents. Data on agreements were downloaded in a Microsoft Excel

194

format and all agreements dealing with drugs and therapies were identified as following.

195

Agreements classified as WHO’s drugs were identified by having the following

196

terms: hydroxych, remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir, “interferon beta”, “beta interferon”,

197

interferonbeta and betainterferon. As for agreements on Other drugs, we used the words

198

darunavir,

199

favipiravir, leronlimab and oseltamivir. As for agreements classified as antibody and

200

vaccine were identified, respectively,

201

sarilumab, “regeneron 3048”, “regn 3048”, regn3048, regn-3048, “regeneron 3051”,

217

as their leading institutions and countries.

219

Time trends of the four groups of documents on coronavirus

220

The number of documents on coronavirus classified under the four main groups

221

by decades is shown in Figure 2. As can be seen, the number of documents found in the

222

1940s and 1950s is residual, either because of the database’s low journal coverage in

223

these decades or because research on coronavirus was still incipient at that time.

224
225

Figure 2: Number of documents on coronavirus and on the three coronavirus

226

families according to the decade. Source: Scopus

227
228

In the 1940s, we found the first document on coronavirus registered in Scopus: a

229

paper entitled “Demonstration of an interference phenomenon associated with infectious

230

bronchitis virus (IBV) of chickens”, that is, a clear example of document related to one

231

of the main MeSH terms related to Gammacoronavirus. As for the following decade, we

232

found 18 documents in the Betacoronavirus group, being none of them related to human

233

coronavirus but to hepatitis virus either in mouse or mice, which is in accordance to

234

MeSH terms indicated to this family.

235

From 1960s to 2020s, there was a strong growth trend in the number of

236

documents related to most groups, specially the Coronavirus group (gray bar).

237

Documents of this group increased from 89 to 9,179, that is, a growth rate of 102.1 in

238

the period. Considering the total of documents indexed at Scopus database, these totals

239

represent 0.00% and 0.44%, respectively, which signals a real increase in this theme in

240

the set of documents in the database.

241

The total of documents related to the three coronavirus genera also indicates

242

growth over the periods, except for 2020 in the groups of Alphacoronavirus (blue bar)

243

and Gamacoronavirus (black bar), being the latter not associated with humans. The total

244

number of documents in these two groups increased, respectively, from 9 to 1,492 (a

245

growth rate of 164.8) and 56 to 1,052 (a growth rate of 17.8) in the period from 1960 to

246

2010. Considering the whole set of coronavirus documents (with no duplication)

247

published in the 2010s (n = 8.210), the share of documents on Alphacoronavirus and

248

Gamacoronavirus are 18.17% and 12.81% respectively.

249

As for Betacoronavirus (orange bar), we observe an intense growth until 2020

250

with an increased from 122 in 1960 to 5,522 in 2020 (a growth rate of 44.3). These

251

totals correspond to 0.38% and 17.35 % of the whole set of coronavirus documents

252

(with no duplication) published in the respective decades. It is noteworthy that, as

253

observed for the coronavirus group (gray bar), documents on Betacoronavirus had a

254

notable increase over the period, which seems to take place in two phases: from 1960 to

255

1990 and from 2000 to 2020. In this second phase, we observe a greater acceleration in

256

the growth rate. The inclusion of new titles in the Scopus database throughout the 2000s

257

may partially explain it while the outbreak of SARS in Asia during 2020, which reached

258

a total of 33 countries on the five continents (32), has boosted research on coronavirus,

259

especially on Betacoronavirus that is associated with SARS, and so led to the notable

260

increase in publications observed between the 1990s and 2000s.

261
262
263

Types of research application among documents on coronavirus group
As the Coronoravirus group (n.

28,013) display the largest number of

264

documents, we decided to investigate some parameters to better characterize it. In this

265

section, we present the distribution of these documents according to the type of research

266

application they are related with, that is (a) diagnosis, (b) treatment or (c) vaccine, a

267

typology is supported by Tarik Jasarevic (33). The analysis was carried out considering

268

a Venn diagram (Figure 3), which makes it possible to identify the intersections

269

between the three types of applications.

270

Figure 3: Venn diagram to the three types of research application among

271

documents on coronavirus published in the complete period. Source: Scopus

272
273

We found that, over the period of analysis, the scientific community on

274

coronavirus has been dedicating more efforts to research related to treatment (n. 5,947).

275

The documents in this group, in general, include controlled studies with antiviral agents

276

or with some other drugs to reduce or combat symptoms related to the disease.

277

Documents related to diagnosis (n. 4,388) and vaccine (n. 3,900) are less

278

frequent. The first group includes publications that deal with diagnostic imaging

279

techniques, techniques for the detection of the virus and epidemiological data, while

280

the latter includes publications related to techniques and essential content for the

281

development of a vaccine, such as the viral genome, the viral envelope proteins,

282

neutralizing antibodies, virus replication etc.

283

Regarding the shared areas in the diagram, documents related to treatment

284

display the largest intersection areas, they are: with diagnosis (n. 1,400 documents) and

285

with vaccine (n. 1,154 documents). This finding reinforces the prominent role of this

286

type of research application (treatment) within the set of documents on coronavirus. It is

287

also relevant to highlight the 280 documents that were identified in the intersection area

288

that includes treatment, diagnosis and vaccine. Out of 280 documents, 130 are review

289

articles, while the remaining are research articles focused in a more general

290

understanding of the disease or the virus.

Drugs and other therapies among documents on coronavirus group

293

In this section, we identify and compare the number of documents on

294

Coronavirus group (n. 28,013) related to two groups of drugs and to a group of

295

Antibody, both with the potential for use in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. We

296

also analyzed the documents on coronavirus related to a group of vaccines, which

297

makes a counterpoint to the groups of drugs and Antibody, since it is generally a

298

preventive method for avoid spreading the disease. Figure 4 presents the number of

299

documents on coronavirus by decade according to the group of drugs or other therapies.

300

As a first observation, we draw attention to the low number of documents in the four

301

groups, which adds up to 908 between 1980 and 2020, that is, a share of 3.24% of the

302

total documents on Coronavirus group published in the period.

306
307

As can be noted, WHO drug-related documents (red bar), that is, those indicated

308

in the WHO Solidarity Project, predominate largely among the documents on

309

coronavirus in all periods. Documents included in WHO drugs sum 752, that is, 82.8%

310

of the total number of documents on coronavirus included in the four groups of drugs or

311

other therapies.

312

From the 2010s on, it is noted an increase in documents related to other drugs

313

(orange bar) and antibody (dark blue). We believe that such increase is due to the

314

outbreak of MERS-CoV, which emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The research driven

315

by this outbreak gained more strength in late 2019, when the SARS-CoV2 pandemic

316

started.

317

Curiously, we did not observe a similar trend among documents related to

318

vaccines (light blue). The low and reducing number of these documents in the last

319

decades may be a consequence of the complex process that developing a vaccine is,

320

characterized by its time duration and confidentiality, which often reduces the diffusion

321

of the publication.

322

For a better understanding of the nature of the four groups of drugs and other

323

therapies, Table 1 presents the name of the compound and its respective number of

324

documents in each group.

329

Within the group WHO’s drugs, documents referring to a drug named Interferon

330

beta are the majority (n. 331), while those related to Hydroxychloroquine sulfate, which

331

was widely propagated by some global representatives (34) as a potential treatment for

332

COVID 19, are the least frequent (n. 13) in this group.

333

Regarding the group Other drugs, we found documents on coronavirus related to

334

seven drugs, among them Favipiravir, a nucleoside analog already used in the treatment

335

of influenza A and B, appears with the largest number of documents in the period (n.

336

88). In the group Antibody, we identified documents on coronavirus related to five

337

drugs, being Sarilumab, a human monoclonal antibody already used to treat rheumatoid

338

arthritis, the one with the largest number of documents (n. 24). Finally, in the group

339

Vaccine, the largest number of documents is related to the GLS 5300 vaccine (n. 5), a

340

vaccine that uses plasmid DNA to express the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein.

Drugs and other therapies among coronavirus documents and agreements: the main

343

leaders

344

In this final section, we analyze the institutions and countries that lead the

345

research in the four groups of drugs and other therapies according to the number of

346

documents on Coronavirus group (collected from Scopus database) as well as

347

agreements to develop therapies against the coronavirus (collected from the Cortellis

348

database).

349

In Table 2, we first present a general analysis, where the number of documents

350

and agreements on coronavirus are related to the number of institutions and countries

351

within the four main groups of drugs and other therapies.

356

In Scopus documents, we observed that documents in WHO drugs and Other

357

drugs are distributed almost equally among the three categories of number institutions.

358

Documents with two or more institutions sum 482 and 70, which represent 64.1% and

359

67.3% in both groups, respectively. As for documents in Antibody and Vaccine, we

360

note a quite different trend, especially the latter, with 80% of the documents signed by

361

two or more institutions. Although documents of this groups tend to show a high level

362

of collaboration, they embrace the lowest diversity and number of institutions and

363

countries.

364

As for the agreements on coronavirus, that is the Cortellis dataset, we did not

365

observe any variation in terms of number of institutions, since all agreements refer the

366

participation of two institutions only, in other words, data refer to bilateral agreements.

367

However, we noted a low level of institutional and country diversity, especially among

368

documents included in Antibody and Vaccine groups. When compared to Scopus

369

dataset, we observed a different trend in terms of the share of each group: the largest

370

number of agreements is related to Others drugs rather than to WHO’s drugs while the

371

lowest number of agreements is related to Antibody and not to Vaccine.

372

In order to better understanding whether institutions are involved in the research

373

on coronavirus and in the development of a treatment to prevent or to seek the cure for

374

the virus, we investigated the top leading institutions in terms of number of documents

375

and agreements according to the groups of drugs and therapies (Table 3).

382

Among Scopus documents, we observed the predominance of institutions from

383

education sector and the presence of a few number of research institutes and

384

corporations. In the two groups related to drugs (WHO drugs and Other drugs), the

385

University of Hong Kong appears with the largest number of documents. Other

386

universities also stand out in these groups, but are not listed in the others groups, they

387

are: Hong Kong University, Emory University and University of Virginia. Out of the

388

institutions that are listed in more than one group, apart those mentioned before, we

389

found Harvard Medical School and University of Iowa, both authoring documents on

390

WHO drugs and Antibody.

391

In the group Antibody, the leadership is with Columbia University. This group

392

presents the largest variety of research institutes and corporations, such as the Istituto

393

Nazionale Tumori, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Macrogenics

394

Inc., National Institutes of Health and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. While the group

395

Vaccine shows German Center for Infection Research and Philipps University of

396

Marburg (both assigning four documents) and other two universities, University of

397

Munich and University of Oxford. None of the institutions in this group is repeated in

398

the others.

399

A comparison with the top leading institutions in terms of agreements on

400

coronavirus pointed to a completely different profile, with a predominance of private

401

companies established in Europe and the USA, mainly. We also observed the presence

402

of a few number of universities and research institutes, of which we stand out: (a) The

403

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (USA) included in the groups

404

WHO’s drugs and Other Drugs, (b) the University of Oxford (UK) enclosed in the

405

groups WHO’s drugs and Vaccine and (c) the US Department of Health and Human

406

Services (US) in the groups Antibody and Vaccine.

407

Among the private companies, we highlight the following: (a) in the group

408

WHO’s drugs, the Gilead Sciences Inc that is investigating the drug Remdesevir (35),

409

(b) in the group Other Drugs, the CytoDyn Inc that is carrying on research on

410

Leronlimab which is in phase 3 clinical trial (36) and (c) in the group Vaccine, the

411

ModeRNA Therapeutics that is developing the mRNA-1273 vaccine, which is also in

412

phase 3 clinical trial (37).

413

As a final analysis, we investigated the distribution of documents and

414

agreements on coronavirus according the country, as shown in Figures 5 and 6. The

415

color intensity in both maps indicates the quantity of documents or agreements in each

416

group of drugs or therapies. To better visualize the contribution of each country, the

417

maps present an attached table, which contains the total number of documents (Figure

418

5) or agreements (Figure 6) by country as well as the number of documents or

419

agreements in collaboration (internal collaboration, that is, between institutions in the

420

same country, and external collaboration, that is, between institutions from different

421

countries).

422

Regarding the number of documents (Figure 5), the United States and China are

423

the most prominent, with respectively 311 and 174 documents published in the whole

424

period. The majority of these documents (67.8% for China and 58.8% for the United

425

States) were developed without external collaboration, what indicates a high level of

426

research independence of both countries. As for the different groups of drugs and

427

therapies, we also observed a central role of the United States and China. Besides, the

428

maps clearly show that the research on WHO’s drugs is the one that mostly drives the

429

attention and efforts of scientific community, including documents signed by authors

430

from all continents. On the other side, research on coronavirus vaccine does attract or

431

involve a few numbers of countries from restricted regions of the world.

Considering the agreements (Figure 6), the United States once again stands out,

437

being the country with the largest number and share of agreements on coronavirus

438

(almost 50%), while the United Kingdom (and not China) appeared in the second

439

position (with almost 14%). Among the four groups of drugs and therapies, the United

440

States leadership is unbeatable, while European countries show a low level of

441

involvement. It is noteworthy that none of the groups contains agreements authored by

442

countries from all continents, as we observed in Figure 5 for group WHO’s drugs.

Comparing each group in Figures 5 and 6, we noted that countries are found in

both maps, but others are replaced or simply disappear, as it is the case of Latin

449

American and African countries that are included in the map of WHO’s drugs in Figure

450

5 but not in Figure 6. Of course, such different profile may be a consequence of the fact

451

that agreements are signed by two countries only. Nevertheless, it may indicate a gap

452

between countries: in one side the majority of countries that do have technical and

453

human capacities to develop research on coronavirus and in another side just few

454

countries that have these capacities and also the ones needed to develop new forms or

455

products to treat or to prevent the coronavirus.

458

The present study aims to investigate whether the drugs indicated by WHO’s

459

Solidarity Project reflect the efforts of the global scientific community related with

460

coronavirus, in other words, in what extent the choice of these drugs is science-based.

461

Such approach, as far as our knowledge, is unique if we consider the lack of similar

462

papers about research on coronavirus in world literature. Besides this characteristic, the

463

present study does develop an innovative strategy search based in MESH terms, which

464

made it possible to retrieve data of 31,815 documents on coronavirus (with no

465

duplication). Such number of documents is indeed high when compared to other similar

466

papers, where the highest number of analyzed documents around 18,000 (38; 39).

467

Hence, considering these two characteristics, we do believe in the originality,

468

robustness and reliability of the data presented in our paper.

469

Among the general findings, we observed a continuous growth over the decades

470

in three out of the four studied groups of documents (Figure 2), especially the one

471

named as Coronavirus (n. 28,013). In 2020, we observed a big drop in the number of

472

documents in both Gammacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus groups, a clear indication

473

of the great effort of global science to find a quickly response to the human coronavirus

474

responsible for the 2020 epidemic, with a possible shift of researchers from these two

475

groups to beta.

476

As Coronavirus group encompasses documents of other groups, we considered it

477

as our main source to carry on the following analyzes, including the analysis related to

478

type of research application (Figure 3). With respect to this analysis, we found that the

479

majority of documents are associated with treatment, that correspond to 22.2% of

480

publications included in the Coronavirus group. Contrarily Lou et al (40) found that

481

publications on coronavirus associated to diagnosis and treatment correspond to 10.4%,

482

while those associated to epidemiology are the most frequent, that is 37.2%.

483

Nevertheless, such discrepancy may be a consequence of the low number of

484

publications on coronavirus analyzed by these authors (n. 183), what made it possible a

485

manual categorization of the publications into different research focuses.

486

In a second part of our study, that is its core part, we presented findings on

487

documents of Coronavirus group related with drugs and other therapies. We showed

488

that documents in the group WHO’s drugs are much higher than in the other groups

489

(Figure 4 and Table 1), a first indication that WHO’s Solidarity Project was designed

490

upon a robust scientific basis. Nevertheless, it does not mean that all drugs included in

491

this project had the potential to act effectively against betacoronavirs and so in curing

492

COVID-19. In fact, during the development of this study, hydroxychloroquine and the

493

combined drugs lopinavir/ritonavir were inefficient in the COVID-19 clinical trials and

494

so WHO and its partner institutions discontinued their ongoing research. The other two

495

drugs are still in the agenda of global science, but recent results suggest they are as not

496

as much promising in curing or reducing mortality by COVID-19 (41). Despite these

497

disappointments, experts have pointed to many benefits that arose with this big project

498

led by WHO, as stated by Nahid Bhadelia, from the Boston Medical Center “You’re

499

including many different types of subgroups and populations in different parts of the

500

world.” (41)

501

In fact, WHO’s Project counted on the participation of a wide variety of

502

institutions and countries and so conduct clinical trials all of the world is probably due

503

to the already existing scientific capital and structure in such institutions. It is clear that,

504

among the four groups of drugs and therapies that we investigated, documents related to

505

WHO’s drugs are the ones with the highest involvement of worldwide scientific

506

community (Table 2 and Figure 5). Hence, this is the second sign that WHO’s

507

Solidarity Project was designed upon a scientific basis. A choice of other drugs that had

508

no or very few involvements of institutions and countries would demand a more

509

complex logistic and training and probably it would be more costly.

510

Our data showed that China and USA share the leadership on coronavirus

511

documents not only in the group of WHO’s drugs but in all other groups of drugs and

512

therapies, being most of these documents with an international collaboration. The

513

strategic position of China and USA as the main leaders of research on coronavirus or

514

COVID-19 is observed in some other studies (40, 42), what corroborates their robust

515

and qualified human workforce as well as their competitive infrastructure. The two

516

nations do also stand out among the top ranked countries in terms of agreements to

517

develop therapies against the coronavirus (Figure 6). Nevertheless, we observed a

518

smaller number of countries signing these agreements, that is, a completely different

519

framework when compared to documents (Figure 5), what may indicate a gap between

520

countries in having technical and human capacities to develop both research on

521

coronavirus or new forms or products to treat or to prevent the coronavirus.

522

Finally, although our findings indicated the WHO’s choice on the repurposed

523

drugs against COVID-19 was scientific-based in terms of number of published

524

documents and involved institutions, we cannot discard that other drugs may display

525

better performance in both variables. Nevertheless, investigate all available drugs and

526

therapies that are taking part in ongoing research would be a hard (or impossible) task.

527

In any case, we believe that the data shown in this study illustrates that decisions by

528

international organizations, especially in health, may have scientific knowledge as a

529

background and not be merely bureaucratic decisions.
