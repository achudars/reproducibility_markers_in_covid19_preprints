Abstract
Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is the gold-standard technique for severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection in nasopharyngeal swabs specimens.
The analysis by RT-qPCR usually requires a previous extraction step to obtain the purified viral
RNA. Unfortunately, RNA extraction constitutes a bottleneck for early detection in many countries
since it is expensive, time-consuming and depends on the availability of commercial kits. Here, we
describe an extraction-free protocol for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR from nasopharyngeal
swab clinical samples in saline solution. The method includes a treatment with proteinase K

followed by heat inactivation (PK+HID method). We demonstrate that PK+HID improves the RTqPCR performance in comparison to the heat-inactivation procedure. Moreover, we show that this
extraction-free protocol can be combined with a variety of multiplexing RT-qPCR kits. The method
combined with a multiplexing detection kit targeting N and ORF1ab viral genes showed a sensitivity
of 0.99 and a specificity of 0.99 from the analysis of 106 positive and 106 negative clinical samples.
In conclusion, PK+HID is a robust, fast and inexpensive procedure for extraction-free RT-qPCR
determinations of SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, was declared a
pandemic by World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Confronted by the lack of a vaccine or
specific treatment, early detection, isolation and contact tracing are fundamental strategies for
reducing the spread of this disease [1].
RT-qPCR is the gold standard method for SARS-CoV-2 determinations [2]. These assays typically
involve collecting the clinical specimen usually with nasopharyngeal swabs, extracting the RNA
from the sample and analyzing the presence of the viral RNA through RT-qPCR.
Nowadays, the RNA extraction step is considered a bottleneck of SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR
determinations [3]. This procedure can be automatized but commercial extraction robots are very
expensive and may not be affordable for most clinical labs in low-income countries. In contrast,
manual RNA-extraction is a quite cumbersome procedure that includes several washing and
centrifuging steps at a Biosafety level 2 laboratory and relatively expensive extraction kits. In
Argentina, a trained lab technician processes approximately 24 samples every 1.5 hours.
Additionally, the skyrocketing increment on the clinical use of RT-qPCR due to the COVID-19
pandemic led to a worldwide shortage of RNA purification reagents [4, 5] thus, many research
groups around the world have concentrated their efforts on either simplifying or eliminating the
extraction step [6-16].
Björn Reinius at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden [17] optimized an extraction-free sample
preparation protocol that only includes a very simple heat-inactivation step at 95°C during 5 min
(HID method). Through HID RT-qPCR, they were able to detect with high sensitivity the relatively
short N1 and N2 regions of the viral RNA which are preserved after the heating step. This group
also performed an exhaustive analysis of media formulation compatible with the HID method [17].

More recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has approved a similar
thermal-inactivation protocol (1 min at 95°C) that can be used with Quantabio UltraPlex 1-Step
ToughMix (4X) and is sufficient for viral inactivation [18]. This protocol also detects N1 and N2
sequences of the viral RNA.
Many protocols traditionally used for extraction-free preparation of clinical samples included
treatments with proteinase-K (PK), a commonly used protease that degrade RNases and hence, it
helps to preserve RNA integrity[19, 20]. A recent work suggested that PK may facilitate extractionfree determinations of SARS-CoV-2 although a major loss in sensitivity with a 6-units shift in CT
values on the determination of the envelope (E) gene [21] may prevent its uses in clinical analysis.
Other recent preprint [22] tested a protocol based on PK and heat inactivation using a reduced
number of samples (N=17) in UTM medium with relative low CT values, and claim a good
sensitivity on the determination of the E gene. Although these results might seem contradictory
with recent findings showing suboptimal detection of the E amplicon on HID samples in UTM
medium[17], the efficiency of the PCR is very dependent on the detection kit, transport medium
brand, thermocycler, etc.
Here, we combined these strategies and optimized the PK+HID method, a very simple protocol for
extraction-free RT-qPCR determinations of SARS-CoV-2. Our results position PK+HID as an
inexpensive, versatile and reliable alternative to bypass the traditional RNA extraction procedure
and suggest that it could substantially contribute to improve the testing capacity in countries with
limited resources and facilities.

Materials and Methods
Sample collection. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected during screening of non-hospitalized
symptomatic cases and close contacts to these cases at diverse hospital and clinical centers at the
Buenos Aires area (AMBA, Área Metropolitana de Buenos Aires), Argentina. Swabs were deposited
in 2-5 ml of saline solution. These clinical samples were processed at the Instituto de
Investigaciones Biomédicas en Retrovirus y SIDA (INBIRS, Buenos Aires, Argentina), a specialized
center currently dedicated to SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis by RT-qPCR. For routine diagnosis, RNA
extraction was performed from 300 µl of swab samples using a Chemagic 360-D (Perkin-Elmer), an
automated extraction equipment, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This procedure
does not include an RNA-concentration step.

This study used the remaining volume of anonymized samples that had been collected for clinical
diagnosis. Under these circumstances, and for studies involving development of COVID-19
diagnostic tools, our IRB (the Research Ethics Committee from Fundación Huésped in Buenos Aires,
Argentina) deemed unnecessary to obtain informed consent from the patients.
PK+HID sample preparation. Nasopharyngeal swabs deposited in 2-5 ml of saline solution were
maintained up to 24 h at 4°C. PK+HID samples were prepared 10-24 h after RNA extraction unless
indicated otherwise. 10 µl of a solution 10 mg/ml Proteinase K (Promega, Madison, WI, USA or
Inbio Highway, Tandil, Argentina in FlashPrep solution of Inbio Highway) were placed in 0.2 ml PCR
tubes. Then, 90 µl of the nasopharyngeal swabs samples previously vortexed were transferred to
each of these PCR tubes. Please, notice that the PK solution should be added to the tubes before
transferring the samples and not the other way around. This procedure minimizes the work-hazard
since tubes with samples are not reopen until inactivated. It also provides flexibility in the
workload of clinical labs because the preparation of PCR tubes with PK solution could be done
outside the Biosafety Level 2 facility in a clean, nucleic acid-free area.
For experiments with variable PK concentrations, 10 µl of PK stock solutions with the adequate
concentration were added. Samples were incubated at 55°C for 15 min and then at 98°C for 5 min in
a thermal cycler with heated lid. Finally, inactivated samples were cooled to 4°C and kept at this
temperature until RT-qPCR analysis.
RT-qPCR. One-step reverse transcription and qPCR of N1 and N2 viral regions were performed
using the GoTaq® Probe 1-Step RT-qPCR System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and the 2019-nCoV
CDC Diagnostic Panel (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. The N1 and N2 viral regions and the human RP (internal control) were
detected in singleplex 20 µl-volume reactions using 5 µl of purified RNA or 5 µl of PK+HID samples
unless specifically stated in the text. Thermal cycling steps were: 45°C for 15 min, 95°C for 2 min,
and 45 cycles of 95°C for 3 s and 55°C for 30 s. RT-qPCR was performed on a StepOnePlus RealTime PCR System (Applied Biosystems).
One-step reverse transcription and qPCR of N and ORF1ab viral genes were performed following
routine diagnostics procedures at INBIRS using the DisCoVery SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Detection Kit
(Safecare Biotech Hangzhou, China) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The N and ORF1ab
viral regions and the human RP internal control were detected in multiplex reactions. Thermal
cycling steps were: 50°C for 5 min, 95°C for 30 s, and 45 cycles of 95°C for 5 s and 60°C for 34 s. RTqPCR was performed on a CFX96 Real-Time System.

One-step reverse transcription and qPCR of N, E and RdRp viral genes were performed following
routine diagnostics procedures at INBIRS using the GeneFinderTM COVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit
(Gene Finder, Korea) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The N, E, RdRp viral regions and the
human RP internal control were detected in multiplex reactions. Thermal cycling steps were: 50°C
for 20 min, 95°C for 5 min, and 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 58°C for 1 min. RT-qPCR was
performed on a CFX96 Real-Time System (BioRad).
Infectivity assays. Vero E6 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/ streptomycin, 0.5 mg/ml Amphotericin
B and 1% L-glutamine (all from Gibco). Cells were seeded on a 24-well plate at 3.5 × 105 cells/ml
one day prior to infection. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were diluted 1:2 in DMEM, filtered
through a 0.22 mm-pore-filter and added to cell cultures for 1 h. Then, cultures were washed and
incubated for 3 days. When the cultures showed cytopathic effects, the supernatant was collected
for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR, and the culture was terminated. In the absence of
cytopathic effects, the supernatant was passed to a new culture. When no cytopathic effect was
observed after the 3rd passage, the supernatant was collected for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RTqPCR. All infection experiments were conducted in a biosafety level 3 laboratory.
Loop-mediated isothermal amplification. Reverse transcription, isothermal amplification of the
viral genes ORF1a, ORF1b, N and E, and colorimetric detection were performed with COVID-19
Neokit Tecnoami (Neokit S.A.S., Buenos Aires, Argentina), according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, reactions were performed in 0.2 ml PCR tubes mixing 35 µl of reagent and 8 µl of the
nasopharyngeal samples. The reactions were run in a thermal cycler with heated lid at 64°C for 1 h.
Diagnostics was made according to final color of the solution (violet, negative; blue, positive, S1
Fig).
Data analysis. qPCR amplification curves obtained in those experiments using DisCoVery and
GeneFinder detection kits were analyzed with the CFX Manager software (BioRad) to obtain CT
values. Data obtained with 2019-nCoV CDC were analyzed with the free software LinRegPCR [23]
to obtain CT values. This software was also used to calculate PCR efficiencies and the initial amount
of template copies (in arbitrary units).

Results
The treatment of nasopharyngeal swab samples with proteinase-K (PK) improves the
performance of the heat inactivation protocol
We used a reduced number of SARS-CoV-2 positive (N=6) and negative (N=3) nasopharyngeal swab
samples collected in saline solution to test if their preincubation with PK before the thermal
inactivation step improves the performance of the HID extraction-free method. Although previous
results [17] suggested that saline solution is suboptimal for direct RT-qPCR detection, this is one of
the transport medium recommended by CDC and it is also commonly used to collect clinical
samples in Argentina.
In these experiments, we mixed up 90 μl of the samples with 10 μl of PK 10 mg/ml (final
concentration 1 mg/ml) in 0.2 ml PCR tubes and incubated them in a thermocycler during 15 min at
55°C followed by 5 min at 98°C (PK+HID samples). As controls, we used heat-inactivated aliquots
omitting the preincubation with PK at 55°C (HID samples) and RNA samples obtained through a
standard extraction protocol (purified RNA samples) from the same nasopharyngeal swabs. These
samples were analyzed by RT-qPCR using the 2019-nCoV CDC Diagnostic Panel which detects the
N1 and N2 viral regions and the human RNase P (RP) gene as internal control.
Fig 1a shows that all positive and negative samples were identified using either HID or PK+HID
treatments. As examples, Fig 1b shows representative amplification curves obtained for a positive
PK+HID sample illustrating that the complex matrix of PK+HID samples did not affect the expected
sigmoidal-like shape of the curves. Additionally, the pretreatment with PK consistently resulted in
lower CT values than those obtained with HID samples and closer to those determined with
purified RNA samples (Fig 1a and S1 Table).

The analysis of the amplification curves shows that the PCR efficiency (EPCR) was the lowest for the
HID treatment followed by PK+HID and then by the RNA extraction treatment (Fig 1c). This result
suggests that the PK treatment may contribute to degrade unknown components of the sample
matrix that interfere with RT-qPCR. Additionally, we observed a higher PCR amplification efficiency
for the N1 viral gene compared to N2, in line with previous results [17, 24]. We also analyzed the
amount of amplicon copies in PK+HID relative to that determined in HID samples and observed that
this ratio was higher than 1 for N2 and RP suggesting that PK treatment also protected these RNA
regions from RNase´s action (Fig 1d).
PK+HID involves the addition of the PK buffer and thus a 10 % dilution of the saline medium used
to collect nasopharyngeal swabs. Therefore, we next evaluate if the improvement of PK+HID
treatment compared to heat-inactivation is only due to the dilution of the saline medium. We
analyzed five positive samples processed by the standard PK+HID protocol or by HID but adding to
the samples the same amount of PK buffer without PK (HID´ samples). S2 Fig shows that CT values
for PK+HID samples were lower compared to HID´ samples; the analyses of amplification curves
indicate that nPK+HD was higher than nHID´ supporting that PK contributes with the preservation of
the integrity of the viral RNA. Therefore, the dilution of saline solution could not completely explain
the better performance of PK+HID. Nevertheless, the efficiency of PCR amplification for HID´
samples was slightly lower only for N2 amplicon suggesting that the dilution of saline solution in
PK+HID samples also contributes to increase the efficiency of PCR.
We next tested if using a higher volume of PK+HID samples could improve SARS-CoV-2 detection in
the RT-qPCR determinations. Although the sensitivity of the assay is expected to be higher with
more copies of the viral RNA template, a previous report also suggested that increasing too much
this volume may have the opposite effect due to RT-qPCR inhibitors in the sample matrix [17]. We
observed that the amplification curves shifted to lower cycles when using

instead of

-qPCR determination resulting in lower CT values for the N1 region (0.3 to 1 units, S2
Table). This result suggests that a higher sample volume could contribute to the detection of SARSCoV-2 in samples with low viral titers.
Finally, we tested if the performance of the PK+HID method depends on PK concentration in the
range of 0.1 to 1 mg/ml. Fig 1d shows that CT values obtained for the viral and human amplicons
did not change within this PK concentration range. These values were also lower than those
observed in the absence of PK, confirming the improving role of PK in this extraction-free method.

A comparative RT-qPCR analysis with purified RNA samples shows an efficient detection of
N1 SARS-CoV-2 region in PK+HID samples
We next ran RT-qPCR determinations of SARS-CoV-2 in PK+HID and purified RNA samples
prepared from positive and negative nasopharyngeal swab samples. Based on the results showed in
the previous section, we used 1 mg/ml PK for the PK-

(i.e.

between the volumes assayed in the previous section) in the following RT-qPCR assays. For this
particular experiment, we only analyzed the N1 viral gene and the RP human internal control to
maximize the number of samples loaded in the PCR multiwell plate.
In these experiments, we correctly identified all positive (27/27) and negative (6/6) samples. Fig 2
also shows that the CT values determined for the viral sequence N1 in PK+HID positive samples
strongly correlated with those values measured in purified RNA samples supporting that the
PK+HID treatment robustly preserves the information on the viral loads in the swab specimens.

Fig 2. PK+HID method exhibits a similar performance than RNA extraction in RT-qPCR determinations
of the SARS-CoV-2 N1 gene. Positive nasopharyngeal swab samples were processed for RNA extraction
(purified RNA) or subjected to treatment with PK 1 mg/ml (55 oC for 15 min) followed by heat inactivation at
98oC for 5 min (PK+HID). The viral N1 gene and the human RP gene were amplified and detected by RT-qPCR.
CT values obtained for the same samples prepared by the two different methods (N = 27), the line obtained
by regression of the data (continuous lines) and 95 % confidence bands (pink) are represented. The
parameter values obtained from the fitting were: slope = 1.17 ± 0.05 and intercept = -3.4 ± 1.2 (N1 amplicon);
slope = 1.0 ± 0.1 and intercept = 1.7 ± 3.0 (RP amplicon).

The PK+HID method can be used in combination with different multiplexing RT-qPCR
detection kits allowing the detection of SARS-CoV-2 with high sensitivity and specificity
In the previous sections, we showed that the PK+HID method resulted in an efficient alternative to
bypass RNA extraction when detecting the N1 and N2 regions of the viral RNA. However, most
laboratories use PCR kits that target other viral genes often combined in multiplex setups.
Therefore, we next evaluated if the improved PK+HID method could be used with multiplexing
detections kits.
We first used DisCoVery (Safecare Biotech Hangzhou), a SARS-CoV-2 multiplex RT-qPCR detection
kit that targets the SARS-CoV-2 genes N and ORF1ab and human RNase P gene. Relevantly, many
worldwide providers offer detection kits targeting one or both of these genes.
Fig 3 shows that the PK+HID treatment of the samples allows the detection of viral and internal
control genes. In the case of viral amplicons, the CT values obtained with PK+HID samples linearly
correlated with those obtained with purified RNA samples. The slopes for both N and ORF1ab were
1 and the y-intercepts were 0 suggesting that these sequences are detected equally well in
samples prepared with the PK+HID method or through RNA extraction. This observation is also
valid for samples with relatively high CT values (>35) indicating that weak positive samples are still
detected with the PK+HID method.

We correctly identified 44/46 positive and 3/3 negative samples. S2 Table compiles the CT values
of the false-negative samples (see Discussion). Additionally, the internal control (IC) of two other
PK+HID samples was not detected making mandatory repeating the assay; these invalid samples
were not included in S3 Table. We determined the amplification efficiency of the viral regions N and
ORF1ab and the human gene RP and found that these values were similar for PK+HID and purified
RNA samples (Fig 3b). We also compared the amplification curves obtained using this detection kit
and swab samples that were either treated by HID or PK+HID or subjected to the RNA extraction
procedure (S3 Fig). PK treatment lowered the CT values in comparison to those obtained with HID
only, with a mean + SEM difference in CT values of 2.7 + 0.7 (N), 3.1 + 1.0 (ORF1ab) and 1.4 + 0.2
(RP). These results, obtained with a different detection kit, agree with those showed in Fig 1 also
supporting that the PK treatment improves the performance of the heat-inactivation method.
The work of Reinius and colleagues [17] confirmed the virus inactivation after HID treatment. As a
control, we also run infectivity assays as described in Materials and Methods using 4
nasopharyingeal swab samples with relatively high viral loads (CT values 22.11; 21.32; 22.74 and
19.18 for N amplicon). After the 3rd passage of cell culture, we did not verify any cytopathic effect
and the viral RNA was not detected by RT-qPCR showing that the PK+HID treatment also
inactivates the virus.
We also analyzed if PK+HID samples can be preserved at 4°C since this could be a common practice
in clinical labs. We processed nasopharyngeal samples using the PK+HID treatment and run RTqPCR determinations after different incubation times at 4°C (0, 20 and 40 h). S4 Fig shows that the
CT values for N and ORF1ab genes did not change during the first 20 h and increased at the longest
incubation time suggesting that PK+HID samples can be conserved at 4°C for up to 20 h.
A common practice in many clinical labs involves freezing/thawing reagents several times.
Therefore, we tested if repeated cycles of freezing/thawing of the PK stock solution may affect the
performance of PK+HID. To address this issue, we processed 10 positive samples by PK+HID using
a PK solution that was previously subjected to 10 cycles of freezing/thawing or a PK solution
thawed only once. The mean differences in CT values between these samples were 0.17 + 0.15 (N),
-0.05 + 0.20 (ORF1ab) and 0.01 + 0.14 (RP) (Ndata = 10) showing that the PK stock solution is stable
for up to 10 cycles of freezing/thawing.
To analyze if the PK+HID method can be combined with other multiplexing kits, we prepared
PK+HD and purified RNA samples from 94 randomly-selected clinical specimens and ran RT-qPCR

determinations using the GeneFinder detection kit which amplifies N, E and RdRp regions of the
viral RNA and the human RP gene as internal control.
The analysis of CT values measured in PK+HID and RNA samples showed stronger correlations for
the N amplicon in comparison to E and RdRp amplicons (Fig 4a). Additionally, some of the Npositive RNA samples (also considered SARS-CoV-2 positive in clinical diagnosis [24]) showed
negative results for the E and RdRp amplicons (3/38 and 4/38, respectively); this difference
increased in PK+HID samples with 8 more samples showing negative results for both amplicons
while being N-positive. As mentioned above, other authors also reported a poor detection and large
right-shifts in CT values for E amplicon in extraction-free samples [17].

Fig. 4. Performance of PK+HID method in RT-qPCR determinations of the SARS-CoV-2 N, RdRp and E
genes in randomly-selected clinical specimens. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were processed for RNA
extraction (purified RNA) or subjected to treatment with PK 1 mg/ml (55 oC for 15 min) followed by heatinactivation at 98oC for 5 min (PK+HID). The viral N, E and, RdRp genes and the human RP gene were
amplified and detected by RT-qPCR. (a) CT values obtained for the same samples prepared by the two
different methods, the line obtained by regression of the data (continuous lines) and 95 % confidence bands
(pink) are represented. RP plot also includes the data obtained in SARS-CoV-2 negative samples and spans a
smaller CT range. The parameter values obtained from the fitting were: slope = 1.2 ± 0.1 and intercept = -5 ±
3 (N amplicon); slope = 0.7 ± 0.2 and intercept = 9 ±4 (RdRp amplicon); slope = 0.7 ± 0.1 and intercept = 7 ± 3
(E amplicon) and slope = 0.4 ± 0.1 and intercept = 16 ± 3 (RP amplicon). (b) Amplification efficiencies
obtained in PK+HID samples (EPK+HID) relative to the corresponding purified RNA samples (E purified RNA). The
mean values obtained for Epurified RNA were: 1.94 ± 0.02 (N), 1.97 ± 0.02 (RdRp), 1.93 ± 0.03 (E) and 1.90 ± 0.03
(RP). The median of each measurement is represented with a line in the bars and the lengths of these bars
represent the standard error (N = 8).

We also observed that the amplification efficiency of viral amplicons N, E and RdRp was similar for
PK+HID and purified RNA samples whereas EPCR of the internal control RP was slightly lower for
PK+HID samples (Fig 4b). These results support that the PK+HID treatment contributes to
inactivate inhibitors of the PCR reaction.
To quantitatively analyze the performance of the PK+HID treatment combined with the use of
GeneFinder kit, we estimated the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of detection as previously
described[25] obtaining values of 0.95, 0.92 ± 0.05 and 0.96 ± 0.04, respectively.
In the validation assay described above, swab samples were first analyzed by the usual RT-qPCR
procedure including the RNA extraction step; 10 to 24 h later, we processed the same
nasopharyngeal swabs by PK+HID. Therefore, we asked if the extra-time that swab samples remain
at 4 C could lead to a partial degradation of viral RNA and consequently, to an apparently lower
sensitivity of the PK+HID method. To test this hypothesis, we performed the validation experiment
running simultaneously the RNA extraction and PK-HID procedures using 106 positive and 106
negative randomly-selected samples and analyzed the RNA and PK+HID samples by RT-qPCR with
the detection kit DisCoVery (S5 Fig); unfortunately, we could not run these experiments with the
GeneFinder detection kit used above because the provider run out of stock during the pandemic
outbreak. The analyses of the data showed that the accuracy was 0,990 and the sensitivity and

specificity were both 0.99 ± 0.01. These results strongly support that PK+HID is a reliable protocol
for extraction-free RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2 determinations.
In this last validation assay, we also analyzed the amplification curves of positive samples with
relatively low viral loads (CT values >30) to estimate the relative amount of viral amplicon copies in
the PK+HID and RNA samples volumes used in the RT-qPCR determination. S5 Fig shows that the
relative amount of viral N and ORF1ab amplicons were in the same order in PK+HID vs RNA
samples; particularly, the mean ratio nPK+HID/nRNA was 0.7 ± 0.2 (N) and 1.7 ± 0.6 (ORF1ab). This
result suggests a similar performance of PK+HID or RNA extraction combined with this detection
kit.
Finally, we asked whether PK+HID could be combined with SARS-CoV-2 loop-mediated isothermal
amplification kits since they are now widely used in many countries because their simplicity and
associated lower costs. S1 Fig includes some examples of positive and negative results obtained
with this kit. We could detect 29/29 and 5/6 positive and negative samples, respectively suggesting
that PK+HID could be combined with these type of detection kits.

Discussion
The gold standard method for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab samples is RTqPCR, a technique with exquisite sensitivity and high specificity commonly applied to analyze
purified RNA samples.
The RNA extraction step has nowadays become the bottleneck in COVID-19 testing, especially
during pandemic outbreaks when personnel, resources and biosafety compatible facilities to
perform the testing are scarce.
The fast evolution of COVID-19 pandemic and the necessity of performing massive and rapid RTqPCR determinations to test, trace and isolate SARS-CoV-2 positive patients encouraged the
scientific community to evaluate alternative methods to bypass the laborious RNA extraction step.
We mentioned above heat inactivation methods that make use of a fast thermal-treatment of the
samples and allow the identification of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples targeting N1 and N2 viral
genes [17]. These results are consistent with other works that also tested the performance of heatinactivated respiratory samples in RT-qPCR assays [8, 11, 26-29].

Here, we combined heat inactivation with a pretreatment with PK, protease routinely used in
nucleic acid preparations and thus widely available in most clinical laboratories. We mentioned
previous works using PK to treat nasopharyngeal swab samples; the protease is also starting to be
used in the analysis of saliva samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in extraction-free RT-qPCR
determinations [21, 22, 30, 31].
In line with these reports, our data shows that preincubation with PK improves the performance of
the heat-inactivation protocol in RT-qPCR assays targeting N1 and N2 viral genes with the 2019nCoV CDC Diagnostic Panel. However, a validation with a larger number of samples should be done
to compare the sensitivities of both methods. We verified that the performance of the PK+HID does
not depend on PK concentration in the range of 0.1 – 1 mg/ml; this robustness of the PK+HID
method is appealing since small variations in the PK concentration will not significantly affect the
results of SARS-CoV-2 determinations and also allows reducing even more the costs of sample
preparation for RT-qPCR assays.
Using the 2019-nCoV CDC Diagnostic Panel, we could correctly identify the SARS-CoV-2 positive
and negative analyzed samples and, for the positive samples, we obtained CT values in PK+HID
samples very close to those of purified RNAs (2.7 units for N1) whereas heat inactivation without
PK treatment produces higher shifts in CTs (5 units for N1).
Remarkably, we demonstrated that the PK+HID method could be used in combination with other
RT-qPCR kits that target different viral genes in multiplex RT-qPCR reactions. Specifically, we used
DisCoVery (targeting N and ORF1ab genes) and Genefinder (targeting N, E and RdRp genes). The
detection of these genes was unexpected since the HID method did not provide satisfactory results
in the detection of larger amplicons [17]. We found that CT values of both N and ORF1ab viral
amplicons detected with DisCoVery were similar to those measured for the purified RNA samples,
in line with our observations with the CDC kit.
Although the detection of the E and RdRp genes with the Genefinder kit was weaker than the
detection of the N gene, the relatively high detection sensitivity of the PK+HID method estimated
from the analysis of 94 randomly selected samples suggests that the PK+HID method can be used as
an alternative, extraction-free RT-qPCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swab samples in clinical
diagnostics.

S3 Table compiles the CT values of all false-negative samples collected during the course of our
work. Most of these samples show high CT values suggesting that they correspond to swab samples
with relatively low viral loads.
We should emphasize that the success of an extraction-free method strongly depends on the correct
combination of transport medium and detection kit. Merindol et al [32] found that saline solution
swab medium impaired the performance of the AllplexTM 2019-nCoV Assay. Although, in our
hands, saline solution swab medium could be used with 2019-nCoV CDC, GeneFinderTM COVID-19
Plus RealAmp and DisCoVery SARS-CoV-2RT-PCR detection kits. Since the extraction-free protocol
may reduce the efficiency of the PCR, it is critical to select a PCR kit that preserves sensitivity. While
most bibliography, as well as our own findings point to N as the most sensitive viral region, ORF1ab
gene also showed a good performance with our extraction-free protocol.

Conclusions
Our results indicate that the combination of proteinase K preincubation with heat inactivation is a
very robust and reliable procedure for extraction-free RT-qPCR determinations of SARS-CoV-2. We
should mention that preparation of the 94 PK+HID samples required to complete the 96-well PCR
plate (2 wells are needed for the positive and negative controls) takes approximately 60 min by one
operator whereas manual extraction of the same number of samples using commercial kits would
take 5-6 hours of work in a Biosafety Level 2 area with continuous use of a benchtop centrifuge.
Additionally, PK treatment involves an estimated cost of 0.37 USD per sample whereas the cost of
standard RNA extraction procedures is clearly superior (6-10 USD per sample in Argentina). We
should also highlight that the HID method combined with the 2019-nCoV CDC Diagnostic Panel is
an inexpensive option since it does not require extra reagents as PK+HID.
The simplicity and relatively short period of time required for the protocol and the full-availability
and low price of the required reagents place PK+HID as a cheap, simple and fast alternative to
traditional RNA extraction protocols.

S2 Fig. Effect of saline solution dilution in PK+HID method. Five positive nasopharyngeal swab
samples (#1 to #5) were processed by adding 10 µl of proteinase K 10mg/ml (PK+HID samples) or
10 µl in proteinase K buffer (HID’ samples) and subjected to thermal incubations (55°C for 15 min
and 98°C for 5 min). The viral N1 and N2 genes and the human RNase P gene (RP) were amplified
and detected by RT-qPCR. (a) CT values obtained from RT-qPCR analysis of the same samples
prepared by both different methods. (b) Ratio between relative amplicon amounts (n) of PK+HID
and HID’ samples. The median of each measurement is represented with a line in the bars and the
lengths of these bars represent the standard error. (c) Amplification efficiencies (EPCR). The median
of each measurement is represented with a line in the bars and the lengths of these bars represent
the standard error.

S3 Fig. Performances of HID and PK+HID methods targeting N and ORF1ab amplicons. Twelve
positive nasopharyngeal swab samples (#1 to #12) were processed by heat inactivation (HID
samples), proteinase K treatment followed by heat inactivation (PK+HID samples) or RNA
extraction (purified RNA samples). The viral N and ORF1ab genes and the human RNase P gene
(RP) were amplified and detected by RT-qPCR. CT values obtained from RT-qPCR analysis of the
same samples prepared by the three different methods.

S4 Fig. Stability of PK+HID samples at 4°C. Ten positive nasopharyngeal swab samples were
processed by PK treatment followed by heat inactivation. These PK+HID samples were kept at 4°C.
The viral N and ORF1ab genes and the human RNase P gene (RP) were amplified and detected by
RT-qPCR at different times of incubation at 4°C (0, 20 and 40 h). Differences between CT values
obtained at different times and time = 0 h. Thin, light lines represent individual sample
measurements. Strong lines represent mean + SEM values.

S5 Fig. Performance of PK+HID method targeting N and ORF1ab amplicons. Randomlyselected nasopharyngeal swab samples were simultaneously processed for RNA extraction
(purified RNA) or subjected to treatment with PK 1 mg/ml (55°C for 15 min) followed by heatinactivation at 98°C for 5 min (PK+HID). The viral N and ORF1ab genes and the human RP gene
were amplified and detected by RT-qPCR. (a) CT values obtained for the same samples prepared by
the two different methods; the line obtained by regression of the data (continuous lines). RP plot
also includes the data obtained in SARS-CoV-2 negative samples whereas N and ORF1ab plots
include those data of negative samples that provided CT values above the positive-negative cut-off.
(b) Ratio between the relative amplicon copy amounts detected using PK+HID or RNA purification
for those nasopharyngeal swab samples that presented CT values >30 for any of the viral genes in
purified RNA samples (Ndata =10 and 12 for N and ORF1ab genes, respectively).
