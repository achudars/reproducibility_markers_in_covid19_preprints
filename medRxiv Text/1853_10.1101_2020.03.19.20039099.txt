serious. We developed and validated a diagnosis aid model without computed tomography (CT)

2

images for early identification of suspected COVID-19 pneumonia (S-COVID-19-P) on

3

admission in adult fever patients and made the validated model available via an online triage

4

calculator.

5

Methods: Patients admitted from Jan 14 to February 26, 2020 with the epidemiological history

6

of exposure to COVID-19 were included [Model development (n = 132) and validation (n = 32)].

7

Candidate features included clinical symptoms, routine laboratory tests, and other clinical

8

information on admission. Features selection and model development were based on the least

9

absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The primary outcome was the

10

development and validation of a diagnostic aid model for S-COVID-19-P early identification on

11

admission.

12

Results: The development cohort contained 26 S-COVID-19-P and 7 confirmed COVID-19

13

pneumonia cases. The final selected features included 1 variable of demographic information, 4

14

variables of vital signs, 5 variables of blood routine values, 7 variables of clinical signs and

15

symptoms, and 1 infection-related biomarker. The model performance in the testing set and the

16

validation cohort resulted in the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves

17

(AUCs) of 0.841 and 0.938, the F-1 score of 0.571 and 0.667, the recall of 1.000 and 1.000, the

18

specificity of 0.727 and 0.778, and the precision of 0.400 and 0.500. The top 5 most important

19

features were Age, IL-6, SYS_BP, MONO%, and Fever classification. Based on this model, an

20

optimized strategy for S-COVID-19-P early identification in fever clinics has also been designed.

21

Conclusions: S-COVID-19-P could be identified early by a machine-learning model only used

22

collected clinical information without CT images on admission in fever clinics with a 100%

1

Since December 2019, the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19; previously

2

known as 2019-nCoV) (1), which causes severe pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome (2-5).

3

Until February 29th, 2020, the total reported confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (C-COVID-19-P)

4

cases have reached 85,403, including 79,394 in China and 6,009 in other countries, and the

5

number of cases is increasing rapidly and internationally (6, 7).

6

The main reason for the outbreak of infected cases in the early stage of the epidemic was

7

the inability to rapidly and effectively detect such a large number of suspected cases(8). Outside

8

Hubei Province, such as Beijing, with a large population, sporadic and clustered cases have

9

continuously been reported. Some other countries and regions, prominently in South Korea,

10

Japan, Iran, etc., are reporting more and more confirmed cases (4, 6, 9, 10). Currently, epidemic

11

prevention and control outside Hubei province and other countries have become more and more

12

critically serious. Therefore, establishing an early identification method of suspected COVID-19

13

pneumonia (S-COVID-19-P) and optimizing triage strategies for fever clinics is urgent and

14

essential for the coming global challenge.

15

The identification of S-COVID-19-P relies on the following criteria: the epidemiological

16

history, clinical signs and symptoms, routine laboratory tests (such as lymphopenia), and positive

17

Chest computerized tomography (CT) findings(3). However, clinical symptoms and routine

18

laboratory tests are sometimes non-specific(2, 3). Although CT is becoming a major diagnostic

19

tool help for early screening of S-COVID-19-P, the resources of the designated CT room were

20

relatively limited, especially in less-developed regions and when the influx of patients

21

substantially outweighed the medical service capacities in fever clinics(11, 12). Moreover, not all

22

patients with clinical symptoms or abnormal blood routine values need CT examination, except

23

radiation injury, high cost, and other restrictions. Therefore, it is critical to integrate and take the

1

advantages of clinical signs and symptoms, routine laboratory tests, and other clinical

2

information on admission before further CT examination, which would strengthen the ability of

3

early identification of S-COVID-19-P, improve the triage strategies in fever clinics and make a

4

balance between standard medical principles and limited medical resources.

5

The increase of secondary analysis in the emergency departments and intensive care units

6

has given feasibility to get ‘real-time’ data from the electronic medical records, thus making

7

them enable for ‘real world’ research (13, 14). This term pertains to machine-learning algorithms

8

to analyze specific clinical cohorts and develop models for diagnosis aid or decision support in

9

emergent triage(15). Such models could be a cost-effective assisting tool to integrate clinical

10

signs and symptoms, blood routine values, and infection-related biomarkers on admission for S-

11

COVID-19-P early identification(16-18).

12

The aim of this study was the development and validation of a diagnostic aid model on

13

admission without CT images for early identification of S-COVID-19-P in adult fever patients

14

with the epidemiological history of exposure to COVID-19. The model performance was also

15

compared to some infection-related biomarkers on admission in the general population admitted

16

to the fever clinic. The well-performed model is available as an online triage calculator, and

17

based on it, the optimized strategy for S-COVID-19-P early identification in fever clinics has

18

also been discussed. We present the following article in accordance with the STROBE reporting

(NO.: 2020-094 the registration number of ethics board). This study was based on the

2

retrospective and secondary analysis of the clinical data. Medical records collection was passive

3

and had no impact on patient safety. Studies performed on de-identified data constitute non-

4

human subject research, thus no informed consent was required for this study. The authors are

accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or

6

integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.

7

Study design and population: development and validation cohorts

8

We developed a novel diagnosis aid model for early identification S-COVID-19-P based on

9

the retrospective analysis of a single-center study. All patients admitted to the fever clinic of the

10

emergency department of the First medical center, Chinese People's Liberation Army General

11

Hospital (PLAGH) in Beijing with the epidemiological history of exposure to COVID-19

12

according to WHO interim guidance was enrolled in this study. The fever clinic is a department

13

for adults (i.e., aged ≥14 years) specializing in the identification of infectious diseases, especially

14

for S-COVID-19-P. We recruited patients from Jan 14 to Feb 9, 2020, as a model development

15

cohort. Meanwhile, we also recruited patients from Feb 10 to Feb 26, 2020, as a dataset for

16

model validation.

17

The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (as revised in

18

2013). Data collection was passive and had no impact on patient safety. Studies performed on

19

de-identified data constitute non-human subject research, thus no institutional or ethical

20

approvals were required for this study.

21

The definition of S-COVID-19-P

22

All recruited patients on admission were given vital signs, blood routine, infection-related

23

biomarkers, influenza viruses (A+B), and chest CT examination. The patients who have the

epidemiological history and CT imaging characteristics of viral pneumonia and any other one of

2

the following two clinical signs were diagnosed as S-COVID-19-P, which according to the

3

“Guidelines for diagnosis and management of novel coronavirus pneumonia (The sixth Edition)”

4

published by Chinese National Health and Health Commission on Feb 18, 2020 (6th-Guidelines-

5

CNHHC). The two clinical signs including 1) Fever and/or respiratory symptoms; 2) Total count

6

of leukocyte was normal or decreased, or lymphopenia (<1.0× 10⁹/L).

7

The definition of C-COVID-19-P

8

Throat swab specimens from the upper respiratory tract were obtained from all patients on

9

admission and then maintained in the viral-transport medium. Those with positive results were

10

clinically identified as C-COVID-19-P(3). Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection was

11

done in four different institutions: the PLAGH, the Haidian District Disease Control and

12

Prevention (CDC) of Beijing, the Beijing CDC, and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences.

13

COVID-19 infection was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR using the same protocol described

14

previously(2). RT-PCR detection reagents were provided by the four institutions.

15

Data extraction

16

All data of each patient were extracted on admission, which included demographic

17

information, comorbidities, epidemiological history of exposure to COVID-19, vital sign, blood

18

routine values, clinical symptoms, infection-related biomarkers, influenza viruses (A+B) test, CT

19

findings, and days of illness onset to the first admission. All data were checked and missing data

20

were obtained through direct communication with the other two attending doctors (XC and YZ).

21

Outcomes

22

The primary outcome is the development and validation of a diagnostic aid model for S-

23

COVID-19-P early identification on admission. The secondary outcome is the comparison of the

diagnostic performance between the diagnosis aid model and infection-related biomarkers on

2

admission.

3

Diagnosis aid model and candidate features

4

For early identification of S-COVID-19-P on admission, a diagnostic aid model that only

5

used clinical information and based on the availability of patients’

medical records was

6

developed. We included following candidate features: 1) 2 variables of demographic information

7

(e.g., age and gender); 2) 4 variables of vital signs (e.g., temperature, heart rate, etc.); 3) 20

8

variables with blood routine values (e.g., white blood cell count, red blood cell count,

9

hemoglobin, hematocrit, etc.); 4) 17 variables of clinical signs and symptoms [e.g., fever, fever

℃，normal: <= 37.0, mild fever: 37.1-38.0, moderate fever: 38.1-39.0, severe

10

classification (

11

fever: >=39.1), cough, muscle ache, etc.]; 5) 2 infection-related biomarkers (e.g., C-reactive

12

protein and Interleukin-6); 6) 1 other variable: days from illness onset to first admission (DOA).

13

The complete candidate features list is shown in Table 1.

14

Features selection and model development

15

Candidate features were selected based on expert opinion and availability of the medical

16

records. For the model, we compared 4 different algorithms: 1) logistic regression with the least

17

absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), 2) logistic regression with Ridge

18

regularization, 3) decision tree, 4) Adaboost algorithms, and found that logistic regression with

19

LASSO achieved overall best performances in both the testing set and external validation set in

20

terms of AUC and recall score (Table S1). Features selection and model development were

21

performed in the development cohort only and using logistic regression with LASSO

22

regularization (LASSO regression) which is one of the models that shrinks some regression

23

coefficients toward zero, thereby effectively select important features and improve the

1

interpretability of the model(19). The feature selection and model development were performed

2

in Python 3.7. During the model training, we randomly held out 20% of the cohort data as a

3

testing set and then used 10-fold cross-validation to yield the optimal of the LASSO

4

regularization parameter in the training and validation sets. All features were normalized to

5

standard uniform distribution according to the training and validation sets and then this

6

transformation was applied to both the held-out testing set as well as the external validation set.

7

All computations were achieved by scikit-learn (version: 0.22.1) in python. Random

8

oversampling was performed to construct balanced data on training and validation sets by using

9

the imblearn python package (version 0.6.2).

10

Model validation

11

After model development, we used the cohort with the epidemiological history from

12

February 10 to February 26, 2020, for model validation. The model validation was also

13

performed in python.

14

Features Importance Ranking

15

Feature importance was performed in the development cohort. The associated coefficient

16

weights corresponding to the logistic regression model were used to identify and rank the feature

17

importance.

18

Comparison of diagnostic performance among diagnosis aid model and infection-related

19

biomarkers

20

Lymphocyte count (LYMPH#), C-reactive protein (CRP), and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) were

21

evaluated on admission. Lymphopenia (<1.0×109/L) was one of the three diagnostic criteria for

22

S-COVID-19-P according to the 6th-Guidelines-CNHHC. Elevated CRP (>0.8 mg/L) and

23

elevated IL-6 (>5.9 pg/ml) were both important infection-related biomarkers. The diagnostic

performance among the diagnosis aid model and biomarkers for early identifying S-COVID-19-

2

P was also compared.

The entire workflow is shown in Figure 1.

4

Statistical Analysis and Performance Evaluation

5

Continuous variables were expressed as median with interquartile range (IQR) and

6

compared with the Mann-Whitney U test; categorical variables were expressed as absolute (n)

7

and relative (%) frequency and compared by χ² test or Fisher’s exact test. A two-sided α of less

8

than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed by R version

9

3.5.1.

10

Model performance was evaluated by 1) the area under the receiver operating characteristic

11

(ROC) curve (AUC) (20), 2) F-1 score, 3) Precision, 4) Sensitivity (Recall), 5) Specificity. AUC,

12

ranging from 0 to 1, the higher the better, indicates the algorithm’s performances. Precision is the

13

fraction of true positive classification among the positive results classified by the algorithm;

14

higher accuracy indicates that the result of the algorithm is reliable. The Recall is the fraction of

15

true positive classification among all the true samples, which describes the ability to identify true

16

samples (S-COVID-19-P) among the whole population. F1 score is the harmonic average of

17

precision and recall, and a higher F1 score indicates better performance. In this study, to avoid

18

missed suspected cases, recall is the most important reference(21). We considered the model

19

with AUC above 0.80 and recall above 0.95 as the adequate and well-performed model.

clinically identified as S-COVID-19-P according to the 6th-Guidelines-CNHHC and 7 patients

2

out of them were further identified as C-COVID-19-P in Beijing. 10 (38.5%) out of 26 S-

3

COVID-19-P cases were transferred to the CDC after the first laboratory confirmation of

4

COVID-19 infection by PLAGH. The left 16 (61.5%) S-COVID-19-P cases were kept

5

hospitalizing for quarantine and further laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection. The 7

6

C-COVID-19-P cases all belonged to moderate type based on the 6th-Guidelines-CNHHC, no

7

ICU admission, no death occurred, and no excluded patients. (Table 2)

8

These S-COVID-19-P cases with a median age of 39.5 (36.3-52.3), 17 (65.4%) were male

9

and the median days of DOA were 2.5 (1.0-4.8). Non-suspected COVID-19 pneumonia (N-S-

10

COVID-19-P) cases with a median age of 33.0 (28.0-40.0), 57 (53.8%) were male and the

11

median days of DOA were 2.0 (1.0-5.0). C-COVID-19-P cases with a median age of 39.0 (37.0-

12

41.5), 5 (71.4%) were male and the median days of DOA were 5.0 (3.5-5.5). (Table 2)

13

Within 14 days before the onset of the disease, there were 3 (11.5%), 7 (6.6%) and 2 (28.6%)

14

patients had a history of contact with COVID-19 infected patients (laboratory-confirmed

15

infection) in suspected, non-suspected, and confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia cases, respectively.

16

On admission, the median heart rate [107.5 (100.0-116.2) vs 99.5 (89.5-110.0), p=0.035],

17

diastolic blood pressure [89.5 (80.5-96.3) vs 81.0 (75.0-88.0), p=0.014], systolic blood pressure

18

[145.5 (136.2-156.8) vs 134.0 (124.0-143.0), p<0.001] and the highest temperature [37.9 (37.4-

19

38.5) vs 37.4 (36.8-37.8), p=0.006] were much higher in S-COVID-19-P cases than in N-S-

20

COVID-19-P cases. (Table 2)

21

The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever [23 (88.5%), 70 (66.0%)], sore

and headache 5 (71.4%) were also the most common symptoms besides the fever 6 (85.7%),

2

cough 5 (71.4%), and sore throat 5 (71.4%). (Table 2)

3

The blood routine values of patients on admission showed lymphopenia [lymphocyte count

4

<1·0 × 10⁹/L; 9 (34.6%), 17 (16.0%) and 1 (14.3%)] and elevated monocyte ratio [monocyte

5

ratio > 0.08; 12 (46.2%), 18 (17.0%) and 4 (57.1%)] in S-COVID-19-P, N-S-COVID-19-P and

6

C-COVID-19-P cases, respectively. Early lymphopenia (p=0.051) and the elevated monocyte

7

ratio (p=0.003) were more prominent in S-COVID-19-P than N-S-COVID-19-P cases, but no

8

statistically difference between C-COVID-19-P and non-C-COVID-19-P in S-COVID-19-P

9

cases. The ratio of elevated CRP cases on admission was more in S-COVID-19-P cases than N-

10

S-COVID-19-P cases [13(50.0%) vs 29(27.4%), p=0.035], but no statistical significance between

11

C-COVID-19-P cases and non-C-COVID-19-P in S-COVID-19-P cases [6(85.7%) vs 7(36.8%),

p=0.190]. The ratio of elevated IL-6 cases on admission was also more in S-COVID-19-P cases

13

than N-S-COVID-19-P cases [16(61.5%) vs 34(32.1%), p=0.007], but no statistical significance

14

between C-COVID-19-P cases and non-C-COVID-19-P in S-COVID-19-P cases [6(85.7%) vs

15

10(52.6%), p=0.190]. (Table 3)

16

On admission, 26 (100%) and 10 (9.4%) patients had positive CT findings in S-COVID-19-

17

P and N-S-COVID-19-P cases, respectively. In S-COVID-19-P cases, multiple macular patches

18

and interstitial changes accounted for 53.8% (n=14), and multiple mottling and ground-glass

19

opacity accounted for 8.5% (n=9). Positive CT findings in 11 (42.3%) S-COVID-19-P cases and

20

6 (85.7%) C-COVID-19-P cases were obvious in the extra-pulmonary zone. (Table 3)

Features selection

4

Candidate features and univariable associated with S-COVID-19-P were listed in Table S4

5

from the resulting coefficients of LASSO regularized logistic regression. Therefore, final

6

selected features for model development included: 1) 1 variable of demographic information

7

(age); 2) 4 variables of vital signs [e.g., Temperature (TEM), Heart rate (HR), etc.]; 3) 5

8

variables of blood routine values [e.g., Platelet count (PLT), Monocyte ratio (MONO%),

9

Eosinophil count (EO#), etc.]; 4) 7 variables of clinical signs and symptoms [e.g., Fever, Fever

10

classification, Shiver, etc.]; 5) 1 infection-related biomarkers [Interleukin-6 (IL-6)]. The final

11

selected features list was shown in Table 4.

12

Model performance in development and validation cohort

13

The diagnosis aid model for S-COVID-19-P early identification on admission performed

14

well in both the development and validation cohort according to all evaluation criteria. For the

15

LASSO regularized logistic regression, we introduced the LASSO penalty from C = 0.25 to 7.5

16

with a step size = 0.25 in scikit-learn package and found C = 7.0 achieved optimal performance

17

to the AUC in the validation set. In the held-out testing set, we found AUC = 0.8409, F-1 score =

18

0.5714, precision = 0.4000, recall = 1.0000 and specificity = 0.727. In the validation set, we

19

found AUC = 0.9383, F-1 score = 0.6667, precision = 0.5000, recall = 1.0000 and specificity =

20

0.778. (Table S1)

The comparison of diagnostic performance among the diagnosis aid model and prominently

7

infection-related biomarkers (lymphopenia, elevated CRP, and elevated IL-6) for early

8

identifying S-COVID-19-P in the development cohort was shown in Table 5. The performance

9

of the diagnosis aid model was better than lymphopenia, elevated CRP, and elevated IL-6,

10

respectively, which resulted in AUCs of 0.841, 0.407, 0.613, and 0.599, Recall of 1.0000, 0.346,

11

0.500, and 0.615.

Online Suspected COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis Aid System

13

We made the validated diagnosis aid model by LASSO regularized logistic regression

14

algorithm as the “Suspected COVID-19 pneumonia Diagnosis Aid System” which was publicly

15

available through our online portal at https://intensivecare.shinyapps.io/COVID19/.

Discussion

17

In this retrospective observation, we evaluated the development and validation of a

18

diagnostic aid model based on the machine-learning algorithms and clinical data without CT

19

images for S-COVID-19-P early identification. The clinical data comes from the demographic

20

information, routinely clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests before the further CT

21

examination. Therefore, in fever clinics under the epidemic outbreak, such a diagnosis aid model

22

might improve triage efficiency, optimize the medical service process, and save medical

23

resources.

1

From the results in LASSO regularized logistic regression, though some false alarm may

2

exist, the model can identify 100% of the suspected cases in both the held-out testing set and

3

external validation set. By applying this stringent rule to the clinical diagnosis, it is of our great

4

interest to avoid any missed cases. This suggests that our diagnosis aided system can help

5

doctors decide suspected cases in a highly reliable manner.

6

According to the analysis of features selection and features importance ranking, the

7

univariable from the most demographic information, clinical signs, symptoms, and blood routine

8

values on admission could not show a remarkable association with S-COVID-19-P, which

9

indicated that they may not be informative and increased the difficulty for early identifying S-

10

COVID-19-P with routinely clinical information. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate all the

11

above nonspecific but important features by machine-learning algorithms for secondary analysis

12

and develop cost-effective diagnosis aid models(22, 23).

13

The infection-related biomarkers, most prominently lymphopenia, elevated CRP, and IL-6

14

played a key role in identifying clinical infections. For example, lymphopenia has been included

15

as one of three diagnostic criteria for S-COVID-19-P based on 6th-Guidelines-CNHHC(3, 24,

16

25). In this study, all of these three biomarkers based on the blood routine test on admission

17

could distinguish S-COVID-19-P from the N-S-COVID-19-P well. According to the comparison

18

of diagnostic performance among the diagnosis aid model and these biomarkers, the diagnosis

19

aid model significantly outperformed in AUC and Recall than other biomarkers, which

20

highlighted its potential use for clinical triage. Moreover, we also found that the early elevated

21

monocyte ratio in the development cohort and the early elevated monocyte count could identify

22

S-COVID-19-P from N-S-COVID-19-P well in this study, which suggested that monocyte ratio

16

1

or monocyte count would also be a new potentially infection-related biomarker for S-COVID-

2

19-P early identification(25).

3

Although CT scan has become a major diagnostic tool helping for early screening of S-

4

COVID-19-P cases, it could not meet the needs of all patients when the medical resources are

5

insufficient in the epidemic outbreak. From the result of CT findings in the development and

6

validation cohort, there were only 10 (9.4%) and 4 (14.8%) N-S-COVID-19-P cases have mild

7

CT findings on admission, which indicated that the triage strategies for CT scans mainly based

8

on fever or lymphopenia need to be further optimized (26). Therefore, it is meaningful to use

9

machine-learning algorithms to comprehensively analyze clinical symptoms, routine laboratory

10

tests, and other clinical information before further CT examination and develop a diagnosis aid

11

model to improve the triage strategies in fever clinics, which would make a good balance

12

between standard medical principles and limited medical resources.

13

The developed and validated model performances confirmed that the early identification of

14

S-COVID-19-P in fever clinics could be accurately triaged based only on clinical information

15

without CT images on admission. After feature selection, the final developed model based on

16

fewer predictors could perform well according to most evaluation criteria and also have a better

17

result in further validation. Therefore, the final model based on a small number of features would

18

be likely applicable in most fever clinics.

19

One of the most effective strategies to control the epidemic outbreak was the establishment

20

of an efficient triaging process for early identification S-COVID-19-P in fever clinics(26). Based

21

on our successful experience in Beijing and well-performed ‘Suspected COVID-19 Pneumonia

22

Diagnosis Aid System’, we have designed the following improved S-COVID-19-P early

23

identification strategies in adult fever clinics (Figure 3). All patients with fever, sore throat, or

17

1

cough, whether there is hypoxia or not, we proposed routinely take the measurements of blood

2

routine, CRP, IL-6, and influenza virus (A+B) test. Then, if the results of the above tests are

3

normal and the patient without any epidemiological history, home quarantine, regular treatment

4

(such as oral antibiotics), and continuous monitoring clinical signs and symptoms are suggested.

5

If not, a rapid and artificial intelligence assisted evaluation of all clinical results will be required

6

based on our ‘Suspected COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis Aid System’ for S-COVID-19-P early

7

identification, which helps for a decision-support of whether the next CT examination is needed.

8

When the clinical symptoms do not relieve in a few days for home-quarantine patients, they

9

would be required to return for further examination (such as the CT scan). Meanwhile, patients

10

with negative CT findings would also be advised to have a home quarantine with regular

11

treatment and continuous monitoring. Therefore, an artificial intelligence-assisted diagnosis aid

12

system for S-COVID-19-P would take the most advantages of clinical symptoms, routine

13

laboratory tests, and other clinical information available on admission before further CT

14

examination to improve the triage strategies in fever clinics and make a balance between

15

standard medical principles and limited medical resources.

16

Our current study has several strengths. First, we successfully used a machine-learning

17

algorithm to analyze clinical datasets without CT images and developed a diagnosis aid model

18

for early identification of S-COVID-19-P cases in the fever clinic, which would become a key

19

method to answer the questions of insufficient medical resources in the epidemic outbreak.

20

Second, we integrated most of the routinely available data on admission, including 46 features

21

that are considered to contain the most predictors. Third, we found that the admitted monocyte

22

ratio or monocyte count in blood routine test was more discriminant in S-COVID-19-P cases

23

which might be a new potential infection-related biomarker for early identification. Fourth, we

also discussed an optimized triage strategy in fever clinics for early identification of S-COVID-

2

19-P with the help of our new diagnosis aid model which would help to make a balance between

3

standard medical principles and limited medical resources. Fifth, the final model based on a

4

small number of features is likely available in most fever clinics, which has the advantages to

5

increase the possibility of worldwide use and generalizability. Lastly, the developed and

6

validated diagnosis aid model was publicly available as an online triage calculator. This is the

7

first of this method and provides a platform and useful tool for future biomarker and S-COVID-

8

19-P early identification studies in limited-resource settings.

9

Although the diagnosis results are highly reliable according to the recall score, inevitable

10

limitations may still exist in this study. First, we only evaluated lymphopenia, elevated CRP, and

11

elevated IL-6, while other biomarkers might be more discriminant. Second, the data size was

12

relatively small based on only a single-center fever clinic, which calls for ‘big data’ analysis

13

depend on multiple-center fever clinics. Third, the model was developed and validated in mildly

14

ill patients and with fewer comorbidities; therefore, more well-performing models would be

15

welcomed for a specifical subpopulation. Fourth, since the model was developed and validated in

16

a single-center fever clinic, the performance might vary when evaluated in other fever clinics,

17

particularly if they differ in patient characteristics and COVID-19 prevalence. Therefore, the

18

diagnosis aid model of this study requires further external validation based on different

19

background populations. Fifth, there is a potential risk for misuse of the online calculator. To

20

make the right choice and decision, more consideration should be taken in suited patients and

21

classification threshold (27). Last but not the least, the “Suspected COVID-19 pneumonia

22

Diagnosis Aid System” would only be used as one of the auxiliary references for making clinical

23

and management decisions.

Conclusion

2

We successfully used a machine-learning algorithm to develop a diagnosis aid model

3

without CT images for early identification of S-COVID-19-P, and the diagnostic performance

4

was better than lymphopenia, elevated CRP, and elevated IL-6 on admission. The recall score on

5

both held-out testing and validation sets are 100%, suggesting that the model is highly reliable

6

for clinical diagnosis. We also discussed an optimized triage strategy in fever clinics for early

7

identification of S-COVID-19-P with the help of our new diagnosis aid model which would

8

make a good balance between standard medical principles and limited medical resources. To

9

facilitate further validation, the developed diagnosis aid model is available online as a triage

10

calculator.
