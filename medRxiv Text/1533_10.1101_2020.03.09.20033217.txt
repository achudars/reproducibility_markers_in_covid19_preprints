To the Editor,

22

A novel human coronavirus, now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

23

(SARS-CoV-2, referred to as HCoV-19 here) that emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019 is now causing a

24

pandemic1. Here, we analyze the aerosol and surface stability of HCoV-19 and compare it with SARS-

25

CoV-1, the most closely related human coronavirus.2 We evaluated the stability of HCoV-19 and SARS-

26

CoV-1 in aerosols and on different surfaces and estimated their decay rates using a Bayesian regression

27

model (see Supplementary Appendix). All experimental measurements are reported as mean across 3

28

replicates.

29
30

HCoV-19 remained viable in aerosols throughout the duration of our experiment (3 hours) with a

31

reduction in infectious titer from 103.5 to 102.7 TCID50/L, similar to the reduction observed for SARS-CoV-

32

1, from 104.3 to 103.5 TCID50/mL (Figure 1A).

33

HCoV-19 was most stable on plastic and stainless steel and viable virus could be detected up to

34

72 hours post application (Figure 1A), though the virus titer was greatly reduced (plastic from 103.7 to

35

100.6 TCID50/mL after 72 hours, stainless steel from 103.7 to 100.6 TCID50/mL after 48 hours). SARS-CoV-

36

1 had similar stability kinetics (polypropylene from 103.4 to 100.7 TCID50/mL after 72 hours, stainless steel

37

from 103.6 to 100.6 TCID50/mL after 48 hours). No viable virus could be measured after 4 hours on copper

38

for HCoV-19 and 8 hours for SARS-CoV-1, or after 24 hours on cardboard for HCoV-19 and 8 hours for

39

SARS-CoV-1 (Figure 1A).

40

Both viruses exhibited exponential decay in virus titer across all experimental conditions, as

41

indicated by linear decrease in the log10TCID50/mL over time (Figure 1B). HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV-1

42

exhibited similar half-lives in aerosols, with median estimates around 1.1-1.2 hours, and 95% credible

43

intervals of [0.64, 2.64] hours for HCoV-19 and [0.78 , 2.43] hours for SARS-CoV-1 (Figure 1C, Table

44

S1). Half-lives on copper were also similar between the two viruses. On cardboard, HCoV-19 showed a

45

considerably longer half-life than SARS-CoV-1. Both viruses showed longest viability on stainless steel

46

and plastic: the median half-life estimate for HCoV-19 was roughly 5.6 hours on steel and 6.8 hours on

47

plastic (Figure 1C, Table S1). Estimated differences in half-life between the two viruses were small

48

except for on cardboard (Figure 1C, Table S1). Individual replicate data were noticeably noisier for

49

cardboard than other surfaces (Figures S1–S5), so we advise caution in interpreting this result.

50
51

Our findings show that the stability of HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV-1 under the experimental

52

circumstances tested is similar. This indicates that differences in the epidemiology of these viruses likely

53

arise from other factors, including high viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and the potential for

54

individuals infected with HCoV-19 to shed and transmit the virus while asymptomatic3,4. Our results

55

indicate that aerosol and fomite transmission of HCoV-19 are plausible, as the virus can remain viable

56

and infectious in aerosols for multiple hours and on surfaces up to days. This echoes the experience with

57

SARS-CoV-1, where these modes of transmission were associated with nosocomial spread and

58

superspreading events5, and provides guidance for pandemic mitigation measures.
