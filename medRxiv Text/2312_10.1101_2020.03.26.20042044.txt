Abstract
Background: The spread of an novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously named
2019-nCoV) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries
in a matter of weeks. Elucidating the diagnostic value of different methods, especially
the auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies assays for SARS-CoV-2 infection is
helpful for improving the sensitivities of pathogenic-diagnosis, providing timely
treatment, and differentiating the infected cases from the healthy, thus preventing
further epidemics.
Methods: Medical records from 38 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in
the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang from January 22, 2020 to February 28, 2020
were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Specimens including throat swabs,
sputum and serum were collected during the hospitalization period, viral RNAs and
serum IgM-IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were measured respectively. The
detectability of different methods as well as the auxiliary diagnosis value of
antibodies test for SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed.
Results: Among 38 patients, the total seropositive rate for IgM and IgG was 50.0%
and 92.1%, respectively. Two patients remained seronegative throughout the course of
illness. In the early phase of illness, the RNA test for sputum specimens possessed the
highest detectability(92.3%), followed by the the RNA test for throat swabs (69.2%),
and the antibodies assays presented lower positive rates(IgM, 23.0%, IgG, 53.8%).
While, the sensitivity of antibodies assays overtook that of RNA test since day 8 after
onset (IgM, 50.0%; IgG, 87.5%). Of note, the positive rate of throat swabs was only
13.0% for cases in later phase(≥15 d.a.o), and the sensitivities of IgM and IgG rose to
52.2% and 91.3%, respectively. Combined use of antibodies assay and qRT-PCR at
the same time was able to improve the sensitivities of pathogenic-diagnosis,
especially for the throat swabs group at the later stage of illness. Moreover, most of
these cases with undetectable viral RNA in throat swabs specimens at the early stage
of illness were able to be IgM/IgG seropositive after 7 days.
Conclusions: The antibodies detection against SARS-CoV-2 offers vital clinical
information for physicians, and could be used as an effective supplementary indicator

Introduction
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, continues to spread
worldwide and has become a global threat. As of March 21, 2020, it has reached more
than 115 countries, with 266073 cases and 11184 deaths(1-2). The World Health
Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic and rates the global
risk assessment as very high.A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is
imperative(3).Timely and accurate diagnosis of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, and
to isolate and care for these patients early are of great importance for interrupting
human-to-human transmission, and limiting further spread of the virus. Common
laboratory abnormalities in confirmed COVID-19 cases include decreased white
blood cells, lymphocytes, and platelet counts, and an increased LDH, CK, and CRP
levels(4-5). And the reported common clinical symptoms include fever, cough,
myalgia or fatigue(6). However, these abnormalities and symptoms are not unique
features of COVID-19 since these might be similar to that of other virus infected
disease. Meanwhile, some infected patients are asymptomatic but can also become a
source of infection, which makes early diagnosis essential.
The use of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays for the detection of the
viral nucleic acid has become the primary and crucial diagnostic approach for
identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while it still has some limitations in clinical
practice(7-9). The RNA-based diagnostic tests only give a positive result when the
virus is still present. The tests could not identify people who has been infected in the
past, recovered, and cleared the virus from their bodies. In addition, negligible
false-negative risk brought by PCR test were reported and the positive rates varied for
different specimens in COVID-19 patients. A number of cases that were
epidemiologically linked to SARS-CoV-2 exposure and with typical lung CT images
still remained RNA negative in their respiratory tract specimens(10-12).
IgG/IgM antibodies test, a serological test method, has been added as a
diagnostic criteria in China’s updated version of the diagnosis and treatment
guidelines for COVID-19 (3rd, March).It will help to trace in a much more

population-based way whether a person has been infected in the past since the body
could retain antibodies against virus that it has already overcome.While such assays
still need to be carefully validated to be sure they could react only to antibodies
against SARS-CoV-2. The similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and the other viruses
might lead to cross-reactivity. Also here were still false positive and false negative
results for IgG/IgM antibodies test(13-15). Herein, there is an urgent need for
elucidating the diagnostic accuracy of different specimens and methods to improve
the positive rates, so as to prevent virus transmission and to assure timely treatment of
patients.
Materials and Methods
Study Design and Participants
Medical records from 38 COVID-19 patients (aged from 15 years to 75 years) in the
Second People's Hospital of Fuyang from January 22, 2020 to February 28, 2020 were
collected and retrospectively analyzed. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the
New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (5th edition) published
by the National Health Commission of China. Specimens including throat swabs,
sputum and serum were collected during the hospitalization period.Viral RNAs and
serum IgM-IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were measured by qRT-PCR
(Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay) and GICA
assay (Colloidal Gold Antibodies Test), respectively. This study was approved by the
National Health Commission of China and Ethics Commission of the Second People's
Hospital of Fuyang. Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission
of the designated hospital for emerging infectious disease and the urgent need to
collect data.
qRT-PCR Assay for SARS-CoV-2
Respiratory specimens including throat swabs and sputum were collected, and then
the throat swabs were placed into a sterile test tube with 1 mL sterile saline, the
sputum samples were added equal volume of acetylcysteine and shaken at room
temperature for 30 min to be fully liquefied. Next, total RNA was extracted using a
viral nucleic acid isolation kit (Jiangsu Bioperfectus Technologies Company, Ltd.),

and the qRT-PCR assay was performed using a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection
kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Shanghai BioGerm Medical
Biotechnology Co.,Ltd.). The open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid
protein (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2, were simultaneously amplified and tested. (1)
Interpretation of test results: ① FAM channel for ORFlab gene detection, HEX/C
Channel for N gene detection; ② Negative results: Ct value> 37 or not detected; ③
Positive results: amplification curve was S-shaped, and Ct value ≤ 37;④ Suspicious
results: the amplification curve was S-shaped, and 37 <Ct value <40. (2) Criteria for
SARS-CoV-2-infection interpretation: ① Both of the two genes (ORFla / b, N) of
SARS-CoV-2 in one specimen were positive; ② Cases with a single positive gene
required confirmation by retesting. If it is still positive for the same single target, it is
determined to be positive.If not, it is determined to be negative.These diagnostic
criteria were based on the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral Disease
Control and Prevention of China
(http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/kyjz/202001/t20200121_211337.html).
Colloidal Gold Antibodies Test for SARS-CoV-2
Serum IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were tested by using a GICA
kits according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Innovita Biological Technology Co.,
Ltd.). Briefly, for each test, 10μL of serum sample and 80μL of sample diluent were
added onto the pad of the test strip. Then the strip was placed flat at room temperature
for 15min to react and then result could be judged according to the color of the tested
and control lines. ① Both the detection band and the control band turn red, the sample
will be interpreted as positive.② If the control band turns red while the detection band
does not, it will be interpreted as negative. ③ If neither band was colored, the test
reagents will be assumed to be not working and required confirmation by retesting.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed using SPSS 19.0. Continuous variable data were in the
median (Interquartile range, IQR), categorical variables were expressed
as frequencies (percentages), chi-square test with Yates’s correction or Fisher’s exact
test was used for comparison between groups. P<0.05 was considered to be

statistically significant.
Results
Clinical characteristics and seropositive rates of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
Medical records from 38 COVID-19 patients were collected and retrospectively
analyzed, the median age was 40.5 years (IQR, 31.0-49.5years) and 55.3% were
males. Of these patients, 3 cases were in severe or critical conditions, and the rest
were mild cases. The median number of specimens collected from each patient was 8.
A total of 76 serum samples collected during the hospitalization period of the above
38 patients were tested for IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The total
seropositive rate for IgM and IgG was 50.0%（19/38）and 92.1%（35/38）, respectively.
Two patients remained seronegative for antibodies testing during hospitalization.Both
of the them are close contacts. Case 1 was a female aged 15 with no fever or fatigue,
no symptoms of digestive system, and no significant change in lymphocyte subsets
counts during the course of disease. The antibodies test still showed to be
seronegative in the 14 days following hospital discharge. Case 2 was a female aged 40
with a fever, body temperature up to 38.2℃ in the onset of illness. CT scan of chest
showed a sign of inflammation, accompanied by an increased T-lymphocyte subsets
counts and a decreased NK cells counts. The antibodies test showed a seroconversion
of IgG in the 14 days following hospital discharge.
The detectability of RNA test and antibodies assays for patients in different time
after onset
We analyzed the detectability of RNA test and antibodies assays according to the time
course since illness onset in the cohort. As the results shown in Table 1, in the early
phase of illness within 7-day since onset, the RNA test for sputum specimens
possessed the highest detectability of 92.3%, followed by the the RNA test for throat
swabs (69.2%), and the antibodies assays presented lower positive rates(IgM, 23.0%;
IgG, 53.8%). While, the sensitivity of antibodies assays overtook that of RNA test
since day 8 after onset (IgM, 50.0%; IgG, 87.5%). Of note, the positive rate of throat
swabs was only 13.0% for cases in later phase(≥15 d.a.o), and the sensitivities of IgM
and IgG rose to 52.2% and 91.3%, respectively.

The auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies assays for suspected cases of negative
nucleic acid detection
Based on the above mentioned findings, we aimed to evaluate the auxiliary diagnosis
value of antibodies assays for suspected cases of negative nucleic acid detection.
Firstly, the detectability of antibodies assays in patients with undetectable viral RNA
in their respiratory tract specimens were analyzed. As the results shown in Table 2
and Table 3, combined use of the tests of RNA and antibodies assay at the same time
was able to improve the sensitivities of pathogenic-diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2
infection, especially for the throat swabs group at the later stage of illness.Then, we
further analyzed the antibodies test data of cases with undetectable viral RNA in their
throat swabs specimens at the early stage of illness. Most of them were shown to be
IgM/IgG seropositive after 7 days of negative nucleic acid test results (IgM+ 47.1%,
IgG+ 91.1%), suggesting an auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies assays.
Discussion
The spread of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has recently been identified in
patients with acute respiratory disease.It is the third highly pathogenic and
transmissible coronavirus after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)
emerged in humans(16). Effective diagnosis that identify SARS-CoV-2 infection in
people are of great importance for public health efforts, not just for individuals’ health
concerns. Patients’ clinical manifestations mainly included fever, cough, dyspnea,
myalgia, fatigue, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Diagnosis could be based
on clinical history, laboratory and CT images, but confirmation primarily relies on
nucleic acid detection. Yet many novel coronavirus pneumonia patients can not be
diagnosed due to negative nucleic acid test. For example, throat swab is commonly
used for nucleic acid test, while the viral loads in upper respiratory tract samples are
usually much lower than that in lower respiratory tract samples in COVID-19 cases,
and the viral loads of patients varies in different stage of illness(17).
Consequently, these problems lead to an urgent need for clinical auxiliary
diagnosis, so as to improve the positive detective rates and to provide timely treatment

and preventive quarantine. The human immune system can produce specific IgM and
IgG antibodies against virus infection. IgM is the earliest antibody that appears upon
first immune response. Serological presence of IgM indicates a recent infection and
could be used as auxiliary diagonosis of early infection. IgG is produced later and
lasts long, which can be used as an indicator of previous or secondary
infection(18-19). In this study, the positive rate of throat swabs was only 13.0% for
cases in later phase( ≥ 15 d.a.o), and the sensitivities of IgM and IgG were 52.2% and
91.3%, respectively. Combining use of antibodies assay at the same time could be
able to greatly improve the sensitivities of pathogenic-diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2
infection, especially for the throat swabs group during the later stage of
illness.Moreover, through further analysis of the antibodies test data of cases with
undetectable viral RNA in throat swabs specimens at the early stage of illness, we
suggest that most of these cases could be IgM/IgG seropositive after 7 days of
negative nucleic acid test results, indicating an auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies
assays.
It should be noted that there were still false positive and false negative results
for antibodies assay. When IgM and IgG levels are below the detection limit, the test
results would be negative. Furthermore, IgM antibodies would gradually decrease and
disappear after 2 weeks, so that the IgM level might be below its peak and not
detectable in some cases.Meanwhile, the difference in individual immune response
might result in the false negative results in suspected cases(19-20). Patients who do
not produce antibodies, or who produce antibodies relatively late, might have a
relapse once their immunity is reduced.
In conclusion, the test of IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 provides
important immunological evidence for physicians, and could be used as an effective
supplementary indicator for suspected cases of negative viral nucleic acid detection or
in conjunction with nucleic acid detection in the diagnosis of suspected cases.
Combination of nucleic acid RT-PCR and IgM-IgG antibodies test can provide more
accurate SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis.More research and development of the
SARS-CoV-2 IgG-IgM combined antibodies test kit need to be encouraged to
