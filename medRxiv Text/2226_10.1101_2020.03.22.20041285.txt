Summary
Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia outbreak began
in Wuhan and pandemics tend to occur. Although SARS-CoV-2-specific
immunoglobulins have been detected in serum of COVID-19 patients, their dynamics
and association with outcomes have not been characterized.
Methods:
A total of 116 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and
SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins tested in Tongji hospital were retrospectively
investigated. Clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics and outcomes data were
compared between mild-moderate group and died group. Further, a paired
case-control study was conducted where each deceased case was matched to three
mild-moderate patients of similar age.
Findings:
Among 116 subjects included, 101 mild-moderate patients survived and 15 cases died.
SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM levels peaked in forth week after onset of COVID-19
pneumonia, while serum IgG levels increased over 8 weeks. Serum IgM levels were
higher in deceased patients than mild-moderate patients (P = 0.024), but not IgG.
Serum IgM levels were negatively correlated with clinical outcome, eosinophil count
and albumin levels (r = -0.269, P = 0.003; r = -0.188, P = 0.043; and r = -0.198, P =
0.033, resp.). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for IgM antibody was 0.681 (95%
CI: 0.517-0.845, P = 0.024). In case-control study paired by age, serum IgM was
higher in deceased patients than mild-moderate patients (P = 0.019), positively
correlated with leucocyte count (r = 0.260, P = 0.045), while negatively correlated
with clinical outcome and albumin levels (r = -0.337, P = 0.008; r = -0.265, P = 0.041).
AUC for IgM levels was 0.704 (95% CI: 0.534-0.873, P = 0.019).
Interpretation:
These results indicate that dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies
was similar with that of SARS-CoV, while elevated serum IgM levels indicate poor
outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Key words: 2019-nCoV; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Immunoglobulin
Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly worldwide since its
discovery in December 20191,2. As of March 14, 2020, over five thousand death from
2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection have been reported in 43 countries3.
Effective strategies to treat this disease are urgently needed, but no drugs have been
proven to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia 4. Antibodies are
key components in the immune responses to viral infections5,6. Raised
SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) have
been detected in serum of COVID-19 patients7. However, less information is available
about their dynamics and role in COVID-19 pneumonia.
Therefore, 116 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and with
SARS-CoV-2 specific serum IgM and IgG detected were retrospectively selected
between February 23, 2020, and March 11, 2020. The dynamics and role of serum
IgM and IgG were investigated in this study.

Methods
Study design and participants
A total of 116 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and with
serum IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 examined between February 23, 2020, and
March 11, 2020 in Tongji Hospital were retrospectively investigated. In brief, the
patients in mild-moderate group described here were all probable hospitalized
subjects in four wards of Tongji hospital with (1) serum IgM and IgG against
SARS-CoV-2 examined, (2) chest radiographic evidence of pneumonia, (3) positive
throat swab nucleic acid test by real-time RT-PCR methods or ≥ a fourfold increase in
specific antibodies by the chemiluminescence kit. Patients with severe pneumonia8 or
discharged from hospital in 24 hours were excluded from mild-moderate group.
Patients in died group were all probable hospitalized cases who died between
February 23, 2020, and March 11, 2020 with serum IgM and IgG against
SARS-CoV-2 detected. Similarly, Patients who died in 24 hours after hospitalization

were excluded from this study. This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical
Ethical Committee of Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and
Technology (IRB ID：TJ- IRB20200343).
Data collection
Information collection was accomplished through our hospital's electronic medical
record system. Clinical, laboratory, radiological parameters and clinical outcomes
were obtained with standardised forms for all subjects involved. Two researchers
independently reviewed the data.
Antibody measurement
Serum IgM and IgG antibodies were detected by the chemiluminescence kit
(iFlash-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, iFlash-SARS-CoV-2 IgG) and iFlash 3000 CLIA System
supplied by Yhlo Biotech Co. LTD (Shenzhen, China), of which the
chemiluminescence kit had completed the EU CE certification. Threshold of 10
AU/ml was used for both IgM and IgG as manufacturer recommended.
Statistical analysis
The statistical software SPSS 23.0 was used in this study. Categorical variables were
described as frequency rates and percentages, and continuous variables were
described using mean with interquartile range (IQR). When the data were normal,
continuous variables were analysed by t tests, otherwise using the Mann-Whitney test.
Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test. Receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate IgM and IgG as potential
predictors for clinical outcome. Correlation analysis was evaluated by the Pearson test.
All tests were 2-sided, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
The characterization of patients
Among 116 subjects included, 101 mild-moderate patients survived and 15 cases died,
including 65 males and 51 females (Table 1). Of the 116 patients, 77 (66%) had one or
more comorbidities. Hypertension (44 [38%]), diabetes (23 [20%]), cardiovascular

disease (10 [9%]), COPD (6 [5%]), malignancy (7 [6%]) and chronic renal disease (6
[5%]) were the most common coexisting conditions. The chief complaints were fever
(90 [76%] of 116 patients), cough (17 [15%]), and other uncommon symptoms (Table
1). Of 116 patients, 95 (82%) patients were bilateral involvement evaluated on the
chest CT or X-ray images. The mean hospitalized duration was 19.1 (6.0-29.0) days.
People who died were significantly older (68.9 years [IQR 57.0-79.0] vs 60.0 years
[IQR 50.0-69.0]; P = 0.019), more men included (12 [80%] vs 53 [52%]; P = 0.045)
and more likely to have comorbidities (14 [93%] vs 63 [62%]; P = 0.018).
Laboratory parameters in mild-moderate and deceased patients
The blood counts of patients on admission showed significantly decrease in
lymphocytes, especially in died group than in mild-moderate patients (Table 2).
Prothrombin time and D-dimer level on admission were higher in deceased patients
(PT 15.5 s [14.6-16.6]; D-dimer 5.9 μg/L [0.8-6.8]) than mild-moderate patients (PT
14.0 s [13.3-14.4], P = 0.003; D-dimer 2.3 μg/L [0.3-1.9], P = 0.011). Blood urea
nitrogen and creatinine level on admission were higher in deceased patients (BUN
10.9 mmol/L [7.5-11.9]; Creatinine 159.9 μmol/L [80.0-122.0]) than mild-moderate
patients (BUN 5.7 mmol/L [3.9-6.5], P < 0.001; Creatinine 88.2 μmol/L [57.0-81.0], P
< 0.001). Serum albumin level was lower in deceased patients (albumin 31.7 g/L
[27.4-37.3]) than mild-moderate patients (albumin 36.0 g/L [31.7-40.4], P = 0.024).
No significant differences existed in serum IL6 levels between deceased patients (15
patients included, 83.4 pg/mL [14.0-65.2]) and mild-moderate patients (91 patients
included, 36.5 pg/mL [1.7-25.3], P = 0.093).
IgM levels were associated with clinical outcome
Serum IgM levels were higher in deceased patients (IgM 253.8 AU/ml [29.2-127.3])
than mild-moderate patients (IgM 88.6 AU/ml [12.9-88.1], P = 0.024), but not IgG
(230.7 AU/ml [IQR 157.3-295.5] vs 197.1 AU/ml [IQR 149.2-225.3]; P =0.202; Table
2, Figure 1A, B). We subsequently explored the correlations between IgM levels and
clinical outcome, serum IgG levels, blood counts, or other involved parameters.
Interestingly, serum IgM levels were positively correlated with IgG levels (r = 0.251,
P = 0.006), while negatively correlated with clinical outcome, eosinophil count and

albumin levels (r = -0.269, P = 0.003; r = -0.188, P = 0.043; and r = -0.198, P = 0.033,
resp.). Meanwhile, no significant correlations were found between IgM levels and sex,
comorbidities, leucocyte count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, blood urea
nitrogen levels, creatinine levels, PT, D-dimer levels, IL6 levels or duration between
onset and antibody detection in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (r = -0.139, P =
0.136; r = -0.002, P = 0.979; r = 0.165, P = 0.076; r = 0.171, P = 0.067; r = -0.052, P =
0.582; r = 0.005, P = 0.954; r = -0.081, P = 0.390; r = 0.127, P = 0.175; r = 0.087, P =
0.354; r = 0.121, P = 0.216 and r = 0.066, P = 0.484, resp.). SARS-CoV-2-specific
IgM levels peaked in forth week after onset of COVID-19 pneumonia, while serum
IgG levels increased over time more than 8 weeks (Figure 1C). Finally, IgM and IgG
levels were assessed to predict the clinical outcome by ROC curves. The area under
the ROC curve (AUC) for IgM antibody was 0.681 (95% confidence interval:
0.517-0.845, P = 0.024), while AUC for IgG antibody was 0.613 (95% confidence
interval: 0.443-0.784, P = 0.158) (Figure 1D).
Case-control study paired by age
As reported, antibodies to coronaviruses are higher in older compared with younger
adults9. To minimize confounding effects from age, a paired case-control study was
further done. Each deceased case was matched with three mild-moderate patients of
similar age (age difference within four years). Leucocyte count and neutrophil count
of patients on admission were significantly higher in died group than mild-moderate
patients (9.4 [IQR 7.3-11.5] vs 6.4 [IQR 4.5-7.1], P = 0.004; 8.2 [IQR 6.2-10.0] vs 4.6
[IQR 2.6-5.7], P < 0.001; Table 3), while lymphocyte count and eosinophil count of
patients were significantly lower in died group than mild-moderate patients (0.7 [IQR
0.5-0.9] vs 1.1 [IQR 0.7-1.5], P = 0.017; 0 [IQR 0-0] vs 0.1 [IQR 0-0.1], P = 0.007;
Table 3). Blood urea nitrogen and prothrombin time on admission were higher in
deceased patients (BUN 10.9 mmol/L [7.5-11.9]; PT 15.5 s [14.6-16.6]) than
mild-moderate patients (BUN 5.9 mmol/L [3.8-6.3], P = 0.001; PT 14.5 s [13.6-14.6],
P = 0.029). Serum IL6 was higher in deceased patients (15 patients included, 83.4
pg/mL [14.0-65.2]) than mild-moderate patients (41 patients included, 36.7 pg/mL
[2.8-55.3], P = 0.032).

Serum IgM was higher in deceased patients (IgM 253.8 AU/ml [29.2-123.3])
than mild-moderate patients (IgM 74.7 AU/ml [10.8-82.0], P = 0.019), but not IgG
(Table 3, Figure 2A). We also explored the correlations between IgM levels and
clinical outcome, serum IgG levels, blood counts, or other involved parameters.
Similarly, serum IgM levels were positively correlated with IgG levels and leucocyte
count (r = 0.279, P = 0.031; r = 0.260, P = 0.045), and negatively correlated with
clinical outcome and albumin levels (r = -0.337, P = 0.008; r = -0.265, P = 0.041).
Meanwhile, no significant correlations were found between IgM levels and sex,
comorbidities, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, eosinophil count, blood urea
nitrogen levels, creatinine levels, PT, D-dimer levels, IL6 levels or duration between
onset and antibody detection in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (r = -0.131, P =
0.319; r = 0.109, P = 0.409; r = 0.254, P = 0.050; r = 0.039, P = 0.769; r = -0.178, P =
0.173; r = -0.026, P = 0.854; r = -0.110, P = 0.404; r = 0.098, P = 0.457; r = 0.127, P =
0.335; r = 0.116, P = 0.394 and r = 0.085, P = 0.521, resp.). Finally, IgM levels were
assessed to predict the clinical outcome by ROC curves. The area under the ROC
curve (AUC) for IgM levels was 0.704 (95% confidence interval: 0.534-0.873, P =
0.019), while AUC for IgG levels was 0.593 (95% confidence interval: 0.416-0.769, P
= 0.286) (Figure 2B).

Discussion
In this retrospective study, we analyzed the levels of serum IgM, IgG and other
clinical parameters in 116 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia.
The results showed that serum IgM levels were higher in died group, negatively
correlated with clinical outcome, and predicted the mortality in patients with
COVID-19 pneumonia. Thus, elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgM levels indicate poor
outcome.

. Host immune responses play a key role in virus elimination.

Histological examination of lungs from patients who died of COVID-19 revealed
bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular exudates, accompanied by interstitial

substantially reduced, while their status was hyperactivated

. Raised

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies have been detected in COVID-19 patients 7, but
little is known about their dynamics and role in COVID-19 pneumonia. SARS-CoV
specific IgG antibodies persisted for a long time over three months, though the
SARS-CoV specific IgM peaked in third week and remained measurable for a much
shorter period, which were both analyzed by an indirect enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay

15

. Similarly, as shown in Figure 1C, SARS-CoV-2-specific

IgM levels peaked in forth week after onset of COVID-19 pneumonia, then decreased
more slowly than SARS-CoV specific IgM, while serum IgG levels increased over 8
weeks. Relatively weaker pathogenicity and prolonged viral shedding provided the
rationale for the relatively slower but long-lasting immune response, and provided a
strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the
future

6,11

. The profile of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies might be

helpful in the diagnosis and in epidemiologic surveys. Both matched and unmatched
analyses yielded similar results that elevated SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM levels
indicated poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Similarly, another
team found that a higher titer of antibody titer was associated with a worse clinical
classification 16. The reason is speculated as follows. Firstly, at least in some stages,
high antibody levels indicate high viral load, which is a prognostic factor for poor
outcome 17. Secondly, a neutralizing antibody can bind to the surface spike protein of
coronaviruses and mediate viral entry into IgG Fc receptor-expressing cells, indicating
complex roles of antibodies in viral elimination

18

. Furthermore, the study

demonstrates that serum IgM levels were significantly correlated with leucocyte count,
indicating more severe inflammation associated with coronavirus infection or
secondary infection.

This study also has limitations. It is a single-centre retrospective study with
limited cases. Majority of patients admitted in our hospital were critically ill, so
population bias exists. In addition, results of viral load and antibody re-testing were
not available.
In summary, our results demonstrate that dynamics of IgM and IgG antibodies
against SARS-CoV-2 was similar with that of SARS-CoV. Differently, elevated serum
IgM levels indicate poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
