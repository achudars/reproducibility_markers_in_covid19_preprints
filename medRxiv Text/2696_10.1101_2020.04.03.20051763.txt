ABSTRACT

Background:
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has progressed
to a pandemic associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The WHO and the
United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued interim
clinical guidance for management of patients with confirmed coronavirus disease
(COVID-19), but there is limited data on the virologic and clinical characteristics for
prognosis of severe COVID-19.

Methods:
A total of 50 patients with severe COVID-19 were divided into good and poor
recovery groups. The dynamic viral shedding and serological characteristics of
SARS-CoV-2 were explored. The risk factors associated with poor recovery and lung
lesion resolutions were identified. In addition, the potential relationships among the
viral shedding, the pro-inflammatory response, and lung lesion evolutions were
characterized.

Results:
A total of 58% of the patients had poor recovery and were more likely to have a
prolonged interval of viral shedding. The longest viral shedding was 57 days after
symptom onset. Older age, hyperlipemia, hypoproteinemia, corticosteroid therapy,
consolidation on chest computed-tomography (CT), and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 IgM
positive were all associated with poor recovery. Additionally, the odds of impaired
lung lesion resolutions were higher in patients with hypoproteinemia, hyperlipemia,
and elevated levels of IL-4 and ferritin. Finally, viral shedding and proinflammatory
responses were closely correlated with lung lesion evolutions on chest CT.

Conclusions
Patients with severe COVID-19 have prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection and delayed
intermittent viral shedding. Older age, hyperlipemia, hypoproteinemia, corticosteroid
usage, and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 IgM positive might be utilized as predicative
factors for the patients with poor recovery.

Introduction
The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that was
first reported in Wuhan, China, has caused a large-scale Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic1. Currently, more than 823, 626 people have contracted the
virus and more than 40, 598 have died worldwide. Robust research is ongoing to help
better understand this novel virus2-7. However, we still understand little about the
virologic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, and scarce data are available in terms of the
risk factors associated with refractory COVID-19.

Currently, interim guidance for discontinuation of transmission-based precautions and
disposition of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have been implemented8.
Unfortunately, though, SARS-CoV-2 reactivation and clinical deterioration have been
reported in patients after hospital discharge9. Besides, some recovered patients can
still excrete SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated by the presence of viral nucleic acids in
throat specimens10. It can be difficult to detect the virus in recovered patients, and
they will be misjudged as "healed" if the patient happens to be at a low level of viral
replication. Thus, the potential infectivity of recovered cases remained unclear. A
comprehensive exploration of the virologic and clinical characteristics of patients who

recovered from COVID-19 would help to address these questions. It also alters us that
the current criteria for hospital discharge may need to be re-evaluated11.

In this retrospective observational study, 50 severe cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan,
China were focused on, and the virologic and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2
were investigated to uncover the natural history of SARS-CoV-2.

Methods
Data Source
A single-center, observational study was performed at Union Hospital within the
Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST).
All of the studied adult patients with COVID-19 infection were hospitalized on
February 9, 2020. Forty-eight patients were classified as laboratory-confirmed cases
of COVID-19 (diagnosis based on positive viral nucleic-acid test results from throatswab samples), whereas the remaining two patients were clinically diagnosed cases
(viral nucleic-acid test was negative, but diagnosis was made based on symptoms,
exposure history, and the presence of lung-imaging features consistent with
coronavirus pneumonia)11,12. Both of the two clinically diagnosed patients were later
confirmed using serologic tests for SARS-CoV-2. The medical records from February
9 to March 17, 2020 of the severely ill patients were analyzed. All of the patients were
divided into either a good or poor recovery group according to their clinical outcome
on March 17, 2020. In addition, the patients were also divided into lung lesions with a
partial resolution-patient group and a lung lesions with significant resolution-patient
group based on the latest chest CT scans from March 11 to March 17, 2020. This
study was approved by the Ethics Commission of Union Hospital at Tongji Medical
College of HUST. Written informed consent was obtained directly from patient. The
details of the data sources, procedures for nucleic-acids amplification, serologic tests

for SARS-CoV-2, treatments, clinical outcomes, and definitions in this study are
provided in the supplementary appendix.

Statistical analysis
For the continuous variables, the descriptive data were expressed as appropriate as the
means and standard deviations or the medians and interquartile ranges (IQR). The
categorical variables were summarized as the counts and percentages in each
category. A Pearson’s χ2 test, a Pearson’s χ2 test with continuity correction, or a
Fisher’s exact test were utilized as appropriate to compare the differences between
COVID-19 patients with good recovery and poor recovery. All of the analyses were
performed using the R statistical package version 3.5.3.

Results
General clinical presentations
Fifty patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study on February 9, 2020. A total
of 27 were male and 23 were female. The median age was 64 years (IQR, 37–87
years). More than half of patients had underlying disorders, including hypertension
(10, 20%), diabetes (12, 24%), coronary heart disease (11, 22%), and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, [3, 6%]), among other disorders. Most patients
experienced symptoms, such as fatigue (39, 78%), fever (28, 56%), and cough (24,
48%). All of the patients had shortness of breath upon admission (Table 1).

Most patients exhibited lymphopenia upon admission. The common complications
while in the hospital were electrolyte disorders, coagulopathy, dyslipidemia,
hypoproteinemia, and liver dysfunction. Importantly, hyperlipidemia,
hypoproteinemia, and liver injury were more frequently observed in patients with
poor recovery, with TG and lactatdehydrogenase (LDH) levels above the normal
range. In addition, coagulation disorders were commonly seen in patients with poor

recovery, and the frequency of fibrogen (FIB) elevation differed greatly between the
two groups (Table 2).

Additionally, patients with poor recovery had a higher frequency of corticosteroid
therapy and albumin administration than patients with good recovery (Table 2). Odds
of poor recovery were higher in patients with older age, hypoproteinemia,
hyperlipemia, and corticosteroid therapy (Table 2). As of March 17, 2020, the median
time from admission to discharge was 36.5 days (IQR, 24–38 days). A total of 21
(42%) patients had been discharged, whereas 29 (58%) patients were still hospitalized
with multifocal lesions on chest CT.

Virologic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2
A total of 363 viral nucleic-acids tests were performed to explore the viral shedding
during the disease course. The viral detection positive rates differed between different
specimen types, and varied with day after onset of disease (Supplementary Table 2).
The dynamic pattern of viral shedding showed that most patients had intermittent
virus shedding. Intriguingly, two patients had significant clinical improvement, but
their viral nucleic-acid tests remained positive for a few days. As of March 17, 2020,
the median duration of viral shedding was 31 days (IQR, 27–34 days) after symptom
onset, and the longest duration of viral shedding was 57 days (Figure 1A). The
interval between first and last positive PCR assay results (4 to 22 days) was
extensively prolonged in patients with poor recovery.

In addition, the serologic tests for SARS-Cov-2 also differed greatly between the two
groups. The presence of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 IgM was closely associated with the
poor recovery of patients with COVID-19 (p=0.03, Table2). A total of 11 out of 12
(91.66%) patients with good recovery have positive IgG, but negative IgM after
hospitalization for one month. In contrast, 15 (51.7%, 15/29) patients with poor

recovery had positive test results for both IgM and IgG. As of March 17, 2020, the
longest duration of IgM was 55 days at onset of illness, indicating that severe patients
with poor recovery were more likely to have a prolonged acute phase of the illness.
(Figure 1B).

Chest CT imaging of severe COVID-19 patients
A total of 195 chest CT imaging results were collected to continuously monitor the
disease courses. The most common patterns seen on the initial chest CT scans were
bilateral lung involvement (49 out of 50, 98%), ground-glass opacities (GGO) (49 out
of 50, 98%), and consolidation (21 out of 50, 42%, Table 1 and Supplementary Figure
1A). Importantly, patients with poor recovery were more likely to have persistent lung
damage with diffuse patterns of GGO and multifocal consolidation, and the
consolidation pattern was closely associated with the poor outcomes of the patients.
(p=0.03, Table 2). The lesions were gradually absorbed with residual GGO,
consolidation, interstitial abnormalities, and lung fibrosis observed (Supplementary
Figure 3). Most patients in the good recovery group had significant improvement on
the chest CT prior to hospital discharge. In contrast, lung lesion resolution was
extensively delayed in patients with poor recovery.

Next, several stages were defined to explore the pattern of lung lesion evolution.
These included the severest stage, partial resolution, significant resolution, and
complete resolution. The most common pattern of evolution was the initial
progression to the severest stage, followed by partial resolution and significant
resolution. As expected, the duration of the severest stage and lung lesion resolution
was markedly extended in patients with impaired lung lesion resolution
(Supplementary Figure 1B). In addition, the odds of impaired lung lesion resolution
were higher in patients with hypoproteinemia and hyperlipemia. In particular, liver

injury, increased levels of TG, and decreased levels of albumin were more commonly
seen in patients with impaired lung lesion resolution (Table 3).

Inflammatory responses in severe COVID-19 patients
To explore the inflammatory-response prolife in severe-condition COVID-19 patients,
the laboratory data of inflammatory response-related biomarkers during
hospitalization were examined. It was found that most of the patients had ferritin,
CRP, ESR, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 levels above the normal ranges (Table 1). In contrast,
the TNF-α and IFN-γ levels were within the normal range in all of the patients.
Intriguingly, higher levels of CRP, IL-4, ESR, ferritin, and hs-CRP were more often
seen in patients with poor recovery (Table 2), and the dynamic inflammatory-response
prolife was closely associated with the evolution of lung lesions on the chest CT.
Indeed, patients with impaired lung lesion resolution were more likely to have an
active inflammatory response indicated by higher levels of ferritin and IL-4 in the
serum (Table 3).

Next, to explore the potential role of the inflammatory response in the viral clearance
and lung lesion resolution, the clinical details of a patient with the longest duration of
viral shedding were examined. In this patient, his viral shedding occurred on day 35,
and persistent viral shedding could be observed on days 45–51, indicating active virus
replication. Meanwhile, an excess production of cytokine IL-6 was observed on day
36, with rapid progression to the peak stage on day 47. Importantly, extensive lung
damage was observed on the chest CT on day 35, but lesions were steadily resolved
on days 41–48, with significant improvement on day 56 (Figure 2). A similar pattern
could also be observed in other patients (Supplementary Figures 4 and 5). Thus, days
of viral shedding and IL-6 concentrations were significantly correlated with the lung
lesion evolution on the chest CT in severe COVID-19 patients. It also suggested that
patients with poor recovery were more likely to have a prolonged active phase of viral

infection. Consequently, proinflammatory responses were promoted, leading to lung
lesion resolution and potential viral clearance.

Discussion
Although the lethality of COVID-19 is lower than SARS-CoV (approximately 10%)
and MERS-CoV (approximately 34%), COVID-19 rapidly spreads, resulting in a
worldwide pandemic14. The scope and development of the pandemic are much more
severe than SARS and MERS. Compared with the viral shedding at 6–12 days after
symptom onset of SARS, the COVID-19 viral shedding is variable and even longer15.
Moreover, the nucleic-acids of SARS-CoV-2 have been continuously reported to still
be detectable in patients who had been discharged after clinical recovery; however,
this was not the case for the SARS and MERS nucleic-acids. Therefore, a
retrospective, single-center observational study was performed to provide the clinical
evidence to determine the virologic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2.

It was found that clinical recovery of patients typically occurred with viral clearing in
patients with good recovery. However, it was also found that viral shedding could
persist for an interval of few days, despite clinical improvements. Although Zhou et
al. reported out that the median duration of viral shedding was 20.0 days (IQR, 17–24
days) in survivors of COVID-1916, the duration of viral shedding was found to be
greatly extended in this present study, with a median duration of 31 days after
symptom onset (IQR, 27–34 days). This difference might be due to specimen
collection, disease severity, immunological response, corticosteroid usage, antiviral
treatments, and the duration of the observational window in these various populations.
A 37-day observational study was conducted, and patient samples were consecutively
collected from both the upper respiratory tract and the gastrointestinal tract to improve
the detection of SARS-CoV-2 during the course of the disease. This clinical data thus
provides convincing evidence of the dynamic viral shedding picture for severely

infected patients. In addition, it was found that the interval of viral shedding in
patients with poor recovery was markedly prolonged. Importantly, both the IgM and
IgG of SARS-CoV-2 in the patients with poor recovery remained positive during the
late stage of the disease. This indicated that these patients might have active viral
replication in the upper airway, and that persistent viral shedding might be directly
linked to the poor recovery of patients with COVID-19. Supporting this notion, it was
found that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA could persist until death in non-survivors17. Based
on the delayed interval of viral shedding pattern and the serologic features of SARSCoV-2, it is proposed that severe-condition patients with COVID-19 may need at least
three negative PCR results with an interval of a few days. In addition, dynamic
detection to improve the presence of IgM-negative should also be evaluated to guide
discharge planning for COVID-19 patients.

Similar to SARS and MERS, the cytokine profile is closely associated with the
severity of COVID-19. Indeed, in this prognostic analysis, it was found that an active
inflammatory response was more likely to be triggered in patients with poor recovery,
marked by higher concentrations of CRP, ESR, ferritin, and hs-CRP, suggesting that
these patients might have a pro-inflammatory factor storm. Previously, Huang et al.
reported that the SARS-CoV-2 infection could initiate increased secretion of Thelper-2 (Th2) cytokines (e.g., IL4 and IL10) that suppress inflammation18. In this
study, it was also found that severe patients with poor recovery had higher levels of
IL-4 compared to patients with good recovery. Since the IL-4 levels were slightly
elevated in these patients, it was speculated that this might be due to the antagonistic
effects of IL-4 during the active phase of the pro-inflammatory response. Importantly,
it was found that the wave of the cytokine storm typically occurred during the active
phase of viral infection, and a prolonged inflammatory response could be observed in
severe patients with poor recovery. Consequently, excessive inflammation damages
lung tissue, and subsequent lung repair and regeneration could be initiated. In this

regard, lung lesions could gradually resolve and viral clearance might be achieved.
Corticosteroids were used frequently for the treatment of severe patients to control the
high amounts of cytokines. However, it was found that corticosteroid therapy was
closely associated with the poor recovery of severely infected patients. Therefore,
corticosteroids should be administrated with great caution if necessary.

Furthermore, viral shedding might persist with the prolonged inflammatory response,
leading to persistent lung damage and subsequent pulmonary fibrosis. As of March
17, 2020, 29 patients were still hospitalized with multifocal lesions on the chest CT. A
few of them were still in the active phase of viral infection, with intermittent viral
shedding and pulmonary fibrosis. It remained unknown whether these patients would
develop chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection or be viral carriers. Further follow-up studies
in these patients is highly warranted to determine the long-term clinical outcome of
severe patients with COVID-19.

In addition to the viral shedding, other risk factors for slower recovery in severe
COVID-19 patients were also identified. Consistent with previous studies19, 20, it was
confirmed that older age, hypoproteinemia, and increased levels of LDH were
associated with the poor clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. In particular, older
age, hyperlipemia, hypoproteinemia, corticosteroid therapy, and increased levels of
FIB and TG were associated with the poor recovery of COVID-19 patients. Up-todate information regarding the risk factors associated with lung lesion resolution in
severe-condition COVID-19 patients is scarce. The clinical data in this study
suggested that all of the patients had lung lesions on chest CT, and the consolidation
pattern on chest CT was closely associated with poor recovery. Intriguingly,
prognostic factors, including hyperlipemia and hypoproteinemia, were also closely
linked to the odds of impaired lung lesion resolution. However, the association of
hyperlipidemia and COVID-19 prognosis has not been reported. A previous study

reported an association of ACE2 polymorphisms with susceptibility to dyslipidemia21.
Intriguingly, more than half of the patients in the current study had dyslipidemia. It is
speculated that these patients might be particularly prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection,
and ACE2 polymorphisms might be linked to patient recovery. Thus, more studies are
needed to explore this issue.

This work differs from any other published work, in that we combined the prolife of
viral shedding, serological features, inflammatory-response and lung lesions
evolutions together, thus providing comprehensive picture of the COVID-19. The
prognostic factors of severe patient recovery were identified, which can help
clinicians identify patients with poor prognoses at an early stage. In addition, this
study provides convincing evidence of the virologic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2,
thus it greatly expands our understanding of the natural history of SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, this study provides helpful management strategies for COVID-19 patients
and can help to control the current COVID-19 pandemic.

This study does have some limitations. First, only 50 patients with confirmed
COVID-19 were included. It would be better to include a larger number of cases to
obtain a more comprehensive understanding of COVID-19. Second, the serologic
tests kits for SARS-CoV-2 were available on March 8, 2020, thus the dynamic
serologic pattern of SARS-CoV-2 during the early stage was not obtained. Third, the
cytokine test results at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection was also not
obtained, thus the initial inflammation and immune response profile in severely
infected patients remains unclear.

55-year-old man, with unknown history of corticosteroid therapy throughout the
disease course. Serum cytokine (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and IFN-γ) levels
were measured by ELISA assay. Below were the dynamic viral shedding pattern and
serological tests for SARS-CoV-2. Black circle represents the negative detection of

viral nucleic-acid PCR test, red circle represents the positive result of viral nucleicacid PCR assay. In the serological tests for SARS-CoV-2, + represents positive for
IgM or IgG. Both SARS-CoV-2-IgM and SARS-CoV-2-IgG of serological tests
remained positive within day 48-55 after symptoms onset. Serial chest CT images
shows the dynamic lung lesions resolution. Day 35 at illness onset: peripheral
predominant ground-glass opacity (diffuse pattern) in the left lobe, and partial
consolidation in the right lower lobe. Day 41-48 at illness onset: lung lesions steadily
resolved. Day 56 at illness onset: significant improvement on chest CT.
