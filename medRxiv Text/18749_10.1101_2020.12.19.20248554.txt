Abstract:

13
14

Background: The start of 2021 will be marked by a global vaccination campaign

15

against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Formulating an optimal distribution strategy

16

under social and economic constraints is challenging. Optimal distribution is additionally

17

constrained by the potential emergence of vaccine resistance. Analogous to chronic

18

low-dose antibiotic exposure, recently inoculated individuals who are not yet immune

19

play an outsized role in the emergence of resistance. Classical epidemiological

20

modelling is well suited to explore how the behavior of the inoculated population

21

impacts the total number of infections over the entirety of an epidemic.

22

Methods: A deterministic model of epidemic evolution is analyzed, with 7

23

compartments defined by their relationship to the emergence of vaccine-resistant

24

mutants and representing three susceptible populations, three infected populations, and

25

one recovered population. This minimally computationally intensive design enables

26

simulation of epidemics across a broad parameter space. The results are used to

27

identify conditions minimizing the cumulative number of infections.

28

Results: When an escape variant is only modestly less infectious than the originating

29

strain within a naïve population, there exists an optimal rate of vaccine distribution.

30

Exceeding this rate increases the cumulative number of infections due to vaccine

31

escape. Analysis of the model also demonstrates that inoculated individuals play a

32

major role in the mitigation or exacerbation of vaccine-resistant outbreaks. Modulating

33

the rate of host-host contact for the inoculated population by less than an order of

34

magnitude can alter the cumulative number of infections by more than 20%.

35

Conclusions: Mathematical modeling shows that optimization of the vaccination rate

36

and limiting post-vaccination contacts can affect the course of an epidemic. Given the

37

relatively short window between inoculation and the acquisition of immunity, these

38

results might merit consideration for an immediate, practical public health response.

Introduction:

42

The emergence of the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2

43

(SARS-CoV-2) responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic motivated dramatic public health

44

intervention including recommendations for isolation and quarantine throughout most of

45

20201. The beginning of 2021 will be marked by widespread vaccine distribution.

46

Optimizing distribution is challenging and subject to a myriad of social and economic

47

constraints2-4. The potential emergence of vaccine-resistant variants of the virus5,6

48

introduces additional complications. Vaccination applies new selective pressures which

49

can lead to diverse intermediate outcomes even under conditions admitting eventual

50

pathogen eradication7-13. The larger the size of the vaccinated population, the greater

51

the pressure towards escape of vaccine-resistant variants.

52
53

Escape variants emerge within individual hosts after infection with the originating strain.

54

Naïve, unvaccinated, hosts are more easily infected than vaccinated hosts but

55

mutations conferring resistance are unlikely to provide a selective advantage in the

56

naïve background. Thus, naïve hosts are likely to shed escape variants at very low,

57

likely, negligible rates. The reverse is true for vaccinated hosts. Recently vaccinated,

58

inoculated, hosts that are not yet immune remain highly susceptible to infection with the

59

originating strain, and in these hosts, mutations conferring resistance are more likely to

60

provide a selective advantage. As a result, a substantial fraction or even most of the

61

virus shed by such hosts will be resistant mutants. This situation is analogous to the

62

administration of a low-dose antibiotic regime14,15 . In both cases, the pathogen is

63

introduced to a susceptible host and subject to elevated selective pressure towards the

64

emergence of resistant (escape) variants.

65
66

We sought to establish the constraints imposed by virus escape on optimal vaccine

67

distribution and the role played by the small, but critical, population of inoculated hosts.

68

To this end, we constructed an epidemiological compartment model to simulate

69

vaccination campaigns over a broad parameter regime. This minimally computationally

70

intensive approach enabled us to simulate many possible scenarios for epidemic

71

evolution, in order to determine the optimal vaccination strategy for each condition.

72
73

Methods:

74
75

We divided the population into 7 compartments (Fig. 1A). Three compartments are

76

susceptible to infection by either the originating strain or escape mutants: Naïve (N,

77

unvaccinated and fully susceptible to the originating strain and escape mutants),

78

Inoculated (I, recently vaccinated and still partially susceptible to the originating strain,

79

and fully susceptible to escape mutants), and Vaccinated (V, minimally susceptible to

80

the originating strain, but fully susceptible to escape mutants). Two compartments

81

represent ongoing infection with the originating strain and are distinguished by the

82

host’s previous compartment: Infected-Naïve (F) and Infected-Inoculated (M). The third

83

infected compartment represents infection by an escape variant, Infected-Escape (E).

84

The remaining compartment, Recovered (R), contains all hosts who were previously

85

infected. Vaccination is represented by a reduction in susceptibility to infection with the

86

originating strain. Naïve hosts are inoculated at rate k V. Inoculated hosts do not

87

immediately acquire immunity and mature into the vaccinated compartment at rate k M.

88

All infected hosts recover at rate k R.

89
90

Within the timescale of the model, recovery is assumed to grant stable immunity, and

91

any variation in population size due to birth/death is assumed to be negligible. It should

92

be noted that, if recovery from the Infected-Naïve or Infected-Inoculated compartments

93

does not confer immunity against escape infection, the key results in this work will have

94

an even greater impact on the vaccination outcome. Hosts come into contact at rate k C.

95

For simplicity, we assume that contact with an escape-infected host can only produce

96

an escape infection. Also, vaccine efficacy is assumed to be perfect such that

97

vaccinated hosts cannot be infected with the originating strain. The Inoculated-Infected

98

compartment is assumed to represent a symmetric composition of escape and

99

originating infections such that the total probability of a Naïve or Inoculated host being

100

infected after contact with a Naïve-Infected or Inoculated-Infected host is the same.

101

Finally, we assume that the probability of escape-infection is the same for Naïve and

102

Vaccinated hosts across all three types of infected-susceptible host interactions. This

103

construction yields the following transition probability matrices for Naïve, Inoculated,

104

and Vaccinated hosts:

105
106

where k I represents the rate of infection for Naïve, Infected-Naïve host interactions

107

which is determined both by the contact rate k C and the infectivity of the originating

108

strain. Rows represent interaction with each of the infected compartments (Infected-

109

Naïve, Infected-Inoculated, and Infected-Escape). Columns represent transitions to

110

each of the infected compartments.

111
112

An escape mutant can emerge within an Infected-Naïve or Infected-Inoculated host.

113

The parameter α represents the infectivity of the escape variant relative to the

114

originating strain when a Naïve host interacts with an Infected-Naïve host. The

115

parameter β represents the infectivity of an escape variant when a Naïve host interacts

116

with an Infected-Escape host relative to the infectivity of the originating strain when a

117

Naïve host interacts with an Infected-Naïve host. Informally, α reflects the ratio of

118

escape variant to originating strain shed by Infected-Naïve hosts, whereas β reflects the

119

fitness of an escape variant relative to the originating strain. Finally, we introduce the

120

parameter q to represent the impact of varying the rate of host-host contact for

121

Inoculated hosts relative to that for the other compartments. q>1 represents increased

122

contact, and q<1 corresponds to decreased contact. This completes the model

123

description and structures the differential equations:

124
125

k R= k M=1/7 are fixed across all simulations representing a time to recovery and time

126

between inoculation and the acquisition of immunity of one week. Reducing k I would

127

prolong the epidemic and reducing k M would increase the size of the Inoculated

128

compartment.

129
130

k I is the principal determinant of epidemic magnitude and duration, with larger k I leading

131

to a greater cumulative number of infections over a shorter period of time (Fig. 1B).

132

However, feedback between the size of the infected population and the rate of host-host

133

contact as well as spatial structure can decouple these variables. Throughout this work,

134

k I is set to a benchmark value of 0.2 resulting in 50% of the population being infected

135

over a period of approximately 4 months.

136
137

The values of α and β impact the size of the Infected-Escape compartment. Even in the

138

absence of vaccination, large α/β results in the emergence of would-be resistant

139

variants (Fig 1C). In all analyses in this work, α is fixed at the benchmark value of 0.001

140

resulting in a modest number of would-be resistant infections for β close to 1 in the

141

absence of vaccination. Although a larger α would result in a greater total number of

142

escape infections, the fraction of those infections attributable to contact with inoculated

143

hosts would be smaller.

144
145

The solutions of the ODEs were obtained using the MATLAB ode45 method16 .

146

Epidemics are simulated until the size of the Recovery compartment at arbitrarily long

147

times is approached. The principal quantity of interest is the cumulative number of

148

infections. When k V is selected to minimize this value, minima are found through explicit

149

simulation over a range of rates. In the subsequent analysis, some values are

150

expressed relative to the cumulative number of infections in the absence of vaccination,

151

RNull~50%.

152
153

Results:

154
155

In addition to the rate of vaccination, the outcome of a vaccination campaign depends

156

on how far the epidemic has progressed before vaccination begins, which can be

157

measured by the relative size of the Recovered compartment. The results also depend

158

on β, informally, the fitness of an escape variant relative to the originating strain. We

159

considered two values for β (0.01, low; 0.875, high) and varied both the start and rate of

160

vaccination. When β is low, that is, the escape mutant is much less fit than the

161

originating strain (Fig. 2A), vaccinating earlier and distributing the vaccine faster

162

decreases the cumulative number of infections. If distribution is sufficiently prompt, the

163

cumulative number of infections becomes negligible.

164
165

However, the outcome substantially differs for high β (Fig. 2B). Due to the vaccine

166

escape, at high rates of distribution, the cumulative number of infections remains large.

167

Furthermore, there is an optimal rate of distribution such that exceeding this rate

168

increases the cumulative number of infections. In this regime, the benefit of reducing the

169

size of the population susceptible to infection by the originating strain is outweighed by

170

the cost of increasing the selective pressure for the emergence of escape variants. In all

171

subsequent analysis, the vaccination rate is varied but vaccination is fixed to begin

172

when 1% of the population has recovered from infection.

173
174

Infections can be mitigated by reducing host-host contact. We sought to determine how

175

perturbing the contact rates for hosts in the Inoculated compartment relative to that of all

176

other compartments, q, affects the outcome. For β ranging between 0.75 and 1, we

177

considered three relative contact rates, q=[0.2,1,5] (Fig. 2C). Increasing the rate of host-

178

host contact only within this compartment has a significant impact on the cumulative

179

number of infections. The optimal vaccination rate is also perturbed. Furthermore, if the

180

optimal vaccination rate it exceeded, reducing q below 1 slows the accumulation of

181

infections (Fig. 2D). The converse is true for increasing q, and the landscape is similar

182

when vaccination falls below the optimal rate (Fig. 2E).

183
184

Having demonstrated how q perturbs the optimal vaccination rate and how reducing q

185

below 1 can mitigate or delay the cumulative number of infections even if this rate is not

186

met or, conversely, is exceeded, we sought to establish the impact of q on the

187

cumulative number of infections across a wide range of β at the optimal vaccination rate

188

for each condition (Fig. 3A). The cumulative number of infections is sensitive to q across

189

the entire range of β. Varying q within an order of magnitude can substantially aid or

190

hinder the vaccination campaign, and when q>>1, the optimal rate of vaccination is 0.

191

Note that the maximum vaccination rate considered is k V=0.03 representing the

192

inoculation of 3% of Naïve hosts per day. This rate is sufficiently high that the

193

cumulative number of infections at this rate (Fig. 3B) is similar or higher compared to

194

the hypothetical case where the entire Naïve population is immediately inoculated (Fig.

195

3C). Some of these effects are not specific to the inoculated compartment. Increasing

196

the rate of contact for any arbitrary subpopulation can increase the cumulative number

197

of infections. We define the effective k I, k Ieff, such that the cumulative number of

198

infections for k I=k Ieff and q=1 is equal to the cumulative number of infections for k I=0.2

199

(the benchmark) and arbitrary q. Increasing q within an order of magnitude is equivalent

200

to substantially increasing k I for the entire population for the entirety of the epidemic

201

(Fig. 3D).

203

We additionally consider the cumulative infections added or subtracted relative to the

204

outcome corresponding to q=1 and scaled by the fraction of infections due to vaccine

205

escape (Fig. 3E). Varying q within an order of magnitude alters the cumulative number

206

of infections added or subtracted by more than 20% of the cumulative number of

207

infections in the absence of vaccination, RNull, again demonstrating the critical role

208

played by inoculated hosts with respect to vaccine escape. The landscape is similar

209

when then rate of vaccination is fixed (Fig. 3F).

210
211

Discussion:

212
213

Epidemics can be mitigated through the reduction of host-host contact (quarantines and

214

other similar measures) and vaccination. A reduction in contact carries non-negligible

215

social and economic burdens so that, when vaccination becomes possible, the

216

continuation of such interventions might appear unnecessarily costly. Formulating an

217

optimal vaccination strategy to balance these pressures is challenging and is further

218

complicated by the possibility of vaccine escape. Escape variants emergingas a result

219

of vaccination are not expected to be more infectious than the originating strain,

220

otherwise, such variants would likely already be in circulation prior to vaccination.

221

However, newly emergent variants are not always much less infectious and can be

222

responsible for non-negligible disease incidence17,18 . Here, we demonstrated that, even

223

when escape variants are modestly less infectious, there exists an optimal vaccination

224

distribution rate such that exceeding this rate increases the cumulative number of

225

infections. This optimal rate depends on the infectivity of the escape variants. Such a

226

prediction is impractical at the time of writing, that is, in the very first days of the

227

vaccination campaign, and the cost of overestimation of the optimal vaccination rate is

228

far less than that of underestimation. However, to our knowledge, this phenomenon,

229

analogous to the evolution of antibiotic resistance, is not widely appreciated and, as

230

such, seems to warrant discussion.

231
232

Of more practical concern is the role of inoculated hosts in the emergence of escape

233

variants. Within low-dose antibiotic regimes

14,15 , hosts

9

are susceptible to infection with

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.19.20248554; this version posted December 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this

234

the originating variant, and in such hosts, the pathogen is subjected to elevated

235

selective pressures towards the emergence of resistance. Similarly, within inoculated

236

hosts, the virus is subjected to gradually increasing selective pressures towards the

237

emergence of resistance while the intra-host population remains sufficiently large to

238

explore a substantial fraction of the mutation space. We demonstrated that moderately

239

increasing or decreasing the host-host contact rates for inoculated hosts only can

240

substantially aid or hinder the vaccination campaign. The time between vaccination and

241

the acquisition of immunity can be readily approximated from clinical endpoints19,20 and

242

is likely to be short enough that the societal costs of limiting post-vaccination contact

243

would be outweighed by these benefits.

244
245

Limitations:

246
247

In this study, we leveraged classical modelling techniques to elucidate the factors that

248

could substantially impact the outcome of any vaccination campaign. Although these

249

results are broadly applicable, they are not necessarily instrumental for predicting

250

quantitative outcomes for the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic or any other particular

251

epidemic. Similarly, the model presented in this study is not designed to forecast long-

252

term outcome, a topic that has been thoroughly addressed for the case of SARS-Cov-2

253

and more generally 7-13,21-23.

254
255

The results presented here appear to be of immediate interest in relation to the

256

vaccination campaign against SARS-Cov-2 that is beginning at the time of this writing.

257

However, although diversification of the virus is apparent24-26 and the potential for

258

escape is being actively investigated5,6,27,28 , it cannot be ruled out that all escape

259

variants have a substantially reduced infectivity, represented by β<<1, in which case the

260

highest possible vaccination rate will be optimal and the benefits specific to post-

261

vaccination contact limitation could be negligible.

262
263

Conclusions:

265

Depending on the infectivity of escaping, vaccine-resistant mutants, the optimal

266

vaccination rate with respect to the cumulative number of infections can be lower than

267

the maximum rate. Contact rates for inoculated hosts can have a substantial impact on

268

the outcomes of vaccination campaigns. Even a brief and moderate limitation of

269

contacts in this well-defined population can potentially mitigate epidemics. These results

270

might merit consideration for an immediate, practical public health response.

Figure 1. The Model. A. Schematic of the 7 compartment model with three susceptible,

345

three infected, and one recovered compartments. B. Simulated epidemics for

346

k I=[0.15,0.175,0.2(solid line),0.225,0.25], α=0.001, β=0.01 C. The ratio of cumulative

347

escape infections to all cumulative infections for an epidemic over a range of α.

348

β=[0.5,0.67,0.83,1], darker color indicates higher value, k I=0.2. The dotted line specifies

349

the benchmark value of α=0.001.

Figure 2. Optimal Vaccine Distribution. A. The cumulative number of infections

352

relative to no vaccination, RNull, for a range of vaccine initiations and distribution rates.

353

Here β is low, 0.01. B. The cumulative number of infections relative to no vaccination,

354

RNull, for a range of vaccine initiations and distribution rates and a large β (0.875). A/B.

355

3840 values were computed for each panel and 4x by 4x bilinearly interpolated points

356

are displayed. C. The cumulative number of infections relative to no vaccination, RNull,

357

for β=[0.75(dotted),0.875(dashed),1(solid)] and three relative contact rates,

358

q=[0.2(brown),1(black),5(gray)]. D. Simulated epidemics comparing a high fixed rate of

359

vaccination, k V=0.03 (solid) representing the inoculation of 3% of Naïve hosts per day,

360

and the optimal vaccination rate for each condition (dashed). β=0.875 is fixed and

361

q=[0.2(brown),1(black),5(gray)]. E. Same as D. with a low fixed rate of vaccination,

362

k V=0.01. C/D/E. The minima for the dashed lines in C correspond to the dashed lines in

363

D/E.

364
365

Figure 3. Post-vaccination contacts. A. The cumulative number of infections relative

366

to no vaccination, RNull, for a range of β and q, optimizing k V for each condition. B. Same

367

as in A. for fixed k V=0.03 representing the inoculation of 3% of Naïve hosts per day. C.

368

Same as in A. for the case where all Naïve hosts are immediately inoculated. D. Log of

369

the effective k I, k Ieff, relative to k I=0.2, the benchmark, vs. log of q for β=[0.5 (dotted

370

line), 0.7 (dashed line), 1 (solid line)]. E. The cumulative number of infections relative to

371

RNull and q=1 scaled by the fraction of infections due to vaccine escape,
