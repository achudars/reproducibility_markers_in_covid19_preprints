Abstract
The recent outbreak of the Covid-19 suggests a rather long latent phase that precludes
public health officials to predict the pandemic transmission on time. Here we apply mass action
laws and chemical transition theory to propose a kinetic model that accounts for viral
transmission dynamics at the latent phase. This model is useful for authorities to make early
preventions and control measurements that stop the spread of a deadly new virus.

Introduction
Starting at the end of 2019, the outbreak of a new coronavirus has caused hundreds of
infections in a central city of Hubei Province in China. The mega city (Wuhan) is designed as a
major high-speed railway transportation hub with a population of 15 million civilians. Due to
the large migration of people to celebrate the Chinese lunar New year (also called Spring
Festival, Jan 25 of 2020), the virus spreads rapidly in Wuhan and neighboring cities. This new
coronavirus (2019-nCoV) could cause severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) with lung
damage [1]. The early onset of the SARIs was initially characterized as ‘non-transmissible’
among humans by the local government and health specialist. But later was corrected to

‘transmissible’ among humans. Public health authorities and expert flew to Wuhan and
announced a first-grade infectious disease alarm: major railways, airport and bus stations were
locked down to reduce every possible chance of virus transmission. Tens of hundreds of people
were suspected to be infected by this virus and require hospitalization and special health care
in Wuhan. However, large populations of the local patient could not be hospitalized due to the
limited medical resources, worsening the pandemics at the worst possible time of the year
(Spring Festival). The entire nation was in panic and worry about the spread of the virus;
populations with pneumonia-like symptoms or Wuhan travel history were quarantined, flights
and railway transportation were suspended around the nation, and new health centers
specialized in infectious disease were constructed to accommodate the daily-increasing
patients.
Up to date, epidemiologists and health care professionals have used a number of
mathematical models to predict the consequence and infection trajectories of the virus
outbreak. Both kinetics [2, 3] and statistics-based [4, 5] models have predicted the basic
reproduction number ranging from 2.0 to 4.0, which signify an alarming sign to designate this
new virus as ‘highly transmissible and communicable’. In the past few days, the population of
the infected people increased dramatically in Wuhan and other cities of China, due to the
relative long latent period of this new virus. Latency period is defined as the time between
infection with a virus and the appearance of symptoms. The accurate estimation of the latency
period determines which kind of control measurement actions the health officials and
governments should take. Latency period can also be used to predict the population of the
people who is exposed to the virus but not yet converted to diseased state. The dormant virus

is still active and transmissible, which is a hidden factor that brings about the most
unpredictability and uncertainty of the current models.

Chemical transition model development
Latency period is the transition from ‘exposed state’ to ‘diseased state’, which is the
rate-limiting step of the disease transmission process. In the fundamental elements of chemical
reaction theory, chemical transition state is generally applicable to most of radicals or
intermediate complex-associated reactions, including examples of photoactivation reaction or
enzyme catalysis. Because of the synergy between the latent period of the ‘exposed population’
and the chemical transition of complex reactions, we here propose a viral transmission model
that mimics the encounter complex state of virus to predict the exposed population, which we
termed as SM* (Fig. 1), to describe the ‘exposed population’ at the latent period. The active
virus source M* can be released from both the infected (I) and the exposed population (SM*),
but not the deceased population D (assuming complete containment of this category). A
simplified 7-step transmission mechanism has been exemplified in Fig. 1. Step 1 describes how
fast a normal population could be converted to susceptible population who is at risk of
infection. Step 2 describes the virus-releasing kinetics of infected people, with each infected
people releasing n virus or virus-contaminated subjects (i.e. aerosols). Step 3 describes the
infection kinetics of the susceptible people that is converted to an ‘exposed population’ at the
latent phase. A reversible mechanism is proposed here since some of the exposed population
didn’t develop symptoms and could naturally return to the susceptible state. Step 4 describes
the infection kinetics of the exposed population that is converted to infectious state. Step 5 and
step 6 describe the recovery and death kinetics from the infectious population, respectively.

Step 7 describes the decay kinetics of the active viral carrier to an inactive viral carrier. With
fundamental mass action laws, we have formulated eight differential equations (Eqn1 to Eqn8)
to describe the viral transmission kinetics based on the 7-step infectious mechanism. The mass
balance of total populations (Ntot) and the total viral transmissible media (Mtot) were
conseved by Eqn. 9 and Eqn. 10, respectively.

Latent transmission dynamics prediction
With the recently reported cases of infection, death rate and exposed population, we
used a set of parameters to simulate the model and predict the pandemic trajectory. In
particular, our model is able to predict the trend of exposed population who is in the latent
phase, and the total number of active viral source that remain infectious in the community (Fig.

2). We also introduced a migration rate (alpha = 0.1 people/week, which is unrealistically small
in the current model) to describe potential flow of people moving into the system. With about
0.83 weeks of latency period ( /ସ ,  ସ is 1.20/week in Fig. 2), we predict that the peak
latent population is about 56,100 cases on Feb. 20th (0.5 week), and peak population of infected
people is about 91,000 cases around March. 10th (3.3 weeks). Around March 15th (4 weeks), the
number of active virial carrier start declining (Fig. 2) and 57.7% of the infected population will
be cured or recovered. A projected deceased population is about 3,750 at a time window of 20
weeks (on June 5th).
By considering the latency period factor, this model is also useful to predict the dynamic
trajectory of the population at the latent phase (Fig. 3). The latent population with a 10-week
latency period (88,500 cases) is about 75.2% higher than the latent population (about 50,500
cases) with a 0.67-week latency period; as a result (Fig. 3). With a 10-week latency period, the

latent population (88,500 cases) is about 2.1-fold than the infected population (42,000 cases).
However, the peak population of the infected people (91,000 cases) is 80.2% higher than the
latent population (about 50,500 cases) with a 0.67-week latency period (Fig. 3). This result
indicates that a rather long latency period decreases the total number of infected people, and
the peak infection population is also postponed (Fig. 3). This prediction suggests that we must
have an accurate estimation of the latency period before any coercive or preventative actions
be taken. Based on the current report from different regions in China, it appears that some of
the exposed people haven’t shown any symptoms up to 2~3 weeks [6], but this latent
population will keep spreading the virus and transmitting the disease, a more severe
transmission than the SARS pandemic in 2003 [7]. This uncertainty of the latency period
complicates the infection measurements and may deteriorate the situation where people
thought they have taken enough precautions to prevent the next outbreak of the virus.
This simplified infectious disease transmission model takes into consideration of the
latency period. The accurate prediction of the latency period will be critical for public health
officials and authorities to make early preventions and take rigorous control measurements
that stop the further spread of this deadly new virus.

ODE45 solver. Matlab code has been compiled into the supplementary file. Parameters (death
rate constant of 0.004 people/week is used) were obtained by estimating the confirmed
infection, death and recovered population reported by the officials. Our simulation is run with a
constant migrate rate alpha = 0.1 people/week and a total population is confined at 120,000.
The model can be scaled up to a real city, if accurate estimation of the kinetic parameter is
feasible.
