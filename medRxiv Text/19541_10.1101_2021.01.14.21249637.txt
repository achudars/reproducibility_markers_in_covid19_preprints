Abstract

21
22

Background

23

Some aspects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

24

transmission in children and adults remain unclear. This report describes different

25

SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns by age group in Japan.

26

Methods and findings

27

This retrospective observational case series study analyzed transmission patterns of

28

real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections

29

found by local health authorities and commercial laboratories during January 14 through

30

July 31, 2020 in Japan. After ascertaining the infection source for every symptomatic

31

case as clusters at households, daycare facilities, schools, hospitals and workplaces etc.,

32

their associated transmission patterns were analyzed. Identified cases were divided into

33

three groups: underage, < 20; adults, 20–59; and elderly people 60 years old and older.

34

The reproductive number (R)s of respective transmission directions found for the

35

respective age groups were compared.

36

Of 26,986 total cases, 23,746 unknown cases were found, leaving 3,240 ascertained

37

sources of infection (12.0%) comprising 125 (3.9%) underage, 2350 (72.5%) adult, and

38

765 (23.6%) elderly people. The respective Rs of underage infection sources directed to

39

underage, adult, and elderly people were estimated respectively as 0.0415 (95% CI,

40

0.0138–0.0691), 1.11 (95% CI, 0.9171–1.3226), and 0.2811 (95% CI, 0.2074–0.3687).

41

The respective Rs of adult infection source directed to underage, adult, and elderly

42

people were estimated respectively as 0.0140 (95% CI, 0.0120–0.0162), 0.5392 (95%

43

CI, 0.5236–0.5550), and 0.1135 (95% CI, 0.1074–0.1197). The respective Rs of elderly

44

infection source directed to underage, adult, and elderly people were estimated as 0.065

45

(95% CI, 0.0039–0.0091), 0.3264 (95% CI, 0.3059–0.3474), and 0.3991 (95% CI,

46

0.3757–0.4229).

47

Conclusions

48

The main sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection were adults and elderly people. The R of

49

underage people directed to adults was greater than 1 because of close familial contact

50

but they were unlikely to become carriers transmitting SARS-CoV-2 because they

51

accounted for a minority for transmissions. Apparently, SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted

52

among adults and elderly people, suggesting that infection control of SARS-CoV-2

53

should be managed specifically by generation.

Introduction

61

At the beginning of the spread of the novel coronavirus infection, isolation and life

62

restrictions imposed on all age groups were necessary measures to prevent the spread of

63

novel viruses of unknown identity, to ascertain the pathogenicity, and to avoid difficult

64

conditions of medical care. However, the long-term negative socioeconomic effects of

65

these measures have also been considerable [1]. Adverse effects on education and

66

exercise restrictions, especially for minors, are unfathomable. Nationwide surveys

67

investigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns among children, adolescents, adults,

68

and elderly people in Japan have probably brought about a new age-dependent isolation

69

strategy without the spread of viral infection.

70

In Japan, since the first person infected with the novel coronavirus was identified on

71

January 15, 2020, 4,314,979 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus disease

72

(COVID-19) had been recorded by December 27, 2020. The death toll had risen to

73

3,212 in Japan by December 27, 2020. Of 202,128 infection cases, 12,209 (6.0%) were

74

of young people aged 10–19; 4,743 (2.3%) were of people younger than 10 years old on

75

December 23, 2020 [2]. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous countries

76

have implemented public health and social measures (PHSM), including school closure

77

[3]. The Japanese government asked all schools and kindergartens to close from March

78

2, 2020 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Until the end of May, infection

79

continued to spread mainly among adults and elderly people. This generation-specific

80

interview survey of available nationwide data was conducted to ascertain infection

81

sources and transmission in Japan, particularly to elucidate the actual circumstances of

82

intergenerational infection and Japan’s strategic approach to respond to COVID-19.

83
84

Methods

85

To conduct a retrospective observational case series study analyzing publicly

86

available anonymous reports, we accessed information from local health authorities'

87

reports released for January 15, 2020 through July 31, 2020 in Japan. Cases were

88

confirmed as SARS CoV-2 positive using RT-PCR testing by local health authorities, or

89

using RT-PCR testing or other molecular testing with processing by commercial

90

laboratories. Health center staff in each prefecture investigated the status of contact with

91

each SARS CoV-2 infected person, identified the infection source, and reported it to

92

their respective health authorities. The results are posted on the website of each

93

prefecture and are accessible by anyone. To identify asymptomatic persons, it is

94

necessary to examine all the members in clusters accurately. Invariably only a part of

95

them can be acquired. Therefore, asymptomatic persons were excluded.

96

After excluding asymptomatic persons, we ascertained whether each symptomatic

97

SARS-CoV-2-positive-confirmed person was a source of infection in a cluster at homes,

98

schools, and daycare facilities during January 15, 2020 – July 31, 2020. Different

99

distributions of sources of infection were analyzed by generation. Statistical analyses

100

were applied using software (R ver.5). Using available information related to January 15,

101

2020 – April 24, 2020, we retrospectively identified cases in which a child transmitted

102

the virus to other children in clusters at daycare facilities. Because this is a case series

103

study and because information to use was available from the websites of all prefectures

104

in Japan, no approval by an ethical committee was necessary.

105

For this study, xi,j was defined as the number of patients in i age group who were

106

infected from patients of the j age group. Particularly, i(j) = 1 represents an age class

107

younger than 20 years old, 2 denotes the age group of patients who were 20 years old or

108

elder than 20 years old and younger than 60 years old, and 3 stands for an age group of

109

people older than 60 years old. Additionally, i=4 represents patients whose source of

110

infection was unidentified.

111

The source of infection of most patients was unidentified. Therefore, we assumed

112

that the age distribution of source of infection (xi,1,xi,2 and xi,3) was the same among

113

patients whose source of infection was not identified (xi,4). Then, we arranged the Table

114

as yi,j= xi,j Σk=14 xi,k/Σk=13 xi,k for i(j)=1,2, and 3.

115

For this study, Ri,j which represents the effective reproduction number of the j age

116

group infection to the i age group was defined as yi,j/Σk=13 yj,k . As one might expect, it

117

was correct when i and j were not the same. However, if i and j were the same, patients

118

were also probably the source of infection to patients of the same age group. Therefore,

119

double counting occurred in the infected patients and source of infection. Ri,i cannot be

120

defined correctly using this procedure.

121

The confidence interval (CI) of Ri,j was estimated using the following method.

122

Because we do not know the probability that a patient infected one patient, the

123

probability that a patient infected two patients, or more patients, we presumed that these

124

were p, p2, p3, and so on. Then Ri,j= p+2p2+3p3+…=Σk=1 k p k=p/(1-p)2. Therefore, we

125

can convert Ri,j to p uniquely. We denoted pi,j as converted from Ri,j. We estimated its CI

126

through bootstrapping. We first draw M=Σk=13 yj,k .random numbers of the uniform

127

distribution on (0,1) from the generator. We designate it as zm (m=1,2,…Σk=13 yj,k ). If zm

128

<pi,j, then the m-th patients infected more than one patient. Similarly, if zm <pi,j2, then the

129

m-th patient infected more than two patients, and so on. Therefore, Σk=1k 1[zm < pi,jk]

130

was the estimated number of people infected by the m-th patient, where the function of

131

1[ ] was one if [ ] was true and zero otherwise. Similarly, Σm=1MΣk=1k 1[zm < pi,jk] was

132

one of the bootstrapped Ri,j . We repeated this procedure one million times. Then we

133

obtained the one million estimator of Ri,j. We sorted these variables. The duration from

134

the first 25 thousandth Ri,j to the last 25 thousandth Ri, should be CI of Ri,j.

Results

137

The status of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks up to November 17, 2020 is presented in

138

Figure 1. The period of school closures from March 2 to the end of May 2020 and that

139

of the state of emergency when the Japanese government was asking people in Japan to

140

stay home as much as possible to prevent the spread of the coronavirus is shown in

141

Figure 2. Symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive-confirmed persons are

142

also shown in Figure 2, which shows a small number of people with symptoms and

143

most people as asymptomatic and under investigation. The SARS-CoV-2 confirmed

144

cases comprised those of three patient age groups: underage people under 20 years old;

145

adults 20–59 years old; and elderly people 60 years old and older. Of the 26,986 cases

146

of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed from January 14 through July 31, 2020, 3,240 were

147

ascertained as sources of infection. Of them, 125 (3.9%) were of underage people, 2,350

148

(72.5%) were of adults, and 765 (23.6%) were of elderly people (Table 1). It was

149

impossible to ascertain if the remaining 23,746 of the 26,986 cases were sources of

Reproductive numbers (R) of sources of SARS-Co-V2 infection were estimated for

166

three age groups (Table 2). The respective R numbers of underage sources of infection

167

showing the direction of transmission to underage people, adult people, and elderly

168

people, estimated as 0.0415 (95% CI, 0.0138–0.0691), 1.11 (95% CI, 0.9171–1.3226),

169

and 0.2811 (95% CI, 0.2074–0.3687). The respective R numbers of adult source of

170

infection showing the direction of transmission to underage people, adult people, and

171

elderly people were estimated as 0.0140 (95% CI, 0.0120–0.0162), 0.5392 (95% CI,

172

0.5236–0.5550), and 0.1135 (95% CI, 0.1074–0.1197). The respective R numbers of

Discussion
We investigated details of SARS-CoV-2 transmission modes in Japan. Data in this

212

paper constitute a compilation of information of symptomatic SARS CoV-2 infected

213

persons published by prefectures. No other summary regarding infection sources has

214

been reported in Japan.

215

This report is the first of a study elucidating age-dependent distribution differences

216

of infection sources for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Japan. We assessed detailed

217

descriptions in reports of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases in schools,

218

kindergartens and daycare facilities, companies and offices, etc. through July 31, 2020.

219

The respective Rs of transmission from adults and elderly people were less than 1. The

220

R from the underage group for adult patients confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive

221

was 1.11. Only this combination was found to be greater than 1. The R numbers in the

222

transmission clusters for which we were able to identify the infection source were

223

almost all less than 1.

224

The basic reproduction number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was first estimated as around

225

2.2 (90% high density interval: 1.4–3.8) in China [4]. The R0 was estimated as 2.56 in

226

Japan, with 95% CI of [2.51, 2.96] before school closure [5]. In the case of outbreak of

227

COVID-19 in the Princess Cruise ship, an estimate of the mean reproduction number in

228

the confined setting reached values as high as approximately 11 [6]. The highest

229

reproductive number was reported for the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship in Japan

230

(14.8); the estimated summary reproductive number was 2.87 (95% CI, 2.39–3.44 [7].

231

It is noteworthy that the R numbers of underage people as infection sources from

232

the COVID-19 patients in all age groups were lower than those of adults and elderly

233

people. Rarity of underage people of SARS-CoV-2 transmission was found. When we

234

identified patients as sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitals, clinics and day care

235

facilities, family members, and companies each accounted for approximately one-third

236

of the infected area. Results show that the age distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection

237

sources reflects different social age-related activities. It became very difficult to

238

ascertain the infection source and the age group of infected persons because of the

239

dramatic increase in infection in adults. It remained in the very early stages of the

240

pandemic. Unfortunately, it was not possible to ascertain the infection source and the

241

age group of the infected person by type of labor during this pandemic. It might be

242

possible to do it after the end of the pandemic in the future, but it can not be done in

243

time as a countermeasure for the ongoing epidemic. Therefore, the purpose for this

244

study was to reach a certain conclusion for an analyzable research period.

245

The Japan Pediatric Society reported the Current Status of Medical Findings on

246

Novel Coronavirus Infections in Children on May 7, 2020. Findings up to the present

247

day for COVID-19 indicate that it is unlikely to spread in clusters at schools and at

248

group care facilities, as it does for influenza which is a severe disease that mainly

249

affects children [8]. In our study, only four probands under the age of 20 were the

250

source of infection for persons under the age of 20 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2

251

positivity (Table 1a). Although data for positive cases in schools are limited, they have

252

not demonstrated a remarkable degree of transmission. In one pediatric case, a child

253

visited three schools while symptomatic, but did not transmit the virus to any of 112

254

people who had close contact with him, suggesting that children might not be an

255

important source of virus transmission [9]. Gradually, it has been clarified that children

256

can escape SARS COV-2 infection well [10, 11].

257

Children mainly transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to family members. In fact, from a study

258

using epidemiologic data, 95.59% (65 of 68) of infected children were found to have

259

been infected through household contact with adults [12]. A study of the dynamics of

260

SARS-CoV-2 transmission within families has indicated that children are less likely to

261

show SARS-CoV-2 positive results than coresident adults are [13]. In addition to this

262

evidence, our study of cases and their infected and uninfected close contacts provide

263

key insights supporting epidemiologic studies of SARS-CoV-2. Household contacts

264

were the main transmission mode including children, but children rarely spread the

265

virus to other children and teachers at schools, kindergartens, and nursery schools. The

266

main source of infection in society is not children, but adults or senior patients with

267

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Illness and mortality rate data vary from country to country.

268

Therefore, policies can also be expected to vary. However, because this infection is

269

mainly an adult disease, infection control of this virus should be conducted specifically

270

by generation. SARS-CoV-2 infection among children is apparently controlled

271

sufficiently for school settings. Additional studies should be conducted to ascertain if

272

school life can be undertaken safely as schools open gradually. Although schools in

273

Japan have opened in earnest, household transmission was identified as a dominant

274

route of students [14]. We hope that policies will be chosen based on carefully analyzed

275

data from epidemiological surveys.

276

This study presents several important limitations. The most important limitation of

277

this paper is that it analyzes only symptomatic individuals. This is true because, to study

278

asymptomatic persons around the infected person, it is necessary to examine all the

279

contact persons of the infected person, so that only a part of the relation is invariably

280

acquired. As a result, the proportion of infected individuals is significantly lower than

281

that of symptomatic individuals. A simple sum of the two does not make sense.

282

However, it has been suggested that SARS Co-V2 is highly infectious even among

283

asymptomatic individuals. It cannot be ruled out that the asymptomatic epidemic might

284

spread in schools or nurseries if the proportion of asymptomatic children is high and

285

their infectivity is high. To confirm this point, continuous inspection of all children and

286

children at school or nursery school is necessary. No such design findings in the future

287

have been published at this time. Apparently, future consideration is necessary.

288

Second, the data we used were based solely on information obtained through interviews

289

by health center staff. Necessarily, not all information was disclosed. Analyses were

290

conducted as well as possible given the limited data which were obtained. However,

291

there were 506 unknown cases other than the 341 determined cases as sources of

292

infection. Moreover, we did not measure viral loads in COVID-19 patients in these

293

transmission clusters. Further studies should be conducted based on data accumulated

294

during a longer period until the end of the second or third wave of imported COVID-19

295

cases in Japan. Third, because of widespread school closures during this study, most

296

opportunities for infection among children were avoided in the first place, which might

297

have contributed to the results. Of course, it cannot be denied that the chances of

298

infection among children might have decreased because of school closures and closures

299

of kindergartens. However, contact opportunities at home do not change because of

300

these closures, or by refraining from going out. Rather, the frequency of contact over

301

the ages would probably increase. In addition, contact opportunities outside of schools,

302

kindergartens, and nursery schools were not eliminated completely. It is noteworthy that

303

the examination in this paper under such circumstances is an interpretation. Therefore,

304

the conclusions in this paper will not actually hold true when schools or nurseries are

305

reopened. However, the virus is expected to be spread mainly among adults.

306

Although the only R higher than 1 was found to be that of underage people showing

307

the direction of transmission to adults, underage people constituted only a minority of

308

infected cases. Adults and elderly people were widely infected with SARS-CoV-2. The

309

main source of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not children, but rather adults and elderly

310

people infected with SARS-CoV-2. Establishment of new age-dependent isolation

311

strategies to avoid spreading the viral infection are highly anticipated. Because adults

312

transmit the disease easily to humans, if an adult infected person is found, an adult close

313

contact who is likely to become severely infected should be examined. If infected, an

314

isolation policy is taken. However, children are less likely to become severely ill and are

315

less likely to transmit the virus to similarly underaged people and elderly people. For

316

that reason, their isolation policy warrants some consideration. Only children with close

317

contact to an infected underage person with SARS-CoV-2 should be isolated and

318

inspected. Further studies are now being conducted based on data from COVID-19

319

cases accumulated over a longer period of time in Japan.
