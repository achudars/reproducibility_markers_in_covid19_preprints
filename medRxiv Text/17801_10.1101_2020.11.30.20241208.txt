ABSTRACT

25
26

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2

27

(SARS-CoV-2), has grown into worst public health crisis since the 1918 influenza pandemic.

28

As COVID-19 continues to spread around the world, there is urgent need for a rapid, yet

29

accurate antibody test to identify infected individuals in populations to inform health

30

decisions. We have developed a rapid, accurate and cost-effective serologic test based on

31

antibody-dependent agglutination of antigen-coated latex particles, which uses ~5 μl plasma

32

and takes <5 min to complete with no instrument required. The simplicity of this test makes it

33

ideal for point-of-care (POC) use at the community level. When validated using plasma

34

samples that are positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2, the agglutination assay detected

35

antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of the spike (S-RBD) or the nucleocapsid (N)

36

protein of SARS-CoV-2 with 100% specificity and ~98% sensitivity. Furthermore, we found

37

that the strength of the S-RBD antibody response measured by the agglutination assay

38

correlated with the efficiency of the plasma in blocking RBD binding to the angiotensin

39

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in a surrogate neutralization assay, suggesting that the

40

agglutination assay may be used to identify individuals with virus-neutralizing antibodies.

41

Intriguingly, we found that >92% of patients had detectable antibodies on the day of positive

42

viral RNA test, suggesting that seroconversion may occur earlier than previously thought and

43

that the agglutination antibody test may complement RNA testing for POC diagnosis of

44

SARS-CoV-2 infection.

INTRODUCTION

47
48

Development of rapid point-of-care COVID-19 diagnostics for use at the community level

49

remains a top priority in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic1. While capacity for

50

detecting SARS-CoV-2 based on nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) has grown immensely

51

and enabled effective public health responses, serologic testing for virus specific antibodies

52

has not gained the same widespread application, due to concerns over sensitivity, specificity,

53

cost and turn-around time1,2. Although NAAT is the current gold standard for diagnosing

54

acute infection, it is not effective in identifying individuals who have recovered from

55

previous infection3. Given that approximately 40% of infected individuals remain

56

asymptomatic1,4,5, large-scale antibody testing could help better establish the true extent of

57

the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying disease hotspots and high-risk populations to enable

58

more effective isolation and contact tracing1,3,6. Moreover, antibody testing may identify

59

individuals with a strong neutralizing antibody response who may be suitable donors for

60

convalescent plasma/serum therapy for the treatment of those with severe symptoms7.

61
62

To date, a number of antibody tests have been approved for emergency use in the US and

63

Europe. These tests detect the IgG, IgM or IgA antibody against the spike (including the

64

receptor binding domain, RBD) or nucleocapsid (N) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by

65

enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)3. ELISA-based antibody tests, which can be

66

qualitative or quantitative, require specialized instruments and are usually performed in a lab

67

by a trained technician. The sensitivity and specificity of different ELISA kits vary widely8-10.

68

To enable point-of-care (POC) testing, several rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) based on lateral

69

flow have been developed. Although the RDTs reduced the time of the antibody test to 10-30

70

minutes from 2-5 hours (for ELISA), they generally suffer from decreased sensitivity and

71

specificity compared to ELISA-based assays1,11-13.

72
73

To address the pressing need for a simple, rapid, yet accurate antibody test1, we resorted to the

74

tested-and-proven serology method of agglutination that has been used in blood typing and

75

antibody testing14-16. We show here that the agglutination of red blood cells (RBCs) or latex

76

particles induced by specific antigen-antibody interaction affords a highly sensitive and

77

accurate assay for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We validated the antibody assay based on latex

78

particle agglutination using 169 plasma samples that were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by

3

79

NAAT, 121 samples that were NAAT negative and 100 SARS-CoV-2 naïve plasma samples.

80

The agglutination-based antibody assay produced 100% specificity and 97-98.2% sensitivity.

81

Because this simple assay requires no instrument and generates results in 2 minutes, it has the

82

potential to be used as a POC or at-home test.

83
84

RESULTS

85
86

Agglutination-based serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

87
88

Agglutination of RBCs is widely used in blood typing whereas latex particle agglutination

89

assays have been used to detect antibodies against a variety of different viruses. We sought to

90

establish whether either or both approaches could be adapted for SARS-CoV-2 antibody

91

testing. In principle, coating the RBCs or the latex particles with a SARS-CoV-2 specific

92

antigen would enable their respective agglutination by the corresponding antibody (Fig. 1).

93

To explore this notion, we labelled Group O (R2R2) RBCs carrying the D antigen with the

94

spike RBD (S-RBD) or the RNA binding domain of the nucleocapsid (N-RBD) protein

95

through streptavidin-biotin mediated coupling (Figs. S1 & S2, see Materials and Methods for

96

details). Incubating the antigen-coated RBCs with COVID-19+ plasma led to robust

97

agglutination whereas the COVID-19- plasma failed to induce RBC agglutination, suggesting

98

that the aggregation of the S-RBD/N-RBD-coated RBCs may be used to detect antibody

99

response to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. S2).

100
101

To develop a cost-effective agglutination assay, we next investigated if latex particles were a

102

suitable substitute for the RBCs. To this end, we coated latex particles with recombinant

103

S-RBD or the full-length nucleocapsid (N) protein (Fig. S1). The antigen coated latex beads

104

were first tested with a monoclonal anti-S-RBD and a polyclonal anti-nucleocapsid antibody.

105

Upon incubating with the corresponding antibody, the antigen-coated latex particles formed

106

clumps within two minutes. Importantly, the area of clump formation grew larger with

107

increasing antibody concentrations (Fig. S3). Although latex agglutination was commonly

108

used as a qualitative assay, it is possible to determine the degree of agglutination based on the

109

area of clump formation via image analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, the percentage of

110

agglutination for both the S-RBD- and N-coated latex particles increased when an

111

incremental amount of anti-S-RBD or anti-N antibody was added. Fitting the data to Hill’s

4

112

equation yielded Hill’s coefficient of 1.7 for the former and 1.8 for the latter. This suggests

113

that the antibody-induced agglutination of latex particles is a cooperative event (Fig. 2A&B).

114
115

We next examined if the latex agglutination assay could be used to gauge COVID-19

116

antibody response. Using plasma samples from patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by

117

NAAT and confirmed for strong antibody response by ELISA, we found that the patient

118

plasma samples were not only capable of inducing agglutination of the S-RBD- or N-coated

119

latex particles, they did so in a concentration-dependent manner. As shown in Fig. 2C&D, the

120

extent of agglutination decreased as the plasma was diluted, indicating that the agglutination

121

assay may be used to estimate antibody titer as in an ELISA-based antibody test.

122
123

The latex agglutination-based antibody assay showed high sensitivity and specificity

124
125

To validate the antibody test based on latex particle agglutination, we carried out

126

agglutination assays for 290 residual plasma samples from individuals that were tested

127

positive (169) or negative (121) for virus RNA by the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 test9. To

128

assess specificity, we also included 100 virus-naïve samples banked in 2018 in our

129

agglutination assay. None of the 121 SARS-CoV-2- or the 100 Pre-COVID-19 plasma

130

samples was capable of promoting the agglutination of either the S-RBD- or N-coated latex

131

particles, indicating 100% specificity for the agglutination assay (Table 1). In contrast, of the

132

169 SARS-CoV-2+ plasma samples tested, 166 (98.2%) promoted agglutination in response

133

to the S-RBD antigen and 164 (97%) to the N antigen, with overall sensitivity of 98.2%. We

134

compared the latex agglutination assay with the Euroimmune IgG test for the S antibody and

135

the Roche Elecsys® Total assay for the N antibody using the same set of SARS-CoV-2+

136

plasma samples and found that the latex agglutination assay outperformed both ELISA-based

137

antibody tests (Table 2). The agglutination assay also exhibited better specificity than either

138

ELISA kit (Table 2). Quantification of the agglutination data showed that the COVID-19+

139

group is significantly different from the COVID-19- or pre-COVID-19 group, indicating that

140

the latex agglutination assay effectively distinguished SARS-CoV2+ from SARS-CoV2-

141

individuals (Fig. 3A&B).

142
143

Based on the background signals of the COVID-19- samples (0-4% agglutination for both

144

S-RBD- and N-coated latex particles), we set 5% agglutination as the cut-off for antibody

145

positivity. To facilitate the use of the latex agglutination assay as a simple, semi-quantitative

146

antibody test, we developed a numerical scoring system for antibody response. We assigned

147

the scores 1, 2, 3 and 4 to samples that produced 5-25%, 25-50%, 50-75% and >75%

148

agglutination, respectively (Fig. S4). We found that this scoring scheme effectively

149

distinguished samples with strong antibody response from those with medium or weak ones

150

(Fig. 3C&D). The agglutination score may be readily assigned by visual inspection and

151

comparing to reference wells containing a predetermined amount of pure anti-S-RBD or

152

anti-N antibody (Fig. S3).

153
154

The S-RBD antibody response correlated with neutralizing antibody titer

155
156

Because neutralizing antibodies (Nab) play a pivotal role in the humoral immune response to

157

the virus17, we next examined if the S-RBD antibody response determined by the

158

agglutination assay correlated with neutralization efficiency. We developed a surrogate

159

neutralization assay by measuring the efficacy of patient plasma in blocking S-RBD binding

160

to its host receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in vitro. Similar approaches

161

have been used by others to evaluate neutralization efficiency of patient plasma or therapeutic

162

antibodies18,19. Briefly, binding of biotinylated ACE2 to immobilized S-RBD is detected by

163

ELISA through HRP-conjugated streptavidin. The presence of neutralizing antibody would

164

block this interaction, resulting in reduction of the ELISA signal. Using this surrogate

165

neutralization assay, we found that the neutralization efficiency increased with the

166

agglutination score for the S-RBD antibody (Fig. 4A). Intriguingly, comparison of samples

167

with distinct S-RBD and N antibody responses indicated that the neutralization efficiency

168

was significantly correlated with the S-RBD, but not the N antibody strength. This is not

169

surprising given that the nucleocapsid is not involved in mediating virus entry into the host

170

cells via ACE2. Nevertheless, it remains to be determined if the plasma with strong N

171

antibody response would confer immunity by inhibiting virus replication in vivo.

172
173

The agglutination assay allowed for early antibody detection and tracking of dynamic

174

antibody response

175
176

We noted that the agglutination assay detected antibody response in >92% plasma samples

177

collected on the day of SARS-CoV2+ diagnosis by NAAT and in 100% samples on day 2 and

178

afterward. This is in stark contrast to the 47% to 83% sensitivity for ELISA-based antibody

179

tests on samples collected within 7 days of positive NAAT9. The superb sensitivity of the

180

latex agglutination assay suggests that it may be used to detect antibody response in the early

181

stage of virus infection and monitor its dynamic changes over time12,20,21. Using serial blood

182

samples from SARS-CoV-2+ patients, we compared the changes in the S-RBD and N

183

antibody responses between days 1 and day 3 (Fig. 4C&D). We found that the majority of

184

patients showed detectable S-RBD and/or N antibodies on NAAT+ day 1. Moreover, the

185

antibody titer increased significantly on day 3 compared to day 1. Because it is not possible

186

to determine how long these patients had contracted the virus prior to the NAAT test,

187

seroconversion might have occurred for some on the day of diagnosis. Nevertheless, we were

188

able to detect anti-S-RBD or anti-N antibodies on day 3 for several patients who showed no

189

detectable antibody on day 1, suggesting seroconversion occurred rapidly in these patients4.

190

Taken together, these data suggest that the latex agglutination assay may be used to diagnose

191

active infection in conjunction with NAAT. Combined antibody and RNA testing may

192

increase the sensitivity of the later. Moreover, the agglutination-based antibody test may be

193

used to monitor the evolvement of humoral immune reaction in infected individuals over

194

time.

195
196

DISCUSSION

197
198

Antibody testing offers an additional and much needed tool for managing the COVID-19

199

pandemic, which may allow for rapid and cost-effective POC diagnosis to facilitate treatment

200

and public health responses. Furthermore, antibody testing may play an important role in

201

identifying individuals who have gained protective immunity from previous exposure or

202

immunization programs. While the clinical trial results for several vaccine candidates are

203

encouraging, seroconversion is unlikely to occur for all vaccinated individuals22. A highly

204

sensitive and specific antibody test would allow for accurate assessment of humoral response

205

to a vaccine, and serial testing post-vaccination could indicate the duration of humoral

206

immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Such information will be invaluable to inform public health

207

decisions, both for directing resource allocation and determining response to vaccination.

208
209

While most serology tests used in the clinic are specific for a specific antibody isoform, IgG,

210

IgM or IgA, the latex agglutination antibody assay is, in principle, isotope-independent11.

211

This may contribute to its high sensitivity, especially on samples collected in the early phase

212

of infection when IgG isotope switching has not yet occurred. It has been shown that the IgM

213

antibody response proceeds that of IgG3,11, and the pentameric architecture of IgM may make

214

it a stronger promoter of agglutination than IgG. Moreover, the agglutination assay detects

215

antibodies against the spike (S) and the nucleocapsid (N) in parallel whereas most existing

216

assays are specific for either protein. These factors explain why the agglutination assay could

217

detect antibody in >92% plasma samples collected on the day of NAAT+ diagnosis and 100%

218

on day 2 and onwards whereas other antibody tests were less sensitive. The ability of our

219

assay to detect antibodies at the early stages of infection suggests that it may be used to

220

complement or confirm the diagnosis based on NAAT, which is prone to false positives or

221

false negatives especially when done only once23.

222
223

Several features of the agglutination assay make it an ideal candidate for POC or at-home

224

antibody testing. First, the assay is highly sensitive and accurate, with 100% specificity and

225

~98% sensitivity on the samples tested in this study. Importantly, it detected antibodies in >92%

226

COVID-19 patients on the day of diagnosis. This sensitivity rivals that of NAAT tests23.

227

Second, the agglutination test is fast. It takes two minutes from mixing the plasma with the

228

latex particles to getting the result. Third, the agglutination assay is simple to run and

229

instrument-free. As the formation of latex bead clumps is easy to identify by the naked eye, the

230

test may be performed without extensive specialized training. Fourth, because the

231

agglutination assay takes only ~5 μl plasma, it may be developed into a finger prick blood test

232

suitable for at-home use. Finally, the low cost of the latex agglutination assay makes it

233

universally affordable and ideal for antibody testing at the community or population level, in

234

high- and low-resource settings alike.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

289

Blood sample collection

290

Blood samples were collected following a protocol (study number: 116284) approved by the

291

Research Ethics Board (REB) of Western University. The plasma samples were de-identified

292

prior to transfer from the Laboratory of Clinical Medicine (London Health Sciences Center,

293

London, Canada) to a biosafety Level 3 (CL3) lab (ImPaKT, Western University) following

294

Transportation of Dangerous Goods (TDG) guidelines. All plasma samples were

295

heat-inactivated at 56 oC for 30 minutes at the ImPaKT CL3 facility as per Western university

296

biosafety regulation. Heat inactivated plasma samples were then transferred to the testing

297

laboratory. We tested the effect of heat inactivation on SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer and found

298

no significant impact of heat-inactivation (see also Fig. S5).

299

Recombinant protein production and purification

300

The expression plasmid for human ACE2 cloned into the mammalian expression vector pαH

301

(residues 1−615 with a C-terminal HRV3C protease cleavage site, a TwinStrepTag and an

302

8XHisTag) was a generous gift by Dr. McLellan. SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD cloned into pCAGGs

303

the expression vector was received from Dr. Harding's lab. SARS-CoV-2 N-RBD was cloned

304

into the pMCSG53 prokaryotic expression vector (residues 47-173-terminal 6x-His tag + TEV

305

protease cleavage site).

306
307

Recombinant ACE2 and S-RBD proteins were produced by transient transfection of Expi293F

308

cells (ThermoFisher Scientific, A14527) with a corresponding expression vectors and

309

FectoPRO® DNA transfection reagent (Polyplus-transfection® SA, Cat. #116-010).

310

Supernatants from transfected cells were harvested after 96 hours of the post-transfection time

311

by centrifugation of the culture at 65,000 RPM for 30 min at 4oC. Cleared supernatant was then

312

incubated with 4 ml TALON® Metal Affinity Resin (Takara Bio USA, Inc. Cat#635652) for 2h

313

at 40C. Ni-NTA chromatography was used to purify His-tagged recombinant proteins. Each

314

protein was dialyzed and concentrated in Amicon centrifugal units (EMD Millipore) in a final

315

buffer of 20mM HEPES (pH 7.5, 200mM NaCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol).

316
317

Recombinant N-RBD was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)-Gold. Ni-NTA chromatography

318

and size exclusion chromatography-Superdex S200 was used to purify N-RBD. The tag was

319

cleaved using TEV followed by dialysis. The N-RBD protein was resuspended in 0.1 M NaCl,

320

20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and stored at -80 oC until use. Recombinant nucleocapsid (residues

321

1-419) was obtained from RayBiotech (Cat #230-01104). Protein purity was confirmed by

322

SDS-PAGE (Fig. S1).

323

Preparation of SARS-CoV-2 antigen coated latex particles

324

Blue dyed polystyrene latex beads, 0.8 ߤm in diameter, were purchased from Sigma Aldrich

325

(L1398). Prior to use, the latex beads were washed according to the manufacturer’s

326

instructions with some modifications. Briefly, 2.5mL of 5% (w/v) latex suspension was

327

washed twice in 10 mL PBS buffer (135 mM NaCl, 2.6 mM KCl, 8 mM Na2HPO4, and 1.5

328

mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) by mixing and centrifuging the latex suspension at 3,000g for 10

329

minutes at room temperature. The beads were then resuspended with 2.5 ml 0.025M MES

330

buffer (2-(N-Morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid, pH 6.0) to obtain 5% (w/v) suspension.

331
332

SARS-CoV-2 antigen-latex particle conjugates were prepared by passive adsorption

333

following the procedures described by Mahat et al24, with some modifications. Briefly, 0.4

334

mL of 5% (w/v) latex suspension was centrifuged at 3,000 g for 5 minutes at room

335

temperature, and the supernatant was discarded. The beads were incubated with 200 μg

336

recombinant Receptor Binding Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-RBD)

337

(Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto) or the Nucleocapsid protein (N

338

protein) (RayBiotech, 230-01104) in 4 mL MES buffer. The mixture was allowed to incubate

339

for 24 hours at 4°C with periodic mixing. After conjugation, the antigen-latex bead conjugate

340

was centrifuged, and the supernatant was kept for determination of unabsorbed protein

341

concentration (Bio-Rad protein assay kit). The antigen-bead conjugate was washed twice

342

with PBS and blocked for 30 min at room temperature in PBS containing 3% bovine serum

343

albumin (BSA). The conjugate was then resuspended at 2.5% (w/v) in PBS containing 1%

344

BSA and stored at 4°C until use.

347
348

For the agglutination assay, 5 μl plasma was mixed with 25 μl antigen-coated beads (2.5%,

349

w/v) per assay. The agglutination was allowed to proceed for 2 min at room temperature

350

before imaging with a camera. The relative degree of agglutination induced by the

351

SARS-CoV-2 antibody was measured by the area of clump formation based on the

352

corresponding image. Agglutination data analyses were performed using qualitative and

353

semi-quantitative assessments. For semi-quantification of agglutination, the image analysis

354

software Qupath (v0.1.2) was used (https://qupath.github.io/) and quantification was done by

355

calculating the percentage of agglutination based on estimated agglutination/clumps area

356

(mm2) relative to the total latex reaction area. In qualitative assessments, agglutination

357

intensity was inspected visually, and agglutination score was assigned (i.e. 1, 2, 3 and 4).

358

Specifically, 1 corresponds to small clumps with ~25% agglutination, 2 (~50% agglutination),

359

3 (~75% agglutination), and 4 (large clumps that forms in less than 1 min with ~100%

360

agglutination). Based on data from the COVID-19 negative samples (including NAAT

361

negative and samples collected in 2018), the cut-off for positivity was set to 5% of

362

agglutination.

363

Preparation of red blood cells conjugated with SARS-CoV-2 antigen

364

The recombinant spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) or the nucleocapsid RNA-binding

365

domain (N-RBD) was conjugated in 30-fold molar excess biotin using EZ-Link

366

Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin (Thermo Scientific, A35358). Excess unbound biotin was removed

367

using ZebaTM Spin Desalting Columns, 7KMWCO (Thermo Scientific, 89890). Anti-D-IgG

368

was purified from Immucor Anti-D Series 4 (IgG & IgM monoclonal blend) by using protein

369

A magnetic affinity purification (G8782, Promega). The purified anti-D-IgG was then

370

concentrated (3mg/ml) and stored at 4 °C until use. Anti-D was then conjugated with

371

streptavidin according to manufacturer instruction (ab102921, abcam).

372
373

Bioconjugation of Anti-D-IgG-streptavidin with Reagent Red Blood Cells (RRBC) [0.8%

374

R2R2; blood group O; Rh/D-antigen+] (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics SELECTOGEN,

375

6902315) was done by incubating the anti-D-IgG-streptavidin with RRBC for 30 min at room

376

temperature. The RRBC-anti-D-streptavidin complex was then washed twice with low ionic

377

strength RBC diluent (MTS™ Diluent 2 PLUS; Micro Typing Inc., MTS9330S). The

378

complex was centrifuged at 1000g for 2 min to remove unbound anti-D-IgG streptavidin and

379

was then resuspended in the same RBC diluent. RBC-anti-D-IgG-streptavidin was then

380

conjugated with either biotin-S-RBD or biotin-N-RBD for 15 min at room temperature. The

381

RRBC-anti-D-sterptaviding-biotin-S-RBD/N-RBD was stored at 4 °C until use. The RRBC

382

agglutination assay was carried out in the same way as for latex agglutination described

383

above.

384
385

S-RBD-ACE2 binding ELISA and surrogate neutralization assay

386
387

ELISA plate Coating and blocking -S-RBD was dissolved (5 µg/ml) in Tris buffer saline (TBS)

388

(20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH7.4) and 100 µl of the S-RBD solution was added to each well

389

of an ELISA plate and incubate at 4°C overnight with slow shaking. The antigen-coated wells

390

were washed 3 times with TBS-tween (TBST) (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20).

391

The S-RBD coated wells were blocked by 100 µl of the ChonBlockTM blocking/sample

392

dilution ELISA buffer (Chondrex, Inc., 9068) for 1 hour at room temperature with slow

393

shaking followed washing 3 times with TBST.

394

ACE2:S-RBD binding assay- ACE2 was biotinylated as described above. Biotin-ACE2

395

(1µg/m) was added to S-RBD-coated plate after blocking and incubated for 1hour at room

396

temperature. The wells were washed 3 times with TBST to remove unbound biotin-ACE2.

397

Streptavidin-HRP (1000-fold dilution with Chonblock blocking buffer) was then added to each

398

well and incubated for 1hour at room temperature. The wells were washed 3 times with TBST

399

and TMB substrate (3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine, Thermo Scientific, N301) was added for

400

reaction development and 0.18 M H2SO4 was used to stop reaction. Absorbance at 450nm was

401

measured to detect the S-RBD bound ACE2.

402

SARS-CoV-2 antibody neutralization assay- Plasma was diluted 1:100 and incubated with

403

S-RBD-coated wells (blocked) for 1hour at room temperature. The wells were washed three

404

times with TBST. Biotin-ACE2 was then added to the wells and incubated for 1 hour at room

405

temperature followed by washing, reaction development and detection as described above.

406
407

Statistical analysis

408
409

All statistical analyses were done using the GraphPad Prism9 software. Specifically, the Hill

410

coefficient (h) was calculated from fitting agglutination data obtained using anti-S-RBD and

411

anti-N antibodies to the Hill equation. COVID-19+ samples with distinct agglutination scores

Figure 3. Agglutination assay distinguished COVID-19+ from COVID-19- samples.
(A, B) Comparison of S-RBD (A) and N antibody responses between COVID-19+
(n=169), COVID-19- (n=121) and Pre-COVID-19 (n=100) samples determined by the
aggregation assay. (C, D) The strength of the S-RBD and N antibody response in the
COVID-19+ (n=169) plasma samples could be determined semi-quantitatively by the
aggregation score (1-4 denotes weak-to-strong antibody response). Statistical
analyses were performed using unpaired Student’s t-test with Welch's correction (p
values shown on graph).

Figure S2. SARS-CoV2 antibody testing based on RBC agglutination.
Red blood cells (RBC, group O; R2R2) carrying the D antigen were labelled with antiD IgG conjugated to recombinant S-RBD or N-RBD through streptavidin-biotin (i.e.,
IgG-streptavidin conjugated to biotin-RBD). (A) S-RBD labeled RBCs were mixed
with either SARS-CoV-2- (NAAT) or SARS-CoV2+ plasma (right). (B) N-RBD labeled
RBCs were mixed with either SARS-CoV2- (left) or SARS-CoV2+ plasma (right).
Images shown were taken after 1 min incubation at room temperature.

Agglutination Score

Figure S4. Representative images of agglutination induced by plasma with
different agglutination scores. Shown are five samples with distinct agglutination
scores (0-4) in the nucleocapsid (aN) (upper row) or the S-RBD antibody (aS-RBD) test
(lower row). The scores were assigned as 4 = 75-100% agglutination; 3 = 50-75%
agglutination; 2 = 25-50% agglutination; 1 = 5-25% agglutination; 0 (or negative) ≤5%
agglutination.
