Abstract

27

Background/objective: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a

28

global threat to the public health. There is a challenge in measuring the patient’s length of

29

hospital stay and managing the healthcare resources to handle the situation successfully. Our

30

objective is to use the qPCR cycle of threshold (Ct) as a tool in evaluating the severity of the

31

infection and hence the length of hospital stay to better utilize and manage the healthcare

32

resources.

33

Methods: This cross sectional study was carried out on 306 patients who admitted to COVID-19

34

care centers in Kingdom of Bahrain from 20th March 2020 to 5th April 2020. Standard qPCR was

35

used to estimate the viral load and data were analyzed to investigate the relationship between Ct

36

values and various variables.

37

Results: Out of 306 patients, 2 deaths, 1 active stable case and 303 recovered cases were

38

reported. Ct value was significantly and negatively associated (P value <0.001) with length of

39

hospital stay. The viral clearance was also inversely associated with the Ct values.

40

Conclusion: Ct value was inversely associated with hospital stay duration (and time to viral

41

clearance), higher the Ct value is indicative of faster time to viral clearance. This association

42

could help to better manage the infection and resources allocation.

Introduction

53

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the newly identified strain of the

54

Coronavirus family Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 1. Whilst

55

some patients may have mild symptoms, others develop a severe respiratory distress syndrome

56

with features of a blood coagulopathy requiring intensive support 2. As a result, COVID-19 has

57

rapidly evolved into a pandemic that has put a severe burden on the healthcare services of some

58

countries, notably beds for both hospitalization and intensive care facilities 3. Testing aids case

59

identification, case isolation and contact tracing, all of which are vital to limit coronavirus spread

60

4.

61

Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) 5.The RT-PCR result is influenced by the Cycle

62

Threshold (Ct-Value) that has been suggested as a quantitative test to indirectly assess the viral

63

load 6 with severe cases having a much higher viral load than mild cases 7. Therefore, the aim of

64

this study was to measure the viral load determined by the Ct value and relate that to viral

65

clearance to determine if this could predict length of hospital stay, as that may help guide

66

healthcare resource allocation.

67

Methods

68

Patients and Sample Collection

69

A cross sectional study was undertaken on 306 patients who were admitted to COVID-19 care

70

centers in the Kingdom of Bahrain between March 20th, 2020 and April 5th, 2020. Of those 306

71

patients, 303 had recovered from their COVID-19 disease. Data were recorded for

72

demographics, Ct-value on admission, time to viral clearance, and data on the length of stay and

73

patient outcomes. At the time of the study, the local protocol in Bahrain admits all positive cases

74

to treatment/isolation facilities regardless of being symptomatic or asymptomatic. The patients

75

are discharged when they have two negative nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs on two

76

consecutive days. All admitted patients are tested after three days of being asymptomatic and, if

77

negative, the test is repeated after 24 hours to confirm viral clearance, following which the

78

patients are discharged. Therefore, the length of stay was the same as the time to viral clearance

79

and the minimum stay of patients is four days.

Currently, the main diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 is the real-time Reverse Transcription

81

RNA Extraction and SARS-Cov-2 RNA Amplification

82

The diagnostic test used for SARS-CoV-2 was performed using qPCR on nasopharyngeal and

83

oropharyngeal samples. The samples were transferred to a viral transport media immediately

84

after collection and transported to a COVID-19 laboratory for testing. Diagnosed cases were a

85

heterogeneous sample of tested patients, they included symptomatic and asymptomatic

86

individuals with recent exposure to a confirmed COVID19 case or travelers arriving from high

87

risk countries. PCR test was conducted using Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) TaqPath

88

1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG on the Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) 7500 Fast Dx

89

RealTime PCR Instrument. The assay used followed the WHO protocol from Charité Virology,

90

Berlin, Germany 8. and targeted the E gene. If the E gene was detected, the sample was then

91

confirmed by RdRP and N genes. The E gene CT value was reported and used in this study. CT

92

Values >40 were considered negative. Positive and negative controls were included for quality

93

control purposes.

94

RT-qPCR Analytical Validation

95

Linear range was determined using serial log10 dilutions of standard RNA and was established

96

between 3·5 x 103 to 3·5 x 1012 copies of RNA/mL, with amplification efficiency of 87% and

97

with a regression R2 value higher than 0.99.

98

Statistical Analysis

99

Categorical parameters were expressed as frequencies (%), whereas continuous variables are

100

presented as mean. Data trends were visually and statistically evaluated for normality. We used

101

regression analysis to describe the relationship between categorical variables and between

102

continuous variables with the main outcome. Two-way Student’s t test was then used to detect

103

the difference between Ct values across symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Statistical

104

analysis was performed using STATA statistical computer package (StataCorp. 2013. Stata

105

Statistical Software).

109

committee has been jointly established by the Ministry of Health and Bahrain Defense Force

110

Hospital research and ethical committees in response to the pandemic, to facilitate and monitor

111

COVID-19 research in Bahrain. All methods and retrospective analysis of data was approved by

112

the National COVID-19 Research and Ethics Committee, and carried out in accordance with the

113

local guideline and ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki 1975. Informed consent was

114

waived by the National COVID-19 Research and Ethical Committee for this study due to its

115

retrospective and observational nature and the absence of any patient identifying information

116

Results

117

Of the 306 patients, there were 303 who had recovered, whilst 2 deaths and 1 active stable case

118

were excluded from the analysis.

119

The descriptive summary of the patients is shown in Table 1. The sample of patients included

120

cases who arrived in Bahrain from other countries, all travelers being tested upon arrival, and

121

included cases of local spread. Initially, gender distribution of COVID-19 cases in Bahrain was

122

equal; however, as the infection started to spread within the community of labor workers, who

123

are mainly males, the ratio of males to females and the ratio of local cases to cases coming from

124

other countries increased. Symptomatic patients were 12.2% of the sample, which corresponded

125

to a similar percentage of the symptomatic patients in the entire population.

126

Ct values showed a statistically significant negative correlation of 0.28 with the length of

127

hospital stay and time to viral clearance as seen in Figure 1 showing the Lowess smoothing curve

128

of hospital stay. Higher Ct values on admission predicted shorter hospital stays and shorter time

129

to clear the virus. The regression analysis showed similar results when using a univariate

130

analysis and a multivariate analysis adjusted for age and gender. Ct value had a significant

131

inverse correlation with the length of stay, 10 points higher on the Ct value correlating with a

132

shorter hospital stay of 2.8 days.

133

Patients with high Ct values defined as ≥35 had shorter hospital stays, by 4.3 days, when

134

compared to patients with Ct values <35 on admission.

135

The regression analysis for Length of Stay using Ct value as a covariate is shown in Table 2.

136

Analysis on symptomatic individuals showed that symptomatic individuals have a lower mean Ct

137

value when compared to asymptomatic individuals. Asymptomatic individuals had a mean Ct

138

value of 27.8. Symptomatic individuals had a mean Ct value of 25.5. A Two sample T-test

139

showed a difference of 2.58 units in the mean Ct value between symptomatic and asymptomatic

140

patients (Table 3).

141

Discussion

142

This study has shown that the higher the Ct values, the more rapid the viral clearance, leading to

143

a shorter length of stay in hospital. A Ct value >35 predicted a shorter hospital stay by 4.3 days,

144

and a 10 unit increase in Ct value was associated with a shortened time to viral clearance of 2.8

145

days. Ct values have been reported as an indirect assessment of the viral load 6, 7, with higher Ct

146

values having a lower viral load, and it has been shown that those patients with more severe

147

disease have lower Ct values 7. Higher Ct values indicate an early infection or a recovering

148

infection. Whilst Ct values can be used to predict length of hospital stay for stable cases, the Ct

149

value cannot, however, predict outcomes. Outcomes are influenced by many additional

150

predictors, most notably comorbidities and severity of disease 9. The presence of age greater than

151

60 and comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, obesity and respiratory disease may offset

152

a high Ct values and further studies to predict outcomes based on Ct value taking into account

153

adverse risk factors of disease severity are needed.

154

In this study, symptomatic individuals had lower Ct values whilst asymptomatic individuals had

155

higher Ct values, suggesting that the lower Ct values reflects a more severe presentation.

156

However, asymptomatic individuals still had a low mean Ct values (27.8) indicating a

157

significant viral load, suggesting that asymptomatic individuals can still transmit the disease 10.

158

These results are in accord with those of Liu et al who reported that the mean viral load of severe

159

cases was around 60 times higher than that of mild cases 7. La Scola et. al have reported using

160

cell culture system that patients with Ct values >= 34 do not shed infectious virions, and hence

161

are not infectious and can be discharged from hospitals or care centers 11 .

162

Bahrain has pursued a comprehensive testing program with all travelers arriving in the country

163

being tested, mobile screening services, random screening in high risk communities and

164

extensive contact tracing. This strategy has resulted in detecting many asymptomatic patients, in

165

contrast to other countries where the response has been directed solely towards symptomatic

166

patients, and has generated data that is critical for production of accurate prediction models 12.

167

Limitations of this study include that it was cross sectional and that the number of symptomatic

168

cases were few in number. The number of patients with multiple comorbidities were few and

169

therefore a model to take into account the protective effect of a high Ct value could not be

170

determined.

171

Conclusion

172

In this current study it was evident that Ct value can predict the duration of hospital stay of

173

COVID-19 infected patients, which also suggests that viral clearance will be faster in higher Ct

174

value patients. This data can be implemented in other country to evaluate the patients stay at

175

hospital and also helpful in managing the healthcare staff in successfully handling the COVID-

176

19 infected patients.
