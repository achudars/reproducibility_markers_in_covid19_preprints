Summary

21

Background. Outbreaks of infectious diseases generate outbreaks of scientific evidence. In 2016

22

epidemics of Zika virus emerged, largely in Latin America and the Caribbean. In 2020, a novel severe

23

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a pandemic of coronavirus disease

24

2019 (COVID-19). We compared patterns of scientific publications for the two infections over time.

25

Methods. We used living systematic review methods to search for and annotate publications

26

according to study design. For Zika virus, a review team performed the tasks for publications in 2016.

27

For SARS-CoV-2, a crowd of 25 volunteer scientists performed the tasks for publications up to May

28

24, 2020. We used descriptive statistics to categorise and compare study designs over time.

29

Findings. We found 2,286 publications about Zika virus in 2016 and 21,990 about SARS-CoV-2 up to

30

24 May 2020, of which we analysed a random sample of 5294. For both infections, there were more

31

epidemiological than laboratory science studies. Amongst epidemiological studies for both

32

infections, case reports, case series and cross-sectional studies emerged first, cohort and case-

33

control studies were published later. Trials were the last to emerge. Mathematical modelling studies

34

were more common in SARS-CoV-2 research. The number of preprints was much higher for SARS-

35

CoV-2 than for Zika virus.

36

Interpretation. Similarities in the overall pattern of publications might be generalizable, whereas

37

differences are compatible with differences in the characteristics of a disease. Understanding how

38

evidence accumulates during disease outbreaks helps us understand which types of public health

39

questions we can answer and when.

Introduction

46

Scientists publish their findings to understand epidemics caused by novel pathogens. This evidence

47

will guide decisions, actions and interventions to mitigate the effects of the disease through policy,

48

programmes, guidelines and further research.

49

across a large number of countries since 2016 resulted in the declaration of a Public Health

50

Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-

51

General.

52

noticed in late 2015 in Brazil, although it was first discovered in 1947 and had caused small

53

outbreaks of infection before then.

54

was first discovered in January 2020 as the cause of a new zoonotic disease, coronavirus disease

55

2019 (COVID-19), spread primarily through the respiratory route.

56

the natural history of the two diseases, where microcephaly caused by Zika virus infection only

57

emerges months after infection, COVID-19 occurs acutely. Intensive research efforts for both

58

infections were catalysed by the needs of national, regional and global health agencies to answer

59

key questions on transmission, prevention, and interventions at the individual and community level.

60

During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the accumulation of peer-reviewed and preprint publications has

61

been vast; from April, 2020 onwards, an average of 2,000 scientific publications appeared per week.

62

A similar, albeit smaller surge in publications occurred in 2016 during the Zika virus epidemic. The

63

sudden large increases in publications about these conditions over a short time can also be

64

described as outbreaks.

65

The emergence of a new disease provides an opportunity to examine how research evidence

66

emerges and develops, according to the research question and the feasibility of the study methods.

67

Hierarchies of evidence are often used to rank the value of epidemiological study designs,

68

prioritising experimental methods,

69

effects of interventions. Anecdotal observations allow for the discovery and description of

70

phenomena, studies with comparison groups are more appropriate to test hypotheses, and

71

randomised trials test the causal effects of interventions.

72

about causality were important because the link between clusters of babies born with microcephaly

73

and Zika virus infection was not obvious; congenital abnormalities caused by a mosquito-borne virus

74

had never been reported. In an analysis of 346 publications about Zika virus, we described the

75

temporal sequence of publication of types of study to investigate causality.

76

the accumulation of study designs over time during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and concluded that

77

early in the outbreak, simple observational studies and narrative reviews were most abundant.

Here, we proposed a hypothetical sequence: first, anecdotal observations are reported in case

80

investigate the biology and pathogenesis of the disease. Mathematical modelling can provide

evidence where direct observations are not available.

82

83

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 allows a comparison with Zika virus between the timing and types of

84

evidence published at the start of an outbreak of a new disease. The objectives of this study were to

85

analyse the patterns of evolution of the evidence over time during the 2016 Zika virus epidemic and

86

the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We compare the sequence of evidence accumulation with the

87

previously hypothesised pattern.

88

Methods

89

Data collection

90

Searches and sources. We used databases that were created for the Zika Open Access Project

91

(ZOAP) and COVID-19 Open Access Project (COAP).

92

searches to index and deduplicate records of articles about Zika virus (from January 1, 2016) and

93

SARS-CoV-2 research (from January 1, 2020) in EMBASE via OVID, MEDLINE via PubMed, and the

94

preprint server bioRxiv (for SARS-CoV-2 we also searched medRxiv). We specify the search terms in

95

the appendix (pp 2).

96

Annotation of records with study design. We screened the title and abstract, or full text when the

97

first was insufficient, and annotated each record with its study design. For weeks where the volume

98

SARS-CoV-2 of research was over 400 publications, starting mid-March, we drew a random sample of

99

400 publications. The annotation of the Zika virus dataset was performed (from January 1, 2016 to

11

After a delay, controlled trials examining

9

12

For each pathogen, we ran daily automated

13, 14

100

December 31, 2016) for previous systematic reviews.

101

Study design classification. We first classified publications into the broad groups “epidemiology”,

102

“basic research”, “non-original research” (editorials, viewpoints, and commentaries) and “other”.

103

We subdivided epidemiological and basic research further, based on their study design. We provide

104

details on the classification of the study designs in the appendix (pp 3).

105

Crowd. To distribute the annotation workload, we recruited a ‘crowd’ of volunteer scientists.15 We

106

included researchers with a background in medicine or public health, who qualified by passing a pilot

107

test using an online tool that simulates classification tasks. A demonstration and the source code of

108

the tool are provided online.

109

The crowd members used another online tool for screening, annotation, and verification of each

110

record. A first crowd member screened and annotated a record, and a second crowd member

111

verified the annotated data. Disagreements were resolved by a third member of the team. One

112

person (MJC) distributed tasks centrally and a ‘crowd supervisor’ (AMI) monitored progress. Crowd

113

members took part in the interpretation of the results.

114

Reported number of cases. To compare the number of publications against the number of reported

115

cases, we used open-source data on Zika virus and SARS-CoV-2 from, see Data sharing.

116

Date that a publication becomes available. We defined the date at which a publication became

117

available as the date it was indexed in the MEDLINE or EMBASE database, or when it appeared on

118

the preprint server.

119

Data analysis

120

First, we described the evolution of reported cases and publications over time. Second, we described

121

the proportions of study designs, by week, for SARS-CoV-2 and by month for Zika virus, due to the

122

differences in research volume. We omitted the first two weeks of 2020 for SARS-CoV-2 because

123

there were only four publications, making the proportions unstable. To take into account the

124

random sampling of the SARS-CoV-2 research, we provided the Wilson score 95% confidence

125

intervals (CI) for the proportions. Third, we quantified the timing and speed of the accumulation of

126

publications of different study designs: We plotted the time elapsed between the first and twentieth

127

occurrence of publications of each study design. Last, we described the proportion of evidence that

128

was published on preprint servers during the two epidemics, and by study design.

129

Role of the funding sources

130

The funders of this study had no role in the study design, data analysis, data interpretation, or

131

writing of the report. All authors had full access to all of the data and final responsibility for the

132

decision to submit for publication.

133

Results

134

Between week one and week 21 (up to May 24) 2020, we indexed 21,990 publications, and a crowd

135

of 25 contributors annotated a sample of 5,294 publications on SARS-CoV-2. For the Zika virus

136

research, we annotated all 2,286 identified publications for 2016. Both the volume of the weekly

137

reported cases and number of publications were 30-50-fold higher for SARS-CoV-2 than for Zika virus

138

(figure 1).

144

The proportion of different study designs

145

In both epidemics, a substantial and reasonably stable proportion of the publications were non-

146

original research. The overall proportion of non-original publications was higher for Zika virus (55%,

147

(appendix pp 4)) than for SARS-CoV-2 (34% [95% CI: 33-35], (appendix pp 5)). For publications of

148

original research, the proportion of basic research publications increased over time for Zika virus,

149

but decreased for SARS-Cov-2 research (figure 2A).

150

Within the epidemiological study designs, mathematical modelling studies had a larger role at the

151

beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (10·1%, [95% CI: 9·3-11·0]) and compared to the Zika virus

152

outbreak (3·2%). Many of these were published as preprint publications. When we excluded preprint

153

publications, the evolution of evidence over time became more similar between the two epidemics

154

(appendix pp 6). Case reports and case series accounted for approximately 10% of the total body of

155

evidence; 10·7% [95% CI: 9·9-11·6] for SARS-CoV-2 and 9·7% for Zika virus research. Analytical

156

epidemiological study designs became more prevalent later in the SARS-Cov-2 and Zika virus

157

epidemics. Case-control and cohort studies accounted for 4·0% [95% CI: 3·5-4·6] for SARS-CoV-2 and

158

0·8% for Zika virus. Trials also emerged later but in smaller numbers (27/5,294 for SARS -CoV-2, and

159

1/2,286 for Zika virus) (Fig 2B).

Accumulation of epidemiological and basic research

166

Despite the difference in volume, the accumulation of study designs over time for SARS-CoV-2 and

167

Zika virus research show some similarities (figure 3). Case reports, case series and cross-sectional

168

studies were the first epidemiological study designs to be reported, together with non-original

169

articles and reviews. Case-control and cohort studies followed later; this delay was more prominent

170

in the Zika virus research. Phylogenetic studies and mathematical modelling studies had a more

171

prominent role early on during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic than in the Zika virus epidemic. In vivo and

177

The role of preprint publications

178

The role of preprint publications was more prominent at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic than

179

the Zika virus epidemic. In January and February 2020, the majority of publications on SARS-CoV-2

180

were manuscripts on preprint servers (figure 4A). Basic research reviews were seldom published on

181

preprint servers, whereas 77% of the mathematical modelling studies were initially made available

182

on preprint servers (figure 4B). The proportion of modelling and sequencing studies that were

183

published as preprints was high throughout the first 21 weeks of 2020, whereas other designs

184

reduced over time (appendix pp 8). The proportion of preprints decreased over time.

Discussion

189

The overall distribution of publications at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 and Zika virus epidemics was

190

similar. Epidemiological research was more commonly published than laboratory research and non-

191

original contributions accounted for a substantial fraction of all publications for both infections. For

192

both infections, case reports and case series, mathematical modelling and phylogenetic studies were

193

prominent at the start of the epidemic, whereas analytical study designs, such as cohort and case-

194

control studies, appeared later. Trials emerged later and accounted for a small proportion of all

195

studies. The volume and speed of evolution were much higher for SARS-CoV-2 than for Zika virus.

196

Modelling studies were more prominent and basic research studies were less common for SARS-

197

CoV-2 than for Zika virus. More studies were published as preprints for SARS-CoV-2, but this

198

proportion declined over time.

199

Strengths and limitations. Strengths of this study include the comparable and reproducible search

200

strategies for two emerging infectious diseases and categorisation of study design by a volunteer

201

crowd of epidemiologist reviewers. A limitation is that the design of an epidemiological study is not

202

always clear, and different scientists might classify the same study differently. We tried to tackle this

203

limitation by screening and training of the volunteer scientists, verification of decisions and having a

205

design of publications and did not assess the content or its methodological quality. To trace the

206

evolution of evidence for specific research questions, in-depth studies are needed. Second, for SARS-

207

CoV-2, the volume of publications meant that we only annotated a sample of records. The total in

208

the first five months of the pandemic was, however, higher than for one year of publications about

209

Zika virus and the proportions of different study designs for Zika virus stabilised quickly. Third, the

210

searches do not include all sources of peer-reviewed evidence or preprint sources. Incompleteness

211

of the evidence base should not affect our conclusions as long as other sources account for a stable

212

proportion of publications.

213

We followed two dimensions of the publication of evidence about two newly emerging infectious

214

diseases; the overall distribution of publication types and changes over time. Similarities in the

215

overall distribution of epidemiological, basic science and non-original publications for SARS-CoV-2

216

and Zika virus could reflect patterns of the overall trajectory of research about emerging infectious

217

diseases. In the initial phase of an outbreak with a novel pathogen, case reports and case series

218

predominate. These types of study describe and refine the clinical characteristics of the disease.

219

Observations from these studies are commonly used to define research questions and formulate

220

hypotheses about various aspects of transmission and disease. More formal, hypothesis-driven and

221

interventional research follows later.

222

The differences between study designs in the two epidemics are compatible with differences in

223

characteristics of the diseases. The higher proportion of basic research in Zika virus research may

224

have several explanations. First, the occurrence of congenital abnormalities following a vector-borne

225

infection was poorly understood; in vivo and in vitro studies were essential to investigate in utero

226

transmission and mechanisms for neurotoxicity and neuropathology.

227

mouse models was more successful in Zika virus research than for SARS-CoV-2 research,

20

There are other limitations. First, we only recorded the study

17

8

18

Second, the establishment of

19

although

228

efforts are ongoing.

Third, the later occurrence of case-control studies and cohorts studies in Zika

229

virus, might be caused by the delay to congenital outcomes, compared to the shorter delay in

230

outcomes caused by SARS-CoV-2. Fourth, the prominent role of mathematical modelling studies

231

during the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, probably reflects early recognition of the

232

pandemic potential and the need for forecasts of the global spread. Mechanistic models describing

233

the transmission SARS-CoV-2 are also less complex than for arboviruses like Zika virus, allowing

234

many to explore transmission dynamics.

235

CoV-2 research could reflect both the 50-fold higher numbers of cases than for Zika virus and the

236

severity of the pandemic, whereas Zika virus was largely limited to the Americas and cases of

237

infection were already declining as the research volume started to increase. The increasing role of

238

preprints during the SARS-CoV-2 coincided with developments in open access publishing and the

239

need for speedy access to outbreak research.

240

Other researchers have studied the evolution of evidence during disease outbreaks as well. During

241

the SARS outbreak in 2003, Xing et al. (2010) described epidemiological studies about Toronto and

242

Hong Kong, whereas we included epidemiological and non-epidemiological articles all over the

243

globe.

244

concluded that only a minority (7%) of the publications was published during the time outbreak,

245

while we investigated the proportion of the preprints over peer-reviewed publications.

SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, Liu et al. (2020) performed a bibliometric analysis of the SARS-CoV-2

247

literature up to March 24, 2020,

248

observed that clinical features of the COVID-19 were studied heavily, whereas other research areas

249

such as mental health, the use of novel technologies and artificial intelligence, and pathophysiology

250

remained underexplored. In contrary to the manual annotation of our project, Tran et al. (2020)

and showed that around 50% of studies were non-original, which is in line with our results.

259

our categorization method, Haghani and Bliemer used the categorization by the citation database

260

‘SCOPUS’ and conclude that the studies linked to public health response are first to emerge.

261

Our work has several implications for policy and research. The change over time in the types of

262

studies has particular implications for synthesis of evidence as more research is published. The

263

earliest publications about a new pathogen come from studies that can be done quickly and non-

264

original commentaries. The earliest studies published might not be the most appropriate to answer

265

specific questions, for example, about causality,

266

Triangulation of different sources of evidence using frameworks, such as those based on the

267

Bradford Hill criteria,

268

help. Living systematic reviews are particularly useful because changes to inclusion criteria can be

269

273

The vast quantity of evidence about emerging infections poses challenges for the efficient handling

274

and evaluation of information. The speed with which the evidence about SARS-CoV-2 has

275

accumulated is unprecedented. We recruited a large team of experienced scientists, but we were

276

still not able to categorise all publications by the time this manuscript is written. Machine learning

description of the types and timing of publications during outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging

Further analyses of the generation and accumulations of research evidence during disease outbreaks

could help to improve the public health response.
