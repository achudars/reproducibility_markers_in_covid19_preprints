Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine f‚Äãor the treatment of
COVID-19: A living systematic review protocol

ABSTRACT
Objective

To determine the relative impact of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on outcomes
important to patients with COVID 19.

Design

This is the protocol of a living systematic review.

Data sources

We will conduct searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL), trial registries, grey literature and in a centralised repository in L¬∑OVE (Living OVerview of
Evidence). L¬∑OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In
response to the COVID-19 emergency, L¬∑OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers
and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the
day before submission to a journal.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods

We will follow a common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews, already published and
submitted to PROSPERO (awaiting ID allocation).
We will include randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of chloroquine and
hydroxychloroquine ‚Äî as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs ‚Äî versus placebo or no
treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomised trials evaluating chloroquine and
hydroxychloroquine in infections caused by other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV,
and non-randomised studies in COVID-19 will be searched in case no direct evidence from randomised
trials is found, or if the direct evidence provides low- or very low-certainty for critical outcomes.
Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of
bias. We will perform random-effects meta-analyses and use GRADE to assess the certainty of the
evidence for each outcome.
A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We
will resubmit it if the conclusions change or there are substantial updates.

Ethics and dissemination

No ethics approval is considered necessary. The results of this review will be widely disseminated via
peer-reviewed publications, social networks and traditional media.

Keywords

COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, Coronavirus Infections, Systematic
review, Antimalarials, Hydroxychloroquine, Chloroquine.

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine f‚Äãor the treatment of
COVID-19: A living systematic review protocol

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 is an infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus [1]. It was first identified in Wuhan,
China, on December 31, 2019 [2]; three months later, almost half a million cases of contagion had
been identified across 197 countries [3]. On March 11, 2020, WHO characterised the COVID-19
outbreak as a pandemic [1].
While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some might progress to pneumonia, acute
respiratory distress syndrome and death [4],[5],[6]. The case fatality rate reported across countries,
settings and age groups is highly variable, but it would range from about 0.5% to 10% [7]. In
hospitalized patients it has been reported to be higher than 10% in some centres [8].
Many candidate drugs have been proposed as potentially effective, but the antimalarial agents
chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have attracted more attention than any other medication [9].
Some in vitro studies have suggested they would exert antiviral properties by inhibiting ph-dependant
steps of viral replication [10], not only against SARS-COV-2, but also Chikungunya, Dengue, Zika,
Influenza A H1N1 and H3N2, Coronavirus HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, among others
[11],[12]. Other researchers have found an anti-inflammatory and immune-stimulating effect
mediated by TNF-ùõº and IL-6 that would block the cascade of events leading to acute respiratory
distress syndro‚Äãme [10].
Notwithstanding, despite its in vitro activity against several agents, to this date there is no acute viral
infection that has been successfully treated by chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Moreover, in
Chikungunya virus infection, chloroquine showed the paradoxical effect of leading to more chronic
complications in the patients who received it, an outcome that would be explained by a delay in
immune adaptive response [13]. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still unknown, therefore the clinical
effects of administration of antimalarials in COVID-19 patients is largely unpredictable [‚Äã ‚Äã14‚Äã].
Theory aside, the use of antimalarials attracted attention after a news briefing by the Chinese
government in February 2020 revealed that, according to several Chinese studies, chloroquine and
hydroxychloroquine seemed ‚Äòto have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19‚Äô [15].
No empirical data supporting these findings have been published so far. A second boost of attention
on antimalarials came after the release of a non-randomised study ‚Äî with considerable
methodological limitations ‚Äî claiming that a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin
achieved a high level of SARS-CoV-2 clearance in respiratory secretions [16]1.
Most researchers have asked for caution while we wait for the information from dozens of randomised
trials already ongoing or planned, but the US Food and Drug Administration has authorized clinicians
to prescribe it for patients admitted to hospital, despite warnings from scientific advisers [17] .
Using innovative and agile processes, taking advantage of technological tools, and resorting to the
collective effort of several research groups, this living systematic review aims to provide a timely,

rigorous and continuously updated summary of the evidence available on the relative impact of the
use of antimalarials on outcomes important to patients with COVID-19.

METHODS
Protocol and registration
This manuscript complies with the ‚ÄòPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and
Meta-Analyses‚Äô (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses [18].
A protocol stating the shared objectives and methodology of multiple evidence syntheses (systematic
reviews and overviews of systematic reviews) to be conducted in parallel for different questions
relevant to COVID-19 was registered in PROSPERO (submitted, awaiting PROSPERO ID allocation) and
published [19]. The protocol was adapted to the specificities of the question assessed in this review.

Search strategies
Electronic searches
Our literature search was devised by the team maintaining
(‚Äãhttps://app.iloveevidence.com‚Äã) , using the following approach:

the

L¬∑OVE

platform

1. Identification of terms relevant to the population and intervention components of the search
strategy, using Word2vec technology [20] to the corpus of documents available in
Epistemonikos Database.
2. Discussion of terms with content and methods experts to identify relevant, irrelevant and
missing terms.
3. Creation of a sensitive boolean strategy encompassing all of the relevant terms
4. Iterative analysis of articles missed by the boolean strategy, and refinement of the strategy
accordingly.
Our main search source was Epistemonikos database ‚Äã(‚Äãhttps://www.epistemonikos.org‚Äã), a
comprehensive database of systematic reviews and other types of evidence [21]. We supplemented it
with articles from ‚Äãmultiple sources relevant to COVID-19 (without any study design, publication status
or language restriction) [22].
In sum, Epistemonikos Database acts as a central repository. Only articles fulfilling Epistemonikos
criteria are visible by users. The remaining articles are only accessible for members of COVID-19 L¬∑OVE
Working Group.

Additional searches will be conducted using highly sensitive searches without any language or
publication status restriction. The searches will cover from the inception date of each database until
the day before submission:
Additional searches will be conducted using highly sensitive searches in PubMed/MEDLINE, the
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase and the WHO International Clinical
Trials Registry Platform, without any language or publication status restriction. The searches will
cover from the inception date of each database until the day before submission.
The following strategy will be used to search in Epistemonikos Database. We will adapt it to the syntax
of other databases.
(coronavir* OR coronovirus* OR "corona virus" OR "virus corona" OR "corono virus" OR "virus corono"
OR hcov* OR "covid-19" OR covid19* OR "covid 19" OR "2019-nCoV" OR cv19* OR "cv-19" OR "cv 19"
OR "n-cov" OR ncov* OR "sars-cov-2" OR (wuhan* AND (virus OR viruses OR viral)) OR (covid* AND
(virus OR viruses OR viral)) OR "sars-cov" OR "sars cov" OR "sars-coronavirus" OR "severe acute

"middle-east respiratory syndrome") AND ((antimalari* OR "anti-malarial" OR "anti-malarials" OR
"anti-malaria") OR (chloroquine* OR CQ OR Aralen) OR (hydroxychloroquine* OR HCQ OR Plaquenil))
Other sources
In order to identify articles that might have been missed in the electronic searches, we will do the
following:
1. Screen the reference lists of other systematic reviews, and evaluate in full text all the articles
they include.
2. Scan the reference lists of selected guidelines, narrative reviews and other documents.
3. Conduct cross-citation search in Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic, using each included
study as the index reference.
4. Review websites from pharmaceutical companies producing drugs claimed as effective for
COVID-19 drugs, websites or databases of major regulatory agencies, and other websites
specialised in COVID-19.
5. Email the contact authors of all of the included studies to ask for additional publications or
data on their studies, and for other studies in the topic.
6. Review the reference list of each included study.

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine f‚Äãor the treatment of
COVID-19: A living systematic review protocol

Eligibility criteria
Types of studies
We will preferently include randomised trials. However, information from non-randomised studies will
be used if there is no direct evidence from randomised trials or the certainty of evidence for the critical
outcomes resulting from the randomised trials is graded as low- or very low, and the certainty
provided by the non-randomised evidence grades higher than the one provided by the randomised
evidence [23].
We will exclude studies evaluating the effects on animal models or in vitro conditions.
Types of participants
We will include trials assessing participants with COVID-19, as defined by the authors of the trials.
If substantial clinical heterogeneity on how the condition was defined is found, we will explore it using
a sensitivity analysis.
In case no direct evidence from randomised trials is found, or if the evidence from randomised trials
provides low- or very low-certainty evidence for critical outcomes, we will include information from
randomised trials evaluating antimalarials in other coronavirus infections, such as MERS-CoV or
SARS-CoV infections [23].
Type of interventions
The interventions of interest are the antimalarials chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. We will not
restrict our criteria to any dosage, duration, timing or route of administration.
The comparison of interest will be placebo (intervention plus optimal treatment versus placebo plus
optimal treatment) or no treatment (antimalarials plus optimal treatment versus optimal treatment).
Trials assessing antimalarials plus other drugs will be eligible if the cointerventions are identical in
both intervention and comparison groups.
Trials evaluating antimalarials in combination with other active drugs versus placebo or no treatment
will be also included.
Type of outcomes
We will not use the outcomes as an inclusion criteria during the selection process. Any article meeting
all the criteria except for the outcome criterion will be preliminarily included and evaluated in full text.
We used the core outcome set COS-COVID [24], the existing guidelines and reviews and the judgement
of the authors of this review as an input to select the primary and secondary outcomes, as well as to
decide upon inclusion. The review team will revise this list of outcomes, in order to incorporate
ongoing efforts to define Core Outcomes Sets [25].

Selection of studies
The results of the literature search in Epistemonikos database will be automatically incorporated into
the ‚ÄãL¬∑OVE platform (automated retrieval), where they will be de-duplicated by an algorithm
comparing unique identifiers (database ID, DOI, trial registry ID), and citation details (i.e. author
names, journal, year of publication, volume, number, pages, article title and article abstract).
The additional searches will be uploaded to the screening software Collaboratron‚Ñ¢ [‚Äã27‚Äã].
In both L¬∑OVE platform and Collaboratron‚Ñ¢, two researchers will independently screen the titles and
abstracts yielded by the search against the inclusion criteria. We will obtain the full reports for all titles
that appear to meet the inclusion criteria or require further analysis to decide on their inclusion.
We will record the reasons for excluding trials in any stage of the search and outline the study
selection process in a PRISMA flow diagram adapted for the purpose of this project .

Extraction and management of data
Using standardised forms, two reviewers will extract data independently from each included study.
We will collect the following information: study design, setting, participant characteristics (including
disease severity and age) and study eligibility criteria; details about the administered intervention and
comparison, including dose and therapeutic scheme, duration, timing (i.e. time after diagnosis) and
route of administration; the outcomes assessed and the time they were measured; the source of
funding of the study and the conflicts of interest disclosed by the investigators; the risk of bias
assessment for each individual study.

COVID-19: A living systematic review protocol

We will resolve disagreements by discussion, and one arbiter will adjudicate unresolved
disagreements.

Risk of bias assessment
The risk of bias for each randomised trial will be assessed using a 'risk of bias' tool (RoB 2.0: a revised
tool to assess risk of bias in randomised trials) [28]. We will consider the effect of assignment to the
intervention for this review. Two reviewers will independently assess five domains of bias for each
outcome result of all reported outcomes and time points. These five domains are: bias due to (1) the
randomisation process, (2) deviations from intended interventions (effects of assignment to
interventions at baseline), (3) missing outcome data, (4) measurement of the outcome, and (5)
selection of reported results. Answers to signalling questions and supporting information collectively
will lead to a domain-level judgement in the form of 'Low risk of bias', 'Some concerns', or 'High risk
of bias'. These domain-level judgements will inform an overall 'risk of bias' judgement for each result.
Discrepancies between review authors will be resolved by discussion to reach consensus. If necessary,
a third review author will be consulted to achieve a decision.
We will assess their risks of bias with the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions
(ROBINS-I), a tool for assessing risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions [29]. We will
assess the following domains: bias due to confounding, bias in selection of participants into the study,
bias in classification of interventions, bias due to deviations from intended interventions (effect of
assignment to intervention), bias due to missing data, bias in measurement of outcomes and bias in
the selection of the reported result. We will judge each domain as low risk, moderate risk, serious risk,
critical risk, or no information, and evaluate individual bias items as described in ROBINS-I guidance.
We will not consider time-varying confounding, as these confounders are not relevant in this setting
[29]. We will consider the following factors as baseline potential confounders:
‚óè
‚óè
‚óè
‚óè

Age
Comorbidity (e.g. cardiovascular disease, renal disease, eye disease, liver disease)
Co-interventions
Severity, as defined by the authors (i.e respiratory failure vs respiratory distress syndrome vs
ICU requirement).

Measures of treatment effect
For dichotomous outcomes, we will express the estimate of treatment effect of an intervention as risk
ratios (RR) or odds ratios (OR) along with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes, we
will use mean difference and standard deviation (SD) to summarise the data using a 95% CI. Whenever
continuous outcomes are measured using different scales, the treatment effect will be expressed as a
standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI. When possible, we will multiply the SMD by a
standard deviation that is representative from the pooled studies, for example, the SD from a
well-known scale used by several of the studies included in the analysis on which the result is based.
In cases where the minimally important difference (MID) is known, we will also present continuous

outcomes as MID units or inform the results as the difference in the proportion of patients achieving a
minimal important effect between intervention and control [30].
Then, these results will be displayed on the 'Summary of Findings Table' as mean difference [30].

Strategy for data synthesis
If we include more than one trial we will conduct meta-analysis for studies clinically homogeneous
using RevMan 5 [31], using the inverse variance method with random effects model. For any outcomes
where data was insufficient to calculate an effect estimate, a narrative synthesis will be presented.

Subgroup and sensitivity analysis
We will perform subgroup analysis according to the definition of severe COVID-19 infection (i.e
respiratory failure vs respiratory distress syndrome vs ICU requirement). In case we identify significant
differences between subgroups (test for interaction <0.05) we will report the results of individual
subgroups separately.
We will perform sensitivity analysis excluding high risk of bias studies, and if non-randomised studies
are used, excluding studies that did not report adjusted estimates. In cases where the primary analysis
effect estimates and the sensitivity analysis effect estimates significantly differ we will either present
the low risk of bias ‚Äî adjusted sensitivity analysis estimates ‚Äî or present the primary analysis
estimates but downgrading the certainty of the evidence because of risk of bias.

Assessment of certainty of evidence
The certainty of the evidence for all outcomes will be judged using the Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group methodology (GRADE Working Group) [32],
across the domains of risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision and reporting bias. Certainty will
be adjudicated as high, moderate, low or very low. For the main comparisons and outcomes, we will
prepare Summary of Findings (SoF) tables [33],[34 and also interactive Summary of Findings
(‚Äãhttp://isof.epistemonikos.org/‚Äã) tables. A SoF table with all the comparisons and outcomes will be
presented as an appendix.

Living evidence synthesis
An artificial intelligence algorithm deployed in the Coronavirus/COVID-19 topic of the L¬∑OVE platform
(‚Äãhttps://app.iloveevidence.com/loves/5e6fdb9669c00e4ac072701d‚Äã) will provide instant notification of
articles with a high likelihood to be eligible. The authors will review these and will decide upon
inclusion, and will update the ‚Äãliving web version of the review accordingly. We will consider
resubmission to a journal if there is a change in the direction of the effect on the critical outcomes or a
substantial modification to the certainty of the evidence.
This review is part of a larger project set up to produce multiple parallel systematic reviews relevant to
COVID-19 [19].
