ABSTRACT
We propose a new method to estimate the time-varying effective (or instantaneous) reproduction number of the novel
coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The method is based on a discrete-time stochastic augmented compartmental model that
describes the virus transmission. A two-stage estimation method, which combines the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to
estimate the reported state variables (active and removed cases) and a low pass filter based on a rational transfer function to
remove short term fluctuations of the reported cases, is used with case uncertainties that are assumed to follow a Gaussian
distribution. Our method does not require information regarding serial intervals, which makes the estimation procedure simpler
without reducing the quality of the estimate. We show that the proposed method is comparable to common approaches, e.g.,
age-structured and new cases based sequential Bayesian models. We also apply it to COVID-19 cases in the Scandinavian
countries: Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, where we see a delay of about four days in predicting the epidemic peak.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), i.e., a disease outbreak of atypical pneumonia that originated from Wuhan, China1 ,
has caused globally at least 90 million confirmed cases, including an estimated 2 million deaths in approximately 216 countries
by the end of 2020. The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 crisis a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
In modelling the disease’s transmission as well as to inform and evaluate control policies, it is particularly important to
estimate its reproduction number. Early estimates for COVID-19 basic reproduction number R0 , that denotes the transmission
potential of infectious disease when introduced to a completely susceptible population, ranged from 1.4 to 6.492 . The effective
(or instantaneous) reproduction number Rt , on the other hand, reflects the extent of transmission in the presence of population
immunity or intervention. Thus, the estimation of Rt is important for evaluating public measure success. However, estimation
of Rt is sensitive to the model structure and parameter assumptions3 . As a case in point, due to incorporation of more individual
case information and travel data, the estimate for R0 in Wuhan was revised upward from 2.2-2.7 to 5.74 . On the other hand,
data inavailability or poor quality often hinders the use of certain estimation methods, such as serial interval data that are usually
needed to estimate Rt (e.g., Fraser5 , Wallinga and Teunis6 , Cauchemez et al.7 , White and Pagano8 ).
In the course of calculating the exact value of Rt , especially when the data has not yet reached its peak, precise assumptions
and data estimates are needed. Nishiura et al.9 discussed a likelihood-based approach to estimate Rt from early epidemic
growth data. Using the compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, Bettencourt and Ribeiro10 use the
incidence data to estimate R0 and Rt . In this paper, based on the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model as a
reference, we develop a novel approach to estimate Rt of COVID-19. It uses information on the number of infected or active
(I), recovered (R), and death (D) cases, which are readily available for all affected countries, so that they can be accessed rather
easily.
The reproduction number is estimated from reported cases under uncertainties using a two-stage estimation method based
on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a low-pass filter. The method not only considers the nominal number of reported
cases, but also its daily pattern. To show our method’s practical ability, we apply it to COVID-19 cases in the Scandinavian
countries, i.e., Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, and compare the results with two commonly used Bayesian methods due to
Bettencourt and Ribeiro10 and Cori et al.5, 11 . We show that the results are indeed comparable.

A Discrete-Time Stochastic Augmented Compartmental Model
Our estimation method is based on the compartmental SIRD model that can be written as the following first-order nonlinear
differential equations:
β I(t)S(t)
,
N
β I(t)S(t)
˙
I(t)
=
− (γ + κ)I(t),
N
Ṙ(t) = γI(t),
Ḋ(t) = κI(t),
Ṡ(t) = −

(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

where S denotes the number of susceptible individuals, N is the total population, β is the average number of contacts per person
per time, γ and κ are the recovery and death rate, respectively. Remark that the value of β is time-varying due to intervention,
i.e., β =β (t). To use the model, we require information on the average infectious time Ti and the case fatality rate CFR, so that
γ=

1 − CFR
CFR
,κ =
.
Ti
Ti

(5)

For COVID-19, we take Ti = 9 as the infectious period on average lasts for 9 days (i.e., 7-11 days with 95% CI)12 . The
time-varying effective reproduction number is then given by:


β (t)
S(t) β (t)
≈
.
(6)
Rt (t) =
N
γ +κ
γ +κ
The approximation is under the assumption that government intervention is taken at an early stage so that the susceptible is
relatively the same over time as the total population. This is the case especially for emerging diseases. We modify the SIRD
model by augmenting the following two equations into the system:
Ė(t) = (γ + κ)I(t) − E(t),

Ṙt (t) = 0.

(7)

The former equation takes into account the daily number of reported new cases E, while the latter one says that the effective
reproduction number Rt is assumed to be a piece-wise constant function with jump every one day time interval.
Discretizing the model using the forward Euler method, we obtain the following discrete-time augmented SIRD model:


(γ + κ)∆t
S(k + 1) =
1−
Rt (k)I(k) S(k),
(8)
N
(γ + κ)∆t
I(k + 1) = (1 − (γ + κ)∆t)I(k) +
Rt (k)I(k)S(k),
(9)
N
R(k + 1) = R(k) + γ∆tI(k),
(10)
D(k + 1) = D(k) + κ∆tI(k),
(11)
E(k + 1) = (γ + κ)∆tI(k) + (1 − ∆t)E(k),
(12)
Rt (k + 1) = Rt (k).
(13)
Our method computes a new estimate of Rt based on new reported cases. Since their frequency is low (could be once a
day), the reported data can be interpolated using, e.g., a modified Akima cubic Hermite interpolation, such that it fits with
the time step ∆t. In our simulation, the time step ∆t is chosen as 0.01, i.e., 100 time discretization within one day interval.
The confidence interval of our estimated Rt is determined by computing the reproduction number for different values of the
infectious period Ti within a certain interval.
To simplify the presentation, we define the augmented state vector


S(k + 1)
 I(k + 1) 


 R(k + 1) 

,
x (k + 1) = 
(14)

 D(k + 1) 
 E(k + 1) 
Rt (k + 1)
and as such, the discrete-time augmented SIRD model (8)-(13) can be written as follows
x(k + 1) =

f (xx(k)) + w(k),

where f is the nonlinear term written in the right hand side of (8)-(13) and w is introduced as an uncertainty to model the
inaccuracies due to simplification in the modelling. The uncertainty is assumed to be a zero mean Gaussian white noise with
known covariance Q F . In practice, Q F can be considered as a tuning parameter for the EKF. Thus, the transmission model
becomes a discrete-time stochastic augmented SIRD model.
Reported cases, such as the number of active cases and the cumulative numbers of recovered and death, can be incorporated
into the model using the following output vector
y (k + 1) = C x (k) + v (k).

(16)

Here, v denotes uncertainties due to false testing results. We also assume the uncertainty to be a zero mean Gaussian white
noise with known covariance R F . As well as Q F , R F can also be considered as a tuning parameter. Following the available data
that include I, R, D, and E, the data/measurement matrix C is taken to be

A Two-Stage Filtering Method
A two-stage filtering method is used to estimate the daily reproduction number Rt . The method consists of the EKF and
a low-pass filter. In the first stage of estimation, the EKF is used to estimate the state variables and the value of Rt under
uncertainties in the number of reported cases. Afterwards, the low pass filter is used to remove short term fluctuations of the
reported cases that can be caused by delays in the reporting. For example, suddenly in Denmark there were 893 recovered
patients reported on 1 April 2020, in contrast to the previous days from 16 February 2020 onwards when there was no recovery
reported at all. Such an accumulated delay can cause a falsely decreasing value of Rt .
The EKF is an extension of Kalman filter for nonlinear systems. The Kalman filter itself is based on a recursive Bayesian
estimation and is an optimal linear filter. The idea of EKF is to linearize the non-linearity around its estimate. Due to that
linearization, the optimality and stability of the EKF cannot be guaranteed. However, if the non-linearity is not severe, the EKF
can give a reasonably good estimate.
Let us denote x̂x(k) as an estimated vector state from the EKF. Applying first-order Taylor series expansion to f at x̂x(k), we
obtain
f (xx(k)) = f (x̂x(k)) + J f (x̂x(k))(xx(k) − x̂x(k)),
where J f (x̂x(k)) is the Jacobian matrix of f , given by:

The EKF consists of two steps: predict and update. The discrete-time stochastic augmented SIRD model is used to predict
the next state and covariance and update them after obtaining new data/measurement. The EKF can be considered as one of
the simplest dynamic Bayesian networks. While the EKF calculates estimates of the true values of states recursively over
time using incoming measurements and a mathematical process model, recursive Bayesian estimation calculates estimates
of an unknown probability density function recursively over time using incoming measurements and a mathematical process
model13 . Let x̂x(n|m) denotes the estimate of x at time n given observations up to and including at time m ≤ n. The Kalman
filter algorithm is given as follows14
Predict
x̂x(k + 1|k) = f (x̂x(k|k))
P(k|k)JJ f (x̂x(k|k))| + Q F (k)
P (k + 1|k) = J f (x̂x(k|k))P

Update

ỹy(k + 1) = y(k + 1) −C

K (k + 1) = P(k + 1|k)C

C ) P (k + 1|k)
P (k + 1|k + 1) = (II − K (k + 1)C

(29)
(30)
(31)

Here P (k|k) denotes a posteriori estimate covariance matrix. In the second stage, a low pass filter based on a rational
transfer function is used to remove short term fluctuation at time step k, and is given by
ŷy(k) =

1
(x̂x(k) + x̂x(k) + · · · + x̂x(k − yn + 1)) ,
yn

(32)

where yn is a window length along the data. In our case, we choose yn = ∆t3 .
To evaluate the quality of the estimate, we calculate a Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) between the estimated
and reported cases. The RRMSE is defined as
RRMSE =

where Nd is the number of observed days and X ∈ {I, D, R, E}.

Case study: Scandinavian countries
In this section, we apply our method to study viral transmission of COVID-19 in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. All
datasets and MATLAB code are available on GitHub (https://github.com/agusisma/covid19). As the country of
residence of the corresponding author, Denmark has a high estimated percentage of reported symptomatic COVID-19 cases, i.e.,
61% (42%-87% of 95% CI). Norway is at 73% with 43%-98% of 95% CI. On the contrary, Sweden only has 15% (11%-19%
of 95% CI). The countries also have a different approach in their public measures in responding to COVID-19, i.e., Sweden did
not implement a strict lockdown, unlike its Nordic neighbouring countries.
We plot the observed incidence of COVID-19 in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway in Fig. 1. We also plot in the same
figure estimated numbers computed using our method, where good agreement is obtained. For all estimation, the process
and observation covariance matrices are considered as tuning parameters and are chosen as Q F = diag(10 10 10 10 5 0.2) and
R F = diag(100 10 10 5 1), respectively. These parameters are chosen such that the RRMSE between the estimated and reported
data are sufficiently small. In our case study, the RRMSE are shown in Table 1.

and the instantaneous method by Fraser5 that is implemented with a Bayesian analysis11, 15 . The former method exploits the
new reported incidence, while the latter one uses the distribution of the serial interval.
First, we compare our method with that of Bettencourt and Ribeiro10 , that allows sequential estimation of the basic
reproduction number at the initial stage, i.e., when the growth is still exponential. While the two methods are based on the
SIR model, Bettencourt and Ribeiro10 rather use new incidence data, which in here need to be smoothed out using a five-day
moving average filter. In Fig. 2, we plot the comparison and summarise the basic reproduction numbers that are taken to be the
maximum of the curves in Table 2. It is interesting to note how the methods give rather similar estimations. This indicates that
our method gives comparable results to those of10 .
Finally, we plot the time-varying effective reproduction number in Fig. 3. Here, we compare our results with those using
Cori et al.11 . The method of11 utilises the disease serial interval, which we approximate using a shifted Gamma distribution11
with mean 4.7 and standard deviation 2.916 . The prior belief for the value of Rt is taken to be Gamma function with mean and
standard deviation 5. We do not average out the data of daily new cases, but instead take the likelihood estimation of a new case
at one day to depend also on the estimation of the previous three days.
In Fig. 3 we obtain that the two methods give the plot of Rt with the same trend, indicating that our method is also
comparable with11 . There is a delay of about four days in the trend, especially with the time when the reproduction number
curve crossed the horizontal axis. The delay is caused by the peaks of new daily cases and active ones that also differ by about
the same days.
A different trend especially at later times between the methods appears in Fig. 3(c) for Norway. The curve from our
method is quite smooth, while it is rather fluctuating in that using Cori et al.11 . The discrepancy is caused by the active and
recovered cases that apparently were not updated regularly, in contrast to the new positive cases needed by the method of11 .
The unreported recovery cases were all released at once on May 22, 2020, see Fig. 1(c).

Conclusion and Future Work
Many mathematical models have been developed to estimate several types of reproduction numbers during epidemic outbreaks.
We here provide a novel method exploiting reported active, recovered and death cases using the SIR model as an underlying
approach. This new method offers several advantages, from the modeling point of view, the resulting Rt value can follow the
dynamics of the model suggested, so it is possible to develop it further if the model chosen has a higher complexity, besides
that the estimation approach used can still be expanded in terms of statistical view. In the case that the data provided in time
series do not change much or instead have drastic changes, such as accumulating at a certain time, the resulting Rt value will
show the same spikes and serrations. As a result, the latest information from data dynamics can be more elaborated.
By applying the method to COVID-19 cases in the Scandinavian countries and comparing the results to commonly used
methods due to10 and11 , we showed that our model is comparable, which expectedly will allow for fast assessment of the
reproduction number in new outbreaks. Using the method to forecast and critically assess incidence data in countries with high
under-reporting, such as Indonesia, is addressed for future work.
