Abstract
Background: The outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the
novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain a huge
threat to the public health worldwide. Clinical data is limited up to now regarding the
risk factors in favor of severe conversion of non-severe case with COVID-19.
Aims: This study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of
COVID-19 in terms of the association of cardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) with inhospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases.
Methods: Retrospective, single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized
health staff with confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the Central Hospital of Wuhan
in Wuhan, China, from January 15 to January 24, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic,
clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were
collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up was March 3, 2020. A comparative
study was applied between cases with CVMs and those without CVMs.
Results: Of all, clinicians and clinical nurses accounted for 80.5%, while 87.8% of all
had history of patient contact. The population was presented with a mean age of 39.1
± 9.2 and less comorbidities than community population. The three most frequent
symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed were fever (82.9%), myalgia or fatigue (80.5%)
and cough (63.4%). While, the three most frequent initial symptoms were myalgia or
fatigue (80.5%), fever (73.2%) and cough (41.5%). There were 95.1% cases featured as
non-severe course of disease according to the official standard in China. Patients with
CVMs and those without CVMs accounted for 58.5% and 41.5%, respectively.
Compared with cases without CVMs, patients with CVMs were presented with lower
baseline lymphocyte count (0.99 ± 0.43 and 1.55 ± 0.61, P<0.001), more who had at
least once positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab during admission (50.0% and
11.8%, P=0.011), and more received oxygen support (79.2% and 23.5%, P<0.001). The
rate of in-hospital adverse events was significantly higher in patients with CVMs group
(75.0% and 23.5%, P=0.001). Multivariable logistic regression model indicated that,
coexisting with CVMs in COVID-19 patients was not independently associated with in3

hospital adverse events.
Conclusions: Most of hospital staff with COVID-19 had history of patient contact,
featured non-severe course of disease. Cases with CVMs suffered from more inhospital adverse events than those without CVMs. But concomitant CVMs were not
independently associated with in-hospital adverse events in COVID-19 patients.

Introduction
Ever since December 2019, novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), which firstly
appeared in Wuhan and then rapidly spread nationwide and abroad, has taken 2946
lives and confirmedly infected 80304 cases in China as of March 3, 2020. Outside of
China, a total of 10566 cases confirmedly infected and 166 deaths have been reported
in 72 countries [1-6]. The acute respiratory infectious disease caused by infection of
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (tentatively named
2019-nCoV since official confirmation as the pathogen of the outbreak, later formally
named SARS-CoV-2 by the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee
on Taxonomy of Viruses on February 7, 2020) was officially named as coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020
[7].
As clinic experiences increases, clinicians become conscious of cardiovascular
comorbidities and manifestations of COVID-19. Two reports showed that patients with
COVID-19 and hypertension or coronary artery disease had worse in-hospital
outcomes [8, 9]. Cardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) could be the initial
presentation or appear throughout the whole course of COVID-19. Liu et al analyzed
137 cases with COVID-19 and found that patients who complains palpitation as initial
symptom accounted for 7.3% [10]. The first report of 41 cases with COVID-19 admitted
from December 1, 2019 to January 2, 2020, revealed acute cardiac injury occurred in
12% of patients [11]. Wang et al reported in a single-center case series involving 138

patients with COVID-19, also found that cardiovascular complications of COVID-19
were not rare, among which arrhythmia and acute cardiac injury accounted for 16.7%
and 7.2%, respectively. The level of hypersensitive troponin I on admission was
significantly higher in those who had been admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) than
those who had not [12]. Meanwhile, Wang et al hospital-associated transmission of
2019-nCoV was suspected in about 41% of patients. And clinician and clinical nurse
accounted for 29% of total, shockingly [12]. The NCP Emergency Response
Epidemiology Team of China reported a total of 1716 health workers have become
infected and 5 have died (0.3%) as of February 11, 2020 [13]. The detailed data are
still limited, regarding the clinical manifestations, epidemiological characteristics,
treatment situation and outcomes in this special population. Therefore, this study
analyzed a group of hospital staff diagnosed as COVID-19 to figure out this issue.
Further, a comparative study was applied to explain whether concomitant CVMs had
effect on the in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases.
Methods
Ethical Statement
As a retrospective study and data analysis were performed anonymously, the
requirement for informed consent was waived. The Ethics Committees of the Central
Hospital of Wuhan approved this study.
Study Population
A group of staff of the Central Hospital of Wuhan with confirmed COVID-19
admitted to the Pneumology Department of the Central Hospital of Wuhan from
January 15 to January 24, 2020, were enrolled. Oral consent was obtained from
patients. The Central Hospital of Wuhan located in Wuhan, Hubei Province, the
endemic areas of COVID-19, is one of the major tertiary teaching hospitals affiliated
to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and is
responsible for the treatments for COVID-19 assigned by government. All patients
with COVID-19 enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to WHO interim
guidance, as well as the Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme of COVID-19 (the fifth trial
edition) by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional
Chinese Medicine of China [14, 15]. The clinical outcomes (ie, in-hospital adverse
events, nucleic acid detection) were monitored up to March 3, 2020, the final date of

follow-up.
Data Collection and Definitions
The medical records of patients were collected into a database by the researcher
of the Central Hospital of Wuhan from electronic medical records system.
Epidemiological and clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiological findings,
treatment and outcomes data were first-hand obtained. The data were reviewed by a
trained team of physicians. Information recorded included demographic data, medical
history, exposure history, comorbidities, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings,
chest computed tomographic (CT) scans, nucleic acid detection of throat swab,
treatment measures and in-hospital adverse events. The date of disease onset was
defined as the day when the symptom was noticed. Treatment included antiviral
therapy, antibiotics or anti-fungus drugs, corticosteroid therapy, intravenous human
albumin or immunoglobulin, thymosin, traditional Chinese medicine, mesenchymal
stem cell therapy and respiratory support. None received kidney replacement therapy,
plasma exchange or artificial liver.
Respiratory failure (RF) was diagnosed according to arterial blood gas analysis.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined according to the Berlin
definition [15, 16]. Acute cardiac injury was defined if the serum levels of cardiac
biomarkers (mainly creatine kinase-MB and hypersensitive cardiac troponin I) were
above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, with a tendency to rise or fall, or new
abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography during the
whole course of disease [12]. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was identified according to the
Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definition [17]. Acute hepatic injury was
recognized when elevated level of serum aminotransferase or bilirubin was detected
during hospitalization, which cannot be explained by background disease. Acute
myocyte injury was recognized as myalgia or fatigue along with acute hypercreatine
kinasemia (peak sCK is >or=3 x normal) while no evidence on myocardial injury [18].
Shock was identified according to treatment guideline of severe sepsis/septic shock
(China) [19]. Secondary infection was diagnosed by any one of: 1, elevated neutrophil
percentage or procalcitonin; 2, respiratory purulent secretion, increased coughing of
phlegm or moist rales; 3, radiological features of bacteria or fungus infection. In6

hospital adverse events included RF or ARDS, transfer to ICU, invasive mechanic
ventilation, acute cardiac injury, AKI, acute hepatic injury, acute myocyte injury, shock,
secondary infection and death. Cases with CVMs were defined by any one of these
throughout the course of disease: 1, complain of palpitation or chest distress; 2,
elevation of creatine kinase-MB or hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (above the 99th
percentile upper reference limit); 3, new abnormalities on electrocardiography
including sinus tachycardia.
Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay for SARS-CoV-2
Throat swab samples were collected for extracting SARS-CoV-2 ribose nucleic
acid (RNA) from patients with suspected or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 (Miraclean
Technology Co., Ltd, Shenzhen, China). After collection, the throat swabs were placed
into a collection tube with virus preservation solution, and total RNA was extracted
using the respiratory sample RNA isolation kit (Automated Nucleic Acid Extraction
System, Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech Co., Ltd, China). The suspension was used for real-time
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Two target genes, including open reading frame lab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid
protein(N), were simultaneously amplified and tested during the real-time RT-PCR
assay. The real time RT-PCR assay was performed using a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid
detection kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Shanghai BioGerm Medical
Biotechnology Co., Ltd, China). All SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic Acid Detection Kits were
provided by Wuhan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A cycle threshold
value (Ct-value) less than 37 was defined as a positive result, while a Ct-value of 40 or
more was defined as negative. A Ct-value of 37 to less than 40, required retest to
confirm. Specific primers and probes for detection SARS-CoV-2 and the diagnostic
criteria were referred to the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral

normal distribution, while Chi‑square tests were applied to compare categorical
variables between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were
applied to control baseline confounders. Covariates for logistic regression were those
variables with significant differences between the two groups in baseline. All P values
were two sided with a significance level of 0.05. Tendency of significant difference was
judged when 0.05<P<0.1.
Results
Epidemiological Characteristics
The study population included 41 hospitalized staff with confirmed COVID-19.
The mean age was 39.1 (± 9.2) years, and 17 (41.5%) were men. The clinician and
clinical nurse, who had direct contact with COVID-19 patients, accounted for 46.3%
and 34.1%, respectively. Cases from medical detection departments accounted for
12.2%, who also had contact with COVID-19 patients or their specimen. Only 3 (7.3%)
cases were from administrative or logistics departments, who mostly had contacted
with infected colleagues. Recalling epidemiological history, 97% of all could tell how
they infected. Definite history of patient contact accounted for 73.2%, while suspected
history of patient contact accounted for 14.6%. Only 2 cases (4.9%) told contact with
infected family members, but they had also contacted with suspected COVID-19
patients, making the clue questioning. (Table 1)
Clinical Presentation, Laboratory and Radiological Data
As a young and middle-aged population, mostly of them were generally healthy,
presented as less comorbidities (29.3%) than general community population
previously reported [11, 12]. The comorbidities with high incidence in the elderly like
diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and malignant tumor were all lower than 5.0%.
The three most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed in this study were
fever (82.9%), myalgia or fatigue (80.5%) and cough (63.4%). While, the three most
frequent initial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue (80.5%), fever (73.2%), and cough
(41.5%). Furthermore, other symptoms during course of disease included sputum

diarrhea (19.5%), dizziness (12.2%), somnipathy (12.2%), rhinobyon or running nose
(9.8%), headache (4.9%), bloody sputum (2.4%), conjunctivitis (2.4%). (Table 1)
The mean white blood cell (WBC) count was 4.89 (± 1.83) ×10⁹/L. Cases with WBC
count below 4.0×10⁹/L accounted for 36.6%. The mean lymphocyte count was 1.22 (±
0.58) ×10⁹/L. Cases with lymphocyte count below 1.0×10⁹/L accounted for 34.1%.
Cases with procalcitonin below 0.2 ng/mL accounted for 97.6%. (Table 2)
There were 26 of the 41 enrolled patients (63.4%) who showed bilateral
involvement of chest computed tomography (CT) scan at the first time since onset.
And cases with bilateral involvement of chest CT scan during admission accounted for
80.5%, lower than the percentage previously reported [11, 12] (Table 2, Figure 1).
All 41 cases received at least twice nucleic acid detection of throat swab during
admission. Only those with normal temperature for more than 3 days, improved
respiratory symptoms, obvious absorption of pulmonary inflammation on radiography,
as well as twice negative nucleic acid detection of throat swab with interval more than
24 hours, can be released from quarantine and discharged, according to the Diagnosis

by

National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese
Medicine of China [15]. Cases with positive detection at first time accounted for 24.4%,
while those with at least once positive result during admission accounted for 34.1%.
(Table 2)
Treatment Situation and In-hospital Outcomes
There were 40 cases (97.6%) received at least one kind of antiviral drugs
empirically including oseltamivir, ribavirin, arbidol or lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra),
which were accessible clinically in China. Antibiotics or anti-fungus drugs were applied
in 95.1% cases regarding to confirmed secondary infection or preventing secondary
infection in relatively severe cases. Corticosteroid was used in 78.0% cases to
control immune overreaction. Human albumin was applied when serum albumin
decreased below 30g/L. Immunoglobulin was also applied empirically, as well as

thymosin. Cases who received Chinese traditional medicine accounted for 19.5%,
including patent medicine and prescription. There were 4 cases as of March 3 received
mesenchymal stem cell therapy after informed consent. One of them firstly consented
this empirical therapy on day 35 after symptom onset as pulmonary inflammation
poorly absorbed on CT scan (Figure 1). There were 23 cases (56.1%) underwent
respiratory support, including oxygen therapy through only common nasal catheter,
face mask, both common nasal catheter and face mask simultaneously, high flow nasal
cannula and mechanic ventilation. Only one case suffered from irreformable
hypoxemia, received noninvasive ventilator support, and later transferred to ICU for
tracheal intubation. (Table 3)
There was none in-hospital death, and none suffered from acute cardiac injury or
AKI during admission as to March 3,2020. Two cases were diagnosed as RF or ARDS
(4.9%). Most cases featured non-severe course of disease, accounted for 95.1%
according to official criteria [15, 25]. One case was recognized as acute myocyte injury
(2.4%). Cases suffered from acute hepatic injury accounted for 19.5%, who all received
conventional liver protecting treatment including Essentiale or diammonium
glycyrrhizinate. Secondary infection happened in 20 cases (48.8%). Only one case
(2.4%) transferred to the negative pressure respiratory ward of ICU in Wuhan Chest
Hospital for invasive mechanical ventilation and received extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO) support on the next day due to rapid deterioration. The total inhospital adverse event rate was 53.7%. There are still 5 cases not up to the discharge
criteria on the final date of follow-up, despite of clinical improvement and nucleic acid
detection of throat swab turning the negative [15, 25]. (Table 4)
A Comparative Analysis
Among 41 cases analyzed, patients with CVMs and those without CVMs
accounted for 58.5% and 41.5%, respectively. Compared with cases without CVMs,
patients with CVMs were presented with lower baseline lymphocyte count (0.99 ±
0.43 and 1.55 ± 0.61, P<0.001), more who had at least once positive nucleic acid
detection of throat swab during admission (50.0% and 11.8%, P=0.011), and more

received oxygen support (79.2% and 23.5%, P<0.001). The in-hospital adverse events
happened more in patients with CVMs group (75.0% and 23.5%, P=0.001).
Multivariable logistic regression model indicated that, after adjustment of the possible
baseline confounders, concomitant with CVMs was not independently associated with
in-hospital adverse events (OR 2.23, 95%CI 0.24-20.27, P = 0.478) in COVID-19 patients.
Baseline lymphocyte count showed a tendency of significance between the two
groups in model (OR 0.15, 95%CI 0.02-1.26, P = 0.081). (Table 5)
Discussion
The analyzed population is characterized as younger age, less comorbidities than
common community patients [11, 12], and mostly featured non-severe course of
disease, which is probably an important clinical characteristic of COVID-19 infection of
hospital staff. As of March 3, 2020, only one case underwent invasive mechanic
ventilation and ECMO support. Other cases all presented markedly improvement of
symptoms and findings on chest CT images, due to aggressive and comprehensive
medical treatment, although they also suffered from many adverse events during
hospitalization, like secondary infection or acute hepatic injury. This result is
consistent with the situation of infected hospital workers in a large data reported by
the NCP Emergency Response Epidemiology Team of China [13].
Our data showed that, the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital staff mostly had
definite or suspected history of patient contact, which was consistent with most
reports. The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 mainly characterized as confined space and
close contact. No other countries around the world experiences a similar time in great
favor of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, like the Spring Festival and the
Spring Festival travel season in China. During this period of year in China, people’ s
lives are full of behavior styles characterized as confined space and close contact,
including air or railway transportation for return home or travel, various familial or
public get-togethers. Nosocomial infection is another key feature of the outbreak. At
the early time of prevalence, a large number of suspected patients squeezed into fever
clinics or emergency departments of hospitals in Wuhan, in which health workers had

not well prepared in terms of both protective supplies and awareness. Meanwhile,
patients in incubation period of COVID-19 underwent elective surgeries who were
diagnosed after procedures made nosocomial infection quite a few on the early stage
of the outbreak. As continually support of protective materials from other areas into
Hubei Province, as well as improved knowledge of protection, data with decreased
risk of nosocomial infection are expected.
Xu et al reported the pathological findings of a 50-year-old male with COVID-19,
died of ARDS and sudden cardiac arrest. They found that there were a few interstitial
mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, but no other substantial damage in the heart
tissue [20]. The result implied the possibility of coexisting myocarditis, as part of
systemic inflammatory response syndrome. And the persistent hypoxemia may
directly cause myocardial suppression, possibly related to sudden cardiac arrest [21].
In other words, the CVMs of COVID-19 maybe more associated with the systemic
immune reaction, rather than direct damage of heart by virus attack. And these
mechanisms maybe explain the concomitant CVMs of COVID-19 were not
independently associated with adverse in-hospital outcomes to some extent.
In this study, there were about 20.5% of cases with non-severe course of COVID19 suffered from acute hepatic injury, needed liver protection treatment. And it
probably should not be totally attributed to drug-induced liver injury and aroused
more concern on COVID-19 itself. Xu et al reported the liver biopsy specimens of the
patient with COVID-19 showed moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular and
portal activity, indicating the injury could have been caused by either SARS-CoV-2
infection or drug-induced liver injury [20]. Pathological findings were also in favor of
more attention to the hepatic injury in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.
There is no specific antiviral drug for SARS-CoV-2 infection up to now. Expectation
mainly comes from evidences that remdesivir and chloroquine are highly effective in
the control of 2019-nCoV infection in vitro, while their cytotoxicity remains in control
[22]. It was reported that remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug, in previously
clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus disease, exhibited broad-spectrum

anti-coronavirus (CoV) activity. It could inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV) replication in multiple in vitro systems, and was also effective against bat CoVs,
prepandemic bat CoVs, and circulating contemporary human CoV in primary human
lung cells. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, prophylactic and early
therapeutic administration of remdesivir significantly reduced lung viral load and
improved clinical signs of disease as well as respiratory function [23]. These preclinical
evidences, together with successful clinical cases treated by remdesivir in USA and
France [24] made us looking forward to the final result of the randomized controlled
trial unblinding before long in Wuhan. Meanwhile, chloroquine has been recently
written into official recommendation for empirical therapy of COVID-19 for its
adequate safety data in human [25]. It is a cheap and safe drug that has been used as
an antimalarial for more than 70 years. Combination of lopinavir and ritonavir (Kaletra)
among SARS-CoV patients was reported a substantial clinical benefit [26]. As it is
available in the designated hospital as anti-human immunodeficiency virus drug, a
randomized controlled trial has been initiated quickly to assess the efficacy and safety
of it [11]. Other medication as newly recommended officially are mostly empirical.
Experience came from the outbreak of SARS-CoV 17 years ago. From empirical
medicine to evidence-based medicine, it is the only way which must be passed that
forms comprehensive knowledge about the new virus and the new disease. And for
this, the Chinese people have paid a heavy price, deserved to be remembered.
Limitation
Firstly, the cases enrolled in this study were only hospital staff. The conclusion
cannot be extrapolated to common community patients. Secondly, as the suddenness
of the outbreak, the vast patient volume in hospitals and shortage of healthcare
personnel, it is hard to obtain large clinical data. The sample is not large enough for
observation of mortality in severe cases of COVID-19. The multivariate model analysis
had limitation due to the sample size. And we cannot figure up how the research
variable effected each adverse in-hospital event. Lastly, the in-hospital outcomes were

monitored up to March 3, 2020, the final date of follow-up. The incomplete follow-up
data will be made up constantly. Besides, we are trying to collect the data of the severe
case who transferred to other hospital. Nevertheless, this is first-hand data in terms
of hospital staff infection in Wuhan, and the first analysis comparing the in-hospital
outcomes of COVID-19 between cases with CVMs and those without CVMs,
in anticipation of finding the risk factors in favor of severe conversion of non-severe
case.
Conclusions
Most hospital staff with COVID-19 had history of patient contact, featured a nonsevere course of disease. COVID-19 patients with CVMs suffered from more inhospital adverse events than those without CVMs. But the concomitant CVMs were
not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events in patients with COVID19.

A, Chest computed tomographic images obtained on February 1, 2020, show ground
glass opacity in both lungs on day 19 after symptom onset. B, Images taken on
February 9, 2020, show the slowly absorption of bilateral ground glass opacity after
about 4 weeks treatment. C, Images taken on February 16, 2020, show yet the poorly
absorption of bilateral ground glass opacity after about 5 weeks treatment. The
patients received mesenchymal stem cell therapy on February 17, 2020.
