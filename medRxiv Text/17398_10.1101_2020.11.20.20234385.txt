Abstract

14

While many patients infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

15

CoV-2) eventually produce neutralising antibodies, the degree of susceptibility of previously

16

infected individuals to reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown. To better

17

understand the impact of the immunoglobulin (IgG) level on reinfection in recovered

18

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, IgG levels against SARS-CoV-2 were

19

measured in 829 patients with previously confirmed infection just after their recovery.

20

Notably, 87 of these patients had no detectable IgG concentration. While there was just one

21

case of asymptomatic reinfection 4.5 months after the initial recovery amongst patients with

22

detectable IgG levels, 25 of the 87 patients negative for IgG were reinfected within one to

23

three months after their first infection. Therefore, patients who recover from COVID-19 with

24

no detectable IgG concentration appear to remain more susceptible to reinfection by SARS-

25

CoV-2, with no apparent immunity. Also, although our results suggest the chance is lower,

Introduction

30

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a novel

31

coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was

32

named so given the similarity of its symptoms to those induced by severe acute respiratory

33

syndrome [1]. Since the first reports of a viral pneumonia of unknown origin emerged from

34

China in late 2019, this disease has spread across the world, with new cases reported daily.

35

The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 range widely from asymptomatic to mild, moderate

36

and rapidly progressive severe (pneumonia) disease that can lead to death in some

37

individuals [2-4]. The moderate clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 include fever,

38

dyspnoea, fatigue, dry cough, myalgia and pneumonia. In severe cases, affected patients

39

may experience acute respiratory failure, septic shock and organ failure that might culminate

40

in death [5, 6].

41

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected people to others is suggested based on

42

epidemiology and clinical evidence [7, 8], with even asymptomatic infected individuals

43

believed to be capable of transmitting the virus [9, 10].

44

Infection by SARS-CoV-2 leads to a detectable immune response, but the susceptibility of

45

previously infected individuals to reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood given the

46

brevity of the worldwide pandemic to date. Generally, infection results in the generation of

47

neutralising antibodies in patients [11] [12]. SARS-CoV2 has the capacity to escape innate

48

immune responses, which allows the pathogen to produce large numbers of copies in

49

primarily infected tissues, usually airway epithelia [13]. Principally, patients who recover from

50

infectious diseases are usually immunised henceforth against infection by the causative

51

virus; however, reinfection by respiratory viruses is extremely common among humans of all

52

ages due to these viruses’ progressive evolution through RNA genome mutations that lead

53

to antigenic drift and immune escape. However, the complete mechanisms governing our

54

susceptibility to recurrent viral infections remain poorly understood [14, 15]. Although some

55

studies indicate the persistence of protective immunoglobulin IgG levels in the blood, saliva

56

and other body fluids for months after infection with SARS-CoV-2 [16, 17], limited numbers

57

of case studies of patients with COVID-19 have reported positive test results after the

58

disease symptoms had resolved and negative test results were recorded, supporting the

59

possibility of reinfection [18-20]. These reports included both patients with mild disease [21,

60

22]and others with more severe conditions [20, 23].

61

This study aimed to report an additional group of COVID-19 patients who were reinfected by

62

SARS-CoV-2 and argue that the IgG level is a potential marker of the reinfection risk.

Materials and Methods

64

Study population

65

The study included a group of 829 patients admitted to Qala Hospital, Kalar, Kurdistan

66

region, Iraq from the last week of May until the middle of October.

67

Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for the

68

diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2

69

Pharyngeal swabs were administered to extract SARS-CoV-2 RNA from each patient; then,

70

the total RNA was extracted using the AddPrep Viral Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit (Addbio Inc.,

71

Daejeon, South Korea). Next, The presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected by real-

72

time RT-PCR amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and

73

envelope (E) gene fragments. The amplification reactions were carried out with 10 µL of 2X

74

RT-PCR mastermix, 5 µL of primer/probe mix and 5 µL of template RNA for a final volume of

75

20 µL using the PowerChek SARS-CoV-2 Real-time PCR Kit (Kogenebiotech, Seoul,

76

Korea), described previously [24]. We followed the kit’s instructions and adopted the

77

following thermocycler protocol: 50°C for 30 minutes and 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by

78

40 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for one minute. When findings regarding the two

79

target genes (ORF1ab, E) were positive according to specific real-time RT-PCR, a sample

80

was defined as positive if the viral genome was detected at the cycle threshold value (Ct-

81

value) of 36.7 or less, while the Ct-value of greater 36.7 was defined as indicating a negative

82

test result or recovery (i.e., disappearance of signs and symptoms in a previously RT-PCR

83

positive patient).

84

Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay

85

A serum sample was collected from patients with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test

result just after their recovery.

87

The anti–SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody level was assessed using a commercially available

88

SARS-CoV-2 IgG test kit (Pishtaz Teb Diagnostics, Tehran, Iran) targeting the nucleocapsid

89

(N) antigen of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Sera were diluted 1:101. First, 10 µL of the specimen

90

together with 1,000 µL of the sample diluent was processed in a 96-well test kit. Then, 100

91

µL of each control serum and diluted specimens were placed into the appropriate well, with

92

the first two wells chosen as blanks and the next two chosen as negative control wells.

93

Positive controls were used as duplicates and the other wells were used for samples. Based

94

on the manufacturer’s formula; the following cutoffs were applied: 1.1, positive; 0.9 to 1.1,

95

equivocal; and less than 0.9, negative.

Ethics declarations

97

All methods were used in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Also, we

98

confirmed that all experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Licensing Committee

99

of the Kalar Technical Institute at the Sulaimani Polytechnic University (no. 02 on

100

Results

104

Our study found that 87 patients tested negative for IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2 after

105

recovery among a population of 829 patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 for the

106

first time. Twenty-six patients (14 male and 12 female patients, aged 10–60 years old) were

107

reinfected after recovery; of these, 25 patients were in the IgG-negative group and only one

108

patient was IgG-positive (Figure 1).

109

Just after recovery, IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 were found in the serum of

110

most of the reinfected patients. Only one patient was reinfected even though his IgG result

111

remained positive after recovery from COVID-19 (Table 1). Most IgG-negative patients

112

presented with just a couple of signs of COVID-19, including fever (96%) and myalgia (68%)

113

and continued cough (< 15% cases), while reinfected patients suffered more signs including

114

fever (96%), myalgia (88%), continuous cough (88%) and loss of taste and smell together

115

(72%). In addition, after reinfection more than 95% of the reinfected COVID-19 patients had

116

been immunised as evidenced by IgG antibody induction. Surprisingly, there was no

117

detectable IgG concentration in a male patient who had most of the common signs and

118

symptoms of COVID-19 during both his first infection and reinfection. Also, a male patient

119

(no. 26 in Tables 1 and 2) showed serum IgG level of 5.87 s/ca against SARS-CoV-2 after

120

recovery but was reinfected 138 days later. Interestingly, the reinfection induced his immune

121

system to produce IgG level by amount (2.08 s/ca) less than the first infection. The

122

occurrence of reinfection in the group ranged from 26 to 138 days after recovery from the

123

initial infection (Table 2).

Discussion

149

Approximately 90% of recovered COVID-19 patients produce a detectable level of

150

IgG [25]. In our study, among 829 infected cases, 742 IgG-positive recovered

151

patients were identified. The duration and viral magnitude can play a crucial role in

152

inducing the immune system to produce an adequate IgG level [26-28], which can be

153

an indicator of the severity of the disease [29]. Therefore, it may be postulated that

154

those patients who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection with IgG negativity in this

155

study were exposed to a lesser amount of viral antigen.

156

The degree of protective immunity conferred by prior infection and the possibility of

157

reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood [20]. This study reports that

158

around 10% of recovered COVID-19 patients showed no detectable IgG

159

concentration after recovery and prior to their reinfection. A pair of studies from Hong

160

Kong and Ecuador have reported SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in two IgG-negative

161

patients who previously recovered from COVID-19 [21, 22]. The IgG level appears to

162

be associated with the severity of the illness during the first infection; studies have

163

shown that patients with mild symptoms had no/lower antibody titers as compared

164

with those patients with more severe symptoms [21, 29, 30]. In our study, the degree

165

of disease severity in the reinfection period was worse in most patients than that

166

during the first instance of COVID-19. A similar case study was reported in a 46-

167

year-old male Ecuadorian patient [23]. This contradicts with the findings of a couple

168

of case studies in which patients were asymptomatic during their reinfection period

169

but were symptomatic during their first infection [21, 22]. The increase in disease

170

severity in reinfected patients can be due to a high viral load or a change in virus

171

virulence, which might have facilitated reinfection [20, 31]. The lack of a detectable

172

level of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 during the infection period in mild or asymptomatic

173

patients possibly makes them more susceptible to the reinfection. Therefore, in the

174

current study, it is believed that the vast majority of patients who showed detectable

175

levels of IgG after COVID-19 were thus protected from reinfection, even though the

176

time period of the immunity conferred by IgG against SARS-CoV-2 has not been

177

concluded yet [21]. Unexpectedly, a male patient was reinfected with COVID-19

178

without inducing IgG production a second time, which raises the question of possible

179

reinfection for a third time. Also, another male patient had detectable amounts of IgG

180

during his first infection and was reinfected after 138 days with no symptoms. That

181

may be due to a decrease in his IgG level as time passed as studies have suggested

182

neutralizing IgG levels start to decrease at six to 13 weeks after infection resolution

183

[29, 32, 33]. Mysteriously, the reinfection in the aforementioned patient induced a low

184

level of a detectable serum IgG concentration. This raises questions concerning the

185

presence of adaptive immunity in COVID-19 patients.

186

Conclusion

187

To conclude, a lack of IgG in patients who have recovered from COVID-19 may lead

188

some to become infected. IgG production possibly indicates the severity of the signs

189

and symptoms of COVID-19. Also, IgG levels against SARS-CoV-2 may decrease

190

with time. Further studies are needed to consider the efficiency and sustainability of

191

IgG, which are likely to play a vital role in the success of the COVID-19 vaccine

industry.
