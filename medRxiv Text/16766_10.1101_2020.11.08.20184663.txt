Abstract
Background: Mathematical modeling constitutes an important tool for planning robust
responses to epidemics. This study was conducted to guide the Qatari national response to the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic. The study
investigated the time course of the epidemic, forecasted healthcare needs, predicted the impact of
social and physical distancing restrictions, and rationalized and justified easing of restrictions.
Methods: An age-structured deterministic model was constructed to describe SARS-CoV-2
transmission dynamics and disease progression throughout the population.
Results: The enforced social and physical distancing interventions flattened the epidemic curve,
reducing the peaks for incidence, prevalence, acute-care hospitalization, and intensive care unit
(ICU) hospitalizations by 87%, 86%, 76%, and 78%, respectively. The daily number of new
infections was predicted to peak at 12,750 on May 23, and active-infection prevalence was
predicted to peak at 3.2% on May 25. Daily acute-care and ICU-care hospital admissions and
occupancy were forecast accurately and precisely. By October 15, 2020, the basic reproduction
number R0 had varied between 1.07-2.78, and 50.8% of the population were estimated to have
been infected (1.43 million infections). The proportion of actual infections diagnosed was
estimated at 11.6%. Applying the concept of Rt tuning, gradual easing of restrictions was
rationalized and justified to start on June 15, 2020, when Rt declined to 0.7, to buffer the
increased interpersonal contact with easing of restrictions and to minimize the risk of a second
wave. No second wave has materialized as of October 15, 2020, five months after the epidemic
peak.

Introduction
Mathematical modeling has become a fundamental tool to guide surveillance of infectious
diseases and emergency responses to epidemics [1-3]. Powered by surveillance and outbreak
data, infection transmission models help monitor and predict epidemiological trends using realtime estimation of key indicators, such as incidence of infection, severe and critical disease
cases, disease mortality, and basic reproduction number ( R0 ; the number of secondary infections
each infection would generate in a fully susceptible population [4]) [3].
Qatar is a peninsula located in the Arabian Gulf, with a diverse population of 2.8 million people
[5]. Like other countries, Qatar has been affected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic [6-9]. Yet, the nation mounted an evidence-informed
national response, in which in addition to early case identification, isolation, and quarantine
through contact tracing, diverse standardized and centralized sources of data were generated,
including population-based surveys. This wealth of data provided a special opportunity to
understand infection transmission dynamics, predict healthcare needs associated with the
resulting disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [10], and to inform the global
epidemiology of this infection.
Qatar has a unique socio-demography that affected the transmission patterns of SARS-CoV-2
[8,11], a respiratory infection that propagates through social networks. Nearly 90% of the
population are expatriates [5,12,13] with craft and manual workers (CMWs) constituting 60% of
the population [14]. Of the national subpopulations, Indians (28%) constitute the largest
population segment, followed by Bangladeshis (13%), Nepalese (13%), Qataris (11%),
Egyptians (9%), and Filipinos (7%) [13]. The CMW population is predominantly male, single,

and young, with the top three countries of origin being India, Bangladesh, and Nepal [14]. Most
CMWs live in shared housing accommodations akin to dormitories [15].
This study was conducted to describe SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Qatar and to craft
a national response using mathematical modeling of the epidemic time-course, predicting the
impact of social and physical distancing restrictions and the impact of easing those restrictions,
and forecasting healthcare needs, in terms of hospitalizations requiring acute-care and intensive
care unit (ICU) beds. The study was initiated before the identification of the first laboratoryconfirmed case of community transmission on March 6, 2020, and has continued to provide realtime projections and forecasts since then.
The overarching aim of the present article was to provide the technical tools and a “case study”
to demonstrate how individual countries can use mathematical modeling to effectively craft
national public-health responses and to formulate evidence-based policy decisions that minimize
the epidemic’s toll on morbidity, mortality, societies, and economies.
Methods
Mathematical model
Building on our previously developed models [8,16-19], an age-structured, meta-population,
deterministic mathematical model was constructed to describe SARS-CoV-2 transmission
dynamics and disease progression (Figure S1 of Supplementary Material (SM)). The model
stratified the Qatari population into groups (“compartments”) according to the major nationality
groups (Indians, Bangladeshis, Nepalese, Qataris, Egyptians, Filipinos, and all other
nationalities), age group by decile, infection status (infected, uninfected), severity of illness

(asymptomatic/mild, severe, critical), and disease/hospitalization stage (severe, critical), using
sets of coupled, nonlinear, differential equations. A detailed description of the model is available
in the SM.
The risk of acquiring the infection varied between susceptible populations based on nationality,
infectious contact rate per day, age-specific exposure/susceptibility to the infection, and
subpopulation-mixing and age-mixing matrices parametrizing the mixing between individuals in
different nationality and age groups. Following a latency period, infected individuals in the
model develop an asymptomatic/mild, severe, or critical infection. The age-dependence of the
proportions of infected persons developing asymptomatic/mild, severe, or critical infections was
based on the modeled SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France [20]. Severe and critical infections
progress to severe and critical disease, respectively, prior to recovery. Patients are hospitalized in
acute-care and ICU-care beds, respectively, based on existing standards of care in Qatar. Critical
disease cases have an additional risk of COVID-19 mortality.
The model was parameterized using the best available data for SARS-CoV-2 natural history and
epidemiology. A detailed description of model parameters, definitions, values, and justifications
is found in Tables S1-S2 in the SM. The size and demographic structure of the population of
Qatar were based on a population census conducted by Qatar’s Planning and Statistics Authority
[5]. Life expectancy was obtained from the United Nations World Population Prospects database
[21].
Model fitting and analyses
The model was fitted to the standardized and centralized databases of SARS-CoV-2 testing,
infections, hospitalizations, and mortality [8], as well as to findings of ongoing epidemiologic

studies [8,11,22,23]. Data included: 1) time-series of the number of polymerase chain reaction
(PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, 2) time-series of the SARS-CoV-2 testing PCR positivity
rate in each national subpopulation, 3) time-series of the PCR positivity rate in symptomatic
patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection coming to primary healthcare centers, 4) timeseries of the proportion of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases aged >60 years, 5) timeseries of new/daily hospital admissions in acute-care beds and ICU-care beds, 6) the proportion
of acute-care cases subsequently transferred to ICUs , 7) time-series of hospital occupancy in
acute-care and ICU-care beds, 8) the cumulative number of deaths (not time series, due to the
relatively small number of deaths), 9) a community survey assessing active-infections using
PCR, 10) age-distribution of antibody positivity [8,22,23], and 11) national subpopulation
distribution of antibody positivity [8,22,23]. A nonlinear least-square data fitting method, based
on the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm, was used to conduct the model fitting [24].
Model fitting was used to estimate epidemiologic indicators such as incidence, prevalence, attack
rate (proportion of the population ever infected), and R0 , as well as to forecast acute-care and
ICU-care hospital admissions and hospital bed occupancy. The model was further used to
evaluate the impact of implemented social and physical distancing restrictions by comparing
model projections of the actual epidemic to those in a counter-factual scenario in which such
interventions were not enforced. Informed by global estimates of R0 in the early epidemic that
ranged between 2-4 [25,26], the counter-factual scenario with no interventions was implemented
assuming R0 = 3 . The model was also used to predict the impact of different scenarios for easing
of social and physical distancing restrictions.

Five hundred simulation runs were conducted to determine the range of uncertainty attending
model predictions. At each run, Latin Hypercube sampling was applied in selecting input
parameter values [27,28] from pre-specified ranges that assume ±30% uncertainty around
parameter point estimates. The model was then refitted to input data. The resulting distribution
for each model prediction, based on the 500 runs, was used to derive the mean and 95%
uncertainty interval (UI).
Mathematical modeling analyses were conducted in MATLAB R2019a (Boston/MA/USA) [29]
whereas statistical analyses were performed in STATA/SE 16.1 (College Station, TX) [30].
Results
The model fitted the various data sources (examples in Figures S2-S3). Figure 1 shows model
predictions for evolution of SARS-CoV-2 incidence, cumulative incidence, active-infection
prevalence, and attack rate in the total population. Peak incidence was estimated at 12,750 new
infections on May 23, 2020 while peak prevalence was estimated at 3.2% on May 25, 2020. By
October 15, 2020, an estimated 1,426,500 infections were projected to have occurred, for a
proportion of the population infected of 50.8%. Also by October 15, 2020, the proportion of all
infections that had actually been diagnosed and confirmed by PCR was estimated at 11.6%. R0
varied between 1.07-2.78 from March 1 to October 15, with the highest values reached well after
the onset of easing of restrictions on June 15, 2020 (Figure S4A of SM).
Figure 2A-2B shows model-predicted daily hospital admissions in acute-care and ICU-care beds,
respectively. New hospital admissions were predicted to peak at 292 acute-care beds on May 22,
2020 and 23 ICU-care beds on May 27, 2020. Figure 2C-2D shows evolution of hospital

occupancy in acute-care and ICU-care beds. Peaks were predicted at 1,910 acute-care beds on
May 27, 2020 and 244 ICU-care beds on June 6, 2020. The average hospital stay in an acute-care
bed was estimated at 7.7 days while the stay in an ICU-care bed was estimated at 14.0 days.
These model predictions agreed with actual COVID-19 hospital admission data (Figure S3 of
SM).
Discussions with policymakers to plan easing of social and physical distancing restrictions were
initiated in April of 2020. The effective reproduction number ( Rt ), the number of secondary
infections each infection is generating at a given time, t , heavily influenced these discussions.
Based on the model-predicted evolution of Rt at that time (Figure 3A), it was advised that no
easing of restrictions should occur before the epidemic peak, then predicted to occur on May 20,
as the epidemic was still in its exponential growth phase ( Rt  1 ). Model simulations confirmed
that premature easing of restrictions would result in epidemic amplification (Figure 3B). To
minimize the likelihood of a second wave and to buffer against a potential increased contact rate
in the population, it was advised that easing of restrictions should not start before Rt reached
0.70, and that easing of restrictions should be implemented gradually over at least two months.
Model simulations confirmed this rationale, and indicated that gradual easing of restrictions after

Rt reached 0.70 would minimize the risk of a second wave (Figure 3C). Accordingly,
policymakers planned and subsequently implemented a gradual easing of restrictions starting
June 15, 2020, the day on which Rt was predicted to decline to 0.7. This line of analysis and
rationale proved successful, as no second wave had materialized as of October 15, 2020, five
months after the epidemic peak (Figure 3D).

Figures 4 and S5 (SM) show the predicted evolution of the epidemic in the counter-factual
scenario of no social and physical distancing interventions. In the absence of these interventions,
the epidemic would have peaked at 97,100 new infections per day on April 3, 2020 (Figure 4A),
and at a prevalence of 23.4% on April 5, 2020 (Figure 4B). New hospital admissions would have
peaked at 1,235 acute-care bed admissions on April 7, 2020 (Figure 4C) and at 103 ICU-care bed
admissions on April 10, 2020 (Figure 4D). Accordingly, by October 15, 2020, the enforced
social and physical distancing restrictions reduced the peaks for incidence, prevalence, and
acute-care and ICU-care hospital admissions by >75% (Figure 4A-4D), and averted 840,000
infections (37%; Figure S5A of SM), 209 deaths (46%; Figure S5B of SM), 10,110 acute-care
hospital admissions (32%; Figure S5C of SM), and 1,056 ICU-care hospital admissions (34%;
Figure S5D of SM). These results show the extent of flattening of the epidemic curve that was
accomplished with the enforced social and physical distancing interventions.
Figure S6 of SM shows the results of the uncertainty analysis for the key epidemiological
indicators in Figure 1, and Figure S7 of SM shows the results of the uncertainty analysis for the
key hospitalization indicators in Figure 2. The results indicated overall narrow uncertainty
intervals confirming the model’s predictive power.
Discussion
Our study demonstrates that mathematical modeling was influential in informing the national
public-health response and in formulating evidence-based policy decisions to minimize the
pandemic’s toll on health, society, and the economy. The model, which was implemented in realtime, starting from March 2020, and was continuously updated and refined as more data became
available, predicted with reasonable accuracy and precision the key epidemiologic indicators,

such as the epidemic peak and the impact of easing of restrictions, as well as healthcare needs, at
a time of uncertainty in which knowledge of the epidemiology of this infection was growing but
still limited.
One of the highlights of this modeling approach is the application of the concept of rational Rt
tuning for managing the easing of restrictions (Figure 4). Grounded on a theoretical foundation
[4], rational Rt tuning proved to be a successful and effective strategy in safely easing the
restrictions so as to ensure social and economic stability and functionality, while minimizing the
risk of a second wave (Figure 3). Another highlight is the estimation of healthcare needs that
guided resource-allocation planning well before the time when these resources were needed.
Throughout the epidemic, including the epidemic peak, healthcare needs in Qatar remained well
within the health system capacity, avoiding any serious strain. Importantly, this forecasting of
healthcare needs also prevented resource waste by avoiding overestimation of healthcare needs.
Despite the large number of infections in Qatar, results show that the epidemic would have been
far worse if no social and physical distancing interventions had been enforced. In absence of
interventions, the epidemic would have progressed very rapidly to a peak nearly 10-fold higher
than what was actually observed (Figure 4). Disease burden would have been much larger and
the healthcare system would have been strained to the point of collapse. This demonstrates that
for a respiratory infection with such large R0 and serious disease sequalae, inaction would have
had dire consequences, and that the national strategy focused on flattening the epidemic curve
was appropriate to manage the epidemic.

An important finding of this study is that PCR-confirmed infections constitute only a small
fraction of the actual number of infections. Only 11.6% of infections were estimated to have ever
been diagnosed, probably because most infections were asymptomatic or mild. Indeed, a nationwide population-based survey in Qatar showed that 58.5% of those who were PCR positive in
this survey reported no symptoms during the last two weeks preceding the survey [8]. The
growing number of serological testing studies in Qatar have also shown that the vast majority of
those who are antibody-positive were never diagnosed with this infection [8,11,22,23]. For
instance, out of all those antibody-positive in a nation-wide seroprevalence survey of the CMW
population, only 9.3% had a documented, PCR-confirmed infection prior to antibody testing,
affirming that as estimated by the model, nine of every 10 infections were never diagnosed.
These findings are also consistent with a growing body of serological evidence from other
countries [31-35].
We found that >97% of infections estimated to have occurred did not require hospitalization. The
low infection severity appears to be a consequence of the young age profile of the population,
with only 2% being >60 years of age [5,8,17,36], in addition to a well-funded healthcare system
that emphasizes a proactive, high-quality standard of care [8], and possibly high levels of T cell
cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2, reflecting T cell memory of circulating ‘common cold’
coronaviruses [37-41].
This study has limitations. Model estimates are contingent on the validity and generalizability of
input data. Our estimates were based on current SARS-CoV-2 natural history and disease
progression parameters, but our understanding of this infection is still evolving. Available input
data were most complete at the national level. We did not have sufficient data about social

networks of different national subpopulations and patterns of mixing between those
subpopulations to factor them into the model. Despite these limitations, our model, tailored to the
complexity of the epidemic in Qatar, was able to reproduce observed epidemic trends, and to
provide useful and consequential predictions and insights about infection transmission and
healthcare needs. Importantly, the modeling estimates successfully influenced the national
response.
In conclusion, Qatar experienced a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, but avoided a burdensome
epidemic, such as that unfolding in other counties. Mathematical modeling played an influential
role in guiding the national public-health response by characterizing and understanding the
epidemic, forecasting healthcare needs, predicting the impact of social and physical distancing
restrictions, and rationalizing and justifying the easing of restrictions. While this article
illustrates a successful case study, the modeling tools employed here can be adapted and applied
in other countries to guide SARS-CoV-2 epidemic control, preparedness for the current or future
waves of infection, or enforcement and easing of restrictions or other interventions, such as
vaccination [19].

I. SARS-CoV-2 mathematical model structure
A deterministic age-structured meta-population compartmental model was developed to describe
the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission dynamics and
disease progression in the population of Qatar, factoring subpopulation heterogeneity in exposure
to the infection. The model stratified the population into compartments according to nationality
subpopulation, age group (0-9, 10-19, 20-29,…, ≥80 years), infection status (infected,
uninfected), infection stage (asymptomatic/mild, severe, critical), and disease stage (severe
disease or critical disease). All Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality was assumed to
occur in individuals that are in the critical disease stage. The model is based on extension and
adaptation of our calibrated mathematical models developed to characterize SARS-CoV-2
transmission dynamics [1-5].
Epidemic dynamics were described using a system of coupled nonlinear differential equations
for each age group and subpopulation (nationality) group. Each age group, a , denoted a ten-year
age band apart from the last category which grouped together all individuals ≥80 years of age.
The population was divided into seven resident subpopulation groups i ( i = 1, 2,3, 4,5, 6, 7 )
representing the subpopulations of Indians, Bangladeshis, Nepalese, Qataris, Egyptians,
Filipinos, and all other nationalities, respectively—these are the largest nationality subpopulation
groups in Qatar. Qatar’s population composition and subpopulations size and demographic
structure were based on findings of “The Simplified Census of Population, Housing, and
Establishments” conducted by Qatar’s Planning and Statistics Authority [6]. Life expectancy was
obtained from the United Nations World Population Prospects database [7].

To account for temporal variation in the basic reproduction number ( R0 ), we incorporated
temporal changes in the rate of infectious contacts. We parameterized the temporal variation
(time dependence of  ) through the following combined function of the Woods-Saxon and

This function was mathematically designed to describe and characterize the time evolution of the
level of risk of exposure before and after easing of restrictions. It was informed by our
knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology in Qatar [4], and it provided a robust fit to the data.
Here a1 , a2 , b1 , b2 , c1 , and c2 are fitting parameters.
The mixing among the different age groups and subpopulation groups is dictated by the mixing
matrices H a ,a ',i ' (for age group mixing) and Z i ,i (for subpopulation group mixing). These

II. Model fitting and parameter values
The model was fitted to the following sources of data: 1) time-series of the number of
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, 2) time-series of
SARS-CoV-2 testing PCR positivity rate in each nationality subpopulation, 3) time-series of
PCR positivity rate in symptomatic patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting to
primary healthcare centers, 4) time-series of proportion of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2
cases aged >60 years, 5) time-series of new/daily hospital admissions in acute-care beds and in
ICU-care beds, 6) proportion of acute-care bed cases transferred subsequently to ICU-care beds,
7) time-series of hospital occupancy in acute-care beds and in ICU-care beds, 8) cumulative
number of deaths (not time series with the relatively small number of deaths), 9) one community
survey assessing active-infection using PCR, 10) age-distribution of antibody positivity [4,8,9],
and 11) nationality subpopulation distribution of antibody positivity [4,8,9].
Model input parameters were based on best available empirical data for SARS-CoV-2 natural
history and epidemiology. Model parameter values are listed in Table 2. The following
parameters were derived by fitting the model to data: fC ,  S , C ,  SC ,  ,  ( a ) ,  ( i ) , eAge , q ,
