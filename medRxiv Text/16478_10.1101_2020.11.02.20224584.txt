Abstract
Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first identified in China,
spreads rapidly across the globe and is considered the fastest moving pandemic in history.
The new disease has challenged policymakers and scientists on key issues such as the
magnitude of the first-time problem, the susceptibility of the population, the severity
of the disease, and its symptoms. Most countries have adopted “lockdown” policies
to reduce the spatial spread of COVID-19, but they have damaged the economic and
moral fabric of society. Timely action to prevent the spread of the virus is critical, and
mathematical modeling in non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) policy management
has proven to be a major weapon in this fight due to the lack of an effective COVID-19
vaccine.
Methods: We present a new hybrid model for COVID-19 dynamics using both an
age-structured mathematical model and spatio-temporal model in silico, analyzing the
data of COVID-19 in Israel. The age-structured mathematical model is based on SIRD
two age-class model. The spatial model examines a circle of day and night (with one-hour
resolution) and three main locations (work / school or home) for every individual.
Results: We determine mathematically the basic reproduction number R0 via the
next-generation matrix based on Markov chain theory. Then, we analyze the stability
of the equilibria and the effects of the significant differences in infection rates between
children and adults. Using the hybrid model, we have introduced a method for estimating
the reproduction number of an epidemic in real time from the data of daily notification
of cases. The results of the proposed model are confirmed by the Israeli Lockdown
experience with a mean square error of 0.205 over two weeks. The model was able to
predict changes in R0 by opening schools on September 1, 2020, resulting in R0 = 2.2,
which entailed a month’s quarantine of all areas of life. According to the model, by
extending the school day to 9 hours, and assuming that children and adults go to school
and work every day (except weekends), we get a significant reduction in R0 of 1.45.
Finally, model-based analytical-numerical results are obtained and displayed in graphical
profiles.
Conclusions: The use of mathematical models promises to reduce the uncertainty
in the choice of “Lockdown” policies. Our unique use of contact details from 2 classes
(children and adults), the interaction of populations depending on the time of day
(the cycle of day and night), and several physical locations, allowed a new look at the
differential dynamics of the spread and control of infection. Using knowledge about how
the length of the work and school day affects the dynamics of the spread of the disease
can be useful for improving control programs, mitigation, and policy.

Author summary
Everybody in the modern world understands today that the pandemics threat is not less
dangerous than the wars. COVID-19 showed us that pandemics effects the economies of
all the countries over the world brings to a total lockdown of social life and enormous
mortality. There was no effective vaccine/treatment, to stop the spread of COVID-19
and, therefore, policymakers have taken unprecedented measures, including quarantines,
public health measures, travel bans, and others, without knowing in advance the effect
of these restrictions.
In this study, we develop a mathematical model of the pandemic spread taking into
account the different dynamics of the disease in two age groups of children and adults.
Using this model we succeeded to simulate the COVID-19 spread in Israel. The current
study accurately predicts the effect of the work/school lockdown on the outbreaks. We
have proven that by keeping schools open and increasing the school day to 8-9 hours,
infection rates are reduced. Our results also show that if at least half of the adult
population is a lockdown, the effect of children’s isolation on the infection rate is small,
indicating the importance of multiple age groups of the population in the selection of
restrictions.

At the beginning of 2020, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19 reached Europe and the western world
from China [1]. Similar to other diseases from the coronavirus family, COVID-19 is
transmitted human-to-human, but it turned out that COVID-19 is more infectious and
transmissible than previous coronavirus [2].
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-2019 a public health
emergency of international concern [3,4]. Currently, due to a lack of an efficient vaccine or
clinical treatment to COVID-19, policy-makers are forced to rely on non-pharmaceutical
intervention (NPI) policies to reduce the infection rate and control the epidemic. A few
examples of NPI policies are masks, social distancing, work capsules, and partial to a full
lockdown of central locations (restaurants, malls, offices, etc.). These policies reduce the
infection rate but have an influence on the economy, healthcare system, and social life.
Multiple studies have been conducted to study epidemics in general and the COVID-19
epidemic in particular from both biological and epidemiological perspective providing the
information about the epidemics behavior with relevant data for later modeling [1, 5–9].
In addition, these studies examine the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, enabling a
deeper understanding of the disease spreads in the population.
Mathematical models are shown to be a useful tool for policy-makers to make datadriven decisions based on investigation of different scenarios and their outcomes in a
controlled manner [5, 10, 11]. These mathematical models can be divided into two main
groups.
First, models aim to predict the different parameters such as the total COVID-19
related death and peak in hospitalized individuals, given the historical data up to some
point. For example, Nesteruk [12] used the data from January 16 to February 9 (2020),
from mainland China with the continuous SIR (S-susceptible, I-infected, R-recovered)
model. Nesteruk [12] fitted the SIR model using the least mean square method, which
resulted in poor fitting to later officially confirmed infected cases [4]. This can be
explained by the fact that the SIR model with no modification is too simplistic to
correctly represent the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic. In [12], a simple calculation
method was proposed that allows quick results which can predict the COVID-19 spread
with a fine accuracy if calculated using a very accurate data of infections and recoveries.

Model proposed by Tuite et al. [11] which used data from January 25 to March 1
(2020) Ontario, Canada, is SEIR (E-exposed) model, the extension of the SIR model.
Authors of [11] took into consideration four levels of infection severity, social isolation in
the exposed and infected states, hospitalization dynamics, and death state. [11] estimated
that 56% of the Ontario population would be infected over the course of the epidemic
with a peak of 55500 cases in intensive care units (ICU) and 107000 total cases. At the
same time, in all of Canada there are only half of this number of infections [4]. This
error in their prediction is associated with incomplete information due to lower frequency
of tests and inaccurate ICU records. Nevertheless, Tuite et al’s [11] model presents a
more detailed dynamic between the infected population and the healthcare response
which policy-makers can take into consideration.
Ivorra et al. [13] proposed nine states model divides individuals into isolated, hospitalized, or dead. In addition, authors of [13] take into consideration the fact that the
recorded confirmed data is under-sampled.
Furthermore, a machine learning-based model was proposed by Allam et al. [14] using
several machine learning algorithms (Knn, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) on
data of 53 clinical cases. This model was used to predict infection severity and spread.
However, this approach suffers from an imbalanced sample of the distribution of severity
in the population, as simple or asymptomatic cases are not reported, leading to poor
representation of the real dynamic.
Second, models aim to analyze and optimize NPI policies. A model proposed by
Zhao et al. [15] is an extension to the SEIR model where the susceptible population
is separated into two groups: individuals not taking infection-prevention actions and
people taking infection-prevention actions as an NPI policy. In addition, authors of [15]
included a probability of willingness to take infection-prevention actions with changes
over time. They predicted 148.5 thousand infections by the end of May 2020 in Wuhan
alone while in all of China there were 84.5 thousand infections at the same time [4]. The
authors introduces a stochastic element to the SEIR model making it more robust for
social changes happened during the epidemic.
Di Domenico et al. [16] used data from March 17 to May 11 (2020) Île-de-France with
a stochastic age-structured transmission extension of the SEIR model integrating data
on age profile and social contacts of four age-based classes. In this model, hospitalization
dynamics with ICU cases are taken into consideration in the model. Model shows that
during full lockdown the reproductive number is estimated to be 0.68, due to an 81%
reduction of the average number of contacts. These results show that dividing the
population into several age-based classes better represent the spread of COVID-19 from
an epidemiological perspective [17, 18].
In this paper, we provide and study a more accurate spatio-temporal model for
the COVID-19 transmission by using individual two age classes SIRD named hybrid
model (D-death) model. We study two important factors concerning the diffusion of
COVID-19: schooling/working hours and physical location of infected population has
provided new insights into the epidemic dynamics. Based on the different impact of
COVID-19 to the immune response, severity of infection and transmission disease in
different age groups (mainly children and adults) [17, 19], we proposed a two classes
age-structured SIRD epidemic model dividing the population into children and adults.
Moreover, we developed a numerical, stochastic simulator based on this hybrid model
(https://teddylazebnik.info/coronavirus-sir-simulation/index.html) for COVID-19 population spread in addition to the analytical examination of the epidemic dynamics.
This paper is organized as follows: First, we introduce our mathematical hybrid
model based on the SIRD model with dual age-structured. Second, we present the
model’s equilibria, stability analysis, and asymptotic form. Third, we present the spatial
model extending the SIRD model by introducing a day-night circle and three locations of

As shown in [20] and [21], the spatial model plays an important role in describing the
spreading of communicable diseases, because individuals move around inside a zone or
habitat in time.
In this section, we present a hybrid model (Fig 1) that is based on a SIRD model
for two age classes using eight populations (dynamics are shown in Fig 2) and a spatial
model where these populations are distributed in space and time between work, school
and home (Fig 5). We will define these sub-models in the following sections.

Two class age-structured epidemic model

106

The SIR model is proven to be a meaningful mathematical tool for epidemic analysis [22].
This model with the needed modifications has already been shown to predict the epidemics
such as COVID-19 [23], influenza [24], Ebola [10], and others.
Data from several epidemiological studies show that children and adults transmit
the disease at different rates [17, 19]. In addition, adults, on average, have a much longer
recovery duration compared to children [6, 8]. Therefore, a SIR model which takes into
consideration the different age groups better represents the epidemiological population

explanation of Polio outbreak by Bunimovich-Mendrazitsky and Stone [25].
Model definition

114
115

116

The model considers a constant population with a fixed number of individuals N . Each
individual belongs to one of the three groups: susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered
(R) such that N = |S| + |I| + |R|. When an individual in the susceptible group (S)
exposed to the infection, it is transferred to the infected group (I). The individual stays
in this group on average dI→R days, after which it is transferred to the recovered group
(R).
In addition to these groups, we define a death group (D) which is associated with
individuals that are not able to fully recover from the disease or succumb to death.
Individuals from the infected group (I) recover from the disease in some chance and
move to (R), while the others do not and move to (D). Therefore, in each time unit,
some rate of infected individuals recover while others die or remain seriously ill.
We divide the population into two classes based on their age: children and adults
because these groups experience the disease in varying degrees of severity and have
different infection rates. In addition, adults and children are present in various discrete
locations throughout many hours of the day which affects the spread dynamics. Individuals below age A are associated with the ”children” age-class while individuals in the
complementary group are associated with the ”adult” age-class. The specific threshold
age (A) may differ in different locations but the main goal is to divide the population
into two representative age-classes. Since it takes A years from birth to move from a
child to an adult age group, the conversion rate is set as α := A1 .
By expanding the designation to two age-classes, we let Sc , Ic , Rc , Dc and Sa , Ia , Ra , Da
represent susceptible, infected, recovered, and death groups for children and adults,
respectively such that

Nc = |Sc | + |Ic | + |Rc | + |Dc |, Na = |Sa | + |Ia | + |Ra | + |Da |, and N = Nc + Na .
The model does not take into consideration death during the epidemic unrelated
to the disease itself because in the United States in 2018 the birth rate was 11.6 for
every 1000 individuals [26] while the mortality rate in 2017 was 8.6 for every 1000
individuals [27], resulting in around 0.3% increment of the population size which is
assumed to be small enough to be neglected. In addition, we introduce two death states
for children and adults, respectively, that died from the epidemic.

The parameters used in the calculation of the model throughout the paper are
presented in Table. 1. The values are cited from the sources themselves except A and βca
calculated from the data of the correlated source [6, 17]. The threshold of the children’s
age to become adults in parameter A is set to 13 year as the mean value of the group
of ages in which the percentage of critical cases relative to all cases is the highest as
reported by Dong et al. [6] (Table 2). The susceptible contacts in children who become
infected due to direct disease transmission from an adult βca are calculated based on
data of 10 children. Eight children out of the 10 have been exposed to 30 adults in total
and later found to be infected, as reported by Cai et al. [17]. Therefore, the infected

rate is set to 30

To obtain a better understanding of how different parameter values influence the system

the population distribution of all eight populations (marked by Sc (t), Sa (t), Ic (t), Ia (t),
Rc (t), Ra (t), Dc (t), and Da (t)). We processed eight-order Runge–Kutta integration on
the differential system to enable numerical simulations. Runge–Kutta integration of
the equations was implemented by Octave programming (version 5.2.0), using standard
program lsode, for a set of initial conditions described in Eq (10).
The solutions of the system (9-10) are shown in Fig 3. In addition, the population

Ia (t), Rc (t), Ra (t), Dc (t), and Da (t) where the x-axis in all eight graphs represents the
time (in days) that has passed from the beginning of the dynamics and the y-axis is the
size of each population, respectively. A maximum in the percent of infected children and
adults (39%, 89%) is reached in the 8th and 11th days as shown in Fig 3. Therefore, the
maximum infected population was 89% of the whole population. Besides, all children
infected and recovered after 17 days while all adults recovered after 82 days.

In epidemiology, it is essential to quantify the severity of outbreaks of infectious diseases.
The standard parameter indicates the severity called the basic reproduction number R0 .
In the standard SIR model [22], R0 is defined to be the ratio between individual infection
rate and recovery rate, where almost everyone is susceptible (namely, Sc + Sa ∼ N ). For
any start condition and parameters, at t → ∞ the model’s state is an instance of Eq
(10) according to Lemma 1.

model takes the form:
Sc (t) = 0, Ic (t) = 0, Rc (t) = 0, Dc (t) = g2 ,

Proof. Define a non-homogeneous continuous-time Markov chain M with state space
with eight values in respect to Sc , Sa , Ic , Ia , Rc , Ra , Dc , and Da . Table 2 represents
the transition matrix of M where
v1 (t) :=

βcc Ic (t) + βca Ia (t)
,
Nc

v2 (t) :=

240
241
242

βac Ic (t) + βaa Ia (t)
.
Na

In order to model the dynamics as a Markov chain one needs to show that
P (Xt+h = j|Xt = it , ..., X0 = i0 ) = P (Xt+h = j|Xt = it ),

243

(12)

where {X}t is a stochastic process with values in the state space for all t ≥ 0 and all
states i0 , ...it , j and h is an arbitrary small step in time [31]. M satisfies Eq (12) if both
v1 (t), v2 (t) depend only on the last state Xt = it .

+ Ia (t)),

(14)

such that (=∗ ) stands for Ic (t+h) = Ic (t)+dIc (t), Ia (t+h) = Ia (t)+dIa (t). From Eq (13)
and (14), v1 (t + h) and v2 (t + h) depends only on the previous state Xt = it , respectively.
Let π ∈ N8 be the initial condition for the system. Therefore, the model’s state at some
time t is defined by At π. For any initial condition π, the vector limt→∞ (At π) takes the
form
[0, N − Σ3i=0 gi , 0, 0, 0, g1 , g2 , g3 ],
where g1 , g2 , g3 ∈ [0, ..., N ].
From Table 2 one can see that Ra , Dc , and Da are stationary values because
t
∀t ∈ N : M{R
= M{Ra ,Dc ,Da } = I3X3 . By setting π = [Nc , Na , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] one

gets ∀t ∈ N : v1 (t) = v2 (t) = 0 and therefore the sub matrix of M with only the states
Sc and Sa takes the form

and for limt→∞ (1 − α)t = 0 meaning that asymptotically the population in Sc decreases
to zero. Therefore, the asymptotic state of the model takes the form:

258
259

Sc (t) = 0, Ic (t) = 0, Rc (t) = 0, Dc (t) = g2 ,
Sa (t) = N − Σ3i=0 gi , Ia (t) = 0, Ra (t) = g1 , Da (t) = g3 ,
for any initial condition π and parameters such that α, γa , γc , βaa , βcc > 0.

In order to find g (from Lemma 1) for given initial conditions and parameters, it is
possible to use the next generation matrix approach [32]. Let Vi+ be the rate of transfer
of individuals by all means except of appearance of new infections in compartment i,
and Vi− be the rate of transfer of individuals out of compartment i. Let Fi be the rate
of appearance of new infections in compartment i. Eq (1 - 8) takes the form:
dui
= Vi+ (u) − Vi− (u) + Fi (u),

where C ∈ N is the first index that satisfies Ic (C) + Ia (C) = 0.
It is possible to retrieve R0 from the next generation matrix G as it is the dominant
eigenvalue of the matrix [25], as this matrix describes the total amount of infections
caused by each class over the lifetime of the infection. The epidemic is assumed to be
stable if R0 ≤ 1. This means that for each infected individual there is less than one
infected individual in any of the groups in the next time unit. The dominant eigenvalue of
G can be calculated using the characteristic equation which is a second-order polynomial
of R0 . The zero points of this polynomial are

{βaa , βac , βca , βcc } calculated using Eq (16). Fig 4a shows the βaa − βac projection
where βcc = 0.308, βca = 0.266. There are no values such that R0 < 1 and from the
color gradient, it is possible to see that βac has slightly more influence on R0 relatively
to βaa . Fig 4b shows the βaa − βca projection where βcc = 0.308, βac = 0. There are no
values such that R0 < 1 and from the color gradient, it is possible to see that βaa has
a minor to no influence on R0 relatively to βca . Fig 4c shows the βcc − βca projection
where βaa = 0.308, βca = 0.266. R0 < 1 for any combination of βcc , βac such that

In order to obtain the equilibria points of the model and their stability properties,
the Jacobian (J) is obtained by linearizing Eqs (3) and (4) in the system (Eqs (1 - 8)).

There are other equilibria for trivial cases such as Sa (0) = 0 or Sc (0) = 0 which are
unrealistic for real-world dynamics. Below we investigate the stability of four nontrivial
equilibria.
EQ1 : is the case for Ic (t) = Ia (t) = 0 for every t ∈ N (see Table 3). This is a trivial
equilibrium where there is no epidemic at all. Because the model does not take into
consideration the birth of new children, after A days all children become adults and EQ1
is derived. By settings J(EQ1 ), all eigenvalues are negative for all parameter values
c

except λ = −γa + βaa N a+N
< γa .
N a . Therefore, this equilibrium is stable if βaa N a
EQ2 : is the case for Ia (t) = 0 for every t ∈ N (see Table 3). This equilibrium can be
achieved if βac = 0 because in any other case (assuming Sa (0) > 0) exists time t such
a (t)
that dIdt
> 0 and therefore Ia (t + 1) 6= 0.
EQ3 : is the case for Ic (t) = 0 for every t ∈ N (see Table 3). This equilibrium can be
achieved if βca = 0 because in any other case (assuming Sc (0) > 0) exists time t such
c (t)
that dIdt
> 0 and therefore Ic (t + 1) 6= 0.
EQ4 : is the case for ∃t such that Ic (t) 6= 0 and Ia (t) 6= 0 (see Table 3). This
equilibrium is the generic case for the model.
According to Lemma 1, EQ2 , EQ3 , and EQ4 are not possible asymptotic forms of
the system and are therefore not stable.

adults are at work.
We assume the transition from home to either work or school and back is immediate and
that everybody is following the same clock. Each simulation step simulates one hour.
The population size is constant during the simulation and initialized in the beginning of
each iteration by setting children population size Nc and adult population size Na . In
each simulation step, the following three actions take place:
1. If a member is in the susceptible group and meets other members of the infected
group there is a change of βaa , βac , βca , or βcc according to the age-class of the
two members that the first will be infected.
2. Each infected child or adult that was infected for
either recovered or deceased, respectively.

Fig 6. Average of 10 iteration of numerical simulation of the hybrid model
where the parameter values are taken from Table. 1. Children and adult graphs
are presented with a dotted and solid lines, respectively. Susceptible, infected, recovered,
and dead are shown in green, red, blue, and black, respectively.
Fig 6 shows the population group sizes of Sc (t), Sa (t), Ic (t), Ia (t), Rc (t), Ra (t),
Dc (t), and Da (t) as an average of 10 iterations of the hybrid model. The x-axis is the
time (in days) that has passed from the beginning of the epidemic and the y-axis is the
normalized size of each population, respectively. The parameters used in the simulations
are tdc = tda = 12, φac = φaa = φcc = 1, N = 1000, Nc = 280, Na = 720.
A maximum in the percent of infected children and adults (38.5%, 100%) is reached
on the 9th and 12th day, as shown in Fig 6. In addition, all children were infected and
recovered after 12 days while all adults recovered after 28 days. The simulation shows
similar results to the results derived by solving the model (Eqs (9-10)) as presented in
Fig 3. The main difference between the two is that the simulation predicts 4.43 times
shorter duration from the time of maximum infected adults to the time that all adults
are either dead or recovered, as the infected adult population equals zero on the 82nd
and 28th days. In addition, the maximum of infected adults is reached on the 11th and
12th days resulting in 71 and 16 days for full recovery.

The proposed hybrid model provide an in-silico environment allowing relatively fast,
cheap, and accurate analysis of different policies on the COVID-19 spread dynamics.
One of the major hopes of politicians is for a NPI policy in which the epidemic does
not reach an outbreak at any time after they initialized a given decision. We define this

Duration of working and schooling day

We will assume that children meet only children in school and adults meet only adults at
work and at home adults and children meet each other. This is a good approximation of
the real dynamics as a relatively small percent of adults work with children during the
day which keeps the interactions between children and adults at this time relatively small
to the extent of interaction when both adults and children are at home and therefore
can be neglected.
Based on the proposed spatial model, we change the number of hours children and
adults spend in school and work each day, respectively. Fig 7a shows the average R0 as
a function of the duration in hours of the working (dW ) and schooling (dS ) day. The
dots are the calculated values from the simulator and the surface is a fitting function
R0 (dW , dS ). The fitting function is calculated using the least mean square (LMS)
method [33]. In order to use the LMS method, one needs to define the family function

and was obtained with a coefficient of determination R = 0.815. Similarly, Fig 7c shows
the average maxt (Ic (t) + Ia (t)) as a function of the duration in hours of the working
(dW ) and schooling (dS ) day. The dots in Fig 7c are the calculated values from the
spatial model and the surface is the fitting function
Imax (dW , dS ) = 82.419 + 0.005dW − 0.505dS − 0.023dW dS + 0.001d2W + 0.019d2S

obtained with a coefficient of determination R2 = 0.748.
The duration of either working or schooling day has a local minimum at (dW , dS ) =
(18, 14) with R0 = 0.808, as shown in Fig 7a. The optimal point from Eq (17) is
(dW , dS ) = (9, 17.5) with R0 = 0.967 obtained by setting the gradient of R0 (dW , dS )
to zero. The inconsistency in the values is resulted by the error in the fitting function
but both show the same behavior in which longer working hours reduce significantly
the infection rate but too many hours increase the infection rate back as the lack of
circulation of contagious adults and children during the day helps to reduce the infection
rate. Furthermore, Fig 7b presents a binary classification where red cells are cases
with an outbreak and green cells are cases without outbreak during the simulation as a
function of the working (dW ) and schooling (dS ) duration in hours each day.

On the other hand, the duration of either working or schooling day has an effect of
10% (as the maximal value is 82.5 while the minimal is 72.5) on the maximal infected
percent of individuals from the population as shown in Fig 7c and by setting the limits
dW = {0, 24}, dS = {0, 24} in Eq (18). There is a sharp decline between a shorter
working-schooling duration of 10 hours or less and longer than that. This is associated
with the fact that with more than 12 hours (half-day) the dynamics that have a higher
incidence are the ones with βca = βac = 0 which reduces the number of infected
individuals in total.

Partial or full lockdown of several locations or entire countries were broadly used at
the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak as a policy to reduce the number of infected
individuals and control the spread dynamics. The lockdown policy yields social distance
which reduces the ratio of infection. On the other hand, this policy negatively affects the
economy and mental health, and increases the presence of other diseases (both physical

portion of the population to be locked down such that the epidemic will be constrained
is important.
The optimization problem can be written formally as

where La and Lc are the portion of adults and children in lockdown. We ran the spatial

Each dot represents R0 of each case La , Lc . The black grid shows the threshold R0 = 1.
The behavior of R0 as a function of La , Lc has been retrieved using the LMS method
and takes the form

claim that function R0 (a, c) is well fitting the data despite the stochastic noise of the
simulation and presents a fair approximation for the R0 behavior as a function of La , Lc .
Using Eq (19) it is possible to find the constraints of La , Lc such that R0 ≤ 1, by solving
R0 (La , Lc ) ≤ 1.
Closing only schools without any reduction in adults going to work does not prevent
an epidemic outbreak while locking down half of the adult population will prevent an
outbreak. Lockdown of children (Lc ) have a minor effect relatively to lockdown adults
(La ) as shown in both Eq (19) and Fig 8b. In addition, the same phenomena repeat in
the max infected individuals as shown in Fig 8c. The surface calculated using the LMS

Validation of the hybrid model on the dynamics of the COVID-19
pandemic in Israel
In Israel, in February 21 the first COVID-19 infected individual was detected. On March
25 a national quarantine was implemented that continued for two months with local
relief and restriction on several occasions and in several cities. Fig 10 presents the daily
new confirmed cases from August 15 to September 28, respectively. Where the blue
(solid) line marks the date when the schools returned to almost full capacity. The green
(solid-dotted) lines are linear regression for before and after school opening, respectively.
It is easy to see a significant increment in the number of new daily cases.
From [4] there was 90232 infected at August 15. Given that the average recover rate
of children is 2 days and adults is 14 days (see Table 1) and that children is 28% of
the population, we obtain that there was approximately 18899 infected adults and 868
infected children. We assume that the amount of recovered individuals is heterogeneous
in the population and that only adults die from the epidemic until this point. Eq (23)
shows the initial conditions for August 15 (t0 ), Israel.
Sc (t0 ) = 2219418, Ic (t0 ) = 868, Rc (t0 ) = 19, 714, Dc (t0 ) = 0,
Sa (t0 ) = 5686182, Ia (t0 ) = 18899, Ra (t0 ) = 54196, Da (t0 ) = 723.

case when the schools are closed. If schools are open, children go to school three times a
week, every other day and do not go on weekends for five hours. If schools are closed,
children stayed at home all the time. In both cases, we assume that adults will work
eight hours each day, except on weekends when they stay home. The obtained values of
R0 for both cases are shown in Fig 11 with mean square error (MSE) of 0.205.
Considering that, longer school day is reducing the infection rate (Fig 7a), we solve
numerically the hybrid model and calculate R0 for the case when the schools are open
(from September 1). We assume that children go to school every day (except weekends)
for nine hours while the adults go to work for the same period. We obtain that the
difference average R0 of the case with the optimal NPI (R0 = 1.45) and the historical
NPI (R0 = 2.28) is ∆R0 = 0.83 (see Fig 11).

This study presents a model showing the effects of population age, time of day, and
gathering location on the spread of the epidemic. Based on the proposed model Eqs (910), the non-trivial equilibria of the system is presented in Table 3. Based on Lemma 1,
the equilibria do not take the form of the asymptotic case (Eq (11)) of the model and
therefore are not stable. Although the proposed model is a simplification of the total
complexity of the COVID-19 epidemic, the asymptotic solution without any intervention
will result in a high percentage 39% children, 89% adults and 38.5% children, 100%
adults of infected individuals as shown in Figs 3 and 6, respectively.
In addition, the asymptotic solutions of the model are insignificant for themselves as

in practice these results occur after A days (13 years). The main epidemic dynamics as
obtained from both the SIRD model Eqs (9-10) and the hybrid model is a few month
long, as shown in Figs 3 and 6. Besides, the asymptotic solution can be used to easily
obtain Da and Dc as they accumulative sums of infected infected adults and children
multiplied by a factor ψa and ψc and do not change after the epidemic is over. As a
result, α = 2.1 · 10−4 is not used as for 82 days (as shown in Fig 3) only 0.017% of the
children will become adults which effectually has only a minor affect on the epidemic
results.
We presented the proposed model as a stochastic process using the Markov chain
modeling approach as shown in Lemma 1. Using this representation, it is easy to find
the stationary state of the chain (Eq (11)) and therefore the possible asymptotic forms
of the SIRD model Eqs (9-10).
Furthermore, two policies for controlling the epidemic and preventing outbreak have
been investigated using the hybrid model. First, the duration of working and schooling
day has an influence (up to 10%) on the maximum of infected individuals but can prevent
outbreaks under the assumption that during this time adults do not contact children at
all as shown in Fig 7. These results match the conclusions reported by Keskinocak et
al. (2020) for Georgia state [35]. In addition, these results match the results reported
by Di Domenico [16] that school closure has a minor influence on the epidemic peak,
just delays it. Second, a partial lockdown of adults and children show that adults and
children lockdown has a similar first-order effect (linear coefficients of La and Lc ) but
the combination between the two (La Lc ) has a bigger weight on the average infection
rate as shown in Eqs (19) and (21). These results match the conclusions reported by
Aglar et al. (2020) for the state of Georgia regarding the voluntary lockdown with
school closure [36]. By the same token, a lockdown of approximately half of the adult
population prevents an outbreak where children lockdown has a less significant influence
as shown in Figs 8 and 9. These results are based on values from Table 1, which can vary
significantly between countries and depend on other hyperparameters such as population
density, age distribution of the population and others.
The model explains the dynamics that took place between August 15 and September
15 (2020) in Israel as presented in Fig 11 with mean square error (MSE) of 0.205. The
opening of the schools is equal to reducing the lockdown for children with some relaxation
(smaller La ) of the lockdown for adults (because if the children in school they can go to
work) with less then half (50%) of the adult population voluntary in lockdown. Also,
the schooling hours were reduced to less than 6 hours each day. From Figs 7a and 8c
it is easy to see that this policy predicts high increase in the infection rate, as indeed
happened. Keeping the schools open while keeping the increase in the infection rate
from increasing significantly is possible if the schooling hours are longer (8-9 hours) as
shown in Fig 7a. The influence of this policy in Israel during the school opening which
take place in September 1 show that the R0 can be reduced by 0.83 in comparison to
a policy in which children go to school every other day for five hours, as shown in Fig
11. Also, if at least half of the adult population will be in lockdown the influence of the
schools on the infection rate will be relatively small as shown in Fig 8b.
In the case of a future pandemic virus, researchers will be able to use our approach
to predict the exact consequences of choosing ”Lockdown” strategies, especially those
needed for pandemics with a lack of immunity in the world’s population. Understanding
the age-based dynamics in COVID-19 spread in the population will be crucial for the
development of an optimal NPI policy, as well as for optimizing current polices and
analyzing clinical data. The further extensions of the model will be used to learn how to
manage international travel between countries with a range of healthcare system abilities
in both the context of the COVID-19 epidemic and for other epidemics scenarios.
