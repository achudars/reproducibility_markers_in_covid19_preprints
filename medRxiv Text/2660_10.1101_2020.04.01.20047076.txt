Highlights
• 1.6 million molecular diagnostic tests identified 1,388 SARS-CoV-2 infections in Guangdong
Province, China, by 19th March 2020
• Virus genomes can be recovered using a variety of sequencing approaches from a range of
patient samples.
• Genomic analyses reveal multiple virus importations into Guangdong Province, resulting in
genetically distinct clusters that require careful interpretation.
• Large-scale epidemiological surveillance and intervention measures were effective in
interrupting community transmission in Guangdong
Summary
COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and was first reported in central China in
December 2019. Extensive molecular surveillance in Guangdong, China’s most populous province,
during early 2020 resulted in 1,388 reported RNA positive cases from 1.6 million tests. In order to
understand the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in China we generated
53 genomes from infected individuals in Guangdong using a combination of metagenomic sequencing
and tiling amplicon approaches. Combined epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses indicate
multiple independent introductions to Guangdong, although phylogenetic clustering is uncertain due
to low virus genetic variation early in the pandemic. Our results illustrate how the timing, size and
duration of putative local transmission chains were constrained by national travel restrictions and by
the province’s large-scale intensive surveillance and intervention measures. Despite these successes,
COVID-19 surveillance in Guangdong is still required as the number of cases imported from other
countries is increasing.

A new virus-associated disease, COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), was initially reported in
China on 30th December 2019 (Wu et al., 2020). The causative agent of COVID-19 is the novel
human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020), and as of 24th March 2020,
there have been 372,757 confirmed infections and 16,231 deaths reported worldwide (WHO, 2020).
In China, the COVID-19 epidemic grew exponentially during January 2020, peaking on 12th February
2020 with 15,153 newly confirmed cases per day. One month later, reported COVID-19 cases in
China dropped to approximately 20 per day, suggesting the epidemic there was contained. However,
since the second half of February 2020, the number of cases reported outside of China has risen
exponentially. By 11th March 2020, the day that WHO announced COVID-19 as a new pandemic,
37,371 cases had been reported outside of China (WHO, 2020).
Guangdong Province and the Pearl River Delta Metropolitan Region contain some of the world’s
largest and most densely populated urban areas. Guangdong is the most populous province of China
(113m people) and contains many large cities including Guangzhou (12m), Shenzhen (10m),
Dongguan (8m) and Foshan (7m). The province has strong transportation links to Hubei Province,
where the first cases of COVID-19 were reported. The Wuhan–Guangzhou high-speed railway has
been estimated to transfer 0.1–0.2 million passengers per day during the spring festival period, which
started on 10th January 2020. By 19th March 2020, Guangdong had 1,388 confirmed cases of COVID19, the highest in China outside of Hubei Province.
Understanding the evolution and transmission patterns of a virus after it enters a new population is
crucial for designing effective strategies for disease control and prevention (Grubaugh et al., 2017;
Ladner et al., 2019). In this study, we combine genetic and epidemiological data to investigate the
genetic diversity, evolution, and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong Province. We
generated virus genome sequences from 53 patients in Guangdong and sought to investigate the
timing and relative contributions of imported cases versus local transmission, the nature of
genetically-distinct of transmission chains within Guangdong, and how the emergency response in
Guangdong was reflected in the reduction and elimination of these transmission chains. Our data may
provide valuable information for implementing and interpreting genomic surveillance of COVID-19
in other regions.
Enhanced surveillance was launched in all clinics in Guangdong province following the first reports
of patients with undiagnosed pneumonia on 30th December 2019. Initially, screening and sampling for
SARS-CoV-2 was targeted towards patients with fever and respiratory symptoms and who had a
history of travel in the 14 days before the date of symptom onset. The first detected case had symptom
onset on 1st January and was reported on 19th January 2020 (Kang et al. 2020). COVID-19 cases in
Guangdong grew until early February 2020 (peaking at >100 cases per day) and declined thereafter
(Figure 1A). After 22nd February 2020, the daily number of locally-infected reported cases in

Guangdong did not exceed one. However, since the beginning of March 2020, COVID-19 cases
imported to Guangdong from abroad have been detected with increasing frequency. As of 26th March
2020, a total of 102 imported cases were reported from 19 different countries (Figure 1A),
highlighting the risk that local COVID-19 transmission could reignite in China.
Different surveillance strategies were applied during the epidemic in Guangdong (Figure 1A). More
intense surveillance was initiated on 30th January 2020 in response to the Spring Festival period,
which results in greater mobility among regions and provinces in China (Kraemer, 2020) and because
asymptomatic COVID-19 cases had been reported (Guan et al., 2020). This included monitoring (i)
all travelers returning from Hubei or other regions with high epidemic activity, (ii) their close
contacts, and (iii) all hospitalized patients in clinics, including those without fever or respiratory
symptoms, regardless of their exposure history. Approximately 1.35 million samples were screened
by six third-party institutions between 30th January and 15th March 2020. Surveillance commenced at
Guangdong airports in early March, following the growth of COVID-19 outbreaks outside of China.
In total, approximately 1.6 million tests were performed by 19th March, identifying 1,388 SARS-CoV2 positive cases in 20 of 21 prefectures in Guangdong Province (Figure 1B). Around a quarter of
cases (336) were judged to be linked to local transmission and two-thirds (1014) had a likely exposure
history in Hubei (see Methods). For locally-infected cases, 181 (53%) were linked to transmissions
among household members. More than half of reported cases (60%) were from the cities of Shenzhen
and Guangzhou (Figure 1B). We note that the number of detected cases will be less than the true
number of infections, although the degree of under-reporting is unknown. Surveillance was targeted
towards travellers, hence these data may overestimate the proportion of travel-associated cases.
To understand the genetic structure of the COVID-19 outbreak in Guangdong, we generated nearcomplete and partial genomes from 53 COVID-19 patients in Guangdong Province. The genomes
were generated by a combination of metagenomic sequencing and multiplex PCR amplification
followed by nanopore sequencing on a MinION device (see Methods). Sequence sampling dates
ranged from 30th January to 28th February 2020 (Figure S1).

Figure 1: Summary of the COVID-19 epidemic in Guangdong Province, China. (A) Time series of the 1,388
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Guangdong until 19th March, by date of onset of illness. Cases are
classified according to their likely exposure histories (see inset and main text). The dashed lines indicate the
date the first Guangdong case was detected (19th January) and the shutdown of travel from Wuhan (23rd
January). An overview of testing and surveillance strategies at different stages of the epidemic are illustrated
below the time series, on the same timescale. (B) Geographic distribution of COVID-19 cases and human
population density among the 21 prefecture-level divisions of Guangdong Province.

Sequencing was performed on 79 clinical samples (throat swabs, n=32, anal swabs n=24,
nasopharyngeal swabs n=10, sputum n=13) collected from 65 patients with varying disease
symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic to very severe (see methods). RT-PCR Ct (cycle threshold)
values of these samples ranged from 19 to 40.86. Figure 2A displays the Ct values for the 53 samples
with >50% genome coverage for which we report whole and partial genome sequences (see Figure S2
for details of all 79 samples). When Ct values are <30, sequence reads covered approximately 90% or
more of the reference genome (GenBank accession number: MN908947.3) irrespective of the
amplification and sequencing approach used (see Methods). However, genome coverage declined for
samples with Ct >30 (Figure S2). Using a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test we found an association
between sample Ct values and sample type (Figure 2B; p<0.001), and sample Ct values and disease
severity (Figure 2C; p=0.03; see also Liu et al. 2020).
Sequences generated with nanopore sequencing indicate common regions of low coverage (Figure
2D). The version 1 primer set used here was not able to amplify some regions with high frequency of
changes from the reference genome MN908947.3. After completion of this study, the primers have
been redesigned to improve coverage (Quick 2020). Shared and unique single nucleotide variants
(SNVs) were observed at 97 sites across the virus genomes (Figure 2D, 2E), with 77 SNVs present in
only one genome. Three SNVs were present in >10 genomes: (C8782T, C21711T and T28144C).
When compared to 49 previously released genomes from Hubei and Guangdong, 118 SNVs are
present in only one genome and the same three SNVs are still the only SNVs shared between more
than 10 genomes (Figure S3).

To understand the genetic diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Guangdong we performed
phylogenetic analyses using maximum likelihood and Bayesian molecular clock approaches. We
added our new virus genomes from Guangdong to 177 publicly-available sequences, which includes
73 sequences from China, 17 of which are previously-reported Guangdong genomes. The final
alignment comprised 250 sequences and increased the number of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from China
by ~60% when our data was submitted to GISAID (on 9th March).
The estimated maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny is shown in Figure 3A. The SARS-CoV-2
sequences from Guangdong (red) are interspersed with viral lineages sampled from other Chinese
provinces and other countries (black). This pattern agrees with the time series in Figure 1A, indicating

that most detected cases were linked to travel rather than local community transmission. Despite this,
there were a number of instances where sequences from Guangdong appeared to cluster together,
sometimes with sequences sampled from other regions. To explore these lineages in more detail, we
performed a Bayesian molecular clock analysis that places the phylogenetic history of the genomes on
an estimated timescale. A summary visualisation of the maximum clade credibility tree from that
analysis is shown in Figure 3B and is largely congruent with the ML tree. The current low genetic
diversity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes worldwide means that most internal nodes have very low
posterior probabilities; we caution that no conclusions should be drawn from these branching events
as they will be informed by the phylogenetic prior distribution rather than variable nucleotide sites
(Figure 3A). Nevertheless, five clusters (denoted A-E) containing Guangdong sequences had posterior
probability support of >80% (i.e. their sequences grouped monophyletically in over 80% of trees in
the posterior sample; Figure 3B). These clusters are also observed in ML phylogeny (Figure 3A).
Some included only sequences sampled in Guangdong (A, B), others included sequences sampled in
other countries and provinces (C, D, E).

locations within Guangdong are shown next to the sequence identifier. A phylogenetic bootstrap analysis was
not performed due to the low number of phylogenetically informative sites and the number of missing bases (N)
in the alignment. (B) Visualisation of the corresponding time-scaled maximum clade credibility tree. Sequences
from Guangdong are in red and those from other locations in grey. The clusters (A-E) discussed in main text

their range of divergence dates are illustrated as shaded grey expanses.

From the molecular clock analysis, we were able to estimate the times of the most recent common
ancestor (tMRCA) of clusteres A-E. We find that SARS-CoV-2 lineages were imported multiple

times into Guangdong during the second half of January 2020 (Figure 4). Three clusters (C, D, E)
have earlier tMRCAs that coincide with the start of the Guangdong epidemic and two (A, B) have
later tMRCAs, around the time of the epidemic peak in the province (Figure 4). The average time
between the tMRCA and the earliest sequence collection date in each cluster was approximately 10.5
days. The observed duration of each phylogenetic cluster (tMRCA to most recently sampled
sequence) ranged from 13.8 (cluster B) to 45.5 (cluster D) days. The clusters with earlier tMRCAs
contain more sequences sampled from travellers outside of China, possibly reflecting a decrease in air
passenger travel from Guangdong after January 2020 (Flightradar 2020). The median tMRCA
estimate of the COVID-19 pandemic was 29th November 2019 (95% HPD 14th November to 13th
December 2019), consistent with previous analyses (Rambaut 2020) (Figure 4).
The apparent clusters of Guangdong sequences require careful interpretation, because of the relative
undersampling of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from other Chinese provinces, including Hubei.
Specifically, it is known that undersampling of regions with high incidence can lead to phylogenetic
analyses underestimating the number of introductions into recipient locations, and overestimating the
size and duration of transmission chains in those recipient locations (Grubaugh et al., 2017; Kraemer
et al., 2018). For example, the largest Guangdong phylogenetic cluster comprises 8 sequences
(denoted A in Figure 3,4), none of which are placed at the root of the cluster, and it is tempting to
conclude that the whole cluster derived from community transmission within Guangdong. However, 6
of the 8 genomes in this cluster reported travel from Hubei and therefore the cluster in fact represents
multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions into Guangdong, with dates of symptom onset around or shortly
after the shutdown of travel from Wuhan (Figure 4).

shading and horizontal red lines indicate the sampling period over which genomes in each cluster were
collected. Dots indicate the collection dates of genomes, coloured by sampling location (red = Guangdong, grey

Our analyses of the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong province indicate that,
following the first COVID-19 case detected in early January, most infections were the result of virus
importation from elsewhere, and that chains of local transmission were limited in size and duration.
This suggests that the large-scale surveillance and intervention measures implemented in Guangdong
were effective in interrupting community transmission in a densely populated urban region, ultimately
containing the epidemic and limiting the potential for dissemination to other regions. However,
vigilance is still required as the risk remains that SARS-CoV-2 transmission will reignite in
Guangdong, following a recent increase in the number of COVID-19 cases imported to China from
other countries.
The results also suggest that early phylogenetic analyses of the pandemic should be interpreted
carefully. The number of mutations that define phylogenetic lineages are small (often one), and may
be similar to the number of sequence differences arising from errors introduced during reverse
transcription, PCR amplification, or sequencing. Bayesian estimates of divergence times (Rannala and
Yang, 1996), such as the tMRCA of the pandemic, are based on aggregate numbers of mutations and
are expected to be more robust. Further, the low and variable sampling of COVID-19 cases among
different regions makes it challenging to evaluate phylogenetic clusters that comprise cases from a
single region; although such clusters could indeed represent local transmission, our results show they
can also include multiple introductions from a genomically-undersampled location. Therefore, as with
all phylogenetic analyses, the SARS-CoV-2 genomes must be interpreted in the context of all
available epidemiological information.

Methods
Ethics
This study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention of Guangdong Province. Written consent was obtained from patients or their guardian(s)
when samples were collected. Patients were informed about the surveillance before providing written
consent, and data directly related to disease control were collected and anonymized for analysis.
Sample collection, clinical surveillance and epidemiological data
After reports of hospitalized cases with undiagnosed, severe pneumonia on December 30th 2019,
enhanced surveillance was initiated in Guangdong Province to detect suspected infections, especially
among cases with recent travel history to Hubei or other epidemic regions over the last 14 days.
Suspected COVID-19 cases were screened by 31 designated hospitals, local CDCs in 21 prefecture
cities, and 6 third-party detection institutions with commercial real-time reverse transcription PCR
(RT-PCR) kits (China CDC, 2020). Further details of surveillance and case reporting are provided in
Supplementary Text 1. A subset of positive samples was sent to Guangdong Provincial CDC for
verification and further sequencing. All patients or their guardian(s) were informed about the
molecular surveillance prior to providing written consent. Imported infections were defined when
confirmed cases had travel history from Hubei or other epidemic regions and did not have close
contact with local positive cases in 14 days preceding illness onset. The severity of the disease was
classified into mild, moderate, severe, or critical type based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme
of SARS-CoV-2 released by the National Health Commission of China. Further details of clinical
case definitions are provided in Supplementary Text 2. Demographic information, date of illness
onset, and clinical outcomes of sequenced cases were collected from medical records. The exposure
history for each case was obtained through an interview. Information regarding the demographic and
geographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 cases can be found at the website of Health Commission of
Guangdong Province (http://wsjkw.gd.gov.cn/xxgzbdfk/yqtb/).
Virus amplification and sequencing
Virus genomes were generated by two different approaches, (i) untargeted metagenomic sequencing
on the BGI MGISEQ-2000 (n=63) and Illumina NextSeq (n=4) sequencing platforms, and (ii) using
version 1 of the ARTIC COVID-19 multiplex PCR primers (https://artic.network/ncov-2019),
followed by nanopore sequencing on an ONT MinION (n=45). We report only those genomes for
which we were able to generate >50% genome coverage, and only report one genome per patient.
For metatranscriptomics, total RNAs were extracted from different types of samples by using
QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat. No. 52904), followed by DNase treatment and
purification with TURBO DNase (Invitrogen, Cat. No. AM2239) and Agencourt RNAClean XP
beads (Beckman Cat. No. A63987). Both the concentration and the quality of all isolated RNA

samples were measured and checked with the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and Qubit. Libraries were
prepared using the SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v2 (Clontech, Cat. No. 634412) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol starting with 10 ng total RNA. Briefly, purified RNA was firstly
fragmented and converted to cDNA using reverse transcriptase. The ribosome cDNA was depleted by
using ZapRv2 (mammalian-specific). The remaining cDNA was converted to double stranded DNA
and subjected to end-repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation. The constructed libraries were amplified
using 9-16 PCR cycles. Sequencing of metatranscriptome libraries was conducted using Illumina
NextSeq 550 SE 75 or BGI MGISEQ-2000 PE100 platforms.
For the multiplex PCR approach, we followed the general method of multiplex PCR as described in
(https://artic.network/ncov-2019) (Quick et al., 2017). Briefly, the multiplex PCR was performed with
two pooled primer mixture and the cDNA reverse transcribed with random primers was used as a
template. After 35 rounds of amplification, the PCR products were collected and quantified, followed
with end-repairing and barcoding ligation. Around 50 fmol of final library DNA was loaded onto the
MinION. The nanopore sequencing platform takes less than 24 hours to obtain 10Gb of sequencing
data, achieving between 0.3–0.6 million reads per sample. The ARTIC bioinformatics pipeline for
COVID (https://artic.network/ncov-2019) was used to generate consensus sequences and call single
nucleotide variants relative to the reference sequence.
To test the precision and threshold of the multiplex PCR and nanopore sequencing method, we
undertook a serial dilution experiment. Viral RNA was extracted from a cell strain of SARS-CoV-2.
To mimic clinical samples with different viral loads, we diluted this viral RNA with SARS-CoV-2
negative RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Viral loads were estimated using RTPCR with serial diluted plasmid as a standard. At each dilution level we performed multiplex PCR
and nanopore sequencing and assembly as per the approach above, except that reads were assembled
against the consensus genome obtained from the original sample using metagenomic sequencing. As
expected, relative virus load, % genome coverage and average read depth decreased at higher
dilutions. Genome coverage exceeded 75% for all except the final dilution (Table S3).
Virus genome assembly
Reference-based assembly of the metagenomic raw data was performed as follows. Illumina adaptors
were removed, and reads were filtered for quality (q30 threshold and read length >15nt) using
Cutadapt 1.18 (Martin, 2011). The mapping of cleaned reads was performed against GenBank
reference strain MN908947.3 using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). Consensus sequences
were generated using samtools 1.2 (Li et al., 2009). Sites were called at depth>=3 if they matched the
reference strain, or depth>=5 if they differed from the reference, otherwise sites were denoted N.
Ambiguity nucleotide codes were used if (i) the minor variant is observed at >30% frequency and (ii)
the minor variant is represented by 5 or more reads. Assembly of the nanopore raw data was

performed using the ARTIC bioinformatic pipeline for COVID-19 with minimap2 (Li, 2018) and
medaka (https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka) for consensus sequence generation. For patient
samples that were sequenced using both metagenomics and nanopore sequencing, we retained only
the sequence with the highest genome coverage.
Phylogenetic analysis
All available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (n=323) on GISAID (gisaid.org) on 13th March 2020 were
downloaded. Sequences from GISAID that were error-rich, those which represented multiple
sequences from the same patient, and those without a date of sampling were removed. Finally, the
dataset was reduced by only retaining the earliest and most recently sampled sequences from
epidemiologically linked outbreaks (e.g. the Diamond Princess cruise ship). The resulting dataset of
250 sequences therefore represents the global diversity of the virus while minimizing the impact of
sampling bias. Sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7.4 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and manually
inspected in Geneious v11.0.3 (https://www.geneious.com). The final alignment length was 29,923
nucleotides.
We used both the maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian coalescent methods to explore the
phylogenetic structure of SARS-CoV-2. The ML phylogeny was estimated with PhyML (Guindon et
al., 2010) using the HKY+Ⲅ4 substitution model (Hasegawa et al., 1985) with gamma-distributed rate
variation (Yang, 1994). Linear regression of root-to-tip genetic distance against sampling date
indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 sequences evolve in clock-like manner (r = 0.539) (Figure S4). The
Bayesian coalescent tree analysis was undertaken in the BEAST (Ayres et al., 2012; Suchard et al.,
2018) framework, also using the HKY+Ⲅ4 substitution model with gamma-distributed rate variation
with an exponential population growth tree prior and a strict molecular clock. Taxon sets were defined
and used to estimate the posterior probability of monophyly and the posterior distribution of the
tMRCA of observed phylogenetic clusters A-E (Supplementary Table 1). Four independent chains
were run for 100 million states and parameters and trees were sampled every 10,000 states. Upon
completion, chains were combined using LogCombiner after removing 10% of states as burn-in and
convergence was assessed with Tracer (Rambaut et al., 2018). The maximum clade credibility (MCC)
tree was inferred from the Bayesian posterior tree distribution using TreeAnnotator, and visualised
with figtreejs-react (https://github.com/jtmccr1/figtreejs-react@9874a5b). Code for Figure 3B is
available at https://github.com/jtmccr1/tree-for-oli and a live version of the tree can be found at
https://jtmccr1.github.io/tree-for-oli/. Monophyly and tMRCA (times to the most recent common
ancestor) statistics were calculated for each taxon set from the posterior tree distribution.
