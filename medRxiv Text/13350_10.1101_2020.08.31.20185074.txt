Abstract
The Hologic Panther Fusion (PF) platform provides fully automated CE marked diagnostics
for respiratory viruses, including recently SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by a
transcription mediated amplification (TMA) assay, but not for the endemic human
coronaviruses (hCoV). Therefore, a laboratory developed test (LDT) comprising a
multiplexed RT-PCR protocol that detects and differentiates the four hCoV NL63, 229E,
HKU1 and OC43 was adapted on the PF.
The novel CE marked Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA and the LDT for hCoV were validated
with 321 diagnostic specimens from the upper and lower respiratory tract in comparison to
two SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCRs (PF E-gene RT-PCR and genesig RT-PCR, 157 specimens) or
the R-GENE hCoV / hParaFlu RT-PCR (164 specimens), respectively.
For the endemic hCoV, results were 96.3 % concordant with two specimens discordantly
positive in the PF and four specimens discordantly positive in the R-GENE assay. All
discordantly positive samples had Ct values between 33 and 39. The PF hCoV LDT identified
23 hCoV positive specimens as NL63, 15 as 229E, 15 as HKU1 and 25 as OC43. The Aptima
SARS-CoV-2 TMA gave 99.4 % concordant results compared to the consensus results with a
single specimen discordantly positive. Moreover, 36 samples from proficiency testing panels
were detected and typed correctly by both novel methods.
In conclusion, the SARS-CoV-2 TMA and the LDT for hCoV enhanced the diagnostic
spectrum of the PF for all coronaviruses circulating globally for a multitude of diagnostic
materials from the upper and lower respiratory tract.

Introduction
Human coronaviruses are a common cause for acute respiratory infections of the upper
respiratory tract 1-3, though occasionally infections of the lower respiratory tract have been
described. Especially children, elderly and chronically ill patients are at risk of a more severe
and potentially lethal progress of disease 4-7. Four different human coronavirusspecies (hCoV
229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1) are circulating in the human population worldwide. HCoV
229E and OC43 have been known since the 1960s 8,9. More than three decades later, in 2004,
NL63 10 and in 2005 HKU1 11 were identified. In addition to these hCoVs three zoonotic
coronaviruses were discovered: SARS-CoV (causing an outbreak in 2003), MERS-CoV
(discovered in 2013 and circulating almost exclusively on the Arabian Peninsula) and SARSCoV-2 (a novel Sarbecovirus currently pandemic and probably endemic in future). These
cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in humans more frequently 12,13. However,
many SARS-CoV-2 infections can be asymptomatic or only associated with mild symptoms
especially in children and young adults 14-16. Moreover, high virus loads were found in
presymptomatic patients, which might play a crucial role in virus transmission 17.
In acute respiratory infections, the rapid diagnosis of a viral etiology is essential for reducing
the amount of prescribed antibiotics and for infection control measures. The introduction of
nucleic acid amplification technologies (NAT) such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) has been a milestone in the diagnosis of
respiratory virus infections in comparison to virus culture and direct fluorescent-antibody
assays improving sensitivity. Therefore, NAT is now the gold standard of coronavirus
diagnostics 18,19. However, respiratory samples were processed in batches usually once every
working day for conventional coronavirus PCR diagnostics, thus resulting in long sample to
answer times. More recently, fully automatic NAT platforms were developed which process
each diagnostic sample individually ("random access") and thus reduce sample-to-answer

time significantly. For example, coronavirus detection can be performed by highly
multiplexed, random access PCR platforms 20-22 but these cannot be adapted to the individual
diagnostics needs of a patient considering his symptoms and the epidemiology of circulating
respiratory viruses. For comparison, the Hologic Panther Fusion (PF) is a random access
platform that provides a panel of three CE marked and FDA cleared multiplex real-time PCRs
that cover influenza virus A/B (Flu A/B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza
virus 1-4 (ParaFlu), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), adenovirus (AdV) and rhinovirus
(RhV) and can be performed according to the individual diagnostic request. These assays
were validated for samples from the lower respiratory tract in a previous study 23.
Recently, a TMA based assay for SARS-CoV-2 became available for the Panther (Aptima
SARS-CoV-2 assay) 24 which is CE marked and FDA cleared for emergency use (EUA) for
samples from the upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal swabs, washes and aspirates; nasal
swabs and aspirates, oropharyngeal swabs). In addition, an early laboratory developed real
time PCR for the SARS-CoV E-gene 25 and a FDA EUA cleared RT-PCR for the SARSCoV-2 Orf1ab which is only available in the U.S. 26, can be applied on the PF platform.
However, the endemic human coronaviruses were not yet covered. As these are responsible
for about 13-19.7 % of the respiratory infections 2,27, we used the PF Open Access tool to
establish and validate a multiplexed laboratory developed test (LDT) that detects and
differentiates the four endemic hCoVs 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1.

Material and Methods
Proficiency testing panels
36 proficiency testing specimens provided by Instand (Düsseldorf, Germany) in the years
2017-2020 (sample numbers 340029 – 340050 and 340052 - 340065) were tested with the
novel LDT for endemic hCoV NL63, 229E, HKU1, OC43 and the Aptima SARS-CoV-2
assay.
Panels of diagnostic specimens
In total, 321 patient samples from the upper (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) were
included in the panel.
164 patient samples (91 bronchial alveolar lavages (BAL), 41 nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS),
20 pharyngeal lavages (PL), 6 bronchial lavages (BL), 4 tracheal secretions (TS), 2 nasal
swabs (NS)) with a diagnostic request for coronavirus were tested by the hCoV / hParaFlu RGENE (Biomerieux, Marcy-l'Étoile, France) as the routine diagnostic procedure and the PF
LDT. Specimens originated between 03/2017 and 02/2020.
For validation of the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA, 157 specimens (8 BAL, 125 NPS, 1 PL, 7
BL, 3 TS, 6 NS and 7 tracheal swabs (TRS)) with a diagnostic request for SARS-CoV-2 were
tested in the PF E-gene RT-PCR 25 as the routine diagnostic procedure and subsequently in
the Aptima TMA and the genesig RT-PCR (Primerdesign, Chandler's Ford, UK).
Ethical statement
All 321 diagnostic samples originated from patients who had agreed to the anonymised use of
their clinical data at hospital admission (informed consent). As specimens were tested
according to diagnostic requests only and medical data were anonymized and analyzed only

retrospectively, ethical approval is not required in Germany (confirmed by e-mails of the local
ethical committee “Ethikkommission der Medizinischen Hochschule Hannover”, 19th of
September, 2019 and 6th of May 2020).
Sample preparation
Swabs were resuspended in 1.5 ml PBS-. Liquid samples (lavages and secretions) were loaded
without prior processing of the sample. However, viscous samples were diluted 1:2 in PBS- to
avoid clotting in the pipette tip. For testing on the PF, 500 µl of the specimen (patient
specimen and proficiency testing samples) were transferred into a Specimen Lysis Tube
(SLT) that contained 710 µl Specimen Transport Media (STM). For all assays that were
performed on the PF, 360 µl of this sample were pipetted automatically for nucleic acid
extraction.
Coronavirus (NL63, 229E, HKU1 and OC43) LDT
SLTs were automatically processed on the Panther Fusion system including nucleic acid
extraction, reverse transcription and real time PCR using the Open Access RNA/DNA
enzyme cartridge, the Extraction Reagent-S, the Capture Reagent-S, the Enhancer Reagent-S,
the internal control and the primer and probe recon solution (PPR). The PPR (table 1)
contained coronavirus specific (targeting the respective N gene) as well as internal control
(IC) primers and probes, MgCl2, KCl, Tris buffer and nuclease free water (all ThermoFisher,
Waltham, MA, USA). Coronavirus specific primer and probe sequences were published
recently 28 but probes were labelled with different fluorescent dyes and quenchers
(supplementary table 1). Moreover, a second internal quencher (ZEN) was added to the 229E
specific probe and the NL63 specific probe. Stability of the PPR on the Panther Fusion was
validated for a period of 14 days (supplementary table 2).

Settings in the PF software for automatic processing were: extraction volume 360 µl and
“sample aspiration height” low. The reverse transcription was performed at 50 °C for 8:28
minutes followed by the activation of the Taq polymerase at 95 °C for 2:00 minutes. The two
step thermocycling protocol consisted of 45 cycles each with a denaturation at 95 °C for 5
seconds and the elongation and fluorescence detection at 60 °C for 22 seconds. Fluorescence
analysis settings in the PF software were set as following: The analysis start cycle was set at
10, the baseline correction was enabled and the slope limit was set at 25. As a positivity
criteria the Ct threshold in the channels 1 (FAM for 229E), 2 (HEX for NL63) and 3 (ROX
for HKU1) was set to 200 RFU, in channel 4 (Quasar 670 for OC43) to 300 RFU and in
channel 5 (Quasar 705 for IC) to 1000 RFU. The crosstalk correction was set to 1 % for the
combination of emitter channel 1 and receiver channel 2, as well as the combination of
emitter channel 5 and receiver channel 4. A result was defined as valid if at least one positive
result in channels 1-5 was detected.
HCoV/hParaFlu R-GENE RT-PCR
Nucleic acid extraction was performed from 200 µl sample on a QIAcube using the DNeasy
blood kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) which has been previously validated for this
purpose23. Of the eluate, 10 µl were tested by the hCoV / hParaFlu R-GENE assay
(bioMérieux, Marcy-l'Étoile, France) on an ABI 7500 sequence detection system (ABI, Foster
City, CA, U.S.). This assay has been validated previously for multiple types of respiratory
specimens.
Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA
SLTs were loaded on the Panther Fusion and the assay was performed automatically as
described in the package insert 24.

SARS-CoV-2 E gene RT-PCR
The SARS-CoV-2 E gene RT-PCR was performed with the Open Access tool on the Panther
Fusion as described previously 25.
Genesig SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR
Nucleic acid extraction was performed from 200 µl sample on a QIAcube using the DNeasy
blood kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Of the eluate, 10 µL were tested by the genesig
coronavirus COVID-19 Real-Time PCR assay (Primerdesign, Chandler's Ford, UK) on an
ABI 7500 sequence detection system.
Amplification efficiency and evaluation of LOD
The amplification efficiency was calculated from serial dilutions of reference samples if
available. Supernatants from cell cultures, positive for 229E, NL63 and OC43 were provided
by the national reference centre for coronaviruses at Charité, Berlin. For SARS-CoV-2, the
quantified quality control material AccuPlex SARS-CoV-2 Verification Panel (cat # 05050129 from Seracare, Milford, MA) was used. For HKU1, no cell culture supernatant was
available. Therefore, a patient sample that had been tested highly positive in the hCoV /
ParaFlu R-GENE assay was used for estimating the amplification efficiency.
For the Aptima SARS-CoV-2, the limit of detection (LOD) was determined from half
logarithmic serial dilutions.
Data analysis and statistics
The amplification efficiency was calculated with the following formula: Amplification
efficiency (E) = 10-1/m (with m being the slope of the amplification curve). For the Aptima
SARS-CoV-2 TMA assay the LOD (95% probability of detection according to 2002/364/EC)

was calculated by probit analysis from 27 replicates of a dilution series of the Accuplex
standard using the statistics program SSPS (Version 15.0). For panels of diagnostic
specimens, concordances of assays and positive percent agreement (PPA, "sensitivity") and
negative percent agreement (NPA, "specificity") of PF assays were calculated. To evaluate
the clinical performance of the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA compared to those of the two
other RT-PCRs (Panther Fusion E-gene RT-PCR and genesig COVID-19 RT-PCR), a
consensus result was defined as a concordant result in at least two of three tests.

Results
Proficiency testing panel specimens and cross-reactivity
36 proficiency testing specimens provided by Instand (Düsseldorf, Germany) were tested with
the hCoV LDT and Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA. All samples were detected correctly. From
these samples, 31 were coronavirus positive samples (10 OC43, 3 NL63 and 4 229E, 4 SARSCoV-2, 10 MERS-CoV) and 5 were negative for these coronaviruses. As anticipated, MERSCoV positive specimens were negative in the hCoV LDT and the Aptima SARS-CoV-2
TMA. Hence, cross-reactivity with MERS-CoV could be excluded. Furthermore, an
inactivated SARS-CoV positive cell culture supernatant originating from 2003 gave a
negative result in the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA.
Comparison of test performance for coronavirus NL63, 229E, HKU1 and OC43
detection
A panel of 164 archived diagnostic specimens was tested with the hCoV LDT on the Panther
Fusion and results were compared to the initial results of the hCoV / ParaFlu R-GENE assay
(table 2). Overall, the concordance of results was 96.3 %. The positive percent agreement
(PPA, "sensitivity") of the LDT on the Panther Fusion was determined as 94.9 % and the
negative percent agreement (NPA, "specificity") as 97.6 % in relation to the R-GENE assay.
Samples with discordant results had Ct values of 33, 34, 36 and 39 in the R-GENE assay and
38 (two samples) in the PF LDT. In contrast to the R-GENE assay, the PF LDT provided
differentiation of hCoV samples: 25 of 77 were identified as OC43, 23 as NL63, 15 as 229E
and 15 as HKU1. Among these, one sample was co-infected with 229E (with a Ct value of
21) and OC43 (Ct value 32).

Diagnostic performance of the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA
Of 157 samples tested, 56 were found to be consensus positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in any
two of the tree methods (table 3). Thus, the PPA of the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA and of the
PF E-gene RT-PCR were determined as 100.0 % and the NPA as 99.0 %, whereas the genesig
COVID-19 PCR had a PPA of 87.5 % and a NPA of 100 % (table 3). In the SARS-CoV-2 Egene RT-PCR the median Ct of positive samples was 34.2 (range 17.5 – 40.8) with an
interquartile range of 6.4 and in the genesig RT-PCR the median Ct was 32.7 (range 19.2 –
39.2) and the inter quartile range 6.4. Thus the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA detected multiple
faintly positive samples correctly. Moreover, 23 of 157 samples originated from the lower
respiratory tract and were all detected correctly in the Aptima in comparison to the consensus
result with 15 of these positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Detailed results for various diagnostic
materials are presented in table 4.
Amplification efficiencies and LOD
The LOD of the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA was 288 copies/ml (95 % confidence interval
191 – 755 copies/ml) determined as the 95 % probability of detection. In case of 229E, NL63,
OC43 and HKU1 the LODs were not determined due to the limited availability of quantified
reference materials but amplification efficiencies of PCR were calculated. Amplification
efficiencies for 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1 were 1.89, 1.92, 2.0 and 1.95, respectively
(figure 1). For SARS-CoV-2 an amplification efficiency cannot be calculated because this
assay uses TMA technology with subsequent hybridization to a SARS-CoV-2 specific probe.

Discussion
Rapid diagnostics of respiratory virus infections is essential in order to reduce the amount of
prescribed antibiotics, as well as for complying hygiene regulations. Identification of the virus
gives the medical staff information on whether the patient should be isolated and which
personal protective equipment should be applied. To optimise the sample-to-answer time, the
PF platform provides random access testing instead of batch-wise testing as in the hCoV /
hParaFlu R-GENE assay and the genesig COVID-19 RT-PCR. Previously, only assays for
influenza virus A/B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus 1-4, human
metapneumovirus, adenovirus and rhinovirus were available for the PF. Due to the SARSCoV-2 pandemic, a RT-PCR for the E-gene of SARS-CoV-2 was rapidly established for the
open access capability of the PF 25. Recently, a CE marked and FDA cleared SARS-CoV-2
TMA, which provides dual target detection and a high analytical sensitivity (low LOD)
became available (Aptima SARS-CoV-2) 29,30. Even though the mutation rate of SARS-CoV2 seems to be low to moderate 31, single nucleotide mutations localized at a primer binding
site in a PCR targeting the E gene have been described that subsequently could give false
negative results 32. Therefore, dual target detection should be preferred over single-target
assays in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics to preclude false negative results due to mutations
affecting the primer or probe binding site.
We evaluated the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay with a panel of 157 archived diagnostic
specimens which included a multitude of diagnostic materials from the upper and lower
respiratory tract. Although the intended use of the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 is limited to
diagnostic materials from the upper respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected with
100 % PPA and 99.0 % NPA. These results compared favorably to other studies, which had
only included nasopharyngeal swabs (94.7 % to 100 % PPA and 98.7 % to 100 % NPA)
29,30,33

. However, detection of SARS-CoV-2 in materials from the LRT is crucial as it was

shown that nasopharyngeal swabs may turn negative in the course of infection prior to
specimens from the LRT 16,34-36.
Only a single sample (NPS) gave a discordant (false positive) result in the Aptima SARSCoV-2 assay in comparison to the consensus results. However, this sample was a follow up
sample from a convalescent patient who was diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive in
previous samples. Therefore, the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay may have still detected residual
SARS-CoV-2 RNA due to its very low LOD. In this study, the LOD was determined to be
288 copies/ml, whereas others had a 100 % detection rate at 83 copies/ml also using quality
control material from Seracare but with only 20 replicates tested 30. Nevertheless, the LOD of
the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay was even lower than the LOD of the E-gene RT-PCR on the
PF (315 copies/ml). Both assays run automatized on the PF from samples that have been
processed identically before having been loaded onto the platform. On the PF, 360 µl of the
sample are pipetted for both assays, however, only 10 % of the extracted nucleic acid is used
for the PCR reaction, while in the TMA the total volume is applied. Although highly
sensitive, the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay is highly specific and does not cross-react SARSCoV (of 2003), MERS-CoV and the endemic hCoV 30, which was confirmed in our study by
testing proficiency panel specimens. Previously, cross reactivity with other respiratory viruses
was excluded extensively 30.
Diagnosis of endemic hCoV infections is not only required in URT infections but also in
more severe LRT infections as e.g. bronchiolitis 5-7. For example, hCoV NL63 binds to the
same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV-2 37 and can be associated with severe LRT infections
10,38

. Therefore, rapid diagnosis of hCoV infections is essential and can be achieved with the

novel hCoV LDT on the PF. Furthermore, a potential cross immunity to SARS-CoV-2
infection following infection with hCoV was suggested 39. Therefore, detection and
classification of hCoV might be of importance in the future, to predict the prognosis of

SARS-CoV-2 infection. The analysis of 164 diagnostic hCoV specimens from the upper and
lower respiratory tract showed a PPA of 94.9 % and a NPA of 97.6 % compared to the results
of the manual R-GENE RT-PCR. Unfortunately, a precise LOD could not be determined for
the PF LDT due to a lack of quantified reference materials but the high amplification
efficiencies of the PF LDT indeed suggested low LODs. This may also be supported by our
diagnostic experience with the PF LDT in the winter season 2019/2020. 87 of 1732 diagnostic
specimens were tested positive for endemic hCoV in the PF LDT. HCoV HKU1
predominated in this season (71 out of 87 coronavirus positive specimens). Other positive
specimens were distributed as following: NL63 10 positives, 229E 4 positives and OC43 2
positives. Another limitation of the study was that HKU1 was not included in the panel of
proficiency testing specimens probably because HKU1 cannot be grown in cell culture easily
40

. As the R-GENE assay does not differentiate the endemic hCoV, we could not confirm that

a sample positive for HKU1 in the PF LDT truly contains HKU1 RNA but 13 of 15 samples
positive for HKU1 were at least confirmed as hCoV positive in the R-GENE assay. Moreover,
the primer and probe sequences for HKU1 (and all other hCoVs) that had previously been
published 28 were reanalyzed on specificity using Nucleotide Blast (NCBI PubMed). As no
homology of the primer and probe sequences with another than the intended corresponding
hCoV sequence was detected, we presume classification to be correct.
A fast and accurate differentiation of respiratory pathogens in patients with respiratory
symptoms is essential to enable sufficient infectious control measures, particularly with
regard to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Together with the PF respiratory panel, 15
different respiratory viruses (Flu A/B, RSV, ParaFlu 1-4, hMPV, AdV, RhV, hCoV
NL63/229E/HKU1/OC43 and SARS-CoV-2) can be detected within 4 hours from one single
specimen loaded on the PF. Alternatively, a cost saving step by step diagnostic approach is
feasible on the PF, e.g. starting with SARS-CoV-2 testing and if negative, testing for other
respiratory viruses subsequently.
