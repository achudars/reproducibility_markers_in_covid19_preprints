A new transmission route for the propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, Danchin, Ng, Turinici

Abstract
Background:
A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spread from the capital of the Hubei province in
China to the rest of the country, then to most of the world. To anticipate future trends
in the development of the epidemic, we explore here, based on public records of
infected persons how variation in the virus tropism could end up in different patterns,
warranting specific way to handle the epidemic.
Methods:
We use a compartmental model to describe the evolution of an individual through
several possible states: susceptible, infected, alternative infection, detected and
removed. We fit the parameters of the model to the existing data taking into account
significant quarantine changes where necessary.
Results:
The model indicates that Wuhan quarantine measures were effective but that
alternative virus forms and a second propagation route are compatible with available
data. For Singapore and Shenzhen region the secondary route does not seem to be
active yet and the epidemic size limited.
Conclusions:
The alternative infection tropism (the gut tropism) and a secondary propagation route
are validated hypotheses using a model fitted by the available data. Corresponding
prevention measures that take into account both routes should be implemented to the
benefit of epidemic control.

A new transmission route for the propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, Danchin, Ng, Turinici

Introduction
Late in 2019 a novel coronavirus (named SARS-Cov-2 later on) was detected in
mainland China originating from the Wuhan province. The importance of the disease
took some time to be acknowledged1,2, resulting in a fairly significant number of
infected persons who subsequently spread the disease throughout China3 (all
provinces had at least one case on January 30th), then world-wide. This makes it
essential to explore the way the epidemic may spread in the near future. In the
present work we proposed several scenarios to this aim. While it is obviously
hazardous to advance models of epidemics before their course has been completely
unfolded, we think that it is helpful to evaluate methods meant to understand their
ongoing course. In particular by following how the epidemic developed at places
other than its original site of onset, we would be able to detect any unexpected
development course that might be used by health authorities to react very early on.
This would be extremely useful to detect patterns created by socio-political measures
meant to contain the disease or mutants of the virus which would result into higher
contagion or virulence, thus prompting a rapid response.
It has been established that coronaviruses are versatile in their preferred site of
infection. These viruses have the option to pass from a ―gut tropism‖ version to a
―lung tropism― instance, as was observed for other coronavirus outbreaks).4–7
Depending on the infected person or virus spread dynamics, coronavirus effects can
be more or less severe: the virus can either preserve its lung tropism with adverse
impact or act as a ―gut tropism‖ version and be relatively harmless. First reports
established that the novel 2019 instance also induces gut symptoms8. Its genetic
build up and evolution is still subject to intense research9. This multifaceted
behaviour may result in unexpected local courses of the epidemic as suggested in a
scenario of a ―double epidemic‖, as proposed for the SARS 2003 worldwide
epidemic10, except that in the present situation we would be witnessing the effect of a
single epidemic with modulated effects and propagation depending on the affected
patients and random virus mutations.
A secondary propagation route
Due to the versatility of the virus, in addition to interfering with the immune response,
contagion may involve a variety of causes, such as environments contaminated with
virus carrier secretions, dirty water effluents, besides the expected direct
contamination via aerosols. This makes that the oro-fecal route should be considered
as an important complement of contact with the virus (recent information sustains this
hypothesis11).This was observed at the Amoy Gardens cluster of cases for SARS12,13.
This observation prompted us to include in our model, besides the major respiratory
route, a secondary propagation route, which is not a direct human-to-human
propagation but rather some indirect vector (or environment element) to/from human.
A second important consequence of assuming the presence of an indirect route is
that the selection pressure on virus mutants will differ considerably between lung
tropism and gut tropism.
Finally, there may be a difference in incubation time, the ―gut tropism‖ version of the
virus would possibly cause less fever14. This hypothesis is consistent with some
propagation patterns, e.g. the first case in Macau, which was not detected at the
border, implying that that the affected person did not have fever.
We should note that this makes the disease considerably more dangerous in terms of
propagation because carriers are, at least for some time "invisible" and display a
risky behavior15,16.

This explains our choice of compartmental model (see below). Nevertheless, it
appears that some people were infected and are already discharged from hospitals,
which leads to conclude that the disease is, at this time, less dangerous than SARS.
We propose several scenarios compatible with past scenarios of coronavirus
propagation in parallel with our propagation model. Besides providing an estimation
of the impact of the epidemic, this work also suggests some countermeasures to
slow down propagation. Compared with SARS, the death burden could become
much higher (on a par with what is observed with flu) because of lack of proper
containment.

Methods
The mathematical model of epidemic propagation is the following (see Figure 1):
 we use a compartmental model17,18 to describe the evolution of an individual
through several possible conditions such as susceptible (compartment label
―S‖), latent, i.e. infected but not yet infective (label ―L‖), infective in the lung
tropism and highly symptomatic (label ―I‖), low symptomatic, infective in the
gut tropism (―A‖); the ―I‖ infected then go to ―Detected‖ (D) stage while the ―A‖
infected go to ―Removed /recovered‖ stage (label ―R‖). This is an adaptation
of existing models and especially the SLIAR model19–23 .
 We add to the model the possibility for an environmental, local, propagation
route (that accounts for soiled water, etc.). This option is represented by the
―E‖ label. With some probability, the contact between infected environmental
elements and a susceptible individual gives rise to new infections.

Figure 1 Schematic view of the SLIADRE model used in the simulations. Each compartment is
indicated with a rectangular box and the flow of individuals or infection vectors with solid arrows.
Dashed arrows indicate which compartment influences which flow.

Here N is the total population; the parameters β, βEI , βES, , , L, I, A, E, and p, of the
model are chosen in order to be compatible with past works and present insights 24.
However since the public and health authorities responses are not known and not
anticipated, some uncertainty remains in the parameters which leads us to consider
several choices of the parameter values giving rise to several scenarios of epidemic
propagation.
The mathematical formulation of the model is:
dS/dt = - β*S*(I+ A)/N - βES *E*S
dL/dt = β*S*(I+ A)/N + βES *E*S – L*L

dI/dt = p*L*L - I*I
dA/dt = (1-p)*L*L - A*A
dD/dt = I*I
dR/dt = A*A
dE/dt = βEI*(I+ A)/N- E*E

Results
We start with a simulation of the Wuhan city epidemic. We take into account the
quarantine starting January 23rd and impose a reduction (given by a multiplicative
factor that is fitted numerically) of the transmission parameters β and βES following
that date. This attenuation is found, as is the case for all other parameters, in the
course of a search procedure that imposes a match of the ―Detected‖ patients of the
model and the number of reported cases available from communications of the WHO
or Chinese authorities. The results are displayed below for the optimal parameters
given in the supplementary material. The epidemic size is around 32,000. The key
observation here is the presence and importance of the alternative form ―A‖ and the
alternative propagation route ES (see also below).

Figure 2 Results of the model for Wuhan city epidemic.

The effect and importance of quarantine measures: we tested what happens if we
discard the attenuation factors found by the fit procedure. We obtained a total
epidemic size of 112,539, which is a sharp increase with respect to the baseline
scenario.
The importance of the alternative form and the alternative propagation route
In this scenario, we neglected the alternative propagation route by setting the βES
parameter to zero in the previous run. We obtained the figure below, which shows
that absence of the ES propagation route cannot explain the way the epidemic is
unfolding (total epidemic size is down to 415 from previous figure of 17,500, closer to
observations).

Figure 3 Results of the simulations when the environmental propagation route is switched off. The
classical propagation route alone induces a much smaller epidemic size than actual data indicates.

Similar considerations hold when switching down the Alternative form of virus
presentation (results not shown here). We continue with a simulation of the
propagation of the epidemic in Shenzhen: the epidemic seems to be relatively under
control with a final epidemic size of around 1,000.

Figure 4 Results of the SLIADRE model for Shenzen.

The next simulation explores the case of Singapore: the results (not shown here) are
similar to those of Shenzen, there the epidemic does not appear to be self-sustained;
the model predicts an epidemic size of 130.

Discussion
A word of caution concerning the present view: any model is but an imperfect view of
reality and this model is no exception. In addition, the quality of the results given by
the model depends directly on the quality of the data input, and it seems likely that
some of the reported figures are subject to large error bars; in particular all
simulations of this model were done before February 12th when the accounting
procedure for of number of cases was changed in China. Therefore, one should take
the exact figures obtained with our simulations with a grain of salt. Yet, the simulation
resulting from the model does show some important qualitative features that are now
discussed.
Specifically, the hypothesis that there exists a secondary route of transmission is
meaningful and that two major types of virus effects are present is supported by the
simulation data. This has the interesting consequence that it appears that, for the city
of Wuhan, the quarantine seems to be effective—of course notwithstanding the need
for further quarantine efforts to ensure that it remains under control—. However,
since a reservoir is probably present, and the oro-fecal route may be an important
propagation factor, the prevention of this transmission element is vital to avoid any
resurgence. The first recommendation seems to be the enforcement of strict
post-epidemic measures at the possible reservoir sites.
In Singapore (and partially in Shenzhen as well) even if the current data indicates
that the number of cases is likely to increase, is does not indicate that a secondary
propagation route is already effective. However, efforts are to be made to ensure that
this remains true in the future and the control of the secondary route, which makes
the difference between a large scale epidemic and a controlled outbreak, remains an
important target for public health measures.

Conclusions
Elaborating on the behavior of previous coronavirus outbreaks, we worked out the
hypothesis that an alternative infection tropism (the gut tropism) linked to a
secondary propagation route (through environment) is affecting the development of
the present 2019-nCoV epidemic. Our epidemic propagation model, when fit to
existing data, indicated that, among all regions analysed (Wuhan city in the Huabei
region in mainland China, Singapore, Shenzhen region), the propagation of the
disease in the city of Wuhan underwent an original course. It appeared to be
substantially facilitated by a secondary propagation route, thus substantiating the
beneficial effect of an effective quarantine. The main message of our exploration is
that relevant prevention measures that take into account both propagation routes
should be implemented to contain the extension of the epidemic to further sites,
especially when novel sites are uncovered.
