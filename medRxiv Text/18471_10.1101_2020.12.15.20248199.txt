Abstract
Background:
Patient characteristics, clinical care, resource use, and outcomes associated with hospitalization
for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Canada are not well described.

Methods:
We described all adult discharges from inpatient medical services and medical-surgical
intensive care units (ICU) between November 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 at 7 hospitals in
Toronto and Mississauga, Ontario. We compared patients hospitalized with COVID-19, influenza
and all other conditions using multivariable regression models controlling for patient age, sex,
comorbidity, and residence in long-term-care.

Results:
There were 43,462 discharges in the study period, including 1,027 (3.0%) with COVID-19 and
783 (2.3%) with influenza. Patients with COVID-19 had similar age to patients with influenza
and other conditions (median age 65 years vs. 68 years and 68 years, respectively, SD<0.1).
Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be male (59.1%) and 11.7% were long-term care
residents. Patients younger than 50 years accounted for 21.2% of all admissions for COVID-19
and 24.0% of ICU admissions. Compared to influenza, patients with COVID-19 had significantly
greater mortality (unadjusted 19.9% vs 6.1%, aRR: 3.47, 95%CI: 2.57, 4.67), ICU use (unadjusted
26.4% vs 18.0%, aRR 1.52, 95%CI: 1.27, 1.83) and hospital length-of-stay (unadjusted median
8.7 days vs 4.8 days, aRR: 1.40, 95%CI: 1.20, 1.64), and not significantly different 30-day
readmission (unadjusted 8.6% vs 8.2%, aRR: 1.01, 95%CI: 0.72, 1.42).

Interpretation:
Adults hospitalized with COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic used substantial
hospital resources and suffered high mortality. COVID-19 was associated with significantly
greater mortality, ICU use, and hospital length-of-stay than influenza.

Introduction
The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted healthcare
systems around the world. Studies in the United States, United Kingdom, and China report that
patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have high rates of critical illness and mortality.1–5 Two
small Canadian case series have described care for critically ill patients with COVID-19 and
found that mortality was up to 25%.6,7 However, hospitalizations for COVID-19 in Canada are
not well described, particularly outside of ICU. More than 80% of patients hospitalized for
COVID-19 may not require intensive care.1,4 The features of COVID-19 hospitalizations in
Canada may differ from other countries due to differences in populations, public health, and
health care systems. Case fatality rates for COVID-19 vary dramatically worldwide.8 In Canada,
COVID-19 has disproportionately affected urban and suburban ethnic minority populations,9
and residents of Long-Term Care facilities10,11.
Seasonal influenza is a useful comparator to assess the severity of illness associated with
COVID-1912 as it is another respiratory virus with high attendant morbidity and mortality, and it
is familiar to the general public. The relative severity of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza
remains controversial.13 The preponderance of evidence suggests that COVID-19 has greater
morbidity and mortality but the magnitude of this difference remains uncertain.13–18 The
purpose of this study was to describe patient characteristics, resource use, clinical care, and
outcomes for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at 7 hospitals in Toronto and Mississauga,
Ontario, Canada. We compared hospitalizations for COVID-19 with hospitalizations for influenza
and all other medical ward and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions.

Methods
Design and Setting
This retrospective cohort study was conducted at 7 large hospitals (5 academic and 2
community-based teaching hospitals) in Toronto and Mississauga, Ontario, participating in
GEMINI, a hospital research collaborative.19 Research ethics board approval was obtained from
all participating organizations.
Data Collection
Administrative and clinical data were collected from hospital information systems for
GEMINI as has previously been described in detail 19,20. Manual validation of a subset of GEMINI
data found 98-100% accuracy compared to detailed medical record review.20 Patient
demographics, hospital resource use, and outcomes were collected from hospitals as reported
to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Discharge Abstract Database and
National Ambulatory Care Reporting System. Additional clinical data, including laboratory test
results, radiology tests, vital signs and in-hospital medication orders were extracted from
hospital information systems. At one hospital, vital signs were manually abstracted only for
patients with COVID-19 because they were not available through electronic extraction.
Study population
We included all adult patients (greater than 18 years) discharged from an inpatient
medical service or medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU), including coronary care units,
between November 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020. Medical services included all medical specialties
(e.g. general medicine, cardiology, respirology, etc.). This captures all hospitalizations for

COVID-19 and influenza and their medical complications but misses a small number of patients
hospitalized for non-medical reasons (e.g. surgical, psychiatric, obstetrical) who were
incidentally found to have COVID-19 or influenza and were not subsequently transferred to a
medical service.
Exposures
We categorized patients into three mutually-exclusive categories: COVID-19, influenza,
and other medical admissions. We identified patients with COVID-19 based on International
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th revision (ICD-10-CA)
codes U07.1 (“COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by a laboratory test”)21 and U07.2 (“COVID-19
diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but lab results inconclusive, unavailable, or not
performed”).21 We identified patients with influenza based on ICD-10-CA codes J09-J11, which
an Ontario hospital study found to be 91% sensitive and 97% specific.22 Cases with both
influenza and COVID-19 were categorized in the COVID-19 group. All admissions other than
COVID-19 and influenza were considered for “other” conditions.
Outcomes and Process Measures
We report in-hospital mortality and readmission to any medical or medical-surgical ICU
service at any participating hospital within 7- and 30-days of discharge. To report readmission,
we excluded patients who died and those discharged within the last 7-days and 30-days of the
study period, respectively. We also report total hospital length-of-stay, emergency department
(ED) length-of-stay, admission to the ICU, and ICU length-of-stay. We also describe use of
thoracic computed tomography (CT) and in-hospital use of respiratory-acting antibiotics23–25

(see Appendix for details), anticoagulants, and systemic corticosteroids, as captured by
medication orders after admission. These medications were selected because their prescribing
may be associated with COVID-19,26,27 although the study period was prior to the publication of
the RECOVERY dexamethasone trial results.26 We describe the use of invasive mechanical
ventilation, renal replacement therapy (including both newly initiated and chronic hemodialysis
and peritoneal dialysis), gastrointestinal endoscopy, and bronchoscopy identified using
Canadian Classification of Health Interventions codes.
Patient Characteristics
We report patient age, sex, residence in long-term care facility, and transfer from acute
care hospital as reported by hospitals to CIHI. We categorized comorbid conditions based on
ICD-10-CA codes using the Clinical Classification Software Refined (CCSR),28,29 the Charlson
Comorbidity Index,30 and the Hospital Frailty Risk Score31,32. We report baseline laboratory test
results and vital signs, defined as the first measurement that occurred between ED triage and
48 hours after admission.
Statistical Analysis
We compared baseline characteristics between groups using standardized differences
(SD), with SD>0.1 suggesting imbalance between groups.33 We compared unadjusted
differences in clinical care, resource use and clinical outcomes between groups using chi-square
tests for categorical variables, one-way ANOVA for continuous variables with a normal
distribution, and Kruskall-Wallis tests for continuous variables with a non-normal distribution.
We used multivariable regression to compare outcomes between groups after adjusting for

patient age, sex, Charlson score, residence in long-term care, and admitting hospital. Poisson
regression34 was used for mortality, readmission, and ICU admission and negative binomial
regression was used for hospital length-of-stay and ICU length-of stay. Separate models were fit
to compare COVID-19 to influenza and COVID-19 to other conditions.
Subgroup and Sensitivity Analyses
First, we examined outcomes stratified by age groups. Second, we report patient
characteristics and outcomes among the patients admitted to ICU. Third, we replicated all
analyses after excluding COVID-19 diagnoses based on code U07.2 (patients with no laboratory
confirmation). Finally, because participating hospitals are tertiary and quaternary care centres
with large critical care units, we replicated analyses after including only patients admitted
through the ED. This excluded interfacility transfers, which primarily involve patients
transferred for critical care and might lead to an overestimation of illness severity.

Results
During the study period there were 43,462 discharges, representing 34,782 unique
patients. There were 1,027 discharges (3.0%) with COVID-19 (944 laboratory-confirmed),
representing 972 unique patients. These represented 23.5% of all Ontario hospitalizations for
COVID-19 (N= 4,373)35 during the study period. There were 783 discharges (2.3%) with
influenza, representing 763 unique patients. Fewer than 6 patients had coexisting COVID-19
and influenza (exact value suppressed to limit risk of patient reidentification).
Patient Characteristics
Patients with COVID-19 had a median age of 65 years (IQR 53, 79) which was similar to
influenza (median 68 years, IQR 55, 80) and other conditions (median 68 years, IQR 55, 80,
SD<0.1) (Table 1). Patients with COVID-19, compared to patients with influenza or other
conditions, were more likely to be male (59.1% vs 50.8% and 56.1%, respectively, SD=0.17),
more likely to have a Charlson score of zero (54.1% vs. 38.8% and 43.6%, respectively, SD=0.31),
more likely to have intermediate or high hospital frailty risk score (37.2% vs 28.2% and 27.3%,
respectively, SD=0.22), and more likely to reside in a long-term care facility (11.7% vs 4.5% and
2.9%, respectively, SD=0.34).
Hypertension (34.7%) and diabetes mellitus (27.7%) were common in patients with
COVID-19 and occurred at similar rates in influenza and other conditions (Table 1).
Neurocognitive disorders (including delirium and dementia) were more common in patients
with COVID-19 compared to influenza and other conditions (16.9% vs. 13.4% and 10.1%,

respectively, SD=0.20). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was more common in patients
with influenza (12.3%) than with COVID-19 (5.4%) or other conditions (5.7%, SD=0.25).
Differences in baseline vital signs and laboratory test results are presented in Appendix
Table 1. Presenting vital signs did not appear to differ meaningfully across groups, although
patients with COVID-19 were more likely to require oxygen within 48 hours of hospitalization
(46.0% vs. 40.1% and 21.3.6%, respectively, p <0.001). Patients with COVID-19 were more likely
to have arterial blood gases (20.3% vs. 14.3% and 9.6%, p <0.001) and D-dimer measured
(38.4% vs. 4.3% and 3.7%, respectively, p<0.001). Patients with COVID-19 had lower arterial
pO2 (74.0 vs 81.5 and 108.0, respectively, p<0.001) but no significant difference in D-dimer
values (p=0.22).
Mortality and Readmission
Compared to patients with influenza and other conditions, patients with COVID-19 had
significantly greater unadjusted in-hospital mortality (19.9% vs 6.1% and 5.9%, respectively,
p<0.001, Table 2). Readmission within 7- and 30-days occurred in 4.4% and 8.6% of patients
with COVID-19, respectively, which was not significantly different from influenza and other
conditions.
Regression model results are reported in Table 3. After adjustment, patients with COVID19 were more likely to die in hospital compared to patients with influenza (adjusted Relative
Risk 3.47, 95% CI: 2.57, 4.67) and other conditions (aRR 3.58, 95% CI: 3.16, 4.06). There was no
significant difference in 30-day readmission.
Hospital Resource Use and Clinical Care

Compared to patients with influenza and other conditions, patients with COVID-19 had
greater unadjusted ICU use (26.4% vs 18.0% and 23.5%, respectively, p<0.001) and hospital
length-of-stay (median 8.7 days vs.4.8 days and 4.4 days, respectively, p<0.001) and shorter ED
length-of-stay (median 8.7 hours vs. 21.1 hours and 13.6 hours, respectively p<0.001) (Table 2).
COVID-19 patients were more likely to receive invasive mechanical ventilation (18.5% vs 9.3%
and 9.7%, respectively) and renal replacement therapy (7.7% vs 5.5% and 4.3%, respectively, p
<0.001) but were less likely to receive bronchoscopy or endoscopy (Table 2).
Patients with COVID-19 received at least one thoracic CT in 19.7% of admissions and at
least one respiratory-acting antibiotic order in 71.6% of cases, which was similar to influenza
and greater than other conditions (Table 2). Patients with COVID-19 received systemic
corticosteroids in 16.7% of cases and received either warfarin or a direct-acting oral
anticoagulant in 15.4% of cases.
After multivariable adjustment, patients with COVID-19 were more likely to use ICU than
patients with influenza (aRR 1.52, 95% CI: 1.27, 1.83) and other conditions (aRR 1.21, 95% CI:
1.09, 1.34). Adjusted total hospital length-of-stay was greater for COVID-19 than influenza
(adjusted rate ratio: 1.40, 95%CI: 1.20, 1.64, corresponding to an additional 1.45 days, 95%CI:
0.5, 3.2 days) and other conditions (aRR: 1.79, 95%CI: 1.66, 1.92, corresponding to an additional
4.12 days, 95% CI: 3.03, 5.52 days).
Age-Stratified Outcomes
Age-stratified outcomes are presented in Table 4. Among patients with COVID-19 who
were less than 50 years, 50-75 years, and greater than 75 years of age, unadjusted mortality

was 5.1%, 13.5%, and 38.9%, respectively; ICU use was 29.8%, 35.2%, and 11.3%, respectively;
and 30-day readmission was 11.6%, 8.8%, and 5.7%, respectively.
Intensive Care Unit Admissions
Among patients admitted to the ICU (Table 5), those with COVID-19 were younger than
those with influenza or other conditions (median age 59 years vs. 64 years and 66 years,
respectively, SD=0.35), more likely to die (25.5% vs 19.9% and 11.9%, respectively, p<0.001) and
had longer ICU LOS (median 10.9 days vs 6.0 days and 2.1 days, respectively p<0.001).
Sensitivity Analyses
Results of all analyses were materially unchanged after excluding the 79 COVID-19
admissions without laboratory confirmation of virus infection (data not shown).
To avoid overestimating severity of illness because of interfacility transfers for critical
care, we examined the subset of patients admitted from the ED. ED admissions (N=30,533)
accounted for 70.3% of all admissions, including 79.8% of COVID-19 admissions, 86.0% of
influenza admissions, and 69.7% of other admissions. Admissions for cardiac conditions and
procedures were the most common causes of non-ED admissions. Findings were generally
similar, except differences in hospital length-of-stay were somewhat attenuated and ICU use
was less frequent among COVID-19 patients under 50 years (16.9%) and 50-75 years (24.9%)
compared to the overall cohort (29.8% and 35.2%, respectively). Mortality among patients with
COVID-19 under 50 years of age was also lower (<3.6% from ED and 5.0% overall). COVID-19
was consistently associated with worse outcomes than influenza and other conditions. See
Appendix Tables 2-6 for details.

Discussion
This multicentre cohort study describes patient characteristics, hospital resource use,
clinical care, and outcomes for 1,027 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 in Ontario, Canada,
during the first wave of the pandemic. To our knowledge, this represents the first detailed
characterization of adult hospitalizations for COVID-19 in Canada. These findings can support
future efforts to model hospital resource use as the pandemic evolves.36 Even after controlling
for age, sex, comorbidity, and residence in long-term care, patients with COVID-19 had 3.5times greater risk of death in hospital than patients with influenza or other conditions. Patients
with COVID-19 were more likely to use ICU and invasive mechanical ventilation and had greater
hospital length-of-stay.
Our study contributes to the emerging literature describing hospitalization for COVID-19.
Two Canadian case series (involving 117 patients in Vancouver6 and 75 patients in Montreal7)
described the care of ICU patients with COVID-19. In these reports, 57-63% of patients required
invasive mechanical ventilation and 15-25% of patients died in hospital. Similarly, we found that
invasive mechanical ventilation was used in 69% of ICU admissions for COVID-19 and 25% died.
ICU care was received in 26% of all COVID-19 admissions, and 18% of those admitted through
the ED. We extend this literature by including patients who did not require ICU and by reporting
detailed data regarding presenting characteristics, clinical care, resource use, and outcomes.
Mortality and ICU use in these Canadian hospitalizations were similar to the United States1–3,
China5,37, and the United Kingdom4. We found that 8.7% of patients with COVID-19 were
readmitted within 30 days, which is comparable to findings from the United States,3,38 and is
important for modeling resource use.

Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had a median age of 65 years, which was younger
than in the United Kingdom (73 years)4 but somewhat older than studies in the United States
and China (range 51-63 years)1,2,5,37. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be male (59%)
and reside in long-term care (12%), which is consistent with evidence that COVID-19 affects
men more severely39 and reflects the high burden of COVID-19 in long-term care facilities in
Ontario10,11. However, 54% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had a Charlson comorbidity
score of zero and 21% occurred in people under 50 years of age. Mortality in the younger group
was relatively low (5.1% overall and <3.6% among ED admissions) but ICU use (29.8%) and 30day readmission (11.6%) were high, reinforcing that COVID-19 can cause serious illness in
younger people and those with relatively little comorbid disease.
Our study also contributes to comparisons of COVID-19 with seasonal influenza. The
infection fatality rate of COVID-19 may be as much as 10-times greater than influenza15,16 but
these comparisons are indirect and have been disputed.13 In a systematic review of
observational studies, the in-hospital mortality rate of patients with influenza was reported to
be approximately 3-6%18, which is similar to our finding (6.1%). After adjusting for age, sex,
comorbidity and long-term care residence, compared to influenza, patients with COVID-19 had
greater risk of death (3.5-times) and ICU admission (1.5-times), and longer hospital stay (1.4times). Thus, COVID-19 is substantially more severe than seasonal influenza, and this
information could assist with public health messaging.
More than 70% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 received at least one physician
order for respiratory-acting antibiotics, which was comparable to patients hospitalized with
influenza. Bacterial co-infection is reported to affect up to 20-30% of ICU patients with

influenza40,41 but only 8% of ICU patients with COVID-19.42 Our findings reinforce concerns that
antibiotic use in COVID-19 may increase antimicrobial resistance and highlight the importance
of future research in this area.
Our study has several limitations. First, we included 7 large academic hospitals. COVID-19
patients were transferred to these hospitals for critical care, which may lead us to overestimate
the severity of COVID-19. To address this concern, we compared COVID-19 to influenza and
other conditions, for which patients could also have been transferred. We also replicated our
analyses in patients admitted through the ED to exclude inter-facility transfers. In this analysis,
20% of COVID-19 patients died in hospital, 18% required ICU, and the mortality rate compared
to influenza was even greater (aRR 3.96). We believe our results are generalizable as mortality
in our cohort was consistent with large studies from the United States1 and United Kingdom4
and we included approximately 25% of all COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario during the study
period. Second, although COVID-19 disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minority
communities43, data regarding patient race, ethnicity, language, or socioeconomic status is not
collected systematically in Ontario hospitals and could not be reported. Third, we were unable
to collect information about clinical history or symptoms, as this was not captured
systematically in administrative or electronic medical record data. Fourth, we report 30-day
readmission to a medical service or medical-surgical ICU at any participating hospital. Although
this likely underestimates the total readmission rate, 82% of readmissions occur to the original
hospital in our region44, and we were able to also capture readmissions to other participating
hospitals. Fifth, the severity of seasonal influenza may vary from year-to-year and we compared
COVID-19 only to influenza cases in 2019-2020. However, the mortality associated with

influenza hospitalizations in our study (6.1%) is consistent with mortality rates of approximately
3-6% in a systematic review involving more than 120,000 influenza hospitalizations18,
suggesting our results are likely generalizable. Finally, vital signs are not consistently recorded
electronically at all participating hospitals, particularly when patients are in the emergency
department or intensive care unit, which could have led to an underestimation of vital signs
abnormalities.
Conclusion
Adults hospitalized with COVID-19 at 7 hospitals in Ontario during the first wave of the
pandemic used substantial hospital resources and suffered high rates of mortality. Patients
hospitalized with COVID-19 had significantly greater mortality, ICU use, invasive mechanical
ventilation use, and hospital length-of-stay than patients with influenza or other conditions.
