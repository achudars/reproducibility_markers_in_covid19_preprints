ABSTRACT
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been associated with a
worldwide pandemic. We assessed data as of November 25, 2020 from our combined laboratories and as
reported for states in the United States (US) and countries for case, death, and testing rates per million to
determine causes of rate differences. SARS-CoV-2 naso-pharyngeal (NP) RNA testing in 1,179,912
subjects in 47 states (39 of which with >100 cases) are reported, with a mean 9.3% positive rate,
comparable to the 7.0% rate reported nationwide. In 91 previously positive (2-4 weeks) subjects, NP swab
testing was twice as likely to be positive (58.6%) as saliva samples (21.5%). We also documented that NP
swabs could remain positive for 6 weeks or longer. Our positive rates per state agreed reasonably well
with reported national data (r=0.609, P<0.0001). The highest US case rates per million were in the midwest; the highest death and testing rates were in the northeast. Of 47 countries, the highest case, death,
and testing rates per million were mainly in Europe and the Americas, with the lowest rates in Asia.
Correlations between case and death rates and case and testing rates were very different between states
(0.076 and -0.093, respectively) and countries (0.763 and 0.600, respectively). In conclusion, outpatient
saliva testing was not as sensitive as NP testing for detection, and the marked variability in case and death
rates was most likely due to differences in public health measures, viral and human genetic differences
and age of cases, rather than due to differences in testing rates.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) associated with a worldwide pandemic. The diagnosis is made by SARSCoV-2 RNA detection in naso-pharyngeal (NP) swabs, nasal swabs, oro-pharyngeal (OP) swabs, or
saliva.1-4 The greatest number of deaths/million in the population has been reported in the northeastern
United States. Up to 50% of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients can remain symptomatic; however, such
individuals can spread infections.5-7 The average onset of symptoms after infection is about 5 days (range
2-14 days). COVID-19 fatality is substantially higher in the elderly and in those with cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and lung disease.
COVID-19 disease symptoms include fever, fatigue, cough, loss of smell and taste, gastrointestinal symptoms, and shortness of breath. The virus spreads between people mainly via respiratory
droplets. Complications include severe acute respiratory syndrome and potentially death from
overwhelming infection and inflammation.1-4 While testing is critical for diagnosis, public health
measures (e.g. face masks, social distancing and quarantining, hand washing, and contact tracing) are
critical for prevention of new cases even after widespread vaccinations becomes available. Subjects that
are positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA based on NP swabs may not have transmissible virus over time, but
may have only viral fragments in their nasal passages.7 Our goals were to assess data obtained from over
a million SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests performed in our respective laboratories, as well as available US and
worldwide data, in terms of cases, deaths, and testing per million in the population, in order to examine
potential causes for the large rate differences observed between states and countries.

METHODS
Populations studied
A total of 1,179,912 subjects (58.2% female; age range 1-101 years; median [IQR] age 49.0
[35.0-6.0] years; 18.2% ≥65 years of age) were assessed in physician offices, clinics, and hospitals. These
subjects had NP, OP, or nasal swab samples collected by healthcare providers at various sites throughout
the United States, placed in viral transport media, and submitted by overnight express courier service for
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection to Boston Heart Diagnostics (Framingham, MA) beginning on April 17,
2020, Diatherix (Huntsville, AL) beginning on March 16, 2020, and/or Viracor (Lee’s Summit, MO)
beginning on March 13, 2020. For this analysis, data assessment was ended as of November 1, 2020.
Table 1 presents data from hospitals, clinic sites, and healthcare provider offices in 39 states with more
than 100 results for samples sent to these laboratories. For this research, patient data were extracted from
medical records without name or identification number and were analyzed as anonymized data,
determined exempt from institutional review board approval by Advarra Institutional Review Board
(Columbia, MD). In our view, this research is exempted from requirement for human institutional review
board approval as per exemption 4, as listed at https://grants.nih.gov/policy/ humansubjects.htm and at the
open education resource (OER) website for research involving human subjects. This exemption “involves
the collection or study of data or specimens if publicly available or recorded such that subjects cannot be
identified”. We had this designation and our research reviewed by the Advarra Institutional Review Board
(Columbia, MD) and their determination was that “had the request for exempt determination been
submitted prior to initiation of research activities, the research would have met the criteria for exemption
from institutional review board review under 45 CFR 46.104(d). Therefore, they agreed that this research
did not require institutional review board approval.
We also carried out a paired NP swab and saliva sample study, where we collected samples from
previously positive subjects (n=91, mean age 53 years, 53% female) using an approved human
institutional review board protocol (Trinity Health of New England, Hartford, CT); informed written
consent was obtained from each subject. These subjects had all been positive 2-4 weeks earlier for SARS-

CoV-2 RNA based on NP swabs. The saliva was collected in viral transport media using kits obtained
from Strategic Laboratory Partners (Nashville, TN).
To compare our own primary data with data from the general population, we first accessed data as
of September 1, 2020 and then subsequently on November 25, 2020 from the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) website (https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/index.html#testing), as well as the
website https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?, which uses a large number of data bases. For
worldwide country data, we accessed the website https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/? and the
World Health Organization website https://www.covid19.who.int/ on September 1, 2020 and again on
November 25, 2020. On the latter date, there were 60,559,841 cases (7,769/million) and 1,423,530 deaths
(183/million) worldwide. We specifically examined data for all countries with populations >50 million, as
well as other selected countries. This analysis included 47 countries: 13 in Asia and Oceania; 11 in Europe;
5 in North America; 7 in South America; 7 in the Middle East; and 4 in Africa (Table 2).
SARS-CoV-2 viral detection
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in NP, OP, nasal swabs or saliva was performed using
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. As previously described, the Viracor assay using a reverse
transcriptase PCR and TaqMan chemistry, targeted two regions of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleo-capsid (N)
gene.8 The Boston Heart Diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 RNA assay was very similar to the Viracor assay
except that this assay used Thermo-Fisher TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kits (Waltham, MA) and targeted
a region in the N gene, a region in the spike (S) glycoprotein gene, and a region in the ORF1 gene. For
both assays, a positive value was defined as detection of SARS-COV-2 RNA at a cycle threshold ≤37
cycles. The Diatherix assay was based on nested, end-point PCR technology that allowed for SARS-CoV2 RNA detection through target enrichment and amplification. All assays have received emergency use
authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. The sensitivity and specificity of these assays
compared in known positive and negative subjects was found to be >95%.

RESULTS
United States data
As shown in Table 1, of 1,179,912 subjects having NP, OP, or nasal swabs done between March
13 and November 1, 2020 at various sites throughout the United States, the mean positive rate was 9.3%.
When we first tabulated these data on June 1, 2020, New York State had by far the highest percentage of
positive subjects (43.5%); this rate decreased to 4.3%, when we included a total of 213,926 tests, mainly
done for health screening and for nursing home residents and employees. In our total study population,
18.2% were ≥65 years of age, of whom 6.9% were positive compared to 10.5% in the <65-year age
group. Therefore, in the population we tested, older people did not have a higher positivity rate; in fact, it
was lower (P<0.0001), even though it has been well documented that elderly subjects have a significantly
higher case fatality rate than younger subjects.
We noted a significant correlation for the percentage of positives (r=0.609, P<0.0001) between
our data and the CDC state-wide data for the 39 states where we had >100 cases/state (Table 1).
As of November 25, 2020, based on CDC data, the top ten states in the United States for cases/million (all
>50,000/million) were, in order, 1) North Dakota, 2) South Dakota, 3) Iowa, 4) Wisconsin, 5) Nebraska,
6) Utah, 7) Montana, 8) Illinois, 9) Kansas, and 10) Minnesota. In contrast, the top ten states in terms of
deaths/million were 1) New Jersey, 2) New York, 3) Massachusetts, 4) Connecticut, 5) Louisiana, 6)
Mississippi, 7) Rhode Island, 8) North Dakota, 9) Illinois, and 10) South Dakota. In terms of testing per 1
million, the top ten states were 1) Rhode Island, 2) Massachusetts, 3) New York, 4) Connecticut, 5)
Illinois, 6) Louisiana, 7) Maryland, 8) New Mexico, 9) Minnesota, and 10) 6) Mississippi, 7) Rhode
Island, 8) North Dakota, 9) Illinois, and 10) New Jersey.
The ten lowest states in terms of cases/million were 1) Oregon, 2) Washington, 3) West Virginia,
4) Virginia, 5) Pennsylvania, 6) California, 7) Connecticut, 8) Massachusetts, 9) Maryland, and 10) Ohio
(Table 1). Similarly, the ten lowest states in terms of deaths/million were 1) Oregon, 2) Utah, 3)
Washington, 4) Wyoming, 5) Oklahoma, 6) Kentucky, 7) Virginia, 8) California, 9) North Carolina, and

10) Idaho. The ten lowest states in terms of tests/million were 1) Oregon, 2) Pennsylvania, 3) Kansas, 4)
Colorado, 5) Alabama, 6) Arizona, 7) South Dakota, 8) Washington, 9) Idaho, and 10) Texas.
Figure 1 shows the relationship between death and case rates per million by state (Panel A), as
well as the relationship between the testing rate and the case rate (Panel B), both on a linear scale. These
data from the CDC are based on 39,140 cases/million, 806 deaths/million and 559,370 tests/million in the
US population. As can be clearly seen, the northeastern states of New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts,
Connecticut, and Rhode Island had very high death rates per case. Intermediate mortality per case were
observed in the southern states and the midwestern states. The lowest mortality per case were seen in the
western states, especially Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. As of September 1, 2020, the overall
correlation, using Pearson correlation coefficient analysis, between deaths/million and cases/million was
0.473 (P<0.0001); between tests/million and cases/million, it was 0.398 (P<0.0001).9 By November 25,
2020, the correlations had decreased significantly to 0.076 and -0.093, respectively (Figure 1). In our
view, these changes relate to more testing and less population public health measures. The states where
the governors introduced early and constant public health measures had the lowest case and death rates,
and the converse was also true.
Paired NP swab and saliva data
In the paired analysis examining positivity rates for NP swabs and saliva samples in 91
previously positive subjects, we noted that 58.6% of subjects were still positive based on NP swabs, but
only 21.5% were positive based on saliva collection. These differences were statistically significant
P<0.01). We also documented that NP swabs could remain positive for 6 weeks or longer in this analysis
in some cases.
Worldwide data
Data on the relationship between deaths/million and cases/million and between tests/million and
cases/million are shown in Figure 2. These data are plotted on a log scale because of the marked
variability between countries. As of September 1, 2020, the correlation between cases/million and

deaths/million (0.488, P<0.0001) was similar to what we observed for the US states, as were the
correlation between cases/million and tests/million (0.395; P<0.0001). However, as of November 25,
2020, the correlations worldwide had moved in the opposite direction. The correlations between
cases/million and deaths/million had increased to 0.763 (P<0.0001) and those between cases/million and
tests/million had increased to 0.600(P<0.0001).
As of November 25, 2020, as shown in Table 2, the top ten countries for cases/million in order
were: 1) Belgium, 2) Qatar, 3) United States, 4) Panama, 5) Israel, 6) Spain, 7) France, 8) Argentina, 9)
Brazil, and 10) Peru. The top ten countries in terms of deaths/million in order were: 1) Belgium, 2) Peru,
3) Spain, 4) Italy, 5) United Kingdom, 6) Argentina, 7) United States, 8) Brazil, 9) Mexico, and 10) Chile.
In terms of testing per 1 million, the top countries in order were: 1) United Kingdom, 2) Israel, 3) United
States, 4) Russia, 5) Belgium, 6) Spain, 7) Norway, 8) Italy, 9) Finland, and 10) Germany.
The ten countries with the lowest cases/million in order were: 1) Vietnam, 2) Thailand, 3) China,
4) Nigeria, 5) New Zealand, 6) South Korea, 7) Ethiopia, 8) Japan, 9) Australia, and 10) Myanmar.

DISCUSSION
The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection has been in large part due to its very contagious
nature and the fact that many infected people are asymptomatic. Although the pandemic started in China,
its spread there, as well as in other countries in Asia, has been very well controlled; and the case and
death rates per million in these countries have been very low. One cannot attribute this excellent
infection control to testing, but rather to outstanding public health measures (use of face masks,
isolation, contact tracing, and social distancing). Even in countries such as India, Bangladesh, the
Philippines, and Australia with >1,000 cases/million, death rates have been low. In contrast, subjects
in Europe, North America, South America, and parts of the Middle East have fared far worse with
much higher case and death rates, despite a large amount of testing. In the midwestern and southern
states of the United States case rates have been very high, while death rates have been the highest in
the world in the northeastern states, despite a lot of testing. This latter finding may well have been due
to the high infection rate early on in the United States pandemic in long-term care facilities in the
northeast. Recently, there has been a large decrease in the correlation between cases and testing in the
United States, indicating a lot of testing, but lack of public health measures, especially in younger
people participating in demonstrations and political rallies.9
Rates in the United States and Brazil were comparable in cases and deaths, due in our view to
very limited public health measures and lack of central government leadership in both countries. In
contrast, Japan, South Korea, China, and Thailand had much lower rates, presumably due to
significantly better public health measures. Many European countries had case rates lower than the
United States, but comparable death rates. These differences could relate to the age of subjects
becoming infected. The importance of public health measures may best be exemplified by comparing
Sweden, which did not introduce such measures, to its neighbors Norway and Finland, which did
introduce such measures. Sweden had case and death rates that were much higher than rates observed
in Norway and Finland. These marked differences occurred despite the fact that these countries had
fairly comparable testing rates.

There may be other potential causes of the large variability in case and death rates between
countries. One such possibility is mutations in the virus. The D614G amino acid substitution in the S
glycoprotein as well as other variants encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 S gene has been reported to result in
forms of the virus that may be more infective and virulent than the original Wuhan strain.10-16 The D614G
variant has been found in over 90% of United States strains. Another possibility is human genetic
variation. Genome-wide association studies have identified a 3p21.31 DNA locus as being associated with
a significant 1.77-fold increased risk for respiratory failure in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.17 This
genetic variant, apparently inherited from Neanderthals, is not present in subjects indigenous to China,
Japan, or Sub-Saharan Africa, but has a frequency of ~5‒8% in North America and western Europe and
~20% in India.18 Therefore, both viral and human genetic variation may play a role in country differences
with regard to SARS-CoV-2 cases and mortality rates. Another potential reason for mortality differences is
the age of infected people, since it is well known the elderly have much higher SARS-CoV-2 mortality
rates than the young. However, it is most likely that the efficiency of public health measures accounts for
most of the variability in case and death rates per million in the population.19,20
Recently, there has been a significant increase in SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing in the United States in
an effort to control the pandemic in the absence of vaccines. There have also been efforts to find easier
ways to carry out such testing. Data from Yale New Haven Medical Center indicated that self-collected
saliva samples yielded similar or better results than did NP swabs in terms of detecting SARS-CoV-2
positive hospitalized patients based on 44 paired samples.3 However, our data in previously positive
outpatients indicated that saliva analysis only identified about half as many positive cases as compared to
NP swab analysis. Saliva testing is being widely used.

CONCLUSIONS
Our data indicate that: 1) outpatient saliva testing is not as sensitive as NP testing; 2) the marked
variability in case and death rates between states and countries is mainly due to difference in public health
measures; 3) variations in SARS-CoV-2 viral genetics, human genetics, and age of populations getting
infected may also play a role in rate differences; and 4) rate differences are least likely to be due
differences in testing rates. Our overall data strongly support the benefits of public health measures in
preventing spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In our view, the major reason for the very high case and
mortality rates in the United States, as well as some other countries, has been the consistent lack of such
measures, due to failures of central government and public agency leadership.
