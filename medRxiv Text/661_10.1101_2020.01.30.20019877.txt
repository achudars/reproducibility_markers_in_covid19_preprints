Abstract
A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has recently emerged as a global threat. As the epidemic
progresses, many disease modelers have focused on estimating the basic reproductive number R0 – the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise
susceptible population. The modeling approaches and resulting estimates of R0 vary widely,
despite relying on similar data sources. Here, we present a novel statistical framework for
comparing and combining different estimates of R0 across a wide range of models by decomposing the basic reproductive number into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate
r, the mean generation interval Ḡ, and the generation-interval dispersion κ. We then apply
our framework to early estimates of R0 for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We show that many
early R0 estimates are overly confident. Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of R0 , including the shape of the generation-interval
distribution, in efforts to estimate R0 at the outset of an epidemic.

Introduction

Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading in China and
other parts of the world (World Health Organization, 2020d). Although the virus is believed
to have originated from animal reservoirs (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020),
the ability of SARS-CoV-2 ability to directly transmit between humans has posed a greater
threat for its spread (Huang et al., 2020; World Health Organization, 2020c). As of February
27, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed 82,294 cases of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), including 3,664 confirmed cases in 46 different countries, outside
China (World Health Organization, 2020a).
As the disease continues to spread, many researchers have already published their analyses
of the outbreak as pre-prints (e.g., Bedford et al. (2020); Imai et al. (2020); Liu et al. (2020);
Majumder and Mandl (2020); Read et al. (2020a); Zhao et al. (2020)) and in peer-reviewed
journals (e.g., Li et al. (2020); Riou and Althaus (2020b); Wu et al. (2020); Zhao et al. (2020)),
focusing in particular on estimates of the basic reproductive number R0 (i.e., the average
number of secondary cases generated by a primary case in a fully susceptible population
(Anderson and May, 1991; Diekmann et al., 1990)). Estimates of the basic reproductive
number are of interest during an outbreak because they provide information about the level
of intervention required to interrupt transmission (Anderson and May, 1991), and about
the potential final size of the outbreak (Anderson and May, 1991; Ma and Earn, 2006).
We commend these researchers for their timely contribution and those who made the data
publicly available. However, it can be difficult to compare a disparate set of estimates of R0

from different research groups (as well as the associated degrees of uncertainty) when the
estimation methods and their underlying assumptions vary widely.
Here, we show that a wide range of approaches to estimating R0 can be understood and
compared in terms of estimates of three quantities: the exponential growth rate r, the mean
generation interval Ḡ, and the generation-interval dispersion κ. The generation interval,
defined as the interval between the time when an individual becomes infected and the time
when that individual infects another individual (Svensson, 2007), plays a key role in shaping
the relationship between r and R0 (Wearing et al., 2005; Roberts and Heesterbeek, 2007;
Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007; Park et al., 2019); therefore, estimates of R0 from different
models directly depend on their implicit assumptions about the generation-interval distribution and the exponential growth rate. Early in an epidemic, information is scarce and
there is inevitably a great deal of uncertainty surrounding both case reports (affecting the
estimates of the exponential growth rate) and contact tracing (affecting the estimates of the
generation-interval distribution). We suggest that disease modelers should make sure their
assumptions about these three quantities are clear and reasonable, and that estimates of
uncertainty in R0 should propagate error from all three sources (Elderd et al., 2006).
We compare seven disparate models published online between January 23–26, 2020 that
estimated R0 for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (Bedford et al., 2020; Imai et al., 2020; Liu et al.,
2020; Majumder and Mandl, 2020; Read et al., 2020a; Riou and Althaus, 2020a; Zhao et al.,
2020). We use a Bayesian multilevel model to construct pooled estimates for the three key
quantities: r, Ḡ, and κ; the pooled estimates reflect the uncertainties present in modeling
approaches and their underlying assumptions. We use these pooled estimates to illustrate
the importance of propagating different sources of error, particularly uncertainty in both the
growth rate and the generation interval. We also use our framework to tease apart which
assumptions of these different models led to their different estimates and confidence intervals.
Despite the availability of more recent and/or updated estimates of R0 , we restrict ourselves
to the estimates above in order to focus on the resolution of uncertainty in the earliest stages
of an epidemic.

Methods
Description of the studies

We gathered information on estimates of R0 and their assumptions about the underlying
generation-interval distributions from 7 articles that were published online between January
23–26, 2020 (Table 1). Five studies (Liu et al., 2020; Majumder and Mandl, 2020; Read
et al., 2020a; Riou and Althaus, 2020a; Zhao et al., 2020) were uploaded to pre-print servers
(bioRxiv, medRxiv, and SSRN); one report was posted on the web site of Imperial College
London (Imai et al., 2020); and one report was posted on nextstrain.org (Bedford et al.,
2020). Their modeling approaches vary widely: a branching process model (Bedford et al.,
2020; Imai et al., 2020; Riou and Althaus, 2020a), a deterministic Susceptible-ExposedInfected-Recovered (SEIR) model (Read et al., 2020a), an exponential growth model (Zhao
et al., 2020), a Poisson offspring distribution model (Liu et al., 2020), and the Incidence

studies estimated R0 by directly fitting their models to incidence data (Read et al., 2020a;
Zhao et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Majumder and Mandl, 2020). The remaining three
studies estimated R0 by comparing the predicted number of cases from their models with the
estimated number of total cases by January 18 (between 1,000 and 9,7000 (Imai et al., 2020))
Some of these studies have now been published in peer-reviewed journals (Riou and Althaus,
2020b; Zhao et al., 2020) or have been updated with better uncertainty quantification (Read
et al., 2020b).

2.2

Gamma approximation framework for linking r and R0

Early in an outbreak, R0 is difficult to estimate directly; instead, R0 is often inferred from the
exponential growth rate r, which can be estimated reliably from incidence data (Ma et al.,
2014). Given an estimate of the exponential growth rate r and an intrinsic generationinterval distribution g(τ ) (Champredon and Dushoff, 2015), the basic reproductive number
can be estimated via the Euler-Lotka equation (Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007):
Z
1/R0 = exp(−rτ )g(τ ) dτ.
(1)
In other words, estimates of R0 must depend on the assumptions about the exponential
growth rate r and the shape of the generation-interval distribution g(τ ).
Here, we use the gamma approximation framework (Park et al., 2019) to (i) characterize
the amount of uncertainty present in the exponential growth rates and the shape of the
generation-interval distribution and (ii) assess the degree to which these uncertainties affect
the estimate of R0 . Assuming that generation intervals follow a gamma distribution with
the mean Ḡ and the squared coefficient of variation κ, we have
1/κ
R0 = 1 + κrḠ
.

This equation demonstrates that a generation-interval distribution that has a larger mean
(higher Ḡ) or is less variable (lower κ) will give a higher estimate of R0 for the same value
of r (Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007).

2.3

Statistical framework

As most studies do not report their estimates of the exponential growth rate, we first recalculate the exponential growth rate that correspond to their model assumptions. We do
so by modeling reported distributions of the reproductive number R0 , the mean generation
interval Ḡ, and the generation-interval dispersion parameter κ with appropriate probability
distributions; we used gamma distributions to model values reported with confidence intervals and uniform distributions to model values reported with ranges. For example, Study 3
estimated R0 = 2.92 (95% CI: 2.28–3.67); we model this estimate as a gamma distribution
with a mean of 2.92 and a shape parameter of 67, which has a 95% probability of containing
a value between 2.28 and 3.67 (see Table 2 for a complete description). For each study i, we
construct a family of parameter sets by drawing 100,000 random samples from the probability distributions (Table 2) that represent the estimates of R0i and the assumed values of Ḡi
and κi and calculate the exponential growth rate ri via the inverse of Eq. 2:
Rκ0ii − 1
.
ri =
κi Ḡi

(3)

This allows us to approximate the probability distributions of the estimated exponential
growth rates by each study; uncertainties in the probability distributions that we calculate
for the estimated exponential growth rates will reflect the methods and assumptions that
the studies rely on.
We construct pooled estimates for each parameter (r, Ḡ, and κ) using a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach, which assumes that the parameters across different studies come
from the same gamma distribution. The pooled estimates, which are represented as probability distributions rather than point estimates, allow us to average across different modeling
approaches, while accounting for the uncertainties in the assumptions they make:
ri ∼ Gamma(mean = µr , shape = µ2r /σr2 ),
2
Ḡi ∼ Gamma(mean = µG , shape = µ2G /σG
),
2
2
κi ∼ Gamma(mean = µκ , shape = µκ /σκ ),

(4)

where µr , µG , µκ represent the pooled estimates, and σr , σG , and σκ represent between-study
standard deviations. We account for uncertainties associated with ri , Ḡi and κi (and their
correlations), by drawing a random set from the family of parameter sets for each study
at each Metropolis-Hastings step. Since the gamma distribution does not allow zeros, we
use κ = 0.02 instead for Study 7. We note that this approach does not account for nonindependence between the parameter estimates made by different modelers. As we add more
models, the pooled estimates can become sharper even when the models no longer add more
information. Thus, the pooled estimator should be interpreted with care.

Table 2: Probability distributions for R0 , Ḡ, and κ. We use these probability distributions to obtain a probability distribution for the exponential growth rate r. The gamma
distribution is parameterized by its mean and shape α. Constant values are fixed according
to Table 1. ∗ We do not account for this uncertainty during our recalculation of the exponential growth rate r because the reported estimate of R0 and its uncertainty assumes Ḡ = 8;
the original article reports three R0 (and 95% CIs) estimates using three different values
of Ḡ: 7.6 (MERS-like), 8 (average), and 8.4 (SARS-like). We still account for this uncertainty in our pooled estimates (µG ). † Study 6 uses the IDEA model (Fisman et al., 2013),
through which the authors effectively fit an exponential curve to the cumulative number of
confirmed cases without propagating any statistical uncertainty. Instead of modeling R0
with a probability distribution and recalculating r, we use r = 0.114 days−1 , which explains
all uncertainty in the reported R0 , when combined with the considered range of Ḡ.
We use weakly informative priors on hyperparameters:
µr ∼ Gamma(mean = 1 week−1 , shape = 2)
µG ∼ Gamma(mean = 1 week, shape = 2)
µκ ∼ Gamma(mean = 0.5, shape = 2)
(σr , σG , σκ ) ∼ half-normal(0, 10).

(5)

We followed recommendations outlined in Gelman et al. (2006), parameterizing the top-level
gamma distributions in terms of their means and standard deviations and imposing weakly
informative prior distributions on between-study standard deviations, i.e., half-normal(0, 10).
We had initially used gamma priors with small shape parameters (< 1) on between-study
shape parameters (= µ2 /σ 2 ) but found this put too much prior probability on large betweenstudy variances. This phenomenon is a known problem (Gelman et al., 2006). Alternative
choices of prior for the between-study shape parameters are also suboptimal: imposing strong
priors (e.g. half-t(µ = 0, σ = 1, ν = 4) assumes a priori that between-study variance is large,
while weak priors (e.g. half-Cauchy(0,5)) can lead to poor mixing.
We run 4 independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo chains each consisting of 500,000
burnin steps and 500,000 sampling steps. Posterior samples are thinned every 1000 steps.
Convergence is assessed by ensuring that the Gelman-Rubin statistic is below 1.01 for all
hyperparameters (Gelman et al., 1992); trace plots and marginal posterior distribution plots
are presented in Appendix. 95% confidence intervals are calculated by taking 2.5% and
97.5% quantiles from the marginal posterior distribution for each parameter.

Results

Fig. 1 compares the reported values of the exponential growth rate r, mean generation interval Ḡ, and the generation-interval dispersion κ from different studies with the pooled
estimates that we calculate from our multilevel model. We find that there is a large uncertainty associated with the underlying parameters; many models rely on stronger assumptions
that ignore these uncertainties. Surprisingly, no studies take into account how the variation
in generation intervals affects their estimates of R0 : all studies assumed fixed values for κ,
ranging from 0 to 1. Assuming fixed parameter values can lead to overly strong conclusions
(Elderd et al., 2006).
Fig. 2 shows how propagating uncertainty in different combinations would affect estimates
and CIs for R0 . For illustrative purposes, we use our pooled estimates, which may represent
a reasonable proxy for the state of knowledge as of January 23–26 (Fig. 2A). Comparing
the models that include only some sources of uncertainty to the “all” model, we see that
propagating error from the growth rate (which all but one of the studies reviewed did)
is absolutely crucial: the middle bar (“GI mean”), which lacks growth-rate uncertainty,
is relatively narrow. In this case, propagating error from the mean generation interval
has negligible effect compared to propagating the uncertainty in r. Uncertainty in the
generation-interval dispersion also has important effects as it determines the functional form
of the relationship between r and R0 (compare “growth rate + GI mean” with “all”). For
example, reducing the dispersion parameter κ from 1 (assuming exponentially distributed
generation intervals) to 0 (assuming fixed generation intervals) changes the r–R0 relationship
from linear to exponential, therefore increasing the sensitivity of R0 estimates to r and Ḡ.
As uncertainty associated with the exponential growth rate decreases, accounting for
uncertainties in generation intervals becomes even more important (Fig. 2B). Propagating
error only from the growth rate gives very narrow confidence intervals in this case. Likewise,

propagating errors from the growth rate and the mean generation interval gives wider but
still too narrow confidence intervals. We expect this hypothetical example to better reflect
more recent scenarios, as increased data availability will allow researchers to estimate r with
more certainty.

R0 under five scenarios that propagate different combinations of uncertainties (A) based on

our pooled estimate of the exponential growth rate (using (µr + 3 × median(µr ))/4, instead).

the joint posterior distributions of µr and µG while using a median estimate of µκ . all: R0

We also compare the estimates of R0 across different studies by replacing their values
of r, Ḡ, and κ with our pooled estimates (µr , µG , and µκ , respectively) one at a time
and recalculating the basic reproductive number R0 (Fig. 3). This procedure allows us to
assess the sensitivity of the estimates of R0 across appropriate ranges of uncertainties. We
find that incorporating uncertainties one at a time increases the width of the confidence
intervals in all but 7 cases. We estimate narrower confidence intervals for Study 3, Study 6,
and Study 7 when we account for proper uncertainties in the generation-interval dispersion
because they assume a narrow generation-interval distribution (compare “base” with “GI
variation”); when higher values of κ are used, their estimates of R0 become less sensitive to
the values of r and Ḡ, giving narrower confidence intervals. We estimate narrower confidence

intervals for Study 5 and Study 7 when we account for proper uncertainties in the mean
generation interval (compare “base” with “GI mean”) because the range of uncertainty in
the mean generation interval Ḡ they consider is much wider than the pooled range (Fig. 1).
Substituting the reported r or Ḡ from Study 1 with our pooled estimates give narrower
confidence intervals for similar reasons.
We find that accounting for uncertainties in the estimate of r has the largest effect on the
estimates of R0 in most cases (Fig. 3). For example, recalculating R0 for Study 7 by using
our pooled estimate of r gives R0 = 3.9 (95% CI: 2.3–8.6), which is much wider than the
uncertainty range they reported (2.0–3.1). There are two explanations for this result. First,
even though the exponential growth rate r and the mean generation interval Ḡ have identical
mathematical effects on R0 in our framework (Eq. 2 in Methods), r is more influential in
this case because it is associated with more uncertainty (Fig. 1). Second, assuming a fixed
generation interval (κ = 0) makes the estimate of R0 too sensitive to r and Ḡ. One exception
is Study 1: we find this estimate of R0 is most sensitive to generation-interval dispersion κ.
This is because Study 1 assumes an exponentially distributed generation interval (κ = 1):
estimates that rely on this assumption make R0 relatively insensitive and thus tend to have
particularly narrow confidence intervals.
Finally, we incorporate all uncertainties by using posterior samples for µr , µG , and µκ to
recalculate R0 and compare it with the reported R0 estimates. Our estimated R0 from the
pooled distribution has a median of 2.9 (95% CI: 2.1–4.5). While the point estimate of R0
is similar to other reported values from this date range, the confidence intervals are wider
than all but one study. This result does not imply that assumptions based on the pooled
estimate are too weak; we believe that this confidence interval more accurately reflects the
level of uncertainties present in the information that was available when these models were
fitted. In fact, because the pooled estimate does not account for overlap in data sources
used by the models, we feel that it is more likely to be over-confident than under-confident.
Our median estimate averages over the various studies, and therefore particular studies have
higher or lower median estimates. We note in particular that, while the baseline example
we used from Study 6 may appear to be an outlier, the authors of this study also explore
different scenarios involving changes in reporting rate over time, under which their estimates
of R0 are similar to other reported estimates. Here, our focus is on estimating uncertainty,
not on identifying potential explanations for these discrepancies.

Discussion

Estimating the basic reproductive number R0 is crucial for predicting the course of an outbreak and planning intervention strategies. Here, we use a gamma approximation (Park
et al., 2019) to decompose R0 estimates into three key quantities (r, Ḡ, and κ) and apply
a multilevel Bayesian framework to compare estimates of R0 for the novel coronavirus outbreak. Our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for uncertainties associated
with the underlying generation-interval distributions, including uncertainties in the amount

Figure 3: Sensitivity of the reported R0 estimates with respect to our pooled
estimates of the underlying parameters. We replace the reported parameter values
(growth rate r, GI mean Ḡ, and GI variation κ) with our corresponding pooled estimates
(µr , µG , and µκ ) one at a time and recalculate R0 (growth rate, GI mean, and GI
variation). The pooled estimate of R0 is calculated from the joint posterior distribution
of µr , µG , and µκ (all); this corresponds to replacing all reported parameter values with
our pooled estimates, which gives identical results across all studies. Horizontal dashed
lines represent the 95% confidence intervals of our pooled estimate of R0 . The reported
R0 estimates (base) have been adjusted to show the approximate 95% confidence interval
using the probability distributions that we defined if they had relied on different measures
for parameter uncertainties.
early estimates of R0 rely on strong assumptions.
Of the seven studies that we reviewed, two of them directly fit their models to cumulative
number of confirmed cases. This approach can be appealing because of its simplicity and
apparent robustness, but fitting a model to cumulative incidence instead of raw incidence
can both bias parameters and give overly narrow confidence intervals, if the resulting nonindependent error structures are not taken into account (Ma et al., 2014; King et al., 2015).
Naive fits to cumulative incidence data should therefore be avoided.
Many sources of noise affect real-world incidence data, including both dynamical, or
“process”, noise (randomness that directly or indirectly affects disease transmission); and
observation noise (randomness underlying how many of the true cases are reported). Disease
modelers face the choice of incorporating one or both of these in their data-fitting and

modeling steps. This is not always a serious problem, particularly if the goal is inferring
parameters rather than directly making forecasts (Ma et al., 2014). Modelers should however
be aware of the possibility that ignoring one kind of error can give overly narrow confidence
intervals (King et al., 2015; Taylor et al., 2016).
There are other important phenomena not covered by our simple framework. Examples that seem relevant to this outbreak include: changing reporting rates, reporting delays
(including the effects of weekends and holidays), and changing generation intervals. For
emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, there may be an early period of time when the
reporting rate is very low due to limited awareness or diagnostic resources; for example,
Zhao et al. (2020) (Study 6) demonstrated that estimates of R0 can change from 5.47 (95%
CI: 4.16–7.10) to 3.30 (95% CI: 2.73–3.96) when they assume 2-fold changes in the reporting
rate between January 17, when the official diagnostic guidelines were released (World Health
Organization, 2020b), and January 20. Delays between key epidemiological timings (e.g.,
infection, symptom onset, and detection) can also shift the shape of an observed epidemic
curve and, therefore, affect parameter estimates as well as predictions of the course of an
outbreak (Tariq et al., 2019). Even though a constant delay between infection and detection
may not affect the estimate of the growth rate, it can still affect the associated confidence
intervals. Finally, generation intervals can become shorter throughout an epidemic as intervention strategies, such as quarantine, can reduce the infectious period (Hethcote et al.,
2002). Accounting for these factors is crucial for making accurate inferences.
Here, we focused on the estimates of R0 that were published within a very short time
frame (January 23–26). During early phases of an outbreak, it is reasonable to assume
that the epidemic grows exponentially (Anderson and May, 1991). However, as the number
of susceptible individuals decreases, the epidemic will saturate, and estimates of r used
for R0 should account for the possibility that r is decreasing through time. Although our
analysis only reflects a snapshot of a fast-moving epidemic, we expect certain lessons to hold:
confidence intervals must combine different sources of uncertainty. In fact, as epidemics
progress and more data becomes available, it is likely that inferences about exponential
growth rate (and other epidemiological parameters) will become more precise; thus the risk
of over-confidence when uncertainty about the generation-interval distribution is neglected
will become greater.
We strongly emphasize the value of attention to accurate characterization of the transmission chains via contact tracing and better statistical frameworks for inferring generationinterval distributions from such data (Britton and Scalia Tomba, 2019). A combined effort
between public-health workers and modelers in this direction will be crucial for predicting
the course of an epidemic and controlling it. We also emphasize the value of transparency
from modelers. Model estimates during an outbreak, even in pre-prints, should include code
links and complete explanations. We suggest using methods based on open-source tools
allow for maximal reproducibility.
In summary, we have provided a basis for comparing exponential-growth based estimates
of R0 and its associated uncertainty in terms of three components: the exponential growth
rate, mean generation interval, and generation interval dispersion. We hope this framework
will help researchers understand and reconcile disparate estimates of disease transmission
