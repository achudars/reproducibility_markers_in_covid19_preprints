ABSTRACT
Objectives: To report our experiences screening and managing patients with
suspected

or

confirmed novel coronavirus

(COVID-19)

disease

using

a

hospital-specific protocol.
Design: Longitudinal cohort study.
Setting: A 1,200 bed tertiary care teaching hospital in Chengdu, Sichuan, China.
Participants: 802 adults presenting to hospital with concerns of having COVID-19,
1,246 inpatients and 2,531 hospital visitors.
Interventions: Screening and management of patients using a hospital-specific
protocol, which included fever triage, monitoring visitors and patients, emergency
response, personnel training for healthcare team members, health education for
patients and family, medical materials management, disinfection and wastes disposal
protocols.
Results: Between 23 January and 28 February 2020, 73 people were identified as
having fever plus respiratory signs with/without a history of exposure and were tested
for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by our
hospital lab using RT PCR. Forty-five of these 73 people were subsequently excluded
based on one negative RT PCR result plus positive results to quick screening tests for
flu or other respiratory viruses. The remaining 28 people received a second RT PCR
test 24 h later. Three people were confirmed positive for COVID-19 based on two
consecutive positive RT PCR tests whilst 25 people were excluded based on two
consecutive negative tests. The three COVID-19 confirmed cases received
non-critical care. There were no new infections of medical staff or new infections of
other hospital inpatients.
Conclusions: A hospital-specific protocol for screening and management is necessary
for reliably identifying suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during an outbreak.
All three cases were detected as a result of vigilant monitoring of hospital visitors.
Whilst screening out-patients presenting to a fever clinic remains important,
monitoring visitors must not be overlooked.

Strengths and limitations of this study

►We report a hospital-specific protocol used to screen and manage people presenting
to our hospital fever clinic, inpatients and visitors during an outbreak of novel
coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia in Chengdu, Sichuan province.

► Key components of the protocol included: a three-level fever triage process;

monitoring visitors and inpatients, formation of an emergency response team for
COVID-19, personnel training for healthcare team members, health education for
patients and family, medical materials management, and disinfection and wastes
disposal protocols.

► The ability to test nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 using RT PCR in the hospital

greatly shortened the time from the detection of patients to diagnosis, and was
beneficial to the control of the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2.

► Although our process detected few patients, comparison with other processes,

when they are published, will allow the identification of the optimal approach for
screening and management.

► We suggest that if all resources had been focused on screening people through our

fever clinic, we would have missed important in-hospital risks of transmitting
COVID-19: The detection of a hospital visitor with COVID-19 led to the detection of
an inpatient with COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province,
China in late 2019, and spread rapidly to over 110 countries and regions around the
world. On January 30, 2020, the epidemic was recognized as a public health
emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization, and was
officially declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The increasing number of cases and
deaths poses a major global public health challenge1 and has already brought a heavy
burden to the economy of the world.2
By February 28, 2020, a total of 78,959 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus
infection had been reported in China with an overall mortality rate of 3.53% (2,791
cases). 3 Of these, 13,052 cases were reported outside Hubei province, with an overall
mortality rate of 0.85% (111 cases). The reasons for the reduced mortality outside
Hubei province are unknown, however it is possible the causative virus, severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), loses pathogenicity due to
passage, it is possible primary care is now more appropriate than during the early
stages of the outbreak and it is also possible that screening for diagnosis and
management is more appropriate.4
During the outbreak in Sichuan province, we developed and implemented a
hospital-specific systematic process for screening, isolating and managing suspected
and confirmed COVID-19 patients. The purpose of this paper is to report the
effectiveness of this process.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and participants
We conducted a longitudinal cohort study of adults presenting to hospital with
concerns of having COVID-19, inpatients and hospital visitors between 23 January
and 28 February in Shang Jin Nan Fu Hospital, a tertiary care teaching hospital
located in Chengdu, Sichuan province. It has 1,200 patient beds, including 50
intensive care unit (ICU) bed spaces. Five ICU bed spaces are single rooms capable of
negative pressure filtration.
Interventions
Three-level fever triage
A three-level fever triage system was developed. The first level of fever triage
occurred at the main entrance of the emergency department and outpatient building.
The second level occurred at the nurse triage station in each clinic, and the third level
occurred in each clinical department, respectively. This triage system was expected to
avoid missing suspected cases through repeated temperature monitoring. Temperature
of every patient and his/her companion who presented to our hospital were assessed
by infrared thermometer (forehead or wrist) at each level of fever triage and the
epidemiological history was inquired in detail (Table 1).
Patients with "fever and respiratory disease" or "fever of unknown origin" were
guided to visit the fever clinic which was managed by the Emergency Department.
Doctors who have been trained were designated to organize the screening,
consultation, referral and reporting of suspected cases.
During the outbreak, the hospital reserved a transfer channel and elevator near the
prepared observational room. The channel and the elevator did not operate normally.
In case of suspected or confirmed cases, the dedicated channel and elevator were used

for transfer. Specially designated access for staff was opened to avoid cross infection.
Monitoring visitors
Visitors were strictly restricted. Each patient could only be accompanied by one
person, and each accompanying person must accept daily temperature monitoring and
report any symptoms of respiratory disease. Visitors were required to wear personal
protective equipment and follow hand hygiene rules. Visitors of ICU patients were
refused.
Emergency response
Once a fever patient with respiratory symptoms or a patient with fever of
unknown origin plus positive history of epidemiology was identified by the fever
clinic, the emergency response system was initiated immediately. Similarly, if any
clinical department within our hospital identified a fever patient with respiratory
symptoms or a patient with fever of unknown origin plus positive history of
epidemiology was identified, the emergency response system would be initiated.
In accordance with "Diagnosis and treatment guideline for novel coronavirus
pneumonia (Trial version 6)",3 routine blood test, chest radiography, quick screening
of swab or respiratory secretion (sputum, tracheal suction or bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid) for influenza A/B virus antigen (colloidal gold method, obtained results in 20
minutes) and 13 common respiratory viruses (nucleic acid test, obtained results in 8
hours) were completed in the observational room of the fever clinic or in the isolating
room of the clinical ward.
Experts in the consultation team, consisting of specialists in emergency medicine,
respiratory medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, infectious disease and intensive
care, were contacted to guide further examination and treatment. The radiological
department provided separate portable machines and staff for suspected patients and
initiated a priority channel to ensure rapid results and minimal contamination. The CT
room was equipped with a continuous air disinfector (AJ/YXD-III plasma air purifier,

China), making use of ultraviolet ray dynamic antivirus and ozone sterilization.
Clinically suspected patients were isolated immediately: 1) if identified by the
fever clinic, the patient was isolated in the observational room of fever clinic, and
then moved to a task-specific isolating room nearby; 2) if identified by a clinical
department, the patient was moved to a prepared isolating room.
The swab or respiratory secretion was collected for first SARS-CoV-2 testing in
our hospital lab using real-time fluorescence Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR) in all patients having a fever plus respiratory signs with/without a
history of exposure and meeting the criteria of suspected case (Table 2). The result
was obtained within 6 hours in our lab.
Patients were excluded from having COVID-19 based on one negative RT PCR
result plus positive results to quick screening tests for flu or other respiratory viruses,
negative routine blood test and radiography. Patients who could not be ruled out were
sampled by the District Center for Disease Control and Prevention (District CDC),
which conducted additional epidemiological investigations and collected additional
samples for double SARS-CoV-2 testing 24 h later. Patients' detailed information,
diagnosis, time of collecting samples, time of returning test report, specimen number,
test results and other information were recorded to provide evidence for the clinical
decision.
Patients were confirmed positive for COVID-19 based on two consecutive
positive RT PCR tests. Patients were excluded based on two consecutive negative test
results. The excluded patients were sent to the general outpatient clinic or ward for
routine treatment but were kept in isolation for at least 2 days, or discharged home for
self-isolation. If the patient’s condition changed, the screening procedure was initiated
again.
Confirmed non-critical patients were transferred to the local public health clinical
medical service center in a dedicated vehicle with a negative pressure filtration system.

The critically ill patients were transferred to the ICU with negative pressure filtration
until their condition became stable and suitable for transfer. See Table 2 for severity
classification criteria of COVID-19 pneumonia.
After onset of COVID-19, a patient was determined to be ‘recovered’ when all of
the following criteria were met: 1) Body temperature returned to normal for more than
three days; 2) Respiratory symptoms improved significantly; 3) Chest radiography
showed that the acute exudative lesions were significantly improved; 4) The RT PCR
test for SARS-CoV-2 was negative for two consecutive tests obtained at least 24 hours
apart. Once recovered, patients were discharged home for 14 days isolation or 14 days
isolation in a special quarantine facility.
Personnel training
At the beginning of the outbreak, staff training on COVID-19 pneumonia was
organized immediately. The main contents of the training were: knowledge of
characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia and pneumonia of unknown origin; skills in
collecting history of epidemiology; diagnostic criteria, principles of treatment and
requirements for reporting on outbreaks; skills of disinfection, isolation and personal
protection. All medical staff took standard preventive measures.5 Working clothes and
medical masks were worn during the medical activities and rounds. The requirement
of standard protection was wearing disposable preventive clothing or with protective
apron, disposable working cap, protective mask, goggles or screen, disposable latex
gloves, and shoe covers if necessary.
Health education
The nurses in the ward carried out health education for patients and companions,
including personal protection, timely reporting of respiratory symptoms, not
concealing epidemiological history, minimizing contact with others, correctly
implementing coughing etiquette and hand hygiene.

Medical material management
In order to solve the shortage of medical equipment, such as surgical masks, face
shields, N95 masks, protective clothing and goggles, etc., the hospital distributed
them to each department according to their needs. All medical materials were
supervised by specially-assigned personnel.
Disinfection and wastes disposal
The medical devices, surface of the items and ground were disinfected daily with
disinfectant containing chlorine 500-2000 mg/L or 75% alcohol in the fever clinic and
the room with suspected or confirmed case. All wastes generated from suspected or
confirmed cases were marked with "COVID-19" and treated as infectious wastes.

RESULTS
Between 23 January and 28 February 2020, 802 people presented to the
hospital’s fever clinic. In addition, 1,246 inpatients and 2,531 visitors were screened
for signs of COVID-19. Seventy-three people were identified as having respiratory
signs plus fever with/without a history of exposure and therefore qualified for testing
for SARS-CoV-2 by our hospital lab using RT PCR.
Forty-five of these 73 patients were subsequently excluded from having
COVID-19 based on one negative RT PCR result plus positive results to quick
screening tests for flu or other respiratory viruses. The remaining 28 patients were
sampled 24 h later for a second RT PCR test. Three patients were confirmed positive
for COVID-19 based on two consecutive positive RT PCR tests whilst 25 patients
were excluded based on two consecutive negative test results.
Of the three confirmed cases, one was a female visitor in her late 40`s who had
no clear history of epidemiology but was identified as having cough. She was
immediately sent to the fever clinic and was identified as having a fever. Through our
emergency response system, she was quickly sampled for screening and confirmed
COVID-19 after two consecutive positive SARS-CoV-2 tests. As a result of contact
tracing, the female inpatient she visited and one male relative were subsequently
confirmed positive for COVID-19 based on two positive RT PCR tests. These three
COVID-19 confirmed patients were sent to the public health clinical service center for
non-critical care. The male patient has been discharged after repeated negative
SARS-CoV-2 testing, whilst the two female patients have not yet met discharge
criteria and remained hospitalized at the end of the study follow-up period (28
February 2020).
There were no new infections of medical staff and no new infections of other
inpatients in our hospital during this study period.

DISCUSSION
Between 23 January and 28 February 2020, we screened 802 people presenting to
the hospital’s fever clinic, 1,246 inpatients and 2,531 visitors through our protocol.
Seven hundred and twenty-nine people identified as low risk and sent directly home.
Only three patients were confirmed positive for COVID-19 based on two consecutive
positive RT PCR tests, however, these patients were detected based on vigilant
screening of hospital visitors.
Interestingly, active screening of 802 people presenting to our hospital’s fever
clinic because they were concerned they had COVID-19 did not detect any confirmed
cases during this outbreak. If we had focused all resources on screening outpatients at
the fever clinic, we would have missed important in-hospital risks. We strongly
recommend that screening resources should focus on self-presenting patients, hospital
visitors and inpatients. Furthermore, the rapid establishment of the ability to test
nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 using RT PCR in our hospital greatly shortened
turn-around time and was beneficial in that it allowed early isolation and control of
high-risk patients and discharge of low-risk (negative) patients.
A hospital-specific protocol for screening and management is necessary if an
epidemic outbreak occurs. In the situation of an unanticipated surge of patients
combined with a relative shortage of medical resources (beds, staff and PPE), the
establishment of screening and diagnostic protocol for suspected patients can focus
medical resources on patients who need them and may help reduce missed cases.
We are unaware of any other papers documenting hospital screening processes for
COVID-19. Although our process detected few patients, comparison with other
processes, when they are published, perhaps will allow the identification of the
optimal approach for screening and management.
