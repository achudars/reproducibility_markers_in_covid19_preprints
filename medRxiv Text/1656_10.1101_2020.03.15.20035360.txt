Abstract
Background/introduction
COVID-19, a novel coronavirus outbreak starting in China, is now a rapidly
developing public health emergency of international concern. The clinical
spectrum of COVID-19 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with
severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. It has been
noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable
to more severe disease. However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that
most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic
review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive
of COVID-19 severity.
Method
This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. A literature search was
performed in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health) for studies
indexed up to 5th March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the
literature and both also completed data extraction. Quality appraisal of studies
was performed using the STROBE checklist. Random effects meta-analysis was
performed for selected symptoms and comorbidities to identify those most
associated with severe COVID-19 infection or ICU admission.
Results
Of the 2259 studies identified, 42 were selected after title and abstract analysis,
and 7 studies (including 1813 COVID-19 patients) were chosen for inclusion. The
ICU group were older (62.4 years) compared to the non-ICU group (46 years),
with a significantly higher proportion of males (67.2% vs. 57.1%, p=0.04).
Dyspnoea was the only significant symptom predictive for both severe disease
(pOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.83 – 7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28–
10.0). Notwithstanding the low prevalence of COPD in severe disease and ICUadmitted groups (4.5% and 9.7%, respectively), COPD was the most strongly
predictive comorbidity for both severe disease (pOR 6.42, 95% CI 2.44 – 16.9)
and ICU admission (pOR 17.8, 95% CI 6.56 – 48.2). Cardiovascular disease and

hypertension were also strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU
admission. Those with CVD and hypertension were 4.4 (95% CI 2.64 – 7.47) and
3.7 (95% CI 2.22 – 5.99) times more likely to have an ICU admission respectively,
compared to patients without the comorbidity.
Conclusions
Dyspnoea was the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and
ICU admission, and could be useful in guiding clinical management decisions
early in the course of illness. When looking at ICU-admitted patients, who
represent the more severe end of the spectrum of clinical severity, COPD patients
are particularly vulnerable, and those with cardiovascular disease and
hypertension are also at a high-risk of severe illness. To aid clinical assessment,
risk stratification, efficient resource allocation, and targeted public health
interventions, future research must aim to further define those at high-risk of
severe illness with COVID-19.

Introduction
The ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is a public health
emergency of international concern (PHEIC), involving a novel type of
coronavirus originally identified in Wuhan, China. At the time of writing, there
have been 105,586 confirmed cases around the world with 3,584 deaths (1).
Defining the spectrum of clinical manifestations and the risk factors for severe
COVID-19 infections has been identified as an urgent research priority (2,3).
As the virus spreads globally it is likely that government strategies will shift from
containment and delay towards mitigation (4). This will involve rapidly scaling
up healthcare resources including staff, equipment, facilities, and training, to
effectively identify and treat patients. To maximise the use of these limited
resources it will be imperative that clinicians are able to triage COVID-19
patients likely to recover after a mild illness from those who are not. In order to
do this, a better understanding of the symptoms and comorbidities (which are
the first and most routinely collected components of patient data) related to
COVID-19 severity is required. This can improve patient outcomes through three
chief mechanisms: early clinical intervention in high-risk patients, designing
appropriate clinical pathways and risk prediction tools, and the efficient
allocation of scarce resources and expensive treatments. Further still, the early
identification of individuals more likely to deteriorate can help direct
appropriate public health actions to protect the vulnerable and prevent further
spread of infection.
A recent meta-analysis of symptoms in 50,466 COVID-19 patients from 10
studies found that fever and cough were the most common symptoms, with
89.1% and 72.2% experiencing these, respectively (5). It also found that the case
fatality rate (CFR) was 4.3%, but the association between individual patient
factors and severe infection was not investigated. Most reported cases have
occurred in adults (median age 59 years) (6). According to most recent US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance, risk factors for
severe illness are not yet clear, although older patients and those with chronic

medical conditions may be at higher risk. (7) The primary aim of this study is
therefore to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis, aggregating all
currently available data from published studies, of symptoms and comorbidities
predictive for severe illness with COVID-19.
Methodology
Retrieval of studies
This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. Identification of relevant
existing literature was performed by an online search in three databases:
MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health, for studies published from 1st January 2019
to 5th March 2020. The MESH headings (keywords) searched were ‘nCoV*’ or
‘coronavirus’ or ‘SARS-2-CoV’ or ‘COVID*’ and ‘symptom*’ or ‘clinical’ or ‘predict*’
or ‘characteristic*’ or ‘co-morbidit*’ or ‘comorbidit*’ or ‘condition*’. Two
reviewers (VG, JMY) independently screened the list of titles and abstracts, and
the full text of chosen manuscripts. Disagreements on which manuscripts to
include during both title and abstract screen, and the subsequent full-text analysis,
were discussed until a conclusion was reached. In addition to the
MEDLINE/EMBASE/Global Health search, citation tracking was used to identify
any remaining relevant published studies, though none were identified.
Unpublished studies were not retrieved due to uncertain data quality.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
All studies evaluating individual symptoms and comorbidities in predicting severe
infection (as measured by disease severity criteria, or ICU admission) were
included. All studies of any design, from any time since the outbreak started (in
December 2019) were eligible, except case reports of individual patients or
literature reviews. To avoid selection bias, no subjective quality criteria were
applied to the studies for inclusion. Exclusion criteria included: [1] studies of
exclusively paediatric or pregnant patients, due to the varying presentation of
COVID-19 in these groups, [2] insufficient data on symptoms/comorbidities on
admission in either severe or non-severe disease groups (or ICU and non-ICU

groups), [3] coronavirus strains other than COVID-19 and [4] studies not written
in English, because of practical limitations with translation.

Data Extraction
Two reviewers independently extracted data from the included studies for both
narrative synthesis and statistical analysis. From each study, various details
including the

study

population, investigated predictive symptoms

or

comorbidities, and the definitions used to measure outcomes, were extracted into
Microsoft excel. These details are presented by study in Table 1. The number of
patients in each study, both with and without each symptom or comorbidity, was
extracted for statistical analysis (described below).

Predictors and Outcomes
The symptoms or comorbidities presented were investigated in at least three
included studies. Where studies measured symptoms ambiguously (including
abdominal pain/diarrhea(8), myalgia/fatigue (9), and nausea/vomiting (10)), this
data was excluded. Some studies reported heart disease and stroke separately
(10-12). To allow comparability between studies for meta-analysis, these were
grouped into a single predictor (cardiovascular disease). One study was excluded
from the analysis of dyspnoea as a predictor of severity, as dyspnoea was part of
the definition for severity used by the authors (13).

For disease severity, the included studies varied in their differentiation of
patients’ disease status, with classifications of ‘mild, moderate, severe and critical’
(14), ‘ordinary and severe/critical’ (8), ‘common and severe’ (13), and ‘non-severe
and severe’, disease (10,12). The first outcome measure used was severe
(including both severe and critical cases) vs. non-severe disease. For ICU
admission, the included studies varied in their definition of ICU admission, with
classifications of ‘ICU, mechanical ventilation or death and non-ICU’ (10), and ‘ICU
and non-ICU’ (9,11). The second outcome measure used was ICU admission

(including ICU, mechanical ventilation or death, where data was grouped
together) vs. non-ICU admission.

Statistical Analysis
Patient numbers were aggregated across all included studies for each group
included in the meta-analysis. Gender was compared between groups using the
Chi2 test in STATA (15). This was not possible for age due to a lack of individuallevel data. The predictive value of symptoms and comorbidities for each of severe
disease and ICU admission was estimated with random effects meta-analysis in
STATA. Random effects models were used to account for between study
heterogeneity (16), which was estimated with Tau-squared. This provided a
pooled odds ratio (pOR), 95% confidence intervals, and a p-value, for each
symptom or comorbidity. A p-value of <0.05 was used as a marker for evidence of
significant association. Detailed forest plots of the predictive symptoms and
comorbidities common to both disease severity and ICU admission are illustrated
in the supplementary information file

Results
The PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 1) illustrates the process for selection of
papers in this study.
Literature search
The initial search on MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health produced 2259
results. After removing duplicates and applying exclusion criteria, there were 42
papers meeting our criteria from title and abstract analysis. On further review,
the majority of these studies did not compare proportions of patients with
symptoms or comorbidities between severe (or ICU admitted) and non-severe
disease (or non-ICU admitted) groups. The reasons for all study exclusions are
outlined in Figure 1. A total of seven studies were selected for inclusion.

Description of Included Studies
Table 1 shows details of all included studies including reported findings
pertaining to symptoms and comorbidities related to disease severity or ICU
admission. These 7 studies reported on a total of 1813 patients. All included
studies were retrospective cohort studies in design, conducted between
December 2019 and February 2020 in China, during the novel coronavirus
(SARS-2-CoV) outbreak. Guan et al (10) conducted the largest study with 1099
COVID-19 patients, whilst Huang et al (9) included 40 patients in their study. The
number of symptoms investigated varied from 5 in one study (13) to 14 in others
(10,11). The range of comorbidities investigated varied greatly with two studies
not including any (13,14) and one including 22 comorbidities (12).
Table 2 displays the median age and gender of severe and non-severe disease,
and ICU and non-ICU admitted, patients, after aggregating all studies. The
median age was 62.4 years for ICU admitted patients compared to 46 years for
non-ICU patients, and 49.4 years for severe compared to 41.7 years for nonsevere disease patients.
Quality of Included Studies
All 7 included studies were retrospective cohort studies, and were critically
appraised using the STROBE checklist (17). The 22 items on the STROBE
checklist were formulated into 47 individual indicators, against which each study
was marked. Figure 2 illustrates the proportion of included studies which met
each individual appraisal indicator. Each paper was assigned an overall quality
score based on the percentage of STROBE checklist criteria met (<55% = -, 5565% = +, >65% = ++), as outlined in Table 1.
Appraising with the STROBE checklist highlighted several major weaknesses in
the included studies. Firstly, there was no consistent definition on what
constituted severe disease. The WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 (18)
defined a severe case as tachypnoea (≥30 breaths/min) or oxygen saturation
≤93% at rest, or PaO2/FiO2<300mmHg. Critical cases were defined as

respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, or other organ failure
that requires intensive care. Although the above criteria were used in some
included studies, many defined only one out of severe and critical, with one (8)
using a definition for a single severe/critical cohort. One study reported both
severity and critical cases (10), using criteria set by the American Thoracic
Society to judge severity. Secondly, the time at which severity of disease was
determined was not always clear. Severity was assessed on admission in two
studies (10,12), whilst three studies did not specify when severity was assessed
(8,13,14). It is possible, therefore, that the non-severe group included patients
who went on to later develop severe disease. Thirdly, the time point at which
symptoms were measured varied from illness onset (via recall) (9,11-13) to
clinical presentation (10,14). In the study by Li et al, it was not clear when
symptoms were measured (8). Finally, no study specified how each individual
symptom or comorbidity was measured. For instance, it was unclear whether
fever was objectively measured, and if so, how or by whom. Studies may
therefore have been susceptible to measurement and reporting bias.

Meta-analysis
Tables 3 and 4 show the odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals and p-values for the
individual symptoms and comorbidities that were investigated in at least three of the
included studies, for both severe disease and ICU admission, respectively. A total of
seven symptoms were included in the model for severe disease and six for ICU
admission, as well as four comorbidities in both. The most prevalent symptoms in the
severe group were cough (70.5%), fever (64.1%) and fatigue (44.5%); in the ICU
group these were cough (67.2%), fever (62.9%) and dyspnoea (61.2%). The most
prevalent comorbidities in the severe group were hypertension (25.4%) and diabetes
(16.8%) and in the ICU group were hypertension (40.5%) and CVD (24.1%).
Although no more likely to be in the severe group, men were 1.55 times more likely
than women to be admitted to ICU (95% CI 1.02 – 2.36). Dyspnoea was the only
symptom significantly associated with both severe disease (pOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.83 –
7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28– 10.0), being more strongly
associated with the latter. Cough was associated with severe disease (pOR 1.63, 95%
CI 1.03 – 2.60), but not ICU admission. The remaining symptoms analysed were not
associated with either outcome. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
cardiovascular disease (CVD), and hypertension were the comorbidities significantly
predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission. The pORs for severe disease
were as follows: COPD (6.42, 95% CI 2.44- 16.9), CVD (2.70, 95% CI 1.52 – 4.80) and
hypertension (1.97, 95% CI 1.40 – 2.77). COPD, CVD and hypertension were more
strongly associated with ICU admission, compared with severe disease, with pORs of
17.8 (95% CI 6.56 – 48.2), 4.44 (95% CI 2.64 – 7.47), and 3.65 (95% CI 2.22 – 5.99),
respectively. In contrast, diabetes was not significantly associated with ICU
admission, although the Tau-squared value here was unusually high implying a high
level of heterogeneity between studies in this particular case.

Discussion
Key Findings
COVID-19 severity was not consistently defined across included studies. All
studies were of adequate quality considering the context, and two were of
relatively high quality. The ICU group were older (62.4 years) compared to the
non-ICU group (46 years), with a significantly higher proportion of males (67.2%
vs. 57.1%, p=0.04).
The most prevalent symptoms in the severe disease group were cough (70.5%),
fever (64.1%) and fatigue (44.5%), and in the ICU admission group were cough
(67.2%), fever (62.9%) and dyspnoea (61.2%). The most prevalent conditions in
the severe group were hypertension (25.4%) and diabetes (16.8%), and in the
ICU group were hypertension (40.5%) and CVD (24.1%). Males were 1.55 times
more likely (95% CI 1.02 - 2.36) to have an ICU admission. Dyspnoea was the
only symptom significantly associated with disease severity and ICU admission,
alongside various comorbidities (COPD, CVD and hypertension). All of these
factors were more strongly associated with ICU admission than disease severity.
Patients with dyspnoea were 6.6 times more likely to have an ICU admission
(95% CI 4.28– 10.0) compared to those without dyspnoea. Although COPD was
relatively uncommon, even in ICU patients, it was by far the most strongly
predictive comorbidity for ICU admission (pOR 17.8, 95%CI 6.56 – 48.2). Those
with CVD and hypertension were 4.4 (95% CI 2.64 – 7.47) and 3.7 (95% CI 2.22 –
5.99) times more likely to have an ICU admission respectively, compared to
patients without the comorbidity.
Building on existing knowledge
Consistent with Sun et al’s 2020 meta-analysis of symptoms in 50466 COVID-19
patients (5) and the WHO-China joint mission on COVID-19 (18), cough and fever
were the most common symptoms found in our analysis. The prevalence of
dyspnoea was not investigated in Sun’s meta-analysis, but we found it to be

relatively low, particularly in non-severe and non-ICU groups. The prevalence of
dyspnoea in the ICU group, however, was 67.2%, compared with 10.2% in the
non-ICU group. Whilst dyspnoea is not a particularly common symptom in
COVID-19 patients, its significant association with both severe disease and ICU
admission may help discriminate between severe and non-severe COVID-19
cases, when present.
The findings reported here are in keeping with current knowledge that the
elderly and those with comorbidities are more susceptible to severe infection.
(7) According to the Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 (18),
individuals at highest risk for severe disease and death include people with
underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
chronic respiratory disease and cancer. We demonstrate that various factors are
more strongly associated with ICU admission (representing the very severe end
of the disease severity spectrum) compared with less severe disease. This
emphasises the extent of the risk COVID-19 poses for patients with
comorbidities. The China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found
differing case fatality rates (CFRs) in their cohort of 72,314 COVID-19 cases for
those with: cardiovascular disease (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), chronic respiratory
disease (6.3%) and hypertension (6.0%)(19). Unlike the China CDC study (19)
that presented case fatality rates for different groups, our findings compare
those with particular comorbidities to those without, allowing us to estimate the
effect of a particular comorbidity on COVID-19 severity. Although we did not
investigate death (and included COPD rather than chronic respiratory disease),
our analysis similarly suggests that comorbidities are not uniform in terms of the
risk of severe COVID-19 disease. Despite being uncommon in our study
population, COPD was by far the strongest risk factor for COVID-19 severity,
followed by CVD and hypertension.
Limitations
The foremost limitation of this study was an inability to carry out a multivariable
analysis to account for the presence of several symptoms, comorbidities and

potential confounders. Although this outbreak has seen the evolution of linked
data and large datasets (19) which would be suitable for multivariable analysis,
these currently lack the quality of published data: there are large amounts of
missing data, a narrow range of collected variables, and uncertainty about data
collection methods and consistency. Our univariable analysis is therefore
valuable in evaluating specific individual symptoms and comorbidities predictive
for COVID-19 severity using high-quality evidence in the form of peer-reviewed
studies.
Secondly, the studies included here were all from China, so the generalisability of
findings to other countries and populations is not clear. The Chinese may differ
to other populations in terms of their health-seeking behaviour, symptom
reporting, prevalence of different comorbidities, as well as their access to high
quality health services. Nonetheless, given the current dearth of contextually
specific evidence available, our findings will help to inform future research and
actions in other countries as the outbreak develops.
Finally, it was not possible to account for the timing of presentation in the
statistical analysis. If a patient presented after many days of being symptomatic,
this may have affected disease severity, compared with an earlier clinical
presentation. However, this limitation does not apply to comorbidities, and Table
2 shows information from individual studies on median duration of symptoms
before admission, which appears similar between severe (or ICU) and nonsevere (or non-ICU) cases. It is therefore unlikely that this will have biased the
overall results.
Implications for clinical practice/public health
By identifying the symptoms and comorbidities predictive for more severe
disease, clinicians can better stratify the risk of individual patients, as early as
their initial contact with health services. This can lead to practical changes in
management, which can improve allocative efficiency as well as clinical
outcomes, through the consideration of more intensive environments of care

(e.g. high dependency unit), earlier on, for patients at highest risk of severe
infection. These can also be formalised within risk stratification tools to aid
clinical decision-making, such as the CURB65 tool for community-acquired
pneumonia (20). As the number of hospitalised COVID-19 cases continues to
increase, hospitals will increasingly need to ration limited resources and
improve clinical pathways to effectively prioritise patients with greatest clinical
need. This is important, as COVID-19 is already placing increased pressure on
ICUs, and anticipation of future demand, based on local population
characteristics, may enable more timely planning and resource mobilisation
(21). Identifying those at the highest risk will also facilitate better-informed
discussions between clinicians, patients and patients’ families about the
anticipated clinical trajectory, allowing more accurate and timely advance care
discussions to occur.
Identifying those at high-risk will aid the public health response in controlling
the spread of disease. Given the ubiquity of comorbidities in the elderly
population, and their increased susceptibility to severe COVID-19 infection (18),
knowledge on the differing prevalence and risk of various conditions may help to
focus and tailor public health efforts such as the screening of asymptomatic
individuals, risk communication, contact tracing, self-isolation and social
distancing. For instance, for COPD, which is less common in the general
population and very strongly associated with ICU admission, a more targeted
and intensive health protection strategy may be warranted, compared to other
conditions (such as hypertension) that are more difficult to target due to their
higher prevalence in the general population.
Furthermore, if it is found that severity of illness is related to infectivity, as is the
case in the closely related SARS-CoV, then identifying patients who may develop
severe illness can help guide precautions to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV2.
These include infection control decisions regarding the limited availability of
isolation rooms and personal protective equipment (PPE), particularly in more
resource-constrained settings. This will be of particular importance as the
outbreak develops, if the prevalence of hospitalised COVID-19 patients increases.

Implications for future research
Measurement tools used in studies should aim to objectively measure symptoms
where possible, and details on how and when symptoms were ascertained
should be made clear in all studies. There was also heterogeneity in the range of
symptoms and comorbidities recorded by different studies, and some studies
grouped various symptoms (8-10), limiting the utility of such data.
Studies investigating COVID-19 severity should avoid using subjective or selfreported criteria (such as dyspnoea) in the definition of severity, as in one study
included here (13). To ensure consistency between studies and comparability,
the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 definition of severe and critical cases
should be used. Furthermore, the distinction between cases that are severe and
critical should be clearly made in studies, to enable more accurate risk
stratification of the most unwell patients.
For future research on predictors of severity, research should aim to include
greater detail on specific conditions, including how well controlled chronic
conditions were before and during admission. If the severity of COVID-19 varies
according to the severity of underlying comorbidities, there may be a case for
optimising routine treatment for healthy, uninfected individuals, as a potential
public health action to mitigate risk. Multivariable analysis to identify which
groups of symptoms or comorbidities are most associated with severe or critical
disease will also be valuable.
Conclusions
The existing literature on COVID-19 fails to elucidate the specific symptoms and
comorbidities most predictive for severe COVID-19 cases. Our analysis finds that
dyspnoea is the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and
ICU admission, and could be a useful symptom to help guide clinical management
decisions early in the course of illness. The association between comorbidities

and severe disease is not homogenous. Whilst COPD, cardiovascular disease, and
hypertension were all associated with severity, COPD was the most strongly
predictive. When looking at ICU-admitted patients, who represent the more
severe end of the spectrum of clinical severity, the difference in effect sizes for
COPD and the other included comorbidities was large, suggesting COPD patients
are particularly vulnerable to critically severe disease. As the outbreak develops,
future research must aim to substantiate these findings by investigating factors
related to disease severity. This will aid clinical assessment, risk stratification,
and resource allocation, and allow public health interventions to be targeted at
the most vulnerable.
