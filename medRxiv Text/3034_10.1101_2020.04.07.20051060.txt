ABSTRACT
Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has continuous outbreaks around the world.
Lung is the main organ that be involved. There is a lack of clinical data on the respiratory sounds of
COVID-19 infected pneumonia, which includes invaluable information concerning physiology and
pathology. The medical resources are insufficient, which are now mainly supplied for the severe
patients. The development of a convenient and effective screening method for mild or asymptomatic
suspicious patients is highly demanded.
Methods: This is a retrospective case series study. 10 patients with positive results of nucleic acid
were enrolled in this study. Lung auscultation was performed by the same physician on admission
using a hand-held portable electronic stethoscope delivered in real time via Bluetooth. The recorded
audio was exported, and was analyzed by six physicians. Each physician individually described the
abnormal breathing sounds that he heard. The results were analyzed in combination with clinical
data. Signal analysis was used to quantitatively describe the most common abnormal respiratory
sounds.
Results: All patients were found abnormal breath sounds at least by 3 physicians, and one patient
by all physicians. Cackles, asymmetrical vocal resonance and indistinguishable murmurs are the
most common abnormal breath sounds. One asymptomatic patient was found vocal resonance, and
the result was correspondence with radiographic computed tomography. Signal analysis verified the
credibility of the above abnormal breath sounds.
Conclusions: This study describes respiratory sounds of patients with COVID-19, which fills up
for the lack of clinical data and provides a simple screening method for suspected patients.

Introduction:
The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan in January 2020, which has now
spread all over the world1,2. Respiratory droplets and close contacts are the main transmission routes
of COVID-193. Cough was the first symptom in 67.8% of COVID-19 infected patients4.
Currently, the identification of suspected patients is mainly based upon epidemiological data and
clinical symptoms. With the occurrence of pandemic, more and more patients without a clear
epidemiological history or typical clinical symptoms have been found. A more convenient and more
reliable method of identifying suspicious patients is urgently needed. The main laboratory
examination methods are nucleic acid testing and chest imaging5. But the former is a diagnostic test,
which may be priority to the suspected patients after primary screening. The latter is expensive and
difficult to obtain in most countries. At the same time, both of them need the interval time waiting
for results, which extends the time to take measures such as isolation.
Pulmonary auscultation6,7 is an important means to diagnose and treat pulmonary diseases in the
routine medical work, which can provide important physiological and/or pathological information.
However, various causes limited its application when faced with infectious diseases. Electronic
stethoscope can transmit auscultation data through Bluetooth in real-time8,9. It can break the status
quo of unable-auscultation caused by medical protective clothing without increasing the risk of
medical infection. This study intends to leverage a remote electronic stethoscope to collect the lung
auscultation characteristics of COVID-19 patients, which makes up the lack of existing COVID-19
clinical data. It also proposes to use remote equipment in screening and monitoring patients with
COVID-19, which is a safe and effective way to break the regional restrictions.
Methods
Data source
The case series with COVID-19 were from the Affiliated Nanping First Hospital of Fujian Medical
University (NPFH), located in Nanping, Fujian Province. NPFH was the designated hospital for
admission of COVID-19 infection patients in Nanping city, and set up the expert group for medical
treatment of COVID-19 (Conv-MG). Suspicious patients found by other medical units in Nanping
city after preliminary screening should be transferred to NPFH for treatment. All patients with NCIP
enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim guidance.
From January 29th to February 14th, the ConV-TG of NPFH used electronic stethoscopes to
auscultate the lungs of newly admitted patients with COVID-19 infection. On March 5, after all the
patients were discharged from the hospital, the clinical data and laboratory examination results of
the above patients were retrospectively analyzed, which included the pulmonary signs.
The study was approved by the ethics committee of NPFH (202002050). Oral permission was
obtained from patients before lung auscultation. All patients were informed prior to physical
examination. With the patient's oral consent, we gave them lung auscultation.
Electronic stethoscope, auscultation and recording method
The stethoscope utilizes Doctorgram stethoscope DES-I (GV concepts, USA), which is a Hand-held
portable Bluetooth electronic stethoscope. The stethoscope head is membrane-shaped and bellshaped, and the frequency range of receiving signals is 20Hz-2KHz, which is amplified for 24 times.
There is no separate filtering of cardiac and respiratory sounds. The signal is transmitted to the
software terminal of the mobile phone or computer in real time through Bluetooth. The number of
terminals is unlimited, and multiple doctors can be connected at the same time. The sound can be

stored by the lossless compression technology of FLAC, which can continue record for 30 s.
In this study, respiratory sound data were acquired on the day of patients were admitted to the NPFH.
All records were obtained with the subjects in a seated position. The order of auscultation starts
from the tip of the lung, from top to bottom. The anterior chest, lateral chest and back are
symmetrically examined from left to right. Tracheal breath sounds, bronchial breath sounds,
bronchoalveolar breath sounds and alveolar breath sounds were examined and collected respectively
(Figure S1.). Lastly, speech resonance is detected and left-to-right contrast is made. All breath
sounds of each patient were collected by the same physician in the isolation ward, to ensure the
stability of audios collected from different patients. The Conv-MG conducted multidisciplinary
treatment (MDT) by video equipment outside of the isolation ward.
The exported audio is preliminarily reviewed and checked by the doctor who collected the breath
sounds. To conduct auscultation inspection on the recording quality, sort and label the audio by the
corresponding auscultation position as well as the type of breath sound. Another data analyst used
audio editing software (Cool Edit Pro v. 2.0; Syntrillium Software Corporation, USA) to initially
edit the audio according to the previous label, and remove the audio with low quality. Exclusion
criteria include: audio with high background noise, short recording time (at least 2 complete
breathing sounds), and low breathing sound signal due to poor contacts or conduction.
Methods of auscultation recording analysis
The audio analysis was conducted by six respiratory specialists having 5 to 23 years of experience.
The six doctors are from five hospitals, including NPFH, the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yatsen University, Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, First Affiliated Hospital of
XiaMen University, and the Second Afficiated Hospital of Xiamen Medical College. There was no

communication between these physicians before and after auscultation. The content of auscultation
assessment includes breathing rate, intensity, and whether there were abnormal or additional breath
sounds. Each audio was played over and over again until the physician made a decision. All the
results of each physician were recorded in sheet, then summarized and normalized by two graduate
students who were blinded to patient information. The terminology proposed by the ad hoc
committee of the International Lung Sounds Association was used to agree on the respiratory sounds
described by six physicians.
In addition to the result judgments of respiratory doctors, the above audio is also graphically
displayed and quantitatively described by means of signal analysis using Matlab R2019, v9.6.0
(MathWorks, USA). The relationship between signal characteristics and time is intuitively
demonstrated by drawing waveform and time-frequency diagram. By observing the waveform of
breath sound, the duration of inhalation and breath as well as the intensity of sound can be
preliminarily understood. The main frequency range of normal and abnormal breath sounds can be
visualized by detecting the time-frequency chart. The background noise generated by the movement
between the patient and the stethoscope is a high energy artifact on the time-frequency graph, which
can be easily recognized in the image. The feature of normal respiratory sounds and pneumonic
respiratory sounds refer to APSP project10. The images were excluded from the analysis. Then the
corresponding spectrum diagram was drawn by fast Fourier transform (FFT), which can analyze the
signal strength of a particular frequency.
RT-PCR testing and chest radiographic computed tomography (CT) examination
Throat swabs were taken for each patient, and the samples were delivered to the designated detection
institution immediately after collection. The detection kit was COVID-19 RT-PCR Kit (Shanghai

ZJ Bio-tech, China), which target E gene, RdRp gene, and N gene. All patients underwent chest CT
examination after admission through a CT scanner (General Electric Company, USA). The scanning
range was from the level of the thoracic inlet to the level of the diaphragm. Lung window and
mediastinal window were collected, and the CT image characteristics of patients were analyzed by
two experienced imaging physicians on the workstation of picture archiving and communication
systems.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages, and continuous variables
were described using median, and distribution range. These statistical analyses were performed
using SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS Inc, USA).
Results
Characteristics of the patients
A total of 10 patients were included in this study, ranging in age from 30 to 82 years old, mostly
male (70%), all of whom had an epidemiological history of contact with suspected or confirmed
patients. The number of patients was limited since current situation was serious and it was safe to
detect the results through patients in one ward. The most common initial symptoms were similar to
recent studies, which included respiratory symptoms (6/10) or fever (1/10) with highest temperature
reaching 39.2â„ƒ. One patient was asymptomatic and had only transient fever during treatment, with
a maximum temperature of 37.5â„ƒ. Two other patients had the first symptoms of digestive system,
one of which was diarrhea and the other was abdominal discomfort. However, both patients
developed cough and fever successively before admission. Before admission to NPFH, all patients
were isolated and observed in regional primary medical institutions. All patients had at least one
nucleic acid test, and 7 patients had a positive test at the first time, the other 3 patients had a negative
test repeated the test after 24 hours. The median incubation period from primary symptoms to viral
test positive was 7 days (interquartile range 3-15 days). Once the nucleic acid test is found positive,
the patient was immediately transferred to COV-MG of NPFH for intensive treatment. Chest X-ray
or CT were detected before and after admission for each patient. Local or bilateral ground glass
shadows, infiltrating shadows or stromal changes were found in all patients' CT, of which 80%
patients accumulated bilateral lungs. Based on further examination which were done after admission,
three patients were diagnosed with severe type and seven patients were diagnosed as common type,
all of whom did not develop to comorbid conditions.
Respiratory sound features of COVID-19 infected patients
Common abnormal breath sounds include bronchial breathing (common in pneumonia or fibrosis),
stridor (indicating upper-airway obstruction), wheeze (typical signs of asthma), rhonchus (common
with airway narrowing caused by bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), cackles
(including fine cackles and coarse, can be earliest sign of disease, eg. interstitial lung fibrosis,
congestive heart failure, pneumonia, asbestosis, etc.), pleural friction rub (associated with pleural
related disease), squawk (associated with conditions affecting distal airways)6. After the preliminary
judgment of breath sounds collected from ten patients, two patients with poor recording quality were
excluded according to exclusion criterion. None of the patients had a history of chronic respiratory
disease, which may interference with auscultation results. Among the results of breath sounds
auscultation from six doctors, the types of abnormal breath sounds described by each doctor had
some differences. These were related to factors such as the auscultation habits of each doctor.

Among them, asymmetric voice tremor and rales were the abnormal breath sounds that were easy
to detect. For each patient, only one or more abnormal breath sounds were described in each doctor's
auscultation results, in which the patient was recorded as abnormal breath sounds and the diagnosis
was positive. Based on the above method, 1 of the 8 patients was diagnosed with abnormal breath
sounds by 6 physicians at the same time. 2 patients were diagnosed by 5 physicians at the same time,
4 patients were diagnosed by 4 physicians at the same time, and only 1 patient was found to have
abnormal breath sounds by 3 physicians (Table 2).
The diagnosis results of respiratory sounds in the asymptomatic patients included cackles,
asymmetric vocal resonance, and abnormal vesicular breath sounds with murmurs. Asymmetric
vocal resonance with the highest diagnostic consistency amongst 6 physicians. We use signal
analysis to quantitatively describe this abnormal breath sound. After extracting the audio of bilateral
vocal resonance in the anterior chest (Figure 1.A-B), we drew the waveform and spectrum (Figure
1.C). It can be seen that the frequency distribution of breath sounds on both sides is similar, but the
left breath sound intensity significantly increases, which is consistent with the CT results (See
Figure 1. for more details).
Except for asymmetric vocal resonance, cackles were another common abnormal breath sound
according to the auscultation results (Table 2). We quantified the signature of one signal of cackles,
which was diagnosed by three physicians as a group, to validate the physiciansâ€™ auscultation results.
The feature of waveform and time-frequency graph (Figure 2.B-C) are consistent with previous
description concerning cackles features: duration <100ms, and the main frequency range is about
200-600Hz.
Discussion
The respiratory sounds of 10 patients with COVID-19 infection were recorded and analyzed by
electronic stethoscope in this research. Except for the two patients with poor audio quality, all other
patients were found to have abnormal breath sounds, including cackles, unable to classified
murmurs, abnormal vesicular breath sounds, enhanced or weakened voice resonance. Recent
pathological studies indicated that the lungs of patients with COVID-19 presented different degrees
of consolidation11,12. The imaging examination results suggested that multiple pulmonary plaques,
ground glass shadows and infiltrating shadows were the main manifestations of COVID-19 patients,
and in severe cases, lung consolidation occurred4,13. The auscultation results of patients with
COVID-19 infected pneumonia was concordant with the pathological and imaging results, which
indicated that the pulmonary signs of patients infected with COVID-19 were not specific compared
with other pulmonary inflammation.
However, auscultation can be used as a simple monitoring and screening method to effectively
obtain the physiological and pathological information of patients, and no other clinical procedure
matches auscultation, providing clinical information about the respiratory system quickly, easily,
and almost universally available methods. At present, the focus of pulmonary examination is on Xray or CT. However, the development of acoustic devices may provide an indirect-contact, credible,
repeatable way to monitor the patient's pulmonary lesions. With the above equipment, the physician
wearing protective clothing can collect the lung sound of patient infected COVID-19 without
increasing the potential infection rate of his own, and analyze the stored lung sound just as any other
clinical information is measured and stored. Existing electronic stethoscopes can already be
combined with remote diagnosis and treatment, and automatically detect abnormal respiratory

sounds through machine learning9. Using this technology to screen patients infected with COVID19 can improve the recognition rate of infected patient without bringing additional pressure on the
use of medical resources.
Another remarkable output is the positive auscultation results of two atypical patients and one
asymptomatic patient, which are consistent with the chest CT findings of these patients. Recently,
mild or asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 infections attract more attentions14. A report based
on the passengers of Diamond Princess cruise ship indicate that 4 of the 13 evacuees were
asymptomatic patients with positive nucleic acid15. Another study found that 56 percent infected
children had mild or asymptomatic symptoms16. However, these patients showed no reduction in
the ability to transmit the virus comparing to typical patients17. In the current global pandemic
situation, medical resources are scarce in all countries. At present, the initial screening of suspected
patients is mainly based on the exposure history of confirmed patients, and it is impossible to
conduct large-scale nucleic acid testing or chest imaging screening. However, with the exponential
increase of cases, the disease surveillance capacity is limited, and the epidemiological history of
many populations is not clear. The accumulation of asymptomatic patients makes it even difficult
to control disease. Based on the results of our case-series research, the application of auscultation
with electronic stethoscope can make up the shortcomings of current screening methods so as to
effectively improve the recognition rate of suspicious patients.
At the same time, there are limitations in this study. Since the results of auscultation are mostly
based on personal experience, we did not perform statistical analysis such as the sensitivity,
specificity and other indicators of diagnostic test due to lacking effective gold standard. In addition,
this is a small observed research, and only the lung breath sounds of the patients are collected at the
time of admission. No follow-up research was conducted.
This investigation complements the existing clinical data of COVID-19, which provides a
convenient screening method. It is hoped that public health workers around the world will be able
to use electronic stethoscope to increase the detection rate of mild and asymptomatic patients, reduce
their own infection risk, and allow remote treatment to help fight the epidemic.

time are about 50ms. The main frequencies are between 150 and 600. Cackles: Crackles are short,
explosive, nonmusical sounds heard on inspiration and sometimes during expiration. The feature is duration<100ms,
frequency range is about 350Hz (Fine cackles) , or 650Hz (Coarse cackles)6, other studies have reported the rang is
100-1000 Hz8. The likey mechanism of crackles is the sudden inspiratory opening of small airways held closed by
