Abstract
Background: Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in
China, respiratory manifestations of the disease have been observed. However, as a
fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been
previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of
COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them.
Methods: We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and
hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19–81 years). We collected
information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features,
routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography,
electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes.

Results: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25%) patients:
tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction
(n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=30), and AMI (n=6). All the six AMI
patients were aged >60 years; five of them had two or more underlying comorbidities
(hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease). Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) severity was higher in the AMI
patients than in patients with non-definite AMI (p<0.001). All the AMI patients
required care in intensive care unit; of them, three died, two remain hospitalized.
Multivariate analyses showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, NCP severity, and
underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19
patients.

Introduction

The widespread outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19, previously
known as 2019-nCoV) in China is a big challenge for public health and medical care.
Since its first emergence in Wuhan city in late December 2019, COVID-19 has
already spread to 26 countries. As of March 02, 2020, there were over 87137
confirmed cases worldwide, with 2977 deaths.1 To date, several latest studies have
reported the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with 2019 novel
coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), including signs, symptoms, laboratory test results,
imaging features, therapeutic strategies and effects, and multiple organ dysfunction.2-5
Notably, acute myocardial injury (AMI), defined as troponin T-hypersensitivity
(TNT-HSST) serum levels > 99th percentile upper reference limit (>28 pg/ml) by the
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force for
myocardial infarction and non-myocardial infarction diseases,6 was detected in
approximately 7.2%–12% COVID-19 patients in previous studies.2-3 Furthermore,
both severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory
syndrome (MERS) have been linked to acute myocarditis, AMI, and rapid-onset heart
failure.7-9 Reportedly,2 nearly 40% of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19
have underlying comorbidities such as cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases.
Furthermore, among COVID-19 patients, those with underlying cardiovascular
diseases can be more severely affected and may have more adverse outcomes than
those without underlying diseases. Thus, undoubtedly, special medical attention
should be paid to COVID-19 patients with cardiac complications and underlying

cardiovascular diseases. On February 13, 2020, the ACC released an ACC Clinical
Bulletin titled “Cardiac Implications of Novel Wuhan Coronavirus (COVID-19)”10 for
addressing cardiac implications of this disease and offering early clinical guidance
given the current uncertainty over COVID-19. However, detailed clinical
characteristics of COVID-19 patients with cardiac involvement, especially those with
AMI, have not been investigated in detail. Thus, we aimed to describe the clinical
characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and to further determine the risk
factors for AMI in them.

Methods
Study population

The institutional ethics board of our institutes approved this study (No. 2020.43). We
retrospectively enrolled 53 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized
between January 02, 2020 and February 14, 2020. The patients were diagnosed and
classified according to the World Health Organization interim guidance.7 NCP types
were classified as mild, common, severe, and critically severe according to the
COVID-19 patient management guideline issued on February 8, 2020.11

Procedures

Data on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical signs and
symptoms, underlying comorbidities, complications, and treatment management (such

as antiviral or antibiotic therapy, respiratory support, continuous renal replacement
therapy, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) were collected from the
patients’ medical records. Laboratory test results including those of blood routine tests,
C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer tests, and blood gas analysis were recorded and
compared. The levels of cardiac injury markers including lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH), hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, myoglobin
(MYO), amino N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and TNT-HSST were
determined at admission. The AMI group was defined as patients with TNT-HSST
serum levels > 99th percentile upper reference limit (>28 pg/ml).6 The group with
cardiac marker abnormalities but non-definite AMI was defined as patients with
TNT-HSST serum levels < 28pg/ml but increase in the levels of any of the other
abovementioned cardiac markers. The group without cardiac marker abnormalities
comprised patients without elevation in the levels of any of the cardiac markers. Chest
computed tomography (CT) was performed on the day of admission. The period of
illness onset to admission was defined from the day when signs or symptoms were
first noticed to the day of admission. All enrolled patients underwent two-dimensional
echocardiography (2D echo) and electrocardiography (ECG) during hospitalization.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was identified according to the Berlin
definition12 and acute kidney injury (AKI) according to the Kidney Disease
Improving Global Outcomes definition.13

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 21.0 (Armonk, NY; Graphpad
version 7.00, San Diego, CA). Data were presented as median (interquartile range;
IQR) if non-normally distributed and as mean (standard deviation; SD) if normally
distributed. Categorical variables were presented as n (%). Kruskal–Wallis analysis,
Chi-square test, and one-way analysis of variance were used for multiple group
comparisons according to data characteristics. Bivariate correlation was calculated
using Pearson or Spearman method as appropriate to detect the potential risk factors
for AMI. In all analyses, two-tailed p-values of <0.05 were considered significant.

Results
Baseline data
The baseline data of the 53 COVID-19 patients are listed in Table 1. Of them, six
(11.32%) patients had AMI (all aged >60 years; median age, 78.5 years [IQR 60.5,
81.75]); 24 (45.38%) patients were defined as the cardiac marker abnormalities group
(6 [25%] aged >60 years; median age, 48.50 years old [IQR 37.00, 62.75]). Cardiac
markers of 23 (43.39%) patients were within the normal range (4 [17.39%] aged >60
years; median age, 40.00 years [IQR 23.00, 51.00]). There were no significant gender
differences among the three subgroups. Epidemiology of all the groups was similar
(all p>0.05), such as being a local resident, Wuhan residence exposure, and
COVID-19 exposure. No patients had direct Huanan seafood market exposure. No
exact epidemiological link was found between the first case and the later ones. Almost
all the patients’ first onset symptoms were fever (n=47, 88.68%) and dry cough (n=41,

77.36%). Furthermore, the mean systolic blood pressure of the AMI patients was
higher than those of the other two groups (p<0.001). Fifteen (28%) of all the patients
had tachycardia.
High occurrence of hypertension was detected in the AMI patients (total patients with
hypertension: n=8, 15.09%; AMI group: n=4, 66.67%; cardiac marker abnormalities
group: n=2, 8.33%; without cardiac marker abnormalities group: n=2, 8.69%;
p=0.001). Cardiovascular diseases were more frequently found in the AMI patients,
all of whom had coronary artery disease, with one having prior coronary artery bypass
grafting (total patients with cardiovascular disease: n=6, 11.32%; AMI group: n=4,
66.67%), compared with the groups with and without cardiac marker abnormalities
(p=0.001). Additionally, diabetes (n=8, 15.09%) and COPD (n=3, 5.6%) were found
in all the patients, with a higher tendency in the AMI group (diabetes: n=2 and COPD:
n=2) than in the other two groups (Figure 1). Notably, only the AMI patients had
more than two comorbidities (n=5).
Regarding CT or DR findings on admission, all the AMI patients and 21 (87.5%)
non-definite AMI patients with cardiac marker abnormalities had bilateral
multilobular and sub-segmental lung involvement; in the without cardiac marker
abnormalities group, bilateral lobes were affected in only 15 (65.22%) patients.

Laboratory tests
The laboratory test and blood gas analysis results are shown in Table S1 (see in
supplementary appendix). CRP levels of all the AMI patients were increased above

the normal range (0–5 mg/l) on admission and were higher than those of the other two
groups; however, CRP levels were also increased in some patients in the groups with
(n=9, 39.13%; CRP: median, 14.70 mg/ml [IQR 9.51, 24.53]) and without (n=4,
16.67%; CRP: median, 5.36 mg/ml [IQR 1.27,9.16]) cardiac marker abnormalities.
D-dimer levels on admission were increased in the AMI patients (median, 1.65 µg/ml
[IQR 1.23, 4.48]) and patients with abnormal cardiac markers (median, 0.79 µg/ml
[IQR 0.62, 0.93]) and were higher than those in patients with normal cardiac markers
(median, 0.55 µg/ml [IQR 0.46, 0.72]; p<0.001). Initial white blood cell counts of all
the patients were within the normal range (3.50–9.50 × 109/l). Initial lymphocyte
counts of five (83.33%) AMI patients were decreased below the normal range
(0.80–4.00 × 109/l); these counts were decreased in only nine (37.5%) and eight
(34.78%) patients with and without cardiac marker abnormalities, respectively.
Furthermore, red blood cell count, hemoglobin level, and platelet count of the AMI
group were lower than those of the other two groups (p<0.05); four (66.67%) AMI
patients had procalcitonin levels above the normal range (0–0.5 ng/ml).

Cardiac marker, echo, and ECG abnormalities
Over half (n=30, 56.6%) of the COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated cardiac marker
levels. Cardiac marker levels were higher in the AMI and non-definite AMI patients
than in those without cardiac marker abnormities (p<0.05; Figure S1 in
supplementary appendix). In the AMI group, cardiac marker levels continuously
increased in three patients who died, with the levels being extremely high on the day

of death (Figure S2 in supplementary appendix).
Meanwhile, there were some differences in echo and ECG findings (Table 2). Of all
the COVID-19 patients, 45.28% (n=24) patients exhibited echo abnormalities. Echo
abnormalities more frequently occurred in the AMI group and included left atrial
enlargement (n=2), left ventricular (LV) enlargement (n=2), LV diastolic dysfunction
(n=3), mitral valve regurgitation (n=2), triple valve regurgitation (n=1), and aortic
valve regurgitation (n=1). Three AMI patients had LV wall thickening. It is
noteworthy that non-definite AMI patients with cardiac marker abnormalities also had
high frequency of echo abnormalities (n=15, 62.50%), with 11(45.83%) of them
having more than two of the abovementioned echo abnormalities. The most frequent
echo abnormality in the cardiac marker abnormalities group was LV diastolic
dysfunction (n=14, 58.33%).
As shown in Table 3, 11 (20.75%) COIVD-19 patients had ECG abnormalities,
including all the AMI patients and five (20.83%) non-definite AMI patients with
cardiac marker abnormalities. Five of the AMI patients had more than two kinds of
ECG

abnormalities (n=2), and arrhythmia (n=3); furthermore, ST-T/Q curve abnormalities
(n=5, 20.83%) and arrhythmia (n=1, 4.27%) were the main abnormalities in patients
with cardiac marker abnormalities. None of the patients without cardiac marker
abnormalities exhibited ECG abnormalities.

Main management strategies, comorbid conditions, and clinical outcome data

Table 3 shows the main management strategies, comorbid conditions, and clinical
outcomes of all the COVID-19 patients. In the AMI group, in addition to antiviral and
antibiotic therapies, cardioprotective medications such as amiodarone and cedilla
were used by four patients to improve the cardiac function. However, the non-definite
AMI patients with and without cardiac markers abnormalities did not use
cardioprotective medication. All the 53 patients were administered nasal cannula
oxygen therapy during admission for respiratory support; non-invasive ventilation or
high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was performed for five AMI and three
non-definite AMI patients with cardiac marker abnormalities. Notably, in the AMI
group, invasive mechanical ventilation was used in three patients and ECMO in one
patient due to extremely severe ARDS.
ARDS occurred in all the six AMI patients and four non-definite AMI patients with
cardiac marker abnormalities. Hypoxemia was a common complication that affected
19 (35.85%) of the 53 study patients, with a significant difference in the number of
affected patients between the AMI (n=6, 100%) and non-definite AMI with cardiac
marker abnormalities (n=10, 41.67%) groups and the without cardiac marker
abnormalities group (n=3, 13.04%; p<0.001). Moreover, a total of five AMI patients
had AKI, and four of them used continuous renal replacement therapy.
Importantly, all the six AMI patients had critically severe NCP and needed care in
intensive care unit (ICU). However, half of the patients with cardiac marker
abnormalities (n=13, 54.17%) had the common NCP type, with only two (8.33%) of
them having critically severe NCP needing ICU care. Meanwhile, the majority of

patients (n=21, 91.30%) in the without cardiac marker abnormalities group had the
common NCP type (Figure 2). Regarding clinical outcomes, in the AMI group, three
patients died, two were still in admission, and one was discharged from hospital.
Conversely, a majority of non-definite AMI patients with (n=20, 83.33%) and without
(n=21, 91.30%) cardiac marker abnormalities were discharged, with no case of death.

Risk factors for AMI
To determine the risk factors for AMI in the COVID-19 patients, a bivariate analysis
of AMI occurrence with clinical data and laboratory findings was performed, showing
that age (r=0.456, p=0.001), CRP levels (r=0.483, p<0.001), NCP severity (r=0.540,
p<0.001), and presence of commodities (r=0.520, p<0.001) were associated with AMI
occurrence (all p<0.05). Further analysis (Table S2 in supplementary appendix)
demonstrated that increased CRP levels (OR, 1.186; 95CI% [1.047, 1.344]),
representing the inflammatory condition of the body, may be a risk factor for AMI in
COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients with more severe NCP type (OR, 2.896;
95CI% [1.266, 6.621]) may have a higher risk of AMI than other patients. It is worth
mentioning that the presence of comorbidities (OR, 4.336; 95CI% [1.11, 38.55]) may
be the most critical risk factor for AMI in COVID-19 patients.

Discussion

This is the first study to show that cardiac abnormalities including tachycardia (28%),
elevated myocardial enzyme levels (56.6%), cardiac dysfunction (37.7%), and even

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031591; this version posted March 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

AMI (11.3%) are common in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, AMI was detected in 6
of the 53 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. All the six patients had severe or critically
severe NCP and required ICU care. Of the six AMI patients, three died, two remained
hospitalized, and one was discharged. Notably, CRP levels, NCP severity, and
underlying comorbidities were the major risk factors for AMI in the COVID-19
patients. Interestingly, there were 24 (45%) COVID-19 patients with elevation in the
levels of one or more myocardial enzymes and markers of myocardial damage whose
features did not meet the strict definition of myocardial injury, with most of them
having the common NCP type and experiencing quick recovery; however, 58.33% of
these patients exhibited LV dysfunction on echo, and long-term outcomes should be
observed via follow-up in a future study.

Our study results suggest that the rates of cardiac complications were high in the
hospitalized COVID-19 patients, especially in patients with confirmed AMI from
among those who required ICU care. As shown in a recent report on 138 hospitalized
COVID-19 patients,2 16.7% of the patients developed arrhythmia and 7.2% developed
acute cardiac injury. In another series of 41 cases of hospitalized COVID-19 patients,
it has been reported that 5 (12%) patients were diagnosed with acute cardiac injury.2-5
Similar to the cardiovascular complications of COVID-19, those of SARS include
hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, systolic and diastolic dysfunctions, and sudden
death, with tachycardia particularly being the commonest condition persistent in
nearly 40% of patients during follow-up.14 Furthermore, MERS-induced myocarditis

and myocardial damage has been reported.15 However, case series reporting elevated
levels of myocardial enzymes and myocardial injury markers remain limited for
SARS and MERS. Notably, although only six patients had clinically confirmed AMI
based on strict inclusion criteria in our study, most patients had elevated levels of one
or more cardiac injury biomarkers and LV diastolic dysfunction. Although long-term
outcomes of COVID-19 patients with AMI need to be further validated, significantly
more clinical attention should be paid to avoid underdiagnosis because of classic
symptoms and because of the possible overshadowing of cardiac complications in the
context of coronavirus, as cautioned by the ACC Clinical Bulletin.16

To date, the underlying mechanisms of AMI and potential impacts in COVID-19
patients remain unknown. Clinically, the increased serum levels of proinflammatory
cytokines,

such

as

interleukin

(IL)-1β,

IL-6,

IL-12,

interferon-gamma,

interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, suggest that
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is
associated with cellular immune deficiency and coagulation activation.17 Thus, the
direct effects of the virus, cytokine storm induced by viral invasion, and sustained
inflammatory response are presumed to be the main pathophysiological mechanisms
underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, a case report showing pathological
findings from a severely infected COVID-19 patient revealed no obvious histological
changes in heart tissue; however, the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 infection might
not directly impair the heart is debatable because this finding was observed in only
one patient without AMI-related clinical evidences.18 Because the three patients in our

study who died all had extremely elevated cardiac marker levels, acute heart failure
may play a fatal role in multiple organ dysfunction and accelerate death. However,
further evidence is urgently needed to assess the mechanism of cardiac damage in
large-sample autopsy or biopsy studies. Previous studies have indicated that
SARS-CoV can mediate MI and damage associated with the downregulation of the
myocardial angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 system; this may be responsible for the
myocardial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with SARS, which
has also been detected in COVID-19 patients.19-22 Until now, the pathophysiology of
SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV has not been completely understood. Although
full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis has shown that SARS-CoV-2 is
similar to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, the pathophysiological mechanism of cardiac
infection or damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 needs to be further validated in future
studies.23

In our study, AMI usually occurred in COVID-19 patients with old age, underlying
comorbidities, severe or critically severe NCP, and ARDS. Among 44,672 patients
with confirmed COVID-19, as reported in the China CDC Weekly on Feb 11, 2020,
approximately 31.2% patients were aged >60 years. The overall case fatality rate was
2.3% (1,023 deaths); more importantly, the majority (81%) of deaths occurred in
patients aged ≥60 years or in those with underlying medical conditions.24 Similarly, in
our study, all the six AMI patients were aged >60 years and had one or more
underlying conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, COPD, and cardiovascular
diseases. As described in a retrospective study of 1,099 laboratory-confirmed cases,

approximately 25.2% of the patients had at least one underlying disorder, such as
hypertension and COPD, and an underlying disorder potentially acts as an important
risk factor for poor outcomes.25 We found that the severity of NCP was closely
correlated with the AMI occurrence. Meanwhile, ARDS was present in all the AMI
patients. ARDS, as a severe complication, occurred in approximately 19%–29% NCP
patients as per previous reports.2-5 Thus, we must understand the mechanisms of
heart–lung interactions in ARDS patients, particularly the right ventricle function
impairments caused by respiratory dysfunction.26 Logistic regression analysis
indicated that NCP severity was a risk factor for AMI in COVID-19 patients. Indeed,
the outcomes of these patients need to be further determined in long-term follow-up
studies.

Our study has some limitations. First, this is a modest-size case series of hospitalized
COVID-19 patients; more standardized data from a larger cohort would beneficial for
further determining the clinical characteristics. Second, our data showed the clinical
characteristics of AMI induced by COVID-19, including the clinical presentations,

levels, and cardiac dysfunction and enlargement. However, the tissue characteristics
in myocardial damage (i.e., edema, fibrosis, and microcirculation disorder) should be
further demonstrated via cardiac magnetic resonance imaging examination as far as
possible under the premise of controlling transmission. Finally, most of the
COVID-19 patients with AMI had severe or critically severe NCP and high fatality
rate, but long-term follow-up should be performed to determine adverse cardiac

events in the patients who could not be diagnosed with MI but had elevated levels of
one or more myocardial enzymes and myocardial injury markers.

In summary, we found that cardiovascular complications are common in COVID-19
patients and include tachycardia, elevated myocardial enzyme levels, cardiac
dysfunction, and even AMI. More importantly, CRP level elevation, NCP severity,
and underlying cardiovascular diseases are the major risk factors for AMI in these
patients.
