Abstract
From a cohort of 1352 consecutive patients admitted with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to Papa Giovanni XXIII
Hospital in Bergamo, Italy, between February and April 2020, we selected and studied 688 patients with arterial hypertension (254 deaths) to assess whether use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASIs) prior to hospital admission
affects mortality from Covid-19. Prior use of RASIs was associated with a lower mortality in the over-68 group of patients, whereas no evidence of a similar effect (whether protective or adverse) was found in the younger group. There
was positive relative excess due to a statistically significant (p =0.001) interaction between prior RASI exposure and
an age greater than 68 years, corresponding to a positive relative excess risk. Next we used the subgroup of 411 hypertensive patients older than 68 yrs to separately assess the effects prior use of two RASI drug subclasses, angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiogiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), by comparing these two exposures
with no exposure to RASIs. We found both prior use of ACEIs and prior use of ARBs to be associated with a lower
Covid-19 mortality, after adjusting for 32 medical history variables via propensity score matching. (OR ACEI = 0.57,
95%CI 0.36 to 0.91, p =0.018) (OR ARB = 0.49, 95%CI 0.29 to 0.82, p =0.006).

Introduction

O F I N T E R E S T H E R E is the impact of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor drugs on the consequences of coronavirus
disease (Covid-19). RAS inhibitor drugs (RASIs) represent a
mainstay treatment for hypertension certain cardiological conditions involved in a severe course of Covid-19.
A P O S S I B L E A DV E R S E E F F E C T of RASIs in Covid-19 patients is suggested by the following biological argument. A negative regulator of RAS, called the Angiotensin I Converting
Enzyme 2 (ACE2), has been found to act as a receptor for the
Covid-responsible virus (SARS-Cov-2) to enter the infected’s
cells and replicate1 . Evidence from animal studies suggests that
certain RASIs might upregulate ACE22 and, as a consequence,
help SARS-Cov-2 invade human cells. Most popular RASIs
are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), both of which are widely
used in the most Covid-19-vulnerable part of the population: the
elderly. The prospect of a Covid-19-vulnerable population making widespread use of drugs suspected to worsen that disease
cannot but raise deep concern.
T H E S E F E A R S H AV E B E E N T E M P E R E D B Y recent epidemiological studies showing no evidence of whatsoever effect of
RASIs on Covid-19 outcomes3 .

T H I S S C I E N T I F I C A DVA N C E has been possible thanks to
a correct use of data analysis methods. In contrast with most
previous studies in this area, we have recognized/assessed the
striking difference between the effect of RASI exposure in the
young vs the old Covid-19 populations, and allowed our effect
estimates to vary between age strata, for a reliable estimate of
the effect of RASIs in the older, and most vulnerable, stratum
of the Covid-19 population, with implications for public health
intervention and design of future studies in this area.

by a study by Fosboel and colleagues.4 In common with our
study, these authors investigate the effect of prior use of RASIs
in hypertensive Covid-19 patients. They obtain an adjusted hazard of death ratio estimate of 0.83 with a 95% confidence interval (0.67-1.03) that barely covers the null and a p-value of .09.
Their conclusion that "prior use of ACEI/ARBs was not significantly associated with COVID-19 diagnosis or mortality among
patients with hypertension" is rash. Had they taken age-related
effect modification into account, thereby avoiding effect dilution
due to inclusion of young patients, they would have probably
seen evidence of a statistically significant Covid-19-beneficial
effect of ACEI/ARBs in the older age.

Data

W E I N C L U D E D in our study all patients older than 18 years
with positive rhino-pharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 infection,
hospitalized for Covid-19 at Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital (a
tertiary hospital of 1080 beds located in Bergamo, the initial
epicenter of Italian Covid-19 storm), between February 23rd
and April 7th, 2020. Patient follow-up ended on May 5th, 2020.
Follow-up time had a median of 34 days and an Inter Quartile
Range (IQR) of 19 to 41.
O U R I N I T I A L S A M P L E included 1352 consecutive Covid-19
patients, diagnosed on the basis of the updated WHO interim
guidance5 . Information about the history and physical examination of patients hospitalized with Covid-19 was derived via chart
review by medical officers. Variables collected through standardized recording forms included age, sex, comorbidities, dates
of symptoms’ onset and hospital admission. Hypertension was
defined as having a diastolic blood pressure equal or greater than
90 mm Hg and/or a systolic blood pressure equal to or greater
than 140 mmHg and/or a history of antihypertensive medication use. Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection via
SARS-CoV-2 genome detection from nasal swab and respiratory
samples was obtained through two different molecular methods

Outcome

P R I M A RY E N D P O I N T was mortality from all-causes, either
occurring in-hospital or shortly after discharge.

Statistical analysis

N O S A M P L E - S I Z E C A L C U L AT I O N S were performed. Age
was dichotomized via median split as ≤68 or >68yrs, with
no attempt to optimize the divide6 . We shall hereafter use the
symbol 68+ as a shorthand for >68yrs. Analysis in this paper
focuses on hypertensive patients. Our exposure groups were:
prior RASIs-users, no-RASIs-use, prior ACEIs-users and prior
ARBs-users. Pairwise comparisons between these groups7 in
terms of mortality from Covid-19 were performed by using
propensity score matching methods8 to adjust for potential prehospitalisation confounders and logistic regression of the binary
survival outcome on the exposure variable.9 , 10

RAS I S E F F E C T D U E T O AG E by allowing our model of survival outcome to include an additional term for a possible interaction between the effect of RASIs and that of age. A significantly different value of this parameter from zero would represent evidence of the two effects interacting on a multiplicative
scale. Because interaction is more relevant to public health if
expressed on an additive scale11 , this paper presents evidence of
RASI × age interaction also in a relative excess risk (RER)
form12 after appropriate dichotomisation13 of the continuous
age variable (≤68 vs 68+). A positive RER is obtained where
there is a "target" age stratum where a real-world intervention in
favour of RASIs is likely to have greater impact than in remaining population.

In order to avoid Type I error inflation, we
used median age as the threshold without
attempting to optimise it.

In order to avoid excessive test multiplicity,
and consequent loss of power, not all the

signs of systematic missingness were detected. Obesity and
Smoking were excluded from analysis due to a percentage of
missing values in excess of 5%. Results from a subsidiary analysis restricted to the set of patients with complete information
about these two variables, and performed by including these in
the models, did not yield appreciably different results from the
main analysis.
TA B L E 1 C O M PA R E S the 486 patients on RASIs at admission
with the remaining 866. A total of 968 patients (71.6%) were
men; median age was 68 years (IQR: 58 to 77). RASI users
tended to be older (median age: 73 years vs 65 years) and had
an overall higher prevalence of comorbidities, eg. hypertension
(94.4% vs 26.5%), diabetes (30.0% vs 13.3%), chronic kidney
disease (11.2% vs 6.0%), previous myocardial infarction (15.1%
vs 6.6%), chronic heart failure (7.0% vs 3.2%), angina or previous cardiac revascularization (16.5% vs 7.7%), atrial fibrillation
(12.8% vs 8.0%) and vasculopathy (12.6% vs 6.7%). They were
also more frequently treated with diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, statins, anti-diabetics and antiplatelet
drugs.
TA B L E 2 illuminates a main point. As our attention shifts from
the whole population to the smaller stratum of hypertensives and
then, from within this stratum, to that of older hypertensives, a
protective effect of RASIs progressively emerges from a simple
scrutiny of raw counts. (Whole population: RASI 32% vs noRASI 24%; hypertensives of all ages: RASI 32% vs no-RASI
40%; 68+ hypertensives: RASI 40% vs no-RASI 58%).

MAIN RESULT 1: Age modifies RASI effect on Covid-19 outcome for
hypertensive patients.

T H E VA R I A B L E S I N TA B L E 1 (except for the survival outcome) were considered for construction of a propensity score
model for chronic use of RASIs. The model parameter estimates
were used to calculate RASI-propensity score for each sample
patient. Two subgroups of patients, RASI-exposed vs RASIfree, were created by matching them with respect to the score.
Based on the union of these two groups, we performed a logistic
regression of the binary survival outcome on the RASI-exposure
indicator, also allowing this indicator and the binary (<68 vs
68+) age indicator to interact in their effects on the outcome.
Effect of continuous age was modelled non-parametrically via
splines. There was significant (p=0.001) evidence of interaction,
corresponding to a RER of 0.19, signifying that older Covid-19
patients with hypertension gain more from prior exposure to
RASIs (OR=0.5, p=0.07) than their younger "colleagues".
MAIN RESULT 2: In an analysis of 68+ hypertensive Covid-19 patients,
both pre-hospital exposure to ARBs and pre-hospital exposure to ACEIs
were associated with a lower mortality, when compared with no exposure
to RASIs. Effect was statistically more significant in the ARB group.
8 patients with prior exposure to both ARBs and ACEIs were excluded.

statistics of Table 3 and by the analysis described in the following, where adjustment for confounders is made.

propensity score (see Table 4 for the propensity score used in the
ARBs vs no-RASIs comparison).

Covid-19 patients are cross-stratified by
outcome status (rows) and according as they
do not use RASIs (column 2), or use ACEIs

estimates. As we move from column 2 to 4,
we encounter a progressively lower crude
estimate of mortality.

within the stratum of 68+ hypertensives, was found to be significantly associated with a lower mortality (P = 0.018, OR= 0.57,

0.49, 95%CI 0.29 to 0.82), after adjusting for variability induced
by use of concomitant drugs and by pre-existing morbidities.

Table 5. This table presents ORs for the
ARB/no-ACEI and the ARB/no-ACEI
exposure groups (within the population of
68+ hypertensives), expressed relative to
the RASI-free group (which has been chosen
as reference). All the ORs are adjusted for
pre-hospitalization variables via propensityscore matching, as described in the main
text of this paper. Point estimate for the ORs
are accompanied by their corresponding
95% confidence intervals, in brackets. These
estimates are based on the reduced samples
sizes produced by the matching (120 per
exposure group in the assessment of ARB
vs RASI-free effect; 144 per exposure group
in the assessment of ARB vs RASI-free
effect. Both effects appear to be significantly
different from zero. ACEI effect appears
lower in magnitude (higher OR) than that of
ARBs, but not significantly so.

Figure 1. This figure allows a visual assessment of the degree of balancing achieved by the matching in our analyses of the effects of ARBs (two
plots in the left half of the figure) and of ACEIs (two plots in the right half) on mortality in the population of 68+ Covid-19 patients with arterial
hypertension. The figure contains four plots. Moving from left to right, plots 1 and 2 shows the estimated densities of the propensity score for ARB
use within the groups of ARB users (blue) and non-RASI users (pink), before (plot 1) and after (plot 2) the matching. The degree to which the
densities overlap is a good measure of group comparability. Hence the good overlap of our matched "ARB" and "no-RASI" groups in plot 2 reassures
us that a statistically significant difference in mortality between our matched "ARB" and "no-RASI" will represent unbiased evidence of an effect of
chronic use of RASIs on mortality in the studied population. Note from Plot 1 the unmatched exposure groups were not comparable. We conclude
that the matching has played a crucial role in creating conditions for a credible estimate of ARBs effect. Completely analogous remarks can be made
on the basis of plots 3 and 4 in relation with our assessment of the effect of pre-hospitalization exposure to ACEI on mortality in the population of
68+ Covid-19 patients with arterial hypertension.

Effect of post-admission RASIs discontinuation

after hospitalization. ACEI users were slightly more numerous than ARB users, and they exhibited a higher rate of posthospitalization drug continuation. According to Table 10, crude
mortality was higher in patients who had RASIs discontinued,

place through antagonism of the deleterious effects of Ang II.
Liu and colleagues17 report serum Ang II plasma levels in a
sample of twelve Covid-19 infected patients as being markedly
elevated and linearly associated with viral load and lung injury.
These findings support the hypothesis that elevated levels of
Ang II may foster acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
in Covid-19 patients, which would explain the protective role
of RASIs found in older Covid-19 patients. Additionally, in
vitro cells treatment with Ang II was found to enhance ACE2
ubiquitination also mediated by AT1R, ultimately stimulating
ACE2 lysosomal degradation18 . This might prevent interaction
of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 catalytic site. Noteworthily ARBs,
through AT1R antagonism, have been suggested as drugs able
to prevent virus/ACE2 interaction, such pathway representing a
putative mechanism by which ARBs, more than ACEIs, might
prevent SARS-CoV-2 cells entry19 . Indeed, our results point in
this direction.
I T C O U L D B E A R G U E D that beneficial effect of previous RASIs use, especially of ARBs, is related to higher ACE2 expression with aging20 . Thus, the older the patient the higher might
ACE2 expression be and, concordantly, the greater might the
RASIs beneficial effect in Covid-19 be. Finally, RASIs have antithrombotic properties that could further ameliorate the clinical
course of Covid-19, possibly by reducing the thromboembolic
complications associated with this disease21 .
U N L I K E P R E V I O U S W O R K S , the present study avoids a serious methodological missteps by taking a correct approach to
effect modification due to age, in such a way to avoid effect estimate dilution. Such a misstep might be a reason why results
from a number of previous studies point in the same direction as
ours without achieving nominal statistical significance, a notable
example being the study by Fosboel and colleagues22 .
T H E L A R G E , P O P U L AT I O N - BA S E D study by Mancia and
colleagues23 finds no evidence that ACEIs or ARBs affect risk
of Covid-19. This result does not exclude ours, and for more
than one reason. First, little detail is given in that paper about

databases with possibly incomplete information on comorbidities and drug use. More importantly, the outcome in Mancia’s
study is diagnosis of severe Covid-19, rather than mortality (see
Table 4 of the cited paper). In fact, of the four possible "coexisting conditions" that characterize individuals in their analysis
("respiratory disease", "cardiovascular disease", "kidney disease" and "cancer"), only the first turns out to to be characterized
by a significant effect according to that study.
O U R S T U DY WA S P O S S I B L E thanks to the fact that RASI
drug allocation in the general population did not follow a fixed
and uniform protocol based on the individual’s characteristics. In other words, primary care RASI prescription was relatively liberal. This is reflected by Figure 1, which shows that for
each ARB-exposed patient we could find a patient with similar
propensity score who had not used ARBs, for balanced comparison of the two treatment groups.
A N O P E N Q U E S T I O N I S W H E T H E R the protective effects
of RASIs are to be ascribed to their use before or to their use
after the individual becomes infected. Or perhaps to both timings. Resolving this argument is beyond the scope of the present
work. Under an observational regime, post-hospitalization administration of RASIs will be associated to prior exposure to the
same drug and it will depend on decisions involving unrecorded
information. Some authors concentrate on the effect of prior use
of RASIs on patient admission parameters that appear to predict a severe outcome, under the (hard to test) assumption that
those are causal parameters. Inference about the effect of postadmission therapeutic decisions should, ideally, be made via
randomized studies, although the following example illustrates
difficulties encountered by this approach. Just one problem being an ethical objection to randomizing assignment of a drug
when an observational study has shown that the drug is likely to
be beneficial.

sent a strong motivation to conduct a randomized clinical trial
(RCT) to assess the effect of continuing/discontinuing RASIs
in a patient hospitalized for Covid-19. One such trial has been
performed: the BRACE CORONA trial24 assesses the effect of
discontinuing RASIs on Covid-19 outcome. One problem with
RCTs in a climate of health care urgency is that they require
time. In order to circumvent this problem some studies fix a
short follow-up horizon: 30 days in BRACE CORONA. Such
a short time span may work only with a cohort of individuals
at very high risk of severe outcome, which was not the case in
BRACE CORONA. In fact BRACE CORONA, with a mortality
rate of only 2.7%, records only 9 deaths per study arm. In spite
of the low number of events, results from BRACE CORONA
show a tendency towards a survival advantage of ACEIs/ARBs
use. In the light of results from our study, it is not unreasonable
to conjecture that had BRACE CORONA restricted admission
to an old age stratum, or more in general to high risk patients,
their results would have been in accord with ours. Other consideration: it is difficult to imagine an RCT where the randomized exposure is prior or chronic use of a drug. In fact, BRACE
CORONA conditions on the patients having made chronic use
of RASIs, and randomizes them over temporary suspension of
the drug. Clearly the question addressed by BRACE CORONA
is not equivalent to asking about the effect of chronic exposure,
which is an interesting question in consideration of the possibility of these drugs acting via gradual and persisting structural
changes.
B Y P ROV I D I N G E V I D E N C E of a beneficial effect of both
ARBs and ACEIs, our study may be taken as suggesting that
future RCTs should shine a light on both these drug classes.

a limitation, this may be an element of strength of the study,
insofar as homogeneity of target population reduces potential
biases.
