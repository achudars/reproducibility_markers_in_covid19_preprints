Abstract
Objective: To compare the sex differences in the clinical findings among
patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Methods: We retrospectively collected data of 47 patients diagnosed as
severe type of COVID-19 from February 8 to 22, 2020, including demographics,
illness history, physical examination, laboratory test, management, and
compared differences between men and women.
Results: Of the 47 patients, 28 (59.6%) were men. The median age was 62
years, and 30 (63.8%) had comorbidities. The initial symptoms were mainly
fever (34 [72.3%]), cough (36 [76.6%]), myalgia (5 [10.6%]) and fatigue (7
[14.9%]). Procalcitonin level was higher in men than in women (0.08 vs.
0.04ng/ml, p=0.002). N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide increased in 16
(57.1%) men and 5 (26.3%) women (p=0.037). Five men (17.9%) had detected
positive influenza A antibody, but no women. During 2-week admission, 5
(17.9%) men and 1 (5.3%) woman were reclassified into the critical type due to
deterioration. Mortality was 3.6% in men and 0 in women respectively. Four
(21.1%) women and one man (3.6%) recovered and discharged from hospital.
Conclusion: Sex differences may exist in COVID-19 patients of severe type.
Men are likely to have more complicated clinical condition and worse
in-hospital outcomes as compared to women.
Key words: coronavirus, severe pneumonia, sex difference, outcome

Introduction
From December 2019, a pneumonia with unknown cause emerged in the
Huanan seafood wholesale market, Wuhan, Hubei province. On January 3,
2020, the first complete genome of the novel β genus coronaviruses was
identified in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from a patient[1],
which is different from the known 6 coronaviruses and named 2019 novel
coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by WHO[2]. Soon later, the novel virus has proved to
share more than 79% of same sequence with the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)[3]. Therefore, the virus is formally
designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
by the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses[4]. The disease caused by the virus is named as
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
In the following months, SARS-CoV-2 quickly spread throughout China and
even other countries[5-8]. However, the knowledge and understanding of the
COVID-19 are still limited. Generally, the disease could be classified into four
clinical types: mild, moderate, severe and critical pneumonia[9]. According
data released by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
on February 17, 2020, a total of 44,672 cases (61.8%) has been confirmed
COVID-19[10]. Among them, more than 80% are mild or moderate with
relatively good short-term prognosis due to self-limiting process. However,
6,168 (13.8%) cases belong to the severe type and is more likely to develop

Although

some

data

regarding

clinical

characteristics of COVID-19 has been recently revealed[5-7, 10, 11], those
focusing on patients with the severe type is scarce. Moreover, since
SARS-CoV-2 is highly homologous with prior SARS-CoV, it comes naturally
that they may have similar clinical features, such as highly contagious infection,
high lethality rate, and even sex differences[12].
In this study, we aim to compare clinical findings between men and women
with severe type of COVID-19, and hope to contribute to the prevention and
treatment.

Methods
Study population
We retrospectively collected data of 47 patients at Sino-French New Town
area Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, where was supported and charged by the
medical team of Beijing Hospital from February 8, 2020. Patients were all
diagnosed with COVID-19 and classified into severe pneumonia according to
the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Infected by Novel Coronavirus
(5th trial edition) pressed by the General Office of the National Health
Commission and the General Office of the National Administration of
Traditional Chinese Medicine[9]. This study was approved by the Ethics
Commission of Beijing Hospital.
Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 was done in four diﬀerent institutions:
the Chinese CDC, the Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Academy of
Military Medical Sciences, and Wuhan Institute of Virology and Chinese
Academy of Sciences. Throat-swab specimens from the upper respiratory tract
that were obtained from all patients at admission were collected for extracting
SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The protocol was the same as the document published
recently[6]. We also examined other respiratory viruses with real-time RT-PCR,
including influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H7N9), influenza B virus, respiratory
syncytial

virus,

parainfluenza

virus,

adenovirus,

SARS

coronavirus

(SARS-CoV), and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Sputum or endotracheal
aspirates were obtained at admission for the identification of possible

causative bacteria or fungi.
Severe pneumonia met at least one of the following criteria: 1) dyspnea,
respiratory frequency ≥ 30/minute, 2) blood oxygen saturation ≤93% at rest, 3)
PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤300. Critical pneumonia met at least one of the following
criteria: 1) respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation, 2) septic shock, 3)
transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) due to multiple organ failure.[9]

Data collection
We obtained demographic, illness history, physical examination, laboratory
test, management, and outcome data from patients’ medical records. Blood
oxygen saturation was measured after oxygen therapy. Clinical outcomes were
followed up by February 22, 2020.
Laboratory tests were conducted within 24 hours after admission, including a
complete blood count, procalcitonin, interleukin-6, Ferritin, hypersensitive
troponin I (hsTnI) and N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP).

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as median (IQR) and compared with the
Mann-Whitney U test; categorical variables were expressed as number (%)
and compared by χ² test or Fisher’s exact test between the men and women
groups. A two-sided α of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Statistical analyses were done using the SPSS software (version 23) for all

Results
From February 8 to February 11, 2020, 47 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
patients were classified as severe pneumonia at the area, 28 (59.6%) cases
were men. About 63.8% of patients had comorbidities. History of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was non-significant higher but
hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD) was lower in men than in
women. The initial symptoms were mainly fever, cough, myalgia and fatigue.
Three men and one woman had oxygen saturation below 93% after routine
nasal oxygen supply (Table 1).

Discussion
In this retrospective study, we analyzed data from 47 patients with
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 of severe type. Common symptoms were
similar between men and women, consistent with the recent research[6, 7, 11,
13]. Men were more likely to have prior COPD, develop secondary infections,
receive complicated treatments as well as experience worse in-hospital
outcomes, as compared to women.
During two-week treatment, men accounted for five of six patients (83.3%)
shifting from severe to critical type. On the other side, only one man (20.0%) in
five patients discharged from hospital. The similar phenomenon has also been
reported in prior SARS-CoV infection in 2003. Karlberg et al.[12] analyzed
1755 SARS cases and found that men had a significantly higher mortality than
women did (21.9% versus 13.2%, p < 0.0001). Leung et al.[14] showed that
male sex was independently associated with a greater risk for adverse events
in SARS patients. Interestingly, there is no clear evidence showing the sex
difference in prognosis of influenza[15-17]. It seems that the different
prognosis between men and women might be a feature for coronavirus
infections.
The reason for sex difference is unknown. Some studies suggested that
different outcomes between men and women could be explained by estrogen
which might protect females from worse outcomes after SARS-CoV
infection[12, 18]. Another possible explanation for this is that the prevalence of

malignancy was higher in males. Liang et al.[19] found that in severe
COVID-19 patients, those with cancer had poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
In addition, more men in our study were co-infected with bacteria or influenza
virus, which may somewhat result in high risk.
Rothberg et al.[20] reported that bacterial infection was a common pulmonary
complication of influenza. We found that positive influenza A antibody were
detected in 5 men patients but not in women. Otherwise a higher rate of
increased procalcitonin was also observed in men. These findings suggested
that men with severe COVID-19 is susceptible to secondary infections with
virus or bacteria, resulting in higher utilization rate of advanced antiviral
therapy and antibiotics. Chen et al.[11] observed that 71% of confirmed
COVID-19 patients used antibiotic treatment, but no comparison between men
and women. It will be clinically meaningful to further investigate why and which
type of influenza virus or bacteria are more likely to co-infect with SARS-CoV-2
in men.
Another, we observed that NTproBNP but not cTnI was higher in men,
suggesting more damage in heart function might exist in men after
SARS-CoV-2 infection. It was reported that women were associated with less
remodeling after cardiac injury, due to the protection of estrogens[21]. Our
findings imply that physicians should pay more attention to cardiac function in
men with severe COVID-19.

Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, it’s a study with small sample size,
confounding factors and selection bias are inevitable. Second, the available
data was limited in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Third,
observation period is too short to describe patients’ outcome accurately.

Conclusion
Sex differences may exist in COVID-19 patients with severe clinical condition.
Men probably have more complicated clinical status and worse in-hospital
outcomes as compared to women. Further studies with large sample size are
needed to verify our findings.
