Abstract
Presently, the world is infected by COVID 19 virus which has created an emergency for public
health. For controlling the spreading of the virus, we have to prepare for precaution and futuristic
calculation for infection spreading. The coronavirus affects the population of the world including
Inia. Here, we are the study the virus spreading rate on the Maharashtra state which is part of
India. We are predicting the infected people by the SIR model. SIR model is one of the most
effective models which can predict the spreading rate of the virus. We have validated the model
with the current spreading rate with this SIR model. This study will help to stop the epidemic
spreading because it is in the early stage in the Maharashtra region.

Introduction
A virus[1] is micro/nano meter in size which is reproduced inside the living cell of an organism.
Presently coronavirus is created a health emergency to the world population and became a
pandemic[2],[3],[4]. Initially, this virus is transferred from the bat animal to the human[5].
Further this virus shows the human to human transmission[6]. COVID 19 virus is spreading to
the people by the respiratory droplets and contact mode[7]. Previously there are several
mathematical models reported[8]. The SIR model is simple and effective model which can give
the prediction of different pandemic situation[9].
Here, we are studying the spreading effects of the COVID19 to the Maharashtra state. There are
28 states in India in which Maharashtra is one of them. This state has a total population of 11.42
crore which is ~8.5 % of the overall population of India. The first case was observed 9 march
2020 in Maharashtra [10] where the couple was returned from Dubai. In India, the first case was
observed on 30 January 2020[11]. At 12 march, world health organization (WHO) announce that
COVID 19 is outbreak of pandemic where the term used by disease experts when epidemics are
growing in multiple countries and continents at the same time[12]. In current situation, after 12
march corona virus cases are rapidly increase in India and there are several cases also observed
in the Maharashtra. This study explains the epidemic growth by using SIR Model for this state
which helps to control this epidemic.

Model description

Figure 1. Scheme for SIR model

A Susceptible infectious recovered (SIR) model[13],[8] is commonly used for dispersion of the
he
virus as shown in figure 1. This model based upon the population of susceptible S, infectious I,
recovered Re, N total Population, β Infected ratio, and γ Recovery ratio. The set of equation

The ratio of the infected ratio and recovery ration is known as reproduction ratio (R) .

Results and Discussions
In the results and discussion section, the present rate of the virus infection is studied. The

infected population is also predicted by the SIR model. The reproduction ratio parameter also

a very high compared to the country percentage (2.82 %). The blue line shows the recovery of

Where I represent the infected people and t represents the days.
The undercover area is covered by the black line which follows the equation 1. After that, if we
plot the graph up to the 15 April then the infected population will be ~3500. This predication is
followed a similar tend when there is no recovery and death of the population.
Figure 3 (b) shows the prediction of infected people by the SIR model which is represented by
the black line. The reproduction ratio for this curve is 2.66. Redline is representing the currently

recovery or death of the population which is increasing by time. Image 4 (b) shows the
reproduction ratio (R) effects to the infected people. The reproduction ratio is varied from 1.33 to
5 where infected population was increased in the high reproductive ratio. When susceptible are
high than infected people will be more as shown in Figure 4 (c)- (d) and corresponding infected
people at different reproduction ratio. During the lockdown, people will make the proper social
distancing which will reduce the spreading of infection.

Conclusion
The study explains the spreading of COVID 19 in the Maharashtra region which is part of India. In this
particular region, the effect of the virus is studied by the SIR model. The model predicted that the
maximum infected population will be almost ~ 3000 after 40 days at the peak point. After reaching the
peak point the recovery will be more and the virus infection will be high for R ~ 2.66. This study is
considered only 7000 population are migrating in the state which can be affected in the lockdown
condition. If the migrated population will increase which causes the increment of infection and infect the
population more. This can control by the lockdown situation only which is presently imposed by the
Governments to the people. There should be a global health community that unites to urgently avoid the
pandemic issues.
