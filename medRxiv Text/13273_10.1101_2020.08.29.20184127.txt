Abstract:

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic was particularly invasive in Italy during the period
between March and late April 2020 then decreased in both in the number of infections and in the seriousness
of the illness throughout the summer of 2020. In this discussion, we measure the severity of the disease by
the ratio of Intensive Care Units (ICU) spaces occupied by COVID-19 patients and the number of Active
Cases (AC) each month from April to October 2020. We also use the ratio of the number of Deaths (D) to
the number of Active Cases. What clearly emerges, from rigorous statistical analysis, is a progressive
decrease in both ratios until August, indicating progressive mitigation of the disease. This is particularly
evident when comparing March-April with July-August; during the summer period the two ratios became
roughly 18 times lower. We test such sharp decreases against possible bias in counting active cases and we
confirm their statistical significance. We then interpret such evidence in terms of the well-known seasonality
of the human immune system and the virus-inactivating effect of stronger UV rays in the summer. Both
ratios, however, increased again in October as ICU/AC began to increase in September 2020. These ratios
and the exponential growth of infections in October indicate that the virus - if not contained by strict
measures - will lead to unsustainable challenges for the Italian health system in the winter of 2020-2021 .

COVID-19 had devastating effects in the months of March-May 2020 in Europe. The CFR (Case
Fatality Ratio) in European countries (updated on May 26, 2020) reached peaks close to 19% in
France, about 16% in Belgium, and around 14% in Italy, UK and Hungary [1, 2]. In this paper, we
discuss the reasons for the high CFR in Italy and how these results could potentially be applied to
other European countries with very high CFR rates. The main cause, recently confirmed by
widespread randomized serological tests in Italy, was a gross underestimation of the true number
of infections during the peak of the pandemic. Recent studies indicate that the more accurate
number of infected people in Italy was around 1.5 million people, i.e. about six times the tested
confirmed cases [3]. With such a correction, the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR), which represents the
true lethality of this infection, drops to about 2.3. As occurred in Italy, it is likely that other
European countries experienced a higher infection rate than was understood at the time. Another
problem, experienced in the most severely impacted Italian region of Lombardy, was the nearNOTE: This preprint reports new research that has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to guide clinical practice.

collapse of the health infrastructure accompanied by crisis management errors during the infection
peak [2]. Lombardy had the highest CFR in Italy, at close to 20%. Other countries with very high
CFR likely had similar contexts. It is clearly evidenced that countries with a very strong health
system, like Germany, were characterised by much lower CFR [1]. Starting in May 2020, COVID-19
seemed to lose much of its severity in Italy. This was evident to medical staff through direct
experience with patients in the main hospitals and prompted active debates in Italy that were
reported in Italian media and international press agencies [4]. Such limited, clinical observations
raised political-social debates over the necessity of continued, strict containment measures. The
evolution of the infection transfers and consequent illnesses during the summer and after the
relaxation of the lockdown and other containment measures were far milder than expected by
epidemiological forecasts [5,6]. In this paper, we statistically analyse data of ICU occupancy rates
and deaths due to COVID-19 as related to the number of active cases from the end of March to
October 2020. When rigorously tested, the ratio of ICU occupation to active cases and the ratio of
deaths to active cases show significant shifts, thus indicating a change in the evolution of the illness
from spring to summer 2020. The likely implications of such changes are then interpreted and
discussed, taking into account the possible factors affecting the disease: weakening of the virus,
counting bias, and seasonal effects. The results and interpretations are then discussed in light of a
possible forecast of what kind of evolution we could expect in the coming months (Autumn-Winter
2020-2021). Finally, we discuss the implications of these observations in the Italian context for the
larger global context.

We study the global, clinical evolution of COVID-19 in Italy using data for ICU occupation
numbers, deaths, and active cases in different periods. As [2] point out, ICU numbers and deaths
are rather robust data whereas recording of active cases can be strongly biased by heterogeneous
testing practices, loss of asymptomatic cases, etc. Recently, the first results of a massive testing
campaign to randomly check the percentage of people expressing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were
released [3]. Such tests confirm, as first hypothesized by [2], that the number of infected people was
about six times larger than indicated by official tests, reaching about 1.5 million people (instead of
about 250,000 officially tested positive). In the following analyses, we first assume that such high
underestimation of active cases has been almost constant during the analysed period; then, we test
our results with respect to the maximum bias implied by such an underestimation. Data on active
cases, ICU occupation numbers, and deaths in Italy are from the Department of Italian Civil
Protection Repository [8]. Here, we report the time evolution of the ratio between the number of
people in ICU and the total number of ‘active’ cases (i.e., total less recovered and deaths, at that
time), indicated by ICU/AC.
In order to make our estimates more robust, we choose to consider another important and robust
indicator: the number of deaths. We therefore also use the ratio between the number of deaths and
the number of active cases, indicated as D/AC. In order to get more accurate estimates, we also
considered the average time lag from COVID-19 confirmation (the actual data on active infection
we have) and the ICU admission as from COVID-19 confirmation to death. According to Wilson et
al. (2020)[9] , the average time lag between infection confirmation and ICU admission is 6 days
whereas the average time lag between infection confirmation and death is 13 days. For this reason,
we shift the median day in which we compute the active cases to 6 days before the median day of
the ICU number computation; we accordingly shift the median day to compute the number of
deaths to 7 days after the ICU median day (so that there are 13 days between the days of active

cases computation and the corresponding days of deaths computation). As April 3, 2020 was the
day of maximum ICU occupation in Italy for COVID-19 cases we used the third day of each month,
from April to October, as the median day to consider ICU occupation numbers. The median days
for considering active cases and deaths are chosen accordingly with the described shifts: so that for
active cases we take the 27th or 28th of the month before (depending if it has 30 or 31 days), and for
deaths we take the 10th of each month considered. In order to obtain more robust estimates of the
various data, we choose to average the data during 7 days around each median day (considering
also 3 days before and 3 days after the median day). We then computed the two quantities ICU/AC and D/AC - as the respective averages for each month. The results, for months from April
to October, are reported in Table1 and Figure1.

The data in Figure 1 show the statistical uncertainties at 95% (2 standard deviations) and indicate
that both the ratios sharply decrease in May, and then progressively continue to decrease in the
summer months, with decreasing values clearly separated, well above the statistical uncertainty.
Another way to look at such change is to consider the ratios of ICU/AC and D/AC computed for
April to each one of the following months.
The computed values of such ratios are reported in Table 2, and shown in Fig.2.

(ICU/CA)April/(ICU/CA)August increases of a factor 17.6 and the relative ratio
(D/CA)April/(D/CA)August of a factor 16.7.
These increases are exceptionally marked. Assuming the problems of estimating the true number of
active cases are constant in time they unequivocally indicate that the illness became progressively
milder during the summer months. The next step, however, is to consider the maximum possible
bias due to heterogeneity in the counting procedures of infected people. As we said, we are now
aware of the massive underestimation of infection rates that occurred in Italy in the first months of
the pandemic; serological tests indicated six times more people infected than officially tested
positive [3]. Then, in order to compute the maximum bias such a fluctuating underestimation could
imply in our computations we assume that all of the underestimation occurred in the months of
March-April and that in the last summer months we succeeded in testing all COVID-19 positive
cases. Such an assumption divides the March-April ratios (ICU/AC and D/AC) by a factor six to test
the obtained values against the values computed for August (with data from July-August).
We then performed a rigorous test of hypothesis to determine if the observed increase of the ratios
in August, with respect to the ratios in April though decreased of a factor 6, is significant. We
applied the well-known Student’s test [9].
The Student’s test starts by assuming the following formula for the t-variable [9]:

where:  and  are the average values of ICU/AC (or D/AC) for April and August respectively,
and  and  are the respective variances as computed from the samples, n is the number of
samples. The number of degrees of freedom is 14-2=12 (14 is the cumulative number of the two
samples tested). In the assumption of the null hypothesis,  and  , the true average values of the
two samples are equal, and the value of the t-variable can be tested with respect to the Student’s
distribution. For our data, the values result t=9.2 for the ratios ICU/AC, and t=6.3 for the ratios
D/AC, which are both largely out of 99.99% probability limits for the Student’s distribution, out of
the smallest limits shown in the tables. So, we can very confidently assess that the decrease of the
ratios ICU/AC and D/AC, from April to August, is significant for both the variables, even if the
maximum bias due to infection counting procedures is assumed, with less than 0.01% probability of
being wrong.
After the summer months, however, both the ICU/AC and the D/AC ratios increase again. The
minimum value of the first ratio, ICU/AC=0.00334, has been reached in August. In September, the
ratio started to increase again, with a value ICU/AC=0.0049; in October, the increase continued,
reaching a value ICU/AC=0.0061. A similar increase after the summer is shown by the ratio D/AC;
differently from ICU/AC, however, the minimum value D/AC=0.00042 has been reached in
September, whereas in October the ratio increased to D/AC=0.00063.
Such an increase of both the indicators in October is well shown by the decrease of the relative
ratios April/October; the relative ICU/AC ratio from April to October decreased to 9.7, after in

September it had already decreased to 12.0. The relative D/AC ratio from April to October
decreased to 13.2, after in September it had reached the maximum value of 19.7.
Following this period, both indicators of the seriousness of the disease markedly decreased starting
in April 2020, reaching minimum values at the mid-end Summer (August for ICU/AC, September
for D/AC). Both then show increasing values in October 2020, with ICU/AC already increased in
September with respect to August. The number of deaths more sharply decreased, however,
reaching a minimum value in September, that was roughly 20 times smaller than in April.

Interpreting the very clear evidence that the disease became progressively less severe, particularly
in July-August, is not as simple as it would appear. The simplest explanation could be that the virus
itself, which is continuously mutating and adapting to the host [10], lost much of its lethality. With
COVID-19, however, we should consider that the severity of the disease is mostly determined by
the response of the human immune system [11]. The scientific literature currently provides no clear
evidence for the virus becoming substantially mutated and less aggressive. There is evidence for
some mutations which actually made the disease less severe [12, 13]; however, there is no indication
that such mutations currently have a large diffusion (or have increased compared to past months)
in order to significantly mitigate the disease. Hence, the hypothesis that the observed mitigation is
due to the large diffusion of a significant virus mutation lacks scientific basis. It is well known that
infectious diseases [14] as well as auto-immune diseases are characterized by an evident seasonality
[15, 16]. The main reason for this appears to be the seasonal variation of the human immune system
response, which has been assessed even in terms of gene expression [17]. In particular, during the
summer the immune system response is more effective and less inflammatory. It is proven that
during European winters the human immune system has a marked pro-inflammatory character,
with increased levels of soluble Il-6 receptor and C reactive protein [17]. An inflammatory response
by the immune system, with cytokine storms, has been recognised as the main factor leading to
lung and/or other organs failure and death [11].
While there is widespread evidence that almost all flu-like epidemics are strongly dampened
during the summer this is even more so in the case of COVID-19: in the acute phase, COVID-19
behaves like an autoimmune syndrome and so is particularly sensitive to the seasonality of the
immune response [15, 17]. Other researchers previously noted some seasonal/climate effects [18,
19]. In addition, it has been proven the summer sunlight rapidly inactivates Sars-Cov-2 [20].
The very striking mitigating effect of the summer is easily apparent, although in a partial way
considering only the number of infections, by Fig.3, which shows the very clear anti-correlation
between the daily number of infection and the intensity of the ultra-violet sunlight (maximum in
summer months) from March to mid-October 2020.

maximum UV intensity in the summer months.

The figure shows data on UV radiation intensity, as recorded at two Italian stations: one in northern
Italy (Aosta), the other, reported also in Fig.3b in comparison with the daily infection curves, in
Rome, central Italy.
It is important to highlight that other explanations, based on the possible bias due to
inhomogeneous counting and/or mean age of the infected people in the different periods, as often
claimed also on the basis of a relatively younger age inferred for recently recorded infections [22],
do not appear to be sufficient to explain the significant decrease of the ICU/AC and D/AC in the

summer months. In addition to our demonstration relative to the possible bias of inhomogeneous
counting, there is compelling evidence [23] that susceptibility to the virus for individuals older than
20 years is more than twice that of individuals who are younger. Such evidence makes it very
unlikely that only very young people in Italy were infected in the summer months and then they
did not spread the infection to the older members of the population. The most likely explanation of
the inferred lower mean age of infections is that - starting in the summer months - due to the large
increase of tests with respect to March-April, mostly asymptomatic cases are recorded [24], whereas
in March-April only symptomatic people (comprised mainly of older individuals) were tested.
Then, a very strong decrease of the seriousness of the disease in the summer months appears the
only realistic explanation of data. The inference that appears is also significant due to the large
disparity in the number of tests between the different periods. This is corroborated by the observed
increase of the ICU/AC and D/AC after the summer, as will be discussed in the following.

After the summer months, the two ratios: ICU/AC and D/AC started to increase again. The ICU/AC
ratio started to rise again in September and in October reached a value (0.0061) only slightly lower
than June (0.0075) but higher than September, August, and July. The D/AC ratio, on the other
hands, rose again only in October, reaching a value D/AC=0.00063, higher than September and
August, but lower than July.
It is important to stress that this increase of the two ratios after the summer further validates the
significance of the summer minima. The number of tests in Italy increased progressively from only
a few thousand in March to 160,000-180,000 [8, 25]. It is not possible to imagine a bias, due to the
number of tests, capable of explaining the new increase of the two ratios in October or in September
and October.
The conclusion that the epidemic was strongly mitigated by the summer appears very robust.
What we have described in the Italian case seems to also be able to explain the comparatively low
lethality of the virus in recent months observed even in countries experiencing a very large number
of infections. Countries like the USA, India, Brazil, and almost all the South American and North
African countries, in which epidemics are active, are experiencing much lower CFR (Case Fatality
Rates) compared to what European countries experienced in the spring of 2020 [1]. The rates in
Israel (CFR=0.8), Arab Emirates (CFR=0.38), or Qatar (CFR=0.17) are extremely low (John Hopkins
University, 2020 [26]). Except in a small number of cases, such as the forementioned, it is not
probable that non-European countries are recording the real number of infection cases with any
higher precision than the European countries. Our conclusions also validate previous observations
of COVID-19 worldwide that its evolution was better mitigated in countries characterized by
milder climate [18, 19, 26, 27].
The largely mitigated effect of COVID-19 epidemics in Italy during the summer, despite the acute
situation in the months of March-April [2], also strongly validates the Italian epidemic management
and lockdown strategy. We should note that just after the first reopening - in mid-May 2020 epidemiological studies predicted a very large increase in the number of infections, severe cases,

and deaths [5, 6]. Instead, despite the complete re-opening implemented on June 3, 2020, such dire
forecasts were proven inaccurate, confirming the appropriateness of the response and progression
from complete lockdown to gradual and then full re-opening.
A further confirmation of the summer mitigation effect comes from the observation of the time
behavior of the ICU and Hospitalizations, from late February to late October (Fig.4). In Fig.4a a
strong time decrease of the ratio between hospitalized people and active cases is evident, reaching
the value, at the end of October, of about 6%. Fig.4b shows the ratio between ICU and hospitalized
people, which shows a very clear minimum from the start of June to the start of September; in
September and October, this ratio is approaching 10%, from a minimum value of 5%. So, the actual
ratio of ICU versus active cases is around 0.6%.

However, the clear evidence for the summer mitigation also rises strong concerns about what we
could expect in the winter months. Fig.5 shows the trend of daily tested cases from August 15th to
October 23 , 2020. A very sharp increase is evident in the last weeks of that period. The exponential
extrapolations, ending at December 31st, were respectively computed as the best fit values for the
whole period (black curve) and for the period September 15th to October 23rd (red curve).

Both curves show dramatically high forecasts for the future months. In the best case, the number of
infections could rise to up to 100,000 per day; in the worst case, up to 800,000 infections per day
could be expected. Such values imply that the corresponding daily death rates could be projected at
maximum values of anywhere from 500 to 5000 deaths per day. An estimated 5% of COVIDinfected people need hospitalization and about 0.6% require the use of an ICU. This could imply
anywhere from 4,000 to 40,000 new hospitalizations per day and 600 to 5000 new ICU occupied per
day. The impact of such numbers on the Italian health system is unsustainable.
The actual trend must be decreased as soon as possible to avoid the complete collapse of the
hospital system. This requires urgent intensification of public health measures aimed to
significantly slow the epidemic.
4. Conclusions

We have described how the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy was significantly mitigated during the
summer months of 2020. Both the infection rate and the illness criticality appeared suppressed
during the summer. This is likely due to the seasonality of immune response, which is more
effective and less inflammatory in the summer, combined with the germicidal property of solar UV
rays. This effect was frequently misinterpreted by Italian media (and some doctors with direct
clinical experience) as a mitigation of the virus and associated illness itself. The subsequent increase
in ICU patients and deaths, beginning in September and October, confirm that such a mitigating
effect has ended along with the summer. As further confirmation, the daily infection numbers have
progressively increased starting from mid-August, with a very sharp acceleration since the end of
September. These results potentially explain the very low lethality observed in countries with long
lasting summer-like climate but also pose serious concerns for the late Autumn-Winter 2020-2021 in

temperate climate zones that experience winters. An exponential progression of the daily infection
number, which is indicated by the present data, will lead to unsustainable numbers and the
possible collapse of the Italian health system by the end of the winter of 2021. The severity of the
COVID crisis is rising in Italy as evidenced by data collected in September-October 2020.
Containment of the virus through a curtailing of new infections is vital, pressing, and the only
current solution at our disposal until a vaccine and/or monoclonal antibodies are made widely
available.
