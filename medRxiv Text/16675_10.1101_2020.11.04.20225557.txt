Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in late 2019
has spread globally, causing a pandemic of respiratory illness designated coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19). Robust blood biomarkers that reflect tissue damage are urgently needed to
better stratify and triage infected patients. Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to generate an
in-depth picture of the pulmonary transcriptional landscape of COVID-19 (10 patients),
pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza (5) and uninfected control patients (4). Host
transcriptomics showed a significant upregulation of genes associated with inflammation, type
I interferon production, coagulation and angiogenesis in the lungs of COVID-19 patients
compared to non-infected controls. SARS-CoV-2 was non-uniformly distributed in lungs with
few areas of high viral load and these were largely only associated with an increased type I
interferon response. A very limited number of genes were differentially expressed between the
lungs of influenza and COVID-19 patients. Specific interferon-associated genes (including
IFI27) were identified as candidate novel biomarkers for COVID-19 differentiating this
COVID-19 from influenza. Collectively, these data demonstrate that spatial transcriptomics is
a powerful tool to identify novel gene signatures within tissues, offering new insights into the
pathogenesis of SARS-COV-2 to aid in patient triage and treatment.

Introduction
Since its emergence in 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2
(SARS-CoV-2) has caused a broad spectrum of disease, ranging from asymptomatic infections
to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Despite a lower fatality rate than other related
coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible and to date has resulted in over >45M
infections and >1.19M deaths worldwide and rising1. COVID-19 is the clinical manifestation
of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ARDS develops in 42% of COVID-19 patients presenting with pneumonia and accounts for a
significant number of deaths associated with COVID-192,3. ARDS is a form of hypoxemic
respiratory failure defined by the presence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) commonly
associated with bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, pancreatitis or trauma. The pathogenesis of ARDS
is typically attributed to inflammatory injury to the alveolar-capillary membrane which leads
to pulmonary oedema and respiratory insufficiency. In response to injury, alveolar
macrophages orchestrate inflammation of the lung by recruiting neutrophils and circulating
macrophages to the site of injury leading to the death of alveolar epithelial cells and further
impairing lung function4. Severe COVID-19 is often also characterised by concurrent vascular
disease

and

coagulopathy.

This

includes

breakdown of

the

barrier,

oedema, endothelialitis and thrombosis. Thrombotic and microvascular complications are
frequently recorded in deceased patients, suggesting that vascular pathology is a major driver
of severe disease5. While these mechanisms contribute to disease progression, it is unclear
which mechanisms are the predominant factors in causing fatality. Biomarkers can be used to
delineate these separate underlying mechanisms thereby clarifying the association between

disease mechanism and fatality. Once validated, these biomarkers can also help stratify clinical
care for patients and guide management of those with severe disease.

Transcriptomic analysis of patient tissue offers a unique opportunity to understand the
pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, to define its short and long-term complications and to identify
reliable biomarkers to help triage patients. To date, the major search for clinical biomarkers,
including transcriptomic analyses on COVID-19 patient samples, have been performed on
whole blood. Blood samples from infected patients are highly accessible but it is not clear
whether blood parameters accurately reflect either the viral load or the level of tissue damage
that clinical treatments aim to control6. The lung is the primary site of viral replication, yet only
a limited number of transcriptomic studies have been performed on the lungs of COVID-19
patients. Such studies have used transcriptomic analyses on only a small patient cohort (1-2
patients)7,8 or relied on ‘bulk’ sequencing of whole lung tissue, where any insight into tissue
heterogeneity in this complex organ is lost

5,9,10

. In contrast, gene expression panels applied

directly on tissue sections take into account the spatial location of transcriptomic features and
are able to directly sample intra-organ heterogeneity. This provides a much deeper picture of
the cellular changes driven by viral infection, and is a powerful way to define the characteristics
of the host response to the virus and the spatial relationships between them. Indeed, preliminary
spatial transcriptomic analysis of COVID-19 patient lungs appears promising11. However, such
analyses require the application of advanced bioinformatics techniques to control for the
numerous potential confounders present in gene expression data sampled in such a complex
experimental design. In addition, there is a clear need to distinguish the host SARS-CoV-2
transcriptomic response (and associated spatial heterogeneity) from other infectious triggers of
ARDS such as influenza virus, which may be circulating concurrently with SARS-CoV-2. Bulk
sequencing data already suggests that these two infections can be distinguished by the strength

of the thrombotic and coagulant response in the lungs of COVID-19 patients5. This differential
analysis becomes even more pertinent as the Northern Hemisphere enters their annual influenza
season and there may be increased demand for biomarkers that can rapidly differentiate
influenza from COVID-19.

To address these questions, we investigated the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in lung tissue
using spatial transcriptomics approaches from rapid autopsy samples taken from 10 COVID19 patients, five 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza virus patients and four control
patient samples collected at a single institution. GeoMXTM Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP)
combined with bioinformatic modelling allowed deconvolution of individual variability from
viral and host factors. These data showed that viral load has a heterogenous impact within a
patient on the pulmonary transcriptomic response there is significant overlap in the gene
expression profiles between influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infected samples. However,
several unique transcriptomic signatures were detected in the lungs of COVID-19 patients. This
study demonstrates the strengths of spatial transcriptomics coupled with powerful linear
modelling bioinformatics modelling techniques to broadly identify key pathways involved in
viral infections and to clearly differentiate the involvement of distinct cellular and molecular
pathways in different infections.

Results
Patient Characteristics
Lung tissues were obtained by rapid autopsy from 10 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, five
pH1N1 influenza virus infected patients and four non-virally infected control patients. The
SARS-CoV-2 cohort was made up of four females and six males with mean age of 76 years
(ranging from 46-93 years). These patients exhibited multiple comorbidities including obesity,

diabetes and heart disease and had received varying treatment following hospital admission.
Patient survival after admission ranged from 8 to 38 days, with time on mechanical ventilation
ranging from 3 to 21 days (Extended Data Table 1). Blood profiling performed on admission
and again immediately prior to death showed elevated D-dimer levels for 7 of 10 patients
consistent with vascular coagulopathy (Extended Data Table 2).

The pH1N1 influenza virus patient cohort comprised five males with a mean age of 45.8 years
(ranging from 31-53 years). All patients had received mechanical ventilation from the time of
admission until death. The uninfected control cohort consisted of four males with a mean age
of 36.25 (1 ranging from 18-60 years) whose tissues were donated following death from nonviral and non-respiratory diseases (Extended Data Table 3).

Histopathological Characterisation
Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were prepared from pulmonary formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
cores of each of the three cohorts (one core per patient) and blinded histological examination
performed by a pathologist as shown in Extended Data Table 4. Acute phase diffuse alveolar
damage (DAD) characterised by hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia and
alveolar septal thickening was a prominent feature of SARS-CoV-2 cores. pH1N1 tissues also
showed features of DAD, with alveolar haemorrhage evident in two of the cores. These
findings were not seen in control cores. Fibrosis was not a prominent feature apart from one
SARS-CoV-2 core that exhibited moderate interstitial and alveolar fibrosis with concordant
histological organising pneumonia. Two pH1N1 cores showed mild interstitial fibrosis that
were characterised by acute phase or late organising phase DAD.

Transcriptional profiling of target cores was guided by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike
mRNA. Two cores (LN1 and LN3) exhibited strong signals for viral mRNA (Fig. 1a) and these
cores were comprehensively evaluated using the GeoMx DSP platform (shaded regions, Fig.
1b). Twenty-five regions of interest (ROIs) were selected from these two RNAscope® positive
cores and 21 ROIs were selected from remaining eight cores of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients
(minimum of one ROI per patient) for which viral mRNA was below detection by RNAscope.
Eight ROIs were selected from the lungs of five pH1N1 patients (minimum of one ROI per
patient), and five ROIs were selected from the lungs of control patients (minimum of one ROI
per patient).

SARS-CoV-2 RNAscope® abundance was semi-quantitatively assessed for each ROI.
Representative scoring criteria from 0 to 3 are shown in Extended Data Fig. 1 where positive
scores were allocated only to regions within LN1 and LN3 (Extended Data Table 5). In
addition, concordant spike protein immunohistochemistry (IHC) appeared to be specific for
type 2 pneumocytes and bronchiolar epithelial regions, however, some staining was also
observed within interstitial lymphocytes and alveolar macrophages (Extended Data Fig. 1).
Interestingly, spike protein IHC indicated virus in cores other than LN1 and LN3 (Extended
Data Table 5) that did not produce a detectable signal using RNAscope®. Low level nonspecific staining was observed in some regions of pH1N1 and control tissues Extended Data
Table 5. We thus focussed our ROI selection on cores that indicated high mRNA integrity and
viral detection by RNAscope®.

Histopathology and Dominant Features of ROIs
Assessment of histology by a pathologist allowed ROIs to be grouped by tissue architecture
prior to further analysis. The predominant cell types found within each ROI were annotated in

addition to scoring of their histopathology and spike protein IHC (Extended Data Table 5).
ROIs could be broadly categorised into regions dominated by bronchiolar epithelial structures,
type 2 pneumocytes, hyaline membranes and macrophages (Extended Data Fig. 2). Alveolar
oedema, acute inflammation and squamous metaplasia were not observed in diseased or control
cores, however, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia and capillary congestion were present in
SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary tissues.

Data normalization strategy and exploratory analysis of spatial transcriptomic data
The transcriptomic profile of the lungs of deceased patients was then examined using spatial
transcriptomics. Data was corrected for systematic bias to allow for comparisons between
SARS-CoV-2, pH1N1 influenza virus and control samples (Extended Data Fig. 3). Principal
components analysis (PCA) plots were then used to explore the variability in SARS-CoV-2,
pH1N1 influenza virus and control lung samples and to determine whether they could be
clearly separated simply based on the type of infecting pathogen and to identify factors that
might confound differential expression analysis. Principal components (PCs) capture
orthogonal dimensions of variability in the data in descending order of contribution. Noninfected samples clearly separate from other samples on PCs 1 and 3, but this was not the case
for SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 influenza samples (Fig. 2a). Indeed, across PCs 1-4 SARS-CoV2 and pH1N1 influenza samples were substantially overlapping. These data suggest that the
transcriptomic profile of SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 influenza virus tissues were not highly
variable at low viral load, and that a common transcriptome was induced by these two viruses.
To further examine the major sources of variation in the dataset, we labelled PCA plots by
multiple different parameters including sample cores (Fig. 2b), dominant cell type (Fig. 2c)
and viral load (Fig. 2d). Plotting PC 3 and 4, and labelling by sample core revealed some patient
effects - a clear separation of ROIs related to cores LN1 and LN3, and some clustering for other

cores with multiple ROIs (LN10)(Fig. 2b). This suggests that within patient correlations and
patient-patient variation has an important underlying effect on the observed transcriptome and
that this needs to be taken into account in any subsequent analysis This analysis allowed us to
determine that the samples clearly separating on PC2, and clearly clustered from other samples
when plotting PC1 and 2, were grouped based on the dominant cell type found within the
sample core (Fig. 2c). Specifically, cores where bronchiolar epithelial cells were the dominant
cell type clustered together independent of whether the patient had pH1N1 influenza virus or
SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2c), or belonged to the non-infected controls. This implied that the tissue
heterogeneity captured by dominant cell type was a substantial contributor to the variability in
our experiment. While epithelial cells are the primary cellular target of both SARS-CoV-2 and
influenza virus12, our data did not identify viral epithelial tropism as a key regulator of signal
as the cores dominated by bronchial epithelial cells did not exhibit the highest viral load (as
defined by RNA Scope for SARS-CoV-2)(Fig. 2d). However, the high SARS-CoV-2 viral load
cores separate from other virally-infected samples and control samples on PC3 (Fig. 2d).
Together, these analyses suggest that unbiased and accurate comparative transcriptomics
analyses between uninfected, SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 influenza lung samples must take
account of the dominant cell type present in samples, inter-patient variations and within-patient
correlations. The ability to include structural and spatial covariates demonstrates the key
advantage in using a spatial transcriptomics as compared with bulk RNA sequencing, but also
necessitates careful construction of the model used to compare expression across the ROIs
sampled.

Differential gene expression analysis was subsequently performed on all sample cores, taking
into account the effect of the dominant cell type and the appropriate within and inter-patient
variations. 286 genes were identified as significantly upregulated and 20 genes were
significantly downregulated in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2 patients compared with non-virally
infected controls (Fig. 3, Extended Data Table 6, 7).
Down regulated genes included immune-related genes such as B lymphocyte antigen CD19,
cytokine genes such as IL7, IL9 and IL13 and components of the complement cascade (e.g. C9)
together with CSF3, colony stimulating factor, normally associated with mobilization of cells
from the bone marrow (Extended Data Table 6). A number of tumor-associated genes including
GAGE1 and MAGEC2 were downregulated, with these genes being associated with cell
survival. Interestingly, PCK1, which is required for tissue gluconeogenesis, and MPL, that
regulates the generation of megakaryocytes and thus platelet formation were also highly
reduced13.
A more diverse array of upregulated genes was found to be differentially expressed in the lungs
of SARS-CoV-2 patients compared with those from patients who died of non-viral causes
(Extended Data Table 7). These included genes associated with antigen presentation (e.g. B2M,
HLA-DRA, HLA-C and HLA-E), the Type I interferon (IFN) response (e.g. LY6E and IFI27),
fibrosis and epithelial cell growth (e.g. COL3A1, FN1, KRT7, COL1A1, KRT18 and KRT19)
and the complement cascade (C1QA and C1R). Consistent with these observations, gene set
enrichment analysis showed that hallmark genes of biological processes such as reactive
oxygen species, complement, IL6/JAK/STAT3 signalling, apoptosis. p53 signalling IFN-γ
response, hypoxia, IFN-α response, coagulation, TGF-β signalling, IL-2/STAT5 signalling,
angiogenesis, TNF-α signalling via NFκ-B, and inflammatory response were all significantly
upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected lungs (Table 1). Gene set enrichment using blood

PanCancer Progression Panel further confirmed the upregulation of pathways associated with
blood coagulation and angiogenesis responses (Table 2). These analyses show that SARSCoV-2 samples significantly upregulation genes associated with blood coagulation,
angiogenesis, the IFN-α and IFN-γ response and positively regulate cytokine production and
cytokine stimulus during the immune response (Fig. 4). These data are consistent with previous
descriptions of a ‘cytokine storm’ response in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2, often
accompanied by various coagulopathies14. They are also in agreement with the notion that a
late stage or delayed type I IFN response may be observed in concert with a pro-inflammatory
response15.

Limited differential gene expression associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load
The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is a complex interplay of host immunopathology and viral
load. To determine how viral load influenced the host transcriptomic signal, we performed a
differential expression analysis of SARS-CoV-2 samples stratifying based on viral load. Patient
sample cores were classified as either ‘high’ or ‘low’ based on the presence of viral mRNA by
RNAscope®. Thus, two cores which were scored positively by RNAscope®, LN1 and LN3,
were designated as ‘high’ while the remaining 8 cores from SARS-CoV-2 patients were scored
as ‘low’. This analysis showed that only 17 up-regulated and 7 down-regulated genes were
differentially expressed between the high viral load SARS-CoV-2 infected cores and the other
SARS-CoV-2 cores (Fig. 5, Table 3). Consistent with our RNAScope analyses, SAR-CoV-2
specific genes S and ORF1ab were the most strongly upregulated genes in the high viral load
group (1.916 and 1.861 log2 fold change, respectively). All other upregulated genes with >1
log2 fold change in expression were associated with the type I IFN response (CXCL10, IFIT3,
ISG15, MX1, GBP1 and IFI6)(Fig. 5a, Table 3).

The above analysis assumed that every ROI derived from the same core would have the same
degree of viral infection (i.e. high or low). However, viral infection is unlikely to be uniform
across tissues. Indeed, none of the bronchiolar epithelial ROIs in the two viral high cores were
classified as high (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Table 5). To examine the impact of this, we
considered each ROI as an independent sample which was classified as either ‘high’ (score>0)
or ‘low’ by RNAscope positivity. By stratifying cores with this criterion and accounting for
the dominant cell type as well as correlations between ROIs from the same core, we identified
33 differentially upregulated genes and 132 downregulated genes in high viral load ROIs
compared to low viral load ROIs (Extended Data Table 8). Once again, S and ORF1ab were
the most strongly upregulated genes in the high viral load group (2.415 and 2.365 log2 fold
change respectively). Other upregulated genes of note were those associated with the type I
IFN response (e.g. RSAD2, OASL, TLR8, IL1RN and IKBKE), chemokines associated with
IFN−γ (e.g. CXCL11, CCL8 and CCL7) and the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. A more diverse
array of genes were downregulated in high viral load samples including those associated with
the complement cascade (e.g. C3), ribosomal proteins (e.g. RPS6 and RPL23) and antioxidants
(e.g. PRDX5)(Figure 5B). Taken together, these data suggest that a pronounced type I
interferon gene signature is associated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA expression and the spatial
context provided by this technology enables finer details of viral load associations to be
determined.

Severe COVID-19 is associated with a limited, differential transcriptome when compared
with severe influenza
Only a limited number of genes were identified as differentially expressed between COVID19 and pH1N1 influenza samples (2 downregulated and 4 upregulated genes, Fig. 6). Of the
six genes significantly differentially regulated in COVID-19 samples, three were associated

with the type I IFN response (LY6E, IFI27 & IFI6), two were heat shock protein family
members (HSPA6 & HSPA1A) and one, CT45A1, when combined with various growth factors,
is associated with cell survival and tumorigenesis. Interestingly, all three of the interferoninducible genes were also significantly upregulated in COVID-19 samples compared to those
without a viral infection (Extended Data Table 7). Two heat shock protein family members
(HSPA1A and HSPA) were also identified as significantly down-regulated in COVID-19
tissues. These two proteins were found to be significantly upregulated in pH1N1 tissues
compared to uninfected tissues (data not shown), suggesting a potential influenza specific
signature. Together, these data indicate that pH1N1 influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 induce
only subtly different host pulmonary transcriptomes but may be potentially distinguished by a
core disease-associated immune signature.

Discussion
Understanding the biological functions, networks, and host-pathogen interactions that impact
organ and disease development requires both cellular information and a spatial context.
Analyses of bulk RNA sequencing or scRNA sequencing provides a global overview of an
organ’s response to a pathogen, typically identifying broad inflammatory pathways. However,
such approaches fail to identify subtle individual cellular changes that are spatially distinct.
This has particular impact when considering innate and adaptive immune cells that may be
crucial for understanding pathogen-specific responses, and to distinguish the profile of one
pathogen from another. In contrast, spatially resolved transcriptomes of virally-infected tissues
offers the possibility of disentangling the individual infected cells, contributions of viral load,
cellular responses and hence patient-to-patient variability.

The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is highly variable. Association of viral load with disease
severity would provide a mechanism for early stratification of patients for treatment options.
Indeed, analyses of nasopharyngeal swabs suggests that nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA is
independently correlated with disease severity16, similar to earlier observations with SARSCoV-117. However, the association between viral replication in the lung and severe disease
remains more complicated. Here, we observed that 8 out of 10 patients who died because of
COVID-19 had no detectable viral RNA in lung biopsies as determined by RNAscope.
Transcriptomic analysis showed that areas of high viral load were associated with a pronounced
type I IFN response, consistent with other preliminary spatial analysis of the lungs of COVID19 patients

11

and assumedly due to increased viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns

(PAMPs) available for type I IFN stimulation. Nevertheless, even in samples where no viral
RNA was detected, a pronounced type I IFN gene signature could still be observed in the
pulmonary tissue. These observations add weight to the growing understanding of the role type
I IFNs in SARS-CoV-2 infections18. Current evidence suggests that an early and robust
induction of type I interferons can help control viral replication and help ensure a mild
infection. In contrast, a delayed induction of type I IFN (i.e. after the peak of viral replication)
is largely irrelevant for viral control as viral titres have already declined at this point in the
infection but may help perpetuate the detrimental pro-inflammatory response and lung damage
18,19

. The transcriptomic data presented here thus speak to the nuanced role of type I IFNs in

SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Pulmonary transcriptomic analysis is a powerful tool to delineate the pathogenesis of SARSCoV-2 and identify how it differs compared to other respiratory pathogens such as influenza
virus. Previous studies have suggested that the lungs of COVID-19 patients display an
increased incidence of alveolar capillary microthrombi and thrombosis with microangiopathy

compared to those of influenza patients5. In the present study, D-dimer levels were elevated in
six of ten COVID-19 patients and some thrombosis was observed. Consistent with these
observations, an earlier report using bulk lung RNA analyses to identify 69 differentiallyexpressed angiogenesis-related genes in COVID-19 patients, but not in influenza patients11.
Strikingly, while we observed that both COVID-19 and influenza patients had an upregulation
of genes associated with coagulation and angiogenesis, these genes were not differentially
expressed between the two virus-infected patient groups. These contrasting data point to the
complementary role of blood profiling, bulk and tissue-specific spatial analyses in defining
clinical parameters for therapy.

Accurate detection, timely diagnosis and effective treatment are all essential to the management
of COVID-19 and will be instrumental in curbing viral spread as the number of new infections
increase daily. Several potential clinical and transcriptional biomarkers for triaging patients
with COVID-19 have been explored. Clinical biomarkers include C-reactive protein, serum
amyloid A, interleukin-6, lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, D-dimer,
lymphocytes and platelet count 20,21. However, the majority of these studies have focussed on
biomarkers in patient blood. While peripheral blood samples are a convenient and highly
accessible site for clinical sampling, this is not the primary site of viral infection. Thus,
information delineated from analyses of blood may not reflect tissue severity and thus may
hamper biomarker discovery. Furthermore, a biomarker that could be rapidly identified in the
respiratory tissue (e.g. via a nasal swab) may be more accessible in low resource settings than
one requiring a blood sample. Interestingly, previous analyses of IFI27 (interferon-alpha
inducible protein 27) in blood of COVID-19 patients revealed that IFI27 was upregulated in
SARS-CoV-2 infection22-24 . Here, we identified IFI27 as differentiated upregulated in the
lungs of both COVID-19 patients vs control patients and in the highly restricted set of genes

differentially expressed between COVID-19 and influenza patients. IFI27 has previously been
used as a biomarker to successfully differentiate bacterial pneumonia from influenza virus
infection25. These data raise the exciting possibility that IFI27 may not only represent a
biomarker for severe COVID-19 but that it may also help differentiate this disease from other
clinically similar viral infections. This becomes particularly important as the ‘second wave’ of
COVID-19 in the US and Europe is set to overlap with the winter influenza season. Validation
of this gene in nasal specimens, as well associations with disease severity will be required to
confirm IFI27 as a gene signature that is useful in stratifying COVID-19 patients.

This study was subject to several important limitations. Firstly, all data was derived from a
small sample cohort derive from a single study site, and it remains to be determined how much
these data can be extrapolated to other patient populations. Furthermore, additional studies are
required across a broader range of patients (i.e. those with mild and moderate disease) to
determine the therapeutic value of any of the putative tissue biomarkers identified herein.
However, despite these limitations these data reveal the unprecedented power of spatial
profiling combined with detailed multiparameter bioinformatic analyses to dissect the key
variables that contribute to differential gene expression across highly variable patient cohorts
and the heterogeneous distribution of virus and immune responsiveness within tissues. This
study also demonstrated the value of using the suite of linear-modelling tools available in
limma to interrogate the complex multi-factorial experiment design in this study. In particular,
limma's ability to model complex experimental designs and to implement information
borrowing amongst genes to handle the relatively small number of samples in the panel, make
it a highly attractive analysis tool for spatial profiling techniques with targeted gene panels.

The present study suggests that spatial profiling would present many advantages in analysing
COVID-19 samples across different patient cohorts to identify fundamental response
signatures distinct from background effects. This work therefore established the foundation to
evaluate larger tissue cohorts to assess the relationship between blood and tissue biomarkers,
disease progression, pathology and repair.

Methods

Patient selection. Tissue microarray (TMA) cores were prepared from autopsied pulmonary
tissue from 10 SARS-CoV-2 and 5 pH1N1 patients who died from respiratory failure
(ARDS)(Extended Data Table 1-3). Control material was obtained from 4 uninfected patients
(Extended Data Table 3). All SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 patients were confirmed for infection
through RTqPCR of nasopharyngeal swab specimens, and imaging with computed tomography
(CT) showed diffuse and bilateral opacities with ground-glass attenuation, suggestive of viral
pulmonary infection. Autopsy and biopsy materials were obtained from the Pontificia
Universidade Catolica do Parana PUCPR the National Commission for Research Ethics

Queensland Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) ratification.

Tissue Preparation and Histopathology. Thirty 5µm thick serial sections were cut from the
TMA blocks onto positively charged slides (Bond Apex) and sections were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson’s trichrome stain. Brightfield images were obtained
using an Aperio (Leica Biosystems, US) slide scanner for assessment of histopathology by a
pathologist. TMA cores were assessed for overall histological pattern. Regions of interest
(ROIs) were semi-quantitatively analysed for alveolar haemorrhage and oedema, hyaline
membrane formation, acute inflammation, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous
metaplasia, capillary congestion, fibroblastic foci, and interstitial inflammation.

Immunohistochemistry and RNAscope®. Immunohistochemistry was performed on a Leica
Bond-RX autostainer (Leica Biosystems, US) with antibody targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike

protein (Abcam, ab272504) at 2 µg/ml. Heat induced epitope retrieval was performed in buffer
ER1 at 100°C for 20 minutes, and signal visualized with 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB)
substrate. Slides were imaged using a Zeiss Axioscanner (Carl Zeiss, Germany) and IHC was
scored by a pathologist for bronchiolar epithelium, type 2 pneumocytes, interstitial
lymphocytes and alveolar macrophage compartments.

RNAscope® probes (ACDbio, US) targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA (nCoV2019,
#848561-C3), ACE2 host receptor mRNA (#848151-C2), and host serine protease TMPRSS2
mRNA (#470341-C1) were used as per manufacturer instructions for automation on Leica
Bond RX. DNA was visualised with Syto13 (Thermofisher Scientific), channel 1 with Opal
570 (1:500), channel 2 with Opal 620 (1:1500), and channel 3 with Opal 690
(1:1500)(PerkinElmer). Fluorescent images were acquired with Nanostring Mars prototype
DSP at 20x.

Nanostring GeoMX DSP Covid-19 Immune Atlas Panel. Freshly cut sections of each TMA
were processed according to the Nanostring GeoMX Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) slide
preparation manual by the technology access program. Briefly, slides were baked 1 hour at
60oC and then processed by Leica Bond RX autostainer. Slides were pre-treated with
Proteinase K and then hybridised with mRNA probes contained in the Covid-19 Immune Atlas
panel with additional SARS-CoV-2 spike-in panel. After incubation, slides were washed and
then stained with CD68, CD3, PanCK, and Syto83 for 1 hour then loaded into GeoMX DSP
instrument for scanning and ROI selection. Selected ROIs were guided by RNAscope® and
IHC positivity on SARS-CoV-2 tissues with similar tissue structures captured on H1N1 and
uninfected tissue cores. Oligonucleotides linked to hybridised mRNA targets were cleaved and
collected for counting using Illumina i5 and i7 dual indexing. PCR reactions were performed

with 4 µl of a GeoMx DSP sample. AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) were used at 1.2×
bead-to-sample ratio for PCR product purification. Paired-end sequencing (2×75) was
performed using NextSeq550 up to 400M total aligned reads. Fastq files were processed by
DND system and uploaded to GeoMX DSP system where raw and Q3 normalized counts of all
targets were aligned with regions of interest (ROIs).

Transcriptomic Data. Data used in this study result from an mRNA assay conducted with the
NanoString’s GeoMx Covid-19 Immune atlas panel using the GeoMX Digital Spatial Profiler
(DSP). The data were measurements of RNA abundance of over 1800 genes, including 22 addin COVID related genes, 4 SARS-CoV-2 specific genes and 2 negative control (SARS-CoV-2
Neg, NegProbe) genes and 32 internal reference genes. Samples were acquired from 3 TMA
slides each containing 10 tissue cores from 10 patients. The three slides correspond to either
COVID-19, H1N1 or Control Tissue biopsies. Transcriptomic measurements were made on
regions of interests within each core. Control samples are COVID-free and H1N1-free, but they
are not necessarily disease-free samples; they originate from patients with other non-viral
diseases. In total, 60 ROIs were analysed (47 COVID-19, 8 H1N1 and 5 “Control”). Factors
considered in this dataset include disease type (COVID, H1N1 and Control), patient of origin,
dominant tissue type (Type 2 pneumocytes, bronchiolar epithelium, hyaline membranes,
macrophages) and viral load (based on RNAscope, RNAscope scores).

Bioinformatic analyses. Data exploration and quality checks were conducted on the Q3
normalised count data generated from the CTA DSP mRNA assay. Relative log expression
(RLE) plots were used assess the presence of unwanted variation in the form of batch effects
26

. Data were normalised using the trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) method 27 using the all

the genes in the panel. Specifically, log-transformed transcript abundance data were median-

centred for each gene, and then within each sample the difference between the observed and
population median of each gene was calculated. Principal components analysis (PCA) of the
samples was conducted to identify variability related to specific factors in the dataset and
experimental design.

Differential expression (DE) analysis, Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
were carried out using R/Bioconductor packages edgeR (v3.30.3)28,29 and limma (v3.44.3)30.
Briefly, differential expression was modelled using linear models with various experimental
factors as predictors. Variation in gene expression was modelled as the combination of a
common dispersion that applies to all genes and a gene-specific dispersion. Limma was used
to model and estimate the variation of each gene by borrowing information from all other genes
using an empirical Bayes approach, thereby allowing estimation of the common and gene-wise
variation with as few as 2 replicates per condition. Once the linear model was fit to a given
experimental design, various contrasts of interest were used to query the data for differential
expression. The resulting statistic was an empirical Bayes moderated t-statistic which was more
robust than a t-statistic from a classic t-test. Based on the observed differences between cores
and tissue structures from the PCA analyses, considerations were made to allow for similarity
that exists for regions originating from the same core using duplicationCorrelations in limma31.
The flexible modelling framework afforded by linear models was used to take into account
differences between heterogenous tissue structures (i.e. bronchiolar epithelial samples vs the
rest of the samples) by including them as covariates in the models.

Two main factors were investigated in this analysis, namely disease type (COVID19, H1N1
and Control) and viral load. For disease type, two comparisons were investigated: COVID
against Control with cores and dominant tissue type as covariates, and COVID against H1N1

samples, with cores and dominant tissue type as covariates. For these two contrasts, the voomlimma with duplicationCorrelations pipeline32 was used to fit linear models. The TREAT
criteria was then applied33 (p-value <0.05) to perform statistical tests and subsequently
calculate the t-statistics, log-fold change (logFC), and adjusted p-values for all genes. For viral
load, the voom-limma with duplicationCorrelations pipeline32 (p-value <0.05) was used to fit
linear models for the comparison between high and low viral load regions originating from
COVID-19 patient cores (disease type as a covariate). The contrast was applied on two
resolutions, firstly by grouping ROIs from the same cores with the same degree of viral load
(cores/patients-based approach); secondly by treating each regions/ROIs sample as an
independent observation (ROI-based approach). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were
performed using the fry approach from the limma package. Gene sets from the Molecular
Signatures Database (MsigDB) Hallmarks 34,35 , C2 (curated gene sets) and C7 (immunologic
signature gene sets) categories were tested using fry. Pathways from the KEGG pathway
database were tested using the kegga function in the limma package and gene ontology
enrichment was assessed using goana from the limma package31.

expressed genes comparing COVID-19 and uninfected samples were conducted using the
estimated log2 fold change and p-values with the distribution of significantly differentiated
genesets visualised as a function of the log2 fold change (logFC) and genes sorted by the logFC.
The genesets are custom genesets for (a) angiogenesis response, (b) blood coagulation (g)
hypoxia responses based on nanoString’s nCounter® PanCancer Progression Panel were
identified by GSEA to be differentially upregulated in COVID-19 samples. (see Table 2). (e,
f) MSigDB Hallmark gene set for IFN-α and IFN-γ. (c, d) MSigDB Gene Ontology (GO),
biological processes (BP) collection identified by GSEA for cytokine regulation and responses.
Refer to comprehensive list in Table 1. GSEA conducted using limma-fry with FDR <0.05.
The direction and relative change in expression are shown. Details of each geneset are provided
in Extended Data Figure 4.
Figure 4. Resolution provided by spatial data reveals type I interferon gene signature
associates with COVID-19 viral load. Distribution of differentially expressed genes as a
function of the average transcript expression and fold change (log2) identified in high viral
load vs low viral load COVID-19 samples. Analyses were conducted at two resolutions, firstly
by (a) grouping ROIs from the same cores with the same degree of viral load (core patientsbased approach); secondly by (b) treating each regions/ROIs sample as an independent
observation (ROI-based approach). In both approaches, SAR-CoV-2 specific genes S and
ORF1ab were strongly upregulated in the high viral load group, consistent with results of the
RNAscope. Consistent with previous reports, type I IFN response genes were associated with
SAR-CoV-2 RNA expression. Notably the core-based approach reveals limited differential
gene expression with the finer resolution ROI-based approach revealing additional differential
changes in complement cascade, ribosomal protein and antioxidants genes. Representative
genes are highlighted. Differential expression genes derived using voom-limma pipeline with
limma:duplicationCorrelations and applying absolute log2 fold change > 1.0 with p-value
<0.05.
Figure 5. Limited transcriptomic differences associated with COVID-19 infection

classified based on associated biological processes. The genes associated with the type I
Interferon response, heat shock protein family members and (associated) with cell survival and
tumorigenesis are shown. This exclusive list of genes reveals the subtle differences between
COVID-19 and H1N1 infected transcriptome and presents a potential disease specific
transcriptomic signature for distinguishing the two disease types. Differential expression genes
derived using voom-limma pipeline with limma:duplicationCorrelations and applying TREAT
criteria with absolute log fold change > 1.2 with p-value <0.05.
Extended Data Figure 1. Representative assessment of virus load in DSP ROIs using
RNAscope and IHC for SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA and protein, respectively, on serial
sections. Fluorescent IHC staining was performed for DSP acquisition using monocytes
(CD68, yellow), T cells (CD3ε, red), lung epithelial cells (PanCK, green) and nuclei (DAPI,
blue), (left panels, A, D, G, J). RNAscope staining was performed as per manufacturer’s
instructions using nCoV2019-s probe for SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA (center panels, B, E, H,
K). IHC was performed with antibody against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (right panels, C, F,
I, L). ROIs were semi-quantitatively scored from 0 to 3 based on RNAscope signal abundance.
A-C. Representative ROI with RNAscope score of 3 (high). D-F. Representative ROI with
RNAscope score of 2 (intermediate). G-I. Representative ROI with RNAscope score of 1

Extended Data Figure 3. TMM normalisation of the data removed systematic bias in the
uninfected samples.
Relative log expression (RLE) plots for the Q3-normalised counts identified a systematic
higher gene expression in the (a) uninfected control samples. The Q3-data was normalised
using the (b) trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) method24 using the all the genes in the gene
panel. The normalisation removed the systematic bias in the regions corresponding to cores
from control (uninfected) patients, allowing for cross-region analyses between the different
disease types. TMM normalisation conducted using the calcNormFactors function in edgeR.
