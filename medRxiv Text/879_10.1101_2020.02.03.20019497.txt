Abstract

2

Objective: To estimate the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19)

3

from information on 28 infector-infectee pairs.

4

Methods: We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and

5

secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case

6

investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and

7

performed analyses on both the full dataset (n=28) and a subset of pairs with

8

highest certainty in reporting (n=18). In addition, we adjusting for right

9

truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase.

10

Results: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated

11

the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9).

12

Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was

13

estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9).

14

Conclusions: The serial interval of COVID-19 is shorter than its median

15

incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary

16

transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is

17

also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),

18

indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce

19

bias.

Introduction
The epidemic of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections that began in

13

China in late 2019 has rapidly grown and cases have been reported worldwide.

14

An empirical estimate of the serial interval‚Äîthe time from illness onset in a

15

primary case (infector) to illness onset in a secondary case (infectee)‚Äîis needed

16

to understand the turnover of case generations and transmissibility of the disease

17

[1]. Estimates of the serial interval can only be obtained by linking dates of onset

18

for infector-infectee pairs, and these links are not easily established. A recently

19

published epidemiological study used contact tracing data from cases reported in

20

Hubei Province early in the epidemic to estimate the mean serial interval at 7.5

21

days [2], which is consistent with the 8.4-day mean serial interval reported for

22

severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from Singaporean household contact

23

data [3]. However, there were only six infector-infectee pairs in this dataset, and

24

sampling bias may have been introduced to the variance and mean. To further

assess the serial interval of COVID-19 infections we compiled a dataset of 28

2

publicly shared infector-infectee pairs and calculated the serial interval from

3

these data.

Materials and Methods

5

We scanned publicly available information published in research articles

6

and quoted from official reports of outbreak investigations to obtain our dataset.

7

The date of illness onset was defined as the date on which a symptom relevant to

8

COVID-19 infection appeared and was determined by the reporting

9

governmental body. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the ascertained

10

pairs into ‚Äúcertain‚Äù and ‚Äúprobable,‚Äù where the former was used for pairs and

11

dates of illness onset were clearly defined in an academic article and the latter

12

was applied to pairs and dates of illness onset that were clearly defined but

13

quoted from outbreak investigation reports. Estimates were obtained for certain

14

and probable pairs combined (n=28) as well as for the certain pairs alone (n=18).

15

The interval censored data were handled in units of days. We employed

16

a Bayesian approach with doubly interval censored likelihood to obtain estimates

17

of the serial interval [4]:

(http://github.com/aakhmetz/nCoVSerialInteval2020).

3

As the epidemic will continue to grow beyond our data collection cutoff

4

point of 12 February 2020, it is possible that the na√Øve likelihood (1)

5

underestimates the serial interval as sampling during the early stage of the

6

epidemic preferentially excludes infector-infectee pairs with longer serial

7

intervals. We adjusted for this selection bias‚Äîcalled right truncation‚Äîin our

8

model. The alternative p.d.f. that accounts for right truncation during the

exponential growth phase of the epidemic is written as:

where r is the exponential growth rate estimated at 0.14 [5] and T is the latest

11

time of observation (12 February 2020). The widely applicable information

12

criterion (WAIC) was used to compare between distributions and the model with

13

the minimal WAIC value was selected as the best-fit model for each set of

14

estimates with and without right truncation.

Results

16

We were able to obtain data on 28 infector-infectee pairs (see

17

Supplementary Table). Of these, 12 pairs were family clusters. Accounting for

18

right truncation and analyzing all pairs, the model using the lognormal

19

distribution was selected as the best-fit model (WAIC=224.0) The median serial

20

interval was estimated at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9) while

21

the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the serial interval were estimated at 4.7

days (95% CrI: 3.7, 6.0) and 2.9 days (95% CrI: 1.9, 4.9), respectively. Without

truncation, the model using the lognormal distribution was also the best-fit model

2

(WAIC=128.0) with the median serial interval was estimated at 3.9 days (95%

3

CrI: 3.1, 4.8).

4

Limiting our dataset to only certain observations, the median serial

5

interval of the best-fit Weibull distribution model was estimated at 4.6 days (95%

6

CI: 3.5, 5.9) with a mean and SD of 4.8 days (95% CrI: 3.8, 6.1) and 2.3 days

7

(95% CrI: 1.6, 3.5), respectively. Without truncation, the best-fit model used the

8

lognormal distribution and estimated the median serial interval at 4.1 days (95%

9

CrI: 3.2, 5.0). Figure 1 shows the best-fit distributions overlaid with a published

10

distribution of the SARS serial interval [4].

11

Discussion

12

Our estimate of the median serial interval as 4.0 days indicates that

13

COVID-19 infection leads to rapid cycles of transmission from one generation of

14

cases to the next. The shorter serial interval compared to SARS implies that

15

contact tracing methods must compete against the rapid replacement of case

16

generations, and the number of contacts may soon exceed what available

17

healthcare and public health workers are able to handle. The difference between

18

these distributions suggests that using serial intervals estimates from SARS data

19

will result in overestimation of the COVID-19 basic reproduction number.

20

More importantly, the estimated median serial interval is shorter than the

21

preliminary estimates of the mean incubation period (approximately 5 days)

22

[3,6]. As illustrated in Figure 2, when the serial interval is shorter than the

23

incubation period, pre-symptomatic transmission is likely to have taken place

24

and may even occur more frequently than symptomatic transmission. A

1

substantial proportion of secondary transmission occurring before illness onset

2

indicates that many transmissions cannot be prevented solely through isolation of

3

symptomatic cases, as by the time contacts are traced they may have already

4

become infectious themselves and generated secondary cases [7].

5

Correct ascertainment of dates of illness onset is critical to the calculation of

6

the serial interval. Considering the overall mild nature of the infection [8] it is

7

possible that different reporting jurisdictions have different criteria for

8

determining what qualifies as illness onset for COVID-2019 cases, which is a

9

potential bias we are unable to account for. However, the present study addresses

10

the issue of data quality of the reported pairs in two ways. First, our data include

11

the updated information from a recent report of pre-symptomatic transmission in

12

Germany [9] where it was later found that the primary case was already

13

symptomatic while in contact with persons who later became infected

14

(Supplementary Material in [9]). Second, classification of the credibility of the

15

data and comparing analyses including and excluding less certain (but

16

nonetheless highly probable) pairs allowed us to determine that our results using

17

all pairs (and therefore a greater sample size) did not differ significantly from the

18

results using only the most credible data.

19

In conclusion, we have estimated the median serial interval of COVID-19 at

20

4.0 days, which is shorter than the disease‚Äôs median incubation period indicating

21

that rapid cycles of transmission and substantial pre-symptomatic transmissions

22

are occurring. Thus, containment via case isolation alone is likely to be very

23

challenging.
