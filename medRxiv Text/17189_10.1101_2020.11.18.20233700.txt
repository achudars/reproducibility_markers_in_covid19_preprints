Abstract
Background:
Recent researches reported the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID – 19) pandemic
on the clinical practice of specific type cancers. The aim of this study was to reveal the impact of
the COVID-19 outbreak on the clinical practice of various cancers.
Methods:
We included hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older diagnosed between July 2018 and June
2020 with one of the top 12 most common cancers in Japan (colon/rectum, lung, gastric, breast,
bladder & urinary tract, pancreas, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, liver, prostate, esophagus, uterus,
and gallbladder & biliary tract) using Diagnostic Procedure Combination data, an administrative
database in Japan. The intervention was defined April 2020 based on a declaration of emergency
from Japanese government. The change volume of number of monthly admissions with each
cancer was tested by interrupted time series (ITS) analysis, and monthly cases with radical
surgery or chemotherapy for each cancer were descripted.
Results:
403,344 cases were included during the study period. The most common cancer was
colon/rectum (20.5%), followed by lung (17.5%). In almost cancer cases, the number of
admissions decreased in May 2020. In particular, colorectal, lung, gastric, breast, uterine, or
esophageal cancer cases decreased by over 10%. The number of admissions with surgery or
chemotherapy decreased in colorectal, lung, gastric, breast, uterine, or esophageal cancer. ITS
analysis indicated that cases with gastric or esophageal cancer were affected more than other
type of cancer.

INTRODUCTION
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) is affecting a
wide range of clinical practices. Since the outbreak in December 2019, more than 30 million
cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported worldwide, including more
than 959,000 deaths [1]. The symptoms of COVID-19 vary from fever and common cold
symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and death [2].
In the field of oncology, many academic societies, educational institutions, and
government agencies have announced recommendations during COVID-19 pandemic [3-6]. The
European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) has divided its treatment priorities into three
phases (High, Medium, Low priority) [5]. For each type of cancer, the initial treatment is given
high priority while considering the degree of epidemic spread and the degree of shortage of
human/material resources [5,6].
In Japan, the number of patients with COVID-19 has increased since the Japanese
government declared a state of emergency without urban lockdown on April 7, 2020 [7]. The
increase of COVID-19 patients has caused a temporary shortage of personal protective
equipment (PPE) and an increase in hospital-acquired infections [8]. Therefore, it brings serious
concerns about shortages of material/human resources, Japanese academic societies announced
the recommendation of treatment for cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic, as have academic
societies worldwide [9,10]. Previous studies have indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic has
had an impact on cancer treatment, such as a decrease in the number of operations for patients
with malignant tumors [11,12]. However, few studies have reported general effects, such as a
decrease of hospital admissions related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the field of

oncology. The aim of our study was to reveal the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the
clinical practice of various cancers.

METHODS
Data source and study participants
We analyzed Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) data from the Quality
Indicator/Improvement Project (QIP) database, which was administered by the Department of
Healthcare Economics and Quality Management, Kyoto University. The QIP database has DPC
data from acute care hospitals voluntarily participating in the project. The number of participant
hospitals was over 500, which took place all over Japan and included both public and private
hospitals [13]. In Japan, the DPC/Per-Diem Payment System (PDPS) is a prospective payment
system adopted for acute care hospitals. The number of general beds applied with the DPC/PDPS
in 2018 was 482,618, which was 54% of all general beds of Japanese hospitals
(482,618/891,872) [14,15]. The DPC data contain claims and clinical summary data, which
include hospital identifiers, admission and discharge statuses (hospital death or not), cause of
admission, main diagnosis, the most and second-most medical resource-intensive diagnoses, up
to 10 comorbidities, and 10 complications. All diagnoses were classified based on the
International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. For further details, refer
to the following published paper [13].
We included patients who were aged 18 years or older and admitted between July 1, 2018
and June 30, 2020 and whose both major and most most-medical resource-intensive diagnosis
was a cancer diagnosis based on ICD-10 codes. Among these cases, we analyzed in detail the top

12 most common types of cancer in Japan (colon/rectum, lung, gastric, breast, bladder & urinary
tract, pancreas, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, liver, prostate, esophagus, uterus, and gallbladder &
biliary tract) based on the WHO`s research [16]. We used claims codes for surgical procedures
classification codes from the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Japan for identifying the surgical
procedure.
Statistical analyses
We divided the population into two: those who were admitted and discharged between July 2018
and June 2019 and between July 2019 and June 2020 for year-over-year comparisons. Because
the DPC data were coded on the day of discharge, the data of patients who were not discharged
before the end of June 2020 were not available, even though their date of admission was before
June 30, 2020. We then described the total number of admission cases, the cases with any radical
surgical procedure, and cases with chemotherapy for each cancer. Furthermore, we assessed the
monthly ratio of the proportion of admission cases with each cancer diagnosis to the total
number of cancer cases.
The ratio of proportions = proportion of admission cases [2019/07-2020/06] / proportion of
admission cases [2018/07-2019/06]
where
proportion of admission cases [2019/7-2020/6] = number of admission cases with each diagnosis
of cancer per month between July 2019 and June 2020 / number of admission cases with all
cancers per month between July 2019 and June 2020
and where

proportion of admission cases [2018/7-2019/6] = number of admission cases with each diagnosis
of cancer per month between July 2018 and June 2019 / number of admission cases with all
cancers per month between July 2018 and June 2019.
Continuous variables were presented as median, interquartile range, and categorical
variables were presented as numbers and proportions. We performed an interrupted time series
(ITS) analysis, with segmented and Poisson regressions, taking into account seasonality, secular
trends, and overdispersion of data, to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
population-level admissions [17,18]. Seasonality was considered by including harmonic terms
(sines and cosines) with 12-month periods to our model [17]. The validity of the Poisson
regression model was assessed by checking the correlograms (functions of autocorrelation and
partial autocorrelation) and the residuals.
The Japanese government declared a state of emergency on April 7, 2020, and because
our study examined the number of admission cases per month, we designated April 2020 as the
beginning of intervention and estimated that the declaration of emergency with COVID-19
pandemic would rapidly decrease the admission volume after April 7, 2020 [7]. Because the
DPC data were generated on the day of discharge, our model assessed the change of monthly
admission volume based on the date of discharge.
Statistical significance was regarded as a two-sided P-value <0.05. All analyses were
performed using R 3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
Ethical considerations
The present study was approved by the ethics committee of Kyoto University (approval number:
R0135), and we did not require informed consent because of the use of anonymized data, in

RESULTS
We included a total of 403,344 cases with any cancer diagnosis, in accordance with the top 12
most common types of cancer during the study period. The median age was 72 years old, and
59% of the study population were males. The most common primary lesion was colorectal
(20.5%), followed by lung (17.5%) and stomach (12.3%). Patients who underwent any radical
surgery or any chemotherapy were 33.7% and 36.4%, respectively (Table1). The characteristics
of the study population with each cancer diagnosis case were described in Supplementary Table1.
For almost all cancer cases, the number of admission cases decreased in May 2020
compared with May 2019. In particular, colorectal, lung, gastric, breast, uterine, and esophageal
cancer cases decreased by over 10% (Table2). The monthly ratio of the proportion of each cancer
case to all cancer cases was near 1. However, only the proportion of gastric cancer cases
decreased (Table2). The trends in the number of cases for each cancer diagnosis are shown in
Supplementary Figure1. The number of cases in June largely decreased because the study
population contained the cases that were admitted and discharged by the end of June.

The range of decrease of cases with any radical surgical procedure and cases with
chemotherapy varied depending on the type of cancer (Table3). In May 2020, the number of
cases with colorectal, lung, gastric, or esophageal cancer with surgery decreased by more than
10% compared with those in the previous year. The number of cases for chemotherapy with lung,
gastric, breast, or uterus cancer decreased by more than 10% compared with those in the
previous year. In contrast, cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, prostate, pancreas, biliary duct
cancer reduction in hospital admissions was less than 10% in May 2020 compared with other
types of cancer.
We conducted ITS analysis for the number of cases for the total study population and
each type of cancer diagnosis. The results indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative
impact on the number of cases for most types of cancer (Table4). In particular, the number of
cases with gastric and esophageal cancer was affected more. The result of ITS analysis for the
overall study population is described in Figure1. In the ITS analysis, the number of cases per
month was counted on the basis of the date of discharge. These results are shown in
Supplementary Table2.

DISCUSSION
Regarding cancer practice during the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the main concerns is it might
delay the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Our study indicates that cancer care needed to
hospitalize was affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in many cancer types. As the number of
patients infected with COVID-19 increased, the Japanese government declared a state of
emergency, and as a result, the number of admission cases with most types of cancer has
decreased, with the lowest number in May 2020. Our study also showed that the impact differed

according to the types of cancer. For cases with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, prostate, pancreas or
gallbladder & biliary tract cancer, the reduction in the number of hospitalizations was less than
10% compared with other types of cancer at May, 2020. These results might have been
influenced by academic recommendations or by the biological grade of the cancer itself.
Pancreatic cancer was reported with a tumor doubling time of 159 days, and a cellular doubling
time of 56 hours was reported in gallbladder cancer. Both cancers were known for poor overall
survival [19-21]. Although there are no recommendations for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma from a
Japanese academic society, the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) defined
treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as high or medium priority [5]. The American Society of
Hematology also recommended that chemotherapies such as R-CHOP (rituximab plus
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) be continued [22].
In contrast, cases of lung, colorectal, gastric, and esophageal cancer decreased
substantially. These results might be related to the route of infection of COVID-19. The basic
infection route of COVID-19 is considered to be droplets and contacts infection [23]. Also, there
are concerns about the possibility of aerosol transmission, which may have led to a substantial
reduction in the number of hospitalized patients with these types of cancer [24]. Bronchoscopy
and gastrointestinal endoscopy play important roles in the diagnosis of these carcinomas.
However, concerns about aerosolized and fecal transmission to health care workers caused
academic societies to recommend that nonurgent testing be considered for postponement [25-28].
Therefore, unlike for other types of cancer, a decrease in the number of hospitalized patients
diagnosed with lung, colorectal, gastric, or esophageal cancer might indicate a decrease in the
number of examinations for diagnosis rather than a delay in treatments for diagnosed patients.

This hypothesis can be inferred from Table3, which shows a similar decrease in the
number of admissions with surgery or chemotherapy despite the fact that delaying treatment such
as surgery and chemotherapy is not recommended. The number of cases with surgery or
chemotherapy for other types of cancer did not considerably decrease. For breast cancer cases,
total admissions cases were reduced by more than 10%. The number of cases with chemotherapy
was also reduced by 10%, while the number of cases with surgery was reduced by less than 10%.
In this regard, it is possible that the chemotherapy regimen was changed to oral drug, or the
dosing interval was extended, as described in the ESMO guidelines, which may have contributed
to a reduction in the overall number of hospital admissions [5]. Uterine cancer cases showed a
similar trend, with the ESMO guidelines regarding second-line chemotherapy as a low priority,
which might explain the decline in the number of chemotherapy cases [5].
This study had several limitations. We evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on cancer care
for inpatients, but not for outpatient. Events related to outpatient cancer treatment include
postponing outpatient testing if they were suspected of having cancer or postponing
chemotherapy in outpatients. Because chemotherapy is often administered as an outpatient
procedure, it is unclear how outpatients with cancer were affected. It is also unclear how a
decrease in the number of hospitalized patients is associated with cancer outcomes. In fact, the
decline in the number of admission cases treated with surgery or chemotherapy was small except
for some types of cancer patients, so it might have little impact on long-term prognosis. The
long-term prognosis should be carefully monitored. In addition, due to the characteristics of DPC
data, the number of patients who were admitted in June decreased significantly in both 2019 and
2020. Many hospitalized patients in June may still have been admitted; therefore, no DPC data

are not generated without discharge, making it difficult to assess the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic in June 2020.
In conclusion, our study indicated the COVID-19 outbreak might cause a decrease in the
number of admission cases with cancer, and cases that received treatments such as surgery or
chemotherapy were not largely affected except for some types of cancer.
