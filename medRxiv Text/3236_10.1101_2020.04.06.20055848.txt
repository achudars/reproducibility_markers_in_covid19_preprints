Abstract
In the first months of 2020 an increasing number of individuals worldwide are infected by the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19). A particularly severe diffusion of the virus has affected Italy and in particular its
northern regions. This is resulting in a high demand of hospitalization with a particular attention on the
intensive care units (ICUs). Hospitals are suffering the high degree of patients to be treated for respiratory
diseases and the majority of the structures located in the north of Italy are or are going to be saturated. This
has led the actual and past national and regional governments to be heavily criticized for reducing in the past
years the number of beds, in particular those located in the ICUs across the country. Aim of this study is to
analyse the availability of hospital beds across the country as well as to determine their management in terms
of complexity and performance of cases treated at regional level. The results of this study underlines that,
despite the reduction of beds for the majority of the hospital wards, ICUs availabilities did not change
between 2010 and 2017. Moreover, this study confirms that the majority of the Italian regions efficiently
manage these structural facilities allowing hospitals to treat patients without the risk of having an

Introduction.
The number of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is dramatically increasing worldwide [1]. The first
person-to-person transmission in Italy was reported on Feb 21st, 2020, and led to an infection chain that
represents the largest COVID-19 outbreak outside Asia to date. At the moment, Italy is the second most
affected country in the World and the first in Europe, with more than 62000 confirmed cases according to the
Italian Department of Civil Protection as of 26th of March 2020. What it is not clearly identified so far is the
reasons for the strong involvement of Italy within the European countries [2] and even more why the spread
of this epidemic has not followed a uniform pattern on the territory: the diffusion of the disease, at the
moment, is focused on the northern regions of the country. This was particularly evident considering that the
virus took some days to reach the central and the southern regions of the land. Currently, the 87% of the
confirmed actual cases are inhabitants of the northern regions that counts the 55% of the total Italian
population. Among them, where the first cases were identified at the end February, is still the region with the
majority of individuals infected by the COVID-19 virus. Similar results can be noted considering the
hospitalization in general (88% in the northern regions and 42% in ) and in the intensive care unit in
particular (85% in the northern regions and 35% in ). This data are provided and daily updated by the Italian
Civil Protection Department [3]. These numbers are indicative of the spread of the infection and underline
that one the main challenges to be faced by the National and the Regional Health Systems is the management
of hospital resources across the country in terms of professionals, medical devices and hospital beds, with a
particular attention on the intensive care unit (ICU) [4].
Given this high demand of hospitalization and critical care, Italian hospitals and in particular those located in
the northern regions have been overloaded and the majority of them are struggling to cope with patients
infected by the COVID-19 in addition to those who are hospitalized from other diseases. This has led the
actual and past national and regional governments to be heavily criticized for reducing in the past years the
number of beds, in particular those located in the ICUs across the country. Different newspapers have
highlighted that a reduction in the number of beds have affected many hospitals over the territory. This
resource reduction is mainly related to the progressive cutting of the national and local budget in the last

decade that led the regional health services to close a significant number of local small dimension hospitals
that generally have higher costs [5]. This lack of beds is confirmed by a recent study of the OECD that
reported that our country counts 2.6 hospital beds per 1000 inhabitants [6], ranking Italy at the 19th place
over 23 countries with Germany having more than 6 beds per 1000 inhabitants. However, this data does not
consider the number of ICUs. The most recent study reporting the number of beds specifically for the ICU
was published by Rhodes et al in 2012 [7]. Also in this case the number of beds located in Italy are below the
European average with 12.9 beds per 100000 inhabitants, while Germany is equipped with 29.2 beds. The
analysis of the Italian National Healthcare Service should take into account that health services are organized
and delivered under the responsibility of local authorities structured at a regional level, while the Italian
Government has a weak strategic leadership.
Starting from these premises, the aim of this study is to analyse the Italian regional hospital systems in order
to assess the efficiency and the performance of the hospital bed management in the years that precede the
COVID-19 outbreak. Specific attention is given to the management of the intensive care unit departments. In
this perspective, there are two methodologies adopted to assess the efficiency of a health structure in the
management of clinical hospitalized cases: the first one is the hospital bed management [8-10] that provides
an overall description of the use of beds by health structures. The second methodology evaluates the
performance of a hospital considering the complexity of the cases treated by the structure [11-12]. Both
methodologies investigate hospital performances providing a helpful snapshot for healthcare managers for
the evaluation of healthcare systems [13].
The paper is structured as follows: after the materials and methods paragraph, a picture of the virus diffusion
and workload of the hospital infrastructure is reported to provide an overview of the extraordinary event
faced by the health and social care professionals in Italy. After that, a comparison of data captured in the
years 2010 and 2017 is performed to verify the differences across years in terms of hospital beds available in
each region. Finally, the results of the hospital bed management analysis are reported to capture the
efficiency as well as the complexity and performance of patient hospitalizations.

Materials and methods
Data
This paper is focused on two main data sources. The first one provides daily data on the diffusion and
hospital infrastructure consumption during the COVID-19 outbreak. They are collected by the Italian Civil
Protection Department and collected on several web sites [3]. The second information flow concerns data on
hospital bed management. Administrative and clinical data produced during the hospitalization process are
collected in Discharge Report Forms and sent by the hospital information systems of a single health provider
and centrally collected by the Ministry of Health. They describe each service provided to a patient as well as
facilities available and staff employed in the relevant structure. This information is aggregated and published
in the web site of the Ministry of Health [14]. The data analysed in this study refer to the year 2017, the latest
data published by the Ministry of Health. Moreover, data captured for the year 2010 are analysed to examine
differences between 2010 and 2017 in terms of resources available across the territory. This study considers
both the public and private institutes, excluding the private nursing homes. The datasets gathered from the
Ministry of Health website [14] and the relevant analyses performed during the current study are available in
the Zenodo repository [15].
Methodologies
The overall description of the hospital bed management is assessed using the following indicators computed
on the basis of the number of beds, the patient discharged over a specific period of time (i.e. a year) and total
number of in-patient days (i.e. the overall number of days that all the patients are hospitalized) [16].
•

Beds Occupancy Rate (BOR): percentage of inpatient beds occupied over a specific period;

•

Average Length Of Stay (AvLOS): average number of days that an inpatients remained in the
hospital;

•

Turnover Interval (TOI): number of days that an available bed remains empty between the discharge
of a patient and the admission of a next one;

•

Beds Turn Over (BTO): average number of patients “passing through” each bed during a specific
period.

The authors also adopted reference thresholds for TOI (1<TOI<3) and BOR (BOR>75%). These values have
been used to classify each region in the following areas: 1) the red one that identifies regions where both TOI
and BOR are outside the reference threshold; 2) the yellow area that reports regions where either TOI or
BOR are outside the threshold and 3) the green area that identifies regions where both indicators are within
the reference thresholds.
The complexity and the performance of each clinical department in the management of clinical
hospitalization cases are described, respectively, by the Case Mix (CMI) and the Performance Index (PI). In
particular, the former indicates the degree of complexity in each observed unit with respect to a benchmark
level (i.e. the national average), while the PI compares the performance of the observed unit considering the
inpatient length of stays compared to the benchmark level.
These indicators are computed according to the following formulas, taking into account the different clinical
specialties addressed by the relevant structure.

A CMI (Equation 1) lower than 1 identifies a structure that manages low-level of complexity clinical cases,
whereas a PI (Equation 2) lower than 1 identifies a structure with a high-level of efficacy. Considering the
graphical representation, these indicators are analysed adopting a four-quadrant graph where the CMI is
reported in the abscissa and the PI is reported in the ordinate compared to the national benchmark.

Results
Impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the hospital bed management in Italy
Since the beginning of the infection through the identification of the first cases in the north of Italy, the
number of patients infected closely follows an exponential trend, with a slightly change during the last week
turning from an exponential to a linear trend. This tendency is appreciable not only considering the total
number cases, but also the number of deaths, healed as well as the number of patients hospitalized in general
and in the intensive care units dislocated all over the country. Trends describing the hospitalizations are
reported in Figure 1 considering both the country as a whole and the region in particular, that still represents
the region with the highest number of cases in Italy. These trends highlight the tremendous amount of work
carried out by the healthcare professionals to host the exceptional number of patients to be hospitalized in the
health structures.

in the Intensive Care Units [3].

Although all hospital wards are struggling with an exceptional workload due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the
intensive care units are particularly stressed given that the majority of the hospitals in the northern part of the
country are saturating the hospital beds generally located in this department. Figure 2 summarized the actual
occupancy rate of the ICU beds to date (29th of March 2020). It is important to note that both the number of
beds and the number of inpatients is purely indicative: the number of beds refer to the availability of each
region in 2019 and does not take into account the epidemic, the number of patients hospitalized refers
exclusively to patients affected by COVID-19 and does not take into account patients with other pathologies.
As highlighted by the colour, different regions have had already saturated the hospital beds ordinarily
available in their intensive care units (Lombardy, Piemonte, Val d’Aosta, Trento, Bolzano), with other
regions that are worryingly approaching this threshold (Marche, Emilia Romagna, Toscana, Liguria). To be
noted that, as highlighted in the map, all of them are located in the northern part of Italy.

available hospital beds and the number of patient hospitalized affected by COVID-19. Colours span
from green to red depending on the percentage of beds occupied in the intensive care units.

Analysis of the Italian structural components
In this paragraph data collected in the years 2010 and 2017 are compared to capture difference in terms of
beds availability, number of hospitalizations and total number of inpatient days. A highlighted in Table 1, an
important reduction of the hospital beds is evident all over the Italian regions. This reduction on the same
time matches with a reduction of both number of patients hospitalized and number of days spent in the
hospital. Differences across the country can be highlighted with the highest reductions in the southern
regions. Considering the northern region heavily affected by the COVID-19, the reduction ranges from -5%
in Bolzano and Val d’Aosta to -23% in Trento, while Lombardy cuts around the 7% of hospital beds.

A different picture is shown focusing on the intensive care unit. Table 2 highlights that the availability of the
number of beds in this department did not change across years with an increasing number of beds around 6%
all over the territory. Of course, also in this analysis differences across regions can be detected. However,
only five regions have reduced the number of beds in this department with the highest cut found in Lazio,
Liguria and Piemonte (5%).

A focus on the reduction of the hospital beds in the different wards is reported in Table 3 highlighting the
disciplines that cover the 90% of the hospitalization complexity in terms of the average length of stay. As
reported in the Table only oncology and intensive care unit wards have had an increase in the number of beds
in Italy, while in other clinical specializations the reduction was even more than 20%, among which surgery,
paediatrics and otolaryngology. This indicates that, among the wards that manage complex hospital cases,
the availability of hospital beds was not affected by the funding cuts to public health. However, these crude
differences may take into account that, in the last years, many European countries have adopted policies to
strongly shift the organization and provision of health and social services from formal institutional facilities
(e.g. hospitals) to home care [17]. Moreover, recently the provision of different scheduled procedures (e.g.
diagnostic test, clinical examinations, treatments) are mainly provided in a day hospital, reducing the number
of beds needed to treat the patients.

Other differences that can be detected analysing the availability of hospital beds refers to their distribution in
the 21 regions and autonomous provinces. Figure 3 reports the number of beds per 100.000 inhabitants both
considering all disciplines (A) and focusing on the intensive care unit departments (B). The proportions vary
across the country spanning from Molise that counts the highest values for both categories to Calabria that
displays the lowest proportions. In this overall picture, while, generally, the south of Italy suffers the lack of
hospital beds, lays in the middle of the rank with 279 beds in total and 8 intensive care unit beds per 100000
inhabitants.

Hospital bed management
Table 4 reports the results obtained for each region highlighting the classification in the areas of hospital bed
management as well as case-mix and performance indicators. Green cells highlight region where the
indicators are above the relevant threshold. Note that while BOR and TOI thresholds are captured in the
literature, those for the AvLOS and BTO are computed on the basis of the national average value.
Considering the hospital bed management all regions fall within the threshold values both for the BOR and
the TOI, with the exception of Molise, Basilicata and Sardegna. Instead, regional differences can be captured
considering the AvLOS which highlights which are the regions that tend to extend the patient’s hospital stays
comparing to a national benchmarking value (i.e. Lombardy and Liguria) and the BTO that provides an
overview of the regions that have a low number of patients as a percentage of available beds (i.e. Lombardy
and Molise). The difference in the AvLOS across the country can determine the level of performance of each
region also on the basis of the complexity of cases. On the basis of these analyses, regions have been
classified in the following four macro-clusters, that mainly represent the classification of the complex and
performance indicators as reported in Figure 4:
1. Six regions (Abruzzo, Emilia Romagna, Trento, Toscana, Umbria e Basilicata) reported positive
results in the management of hospital beds. Moreover, these regions report high performances in the
treatment of complex cases, mainly due to short hospitalization with respect to the national average
length of stay.
2. The second group of regions (Calabria, Campania, Bolzano e Puglia) has similar results compared to
the above cluster, with hospitalizations efficiently managed with high performances. Differently
from the above-mentioned group, these regions tend to manage cases that are less complex.
3. Six regions (Friuli Venezia Giulia, Piemonte, Valle D’Aosta, Veneto, Liguria e Lombardy) manage
the hospital beds with a high turnover and beds that remain scarcely empty during the year.
However, this is mainly due to a high length of stay that result in a low level of performance with
respect to the national level, even if these regions mainly manage complex cases.
4. The last group is composed by four regions (Lazio, Marche, Sicilia e Sardegna). Even if they have
positive values in the hospital bed turnover and turnover interval, the performance is lower than the
national reference value also considering that these regions tend to manage less complex cases.

In this classification the Molise represents an interesting outlier given that it is the only region with both
BRO and TOI outside the efficiency thresholds. These features contribute also to the performance of the
regional hospitals even if this region tend to manage complex cases.

basis of the ratio between the CMI and PI.

The analysis reported above is presented in the following, taking into account exclusively the intensive care
unit beds and hospitalization flow. Table 5 reported the results of the hospital bed management, complexity
and performance indicators. Also in this case, green cells identify efficient regions. In this analysis the
thresholds for the four hospital bed management indicators are all defined on the basis of the national
average values, given that no reference values are available in the literature. The macro-clusters detected on
the basis of both analyses are summarized in the following (Figure 5):
1) In three regions (Calabria, Sardegna e Sicilia) all indicators report positive values with respect to the
national average ones. They manage complex cases with high performance results. Moreover, the
quick turnover and a high percentage of bed occupancy make these regions efficient also in the
management of hospital beds.
2) A consistent number of regions (Basilicata, Campania, Molise, Sicilia, Abruzzo, Puglia e Lazio)
belong to the second cluster. As reported for the previous group also these regions have a high bed
turnover and the number of days between two hospitalization are relatively low. However,

differently from the above mention group, these results are mainly due to the high number of days
that patients spend in the intensive care unit. Also for this reason, even if these regions tend to cope
with complex cases and pathologies, their performance is lower than the national one.
3) In three regions (Liguria, Toscana e Veneto) hospital beds are not efficiently managed with a low
performance in the management of not so complex cases. This is mainly due to the low complexity
of cases hospitalized with a length of stay higher than the national average value.
4) In the last group of regions (Emilia Romagna, Lombardy, Piemonte, Trento, Umbria, Val D’Aosta,
Bolzano) the majority of the hospitalization cases are not efficiently managed with a high value of
length of stay for not complex cases.
In this classification Marche represents an outlier in the management of hospital beds. Differently from the
last reported cluster it manages complex cases with a relative high performance.

Discussion and conclusions.
COVID-19 is one of the most serious respiratory pandemics of the past 100 years, its rapid global spread is
overwhelming hospitals and local communities in Italy. One of the main challenges to be faced by the Italian
hospitals is to provide hospital beds for patients affected by this virus with a particular attention of the
intensive care unit department. This is particularly evident considering that, at the moment, the majority of
the northern regions in Italy are suffering with a low number of available beds and that others presumably
saturate their capacity in the following days.
The lack of hospital beds has been attributed to a set of important cuts in the financing of public health over
the last years that also result in a reduction of hospital beds both in general and in the intensive care units on
the whole territory.

This paper provides an overview of the efficiency in the management of hospital beds across Italian regions
also highlighting whether a substantial reduction of hospital beds has been carried out recently. The results of
the overall analysis firstly show that even if an important reduction of hospital beds affects the majority of
the hospital wards, an opposite trend has been detected for the intensive care unit. This is particularly evident
considering the regions that are most effected by the virus: Lombardy +11%, Marche +12%, Piemonte -5%,
Trento +55%, Bolzano +3%, Veneto +4%.
Hospital beds are generally efficiently managed all over the country with some exceptions in the south of
Italy that show a slow turnover and/or a low bed occupancy rate. This positive result is particularly evident in
the regions of northern Italy where cases are handled with rapid shifts, also without leaving beds empty
during the year. Moreover, generally northern regions mainly deal with complex cases albeit with a
performance below the national average. On the contrary, different results are displayed analysing the
management of beds in the intensive care units, where the 75% occupancy rate threshold is not reached in all
regions. In this sense, the northern regions exhibit a high performance, even if related to the management of
less complex cases.
In conclusion this study highlights that in the recent years there has been no substation reduction of the
hospital beds located in the intensive care units. Differently other wards suffered of the financial cuts done
by national and regional governments to the public health. However, this trend may also take into account
two important factors. On the one hand, the provision of health services is now shifting from formal
institutional facilities (e.g. hospitals) to home care and, on the other hand, different scheduled procedures are
mainly provided in a day hospital reducing the number of beds needed to treat the patients. The majority of
the Italian regions and in particular those in the northern part of the country can rely on an appropriate
number of beds that generally do not saturate in periods when the patient flow is not conditioned by
catastrophic events like what we have been going through these weeks. This availability of hospital beds as
well as the efficiency in their management confirmed in this study allow hospitals to treat patients without
the risk of having an overabundance of patients and a scarcity of beds. In fact, the analysis reported in this
paper showed that, in normal situations, the management of hospital and intensive care beds has no critical
levels, while in pandemic or other catastrophic periods, the hospital management paradigms change [18]

making it necessary also to change the relationship between hospital and territory as well as to determine the
appropriate allocation of in-patient resources [19]. Considering that post-intensive care and intensive care
continuously bed availability daily changes across the land and the European countries, it is not possible to
apply this methodology in this pandemic period. However, an ex post analysis should be applied in the future
to provide indications on the hospital-territory relationship in response to widespread social problems.
