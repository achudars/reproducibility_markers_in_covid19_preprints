Abstract

19

One year in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the first vaccines are being

20

rolled out under emergency use authorizations. It is of great concern that newly emerging

21

variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can escape antibody-

22

mediated protection induced by previous infection or vaccination through mutations in the

23

spike protein. The glutamate (E) to Lysine (K) substitution at position 484 (E484K) in the

24

receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is present in the rapidly spreading variants

25

of concern belonging to the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages. We performed in vitro

26

microneutralization assays with both the USA-WA1/2020 virus and a recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-

27

2 virus that is identical to USA-WA1/2020 except for the E484K mutation introduced in the

28

spike RBD. We selected 34 sera from study participants based on their SARS-CoV-2 spike ELISA

29

antibody titer (negative [N=4] versus weak [N=8], moderate [N=11] or strong positive [N=11]).

30

In addition, we included sera from five individuals who received two doses of the Pfizer SARS-

31

CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2. Serum neutralization efficiency was lower against the E484K rSARS-

32

CoV-2 (vaccination samples: 3.4 fold; convalescent low IgG: 2.4 fold, moderate IgG: 4.2 fold and

33

high IgG: 2.6 fold) compared to USA-WA1/2020. For some of the convalescent donor sera with

34

low or moderate IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike, the drop in neutralization efficiency resulted

35

in neutralization ID50 values similar to negative control samples, with low or even absence of

36

neutralization of the E484K rSARS-CoV-2. However, human sera with high neutralization titers

37

against the USA-WA1/2020 strain were still able to neutralize the E484K rSARS-CoV-2.

38

Therefore, it is important to aim for the highest titers possible induced by vaccination to

39

enhance protection against newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Two vaccine doses may be

40

needed for induction of high antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2. Postponing the second

41

vaccination is suggested by some public health authorities in order to provide more individuals

42

with a primer vaccination. Our data suggests that this may leave vaccinees less protected

43

against newly emerging variants.

Introduction

45

One year in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the first vaccines are being rolled

46

out under emergency use authorizations. Recently, rapidly spreading variants of severe acute

47

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, have been

48

reported. It is of great concern that these newly emerging variants can escape neutralizing

49

antibodies induced by previous infection and/or vaccination through mutations in the spike (S)

50

protein, including the receptor binding domain (RBD), a target for neutralizing antibodies. We

51

and others have previously reported that the asparagine (N) to tyrosine (Y) substitution at

52

position 501 (N501Y), present in variants of concern belonging to the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1

53

lineages, does not seem to affect in vitro neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 viruses by human sera

54

from convalescent or vaccinated human donors. However, there remains concern about

55

additional substitutions like E484K present in B.1.351 and P.1 lineages allowing escape from

56

neutralizing antibodies (1–4), thereby potentially rendering vaccine-induced immunity less

57

protective.

58

In order to investigate the impact of the E484K mutation in the neutralizing activity of SARS-CoV-

59

2 specific antisera, we performed in vitro microneutralization assays with both the USA-

60

WA1/2020 virus and a recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 virus that is identical to USA-WA1/2020 except

61

for the E484K mutation introduced in the spike RBD.

62

The E484K mutant rSARS-CoV-2 was generated using previously described reverse genetics based

63

on the use of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) (5–7). The USA-WA1/2020 reflects SARS-

64

CoV-2 strains that circulated in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 34 sera were

65

selected from study participants based on their SARS-CoV-2 S enzyme linked immunosorbent

66

assay (ELISA) antibody titer (negative [N=4] versus weak [N=8], moderate [N=11] or strong

67

positive [N=11]). In addition, we included sera from five individuals who received two doses of

68

the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 (V1-V5). Demographics and available metadata for each

69

participant is summarized in Supplementary Table 1. We performed all experiments in a blinded

70

manner. The same sera have been tested for neutralization studies with a N501Y SARS-CoV-2

71

variant in our recent report (8).

72

Results

73

Sera from vaccinated donors gave high neutralization titers, similar to convalescent samples with

74

the highest neutralization titers. Serum neutralization efficiency was lower against the E484K

75

rSARS-CoV-2 (vaccination samples: 3.4 fold; convalescent low IgG: 2.4 fold, moderate IgG: 4.2

76

fold and high IgG: 2.6 fold based on geometric means) which was significantly different for the

77

convalescent sera (see Figure 1), suggesting that the single E484K mutation in the RBD affects

78

binding by serum polyclonal neutralizing antibodies from both convalescent and vaccinated

79

donors. In the case of convalescent donor sera with low or moderate IgG against SARS-CoV-2 S

80

protein, the drop in neutralization efficiency could result in neutralization ID50 values similar to

81

negative control samples, resulting in low or even absence of neutralization of the E484K

82

recombinant virus by those sera.

Figure 1. Human convalescent and post-vaccination sera neutralize E484K rSARS-CoV-2 less

85

efficient than USA-WA1/2020 in an in vitro microneutralization assay. Convalescent sera are

86

subdivided in low, moderate and high IgG classes based on anti-spike ELISA titers. Two-sided

87

Mann Whitney-U tests were performed to calculate statistical differences.

88

Conclusions

89

These data indicate that the E484K mutation present in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains that

90

belong to the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages reduces the neutralizing activity of human polyclonal sera

91

induced in convalescent (infected with previous strains) and vaccinated individuals. The

92

significant impact of a single point mutation in the neutralizing activity of polyclonal sera

93

highlights the need for the rapid characterization of SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, human sera

94

with high neutralization titers against the USA-WA1/2020 strain were still able to neutralize the

95

E484K rSARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it is important to aim for the highest titers possible induced by

96

vaccination, as this should enhance the chances for protection even in the case of antigenic drift

97

of circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. Currently deployed SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are recommended as

98

a prime-boost regimen. Because of vaccine shortage and relatively strong seroconversion being

99

observed after a single dose, some public health authorities recommended to postpone the

100

second booster vaccination in order to be able to provide more individuals with a first primer

101

vaccination. This will result in lower neutralizing antibody titers. Our data show that this may be

102

problematic in the context of newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, as it may leave some

103

vaccinees unprotected. It is currently unknown which neutralization titer correlates with (full)

104

protection, and to what extent immune mechanisms beyond direct virus neutralization

105

contribute to protection, especially for specific target groups with comorbidities that are

106

currently being prioritized for vaccination.

107

Viruses that belong to the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages have originally been described in the Republic

108

of South Africa and Brazil, but are now reported on multiple continents already. Therefore, while

109

it is premature to update vaccines based on these lineages, it is important that the worldwide

110

vaccination effort will aim at fully vaccinating as many people as possible using vaccination

111

strategies that result in induction of high neutralizing antibody titers.

50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) calculation and in vitro microneutralization assay:

177

To estimate the neutralizing efficiency of human sera, in vitro microneutralization assays were

178

performed. Human sera were inactivated at 56°C for 30 min. Serum samples were serially diluted

179

3-fold starting from 1:30 dilution in Vero-E6-infection medium (DMEM+ 2% FBS+ 1% non-

180

essential amino acids). The samples were incubated with 450 tissue culture infective dose 50

181

(TCID50) of either USA-WA1/2020 or rSARS-CoV-2 E484K for 1 hour in an incubator at 37°C, 5%

182

CO2 followed by incubation with pre-seeded Vero-E6 at 37°C for 48 hours. The plates were fixed

183

in 4% formaldehyde at 4°C overnight. For TCID50 calculation, the virus stock was serially diluted

184

10-fold starting with 1:10 dilution and incubated on Vero-E6 cells for 48 hours followed by

185

fixation in 4% Formaldehyde. The cells were washed with 1xPBS and permeabilized with 0.1%

186

Triton X-100 in 1XPBS. The cells were washed again and blocked in 5% non-fat milk in 1xPBS+

187

0.1% Tween-20 for 1 hour at room temperature. After blocking, the cells were incubated with

188

anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP and anti-spike monoclonal antibodies, mixed in 1:1 ratio, for 1.5 hours at

189

room temperature. The cells were washed in 1xPBS and incubated with 1:5000 diluted HRP-

190

conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody for 1 hour at RT followed by a brief PBS wash.

191

Finally, 100μl tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) substrate was added and incubated at RT until blue

192

color appeared, and the reaction was terminated with 50μl 1M H2SO4. Absorbance was recorded

193

at 450nm and 650nm and percentage reduction in infection was calculated as compared to

194

negative control.
