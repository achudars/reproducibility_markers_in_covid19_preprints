Abstract
Since the first suspected case of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on December 1st,
2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, a total of 40,235 confirmed cases and 909
deaths have been reported in China up to February 10, 2020, evoking fear locally and
internationally. Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei,
China from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main
epidemiological parameters. In particular, we provide an estimation of the case fatality
and case recovery ratios, along with their 90% confidence intervals as the outbreak
evolves. On the basis of a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIDR) model, we
provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R0 ), and the per day infection
mortality and recovery rates. By calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to the
reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the of the outbreak at the
epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29. As the number of infected
individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be
much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as a subset of the
actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the total population, we have
repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the
number of confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the
number of deaths unchanged. Based on the reported data, the expected value of R0 as
computed considering the period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January,
using the official counts of confirmed cases was found to be ∼4.6, while the one
computed under the second scenario was found to be ∼3.2. Thus, based on the SIRD
simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be ∼2.6 based on
confirmed cases and ∼2 based on the second scenario. Our forecasting flashes a note of
caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for
confirmed cases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected could
reach 180,000 (with lower bound of 45,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of
deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of the up to the 10th of February reported
data, the death toll might exceed 2,700 (as a lower bound) by February 29. Our
analysis further reveals a significant decline of the case fatality ratio from January 26 to
which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken
in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but mainly
because of the fact that the actual cumulative numbers of infected and recovered cases
in the population most likely are much higher than the reported ones. Thus, in a

scenario where we have taken twenty times the confirmed number of infected and forty
times the confirmed number of recovered cases, the case fatality ratio is around ∼0.15%
in the total population. Importantly, based on this scenario, simulations suggest a slow
down of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February.

Introduction

1

An outbreak of “pneumonia of unknown etiology” in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in
early December 2019 has spiraled into an epidemic that is ravaging China and
threatening to reach a pandemic state [1]. The causative agent soon proved to be a new
betacoronavirus related to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS-CoV)
and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus (SARS-CoV). The novel coronavirus
SARS-CoV-2 disease has been named “COVID-19” by the World Health Organization
(WHO) and on January 30, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared to constitute a Public
Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO Director-General [2]. Despite
the lockdown of Wuhan and the suspension of all public transport, flights and trains on
January 23, a total of 40,235 confirmed cases, including 6,484 (16.1%) with severe
illness, and 909 deaths (2.2%) had been reported in China by the National Health
Commission up to February 10, 2020; meanwhile, 319 cases and one death were
reported outside of China, in 24 countries [3]. The origin of COVID-19 has not yet been
determined although preliminary investigations are suggestive of a zoonotic, possibly of
bat, origin [4, 5]. Similarly to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the novel virus is
transmitted from person to person principally by respiratory droplets, causing such
symptoms as fever, cough, and shortness of breath after a period believed to range from
2 to 14 days following infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) [1, 6, 7]. Preliminary data suggest that older males with comorbidities
may be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 [6, 8, 9]. However, the precise
virologic and epidemiologic characteristics, including transmissibility and mortality, of
this third zoonotic human coronavirus are still unknown. Using the serial intervals (SI)
of the two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations
for the true unknown SI, Zhao et al. estimated the mean basic reproduction number
(R0 ) of SARS-CoV-2 to range between 2.24 (95% CI: 1.96-2.55) and 3.58 (95% CI:
2.89-4.39) in the early phase of the outbreak [10]. Very similar estimates, 2.2 (95% CI:
1.4-3.9), were obtained for R0 at the early stages of the epidemic by Imai et al. 2.6 (95%
CI: 1.5-3.5) [11], as well as by Li et al., who also reported a doubling in size every 7.4
days [1]. Wu et al. estimated the R0 at 2.68 (95% CI: 2.47–2.86) with a doubling time
every 6.4 days (95% CI: 5.8–7.1) and the epidemic growing exponentially in multiple
major Chinese cities with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2
weeks [12]. Amidst such an important ongoing public health crisis that also has severe
economic repercussions, we reverted to mathematical modelling that can shed light to
essential epidemiologic parameters that determine the fate of the epidemic [13]. Here,
we present the results of the analysis of time series of epidemiological data available in
the public domain [14–16] (WHO, CDC, ECDC, NHC and DXY) from January 11 to
February 10, 2020, and attempt a three-week forecast of the spreading dynamics of the
emerged coronavirus epidemic in the epicenter in mainland China.

Our analysis was based on the publicly available data of the new confirmed daily cases

values of the main epidemiological parameters, i.e. the basic reproduction number R0 ,
the case fatality (hatγ) and case recovery (β̂) ratios, along with their 90% confidence
intervals. However, as suggested [17], the number of infected, and consequently the
number of recovered, people is likely to be much higher. Thus, in a second scenario, we
have also derived results by taking twenty times the number of reported cases for the
infected and forty times the number for the recovered cases, while keeping constant the
number of deaths that is more likely to be closer to the real number. Furthermore, by
calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to fit the reported data, we also provide
tentative forecasts until the 29th of February.
The basic reproduction number (R0 ) is one of the key values that can predict
whether the infectious disease will spread into a population or die out. R0 represents
the average number of secondary cases that result from the introduction of a single
infectious case in a totally susceptible population during the infectiousness period.
Based on the reported data of confirmed cases, we provide estimations of the R0 from
the 16th up to the 20th of January in order to satisfy as much as possible the
hypothesis of S ≈ N that is a necessary condition for the computation of R0 .
We also provide estimations of the case fatality (γ̂) and case recovery (hatβ) ratios
over the entire period using a rolling window of one day from the 11th of January to the
16th of January to provide the very first estimations.
Furthermore, we calibrated the parameters of the SIRD model to fit the reported
data. We first provide a coarse estimation of the recovery (β) and mortality rates (γ) of
the SIRD model using the first period of the outbreak. Then, an estimation of the
infection rate α is accomplished by “wrapping” around the SIRD simulator an
optimization algorithm to fit the reported data from the 11th of January to the 10th of
February. We have started our simulations with one infected person on the 16th of
November, which has been suggested as a starting date of the epidemic and run the SIR
model until the 10th of February. Below, we describe analytically our approach.
Let us start by denoting with S(t), I(t), R(t), D(t), the number of susceptible,
infected, recovered and dead persons respectively at time t in the population of size N .
For our analysis, we assume that the total number of the population remains constant.
Based on the demographic data for the province of Hubei N = 59m. Thus, the discrete
SIRD model reads:

The above system is defined in discrete time points t = 1, 2, . . ., with the
corresponding initial condition at the very start of the epidemic: S(0) = N − 1,
I(0) = 1, R(0) = D(0) = 0. Here, β and γ denote the “effective/apparent” the per day
recovery and fatality rates. Note that these parameters do not correspond to the actual
per day recovery and mortality rates as the new cases of recovered and deaths come
from infected cases several days back in time. However, one can attempt to provide
some coarse estimations of the “effective/apparent” values of these epidemiological
parameters based on the reported confirmed cases using an assumption and approach
described in the next section.

Estimation of the basic reproduction number from the SIRD
model

85
86

Lets us first start with the estimation of R0 . Initially, when the spread of the epidemic
starts, all the population is considered to be susceptible, i.e. S ≈ N . Based on this
assumption, by Eq.(2),(3),(4), the basic reproduction number can be estimated by the
parameters of the SIRD model as:
R0 =

Lets us denote with ∆I(t) = I(t) − I(t − 1), ∆R(t) = R(t) − R(t − 1),
∆D(t) = D(t) − D(t − 1), the reported new cases of infected, recovered and deaths at
time t, with C∆I(t), C∆R(t), C∆D(t) the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases at
time t. Thus:
C∆X(t) =

where, X = I, R, D.
Let us also denote by ∆X(t) = [∆X(1), ∆X(2), · · · , ∆X(t)]T the t × 1 column
vector containing all the reported new cases up to time t and by
C∆X(t) = [C∆X(1), C∆X(2), · · · , C∆X(t)]T , the t × 1 column vector containing the
corresponding cumulative numbers up to time t. On the basis of Eqs.(2), (3), (4), one
can provide a coarse estimation of the parameters R0 , β and γ as follows.
Starting with the estimation of R0 , we note that as the province of Hubei has a
population of 59m, one can reasonably assume that for any practical means, at least at
the beginning of the outbreak, S ≈ N . By making this assumption, one can then
provide an approximation of the expected value of R0 using Eq.(5) and Eq.(2), Eq.(3),
Eq.(4). In particular, substituting in Eq.(2), the terms βI(t − 1) and γI(t − 1) with
∆R(t) = R(t) − R(t − 1) from Eq.(3), and ∆D(t) = D(t) − D(t − 1) from Eq.(4) and
bringing them into the left-hand side of Eq.(2), we get:
I(t) − I(t − 1) + R(t) − R(t − 1) + D(t) − D(t − 1) =

Note that one can use directly Eq.(9) to compute R0 with regression, without the
need to compute first the other parameters, i.e. β, γ and α.
At this point, the regression can be done either by using the differences per se, or by
using the corresponding cumulative functions (instead of the differences for the
calculation of R0 using Eq.(9)). Indeed, it is easy to prove that by summing up both
sides of Eq.(7) and Eq.(8) over time and then dividing them, we get the following
equivalent expression for the calculation of R0 .
C∆I(t) + C∆R(t) + C∆D(t)

Finally, assuming that for any practical means at the beginning of the spread that
S(t − 1) ≈ N and dividing Eq.(7) by Eq.(8) we get:
I(t) − I(t − 1) + R(t) − R(t − 1) + D(t) − D(t − 1)

Adding Eq.(3) and Eq.(4), we get:

Here, we used Eq. (10) to estimate R0 in order to reduce the noise included in the
differences. Note that the above expression is a valid approximation only at the
beginning of the spread of the disease.
Thus, based on the above, a coarse estimation of R0 and its corresponding
confidence intervals can be provided by solving a linear regression problem using
least-squares problem as:

121

R̂0 = ([C∆R(t) + C∆D(t)]T [C∆R(t) + C∆D(t)])−1
[C∆R(t) + C∆D(t)]T [C∆I(t) + C∆R(t) + C∆D(t)],

(11)

Estimation of the case fatality and case recovery ratios for the
period January11-February 10
Here, we denote by γ̂ the case fatality and by β̂) the case recovery ratios. Several
approaches have been proposed for the calculation of the case fatality ratio (see for
example the formula used by the National Health Commission (NHC) of the People’s
Republic of China [18] for estimating the mortality ratio for the COVID-19 and also the
discussion in [19]). Here, we adopt the one used also by the NHC which defines the case
mortality ratio as the proportion of the total cases of infected cases, that die from the
disease.
Thus, a coarse estimation of the case fatality and recovery ratios for the period under
study can be calculated using the reported cumulative infected, recovered and death
cases, by solving a linear regression problem, which for the case fatality ratio reads:

124
125

126
127
128
129
130
131
132
133
134
135

γ̂ = [C∆I(t)T C∆I(t)]−1
C∆I(t)T C∆D(t),

(12)

Accordingly, in an analogy to the above, the case recovery ratio reads:

136

β̂ = [C∆I(t)T C∆I(t)]−1
C∆I(t)T C∆R(t),

(13)

As the reported data are just a subset of the actual number of infected and
recovered cases including the asymptomatic and/or mild ones, we have repeated the
above calculations considering twenty times the reported number of infected and forty
times the reported number of recovered in the toal population, while leaving the
reported number of deaths the same given that their cataloguing is close to the actual
number of deaths due to COVID-19.

Here we note that the new cases of recovered and deaths at each time time t appear
with a time delay with respect to the actual number of infected cases. This time delay is
generally unknown but an estimate can be given by clinical studies. However, one could
also attempt to provide a coarse estimation of these parameters based only on the
reported data by considering the first period of the outbreak and in particular the
period from the 11th of January to the 16th of January where the number of infected
cases appear to be constant. Thus, based on Eqs. (3)-(4), and the above assumption,
the “effective” per day recovery rate β and the “effective” per day mortality rate γ were
computed by solving the least squares problems (see Eq.(2,4):

As noted, these values do not correspond to the actual per day mortality and
recovery rates as these would demand the exact knowledge of the corresponding time
delays. Having provide an estimation of the above “effective” approximate values of the
parameters β and γ, an approximation of the “effective” infected rate α, that is not
biased by the assumption of S = N , can be obtained by using the SIRD simulator. In
particular, in the SIRD model, the values of the β and γ parameters were set equal to
the ones found using the reported data solving the corresponding least squares problems
given by Eq.(14),(15). As initial conditions we have set one infected person on the 16th
of November and run the simulator until the last date for which there are available data
(here up to the 10th of February). Then, the optimal value of the infection rate α that
fits the reported data was found by “wrapping” around the SIRD simulator an
optimization algorithm (such as a nonlinear least-squares solver) to solve the problem:

As discussed, we have derived results using two different scenarios (see in
Methodology).For each scenario, we first present the results for the basic reproduction
number as well as the case fatality and case recovery ratios as obtained by solving the
least squares problem using a rolling window of an one-day step. For their computation,
we used the first six days i.e. from the 11th up to the 16th of January to provide the
very first estimations. We then proceeded with the calculations by adding one day in
the rolling window as described in the methodology until the 10th of February. We also
report the corresponding 90% confidence intervals instead of the more standard 95%
because of the small size of the data. For each window, we also report the

the corresponding least squares problems. Then, an estimation of the infection rate α
was obtained by “wrapping” around the SIRD simulator an optimization algorithm as
described in the previous section. Finally, we provide tentative forecasts for the
evolution of the outbreak based on both scenarios until the end of February.

Fig 2. Scenario I. Estimated values of the case fatality (γ̂) and case recovery ratios (β̂)
as computed by least squares using a rolling window. Solid lines correspond to the mean
values and dashed lines to lower and upper 90% confidence intervals
ˆ
depicted with dashed lines. Note that the large variation in the estimated values of beta
and γ̂ should be attributed to the small size of the data and data uncertainty. This is
also reflected in the corresponding confidence intervals. As more data are taken into
account, this variation is significantly reduced. Thus, using all the available data from
the 11th of January until the 10th of February, the estimated value of the case fatality
ratio γ̂ is ∼ 2.94% (90% CI: 2.9%-3%) and that of the case recovery ratio β̂ is ∼ 0.05
(90% CI: 0.046-0.055). It is interesting to note that as the available data become more,
the estimated case recovery ratio increases significantly from the 31th of January (see
Fig 2).
In Figs 3,4,5, we show the coefficients of determination (R2 ) and the root of mean
squared errors (RM SE) for R̂0 , β̂ and γ̂, respectively.
The computed approximate values of the “effective” per day mortality and recovery
rates of the SIRD model were γ ∼ 0.01 and β ∼ 0.064 (corresponding to a recovery
period of ∼ 15 d). Note that because of the extremely small number of the data used,
the confidence intervals have been disregarded. Instead, for our calculations, we have
considered intervals of 20% around the expected least squares solutions. Hence, for γ,
we have taken the interval (0.008 and 0.012) and for β, we have taken the interval
between (0.05 0.077) corresponding to recovery periods from 13 to 20 days. As
described in the methodology, we have also used the SIRD simulator to provide an
estimation of the “effective” infection rate α by optimization with w1 =1, w2 =2, w3 =2.
Thus, we performed the simulations by setting β=0.064 and γ=0.01, and as initial
conditions one infected, zero recovered and zero deaths on November 16th 2019, and run
until the 10th of February. The optimal, with respect to the reported confirmed cases
from the 11th of January to the 10th of February, value of the infected rate (α) was ∼

infected as obtained using the SIRD model. Dots correspond to the number of
confirmed cases from the 16th of January to the 10th of February. The initial date of
the simulations was the 16th of November with one infected, zero recovered and zero
deaths. Solid lines correspond to the dynamics obtained using the estimated expected
values of the epidemiological parameters α = 0.191, β = 0.064d−1 , γ = 0.01;dashed lines

0.191 (90% CI: 0.19-0.192). This corresponds to a mean value of the basic reproduction
number R̂0 ≈ 2.6. Note that this value is lower compared to the value that was
estimated using solely the reported data.
Finally, using the derived values of the parameters α, β, γ, we performed simulations
until the end of February. The results of the simulations are given in Figs6,7,8. Solid
lines depict the evolution, when using the expected (mean) estimations and dashed lines
illustrate the corresponding lower and upper bounds as computed at the limits of the
confidence intervals of the estimated parameters.
As Figs 6,7 suggest, the forecast of the outbreak at the end of February, through the
SIRD model is characterized by high uncertainty. In particular, simulations result in an
expected number of ∼ 180,000 infected cases but with a high variation: the lower bound
is at ∼ 45,000 infected cases while the upper bound is at ∼ 760,000 cases. Similarly for
the recovered population, simulations result in an expected number of ∼ 60,000, while
the lower and upper bounds are at ∼ 22,000 and ∼ 170,000, respectively. Finally,
regarding the deaths, simulations result in an average number of ∼ 9,000, with lower
and upper bounds, ∼ 2,700 and ∼ 34,000, respectively.
Thus, the expected trends of the simulations suggest that the mortality rate is lower
than the estimated with the current data and thus the death toll is expected, to be
significantly less compared with the expected trends of the predictions.

Fig 9. Scenario II. Estimated values of the basic reproduction number (R0 ) as
computed by least squares using a rolling window with initial date the 11th of January.
The solid line corresponds to the mean value and dashed lines to lower and upper 90%
confidence intervals.
As this paper was revised, the reported number of deaths on the 22th February was
2,344, while the expected number of the forecast was ∼4300 with a lower bound of
∼1,300. Regarding the number of infected and recovered cases by February 20, the
cumulative numbers of confirmed reported cases were 64,084 infected and 15,299
recovered, while the expected trends of the forecasts were ∼83,000 for the infected and
∼28,000 for the recovered cases. Hence, based on this estimation, the evolution of the
epidemic was well within the bounds of our forecasting.

Scenario II. Results obtained based by taking twenty times the
number of infected and forty times the number of recovered
people with respect to the confirmed cases
For our illustrations, we assumed that the number of infected is twenty times the
number of the confirmed infected and forty times the number of the confirmed
recovered people. Based on this scenario, Fig 9 depicts an estimation of R0 for the
period January 16-January 20. Using the first six days from the 11th of January to the
16th of January, R̂0 results in 3.2 (90% CI: 2.4-4.0); using the data until January 17, R̂0
results in 3.1 (90% CI: 2.5-3.7); using the data until January 18, R̂0 results in 3.4 (90%
CI: 2.9-3.9); using the data until January 19, R̂0 results in 3.9 (90% CI: 3.3-4.5) and
using the data until January 20, R̂0 results in 4.5 (90% CI: 3.8-5.3).
It is interesting to note that the above estimation of R0 is close enough to the one
reported in other studies (see in the Introduction for a review).

Fig 10. Scenario II. Estimated values of case fatality (γ̂) and case recovery (β̂) ratios,
as computed by least squares using a rolling window (see section ??). Solid lines
correspond to the mean values and dashed lines to lower and upper 90% confidence
intervals
ratios for the period January 16 to February 10. The confidence intervals are also
depicted with dashed lines. Note that the large variation in the estimated values of β̂
and γ̂ should be attributed to the small size of the data and data uncertainty. This is
also reflected in the corresponding confidence intervals. As more data are taken into
account, this variation is significantly reduced. Thus,using all the (scaled) data from the
11th of January until the 10th of February, the estimated value of the case fatality ratio
γ̂ now drops to ∼ 0.147% (90% CI: 0.144%-0.15%) while that of the case recovery ratio
is ∼ 0.1 (90% CI: 0.091-0.11). It is interesting also to note, that as the available data
become more, the estimated case recovery ratio increases slightly (see Fig 10), while the
case fatality ratio (in the total population) seems to be stabilized at a rate of ∼ 0.15%.
In Figs 11,12,13, we show the coefficients of determination (R2 ) and the root of
mean squared errors (RM SE), for R̂0 , β̂ and γ̂, respectively.
The computed values of the “effective” per day mortality and recovery rates of the
SIRD model were γ ∼ 0.0005 and β ∼ 0.16 d−1 (corresponding to a recovery period of
∼ 6 d). Note that because of the extremely small number of the data used the
confidence intervals have been disregarded. Instead, for calculating the corresponding
lower and upper bounds in our simulations, we have taken intervals of 20% around the
expected least squares solutions. Hence, for γ we have taken the interval (0.0004 and
0.0006) and for β, we have taken the interval between (0.13 0.19) corresponding to an
interval of recovery periods from 5 to 8 days.
Again, we used the SIRD simulator to provide estimation of the infection rate by
optimization setting w1 = 1, w2 = 400, w3 = 1 to balance the residuals of deaths with
the scaled numbers of the infected and recovered cases. Thus, to find the optimal

simulations was the 16th of November with one infected, zero recovered and zero deaths.
Solid lines correspond to the dynamics obtained using the estimated expected values of

infection run, we used the SIRD simulations with β = 0.16d−1 , and γ = 0.0005 and as
initial conditions one infected, zero recovered, zero deaths on November 16th 2019, and
run until the 10th of February.
The optimal, with respect to the reported confirmed cases from the 11th of January
to the 10th of February value of the infected rate (α) was found to be ∼ 0.319(90% CI:
0.318-0.32). This corresponds to a mean value of the basic reproduction number R̂0 ≈ 2.
Finally, using the derived values of the parameters α, β, γ, we have run the SIRD
simulator until the end of February. The simulation results are given in Figs 14,15,16.
Solid lines depict the evolution, when using the expected (mean) estimations and
dashed lines illustrate the corresponding lower and upper bounds as computed at the
limits of the confidence intervals of the estimated parameters.
Again as Figs 15,16 suggest, the forecast of the outbreak at the end of February,
through the SIRD model is characterized by high uncertainty. In particular, in Scenario
II, by February 29, simulations result in an expected actual number of ∼8m infected
cases (corresponding to a 13% of the total population) with a lower bound at ∼720,000
and an upper bound at ∼37m cases. Similarly, for the recovered population, simulations
result in an expected actual number of ∼4.5m, while the lower and upper bounds are at
∼430,000 and ∼23m, respectively. Finally, regarding the deaths, simulations under this
scenario result in an average number of ∼14,000, with lower and upper bounds at ∼900

Fig 16. Scenario II. Simulations until the 29th of February of the cumulative number
of deaths as obtained using the SIRD model. Dots correspond to the number of
confirmed cases from the 16th of November to the 10th of February. The initial date of
the simulations was the 16th of November with zero infected, zero recovered and zero
deaths. Solid lines correspond to the dynamics obtained using the estimated expected
values of the epidemiological parameters α = 0.319, β = 0.16d−1 , γ = 0.0005; dashed
lines correspond to the lower and upper bounds derived by performing simulations on
the limits of the confidence intervals of the parameters.

and ∼100,000. This finding suggests an even lower value of the per day mortality rate
in the total population, than the one computed.
Importantly, under this scenario, the simulations shown in Fig ?? suggest a decline
of the outbreak at the end of February. Table 1 summarizes the above results for both
scenarios.
We note, that the results derived under Scenario II seem to predict a slow down of
the outbreak in Hubei after the end of February.

We have proposed a methodology for the estimation of the key epidemiological
parameters as well as the modelling and forecasting of the spread of the COVID-19
epidemic in Hubei, China by considering publicly available data from the 11th of
January 2019 to the 10th of February 2020.
By the time of the acceptance of our paper, according to the official data released on
the 29th of February, the cumulative number confirmed infected cases in Hubei was
∼67,000, that of recovered was ∼31,300 and the death toll was ∼2,800. These numbers
are within the lower bounds and expected trends of our forecasts from the 10th of
February that are based on Scenario I. Importantly, by assuming a 20-fold scaling of the
confirmed cumulative number of the infected cases and a 40-fold scaling of the
confirmed number of the recovered cases in the total population, forecasts show a
decline of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February. Based on this scenario the case
fatality rate in the total population is of the order of ∼0.15%.
However, we should also point out the high uncertainty in the three-weeks ahead
predictions as reflected by the big deviation between the lower and upper bounds of the
simulations at the end of the forecasting period. At this point we should note that our
SIRD modelling approach did not take into account many factors that play an
important role in the dynamics of the disease such as the effect of the incubation period
in the transmission dynamics, the heterogeneous contact transmission network, the
effect of the measures already taken to combat the epidemic, the characteristics of the
population (e.g. the effect of the age, people who had already health problems). Also
the estimation of the model parameters is based on an assumption, considering just the
first period in which the first cases were confirmed and reported. Of note, COVID-19,
which is thought to be principally transmitted from person to person by respiratory
droplets and fomites without excluding the possibility of the fecal-oral route [21] had
been spreading for at least over a month and a half before the imposed lockdown and
quarantine of Wuhan on January 23, having thus infected unknown numbers of people.
The number of asymptomatic and mild cases with subclinical manifestations that
probably did not present to hospitals for treatment may be substantial; these cases,
which possibly represent the bulk of the COVID-19 infections, remain unrecognized,
especially during the influenza season [22]. This highly likely gross under-detection and
underreporting of mild or asymptomatic cases inevitably throws severe disease courses
calculations and death rates out of context, distorting epidemiologic reality. Another
important factor that should be taken into consideration pertains to the diagnostic
criteria used to determine infection status and confirm cases. A positive PCR test was
required to be considered a confirmed case by China’s Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia
Diagnosis and Treatment program in the early phase of the outbreak [14]. However, the
sensitivity of nucleic acid testing for this novel viral pathogen may only be 30-50%,
thereby often resulting in false negatives, particularly early in the course of illness. To
complicate matters further, the guidance changed in the recently-released fourth edition
of the program on February 6 to allow for diagnosis based on clinical presentation, but
only in Hubei province [14]. The swiftly growing epidemic seems to be overwhelming

even for the highly efficient Chinese logistics that did manage to build two new
hospitals in record time to treat infected patients. Supportive care with extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in intensive care units (ICUs) is critical for severe
respiratory disease. Large-scale capacities for such level of medical care in Hubei
province, or elsewhere in the world for that matter, amidst this public health emergency
may prove particularly challenging. We hope that the results of our analysis contribute
to the elucidation of critical aspects of this outbreak so as to contain the novel
coronavirus as soon as possible and mitigate its effects regionally, in mainland China,
and internationally.

In the digital and globalized world of today, new data and information on the novel
coronavirus and the evolution of the outbreak become available at an unprecedented
pace. Still, crucial questions remain unanswered and accurate answers for predicting the
dynamics of the outbreak simply cannot be obtained at this stage. We emphatically
underline the uncertainty of available official data, particularly pertaining to the true
baseline number of infected (cases), that may lead to ambiguous results and inaccurate
forecasts by orders of magnitude, as also pointed out by other investigators [1, 17, 22].
