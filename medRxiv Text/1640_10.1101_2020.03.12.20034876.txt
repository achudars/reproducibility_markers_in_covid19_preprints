Summary
Background

Since late December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, that
began in Wuhan, has become endemic in China and more than 100 countries and regions in the
world. So far, there is rare data on the prevalence of COVID-19 in patients with chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML). We aimed to describe the clinical course, outcomes of CML
patients with COVID-19 and prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients.
Methods

In this multicentre, cross-sectional survey, the clinical data of CML patients with COVID-19 in
each center were collected. Simultaneously, an online survey was conducted for information
about the CML patients under the management at each center by asking the CML patients to
complete a questionnaire,from February 15, 2020 to February 21, 2020. The questionnaire
includes demographic data, place of residence, smoking status, CML diagnosis and treatment,
comorbidities, combined medications, epidemiological history, symptoms(fever, cough, shortness
of breath, etc) during the epidemic. Additional clinical data was collected on respondents
suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. We described and analyzed the prevalence of
COVID-19 in CML patients, and focus on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19
patients. Data were compared between the CML patients with optimal response and those with
non-optimal response. The primary outcome was prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients, as of
Feb 21, 2020. Secondary outcomes included the history of epidemiology of CML patients, the
clinical characteristics and outcomes of CML patients with COVID-19 .
Findings

Of 392 respondents, 223( 56.9%) were males, and 240( 61.2%) were 50 years or younger.
Only 10 patients took drugs irregularly due to the influence of the epidemic because of traffic
control, pharmacies unable to operate normally, etc. In the history of epidemiology, there were 4
patients with definite contact with COVID-19, of which 3 were remote contact and 1 was close
contact. 12 respondents had fever, cough or shortness of breath during the epidemic, 1 case

(common type) was confirmed with COVID-19 and cured after treatment. 1 patient was clinically
diagnosed and succumbed. 1 of 299 (0.3%) patients with an optimal response was diagnosed
with COVID-19. Of the 50 patients who failed to respond to CML treatment or had a poor
response, 1 patient (2%) had a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.
Interpretation

While the 392 CML respondents required regular referrals to hospitals, they did not have
much contact with COVID-19 patients during the outbreak. Patients who failed to achieved an
optimal response to CML therapy appear more likely to have a symptomatic infection with
SARS-CoV-2. Older patients with comorbidities are at increased risk of death.

Introduction
Since late December 2019, the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
in Wuhan, China, has been endemic in China and more than 100 countries and regions in the
world.1-7 By March 1, 2020, China had reported a total of 80,026 confirmed cases of novel
coronavirus disease, with 2,912 deaths. In Hubei province which is still the core area of the
COVID-19 epidemic in China there were 67,103 cases, accounting for 83.9% of total Chinese cases.
The number of confirmed cases in South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, Japan and other countries
continues to rise.
Some studies have suggest that cancer patients are more susceptible to infection with
SARS-CoV-2 than healthy people and have a worse prognosis because their immune systems are
8

suppressed by the effects of the tumors and anti-cancer treatment . But this view is
controversial

9,10

.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a neoplastic disease of hematopoietic stem cells
that has an annual incidence of 0.4-1.75/100,000

11-15

and accounts for 15% of adult leukemia.

Since imatinib and subsequent generations of newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been
used with CML, the prognosis of CML patients has improved significantly. In fact, CML patients
are currently approaching normal life expectancy. However, as the survival rates of CML patients

improves, the prevalence of CML is increasing. The prevalence of CML in France is estimated to
16

reach 18 / 100,000 in 2018 and 24 / 100,000 in 2030 . We sought to determine whether CML
patients have been as susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 as other cancer patients during the current
epidemic, and what their prognosis has been. Standardized management of this large number of
patients has become a new challenge for our hematologists. In order to optimize the care of CML
patients as the pandemic spreads, it is therefore essential to understand the characteristics of
SARS-CoV-2 infections in CML patients and the experience of their management in Hubei
province.

Methods:
Study design and participants

When the outbreak started, the 29 centers of the Hubei Anti-Cancer Association Chronic
Myeloid Leukemia Standardized Management Collaboration Group adopted comprehensive
management measures for CML patients. Various kinds of online consultation, online smart
hospitals and online courses were made available to provide patients with information while they
remained at home. Individualized treatment schemes were proposed according to the clinical
situation of each patient. It was recommended that all patients, especially those with stable
conditions, refrain from leaving their homes, and even avoid going to hospitals. Volunteers were
organized to deliver drugs to CML patients in their homes in order to ensure their normal
treatment would not be interrupted. Patients with COVID-19-related symptoms were promptly
diagnosed and treated accordingly.
All patients were diagnosed with 2019 novel coronavirus disease, according to WHO interim
guidance17 or the 5th version of the novel coronavirus infection pneumonia diagnosis and
treatment (The National health commission, People's Republic of China)18 . Laboratory
confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed by the local health authority. Identification
of COVID-19 patients was achieved by reviewing and analysing admission logs and histories from
all available electronic medical records and patient care resources. Efficacy of CML was assessed
according to the 2020 ELN guidelines19. The investigation was approved by the ethics committee
of Union hospital, Tongji Medical college, Huazhong University of science and Technology.
Data collection

From February 15, 2020 to February 21, 2020, the clinical data of CML patients with
COVID-19 in each center were collected. Simultaneously, an online survey was conducted for
information about the CML patients under the management at each center by asking the CML
patients to complete a questionnaire. A total of 413 questionnaires were collected, of which 392
were valid, but 21 of these were excluded because the respondents did not live in Hubei province
during the outbreak. The questionnaire asked about general demographic characteristics, place
of residence, smoking status, CML diagnosis and treatment, comorbidities, combined
medications, epidemiological history, and symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, etc.
during the epidemic. Additional clinical data was collected on respondents suspected or
confirmed to have COVID-19. Any missing or uncertain records were collected and clarified
through direct communication with involved health-care providers and their families.
Outcomes

The primary outcome was prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients, as of Feb 21, 2020.
Secondary outcomes included the history of epidemiology of CML patients, the clinical
characteristics and outcomes of CML patients with COVID-19.
Statistical analysis

The aim of this study is to report prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients. COVID-19
infection in CML patients with different efficacy was compared. We also report the clinical
courses and clinical outcomes of the COVID-19 patients. There were, therefore, no formal
hypotheses being implemented to drive the sample size calculation and we included the
maximum number of patients who met the inclusion criteria.

Results
A total of 413 questionnaires were collected, of which 392 were valid. Among them, 21
questionnaires were excluded because the respondents did not live in Hubei province during the
outbreak. The following is the general situation of the respondents. There were 223 males,
accounting for 56.9%, and 61.2% of the respondents were 50 years or younger. The age
distribution chart is shown in Table 1. The other details are shown in Table 2. The epidemiological
history is shown in Table 3. Specific data of clinical diagnosis and confirmed patients are shown in
table 4.

The survey found that 12 respondents had fever, cough or shortness of breath during the
epidemic period, and 9 of them did not go to the hospital because their symptoms were mild or
remitted with oral medication. Three people went to the hospital for treatment. After chest CT
scan and SARS-CoV-2 quantitative RT-PCR testing, one of these three patients was confirmed to
have of COVID-19 infection and was treated and cured. COVID-19 infection was excluded in a
second patient. The third patient was clinically diagnosed based on the 5th version of the novel
coronavirus infection pneumonia diagnosis and treatment (National Health Commission of the
People's Republic of China) that was used at the time. This patient, who was clinically diagnosed
and treated as a confirmed case, was an 89-year-old female with coronary heart disease and
long-term ACEI treatment. She was diagnosed CML (Chronic phase) in January 2009. Before 2015,
she did not take imatinib regularly due to side effects and the efficacy evaluation was failure.
After 2015, regular dose reduction of imatinib (200mg per day) was started. The latest BCR-ABL
fusion gene was quantified at 0.37% in December 2019. In early February 2020, after initially
having a cough, she quickly developed dyspnea that was not relieved with oxygen therapy at
home. She was admitted to the emergency department where she was found to have extreme
lymphocytopenia, respiratory failure, renal insufficiency, and myocardial damage. Her condition
rapidly deteriorated and she succumbed after three days of hospitalization. This is consistent with
previous reports that elderly patients with comorbidities have a poor prognosis and high
mortality20-22, and the degree of lymphopenia is related to the severity of the disease.
Another CML patient with a confirmed COVID-19 infection was a 47-year-old male. He was
initially diagnosed with CML (accelerated phase) in January 2010. Treatment with imatinib was
irregular after diagnosis. In 2015, dasatinib was replaced due to treatment failure. In March 2019,
the efficacy evaluation was failure: the BCR-ABL fusion gene quantification was 25.47%, the
chromosome was 46, XY, t (9;22) (q34;q11) [10] /47, XY, +8 [10] and there was a T315I mutation.
He participated in an ongoing clinical trial of an alternative CML treatment (HQP1351) in May
2019 and achieved complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR) in July 2019. The chromosome was 47,
XY, +8 [20], and the fusion gene quantification was 0.49%. Major molecular remission (MMR) was
achieved in August 2019, and complete molecular remission (MR4.5) was achieved in October
2019. Although he obtained an optimal response, he was not taking TKIs during the outbreak due
to side effects. In mid-february 2020, he presented with cough and fever and was found to be

Discussion
While the 392 CML respondents required regular referrals to hospitals, they did not have much
contact with COVID-19 patients during the outbreak, mainly due to the government policy of
prevention and control.
We then analyzed SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients based on their response to anti-CML
therapy (see Table 5 for details), and found that only 1 of 299 (0.3%) patients with an optimal
response was diagnosed with COVID-19. Of the 50 patients who failed to respond to CML
treatment or had a poor response, 1 patient (2%) had a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.

Thus

patients who failed to achieved an optimal response to CML therapy appear more likely to have a
symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2.

This tendency requires further study, but there are

two possibilities that might explain it. First, an optimal response to TKI treatment may be
associated with immune recovery. CML patients exhibit selective depletion of effector T reg cells
(eT reg cells)

23,24

25

, while TKIs increase the number of natural killer cells (NK), NK-LGL and T-LGLs

cells , which play a role in regulating immunity.

Second, previous studies have reported that

imatinib and other TKI drugs have antiviral activity in vitro against Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-COV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-COV)

26-28

. It will be interesting to see if TKIs also have activity against anti-SARS-CoV-2.

We analyzed the 82 respondents living in Wuhan and found that there was 1 clinically
diagnosed case (1.2%).

Of the Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan, 8/565 (1.4%) had a
29

confirmed infection with COVID-19 . Among 310 CML living patients in Hubei province outside of
Wuhan, 1 case of infection (0.32%) was diagnosed.
In summary, through the Hubei Anti-Cancer Association Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
Standardized Management Collaboration Group, we conducted online consultations, online
smart hospitals and online courses to provide information, diagnosis and treatment to patients
during the epidemic, and organized volunteers to deliver drugs to CML patients at their homes.
The sample size of the study was relatively small and should be expanded to more accurately
compare the prevalence of the infection in the different groups. Nevertheless, our findings
suggest that standardized management to obtain the best clinical response reduces the risk of
SARS-CoV-2 infection and improves the prognosis of those who are infected. CML is a chronic
hematologic tumor, and comprehensive measures should be taken to delay and reduce the risk of
infection by restricting patient exposure to situations with possible transmission. During the
epidemic, special attention should be focused on those CML patients who are older, have
co-morbidities and whose response to CML treatment is non-optimal.
