Abstract

2

Objective: To estimate the ascertainment rate of novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

3

Methods: We analyzed the epidemiological dataset of confirmed cases with

4

COVID-19 in Japan as of 28 February 2020. A statistical model was constructed

5

to describe the heterogeneity of reporting rate by age and severity. We estimated

6

the number of severe and non-severe cases, accounting for under-ascertainment.

7

Results: The ascertainment rate of non-severe cases was estimated at 0.44 (95%

8

confidence interval: 0.37, 0.50), indicating that unbiased number of non-cases

9

would be more than twice the reported count.

10

Conclusions: Severe cases are twice more likely diagnosed and reported than

11

other cases. Considering that reported cases are usually dominated by non-severe

12

cases, the adjusted total number of cases is also about a double of observed count.

13

Our finding is critical in interpreting the reported data, and it is advised to

14

interpret mild case data of COVID-19 as always under-ascertained.

Introduction

2

As of 1 March 2020, a total of 58 countries reported at least one

3

confirmed case of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the cumulative

4

number of deaths reached 2977 persons across the world (WHO, 2020). To attain

5

appropriate countermeasures, it is vital to understand current epidemiological

6

situations of the COVID-19 epidemic.

7

The majority of COVID-19 cases exhibit limited severity; 81% of

8

reported cases in China has been mild and only 16% are severe (Guan et al.,

9

2020). It is natural that the ascertainment rate would be different between severe

10

and non-severe cases. The present study aims to estimate the ascertainment rate

11

of non-severe cases, employing a statistical model.

12

Methods

13

We analyzed the epidemiological dataset of confirmed cases with

14

COVID-19 in Japan as of 28 February 2020. The confirmatory diagnosis was

15

made by means of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

16

The present study specifically analyzed cases by (i) prefecture, (ii) age, and (iii)

17

severity. Severe case was defined as (i) severe dyspnea that required oxygen

18

support plus pneumonia or intubation or (ii) case that required management in

19

intensive care unit.

20

We estimated the number of severe and non-severe cases using the ratio

21

of non-severe to severe reported cases (Guan et al., 2020, Novel, 2020). We

22

estimated the ascertainment rate among non-severe cases by 1/k, describing data

23

generating process of both severe and non-severe generated from Poisson process

24

with probabilities px,a for severe cases and kfapx,a for non-severe cases in age

where Nx,a , Dns,x,a and Ds,x,a represent the population size, the observed counts of

Maximum likelihood estimates were obtained by maximizing the equation (1)

8

and the profile likelihood-based confidence intervals were computed.

Results

10

The ascertainment rate of non-severe cases, k, was estimated at 0.44 (95%

11

confidence interval (CI): 0.37, 0.50). Resulting estimate of non-severe cases is

12

shown in Figure 1A, showing along with reasonably good fit to severe case data

13

in Figure 1B. Age-specific pattern of estimated non-severe cases was similar to

14

that among severe cases. The largest estimated number of non-severe cases was

15

80 cases (95% CI: 63, 98) among those aged 50-59 years and 78 (95% CI: 61,

16

95) among cases aged 60-69 years, respectively. Such adjustment gives adjusted

17

estimate of the total cases by age group.

18

Discussion

19

The present study estimated the ascertainment-adjusted number of cases in

20

Japan, using age-specific severe fraction of cases. We assumed that the ratio of

21

severe to non-severe cases in a given age group is a constant and that the age-

22

independent gap is explained by the under-diagnosis and under-reporting,

23

estimating the ascertainment rate among non-severe cases to be 0.44.

1

As a take home, it must be remembered that severe cases are twice more

2

likely diagnosed and reported than other cases. Reported cases are usually

3

dominated by non-severe cases, and the adjusted total number of cases is about a

4

double of observed count. Our finding is critical in interpreting the reported data,

5

and it is advised to regard the mild case data as always under-ascertained.

6

In addition to the proposed adjustment, it should be noted that the

7

ascertainment rate of severe cases needs to be additionally estimated, and such

8

estimation requires direct measurement of the total number of cases or infected

9

individuals by means of seroepidemiological study or other testing methods of all

10

samples (Nishiura et al., 2020). That is, the actual total number of cases is greater

11

than what it was adjusted in the present study. Using seroepidemiological

12

datasets, we plan to address relevant issues in the future. Other limitations

13

include that (i) we did not explore detailed natural history, e.g. dynamically

14

changing symptoms over the course of infection, and underlying comorbidities,

15

(ii) we ignored right-censored data, e.g. the time delay from illness onset to

16

severe manifestations, for simplicity. The latter led us to underestimate the

17

ascertainment rate. (iii) it is worth noting that the data of age dependent severity

18

employed in our analysis is only based on the observed data in China.

19

Considering the possibility of underreporting or biased age distribution, the

20

nature of this age distribution may lead to underestimation.

21

Despite multiple future tasks, we believe that the present study successfully

22

demonstrated that the ascertainment rate can be partly adjusted by examining

23

age-dependent number of cases including severe cases. The proposed adjustment

24

should be practiced in other country settings and also for other diseases.
