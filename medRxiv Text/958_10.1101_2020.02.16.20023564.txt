We collected the daily cumulative number of confirmed cases (from Jan 21, 2020 to Feb 14, 2020)
infected by SARS-CoV-2 from official websites of the National Health Commission of China and

An ongoing outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) is hitting Wuhan City and has spread to other provinces/cities of China and overseas. It very
urgent to forecast the future course of the outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the potential
total number of confirmed cases in mainland China by applying Boltzmann-function based
regression analyses. We found that the cumulative number of confirmed cases from Jan 21 to Feb
14, 2020 for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City and other provinces were all well
fitted with the Boltzmann function (R2 being close to 0.999). The potential total number of
confirmed cases in the above geographic regions were estimated at 95% confidence interval (CI)
as 79589 (71576, 93855), 64817 (58223, 77895), 46562 (40812, 57678) and 13956 (12748,
16092), respectively. Notably, our results suggest that the number of daily new confirmed cases
of SARS-CoV-2 in mainland China (including Hubei Province) will become minimal between
Feb 28 and Mar 10, 2020, with 95% CI. In addition, we found that the data of cumulative
confirmed cases of 2003 SARS-CoV in China and Worldwide were also well fitted to the
Boltzmann function. To our knowledge this is the first study revealing that the Boltzmann
function is suitable to simulate epidemics. The estimated potential total number of confirmed
cases and key dates for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak may provide certain guidance for governments,
organizations and citizens to optimize preparedness and response efforts.

An outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the zoonotic 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) is on-going in China [1]. As of Feb 12, 2020 (24:00, GMT+8), there have been 59901
confirmed patients and 1368 deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection, in China, and the most affected
city, Wuhan, and related regions in Hubei province of China have reported 48206 confirmed
patients and 1310 deaths. Cases infected in Wuhan were also detected in other provinces of China
as well as in many foreign countries or regions including Japan, the Republic of Korea, Canada,
USA, and European countries [2-4]. This SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was declared as a public health
emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Jan 30 [5].
Much research progress has been made in dissecting the evolution and origin of SARS-CoV-2 [68], as well as characterizing its clinical features [9-15] and epidemics [16-19] in the past one and
half months . These efforts would significantly guide us to contain the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
While the outbreak is on-going, people raise grave concerns about the future trajectory of the
outbreak, especially given that the working and schooling time has been already dramatically
postponed after the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday was over (scheduled on Jan 31). It is highly
demanding to estimate the potential total number of confirmed cases, both nationally and locally.
Here we present Boltzmann function-based regression analyses on the data of confirmed cases of
SARS-CoV-2 in China. Results indicate that the daily reported cumulative number of confirmed
cases of SARS-CoV-2 regarding every defined region in China (including Hubei Province,
Wuhan city, other top-6 most affected provinces and top-4 major cities) could be fitted well with
Boltzmann function. Subsequent forecasting the trend of cumulative confirmed cases in each
region can be made, which may be helpful for governments, organizations and citizens to
optimize their preparedness and response efforts.

included in our simulation due to the small number of confirmed cases. The cumulative number

Data fitting with Boltzmann function and estimation of critical dates
Data were organized in Microsoft Excel and then incorporated into Microcal Origin software
(note: 2021 Jan 21 was set as day 1 and so on). The Boltzmann function was applied to data
simulation for each set of data regarding different geographic regions (e.g.., China, Hubei
Province and so on) and parameters of each function were obtained, with the potential total
number of confirmed cases being directly given by parameter A2. Estimation of critical dates was
performed by predicting the cumulative number of confirmed cases in the coming days post Feb
14, 2020, and the key dates were provisionally set when the number of daily new confirmed cases
is lower than 0.1% of the potential total number. The Boltzmann function for simulation is
expressed as follows:

where C(x) is the cumulative number of confirmed cases at day x; A1, A2, x0, and dx are constants.
In particular, A2 represents the estimated potential total number of confirmed cases of SARSCoV-2. Details of derivation of the Boltzmann function for epidemic analysis are described in the

Estimation of uncertainty in the non-linear regression
A Monte Carlo technique is applied to assess the uncertainty in the estimated total number of
confirmed cases due to the uncertainty in the reported number cases. 1000 non-linear regressions
were performed with the same time series data but each data point in the time series was perturbed
by multiplying with a random scaling factor that represents the relative uncertainty. We assumed
that the relative uncertainty follows a single-sided normal distribution with a mean of 1.0 and a
standard deviation of 10%. This implies that all reported cases are positive but there is a tendency
to miss-reporting some positive cases so that the reported numbers represent a lower limit. The
resulting mean and 95% confidence interval (CI) were presented.

In light of daily reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 since Jan 21, 2020, we decided to collect data for
analysis on the cumulative number of confirmed cases (initially from Jan 21 to Feb 10, 2020) in
several typical regions of China, including the center of the outbreak (i.e. Wuhan City and Hubei
Province), other top provinces ranking in the number of cases (i.e., Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan,
Hunan, Anhui, and Jiang Provinces) and top-4 major cities in China (i.e., Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Shenzhen).
During data analysis on Feb 13, 2020, the number of new confirmed cases on Feb 12 in Hubei
Province and Wuhan City suddenly increased by 14840 and 13436, respectively, of which 13332
and 12364 are those confirmed by clinical features (note: all the number of confirmed cases
released by Feb 12 were counted according to the result of viral nucleic acid detection rather than
by referring to clinical features). Afterward, new confirmed cases determined by clinical criteria
in Hubei Province on Feb 13 and 4 are still up to 2052 and 1138. In view of these, we arbitrarily
distributed these suddenly added cases to the reported cumulative number of confirmed cases
from Jan 21 to Feb 14 for Hubei Province by a fixed factor (refer to Table S1), assuming that
these newly added cases were linearly accumulative in those days. It is the same forth with the
data for Wuhan City.

Fitting analyses using Boltzmann function indicate that all sets of data were well fitted with the
function (all R2 values being close to 0.999; Figs. 1, 2 and S1). Parameter A2 in the Boltzmann
function directly represents the potential total number of confirmed cases (refer to equation 1).
As summarized in Table 1, the potential total number of confirmed cases for mainland China,
Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and other provinces were estimated as 72800¬±600, 59300¬±600,
42100¬±700 and 12800¬±100; respectively (also refer to Fig. 1); those for the six mostly influenced
provinces (Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan, Hunan, Anhui and Jiangxi) were 1300¬±10, 1170¬±10,
1260¬±10, 1050¬±10, 1020¬±10 and 940¬±10, respectively (also refer to Fig. 2); those for the top-4
major cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen) were 394¬±4, 328¬±3, 337¬±3 and 397¬±4,
respectively (also refer to Fig. S1).

The above analyses were performed assuming that the released data on the confirmed cases are
precise. However, there is a tendency to miss-report some positive cases such that the reported
numbers represent a lower limit. One typical example indicating this uncertainty is the sudden
increase of more than 13 000 new confirmed cases in Hubei province on Feb 12 after clinical
features were officially accepted as a standard for infection confirmation. Another uncertainty
might result from insufficient kits for viral nucleic acid detection at the early stage of the outbreak.
We thus examined the effects of the uncertainty of the released data on the estimation of the
potential total number of confirmed cases using a Monte Carlo method (for detail, refer to the
Methods section). For simplicity, we assumed that the relative uncertainty of the reported data
follows a single-sided normal distribution with a mean of 1.0 and a standard deviation of 10%.

In addition, we estimated the key date, on which the number of daily new confirmed cases is
lower than 0.1% of the potential total number of confirmed cases as defined by us subjectively.
As summarized in Table 1, the key dates for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City and
other provinces are Feb28 or Feb 27. It appears that it will take approximately two weeks for
mainland China to reach this state such that the number of daily new confirmed cases of SARSCoV-2 post the critical date is below 70.

Under the above conditions, the potential total numbers of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 for
different regions were estimated (Figs. 3, S2 and S3) and summarized in Table 1. The potential
total numbers for China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City and other provinces were 79589 (95% CI
71576, 93855), 64817 (58223, 77895), 46562 (40812, 57678) and 13956 (12748, 16092),
respectively (also refer to Fig. 3); those for the six most affected provinces (Guangdong, Zhejiang,
Henan, Hunan, Anhui and Jiangxi) were 1415 (1324, 1550), 1269 (1204, 1364), 1372 (1271,
1559), 1140 (1050, 1279), 1110 (1021, 1273) and 1024 (948, 1146), respectively (also refer to
Fig. S2); those for top-4 major cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen) were 429
(395, 486), 356 (334, 388), 365 (346, 393) and 430 (407, 461), respectively (also refer to Fig. S3).
Such uncertainty analysis also allowed us to estimate the key dates at 95% CI. As summarized in
Table 1, the key dates for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and other provinces
would fall in (2/28, 3/10), (2/27, 3/10), (2/28, 3/10) and (2/27, 3/13), respectively (also refer to
Fig. 3); those for the six provinces (Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan, Hunan, Anhui and Jiangxi)
were within (2/22, 3/01), (2/21, 2/27), (2/26, 3/09), (2/28, 3/11), (2/27, 3/09) and (2/27, 3/07),
respectively (also refer to Fig. S2); those for top-4 major cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou
and Shenzhen) were within (2/25, 3/11), (2/22, 3/01), (2/20, 2/28) and (2/17, 2/25), respectively
(also refer to Fig. S3).

The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has undoubtedly caused the memories of the SARS-CoV
outbreak in 2003. Prompted by the above observation that the data of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak
so far were well fitted to Boltzmann function, we thus applied this function to fit the epidemic of
2003 SARS-CoV in China and worldwide. Results in Fig. 4 show that the cumulative numbers
of confirmed cases of 2003 SARS-CoV both in China and worldwide were fitted well with the
Boltzmann distribution function, with R2 being 0.999 and 0.998, respectively.

Discussion and conclusion
It is of significance to estimate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak originating in Wuhan,
China. In particular, a precise estimation of the potential total number of infected cases and/or
confirmed cases is critical for optimal preparedness and implementation of infection control
practices made by governments nationally and locally. An earlier study published on 17 January
2020 [18] suggested that a total of 1,723 cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan City (95% CI: 4274,471) had onset of symptoms by 12th January 2020, which was calculated based on the
internationally reported cases. Later, Wu et al [19] applied a susceptible-exposed-infectiousrecovered (SEIR) metapopulation model to simulate the epidemics of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak
across all major cities in China on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities
outside mainland China, and they estimated that 75 815 individuals (95% CI 37 304‚Äì130 330)
had been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. A recent study based on the Susceptible-InfectedRecovered-Dead (SIRD) model revealed that the cumulative number of infected cases will
surpass 68,000 (as a lower bound) and could reach 140,000 (with an upper bound of 290,000) by
February 29 [17]. Notably, Huang and Qiao proposed a simple and data driven model based
on the physics of natural growth algorithm and estimated the transmission rate of the SARSCoV-2 outbreak [16]. The results of these modeling studies have provided important guidance
for governments and health agencies to intensify preparedness and response efforts.
Here we applied Boltzmann function to analyze the reported confirmed cases in mainland China,
focusing Hubei Province and Wuhan City, the center of the outbreak, as well as those most
affected provinces and economic centers. Strikingly, all data sets were well fitted to the
Boltzmann function (Figs. 1, 2 and S1). More importantly, the data of 2003 SARS-CoV in China
and worldwide were also well fitted to the function (Fig. 4). These results, in conjunction with
that Boltzmann function can be inferred from a few assumptions (for detail, refer to the Methods
section of the support information file), suggest that Boltzmann function is suitable for analyzing
the epidemics of coronaviruses like SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. One advantage of this model
is that parameter A2 directly gives an estimate of the potential total numbers of confirmed cases.
In addition, unlike traditional epidemiological models that require much more detailed data for
analysis [14, 19], Boltzmann function-based regression analysis only needs the cumulative
number of confirmed cases, somehow as simple as the model proposed by Huang and Qiao [16].
Furthermore, the established Boltzmann functions allow us to forecast the future course of the
epidemics of SARS-CoV-2 in different regions in the coming weeks. The potential total numbers
of confirmed cases in mainland China, in Hubei Province, in Wuhan City (the center of the
outbreak) and in other most affected provinces and top4 major cities, as summarized in Table 1,
may provide valuable guidance for Chinese central and local governments to contain this outbreak
at current critical stage. In particular, the numbers in mainland China and Hubei Province were
estimated as 79589 (95% CI 71576, 93855) and 64817 (95% CI 58223, 77895), respectively,
indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in China might not be as bad as thought. Notably, our
results also suggest that the number of daily new confirmed cases will become minimal between
Feb 28 and Mar 10 in mainland China (including Hubei Province) at 95% CI (Fig. 3A). This trend,
if occur as predicted, may help citizens in China to release stress and anxiety, as there have been

many provinces and/cities in China that have suspended public transportation systems and even
implemented house quarantines for all urban households [20]. In further support of these
estimates by the Boltzmann function, the newly released cumulative number of confirmed cases
in all the above geographic regions on Feb 15 and Feb 16 are very close to the predicted ones
(refer to Table S2). Consistently, parameters of the established Boltzmann functions by
regression analyses of the data from Jan 21 to Feb 16, 2020 (as presented in Fig. S4) are highly
similar to those made by the data from Feb 21 to Feb 14, 2020.

Nevertheless, our estimates based on the established Boltzmann functions are not absolutely
guaranteed, mainly because of the uncertainty of the reported data (Figs. 3, S2 and S3). We
estimated the potential total numbers (refer to Table 1) under the assumption that the relative
uncertainty of the reported data follows a single-sided normal distribution with a mean of 1.0 and
a standard deviation of 10%, and this deviation may be underestimated. If the real uncertainty of
released data by health commissions is larger than 10%, the potential total numbers of confirmed
cases would accordingly increase, and the key dates will be postponed. Another limitation is that
this estimate is based on the assumption that the overall conditions are not changing. This might
not be true, given that in many regions the workers have started to return for work half a month
post the Spring Festival holiday (schedulely ending on Feb 31), which may increase the SARSCoV-2 infection. In this regard, it is noted that the daily number of new confirmed cases in past
a few days in several provinces and cities (e.g., Guangdong Province, Fig. 2A; Shanghai and
Shenzhen City, Fig. S1D) have increased a little bit more than predicted by the model.

The reported cumulative number of confirmed cases may have uncertainty. Assuming the relative uncertainty
follows a single-sided normal distribution with a mean of 1.0 and a standard deviation of 10%, the potential
total number and key dates were estimated at 95% CI. For detail, refer to the Methods section and Figs. 3, S2
and S3.
b Key date is determined when the number of daily new confirmed cases is less than 0.1% of the potential total

Figure 3. Analysis of the uncertainty of confirmed cases for mainland China, Hubei
Province, Wuhan City and other provinces.
Data of mainland China (panel A), of Hubei Province (panel B), of Wuhan City (panel C) and of
other provinces (panel D) were fitted to Boltzmann function assuming that the relative uncertainty
of the data follows a single-sided normal distribution with a mean of 1.0 and a standard deviation
of 10%. Original data are shown as circles; simulated results are presented as colored lines as
indicated. Inserts show key statistics. The key date is defined as the date when the number of daily
new confirmed cases is less than 0.1% of the potential total number. The low and high key dates
were determined by the simulated curve of confidence interval (CI) at 2.5% and 97.5%,
respectively.
