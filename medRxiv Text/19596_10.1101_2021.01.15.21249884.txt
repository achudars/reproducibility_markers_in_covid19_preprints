Abstract
The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly developed into a global epidemic. To control
its spread, countries have implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as school
closures, gathering bans, or even stay-at-home orders. Here we study the effectiveness of seven NPIs
in reducing the number of new infections, which was inferred from the reported cases of COVID-19
using a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model. Based on data from the first epidemic wave
of n = 20 countries (i.e., the United States, Canada, Australia, the EU-15 countries, Norway, and
Switzerland), we estimate the relative reduction in the number of new infections attributed to each
NPI. Among the NPIs considered, event bans were most effective, followed by venue and school
closures, whereas stay-at-home orders and work bans were least effective. With this retrospective
cross-country analysis, we provide estimates regarding the effectiveness of different NPIs during the
first epidemic wave.

1 Introduction

16

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has developed into a global epidemic. Efforts to control the

17

spread of SARS-CoV-2 focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). These represent public

18

health-policy measures that were intended to diminish transmission rates and, to this end, aimed at

19

reducing person-to-person contacts via so-called social distancing1 . Examples include school closures,

20

venue closures, or stay-at-home orders.

21

Early studies on the population-level effects of NPIs analyzed their effectiveness mostly within a

22

single country2–9 . Thereby, NPIs were often packaged into bundles and their combined effectiveness

23

was assessed and confirmed. By combining data from multiple countries, a couple of studies have

24

attempted to compare the effectiveness of individual NPIs10–15 ; however, the evidence from these

25

studies regarding which NPIs were particularly effective is still inconclusive.

26

Here we contribute further evidence on the combined and individual effectiveness of NPIs. Using

27

a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model, we estimated the effects of NPIs on the number of

28

new infections across n = 20 Western countries during the first epidemic wave: the United States,

29

Canada, Australia, the EU-15 countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,

30

Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United

31

Kingdom), Norway, and Switzerland. This amounts to ∼3.3 million reported cases of coronavirus

32

disease 2019 (COVID-19) and covers a population of ∼0.8 billion people.

33

2 Methods

34

2.1 Data

35

Reported SARS-CoV-2 cases for each country between February and May 2020 were obtained from

36

the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, which was developed for real-time tracking of

37

reported cases of COVID-19 and directly aggregates cases recorded by local authorities in order to

38

overcome time delays from alternative reporting bodies16 . Hence, these numbers are supposed to

39

account for all COVID-19 cases identified on a specific day.

40

Data on NPIs were collected by our research team. Their implementation dates were systematically

41

obtained from government resources and news outlets before the NPIs were being classified into

42

seven categories, based on definitions applicable across our sample of countries (Tbl. 1): (1) event

bans, (2) school closures, (3) venue closures (e.g., shops, bars, restaurants, and venues for other

44

recreational activities), (4) gathering bans, (5) border closures, (6) stay-at-home orders prohibiting

45

public movements without valid reason, and (7) work bans on non-essential business activities. Note

46

that stay-at-home orders always also implied the presence of event bans, gathering bans and venue

47

closures as NPIs if these had not been explicitly implemented earlier.

48

The implementation date of an NPI refers to the first day a measure went into action. The

49

implementation dates were thoroughly checked to ensure correctness and consistency across countries.

50

Overall, eight authors were involved in collecting, categorizing, and checking the data. Furthermore,

51

local residents and/or native speakers were recruited from some countries in order to verify our

52

encoding in cases where the interpretation of legal terms was not ambiguous or where it was difficult

53

to distinguish, for instance, whether an NPI was enforced or recommended. Sources and details on

54

data collection for NPIs are provided in Supplement 6.

55

Our selection of Western countries defined a sample that followed a similar and comparable

56

overall strategy in controlling the COVID-19 outbreak. On the one hand, the national strategies

57

consisted of similar NPIs, which we can expect to work in a similar manner, despite cultural and

58

organisational differences between countries. On the other hand, the national strategies differed

59

in the choice, timing, and sequencing of NPIs. Taken together, the setting of this study resembles

60

that of a natural experiment, which allows us to learn about the effects of different NPIs. However,

61

in countries with a federal structure, the timing of NPIs may differ between regions (e.g., states

62

or territories). In countries with such regional variation, NPI data was collected at the regional

63

level and, similar to Hsiang et al.14 , we took into account the cumulative share of the country’s

64

population that is affected by an NPI. Fig. 1 summarizes our NPI data by comparing choice, timing

2.2 Model summary

67

In this section, we provide a short description of our model. A detailed description, including all

68

modeling and prior choices is given in Supplement 1.

69

Fig. 2 provides a visual summary of our model structure. Our model links two unobserved

70

quantities (i.e., the daily number of contagious subjects and the daily number of new infections) to

71

an observed quantity (i.e., the number of reported new cases). The links consist of three components:

72

(1) a regression type model relating the number of new infections to the number of contagious

73

subjects, the country-specific daily transmission rate, and the presence of active measures; (2) a link

74

between the number of new infections to the number of reported new cases; and (3) a link between

75

the number of new infections and the number of contagious subjects.

Figure 2. Visual summary of the model structure: (1) the number of new infections is modelled as a function
of the number of contagious subjects, the country-specific daily transmission rate, and the reductions from
active NPIs; (2) the observed number of new cases is a weighted sum of the number of new infections in the
previous days; and (3) the number of contagious subjects is a weighted sum of the number of new infections
in the previous days.

The fundamental part of the first component is a model for the expected number µ of new
infections Ijt in country j at day t. In the absence of any measure, this would be µIjt = Cjt δj , where
Cjt are the number of contagious subjects and δj is the country-specific daily transmission rate. In
the presence of NPIs, we multiply this with the reduction due to avoided infections, resulting in
µIjt = Cjt δj ·

where amjt denotes the fraction of avoided infections due to NPI m = 1, . . . , M in country j at day t.
In case NPI m is implemented and fully effective, amjt is set equal to the value θm . However, an
NPI may not be fully effective in a country due to regional differences or because it may take a few
days until subjects respond to the new measures. Hence, the general structure of amjt is

77

denotes the number of days since the implementation of NPI m in region r of country j at time

78

t (such that Tmrjt = 1 denotes the first day at which a reduction in the number of new infections

79

could be expected), and where f (Tmrjt ) is a time-delayed response function, which is specified such

80

that the response to an NPI increases from zero on day Tmrjt = 0 to one on day Tmrjt = 3 (Fig. 3a),

81

reflecting our expectation that NPIs typically require a few days until they are fully effective. The

82

choice for the time-delayed response is varied as part of the sensitivity analysis.

83

The effect of an NPI when fully implemented is equal to θm . Within our Bayesian framework,

84

a mixture prior was used to model the effect θm . The prior consists of a half-normal distribution

85

for negative effects and a uniform distribution for positive effects (Fig. 3b). This prior allows for

86

small increases in the number of new infections with a probability of 10%, while being uninformative

87

about positive effects leading to reductions in the number of new infections.

In the second component, the expected number of new cases is calculated as a weighted sum of

89

the number of new infections in the previous days. The weights reflect the distribution of the time

90

from infection to reporting, and this distribution is estimated from the data assuming a log-normal

91

distribution. Informative priors are used for the parameters of the log-normal distribution, reflecting

92

prior knowledge. These priors are derived by decomposing the time from infection to reporting into

93

the incubation period and the reporting delay, thereby using a meta-analysis17 and estimates from

94

multiple studies (in particular18 ) to obtain prior information about the distributions. The observed

95

number of new cases is then modeled as a negative binomial distribution with the specified mean,

96

allowing for overdispersion. Note that this part of the overall model was only applied after the

97

day when a country reached 100 reported cumulative cases (called the modeling phase), in order to

98

avoid modeling of highly irregular case numbers in the very early stages of the epidemic when most

99

countries still had to set up their reporting practices. At the preceding days (called non-modeling

100

phase), only the other two components of the model were used (i.e., the number of new infections

101

and contagious subjects).

102

In the third component, the number of contagious subjects is calculated as a weighted sum of

103

the number of new infections in the previous days. The weights reflect the probability of being

104

contagious on a specific day after being infected and can be determined from the generation time

105

distribution. This distribution is assumed to be known and our choice is based on an estimate by a

106

recent study using data on the exposure for both the index and secondary case19 .

107

2.3 Parameter estimation

108

Choices of priors not mentioned so far are weakly informative, following general recommendations in

109

Bayesian modeling20 . All model parameters are estimated with a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierar-

110

chical model. Specifically, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling is used as implemented by

111

the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm with the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) from the probabilistic

112

programming language Stan, version 2.19.221 . Each model is estimated with 4 Markov chains and

113

2,000 iterations of which the first 1,000 iterations are discarded as part of the warm-up. Estimation

114

power is evaluated via the ratio of the effective sample size (n̂eff /N ), and convergence of the Markov

115

chains is assessed with the Gelman-Rubin convergence diagnostic (R̂). Further checks pertain to the

116

detection of influential observations and correlations between the parameters of interest. If not stated

117

otherwise, we report posterior means and credible intervals (CrIs) based on the 2.5% and 97.5%

118

quantile of the posterior samples. Detailed estimation results and model diagnostics are provided in

119

Supplement 3. The sensitivity of the results to the following modeling choices was investigated:

120

start and end of the modeling phase, time-delayed response function, prior distribution for the effect

121

of an NPI θm , prior choices for the time from infection to reporting and for the generation time.

122

Furthermore, the sensitivity of the results with respect to exclusion of individual countries was

123

assessed with a leave-one-country-out analysis. Finally, a comparison to a similar study that was

124

recently published11 is presented.

2.4 Data and code availability

126

We collected data from publicly available data sources (Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center16

127

for epidemiological data; news reports and government resources for policy measures). All the

128

public health information that we used is documented in the main text, the extended data, and

129

supplementary tables. A preprocessed data file together with reproducible code is available from

3 Results

132

3.1 Estimated effects of NPIs

133

Using data from the first epidemic wave, we estimated the relative reduction in the number of

134

new infections for each NPI (Fig. 4a). Event bans were associated with the highest reduction in

135

the number of new infections (37 %; 95% CrI 21 % to 50 %). The reduction was lower for venue

136

closures (18 %; 95% CrI −4 % to 40 %) and school closures (17 %; 95% CrI −2 % to 36 %), followed

137

by border closures (10 %; 95% CrI −2 % to 21 %) and gathering bans (9 %; 95% CrI −4 % to 23 %).

138

stay-at-home orders (4 %; 95% CrI −6 % to 17 %) and work bans on non-essential business activities

139

(1 %; 95% CrI −8 % to 12 %) appeared to be the least effective among the NPIs considered in this

140

analysis.

141

The estimates for the individual effects suggest a particular strong effect of event bans. This result

142

is further supported by analyzing the posterior ranking of the effects (Fig. 4b), which indicates that

143

we could be at least 98 % sure that event bans were among the two most effective NPIs. Conversely,

144

we could be at least 76 % sure that work bans were among the two least effective NPIs.

145

All NPIs together lead to an estimated relative reduction in the number of new infections by

146

67 % (95% CrI 64 % to 71 %). The combined effectiveness of NPIs was also analyzed (Fig. 4c-d).

147

Thereby, we could be at least 97 % sure that at least five NPIs simultaneously lead to a reduction in

148

the number of new infections. Regarding the magnitude of the effects, we could be at least 91 %

149

sure that three NPIs simultaneously lead to a reduction in the number of new infections of more

150

than 10 %.

3.2 Sensitivity analysis

152

Sensitivity of our results was assessed with respect to varying modeling and prior choices (Supplement

153

4). Overall, our results were only slightly sensitive to alternative modeling and prior choices,

154

particularly when deriving conclusions about the ranking of the effects. A leave-one-out analysis for

155

the countries in our sample indicated some sensitivity with respect to the exclusion of Australia,

156

Sweden, and Switzerland. This sensitivity was further investigated and subsequent analysis indicated

157

that data from these countries are particularly informative for the effect of school closures and event

158

bans.

159

3.3 Estimated number of new infections and cases over time

160

The model fit was assessed by comparing the expected number of new cases based on our model

161

to the observed number of new cases (Fig. 5). Here an acceptable degree of agreement is observed

162

for Australia, Germany, Sweden, the UK, and all other countries (figures for all other countries are

listed in Supplement 5). In addition, the posterior distribution for the number of new infections is

164

depicted, illustrating how NPIs lead to a reduction in new infections, which later implies a reduction

165

in new cases.

166

3.4 Comparison with a similar study

167

Recently, an analysis similar to our was published by Brauner et al.11 . In the following, we present a

168

brief comparison. Brauner et al. used the same data source to generate country-specific case numbers

169

per day, but included 30 countries only partially overlapping with our selection. The authors used

170

similar sources to collect data on NPIs but classified some NPIs differently. The modeling approach

171

was very similar, except for avoiding to take the number of contagious subjects explicitly into account

172

and considering both the number of reported cases and reported deaths as outcomes. The authors

173

included country-specific NPI effects (although not explicitly analyzed), while we took into account

174

the share of the country’s total population being affected by NPIs and a time-delayed response to

175

their implementation. The authors used similar priors for the distribution of the time from infection

176

to reporting and for the generation time distribution, but estimated the latter explicitly as part of

177

fitting the model.

178

To facilitate a comparison of the results between the modeling approach by Brauner et al. and

179

our approach, we reanalyzed their data using our model. The estimated effects from our model were

180

generally smaller but the overall ranking of the effects was very similar when fitted to the same data

181

(Tbl. 2a). In contrast to that, when comparing the results from our model on different datasets (our

182

data and the data from Brauner et al.), there was only a similarity in the overall pattern (Tbl. 2b).

183

For instance, we found similar strong effects for event bans and school closures as well as weak

184

effects for stay-at-home orders, but the effect of venue closures is stronger and the effect of work

185

bans weaker in our data. In addition, the larger set of countries in the data from Brauner et al. was

186

associated with smaller credible intervals for the estimates.

193

are targeted towards large gatherings of people and may thus prevent so-called “superspreader events“,

194

which have been shown to account for a substantial fraction of the total number of infections22–24 .

195

Many superspreading events originated in points-of-interest such as bars and restaurants25 , which

196

aligns with our finding of a sizeable reduction from venue closures.

197

The effectiveness of school closures in transmission control is subject to debate26, 27 . Although

198

children are less susceptible to the virus than adults, it is less clear how children and adults compare

199

regarding their infectiousness28 . Early findings suggested that school closures were only marginally

200

effective in transmission control29 . Our results provide contrary evidence, in line with recent findings

201

from other population-based studies11, 13, 15, 30, 31 . However, note that our findings relate to the closure

202

of primary schools, which often coincided with the closure of secondary schools and universities.

203

The study by Brauner et al. differentiated between NPIs for the closure of schools and the closure

204

of universities, but could afterwards not disentangle the estimated effects11 . Thus, it is subject

205

to further investigation whether the closure of primary schools is less effective than the closure of

206

secondary schools and universities28 .

207

A small effect was estimated for stay-at-home orders. This seems to contradict findings about

208

the high effectiveness of the lockdown from Flaxman et al.12 . However, one should consider that

209

their definition of a lockdown encompasses multiple NPIs that we differentiated (e.g., gathering bans,

210

venue closures, and stay-at-home orders). Taken together, our estimated “lockdown effect” would

211

therefore also be large. Finally, although our findings suggest that work bans were not effective,

212

it should be considered that our definition of a work ban referred to a strict ban of non-essential

213

business activities, while many countries only issued recommendations.

214

4.2 Methodological aspects

215

Flaxman et al.12 were the first who attempted to link NPIs to observed cases or deaths using a

216

semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model. Both the study of Brauner et al.11 and our study can

217

be seen as extensions of this approach, thereby making use in particular of data from more countries.

218

This also implies the possibility of refined modeling.

219

The above studies have in common that they model the effect of the NPIs on the number of

220

new infections. Whereas the other studies approached this by modeling explicitly the effect on the

221

reproduction number, we directly modelled the number of new infections in relation to the number

222

of contagious subjects. Thereby, the generation time distribution was used in a way to approximate

223

the time from infection to becoming contagious32 .

224

A further common property of the above studies is the use of prior information on the distribution

225

of certain quantities that play a central role in the spread of infectious diseases. Flaxman et al.

226

equal the generation time distribution with the serial distribution, whereas Brauner et al. and our

227

study avoid this, considering that there can be a substantial difference between these distributions33 .

228

Brauner et al. estimated the generation time distribution from their data on cases and deaths using

229

an informative prior, whereas we made use of an explicit assumption based on prior knowledge. The

230

second quantity used in both studies is the time from infection to reporting, which is assumed to

231

be known by Flaxman et al. and estimated by Brauner et al. and our study. Similar to the other

232

studies, we investigated the sensitivity of the estimated NPI effects with respect to the assumptions

233

made or the priors chosen.

234

A specific property of our approach is to take the regional variation in the implementation of

235

NPIs explicitly into account. We approached this by incorporating the share of the country’s total

236

population that is affected by active NPIs in our model. The other studies ignored this variation

237

or restricted the analysis to countries with no or very little regional variation. A further specific

238

property was to allow for a gradual increase in the response to NPIs over the first few days, whereas

239

the other studies assumed a full response on the first day NPIs were implemented.

240

4.3 Insights from a comparison with a similar study

241

With the data on reported cases and deaths gathered by the John Hopkins University and data

242

on NPIs gathered by government and news websites, there is a unique source for analyzing the

243

impact of health policy measures on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are

244

many degrees of freedom with respect to preprocessing the available data, constructing a model,

245

and making prior assumptions and choices. To understand the influence of these data and modeling

246

choices on the results, it is desirable that different research groups analyse the same data in different

247

ways. A very recent publication by Brauner et al.11 gave us the possibility to perform a first check

248

of this type. The check indicated that the choice of countries and definition of NPIs has a larger

249

influence on the estimated effects than the detailed choices in modeling. A re-analysis of the original

250

study by Flaxman et al. could also demonstrate sensitivity of the results with respect to specific

251

choices of the definition of NPIs, but also found sensitivity to specific modeling choices34 .

252

4.4 Limitations

253

Our analysis is subject to limitations. First, our modeling assumptions do not allow for (random)

254

variation in the effect of NPIs across countries and assume a fixed effect. Brauner et al.11 demon-

255

strated that, in principle, it is feasible to allow for country-specific variation in the effects. However,

256

the specific parametrization chosen in our model (i.e., to take into account regional variation in

257

the implementation of NPIs via the population share) made it challenging to incorporate random

258

variation of the NPI effect θm across countries. Brauner et al observed in the sensitivity analysis

259

of their study that assuming a fixed effect does not alter the main conclusions that they discussed

260

regarding the effectiveness of NPIs.

261

262

Second, any approach of explaining changes in the observed number of cases solely by specific
NPIs makes the implicit assumption that these changes were not the result of some other factors.

263

For instance, it is possible that additional measures or an increasing general awareness encouraged

264

social distancing and hence lead to less infections. If this is the case, such effects will erroneously be

265

assigned to the NPIs and possibly overstate their overall impact.

266

Third, it is challenging to distinguish between the effects of single NPIs due to their concurring

267

introduction in many countries (Supplement Tbl. 4). This is reflected by wide credible intervals

268

and a negative association between effects (Supplement Fig. 3.2), suggesting that the effect of one

269

NPI may be attributed partially to another. Note that the effect of event bans could be estimated

270

with comparably narrower credible intervals than that of venue and school closures. A reason for

271

this could be that all three measures were implemented by most countries but event bans had on

272

average a greater distance in implementation to other NPIs as compared to school and venue closures

273

(Supplement Tbl. 3). Despite the difficulty in disentangling the effects of individual NPIs, we were

274

able to demonstrate that we can be fairly confident with respect to their relative ranking.

275

Fourth, our analysis is limited by the type of data utilized to define the outcomes. Using the

276

number of reported cases as outcome implies that reporting practices may have an influence on

277

the results. In particular, definitions and reporting practices differed between countries and over

278

time. However, since we modeled the ratio between the number of new cases and the number of

279

contagious subjects, we can expect that these effects cancel out. The same argument applies to the

280

challenge that we have to expect a substantial number of undetected cases, with detection rates

281

varying across countries and over time. In addition, we modelled the number of reported cases as a

282

random variable, thereby allowing for overdispersion. Moreover, we took into account that countries

283

had still to develop their reporting practice in the very early phase of the epidemic by starting the

284

modeling phase after at least 100 cumulative cases were reported in a country.

285

Fifth, our analysis is limited by the need to classify NPIs in a comparable manner across countries

286

and to determine dates when NPIs were exactly implemented. There is always some subjectivity

287

in making corresponding decisions. The comparison of our study with the one by Brauner et al.

288

suggests that such definitions can be crucial. We provide a detailed description of our decisions

289

(Supplement 6).

4.5 Outlook

291

With the model presented in this paper and that developed by Brauner et al., we may have reached

292

a first level of maturity. This may be sufficient to justify the use of these models in analyzing the

293

effects of NPIs. In principle, these models could also be used to study the effect of lifting NPIs.

294

A natural next step would be to apply these models to data from the second wave, which is still

295

ongoing. An interesting question would then be whether we can expect similar effects in the first and

296

the second wave. It is likely that some effects may have changed, as the situations are not necessarily

297

comparable and experience from the first wave may have helped in dealing with the second wave.

298

Of course, there is still room for improvement and refinement of the models. If information

299

on new cases is also available at a regional level, regional variation in implementing NPIs can be

300

used as an additional source of information using a two-level hierarchical approach. Furthermore,

301

between-country and regional variation may be linked to certain characteristics which may help to

302

understand the conditions under which an NPI is most effective. Similarly, information on cases

303

stratified by patient characteristics may provide new insights. Also the modeling of the outcome can

304

be improved, e.g., by taking weekday effects into account.

305

4.6 Conclusion

306

Our analysis makes a contribution to the emerging evidence about the effectiveness of different NPIs

307

in the first epidemic wave. Event bans in particular were identified as an effective measure, whereas

308

little evidence was found for substantial effects of stay-at-home orders and work bans. A comparison

309

with another study indicates robustness of some conclusions, but also a dependence on the choice of

310

data and definitions.
