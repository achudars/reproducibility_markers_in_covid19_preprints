Abstract
The influence of the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on mental health was poorly
understood. The present study aimed to exam sleep problems and posttraumatic stress symptoms
(PTSS) in Chinese immediately after the massive outbreak of COVID-19. A total of 2027 Chinese
participated in the present study. Wuhan-expose history, sleep quality and PTSS were measured
with self-rating scales. Results showed that there were significant differences of PCL-5 and of
sleep quality scores in different data-collection dates (ps<0.05). There were significant differences
of PCL-5 scores (t=-2.93, p<0.05) and latency onset of sleep (χ2=9.77, p<0.05) between
participants with and without Wuhan-expose history. The interaction effect of Wuhan exposure
history× sleep quality significantly influenced PCL-5 (ps<0.05). These results indicate that
keeping good sleep quality in individuals with high infectious risk is a way to prevent PTSS.

Introduction
On Dec 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) China Office was informed of
cases of an unknown etiology detected in Wuhan City, Hubei province of China (WHO, 2020a).
On Jan 7, 2020, a novel coronavirus, which had not been documented before was identified by the
Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from the throat swab sample of a
patient, and was confirmed as the cause of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by WHO (2020a).
On Jan 30, 2020 the outbreak of COVID-19 has been determined by the WHO as a Public Health
Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) (WHO, 2020b). Thus far (up to Feb 4, 2020), more
than 20,000 firmed cases have been confirmed in China, and more than 20 countries reported
confirmed cases (WHO, 2020c).

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5th edition (DSM-5)
(APA, 2013), Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is characterized by four symptom groups: (a)
involuntary memories of the trauma such as intrusions or nightmares; (b) persistent avoidance of
stimuli associated with the traumatic event; (c) negative alterations in cognitions and mood that
are associated with the trauma; and (d) alterations in arousal and reactivity that are associated with
the trauma. Also in DSM-5, exposure to traumatic events is the immediate causes of PTSD and an
essential condition of diagnosis. Being infected with a life-threatening physical illness is a
traumatic event and can lead to posttraumatic stress symptoms. For example, 12%-15% survivors
of SARS showed one type of PTSD symptom (PTSS) at one month after discharge (Wu et al,
2005); the morbidity of PTSD in patients with traumatic injury reached 9.6% at months (Bryant et
al., 2017). In addition, not only being attacked by traumatic illness could cause PTSD symptoms,
being contacts and carers of a deadly virus could also lead to symptoms like alternations in mood
and arousal (Tine et al., 2016). Living in the endemic area, every Chinese is a carer and a (possible)
contact of COVID-19. Although having experienced the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS), a severe infectious disease which had caused hundreds of death in China in
2003 (WHO, 2003)

，the traumatic course of the infection and the characteristic of human

transmission of novel coronavirus (Li et al., 2020) were beyond expectation, causing fear,
helplessness and PTSS among Chinese people. Hence in the present study, we focused on the
acute PTSS in Chinese under the background of massive COVID-19 outbreak.
Previous studies have proved that massive outbreaks of epidemics like SARS and Ebola virus
disease (EVD) could cause sleep problems in relevant individuals. For example, Yu et al. (2005)
reported that midlife women felt “sleep was restless” during SARS and this problem was closely
associated with their overall negative emotions. Another study showed that chronic post-SARS
symptoms were characterized by sleep-related problems (Moldofsky and Patcai, 2011). Survivors
of EVD also reported various sleep quality problems (Keita et al., 2017). More importantly, Sleep
and PTSS are closely related, and sleep disturbances are core features of PTSD. According to the
model raised by Richard et al. (2020), sleep disturbances (short sleep duration, frequent arousals,
and et al.) could lead to maladaptive sleep-related compensatory behaviors and cause hyperarousal
and anxiety-related disorders like PTSD. Sleep disruption also promoted anxious emotions by
disrupt emotion regulation and adaptive memory functions. Thus, it was reasonable to hypothesize
that wide-spread transmission of COVID-19 could causes sleep problems in Chinese and result in
PTSS.
In early December 2019, the first pneumonia case was identified in Wuhan, the capital city of
Hubei province (Huang et al., 2020). With the spreading of the epidemic, Wuhan became the
worst influenced area, where the mortality and incidence rate of COVID-19 were above the
national level according to the National Health Commission of China (2020). Moreover, not only
Wuhan residents were more likely to be infected, 72.3% nonresidents of Wuhan had contact with
individuals lived in Wuhan (Guan et al., 2020). Wuhan expose history had become an important

diagnosis standard and a source of fear. As a result, we collected data of Wuhan exposure to
measure the risk of infection. We hypothesized that Wuhan residents and individuals who had
been to Wuhan or contacted with Wuhan residents, would show more sleep problems and PTSS
for they were faced with high possibility of infection of COVID-19. We also explored the
relationship among the infection risk, sleep and PTSS to identify the role of sleep problems in the
development of PTSD. We hope the current study could reflect the influence of COVID-19 on
psychological well-being in Chinses and shed light on post-epidemic psychological intervention.
Methods
The methods and reporting procedures were in accordance with the STROBE (STrengthening
the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology) checklist.
Participants
A total of 2032 subjects form 31 provinces in the mainland of China, Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan participated in the present study. Criteria for inclusion was that subjects should be Chinese
race and age ≥ 18 years at the time of the COVID-19 infection. Table 1 demonstrated
demographic statistics of subjects. The average age of all subjects was 35.47±11.32.
All the study participants were provided with written informed consent. This project was
approved by the Ethics Committee of the Naval Military Medical University.
Wuhan expose history
Subjects who were Wuhan residents, or had been to Wuhan, or had contacted with anyone
from Wuhan during the outbreak of COVID-19 scored 1 point and those not scored 0. A total of
230 subjects showed a history of exposure to Wuhan.
Sleep quality
According to previous findings, certain types of sleep quality disturbances were more
common across anxiety-related disorders than others (Leskin et al., 2002; Neylan, 1998). As a
result, we only selected the most related items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)
(Buysse et al., 1989) to investigate sleep quality. 4 items form PSQI were used to measure
subject’s sleep quality. The first was the subjective sleep quality measuring participants’
satisfaction with sleep. Subject scored 0 if they had very good subjective sleep quality and scored
3 for very bad subjective sleep quality. The second item collected data on latency onset of sleep.
Scores varied from 0~3 with 0 standing for having no problems falling asleep and 3 standing for
hard to fall asleep for 3 times or more within a week. The third item was the sleep fragment.
Subjects score 1 for no occurrence of the problem and scored 3 if they had the problem for 3 times
or more within a week. The last item collected data on everyday sleep duration and the scores
varied form 0 (more than 7 hours) to 3 (less than 5 hours). In summary, 0 and 1 point of the 1st
item indicated very good and good subjective sleep quality and 2 and 3 indicated sleep quality
problems. For the remaining items, 0 point indicated good sleep quality and 1 to 3 points indicated
increasingly sever sleep quality problems.

PTSS
PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) (Weathers et al., 2013) was used to measure PTSS.
PCL-5 is a self-report 5-point Likert-Type scale (1=not at all, and 5=extremely) with 20 items
measuring PTSS of instruction, avoidance, numbing and hyperarousal. The Chinese version of
PCL-5 showed excellent consistency and convergent validity in previous studies (Li et al., 2018;
Liu et al., 2014). Internal consistency (Cronbach’s α) of PCL-5 in the present study was 0.87.
Data collection
The data was collected during Jan 30, 2020 to Feb 3, 2020 through an online survey platform
https://www.wjx.cn/. To complete the survey, participants had to answer all the listed questions in
a time limitation of 2 to 30 minutes. Answers with response time below 2 mins or above 30mins
were invalid and would be deleted in the following analysis.
Data analysis
5 participants were deleted because of illegal response time. Data from 2027 participants
were analyzed. One-way variance analysis (ANOVA) and Least-Significant Difference (LSD) test
were used to analyze the differences of PTSS during each day of survey. Chi-square test was
applied to analyzed differences of sleep quality by time and Wuhan-exposed history. Scores of
PTSS were compared between subjects with and without Wuhan exposure history using t-test.
Interaction effects of sleep and Wuhan exposure history on PTSS was analyzed using two-way
ANOVAs and simple effect analyses.
Results
General results of sleep quality and PTSS
Figure 1 showed trends of PCL-5 scores and sleep quality during the 5-day survey. Both
PCL-5 scores and sleep quality scores showed raising tendency from Jan 30, 2020 to Feb 2, 2020
and decreased in Feb 3, 2020. One-way ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference of
PCL-5 scores on different dates, F=4.38, p<0.05. LSD test showed significant increases was
illustrated from Jan 31 to Feb 2 (ps<0.05); however, the PCL-5 score in Feb 3, 2020 were
significantly lower than that in Feb 2, 2020 (p<0.05).
Chi-square test showed significant differences of sleep quality in the 5-days period, χ2=12.33,
p<0.05 for subjective sleep quality, χ2=34.32, p<0.05 for sleep fragment and χ2=20.03, p<0.05 for
sleep duration. However, latency onset of sleep did not illustrate significant change during the
period.
Influence of Wuhan exposure history on sleep quality and PTSS
Results demonstrated that participants with Wuhan exposure history generally showed more
latency onset of sleep (χ2=9.77, p<0.05) than those not. Wuhan exposure history also significantly
influence PCL-5 scores (t=-2.93, p<0.05). However, there no significant differences of other sleep
problems between participants with and without Wuhan-exposure history. See table 2 for detailed
information.

Interaction of exposure history and sleep quality on PTSS
Table 3 showed results of ANOVAs. To test the exposure history and sleep quality on PTSS,
the mean values of PCL-5 entered into 2 × 2 ANOVAs with exposure history and sleep quality as
independent variables. Results showed a significant interaction effect of Wuhan exposure history×
subjective sleep quality on PCL-5 (F=4.01, p<0.01, ηp2=0.006). Simple effect tests indicated that
there was a significant main effect of Wuhan exposure history on PCL-5 in subjects with relatively
poorer subject sleep quality (scored 2 and 3 points in subject sleep quality), but not in subjects
with better subject sleep quality. Results also demonstrated interaction of Wuhan exposure
history× latency onset of sleep (F=3.67, p<0.05, ηp2=0.006), but Wuhan-expose only significantly
affected PTSS in those showed severe problems falling asleep (score 3 points in latency onset of
sleep). Interactions of Wuhan exposure history× sleep fragment (F=3.14, p<0.05, ηp2=0.006) and
Wuhan exposure history× sleep duration (F=3.65, p<0.05, ηp2=005) were significant. Results of
simple effect tests were similar: there were only a main effect of Wuhan exposure history in
subjects who were easier to wake up and had shorter sleep duration (scored 3 and 4 points in
easily waking during the night or too early in the morning, and in sleep duration). These results
indicated that sleep quality regulated the relationship between Wuhan exposure history with sleep
and PTSS.
Discussion
According to National Health Commission of China (NHC), until Feb 4, 2020, prevalence
rate and fatality rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan were much high above the national level (NHC,
2020), making exposure to Wuhan a risk factor of infection and a cause of mental health problem.
The current study aimed to investigate the influence of potential danger of infection on sleep and
PTSS. We also explored regulating effects of sleep quality on the relationship between Wuhan
exposure history during outbreak of COVID-19 and PTSS. To this end, we conducted ANOVAs
and Chi-square tests with the above variables.
Results indicated that data of PTSS growth rapidly in the first 4 days in our study, and
decreased in the last day. Interestingly, scores of sleep quality showed the same tendency. This
might indicate the close relationship between sleep and PTSD. Moreover, up to the end of our
survey, the firmed cases and susceptive cases were still frantically increased, showing no sign of
decline (WHO, 2020e). We assumed that results of the present study suggested that emergence of
psychological “inflection point” which meant a turning from deterioration of mental health to
growth of resilience showed on Feb 3, 2020. It was a date before the number of confirmed cases of
COVID-19 showed any sign of downward trends in China. We supposed that the change in
psychological response might be a result of Chinese government’s efforts in disease management,
psychoeducation and prevention education.
Results illustrated that Wuhan exposure history affected PTSS. For those having
Wuhan-expose experiences, PTSS were more obvious. This result was in line with previous
findings that subjective perception of dangerousness during SARS related with severity of PTSD

symptoms (Mak et al., 2010). Results also highlighted the influence of trauma expose on latency
onset of sleep, which was different in subjects with and without Wuhan exposure history.
Difficulty in falling asleep might be a result of increased presleep cognitions. According to Fast
(2003), traumatic experiences caused reactions of fear, increased arousal and re-experience, and
these reactions affected presleep cognitions and leaded to chances of sleep onset latency. Increased
sleep onset latency then influenced mood, cognition and physiological responses.
We confirmed that subjective sleep quality, delayed sleep onset, sleep fragment and sleep
duration all regulated the effect of Wuhan exposure history on PTSS. Wuhan-expose history
influenced only those with relatively poor sleep quality, but if individuals showed few or none
sleep problems, Wuhan-expose was not a risk factor of PTSS. These results indicated that
traumatic events provide bases for PTSD but one’s ability to keep sleep quality was a protective
factor of onset and development of PTSD. This was line with Germain et al.’s (2016) model of
sleep and PTSD which indicated that sleep related more closely with PTSS than trauma events.
These results were also consist with previous studies which showed alters of REM sleep after
uncontrolled stress accounted for the long term physiological and behavioral impairments in an
animal model (Vanderheyden et al., 2015). The mechanisms regulating the interactions of
traumatic stress and sleep were poorly understood, and we extended previous findings by showing
regulation effect of sleep quality on the relationship between trauma expose and PTSD in human
samples. To prevent mental illness and protect mental health in the peak rush of COVID-19 and
other infectious fatal diseases, health authorities should be mindful of the influence of infectious
risks on psychological reactions, propagate the importance of keeping good sleep quality like
enough sleep time, keeping early hours etc.
Limitations of the current study included the use of a health example and the fact that we
used online survey in data collection. Only a few subjects were confirmed or suspected
COVID-19 patients in our study. And the mean levels of sleep quality and PTSS were in the
moderate range. For those being infected with COVID-19, sleep and metal health problems might
be far more severe. Considering the risk of infection, we used online survey to investigate
relationship among Wuhan exposure history, sleep and PTSS. However, it was hard to guarantee
authenticity with this method and the validity was limited. We suggested that future studies could
exam PTSD and related factors among COVID-19 survivors with face-to-face investigation or
interview.
Conclusion
The present study suggested that sleep quality level decreased and posttraumatic stress
symptoms increased with time and change of this tendency was shown on 3rd Feb, 2020.
Individuals with and without Wuhan-expose history showed different levels of PTSS and sleep
onset latency under the influence of COVID-19. Wuhan-expose history influenced PTSS severity
in individuals with poor sleep quality, but not those with high-quality sleep.
