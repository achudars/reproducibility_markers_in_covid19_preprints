ABSTRACT
Objective
We sought to understand how U.S. residents responded to COVID-19 as it emerged, and
the extent to which spatial-temporal factors impacted response.
Materials and Methods
We mined and reverse-geocoded 269,556 coronavirus-related social media postings on
Twitter from January 23rd to March 25th, 2020. We then ranked tweets based on the
socioeconomic status of the county they originated from using the Area Deprivation Index
(ADI); that we also used to identify areas with high initial disease counts (“hotspots”). We
applied topic modeling on the tweets to identify chief concerns and determine their
evolution over time. We also investigated how topic proportions varied based on ADI and
between hotspots and non-hotspots.
Results
We identified 45 topics, which shifted from early-outbreak-related content in January, to
the presidential election and governmental response in February, to lifestyle changes in
March. Highly resourced areas (low ADI) were concerned with stocks, social distancing,
and national-level policies, while high ADI areas shared content with negative expression,
prayers, and discussion of the CARES Act economic relief package. Within hotspots,
these differences stand, with the addition of increased discussion regarding employment
in high ADI versus low ADI hotspots.
Discussion
Topic modeling captures the major concerns in COVID-19-related discussion on a social
media platform in the early months of the pandemic. Our study extends previous studies
that utilized topic modeling on COVID-19 related tweets and linked the identified topics to
socioeconomic status using ADI. Comparisons between low and high ADI areas indicate
differential Twitter discussions, corresponding to greater concern with economic hardship
and impacts of the pandemic in less resourced communities, and less focus on general
public health messaging.
Conclusion
This work demonstrates a novel framework for assessing differential topics of
conversation correlating to income, education, and housing disparities. This, with
integration of COVID-19 hotspots, offers improved analysis of crisis response on Twitter.
Such insight is critical for informed public health messaging campaigns in future waves of
the pandemic, which should focus in part specifically on the interests of those who are
most vulnerable in the lowest resourced health settings.

INTRODUCTION
The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes
the disease COVID-19, has led to a global pandemic over the course of just a few
months. With no specific treatment for the disease and fears of the burden of illness
overwhelming health systems, the primary public health focus has been on disease
mitigation strategies [1-3]. These strategies have introduced new concepts to the general
public, such as social distancing and recommendations for routine masking. These
mitigation efforts along with others, including travel bans, shelter-in-place orders and
school closures, were anticipated to negatively affect many sectors of the U.S. economy,
and they have drastically changed the quotidian lives of most Americans. Given marked
community-level socioeconomic disparities and segregation in the U.S. that predated
COVID-19, the impacts of these measures were likely to have disparate uptake by and
impact on Americans depending on where they live [4].
With the expansive geography of the United States (U.S.), and modern-day travel
patterns, the disease initially was focused in a few cities, and these so-called “hotspots”
were a primary focus of much of the initial media coverage [5]. Despite this focus, other
COVID-19 hotspots with large marginalized populations later emerged [6,7], highlighting
the importance of understanding differential reactions to the crisis, as this could be critical
for shaping future public health communication and allocation of health resources.
Social media has been a prominent venue for personal and public health communication,
both in previous public health crises and now too with COVID-19. Pre-COVID-19, social
media research in the context of health was primarily focused on examining the patient
experience [8-12]. Comments and reviews on Twitter were used to measure healthcare

quality [10] and monitor health status of patients along with sentiment level [12]. Twitter,
specifically, has the advantage of short, real-time content availability with quick access to
a network of similar discussions through hashtags. It has been beneficial in various
research areas for its openness and availability [13]. It has also been useful in
understanding social networks, public health messaging, and forecasting spread [14-17].
Twitter played an important role in Ebola outbreak surveillance by detecting the epidemic
nearly a week before its first case [15]. Influenza infection rate [16] and ZIKV case number
[17] predictions, learned from the tweet count pattern of disease-related tweets, were also
proven successful.
During COVID-19, Twitter has been used to assess mitigation strategies such as social
distancing [18] [19] , capture self-reported symptoms of COVID-19 [20], Twitter, however,
has not, to our knowledge, been used as a tool to identify trends in public responses to a
health crises at the local level, while factoring in socioeconomic status. Using public
health communication to mitigate health disparities is not a novel concept [21], and is in
line with future directions laid out in the National Institute on Minority Health and Health
Disparities 2019 research framework [22], but the science on implementation of this
approach is underdeveloped and is an area of active research. In this study, we sought to
assess a novel approach to use Twitter to understand how COVID-19 related concerns
differed by area socioeconomic status in the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in
the United States.

Twitter Dataset
The dataset we used for this analysis is composed of Twitter entries (tweets) in English
posted by users in the United States from January 23rd to March 25th 2020. We mined the
tweets with a Standard Search API using the keywords ‘coronavirus’, ‘corona virus’,
‘corona’, ‘covid’, ‘covid-19’, ‘covid 19’ and ‘covid19’. For each tweet, we obtained standard
attributes: unique de-identified user ID, time of tweet, text of the tweet and four
geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) delineating the bounding box [23] from
which the tweet was posted. For privacy reasons, Twitter does not provide the exact
location that tweets were posted from. Figure 1 demonstrates the overall workflow which
will be further detailed in the following sections.
Preprocessing of Tweets
We pre-processed through the removal of punctuation marks, numbers, emojis, URLs,
stop words, and end of line characters. We shortened the remaining words to the root
using the stemmer package provided by the NLTK toolkit [24]. We removed tweets that
were with missing or invalid data such as those without a month or date of entry, valid
user ID entry or valid stemmed tweet text. Finally, we filtered out tweets containing only
words that occurred in less than 20 documents or more than 50% of all documents (of
which only “coronavirus” was excluded) in order to achieve better topic models. This is a
common approach [25, 26], used to avoid spurious associations by excluding words
based on term distribution.
Reverse Geocodes of Tweets
We employed GeoPy [27] to reverse geocode the coordinates and output the county and
state name of each tweet. As the bounding box provides enough information to

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.18.20233973; this version posted November 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this

confidently geotag the tweet at the county resolution, we used the midpoint of the
rectangle of latitude and longitude coordinates of each tweet as the effective location. This
location was then linked to a five-digit FIPS code, a code designed to uniquely identify
counties and states in the U.S., to determine the location of tweets at the county level. We
followed a similar approach in our previous work [19] to map tweets to the county level.
Area Deprivation Index (ADI) Designation
We leveraged ADI from The Neighborhood Atlas [28], a location-based socioeconomic
index at the census block group level which incorporates income, education, employment
and housing data and has been used to inform health delivery and policy. ADI scores
range from 0 to 100, where 0 corresponds to low deprivation and 100 corresponds to high
deprivation. We mapped the location of each tweet, derived from the reverse geocoding
tweets process, to the median ADI score of all the census block groups within the county
using its FIPS code. Counties were considered “low”, “mid”, or “high” ADI based on the
ADI distribution of the unique counties represented in the dataset. Low ADI designation
was assigned to counties from the lowest quintile of the distribution, and high ADI
designation was assigned to counties from the highest quintile of the distribution as has
been done with other studies using ADI [29, 30].
Hotspot Identification
We defined hotspots in January and February as areas with any cases of COVID-19
because there were few U.S. cases in these months and they were concentrated (also as
published by the New York Times [31]). For analyzing hotspots in March, we leveraged
the curated resource The U.S. COVID-19 Atlas [32], defining a tweet as from a hotspot if
the county was listed among the published population-adjusted hotspots.

Topic Modeling
We performed topic modeling of the tweets using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
approach [33]. LDA is an unsupervised approach and has been proven successful in
modeling topics in tweets [34]. We leveraged LDA from the MALLET package [35] to
detect topics from COVID-related tweets. To determine the optimal number of topics, we
compared topics by their coherence scores, which act as a proxy for interpretability by
measuring the degree of semantic similarity between top words in the topic [36]. We used
the topic-word distribution to annotate topics. We first ranked words of a topic and then
assigned the underlying theme.
Spatiotemporal Analysis
We leveraged the document-topic probability distribution for this analysis. We compared
topic prevalence over time, across low and high ADI areas, between hotspots and nonhotspots areas, and within hotspots between low ADI and high ADI areas.
Temporal analysis of topic prevalence
To study topic evolution and how the public reactions to COVID-19 varied temporally, we
averaged the topic distributions of all tweets for each month. We then compared the
average scores of all topics over time. For selected topics, we plotted out the daily topic
dynamic to demonstrate how the daily average topic distribution changed.
Spatial analysis of topic prevalence
To compare the dominant topics in counties of low versus high ADI designation, we
computed the log odds ratios of dominant topics in both groups. We first identified the
dominant topic – the topic with the highest probability – for all tweets, then we calculated
the log odds ratio of dominant topics among both groups to achieve a fair comparison,

especially when there was a significant difference in number of tweets in each group. The
log odds ratio of a topic can be interpreted as the probability of dominance of that topic in
one group over another.
The odds that any topic T dominates in a group G are calculated as:

oT, G

              
     

The log odds ratio of any topic T between two groups G0, G1 is calculated as:

   , ଴ , ଵ 

, ଴ 


, ଵ 

A positive log odds ratio indicates that topic T is more likely to appear in group G0, and a
negative log odds ratio indicates that the topic T is more likely to appear in group G1. We
did the same analysis to compare topic prevalence between hotspots and non-hotspots.
We also implemented the chi-squared test and independent t-test to assess the
differences in discussed topics across geographically grouped tweets. More specifically,
the chi-squared test was used to determine whether there was a statistically significant
difference between the expected dominant topic frequencies and observed dominant topic
frequencies across the ADI groups and hotspot groups. We further leveraged independent
t-tests to determine whether there was a difference between the means of the dominant
topic probabilities in the low and high ADI groups.
RESULTS
Preprocessing and Integration of Tweets
Pre-processing resulted in 269,556 tweets (95.6% of the original geocoded dataset) from
119,611 Twitter users (out of which 63 users had more than 100 tweets). This dataset
represents 1331 counties from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

in a specific topic. Word clouds for all topics are available in Supplementary Figure 1.
Comparing Topic Prevalence over Time
Through the monthly averaged distribution of topics, we delineated the topic dynamic from
January to March and noted topics that peaked by month in Figure 3. For each month,
topic prevalence compared to both of the other months had a significance of p <.0001
unless indicated otherwise. In January (Figure 3A), there were significant peaks in topics
such as intense expression, negative expression, and personal expression (vs. Mar, p
<.001) (Row 1). These topics are associated with profanity, anxiety, and emotions. We
also noted a peak in discussion regarding an early understanding of the novel disease,
namely symptoms, flu deaths, and preventative measures (vs. Feb, p <.01; vs. Mar, p
<.05) (Row 2). Further, we noted significant discussion regarding China, international
outbreak events (vs. Feb, p <.01; vs. Mar, p <.0001), and ethnicity (Row 3), as well as
tweets concerning case counts (vs. Feb, p <.05; vs. Mar, p <.0001), hotspots (vs. Feb, ns;
vs. Mar, p <.0001), and confirmed cases (Row 4).
In February (Figure 3B), there was a significant rise in discussion surrounding the
election, President Trump (Row 1), news articles, stocks (Row 2), the task force
conference, and the CDC (Row 3). February also saw a significant discussion surrounding
vaccines (vs. Mar, p <.0001) and travel (vs. Jan, p <.05; vs. Mar, p <.0001) (Row 4).
In March (Figure 3C), there was a rise in discussions related to social distancing and
disease mitigation strategies, namely closures, cancellations (vs. Jan, p <.0001; vs. Feb,
p <.001), social distancing, staying home, online media (vs. Jan, p <.05; vs. Feb, p
<.0001), and education (Row 1). In general, there were higher topic proportions of

activities related to quarantine, in particular exercising, sport, shopping, prayers, words
related to time, and adaptation (vs. Feb, p <.0001) (Row 2). March also resulted in more
dissemination of information, discussion regarding the CARES Act, discussion of cases in
Florida and New York, and tweets related to employment and local business support
(Row 3). Finally, in March there was a significantly higher proportion of tweets related to
the pandemic (vs. Jan, p <.0001; vs. Feb, p <.001), public health measures, tests and test
results, and also a higher prevalence of COVID-related hashtags (Row 4).
Comparing Topic Prevalence between Low and High ADI areas
ADI-specific analysis revealed significant differences in topic prevalence between low and
high ADI areas. Comparing areas at the highest and lowest quintiles of ADI designation
demonstrated differential effects (p <.001) in tweets by county level socioeconomic
resourcing. Topics that are more likely to dominate in high ADI counties and low ADI
counties are shown in Figure 4A. Tweets from high ADI areas are more likely to share
emotional content with intense (p <.0001), negative (p <.01), personal expression (p
<.01) or prayers (p <.05), as well as news regarding confirmed cases, the outbreak in
China, flu deaths, and the CARES Act (all p <.0001). On the other hand, tweets from low
ADI areas were more likely to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on hotspots, local
businesses, and New York status (all p <.0001). Topics related to the larger public health
crisis (p <.001) and pandemic (p =.001), as well as dissemination of information (p
<.0001), stocks (p <.01), and the task force conference (p =.01), were also significantly
more prevalent in tweets from lower ADI areas. These areas were also more concerned
about the progress of potential treatments like vaccines (p <.001). While tweets with
political topics about elections (p =.937) and president Trump (p =.605) were more likely

to come from low ADI areas, the differences were not statistically significant.
Observing the topic proportion progress from January through March (Figure 4B), we
noticed that “Intense Expression” and “CARES Act” topics had consistent trends at both
high and low ADI areas, with the high ADI areas having an overall higher daily average
topic probability. Furthermore, topics associated with public health policies and disease
mitigation strategies in March such as “Social Distancing” and “Local Business Support”
arose in tweets from low ADI areas at a higher prevalence than tweets from high ADI
areas.
Comparing Topic Prevalence between Hotspots and Non-Hotspots
The differences in the dominant topics’ prevalence between hotspots and non-hotspots
areas were significant (p <.001). Figure 5 demonstrates that tweets from hotspots had a
higher log odds ratio for topics including New York, social distancing, public health and
pandemic, information dissemination, exercise/sport, education, time, closures and
employment. Tweets that were not posted from hotspots expressed negative or intense
emotion, concern regarding the CDC guidelines and task force conference, international
events and flu deaths, as well as stocks and shopping.
Comparing Topic Prevalence Within Hotspots between Low and High ADI areas
We examined the tweets within the hotspots and compared topic prevalence between
areas of high ADI and low ADI. Figure 6A demonstrates that tweets associated with
confirmed cases, closures, intense expression, and hashtags were more prevalent from
high ADI hotspots. Notably, tweets regarding employment concerns (p <.001) were also
more likely to come from high ADI hotspots, which wasn’t significant in previous analysis
comparing ADI and hotspots separately. Furthermore, tweets from low ADI hotspots were

significantly more concerned with exercise, stocks, information dissemination, vaccine
treatment, and cases in New York. We next observed the topic dynamics for selected
topics from tweets collected in March (note that no high ADI areas were hotspots in
January and February). There were notable spikes in employment concerns and intense
expression from high ADI hotspots, whereas these topics remain consistent throughout
the month for tweets from low ADI hotspots. Tweets about New York and social distancing
remained consistently high in low ADI tweets.

DISCUSSION
Topic modeling of COVID-19-related social media data from Twitter demonstrates
significant differences in individual responses to the pandemic based on geographic area,
local disease prevalence and socioeconomic status. Over the progression of the crisis,
tweets varied in topic, and these variations evolved over time and differed across counties
with socioeconomic disparities. To our knowledge, this is the first study to link the ADI to
geocoded tweets in order to explore the impact of geographic area-based socioeconomic
status on tweet content.
This analysis follows the early pandemic timeline and establishes that topic modeling
performs well in identifying major subjects of discussion on Twitter and successfully
capture the nuances of their variability. Topic modeling has been applied to COVID-19related tweets in an overlapping window of time (January 23 to March 7, 2020) [37],
however limited topics, thus concerns, were identified and no analysis was reported about
the emergence of topic during that period. As the first cases of COVID-19 broke news in

disseminating as much information as possible. Similar conclusions were reported by Xue
et. Al [37]. As time progressed, we found a massive increase in the number of tweets and
there was increasing focus on local cases and events, public health information
dissemination and testing, and quarantine activities.
Topic prevalence over time was explored in COVID-19 related tweets by Ordun et al [38],
however, the analysis was limited to reporting trends and lacked extended investigations
of linking the trending topics to other health or social factors. In our study, we have linked
topic prevalence to socioeconomic status. Specifically, the topic prevalence comparisons
between low and high ADI areas demonstrated that tweets from high ADI areas were
more likely to share content regarding personal experiences, which ranged from positive
affirmations of hope and prayers to negative or and intense expressions of anxiety or
frustration. This was not surprising given that the disparate impact of the pandemic and
the associated economic fallout have disproportionately impacted poorer communities,
and Black and Hispanic communities have faced some of the highest rates of
unemployment [39]. This was in many ways a result of the hard-hit industries
overrepresented in these communities as well as inability to perform jobs in these
industries from home [40, 41]. Furthermore, centuries of structural racism in the United
States have led to lower resourcing in these areas and higher rates of medical comorbidities that have been shown to increase COVID-19 risk [39] – all potentially
contributing factors to an increase in intense, negative, and personal discussion in these
areas pertaining to the public health and economic crisis.
Tweets from low ADI areas in March showed more discussion of social distancing and
local business support, as quarantine policies hurt local businesses and resulted in
discussions about bill relief to support these businesses. This result is consistent with the

quicker response to stay at home orders from low ADI areas and is in line with recent
reports of movement dynamic differences between low-income and high-income areas
[42]. The higher prevalence of discussion surrounding stocks that was noted in low ADI
areas was consistent with a greater stock market wealth residing amongst the wealthiest
US households [43].
In the comparison between low and high ADI areas within hotspots, we identified that
tweets with intense expression and those about employment insecurity were significantly
more likely to come from high ADI hotspots, reinforcing the notion that, even after
restricting to areas with high case counts, income and racial disparity result in
disproportionate affects due to closures and job loss [41]. Furthermore, low ADI counties
were significantly more concerned with information dissemination, cases in New York (on
average a large low ADI hotspot), stocks, and vaccine treatment which follows our
nationwide analysis of low ADI areas as showing increased focus on social and
institutional reactions to the crisis.
Our approach of integrating a location-based socioeconomic index with Twitter topics
offered increased insight into the topics inferred from the text, allowing a novel framework
for assessing differential sentiment topics of conversation as they correlate to income,
education, and housing disparities. Our integration of published COVID-19 hotspots
further enables time-specific information of disease spread and how this corresponds to
topics discussed on Twitter. These nuances are valuable for recognizing how public
health communication, resource allocation policy, and information dissemination can best
shape health crisis response to the needs of different communities, especially those with
the lowest health resourcing, in future waves of the pandemic and emerging infectious
disease outbreaks. Future public health efforts may use Twitter topic modeling to target

messaging to the unique concerns of local communities and study the impact of health
resource utilization.
Limitations
Our study successfully explored on the pandemic topics of conversation across tweets.
However, there were a few limitations. For technical reasons on the server, fewer tweets
were scraped on some dates. However, our previous work on [44] has shown that that we
were still able to glean valuable conclusions from our data that represent the early
pandemic progression. Another limitation for all Twitter-based research is that tweets
posted from private accounts could not be retrieved from the API. Furthermore, due to
restrictions with Twitter geocoding, there was some degree of positional inaccuracy that
we accepted in our study design in that we were only able to collect geographic
coordinates to the resolution of a county, and therefore characterized each tweet by the
county rather than the census tract or block group. Given the inherent geographic
masking techniques used by Twitter to promote confidentiality, and our study design
which involved cross-area estimation and simple geographic centroid assessment [19],
we acknowledge aggregation bias as a study limitation. Despite this, however, we found
that, on average, the county ADI was distributed such that the median ADI was a
reasonable approximation for the county.
CONCLUSION
Twitter analysis linking geocoded tweets to markers of geographic socioeconomic
resourcing demonstrates that the COVID-19 pandemic has differentially impacted areas of
the United States that are already institutionally underserved. This finding highlights the

need to address the specific fears and concerns of these communities through
personalized public health messaging and policy reform, addressing consistent issues
such as job security and negative emotions likely associated with greater instability during
the crisis. Our work indicates the emerging utility for linking natural language processing
techniques to analyze real-time social media data and measures of social determinants of
health.
