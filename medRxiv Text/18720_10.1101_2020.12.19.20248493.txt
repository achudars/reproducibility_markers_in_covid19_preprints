Abstract
School classrooms are enclosed settings where students and teachers spend prolonged periods of time and
therefore risky environments for airborne transmission of SARS-CoV2. While countries worldwide have been
pursuing different school reopening strategies, most EU countries are planning to keep schools open during the
whole winter season 2020/21. Open schools in winter in highly epidemic areas pose a controversial issue:
ventilation of classrooms (an essential mitigation factor for airborne transmission) is expected to sensibly decrease
due to outdoor temperatures getting colder and regulators going to allow less restrictive policies on windows
closure. Fundamental questions to be addressed are therefore: to which extent can we contain airborne risk in
schools with natural ventilation ? what would be the optimal ventilation cycle during the cold season considering the
fact that most schools are not provided with mechanical ventilation systems? And, finally, what are the safety
ranges to keep the infection risk below the threshold values for new infections within a classroom? To try answering
these questions a risk model for airborne transmission of covid-19 in classrooms has been develped based on
previous models for tubercolosis and influenza. The separate cases of infectious student and infectious teacher are
investigated. The study explored the influence of 3500 different air ventilation cycles on the cumulative airborne risk
function throughout a school day. A numerical optimization of the risk function was carried out. Safety risk-zones for
breaks and lessons duration were calculated based solely on surgical masks worn by all exposed and
optimal windows opening intervals.

1. Introduction

Currently, tense debates are raging on schools as possible contagion triggers of SARS-CoV2 (both direct and indirect). In the middle of the second pandemic wave, it is important to
shed more light on this crucial matter for the issue of (re-)opening schools. That is, it is
necessary to explore the link between airborne contagion risk and possible mitigation
strategies, in particular by adopting natural ventilation cycles, which are the cheapest and
most feasible NPI (non-pharmaceutical intervention). As stated in a study by Morawska
(2020-2), “inhaling small airborne droplets is a probable third route of infection,” in
addition to transmission via larger respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected
people or contaminated surfaces. Very recent results from the Italian Regional
Environmental Agency “ARPA Piemonte”, confirms this assumption [Repubblica 2021].
According to past and recent publications (e.g., Leung [2020], Morawska [2020-1], and
Escombe [2007]), oral transmission of infectious diseases in confined environments can be
significantly reduced by proper ventilation. That is, particularly indirect oral transmission is
believed to be effectively curbed through the frequent opening of windows or by
mechanical HVAC systems (Morawska 2020-2). Although most of the relevant literature has
focused on the spread of tuberculosis or influenza in hospitals, the general principle of
dilution of viral load by means of natural ventilation is valid and pertinent for the SARSCoV-2 virus in the context of schools. Notably, mechanical ventilation systems, when
adequately configured, can be equally or even more effective (Morawska 2020-2, ASHRAE
2020). However, unlike hospitals, the vast majority of schools worldwide are not equipped
with such systems and will not be, at least for the foreseeable future (including the
2020/2021 school year). Groups of students, which can potentially include tens of
individuals, share the same premises for hours with potentially insufficient ventilation. This
greatly increases the likelihood of coming into contact with virus-loaded aerosol droplets
generated by even only one infected student or teacher in the same classroom. This issue
is of concern even when social distancing is correctly implemented. Together, these facts
suggest that SARS-CoV-2’s indirect transmission with infective aerosol particles is a
plausible scenario in all kind of schools where students are exposed to each other for hours
in relatively small environments. On the other hand, frequent natural ventilation could help
dilute the viral load by allowing fresh air from the outside to enter classrooms. The extent
to which natural ventilation cycles may reduce the airborne contagion risk by decreasing
the total viral load is the subject of the present study. Moreover, we show that the duration
of lesson intervals (breaks) is one of the most critical parameters during winter, since only
during breaks one can can imagine the viral load be diluted by fully opening windows.
Otherwise, during lessons the ambient temperature will drop dramatically and increase the
risks of other diseases. Therefore, having windows open in classrooms must be carefully
planned and controlled during the winter season. This motivates a
theoretical/computational framework aiming to investigate and optimize the impact of air
change cycles in classrooms on the aerosol contagion risk. The strategy illustrated in the
present analysis is based on natural ventilation, which is simple, efficient, and virtually free
to implement. The same modelling framework, however, can be employed with mechanical
ventilation cycles (since what counts is ultimately the air exchange rate, not its source).
This approach may therefore be useful also for the adoption of more sophisticated
engineering solutions based on HVAC systems and/or be extended in combination with air
cleaning systems. For a number of situations of the present time, however, it appears
necessary to focus on an appropriate natural ventilation strategy, which may take an
effective role in the mitigation of infections in schools.

Materials and Methods

2.1 GN-model with perfect mixing and face masks
The infection risk model used in the present analysis is essentially based on the GammaitoniNucci (GN) model, which is adequate for confined, ventilated environments [Gammaitoni 1997].
This model is based on the assumption that newly-produced viral particles are instantly diluted
over the whole environment volume (perfect-mixing) and that the emission rate parameter ER
(emission rate, i.e. number of viral particles generated per hour by each infectious subject) is
known, at least as an averaged value over the exposure time 
 . A recent paper, authored
by several experts in the field [Morawska 2020], elucidated how a possible mechanism for
transmission of SARS-Covid2 in confined spaces would be the formation of “light” aerosol
droplets (i.e. < 5 µm in diameter, unlike “heavy” droplets, over 5 µm) that diffuse in the
environment after being produced by an infected person, therefore justifying the assumption of
an emission rate and a saturation in closed environments.
q

Classical non-threshold models, such as this, assume that the probability of infection is simply
given by the ratio between infectious subjects (C) and exposed subjects (S), therefore the
probability of a single infection is not proportional to the number of exposed subjects. The
rationale for this approximation can be traced back to the hypothesis of perfect mixing and the
fact that the model explicitly represents only “indirect” transmission (i.e. via aerosol droplets),
while omitting “direct” transmission (i.e. by sneezing or by two subjects A and B breathing in
close proximity). In the GN model, if the number of viral sources (i.e. infectious subjects)
remains constant, the probability of infection for each subject at a given time t will only depend
on the total concentration of viral particles supposed isotropically distributed in the volume V.
This probability follows then an exponential law for increasing exposure time t, which strictly
 and the ventilation ratio p/Q, where p is the average inhalation
depends on the parameter 
flow (related to pulmonary capacity) and Q is the inflow of clean air provided by natural or
mechanical ventilation which takes into account also deactivation of viral load (see later). It is
important to stress that the present study already assumes a contagious person inside a
classroom (number of infectious individuals I = 1) and focus on the contagion risk inside a
classroom with a positive source within it. Thus, to perform large-scale risk assessments in
schools (which goes beyond the scope of the present work), the probability of having one or
more asymptomatic individuals in a classroom should be additionally estimated.
The risk factor R, intended here as a collective measure of risk referred to a group of S
susceptible individuals, in the original RMR model (by Riley, Murphy and Riley) can be written
as:

In the dynamical GN model, Eq. 1 can be improved by considering the variation of the number
of viral particles over time, becoming the solution of two coupled first order differential
equations:

In order to account for the complex phenomenon of viral inactivation and gravitational
deposition on surfaces [Yang and Marr, 2011], the ventilation rate N in (2) is better indicated as
the infectious virus removal rate (IVRR) which is the sum of the air exchange rate (AER), a viral
inactivation factor (λ) and a particle deposition factor (k). For the purpose of this demonstration
the small contribution of particle deposition on surfaces was neglected (k values are found in
literature below 0.25 vol/h [Chatoutsidou and Lazaridis 2019]) whereas a constant value for λ
= 0.5 vol/h was applied, on the basis of the SARS-CoV-2 half-life close to 1h as detected in
[van Doremalen 2020].
According to the GN model, the risk of infection in a volume V, where one infective subject is
present and the initial number of viral particles is n (which can be different from zero) is then
given by the general formula:

2.2 Influence of windows opening function on the infectious

virus removal rate (IVRR)

Windows opening implies a periodic activation of air exchanges per hour, which are supposed to
occur only during lesson breaks. Therefore, the IVRR function in (3) become a periodic
rectangular wave function over the full lesson time, with peaks influenced by higher values of
the air exchange rate (AER) as due to complete windows opening (2vol/h) or mechanical
ventilation (up to 10 vol/h). In the case of static natural ventilation, the range of values
commonly found in the literature lies between 0.2 and 3 vol/h (based on experimental
measurement of CO2 concentrations before and after opening windows in a room [Marr 2012,
Escombe 2007]). It must be pointed out, however, that natural ventilation would be also
affected by other factors, such as the difference of air temperature between the indoor and
outdoor space, the wind direction and average wind speed, and geometric factors such as
window size and position, etc. [Marr 2012]. As for thermal effects, in winter a high
temperature difference between outdoor and indoor is expected (∆T up to 25 °C, assuming
+20°C as room temperature and -5°C as the worse-case ambient temperature). This certainly
increase the ventilation flow as reported e.g. here [EN 16798] and justify the assumption of a
rather high AER of 2 vol/h (we investigate the winter condition since it is the most critical for
airborne transmission risk due to the natural tendency to reduce windows opening in closed
places). Moreover, the exact calibration of windows parameters would be specific to each
individual building, or even to each individual classroom within a given building. Such detail,
however, lies outside the scope of the present work. In this study we explore the influence on
the classroom risk function of different cycles (and levels) of the AER within the IRVV function
by changing the time duration of lecture and breaks. Fig. 2 report only two exemplary cycles
(long and short windows opening cycles) taken as input for the results shown in Fig. 3-4,

To account for the effect of PPE (personal protective equipment, in this case, face maskss) in
reducing both the number of viral particles generated by infectious subjects, and also reducing
the likelihood of inhalation of viral particles by exposed subjects, we propose a modificatioon to
Eq (3) whereby the viral inhalation term ERq p/Q is multiplied by two scaling factors:

out

The extent of efficacy of face masks in reducing airborne transmission is the subject of still
ongoing debate, although a general wide agreement on their importance as mitigation factor
has been accepted. Some recent results [Leung 2020] strongly supported the effectiveness of
face masks in reducing the spread of infected aerosol droplets during exhalation, under the
condition that the mask is correctly and permanently worn by both the infected and the
susceptible subjects. The estimated efficacy of surgical masks in filtering the airborne viral load
upon inhalation, represented by fin, varies in the available literature. Some authors (e.g.
[Smereka 2020]) estimate the value to be close to zero, claiming that masks can only filter
“large” droplets (>5µm), but more recent measurements suggest that surgical masks may
actually be able to filter even “small”, i.e. sub-micrometric, droplets [Mueller 2020]. In the
present analysis, we considered a possible range of values 0 - 0.3 for fin which is in line for
surgical masks. As for the efficacy in filtering the exhaled viral load, the parameter f could have
a value as high as 0.95 [Leung 2020], in the case of a perfectly-adhering surgical mask worn
the whole time. In a classroom environment, however, it will be difficult to ensure complete and
continuous compliance over the many hours of a typical school day. The recent case of a pupil
in Terni (Italy), who suffered from respiratory distress after wearing a mask for an extended
period of time (in compliance with the school internal policy), suggests that in a realistic
scenario, students will be occasionally removing their masks while maintaining social
distancing. For instance, a recommendation by some EU local scientific committees as of
October 2020, is to wear masks for as long as possible, but to allow their occasional removal as
long as social distancing is respected. In the scenario of a real classroom, more “cautious”
values of 0.85 for wearing masks 100% of the time and 0.45 for wearing it half of the time
were adopted.

2.2 Average emission rate for SARS-CoV2
A correct estimation for the emission rate parameter ER is not trivial and mostly based on a
semi-empirical approach combining viral load measurements from clinical trials and reverse
engineering from observed outbreaks. Recently [Buonanno 2020 B] suggested also a
distribution for the quanta emission rates (ERq), obtained applying the Monte Carlo method, i.e.

a probability density function of ER (pdf ). This was not considered here, assuming for ER
already averaged values selected from the variability ranges indicated in [Buonanno 2020 A],
for appropriate typical student and teachers’ behaviours, i.e. resting and standing persons with
moderate and more pronounced vocal activity, respectively (cfr. Appendix A). An averagedover-exposure-time emission rate  was then assumed constant throughout the 5h exposure
time in the simulation, but different for the case of infective student as compared to the
infective teacher, according to the following formula (with index j referring to the specific
source - resting student or standing teacher):

In (6) the parameter c is the viral load in the sputum (RNA copies mL ), c is a conversion
factor having units in quanta RNA copies (ratio between one infectious quantum and the
infectious dose expressed in viral RNA copies),  is the average pulmonary rate (m h ),
and V is the average droplet volume concentration expelled by the infectious person (mL
m ). As shown in [Morawska 2009],  can be approximated considering only four classes of
average microdroplet diameters D and the corresponding average droplet concentrations 
(part. cm ) and droplet volume  . Empirical estimations of c for SARS-CoV2 resulted from
recent clinical assessments of viral loads in symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects and can be
found here [Pan et al. 2020, To et al. 2020, ] whereas c values are referred to SARS-CoV1 as
explained in [Buonanno 2020 A, von Doremalen 2020, Watanabe 2010]. It is important to
stress the critical importance of the values chosen for the parameter ER in Eq. (4-6). Very
recent studies [Buonanno 2020 A] suggest that the value of ER can span at least two orders of
magnitude, between 0.7 and 70 quanta/h for a resting person (student) and 0.9 and 80
quanta/h for a standing person (teacher) who can be required to talk for several hours a day.
Given the uncertainty surrounding the exact value of ER , in this study we calculated different
scenarios assuming low (optimistic) and high (pessimistic) values of ER for the two distinct
cases of infectious student and infectious teacher.

2.3 Cumulative risk
In the present work, the GN-model is based on the concept of cumulative risk. In a scenario
where the infectious source is removed from the environment (e.g. student or teacher leaving
the classroom), the ER parameter in Eq (4) and (6) would become zero. However, we can
observe that even when ER =0 in (4), the infection risk   would remain greater than
zero, because of the multiplicative factor ௤  (and intuitively, due to the viral load already
present in the environment). Hence, equations (4) and (5) become:

During a break, if students/pupils will leave the environment where the viral aerosol has
gradually accumulated, it is logical to assume that R would not increase (in that classroom) and
will therefore remain constant. This is also reasonable in the light of the fact that during lesson
time the number of subjects in the corridors is very small in comparison to classrooms, and
generated viral load in corridors would also be diluted in a much larger total volume than that
of a single classroom.
Therefore, it is correct to take the additional risk of airborne infection during breaks to be zero.
When considering the total number of infections at a given time point t (after a certain number
of classes and breaks) this is given by the product R(t)S , where S represents the number of
susceptible subjects in the classroom from t = 0. In this situation, the variable of practical
interest is not the risk of infection during a single lecture, R (t), (which would become zero
after each break), but rather the cumulative risk R (t) at the time t, which keeps into account
the whole “history” of infection risk up to that point:

In (11), C (t) represents the number of infections in the previous hours and the index j spans
all the “cycles” of lecture+break before the current i-lesson (j=1 to i-1). The underlying
assumption, which is valid at least in Italian secondary schools, is that the susceptible subjects
at the beginning (S ) remain always the same and do not vary over the course of the school
day. To better understand the importance of cumulative risk, we introduce a practical example.

lecture break, it may seem intuitive to reset the infection risk to zero at the beginning of the
subsequent lecture. However, based on the definition of infection risk after an exposure time t
as C(t)/S , where C(t) is the total number of infected subjects at time t, this would be
equivalent to neglecting possible infections that occurred in the previous hour, and monitoring
only new ones. In our view, the risk factor R needs to be the answer to the following question:
“What is the probability of S initial susceptible subjects to be infected, after sharing the same
space for a given number of hours?”. Hence the need to account for the whole fraction of
infections from time zero, and not the probability of infections during one single teaching hour.
The same logic applies when one wants to compare risk curves with infection probability
thresholds in a classroom with n students / pupils. For at least one infection to occur, the
cumulative risk R (t)= C(t)/S must be greater than 1/ S . Therefore, the condition for zero
infections to occur over the total time spent in the classroom is:

Two separate python routines have been implemented to solve eq. (8-9) and (11) for the
infective student- as well as the infective teacher case. In the first case, an infective
asymptomatic student source is supposed to enter the classroom at time t=0 and to stay for 5
hours, while emitting viral quanta only during lessons (ER =0 at each break since the student
exits the classroom). On the other hand, an infective teacher source is supposed to teach and
stay with students for 2 hours only (this means for instance 100 min of effective lecture and a
surveillance break of 20 min). In both cases, however, all suceptible individuals are exposed for
a total time of 5 hours (an entire school day) minus the sum of all break times within the 5
hours, but the R function can never became zero for t>0 as previously explained. Thus, at the
end of a typical school day, one obtains the cumulative risk of infections with one infective
source as given by:

Results and Discussion

3.1 Simulation results
Simulation results are reported in Figs. 3 and 4, where cumulative risk curves R (t) were
calculated with the extended dynamic single-zone GN model comparing different scenarios in a
typical high school classroom of volume 8 * 7 * 3  170 m . Two situations were separately
considered: First, one positive student (Fig. 3) remained for 5 h in the same classroom of
volume V (except for break intervals). Second, a teacher positive for infection in the same
classroom (Fig 4) was supposed to remain for 2 hours only with different ERq levels. On
average, a high school teacher stays in the same classroom not more than two hours a day,
and after this time she/he usually moves to a new classroom. Importantly, estimated risk levels
by definition with Equations (5)–(6) are independent from “classroom crowding”—that is, from
the number of individuals S at t = 0 (when lectures begin). This is due to the GN-model
assumptions, which include 1. instantaneous, perfect (isotropic) mixing of the viral charge
emitted by the source and 2. all susceptible persons equally exposed to the airborne risk (since
the viral cloud after some time is perfectly mixed in the volume). However, other contagion
channels like coughing and surface contact were neglected in this analysis.
Red curves show the lowering effect of pure natural ventilation during breaks (opening
windows, AER = 2 h ), and orange curves show that of mechanical ventilation at high power
during breaks (AER increased almost 5 times during breaks). In these curves, face masks were
intentionally not included in order to isolate the net contribution of air ventilation. The
additional contribution of surgical face masks is then shown in the blue curves (natural
ventilation + face masks effectively worn 50% and 100% of the time, respectively). For each
mitigation factor, two different lecture + break profiles are compared in terms of single-timeperiod duration. That is, continuous plots refer to more frequent but shorter breaks  ,
 
50, 10  , whereas dashed plots refer to doubled break and lecture times:

 ,  
100, 20  . Remarkably, as shown in the dashed curves of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2,

shorter but more frequent breaks  ,    perform better in terms of risk, and one may
achieve the desired goal of zero infections even after 5 h (blue dashed curves) by combining
frequent window opening at sufficiently high AER (full aperture) with mask wearing.
The deviation of red curves from the reference curve (denoted in black, showing the absence of
any mitigation/dilution factor) shows the significant impact of natural ventilation alone,
quantifiable in an average reduction of risk of almost 50% at a lecture’s end.
The important mitigation effect of surgical masks (under the assumption they are worn by all
subjects) can be quantified in an additional reduction of 30–45 % from the reference curve
(depending on the effective time they are properly worn). Again, only a combination of masks
and natural ventilation may reduce risk levels below the one-contagion threshold (grey
horizontal lines in Fig. 3). In fact, to fully prevent any airborne contagion in a typical classroom
of 15, 25, or 30 students where an infectious subject is present, the value of R at the end of all
lectures must stay below 1/15, 1/25, or 1/30, respectively (= 6.7%, 4%, or 3.3%). In addition,
this clearly indicates the need to keep the number of students per classroom as low as possible
because the contagion threshold lowers as S increases.
The case of the infectious teacher (Figs. 4a and 4b) shows remarkable differences in the shape
of risk curves compared with those of the positive student case (Figs. 3a and 3b). For the
teacher case, higher levels of ER were required in order to account for a higher (average)
speak activity. Even if staying in a classroom for only two hours, an infectious teacher speaking
most of that time will be a much greater viral source than a student (on average), and the
corresponding risk curves will increase more steeply in the first 2h. After a teacher left the
room, the ER in that room dropped to zero, but the viral charge emitted by him/her was still
present (although it lowered after a number of hours—see the n(t) curves of Figs. 4c and 4d). A
resting load, however, would cause a further (although lower) increase of R during the next
hours, even if the teacher were no longer present in that classroom. In addition, the onec

infection threshold via airborne transmission for a class of 30 students wearing masks half of
the time (a realistic scenario) was reached much faster in the case of an infectious teacher.
That is, the time-to-one-contagion was about 1 h in the optimistic scenario (low ER level) and
even less than 1 h with a high ER level. For subjects exposed to an infectious student, the
time-to-one-contagion was much higher, varying from about 2.4 h (pessimistic case, high ER )
to 4.5 h (optimistic case, low ERq). Notably, all ER values employed were compatible with
published data [Buonanno 2020] for standing and resting people (reported also in appendix Fig. A1).

3.2 Comment on Mechanical Ventilation
Obviously, mechanical ventilation would be an even more desirable option in winter to increase
AER without opening the windows, but the vast majority of school buildings worldwide do not
have HVAC systems. In addition, Fig. 3 and 4 show that mechanical ventilation alone (active
only during breaks) is not enough to reduce the risk below the one-contagion threshold without
face masks. This goal could eventually be achieved with permanent full-power of the HVAC fans
and an engineered design of ejector distributors in the 3D space [Abuhegazy 2020]. This would
require a complete redesign of current HVAC systems in schools (if present) while posing
challenges for acoustic insulation. For these reasons, the scenario of permanent mechanical
ventilation at high values of AER was excluded from the present analysis.

3.3 Optimum ventilation profiles and safety zones
As previously stated, a significant risk reduction can be obtained with more frequent ventilation.
In fact, for a given classroom, the risk at the end of a school day (usually after five hours of
classes) can be expressed as a function of two variable parameters,  (lecture time, when
ventilation is turned off) and   (duration of breaks, when ventilation is active), as shown in
Equation (10). Thus, there is motivation for finding an optimal set of  ,   that would
minimize ,  ,   , noting that only limited actions can be undertaken on the other
exogenous parameters. Beyond this, classroom volumes are mostly fixed (except for the very
few cases in which new spaces have been allocated in the current year). Second, acting on
mask filter capabilities is also limited. That is, one may think it would improve the mask
parameters f and f by requesting students to wear ffp2 masks all of the time, but this
prescription for students younger than 18 years has been excluded by most regulators. In fact,
wearing high-filtering masks in school contexts for long periods may expose students to other
respiratory risks. Finally, ER and p cannot be controlled: whereas the average pulmonary
inflation rate has not large variation in the school context and is reasonably known for human
body, the critical emission rate parameter ER depends on actual habits/behaviors, and its
values are parametrically varied in bounded ranges to limit uncertainty. In any case, both ER
and p cannot be controlled by legislation or by technical countermeasures. Instead, acting on
ventilation (N) and then on the directly linked IVVR is feasible and can be effective, as shown in
this study. On the other hand, maximizing N in winter would require mechanical ventilation and
operating HVAC systems, lacking in most schools. We can act only on windows opening for
significant periods of time to increase the air exchange and dilution of the viral load. Therefore,
an effective risk reduction pathway is the identification of a numerical optimum for the
ventilation schedule as a function of time - AERopt(t) - which minimizes the cumulative risk
within certain boundaries. The risk function to be minimized is z = ,  ,   and is
represented in Fig. 5 a-b, Fig. 5c-d and the related contour plots of Fig. 6. As evident, a
minimum exists at around  ,    30 min , 50 since the z function is showing a clear
monotonic behavior in the surrounding of the x=y direction. This would imply an unusual
recommendation for most schools: class breaks should last longer than the classes themselves.
This fact is eventually unsurprising, since opening windows during breaks implies a higher Nlevel than during classes (Fig. 2). In addition, this fact is dictated by practical requirements.
That is, with low outdoor temperatures (particularly in January–March in schools located in the
northern hemisphere) and a concurrent risk for other seasonal diseases, it is only during
“lesson breaks” with no students inside the classroom, that one could think to increase the AER
substantially by fully opening the windows in a classroom.
However, since overly long breaks may also cause practical and organizational difficulties for
schools, wider “safety zones” for the variation of  ,   are recommended in Fig. 6. These
zones are defined below so-called “one-infection thresholds” (varying for different values of the
number S of students per classroom). A certain combination of  ,   from the safety zone

teacher as well for the infective student case, i.e. regardless of source type. In order to achieve
complete safety in a classroom of 30 students exposed for 5 hours, classes should last
approximately 45 min but breaks should be very long (about 35 minutes). This would
eventually turn into a complex or even unfeasible scheduling challenge for schools (only 3.75
lesson+break cycles would be possible within 5 hours). On the other hand, in a classroom of
15 students only, lessons could last 45-47 min and breaks easily reduced to 15 minutes,
allowing 5 entire cycles.

4. Conclusions
Cumulative airborne risk is the key to understanding airborne infections of SARS-CoV-2 within
classrooms. This originates from the cumulative nature of air saturation and viral aerosol
formation. Furthermore, students and teachers exposed in schools for long periods of time to
possible infection sources and standard sanitation/ventilation cycles during breaks cannot lower
the residual viral load in their environment to zero. On the contrary, it has been shown that a
small amount of this load would still be present in a classroom even after ventilation cycles at
high N, with students leaving classrooms during breaks. On the other hand, an infectious
student re-entering a classroom would continue to emit viral quanta, and an infectious teacher
remaining in the room for a number of hours could emit sufficient viral quanta to indirectly
infect other people, even after she/he exited the classroom. Although the dynamic single-zone
model employed here contains some approximations, a clear indication arises from this
theoretical analysis: windows in schools should be kept open most of the time to decrease the
airborne risk to acceptable levels. Since students may leave classrooms at every break, schools
could increase the ventilation rate during breaks to prevent thermal discomfort and other
seasonal
diseases.
Numerical results have indicated that windows should be fully (not partially) open during breaks
and that breaks should possibly last as long as possible. However, since these
recommendations may cause considerable organizational difficulties in schools and thermal
discomfort in the winter season, compromise solutions are necessary. Therefore, specific safety
regions for break and lecture durations (i.e., the parameters influencing ventilation profiles) for
the different cases of infective teacher and infective student —have been identified. In this
optimization, dilution and lowering of contagion risk were based entirely on natural ventilation
cycles (i.e., opening windows) rather than on mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation
systems are expected at larger scale in future building upgrades but are not currently present
in the vast majority of schools worldwide. Results of the minimization of the cumulative risk
function indicate f.i. that alternating lectures of 45 min with breaks of 15 min would keep the
contagion risk below the one-contagion-threshold in groups of 15 students, but for larger
groups of 30 scholars much longer breaks of about 35 minutes would be necessary. Thus, as a
general rule it may be wise, as suggested also by intuition, to have smaller class sizes to
control airborne transmission in schools. Finally, it is once again remarked that only a
combination of optimal air exchange cycles with protection masks worn by all individuals could
lower the risk of airborne contagion in school classrooms to a desirable safety level of zero
contagions in all conditions.
