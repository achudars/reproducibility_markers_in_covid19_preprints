Abstract
Introduction
School closures are associated with significant negative consequences and may exacerbate
inequalities. They were implemented worldwide to control SARS-CoV-2 in the first half of
2020, but their effectiveness remains uncertain. This review summarises the empirical
evidence of their effect on SARS-CoV-2 community transmission.
Methods
The study protocol was registered on Prospero (ID:CRD42020213699). On 12 October 2020
we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, the WHO Global COVID-19 Research
Database, ERIC, the British Education Index, and the Australian Education Index. We
included empirical studies with quantitative estimates of the effect of school
closures/reopenings on SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. We excluded prospective
modelling studies and intra-school transmission studies. We performed a narrative synthesis
due to data heterogeneity.
Results
We identified 3,318 articles, of which ten were included, with data from 146 countries. All
studies assessed school closures, and one additionally examined re-openings. There was
substantial heterogeneity between studies. Three studies, including the two at lowest risk of
bias, reported no impact of school closures on SARS-CoV-2 transmission; whilst the other
seven reported protective effects. Effect sizes ranged from no association to substantial and
important reductions in community transmission.
Discussion
Studies were at risk of confounding and collinearity from other non-pharmacological
interventions implemented close to school closures. Our results are consistent with school
closures being ineffective to very effective. This variation may be attributable to differences
in study design or real differences. With such varied evidence on effectiveness, and the
harmful effects, policymakers should take a measured approach before implementing
school closures.

Panel: ‘Research in context’
Evidence before this study
A previous systematic review, published by some of us in April 2020, found good evidence
that school closures are effective for the control of influenza, but limited evidence of
effectiveness for coronavirus outbreaks. At the time there was no available empirial
evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Added value of this study
This study is the first systematic review of the empirical evidence from observational studies
of the effect of school closures and reopenings on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
We include 10 studies, covering 146 countries. There was significant heterogeneity between
studies. Some studies reported large reductions in incidence and mortality associated with
school closures, however, studies were at risk of confounding and collinearity, and studies
at lower risk of bias reported no association.
Implications of all the available evidence
The evidence is consistent with either no effect, or a protective effect of school closures.
With such varied evidence on effectiveness, and the harmful effects, policymakers should
take a measured approach before implementing school closures.

Introduction
School closures have been a common strategy to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 during
the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2 April 2020, 172 nations had enacted full closures or partial
‘dismissals’, affecting nearly 1·5 billion children2. However, school closures have significant
negative consequences on children’s wellbeing and education, which will impact on life
chances and long-term health3,4. Closures may exacerbate existing inequalities. Children in
higher income families may have better opportunities for remote learning.
Moreover, whilst the role of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) collectively in limiting
community spread is established, the specific contribution of school closures remains
unclear. Observational studies suggest that school-aged children, particularly teenagers,
play a role in transmission to peers and bringing infection into households8, although the
relative importance compared to adults remains unclear9. Younger children appearless
susceptible to infection and may play a smaller role in community transmission, compared
with older children and adults10. Whilst some modelling studies have suggested that school
closures can reduce SARS-CoV-2 community transmission5, others disagree6,7.
A rapid systematic review published in April 2020 found only limited evidence of the
effectiveness of school closures in controlling the spread of coronaviruses.1 However, this
study was undertaken very early in the pandemic and included no observational data on
SARS-CoV-2. Several empirical studies on the effects of school closures on SARS-CoV-2
community transmission have been published since the April review, but there has been no
systematic review of these studies. Here, we synthesise the empirical published and grey
literature on the impact of closing or reopening schools on COVID-19 incidence,
hospitalisation, and mortality.

Methods
The study protocol for this systematic review is registered on Prospero
(ID:CRD42020213699).
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
We included any empirical study which reported a quantitative estimate of the effect of
school closure or reopening on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We considered
‘school’ to include early years settings (e.g. nurseries or kindergartens), primary schools, and
secondary school, but excluded further or higher education (e.g. universities). Community
transmission was defined as any measure of community infection rate, hospital admission
rate, or mortality attributed to COVID-19.
We included studies published in 2020 only. We included pre-prints, peer-reviewed and grey
literature. We did not apply any restriction on language, but all searches were undertaken in
English. We excluded prospective modelling studies and studies in which the assessed
outcome was exclusively transmission within the school environment rather than wider
community transmission.
Search strategy
We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, the WHO Global COVID-19
Research Database (including Medrxiv), ERIC, the British Education Index, and the Australian
Education Index, searching title and abstracts for terms related to SARS-CoV-2 AND terms
related to schools or NPIs. To search the grey literature, we searched Google. Full details of
the search strategy are included in Appendix A. No restrictions on dates were placed and all
searches were undertaken on 12 October 2020.
Data extraction and risk of bias assessment
Article titles and abstracts were imported into the Rayyan QCRI webtool11. Two reviewers
independently screened titles and abstracts, retrieved full texts of potentially relevant
articles, and assessed eligibility for inclusion (SW assessed all articles; AC, SR and VB each
assessed one third).
Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Data extraction was
performed using a pre-agreed extraction template which collected information on
publication type (peer-reviewed or pre-print), country, study design, exposure type (school
closure or re-opening), setting type (primary or secondary), study period, unit of
observation, confounders adjusted for, other NPIs in place, analysis method, outcome
measure, and findings. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of
Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool12 to evaluate bias.
Discrepancies were resolved by discussion in the first instance and by a third reviewer if
necessary.
Data synthesis
Given the heterogeneous nature of the studies, prohibiting meta-analysis, a narrative
synthesis was conducted.

Results
We identified 3,318 studies (Figure 1). After removing 372 duplicates, 2,946 unique records
were screened for inclusion. We excluded 2,814 records at the title or abstract stage,
leaving 132 records for full text review. Ten of these met the inclusion criteria.
Included studies are described in Table 1. All studies 13–22 reported the effect of school
closures on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and one study21 additionally examined
school re-opening. All studies used data from national Government sources or international
data repositories, and reported on the first half of 2020.
Six studies reported data from a single country or region: the USA13,14,17,20 (n=4), Japan15
(n=1), and Jerusalem, Israel21 (n=1). The remaining four reported data from multiple
countries, of which two16,19 provided estimates for an overall worldwide effect of school
closures, and two provided estimates for three individual countries each (one study22
France, Italy, USA; the other18 Argentina, Italy, South Korea). All studies were ecological, and
used a state (USA), regional, or national unit of analysis.
Five studies13,15,17,20,21 specified that both primary and secondary schools were included
(children aged 5 or 6 to 18); the others did not specify school type. No study provided
independent estimates of the effect of closing either primary or secondary schools only.
Six studies specifically sought to estimate an effect of school closures on SARS-CoV-2
transmission.13–15,17,18,21 The remaining four studies primarily sought to estimate the effect
of NPIs (but reported an independent estimate for school closures within their analysis)
.16,19,20,22
Several analytic approaches were used, including: various types of regression models (n7),13,14,16–20,22 time series analysis with Bayesian inference (n=1),15 comparison to a synthetic
control group derived from data from comparable countries (n=1),18 and presentation of an
epidemic curve21.
In most instances of school closures, other NPIs were introduced at or around the same
time and potentially confounded the estimate. One study17 dealt with this by selecting US
states that closed schools first and left a gap before implementing other NPI measures.
Whilst another study18 took a similar approach, choosing countries (South Korea, Italy and
Argentina) that shut schools early relative to national lockdown; these countries had
significant other NPIs in place at the time of school closure. Four studies13,14,22,23 used
statistical adjustment to control for other interventions. Four studies15,16,20,21 did not
account for other NPIs. Some studies also adjusted for other potential confounders, such as
population factors (e.g. proportion of population aged ³65, population density and testing
regimes).
Regarding outcomes, eight studies13–17,19,21,22 reported effects on incidence, and four
studies13,17,18,20 used mortality data (one of which17 additionally reported hospitalisation
rates). The assumed lag period from school closure to changes in incidence rate varied
between seven and 20 days, with longer time periods of 26 to 28 days generally assumed
for mortality.

Risk of bias of the studies is summarised in Table 2: two studies were found to be at low risk
of bias14,22, two at moderate risk13,17, five at serious risk15,16,18–20 and one at critical risk21.
Table 3 reports study findings. Seven studies13,16–21 reported that closing schools was
associated with a reduction in incidence or mortality rates, whilst three14,15,22 found no
association. There was significant heterogeneity in the reported effect size of closing
schools, ranging from precise estimates of no effect, to approximately halving the incidence
and mortality rates13. The two studies with the lowest risk of bias14,22 reported no effect of
school closures on transmission.
At a country level, four studies13,14,17,20 exclusively reported data from the USA, and one
further study22 reported an independent effect size for the USA. The results from these
studies are discordant, with two studies reporting null effects14,22, and the other studies
reporting large preventative effects.13,17,20 Two studies reported effect estimates for Italy,
one being preventative18 and one22 tending towards a non-significant preventative effect.
Single estimates that were preventative were observed for the following countries:
Argentina18, Israel21, and South Korea18; with single estimates of no association for France22
and Japan15.
Of the eight studies that reported an effect on incidence, five13,16,17,19,21 were preventative
and three14,15,22 had no effect. Only one study17 reported an effect on hospitalisation, which
was preventative. All four of the studies13,17,18,20 that reported an effect on mortality
reported a preventative effect.
Narrative Synthesis
We identified three study designs: within-area before-after comparisons, pooled multiplearea before-after comparisons, and pooled multiple-area cross-sectional comparisons.
Within-area before-after comparisons
Five studies15,17,18,21,22 compared community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 before and after
school closure/re-opening for single geographical units. This approach controls for
confounding from population sociodemographic factors.
Of these, two studies sought to adjust for other NPIs.
Hsiang et al.22 (low risk of bias) used a reduced form of econometric regression to compare
changes in incidence in six countries (China, France, Iran, Italy, USA and South Korea) before
and after NPI implementation. Other key NPIs and testing regimes were adjusted for. Effect
sizes for school closures were only reported for France, Italy and the USA; but (and without
explanation) not for China, Iran or South Korea. The authors report a null effect of school
closures on growth rate of SARS-CoV-2 incidence, with narrow confidence intervals for
France and the USA, but a regression coefficient suggestive of a non-significant preventative
effect in Italy (-0·11 (95% CI -0·25, 0·03)).
Neidhofer et al.18 (serious risk of bias) used a difference in difference comparison to
estimate reduction in deaths in the 18 days post-school closure in Argentina, Italy and South
Korea; compared with synthetic controls derived from the weighted average of epidemic
curves from countries that closed schools later. This method indirectly adjusted for some

confounders by selecting the most comparable countries with regards to both
sociodemographic features and the number of SARS-CoV-2 deaths at the time of closure
(Argentina 2, South Korea 22, Italy 80). The authors reported a 63%-90% reduction, 21%35% reduction, and 72%-96% reduction in the daily average COVID-19 deaths in Argentina,
Italy and South Korea respectively. The small number of cumulative deaths in Argentina and
South Korea at the start of the study period made reliable extrapolation of mortality trends
to inform the control units unlikely.
The other three studies did not analytically adjust for other NPIs.
Matzinger et al.17 (moderate risk of bias) identified the three US states which introduced
school closures first, and with a sufficient lag before implementing other measures to assess
their specific impact. They plotted incidence rates on a log2 scale and identified points of
inflexion in the period after school closure. This assumes exponential growth in the absence
of interventions, which may not have occurred given changes to testing regimes. The
doubling time of new cases in Georgia slowed from 2·1 to 3·4 days one week after closing
schools. Similar results were observed in Mississippi (1·4 to 3·4 days) and Tennessee (2·0 to
4·2 days). The authors also noted inflexion points for hospitalisations and mortality,
although numerical changes were not reported. Tennessee showed a slowing in
hospitalisations after one week, and deaths another week later; whereas Mississippi shows
a slowing of both at the same time (after one week) – the authors do not comment on this
discrepancy. Georgia lacked early hospitalisation data to make such a comparison.
Iwata et al.15 (serious risk of bias) used time series analysis with Bayesian Inference to
estimate the effects of school closures on SARS-CoV-2 incidence in Japan, reporting a null
effect. Whilst growth in cases was observed during the study period, the number of cases
remained low (<100 cases per day). Publicly available data24 shows implementation of mass
gathering bans occurred with school closures, and foreign travel bans were already in place.
Stein-Zamir et al.21 (critical risk of bias) reported an age-stratified epidemic curve of SARSCoV-2 incidence in Jerusalem, with identification of the timing of school closures and reopenings. They show a large reduction in incidence starting one week after schools closed,
with proportional reductions across all age groups; and a resurgence in case numbers
around two weeks after schools were gradually re-opened, predominantly driven by
younger age groups. There is no adjustment for other NPIs, though school closures were
implemented alongside mass gathering bans and other social distancing rules; whilst school
re-openings coincided with lifting hospitality and retail restrictions, and relaxing mass
gathering bans25. Mass testing of a single secondary school was undertaken as part of an
outbreak investigation, and the sharp increase in the number of new cases amongst young
people is almost entirely accounted for by the cases identified by this.
Pooled multiple-area before-after comparisons.
Three studies13,14,20 reported data on multiple geographical units, and then pooled the
results into one unified estimate of effect using regression analysis.
One study had a low risk of bias and reported a null effect. Courtemanche et al.14 used a
fixed effects model (which accounts for inter-area sociodemographic differences) to
estimate the effect of school closures on SARS-CoV-2 incidence in US counties. They
adjusted for relevant NPIs and testing regime confounders, and reported a null effect of
school closures on growth rate applying a lag of either 10 or 20 days.

Two studies had a higher risk of bias due to a lack of adjustment for confounding NPIs, and
reported preventative effects.
Auger et al.13 (moderate risk of bias) used interrupted time series analysis to calculate the
rate of change in SARS-CoV-2 incidence and mortality in US states, and then used negative
binomial regression to combine effect sizes into one pooled national estimate. Stepwise
regression was used to build models, excluding covariates with P values >0·20, resulting in
exclusion of several NPIs and testing regime data from their models. They estimated that
school closures reduced incidence and mortality by c.60%.
Yehya et al.20 (serious risk of bias) also used negative binomial regression to combine the
observed effects in US states, with COVID-19 mortality as the outcome measure. Relevant
sociodemographic differences between states were accounted for as confounders in the
multivariable model. However, they did not adjust for the effect of other NPIs. They
estimated that school closures reduced COVID-19-related deaths by 5% per day.
Pooled multiple-area cross-sectional comparisons
Two studies16,19 considered countries from around the world in a cross-sectional design in
which NPIs were considered as binary variables on a specific date: in place or not in place,
and the cumulative incidence to that point was compared to the number of new cases of
COVID-19 over a subsequent follow-up period; countries were then compared using
regression analysis to elicit independent effect sizes for individual policies including school
closures. This approach reduces bias from different testing regimes over time and between
countries. However, the use of a single cut-off date for whether school closure was in place
means that that the effects of long-standing and more recent school closures were pooled.
Both studies reported preventative effects of school closures on SARS-CoV-2 incidence (Juni
et al.16:23% relative reduction in the incidence rate, Wong et al.19: 50% relative reduction).
Juni et al.16 (serious risk of bias) used an exposure cut-off date of 20 March 2020 with a tenday lag period and seven-day follow-up period. The authors adjusted for a comprehensive
set of sociodemographic and geographical confounders (see Table 3) but did not adjust for
the effect of other NPIs because they were implemented around the same time as school
closures. Wong et al.19 (serious risk of bias) used a cut-off data of 31 March with a 14-day
lag period and a 14-day follow-up period. The authors only adjusted for potential
sociodemographic confounding from gross domestic product and population density. The
authors did adjust for the presence of other NPIs using the Stringency Index, but this does
not include relevant measures such as social distancing rules or mask wearing.

Discussion
We identified ten studies that provided a quantitative estimate of the impact of school
closures on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The studies spanned a range of
countries and were heterogenous in design. Findings ranged from no association to a 62%
relative reduction in incidence and mortality rate13. The studies at lowest risk of bias
reported no association14,22 (figure 2), whilst those with a higher risk of bias generally
reported preventative effects. An exception was a paper by Matzinger et al.17 which focused
on US states that implemented school closures first and without co-interventions, and
reported a two-fold increase in the time for cases to double one week after school closures.
A major challenge with estimating the ‘independent’ effect of school closures is
disentangling their effect from other NPIs occurring at the same time. Most studies tried to
account for this, but it is unclear how effective these methods were. In direct
correspondence one author reported that adjustment for other NPI was not possible due to
clustering.16 Even where adjustment occurred there is a risk of residual confounding, which
likely overestimated preventative associations; and collinearity (highly-correlated
independent variables meaning that is impossible to estimate specific effects for each)
which could bias results towards or away from the null. Four studies did not specifically seek
to estimate an effect size for school closures, instead studying school closures as an example
of NPIs. These studies may not have specified the model in an optimal way to estimate
effects of school closures. The divergent results for the USA, highlight these problems and
may suggest that methodological differences are an important cause in the variation of the
findings.
The strength of this study is that it draws on empirical data from actual school closures
during the COVID-19 pandemic and includes data from 146 countries. By necessity, we
include observational rather than randomised controlled studies, as understandably no
jurisdictions have undertaken such trials. We were unable to meta-analyse due to study
heterogeneity. We were unable to examine differences between primary and secondary
schools as no studies distinguished between them, despite the different transmission
patterns for younger and older children.
The studies are not able to distinguish between the direct and indirect effect of school
closures. Indirect effects might include parents staying at home (reducing workplace
contacts), and the signalling effect that closing schools sends to the general population to be
cautious and reduce social contacts. Whilst some studies reported effects on mortality, it
was not always clear whether the specified timeframe was appropriate. Interventions
affecting children would be expected to have a longer lag than other interventions: to allow
time for impacts on infections in older adults and ultimately mortality. Data are also lacking
from low-income countries, where sociocultural factors may produce different effects of
school closures on transmission to high income settings, leaving a substantial gap in the
evidence base.
Our estimates describe the impact of school closures policies early in the year. School reopening, with substantial infection prevention measures in place, may have a very different
effect on community transmission. Where school re-openings have occurred but other NPIs
have remained, less biased estimates of effect may be possible. Data from school holidays

should also be considered for future high-quality natural experiment studies. In addition,
none of the included studies used mobility or genomic sequencing of viral strains which may
have allowed for a mechanistic understanding of how school closures effect community
transmission patterns.
The variability in findings from our included studies are likely to reflect issues with study
design. However, this may also suggest that there is no single effect of school closures on
community transmission and that contextual factors may modify the impact of closures in
different countries and over time. If the purpose of school closures is reduction in social
contacts among children, the level of social mixing between children that occurs outside
school once schools are closed is likely to be a key determinant of their effect at reducing
community transmission . This will be influenced by other NPIs, and other key contextual
factors including background prevalence of infection, age of children affected, as well as
sociodemographic and cultural factors.
Different countries have adopted different approaches to controlling COVID-19. In the first
wave of the pandemic school closures were common, and in some places one of the first
major social distancing measures used. In contrast, the UK Government’s strategy for
managing the second wave has prioritised keeping educational institutions open. With such
varied findings and quality of evidence on the effect of school closures on limiting
community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and given the harmful effects of school closures3,4,
policymakers and governments need to take a measured approach before implementing
school closures in response to rising infection rates.Other evidence, such as the harms of
school closures and transmission patterns in children should be considered alongside the
evidence presented here when making decisions about school closures. Less damaging
measures such as effective test, trace and isolate regimes in schools, as well as enhanced
hygiene and social distancing measures should be considered as alternatives to school
closures. This work also underscores the need for a robust and systematic approaches to the
evaluation of all interventions deployed in a pandemic, not just those readily amenable to
randomisation.

Courtemanche,
2020

Regression coefficient
estimating effect of school
closures on the growth rate
of cases (% change)

No effect:
School closure not statistically associated with the
growth rate of confirmed cases. Adjusted models:
Italy: -0·11 (95% CI -0·25, 0·03)
France: -0·01 (95% CI -0·09, 0·07)
USA: 0·03 (95% CI -0·03, 0·09)
No effect:
School closure not statistically associated with the
growth rate of confirmed cases. Adjusted models:
Applying a 10-day lag: 1·71% (95% CI -0·38%, 3·79%)
Applying a 20-day lag: 0·17% (95% CI -1·60%, 1·94%)

Regression coefficient
estimating effect of school
closures on changes to
weekly incidence rates

Preventative effect:
School closures were associated with decreases in the
rate of growth of COVID-19 incidence. Adjusted
model: 62% (95% CI: 49% - 71%) relative reduction in
COVID-19 incidence.

Sensitivity analysis of shorter and longer
lag periods did not significantly alter the
findings.

change in daily incidence rate

No effect:
School closure not statistically associated with the
incidence rate of new cases. Expected daily decrease
in daily new reported cases: 0·08 (95% CI -0·36, 0·65)

Sensitivity analysis for different lag times
did not change the general finding of null
effect.

Juni, 2020

Regression coefficient
estimating effect of school
closures on changes to the
incidence rate

Preventative effect:
School closures were statistically significantly
associated with a relative reduction in the incidence
rate of COVID-19. Adjusted model:
0·77 (95% CI 0·63 – 0·93) P=0·009

Sensitivity analyses of separating out high
income countries, and areas with higher
prevalence did not significantly affect the
results.

Wong, 2020

Regression coefficient

Preventative effect:
School closures were associated with a smaller rate of
increase in cumulative incidence of COVID-19.

Critical Risk of Bias
Stein-Zamir,
2020

Presentation of an agestratified epidemic curve
showing confirmed cases of
COVID-19 in Jerusalem, by
date, and comparing to dates
of school closure/re-opening

Preventative effect:
School closures were associated with a reduction in
new cases of COVID-19. School reopenings were
associated with an increase in new cases of COVID-19.
Difficult to elicit exact effect sizes from the epidemic
curve, but approximately one week after schools were
closed, the number of new cases started to decline.
Approximately two weeks after schools started to
reopen, the number of new cases started to increase

Reductions in cases after school closures
appeared to be proportionately distributed
throughout the age groups. Increases in
cases after school reopening was more
pronounced in younger age groups (10-19),
but were also seen across all ages to a
lesser extent

Preventative effect:
School closures were associated with decreases in the
rate of growth of COVID-19 mortality. Adjusted
model: 58% (95% CI 46% - 67%) relative reduction in
mortality per week.

Sensitivity analysis of shorter and longer
lag periods did not significantly alter the
findings.

Mortality

mortality than late closure

Matzinger, 2020

Changes to the doubling time
of the number of
hospitalisations and deaths in
each state, following school
closures

Preventative effect:
School closures were associated with reductions in the
doubling time of new COVID-19 hospitalisations and
deaths. Patterns appeared to be similar to changes in
incidence, lagging behind by 7-14 days, though these
data were not always reported and more difficult to
interpret.

Neidhofer, 2020

% Reduction in deaths in the
18 days post-school closure,
compared to synthetic
control unit

Preventative effect:
School closures were associated with reductions in
COVID-19 mortality. Results by country:
Argentina: 63% - 90% reduction, Italy: 21% - 35%
reduction, South Korea: 72% - 96% reduction in daily
average COVID-19 deaths

Sensitivity analysis using only excess
mortality in Italy reached similar
conclusion.

Yehya, 2020

Regression coefficient
estimating increase in
mortality at 28 days
associated with each day
school closures were delayed

Preventative effect:
Every day a state delayed implementing school
closure increased mortality risk by 5% (MMR 1·05 95%
1·01, 1·09)

Sensitivity analyses for starting exposure
from 1st Covid death, or for excluding New
York/New Jersey from analysis, did not
significantly change the findings.
