Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of
coronavirus. There are three phases of COVID-19: early infection stage, pulmonary stage and
hyper-inflammation stage respectively. It is important to prevent lung or other organs injuries by
preventing phase-II and phase-III via pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatments. This
was a case series study done on twenty-two patients confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2
and diagnosed with COVID-19. Patients in this study have been used quercetin 800 mg,
bromelain 165 mg, zinc acetate 50 mg and ascorbic acid 1 g once daily as supplements for 3 to 5
days during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
quercetin, bromelain, zinc and ascorbic acid combination supplements on patients with COVID19. The mean levels of WBC, ANC, ALC, AMC and AST were normal among all included
patients before and after taking quercetin, bromelain, zinc and ascorbic acid supplements (P-value
> 0.05). Quercetin 800 mg, bromelain 165 mg, zinc acetate 50 mg and ascorbic acid 1 g once
daily supplements were safe for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may prevent poor
prognosis. Randomized clinical trials needed in the future to ensure the efficacy of quercetin,
bromelain, zinc and vitamin c combination.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of
coronavirus.]1[ More than thirty million people around the world have been infected and got
COVID-19, and at least one million of them died because of the disease complication including
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm.]2[
There are three phases of COVID-19: phase-I (early infection stage); in which SARS-CoV-2
starts to spread and proliferate and innate immunity activated. Phase-II (pulmonary stage);
characterized by lung tissue injury and increased leucocytes recruitment. Phase-III (hyperinflammation stage); which various organs could be damaged and there is an extreme
exacerbation of immune response. In order to treat COVID-19 patients; it is important to prevent
lung or other organs injury by preventing phase-II and phase-III via pharmacological or nonpharmacological treatments.]3[
Quercetin is a natural flavonoid molecule that distributed broadly in many fruits and
vegetables including red onion, cranberry, kale, tomatoes, Hungarian wax and watercress.]4[ It
was revealed in previous studies that quercetin has an anti-inflammatory and anti-hypersensitivity
effect by preventing pro-inflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes through inhibiting of
cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes, therefore; quercetin was used as an
extract in various trials to treat different infectious and non-infectious diseases.]5[ In addition,
quercetin showed to reduce tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) production with chronic
inflammation.]6[ Reduction in the ratio of CD4+:CD8+ T cells and suppression of macrophages,
dendritic, mast cells and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were revealed after a specific tissue was
treated with quercetin in pre-clinical studies (see figure.1).]7-8[ Besides, quercetin expected to has
antiviral activity by acting as a zinc chelator and as a zinc ionophore as well.]9[ However, because
most of these studies were done by using quercetin in-vitro with high concentration and in-vivo
studies cannot use the same doses; it’s showed minimum effect during clinical trials. The
available data clarifies that quercetin is a very safe molecule and used as a nutritional supplement
with a dose reached 1500 mg divided per day.]10[
Bromelain is a protein enzyme that found mainly in the stem of the pineapple plant. The
bioavailability of bromelain was high through the oral route, and was safe even when consumed
more than 11 grams per day.]11[ In vitro studies showed that bromelain exerts anti-inflammatory
effects through reducing bradykinin serum]12[ and modulating the expression of some genes
related to inflammation.]13[ Three genes related to inflammation including TLR4, TNF-α and IL-8
were found to be less expressed after bromelain treatment (see figure.2). On the other hand,
PPARγ gene expression was elevated after treatment with bromelain.]14[ Therefore, bromelain
may have a role in reducing inflammations during various disorders and may be used in
combination with other analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs.
Since the inflammatory status of patients during COVID-19 may lead to severe
consequences and even death if not prevented or treated adequately; it is important to ensure high
quality care to patients and provide evidence-based prophylaxis and treatment.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of quercetin, bromelain, zinc and ascorbic acid
supplements on patients with COVID-19.

Methods
Study design and subjects
This was a case series study conducted between June and September 2020 on twenty-two patients
confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosed with COVID-19. The study subjects
included are adults and hospitalized in Imam Abdulrahman Alfaisal Hospital in Riyadh.

Supplements and measurements
COVID-19 patients in this study have been used quercetin 800 mg, bromelain 165 mg, zinc
acetate 50 mg and ascorbic acid 1 g once daily as supplements for 3 to 5 days during SARS-CoV2 infection. A number of laboratory tests were done for all patients included in this study. These
tests include absolute neutrophil count (ANC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), absolute
monocyte count (AMC), hemoglobin (Hb), platelets (Plts), potassium (K), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), oxygen saturation percentage (SaO2), D-dimer and white blood cells
(WBCs). In addition, medical and medication history were reported.

Endpoint and statistical analysis
The primary endpoint was to ensure the efficacy of quercetin, bromelain, zinc and ascorbic acid
supplements by evaluating the laboratory results pre- and post-supplements. Paired t-test was
used to reveal the differences between different lab tests before and after quercetin, bromelain,
zinc and vitamin c combination supplement among patients.

Ethical approval
Institutional review board (IRB) was obtained from the Saudi ministry of health on the 7th of June
2020 with the central IRB log number: 20-95M.

Results
Twenty-two hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, all of
them were taking quercetin, bromelain, zinc and ascorbic acid as supplements. The mean age of
patients was 49.27 years, and 59% of them were older than 50 years old. The percentage of male
patients was 68.18%. More than 13% of the patients were having chronic diseases. About half of
the patients were receiving antibacterial and antiviral medications during hospitalization, and
63.63% of total patients were on anti-coagulants. Days of stay average was 9 days (see table.1).

The mean D-dimer level at admission was elevated (1.0082 mcg/ml). Mean WBCs levels at
admission and at discharge were 7440 and 8550 cells/mm3 respectively (P-value = 0.34). Mean
ANC at admission and at discharge were 5570 and 5800 cells/microliter respectively (P-value =
0.86). O2sat% mean was less than 94% at admission, and was more than 94% at discharge (Pvalue = 0.83). AST mean levels were slightly elevated at admission and at discharge (46 and 44.8
U/L respectively, P-value = 0.9). Mean ALC was 1240 at admission and was 1740
cells/microliter at discharge (P-value = 0.11). Mean platelets count at admission and at discharge
were 243830 and 304200 cells/microliter respectively (P-value = 0.45). The mean AMC was 456
at admission and 587 cells/microliters (P-value = 0.09). Regarding hemoglobin mean levels, it
was 13.68 at admission and 13.24 g/dl at discharge (P-value = 0.78). Mean potassium
concentration at admission and at discharge were 4.53 and 4.38 mmol/l (P-value = 0.45) (see
table.2).

Discussion
Quercetin supplement was and still interested by many researchers globally since various types of
studies were focusing on it. Regarding studies about infectious diseases; quercetin was studied
with Zika virus]15[, Ebola virus]16[, murine coronavirus]17[, dengue virus]18[, SARS-CoV-2]19[ and
influenza A virus]20[, and most of these studies conclude that quercetin may have a substantial role
as prophylactic or treatment of different types of viruses. Unlike quercetin, bromelain supplement
was not widely studied about its efficacy against infections, however, few types of researches
done claimed that bromelain could prevent or eradicate some microorganisms including
Escherichia coli]21[ and SARS-CoV-2.]22[
In this study, the mean D-dimer level of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 was more than 0.5
mcg/ml; which indicates that their condition was not mild and need hospitalization based on the
Chinese study. In addition to quercetin and bromelain supplements, most of the twenty-two
patients were on hospital medications which include vitamin C, zinc, enoxaparin, drugs expected
to have an anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect (ribavirin, hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir) and
antibacterial drugs. As shown in the results, all the patients’ lab tests done at admission and at
discharge were not significantly different and the mean days of stay at the hospital was 9 days.
These results reveal that quercetin 800 mg once daily with bromelain 165 mg, in addition to zinc
acetate 50 mg and vitamin c 1 g supplements are safe with COVID-19 patients who were on
multiple therapies including antivirals and antibacterial medications. The efficacy of quercetin,
bromelain, zinc and ascorbic acid combination was not clear in this study, because of lacking
placebo or comparable group; however, their efficacy in preventing severe consequences of
SARS-CoV-2 infections cannot be ruled out based on previous studies (see figure.3). Large
comparable studies need to be done about quercetin and bromelain to confirm their efficacy in
treating COVID-19 cases.

Conclusion
Quercetin 800 mg, bromelain 165 mg, zinc acetate 50 mg and ascorbic acid 1 g once daily as
supplements for 3 to 5 days were safe for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may prevent
poor prognosis through restraining from hyper-inflammation and cytokine storm. Randomized
