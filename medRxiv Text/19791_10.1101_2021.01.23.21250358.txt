Abstract

22

AIMS OF THE STUDY: The novel coronavirus pandemic has affected emergency department

23

consultations for surgical pathologies. The aim of our study was to compare the number of acute

24

appendicitis cases and the proportion of complicated appendicitis before and during the COVID-19

25

pandemic.

26

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all data collected from a multi-center database of

27

patients presenting to the emergency department for acute appendicitis during the COVID-19

28

pandemic from March 12 to June 6, 2020, and compared these data with those from the same

29

periods in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The number of acute appendicitis cases, proportion of complicated

30

appendicitis, and pre- and postoperative patient characteristics were evaluated.

31

RESULTS: A total of 306 patients were included in this evaluation. Sixty-five patients presented

32

during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (group A), and 241 patients in previous years (group

33

B: 2017–2019). The number of consultations for acute appendicitis decreased by almost 20 percent

34

during the pandemic compared with previous periods, with a significant increase in complicated

35

appendicitis (52% in group A versus 20% in group B, p < 0,001.). Comparing the two groups,

36

significant differences were also noted in the duration of symptoms ( symptoms > 48h in 61% and

37

26% , p < 0,001), the intervention time ( 77 vs 61 minutes, p = 0,002), length of hospital stay (

38

hospitalization of > 2 days in 63% and 32%, p < 0.001) and duration of antibiotic treatment (

39

antibiotics > 3 days in 36% and 24% p = 0.001).

40

CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decreased number of consultations for

41

acute appendicitis, with a higher proportion of complicated appendicitis, most likely due to patient

should be aware of this problem to avoid a time delay from initial symptoms to consultation.

Introduction

46

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (causing COVID-19) was first recognized in China in December

47

2019 and rapidly spread throughout the world. The COVID-19 disease outbreak was declared a

48

pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 [1]. Because of the high

49

contagious potential of this virus, many hospitals quickly experienced patient overload and an

50

increased need to use respiratory assistance in infected patients. Consequently, many countries

51

announced a state of emergency and advised the population to stay at home whenever possible.

52

However, patients’ fear of becoming infected by the virus obviously also led to a marked reduction in

53

consultations at emergency departments, even in the case of abdominal symptoms [2].

54

Appendicitis is one of the most common causes of acute abdominal pain and is one of the most

55

frequent reasons for emergency surgery [3]. Complicated appendicitis is defined as gangrenous or

56

perforated appendicitis or peri-appendicular abscess formation. Longer duration of symptoms prior

57

to consultation is a well-known risk factor for developing complicated appendicitis [4].

58

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of consultations for acute appendicitis decreased. While

59

some studies demonstrated a higher rate of complicated appendicitis, probably due to delayed

60

consultation, other studies have reported no change in the rates of uncomplicated/complicated

61

appendicitis during this period [5–8].

62

The aim of our study was to analyze the incidence of acute appendicitis as well the rates of

63

uncomplicated/complicated appendicitis during the COVID-19 lockdown period and to compare

64

these data with a comparable period in previous years. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic

65

resulted in a decreased number of consultations for acute appendicitis, a longer delay to first

consultation, a higher proportion of complicated appendicitis, longer use of post-surgery antibiotic

67

treatment, and longer hospital stay, most likely due to patient delay in consulting the emergency

68

department at symptom onset.

69

Materials and methods

70

Data from patients was extracted from prospective digital databases of a multi-site tertiary care

71

hospital (HFR, Cantonal Hospital of Fribourg) and a secondary care hospital (Daler Hospital). The

72

retrospective analysis included all patients who presented at the respective EDs for acute

73

appendicitis during the COVID-19 lockdown period in Switzerland from March 12 to June 6, 2020

74

(group A), and for comparison data of patients presenting for the same reason and during the same

75

period of the year in 2017, 2018, and 2019 (group B).

76

Data analysis

77

Demographic data, biologic and inflammatory markers at presentation, duration of symptoms until

78

presentation to the ED, duration of antibiotic treatment, and duration of hospital stay were

79

recorded. Each operation protocol was separately evaluated and the severity of appendicitis

80

classified according to the laparoscopic grading score of Gomes [9]: briefly, normal-looking appendix

81

= grade 0, non-complicated appendicitis with redness and edema = grade 1, with additional fibrin

82

layers = grade 2, complicated appendicitis with segmental peripheral necrosis = grade 3A, with

83

necrosis of the appendix base = grade 3B, with abscess formation = grade 4A, with regional

84

peritonitis = grade 4B, and with diffuse peritonitis = grade 5.

85

In addition, histopathologic results were recorded and classified into five groups: grade 0 = no

86

inflammation, grade 1 = acute appendicitis, grade 2 = ulcero-phlegmonous appendicitis, grade 3 =

87

necrotizing or gangrenous appendicitis, grade 4 = abscess formation, and grade 5 = perforated

88

appendicitis. Grades 1 and 2 were classified as non-complicated and grades 3–5 as complicated

89

appendicitis.

90

Finally, patient data were compared between group A (COVID lockdown, March 12–June 6, 2020)

91

and group B (March 12–June 6, 2017, 2018, and 2019).

92

Statistical analysis

93

Statistical analysis was performed utilizing the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 27.0

94

(SPSS, IBM, Armonk, USA). Quantitative variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD)

95

and ranges. Qualitative variables were expressed as raw numbers, proportions, and percentages.

96

Pearson’s chi-square test was used to search for differences between categorical variables while the

97

Student t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for continuous variables. All results were

98

expressed with a 95% confidence interval, and statistical significance was defined as a P value <0.05.

99

This study was approved by the local Ethics Committee (Project -ID 2020-01676).

100

Results

101

Number of appendicitis cases

102

A total of 311 patients presented to the respective EDs for suspicion of acute appendicitis during the

103

reviewed periods. Five patients with a different peri-operative diagnosis were excluded from

104

analysis. In all, 306 patients were enrolled, including 65 who presented during the COVID-19

105

lockdown and 245 in the years before (80 patients in 2017, 78 in 2018, and 87 in 2019). On an annual

106

basis, the total number of patients presenting with acute appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic

107

decreased by almost 20% when compared with the years before.

Patients’ pre-operative characteristics

112

There were no statistically significant differences in median age and sex distribution between the

113

groups. In 12 patients, the duration of symptoms prior to consultation could not be re-evaluated.

114

However, most of the patients in group A (61%) presented at the ED more than 48 h after the

115

beginning of symptoms, compared with 26% in group B (P < 0.001). Regarding the biologic

116

inflammatory markers at presentation, plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly higher in

117

group A compared with group B (P < 0.007), while the white blood cell count (WBC) was only slightly

118

and nonsignificantly higher in group A (P = 0.438) when compared with group B. The demographic,

119

clinical, and biological data of the two groups are summarized in Table 1.

Operative and postoperative characteristics

166

Six patients (2%) were treated conservatively, one patient during the COVID-19 period and five

167

patients in group B. Among them, five patients presented with complicated appendicitis diagnosed

168

on imaging and were treated using antibiotic therapy and transabdominal drainage. One patient with

169

a non-complicated appendicitis and multiple comorbidities underwent antibiotic treatment only.

170

One patient was operated on using an open McBurney approach; the remainder all underwent a

171

laparoscopic intervention (Table 2).

Patients in the COVID-19 group had a significantly longer intervention time, 77 vs. 61 minutes (mean,

186

P = 0.002), and a higher rate of transabdominal drainage, 28% vs. 12%, (P = 0.002) in group A vs. B,

187

respectively. Post surgery, there was a longer need for antibiotics in group A compared with group B

188

patients (P = 0.001). The percentages of patients who underwent antibiotic therapy for more than 3

189

days were 36% and 24% in group A and B, respectively (P = 0.001). Information regarding the

190

duration of antibiotic treatment was not available for five patients in group A .

191

In addition, patients in group A experienced a significantly longer hospital stay when compared with

patients of group B: 63% and 32% of patients were hospitalized ≥2 days in groups A and B,

respectively (P < 0.001).

Discussion

196

The present study demonstrates a diminished rate of patients presenting at the ER with acute

197

appendicitis, a longer delay to first consultation, a higher rate of complicated appendicitis, and a

198

prolonged hospital stay in patients presenting during the COVID-19 pandemic period when compared

199

with previous years.

200

The incidence of acute appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic is comparable to the findings of

201

other reported studies [5–7, 10–12]. The encouragement by authorities to stay at home whenever

202

possible, along with fear of being contaminated by the virus, might explain the fact of fewer

203

consultations at emergency departments. Additionally, some spontaneous resolution of the disease

204

might further explain the reduced rate of patients with diagnosis of acute appendicitis during the

205

COVID-19 period. Seasonal changes and a tendency to a decreasing incidence of acute appendicitis

206

over the years have also also reported as possible factors responsible for this finding [11, 13].

207

However, because in the present study the same seasonal periods over consecutive years were

208

compared, it is unlikely that seasonal changes affected the incidence of acute appendicitis. A trend of

209

fewer patients with acute appendicitis during the 3 previous years has not been confirmed by our

210

evaluation.

211

Pre-operative investigations of the studied patients demonstrated a significantly higher CRP value at

212

presentation in affected patients during the COVID-19 period when compared with previous time

213

periods. Our study also demonstrated that the majority of patients (61%) admitted during the COVID-

214

19 period presented later than 48 hours after the beginning of symptoms, compared with only 26%

215

in previous years. A lower consultation rate and a higher delay to first consultation has been

216

reported to be directly related to a higher rate of complicated appendicitis in such patients [14]. Our

217

study confirms this finding, with significantly more patients with complicated appendicitis during the

218

COVID-19 period when compared with previous years. This is in accord with other published reports

219

[6–8, 10, 15]. However, Tankel et al. [5] did not observe different rates of non-complicated and

220

complicated appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic. They therefore concluded that some

221

patients with beginning appendicitis might possibly be treated conservatively.

222

Our results show a longer mean intervention time during the COVID-19 lockdown that is easily

223

explained by the higher rate of complicated appendicitis. In addition, most of our patients admitted

224

during the lockdown period had a significantly longer hospital stay when compared with patients of

225

the pre-pandemic group. Furthermore, prolonged post-operative antibiotic treatment during the

226

COVID-19 period was noted with respect to the previous years, and this is also explained by the

227

higher rate of complicated appendicitis. Interestingly, these results do not confirm those of other

228

studies [6, 7], where operation time and the post-operative recovery period were not different

229

during the COVID-19-period (first wave) when compared with previous years.

230

Our study has some limitations. First, the period from March 12 to June 6 was chosen according to

231

the coronavirus lockdown period in Switzerland. Choosing an earlier end date of the study might

232

have led to different results. Second, general practitioners might have treated some patients

233

conservatively without referring them to an emergency department, resulting in a possible

234

underestimation of the total number of patients with appendicitis during this period. However, in our

235

area general practitioners usually send most patients with a suspicion of acute appendicitis to the

236

emergency department in order that they undergo imaging studies to confirm the suspected

237

diagnosis. Thus, we believe that the number of patients who did not present to one of the

238

participating hospitals was rather low.

239

In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic induced a decrease in acute appendicitis cases in the EDs, with

240

a significant increase in complicated appendicitis. This phenomenon is most likely explained by

241

symptomatic patients’ substantially delaying medical consultation. The observed increased number

242

of patients with complicated appendicitis was associated with a longer intervention time, longer

243

antibiotic treatment, and a longer hospital stay compared with pre-pandemic patients. Since there

244

might be another lockdown due to COVID-19 or other pandemics in future, it would be helpful to

245

inform patients and general practitioners broadly of the importance of avoiding time delay from

246

onset of symptoms to consultation.
