ABSTRACT

19

Objective: Virological tests indicate that a novel coronavirus is the most likely

20

explanation for the 2019-20 pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China. We demonstrate that

21

non-virological descriptive characteristics could have determined that the outbreak is

22

caused by a novel pathogen in advance of virological testing.

23

Methods: Characteristics of the ongoing outbreak were collected in real time from two

24

medical social media sites. These were compared against characteristics of ten existing

25

pathogens that can induce atypical pneumonia. The probability that the current outbreak

26

is due to “Disease X” (i.e., previously unknown etiology) as opposed to one of the

27

known pathogens was inferred, and this estimate was updated as the outbreak

28

continued.

29

Results: The probability that Disease X is driving the outbreak was assessed as over

30

32% on 31 December 2019, one week before virus identification. After some specific

31

pathogens were ruled out by laboratory tests on 5 Jan 2020, the inferred probability of

32

Disease X was over 59%.

33

Conclusions: We showed quantitatively that the emerging outbreak of atypical

34

pneumonia cases is consistent with causation by a novel pathogen. The proposed

35

approach, that uses only routinely-observed non-virological data, can aid ongoing risk

36

assessments even before virological test results become available.

INTRODUCTION

40

A cluster of cases of atypical pneumonia with unknown etiology in Wuhan, China

41

attracted global attention at the end of 2019 (Wuhan Municipal Health Commission,

42

China, 2019; World Health Organization, 2020). An impressive series of rapid

43

virological examinations ruled out common pneumonia-causing viruses such as

44

influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and the coronaviruses associated with Middle East

45

respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Wuhan

46

Municipal Health Commission, China, 2019; Normile, 2020a, 2020b; World Health

47

Organization, 2020). As of 12 January 2020, the causative agent is suspected to be a

48

coronavirus of non-human origin (European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention,

49

2020; Normile, 2020b).

50

While examination of the viral genome is critical for identifying the pathogen,

51

information made publicly available in real time describing clinical characteristics and

52

other outbreak-related factors can also allow experts to consider the etiology and

53

thereby differential diagnoses. For instance, most cases shared a history of visiting or

54

working at a seafood market in Wuhan (Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, China,

55

2020), where exposure to the novel coronavirus is suspected to have occurred with no

56

evidence of direct human-to-human transmission (World Health Organization, 2020),

57

leading us to believe that the cluster of cases was due to “Disease X” (i.e., an infectious

58

disease of previously unknown viral etiology). However, rigorous quantitative

59

assessment of the chance that the disease is in fact Disease X has not previously been

60

undertaken. The present study addresses this, demonstrating that non-virological

61

information can lead to an objective classification of Disease X, using a simple

62

statistical model that exploits the well-known Bayes’ theorem.

METHODS

64

As the outbreak unfolded, we calculated in real-time the probability that the pathogen

65

responsible for the atypical pneumonia was novel (Disease X), or whether instead the

66

outbreak was generated by a previously known pathogen that can cause pneumonia. Our

67

analysis began on 30 December 2019, when the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission

68

announced that there had been a surprisingly large number of atypical pneumonia cases.

69

At that time, we assumed the causative agent could have been one of seven known viral

70

or three known bacterial diseases, along with the chance that it was instead Disease X.

71

We tracked two of the most active medical social media sites, i.e., ProMED (ProMED,

72

2020) and Flutracker (Flutracker, 2020), that reported the non-virological characteristics

73

of the outbreak, including atypical pneumonia, other clinical characteristics, and

74

exposure factors, as it progressed. These characteristics do not necessarily represent the

75

features that were causing disease, but are instead basic observations from the ongoing

76

outbreak. Given these characteristics, we then calculated the probability that the

77

ongoing outbreak is due to a known disease or unknown Disease X. On the first day of

78

calculation (i.e. 30 December 2019), the only explanatory factors we included was

79

atypical pneumonia, which was common to all enumerated diseases. Our analysis

80

represents simple logical deductions from the limited data that were available during the

81

outbreak in a quantitative manner and was updated to reflect new information about the

82

outbreak as it became available in real time.

83

Table 1 shows the information compiled about the current outbreak, and the

84

dates on which each of these characteristics were discovered. Each characteristic listed

85

was assigned a value of zero or one, denoting whether or not the characteristic of listed

86

outbreak, not individual cases, was likely for the emerging outbreak, and the equivalent

87

values for outbreaks of previously observed pathogens were also noted. We make two

88

assumptions to use and un-use a part of the input exposure characteristics: (i) previously

89

known disease outbreaks are all based on empirically observed notion (and do not

90

include the new exposure data (i.e., exposure at a wet market), that is specific to novel

91

coronavirus in Wuhan, which may be non-informative to other outbreaks for the

92

calculation) and (ii) all exposure characteristics are known for all previously known

93

outbreaks, incorporating all factors enumerated. Also, once pathogens were ruled out as

94

the causative agent of the current outbreak, they were removed from our analysis: for

95

example, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) (H5N1) was confirmed not to be

96

the causative agent by laboratory testing on 3 January. Hence, we omitted this pathogen

97

from our analysis from 3 January 2020 onwards.

98

To assess the probability that the emerging outbreak was caused by a variant of

99

a known pathogen, we first calculated the distance between the set of characteristics of

100

the ongoing outbreak and those of previously known pathogens. The distance between

101

the characteristics of the ongoing outbreak and cases due to pathogen j is denoted by dj.

102

We assumed that the probability that the outbreak is due to a variant of pathogen j

103

decreases exponentially with distance dj. Then, by Bayes’ theorem,

104

56(789:;<:= >?@;@>A:;B9AB>9 |=B9:@9: C )DE

!"(disease * | observed characteristics) = ∑

I 56(G89:;<:= >?@;@>A:;B9AB>9 | =B9:@9: H)DI

,

(1)

105

in which the sum in the denominator is over all possible diseases i (i.e. each of the

106

columns of Table 1, including the column describing the current outbreak). The

107

constants qi are a priori probabilities that the outbreak is due to pathogen i (Nishiura et

108

al., 2012; Ejima et al., 2014). We set uninformative priors for all pathogens considered,

109

so that qi was simply the reciprocal of the number of pathogens being considered

110

(including Disease X) on each date in our analysis. We initially estimated the distance

111

between observed characteristics of the outbreak and each known candidate pathogen

112

using the Hamming distance (i.e., the sum of squares differences between the entries in

113

the columns of Table 1 corresponding to the Disease X and the candidate pathogen).

114

Then, we assumed that the probability that the outbreak is driven by disease j is

115

governed by a negative exponential function
Pr(observed characteristics | disease *) ∝ exp (−OC ),

116
117

(2)

where dj is the calculated Hamming distance.
We also repeated our analysis using an alternative measure of the distance

118
119

between observed characteristics of the outbreak and each known candidate pathogen,

120

namely the Euclidean distance (i.e. the square root of the Hamming distance). In each

121

case, we assumed that the importance of each characteristic had an identical weight in

122

our analysis, so that a simple quantitative assessment could be obtained in a

123

probabilistic manner without the need for subjective judgement.
Combining equations (1) and (2), and assuming that qi is identical over i, we

124
125

126
127

have:
!"(disease * | observed characteristics) =

expP−O* Q
∑H exp(−OR )

The probability that the outbreak is driven by Disease X corresponds to the

128

distance dX = 0, and represents a risk score taking values between the reciprocal of the

129

number of candidate pathogens including Disease X itself and one:

131

Supposing that there are n known pathogens responsible for the atypical

132

pneumonia, the probability of observing Disease X without any information is identical

133

with the probability of observing other listed pathogen (i.e., 1/(1+n)) and as pathogens

134

are ruled out by laboratory testing, the identical probability increases (i.e., 1/11 until 2

135

Jan 2020, 1/7 from 3 Jan 2020 and 1/5 from 5 Jan 2020 in current outbreak). In

136

addition, if the probability of observing Disease X according to equation (3) takes a

137

value close to the probability of observing other candidate pathogens, the overall

138

probability that the outbreak is due to a novel pathogen should be interpreted as being

139

low. A result of significant practical importance, however, is when the probability of

140

observing Disease X is close to one or much larger than the probability corresponding

141

to each previously observed candidate pathogen. In that case, all candidate pathogens

142

are not similar to the causative agent of the ongoing outbreak, and so the outbreak is

143

likely to be due to a novel pathogen.

144

We converted the probability of disease X into the equivalent percentage value

145

(so that, for example, a result of 0.8 in equation (1) is assumed to mean an 80%

146

probability) and refer to the percentage value as the “probability of Disease X”

147

hereafter.

148

RESULTS

149

We show temporal changes in estimates of the probability that the ongoing outbreak is

150

driven by each candidate pathogen in Figure 1. Because the only information on 30

151

December 2019 was that cases displayed symptoms of pneumonia, the distance between

152

ongoing outbreak and known ten diseases was all zero, and thus, all eleven candidate

153

pathogens initially showed an identical probability of 9.1% (i.e., 1/11). Additional

154

characteristics became known the following day (i.e., 31 December 2019), and

155

consequently, the inferred probability that the outbreak was driven by a novel pathogen

156

increased substantially to 58.6% and 36.9% for Hamming and Euclidean distance

157

metrics, respectively. When the exposure characteristic (i.e. exposure at a wet market),

158

that is specific to ongoing outbreak were excluded from the analyses, the probability of

159

observing Disease X given observed characteristics is as high as 48.7% and 32.6% for

160

Hamming and Euclidean distance.

161

Later in the outbreak, adenoviruses, HPAI (H5N1 and H7N9) and other

162

influenza viruses were ruled out on 3 January 2020, leading the probability of Disease X

163

being assessed as 90.7% and 57.2% for Hamming and Euclidean distance metrics, when

164

all factors were considered as characteristic. Excluding the wet market exposure, the

165

probability of Disease X was 78.2% and 50.6% for Hamming and Euclidean distance

166

metrics, respectively. SARS- and MERS-associated coronaviruses were ruled out as the

167

causative agent on 5 January 2020, leading to a very high estimate for the probability

168

that the outbreak is caused by a novel pathogen once all information had been collected.

169

As of 12 January 2020, the probability of Disease X is estimated to be 92.5% and 65.5%

170

using the model considering all the factors, while the model excluding the characteristic

171

of exposure at the wet market indicated that the probability of Disease X is assessed as

172

81.8% and 59.1% for Hamming and Euclidean distance models, respectively

173

DISCUSSION

174

In this analysis, we have shown quantitatively that the ongoing outbreak of

175

pneumonia cases in Wuhan has almost certainly been caused by a novel pathogen. This

176

was demonstrated using a series of clinical, occupational, and behavioral observations

177

extracted from fragmented reports describing the cases as these reports became

178

available in real time (European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020;

179

Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, China, 2020). Although virological

180

investigation is the gold standard for pathogen identification and a novel coronavirus

181

has now been identified from some of the cases, such laboratory-based outcomes can

182

only be obtained after successfully sequencing the novel virus, which can be a lengthy

183

process. It still remains for the microbiological causal link to be established, for instance

184

by ensuring that Koch’s postulates are met (e.g., as seen in a study of Zika virus (Krauer

185

et al., 2017)). In the ongoing outbreak, the provisional identification of a novel

186

coronavirus was performed on 7 January 2020 and announced formally on 9 January

187

2020 (World Health Organization, 2020). We have shown that non-virological

188

information can indicate that the cause of the outbreak is likely to be a novel pathogen,

189

and that this conclusion could have been obtained before virological test results were

190

announced. Disease X was inferred to be very likely on all dates from 31 December

191

2019 onwards—the date on which descriptions of outbreak characteristics began to

192

emerge.

193

When sufficient clinical details of cases (e.g., complete blood cell counts) are

194

available, the number of causative pathogens considered can be limited to a reasonable

195

number. In this instance, atypical pneumonia combined with reduced white blood cell

196

counts and the lack of response to antibiotics indicated that the pathogen was consistent

197

with viral rather than bacterial infection. With such information, collecting non-

198

virological data can lead to a convenient quantification of the probability of Disease X,

199

while awaiting the results of virological tests. We believe that the proposed approach

200

201

can greatly improve the ongoing risk assessment practices across the world.

It is critically important to discuss two issues that the definition of variables in

202

Table 1 has involved. First, a critical underlying assumption is that Table 1 reasonably

203

represents outbreak characteristics of ongoing and previously known outbreaks. The

204

representation does not reflect observation from all confirmed cases nor epidemiological

205

findings from a case control study (e.g. statistically significant risk factor). Rather, zeros

206

and ones in the table were defined in a phenomenological manner. Depending on

207

readers, the defined nominal values can be different from what it was shown in Table 1

208

and ours is only for the exposition using a typical Table 1 that authors came up. Second,

209

as we have shown, there are multiple combinations of characteristic data to be used.

210

Namely, as an exposure to a wet market for known disease outbreaks other than HPAI

211

was not necessarily derived from empirical observation, the fairness of an assumption

212

that the majority of cases of those known disease outbreaks were asked not to have

213

visited a wet market would be a subject for debate.

214

In the past, descriptive outbreak information has been used to produce sensitive

215

outbreak case definitions, and causative agents have been pinpointed without using

216

statistical methods in combination with epidemiological observations. In the present

217

study, we have shown that such assessments can be made quantitatively using a simple

218

statistical model, allowing for comparison of the likelihood of causative agents among

219

all possible candidates. When outbreak characteristics are shared and updated in real-

220

time (Table 1), these data can contribute to narrow down the possible range of causative

221

agents. In the case of the outbreak in Wuhan, our calculation of the probability that each

222

pathogen is the causative agent indicates that virologically excluding the possibility of

223

influenza viruses, adenoviruses and known virulent coronaviruses associated with

224

SARS and MERS on 3 and 5 January 2020 can be regarded as an “unsurprising”

225

finding.

226

As important limitations, the precision and credibility of input data, and the

227

method for calculating the distance between candidate diseases and the observed

228

outbreak, must be refined in the future. First, our proposed approach used very limited

229

data in Table 1 for logical quantification of the probability that each pathogen was the

230

causative agent. However, with more clinical data, the dataset of characteristics could

231

be replaced by continuous frequencies (e.g. the frequencies of cases experience

232

coughing and difficulty in breathing) rather than binary variables, and then the proposed

233

method could even be used for screening suspected cases. Second, with such data it

234

would also be possible to model the likelihood of a pathogen in equation (1) not by

235

arbitrarily measuring the distance but by using classification models using regression or

236

more sophisticated machine learning approaches. Third, the erroneous input of incorrect

237

information may be a challenge in real time analyses, although this did not appear to be

238

an issue during the course of our analysis of the outbreak in Wuhan. However, it must

239

be considered that the veracity of the source of information for such an analysis could

240

have an impact on the resulting probability calculations. Fourth, the estimated

241

probability that an outbreak is driven by a novel pathogen might be slightly over- or

242

underestimated due to limited information about the mode of transmission and small

243

numbers of observed cases. Of note, we believe that without 100% specificity of

244

bacterial pathogens linked to the ongoing outbreak, excluding bacterial pathogens as

245

candidate cannot be ensured, while the chance that the current outbreak is due to

246

bacterial may be less suspected over time with partial clinical evidence. Nevertheless,

247

the large number of characteristics that could be considered for the outbreak in Wuhan

248

suggests that estimation was not beset in this study. Finally, we had to restrict ourselves

249

to assume that the priori probability of all outbreak (^_ ) is identical. However, since the

250

priori probability of observing the outbreak driven by a Disease X is completely

251

unknown, we believe that this assumption can be plausible in this practice.

252

CONCLUSIONS

253

Despite the future improvements to our statistical modelling framework that

254

are required, this short study has demonstrated clearly that the ongoing outbreak of

255

pneumonia cases in Wuhan is consistent with causation by a novel pathogen, “Disease

256

X.” Analyses of the type conducted in this study can greatly support virological and

257

genetic efforts to characterize the causal agent of this and future outbreaks, with the

258

benefit that such analyses can be carried out extremely quickly.

Figure legend

Figure 1. Real-time estimation of the probability that the ongoing pneumonia

320

outbreak is driven by each candidate pathogen, given available information at

321

different timepoints. The probability that the outbreak is due to an unknown pathogen

322

(Disease X) increases as more information becomes available, since the unknown

323

pathogen can be seen to exhibit characteristics dissimilar to those observed in previous

324

outbreaks, and since known pathogens are ruled out by laboratory results. Arrows

325

indicate new information available on each date. Results are shown for different metrics

326

describing the distance between characteristics of the ongoing outbreak and each

327

candidate pathogen, and by knowledge (inclusion or exclusion) of exposure

328

characteristics of Disease X (i.e. Work/visited a wet market), specifically: A. Hamming

329

distance (the sum of squares difference between the entries in the columns of Table 1

330

corresponding to the ongoing outbreak and the candidate pathogen considered) with wet

331

market exposure; B. Euclidean distance (the square root of the Hamming distance) with

332

wet market exposure; C Hamming distance without wet market exposure; D Euclidean

333

distance without wet market exposure. Dashed grey line shows the probability without

334

considering any information except atypical pneumonia (i.e. equal

335

probability=1/(1+number of candidate pathogens)). Note that the probability of some

336

diseases is identical, for example, SARS and Mycoplasma pneumoniae has equal

337

probability from 30 Dec to 4 Jan, and Legionellosis and Chlamydia pneumoniae has

338

equal probability from 30 Dec to 12 Jan (Details in Supplementary material 1).

*Severe acute respiratory syndrome; **Middle East respiratory syndrome; ***Highly pathogenic avian influenza. Zeros represent characteristics that are unlikely

344

for outbreaks for that pathogen, and ones represent characteristics that occur. Dates and characteristics for the ongoing outbreak were obtained from two online

345

information systems [5,6], and information for other pathogens was summarised from the pathogen-specific pages on the WHO and CDC websites.
