Abstract
The mono-carboxypeptidase Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an important "player"
of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). ACE2 is also the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the new
coronavirus that causes COVID-19. It has been hypothesized that following SARS-CoV-2/ACE2
internalization Ang II level would increase in parallel to a decrease of Ang-(1-7) in COVID-19
patients. In this preliminary report, we analyzed the plasma levels of angiotensin peptides in 19
severe COVID-19 patients and 19 non-COVID-19 volunteers, to assess potential outcome
associations. Unexpectedly, a significant increase in circulating Ang-(1-7) and lower Ang II
plasma level were found in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Accordingly, an increased Ang-(17)/ Ang II ratio was observed in COVID-19 suggesting a RAS dysregulation toward an increased
formation of Ang-(1-7) in these patients.

Introduction
The mono-carboxypeptidase Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a major player in the
Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) as it converts the decapeptide Angiotensin I (Ang I) to Ang(1-9), and Angiotensin II (Ang II) to Ang-(1-7) (Figure 1A).1 ACE2 is also a target for the new
human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for the dramatic COVID-19 ongoing
pandemic.2 It has been suggested that following SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 internalization, Ang II
level increases3 in parallel to a decrease of Ang-(1-7) level.4 These changes would be expected
both at tissue and circulatory levels. Considering that Ang-(1-7) has many beneficial effects,
including anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombogenic and anti-fibrotic activities,1 it has been
hypothesized that Ang-(1-7) administration would improve the clinical outcome of COVID-19
patients. Aiming to test this hypothesis, a Phase I/II clinical trials (NCT04633772) has been
initiated with a planned Phase III clinical trial (NCT04332666).

This report aims at answering the key question whether the circulating levels of angiotensin
peptides are indeed altered in COVID-19 patients using LC/MS/MS (Figure 1B). This is
important since that there is no data in the literature on the concentration of circulating
angiotensin using direct measurement of these peptides in COVID-19 patients. Others reported
that Ang II is higher in the plasma of COVID-19 patients, but the authors used an ELISA method
to quantify Ang II.,3 This method has been recently criticized by Chappell et al. due to its poor

specificity for the measurement of Ang II and Ang-(1-7) in human plasma.5 Also, Kintscher et al.
have recently reported the “plasma angiotensin peptide profiling” in COVID-19 patients6 but,
even though they used a mass spectrometry-based strategy, they collect the blood using neither
protease inhibitors nor under denaturation conditions to “quench” the activity of plasma
proteases. Actually, they even incubated the heparinized plasma samples at 37o C to increase
proteases activities and thus measure what they call “peptides’ equilibrium concentrations”. This
method allows only the indirect measurement of RAS peptides as it does not account for the
important role of enzymes on the endothelium, for example, in production or hydrolysis of RAS
peptides in the circulation. Here, we are reporting the direct measurements of the RAS peptides
Ang I, Ang II, Ang-(1-7) and Ang-(1-5) in the arterial blood from 19 COVID-19 patients and 19
non-COVID-19 volunteers.

Methods
The study protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of
Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil (CAAE 34080720.0.1001.5149). Written consents were
obtained from the patients or their relatives for blood sampling. The COVID-19 patients were
recruited in two hospitals (Mater Dei Hospital and Eduardo de Menezes Hospital, Belo
Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil). Arterial blood samples were obtained from patients admitted at
the hospitals’ Intensive Care Unit (ICU) upon admission and before starting the any additional
treatment (medications, oxygen, etc.). The arterial samples from non-COVID-19 subjects were
collected from healthy volunteers (n=6) or before cardiac catheterization (n=13). Importantly,
only the arterial blood samples from patients with no diagnostic for cardiovascular diseases, as
per the catheterization results, were used in the study. Three patients and three non-COVID-19
individuals were previously using ACE inhibitors (ACEi) (Figure 1B) and the treatment was not
interrupted at any time.
A mass spectrometry-based approach was used to quantify the RAS peptides. Inactivation of
plasma proteases and potential SARS-CoV-2 in the blood samples was achieved by mixing 2 mL
of arterial blood sample with 8 mL of a denaturation solution (4M guanidine thiocyanate in 0.5
% TFA). Samples (1,200 µL) were cleaned up using C18 solid-phase extraction (Sep-Pak,
Waters), reconstituted in 60 µL 0.1% formic acid (concentration factor = 20-fold), and analyzed
by LC-MS/MS (Xevo TQ-S, Waters) using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode

(Figure 1C). The calibration curve was obtained using a stock solution containing synthetic
peptides (Bachem, CA) of all RAS peptides used in this study. The applied calibration curve
model (y = ax + b) proved accurate over the concentration range 10 to 1000 pg/mL (r = 0.997).
The limit of quantitation (LOQ), inter- and intra-variability of this method has been previously
reported.7 Data are shown as mean ± SEM and the parametric t test was used for the statistical
analyses.

Results
Arterial concentrations of the angiotensin peptides are shown in Figure 1D. In COVID-19
patients, the arterial concentration of Ang II (6.03 ± 1.18 vs.10.7 ± 1.87 pg/mL; P = 0.0381) and
Ang-(1-5) (3.43 ± 0.75 vs.19.3 ± 5.80 pg/mL; P = 0.0084) were significantly lower than in the
non-COVID-19 volunteers. Surprisingly, the blood levels of Ang-(1-7) were significantly higher
in COVID-19 patients (14.0 ± 2.32 vs. 7.49 ± 1.42 pg/mL; P = 0.0214). No significant difference
was observed for Ang I (31.2 ± 6.23 pg/mL vs. 40.8 ± 9.54 pg/mL; P = 0.3959). ACEi therapy
did not significantly change the observed results, as shown by the calculated values excluding
the data from individuals under ACEi treatment (Figure 1E): Ang I = 34.5 ± 7.07 vs. 45.2 ± 10.8
pg/mL; P = 0.4023; Ang II = 6.00 ± 1.33 vs. 11.2 ± 2.07; P = 0.0407; Ang-(1-7) = 12.9 ± 2.02
vs. 6.47 ± 1.03 pg/mL; P = 0.0080; Ang-(1-5) = 3.75 ± 0.86 vs. 17.5 ± 6.29 pg/mL; P = 0.0330.

Discussion
Although we did not measure the tissular levels of RAS peptides, our findings contrast with the
initial hypothesis that the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 would result in higher Ang II
and lower Ang-(1-7) levels compared to non-COVID-19 subjects.4 Indeed, a recent study using
the equilibrium method8 is in line with our direct data. Previous studies suggested that one of the
main routes to produce Ang-(1-7) in the circulation is ACE2-independent,9, 10 which may also
explain our findings in the blood of COVID-19 patients. Significant decrease of Ang II and
increase of Ang-(1-7) arterial levels were observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients (Figure
1D) and this is probably due to a direct dysregulation of RAS pathways in COVID-19 rather than
a direct consequence of ACEi usage (Figure 1E). The Ang-(1-7)/Ang II ratio, which is an
estimation of Ang II

Ang-(1-7) conversion, was 3-fold higher in cohort of COVID-19 patients

(0.878 ± 0.201 vs. 2.79 ± 0.682; P = 0.0141), which may suggest an increased ACE2 or other

Ang-(1-7) -forming activity in COVID-19. Indeed, an increase in soluble ACE2 in critically ill
COVID-19 patients have been recently reported.11
In contrast to a previous report,3 we observed a significative reduction of Ang II concentration in
COVID-19 patients, which may add more data against the reliability of ELISA to measure Ang
II in human plasma.5 The Ang II/Ang I ratio was not significantly altered in the COVID-19
patients (0.292 ± 0.0517 vs. 0.205 ± 0.0322; P = 0.1518), which may suggest that ACE activity
is potentially not altered in COVID-19. Unfortunately, we were unable to perform enzymatic
activity assays in this study due to the denaturation conditions that we used to collect the
samples.

Finally, with all the limitations of the small cohort included in this study, this is the first report of
the direct measurement of RAS peptides in the circulation of COVID-19 patients. Although
future studies are obviously necessary to better understand the effects of this disease on RAS
pathways, our data provide new insights for the interpretation and planning of future therapies to
modulate the RAS in the context of COVID-19.
