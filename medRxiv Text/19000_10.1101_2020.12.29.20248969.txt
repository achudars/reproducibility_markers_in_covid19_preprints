Abstract
Background: Alongside the COVID-19 pandemic, government authorities around the world have
had to face a growing infodemic capable of causing serious damages to public health and economy.
In this context, the use of infoveillance tools has become a primary necessity.
Objective: The aim of this study is to test the reliability of a widely used infoveillance tool which is
Google Trends. In particular, the paper focuses on the analysis of relative search volumes (RSVs)
quantifying their dependence on the day they are collected.
Methods: RSVs of the query coronavirus + covid during February 1 - December 4, 2020 (period 1),
and February 20 - May 18, 2020 (period 2), were collected daily by Google Trends from December
8 to 27, 2020. The survey covered Italian regions and cities, and countries and cities worldwide. The
search category was set to all categories. Each dataset was analyzed to observe any dependencies of
RSVs from the day they were gathered. To do this, by calling 𝑖 the country, region, or city under
investigation and 𝑗 the day its 𝑅𝑆𝑉 was collected, a Gaussian distribution 𝑋𝑖 = 𝑋(𝜎𝑖 , 𝑥̅𝑖 ) was used to
represent the trend of daily variations of 𝑥𝑖𝑗 = 𝑅𝑆𝑉𝑠𝑖𝑗 . When a missing value was revealed
(anomaly), the affected country, region or city was excluded from the analysis. When the anomalies
exceeded 20% of the sample size, the whole sample was excluded from the statistical analysis.
Pearson and Spearman correlations between RSVs and the number of COVID-19 cases were
calculated day by day thus to highlight any variations related to the day RSVs were collected. Student
t-test was used to assess the statistical significance of the differences between the average RSVs of
the various countries, regions, or cities of a given dataset. Two RSVs were considered statistical
confident when 𝑡 < 1.5. A dataset was deemed unreliable if the confident data exceeded 20%
(confidence threshold). The percentage increase 𝛥 was used to quantify the difference between two
values.
Results: Google Trends has been subject to an acceptable quantity of anomalies only as regards the
RSVs of Italian regions (0% in both period 1 and period 2) and countries worldwide (9.7% during
period 1 and 10.9% during period 2). However, the correlations between RSVs and COVID-19 cases
underwent significant variations even in these two datasets (𝑀𝑎𝑥 |𝛥| = + 625% for Italian regions,
and 𝑀𝑎𝑥 |𝛥| = +175% for countries worldwide). Furthermore, only RSVs of countries worldwide
did not exceed confidence threshold. Finally, the large amount of anomalies registered in Italian and
international cities’ RSVs made these datasets unusable for any kind of statistical inference.
Conclusions: In the considered timespans, Google Trends has proved to be reliable only for surveys
concerning RSVs of countries worldwide. Since RSVs values showed a high dependence on the day
they were gathered, it is essential for future research that the authors collect queries’ data for several
consecutive days and work with their RSVs averages instead of daily RSVs, trying to minimize the

Introduction
During the COVID-19 pandemic, fake news and inaccurate information circulated widely on the web
creating severe issues to public health and economy all over the world [1]. Dr. Tedros Adhanom
Ghebreyesus- director of the World Health Organization (WHO)- claimed that the battle we are
fighting does not only concern the epidemic but also its infodemic [2]. Moreover, the WHO itself has
launched an international campaign called “Managing the COVID-19 infodemic: Promoting healthy
behaviours and mitigating the harm from misinformation and disinformation” to sensitize states to
contrast the spread of misinformation [3]. To date, one of the main problems consists in conspiracy
news relating to alleged vaccine damage, which can seriously compromise the international strategy
for the abatement of SARS-CoV-2 [4]. Therefore, the demand for new effective and efficient
infodemiological methods has never been as pressing as today. In this regard, scientists are
increasingly adopting infoveillance tools to monitoring the infodemic on websites, social media, and
newspapers [5]. In particular, Google Trends- an open online infoveillance tool developed by
GoogleTM - has been widely used by the scientific community not only as for quantifying
disinformation but also to make epidemiological predictions on the spread of infectious diseases,
including COVID-19 [6-9]. This type of study is based on the search for statistical cross-correlations
between users’ web searches related to specific diseases, such as symptoms, drugs, therapies,
vaccines, number of infected people, number of deaths, etc., and the number of disease contagions
and deaths officially registered after a certain timespan. However, not all that glitters is gold: indeed,
Google Trends has some limitations that are often overlooked and which risk heavily biasing and
distorting correlation-based analytics. Furthermore, some anomalies in the calculus of relative search
volumes (RSVs) could also alter any infodemiological analysis in an unpredictable way. In this paper
we will delve into the aforementioned limitations exploring their nature and searching for solutions
to circumventing them, thus allowing the scientific community to continue using this precious tool
through a more reliable approach.

Methods
To assess the reliability of Google Trends (GT), relative search volumes (RSVs) of a specific query
in a fixed period were downloaded on different days as to reveal any dependence on the date they
were collected. In this context, “anomalies” were defined as those countries, regions or cities whose
RSVs appeared only on specific days.

Data collection
RSVs of the query coronavirus + covid were collected from two distinct periods: 20 February - 18
May, 2020 (period 1), and 1 February - 4 December, 2020 (period 2). Period 1, corresponding to the
Italian lockdown, was chosen for GT to provide daily RSVs, while period 2 was chosen for GT to
provide weekly RSVs. The survey was carried out on Italian regions and cities, and worldwide
countries and cities. All RSVs of periods 1 and 2 were collected daily for a minimum of 7 days and
until any anomaly was highlighted; when no anomaly was identified within 15-20 days, the
investigation was considered concluded. The data-collection period ranged from 8 to 25 December,
2020. The Google Trends category search-parameter was set to all categories. All details are shown
in Table 1.

Statistical analysis
By calling 𝑖 the country, region, or city under investigation and 𝑗 the day its 𝑅𝑆𝑉 was collected, a
Gaussian distribution 𝑋𝑖 = 𝑋(𝜎𝑖 , 𝑥̅𝑖 ), where 𝜎𝑖 is the standard deviation (also called 𝑆𝐷) and 𝑥̅𝑖 is the
mean value of 𝑅𝑆𝑉𝑠𝑖𝑗 , was used to represent the trend of 𝑥𝑖𝑗 = 𝑅𝑆𝑉𝑠𝑖𝑗 . To evaluate data normality,
the Shapiro-Wilk test was used [14]. The significance threshold was indicatively set at 𝛼 = .05 [15].
Data distributions that deviated greatly from 𝛼 were marked with an asterisk (*). The impact of daily
variations of 𝑅𝑆𝑉𝑠𝑖𝑗 in 𝑋(𝜎𝑖 , 𝑥̅𝑖 ) on Pearson (R) and Spearman (r) correlations with COVID-19 total
cases was estimated [16]; to do this, it was enough to compute the correlations on different days and
calculate their percentage increases 𝛥 = (𝑢𝑓 − 𝑢0 )/𝑢0 ∗ 100. For the adoption of these correlations,
standard criteria were exploited [17]. The t-test 𝑡 = (𝑥̅𝑙 − 𝑥̅𝑚 )/𝜎̃ [18] was performed in order to
understand if the differences between the averages of 𝑅𝑆𝑉𝑠 of the same sample (i.e. same

geographical area and period) were significant. A difference between two 𝑅𝑆𝑉𝑠 was considered
statistically significant when 𝑡 < 1.5. A dataset was deemed unreliable if the confident data exceeded
20% (confidence threshold) for at least one country, region, or city. When anomalies were identified
in more than 20% of cases, no investigation on the distributions was conducted.

Results
Italian regions’ web interest during period 1 (February – 4 December, 2020)
As shown in Figure 1, there have been strong relationships between RSVs and the dates they were
collected: in fact, the regional ranking of web interest underwent several unpredictable variations
even as regards the peak values 𝑅𝑆𝑉 = 100.

in the query coronavirus+covid during period 1 (1 February – 4 December, 2020). X-axis: dates on which the RSVs were
collected. Y-axis: Google Trends RSV. * = Regions that showed a non-normal trend over time.

The daily standard deviation of the sample ranged in the interval [6.6, 7.6], making all values in the
central band mutually confident. Because of that, any correlations between RSVs and COVID-19
cases (or related statistics) could not be meaningful if merely based on a single-day dataset.
Furthermore, even supposing no variance in daily samples, the correlation between the number of
COVID-19 cases and RSVs went from 𝑟 = .29 on December 8 to 𝑟 = .36 on the following day (|𝛥| =

+24.1%). Considering the whole dataset, the same correlations ranged in the interval
[−.23, −.42] (|𝛥| = +82.6%). The mean value and standard error of the 𝑋𝑖 distributions were 𝑥̅ =
88.4 and ̅̅̅̅̅̅
𝑆𝐸𝑀 = 0.4 respectively, with 𝑆𝐸𝑀𝑖 ranging in the interval [0.1, 0.7]. Therefore, the
confidence threshold was exceeded (e.g. Abruzzo, 37%). However, no anomalies have been found.

Italian regions’ web interest during the period 2 (20 February – 18 May, 2020)
As shown in Figure 2 (next page), the variance of RSVs as a function of the day they were gathered
was lower than that of the previous dataset (𝑥̅ = 91.9, ̅̅̅̅̅̅
𝑆𝐸𝑀 = 0.4, ̅̅̅̅̅̅
𝑆𝐸𝑀𝑖 𝜖 [0.3, 0.5]). This is
probably due not only to the investigated period but also to the different sampling frequency.
However, there was greater variability on RSV peaks and a larger number of non-normal trends.

The confidence threshold was exceeded (e.g. Abruzzo, 47%). Spearman and Pearson correlations
between COVID-19 cases and daily RSVs ranged in the intervals [. 04, .29] (|𝛥| = +625%) and
[. 09, .26] (|𝛥| = +189%) respectively. No anomalies has been found.

Italian cities’ web interest during period 1 and period 2
As shown in Tables 2 and 3 (next two pages), significant anomalies occurred in 33.3% of Italian cities
during period 1 and 45.8% during period 2. In particular, Perugia and Prato- absent respectively 7and 10-times during period 1- recorded 𝑅𝑆𝑉𝑠 = 100 on 6 occasions. During period 2, Messina,
Perugia, Pescara, Prato, and Salerno, recorded only 1 RSV out of 14 samples, while Parma recorded
2 RSVs. Therefore, any type of correlation or other statistical calculus, evaluation, or consideration
on this dataset would be highly dependent on the day the data was gathered.

Global web interest during period 1 (February – 4 December, 2020)
Google Trends reported a maximum of 62 countries’ RSVs (Supplementary Table 1). Significant

unchanged by Italy (𝑆𝐷𝑖 = 0). In 64.5% of cases, data was not normally distributed. No nation

cases ranged in the interval [. 04, .11] (|𝛥| = +175%); however, it must be pointed out that the value
𝑟 = .04 was an outlier (recorded on December 16, 2020) and a more representative interval is
[. 10, .11] (|𝛥| = +10%).

Global web interest during the period 2 (20 February – 18 May, 2020)
Google Trends reported a maximum of 64 countries’ RSVs (Supplementary Table 2). Significant
anomalies occurred in 7 cases (10.9%) and the peak 𝑅𝑆𝑉 = 100 was reached and maintained
unchanged by Italy (𝑆𝐷𝑖 = 0). In 56.2% of cases, data was not normally distributed. No nation
exceeded the confidence threshold even if the dataset showed a high variability range if compared to
that of Italy (𝑥̅ = 44.5, ̅̅̅̅̅̅

[. 04, .06] (|𝛥| = +50%).

International cities’ web interest during period 1 and period 2
As shown in Tables 4 and 5 (next two pages), significant anomalies occurred in 30.4% of international
cities during period 1 and 38.1% during period 2. In particular, Bogotà, Chicago, Dubai, Houston,
Hyderabad, Los Angeles, Sao Paulo, Santiago of Chile were affected by anomalies during period 1
̅̅̅̅̅̅𝑖 = 100) and Rome (𝑅𝑆𝑉 = 100 on December 25,
and period 2, which also included Milan (𝑅𝑆𝑉
2020). Therefore, any type of correlation or other statistical calculus, evaluation, or consideration on
this dataset would be highly dependent on the day the data was gathered.

Discussion
As far as the author knows, this is the first study to assess Google Trends reliability through an iterated
queries analysis. In particular, this paper clearly demonstrates a strong dependence of Google Trends
relative search volumes (RSVs) values on the date they are gathered. The dataset of Italian regions
above all, although if not affected by anomalies, showed how the collection of the same queries’
RSVs (i.e. same category, area and period) on different days is able to substantially modify a
statistical correlation between RSVs themself and an external quantity (in this case, the number of
COVID-19 infections). Moreover, in all the other datasets, an even greater problem was highlighted
such as the presence or absence of specific RSVs depending on the day the sample was gathered. This
phenomenon has also affected cities that have reached peak values on several occasions, such as
Milan and Rome in the global dataset and Perugia and Prato in the Italian dataset. Furthermore, the
fact that Prato and Perugia have reached a peak of web interest in the Italian dataset but not in the
international dataset shows how Google Trends RSV measurement includes only specific
geographical areas according to the search item chosen by the user. Finally, RSVs of Italian regions
and cities as well as RSVs of international cities showed such a daily variance that these areas were
often statistically confident with each other, compromising any search for correlations or any other
rank-based grouping. The most reliable dataset- i.e. a sample that showed an acceptable number of
anomalies and whose data did not exceed the confidence threshold - was that of countries worldwide
both during period 1 and period 2. However, even in this case there were outliers capable of
destroying the correlation between RSVs and COVID-19 cases. Alongside the limitations highlighted
in this paper, Cervellin et al. pointed out that web queries can be influenced by main media, further
reducing the credibility of this research tool [19]. Nuti et al. have previously found that a large
multitude of papers lack the information needed to make them fully reproducible [20]. Nevertheless,
Google Trends has served and still serves as an excellent tool for infoveillance and infodemiology:
in fact, even admitting that newspapers and newscasts can influence the trends of web queries, it
provides a way to quantify the web interest in a specific topic more efficiently than any other methods
historically used (e.g. population surveys) [21-24]. Moreover, it can be used as a complement to a
traditional analysis [25]. In conclusion, Google Trends represents a great source of information for
the entire scientific community. Nonetheless, more details should be provided by Google on how
RSVs are presented to users. Finally, to ensure full reliability of a Google Trends dataset, it is essential
for future research that authors collect queries’ data for several consecutive days and work with their
RSVs averages instead of daily RSVs, trying to minimize the standard errors until an established
confidence threshold is respected.
