Abstract
Objectives To assess whether gout and / or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are risk factors for
coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) diagnosis. To assess whether gout and / or RA are risk
factors for death from COVID-19.
Methods We used data from the UK Biobank. Multivariate-adjusted logistic regression was
employed in the following analyses. Analysis A: to test for association between gout or RA
and COVID-19 diagnosis in a population-based cohort (n=473,139). Analysis B: to test for
association between gout or RA and death from COVID-19 in a case-control cohort of people
who died or survived with COVID-19 (n=2,073). Analysis C: to test for association with gout
or RA and death from COVID-19 in a population-based cohort (n=473,139)
Results Neither RA nor gout associated with COVID-19 diagnosis in analysis A, nor did RA
or gout associate with risk of death in the COVID-19-diagnosed group in analysis B.
However RA associated with risk of death from COVID-19 using the population-based
cohort in analysis C independent of comorbidities and other measured risk factors (OR=1.8
[95% CI 1.2 ; 2.7]). Gout was not associated with death from COVID-19 in the same
population-based analysis (OR=1.2 [95% CI 0.9 ; 1.7]).
Conclusions RA and gout are not risk factors for COVID-19-diagnosis. However RA, but
not gout, is a risk factor for death from COVID-19 in a population-based analysis using the
UK Biobank. These findings require replication in larger data sets that also allow inclusion of
a wider range of factors.

Key messages

What is already known?
Information on the risk of death from COVID-19 for people with gout and rheumatoid
arthritis is scarce.

What does this study add?
In a population-based analysis there is an increased risk of death by COVID-19 for people
with rheumatoid arthritis independent of co-morbidities, but not gout.

The findings need to be replicated in other datasets where the influence of therapies for RA
can be tested.

How might this impact on clinical practice?
Improved clinical management and treatment for RA patients with COVID-19.

Background
Data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes for people with the two most
common inflammatory arthropathies, gout and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are scarce. An
international registry study of 600 people with rheumatic diseases did not report any data on
association of gout with hospitalisation, owing to the small number of people with gout
included (1). In the same study, people with RA did not have a different risk of
hospitalisation compared to other rheumatic diseases (1). In the OpenSAFELY study (2) that
compared risk factors for 10,926 people who died from COVID-19 to the general population
in the UK, RA was pooled with systemic lupus erythematosus and psoriasis, this combined
group had a hazard ratio of 1.2 [95% CI: 1.1;1.3] for death. Gout was not examined in the
OpenSAFELY study. In a US study comparing people with COVID-19 with systemic
autoimmune rheumatic diseases, of whom 45% had RA, to people without these diseases
there was increased risk of hospitalisation and admission to intensive care but not death (3).
A Spanish study reported no evidence for association of chronic inflammatory arthritis (48%
with RA) with poor outcome in COVID-19 (4).

Gout is caused by an exuberant auto-inflammatory interleukin-1β-driven innate immune
system response to monosodium urate crystals present in joints (5). Theoretically this has the
potential to lead to an increased immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Poorer COVID-19 outcomes have been associated with high
serum levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α (6), raising the possibility that people with gout might
be at risk of a poor outcome due to the fact that they also have higher circulating levels of
these factors (7). Gout is also strongly associated with cardiometabolic co-morbidities such as
type 2 diabetes, kidney disease and heart disease (8), all established risk factors for COVID19-related mortality (2). Gout medications may also influence outcomes following the
development of COVID-19: two randomised control trials of colchicine, which is widely
used as prophylaxis and treatment for the gout flare (9), reported better clinical outcomes
including a shorter time in hospital and shorter duration requiring supplemental oxygen in
people hospitalised with COVID-19 in those randomised to colchicine (10,11). There is also
non-randomised evidence of the efficacy of colchicine in COVID-19 in a small case-control
study (12).

Rheumatoid arthritis is a T-cell and B-cell mediated autoimmune disease that primarily
affects the joints but also includes systemic manifestations. Like gout, RA is an independent
risk factor for cardiovascular disease (13). The profile of RA includes increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 (14), a similar profile to COVID-19 (15), with the
potential to lead to an increased immune response to infection by SARS-CoV-2.

The aim of this study was to determine if gout and RA are risk factors for COVID-19
diagnosis or death from COVID-19.

Participants and methods
Data availability
This research was conducted using the UK Biobank Resource (approval number 12611).
SARS-CoV-2 test information, ICD-10 hospital codes, death records and general practice
prescription information was obtained via the UK Biobank data portal on the 16th of
September 2020. This information covered hospital diagnoses between 1991 and 30th June
2020, SARS-CoV-2 tests between 16th March and 24th August 2020, and death records up
until 14th August 2020.

Gout, RA and COVID-19 definitions and case-control datasets
The criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis was defined as participants with 1. a positive SARSCoV-2 test and / or 2. ICD-10 code for confirmed COVID-19 (U07.1) or probable COVID19 (U07.2) in hospital records, or death records (Figure 1). This definition resulted in
identification of 2,118 individuals who were further divided into those that died (n=457)
based on death records and those that were known to survive (n = 1,616). Forty-five
participants who were diagnosed after the last recorded death were removed from this cohort
used in Analysis B (below). Gout was ascertained by a previously validated gout definition
using the following criteria: self-reported gout (visits 0-2); taking allopurinol or
sulphinpyrazone therapy either by self-report or from linked general practice scripts
(excluding those who also had hospital diagnosed lymphoma or leukemia ICD10 C81 - C96);
or hospital-diagnosed gout (ICD-10 code M10) (16). The gout case-control cohort (n =
473,139) consists of 13,105 cases (gout) and 460,034 controls (non-gout). RA affection was
ascertained using the ICD-10 code M05 - M06. The RA cohort (n = 473,139) consists of
7,850 people with and 465,289 people without RA. For the RA and gout cohorts we have
developed three case-control datasets to test for association with the following outcomes:

Dataset A (Analysis A) to test for association with COVID-19 diagnosis in a populationbased cohort. There were 2,118 cases and 471,021 controls.

Dataset B (Analysis B) to test for association with death from COVID-19 in people with
COVID-19. There were 457 people diagnosed with COVID-19 who died and 1,616 people
diagnosed with COVID-19 who survived.

Dataset C (Analysis C) to test for association with death from COVID-19 in a populationbased cohort. There were 457 people diagnosed with COVID-19 who died and 472,682
others that included 1,616 people diagnosed with COVID-19 not known to have died.

Ethnicity, age and comorbidity data
Self-reported ethnicity was grouped into White British (British, Irish, White, Any other white
background), Black British (African, White and Black African, Black or Black British,
Caribbean, White and Black Caribbean, Any other Black background), Asian British (Asian
or Asian British, Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, White and Asian, Any other Asian
background), and Other (Other ethnic group, Mixed, Any other mixed background, Do not
know, Prefer not to answer). Age was calculated for 2020 from year of birth. The ICD-10
hospital codes used to determine additional comorbidity status were: C00 – C96 (cancer),
D80 - D89 (immunodeficiencies), E08 - E13 (diabetes mellitus), E78 (disorders of
lipoprotein metabolism and other lipidemias), F01-F03 (dementia), I10 - I15 (hypertensive
diseases), I60 - I69 (cerebrovascular diseases), I20 - I25 (ischemic heart diseases), I26 - I28
(pulmonary heart disease), I50 (heart failure), J44 (chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases),
J45 (asthma), M19.9 (osteoarthritis) and N18 (chronic kidney disease).

Statistical analysis
All association analyses were done using R v4.0.2 in RStudio 1.2.5019. Two models were
used: adjustment with age, sex, ethnicity, Townsend deprivation index, BMI, smoking status
(Model 1); and Model 1 plus adjustment by the 15 other co-morbidities evaluated (Model 2).
A P < 0.05 threshold indicated nominal evidence for association.

Results
Associations with diagnosis of COVID-19
Results from the association analyses of 16 diseases (including gout and RA) with COVID19 diagnosis (Analysis A) using Model 1 (adjustment by current age, sex, Townsend
deprivation index, ethnicity groups, body mass index and smoking status) are presented in
Table 2. Both gout and RA associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis of 1.5fold [95% CI: 1.3 ; 1.8] and 2.0-fold [1.6 ; 2.5], respectively. In comparison, data for
cerebrovascular diseases were (OR 4.9 [4.3 ; 5.5]), heart failure (OR 4.2 [3.6 ; 4.8]), chronic
kidney disease (OR 3.9 [3.4 ; 4.5]), pulmonary heart disease (OR 3.5 [2.9 ; 4.2]),
immunodeficiencies (OR 3.2 [2.2 ; 4.7]) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders (OR
3.2 [2.7 ; 3.7]). Two to three-fold increases in risk were estimated for hypertensive diseases
(OR 2.4 [2.2 ; 2.7]), diabetes mellitus (OR 2.4 [2.1 ; 2.7]), and lipoprotein disorders (OR 2.1
[1.9 ; 2.4]). One to two-fold increases in risk were estimated for ischemic heart diseases (OR
2.0 [1.8 ; 2.2]), cancer (OR 1.7 [1.6 ; 1.9]), asthma (OR 1.6 [1.4 ; 1.8]), osteoarthritis (OR 1.6
[1.4 ; 1.7]) and dementia strongly associated with COVID-19 (OR 20.0 [17.1 ; 23.5]). After
adjustment by Model 1 variates and the additional 15 co-morbidities evaluated (Model 2),
gout no longer associated with COVID-19 diagnosis, nor did RA, ischemic heart disease,
asthma and osteoarthritis (Table 3). Age was associated with decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2
infection and / or COVID-19 diagnosis (OR = 0.98 [0.97 ; 0.98] (Table 3). This decreased
risk may reflect a number of factors that influence exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in this age
group, including public health messaging around limiting exposure for older people.

Associations with death upon diagnosis of COVID-19
When testing for association with death from COVID-19 within the cohort with COVID-19
diagnosis (Analysis B), there was no evidence for association with any disease in either of
Models 1 or 2 (Tables 2 and 3) with the exception of immunodeficiencies OR=3.4 [1.5 ; 7.8]
(Model 1) and OR=3.7 [1.6 ; 8.4] (Model 2). Established risk factors for death from COVID19, namely male sex and older age, were strongly associated with death (OR=1.5 [1.1 ; 1.9]
for males and OR=1.1 [1.1 ; 1.2] per additional year of age) (Table 3).

We then tested for association with death from COVID-19 comparing to the entire
population-based cohort (Analysis C). Gout was associated with a 1.7-fold increase [95% CI:
1.2 ; 2.3] in COVID-19-related death under Model 1 but not in Model 2 (OR=1.2 [0.9 ; 1.7]).
In contrast, RA associated with increased risk of death from COVID-19 in both models –

OR=2.9 [1.9 ; 4.2] in Model 1 and OR=1.8 [1.2 ; 2.7] in Model 2. Sex-specific analyses for
death from COVID-19 related death in RA were OR=2.5 [1.4 ; 4.4] for males and OR=3.1
[1.9 ; 5.3] for females in Model 1, and OR=1.6 [0.9 ; 2.9] and OR=1.9 [1.1 ; 3.3],
respectively, in Model 2. None of the sex-specific analyses in gout associated with risk of
death in Analysis C.

We also assessed in Analysis C the 14 additional diseases for association with death from
COVID-19 comparing to the entire population-based cohort. Dementia, immunodeficiencies,
chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, heart failure, pulmonary
heart disease, chronic kidney disease, hypertensive diseases, diabetes mellitus, and cancer all
associated with additional risk of death in Model 2 (Table 3), with dementia and
immunodeficiencies having the strongest effects (OR=9.9 [7.5 ; 13.2] and 4.5 [2.6 ; 8.0],
respectively). In Model 2, people of Black British ancestry had the highest risk of death
(OR=2.8 [1.8 ; 4.5]), compared to people of White British ancestry, and there was positive
association of death with BMI (OR = 1.03 [1.01 ; 1.05]), and the Townsend deprivation index
(OR=1.07 [1.04 ; 1.10]), consistent with a higher prevalence of seroprevalence of SARSCov-2 infection in people living in more deprived areas in the UK (17). Ex-smokers were at
an increased risk of death from COVID-19 in model 2 (OR=1.7 [1.3 ; 2.4]), consistent with
the OpenSAFELY data from the UK (2), although directionality of association was different
to the OpenSAFELY data for current smokers (OR=1.3 [1.0 ; 1.6]). Age was also associated
with death (OR = 1.10 [1.08 ; 1.12]) in this comparison.

Discussion
We identified RA, but not gout, as a risk factor for death from COVID-19 in a multivariate
adjusted population-based analysis. A parallel can be drawn with the increased risk of death
from COVID-19 we observed in immunodeficiencies, in that suppression of the immune
system in RA using immunosuppressive disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs may affect
the same pathway(s) contributing to death from COVID-19. Of relevance is the implication
of a type 1 interferon-mediated immune response in people who die from COVID-19 (18),
including in people with mutations in regulatory genes (19) given mplication of the type 1
interferon response in therapy of RA with biologics (20).

There are limitations to our analyses. Firstly, these analyses pertain to the population from
which the UK Biobank was derived, predominantly the white European middle-aged ethnic
group of the United Kingdom, and are not necessarily generalisable to other ethnic groups or
other white European ethnic groups. There is also no available information on recovery status
so there is the possibility of additional unidentified deaths in the COVID-19 diagnosed group
in Analysis B. In addition to this COVID-19 outcomes will have been influenced over the
time period of this study (March-August 2020) as clinical treatments evolved. General
practice prescriptions were only available up until August 2019 and could not reliably be
used to determine current medication usage. Thus the effect of anti-rheumatic treatments,
particularly biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, could not be assessed in this
study. Limited testing outside of the hospital settings means that the full extent of SARSCoV-2 infection is not known in this population thus it is not possible to accurately compare
asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 to those with more severe disease. The UK Biobank
dataset is also limited to those aged age 49 years to 86 years of age as of 2020, a
demographic with a higher infection fatality ratio (21). This undoubtedly will have
contributed to the inflated infection fatality ratio in the UK Biobank cohort of 22%, well
above general population estimates of 0.5 to 1.5% (e.g. (22)). Therefore our findings cannot
be generalised to those under 50 years of age. Finally, there is the potential in Analysis B for
index event (collider) bias resulting from conditioning the sample set on COVID-19
diagnosis which would serve to bias towards the null (23). However this limitation was
addressed using the population-based approach in Analysis C.

It is important that the findings presented here are replicated in larger administrative datasets
(eg. US-based National COVID Cohort Collaborative (www.ncats.nih.gov/n3c) and the UK

OpenSAFELY cohort (2)). These datasets would allow for more stratification and use of
additional models to fully explore factors including medications that might influence the
observed association with RA. For example, the OpenSAFELY study included 962
individuals who died with COVID-19 who also had RA or SLE or psoriasis (2) – the number
of people with RA in this group is likely to be at least 10-fold greater than in UK Biobank
data set used here. If our association were replicated, investigation of the reasons for the
relationship between RA and death from COVID-19 would improve understanding and
potentially improve clinical management of COVID-19. It will also be important to test for
association with death from COVID-19 of RA alone, i.e. not with other autoimmunities with
rheumatological sequelae, as was done in the OpenSAFELY cohort (2).

In summary, we found evidence for an effect of RA on the risk of a COVID-19 related death
independent of comorbidities and known risk factors. We found an increased risk of death
from RA, and this needs to be further explored in large datasets where a range of other
factors can be investigated (e.g. RA therapies).
