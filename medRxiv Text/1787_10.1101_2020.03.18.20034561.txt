Abstract
Background
The dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmissibility after symptom
onset remains unknown.

Methods
We conducted a prospective case-ascertained study on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
cases and their contacts. Secondary clinical attack rate (considering symptomatic cases
only) was analyzed for different exposure windows after symptom onset of index cases
and for different exposure settings.

Results
Thirty-two confirmed patients were enrolled and 12 paired data (index-secondary cases)
were identified among the 1,043 contacts. The secondary clinical attack rate was 0.9%
(95% CI 0.5–1.7%). The attack rate was higher among those whose exposure to index
cases started within five days of symptom onset (2.4%, 95% CI 1.1–4.5%) than those
who were exposed later (zero case from 605 close contacts, 95% CI 0–0.61%). The attack
rate was also higher among household contacts (13.6%, 95% CI 4.7–29.5%) and nonhousehold family contacts (8.5%, 95% CI 2.4–20.3%) than that in healthcare or other
settings. The higher secondary clinical attack rate for contacts near symptom onset
remained when the analysis was restricted to household and family contacts. There was a
trend of increasing attack rate with the age of contacts (p for trend < 0.001).

Conclusions
High transmissibility of COVID-19 near symptom onset suggests that finding and
isolating symptomatic patients alone may not suffice to contain the epidemic, and more
generalized social distancing measures are required. Rapid reduction of transmissibility
over time implies that prolonged hospitalization of mild cases might not be necessary in
large epidemics.

Main text
Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak originated from Wuhan has spread
to more than 100 countries only two months after the virus, Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in January 2020.1,2 Following
the Wuhan lockdown and other extreme social distancing measures conducted by the
Chinese government, several countries with massive outbreaks also implemented similar
measures, including shutting down the entire cities or communities, banning international
or domestic travel, conducting border control with symptom screening, and implementing
isolation and quarantine to slow down the epidemic.

However, for a novel pathogen like SARS-CoV-2, its unknown epidemiologic
characteristics and transmission dynamics complicated the development and evaluation
of effective control policies.3 Researches on COVID-19 have sprouted with growing
epidemics in different countries and provided some valuable insights. The short
transmission cycle (serial interval) of COVID-19 and results from viral shedding studies
suggested the possibility of transmission near or even before symptom onset, while
prolonged viral shedding raised concerns about prolonged infectiousness and the need for
extended hospital stay.4-6 A few preliminary contact-tracing studies showed that the highrisk exposure setting of COVID-19 transmission was in the household.7-9 Nevertheless,
these fragmented knowledges were still inadequate to answer some practical questions
like, when and how long we should isolate a COVID-19 patient or quarantine close
contacts. To connect these insights and reveal the full picture of COVID-19 transmission,
evidence from the field is urgently needed to provide information about the transmission
risk at different time points after symptom onset and at different exposure settings.
Taiwan’s first COVID-19 case was confirmed on January 21.10 With proactive
containment efforts and comprehensive contact tracing, the number of COVID-19 cases
in Taiwan was maintained low compared to other countries overwhelmed by massive
outbreaks.11 Using the contact tracing data in Taiwan, we aimed to delineate the

transmission dynamics of COVID-19, evaluate the infection risk at different exposure
windows, and estimate the infectious period.

Methods
Study population
In response to the outbreak in Wuhan, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan
CDC) made COVID-19 as a notifiable disease on January 15, 2020. A prospective caseascertained study enrolling all confirmed cases and their close contacts was conducted
between January 15 and February 26.

Ascertainment of cases
A confirmed case should meet the criteria of notification for COVID-19 in Taiwan and be
tested positive by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
test.12 Detailed information including demographic and clinical data was reported to the
National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System.13 The investigation team determined
the clinical severity of the confirmed patients following the World Health Organization
(WHO) interim guidance.14

Contact tracing for COVID-19
When the patient was laboratory-confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, a thorough
epidemiological investigation including contact tracing was implemented by the outbreak
investigation team of Taiwan CDC and local health authorities. The definition of a close
contact was a person who did not wear appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE)
while having face-to-face contact with a confirmed case for more than 15 minutes after
symptom onset. A contact was listed as a household contact if he/she lived in the same
household with the index case, while those listed as family contacts were family members
not living in the same household. For health care settings, close contact was defined by
contacting an index case within two meters without appropriate PPE. Medical staff,
hospital workers, and other patients in the same setting were included.

All close contacts were quarantined at home for 14 days after their last exposure to the
index case. During the quarantine period, any relevant symptoms (fever, cough, or other
respiratory symptoms) of close contacts would trigger RT-PCR testing for COVID-19.
For high-risk populations, including household and hospital contacts, RT-PCR was
performed regardless of symptoms. In Taiwan CDC, we used an electronic tracing system
(Infectious Disease Contact Tracing Platform and Management System) to follow and
record the daily health status of those quarantined contacts. The information collected
included age, gender, the index case, date of exposure, and the exposure setting.

Data processing and analysis
Paired data of index case and close contacts were extracted from the contact tracing
database and outbreak investigation reports. For a family cluster, the index case was
determined based on the temporality of symptom onset and review of the epidemiological
link. A secondary case was excluded from the paired data if the date of onset was earlier
than the date of exposure. Similarly, a close contact would be excluded if the date of last
exposure was earlier than the date of symptom onset of the index case. For health care
contacts, the date of exposure would be the date of admission if the exact date of
exposure was not recorded.

Incubation period and serial interval were estimated using the contact tracing data and
publicly available datasets (Supplement Appendix). We used the Bayesian hierarchical
model to increase the stability in small-sample estimation. The exposure window period
was defined as the time period from the first contact after symptom onset of the index
case to the end of contact. For household contacts who lived with the index case, the day
of first contact was set to be the day of symptom onset of the index case. Secondary
clinical attack rate was calculated by dividing the number of symptom confirmed cases
by the number of close contacts. We analyzed the dynamic change of secondary clinical
attack rate after symptom onset in several ways. First, we categorized contacts based on
the time of the initial exposure to the index case after index case’s symptom onset (days
0–3, 4–5, 6–7, 8–9, or >9). Second, we considered the whole exposure window period
and fitted logistic regression models to estimate the piecewise period-specific odds ratio

under different definitions of exposure (binary exposure or cumulative person-time
exposure in each categorical period). Third, we estimated the density function of
transmission at different timing of exposure since symptom onset, considering the whole
exposure window period and assuming a gamma distribution of the density function (See
Supplementary appendix for details of the statistical analysis).

The data management and analysis were done using R software (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing) and RStan (Stan Development Team).

Results
By February 26, there were 32 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, including five
household/family clusters and four asymptomatic patients. Sixteen (50%) patients were
imported, and the remaining 16 cases were locally acquired. Of the 16 locally-acquired
cases, three patients without any travel history were detected because of pneumonia of
unknown etiology. The remaining 13 cases were secondary cases found through contact
tracing. One of the 13 cases was excluded from subsequent transmission pair analysis
because the documented day of exposure occurred after symptom onset of the secondary
case. The median delay from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis was 5 days (range
0–12) among imported cases and 18.5 days (range 2–28) among locally-acquired cases
(Figure 1A). All secondary cases had their first day of exposure within five days of the
index case’s symptom onset (Figure 1B). The presumed transmission trees were depicted
in Figure 1C. We estimated that the mean incubation period was 4.9 days (95% credible
interval [CrI] 2.7–8.4), and the mean serial interval was 7.0 days (95% CrI 3.7–13.2).

A total of 1,043 close contacts were identified. Among them, 3.4% were household
contacts, 4.5% were non-household family contacts, and 28.9% were health care contacts
(Table 1). The risk for COVID-19 infection (considering 12 transmitted cases) in the
contacts was 1.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6–2.0%), and the secondary clinical
attack rate was 0.9% (95% CI 0.4–1.6%) among all contacts. The clinical attack rate was
higher among those whose initial exposure to the index case was within five days of
symptom onset (2.4%, 95% CI 1.1–4.5%) than those who were exposed later (zero

transmission out of 605 contacts, 95% CI 0–0.61%) (Table 2 and Figure 2A). The attack
rate from early exposure remained high when we restricted the analysis to household and
non-household family contacts (Table 3 and Figure 2B). Further analyses that accounted
for the whole exposure window period also revealed higher transmissibility near
symptom onset (Figure 2C–2D).

The secondary clinical attack rate was 13.6% (95% CI 4.7–29.5%) among household
contacts and 8.5% (95% CI 2.4–20.3%) in non-household family contacts (Table 2). No
nosocomial infection was observed in this study. There was a trend of increasing
secondary clinical attack rate with the age of contacts, ranging from 0% (95% CI 0–
5.1%) in those aged less than 20 years to 3.6% (95% CI 0.8–10.3%) in those aged 60
years and above (p for linear trend: <0.001). Close contacts of confirmed cases presented
with mild illness were not at a lower risk compared to the contacts of more severe cases.
The secondary attack rate among contacts of locally-acquired cases was higher than that
among contacts of imported cases (Table 2).

Discussion
This study is one of the very few initial reports of the secondary clinical attack rate
among close contacts to confirmed COVID-19 cases. Our analysis revealed the early
transmission dynamics with relatively short infectious period of COVID-19: a higher
transmission risk around the time of symptom onset of the index case, followed by a
lower transmission risk at the later stage of disease. The observed decreasing
transmission risk over time for COVID-19 was in striking contrast to the transmission
pattern of SARS, in which the transmission risk remained low until after day 5 of
symptom onset in the index cases.15

Our finding might explain the substantially shorter transmission cycle (serial interval) of
COVID-19 than that of SARS. Following Nishiura et al,4 we updated the information on
transmission pairs from published reports and included 48 pairs. The updated serial
interval had a mean of 5.4 days (95% CrI 4.1–7.2 days) (Supplementary Appendix). In
contrast, the mean serial interval of SARS was estimated to be 8.4 days in Singapore.15

Our analysis suggested that the shorter serial interval of COVID-19 was due to the
combination of early-stage transmission and a short period of infectiousness.

The observed pattern of secondary clinical attack rate over time was also consistent with
the quantitative data of the SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding in upper respiratory specimens,
which reported a high viral load around the time of symptom onset, followed by a gradual
decrease in viral shedding to a low level after 10 days.5 The viral load was similar among
asymptomatic, minimally symptomatic, and symptomatic patients. Another virological
study in COVID-19 patients also found no viable isolates of the virus after the first week
of symptoms. Our data agreed with the virological data on high transmissibility in the
first week and much decreased risk afterwards.16

To summarize the evidence, the decreasing risk for secondary infection over time in our
study, the observed short serial interval, and the trend of decreasing viral shedding and
viability after symptom onset strongly suggested high transmissibility of the disease near
or even before the day of symptom onset. Since the onset of overt clinical symptoms such
as fever, dyspnea, and signs of pneumonia usually occurred 5–7 days after initial
symptom onset, the infection might well have been transmitted onward at the time of
detection.17,18 This characteristic makes the containment efforts challenging. In a
modeling study, Hellewell et al. found that the possibility of controlling COVID-19
through isolation and contact tracing decreased with increasing proportion of
transmission that occurred before symptom onset.19 This simulation combined with our
findings might explain the difficult situation in Wuhan, South Korea, Iran, and Italy.
Aggressive social distancing and proactive contact tracing might be necessary to block
the transmission chain of COVID-19 and to keep presumptive patients away from
susceptible populations with a high risk for severe disease.

The observed short duration of infectiousness with lower risk of transmission one week
after symptom onset had critical implications on redirecting the control efforts of
COVID-19. Given the non-specific and mostly mild symptoms of COVID-19 at
presentation, patients are often identified and hospitalized at the later stage of disease

when the transmissibility has started to decrease. In this case, hospitalization would not
be helpful for isolation and reducing transmission, and should be spared for severe
patients. When the number of confirmed cases increases rapidly, home care for patients
with mild illness should be considered.20 In Taiwan, the most prolonged duration of
hospital isolation for the 32 confirmed cases was more than one month. If every patient
with mild illness is to be isolated in the hospital or other isolation institutes for such a
prolonged period, the healthcare system will soon be overwhelmed during a large
epidemic. In this case, an unusually high case fatality rate such as that observed in
Wuhan may occur.21,22 Similarly, better understanding of the potential duration of
transmission could help direct containment strategies. For example, the efforts of
contacting tracing could focus on the contacts near or even before symptom onset of the
index cases when the number of index cases or contacts is too large to afford. To fight a
potential pandemic like COVID-19, improved efficiency for resource allocation will be
critical since a massive outbreak will rapidly consume public health and medical
resources.

Several patients in our study had pneumonia with unknown etiology and had multiple
contacts in the healthcare setting before being diagnosed, but none of these healthcare
contacts resulted in nosocomial transmission. Besides the basic PPE used by medical
staffs, this result might be due to their late admissions and lower transmissibility by the
time of hospitalization as well. This pattern is compatible with the observation in China
and Hong Kong. In China, the number of nosocomial infections might be lower than that
reported because some healthcare workers acquired infections in their households rather
than in the healthcare setting;9 In Hong Kong, most hospitalization was also delayed to at
least 5 days after disease onset.23 In closed settings like hospital or cruise ship,24,25 fomite
transmission might play an important role, amplifying the risk of transmission and
making the temporality of transmission less identifiable.25-27 Better understandings of the
dynamic change of transmissibility over time and of the transmission route of infected
health care workers could further reduce the unnecessary infection control measures and
over-equipped PPEs, and thus reduce healthcare workers’ workloads during large
outbreaks.

Our study has limitations. First, we did not completely examine contacts before the
symptom onset of the index cases. Therefore, we might have underestimated the
importance of early transmission. In other words, the actual importance of early
transmission could be higher than our estimates. Our findings agree with the
recommendation from WHO on using four days before symptom onset as the starting
date for contact tracing.28 This modification might further reveal the pattern of early
transmission in COVID-19. Second, we could not completely separate out the effect of
close household contact and early contact given the strong correlation of the two. The
increased transmissibility in the early stage of COVID-19 may be partially attributed to
the effect of household and non-household family contacts rather than increased
infectiousness at the early stage. But the pattern of early transmission remained when we
stratified by type of exposure.

In summary, our analysis suggested that the majority of transmission of COVID-19
occurred at the very early stage of the disease, and the secondary clinical attack rate
among contacts decreased over the time line of symptom development. The pattern of
high transmissibility near symptom onset and possible short infectious period may
drastically change the thinking of control strategies for COVID-19. More studies are
urged to elucidate the transmission dynamics of this novel disease clearly.

Figure 1. Epidemiology of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Taiwan. (A) Distribution
of the interval between symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 among
28 cases (excluding four asymptomatic cases). (B) Exposure window period of the 12
locally transmitted cases, defined as the time period from the first day of exposure
after symptom onset of the index case to the last day of exposure. (C) Transmission
tree of 12 locally transmitted pairs.

Figure 2. Number of close contacts and secondary symptomatic cases, and
secondary clinical attack rate by the time from symptom onset of index cases to the
date of first exposure (A) among all contacts and (B) household and family contacts.
(C) Odds ratio (log scale) of secondary disease by the different exposure period after
symptom onset; the exposure dose was defined by the indicator approach (green)
and the person-time approach (orange). (D) Estimated density function of
transmission over the exposure period after symptom onset. See Supplementary
Appendix for details.
