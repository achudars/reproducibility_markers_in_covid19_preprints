Abstract

Background Corona virus disease (covid-19) is an emerging highly infectious disease
caused by novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2). Several public health and social
protective measures that may prevent or slow down the transmission of the COVID-19
were introduced. However, these measures are unfortunately neglected or deliberately
ignored by some individuals.
Objective To identify the factors influencing intention to adhere to precautionary
measures againstCOVID-19 in Sudan.

Methods and Design Cross sectional online based survey using virtual convenience
sampling technique.

Variables Measured Perceived threat of corona virus (perceived severity and perceived
susceptibility), perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy and intention to
adhere to precautionary behavior towards COVID-19

Results The significant predictors of intention to adhere to the precautionary behavior
against COVID-19 were: gender (β =3.34, P <0.001), self-efficacy (β= 0.476, P<0.001),
perceived benefits (β= 0.349, P<0.001) and perceived severity (β= 0.113, P=0.005).
These factors explained 43% of the variance in participants’ intention to adhere to the
protective measures. Participants who were female, confident in their ability to adhere
to the protective measures when available, believing in the benefits of the protective
measures against COVID-19 and perceiving that the disease could have serious
consequences were more likely to be willing to adhere to the protective measures.

Introduction
Corona virus disease (COVID-19) is an emerging highly infectious disease caused by
the novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2)(1). The virus was first detected in Wuhan,
China(2) on December 2019. In the last two decades Corona viruses have caused two
large-scale pandemics; SARS(3) and MERS(4).Several public health and social
measures that may prevent or slow down the transmission of COVID-19 were
introduced; including case isolation, identification and follow-up of contacts, adequate
environmental disinfection, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE)(5).By 27
August, 2020 the virus has reached 214 countries resulted in 24.2 million cases and
826000 confirmed deaths.
At this time, there is no approved vaccine preventing corona virus disease. The best
prevention is to avoid exposure to the virus(6). In response to this Pandemic, Almost all
countries imposed lockdown policy to slow the spread of the virus and introduced
measures that may reduce the risk of exposure these include: use of face masks; regular
hand washing with soap or disinfection with hand sanitizer; avoidance of contact with
infected people and complying with social distancing measures in crowded places; and
avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands(7)(8). However, these
guidelines, which were introduced to slow the spread of COVID-19 and contribute to

public well-being, are unfortunately neglected or deliberately ignored by some
individuals(9).
Health Belief Model(10) was originally formulated to explain different preventive
health behaviors. According to this model, the individual's health behavior depends on
an individual's perception of being at risk to get the disease, perceived severity of the
disease, perceived benefits and perceived costs of taking a particular health
action(11)and feeling capable of implementing the desired behavior to achieve
results(12). This study aims to identify the possible factors influencing Sudanese
people’s intention to adhere to the protective measures (staying at home, wearing
masks/gloves and following social distancing measures) using the Health Belief Model.
Methods
2.1 Study design and sampling
A cross-sectional design was used to study participants’ intention to adhere to protective
measures against COVID-19. The study was conducted in Sudan in 2020.The study was
conducted on 625 participants based on the assumption that intention to adhere to
protective measures =50%, precision =5% and alpha = 0.05. Convenience internetbased sampling technique was used.
2.2 Data collection
Using Google forms, an online structured questionnaire was developed by the
researchers based on review of previous literature. The questionnaire link was
distributed to the participants through social media such as: Email, Facebook, What’s
App, Twitter .Etc. The questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic data of
study participants, their health beliefs and intention regarding adherence to

precautionary behavior against COVID-19. Precautionary behaviors are actions taken in
advance to protect against possible exposure to COVID-19. The precautionary
behaviors addressed in this study were: staying at home, wearing masks/gloves and
practicing social distancing on going out.
HBM constructs
The scale measuring HBM constructs consists of 5 subscales measuring perceived
susceptibility & severity of COVID-19, perceived benefits and barriers to adherence to
precautionary behaviors and self- efficacy in adhering to precautionary behaviors.
Responses to scale items were scored on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0
(strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). The score was reversed for some items, it was
calculated for each subscale, converted to percentage and categorized into high (>
66.67%), moderate (33.33% to 66.67%) and low (< or equal to 33.33%).
Intention to adhere to precautionary behaviors
It was assessed using two statements: “In the coming period, I will try to stay at home
and not go out unless necessary”, and “In the coming period, I will try to adhere to the
protective measures (wearing a mask, gloves and social distancing) when going out”.
Responses to scale items were scored on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0
(strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). The score was calculated and converted to
percentage and categorized into high (> 66.67%), moderate (33.33% to 66.67%) and
low (< or equal to 33.33%).
The internal consistency of HBM subscales and intention scale was determined by
Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were 0.862 (perceived
susceptibility),0.798 (perceived severity), 0.799 (perceived benefits), 0.793 (perceived
barriers), 0.757(self-efficacy), 0.798 (perceived severity) and 0.823 (Intention).

Statistical analysis of the data
Data were fed to the computer and analyzed using IBM SPSS software package version
20.0(Armonk, NY: IBM Corp).Qualitative data were described using number and
percent. Quantitative data were described using mean and standard deviation.
Significance of the obtained results was judged at the 5% level. Pearson’s coefficient
was used to correlate between the different variables used in the study. Linear
regression analysis was performed to detect the significant predictors of intention to
adhere to precautionary behavior.
Results
A Total of 680 Sudanese has responded to the questionnaire. The mean age of
participants was 26.7 (±7.95 years), 56.8% of participants were females, 83.7% were
living in Khartoum (the capital of Sudan), 79% were single and77.6% were university
undergraduates. The monthly income of about half the participants (49.6%) was just
enough (Table 1).

The mean percent scores (MPS) of all the domains of the HBM –except for perceived
barriers were pertinentlyhigh indicatingthat participants strongly believedin being
suceptible to COVID-19(80.48%) and that the disease could have severe
consequences(84.99%). Participants also perceived that adherence to the protective
measures such as social distancing and wearing masks was important and beneficial
(93.65%)and were confident in their ability to adhere to these protective
measures(81.01%) if they were available.Nevertheless, the MPS of perceived barriers
was moderately high (61.48%) denoting thatseveral barriers to the

adherence to

protective measures were reported by a significant proportion of participants.The MPS
of intention was high (87.21%) reflecting participants’ strong will to adhere to the
protective measures against COVID-19 (Figure 1).
Most of the participants agreed/strongly agreed on being at risk of getting COVID-19
(71.3%) and on the possibility of getting infected when being in contact with a person
not showing the symptoms of the disease (87.6%) meanwhile, they disagreed/strongly
disagreed on the negative statement “Covid-19 disease is not transmitted through
contact with surfaces or tools”(80.4%).However, more than one third (35.6%) of
participants were not sure whetherthe hot climate in Sudan killed the virus and thus
reduced the possibility of infection. More than 90% of the participants agreed/strongly
agreed that COVID-19 is spreading rapidly and that it may lead to dealth. More than
90% agreed/srongly agreed that adherence to protective measures reduced the number
of cases and decreased spread of the disease. A great majority of the participants
believed that they were capable of staying at home for the entire period of time
specified by the ministry of health, and only go out if necessary (78.7%) and were able
to commit to wearing the mask (if available) whenever they went out

(91.6%).Regarding perceieved barriers, bring the needs of the family was the most
frequently reported factor hindering participants from satying at home (85.1%) followed
by work requirements (62.4%) then feeling bored (46.8%), while disagreements
between family members at home was the least mentioned barrier to staying at home
(17.6%). Concerning factors hindering adherence to protective measures outside
home,the absenceof rules governing the distance between people in crowded places
such as markets and means of public transportation was the barrier most agreed/strongly
agreed upon(91.8%) followed by the unavailability and high prices of gloves/masks
(76.3% and 72.6% respectively) (Table 2).

Figure 1: Mean percent score of the Health Belief model domains and intention

Table 3 shows the correlation between intention and the different parameters of the
HBM. Intention was significantly correlated with all the parameters of the model. The
five parameters of the model were significantly positively correlated except for
perceived barriers which, expectedly, showed a significant negative correlation with
intention and with all the other parameters of the HBM. Self- efficacy had the strongest
positive correlation with intention to adhere to preventive measures (r =0.589) followed
by perceived benefits (r =0.490). Intuitively, this means that the more confident the
person is in his ability to perform the behavior (adhere to protective measures), the more
likely he feels he would perform the behavior. However, intention is influenced by other
factors as well including perceived benefits and perceived severity.

Discussion
This study focused on identifying the health beliefs influencing intention to adhere to
precautionary behavior against the novel corona virus pandemic in Sudan. While
suffering

the

burdens

of

civil

war,

political

instability

and

economic

meltdown(13)Sudan, like all other countries, was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite the unfavorable political and economic conditions and to our surprise
respondents showed high intention to adhere to the protective measures against COVID19. Most of the respondents were relatively young which offers some explanation to
their readiness to accept the change and fight their battle against COVID-19. Evidently,
females were more likely to be willing to adhere to the protective measures against the
disease. This finding was supported by several studies (14)(15)(16)(17)(18) which all
agreed that females were more compliant to health-related guidelines than males.
Intuitively, health educators should invest more effort in educating females who would,
in turn, act as change agents influencing their social networks.

Regarding health beliefs, participants scored high on their health beliefs about
adherence to the protective measures. It seems that the world wide awareness-raising
campaigns played an important role in increasing peoples’ knowledge of the virus and
helped them acquire a more negative attitude towards the disease and a more positive
attitude towards adopting the protective measures against the disease. Hence, most
participants in the present study believed in being susceptible to the disease whether
directly through their contact with infected people or indirectly through their contact
with virus-contaminated surfaces or tools. However, a non-negligible proportion of
participants neither agreed nor disagreed that the hot climate in Sudan killed the virus
and believed that the Sudanese citizen had strong immunity and therefore was less
likely to contract the disease. Such findings should draw the attention of the health
authorities in Sudan to the need to provide credible information to correct the
misunderstanding and clear the ambiguity people might have about the disease.
Nonetheless, it seems that the role of perceived susceptibility was not very evident in
enhancing participants’ intention to adhere to the protective measures.
An intriguing result was that among health beliefs, self-efficacy-and not perceived
barriers- was the most significant predictor of intention. Feeling capable of adhering to
protective measures against COVID-19 has strongly influenced participants’ intention
to do so. This finding highlights the importance of enhancing people’s confidence in
their ability to adhere to protective measures by disseminating credible information
about these measures: what they are, where to be found, when and how to be used.
Moreover, they should be affordable and accessible. Additionally, enforcing rules
concerning social distancing and wearing masks would transform these precautionary
measures into accepted social norms, thus, encouraging people and giving them the

confidence to adhere to such measures. In his Social Cognitive theory, Albert Bandura
described self-efficacy as the most important pre-requisite for behavior change(19)(20).
Indeed, a considerable amount of research revealed that self-efficacy was a significant
predictor of health behavior (21), (22), (23) lending support to our findings.

Examination of correlation analyses revealed that intention to adhere to the protective
measures was also influenced by perceived benefits of the protective measures and
perceived severity of the disease, in the mentioned order. These findings should direct
our efforts to the priority areas needed to be addressed while educating people about the
importance of adherence to the protective measures. Undoubtedly, knowing the role of
each protective measure in protecting people from being infected by the novel Corona
virus and from the possible serious consequences of the disease would encourage them
to adhere to these protective measures. Previous research has shown perceived benefits
and

perceived

severity

to

be

significant

predictors

of

preventive

health

behavior(24)(25)(26)(27).

Several barriers to adherence were documented in the current study, most important of
which were the high prices of masks/gloves, their unavailability in the market and the
absence of rules governing the distance between citizens in public places and public
transportation. As regards staying at home, the most important constraints were bringing
family needs and work demands. Despite not being a significant predictor of intention,
these barriers should not be overlooked. In fact, resolving these barriers would be an
avenue to enhancing people’s self-efficacy and perceived controllability of adherence
behavior. Ultimately, emphasis on some HBM constructs does not mean that we should

ignore other constructs to achieve synergetic effect. In contradiction to our findings,
several studies found perceived barriers to be a significant predictor of preventive health
behaviors including immunization and screening behaviors(25)(28)(29)(30).
Implications for research and practice
This research could be an important guide in designing health education messages to
enhance adherence to the protective measures againstCOVID-19. Educational messages
should essentially focus on improving people’s self-efficacy in adhering to the
protective measures. Moreover, more efforts should be done in targeting females who
would act as influential change agents among their social networks.
Limitations of the study
This study has some limitations. Cues to action were not assessed in this study in order
to avoid a long questionnaire, however, knowing the triggers instigating participants to
adhere to the protective measures would have certainly added to this work. We used the
convenience sampling technique; hence generalization of data would not be possible.
Nonetheless, the present research was able to shed important light on some of the
factors influencing participants’ intention to adhere to the protective measures in Sudan.
A subjective tool -self-report questionnaire -was used to collect data; therefore,
participants’ responses might be affected by social desirability.
Conclusions
Female participants and participants having higher self-efficacy, higher perceived
benefits and higher perceived severity were more likely to be willing to adhere to the
protective measures against COVID-19 in Sudan. The Health Belief model was a useful
