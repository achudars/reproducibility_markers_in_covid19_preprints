Abstract
Background: Public health measures are critical to mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Ethiopia has implemented a variety of essential public health
measures in response to the spread of the virus. This study aimed to assess social distancing and
preventive practices of government employees in response to COVID-19.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1573 government employees selected
from 46 public institutions (16 National, 18 from Addis Ababa City Administration, and 12 from
Oromia Regional State) located in Addis Ababa. Data were collected from 8th to 19th June 2020
using a paper-based self-administered questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS version 23.0.
ANOVA and t-tests were applied to assess the difference between groups. Bivariate and
multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with outcome
variables.

Results: The majority of the participants reported wearing of facemask (96%), avoiding close
contact with people including handshaking (94.5%), frequent had washing (94.1%), maintaining
physical distancing (89.5%), avoiding mass gatherings (88.1%), and restricting movement and
travelling (84.1%). More than 80% of the participants perceived that consistently wearing a
facemask is highly effective in preventing the transmission of coronavirus. Participants from
Oromia reported statistically significantly lower odds of perceived effectiveness of facemask in
preventing coronavirus infection (adjusted OR=0.27, 95% CI:0.17-0.45). About 19% of the
respondents reported that they had ever tested for COVID-19. Participants within the age groups
of 18-29 were more likely to test for coronavirus than the older age groups. Whilst, respondents

from Oromia were less likely to test for coronavirus than those from national level (adjusted
OR=0.31, 95% CI:0.16-0.60). About one-third (31.3%) of the respondents strongly agreed that the
policy responses that the Government had taken to contain the spread of coronavirus were
reasonable, and 38.5% agreed with the policy responses.

Conclusions: The findings showed higher social distancing and preventive practices among the
government employees in response to COVID-19. People should properly apply social distancing
measures, wearing facemasks, and washing hands frequently with water and soap as a
comprehensive package of SARS-CoV-2 prevention and control strategies. Rules and regulations
imposed by the Government should be properly enforced in order to control the pandemic.

Background
The ongoing rapid spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] and first reported in China in
December 2019 [2, 3], has led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the disease as a
global pandemic of public health threat on 11th March 2020 [4]. Since then, the virus has
continually been spread across the world at an extreme rate causing unprecedented deaths mainly
among older age people with underlying health conditions like chronic lung disease, hypertension,
cardiovascular disease, heart disease, diabetes, and obesity [5, 6]. This extraordinary rapid
transmission of the virus has already reached at least 220 countries and territories around the world
and caused over 72 million confirmed cases and more than 1.6 million deaths worldwide as of 14th
December 2020 [7]. Almost all African countries have been hit with the pandemic with the first
confirmed case reported in Egypt on 14th February 2020 [8]. As of 14th December 2020, more than
2.3 million confirmed COVID-19 cases with 56,440 deaths have been reported from Africa, with
the majority of cases reported from South Africa, Morocco, Egypt, Ethiopia and Tunisia [7].

Ethiopia reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on 13th March 2020 [9]. The index case
was a foreigner who tested positive by the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI). Three new
secondary cases that were linked to the index case and an additional confirmed COVID-19 case
imported from Dubai were reported on 15th March. Since the report of the index case, updates and
press statements on the situation of the pandemic in the country have been daily given to the public
by the Ministry of Health (MoH) and EPHI. Most of the cases during the early phase of the
pandemic were detected among people with travel history of abroad, mandatory quarantined
passengers, and health screening at the points of entry to the country [10]. Very soon, new cases

were reported among close contacts of the confirmed cases, and the disease then quickly spread to
the community. The health authorities have since early February stepped up various prevention
and intervention activities against COVID-19. Extensive contact tracing and immediate isolation
of the confirmed cases was implemented by the Government during the early stages of the
pandemic. However, within less than three months after the index case of COVID-19, the virus
quickly spread to all parts of the country. By the first week of June, all regions reported COVID19 cases, with Addis Ababa constituting about 75% of the cases [11]. Increased number of
imported cases along with increased number of secondary cases subsequently contributed to
community transmission. As of 13th December, 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases
in Ethiopia has reached 116,769 and the number of deaths is 1,806.

In the absence of specific therapeutics or effective immunization particularly during the early
stages of a potentially pandemic outbreak such as COVID-19, public health measures are critical
to prevent and interrupt the person-to-person transmission of the virus through respiratory droplets
and close contact [12]. In order to reduce or contain the spread of SARS-COV-2 and its associated
mortality rates, many countries have implemented a lot of public health measures such as isolation,
quarantine, social distancing, facemask wearing and hand hygiene practices [13-15], and these
measures have proved to be effective in many countries [16-19]. Mathematical models of
COVID19 spread have demonstrated the impact of social distancing [20] and universal masking
[21] on the reduction of the spread of coronavirus. Earlier studies on the global outbreak of severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) also demonstrated that the spread of pandemic influenza was
substantially reduced by diligent hand hygiene practices and mask wearing [22, 23]. This implies
that frequent handwashing with soap and water, wearing facemask, social distancing and avoiding

close contacts with other people are the simplest measures that can be applied by everyone to
protect themselves from COVID-19.

The initial containment measures used to contain COVID-19 in Ethiopia during March and April
2020 included intense surveillance for infections, not only in incoming travelers but also screening
of individuals at high risk of infection who had close contact with a confirmed case, immediate
isolation of all confirmed cases, quarantine, and a public campaign for social distancing and
preventive practices. While many governments around the world have implemented drastic
measures to slow down the rate of transmission of COVID-19 such as severe travel restrictions
and lockdowns [24], the Government of Ethiopia has implemented a variety of less drastic essential
measures in response to the spread of the virus, such as airport surveillance and suspension of
flights, travel restrictions, closure of international borders, flexible working arrangements, closing
schools and universities, and mandatory quarantine well ahead of many countries around the
world. Religious organizations cancelled services from March 31st onwards, and conferences and
other mass gatherings and sports have been banned. State of emergency was declared on 8th April
2020 [25]. At the end of May, wearing facemask in public was enforced as mandatory.

The current public health interventions highly promoted and implemented in Ethiopia as part of
the efforts to control the rate of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 at individual level include
frequent handwashing with soap and water, social distancing, wearing facemask including homemade masks, use of alcohol-based sanitizers, staying at home when possible, covering mouth and
nose when coughing and sneezing, and not touching the nose, mouth and eyes, and refraining from
risky behaviors such as travel and mass gatherings. Continuous investigation through laboratory

testing, case detection, isolation and contact tracing has been the milestone of the control efforts
throughout the country to better understand the transmission dynamics and strengthen appropriate
prevention and control strategies [26]. Diagnostic testing capacity was scaled-up from zero in early
March to over 8,000 tests per day by early August 2020. Despite all the public health measures,
the daily number of positive cases is steadily increasing in the country, but at a slower rate than
earlier estimates.

Studies have shown that strong public health measures such as social distancing and preventive
behaviors have resulted in a substantial reduction in the transmission of COVID-19 [16, 20]. The
impact of public health interventions and population behavioral changes that have been rolled out
in Ethiopia to contain COVID-19 transmission has not been evaluated. High public compliance to
proper risk reduction measures such as practicing social distancing, wearing mask, frequent
handwashing and staying home can be effectively achieved if the public understands and is
persuaded of the importance of these measures in the prevention and control of COVID-19 [27].
Thus far, very limited research has reported on how individuals have practiced protective
behaviors in response to COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia [28-30]. The aim of this study was to
assess the health protective measures such as social distancing and preventive behaviors of
government employees in Addis Ababa in response to COVID-19. The results of this study are
important to inform future efforts focusing on the people’s readiness to comply with pandemic
control measures and the development of preventive strategies and health promotion programs,
given that proper practices of social distancing and preventive behaviors can play important roles
in the prevention and control of COVID-19.

Methods
Study setting
This study was conducted in Addis Ababa city administration three months after the first
confirmed COVID-19 case in Ethiopia. Addis Ababa city has the highest rate of COVID-19 cases
and deaths in Ethiopia, and is considered as an epicenter of COVID-19 in the country. Of the total
4,070 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in the country as of 19th June, the majority (73.4%) of
the cases were reported from Addis Ababa. During the data collection period between 8th and 19th
June 2020, the total number of confirmed new COVID-19 cases reported in the country was 2,064
including 45 deaths, of which Addis Ababa contributed 71.6% of the cases and 89% of the deaths.
During the 12 days of data collection, the number of COVID-19 in Addis Ababa increased from
1,625 on 8th June to 2,988 on 19th June, representing an increase of 84%. The most impacted subcities included Addis Ketema, Lideta, and Gulele, while Akaki sub-city had the lowest number of
cases, and most of the cases were due to community transmission as of the first week of May.

Study design and sampling
A cross-sectional survey was conducted among government employees of 46 public institutions
located in Addis Ababa. Due to physical distancing restrictions, it was not possible to conduct a
representative community-based face-to-face interview during this period. As a result, this study
collected data using institution-based self-administered survey. The study population for this study
constituted all government employees, working in the selected government institution at the time
of the survey and willing to participate in the study. These included professionals, experts,
technicians and support staff working at different hierarchies and divisions/directorates in the
institution including higher and midlevel officials.

A sample size of 1,710 was calculated with a precision of 4% to estimate a 50% proportion with
95% confidence, a design effect of 2 and 30% non-response rate. Purposive sampling was used to
select public institutions located in Addis Ababa city administration. The institutions were
stratified into three government levels and selected from the national or Federal Government
Ministries, Addis Ababa city administration bureaus and sub-cities, and Oromia Regional State
bureaus located in Addis Ababa [Additional file 1]. The study participants were assumed to
represent employees from the community in Addis Ababa and its environs involved in policy and
decision-making processes. The decisions and practices made by these people would subsequently
have direct or indirect influence on individuals, family and the community in response to COVID19.

The data collectors initially contacted the respective higher official in the institution to explain the
purpose of the survey and submit the support letter. After approval of the support letter, the Human
Resource Directorate of the respective institutions were contacted to obtain information on the
total number of employees, number of directorates and departments in the institution with their
respective number of personnel. The sample size initially allocated to the institution was
distributed to the directorates or departments proportional to the size of their employees. Emphasis
was given to equally select the participants, to proportionally distribute the number of
questionnaires to the different directorates or departments in the selected institutions based on the
size of their employees. In this survey, we tried to avoid selection bias by including as many
representative respondents’ as possible within the shortest possible time. Since some employees
were working on a shift basis due to the current situation of COVID-19 pandemic, their availability

was taken into consideration while distributing the questionnaires. When the selected respondent
was known that he/she couldn’t return to the office during the first 2-3 days of the survey,
replacement was made. Emphasis was also given to ensure the gender balance during the selection
of the respondents and distribution of the questionnaires.

Data collection
A paper-based self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data [Additional file 2]. The
questionnaire was developed by the research team for the purpose of this survey, and some
questions were adapted from the WHO tools used for a similar study [31]. The questionnaire had
three main parts: (1) socio-demographic characteristics; (2) social distancing, and (3) preventive
practices. The tool was initially developed in English and translated into Amharic and Afan Oromo
by experienced personnel, and back translated into English for accuracy by independent personnel.
Trained personnel with previous experience collected the data using standardized paper-based selfadministered questionnaires. The questionnaire included an introductory information on the cover
letter to inform participants about the study and explaining the purpose of the survey, consent
information to ensure voluntary participation in the study while ensuring confidentiality of data,
and researchers contact information for any questions the respondent might have. Individuals who
declined to participate were excluded from the survey. Participants completed the questionnaires
by themselves in the local language (Afan Oromo in the Oromia Regional State Offices and
Amharic otherwise).

In this study, social distancing and preventive practices were defined as the main health protective
measures that are adopted and applied by people to protect themselves and others from contracting

disease pandemics such as COVID-19 and slowing down the spread of the virus [32-34]. Social
distancing practices include physical distancing, staying at home when sick, working from work,
avoiding mass gatherings, social events, crowded places, public transport and travelling, and avoiding
close contact with people including shaking hands or hugging. Physical distancing involves the
practice of maintaining at least two adult strides or two meters distance between two or more people.
Preventive behaviors or hygiene practices include wearing a facemask, washing hands more
frequently with water and soap, using hand sanitizer more regularly, cleaning and disinfecting
surfaces including mobile phones, avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth, and covering the mouth
and nose when coughing and sneezing using a tissue paper or bent elbow.

Statistical analyses
Data were entered into the Census and Survey Processing System (CSPro) software package,
version 7.2 (U.S. Census Bureau and ICF Macro) and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social
Sciences (SPSS) version 23 (SPSS Inc., IBM, USA). The outcome of interest was COVID-19
related protective practices (social distancing and preventive practices) taken by individuals. These
variables were based on the question “Which of the following measures, if any, are you currently
taking to prevent yourself against COVID-19”? Respondents were able to select from 14 possible
protective health measures including staying at home, maintaining physical distancing, avoiding
close contact with people including handshaking, covering mouth/nose with face/cloth mask when
going outdoors, washing hands with soap and water frequently, avoiding touching eyes, nose and
mouth, avoiding mass gathering, covering mouth/nose while coughing or sneezing, restricting
movement, testing for novel coronavirus, recommending the use of facemask to people when going
outdoors, and following government recommendations to combat COVID-19. Responses were

recoded as ‘1=Yes’ and ‘0=No’. A composite index of the average of all items was created for
each respondent to form total preventive measures being taken by the individual, ranging from 0
to 14, with a higher score indicating that participants demonstrate higher protective measures. The
internal consistency of the items was moderate (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.798).

Basic descriptive statistical methods such as frequencies, percentages, means, standard deviations,
and cross-tabulations were conducted to summarize the data and determine the differences
between groups for selected demographic variables. Descriptive statistics by level of government
were summarized using frequency distribution tables. Preventive health measures scores were
compared according to demographic characteristics with independent samples t-test, or one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) test using Tukey HSD post-hoc comparison as appropriate.
Bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors
associated with outcome variables. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for
each predictor were estimated from the logistic regression to quantify the associations between
potential predictors and outcome variables. The statistical significance level was set at p<0.05.

Ethical approval
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the College of Health Sciences at
Addis Ababa University (AAU) (protocol number: 042/20/SPH). Informed consent was obtained
from each participant. Permission to undertake this study was obtained from every relevant
authority at all levels. Official letters from AAU were written to each institution to cooperate and
participate in the survey. Written or oral prior to responding to the questions. Participation was
voluntary, anonymous and any participant could withdraw from completing the questionnaire at

any time and were at liberty to not answer any question they did not want to answer. Anonymity
and data confidentiality were ensured. All personnel involved in the survey received orientation
on COVID-19 infection prevention and control measures, and wore protective face masks and used
sanitizers during data collection.

Results
Sociodemographic characteristics
In total, 1,730 eligible participants from 46 government institutions were invited to participate in
the study and 1,577 participants completed the questionnaires. Of these, 1,573 were valid and used
for analysis (91.6%). The completed questionnaires per institution ranged from 18-58, with an
average of 34.3. About 91% of the study participants provided written informed consent, while
9% provided verbal informed consent. Table 1 shows the sociodemographic characteristics of the
study participants. About 40% of the study participants were drawn from national institutions,
38.8% from Addis Ababa city administration institutions and 21.6% from Oromia Regional State
institutions located in Addis Ababa. The majority of the respondents were in the age group of 18
and 39 years (73.3%), male (64.2%), with a bachelor’s degree or above (88.3%) and lived in Addis
Ababa (82.2%). The mean (±SD) year of service in the institution was 6.6 (±6.4) years. About
19% of the respondents reported that they were tested for COVID-19, 7.1% reported any chronic
illness, and only 2% were quarantined due to COVID-19.

Social distancing and preventive practices
Respondents were asked to indicate the types of protective measures they applied to prevent
contracting COVID-19. Figure 1 presents the proportions of respondents who reported positively
to the 14 social distancing measures and preventive practices taken in response to COVID-19.
Overall, more than 9 in 10 respondents (95.9%) reported wearing facemask, 95.6% reported that
they consistently followed the recommendations from the authorities to combat COVID-19, 92%
reported that they recommended the wearing of facemask for healthy people out of the healthcare
setting, 94.5% avoided close contact with people including handshaking, 94.1% reported
frequently washing hands with water and soap, 90.8% covered mouth/nose while coughing or
sneezing, 90.7% avoided touching eyes, nose and mouth (90.7%), and 89.5% practiced physical
distancing. The majority of the respondents also reported avoiding mass gatherings and crowded
places (88.1%), disinfected surfaces (77.6%), disinfected mobile phones (76.9%), restricted
movement and traveling (71.8%), ate garlic, ginger and lemon (57.9%). The lowest level of
compliance in response to COVID-19 was related to staying home, which was reported by 38.6%
of participants.

Table 2 shows the distribution of the positive responses of the respondents to the 14 social
distancing and preventive measures by the Government level. The majority (>90%) of the
respondents reported the practice of wearing facemask, followed Government recommendations,
avoided close contact with people, frequently washed hands and avoided touching eyes, nose and
mouth across all the three Government levels. However, disinfecting surfaces (91.2%), staying
home (45.7%), and restricting movement and travelling (84.1%) were more frequently reported in
Oromia compared with respondents from Addis Ababa and national level. Whilst, wearing
facemask (97.3%) and consistently following Government recommendations (97.1%) were more
commonly reported among the national respondents than those from Oromia. This study also
revealed that 64% of respondents from Oromia, 58% from national and 54% from Addis Ababa
reported that they used garlic, ginger and lemon for prevention of coronavirus infection.

The positive responses of the 14 social distancing and preventive practices in response to COVID19 were added to produce the scores of the overall reported practice. Summing the positive
responses across the total measures for each individual revealed a mean sample score of 11±2.3
measures taken and a median of 12 measures with an interquartile range (IQR) of 2, on a scale of
14. About 24% and 20% of the respondents scored 13 and 14 positive responses on the protective
measures taken in response to COVID-19, respectively, while 10.6% scored 8 or less responses
(Figure 2). Table 3 shows the distribution and comparison of the respondent’s mean scores of
protective measures taken in response to COVID-19 by socio-demographic characteristics using
ANOVA test and independent samples t-test. Female respondents had a statistically significant
higher mean score responses (11.8±2.48) compared with males (p=0.007). Similarly, respondents
who reported a household size of 4-5 had a significantly higher mean score responses (11.8±2.19)
of protective practices compared with others (p=0.014). However, study participants from the

Addis Ababa had a statistically significant lower mean score responses (11.2±2.59) compared with
those from national and Oromia (p=0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the
mean score protective practices among the age groups, level of education, year of experience, area
of residence, reported COVID-19 testing, whether quarantined or reporting any chronic illness.

Perceived effectiveness of mask wearing and associated factors
More than 80% of the participants perceived that consistently wearing a facemask is highly
effective in preventing the transmission of coronavirus. Only 9.3% of the respondents disagreed
or strongly disagreed about the effectiveness of facemask in the prevention of coronavirus
infection. Nearly 21% of the respondents in Oromia neither agreed nor disagreed about the
effectiveness of facemasks in the prevention of coronavirus infection. Table 4 shows the findings
of the bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses of predictors associated with the
respondent’s perceived effectiveness of consistently wearing facemask in preventing the infection
due to coronavirus. The variables were initially assessed by bivariate analysis and retained in the
multivariate models whether or not they were statistically significant. Among ten predictors
assessed by bivariate logistic regression analyses, respondents who served in the institution more
than 15 years (OR=0.68, 95% CI:0.45-1.03) and who were from Oromia (OR=0.31, 95% CI:0.220.43) perceived less effectiveness of facemask, whilst, study participants who resided in Addis
Ababa (OR=2.02, 95% CI:1.44-2.83) and who were tested for coronavirus (OR=1.43, 95%
CI:1.00-2.04) were more likely perceived higher effectiveness of facemasks to prevent coronavirus
infection. In the multivariable logistic regression, participants from Oromia, compared to the
national respondents, reported statistically significantly lower odds (adjusted OR=0.27, 95%
CI:0.17-0.45) of perceived effectiveness of facemask in preventing coronavirus infection.
However, the other predictor variables were not statistically significant in the multivariate
analyses.

COVID-19 testing and associated factors
About 19% (n=300) of the respondents reported that they had ever tested for coronavirus infection,
with 25% of respondents at national level, 19.3% from Addis Ababa and 7.7% from Oromia. With
regard to the question on the certainty of getting a COVID-19 test if needed, 11% of the
respondents were completely sure, 18.1% were very sure, and 26% were somewhat sure. However,
15.1% did not know and 14.6% were not at all sure where and when to get coronavirus test if they
wanted to be tested. Table 5 shows the results of the bivariate and multivariable logistic regression
analyses conducted to explore factors associated with testing for COVID-19. In the bivariate
analyses gender, age, year of experience, level of government, area of residence, reported chronic
illness and being quarantined were significantly associated with testing for COVID-19. In the
multivariable logistic regression analyses, the age groups 18-29 were more likely to test for
coronavirus than the older age groups. In contrast, respondents from Oromia were less likely to
test for coronavirus (adjusted OR=0.31, 95% CI:0.16-0.60) than those from national level. Gender,
educational status, year of experience, household size, residence, reported chronic illness and
being quarantined did not appear statistically significant in the multivariable logistic regression
model to predict the odds of testing for COVID-19.

Perceived adequacy of policy responses
Table 6 shows the perceptions of the respondents towards the policy decisions made by the
Government to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Just under the third (31.3%) of the
respondents strongly agreed that the policy responses that the Government had taken to contain
the spread of coronavirus were fair and reasonable, and 38.5% agreed with the policy responses.
However, 22.8% of the respondents in Oromia disagreed about the fairness and reasonability of
policy responses taken by the Government. Over half (57.1%) of the study participants perceived
that the current policy measures taken by the Government to contain the spread of coronavirus are
inadequate (37.7%) or very inadequate (19.4%). More respondents from Oromia (63.7%) as
compared with 59.3% in Addis Ababa and just about half (51.1%) at national level perceived that
the current policy measures taken by the Government to contain the spread of coronavirus
transmission were inadequate.

Discussion
The findings of the current study revealed high level of reported practices of COVID-19 protective
measures, particularly with regard to mask wearing in public (95.9%), avoiding close contact with
people and handshaking (94.5%), frequent handwashing with water and soap (94.1%), maintaining
physical distancing (89.5%), avoiding crowds and gatherings (88%), and movement restriction
(72%). A study conducted during the early phase of the pandemic in Ethiopia reported a lower
level of protective behaviors against the COVID-19 infection such as washing hands frequently
(77%), avoiding shaking hands (54%) and not going to crowded places (33%) [30]. A study
conducted in Malaysia reported that a high proportion of respondents already adopted avoidance
behaviors such as not going to crowded places (83%) and practicing proper hand hygiene (88%)
at the time of their study in late March 2020, despite low level of mask wearing (51%) [35]. It has
been observed that staying at home, maintaining physical distancing, avoiding public transport and
escaping going to public places is particularly difficult for many government employees, resulting
in less adoption of these protective measures.

The current study analyzed factors affecting the mean score of the practice of social distancing and
preventive practices of COVID-19. The study indicates that female gender was more likely than
men to report social distancing measures and preventive practices probably since they had greater
motivation for health or perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 than men. The results are consistent
with those reported during the pandemic [32]. In a cross-sectional study of preventive health
behaviors in Iran, the mean score of preventive behaviors from COVID-19 was higher in females
than males [36]. In studies carried out on the pandemic of SARS (H1N1) epidemic in Hong Kong
and Singapore, women were more likely than men to adopt protective behaviors such as

handwashing, mask wearing, and respiratory hygiene [37-39]. Moreover, respondents working in
Oromia or national offices and those having 4-5 household size were more likely than others to
report protective health measures against COVID-19 probably due to the difference in their
awareness and knowledge levels of the disease.

A study conducted during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in China identified that
respondents adopted important protective behaviors, and nearly all study participants (98%) wore
masks when going out in public during the study period [40]. In Hong Kong, individual behaviors
in the population changed in response to the threat of COVID-19, and 85% of respondents reported
avoiding crowded places and 99% reported wearing facemasks in public [16]. Until effective
treatments and vaccines are available, behavioral interventions such as social distancing and
preventive practices are the most recommended tools to prevent and control the spread of COVID19 [41]. Studies found that the non-pharmaceutical interventions (including border restrictions,
quarantine, isolation, physical distancing, and changes in population behavior) were substantially
associated with reduced transmission of COVID-19 [16]. Maintaining and sustaining high levels
of actual protective practices, particularly wearing mask at public, is critically important and
concerted efforts should be made by the government, media, healthcare professionals, local
organizations, the community and individuals to combat COVID-19 focusing on preventive health
behaviors.

According to the current study, about 80% of the respondents perceived that consistently wearing
facemask is highly effective in preventing the spread of coronavirus, and 92% supported its use by
healthy people in public. At the time of data collection for this study, discussions were underway

whether facemasks should be used in public by healthy people out of the healthcare setting. The
WHO earlier in April advised not to use facemasks in the community setting by healthy individuals
without respiratory symptoms [14], but later recommended universal masking in June [15] when
asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 was established [42, 43].
Recently, masks have mainly been worn by individuals in the general community who have certain
respiratory symptoms and by those who feel particularly susceptible to infection and want to
protect themselves [16].

Studies from China and the US [19] have shown wearing masks is effective in reducing the risk of
infection and mitigating the spread of COVID-19, particularly when combined with other
preventive measures such as physical distancing and frequent handwashing [19, 44]. A recent
systematic review and meta-analysis study funded by the WHO demonstrated the effectiveness of
physical distancing of 1m or more and the use of facemasks in public and health-care settings in
the prevention of coronavirus transmission, where both interventions reduced the risk of infection
of coronavirus by more than 80% [45]. A case-control study from Thailand found that mask
wearing, frequent handwashing and social distancing of ≥1m were independently and significantly
associated with reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the general public [46]. Another
study showed that the use of facemasks among the general population significantly reduced total
infections and the number of deaths, and mask wearing is considered as one of the most effective
public health measures in mitigating transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [47]. These studies provide the
most reliable evidence on the effectiveness of simultaneous use of social distancing measures and
wearing of facemasks at community level to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. However, there

are still inconsistent scientific evidence that contradicts the effectiveness of using facemasks by
healthy people in the community to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 [48].

The current study also assessed factors affecting the perceived effectiveness of mask wearing
against the prevention of coronavirus infection. It was found that respondents from Oromia were
less likely to report the effectiveness of wearing facemasks to prevent the transmission of SARSCoV-2 than those from national or Addis Ababa levels, which could be associated with inadequate
awareness or knowledge about the protective benefits of wearing facemask against the infection
of SARS-COV-2. The more people became aware of the risk of COVID-19 to themselves, the
more likely they begin practicing protective behaviors like mask wearing, handwashing and social
distancing. In Ethiopia, mask wearing in public is not a common practice before the occurrence of
COVID-19 pandemic. Even after the onset of the pandemic, mask wearing practice in public was
very minimal, but it increased immediately when the mandatory policy of facemask wearing for
all people in public and working places was enforced at the end of May 2020.

The present study also showed that respondents aged between 18 and 29 years were more likely
to be tested for COVID-19 compared to the older respondents, while study participants from
Oromia were less likely to be tested compared with respondents from national or Addis Ababa
levels. Behavioral changes are currently one of the main tools to fight against COVID-19. These
changes include practicing physical distancing, frequent handwashing, using hand sanitizers,
wearing facemasks and testing for COVID-19. Nonetheless, these behavioral measures are
effective if they are widely accepted and applied by the public. To have these measures widely
understood and implemented by the community, the government needs to embark upon heightened

mass campaigns to educate the public about the significance of frequent handwashing, wearing
facemasks, and social distancing in containing the transmission of SARS-COV-2.

A significant proportion (58%) of respondents in the current study reported that they used garlic,
ginger and lemon to protect themselves against SARS-COV-2 infection, which indicates
unconfirmed practices or misconceptions. Although these home remedies are important
ingredients of our daily food and may have some medicinal properties, it is a great misconception
to believe and use them against COVID-19 since they have not been tested against SARS-COV2. Studies have found no evidence that the use of herbal remedies such as garlic and ginger is
effective against infection from coronavirus or cure from COVID-19 [49, 50]. The WHO has also
confirmed that there is no evidence that eating garlic or ginger has protected people from SARSCOV-2 infection [51]. Current evidence shows that using ginger or garlic or combining them with
other ingredients, such as lemon, or drinking hot ginger tea will not prevent or cure COVID-19.

At the time of this study, the spread of COVID-19 in Addis Ababa city cumulatively increased
from 1,625 on 8th June to 2,988 on 19th June, with an average of 114 per day. Despite efforts to
contain and mitigate the transmission of coronavirus in the city, the virus has continued to spread
to all parts of the city at an alarming rate and more cases from the community have continued to
emerge on a daily basis. COVID-19 appeared to quickly spread in Ethiopia through the movement
and frequent contact between people. Physical distancing has remained a major challenge due to
overcrowding and, people are confronted with the logistical and communication problems
particularly due to the shortage of means of transportation. Staying home approaches were
particularly challenged in the context of poverty in the city where many residents lack adequate

shelter, sanitation, and economic means for livelihood. Although staying home and physical
distancing slows the transmission of SARS-COV-2, they result in heavy toll particularly on the
informal economic and casual labor sector due to search of income for the day-to-day livelihood
[24].

Ethiopia declared a state of emergency in April to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 pandemic
[25]. Mandatory facemask wearing at banks, marketplaces, transport depots, in public transit,
shops, pharmacies, places where public services are provided or any other public space of mass
gatherings was mandated in the state of emergency. In addition, the Government also made
mandatory facemask wearing for all people outside of their homes or offices on 27th May. As
a result, the practice of social distancing measures and preventive behaviors such as mask wearing
in public have been significantly improved until the state of emergency was lifted on 11th
September 2020. Unfortunately, this was followed by the roll back of the already adopted social
distancing measures and preventive practices by the public. Consequently, the EPHI adopted a
directive on 5th October, which enforced mandatory wearing of facemasks in public places,
maintaining physical distancing of at least 2 m apart from other people; regular handwashing with
soap or alcoholic-based sanitizers; and prohibited any organization to provide service to any person
who is not wearing a facemask [52]. However, these measures have not been well enforced and
the public has become reluctant regarding the social distancing and preventive practices of
COVID-19. As the practice of social distancing involves staying home and away from others as
much as possible to help prevent spread of COVID-19, Ethiopia mainly promoted physical
distancing which involves the need to stay at least 2 m from others, complemented by wearing
facemasks. Studies have shown the effectiveness of social distancing and mandatory facemask in

public in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in many countries, and both interventions and the
simultaneous implementation of other preventive measures have been identified as the strategic
priorities for containing COVID-19 [53].

Limitations
This study had some limitations including selection bias that deserve explanations. First, the study
only included government employees in Addis Ababa, and it failed to include unemployed people
or other individuals working in non-governmental or private institutions, leading to concerns about
the representativeness of the sample. There might be differences in adapting protective health
measures between employed and unemployed people as well as between employees of
governmental and non-governmental institutions. Second, due to the threat of COVID-19 and the
physical distancing rule, it was not possible to conduct either a face-to-face interview or a
community-based representative study. Third, the data presented in this study are based on
retrospective self-reports of respondents without verification, thus the results might be subject to
social desirability and recall biases.

Conclusions
Despite the limitations, this study generated valuable information about protective behaviors of
COVID-19 among government employees. The findings showed higher social distancing and
preventive practices in response to COVID-19. In the current pandemic scenario, people should
follow the Governments’ instructions and properly apply social distancing measures, wearing
facemasks, and washing hands frequently with water and soap. Rules and regulations imposed by
the Government should be properly enforced in order to control the pandemic. The findings have

significant implications in identifying ways of promoting compliance with recommended
protective health behaviors to effectively control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The results of
this study can be used as a baseline data to the government and researchers for other larger studies
to identify factors significantly associated with preventive health measures.
