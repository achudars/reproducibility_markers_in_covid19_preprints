Abstract
Many countries have seen a two-wave pattern in reported cases of coronavirus disease-19

34

during the 2020 pandemic, with a first wave during spring followed by the current second wave in

35

late summer and autumn. Empirical data show that the characteristics of the effects of the virus do

36

vary between the two periods. Differences in age range and severity of the disease have been

37

reported, although the comparative characteristics of the two waves still remain largely unknown.

38

Those characteristics are compared in this study using data from two equal periods of 3 and a half

39

months. The first period, between 15th March and 30th June, corresponding to the entire first wave,

40

and the second, between 1st July and 15th October, corresponding to part of the second wave, still

41

present at the time of writing this article. Two hundred and four patients were hospitalized during

42

the first period, and 264 during the second period. Patients in the second wave were younger and

43

the duration of hospitalization and case fatality rate were lower than those in the first wave. In the

44

second wave, there were more children, and pregnant and post-partum women. The most frequent

45

signs and symptoms in both waves were fever, dyspnea, pneumonia, and cough, and the most

46

relevant comorbidities were cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic

47

neurological diseases. Patients from the second wave more frequently presented renal and

48

gastrointestinal symptoms, were more often treated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation and

49

corticoids, and less often with invasive mechanical ventilation, conventional oxygen therapy and

50

anticoagulants. Several differences in mortality risk factors were also observed. These results might

51

help to understand the characteristics of the second wave and the behaviour and danger of SARS-

52

CoV-2 in the Mediterranean area and in Western Europe. Further studies are needed to confirm our

53

findings.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), produced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome

58

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic, giving rise to a serious health threat

59

globally. Several countries have seen a two-wave pattern of reported cases, with a first wave in

60

spring and a second in late summer and autumn [1-6]. In Spain, the first wave of COVID-19 began

61

in early March 2020, although some isolated cases had been reported in February [7]. As a

62

consequence of the first outbreak, the Spanish Government introduced a series of strict prevention

63

measures, including home confinement, which lasted from 13th March to 4th May, followed by a

64

three-month period of progressively increasing social interaction, work and commercial activity. As

65

of July, life in the country had returned to relative normality, except for the mandatory wearing of a

66

face mask and maintaining a safe social distance. Unfortunately, the number of cases of patients

67

with COVID-19 began to increase towards the end of August and a month later it once again

68

presented numbers similar to those in April. This forced the Government to reintroduce serious

69

restrictive measures, including local and regional lockdowns, closures of bars, restaurants, cultural

70

and sports activities, and a general curfew after 10 pm. The second wave of COVID-19 had been

71

predicted months earlier and had already occurred in other countries [4]. The vast majority of

72

Western European countries are currently suffering the consequences of this second wave and are

73

taking similar restrictive measures. However, empirical data would suggest that this second wave

74

differs from the first in such factors as age range and severity of the disease [8]. Indeed, it has been

75

suggested that this second wave in Europe might be linked to the appearance of a new variant of the

76

SARS-CoV-2, termed 20A.EU1, which appears to have originated in Spain, from where it then

77

spread to the rest of Europe through tourists who had spent their summer holidays in that area [9].

78

The similarities and differences between the characteristics of the two waves remain largely

79

unknown. Population comparison is difficult because the technological and logistical capacity of the

80

countries in detection and diagnosis of asymptomatic patients and those with mild symptoms has

improved greatly in the six months since spring, and it is assumed that the incidence of infection in

82

the early months of the pandemic was much higher than had been reported [10]. However, a more

83

accurate comparison of the two waves is feasible through the study of the hospitalized patients for

84

whom disease was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and

85

severe symptoms.

86

This study investigated the severity and characteristics of the two waves in hospitalized

87

patients in Reus, Spain. We evaluated age, gender, symptoms, comorbidities, mortality, supportive

88

care, medication, and the outcome for the patient.

89

Materials and Methods

90

Study design

91

We conducted a prospective study of all hospitalized cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in

92

Hospital Universitari de Sant Joan, in Reus, Spain, admitted between 15th March and 15th October

93

2020. All patients admitted up to 30th June were considered to be in the first wave and all those

94

admitted from 1st July in the second wave, which divided the study period into two equal parts of

95

three and a half months. The only inclusion criterion was to be a hospitalized patient with an

96

analytical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. We excluded those with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection but

97

had no laboratory confirmation and those who came to the hospital with symptoms compatible with

98

COVID-19 but did not require hospitalization. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by RT-PCR

99

using swab samples from the upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal exudate), from

100

the lower respiratory tract (sputum/endotracheal aspirate/bronchoalveolar lavage/bronchial aspirate)

101

or from the lower digestive tract (rectal smear). Tests were carried out with the VIASURE SARS-

102

CoV-2 Real Time PCR Detection Kit (CerTest Biotec, Zaragoza, Spain), or with the Procleix

103

method in a Panther automated extractor and amplifier (Grifols Laboratories, Barcelona, Spain).

107

Calculation of sample size

108

Accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of less than 0.2 in a bilateral contrast, it takes

109

137 subjects in the first wave and 105 in the second wave to detect a difference equal to or greater

110

than 8 years in the variable age. The common standard deviation is assumed to be 22. A follow-up

111

loss rate of 0% was estimated.

112

Statistical analyses

113

Data is given as numbers and percentages or means and standard deviations. Statistical

114

comparisons between two groups were made using the χ2 test (categorical variables) or the

115

Student’s t test. Logistic regression models were fitted to investigate the combined effect of selected

116

variables on mortality. Statistical significance was set at p ≤0.05. All calculations were made using

117

the SPSS 25.0 statistical package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

118

Results

119

The raw data of this study are as Supporting Information. During the study period, 468

120

patients with SARS-Co-V2 infection, confirmed by RT-PCR, were admitted to the hospital. The

121

seasonal distribution of hospital admissions is shown in Figure 1. The first wave peaked at the end

122

of March and was followed by a progressive decrease with very few patients being admitted in May

123

and June. The number of cases fluctuated upward from mid-July until a sharp increase in mid-

124

October. The number of patients admitted was 204 in the first wave and 264 in the second one.

125

Those in the second wave were significantly younger (58 ± 26 vs. 67 ± 18 years; p <0.001). A

126

noteworthy feature of the second wave was the high number of children between 0 and 9 years of

127

age (n = 21), 12 of them being babies under 1 year (Figure 2). The department to which the patients

128

were admitted is shown in Table 1. The second wave caused a significantly higher number of

129

admissions to Gynecology, Pediatrics and Emergency Departments and fewer to Internal Medicine

and ICU. The duration of hospitalization was significantly shorter in the second wave (14 ± 19 vs.

131

22 ± 25 days; p < 0.001). A total of 49 deaths occurred during the first wave and 35 during the

132

second wave, so the case fatality rate decreased from 24.0% to 13.2%. The patients who died were

133

significantly older than the survivors and those who died in the second wave were older than those

134

in the first wave (83 ± 10 vs. 78 ± 13 years; p = 0.042).

The relationships between COVID-19 and the clinical and epidemiological variables are

146

shown in Figure 3 and Table 2. The most frequent signs and symptoms in both waves were fever,

147

dyspnea, pneumonia, and cough (Figure 3A). The most relevant comorbidities were cardiovascular

148

diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic neurological diseases (Figure 3B). Patients from the

149

second wave differed from those of the first wave in that they more frequently presented a higher

150

frequency of vomiting, astenia, abdominal pain, rhinorrhea, or acute kidney failure, and less

151

frequently a cough or chills. There was no significant difference in the frequency of concomitant

152

chronic diseases. One result that we consider noteworthy is the considerably higher frequency in the

153

second wave of pregnant women who went to the hospital to give birth and post-partum women.

We also evaluated the differences in treatments between the two groups of patients. Subjects

167

from the second wave were treated more often with non-invasive mechanical ventilation and

168

corticoids, and less often with invasive mechanical ventilation, conventional oxygen therapy and

169

anticoagulants (Table 3). Regarding other treatments, patients in the first wave received lopinavir,

170

ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine, while those in the second wave received remdesivir and

tocilizumab.

Finally, we wanted to identify which factors were the most important determinants of death

178

in the two groups of patients. Logistic regression analyses highlighted the importance of age, fever,

179

dyspnea, acute respiratory distress syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cancer in the first wave

180

(Table 4), and of age, gender, smoking habit, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and chronic

neurological diseases in the second wave (Table 5).

Discussion
We have previously reported the main epidemiological and clinical characteristics and the

200

mortality risk factors of the first wave patients during a month and a half between March and April

201

[11]. In the present investigation we extended the study to mid-October to cover two equal periods

202

of three and a half months. More patients were admitted during the second wave, they were younger

203

and there were fewer deaths, in agreement with results reported by previous research in several

204

countries [2,3,12]. The reasons for the clear differences between the two periods are not yet known

205

although it has been suggested that a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in early summer 2020 in

206

Spain [9], a variant that was linked to outbreaks among young agricultural workers in the north-east

207

of the country. Transmission to the general population in that area was then replicated across the

208

country. Furthermore, poor compliance with social distancing guidelines by young people might

209

have facilitated contagion in young, healthy adults and children [2,13]. The decrease in the age of

210

the patients then resulted in a decrease in the case fatality rate in that those patients who died were

211

on average 5 years older than the victims of the first wave. Moreover, fewer patients required

212

respiratory assistance via invasive mechanical ventilation methods. This improvement in the results

213

of admitted patients might be linked to the fact that the health system in our country, as in many

214

others, has since become better prepared. We have more experience and better treatment regimens,

215

and we carry out more diagnostic tests, allowing serious cases to be detected early and to receive

216

more effective treatments. In this regard, during the second period, patients were treated more

217

frequently with dexamethasone, as suggested by the RECOVERY study [14], and

218

hydroxychloroquine and loponavir-ritonavir were substituted by remdesivir and tocilizumab, which

219

several studies have reported to be more effective than in preventing death and shortening the

220

duration of hospital stays [15-17]. Another factor that might have contributed to the decrease in the

221

case fatality rate is the improvement in environmental conditions. For example, warm weather and

222

improved air quality following the city lockdown have been reported to correlate negatively with

223

SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility [18-20].

224

A new and remarkable characteristic of the incidence of COVID-19 in this second wave in

225

our population is the higher incidence in babies, children and pregnant women who went to the

226

hospital to give birth or in post-partum women. The vast majority of these patients did not present

227

serious symptoms and so did not require hospitalization for more than 4 days. There were no deaths

228

among children up to 9 years of age, pregnant or post-partum women. The predominant symptom

229

presented by the children was fever (19 out of 21 cases, 90.5%), while pregnant and post-partum

230

women (13 and 17 cases, respectively) were asymptomatic and promptly discharged. These results

231

highlight the role of family contact in the transmission of the virus and agree with previous reports

232

that have indicated the generally low severity of the disease in these patients [21-24].

233

The predominant symptoms of infection (fever, dyspnea, pneumonia cough) were similar in

234

both waves, although the patients in the second wave presented renal (acute kidney failure) and

235

gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, abdominal pain) more frequently. Indeed, the Spanish

236

Ministry of Health has already highlighted, in a document updated on 2nd October, the higher

13
237

incidence of the latter in the second wave [25]. The present study did not find any differences

238

between the frequency of concomitant diseases in the two waves, similar findings to those of our

239

preliminary study [9]. In this respect, we differ from a previous study conducted in Japan that has

240

reported a lower incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases [3].

241

Lastly, regarding the risk factors associated with mortality, we also found differences

242

between the first and second waves. Multiple regression analysis showed that older age and the

243

presence of fever, dyspnea, acute respiratory distress syndrome, diabetes, and cancer were

244

independently associated with higher mortality in the first wave, while age, gender, and the

245

presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome and chronic neurological diseases were associated

246

with mortality in the second. This might be a reflection of a better management of cancer or

247

diabetes patients. On the other hand, the association of neurological diseases with mortality might

248

be due to the higher mean age of those who died in this second wave.

249

Conclusion

250

The results of the present study show that hospitalized patients in the second wave were

251

younger, required fewer days of hospitalization, had lower mortality rates and treatments were more

252

effective and less intensive. Although the majority of symptoms were similar in both periods, the

253

higher incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms in the second wave stands out as a difference.

254

Comorbidities were similar, but there were differences between those associated with mortality,

255

highlighting the importance of chronic neurological diseases in this second wave. An important

256

difference was the high incidence of babies, children and pregnant and post-partum women

257

admitted but, in general, these cases were not serious and were resolved promptly and successfully.

258

These results might help to understand the characteristics of this second wave and the behaviour

259

and danger of SARS-CoV-2 in the Mediterranean area and in Western Europe generally. Further

260

studies are needed to confirm our findings.
