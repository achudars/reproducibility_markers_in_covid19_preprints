Abstract
Since the first identified individual of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection on Jan 20, 2020
in South Korea, the number of confirmed cases rapidly increased. As of Feb 26, 2020, 1,261 cases of
COVID-19 including 12 deaths were confirmed in South Korea. Using the incidence data of COVID19, we estimate the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6), which indicates sustained
transmission and support the implementation of social distancing measures to rapidly control the
outbreak.

A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged out of the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019
has already demonstrated its potential to generate explosive outbreaks in confined settings and cross
borders following human mobility patterns (1). While COVID-19 frequently induces mild symptoms
common to other respiratory infections, it has also exhibited an ability to generate severe disease among
certain groups including older populations and individuals with underlying health issues such as
cardiovascular disease and diabetes (2). Nevertheless, a clear picture of the epidemiology of this novel
coronavirus is still being elucidated.
The number of cases of COVID-19 in the province of Hubei, the disease epicenter, quickly climbed
following an exponential growth trend. The total number of COVID-19 cases is at 81,109 including
2718 deaths in China as of February 26, 2020 (3). Fortunately, by February 15, 2020 the daily number
of new reported cases in China started to decline across the country although Hubei Province is still
reporting hundreds of cases per day as of February 26th, 2020 (3). While the epidemic continues to
decline in China, more than 2,900 COVID-19 cases have been reported in 37 countries outside of China
including South Korea, Japan, Italy, Iran, Singapore, U.S., and Thailand (3). In particular, South Korea
has quickly become the second hardest hit country with COVID-19, with steadily increasing number of
cases over the last few days. Hence, it is crucial to monitor the progression of these outbreaks and assess
the effects of various public health measures including the social distancing measures in real time.
The first case in South Korea was identified on January 20, 2020 followed by the detection of one or
two cases on average in the subsequent days. However, the number of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV2 infection started to increase rapidly on February 19, 2020 with a total of 1,261 confirmed COVID-19
cases including twelve deaths reported as of February 26, 2020 according to the Korea Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) (4). The epicenter of the South Korean COVID-19 outbreak
has been identified in Daegu, a city of 2.5 million people, approximately 150 miles South East of Seoul.
The rapid spread of COVID-19 in South Korea has been attributed one case linked to a superspreading
event that has led to at least 40 secondary cases stemming from church services in the city of Daegu (5,
6). This has led to sustained transmission chains of COVID-19, with about 52% of the cases associated
with the church cluster in Daegu (7). Moreover, three other clusters have been reported including one
set in Chundo Daenam hospital in Chungdo-gun, Gyeongsanggbuk-do (114 cases), one Pilgrimage to
Israel cluster in Gyeongsanggbuk-do (31 cases) and a cluster A composed of one imported and 11 local
cases in Seoul. These few clusters have become the major driving force of the infection. A total of 33
cases were imported while the three major clusters are composed of local cases as described in
Supplementary Table S1.
Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Korea has been exacerbated by amplified transmission in confined
settings including a hospital and a church in the city of Daegu. The hospital-based outbreak alone
involves 114 individuals including 9 hospital staff (8), which is reminiscent of past outbreaks of SARS

and MERS (9). To respond to the mounting number of cases of COVID-19, the Korean government has
raised the COVID-19 alert level to the highest (Level 4) to facilitate the implementation of social
distancing measures including enhanced infection control measures in hospitals, restricting public
transportation, cancelling social events, and delaying the start of school activities in order to contain the
outbreak (10).
The effective reproduction number (Rt) quantifies the time-dependent transmission potential of an
infectious diseases outbreak. This key epidemiological parameter tracks the average number of
secondary cases generated per case as the outbreak progresses over time. Steady values of Rt above 1
indicate sustained disease transmission, whereas values of Rt <1 do not support sustained transmission
and the number of new cases is expected to follow a declining trend. In this report, using a mathematical
model parameterized with cases series of the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea, we investigate the
transmission potential of COVID-19 in Korea using data of local and imported cases up until February
26, 2020.
Methods
Data
We obtained the daily series of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea from January 20, 2020
to February, 26, 2020 that are publicly available from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (KCDC) (4). Our data includes the dates of reporting for all confirmed cases, the dates of
symptom onsets for the first 28 reported cases, and whether the case is autochthonous (local
transmission) or imported. We also summarize the case clusters comprising one or more cases according
to the source of infection according to the field investigations conducted by the KCDC (4). Accordingly,
four major clusters were identified.
Imputing the date of onset
To estimate the growth rate of the epidemic, it is ideal to characterize the epidemic curve according to
dates of symptoms onset rather than according to dates of reporting. For the COVID-19 data in Korea,
the symptom onset dates are available for only the first 28 reported cases. Moreover, all of the dates of
symptoms onset are available for the imported cases. Therefore, we utilize this empirical distribution
of reporting delays from the onset to diagnosis to impute the missing dates of onset for the remainder
of the cases with missing data. For this purpose, we reconstruct 300 epidemic curves by dates of
symptoms onset from which we derived a mean incidence curve of local case incidence and drop the
last three data points from the analysis to adjust for reporting delays in our real-time analysis (11).

Estimate of reproduction number from daily case incidence
We assess the effective reproduction number, 𝑅𝑡 , which quantifies the time dependent variations in the
average number of secondary cases generated per case during the course of an outbreak due to intrinsic
factors (decline in susceptible individuals) and extrinsic factors (behavior changes, cultural factors, and
the implementation of public health measures) (9, 12, 13). Using the Korean incidence curves for
imported and local cases, we estimate the evolution of Rt for COVID-19 in Korea. First, we characterize
daily local case incidence using the generalized growth model (GGM) (14). This model characterizes
the growth profile via two parameters: the growth rate parameter (𝑟) and the scaling of the growth rate
parameter (𝑝). The model captures diverse epidemic profiles ranging from constant incidence (𝑝 = 0),
sub-exponential or polynomial growth ( 0 < 𝑝 < 1 ), and exponential growth ( 𝑝 = 1 ) (14). The
generation interval is assumed to follow a gamma distribution with a mean of 4.41 days and a standard
deviation of 3.17 days (15, 16).
Next, to estimate the most recent estimate of Rt, we simulate the progression of incident cases from
GGM, and apply the discretized probability distribution (𝜌𝑖 ) of the generation interval using the
renewal equation (17-19) given by
𝑅𝑡𝑖 =

𝐼𝑖
∑𝑖𝑗=0(𝐼𝑖−𝑗 +𝛼 𝐽𝑖−𝑗 )𝜌𝑖

.

In the renewal equation we denote the local incidence at calendar time 𝑡𝑖 by 𝐼𝑖 , and the raw incidence
of imported cases at calendar time 𝑡𝑖 by 𝐽𝑖 . The parameter 0 ≤ 𝛼 ≤ 1 quantifies the relative
contribution of imported cases to the secondary disease transmission (20). The denominator represents
the total number of cases that contribute to the incidence cases at time 𝑡𝑖 . Next, we estimate 𝑅𝑡 for
300 simulated curves assuming a Poisson error structure to derive the uncertainty bounds around the
curve of 𝑅𝑡 (21).

Results
Reconstructed incidence of COVID-19
The reconstructed daily incidence curve of COVID-19 after the imputing the onset dates for the Korean
cases is shown in Figure 1. Between January 20 and February 18, 2020 an average of 2 new cases were
reported each day, whereas between February 19- 26, 2020, 153 new cases were reported each day on
average.
Effective reproduction number (𝑹𝒕 ) from daily case incidence
Under the empirical reporting delay distribution from Korean cases with available dates of onset, the
intrinsic growth rate (r) was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.5, 0.7) and the scaling of growth parameter (p)

was estimated at 0.76 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.79), indicating sub-exponential growth dynamics of COVID-19
in Korea (Figure 2, Table 1). The mean reproduction number 𝑅𝑡 was estimated at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4,
1.6). Our estimates of 𝑅𝑡 are not sensitive to the changes to the parameter that modulates the
contribution of the imported cases to transmission (𝛼).

Transmission clusters
Spatial distribution of the Korean clusters is shown in Figure 3 and the characteristics of each cluster
are presented in Table 1.
Shincheonji Church of Jesus cluster
As of February 26, 2020, 597 (or 47%) of the country's 1261 confirmed cases of COVID-19 are linked
to this cluster, according to the KCDC (4). This largest cluster is associated with Shincheonji Church
of Jesus, with the first case (the 31st patient in the country) confirmed on Feb. 18. It is unclear how this
case contracted the illness, as she does not present a recent history of travel or contact with another
infected patient. However, this case attended Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu four times before
and after becoming a symptomatic case of COVID-19, and visited the hospital in Cheongdo after a car
accident. According to the KCDC, the patient had contact with 166 people mostly at Shincheonji Church
and the hospital in Cheongdo, who now placed themselves into self-quarantine. The Shincheonji church
of Jesus has temporarily closed its facilities and halted the church activities as of February 18, 2020.
Pilgrimage tour to Israel related
A total of 31 infected cases belonging to a group of 39 Catholic pilgrims who visited Israel between
February 8, 2020 and February 16, 2020 were confirmed for COVID-19 (22). Amongst these, 11
individuals were diagnosed on February 17, 2020, while 20 others were confirmed positive between
February 21-25, 2020 and quarantined immediately. Of the 31 infected pilgrims, 19 belong to the
Euiseong County, North Gyeongsang Province, while one patient, a tour guide belongs to Seoul. Health

authorities have traced 170 contacts from these 29 cases, raising concerns about the potential risk of
secondary infections.
Chungdo Daenam hospital cluster
This cluster comprised of 114 local cases and five deaths is associated with Chungdo Daenam hospital,
where South Korea's first coronavirus associated case fatality occurred. Of the 114 cases, 92 were
confirmed on Feb 22, 2020 (4). A 63-year-old man who died of pneumonia at the hospital on Feb 19
was posthumously tested positive for COVID-19. On Feb 21, another patient at Daenam Hospital died
from COVID-19, followed by another death on Feb 23. The confirmed cases were mainly from
psychiatric ward and includes nine medical staffs. The exact route of the infection is not yet known.
Cluster A
This cluster is composed of one imported case and 12 local cases, and was identified with its first case
(the 3rd patient in the country) confirmed on Jan 26, 2020. Its first case is suspected to be an imported
case from Wuhan, China, transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to the 6th and 28th confirmed cases in Korea, which
resulted in secondary cases. No further cases have been added in this cluster since February 21, 2020.
Discussion
This is the first study to report estimates of the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Korea based on
the trajectory of the epidemic, which was reconstructed by using the dates of onset of the first reported
cases in Korea. The estimates of R clearly indicate sustained transmission of the novel coronavirus in
Korea. Moreover, the imported cases contribute little to the secondary disease transmission in Korea,
as majority of these cases occurred in the early phase of the epidemic, with the most recent imported
case reported on February 9, 2020. These findings support the range of social distancing interventions
that the Korean government put in place in order to bring the outbreak under control as soon as possible.
Our estimates of the reproduction number can be compared with earlier estimates reported for the
epidemic in China where the estimates of R lie in the range 2-7.1 (1, 23-29). Moreover, the mean R
reached values as high as ~11 for the outbreak that unfolded aboard the Princess Cruises Ship during
January-February 2020 (30). In contrast, a recent study on Singapore’s COVID-19 transmission
dynamics reported lower estimates for 𝑅𝑡 (1.1, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.3) as of February 19th, 2020, reflecting
a significant impact of the control interventions that have been implemented in Singapore (31). The
estimates of the scaling of growth parameter (p) in our study indicate sub-exponential growth dynamics
of COVID-19 in Korea. This aligns well with the sub-exponential growth patterns of COVID-19 in
Singapore and all Chinese provinces except Hubei (31, 32).

Since the first COVID-19 case was reported on January 20, 2020, the epidemic’s trajectory showed a
rapid upturn until February 18, 2020, when a super spreader (Case 31) was identified in the Shincheonji
Church of Jesus in Daegu cluster. Since then, Korea's confirmed cases have risen tremendously. In fact,
80 percent of confirmed cases are linked to the two clusters of infections, i.e. Shincheonji Church of
Jesus in Daegu and Chungdo Daenam hospital (33). Such superspreading events have been reported for
the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea (34). Amplification of MERS in the hospital setting has been
associated with diagnostic delays, which increase the window of opportunity for the generation of
secondary cases (9). This underscores the need for rapid testing, case detection and active contact
tracing to isolate infectious individuals.
Beyond Korea, substantial COVID-19 transmission has been reported in Singapore, Iran, Italy,
Germany and aboard the Diamond cruise ship (35, 36). While the cluster A and the Chungdo Daenam
hospital cluster in Korea seem to have stabilized, the other two clusters are likely to keep growing in
the short term. Public health authorities are currently focused on containing the outbreak in the city of
Daegu, the epicenter of the outbreak and North Gyeongsang Province where active contact tracing is
being conducted. Nation-wide preventative measures are expected to reduce the community
transmission and ultimately bring 𝑅𝑡 below one.

Conclusion
This is the first study to estimate the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Korea. Our current findings
suggest sustained disease transmission in the region. Our estimates support the implementation of a
wide array of social distancing measures to rapidly contain the outbreak in Korea.
