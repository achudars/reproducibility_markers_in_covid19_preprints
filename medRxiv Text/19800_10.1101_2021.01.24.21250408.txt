Abstract
To ensure the safe operation of schools, workplaces, nursing homes, and other businesses
during COVID-19 pandemic there is an urgent need to develop cost-effective public health
strategies. Here we focus on the cruise industry which was hit early by the COVID-19 pandemic,
with more than 40 cruise ships reporting COVID-19 infections. We apply mathematical
modeling to assess the impact of testing strategies together with social distancing protocols on
the spread of the novel coronavirus during ocean cruises using an individual-level stochastic
model of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We model the contact network, the potential
importation of cases arising during shore excursions, the temporal course of infectivity at the
individual level, the effects of social distancing strategies, different testing scenarios
characterized by the test’s sensitivity profile, and the testing frequency. Our findings indicate
that PCR testing at embarkation and daily testing of all individuals aboard, together with
increased social distancing and other public health measures, should allow for rapid detection
and isolation of COVID-19 infections and dramatically reducing the probability of onboard
COVID-19 community spread. In contrast, relying only on PCR testing at embarkation would not
be sufficient to avert outbreaks, even when implementing substantial levels of social distancing
measures.

Introduction
Since the first human infections of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) were reported in
Wuhan, China in December 2019, the novel pathogen has reached every corner of the world
and continues its unrelentless global march with more than 95.6 million reported cases
including over 2 million related deaths by January 19th, 2021 1. The novel coronavirus has
spread with significant geographical distinction at different spatial scales around the world. In
the United States, a total of 24.1 million COVID-19 cases including more than 400,000 deaths
have been reported thus far 1. Although safe and effective vaccines are becoming a reality in an
unprecedented time scale, it will take months before a substantial fraction of the world
population is immunized.
SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible and deadly respiratory virus that readily spreads via
droplets and aerosols especially in confined settings 2,3. In fact, an early hotspot of the novel
coronavirus outside mainland China unfolded aboard the Diamond Princess Cruise ship with
2,666 passengers and 1,045 crew members. This unfortunate COVID-19 outbreak shed early
light on the clinical and epidemiological features of this novel coronavirus 4-6. In particular, the
outbreak on the Diamond Princess Cruise ship highlighted a substantial frequency of
asymptomatic infections which need to be rapidly isolated in order to halt transmission chains
4
.
Because the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly disrupted economic growth, there is an urgent
need to develop cost-effective public health strategies that allow safe operation of schools,
workplaces, nursing homes, and other businesses 7-9. In this paper our focus is the cruise
industry which was hit early by the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 40 cruise ships
reporting COVID-19 infections 10,11. This form of leisure travel has undergone rapid growth in
recent years including a substantial increase in ship size and passenger capacity 12. According to
the Cruise Line International Association report, the total number of cruise passengers
increased from 17.8 million in 2009 to 26.7 million in 2017 and was projected to increase to 30
million in 2019 13.
Multiple infectious disease outbreaks have been linked to cruise ships 14,15. A cruise ship mimics
a virtual travelling city bringing together a large number of people from different backgrounds,
culture, and health status 16,17. The interaction of passengers and crew in close proximity in
often crowded, semi-enclosed environments such as dining halls and recreational rooms create
a unique environment that facilitates the transmission of person-to-person, food borne or
water borne diseases 14. Some earlier outbreaks of respiratory illness involving cruise ships
include an influenza outbreak that occurred in May 2009 where 3% of passengers and crew
were infected with A/H1N1 influenza, 3.6% with A/H3N2, and 0.1% with both strains 18.
Another influenza B outbreak was documented on a cruise ship off the Sao Paulo coast in Brazil
in February 2012 19. Similarly, outbreaks of acute respiratory illness were reported in two cruise
ships affecting 3.7% and 6.2% of the passengers, respectively, between March 15 and April 5 in
2014 20.

There is a need to devise public health strategies to ensure safe transportation of passengers
and crew across different transportation modalities and geographic distances. Indeed,
international travel through cruise ships can have significant impact on the transmission and
global spread of infectious disease. In the absence of appropriate screening and control
measures, infectious individuals who disembark from ships and use multiple transportation
means including trains, buses, and international flights can in turn transmit the disease to other
people. Additionally, the average passenger on a cruise ship tends to be older and is at
heightened risk of severe symptoms and complications from COVID-19 infection 21. According
to a prospective study, the average age of passengers who sought medical attention in 86
cruises of a ship in three years, was 72.6 years 22. In the Diamond Princess Cruise ship, out of
total 3,711 people aboard on 5th February 2020, 58.5% were aged 60 years and above, with
33.4% of the individuals aged 70-99 years 23. Therefore, ensuring the safety of passengers and
the crew aboard cruise ships as well as the local communities that host them is the highest
priority of the cruise industry before operations are restarted 24,25. To that end, some cruise
companies have started to install PCR laboratories aboard their ships with capacity for daily
testing of every crew member and guest 26.
In this study, we apply mathematical modeling to assess the impact of testing strategies
together with social distancing protocols on the spread of the novel coronavirus during ocean
cruises using an individual-level stochastic model of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.
We model the contact network of the population of interest and the potential importation of
cases arising during shore excursions, our understanding of the temporal course of infectivity at
the individual level as well as the effects of social distancing strategies and different testing
scenarios characterized by the sensitivity profile of the test and testing frequency.
Our modeling results indicate that PCR testing at embarkation and daily testing of all individuals
aboard, together with increased social distancing and other public health measures, should
allow for rapid detection and isolation of COVID-19 infections before they infect others,
significantly reducing the onboard COVID-19 community spread. Our results support a daily PCR
testing strategy in order to minimize the number of infections irrespective of the duration of
the cruise, allowing cruises longer than 7 days. By contrast, a strategy that relies on PCR testing
at embarkation would not be sufficient to avert outbreaks, even when substantial levels of
social distancing measures are implemented.

Methods
Model description
Model description
We developed an individual-level stochastic model to investigate the role of testing and social
distancing protocols for preventing COVID-19 outbreaks during ocean cruises that include daily
shore excursions. For this purpose, we model transmission dynamics in a highly connected
social contact network and calibrate the baseline transmission rate based on estimates derived
from the COVID-19 outbreak that unfolded aboard the Diamond Princess Cruise ship in
February 2020 4. Further, our model incorporates uncertainty in the individual-level infectivity
profile, which is informed by published data, the role of social distancing measures for
mitigating the transmission probability per contact, potential exposure during daily shore
excursions based on a local community prevalence, and the uncertainty associated with the
sensitivity profile of the PCR test utilized in different testing scenarios.
Through global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis and using 200 stochastic simulations for
each combination of parameter values, we summarized our findings in terms of the cumulative
number of cases occurring during the duration of the cruise for scenarios with and without the
implementation of interventions. A detailed description of the different model components is
provided below.

Transmission Dynamics and Infectivity Profile

In the absence of interventions, susceptible individuals in contact with infectious individuals
become infected with a probability that depends on an infectivity level of each infectious
contact that varies according to the age of infection and a scaling factor that modulates
transmission rate according to the basic reproduction number R0. The infectivity of infectious
individuals varies according to their age of infection which progresses on daily time steps
(Figure 1). Thus, for a 14-day infectious period, there are 14 different infectivity values for each
infectious individual. All infectious individuals recover and become protected at the end of their
infectious period.
Asymptomatic transmission is a key characteristic of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19
outbreaks 27. Therefore, it is crucial to rapidly identify infected individuals irrespective of the
presence of symptoms. While we do not distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic
individuals in our model, we track and model the uncertainty in the temporal infectiousness
profile for each infected individual. For this purpose, we approximate the COVID-19 infectivity
profile following a gamma distribution function informed by published data 28,29. Specifically,
we assume that the infectious period is up to 14 days long, but the timing of peak infectivity for
each individual varies randomly and occurs 5, 6, or 7 days post infection as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. The timing of peak infectivity for each individual varies randomly, peaking at 5 (red
d
curve),6 (blue curve), or 7 (green curve) days post infection according to a gamma distribution.
We do not distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.
Individual contact network

We model a highly connected network of contacts among passengers and crew aboard the
vessel to capture a well-mixed population in a confined setting. For this purpose, the baseline
contact network of 1395 individuals including passengers and crew is conservatively modeled
according to a small world network where each individual has an average of 100 contacts
during the duration of the cruise itinerary (i.e., small world network parameter K=50) with a
rewiring probability p set at 0.1 30. The resulting small world network has a low average path
length and significant clustering compared to its random network counterpart. Further, the
links of the network do not change during the entire duration of the simulation. The baseline
contact network is depicted in Figure 2. In sensitivity analyses, we also consider a bigger ship
with capacity of 6000 (4000 passengers and 2000 crew).

individuals, and the lines represent fixed contacts between individuals.
The basic reproduction number on board the vessel (R0(ship))

The basic reproduction number denoted by R0 quantifies the average number of secondary
cases generated by a primary infectious during his/her infectious period in the absence of
interventions during the early stages of an outbreak 31. In line with published studies of the
early transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak that unfolded aboard the Diamond
Princess Cruise ship in early 2020 5,32, we calibrated our transmission model with a baseline
average basic reproduction number aboard the cruise ship denoted by R0(ship) at 12, but vary
this value in the range between 9 and 16 in sensitivity analyses.
COVID-19 Test characteristics

We model testing strategies based on PCR tests with a sensitivity profile that is modeled using a
logistic growth function that reaches maximum sensitivity 5-7 days post infection followed by a
symmetric logistic decline function. Further, we vary peak test sensitivity from 85% to 95% in
n
sensitivity analyses (Figure 3).

Social distancing protocols

The overall effect of public health measures during the duration of the cruises (including during
shore excursions) is modeled as a proportionate reduction in the transmission rate by a scaling
factor. These public health measures include frequent sanitation of surfaces, mandatory
wearing of mask on board for passengers and crew, physical distancing protocols, air purifiers,
and UV lights in all air handling units 33-36. Hence, the combined effect of these public health
measures are assumed to reduce the transmission probability per contact in the range of 5090% with a conservative baseline level at 60%.

Testing strategies

In addition to social distancing measures, we evaluate the impact of two different testing
protocols on the cumulative number of cases that occur during the cruise duration:
•

•

PCR Testing of passengers prior to embarkation. All of the individuals are tested prior

to embarkation, and positive individuals are not allowed to board the ship. The
probability of a positive individual boarding the ship depends on the age of his/her
infection as well as the temporal sensitivity profile of the test. Hence, the probability of
a false-negative test result is not negligible 37,38. Indeed, even PCR tests are unlikely to
detect very recent infections. Infected individuals that are detected prior to
embarkation do not contribute to the transmission dynamics during the cruise itinerary.

PCR Testing of passengers prior to embarkation and daily testing on board. In addition
to testing all passengers prior to embarkation, all individuals on board the ship are
tested every day with a PCR test. We assume that test results become available within
hours and positive cases are effectively isolated and do not contribute to generating
further infections on board the ship.

Prior immunity

For simplicity we assume that all of the individuals on board the cruise are equally susceptible
to catching the novel coronavirus. Thus, we model here conservative scenarios since the
potential role of prior immunity from past infection or vaccination campaigns is not considered
in our analyses.

Initial conditions

The initial number of infected passengers before the cruise starts depends on the local
community prevalence with a baseline value at 1% which we vary in the range: 0.3-3% in
sensitivity analyses. Specifically, the initial number of COVID-19 infected passengers is drawn
from a binomial probability distribution based on the community prevalence value and the
number of passengers boarding the ship. Moreover, all crew members are initially assumed to
be susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the age of the infection of initially
infected individuals at embarkation varies randomly between 0 and 14 days.
Daily importation rate from shore excursions

We also consider the possibility that passengers may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during daily
excursions on shore. For each day of the cruise duration, the number of infected passengers
during the shore expedition depends on the current number of susceptible passengers, the
local reproduction number on shore denoted by R0(shore) which is assumed to vary between 0.6
and 1.6, the local COVID-19 prevalence level, the amount of time that passengers spend on
shore excursions (about 6 hours) as well as the extent of public health measures in place during
these activities (e.g., facemask wearing, hand hygiene). Hence, the number of passengers
infected during shore excursions could fluctuate on a daily basis depending on the
epidemiological state of the individual passengers. Here we assume the same local prevalence
during embarkation and during daily shore excursions (range: 0.3-3%). Figure 4 illustrates the
average daily number of infected individuals from shore excursions as a function of the local
prevalence and the extent of public health measures which we quantify as a proportionate
reduction between 50% and 90% in the transmission rate. This is likely a conservative range
that reflects the combined impact of mandatory facemask wearing for passengers, physical
distancing protocols during the excursion, buses sanitation, limiting of high-risk shore excursion
programs and of self-exploration of the destination 34,36.

Figure 4. Illustration of the average daily number of infected individuals from shore excursions
(shorex) as a function of the local prevalence and the extent of public health measures (e.g.,
facemask wearing). The number of infected passengers arising from daily shore expeditions
depends on the number of susceptible passengers, the local reproduction number R0(shore),
the local COVID-19 prevalence level, the amount of time that passengers spend on shore
excursions (about 6 hours) as well as the extent of public health measures in place (e.g.,
facemask wearing). Here R0(shore) = 1.0. The extent of public health are modeled as a
proportionate reduction in the transmission probability per contact which is assumed to vary
from 50% to 90%. This is likely a conservative range that reflects the combined impact of
enhanced surface sanitation, mandatory facemask wearing on board for passengers and crew,
physical distancing protocols, air purifiers, and UV lights in all air handling units.
Global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses

To account for various model uncertainties including the epidemiology of the novel
coronavirus, the characteristics of the cruises (duration, local prevalence) as well as the
characteristics of the test on our modeling results (Table 1), we relied on global uncertainty and
sensitivity analyses. Specifically, we performed global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to
quantify the effect of changes in the model parameters on the cumulative number of cases
during the cruise. For sensitivity analyses, we rank model parameters according to the size of
their effect on the total cases that occur during the duration of the cruise using partial rank
correlation coefficients (PRCC)39. The larger the partial rank correlation coefficient, the larger
the influence of the input parameter on the cumulative number of cases. All of the input

•

In the absence of interventions, the average number of infections during a 7-day cruise
was estimated at 139.2 (95% CI: 43.8, 270) while the number of imported cases from
embarkation was estimated at 9.6 (95% CI: 4.0, 15). This result underscores the
substantial number of imported cases that lead to rapid growth in case numbers even
when the baseline COVID-19 prevalence in the general population is 1 COVID-19 case in
100 people.

•

In contrast, for the embarkation testing and public health measures scenario, we
estimated an average of 14.9 cases (95% CI:1, 39.0) during the cruise whereas the
number of imported cases from embarkation was estimated at 5.2 (95% CI: 1, 10).
Hence, the average number of case importations is only reduced from 9.6 cases in the
absence of interventions to an average of 5.2 cases. Indeed, embarkation testing may
not be able to detect all of the infected individuals prior to boarding especially those in
the early infection stages given our current understanding of the temporal sensitivity
profile in the PCR test (Figure 3).

•

For the scenario of embarkation testing and daily testing of all individuals, the number
of cases during the cruise is reduced to an average of 2.9 cases (95% CI:0, 8). In fact, the
stochastic simulation curves of the daily cumulative number of cases across the three
scenarios indicate that the strategy that tests during embarkation together with daily
testing of all individuals is the only strategy that rapidly flattens the growth trend in case
numbers (Figure 6). This strategy greatly diminishes the probability that an infectious
individual transmits the virus to other individuals aboard the vessel. While embarkation
testing may not be able to detect all of the infected individuals prior to boarding, the
great majority of infected individuals that are not detected during embarkation are
likely to be identified soon after embarkation through daily testing strategies.

Results from uncertainty and sensitivity analyses

In the absence of interventions: our results from the global uncertainty analyses after
considering the uncertainty ranges for each parameter (Table 1) indicate that the average
number of imported cases from embarkation is at 15 (95% CI:2, 32) while the average number
of cases during the cruise including any cases during shore excursions (shorex) is 470 (95%
CI:19, 1300). Furthermore, results from sensitivity analyses (Table 2 and Figure 7) indicate that
the case load at the end of the cruise was most sensitive to the following parameters:
• The local community prevalence. This parameter is strongly correlated with the
expected number of infected individuals boarding the vessel. Each infected individual
that boards the vessel initiates a rapidly growing transmission chain given the high basic
reproduction associated with the cruise environment.
• The duration of the cruise. This parameter directly modulates the time window during
which susceptible may become exposed to infectious individuals on aboard the vessel.
The basic reproduction number aboard the ship, R0(ship). This parameter is related to
the likelihood that an infectious individual transmits the coronavirus to other individuals
on aboard.

Figure 7. These scatter plots display the relationship between the model parameters and the
average number of infections in the absence of testing strategies and public health measures.
Partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCC) and their statistical significance (P value) after
considering the uncertainty ranges for each parameter (Table 1) are also shown. Local
prevalence and the length of the cruise are strongly and positively correlated with the expected
number of cases at the end of the simulations. The basic reproduction number aboard the ship
is also correlated with the average number of cases.

Embarkation testing and social distancing interventions. For the scenario that considers

testing during embarkation together with public health measures, our results from the global
uncertainty analyses indicate that the average number of imported cases from embarkation is
at 9.6 (95% CI:1, 21) while the average number of cases during the cruise including any shorex
cases is 45 (95% CI: 0, 260). Furthermore, results from sensitivity analyses (Table 2 and Figure 8)
indicate that for this scenario the case load at the end of the cruise was most sensitive to the
following parameters:
• The local prevalence. Higher local prevalence levels increase the expected number of
infected individuals boarding the vessel even when embarkation testing mitigates the
number of infected individuals that make it aboard.
• The length of the cruise. Once an infected individual makes it aboard the vessel, the
longer the duration of the cruise, the longer the time window during which susceptible
individuals could be become exposed to infectious individuals aboard the vessel.
• The extent of public health measures. The transmission rate is mitigated proportionately
by the level of public health measures, but it is unlikely to be reduced to zero.

Figure 8. These scatter plots display the relationship between the model parameters and the
average number of infections in the context of embarkation testing and public health measures.
Partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCC) and their statistical significance (P value) after
considering the uncertainty ranges for each parameter (Table 1) are also shown. Local
prevalence, the extent of public health measures and the length of the cruise are highly and
positively correlated with the expected number of cases at the end of the simulations. The basic

reproduction number aboard the ship is only weakly correlated with the average number of
cases.

Embarkation and daily testing + social distancing interventions: For the scenario that
considers testing during embarkation and daily testing of all individuals together with public
health measures, our results from the global uncertainty analyses indicate that the average
number of imported cases from embarkation is at 9.6 (95% CI:1, 21) while the average number
of cases during the cruise including any shorex cases is 4.7 (95% CI:0,16). Furthermore, results
from sensitivity analyses (Table 2 and figure 9) indicate that for this scenario the case load at
the end of the cruise was most sensitive to the following parameters:
• The local prevalence. Embarkation testing and daily testing greatly mitigate the average
number of cases occurring on board the vessel compared to embarkation testing only
(Figure 8). Yet, the number of cases during the cruise is still correlated with the local
prevalence level.
• The extent of public health measures. The transmission rate during the cruise is
negatively correlated with the extent of public health measures.
It is worth noting that compared to embarkation testing only, the length of the cruise does not
play an important role in the average number cases expected during the cruise in this scenario.

with the expected number of cases at the end of the simulations. The basic reproduction

Discussion
Using an individual-level stochastic transmission model parameterized for COVID-19
transmission dynamics, we find that the implementation of PCR testing during embarkation and
daily testing of all individuals aboard together with social distancing measures can greatly
mitigate the number of cases during cruises for a wide range of parameter uncertainty related
to the epidemiology of the novel coronavirus, PCR test characteristics relating to the sensitivity
profile, and the conditions surrounding the operation of the cruises (local prevalence and cruise
duration). Importantly, our findings also indicate that testing during embarkation is not
sufficient to avert outbreaks even when moderate levels of social distancing measures are
considered 37. Daily testing is key to minimize the number of infections irrespective of the
duration of the cruise.
Cumulative incidence from the baseline model without considering the effects of interventions
are significantly sensitive to variations in the local community prevalence (0.3-3%), the duration
of the cruise ship (4-14 days), and the basic reproduction number aboard the cruise ship (9-16).
For intervention scenarios incorporating testing strategies and social distancing, cumulative
cases are most sensitive to the variation in local prevalence and the extent of social distancing

measures (50-90%). Importantly, cumulative cases were not significantly sensitive to the
variation assumed in the characteristics of the test sensitivity profile (Table 1).
The role of mathematical modeling has been instrumental in our current understanding of the
transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Mathematical models have been employed in several
previous studies to understand the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions to the
control of SARS-CoV-2 in the Cruise ship setting such as Diamond Princess Cruise ship 32,40-42.
While some of the previous studies have used the compartmental models that are limited in
representing the full heterogeneity of contact patterns of people aboard 32,40, others that have
employed the contact network models have not assessed the role of testing strategies in
preventing COVID-19 outbreaks during the ocean cruise that involve shore excursions 41,42.
Our analysis is not exempt of limitations. First, there is still much uncertainty surrounding the
full spectrum of infectiousness profiles in the population and additional data may prove useful
to further refine this model component. Second, the contact network of all the individuals
aboard the cruise ship was modeled following the small world network paradigm which
provides a reasonable approximation to social interactions 30. Real-time collection of data on
contacts occurring during cruises should help define a more accurate characterization of the
contact dynamics that occur between crew members and passengers. Third, we model
conservative scenarios since we do not account for potential effects arising from prior
immunity shaped by past infections or vaccination campaigns. As COVID-19 vaccination
campaigns are launched around the world, future studies could evaluate their impact on
transmission dynamics.

(shorex) as a function of the local prevalence and the extent of public health measures (e.g.,

depends on the number of susceptible passengers, the local reproduction number R0(shore),
the local COVID-19 prevalence level, the amount of time that passengers spend on shore
excursions (about 6 hours) as well as the extent of public health measures in place (e.g.,
facemask wearing). Here R0(shore) = 1.0. The extent of public health are modeled as a
proportionate reduction in the transmission probability per contact which is assumed to vary
from 50% to 90%. This is likely a conservative range that reflects the combined impact of
enhanced surface sanitation, mandatory facemask wearing on board for passengers and crew,
physical distancing protocols, air purifiers, and UV lights in all air handling units.
