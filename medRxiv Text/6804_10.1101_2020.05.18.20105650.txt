ABSTRACT

32

Background

33

Lopinavir/ritonavir has been proposed as off-label treatment for Covid-19, although efficacy have

34

not been proven. It has previously been shown that lopinavir plasma concentration is dramatically

35

increased in inflammatory settings. As Covid-19 may be associated with major inflammation,

36

assessing lopinavir plasma concentration and its safety in Covid-19 patients is essential.

37

Methods

38

Real-world Covid-19 experience based on a retrospective study.

39

Results

40

Of 31 patients treated by lopinavir/ritonavir for Covid-19, we observed very high lopinavir

41

plasma concentrations, increased of 4.6-fold (IQR, 3.6-6.2) with regards to average plasma

42

concentrations in HIV. All except one patient were above the upper limit of the concentration

43

ranges of HIV treatment. About one over four to five patients prematurely stopped treatment

44

mainly secondary an adverse drug reaction related to hepatic or gastrointestinal disorders.

45

Conclusion

46

Lopinavir plasma concentrations in patients with moderate to severe Covid-19 were higher than

47

expected, associated with the occurrence of hepatic or gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions.

48

However, owing that high plasma concentration may be required for in vivo antiviral activity

49

against SARS-CoV-2 as suggested by previous studies, it appears that, in the absence of adverse

50

drug reaction, lopinavir dosage should not be reduced. Cautious is necessary as off-label use can

51

be associated with a new drug safety profile.

INTRODUCTION

56

Since early December 2019, a pandemic infectious disease due to a novel coronavirus, namely

57

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is spreading all over the world.

58

To date, no specific therapeutic agent has proven its clinical efficacy against this outbreak.

59

However, due to the urgent need for a treatment, several antiviral drugs are being used off-label,

60

including lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r).1 LPV is a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease

61

inhibitor approved since many years. LPV is prescribed in HIV in association with another

62

protease inhibitor, ritonavir (RTV), used as a potent P450 cytochrome (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor in

63

order to dramatically increase LPV plasma exposure.2 LPV/r has been proposed in previous

64

coronavirus outbreaks in 2003 and 2012 due to SARS-CoV-1 and to Middle East respiratory

65

syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), respectively.3,4 It has also proven its potency to inhibit

66

SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro.5 Based on these results, this drug has been considered to be

67

potentially useful in patients with SARS-CoV-2. To date, LPV has been assessed in only one

68

randomized clinical trial in Covid-19, showing no benefit beyond standard care in critical

69

patients.6 No therapeutic drug monitoring was performed for LPV/r to assess an ideal drug

70

exposure.

71

This retrospective cohort aimed to assess LPV/r plasma concentration and its safety in SARS-

72

CoV-2 infection.

73
74

MATERIALS AND METHODS

75

Data were collected from routine care of Covid-19 patients from a single center setting (Cochin

76

Hospital, Paris). According to our local protocol at the time of the study, patients were eligible to

77

receive a seven to ten days LPV/r treatment as specific anti-Covid-19 therapy if they (i) had a

78

pneumonitis evocating a SARS-CoV-2 infection at CT scan and (ii) were requiring oxygen

79

(minimal flow rate 2-3 liters per minute). Patients with ARDS at admission and requiring

80

intubation were not included. Covid-19 was considered as confirmed or suspected if they had a

81

positive or negative PCR, respectively. LPV/r tablets were swallowed (not crushed) and

82

administration time was reported by nurses. Therapeutic drug monitoring was performed in a

83

routine care setting within the first three days of therapy. Plasma samples were considered as

84

peak (4 +/- 2 hours after drug intake) or trough (12 +/- 3 hours after drug intake). Plasma

85

concentrations of LPV and ritonavir were quantified with high-performance liquid

86

chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (Xevo TQD, Waters®), using BEH C18 analytical

87

column (1.7µm, 1.7µm, 50*2.1 mm, Waters, Saint-Quentin, France) and a mobile phase

88

composed of 60% of water (0.05 % formic acid, v/v) and 40% of methanol (0.05% formic acid,

89

v/v). LPV/r treatment safety was assessed in a routine care setting. Cases of suspected adverse

90

drug reaction were spontaneously notified to the Pharmacovigilance regional center. After case-

91

by-case assessment by a senior pharmacologist, cases were reported to the French

92

pharmacovigilance system. The study has been performed in accordance with the declaration of

93

Helsinki and received approval by the Cochin Hospital Institutional Review Board (number

94

2020-08019).

96

RESULTS

97

We included 31 consecutive Covid-19 patients receiving LPV/r regimen between March 18th and

98

April 1st 2020. The median age of patients was 63 (interquartile range [IQR], 51-78) years and

99

71% were men (Table 1). Pulmonary injury at CT scan was mostly moderate to extensive. All

100

patients had a positive nasopharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 PCR, except four (12%) who had a

101

doubtful or negative result, contrasting with a typical chest CT scan. Median C-reactive protein

102

(CRP) and IL-6 levels at admission were 94.1 (45.4-176.0) mg/L and 60.4 (29.7-164.5) ng/mL.

103

LPV/r 400/100 mg in tablets twice a day was started within the first 48 hours after hospitalization

104

and median time to starting LPV/r after symptom onset was 8 (IQR, 7-10) days. No patient had a

105

detected drug-drug interaction involving RTV and 13 (42%) patients did not received

106

concomitant therapy. LPV/r treatment duration was 7 (IQR, 3-8) days. At the end of the LPV/r

107

course, 17 patients were still hospitalized with oxygen dependency, eight patients were

108

transferred to intensive care unit or died, five patients had recovered and clinical outcome was

109

unknown for one patient that has been transferred to another hospital during treatment.

110

A total of 24 patients were analyzed for therapeutic drug monitoring; plasma assays were not

111

available for three patients due to technical issues and four patients were excluded from analysis

112

because of sampling out of peak or trough timings. Median time for peak and trough blood

113

samples after tablet administration were 4,6 (IQR, 3,1-5,5) hours and 14,0 (IQR, 14,0-14,6)

114

hours, respectively. LPV plasma concentrations ranges from 8,317 to 35,012 ng/mL. Median

115

levels for peak (Cmax) and trough (Cmin) were 26,475 (IQR 11,952-33,868) ng/mL and 21,857

116

(IQR, 16,991-26,435) ng/mL, respectively (Figure 1A). All except one sampling were far above

117

the upper limit of the concentration ranges observed in HIV. Extent of LPV plasma concentration

118

was increased between 2 and 8-fold in the majority of the treated patients (Figure 1B). Magnitude

119

of increase was not associated with CRP or IL-6 levels (Figure 1C, 1D). At the time of LPV

120

assay ALT level was below 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in 20 (83%) patients and

121

between 2 and 8 ULN in 4 (17%) patients.

122

LPV/r was discontinued before the end of scheduled course for 14 (45%) patients (Table 1).

123

Reasons for early ending LPV/r therapy were the occurrence of adverse drug reaction (n=7,

124

22%), therapeutic limitation or patient deceased (n=4, 13%) and poor efficacy (n=3, 10%).

125

Suspected adverse drug reaction were assessed as probably related to LPV/r therapy. They

and six times above the upper limit of normal range and one case of isolated hyperbilirubinemia),

128

two cases of gastrointestinal disorders (nausea/vomiting and diarrhea) and one case of psychiatric

129

disorders (agitation/anxiety). These adverse drug reactions were mild and all patients recovered

130

after drug withdrawn.

131
132

DISCUSSION

133

Our findings show that LPV plasma concentrations in Covid-19 patients were very higher than

134

expected. Plasma concentrations were in median about 4.6-fold (IQR, 3.6-6.2) higher, and up to

135

8-fold higher, than therapeutic levels observed in HIV and far above the upper limit of the

136

concentration ranges in all except one patient.

137

Major inflammation associated with elevated levels of blood IL-6 and NFκB upregulation have

138

been largely reported in severe Covid-19 illness.7 Besides, it is long-standing known that

139

inflammatory responses and infections impair drug metabolism capacity.8 In animals and

140

humans, several studies or reports have shown the role of inflammation and IL-6 in CYP450

141

down-regulation through NF-κB activation, resulting in reducing drug metabolism.9,10 It has been

142

previously reported that voriconazole or tacrolimus, highly CYP3A4 dependent drugs had their

143

metabolism altered during inflammation. However, LPV is already associated with a highly

144

efficient cytochrome inhibitor, ritonavir. It is unknown whether metabolism can be further

145

blocked, and LPV concentrations increase through this mechanism. A prospective

146

pharmacokinetics study in HIV patients also found that total LPV concentrations varied with

147

inflammation and were correlated with circulating α1acid glycoprotein, a type 1 acute phase

148

protein.11 Noteworthy, unbound LPV concentration were minimally altered during inflammation

149

state suggesting a change in drug distribution rather than metabolism. In our analysis, we did not

150

found a correlation between lopinavir levels and CRP levels measured at patient admission.

151

Hence, it is likely that major inflammation in Covid-19 patients resulted in the dramatically

152

increased LPV plasma concentrations found in our study. However, it is unknown if this results

153

from a CYP3A4 reduced expression and another mechanism could be involved.

154

The main adverse drug reactions observed in this study were moderate hepatobiliary disorders

155

that have been attributed to LPV/r therapy. In HIV, moderate-to-severe elevations in serum

156

aminotransferase levels (>5 times the upper limit of normal) are found in 3% to 10% of

157

patients.12 These elevations are usually asymptomatic and can resolve even with drug

158

continuation. Drug causality could be hardly assessable in Covid-19 as up to 20% of the patients

159

have increased transaminases.13 However, in our study, transaminases quickly decreased after

160

stopping lopinavir, making drug causality probable. Furthermore, hepatobiliary disorders were

161

mainly cytolytic with a moderate increase in serum transaminases. No patient had hepatic failure

162

or dysfunction and it is not likely that these transient abnormal liver tests were associated with a

163

decrease in hepatic metabolic ability. Overall, adverse drug reactions reported in this Covid-19

164

study are in line with LPV/r safety profile.2 Even though, due to the relative limited number of

165

patients treated, conclusions are difficult to draw, physicians should be aware that drug off-label

166

use can be associated with an altered drug safety profile.14 The drug is used in a setting not

167

having been correctly assessed, that could led to an increase of adverse drug reactions and an

168

unfavorable risk-to-benefits ratio.15

169

Antiviral activity assays on cultured Vero-E6 cells showed that the 50% effective concentration

170

(EC50) of LPV on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 was 17.1 µM (i.e. 10,800 ng/mL) and 26.6 μM

171

(i.e. 16,800 ng/mL), respectively.5,16 In our study, median trough plasma level was 20,153 (IQR

172

16,633-26,505) ng/mL barely at these concentrations or just above. The question of whether these

173

plasma concentrations are effective to inhibit in vivo SARS-CoV-2 replication, especially in

174

lungs, is unknown. Furthermore, Covid-19 associated vasculopathy or thrombosis could limit

175

pulmonary diffusion. Altogether, this suggests that keeping high LPV plasma concentration

176

appears essential considering a possible clinical efficacy of LPV in Covid-19.

177

Finally, as most HIV protease inhibitors, LPV has a very high protein binding.17 Therefore, in

178

considering whether a dose is appropriate for SARS-CoV-2, it is critical to consider free drug

179

concentrations. For standard HIV-1, free Cmin is 75 ng/mL that is substantially below EC50

180

reported for coronaviruses.17 Therefore, targeting SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity in patients is

181

challenging. It appears that, in the absence of adverse drug reaction, LPV/r dosage should not be

182

reduced on the basis of therapeutic drug monitoring.

183

Our study has several limitations. First, due to the retrospective design using data from routine

184

care, plasma assays were drawn at different times that prevent from an accurate pharmacokinetic

185

estimation. Second, according to different practices in wards, Covid-19 severity at baseline was

186

heterogeneous between patients. However, most importantly, in all assayed patients, LPV plasma

187

concentrations regardless assays timing were unexpectedly high comparing HIV experience.

188

Finally, unbound concentrations, which are the active ones, were not estimated.

189
190

CONCLUSION

191

In conclusion, we found that LPV/r treatment in Covid-19 patients was associated with

192

unexpected very high plasma concentrations. However, in the absence of adverse drug reaction,

193

LPV dosage should not be reduced, owing that to high plasma concentration may be required for

194

an in vivo antiviral activity as suggested by previous studies. We observed that about one over

195

four to five patients withdrawn LPV/r therapy in relation with moderate adverse drug reactions.

196

Cautious is needed in this context of drug off-label use, which can be associated with a new drug

197

safety profile.

Horizontal red line represent the peak and trough concentrations observed in HIV patients after

291

400 mg/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir twice daily (i.e. for lopinavir at peak 7,000-11,000 ng/mL and

292

at trough 1,000-8,000 ng/mL; for ritonavir at peak 300-500 ng/mL and at trough 100-250

293

ng/mL).18,19
