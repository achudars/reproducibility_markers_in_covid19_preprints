Abstract

47

Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed

48

unprecedented challenges on hospital environmental hygiene and medical staff

49

protection. It is crucial to assess hospital environmental hygiene to understand the

50

most important environmental issues for controlling the spread of COVID-19 in

51

hospitals.

52

Objective: To detect the presence of COVID-19 in the samples from the area at risk

53

of contamination in the First Hospital of Jilin University.

54

Methods: Viruses in the air were collected by natural sedimentation and air particle

55

sampler methods. Predetermined environmental surfaces were sampled using swabs at

56

seven o'clock in the morning before disinfection. The real-time reverse-transcription

57

PCR method was used to detect the existence of COVID-19 pathogens.

58

Results: Viruses could be detected on the surfaces of the nurse station in the isolation

59

area with suspected patients and in the air of the isolation ward with an intensive care

60

patient.

61

Conclusion: Comprehensive monitoring of hospital environmental hygiene during

62

pandemic outbreaks is conducive to the refinement of hospital infection control. It is

63

of great significance to ensure the safety of medical treatment and the quality of

64

hospital infection control through the monitoring of environmental hygiene.

1.Introduction

69

The outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan in December 2019 has led to a serious public

70

health event

71

unprecedented challenges on hospital environmental hygiene. The occurrence of

72

medical staff-associated infections is closely related to long-lived pathogens in the

73

hospital environment

74

to understand the most important environmental issues for controlling the spread of

75

COVID-19 in hospitals. The Chinese government quickly adopted quarantine

76

measures for confirmed and suspected patients to restrain the spread of the

77

pandemic[6]. Comprehensive monitoring of hospital environmental hygiene during the

78

outbreak of the pandemic is conducive to the refinement of hospital infection control

79

[5,7]

80

the reemergence of COVID-19 or similar viruses. Therefore, it is of great significance

81

to ensure the safety of medical treatment and the quality of hospital infection control

82

through the monitoring of environmental hygiene. According to a report from the

83

China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of February 11, 3019 medical

84

staff members were infected with the new coronavirus (including confirmed cases,

85

suspected cases, clinically diagnosed cases, and asymptomatic infections, of which

86

1716 were confirmed cases), indicating that infection through no occupational

87

exposure may occur

88

Meanwhile, it is extremely important to ensure the safety of medical treatments and

89

the quality of hospital infection control by monitoring hospital environmental hygiene.

[1-3]

. Meanwhile, the outbreak of this novel virus has placed

[4,5]

. Thus, it is crucial to assess hospital environmental hygiene

. It also increases understanding of the environmental challenges corresponding to

, but more evidence is needed to support this hypothesis.

90

However, sensitive and effective methods for monitoring hospital-acquired infection

91

control are still limited. Here, by monitoring COVID-19 and detecting nucleic acid,

92

we reveal clinical data indicating hospital environmental hygiene levels and provide a

93

way to monitor pathogenic microorganism contamination and nosocomial infections.

94

2.Methods

95

2.1 Participant Characteristics

96

Fifteen suspected patients and one confirmed intensive care patient (ORF1ab and N

97

were positive according to RT-PCR) were hospitalized in two isolation areas at the

98

First Hospital of Jilin University, a unit for COVID-19 detection. The hospital carries

99

out district management for these two types of patients, and each area includes a

100

nursing station. We detected 158 samples of COVID-19 from the area at risk of

101

contamination. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First

102

Hospital of Jilin University (Changchun, China).

2.2 Sampling and Sample Processing

106

The environmental monitoring methods referenced the hospital sanitation standards

107

(GB15982-2012). All air was collected by two methods: natural sedimentation [9] and

108

a microbial air sampler (MAS-100 ECO), for which the stream of air was set to

109

exactly 100 liters/minute (Merck, Germany)

110

sampled using swabs.

111

2.3 Primer and Probe Sequences

112

Two sequence regions (ORF1ab and N) that are highly conserved among sarbecoviruses were

113

selected for primer and probe design. The primer and probe sequences for the ORF1ab gene assay

114

were

115

5’-AACRCGCTTAACAAAGCACTC-3’

116

5’-TAGTTGTGATGCWATCATGACTAG-3’ (probe, in 5’-FAM/ZEN/3’-IBFQ format; W

5’-TAATCAGACAAGGAACTGATTA-3’

119

(reverse) and 5’-GCAAATTGTGCAATTTGCGG-3’ (probe, in 5’-FAM/ZEN/3’-IBFQ format).

120

The expected amplicon sizes of the ORF1ab and N gene assays were 132 bp and 110 bp,

121

respectively[11]. All primers and probes were purchased from a commercial source (Integrated

122

DNA Technologies). The primer and probe sequences were subsequently confirmed to have

123

perfect matches with other COVID-19 genome sequences available from the Global Initiative on

124

Sharing

were centrifuged at 12000 g for 10 min and incubated for 30 min, the supernatant was

131

discarded, 50 µL of RNA release agent was added to the tube, and the sample was

132

mixed and incubated for 10 min.

133

2.5 Real-time Reverse-Transcription PCR

134

A 50-µL reaction contained 20 µL of RNA and 30 µL of 1× reaction buffer consisting

135

of 26 µL of COVID-19 PCR mix (containing primers (4.62%), probes (1.15%),

136

dNTPs (3.85%), MgCl2 (0.77%), RNasin (0.48%), and PCR buffer (89.13%)

137

(Shengxiang, Hunan, China)) and 4 µL each of COVID-19 PCR enzyme mix

138

(containing RT enzyme (62.5%) and Taq enzyme (37.5%) (Shengxiang, Hunan,

139

China)). Thermal cycling was performed at 50 °C for 30 min for reverse transcription,

140

followed by 95 °C for 1 min and then 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s.

141

Participating laboratories used a Hongshi SLAN 96 S instrument (Hongshi, Shanghai,

142

China). A sample was considered positive when the qPCR Ct value was ≤40.

143
144

3. Results

145

A total of 158 samples were collected from the area at risk of contamination. The two

146

positive areas were the surfaces of the nurse station in the isolation area with

147

suspected patients and the air of the isolation ward with an intensive care patient

148

(Tables 2 and 3). We found that the virus was present both on surfaces and in the air.

149

The total positive rate was 1.26% (2/158). The positive rates of the air and surface

150

samples were 3.57% (1/28) and 0.77% (1/130), respectively.

Based on the original 24 hours of ultraviolet air filtering and 1000-2000 mg/L

157

chlorine-containing disinfectant for ambient air and floor disinfection, the frequencies

158

and duration times of air disinfections were extended. Key surfaces such as computer

4. Discussion

163

Our positive results in nucleic acid tests indicated that viruses were present in the air

164

of an isolation ward with intensive care patients. The hermetic spaces of isolation

165

wards are weak in air flow, which may cause high contact with the virus. Additionally,

166

the confirmed patient underwent tracheal intubation the day before the samples were

167

collected, and this procedure produced large amounts of aerosols that spread in the

168

wards and seriously polluted the air. Siegel et al. reported that medical ventilators

169

might generate respiratory aerosols that have been associated with an increased risk of

170

occupationally acquired infections among healthcare personnel

171

necessary to increase the intensity of disinfection for isolation wards with intensive

172

care patients. For example, we should enhance ventilator exhaust management by

173

adding ventilator exhaust port filters.

174

The suspected and confirmed patients stay a relatively long time in the high-risk area

175

and may influence the environment. The intrusive and other operations that can easily

176

produce aerosols may cause serious air pollution. The sites under observation without

177

patients and operations have less impact on the environment. The samples from the

178

same collection points were tested after a series of infection prevention and control

179

measures were taken, such as continuous use of an air disinfection machine for the

180

disinfection of ward air; extending the frequency of disinfection for ground and object

181

surfaces; changing gloves and cleaning hands after operations and leaving the ward;

182

and covering computer keyboards and changing the cover each day. Following the

183

implementation of these measures, the results were negative, showing the

[12]

. Therefore, it is

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.20028043; this version posted March 2, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

184

effectiveness of disinfection. In the high-risk areas, such as hospital pre-check triages

185

and the fever clinic, due to the open environment and large amount of air flow, the

186

results were negative.

187

The previous research reports that the routine cleaning and disinfection procedures are

188

the most likely cause of the deficiency of disinfection in the hospital environment,

189

leading to the spread of pathogens

190

surfaces of the nurse station in the isolation area with suspected patients, suggesting

191

that we need to strengthen the surface disinfection of nurse stations, especially

192

focusing on computer keyboards, mice and types of equipment that are not easy to

193

disinfect. A large number of studies have shown that the hands or gloves of medical

194

staff members may be contaminated by contact with environmental surfaces

195

contaminated by pathogens[13-15]. In the process of diagnosis and treatment, pathogens

196

may be transmitted to patients and cause hospital-associated infections. Therefore, it

197

is also very important to further strengthen the hand hygiene of the medical staff.

198

We need to formulate refinement measures based on environmental hygiene

199

monitoring data to improve the quality of hospital infection control. Due to fact that

200

“uncultivable” microbes widely exist, traditional methods used to measure the effect

201

of hospital infection control, such as sedimentation (exposing a microbial growth

202

plate to the environment) have shown limited effects and poor sensitivity. For

203

laboratories and testing organizations, high concentrations of nucleic acid may exist in

204

aerosols, which may influence the test results and the operator’s safety and may even

205

cause spread of the disease. Nucleic acid detection provides an effective method with

[13]

. In our study, viruses were detected on the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.20028043; this version posted March 2, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

206

which to monitor the environment and to evaluate the effectiveness of disinfection,

207

especially for highly contagious diseases or pathogenic microorganisms with a

208

potential aerosol risk, such as COVID-19. These nucleic acid detection results are

209

very important for standardized hospital infection control. This study also increases

210

our understanding of the environmental challenges corresponding to the reemergence

211

of COVID-19 or similar viruses.

212

The data obtained in this study suggest that COVID-19 exists in the air of isolation

213

wards with intensive care patients and existed on the surfaces of nurse stations and

214

that medical staff encounter this virus in the air and on surfaces during patient care

215

activities. An effective disinfection procedure may reduce the biosafety risk.

216

For hospital infection control, we suggest:

217

1.

isolation ward area; crossing the areas should be strictly prohibited.

218
219

Different people should be responsible for the isolation observation area and the

2.

Objects in each area should be used exclusively; equipment that must be used for
special purposes should be sterilized before being used in other areas.

220
221

3.

Hand hygiene rules should be observed strictly, thoroughly and at all times.

222

4.

Additional gloves, disposable isolators, protective screens or hoods should be

223

worn when an operation may cause the spattering of blood, bodily fluid or

224

aerosol, and these items should be discarded immediately to avoid the pollution

225

of other areas.
