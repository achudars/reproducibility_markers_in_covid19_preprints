Abstract

24

Aims

25

To explore clinical features and outcome of 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV)-infected

26

patients with high BNP levels

27

Methods and results

28

Data were collected from patients’ medical records, and we defined high BNP according to

29

the plasma BNP was above > 100 pg/mL. In total,34 patients with corona virus disease

30

2019(COVID-19)were included in the analysis. Ten patients had high plasma BNP level. The

31

median age for these patients was 60.5 years

32

were men. Underlying comorbidities in some patients were coronary heart disease (n=2,

33

20%)

34

patients had a history of Wuhan exposure. The most common symptoms at illness onset in

35

patients were fever (n=7, 70%), cough (n=3, 30%), headache or fatigue n=4,40% . These

36

patients had higher aspartate aminotransferase(AST), troponin I, C reactive protein and lower

37

hemoglobin, and platelet count,compared with patients with normal BNP, respectively.

38

Compared with patients with normal BNP, patients with high BNP were more likely to

39

develop severe pneumonia, and receive tracheal cannula, invasive mechanical ventilation,

40

continuous renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and be

41

admitted to the intensive care unit. One patient with high BNP died during the study.

42

Conclusion

43

High BNP is a common condition among patients infected with 2019-nCoV. Patients with

44

high BNP showed poor clinical outcomes

（interquartile range, 40-80y）, and 6/10 (60%)

，hypertesion（n=3，30%）, heart failure (n=1,10%)and diabetes (n=2, 20%). Six (60%)

INTRODUCTION

47

The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), a new fatal virus that emerged at the end of 2019,

48

is a growing public health concern worldwide (1). The findings from previous studies show

49

that some infected patients had abnormal laboratory test results, including blood cell counts ,

50

BNPand brain natriuretic peptide(BNP) and so on (2) (3). However, as a new coronavirus, we

51

still know little about whether 2019-nCoV is more likely to be harmful for these patients with

52

with high plasma BNP levels and the role of BNP in corona virus disease 2019(COVID-19).

53

More detailed investigations of the relationship between BNP and the clinical outcomes of

54

people infected with 2019-nCoV are urgly needed.

55

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), a member of a family of natriuretic peptides ,was first

56

idendified in 1988 and discovered to be present in high concentrations in cardiac

57

tissues, , especially the ventricles (4). Initial studies showed that BNP levels were strongl

58

related to impaired left ventricular (LV) function (5). In recent years, BNP, as a valuable

59

clinical biochemical marker, has been widely used in the diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic

60

effect evaluation of cardiovascular diseases such as acute coronary syndrome, right

61

ventricular dysfunction,pulmonary disease, diastolic dysfunction (6).However, plasma BNP

62

levels are affected by many factors. BNP is not only regulated by myocardial extension, but

63

also affected by factors such as tachycardia, epinephrine, thyroxine, vasoactive peptide and

64

infection and so on (7) . 2019-nCoV, as a new virus, although it mainly damages lung tissue,

65

some studies have found that it also has a destructive effect on the heart. A recent study

66

indicate N-Terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide(NT-proBNP) has a prognostic value in

67

severe covid-19 patients (8).However, The role of BNP in COVID-19 patient is still

68

unknown..

69

This paper provides an overview of the clinical features of 2019-nCoV-infected patients

70

with high plasma BNP levels to provide insight into the prevention and treatment for these

71

patients.

72
73

METHODS

74

In total,34 patients with corona virus disease 2019(COVID-19)were included in analysis.

75

Patients were admitted to Guangzhou eighth people’s hospital from January 20, 2020, to

76

February 24, 2020. Throat swab specimens were gathered from all patients after admission,

77

and Real-Time polymerase chain reaction were performed to detect 2019-nCoV ribonucleic

78

acid .All patients with COVID-19 were diagnosed based on the World Health Organization

79

interim guidelines(9). Unless otherwise specified, all values are the first data after admission,

80

and if the index was measured more than twice, we chose the highest value for analysis. High

81

BNP level was diagnosed if the plasma BNP were above the 99th percentile of the upper

82

reference limit (> 100 pg/mL)) using the tridge BNP test (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA,

83

USA). Pneumonia severity was defined according to the international guidelines for

84

community-acquired pneumonia(10). The epidemiological, laboratory, clinical and outcome

85

data are derived from the patient's electronic medical records. the ethics commissions of the

86

Guangzhou Eighth people’s hospital has approved this study , with a waiver of informed

87

consent.

Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation for normally

distributed data or as median (interquartile range,IQR) for skewed distributions. Frequency

90

data were presented as proportions. Student’s t test or the Mann–Whitney U test were

91

performed for continuous variables when appropriate, whereas differences in categorical

92

variables were assessed using the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. SPSS 25.0 (IBM Corp.

93

Armonk, NY, USA) were used to perform All analyses and a two-tailed p-value < 0.05 was

94

considered statistically significant.

DISCUSSION

122

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study systematically exploring clinical features

123

and outcomes of 2019 novel coronavirus-infected patients with high BNP(not NT-proBNP)

124

levels. Our results showed that 2019-nCoV infected patients with high plasma BNP levels

125

had worse clinical outcomes compared with patients with normal plasma BNP levels.

126

BNP and NT-proBNP, peptides produced by cardiomyocytes are widely used to guide

127

in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of heart failure (11). It is well known that the level of

128

BNP in plasma is affected by many factors, such as inflammation and stress reaction and so

129

on

130

are often accompanied with high plasma BNP level. Some studies have shown patients with

131

COVID-19 often had abnormal BNP/NT-proBNP in plasma (2) (3).Howerver,by now,there is

epidemiology and outcomes of 2019-nCoV-infected patients with high plasma BNP levels.

135

Most of patients with high BNP levels in our study were usually older and often had

136

pre-existing heart disease. High BNP level following 2019-nCoV infection is associated with

137

poor patient outcomes. These patients were more likely receive mechanical ventilation,

138

tracheal cannula, continuous renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane
