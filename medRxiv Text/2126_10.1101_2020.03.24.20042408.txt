Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerged infection of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has been pandemic all over the
world. This study described acute kidney injury (AKI) at early stage of COVID-19 and
its clinical significance. Three-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients with were
recruited and clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. Patient's
prognosis was tracked and risk factors of AKI was analyzed. Of 355 COVID-19 patients,
common, severe and critical ill cases accounted for 63.1%, 16.9% and 20.0%,
respectively. On admission, 56 (15.8%) patients were with AKI. Although AKI was
more common in critical ill patients with COVID-19, there was no significant
association between oxygenation index and renal functional indices among COVID-19
patients with AKI. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and comorbidity
with diabetes were three important independent risk factors predicting AKI among
COVID-19 patients. Among 56 COVID-19 patients with AKI, 33.9% were died on
mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. Fatality rate was obviously higher among COVID+19 patients with AKI than those without AKI (RR=7.08, P<0.001). In conclusion, male
elderly COVID-19 patients with diabetes are more susceptible to AKI. AKI at early
stage may be a negative prognostic indicator for COVID-19.
Key words: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2);
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Acute kidney injury (AKI).

1 Introduction
Since December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness patients with unclear
causes were found in several hospitals in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China (WHO.
Novel coronavirus China. 2020; https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novelcoronavirus-china/en/ ). On February12, 2020, the International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses declared the official classification of this novel coronavirus as
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The World Health
Organization (WHO) pronounced the official name of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease
as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since the first patient was reported in
December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, COVID-19 broke out quickly
and had been pandemic all over the world 1. Until 15th March, 2020, more than 150,000
cases were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and more than 5000 cases died
from SARS-CoV-2 infection all over the world (China CDC Weekly. Novel coronavirus
China. 2020; http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/index.htm ).

SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted by droplets or direct contact and infected
through respiratory tract 2. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted by feces
3

. Accumulating data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting

enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter human cells, mainly pulmonary epithelial cells, and probably
cardiomyocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells 4-6. The main symptoms and signs of
COVID-19 patients are fever, companied by dry cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, fatigue and
lymphopenia

7-11

. Although only a few cases died in mild COVID-19 patients, death

risk was rapidly increased among critical ill patients with the fatality rate even more
than 50% 12. A large number of clinical data have revealed that infection with SARSCoV-2 not only causes severe acute respiratory syndrome but also multiple organ
injuries, including myocardial dysfunction, hepatic injury and even acute renal failure
(AKI)

13

. Nevertheless, what factors influence the multiple organ injuries, especially

AKI, during the pathogenesis of COVID-19 remains unclear. Moreover, the clinical
significance of AKI needs to be further clarified.

The objective of this study is to describe the clinical and laboratory features of
AKI at early stage of 355 COVID-19 patients in two hospitals from different regions.
We showed that male elderly COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus were more
susceptible to AKI. We provide evidence that the development of AKI at early stage
may be a potential negative prognostic indicator for survival of COVID-19 patients.

2 Methods
2.1 Study design and participants
In the present study, 200 patients, who were diagnosed as COVID-19 from January
1 to January 30, 2020, were recruited from Union Hospital of Huazhong University of
Science and Technology, in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China. One-hundred and fiftyfive patients, who were diagnosed as COVID-19 from January 25 to February 20, 2020,
were recruited from the Second People’s Hospital of Fuyang City, in Anhui province,
China. Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology is one of
COVID-19-designated hospitals in Wuhan City. The Second Affiliated Hospital of
Anhui Medical University sent a medical team to this hospital to recuse COVID-19
patients. The Second People’s Hospital of Fuyang City is one of COVID-19designated hospitals in Anhui province. The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui
Medical University sent a specialist group to guide COVID-19 treatment. All COVID19 patients were clinically diagnosed on basis of typical clinical manifestations
accompanied with characteristic chest radiology changes. Real-time RT-PCR was used
to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA and confirm infection with SARS-CoV-2. The patient with
negative result on SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was excluded from this study. All
COVID-19 patients were eligible in this study. Each COVID-19 patient gave advanced
oral consent. The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Anhui
Medical University.
2.2 Data collection
The medical record of each COVID-19 patient was evaluated. Following data were
collected from the electronic medical records: demographic information, preexisting

comorbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatic disease,
cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes and other disease. Patient’s signs and
symptoms, chest computed tomographic (CT) scan and laboratory test results were also
collected. The dates of onset, admission and death were recorded. The onset time was
defined as the date when patients’ any symptom and sign were found.
2.3 Laboratory testing
Patient’s pharyngeal swab specimens were collected for extraction of SARS-CoV2 RNA. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect viral nucleic acid using a COVID-19
nucleic acid detection kit following experimental instructions (Shanghai bio-germ
Medical Technology Co Ltd). Viral RNA extraction and nucleic acid detection were
executed by either the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Wuhan City or the
Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Fuyang City. Other laboratory tests, such
as routine blood test, hepatic function, creatinine, urea nitrogen, uric acid, creatine
kinase (CK) and oxygenation index were examined on admission. All laboratory tests
were analyzed by the clinical laboratory of either the Union Hospital of Huazhong
University of Science and Technology or the Second People’s Hospital of Fuyang City.
2.4 Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 software. Categorical
variables were expressed with frequencies and percentages. Continuous variables were
shown using median and mean values. Means for continuous variables were compared
with independent-samples t tests when the data were normally distributed; if not, the
Mann-Whitney test was used. Proportions for categorical variables were compared with
the chi-square and Fisher’s exact test. Univariable logistic regression between basic
disease or different parameter and demise was performed. Moreover, the main risks
related with demise were examined using multivariable logistic regression models
adjusted for potential confounders. Statistical significance was determined at P＜0.05.

3.1 Demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients
The clinical characteristics of 355 COVID-19 patients were analyzed. The most
common symptom of COVID-19 patients was fever (75.0%), followed by cough
(48.5%), diarrhea (36.6%) and fatigue (32.1%). Of 355 patients, common cases, defined
as oxygenation index higher than 300, accounted for 63.1% (224/355). Severe cases,
whose oxygenation index was from 200 to 300, accounted for 16.9% (60/355). Critical
ill cases, oxygenation index lower than 200, accounted for another 20.0% (71/355).
Moreover, 50.1% COVID-19 patients had at least one of comorbidity with either
diabetes (41.4%) or hypertension (35.2%). The blood routine indices were analyzed. As
shown in Table 1, mean WBC count was 5.67×109/L. In addition, mean neutrophil and
lymphocyte counts was 4.21×109/L and 1.02×109/L, respectively (Table 1). As shown
in Table, 38% COVID-19 patients have neutrophil percentage above normal range. By
contrast, 46.8% COVID-19 patients have lymphocyte percentage below normal range.
In addition, 33% COVID-19 patients have hemoglobin below normal range (Table 1).
Hepatic functional indices were then analyzed. As shown in Table 1, the levels of serum
total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein and albumin were 14.16 μmol/L, 5.17
μmol/L, 67.30 g/L and 38.53 g/L, respectively. Moreover, serum ALT and AST were
35.03 and 40.76 U/L, respectively. As shown in Table 1, 25.6% COVID-19 patients
have ALT above normal range. In addition, 28.7% COVID-19 patients have AST above
normal range. Next, myocardial functional indices are shown in Table 1. Mean creatine
kinase, LDH and D-dimer were 257.69 U/L, 296.42 U/L and 2762.41 μg/L, respectively.
As shown in Table 1, 45.6% COVID-19 patients have LDH above normal range. In
addition, 71.8% COVID-19 patients have D-dimer above normal range.
3.2 AKI is companied at the early stage of COVID-19 pneumonia
Renal functional indices, as determined by serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and uric
acid, were measured among 355 COVID-19 patients. As shown in Table 1, mean urea
nitrogen was 4.9±3.3 mmol/L. The levels of serum creatinine and uric acid were 72.4
±34.7 and 258.9±102.8 µmol/L,

respectively.

addition, the levels of serum urea nitrogen were higher in severe patients than those of
mild patients (Table 2). The correlationship between oxygenation index and renal
functional indices was then analyzed. There was no significant association between
oxygenation index and all renal functional indices among COVID-19 patients with AKI
(Fig.1A-C). As shown in Fig. 1, a negative correlation was observed between
oxygenation index and blood urea nitrogen among COVID-19 patients without AKI.
There was no significant association between oxygenation index and creatinine as well
as uric acid among COVID-19 patients without AKI (Fig.1D-E). AKI was defined as
any of renal functional indices beyond normal range 14. Among 355 COVID-19 patients,
56 (15.8%) patients were with AKI on admission (Table 2). Although 24 cases were
with AKI among mild COVID-19 patients, AKI is more common in critical ill patients
with COVID-19 (Table 2, 10.7% in mild cases vs 18.3% in severe cases vs 29.2% in
critical ill cases, P<0.01).

3.3 Male elderly COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus are more susceptible to AKI
The effects of different genders on renal functional indices were analyzed. As
shown in Table 3, the levels of serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and uric acid were higher
in males than those of females. The effects of ages on renal functional indices were then
analyzed. As shown in Table 3, the levels of serum urea nitrogen were higher in patients
over 70 years old than those from 50 to 69 years old and under 50 years old (Table 3).
Moreover, the levels of serum urea nitrogen were higher in patients from 50 to 69 years
old than those under 50 years old (Table 3). In addition, the levels of serum creatinine
and uric acid were higher in patients over 70 years old than those under 70 years old
(Table 3). The effects of comorbidity with either hypertension or diabetes on renal
functional indices are shown in Table 4. The levels of serum creatinine, urea nitrogen
and uric acid were higher in COVID-19 patients with diabetes than those without
diabetes. No significant difference on serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and uric acid was
observed between COVID-19 patients with hypertension and without hypertension
(Table 4). Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze risk factors of AKI
among 355 COVID-19 patients. As shown in Table 5, the OR of males with AKI was
1.898 (95% Cl: 1.011, 3.562; P＜0.05). The OR of older age with AKI was 1.976 (95%

The effects of AKI at the early stage on death risk were analyzed among COVID19 patients. Among 56 COVID-19 patients with AKI, 33.9% were died on mean 10.9
day after hospitalization. The fatality rate was obviously higher among COVID-19
patients with AKI than those without renal injury (33.9 % vs 4.3%, RR=7.88, P<0.001).
Discussion
The objective of the present study was to describe the clinical characteristics and
analyze the influence factors of SARS-CoV-2-induced AKI among 355 COVID-19
patients in two hospitals from different regions. The major findings of the present study
include: (1) AKI is more common in critical ill patients with COVID-19; (2) Male
elderly COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus are more susceptible to AKI; (3) AKI
at the early stage elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients.
Several studies indicated that COVID-19 patients were usually companied by
multiple organ injuries, including myocardial dysfunction, hepatic injury and even
acute renal failure 13. In the present study, we analyzed AKI at the early stage of COPID19. AKI was determined by measuring biochemical indices including serum creatinine,
urea nitrogen and uric acid. Our results showed that 15.8% COVID-19 patients were
companied by AKI on admission. Off interest, the levels of serum creatinine, urea
nitrogen and uric acid on admission were higher in critical ill patients than those of mild
COVID-19 patients. Although some mild COVID-19 patients were with AKI on
admission, AKI is more common in critical ill patients with COVID-19. These results
suggest an association between AKI at the early stage and the severity of COVID-19
patients.
Increasing evidence demonstrated that elderly COVID-19 patients were more
serious 15,16. In the present study, we analyzed the impact of gender and age on AKI at
the early stage of COVID-19. We showed that the levels of serum creatinine, urea
nitrogen and uric acid were higher in males than those of females. Moreover, the levels
of serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and uric acid were higher in old patients over 70

years old than those of younger patients. Several reports showed that COVID-19
patients with comorbidities were more serious. Indeed, the present study found that
more than half of COVID-19 patients were with either diabetes or hypertension. Thus,
it is especially whether COVID-19 patients with either diabetes or hypertension are
more susceptible to AKI. Unexpectedly, there was no difference on renal functional
indices between COVID-19 patients with hypertension and without hypertension.
Interestingly, urea nitrogen and uric acid were higher in COVID-19 patients with
diabetes than those without diabetes. To exclude potential confounding factors,
multivariable logistic regression was used to further analyze the impact of gender, age
and comorbidities on AKI at the early stage of COVID-19. Our results indicated that
male, older age and comorbidity with diabetes were major risk factors of AKI at the
early stage of COVID-19 patients. Taken together, these results suggest that male
elderly COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus are more susceptible to AKI.
An early study found that SARS patients with AKI were at an increased death risk
17

. In the present study, we analyzed the association of AKI with death risk of COVID-

19 patients. Among 56 subjects with AKI on admission, about a third of patients died
on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. The fatality rate was obviously higher among
COVID-19 patients with AKI than those without AKI. These results provide evidence
that AKI at the early stage elevated death risk of COVID-19 patients.
The mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 injection induces AKI is likely to be
multifactorial. Several reports showed that most COVID-19 patients were companied
with multiple organ damage

9,14

. However, the present study found that there was no

significant association between oxygenation index and all measured renal functional
indices among COVID-19 patients with AKI, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2-induced
AKI is independent of respiratory failure. Two early reports showed that ACE2, as a
receptor for SARS-CoV-2, was highly expressed in renal tubular epithelium

18,19

.

Another early study found that SARS viral particles were detected in the epithelium of
the renal distal tubules

20

. Therefore, the present study does not exclude that SARS-

CoV-2 induces AKI through directly infecting renal epithelium. Further experiments
are required to explore whether renal tubular epithelium is another target of SARSCoV-2 injection.
In summary, the present study described the clinical and laboratory characteristics
of AKI among 355 COVID-19 patients in two hospitals from different regions. Our
results showed that AKI was more common in critical ill patients with COVID-19.
Moreover, male elderly COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus were more
susceptible to AKI. We found that AKI at the early stage elevated death risk of COVID19 patients. We provide evidence that the development of AKI at the early stage may
be a potential negative prognostic indicator for survival of COVID-19 patients.
Therefore, the improvement of renal function is beneficial for elevating the survival
rate of COVID-19 patients especially critical ill patients.
