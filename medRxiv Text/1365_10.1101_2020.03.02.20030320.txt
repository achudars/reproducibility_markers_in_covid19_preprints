Abstract
As of 1 March 2020, Iran has reported 987 COVID-19 cases and including 54
associated deaths. At least six neighboring countries (Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman,
Afghanistan and Pakistan) have reported imported COVID-19 cases from Iran. We
used air travel data and the cases from Iran to other Middle East countries and
estimated 16533 (95% CI: 5925, 35538) COVID-19 cases in Iran by 25 February,
before UAE and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries suspended inbound and
outbound flights from Iran.

Keywords: coronavirus disease 2019; air travel data; ascertainment rate

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province,
China in the end of 2019, and soon spread to the rest of China and overseas (Bogoch
et al., 2020). To date, there were 78630 cases reported in China and 3664 cases
confirmed in 46 foreign countries (World Health Organization, 2020). Recently, Iran
has become an epicenter in the Middle East region, which has the largest cumulative
number of deaths outside China (Wikipedia, 2020). As of 1 March 2020, Iran has
confirmed 987 COVID-19 cases and including 54 associated deaths (Wikipedia,
2020). At least six neighboring countries (Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Afghanistan
and Pakistan) have reported imported COVID-19 cases from Iran. Given the serious
concerns over the under-ascertainment of COVID-19 cases in Iran (ABC News, 2020),
UAE and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries have suspended inbound and
outbound flights from Iran since 25 February 2020 (Khaleej Times, 2020).

Objective
In this study, we used the imported cases and air travel data from Iran to other Middle
East countries to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases in Iran. Then we compared
our estimates with the number of reported cases in Iran to evaluate the extent of
under-ascertainment.

Data
We obtained transport capability of international airlines from 30 major airports in
Iran from 1 February to 24 February 2020 (WorldData, 2020), from the Variflight
platform (https://data.variflight.com/). We collected the number of exported cases
from Iran to other countries in the Middle East (World Health Organization, 2020).
Population size of Iran (81,800,269 in 2018) was obtained from the World Bank
(https://data.worldbank.org/). Table 1 shows the number of daily population flow and
total reported cases of countries used in our calculation.

Methods
Following Imai et al.â€™s (2020), we assumed number of cases (n) exported from Iran
follows a Binomial distribution (Bin) with size N and probability p. Here, N
represents total number of cases infected in Iran, and p is the probability that one case

is detected overseas. We approximated p by the ratio of daily outbound passengers of
Iran (D) over total size of population (M) that those airports serve and multiplying the
mean duration (t) from exposure to detection. Thus, p = Dt / M. We set t at 10 days
according to (Imai et al., 2020). We assumed that the catchment population is the total
population of Iran. We calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the total
number of COVID-19 cases in Iran (Î») by fitting model to the number of confirmed
cases with Binomial-distributed likelihood framework. As shown in Eqn (1),

The 95% confidence intervals (CI) are calculated by using the profile likelihood
estimation approach determined by a Chi-square quantile.

To explore more alternative scenarios, we also considered a smaller catchment
population (60,000,000) and a shorter detection window (8 days). We considered a
baseline scenario with 100% attendance rate for each aircraft as well as other
alternative scenarios. In addition, we tested the situation that 90% and 70%
attendance rate for each aircraft, keeping other situation as baseline scenario.

Results and discussion

We estimated the total number of cases in Iran was 16533 (95% CI: 5925, 35538) by
25 February 2020. Table 2 summarizes the sensitivity analysis of varying the baseline
assumptions and alternative scenarios about catchment population, detection window
and attendance rates.

As suggested by Zhao et al. (2020), underreporting was likely occurred at the early
stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, due to the shortage of diagnostic kits and
inadequate screening for suspected cases (Imai et al., 2020). Recent study by Tuite et
al. (2020) estimated a total of 18,300 (95% CI: 3770-53,470) cases in Iran by 25
February 2020. Our estimates are consistent with Tuite et al.â€™s (2020) work. To
conclude, Iranâ€™s ascertainment rate could be at a level of 0.6% by Feb 25, 2020. The
health security capabilities of many countries in the Middle East are below the world

average (Ghsindex, 2019), which means that if Iran's epidemic continues to spread to
neighboring countries, the fragile public health systems of Middle East countries is
likely to find difficulty in coping with the outbreak.
