Abstract
Background: Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified
virus which mainly spreads from person-to-person. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 has been
constantly reported in stools of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
However, there is a paucity of data concerning fecal shedding of the virus in pediatric
patients.
Objective: To investigate dynamic changes of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory and fecal
specimens in children with COVID-19.
Methods: From January 17, 2020 to February 23, 2020, three pediatric cases of COVID-19
were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory,
and radiological characteristics and treatment data of these children were collected. Real-time
fluorescence reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to
detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs and fecal specimens. Patients were followed up to
March 10, 2020, the final date of follow-up, and dynamic profiles of RT-PCR results were
closely monitored.
Results: All the three pediatric cases were household contacts of adults whose symptoms
developed earlier. Severity of disease was mild to moderate and fever was the most consistent
and predominant symptom at onset of illness of these children (two cases had body
temperature higher than 38.5°C). All children showed increased lymphocytes (>4.4×109/L)
with normal white blood cell counts on admission. Radiological changes were not typical for
COVID-19. All children showed good response to supportive treatment. Clearance of SARSCoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas viral
RNA remained positive in stools of pediatric patients for longer than 4 weeks. Two children
had fecal SARS-CoV-2 turned negative 20 days after throat swabs showing negative, while
that of another child lagged behind for 8 days.
Interpretation: SARS-CoV-2 may exist in gastrointestinal tract for a longer time than
respiratory system. Persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children
indicates the potential for the virus to be transmitted through fecal excretion. Massive efforts
should be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children after
reopening of kindergartens and schools.

Introduction
On December 12, 2019, 27 pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, Hubei
Province, China.1 The etiological agent was identified as a novel coronavirus and was later
renamed as severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the world health
organization (WHO).2,3 The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has wreaked
havoc in China and spread rapidly to about ninety countries, constituting a global threat with
the highest risk impact.4 Epidemiological evidence gained in China suggested that most
individuals lack relevant immunity and are generally susceptible to the virus. The majority of
published studies of COVID-19 focused on adult populations.5-8 While knowledge on SARSCoV-2 infection in children are still yet to be fully developed and only a limited number of
case reports of pediatric patients are currently available.9-12
As of February 23, 2020, a cumulative total of 60 confirmed COVID-19 cases were
reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China, of which three cases (5%) were children
under 10 years of age. Pediatric patients presented clinical characteristics distinct from those
observed in adult patients. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the stool of these
children 8-20 days after negative conversion of viral RNA in respiratory specimens. Whereas
the majority of adult patients had negative results of nucleic acid testing in respiratory and
fecal specimens synchronously. Prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces after
showing negative in respiratory specimens may become a source of COVID-19 in the
community and pose a threat to public health if fitness for discharge is based on the current
version of Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (“with normal body
temperature for more than 3 days”, “with obvious features of absorption of inflammation
shown in lung imaging” and “negative results of the nucleic acid tests of respiratory
pathogens for consecutive two times [sampling interval at least 1 day]”).13

Methods
Patients
From January 17, 2020 to February 23, 2020, a total of 60 patients were diagnosed with
COVID-19 in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. We recruited all three pediatric patients
with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were reported by the local health
authority. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the WHO interim guidance.14 Patients were
followed up on a regular basis after hospital discharge till March 10, 2020.

This study was approved by the Ethics Commission of Qingdao Women and Children’s
Hospital (QFFLL-KY-2020-11) and written informed consent was obtained from patients’
legal guardians prior to enrolment.

Data collection
Personal, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomes
information were obtained with standardized data collection forms from electronic medical
records. Additionally, we directly contacted patients’ families to ascertain epidemiological
and symptom information. Data were entered into a computerized database and doublechecked by two researchers independently.

Sample Collection and Detection of SARS-CoV-2
Throat swabs were obtained from patients on admission. Fecal specimens were first collected
in two patients (case 1, 1.5-year-old male; and case 2, 5-year-old male) on day 4 after onset
of the disease. While the stool sample from another patient (case 3, 6-year-old female) was
obtained 9 days after hospital discharge. To monitor the dynamic changes of viral shedding,
we obtained throat swabs from patients every day during hospitalization and every other day
during follow-up after discharge. Fecal specimens were collected applying a similar rationale
since the first day of sample collection (samples from case 3 were only collected during
follow-up period). Presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by real-time fluorescence
reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a commercial kit approved
by the China Food and Drug Administration. Detailed procedures were described
elsewhere.15

Results
Clinical presentations, laboratory and radiological findings
Severity of disease in all patients was mild according to Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of
Corona Virus Disease 2019 (tentative fifth/sixth edition).16,17 The disease started with fever
( ≧38.5°C) in all of the three children. None of them developed severe complications nor
required intensive care or mechanical ventilation. All children showed good response to
supportive treatment including inhalation of interferon, oral Ribavirin and traditional Chinese
medicine.

Laboratory findings of these children on admission to hospital are shown in Table 1. On
admission, all the children had increased lymphocyte count (>4.4×109/L). Only case 1
showed decreased neutrophil count (<1.7×109/L), whereas those of the other two children
were within normal range. Elevation of platelets was observed in case 1 and case 2. Case 3
had increased levels of procalcitonin (0.73 ng/mL) and C-reaction protein (10.5 mg/L), while
serum level of D-dimer (860.0 ng/mL) was found elevated in case 1. Reduced level of serum
creatinine was detected in case 1 and case 2 (<41.0 µmol/L). Transverse chest computed
tomograms (CT) showed delicate patches of ground glass opacity of lower lobe of right lung
in case 1 on day 1 after symptom onset and consolidation changes of the left lower lobe near
the pleura in case 2 on admission; while case 3 had no abnormality on CT imaging (Figure 1).

Persistent fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric patients during the convalescent phase
Two pediatric patients (case 1 and case 2) and their family members with SARS-CoV-2
infection were admitted in Qingdao Women and Children’s Hospital. During clinical practice,
we noticed that the time for viral RNA in respiratory specimens turning negative was similar
between pediatric patients and infected adults (these children’s family members). At this
point, adult patients had negative results for nucleic acid testing in fecal specimens, whereas
SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable in stools from the two infected children. Therefore,
we conducted a quarantine and surveillance protocol for the children and their family
members who were already qualified for hospital discharge according to current standards
after recovery with two consecutively negative RT-PCR test results in throat swabs (sampling
interval at least 1 day). Concerned about the possibility of fecal-oral transmission, we
recorded the timeline of changes in nucleic acid testing results in both throat swabs and fecal
samples collected from these patients (Figure 2). All adult patients of the two families
showed negative results for fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. Strikingly, viral RNA
remained detectable in stools of the two children for 8 and 20 days, respectively, after nucleic
acid turning negative in respiratory samples.
We suspected whether this phenomenon also existed in the third pediatric patient (case 3)
who was admitted in another designated hospital in Qingdao. Unfortunately, by the time we
reached the patient, this child had already been “cured” and discharged. Medical
professionals of this hospital did not collect fecal specimens from the patient and they only
performed RT-PCR testing for throat swabs plus CT according to Diagnosis and Treatment
Plan of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (tentative fifth edition).16 Municipal Centre of Disease
Control and Prevention of Qingdao conducted nucleic acid testing in stool samples collected

from case 3 and the child’s family members 9 days after hospital discharge. This child
showed positive results for RT-PCR analysis in feces. During quarantine and follow-up
period, clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in stool samples occurred 20 days after viral RNA in
respiratory specimens turning negative. Detailed information was not available as no fecal
sample was examined during hospitalization.

Discussion
The newly issued report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 summarized the
evidence so far on SARS-CoV-2 and pointed out 2.4% of those infected were individuals
below 18 years of age.18 According to data released by the China Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, only 0.9% of COVID-19 patients were children under the age of 10 years.19
Among the 60 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Qingdao, 3 (5%) cases were children
younger than 10 years of age.
Most of the pediatric COVID-19 patients had mild disease with good treatment response
and a relatively short time to resolution, with exception of one critically ill case reported in
Wuhan.12 Consistent with previous findings, the three infected children in our study only
presented with fever and mild cough or with no obvious symptom but CT abnormalities.
From available data, children appeared to be slightly affected by SARS-CoV-2, a feature
resembling that of SARS-CoV emerged 17 years ago.20 However, the relatively low attack
rate of COVID-19 in children could be explained by the stringent implementation of home
confinement and prolonged school closure during the outbreak as required by the Chinese
governments. Whether it is also the case during school year is hard to tell. One distinct
feature of pediatric cases is that almost all of them are infected through household contact
with adult patients.9-12,21 As with all new diseases, many characteristics of COVID-19 still
remain largely unknown. There is limited data to support the notion that children are less
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection or virus transmission is less effective among them.
Viral RNA has been constantly detected in stool samples and anal swabs collected from
confirmed cases of COVID-19.5,22-25 In one study, fecal specimens from 9 (53%) of 17
patients were positive for nucleic acid testing, although viral loads of the stool were less than
those of respiratory samples.24 Presence of SARS-CoV-2

was even detected in

environmental samples taken from the surface of toilet bowl and sink in infection isolation
rooms.26 Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in the stool of infected patients as
reported by some case reports.18 Evidence so far indicates the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to
be transmitted through fecal excretion.18 Although the role of fecal shedding in viral

transmission has not been systematically determined, a cautious approach is warranted when
handling stool samples.
While we were closely monitoring the dynamic changes of fecal SARS-CoV-2 in our
patients, a 6-year-old boy in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China, was reported to be
under more than 34 days of hospitalization due to prolonged presence of viral RNA in stools
after showing negative in respiratory samples. Actually, this phenomenon is not rare among
pediatric patients.27 Xiao and colleagues demonstrated that about a quarter of COVID-19
patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detectable in feces after viral clearance in respiratory tract.25
However, the researchers did not discuss whether persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 was
more common in certain age group than the others (patient’s ages ranged from 10 months to
78 years in this study). Therefore, discharged patients might be a potential source of
transmission and follow-up after hospital discharge or discontinuation of quarantine is
advisable.
In face of the emerging infectious disease and limited data on pediatric patients, it is
unclear what role children play in SARS-CoV-2 transmission or to what extent children are
affected by the virus. More attention should be drawn to children, especially for young
children who cannot handle their own excretions. Caregivers of these children should avoid
direct contact with the stool and close the lid before flushing the toilet. Precautionary
measures are needed when conducting aerosol-generating procedures and sewer system
should be kept unobstructed. In some rural areas and underdeveloped regions with poor
sanitation in China, stools are often used as natural fertilizer in agriculture. As sewage cannot
be properly disinfected in these places, it might be possible that SARS-CoV-2 polluted water
causes infection in wild animals which bring the virus back to humans, creating a vicious
cycle. It is also of vital importance to implement strict hygiene measures after reopening of
kindergartens and schools to prevent spreading of the infection among preschool and
schoolchildren.
The limitations of this study should also be noted. In response to the emerging disease,
only respiratory specimens were required for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 according to
clinical guidelines in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak. We therefore failed to obtain
stool samples from the patients during their first few days of hospitalization and could not
determine whether throat swabs and fecal samples showed positive on RT-PCR analysis
simultaneously. Moreover, we did not culture the virus isolated from the feces to test the
viability nor measure viral loads in the samples due to limited conditions.

Taken together, there is an urgent need to re-evaluate the current version of Diagnosis and
Treatment Plan of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (tentative seventh edition).13 Nucleic acid
testing on fecal specimens should be added to the current criteria for hospital discharge and
release of isolation. We call for multi-center studies with larger sample size to clarify the
time lag between fecal and respiratory specimens negative for RNA RT-PCR analysis in
infected children.

Postscript:
We reported to the local health authority immediately once we noticed the persistent
shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in feces of our pediatric patients about three weeks ago. When this
paper was finalized, the seventh edition of Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Corona Virus
Disease 2019 had just been issued and indicated the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of
SARS-CoV-2. Currently, capable hospitals in some parts of China (such as Shanghai,
Guangdong Province, and Shandong Province) have already included negative nucleic acid
testing result of fecal specimens as one of the standards for hospital discharge and release of
isolation.
