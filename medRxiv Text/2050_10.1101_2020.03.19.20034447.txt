Abstract:
There is a high mortality and long hospitalization period for severe cases with 2019 novel
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. Therefore, it makes sense to search for a potential
biomarker that could rapidly and effectively identify severe cases early. Clinical samples from 28
cases of COVID-19 (8 severe cases, 20 mild cases) in Zunyi District from January 29, 2020 to
February 21, 2020 were collected and otherwise statistically analysed for biochemical markers.

patients were significantly higher than those in mild COVID-19 patients (P<0.001), and there
were also significant differences in serum direct bilirubin (DBIL), cholinesterase (CHE) and
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations between severe and mild COVID-19 patients
(P<0.05). Serum urea, CREA, CysC, DBIL, CHE and LDH could be used to distinguish severe
COVID-19 cases from mild COVID-19 cases. In particular, serum biomarkers, including urea,
CREA, CysC, which reflect glomerular filtration function, may have some significance as
potential indicators for the early diagnosis of severe COVID-19 and to distinguish it from mild
COVID-19. Glomerular filtration function injury in severe COVID-19 patients should also be
considered by clinicians.

Introduction:

To date, the 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is the greatest public health problem
in the world. By 10:30 on Mar 19, 2020, the cumulative number of confirmed cases had reached
218,785 globally, including 8,949 deaths. Of the total confirmed COVID-19 patients, about 19.9%
were severe cases[1], which have a mortality rate of about 20%. Severe cases often suffer from
underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes that can accelerate the progression
of 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection[2, 3]. Furthermore, acute respiratory distress
syndrome could lead to death in some severe COVID-19 patients, and this is often accompanied
by heart failure, liver failure, and kidney failure[2, 4]. Therefore, early, simple and effective
diagnosis of severe COVID-19 pneumonia is of great significance in reducing mortality and
shortening the hospitalization period.

The guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia[5-7] have clear
criteria for severe COVID-19, including respiratory rate, haemoglobin oxygen saturation (SaO2),
oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2), and so on. However, these criteria are susceptible to subjective
and objective factors, which may lead to an extended time for diagnosing and the possibility of
misdiagnosing severe COVID-19. Therefore, it makes sense to find a potential biomarker that
could effectively diagnose severe COVID-19.

In this study, we investigated and analysed more than 4,000 test results from 28 COVID-19
patients. The concentrations of 6 serum biochemical markers showed significant differences
between severe and mild COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, the levels of serum biomarkers
reflecting glomerular filtration function (including cystatin C (CysC), creatinine (CREA), and urea)
in severe COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than those in mild patients. It has been
demonstrated that serum urea, CREA and CysC could be potential biomarkers that could rapidly
and specifically reflect severe COVID-19, and it is of great significance in the early diagnosis of
COVID-19 to reduce the mortality and shorten the hospitalization period for patients with severe
COVID-19. Moreover, glomerular filtration injury in patients with severe COVID-19 should not
be ignored by clinicians.

Materials and Methods

The study enrolled patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at The First Affiliated Hospital
of Zunyi Medical University and The Fourth People's Hospital of Zunyi city from January 29,
2020 to February 21, 2020. The exclusion criteria were based on the guidelines for the diagnosis
and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia[6]. The inclusion criteria for participants are shown
in Figure 1.

COVID-19 (with a mean age of 41±19 years), and the remaining baseline characteristics are

analyser (Tokyo, Japan). Low- and high-value human serum matrix standards from Bio-Rad
(California, USA) were used as quality controls in the biomarker tests, and all biochemical

Differences with a value of P<0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Result
In this study, the majority of serum biochemical markers, including UA, HCO3-, AST, GGT,
ALP, TBIL, TBA, TP, ALB, PA, HBDH, CK, CKMB and CRP, did not show significant
differences between severe and mild COVID-19 patients. The differences in and the

Discussion
In this paper, the results of most serum biochemical tests were investigated and analysed. The
incidence of liver or heart failure was higher in severe COVID-19 patients[2, 4]; however, we
found that most of the indicators, including liver and cardiac function biomarkers, except for
serum DBIL, CHE and LDH, did not change significantly or directly in severe and mild
patients. There were not much consistent with some reports in the literature[2], which may be
the result of prophylactic use of drug by doctors. There were also no differences in serum
CRP concentrations between severe and mild COVID-19 patients; however, the overall level
of serum CRP increased, suggesting that it could be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The results of renal injury were similar with 2003 SARS-CoV[8], a close relative of

SARS-CoV-2. We also found that serum urea, CREA, and CysC, which are biochemical
markers of renal function, were significantly elevated in severe COVID-19 patients,
suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection could damage the kidney, and this is consistent with
part of the latest findings[9]. Furthermore, there were no differences in the serum HCO3results between severe and mild COVID-19 patients, and this further suggests that the
glomerulus could be one of the target organs for the coronavirus in severe patients and may be
related to the high expression of ACE2 in glomerular cells[10, 11].
Two limitations are inherent in our study. First, the survey area is relatively limited.
Additionally, the relatively small number of participants in the survey may not fully reflect
the overall situation. Thus, further studies are necessary to execute a large number of data
surveys in multiple regions by multi-centre cooperation.
Herein, we found that some serum indicators of glomerular function, including urea, CREA,
and CysC, were observably higher in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild COVID-19
patients. This result indicates that serum urea, CREA, and CysC could be used as potential
biochemical biomarkers to identify a severe COVID-19 patient. Moreover, clinicians should
constantly monitor the glomerular filtration function while treating patients with a severe
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
