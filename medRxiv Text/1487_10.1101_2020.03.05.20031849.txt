Abstract

38

Background: A novel coronavirus named as “SARS-CoV-2” has spread widely in many countries since

39

December 2019, especially in China. This study aimed to quantify the age-specific transmissibility by

40

using a mathematical model.

41

Methods: An age-specific susceptible – exposed – symptomatic – asymptomatic – recovered –

42

seafood market (SEIARW) model was developed based on two suspected transmission routes (from

43

market to person and person to person). The susceptible people from Wuhan City were divided into

44

different age groups. We used the subscript i and j to represent age group 1 to 4 (i ≠ j; 1: ≤ 14 years; 2:

15-44 years; 3: 45-64 years; 4: ≥ 65 years) and 1 to 5 (i ≠ j; 1: ≤ 5 years; 2: 6-14 years; 3: 15-24 years; 4:

46

25-59 years; 4: ≥ 60 years), respectively. Data of reported COVID-19 cases were collected from one

47

published literature from 26 November to 22 December, 2019 in Wuhan City, China. The age-specific

48

transmissibility of the virus was estimated accordingly secondary attack rate (SAR).

49

Results: The age-specific SEIARW model fitted with the reported data well by dividing the population

50

into four age groups (χ = 4.99  10 , P > 0.999), and five age groups (χ = 4.85  10 , P > 0.999).

51

Based on the four-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 2 to

52

3 (SAR23 = 17.56 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 3 to 2 (SAR32 = 10.17 per 10

53

million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 1 to 2 (SAR12 = 0.002 per 10

54

million persons). Based on the five-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred

55

from age group 4 to 5 (SAR45 = 12.40 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 5 to 4 (SAR54

56

= 6.61 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 3 to 4 (SAR34 =

57

0.0002 per 10 million persons).

58

Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 has high transmissibility among adults and elder people but low

59

transmissibility among children and young people.

Introduction

63

In December 2019, a series of cases were identified by a novel coronavirus named severe acute

64

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported by Wuhan City, Hubei Province,

65

China. The disease was named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health

66

Organization in 11 February 2020. The patients may be related to have contacted with Huanan

67

Seafood Wholesale Market[1], and the virus can continuously transmit from person-to-person with

68

basic reproduction number (R0) of 2.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 3.9)[2]. Another research

69

estimated that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.68 (95% CI, 2.47 to 2.86)[3].

70

Age-related transmissibility of COVID-19 has become a public health concern. The reported cases

71

at the early stage (before 2 January 2020) of the transmission were higher than 18 years old and

72

mainly were on 25-64 years old[1]. A study with 425 patients indicated that the median age was 59

73

years (range, 15 to 89) and reported different case distributions in four age groups: 0 – 14, 15 – 44, 45

74

– 64, and  65 years[2]. However, there is not enough epidemiological evidence to classify the age

75

groups in transmission. In this study, we added another age classification scenario according to our

76

previous research on influenza that people were divided into five age groups: 0 – 5, 6 – 14, 15 – 24, 25

77

– 59, and  60 years[4], to better understand the transmissibility of the disease for different ages.

78

There were several studies focusing on mathematical modelling on COVID-19[2, 3], calculating the

79

R0 by using the serial intervals and intrinsic growth rate[2, 5, 6], or using ordinary differential equations

80

and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods[3]. We also developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People (BHRP)

81

transmission network model and simplified the BHRP model as Reservoir-People (RP) transmission

82

network model to calculate the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2[7]. However, there is no age-specific

83

mathematical model for quantifying the age-specific transmissibility SARS-CoV-2.

84

In this study, based on the RP model which we developed, we built an age-specific susceptible –

85

exposed – symptomatic – asymptomatic – recovered – reservoir (SEIARW) model. The age-specific

86

SEIARW model was employed to estimate the age-specific transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 by fitting

87

the data from 26 November to 23 December, 2019 from published literature[1].

Data collection

91

The data of COVID-19 were collected in Wuhan City from 26 November, 2019 to 23 December,

92

2019 from a published literature[1], including 29 COVID-19 cases with the onset date and exposure

93

history. The data of total population which were used in our model was from Wuhan City Statistics

94

Bureau. The data of age group proportions, birth rate and death rate in our model was obtained from

95

Wuhan Statistical Yearbook.

96

Study design

97

In this study, people were divided into 4 age groups based on the published literature[1], and 5 age

98

groups based on our previous study[4]. We used the subscript i and j to represent age group 1 to 4 (i ≠ j;

99

1: 0 – 14 years; 2: 15 – 44 years; 3: 45 – 64 years; 4: ≥ 65 years) and 1 to 5 (i ≠ j; 1: 0 – 5 years; 2: 6-14

100

years; 3: 15-24 years; 4: 25-59 years; 4: ≥ 60 years), respectively.

101

Age-specific transmission model

102

Our previous study showed that the SEIARW model could be adopted to simulate the infectious

103

diseases transmitted from reservoir (such as water or food) to people and from person to person[8, 9].

104

In this study, the age-specific SEIARW model was developed based on two transmission routes (form

105

market to person and person to person). In the model, people were divided into five compartments:

106

susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic (I), asymptomatic (A), recovered (R), and the seafood

107

market were defined as reservoir (W). The definitions of the six compartments were shown in Table 1.

108

The model was based on following assumptions:

109

a) Susceptible individuals become infected by contact with infected/asymptomatic people;

110

b) SARS-CoV-2 can transmit within each age group. The transmission rate of age group i and j are

111
112
113
114
115

βii and βjj respectively.
c) SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted between different age groups. The transmission rate from age
group i to j is βij and from j to i is βji.
d) Susceptible people will be infected after contact with seafood market, and the infection rate
coefficient is βw;

116

e) All the newborn individuals which were assumed as susceptible were added into age group 1.

117

Each age group has a natural mortality rate. We set the natural birth rate is br, and the natural mortality

118

rate is dr;

119

f) The incubation period of exposed person is 1/ . The exposed person will become asymptomatic

120

people after a latent period of 1/ ’. We describe p (0 ≤ p ≤ 1) as the proportion of asymptomatic

121

infection. Exposed individuals will become asymptomatic person A with a daily rate of pE, and become

122

symptomatic person with a daily rate of (1-p)E;

123

g) The transmissibility of A is  times (0 ≤  ≤ 1) of that of I.

124

h) The individuals I and A will become recovered person (R) after an infectious period of 1/γ and

125
126
127

1/γ’. A part of I would die due to the infection. We assumed that the case fatality rate was f.
i) I and A individuals can shed pathogens into W with the shedding rate of μI and μ'A, where μ and
μ' are the shedding coefficients;

j) SARS-CoV-2 will remove in the market after a given period (the life time of the virus is 1/ε), and
the daily decreasing rate of the pathogen is εW.
The flowchart of the model was shown in Figure 1. The equations of the age-specific SEIARW
model were shown as follows:

Since the different dimension of people and the virus, we adopt the following sets to perform the

𝑠𝑖 = 𝑆𝑖 /𝑁 , 𝑒𝑖 = 𝐸𝑖 /𝑁 , 𝑖𝑖 = 𝐼𝑖 /𝑁 , 𝑎𝑖 = 𝐴𝑖 /𝑁 , 𝑟𝑖 = 𝑅𝑖 /𝑁 , 𝑠𝑗 = 𝑆𝑗 /𝑁 , 𝑒𝑗 = 𝐸𝑗 /𝑁 , 𝑖𝑗 = 𝐼𝑗 /𝑁 , 𝑎𝑗 = 𝐴𝑗 /𝑁 ,

𝑟𝑗 = 𝑅𝑗 /𝑁, 𝑤 = ε𝑊/𝜇𝑁, 𝜇 ′ = 𝑐𝜇, 𝑏𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝑖𝑖 𝑁, 𝑏𝑖𝑗 = 𝛽𝑖𝑗 𝑁, 𝑏𝑗𝑗 = 𝛽𝑗𝑗 𝑁, 𝑏𝑗𝑖 = 𝛽𝑗𝑖 𝑁, 𝑏𝑤 = 𝜇𝛽𝑤 𝑁/𝜀.

The left side of the equation shows the instantaneous rate of change of S, E, I, A, R and W at time

Parameters estimation

143

The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.1‒7.0) [2]. As reported

144

by Xu et al[10], the median time from exposure to onset of illness (infected) was 4 days (interquartile

145

range 3-5 days). Another study showed that the mean of incubation period was around 5 days and the

146

period falls within the range of 2-14 days [11]. We set the 5-day as the incubation period and the latent

147

period in this study. Thus,  = ’ = 0.2.

148

Since there was no data on the proportion of asymptomatic infection of the virus, we simulated the

149

baseline value of proportion of 0.5 (p = 0.5). Since there was no evidence about the transmissibility of

150

asymptomatic infection, we assumed that the transmissibility of asymptomatic infection was 0.5 times

151

that of symptomatic infection (  = 0.5), which was the similar value as influenza[12]. We assumed that

152

the relative shedding rate of A compared to I was 0.5. Thus, c = 0.5. Since the SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA

153

virus, we assumed that it could be died in the environment in a short time, but it could stay for a longer

154

time (10 days) in the unknown hosts in the market. We set ε = 0.1.

155

There is a mean 5-day delay from symptom onset to detection/hospitalization of a case (the cases

156

detected in Thailand and Japan were hospitalized from 3-7 days after onset, respectively) [13-15].

157

Another study showed that the mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or

158

isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days without truncation and at 5-9 days when right truncated[11]. As

159

reported by Xu et al[10], the median time from onset of illness to first hospital admission was 2 (range

160

from 1-4) days. A study including 45 patients diagnosed before January 1 was estimated to have a

161

mean of 5.8 days (95% CI: 4.3–7.5) from illness onset to first medical visit[2]. In our model, we set the

162

infectious period of the cases as 6 days. Therefore, γ = γ’ = 0.1667.

163

According the official report by National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, we

164

collected the data of daily fatality from January 24 to 30 , 2020[16]. Therefore, we set f as 0.02348

165

(range: 0.02198-0.03186). In this study, we set the total population as 11,081,000 so that br = 4.266 

166

10 and dr = 3.184  10 based on the 2018 Wuhan Statistical Yearbook (Table 2).

and to estimate the parameter bii, bjj, bij, and bji.

171

Quantification of the age-specific transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2

172
173

In the model the age-specific secondary attack rate (SAR) was employed to quantify the
transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. They were calculated as follows:
𝑆𝐴𝑅𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝑖𝑖 /𝛾
𝑆𝐴𝑅𝑖𝑗 = 𝛽𝑖𝑗 /𝛾
𝑆𝐴𝑅𝑗𝑖 = 𝛽𝑗𝑖 /𝛾
𝑆𝐴𝑅𝑗𝑗 = 𝛽𝑗𝑗 /𝛾

174
175

In the equations, SARii, SARij, SARji, and SARjj refer to the age-specific SAR among age group i,
from age group i to j, from age group j to i, and among age group j, respectively.

176

To quantify the age-specific transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, we also performed a simulation which

177

was named as “knock-out” simulation in our previous study[17]. In this study, the “knock-out” simulation

178

was defined as cutting off the route of transmission between or within different age groups, and was

179

performed in the following scenarios: A) βii = 0; B) βji = 0; C) βij = 0; D) βjj = 0; E) control (no cutting off

180

transmission route).

183

184

perform the curve fitting and the simulation. The simulation methods (Runge-Kutta method of order four

185

with tolerance set at 0.001) were the same as the previously published researches [18-24]. The data

186

was analyzed and figured by using Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) and

187

GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). The goodness of fit was judged by coefficient

191

Since nine parameters (p, , c, , ω, ω’, γ, γ’ and f) in the models were collected from literatures,

192

there might be some uncertainties in our model. Therefore, we performed sensitivity analysis of

193

Epidemiological characteristics and curve fitting of SARS-CoV-2

199

There were 29 COVID-19 cases data collected in Wuhan City from 26 November, 2019 to 23

200

December, 2019, among which 10 cases had a history of the seafood market exposure and 19 cases

201

had no history of the exposure (Figure 2).

202

The mix-age SEIARW model including all age groups fitted the reported data well (χ = 4.77  10 ,

203

P > 0.999). The results of the curve fitting were shown in Figure 3. The results also showed that the bp

204

= 1.1329 and bW = 0.5255. The age-specific SEIARW model fitted with the reported data well by

205

dividing the population into four age groups (χ = 4.99  10 , P > 0.999), and five age groups (χ = 4.85

206

 10 , P > 0.999). Thus, the prevalence of COVID-19 in each age group was simulated in Figure 4.

211

4 (SAR34 = 5.69 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 1 to 2

212

(SAR12 = 0.002 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 3 to 1 (SAR31 = 0.003 per 10 million

214

(SAR13 = 1.08 per 10 million persons) (Figure 5-A).

215

Based on the five-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group

216

4 to 5 (SAR45 = 12.40 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 5 to 4 (SAR54 = 6.61 per 10

217

million persons), from age group 4 to 4 (SAR44 = 5.08 per 10 million persons), and from age group 2 to

218

1 (SAR21 = 4.90 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 3 to 4

219

(SAR34 = 0.0002 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 1 to 1 (SAR11 = 0.22 per 10 million

221

(SAR12 = 1.59 per 10 million persons) (Figure 5-B).

222

The results of the “knock-out” simulation showed that, based on the four-age-group SEIARW

223

model, the scenarios b23 = 0, b32 = 0, and b22 = 0 led to the highest decrease for the number of cases.

224

However, the scenarios b12 = 0, b31 = 0, and b11 = 0 led to the lowest decrease for the number of cases

225

(Figure 6-A). Based on the five-age-group SEIARW model, the scenarios b44 = 0, b45 = 0, and b54 = 0

226

led to the highest decrease for the number of cases. However, the scenarios b12 = 0, b31 = 0, and b11 = 0

227

led to the lowest decrease for the number of cases (Figure 6-B).

Discussion

233

This is the first study to develop an age-specific SEIARW model to quantify the transmissibility of

234

COVID-19 among different age groups. The results showed that our model fitted the reported data well,

235

thus has the capability of estimating or predicting? the age-specific transmissibility of the virus.

236

Based on the four-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred between the

237

age groups 15 – 44 years and 45 – 64 years, among those  65 years, or from 45 – 64 years to  65

238

years. The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 0-14 years to 15 – 44 years, or from 45 – 64

239

years to 14 years. Based on the five-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred

240

between age group 25 – 59 years and  60 years, or among 25 – 59 years. The lowest transmissibility

241

occurred from age group 15 – 24 years to 25 – 59 years, or from age group 0-5 years to 6-14 years, or

242

to 15-24 years. The “knock-out” simulation had the similar results. We concluded that the virus was

243

more likely to transmit among older population.

244

These results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has high transmissibility among adult older than 25 years

245

old or elder people, but has low transmissibility among children or people younger than 14 years.

246

These results were similar to the age-specific transmissibility of influenza A (H1N1)[4]. The age-specific

247

control and prevention interventions are needed.

248

The reasons for the difference of age-specific transmissibility remain unclear. It might be related to

249

the different contact characteristics among different age groups. Adults were more likely to work outside

250

and came into contact with different individuals in work places, buses, subways, or even airplanes.

251

However, children or younger people could stay at home during the outbreak, and they were less likely

252

to get infected, or if they were infected, it was mostly from adults or elder people in the same family.

253

Our findings were based on the parameter estimation and the data from literatures. It is known that

254

the asymptomatic infection of COVID-19 exists. As reported by Bai et al[25], 1 of 6 cases was

255

asymptomatic infected, with the proportion of asymptomatic of 0.17. As reported by Pan et al[26], 2 of 3

256

cases was asymptomatic infected, with the proportion of asymptomatic of 0.67.There was a research

257

showed that the asymptomatic infection would shed SARS-CoV-2 for 5 days[27]. However, there was

258

not enough evidence to provide the clear epidemiological estimates of the parameters p, , ’, and γ’

259

which were related to asymptomatic characteristics. Although there was clinical evidence to calculate

260

the parameters related to symptomatic cases such as incubation period, fatality rate, and duration from

261

symptoms onset to diagnosis[1, 2], more epidemiological data are needed to explore the parameters.

262

However, we performed a sensitivity analysis of all the nine parameters from the literatures, and we

263

found that the models was slightly sensitive to parameters p, , and γ but not sensitive to parameters ,

264

c, ε, f, ’, and γ’. Therefore, our results might be affected slightly by the parameter estimation.

265

Since we could not obtain the first-hand data, the results of our findings might have some

266

uncertainties. However, our study aimed to develop and provide an age-specific transmission model for

267

the public health department who has the big data to investigate the age-specific transmissibility in

268

real world scenarios.

269

Conclusions

270

By calculating the published data, our model showed that SARS-CoV-2 has a high transmissibility

271

among adults and elder people but low transmissibility among children and young people. Our results

272

provide a mathematical model for investigating the age-specific transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. More

273

data and studies are needed to estimate the age-specific transmissibility in real world scenarios to

274

better understand the characteristics of the widely spread virus.
