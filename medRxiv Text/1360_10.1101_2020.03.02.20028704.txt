We monitored the transmissibility of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in Zhejiang

20

accounting the transmissions from imported cases. Even though Zhejiang is one of the worst-

21

affected provinces, an interruption of disease transmission (i.e. instantaneous reproduction

22

numbers <1) was observed in early/mid-February after an early social-distancing response to the

23

outbreak.

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus emerged and caused an outbreak in

27

Wuhan, Hubei province, China (1). The disease responsible for the outbreak has been officially

28

named by the World Health Organization (WHO) as COVID-19. Common clinical manifestation

29

of COVID-19 includes fever, fatigue, dry cough, dyspnea and muscle ache (2).

30

The current global scale health crisis began on 31 December 2019, the day WHO was

31

notified of several unusual cases of pneumonia in Wuhan (3). Despite the suspected source of

32

transmission (Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market) was shut down the next day, number of cases

33

continued to expand at an alarming rate (3). On 9 January 2020, the first related death was

34

recorded in Wuhan (4); meanwhile, the disease spread outside Hubei as people travel around and

35

outside the country. As of 22 February 2020, the epidemic registered 76,392 cases with 2,348

36

deaths in mainland China and spread to 28 countries that reported a total of 1,402 cases (5).

37

To halt the spread of COVID-19, the Chinese government imposed a complete lockdown

38

in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province on 23 January 2020 aiming to quarantine the

39

epicenter of the outbreak (6). Meanwhile, a number of provinces/cities in China have imposed

40

restrictions on entry by travelers from Wuhan in response to the epidemic.

41

Owing to the frequent travel connections between Wuhan and Zhejiang (an eastern

42

province with 57 million residents), Zhejiang is the third worst-affected province with 1,205

43

cases confirmed to date, and the first province to declare the highest provincial level public

44

health emergency in response to the outbreak (23 January 2020); officials closed non-essential

45

public venues, banned funerals and weddings, and ordered suspension of work. Arrivals with

46

travel history to other provinces within last 14 days shall be quarantined. Starting from 1

47

February to 6 February 2020, all the 11 cities in Zhejiang imposed lockdown for partial districts

48

(Zhoushan, Jiaxing, Quzhou, Shaoxing, Lishui, Jinhua, and Huzhou) and a complete lockdown

49

for all districts (Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Taizhou). During the lockdown period, only

50

one person per household is allowed to leave home once every two days for supplies (7). In this

51

study, we estimated the instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 in Zhejiang to

52

monitor the impact of control measures on disease transmissibility over time.

53

The Study

54

We analyzed the data of confirmed cases, including both local and imported cases from

55

26 December 2019 to 25 February 2020, from all cities in Zhejiang. Confirmed cases were tested

56

positive for COVID-19, either through real-time reverse-transcription–polymerase-chain-

57

reaction (RT-PCR) assay or genetic sequencing, in accordance with the WHO guidelines. Cases

58

with travel history to other provinces (with ≥1 case reported) 14 days prior to symptoms onset

59

are defined as import cases. Epidemiological data of confirmed cases were recorded to the

60

database of Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Data were reviewed

61

independently by at least two staffs to ensure data accuracy.

62

Rt is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case at

63

time t in a population and it is a time-varying measure of disease transmissibility when

64

intervention measures are in place for outbreak control. If Rt is below unity, a disease

65

transmission is unlikely to be sustained and the outbreak shall be under control. Rt can thus be

66

used to monitor the disease evolution in a population over time (8). In this study, we employed

67

two different methods to estimate Rt: 1. Wallinga and Teunis approach (M1) (9,10) and 2.

68

susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model-based approach (M2), controlling for

69

transmission arising from imported cases. In M1, we assumed serial interval follows a lognormal

70

distribution with mean 7.5 days and standard deviation 3.4 days (11), whereas in M2, we

71

assumed the mean latent duration and mean infectious duration to be 5.2 (11) and 2.3 days

72

respectively. Using the time series data of local and imported cases, we formulated the

73

likelihoods and solved the model parameter Rt (additional details in the Appendix).

74

The first imported case of COVID-19 had illness onset on 1 January 2020. As

75

importation of infections continued, the first local case had symptoms onset on 10 January 2020

76

(Figure 1). Over the study period, Rt attained peak values of 2.08 (95% confidence interval [CI]:

77

1.49 to 1.72) and 1.88 (95% CI: 1.38 to 2.41) on 16 January 2020 for method M1 and M2

78

respectively (Figure 2), and a majority of cases (60%) was still the imported cases. The Rts

79

remained stable and kept above 1.40 until 28 January 2020, five days after the declaration of the

80

highest-level public health emergency. Although the number of local cases had gradually

81

surpassed that of imported cases, the Rts decreased over time. After the lockdown of cities, the

82

upper bounds of CI of Rt for M1 and M2 were below the threshold of unity on 6 February 2020

83

and 12 February 2020 respectively (M1: 0.91 [95% CI: 0.87 to 0.96] and M2: 0.94 [95% CI: 0.90

84

to 0.98]). The Rts were to be 0.63 (95% CI: 0.60 to 0.65) for M1 and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.75 to 0.82)

85

for M2 on 20 February 2020, the day the last cases were reported to date. Overall, the estimates

86

from two different methods were consistent and showed a similar trend of Rt. An assumption of

87

gamma-distributed serial interval was tested and the results were consistent (Appendix Figure).

88

Conclusions

89

We examined the Rt of COVID-19 to monitor the impact of control measures on disease

90

transmissibility. Taking transmission arising from imported cases into account, disease

91

transmissibility of COVID-19 reached its peak on 16 January 2020 before Zhejiang declared the

92

highest-level public health emergency and the government imposed a lockdown in Wuhan. As

93

suggested by other investigations, approximately 35% of cities in China have ≥50% chance of

94

having a COVID-19 case imported from Wuhan within 3 weeks before the lockdown (12). A fast

95

growth in disease transmission during the initial phase of epidemic can thus be expected,

96

especially in areas that have tight travel connections with the source region (13). Since Rt would

97

surpass unity upon the emergence of only a few imported cases, COVID-19 was able to sustain

98

in Zhejiang during the initial phase of the epidemic. Therefore, early preparation is strongly

99

recommended to countries with limited imported cases at the moment.

100

We showed the transmission of COVID-19 reduced and remained at a low level not only

101

after the lockdown of Wuhan, but also after the implementation of strict social-distancing

102

measures in Zhejiang. As a result, disease transmission in the population was interrupted (Rt<1)

103

within several weeks alongside a drop in local cases. The decline in disease transmissibility

104

might be attributed to the early declaration of public health emergency in Zhejiang, followed by

105

implementation of large-scale lockdowns which seemed to interrupt and slow down the

106

transmission of COVID-19 in the population. Our findings could thus inform high-risk regions

107

on disease control planning in a timely manner.

108

One key limitation of our analysis is that the assumption of serial interval in the

109

estimation is based on earlier estimates from Li et al. (11). The estimates of Rt shall be improved

110

if more updated knowledge of the pathogen are available.
