Abstract
Purpose: Methadone maintenance treatment is a life-saving treatment for people with opioid use disorders
(OUD). The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) introduces many concerns surrounding access to opioid
treatment. In March 2020, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)
issued guidance allowing the expansion of take-home methadone doses. We sought to describe changes to
treatment experiences from the perspective of persons receiving methadone at outpatient treatment
facilities for OUD.
Methods: We conducted an in-person survey among 104 persons receiving methadone from three clinics
in central North Carolina in June and July 2020. Surveys collected information on demographic
characteristics, methadone treatment history, and experiences with take-home methadone doses in the
context of COVID-19 (i.e., before and since March 2020).
Results: Before COVID-19, the clinic-level percent of participants receiving any amount of days’ supply
of take-home doses at each clinic ranged from 56% to 82%, while it ranged from 78% to 100% since
COVID-19. The clinic-level percent of participants receiving a take-homes days’ supply of a week or
longer (i.e., ≥6 days) since COVID-19 ranged from 11% to 56%. Among 87 participants who received
take-homes since COVID-19, only four reported selling their take-home doses.
Conclusions: Our study found variation in experiences of take-home dosing by clinic and little diversion
of take-home doses. While SAMSHA guidance should allow expanded access to take-home doses,
adoption of these guidelines may vary at the clinic level. The adoption of these policies should be
explored further, particularly in the context of benefits to patients seeking OUD treatment.

Key words: methadone maintenance, opioid treatment programs, COVID-19, coronavirus

1. Introduction
Methadone maintenance treatment is a life-saving treatment for people with opioid use disorder
(OUD) (Mattick et al., 2009; Woody et al., 2007). However, the strict requirements of daily in-person,
supervised dosing are often burdensome and time-consuming for people participating in treatment
(Kourounis et al., 2016). Historically, people receiving methadone are sometimes given take-home doses,
however, these doses may be limited to patients with long-term treatment histories and may be provided
in doses lasting only one or two days at a time (Walley et al., 2012).
The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has created an urgency for opioid treatment programs
(OTPs) to respond by ensuring continued access for existing patients, promoting patient safety, and
expanding to new patients (Davis & Samuels, 2020; Del Pozo et al., 2020; Khatri & Perrone, 2020;
Krawczyk et al., 2020; Leppla & Gross, 2020). In March 2020, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration (SAMHSA) issued guidelines allowing expanded use of take-home doses for
more “stable” patients, likely relevant to those who have displayed longer durations of treatment
(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2020).
In an effort to examine changes to methadone take-home policies in the early months of COVID19, we sought to capture experiences of persons receiving methadone at several methadone clinics in
central North Carolina.
2. Methods
We conducted a survey among persons receiving methadone prescriptions at methadone clinics in
central North Carolina on Monday mornings during June and July 2020. We identified all methadone
clinics within a 50-mile radius of Greensboro, North Carolina (n=10) and contacted them in a randomized
order. The first three that agreed to participate were included in the study. Two clinics (Clinics A & B)
were for-profit and one was non-profit. We estimated needing approximately 100 patients to reach
saturation of experiences while balancing COVID-19-related research restrictions. The survey was
developed by the authors and reviewed by persons with lived experience of methadone treatment. The
survey was also reviewed by clinic staff, but no changes were made upon this review.

On-site recruitment and survey administration was conducted by staff from the North Carolina
Survivors Union (NCSU). NCSU is a self-support group of people with lived experience of drug use that
operates a drop-in center and harm reduction program in Greensboro, North Carolina. NCSU staff
approached patients prior or upon entry to the clinic, and while some patients initially declined, some
were verbally encouraged to participate by clinic staff while receiving their dose. Subsequently, several
patients chose to participate upon exiting the clinic. Prior to the survey launch, NCSU representatives
developed a procedural plan for survey recruitment, including verbal scripts and logistical considerations
for on-site recruitment. NCSU representatives approached persons entering the clinic and administered
verbal consent to those indicating interest in survey participation. Surveys were administered in the
waiting room at Clinic A and outdoors at Clinics B and C. Among the three clinics included in our
survey, the percent of persons approached who participated were 79% from Clinic A, 34% from Clinic B,
and 54% from Clinic C. Among persons who provided verbal consent, we administered a one-page paperbased questionnaire asking about participants’ demographic characteristics, methadone treatment history,
receipt of and experiences with take-home doses, and knowledge of peer’s experiences with take-home
doses.
We examined participants’ self-reported experiences before and since COVID-19, which was
defined in both the survey and analysis as before and after March 1, 2020. We estimated the duration of
treatment at the time of March 1, 2020 by subtracting the time occurring between March 1, 2020 and the
date of survey administration from the self-reported duration of the participant’s current treatment
episode. We examined frequencies and percentages of participants’ reported specific characteristics. All
analyses were performed using SAS 9.4.
This study was reviewed and approved by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
Institutional Review Board. People with lived experience were involved in design of the study,
questionnaire development, data collection, and interpretation of data.
3. Results
3.1. Characteristics of Survey Participants

Among 104 survey participants recruited from three methadone clinics in central North Carolina,
54.5% were aged 18-34 years old, 55.9% were men, and 88.2% were non-Hispanic white (Table 1).
Approximately 18.1% (n=17) of participants had been receiving methadone in their current treatment
episode for less than six months, 27.7% (n=26) had been receiving methadone for six to 12 months, and
54.3% (n=51) had been receiving methadone for more than 12 months. When participants receiving takehome doses were asked about the length of their usual days’ supply, 59.8% (n=52) reported their usual
days’ supply was for 1-2 days, 13.8% (n=12) reported 4-5 days, 17.2% (n=15) reported 6-12 days, and
9.2% (n=8) reported more than 12 days.
3.2. Reported Take-Home Dosing Experiences
Among all participants, 68.3% (n=69) had received take-home doses at any point prior to the
beginning of COVID-19-related responses (i.e., before March 2020). This proportion increased to 91.6%
(n=87) receiving take-home doses since the widespread onset of COVID-19. Only six (6.9%) of the 87
participants receiving take-home doses since COVID-19 reported either selling or sharing their doses.
Specifically, four persons (4.6%) reported selling their doses and three (3.4%) reported sharing their
doses. Among participants receiving take-homes doses, 71.3% (n=62) reported storing doses in a childresistant or locked container, 64.4% (n=56) reported having a safe storage location at home, while only
3.4% (n=3) reported that other people residing at their home could access their doses. Among all
participants, regardless of whether they received take-home doses, 14.4% (n=15) reported knowing
someone who gave away doses to help someone else. Only five (4.8%) participants reported knowing
someone who had other people they lived with get into their doses. The most reported hypothetical
reasons for giving away doses included: needing money or drugs (38.5%), helping someone else like a
friend (37.5%), and saving up for travel (28.8%).
3.3. Variation in Take-Home Dosing by Clinic and Treatment Duration
The percent of participants receiving take-home doses before COVID-19 ranged from 56.1% in Clinic C
to 82.1% in Clinic A (Figure 1a). Participants receiving any take-home doses since COVID-19 varied
from 92.6% in Clinic A, 100% in Clinic B, and 78.0% in Clinic C. Participants receiving take-homes of a

week supply or longer (six or more days) since COVID-19 varied from 55.6% in Clinic A, 13.3% in
Clinic B, and 10.5% in Clinic C. While two-thirds of participants with treatment durations longer than 12
months received take-homes prior to COVID-19, 56.3% of participants with treatment duration less than
six months received any amount of take-homes prior to COVID-19 (Figure 1b). When examining the
estimated duration of treatment at the beginning of the widespread COVID-19 response in the U.S. (i.e.
March 1, 2020), the receipt of any amount of take-homes since COVID-19 was 90.0% (n=9) among those
with an estimated treatment duration of less than 6 months at this time, 94.4% (n=17) among those with 6
to 12 months of treatment, and 91.5% (n=43) among those with longer than 12 months of treatment.4.
Discussion
Our study found variation in the proportion of persons receiving take-home doses since COVID19 at several clinics in central North Carolina. While our study is specific to methadone maintenance
treatment in three clinics, these results may suggest a need for a better understanding of how the
SAMHSA directive was implemented during COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic creates substantial
urgency in improving and expanding access to persons seeking OUD treatment (Davis & Samuels, 2020;
Peavy et al., 2020). In addition, COVID-19 presents an opportunity to re-examine dated regulations
surrounding OUD treatment (del Pozo & Beletsky, 2020; Krawczyk et al., 2020).
Given the SAMSHA guidelines allowing expanded access to take-home doses (Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration, 2020), we expected to identify less variation in take-home
practices by clinic. In fact, some survey participants reported preferring when the clinic provided takehome doses every other day, indicating that some clinics may have provided take-home doses at one point
but stopped by the time the survey was administered in June and July 2020. Very few participants
reported selling or giving away their take-home doses. Conversations surrounding diversion have
historically focused on persons selling their methadone doses (Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on
Federal Regulation of Methadone Treatment, 1995). However, our survey suggests selling doses may be
relatively uncommon. In addition, reasons for giving away or otherwise not taking methadone take-homes
as prescribed may follow a much more innocuous narrative than diversion for profit, such as saving up

doses for travel or helping someone else. A continuous focus on diversion as a central rationale for
restricting take-home dosing may increase stigma and further marginalize people who are prescribed
methadone for OUD treatment. Instead, our results suggest the need to examine the benefits of receiving
take-home doses on treatment, recovery, and general well-being of person receiving methadone.
Our study has several limitations. First, due to our study being administered on a single day per
clinic, we did not capture true prevalence of take-home doses overall among survey participants. Rather,
these results can be used to assess variation in persons receiving take-home doses by clinic and treatment
duration. Second, participation in the survey varied by clinic. We believe this was due to some
participants being more strongly encouraged to participate by clinic staff and possibly the location of
survey administration. For example, surveys were administered while participants waited to be seen by
clinic staff at Clinic A, whereas surveys were administered to participants as they entered and exited the
clinic at Clinics B and C. Finally, it is possible social desirability bias was present in the self-report of
sensitive questions, such as those related to diversion or safe storage procedures. Very low (7%)
endorsement of diversion in this survey challenges the loss-prevention orientation of methadone
programs. Yet, given the in-clinic milieu of questionnaire deployment and concerns regarding
repercussions leading to disruptions in treatment, we cannot preclude self-report bias or that respondents
who chose to participate may have self-selected for higher adherence behaviors. Clinic staff were not able
to see individual survey results, possibly mitigating the former. However, our survey was administered by
a separate organization (NCSU) comprised of persons with lived experience of drug use and community
advocates, which may result in participants being be more comfortable disclosing sensitive behaviors to
this group rather than clinic staff.
5. Conclusions
Our findings have implications for evaluations of the SAMHSA pandemic directive. We observed
considerable heterogeneity in take-home practices between clinics, suggesting differences in
interpretation. Additional research is needed to explore the extent and possible reasons of this
heterogeneity in greater detail. Future studies should also consider exploring clinic administrator

perspectives and behaviors. OTPs should reduce barriers to treatment during COVID-19 and consider
expanding access to take-home doses while providing harm reduction messaging to their patients.
Instituting additional barriers to treatment may come at the cost of lives; therefore, we should make
treatment more accessible, not more restrictive.
