Abstract

39
40
41

Methods: Index cases were identified and reported after symptoms onset, and contact tracing was conducted
to collect the data of the associated secondary cases. An interval censored likelihood framework is adopted to
fit a Gamma distribution function to govern the SI of COVID-19.

42
43
44

Findings: Assuming a Gamma distributed model, we estimated the mean of SI at 4.4 days (95%CI: 2.9‚àí6.7)
and SD of SI at 3.0 days (95%CI: 1.8‚àí5.8) by using the information of all 21 transmission chains in Hong
Kong.

45
46
47

Conclusion: The SI of COVID-19 may be shorter than the preliminary estimates in previous works. Given the
likelihood that SI could be shorter than the incubation period, pre-symptomatic transmission may occur, and
extra efforts on timely contact tracing and quarantine are recommended in combating the COVID-19 outbreak.

Introduction

62

As of February 15, there were 56 COVID-19 cases confirmed in Hong Kong [4], and local transmission was
also recognized by the contact tracing investigation. Given the risk of human-to-human transmission, the
serial interval (SI), which refers to the time interval from illness onset in a primary case (i.e., infector) to that
in a secondary case (i.e., infectee) [6-9], was of interested to iterative rate of transmission generations of
COVID-19. SI could be used to assist strategic decision-making of public health policies and construct
analytical frameworks for studying the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.

63
64
65
66

In this study, we examined the publicly available materials released by the Centre for Health Protection (CHP)
of Hong Kong. Adopting the case-ascertained design [10], we identified the transmission chain from index
cases to secondary cases. We estimated the SI of COVID-19 based on 21 identified transmission chains from
the surveillance data and contact tracing data in Hong Kong.

Data and methods

76
77
78

Following previous study [6], we adopted a Gamma distribution with mean Œº and standard deviation (SD) œÉ,
denoted by g(¬∑|Œº,œÉ), to govern the distribution of SI. The interval censored likelihood, denoted by L, of SI
estimates is defined in Eqn (1).

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2, formerly known as the ‚Äò2019-nCoV‚Äô), which has emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019
[1]. The COVID-19 cases were soon exported to other Chinese cities and overseas, and the travel-related risk
of disease spreading was suggested by [2, 3]. Since the first confirmed imported case in Hong Kong on
January 23, the local government has implemented a series of control and prevention measures for COVID-19,
including enhanced border screening and traffic restrictions [4, 5].

As of February 15, there were 56 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong [4], which followed the case
definition in official diagnostic protocol released by the World Health Organization (WHO) [11]. To identify
the pairs of infector (i.e., index case) and infectee (i.e., secondary case), we scanned all news press released by
the CHP of Hong Kong between January 16 and February 15, 2020 [5]. The exact symptoms onset dates of all
individual patients were released by CHP [4], which were publicly available, and used to match each
transmission chain. For those infectees associated with multiple infectors, we record the range of onset dates
of all associated infectors, i.e., lower and upper bounds. We identified 21 transmission chains, including 12
infectees matched with only one infector, that were used for SI estimation.

The h(¬∑) was the probability density function (PDF) of exposure following a uniform distribution with a range
from Tlow to Tup. The terms Tilow and Tiup denoted the lower and upper bounds, respectively, for the range of
onset dates of multiple infectors linked to the i-th infectee. Specially, for the infectees with only one infector,
Tlow = Tup, and thus h(¬∑) = 1. The œÑi was the observed onset date of the i-th infectee. We calculated the
maximum likelihood estimates of Œº and œÉ. Their 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated by using
the profile likelihood estimation framework with cutoff threshold determined by a Chi-square quantile [12].

85
86
87
88
89

In the dataset, the latest onset date of all infectors was on January 31 in contrast to the investigation period up
to February 15. Given the minimum investigation period at (15 ‚Äì 0 + 1 =) 16 days, which is approximately
twice of the SI of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [13], we ignored the right-truncated selection
bias, i.e., ‚Äòinfector-infectee‚Äô pairs with longer SI, due to short investigation period. Therefore, the likelihood
framework defined in Eqn (1) was sufficient for the estimation in this study.

Results and discussion
The observed SIs of all 21 samples have a mean at 4.3 days, median at 4 days, interquartile range (IQR)
between 2 and 5, and range from 1 to 13 days. For the 12 ‚Äòinfector- infectee‚Äô pairs, the observed SIs have a
mean at 3 days, median at 2 days, IQR between 2 and 4, and range from 1 to 8 days. Fig 1 shows the
likelihood profiles of varying SI with respect to Œº and œÉ of SI. By using all 21 samples, we estimated the mean
of SI at 4.4 days (95%CI: 2.9‚àí6.7) and SD of SI at 3.0 days (95%CI: 1.8‚àí5.8). The fitted Gamma distribution
was shown in Fig 2. These estimates largely matched the results in the existing literatures [14, 15]. Limiting to
only consider the 12 ‚Äòinfector-infectee‚Äô pairs, we estimated the mean of SI at 3.1 days (95%CI: 2.0‚àí5.4) and
SD of SI at 1.8 days (95%CI: 1.0‚àí4.7).

Comparing to the SI of SARS with mean at 8.4 days and SD at 3.4 days [13], the estimated 4.4-day SI for
COVID-19 indicated rapid cycles of generation replacement in the transmission chain. Hence, highly efficient
public health control measures, including contact tracing, isolation and screening, were strongly recommended
to mitigate the epidemic size. The timely supply and delivery of healthcare resources, e.g., facemasks, alcohol
sterilizer and manpower and equipment for treatment, were of required in response to the rapid growing
incidences of COVID-19.

As also pointed out by two recent works [14, 15], the mean of SI at 4.4 days is notably smaller than the mean
incubation period, roughly 5 days, estimated by many previous studies [16-19]. The pre-symptomatic
transmission may occur when the SI is shorter than the incubation period. If isolation can be conducted
immediately after the symptom onset, the pre-symptomatic transmission is likely to contribute to the most of
SARS-CoV-2 infections. This situation has been recognized by a recent epidemiological investigation
evidently [20], and implemented in the mechanistic modelling studies of COVID-19 epidemic [3, 21], where
the pre-symptomatic cases were contagious. As such, merely isolating the symptomatic cases will lead to a
considerable proportion of secondary cases, and thus contact tracing and immediately quarantine were crucial
to reduce the risk of infection.

A recently epidemiological study used 5 ‚Äòinfector-infectee‚Äô pairs from contact tracing data in Wuhan, China
during the early outbreak to estimate the mean SI at 7.5 days (95%CI: 5.3‚àí19.0) [17], which appeared larger
than our SI estimate at 4.4 days. Although the 95%CIs of SI estimates in this study and [17] were not
significantly separated, we note that the difference in SI might exist. If this difference was not due to sampling
chance, one of the possible explanations could be the pathogenic heterogenicity in mainland China and Hong
Kong. The SI estimate can be benefit from larger sample size, and the estimates in our study was backed up
by 21 identified transmission chains including 12 ‚Äòinfector-infectee‚Äô pairs, and thus it is likely to be more
informative.

122
123
124
125

Accurate and consistent records on dates of illness onset were essential to the estimation of the SI. All samples
used in this analysis were identified in Hong Kong and collected consistently from the CHP [4, 5]. Hence, the
reporting criteria were most likely to be the same for all COVID-2019 cases, which potentially made our
findings more robust.

126

The clusters of cases can occur by person-to-person transmission within the cluster, e.g.,

or they can occur through a common exposure to an unrecognized source of infection, e.g.,

The lack of information in the publicly available dataset made it difficult to disentangle such complicated
situations. The scenarios (I) and (II) can be covered by the pair of ‚Äòinfector-infectee‚Äô such that we could
identify the link between two unique consecutive infections. Under the scenario (III), we cannot clearly
identify the pairwise match between the infector and infectee, which means there were multiple candidate of
infector for one infectee. As such, we employed the PDF h(¬∑) in Eqn (1) to account for the possible time of
exposure ranging from Tlow to Tup. There is no information available on the SI for scenarios (IV) as well as (V)
due to the onset date of person X is unknown, and thus our analysis was limited in the scenarios (I)-(III). We
note that extra-cautious should be needed to interpret the clusters of cases because of this potential limitation.
Although we used interval censoring likelihood to deal with the multiple-infector matching issue, more
detailed information of the exposure history and clue on ‚Äòwho acquires infection from whom‚Äô (WAIFW)
would improve our estimates.

Longer SI might be difficult to occur in reality due to the isolation of confirmed infections, or to identify and
link together due to the less accurate information associated with memory error occurred in the backward
contact tracing exercise. The issue associated with isolation could possibly bias the SI estimates and lead to an
underestimated result. Due to lack of information in the public dataset, our estimation framework could be
benefit from detailed records on the date of isolation of individual cases. But isolation occurs for all severe
infectious diseases such as SARS and COVID-19, there is no reason to believe that isolation play a bigger role
in one than the other, at least more evidence is needed to support that claim. It is however possible that at the
initial stage the SI is longer than later when strict isolation takes place. Nevertheless, a comparison of
estimated SI for SARS and COVID-19 in Hong Kong is still meaningful. And we found that the SI of
COVID-19 estimated appears shorter than that of SARS, which is the key message. It would be hard to
imagine that isolation is responsible for the difference. There is no reason to believe isolation is more rapid in
cases of COVID-19 than in SARS in Hong Kong, as well as other limitations (would have happened for both).
Thus, the difference we observed for COVID-19 and SARS is likely intrinsic. In conclusion, given the rapid
spreading of the COVID-19, effective contact tracing and quarantine/isolation were even more crucial for
successful control.
