Abstract
Introduction. Given the rapid spread, significant morbidity and mortality associated with
COVID-19, there has been scientific interest in obtaining data detailing the factors
influencing the risk of COVID-19 infection. The aim of this study was to reveal a possible
association between the ABO-RH system and the risk of COVID-19 in the Moroccan
population. Materials and methods. This is an analytical cross-sectional study. It was carried
out on 1094 patients for the diagnosis of Covid-19 by Rt-PCR at the Moulay Ismaïl military
hospital in the province of Meknes. All Rt-PCR negative individuals were used as a
comparison group. Results. Among the 1094 individuals who were diagnosed, RT-PCR for
detection of SARS-CoV-2 was positive for 242 individuals. Comparison of the proportions of
blood groups of the two groups showed that the proportion of blood group A in patients
with COVID-19 was significantly higher than in people in the comparison group (P = 0.007),
while the proportion of blood group O in patients with COVID-19 was significantly lower than
in people in the control group (P = 0.017). Comparison of the Rh blood groups of the two
groups did not find a significant association (P = 0.608). Conclusion: As demonstrated by
several previous studies, we concluded that blood group A was associated with a higher risk
of acquiring COVID-19. Equally, the O blood group was associated with a lower risk of
infection.

named SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2). The disease was
named COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019). March 11, 2020 the World Health
Organization has increased the SARS-CoV-2 of an epidemic in a global pandemic [1].
Based on clinical observations, patient age, male gender and presence of certain underlying
pathologies (primarily cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and
diabetes) have been highlighted as risk factors predisposing to infection with SARS‐CoV‐2
and higher severity [2]. More recently, epidemiological and molecular studies seemed to
report preliminary evidence on a correlation between the risk of contagion by SARS-CoV-2
and the erythrocyte phenotype determined by the ABO-RH system, the exact mechanisms of
which are not yet well determined [3-4]. On the other hand, the association between blood
groups and vulnerability or resistance to certain infectious pathologies has been
demonstrated by older studies.
In this context, we conducted a study on the Association between ABO blood groups and
COVID-19 infection in Moroccan population through patients tested for SARS‐CoV‐2 at the
Moulay Ismail Military Hospital in Meknes.

Materials and Methods
This is an analytical cross-sectional study involving male military people sharing the same
workplaces, for the diagnosis of COVID-19 at the Moulay Ismail Military Hospital, in the
province of Meknes, Morocco. The diagnosis was sought after the appearance of pulmonary
symptoms in a few individuals.
On admission, all individuals underwent a complete physical examination and rapid
serological test for the specific detection of IgM and IgG antibodies against the novel
coronavirus. Sociodemographic, epidemiological and clinical data have been specified on
information sheets. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal
samples was performed by real-time reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) using the GeneFinder COVID-19 PLUS Real Amp Kit (OSANG Healthcare Co, Ltd., Korea)
according to the manufacturer's instructions, on the CFX96 real-time amplification system
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Testing for anti-Sars-Cov 2 antibodies was used to detect old
infection (Rt-PCR negative), and in conjunction with epidemiological and clinical data for
interpretation of questionable results. The ABO-RH blood typing was carried out on a sample
taken from an EDTA tube using an agglutination technique using two complementary tests,
Beth Vincent and Simonin. Our comparison group (COVID-19 negative) was made up of all
individuals with RT-PCR and negative serology.
Statistical analysis was performed using Epi-Info (version 7.2 CDC Atlanta, USA). Proportions
were compared using the chi-square or Fisher's exact test. The means, meanwhile, were
compared using Student's test. A difference was statistically significant for P <0.05. An odds
ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval was used as a measure of association.

Results
This study involved 1094 individuals who were diagnosed with COVID-19. This is a relatively
young male population. The average age was 36.32 years (standard deviation of 7.12 years,
extremes ranging from 22 to 55 years). RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 was positive for
242 individuals. 856 individuals with RT-PCR negative were used as a control group. The
difference between the mean age of patients (35.13 years, SD = 7.189) and that of controls
(36.66 years, SD = 1.070) was significant, which showed that the youngest in this community
were at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (P = 0.003) (Table 1).
The frequency distribution of blood groups A, B, AB and O in the patients was 39.67%,
13.22%, 5.79% and 41.32%, while in the controls it was 30.28%, 12.21%, 5.63%, and 51.88%,
respectively. When blood groups Covid-19 patients were compared with the control group, it
was found that The proportion of blood group A in patients with COVID-19 was significantly
higher than that in control group (39.67% vs. 30.28%, P = 0.007), while the proportion of
blood group O in Covid-19 patients was significantly lower than that of those in control
group (41.32% vs. 51.88%, P = 0.017). These results revealed a significantly increased risk of
COVID-19 for blood group A, with an odds ratio of 1.513 (95% CI 1.125-2.035) and a
decreased risk of COVID-19 for blood group O, with an odds ratio of 0.697 (95% CI 0.5220.931). Comparison of the Rh blood groups of the two groups did not find a significant
association (P = 0.608) (Table 1).

Discussion
Similar to recently reported results, the objective of this work was to research an association
between ABO-RH blood groups and risk of Covid19 in Moroccan population. And to our
knowledge, our study is the first of its kind, in Morocco, to seek this association.
COVID-19 is the latest deadly zoonosis and, since its onset, it has affected millions of people
around the world. So far, several risk factors, including advanced age, male gender, and
presence of chronic underlying co-morbidities, have been established to be attributed to

higher likelihood of being infected with SARS-Cov-2 [5-6]. Inconsistently with published data,
we found that COVID-19 affects younger people more. This can be explained by the way of
life and grouping which follow a hierarchical pattern. Indeed, the youngest are more in
contact in workplaces and share guest rooms for four people or more, while the oldest
(often older) share individual or two-person work spaces, and individual guest rooms.
Comparing the ABO blood groups of our COVID-19 patients with the control group, we found
that there was a significantly increased risk of COVID-19 in patients with blood groups A and
a significantly lower risk for patients with blood group O. This finding was consistent with the
literature data [7-10]. Similar associations have been reported between ABO phenotypes
and susceptibility to several bacterial and viral pathogens, where It can be vulnerability or
resistance. It has been suggested that certain viruses perform their role by binding to ABO
blood antigens. This is the example of Norwalk-like viruses and calciviruses which are spread
by interaction with antigens of the ABO blood group system [11-12]. So for some strains of
rotavirus, they find their way back through the cells of the gastrointestinal tract thanks to
antigens associated with blood group A [13].
The association between the ABO blood group phenotype and the likelihood of being
infected with SARS-CoV, the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),
has been demonstrated. Yufeng Cheng et al. investigated the prevalence of SARS disease
among hospital staff in Hong Kong who were exposed unprotected to infected patients,
finding that people with blood group O had a lower likelihood of infection [14]. Jun Chen et
al. proposed a mechanism by which the coronavirus spike protein (S), heavily N-glycosylated,
bind with high affinity to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [15]. As it has
been shown that the ACE2 is a obligatory cell receptor, although other receptors may
participate in the infection process [15-16]. Patrice Guillon et al. used in vitro cell binding
tests and a mathematical model of cell viral transmission. They claimed that natural or
monoclonal anti-A antibodies specifically inhibited the adhesion of the SARS-CoV (S) Spike
protein to its ACE2 cell receptor [13]. Given the structural similarity between the receptor
binding domains of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [17] and also using the same receptor, ACE2,
to enter target cells [17-18], the aforementioned mechanisms could be extended to SARSCoV-2.
Our study did not find a clear association between the ABO blood group and clinical
expression of COVID-19. Exception was made for headache where patients with AB blood
type were more likely to be (P <0.001). Numerous studies published in this regard indicated
that the ABO blood group does not influence the symptoms of COVID-19 [19-21].
This study had certain limitations which could lead to some bias in the results. First, the
study population consisted exclusively of relatively young males. And second, the lack of
other data (weight, underlying pathologies, smoking, etc.) which are predisposing factors to
the risk of infection with SARS-Cov-2.

Conclusions
As previous studies on COVID-19 and the present study have shown, the statistically
significant association of the ABO blood group and susceptibility to COVID-19 is clear. Blood
group A was associated with a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 compared to non-A blood
groups, while blood group O was associated with a lower risk of infection compared to nonO blood groups . The distribution of blood groups in the population can be useful to
understand the kinetics of the epidemic at the local level and to establish a health policy
aimed at reducing the viral spread. Further studies are needed to determine the exact
mechanism by which the ABO blood group influences susceptibility to COVID-19, which
could be useful in patient management and disease control.
