Abstract

34

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory

35

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now spread to more than 100 countries

36

posing as a serious threat to the public health on a global scale. Patients with

37

comorbidity such as hypertension suffer more severe infection with elevated case

38

fatality rate. Development of effective anti-viral drug is in urgent need to treat

39

COVID-19 patients. Here we report that calcium channel blockers (CCBs), a type of

40

anti-hypertension drugs that are widely used in the clinics, can significantly inhibit the

41

post-entry replication events of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Comparison with two other

42

major types of anti-hypertension drugs, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors

43

(ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), showed that only CCBs display

44

significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy. Combined treatment with chloroquine and

45

CCBs significantly enhanced the anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy. Retrospective clinical

46

investigation of COVID-19 patients revealed that the CCB amlodipine besylate

47

administration was associated with reduced case fatality rate of patients with

48

hypertension. Results from this study suggest that CCB administration for COVID-19

49

patients with hypertension as the comorbidity might improve the disease outcome.

Introduction

55

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative

56

pathogen of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that recently occurred in

57

Wuhan, China in late December 2019 (1, 2). SARS-CoV-2 infection induced similar

58

symptoms with SARS-CoV including fever, cough, dyspnea, etc and can result in

59

multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and death in severe cases (3). The virus has

60

caused a global pandemic transmission posing as a serious threat to the public health.

61

As of Mar 19, 2020, there are over 203,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases with more

62

than 8,100 deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection around the world. Due to its high

63

transmissibility and severe infection outcome, the World Health Organization has

64

declared the SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern. The

65

rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 raises the concern whether it will become a

66

seasonal coronavirus like hCoV-229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, however with a

67

much higher mortality rate. Development of effective anti-viral drugs is urgently

68

needed to contain the current transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and to counteract its

69

potential re-emergence in the future.

70
71

So far, no antiviral drug for SARS-CoV-2 has been officially proved to be effective in

72

treating COVID-19 patients. Compared with de-novo drug development, which

73

normally takes years of development and evaluation, repurposing preexisting drugs

74

that are in clinical use to treat virus infection is one of the most effective strategies for

75

developing drug against emerging viruses (4). Our recent study has reported that

76

remdesivir, favipiravir and chloroquine (CQ) have distinct anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect in

77

vitro (5). Remdesivir was first developed for treating Ebola virus (6), and showed

78

strong anti-SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV activity in vitro (7)and in mouse model (8). A

79

randomized controlled trial has been initiated to assess the efficacy and safety of

80

remdesivir to treat COVID-19 and the result is expected to be released in April (4).

81

Favipiravir is an approved anti-influenza drug for clinical use in Japan and very

82

recently in China. Similar with remdesivir, favipiravir has also being registered in

83

clinical trial to evaluate its efficacy in treating COVID-19(4). CQ is an anti-malaria

84

drug that has been developed in the 1940’s with a safe record in clinical

85

administration (9). Given its approved status it was quickly tested in clinics and a

86

recent study reported its potential benefits in treating COVID-19 patients (10). These

87

progresses strongly support the endeavor of repurposing approved drugs for

88

COVID-19 treatment.

89
90

The most affected COVID-19 patients are the elderly who often have comorbidities

91

such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc (11). These patients suffer

92

more severe infection outcome with significantly higher case fatality rate (11). The

93

current therapeutic regime is largely symptomatic treatment and specific evaluation of

94

drug treatment for COVID-19 patients with different comorbidities is still lacking.

95

Identification of more drug candidates with anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy would help to

96

provide more options from which safe and effective drugs can be selected and/or

97

combined for personalized medication for the patients on an individual level.

99

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are widely used in the clinics for treating

100

hypertension, angina pectoris, supraventricular arrhythmias (12). Recently, CCBs

101

were also reported to have anti-viral effect against several emerging viruses including

102

bunyaviruses, arenaviruses and flaviviruses (13-15). About 30% of SARS-CoV-2

103

patients have hypertension as comorbidity and these patients suffer the case fatality

104

rate of up to 14% (11, 16) urging that effective drug treatment for these patients needs

105

to be evaluated. Recently, a concern was raised about whether administration of

106

anti-hypertension drugs of ARB or ACEI to COVID-19 patients would worsen the

107

disease progression through up-regulation of ACE2 expression level and result in

108

more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (22). In this study we tested a panel of

109

anti-hypertension drugs that are in clinical use and found that the CCBs benidipine

110

HCI and amlodipine besylate have significant anti-viral effect in vitro. Retrospective

111

clinical investigation showed that amlodipine besylate was associated with reduced

112

case fatality rate of COVID-19 patients with hypertension. These results provide

113

valuable reference for selecting drug treatment for COVID-19 patients with

114

hypertension as the underlying comorbidity.

Results:

116

CCBs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.

117

To test whether CCBs can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, Vero E6 cells were treated

118

with a panel of 9 clinically approved CCBs, and then infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a

119

multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05. At 24 hours post infection (p.i.), copy

120

numbers of viral RNA in the supernatant were measured with qRT-PCR (Figure 1A),

121

and the intracellular level of virus infection was monitored by immunofluorescence

122

with an antibody against virus NP protein (Figure 1B). We found that four CCBs,

123

benidipine HCI, amlodipine besylate, cilnidipine and nicardipine HCI, significantly

124

inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication (Figure 1). Experiments with serial concentrations

125

of drug treatment revealed that these four CCBs inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in

126

a dose-dependent manner, without causing strong cytotoxic effect (Figure 2A). The

127

half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of benidipine HCI, amlodipine besylate,

128

cilnidipine, nicardipine HCI were 3.81, 4.17, 11.58 and 13.32 μM, respectively, and

129

the half cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of all four drugs were calculated to be above

130

100 μM. The drug selection index (SI) of these four CCBs was calculated to be >

131

26.25, > 23.98, >8.64 and >7.51, respectively (Figure 2A). Similar inhibition effects

132

of these four CCBs were also observed on the human hepatocyte cell line Huh7

133

(Supplementary Figure S1).

134
135

Since CCBs block intracellular calcium influx, we analyzed whether the

136

anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of CCBs is related with reduced intracellular calcium level.

137

Intracellular calcium level can be reduced through treatment with calcium chelator

138

1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl

139

ester) (BAPTA-AM) or 2-Aminoethyl Diphenylborinate (2APB), a membrane

140

permeable blocker of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-induced Ca2+ release (17).

141

Vero E6 cells were treated with serial concentrations of BAPTA-AM or 2APB, and

142

then infected with SARS-CoV-2. At 24 hours p.i., copy numbers of viral RNA in the

143

supernatant were measured with qRT-PCR. As shown in figure 2B, addition of

144

BAPTA-AM or 2APB also significantly inhibited virus replication in a concentration

145

dependent manner, confirming the dependence role of intracellular Ca2+ for

146

SARS-CoV-2 replication.

147
148

CCB inhibits viral replication at the post-entry stage.

149

To define the event of virus infection that was inhibited by CCBs, time-of-addition

150

assay of drug treatment was performed. The CCB benidipine HCI was chosen for

151

further analysis as it has the lowest effective concentration and the highest SI index of

152

the 4 tested CCBs. Benidipine HCI or 2ABP were added during virus entry, 2-hours

153

post virus infection or through-out virus infection (Figure 3A). The virus production

154

in the supernatant was measured with qRT-PCR and the intracellular NP expression

155

level was determined with western blot and immunofluorescence analysis with the NP

156

antibody. As shown in figure 3B-D, addition of drug through-out virus infection or

157

2-hours after virus entry strongly inhibited virus production, while addition of drug

158

during virus entry did not inhibit virus replication. Notably, compared with drug

159

treatment throughout virus infection, addition of drugs 2-hours after virus entry had

160

slightly lower inhibition efficacy (Figure 3 B,C). Whether this is due to rapid onset of

161

virus replication within the first 2-hours that was not fully blocked by following drug

162

treatment still needs further characterization. Nevertheless, these results indicate that

163

benidipine HCI and 2ABP mainly inhibit virus infection at a stage after virus entry,

164

potentially during virus genome replication/transcription.

165
166

CCBs but not ARBs or ACEIs display inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2

167

replication.

168

Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors

169

(ACEI) and CCBs represent three major types of anti-hypertension drugs that are in

170

clinical use (18). We next analyzed whether the ARB and ACEI anti-hypertension

171

drugs can also inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Representative ARBs (losartan

172

potassium, valsartan) or ACEIs (enalaprilat dihydrate, enalapril maleate) that are

173

widely used in the clinics (18) were chosen for the evaluation of potential anti-viral

174

effect. Vero E6 cells were treated with serial concentrations of drug compounds and

175

infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.05. At 24 hours p.i., viral copy number in

176

the supernatant was measured with qRT-PCR and cell viability was measured with

177

CCK-8 assay. As shown in figure 4, in contrast to the distinct inhibition efficacy

178

against SARS-CoV-2 of CCBs, the selected ARBs or ACEIs did not show any

179

significant inhibition effect. These results suggested that of the three types of

180

anti-hypertension drugs only CCBs have significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy.

181
182

Combined application of chloroquine (CQ) with CCB resulted in enhanced

183

anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect.

184

CQ was recently reported to inhibit the entry stage of SARS-CoV-2 replication (5).

185

Considering that CCB may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at the post-entry stage, we analyzed

186

whether the combined application of CQ and CCB would lead to a more distinct

187

inhibition effect. CQ and CCB were added separately or in combination to the Vero

188

E6 cells followed by virus infection with SARS-CoV-2 at the MOI of 0.05. At 24

189

hours p.i., copy numbers of viral RNA in the supernatant were measured with

190

qRT-PCR and the intracellular level of virus infection was monitored by

191

immunofluorescence with the NP antibody. As shown in figure 5, while separate

192

application of CQ or benidipine HCI resulted in distinct reduction of virus replication,

193

the combined application of benidipine HCI and CQ further enhanced the

194

anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy (P < 0.001).

196

Administration of amlodipine besylate is associated with reduced case fatality

rate in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.

198

In order to evaluate whether CCBs have therapeutic effect in COVID-19 patients, we

retrospectively analyzed the medical record of 487 adult COVID-19 patients with

200

hypertension, including 225 had been admitted into the Tongji Hospital from January

201

17 to February 14, , and 262 had been admitted into the Union Hospital from January

202

10 to March 30, 2020. Of these patients 331 concurrently had other underlying

203

comorbidities such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebral

204

infarction, etc, 56 had no information on antihypertensive treatment, and 10 were still

205

in the hospital. The 90 patients, who only had hypertension as the comorbidity and

206

were either discharged from the hospital or deceased, were included for the

207

retrospective analysis. Among these patients 44 received amlodipine besylate, 16

208

received nifedipine, 4 received other CCBs, 17 received other antihypertensive drugs

209

(including ARBs, ACEIs, β-blockers, and thiazide), and 9 had no anti-hypertension

210

drug treatment. No patient was found receiving benidipine HCI treatment. All the

211

patients who did not receive amlodipine besylate were defined as non-amlodipine

212

besylate treated patients. For amlodipine besylate treated and non-amlodipine besylate

213

treated patients, the median (IQR) age was 67 (59.5-72) and 65 (57-74) years, and the

214

median (IQR) delay from symptom onset to hospital admission was 10 (7-14) and 8.5

215

(6-13.5) days, respectively. Both of the two variables showed no significant

216

inter-group difference. The female proportion was lower in amlodipine besylate

217

treated patients (37.0%) than that (59.1%) in non-amlodipine besylat treated patients,

218

(P = 0.036, Supplementary information, Table S1). The frequencies of clinical

219

manifestations that were recorded before or at admission, including fever, cough,

220

feeble, chest distress, shortness of breath, and gastrointestinal symptoms, were

221

comparable between the two groups (all P > 0.05, Supplementary information, Table

222

S1). Compared to the non-amlodipine besylate treated group, the amlodipine besylate

223

treated group had lower serum levels of total bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase (P =

224

0.047 and P = 0.015, respectively; Supplementary information, Table S1). All other

225

laboratory parameters tested at admission were comparable. The commonly

226

prescribed therapies during hospitalization included antibiotics, antiviral agents,

227

traditional Chinese medicines, corticosteroids, and respiratory support. The

228

amlodipine besylate treated group had lower frequency of antibiotics and higher

229

frequency of corticosteroids (P = 0.028 and P = 0.006, respectively; Supplementary

230

information, Table S2), while other therapies were observed with comparable

231

frequencies between the two groups.

232
233

For the primary outcome of mortality, a beneficial effect in reducing the case fatality

234

rate (CFR) was observed in patients receiving amlodipine besylate, with the CFR

235

being significantly decreased from 26.1% (12/46) in non-amlodipine besylate treated

236

group to 6.8% (3/44) in amlodipine besylate treated group (P = 0.022). Kaplan-Meier

237

analysis similarly demonstrated reduced risk of death in amlodipine besylate treated

238

group, in comparison with non-amlodipine besylate treated group (P = 0.033, log-rank

239

test; Figure 6A). The effect amlodipine besylate treatment of on CFR remained

240

significant with the use of Cox regression model by adjusting for age, sex, the delay

241

from symptom onset to hospital admission, and therapies administration (hazard ratio

242

(HR) 0.182, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.037-0.897, P = 0.036; Table 1). Further

243

analysis showed that the CFRs were higher in all other patient groups, with 12.5%

244

(2/16) in patients receiving nifedipine, 25.0 (1/4) in patients receiving other CCBs,

245

41.2% (7/17) in patients receiving other anti-hypertension drugs, 22.2% (2/9) in

246

patients without receiving anti-hypertension drugs. When compared to the patients

Discussion

250

Depending on the studies, around 13-30% of COVID-19 patients have hypertension

251

as the underlying comorbidity (11, 16, 19). The case fatality rate of this group of

252

patient is calculated to be 6%, which is more than 6-fold higher than the CFR of

253

people without underlying comorbidity (0.9%) (19). In Wuhan, where the proportion

254

of patients with critical conditions is higher, the CFR of patients with hypertension

255

can be up to 14%. Effective medication is needed for treatment of this group of

256

patients. ARBs, ACEIs and CCBs are three major types of anti-hypertension drugs

257

that are widely used in the clinics. It was reported that the ARBs or ACEIs, such as

258

losartan, olmesartan, lisinopril, etc, lead to significantly higher cardiac ACE2 mRNA

259

level in animal model (20, 21). Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses ACE2 as its entry

260

receptor, this raises the concern whether administration of these two types of drugs

261

would lead to higher expression level of ACE2 and result in more severe virus

262

infection (22). We showed here that, of the three types of anti-hypertension drugs,

263

only CCBs such as, benidipine HCI or amlodipine besylate, showed potent

264

anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro. The retrospective clinical investigation of 90

265

COVID-19 patients with hypertension further revealed the beneficial effect of

266

amlodipine besylate administration with reduced CFR (6.8%, n=44). In contrast,

267

patients received ARBs/ACEIs/-blockers/thiazide as anti-hypertension drugs had the

CFR of 41.2% (n=17) and the general CFR of this group of patient is 16.7% (n=90).

These results together suggest that CCBs, such as amlodipine besylate, may be more

271

comorbidity.

272
273

The therapeutic mechanism of CCBs against COVID-19 still awaits further

274

investigation. Several pathogenic viruses, such as Zika virus, dengue virus, H5N1

275

avian influenza virus, etc, induce intracellular calcium influx to facilitate virus

276

infection (23, 24). The elevated intracellular calcium level is associated with

277

pathogenesis mechanisms including induction of mitochondrial dysfunction and cell

278

death which will result in triggering of strong inflammatory responses (25-27).

279

Consistently, CCBs were reported to have anti-inflammatory efficacy through

280

regulating intracellular calcium level in patients and to decrease mortality in septic

281

animal models with excessive inflammatory responses (28, 29). Particularly,

282

amlodipine besylate has been shown to decrease levels of inflammatory markers and

283

oxidative stress compared to baseline in patients with hypertension (30). Excessive

284

inflammatory responses are reported to be associated with COVID-19 fatal outcome

285

(11). It is possible that, besides inhibiting virus replication, CCBs may also function

286

through alleviating inflammatory responses in the patients to achieve the clinical

287

benefits in a synergistic way with its anti-viral efficacy.

288
289

Recently, CCBs have been reported to inhibit replication of several emerging viruses

290

including Ebola virus, Marburg virus (31, 32), Junin virus(14), and severe fever with

291

thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) (33). Particularly, CCB treatment was

292

reported to be associated with reduced CFR among SFTS patients (13). Here we show

293

that, similar with SFTSV, CCBs inhibit the post-entry events of SARS-CoV-2

294

replication. Although the exact inhibition mechanism still needs further investigation,

295

it is possible that CCBs block the virus-induced intracellular calcium influx and

296

impair calcium dependent cellular pathways that are critical for virus replication. This

297

way CCBs may function as a host-oriented drug that inhibits virus replication through

298

regulating virus-dependent host machinery and the chance for occurrence of resistant

299

mutants is lower compared to anti-viral drugs that target specific virus constituents

300

(34). This would be highly valuable for developing drugs against RNA viruses such as

301

SARS-CoV-2 as these viruses generally have a high mutation rate.

302
303

CQ has been shown to efficiently block SARS-CoV-2 entry in vitro and emerging

304

evidences showed that administration of CQ has beneficial effects for COVID-19

305

patients in clinics. It was also reported that administration of CQ can reduce overall

306

inflammation in several conditions with little toxicity (9). Whether CQ also alleviates

307

the excessive inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients is currently unknown.

308

Nevertheless, the significantly enhanced anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy upon combined

309

application of CQ and CCB indicates that dual administration of these two drugs may

310

achieve a more pronounced therapeutic effect. Several clinical trials are currently

311

ongoing for analyzing the therapeutic effect of CQ in COVID-19 patients. Whether

312

there are patients that have received combined drug treatment of CQ and CCB would

313

be interesting for evaluation.

315

Results from this study suggested that CCB amlodipine besylate is associated with

316

reduced case fatality rate of COVID-19 patients with hypertension. COVID-19

317

patients with several comorbidities besides hypertension may have a more

318

complicated underlying condition, and therefore was not included in the current study.

319

Thus the therapeutic potential may only be applicable to the patients with

320

hypertension as the only comorbidity. Evaluation with a larger patient cohort would

321

further verify the potential therapeutic effect of the CCB. Additionally, dosing,

322

side-effects and drug-drug interactions of the CCBs, similar with any drug that is in

323

clinical use or testing, should be rigorously evaluated before clinical benefits can be

324

more formally concluded.

393

for medical record of comorbidities and related therapeutic drugs by a trained research

394

medical staff, and the COVID-19 patients who had hypertension were recruited into

395

the study. Patients, who had other comorbidities, such as coronary heart diseases,

396

cerebral infarction, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary

397

tuberculosis, chronic kidney disease, and malignancy, were excluded. The research

398

protocol was approved by the human ethics committee of the hospital in accordance

399

with the medical research regulations of China (TJ-IRB20200102), and oral informed

400

consents were obtained from all patients or patients’ family members.

401

Data collection

402

Data about demography, clinical manifestations, and laboratory testing results were

403

retrospectively collected by reviewing medical records and entered into standardized

404

database. Medication use during hospitalization including information on

405

antihypertensive drugs (i.e. calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers,

406

and diuretics) was also recorded. Serial throat swabs were collected for the testing of

407

HCoV-19 RNA with the use of RT-PCR during the patients’ hospitalization.

(A) For “Full-time” treatment, Vero E6 cells were pre-treated with compounds for 1

609

hour, and then infected with virus. At 2 hours p.i., the supernatant was removed, and

610

the cells were cultured with compound-containing medium until the end of the

611

experiment. For “Entry” treatment, Vero E6 cells were pre-treated with compounds

612

for 1 hour, and then infected with virus. At 2 hours p.i., the supernatant was removed,

613

and the cells were cultured with fresh culture medium until the end of the experiment.

614

For “Post-entry” experiment, Vero E6 cells were infected with virus, and at 2 hours

615

p.i., cells were treated with compound-containing medium until the end of the

616

experiment. For all these experiments, Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2

617

at an MOI of 0.05, and virus copy number in the supernatant was quantified by

618

quantitative RT-PCR (B) and NP expression in infected cells was analyzed by western

619
