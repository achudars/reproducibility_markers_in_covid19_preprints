ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
The novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) infected coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) was broken out in Wuhan and Hubei province for more than a month. It
severely threats people's health of thousands in Chin and even other countries. In
order to prevent its wide spread, it is necessary to understand the development of the
epidemic with precise mathematical language.
METHODS
The various data of novel coronavirus pneumonia were collected from the official
websites of the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.

According to epidemic and administrative division, three groups were divided to
analyze the data, Hubei Province (including Wuhan), nationwide without Hubei and
Henan Province. With classic SIR models, the fitting epidemiological curves of
incidence have made, and basic reproduction number (R0) was also calculated as well.
Therefore the disease's infection intensity, peak time and the epidemiological end time
can be deduced.
RESULTS
(1) Wuhan was the origin place of the epidemic, then it spread to Hubei province
quickly. The patients in Hubei had increased rapidly with exponential rise. According
to data in Hubei province, the fitting parabolas were made, and some with 51,673
cases. R0 curve shows with S-curve, at early breakout, R0 was as high as 6.27, then it
decrease gradually. It is expected to approach to zero in early May; (2) In the group of
nationwide without Hubei, the patient cases were much lower than Hubei, but its
epidemiological fitting curve also shows a parabola as Hubei. The peak will arrive
around February 10 with 9,145 cases. At beginning, R0 was as high as 2.44, then it
decreases gradually and approach to zero in the end of March. (3) In Henan Province,
the incidence stays very low, the parabolic fitting curve is similar to the nationwide
without Hubei. The epidemic is expected to reach the peak on around February 12 and
end in early April.
CONCLUSION
The epidemic development in all three groups shows parabolic curves. Their
incidences are expected to reach their peaks on February 18 in Hubei, on February 10
in other areas of China. The epidemic will end in early May in Hubei, and in early
April in other areas of China. Our study may provide useful knowledge for the
government to make prevention and treatment policies.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious
epidemic. The patients show systemic immunity decrease severely and strong
respiratory symptoms with high death rate.1 The epidemic was first discovered in

Wuhan, Hubei Province with strong infectiousness through multiple transmission
routes, and some cases even show without any typical symptoms, bringing us a big
problem for its prevention and control.2 3 World Health Organization (WHO) officially
listed it as a “public health emergency of international concern”4 By February 16,
2020, China had confirmed 70548 patients cumulatively. Its so quick spread benefited
from homecoming during Spring Festival, about 5 million people ever left Wuhan, the
origin of COVID-19’s outbreak, for hometown before the city was closed on January
23, and 9 million people still remained in Wuhan. In these way, the 5 million people
became source of infection to other ares in China. On the other hand, the disease
broke out among the 9 million people in closed Wuhan. The epidemic has severely
affected people’s lives and national economy. Over the past month, medical workers,
scientists and governments adopted a serial powerful measures to treat patients and
stop the epidemic spread. However, the number of infections is still growing in
Wuhan and other areas of China, and there is a tendency to expand to the other
countries.5

In order to prevent its widespread outward, it is necessary for us to

understand the epidemiological development of the epidemic with a mathematical
model. Recently, MedRxiv has published patients’ R0 value, it estimated R0=3.77

）

(95% CI: 3.51- 4.05) in suspected patients and 3.00 (95%CI 2.82-3.20 in confirmed
patients.7 In our study, using classic Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) soft,
according current epidemic data, some important parameters, such as infection
coefficient, removal coefficient and basic reproduction coefficient, were calculated.
Than the fitting curves of incidence were drawn with peak time and end time of the
epidemic. In addition, the dynamic values of R0 (Basic Reproduction Number) were
also described as well. The several curves can help us to forecast the epidemic
development. It will be useful for us to take targeted interventions to control the
epidemic as soon as possible.
Methods
All data came from the official websites of National Centers for Disease
Control and National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China. The

confirmed cases were diagnosed according to the criteria of the COVID-19’s
diagnoses and treatments, which were suggested by National Health Committee,8 9
including history of exposure, clinical symptoms (especially CT imaging) and
positive nucleic acid test. Data were grouped into three according to their
administrative division and epidemic condition as well: (1) Hubei Province (including
Wuhan city), the group was defined, since it was the outbreak place of the disease and
the closed province to prevent epidemic spread; (2) China without Hubei or
nationwide except Hubei, it was set up, since its epidemic was infected by 5 million
people from Wuhan before the closure of Wuhan city; (3) Henan Province, it was
defined since Henan Province is the most populous province in China, with more than
100 million population, and frequent population exchanges with Wuhan.
Basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated.10 R0 refers to how many persons
can be infected by a patient. If R0> 1, the disease will spread away soon and radially;
R0 <1 means the infection is in controllable situation. So, 1 is regarded as an
important threshold to distinguish whether the disease will spread or not.11 During the
epidemiological development of the disease, R0 is changeable. The dynamic
reproduction number is called Rt (Effective Reproduction Number). In order to
prevent and control epidemic, we must find a way to reduce Rt below 1 as much as
possible. Chain growth rate was also calculated in various groups. Generally it refers
to a growth rate relative to previous period. The formula is: Chain growth rate =
(value in current period-value in last period) / (value of last period)x100%. Chain
growth rate represents the growth speed of the data. The larger chain growth rate is,
the greater growth rate is. The negative value represents a negative growth rate.
Excel soft was used to record data and calculate some parameters, such as
incidence and chain growth rate. In the meantime, using MATLAB software and SIR
mathematical model, the parabolic epidemiological curves were simulated according
to data. In fact, the fitting curve is tried to imitate the reality as much as possible. In
addition, the curves of Rt were drawn as well. Finally, results were compared among
three groups, Hubei Province, China without Hubei Province and Henan Province. P
values were calculated as well, and P<0.05 refers to statistical signification.

Results
According to original data, actual scatter plots were made. In fact, in early
COVID-19 outbreak, either patient number or incidence increased with exponential
curve in all three groups (table 1). For instance, from January 20 to February 17, the
cases increased quickly from 270 to 59989 in Hubei province, and equivalently the
incidence rise from 0.46x10-5 to 101.38x10-5. In Henan province, the cases increased
from 0.00 to 1257, equivalently the incidences rise from 0.00 to 1.31x10-5. In the
meantime, in nationwide without Hubei (China without Hubei), the incidences rise
from 0 to 0.93x10-5. Compared with Hubei, in nationwide without Hubei has been
maintained at low level, but epidemiological curve showed exponential increase
similar to Hubei province. The cumulative incidences rate and chain growth rates are
showed in figure 1 and figure 2. The incidence rate increased in Hubei province,
compared with other area, and the increased speed in Hubei was faster than other
areas in China.

According to known data, the best parabolic fitting was made for three groups
(Figure 3, 5 & 7). With SIR model, a series of differential equations were solved, then
fitting curves were made to approach to reality infinitely. In figure 3, the simulated
curve in the Hubei Province fitted well with actual scatter plots. At beginning, the
infected patients increases and reaches a peak with 51,673 cases around on February
18, then the curve decrease. After continually decreasing, the infected patients will
maintain at lowest level in early May, suggesting the epidemic will eventually end
(P<0.05). Figure 4 also shows that Rt change in Hubei Province with S type curve. It
starts from 6.27 and decreases gradually to 1 around on February 18, and it is
expected to approach 0 in the end of April and early May (P<0.05).
The parabolas were also fitted in the group of other areas of China and group
of Henan province (Figure 5 & 7). The two groups were very similar, and the patient
cases reach peak approximately on February 10, 2020. At peak, the infected patients
are expected to 9145 cases and 931 cases respectively. After peak, the cases will
gradually decrease, reaching the bottom in early April 2020. After that time, the
epidemic will end. Figures 6 and 8 show that Rt values in nationwide without Hubei
and Henan Province with S type. The values started at 2.44 and 2.9, and decreased to
less than 1 after February 12th. They are expected to be close to 0 at the early April.
Fig. 9 shows the infected patients among various groups.
Discussion
The epidemic development of COVID-19 shows a parabolic change. Since
COVID-19 is highly transmissible and severely ill, scientists hope to understand its

epidemiological development and forecast its future eagerly. Read et al. ever tried to
calculate the disappear time of the epidemic.12 Since almost epidemics show their
epidemiological development with classic parabolic distribution, therefore, SIR soft is
designed according to the distribution. SIR is widely used to construct a mathematical
model to understand the epidemic’s transmission and outcome of the diseases. Our
results showed that COVID-19 followed parabolic distribution as well, but the
infection, peak time and disappear time are different among various areas. Among the
three groups, the patients reach their peaks approximately on February 10 (nationwide
except Hubei) and February 18 (Hubei province) successively. Then the epidemic will
disappear in early April (Nationwide without Hubei) and early May (Hubei province).
Our estimation has some difference from Read et al. For instance, the peak value and
cumulative cases seem to be less than theirs, and the ending time that we predict
happens early. The differences may be caused by the data from different time and
different source. Our data are relatively late and came from official publication. It
should be acknowledged that our mathematical model is not perfect. Considering the
sudden onset and some human intervention during the spread, our study only provides
a rough description for the development of COVID-19 pneumonia.
R0 is valuable parameter to evaluate the epidemic transmission capacity. WHO
has predicted that R0 of this novel coronavirus transmission ranged from 1.4 to 2.5.13
Using exponential growth model, R0 of

SARS-CoV-2 in the early outbreak of

Wuhan was estimated 2.24 (95% CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95% CI: 2.89-4.39).14 With
other methods, R0 was estimated to be 2-5,15-17 harmonizing with R0 of SARS-CoV
(R0: 2-5),18 19 which is slightly lower than Middle East respiratory syndrome (R0:
2.0-6.7).20 In our study, R0 ranges from 2.44 to 6.27, higher than previous studies
above, suggesting the strong transmission for the disease. After February 18, R0 goes
to less than 1, suggesting the transmission becomes weak.
Hubei especially Wuhan is plagued by the epidemic. SARS-CoV-2 has 79.5%
similar sequences.21 with SARS-CoV coronavirus and 51.8% similarity with
MERS-Cov.22 but NCP’s sudden outbreak and rapid spread

is much higher than

SARS or MERS-CoV. For COVID-19’s outbreak, Hubei’s situation is the most

serious in China. The infected patients is listed at No. 1 in the country, and by
February 17 the cumulative cases are up to 59989 . The epidemic also develops very
quickly, and in early onset its rising curve is very steep. The cumulative incidence rate
is much higher than other areas of China. According to the fitting curve, the peak will
arrive on February 18, several days later than other areas in China. In the meantime,
the disappear time of epidemic will delay until early May, one month later than other
areas. The epidemic period with more than half year in Hubei also lasts much longer
than other areas in China. On the other hand, in nationwide without Hubei and Henan
province, the number of patients and incidence rate have been kept at a relatively low
level. In terms of contagion, at beginning, R0 in Hubei is 6.27, much higher than 2.44
in other areas of China. In this way, we can conclude that Hubei is serious stricken
regions of the epidemic. There are several reasons to explain these differences
between Hubei and other areas. (1) Hubei is origin of the plague, and the earliest
cases were found in Wuhan. It is these patients who cause the widespread. (2) In early
epidemic stage, the disease’s jeopard and its infectious capacity have not been caused
sufficient attention, therefore, the interventions are ineffective and inadequate. (3)
Closed cities accelerate the disease transmission in Wuhan and Hubei, although the
path of outward transmission is cut off. After January 23, Wuhan city and Hubei
province started to close cities successively. In this way, about 60,000,000 people
were limited in Hubei province. This makes Hubei become a closed infection system,
which is bound to accelerate the spread of the disease. On the other hand, about 5
million people left Wuhan before the cities were closed, although the 5 million people
became source of infection to other areas in China, the biggest source of infection is
cut off. Fortunately, in Hubei, more interventions were accepted, for example calling
on the citizens to stay at home.23 In this way, further transmission each other
decreases, and the epidemic is slowed down. Due to reasons above, Hubei Province
should be regarded as the plague hardest hit area and must acquire more medical
supports. Luckily, more medical teams from all over the country have been sent to
Wuhan city and Hubei province, and more and more effectively diagnostic kits and
medicines can meet the Hubei’s needs gradually.

The epidemic forecast is important for NCP prevention. Our epidemiological
model has guiding significance for COVID-19 prevention. At present, closed
management of towns and communities is carried out in many areas throughout the
country. Many traffic are blocked, and works, schools and markets are suspended,24
which has brought extremely inconvenience for citizens. Citizens look forward to a
rapid improvement in this situation. Probably, our study is helpful to solve the
problems above. The epidemiological model shows: from February 10 to 18, the
confirmed patients will reach their peaks in various areas successively, and after that
dates, the epidemic will be improved. Rt will also approach 0 after April in nationwide
without Hubei and after May in Hubei province. It means that the epidemic will end
without infection, suggesting the closed management can be lifted after May in Hubei
and April in other areas of China, then citizens can return to normal work and life.
In summary, with classic SIR models, the fitting epidemiological curves have
made to simulate the occurrence, development and end of novel coronavirus
pneumonia in China, and R0 is calculated as well. Our study shows: (1) The epidemic
development shows parabolic curves, and the incidence is expected to reach its peaks
on February 10 in nationwide without Hubei and on February 18 in Hubei province
successively. The epidemic will end after May in Hubei and after April in other area
of China. (2) In early outbreak of epidemic, R0 was as high as 2.44-6.27, and with
epidemic development, Rt will decrease and finally approach 0 after April in
nationwide without Hubei and after May in Hubei province. (3) According to the data
above, we suggest the closed management in city and community should be lifted
after May in whole China. Without epidemic infection, citizens return to their normal
work and life.
