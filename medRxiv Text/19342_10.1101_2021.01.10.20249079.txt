Abstract:

Background: The central role in the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), called as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), infection is
attributed to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). ACE-2 expressing respiratory system
involvement is the main clinical manifestation of the infection. However, literature about the
association between the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
infection and higher ACE-2 expressing kidney is very limited. In this study, we primarily
aimed to investigate whether there is a kidney injury during the course of SARS-CoV-2
infection. The predictive value of kidney injury for survival was also determined.
Methods: A total of 47 participants who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study.
The participants were classified as ‘‘COVID-19 patients before treatment’’ ‘‘COVID-19 patients

after treatment’’, ‘‘COVID-19 patients under treatment in ICU’’ and ‘‘controls’’. The
parameters comorbidity, serum creatinine and cystatin C levels, CKD-EPI eGFR levels, KIM1 and NGAL levels, urine KIM-1/creatinine and NGAL/creatinine ratios were statistically
compared between the groups. The associations between covariates including kidney disease
indicators and death from COVID-19 were examined using Cox proportional hazard
regression analysis.
Results: Serum creatinine and cystatin C levels, urine KIM-1/creatinine levels, and CKDEPI, CKD-EPI cystatin C and CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C eGFR levels exhibited
significant difference in the groups. The causes of the difference were more altered kidney
function and increased acute kidney damage in COVID-19 patients before treatment and
under treatment in ICU. Additionally, incidences of comorbidity and proteinuria in the urine
analysis were higher in the COVID-19 patients under treatment in ICU group. Urine KIM1/creatinine ratio and proteinuria were associated with COVID-19 specific death.
Conclusions: We found that COVID-19 patients under treatment in ICU exhibited extremely
higher levels of serum cystatin C, and urine KIM-1/creatinine and urine NGAL/creatinine
ratios. These results clearly described the acute kidney damage by COVID-19 using
molecular kidney damage markers for the first time in the literature. Lowered CKD-EPI,
CKD-EPI cystatin C and CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C eGFR levels were determined in
them, as well. Urine KIM-1/creatinine ratio and proteinuria were associated with COVID-19
specific death. In this regard, considering kidney function and kidney damage markers must
not be ignored in the COVID-19 patients, and serial monitoring of them should be considered.

Introduction:

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which is now
called as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization, involves
the respiratory tract as the primary target in most of the cases and has been known as the latest
pandemic of the modern world [1, 2]. The main clinical manifestation of the disease ranges
from asymptomatic course to severe pneumonia [2]. The central role in the pathogenesis is
attributed to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). It enables viral entry into the target
cells [3]. It is not surprising that SARS-CoV-2 easily settles down to one of the highest ACE2 expressing tissues in the body and infects primarily respiratory system and lung which puts
it into the respiratory system virus family [3, 4]. However, various tissues outside the lung
have ACE-2 expression [3] including the kidney proximal tubule cells [3, 5].

In this context, the kidney is a potential target for SARS-CoV-2 infection. To date, there is no
analytical study based on the assumption that the kidney is potential target of COVID-19. In
the present study, we primarily aimed to investigate whether there is a kidney injury during
the course of COVID-19 through a prospective analytical study with a pilot design. The
secondary aim was identifying the predictive value of several kidney function parameters and
damage markers for survival of COVID-19 patients.

Materials and Methods:

Study design and setting, and participants
A prospective, pilot study was conducted at a tertiary center declared as pandemic hospital in
Istanbul/Turkey by Turkish Ministry of Health (TMOH). A total of 75 patients with
confirmed and probable COVID-19 diagnose and 11 healthy controls were prospectively
evaluated between April and May 2020.

All the participants selected from urology and ICU departments of our hospital. Inclusion
criteria were being more than 18 years old males and females, laboratory confirmed COVID19 patients immediately after their treatment, highly suspected COVID-19 patients with
specific computerized tomography (CT) imaging findings [6] before treatment and laboratory
confirmed COVID-19 patients under the treatment in intensive care unit (ICU). Controls were
selected from healthy individuals without any clinical or laboratory findings consistent with
COVID-19. The presence of end-stage renal disease, previous kidney surgery history,
presence of acute urinary tract infection, and presence of current urinary stone disease were
the exclusion criteria. Patients with solitary kidney and urogenital malformation, and
pregnant, puerperant and lactant patients were also not included in the study.

Diagnosis of the COVID-19 was confirmed on the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab
samples with real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) in our
genomic laboratory. We performed the RT-PCR according to manufacturer’s instructions
(Coyote Bioscience Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). Suspected COVID-19 cases were determined
using latest updated version of our national COVID-19 guidelines [7]. Suspected cases with
specific lung CT findings [6] were termed as highly suspected COVID-19 cases. We again
used latest updated version of our national COVID-19 guidelines to determine the treatment
algorithms, as well. Initially, we stratified the participants into the four groups as ‘‘highly
suspected COVID-19 cases before treatment’’, ‘‘confirmed COVID-19 patients after
treatment’’, ‘‘confirmed COVID-19 patients under treatment in ICU’’ and ‘‘controls’’.
Confirmed COVID-19 patients after treatment group was generated from the COVID-19
patients who were treated in the specific COVID-19 clinic and did not require ICU admission.
We applied the recommended treatment algorithms immediately after the nasopharyngeal and
oropharyngeal swab sampling, as the molecular test results required a few days which may

result in delay of the treatment. Therefore, to create a further ‘‘confirmed COVID-19 patients
before treatment group’’, highly suspected COVID-19 cases have been included even before
their molecular test results had been provided. In this group, blood and urine samples were
collected before starting to treatment. In the second group including confirmed COVID-19
cases with molecular test, sample collection was performed immediately after finishing the
five days treatment course. In the third group, samples were collected at fifth day of treatment
in ICU. Blood and urine samples were collected from the controls, as well.

Outcomes
Outcomes of interest were; transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 into the urine, incidence of
acute kidney injury (AKI) in COVID-19 patients, effects of SARS-CoV-2 on kidney injury
markers including serum cystatin C, and urine Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin
(NGAL) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) levels. The effects of SARS-CoV-2 on
kidney function tests including serum and urine creatinine levels, CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney
Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) creatinine, CKD-EPI cystatin C and CKD-EPI
creatinine-cystatin C equations levels, and proteinuria and hematuria were also evaluated. The
survival analysis and determining of the potential predictor parameters for specific mortality
of the COVID-19 were secondary outcomes of interest.

Data source/measurement, parameters
The demographic characteristics, laboratory data and medications were extracted from our
prospectively noted and/or past medical records. AKI was defined as an increase in serum
creatinine by 0.3 mg/dl within 48 hours or a 50% increase in serum creatinine from baseline
within 7 days according to the KDIGO criteria [8]. Venous blood samples were collected
from the participants to test serum creatinine and cystatin C levels. After the centrifuge of the
blood samples for 10 minutes at 4000 g, serum was obtained and serum levels of creatinine
and cystatin C were determined using a photometric test on a AU5800 clinical chemistry
analyzer (Beckman Coulter Inc. Brea, CA, USA) and nephelometric test on Immage 800 Rate
Nephelometer (Beckman Coulter Inc. Brea, CA, USA), respectively. Then, we estimated GFR
(eGFR) using the CKD-EPI equations, where Scr is serum creatinine and Scys is serum
cystatin C;
CKD-EPI: 141 × min(Scr/κ,1)α × max(Scr/κ,1)−1.209 ×

α is −0.329 for females and −0.411 for males, min is the minimum of Scr/κ or 1, and max is
the maximum of Scr/κ or 1.
CKD-EPI cystatin C: 133 × min(Scys/0.8)−0.499 × max(Scys/0.8)−1.328 ×

where κ is 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males, α is −0.248 for females and −0.207 for males,
min indicates the minimum of Scr/κ or 1, and max indicates the maximum of Scr/κ or 1.

Single voided morning urine samples and single morning urine samples from urethral catheter
were obtained from the patients in stable condition and controls, and patients in ICU,
respectively. Spot urine KIM-1 and NGAL levels were determined by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using specific Human KIM-1 ELISA kit (SinoGeneClon
Biotech, Hangzhou, China) and specific Human NGAL ELISA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Rockford, IL, USA), respectively. Urine creatinine levels were determined using a
photometric test on a AU5800 clinical chemistry analyzer (Beckman Coulter Inc. Brea, CA,
USA). Spot urine protein and red blood cells (RBC) estimations were performed by FUS200/H-800 automated urinalysis system with flow cell digital imaging technology (Dirui
Industrial Co., Ltd., Changchun, China).

After obtaining of the RT-PCR tests results, the diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed for all
of the highly suspected cases. The participants divided the two main groups as COVID-19
patients and controls, and then, divided to four final groups as ‘‘COVID-19 patients before
treatment’’, ‘‘COVID-19 patients after treatment’’, COVID-19 patients under treatment in
ICU’’ and ‘‘controls’’. The parameters age, body mass index (BMI), comorbidity, serum
creatinine and cystatin C levels, CKD-EPI, CKD-EPI cystatin C and CKD-EPI creatininecystatin C eGFR levels, urine creatinine, KIM-1 and NGAL levels, urine KIM-1/creatinine
and NGAL/creatinine ratios were statistically compared between the groups. Urine Ph levels
and incidences of proteinuria and microhematuria were also compared.

Based on our comparative statistical results, several covariates were selected for KaplanMeier survival and Cox regression analyses. The compared parameters exhibiting p values ≤
0.1 were considered as covariates. These covariates were age, comorbidities, serum creatinine

and cystatin C levels, urine KIM-1/creatinine and NGAL/creatinine levels, and CKD-EPI,
CKD-EPI cystatin C and CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C eGFR levels.

Data analysis
Due to the lack of associated data in the literature, a minimum number of participants for
sample size could not be calculated and instead of this, a pilot study has been designed. All of
the above mentioned parameters of the participants were investigated without any missing
data. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS Version 22.0 statistic software package
(IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Data distributions and test of normality were evaluated with
Shapiro-Wilk test. Descriptive statistic methods (mean±standard deviation and
median±interquartile range) were used to evaluate data. We compared the normally
distributed and not normally distributed parametric data between the main groups using
independent t and Mann-Whitney U tests, respectively. In the analysis of the final groups, we
used the One-Way Anova and Kruskal-Wallis tests, respectively. For post-hoc analysis of the
One-Way Anova and Kruskal-Wallis tests, we used the Tukey’s and Mann-Whitney U tests,
respectively. Chi-square test was also used in the comparison of the nonparametric categorical
variables. The associations between covariates including kidney disease indicators and death
from COVID-19 were examined using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.
In multivariable model, we assessed interactions of kidney disease indicators with COVID-19
specific mortality after adjusting the parameters had ≤ 0.1 p values in the univariable analysis
results. The adjusted parameters were age, sex and comorbidities. Differences were
considered as significant at two-sided P < 0.05 and 95% confidence interval.

Results:

Demographics and baseline characteristics
A total of 47 participants who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. Among
them, 36 (78.3%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 and remaining were the controls. Of the
participants, 26 (55.3%) were male and remaining (44.7%) were female. The mean age of the
study cohort was 55.77±17.47 years. Twenty-six participants (55.3%) had comorbid diseases
and 15 of them had multiple comorbidity. The mean ages were 59.78±17.11 and 42.64±11.51
years in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and controls, respectively (p=0.003). In patients
with COVID-19, male/female ratio was 18/18, whereas it was 8/3 in the controls (p=0.30).
Among the COVID-19 patients, 21 (58.3%) had at least a comorbidity and 13 (36.1%) had
multiple comorbidity; whereas 5 (45.5%) of the controls had at least one comorbidity and 2
(18.2%) of them had multiple comorbidity (p=0.50 and p=0.46, respectively) (Table 1). The
median duration from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 3.5 (2-6) days in the COVID19 patients. The median duration from onset symptoms to ICU admission and from
hospitalization to ICU admission were 4 (3-8) and 3 (1-4) days, respectively. The most
common symptoms at onset of the disease were fever (n=30, 81.1%), fatigue and myalgia
(n=21, 56.7%), and cough (n=17, 46%). The others were diarrhea (n=11, 29.8%), headache
and dizziness (n=11, 29.8%), and shortness of breath (n=10, 27%). All of the COVID-19
patients had specific CT findings in their chest CT imaging. All of the patients, except one, in
the COVID-19 patients before treatment group were treated in the specific COVID-19 clinic
and discharged uneventfully after a median 4.5 (4-9) days of hospital stay. One patient died
(7.69%) from COVID-19 on his 5th day of treatment. The median duration of the hospital stay
was 5 (5-20) and 13.5 (7-20) days for the COVID-19 patients after treatment group and
COVID-19 patients treated in ICU group, respectively. Eleven patients (91.7%) died from
COVID-19 in the COVID-19 patients treated in ICU group and one patient was discharged
after 15 days treatment in ICU. The entubation rate was 58.3% in the COVID-19 patients
treated in ICU. The median time from admission to ICU to entubation and duration of
entubation period were 5 (1-9) days and 12 (2-16) days.

Urine RT-PCR test, acute kidney injury, and kidney function and damage parameters
SARS-CoV-2 was detected in urine sample just in one COVID-19 patient (2.78%) in our
cohort. The patient age was 80’s who had previous hypertension history. His baseline creatine

value was 1.61 mg/dL. He exhibited AKI with 2.45 mg/dL serum creatinine level. The highest
level of the serum creatinine was detected as 3.59 mg/dL. His kidney injury and function
parameters did not show significant differences when compared to other COVID-19 patients
under treatment in ICU. The incidence of AKI could not be evaluated in the COVID-19
patients before treatment group, because of the lack of the baseline serum creatinine values.
Overall AKI incidence was 16% in the COVID-19 patients. Table 2 provides separate AKI
incidences in the COVID-19 patients before treatment and COVID-19 patients in treated in
ICU groups. Serum cystatin C levels were detected significantly higher in patients with
COVID-19. Moreover, kidney function parameters CKD-EPI, CKD-EPI cystatin C and CKDEPI creatinine-cystatin C eGFR levels were significantly higher in the COVID-19 patients
compared to the controls (Table 1). In the urine analysis, micro-hematuria was detected in the
16 samples and one sample of the patients with COVID-19 and controls, respectively
(p=0.03). Similarly, 17 of the COVID-19 patients had proteinuria whereas the controls had
any (p=0.004) (Table 1).

In the comparative analysis of the final groups, the mean ages were 56.46±15.95,
51.00±14.91, 71.42±14.62, and 42.64±11.51 years in the COVID-19 patients before
treatment, COVID-19 patients after treatment, COVID-19 patients under treatment in ICU
and control groups, respectively (p<0.001). The post hoc analysis revealed that higher mean
age of the COVID-19 patients under treatment in ICU accounted for the difference. Serum
creatinine and cystatin C levels, urine KIM-1/creatinine levels, and CKD-EPI, CKD-EPI
cystatin C and CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C eGFR levels exhibited significant difference in
the groups (Table 3). The post hoc analysis revealed the causes of the difference were
COVID-19 patients before treatment and COVID-19 patients under treatment in ICU groups
More altered kidney function and increased acute kidney damage in these patients were
responsible for the difference. Additionally, incidences of comorbidity and proteinuria in the
urine analysis were higher in the COVID-19 patients under treatment in ICU group (Table 4).

In the COVID-19 patients before treatment group, median serum creatinine level significantly
decreased and mean CKDEPI eGFR level significantly increased at the end of the treatment.
On the other hand, nevertheless, these parameters got worse in COVID-19 patients under
treatment in ICU (Table 5).

The mean age, median serum cystatin C level, mean CKD-EPI level, and median urine KIM1/creatinine and urine NGAL/creatinine levels were significantly higher among patients who
were died because of COVID-19 compared to survivors of COVID-19 (Table 6). Incidences
of comorbid diseases and proteinuria were also significantly higher in died COVID-19
patients.

Association of kidney function and damage parameters with COVID-19 specific death
Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly higher COVID-19 specific death
rates for elderly patients and for patients with altered kidney function and abnormal kidney
damage markers, including elevated serum cystatin C level, elevated CKD-EPI, CKD-EPI
cystatin C and CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C eGFR levels, and elevated urine KIM1/creatinine and urine NGAL/creatinine levels (Figure 1). Univariate Cox regression analysis
showed that age above 65 years was associated with COVID-19 specific death. In addition,
the kidney function and damage markers including elevated serum cystatin C level, elevated
urine KIM-1/creatinine and NGAL/creatinine levels, CKD-EPI eGFR levels, and proteinuria
were also associated with COVID-19 specific death (Table 7). After adjusting for age, sex,
and comorbidities, the parameters urine KIM-1/creatinine ratio and proteinuria of any degree
were associated with COVID-19 specific death (Table 8).

Discussion:

In the recent literature, it is reported that kidney involvement is frequent in COVID-19.
Abdominal computerized tomography scan of the COVID-19 patients showed reduced
density in the kidneys, indicating the inflammation and oedema [9]. About 40% of the
COVID-19 patients may have proteinuria and haematuria on hospital admission [10].
Increased blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels were reported in 14% and 10% of
the hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In some of these patients, even if they not diagnosed
with AKI at admission, during the hospitalization they could be gradually worsened and
diagnosed as AKI [10]. According to the recent literature, AKI incidence in hospitalized
COVID-19 patients ranges from 8% to 22% [11].

It is well known that, apart from the alveolar cells in the lungs, many other tissue express
ACE2. For instance, the heart, the gut and the kidney has considerable ACE2 expression
levels [12]. The National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI) Gene database
reports that, in the human body, the kidney is the fourth highly ACE2 expressing organ
following the small intestine, duodenum and gall bladder, respectively [13]. Testis, heart and
colon are the other highly ACE2 expressing organs. ACE2 expression level is much higher,
nearly 100 fold, in the kidney than that in the respiratory organs [13]. In the kidney, the brush
border of proximal tubular cells is the main source of the ACE2 expression. To a lesser
extent, podocytes express ACE2. But it is not or scarcely any expressed in glomerular
endothelial and mesangial cells [14]. In a recent study based on single-cell transcriptome
analysis, Pan et al. [15] investigated 42,589 cells from 15 normal kidney samples and showed
that proximal straight tubule cells and podocytes expresses ACE2 highly. However, it is still
under debate whether ACE2 expressing kidney is targeted and affected by SARS-CoV-2
infection. On the other side, several current reports showing the co-occurrence of AKI with
COVID-19 [9, 11, 16, 17] suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have a tropism for the kidney. In
this regard, a recent study by Diao et al.[18] is quite remarkable. The study showed that one
of the specific targets for SARS-CoV-2 is the kidney tissue. The authors found specific
SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in the kidney specimens and they found that viral antigens
accumulated in kidney tubules as a result of postmortem tissue analysis. They concluded that
SARS-CoV-2 directly infect human kidney tubules to induce acute tubular damage. In their
opinion, beside direct cytotoxicity, it also initiate macrophage and complement mediated
tubular pathogenesis secondary to accumulated viral antigens. Similarly, based on their

findings, Pan et al. [15] also concluded that the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 on
proximal straight tubule cells and podocytes may cause AKI in patients with COVID-19.

Recent evidences provide that AKI is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in
COVID-19 patients. It is considered a marker of disease severity and a negative prognostic
factor for survival, as well [11, 17, 19, 20]. Although the possible mechanism of kidney injury
by SARS-Cov-2 and COVID-19 associated AKI are well described in the literature, concrete
evidence for acute kidney damage in COVID-19 patients is still lacking. Aditionally,
available data on COVID-19 associated AKI are reporting incidence on the basis of case
series, retrospective studies and a few prospective studies. All of those studies, determined the
AKI based on the serum creatinine levels without using accepted acute kidney damage
markers [10].

In this prospective pilot study, we investigated the incidence of AKI prospectively in the
COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we examined the acute kidney damage markers to obtain a
concrete evidence in terms of COVID-19 associated acute kidney damage. Further, we used
these markers in addition with the other kidney function parameters including serum
creatinine level, eGFR levels and urine analysis in the prediction of COVID-19 specific
mortality by using survival analysis. We observed that the incidence of AKI as 16% in
hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The incidences were 15.38% and 16.66% in the
COVID-19 patients after treatment group and COVID-19 patients under treatment in ICU
group, respectively. Due to the lack of the baseline values prior the disease onset, AKI
incidence could not determined in the COVID-19 patients before treatment group. We
revealed impaired eGFR levels in patients with COVID-19 compared to controls, as well.
Additionally, the incidences of micro-hematuria and proteinuria were significantly higher in
the COVID-19 patients. Impairment in the kidney function was significantly higher in the asyet-untreated COVID-19 patients and COVID-19 patients under treatment in ICU. The
incidences of micro-hematuria and proteinuria were also higher in those patients. These
findings support that COVID-19 affects kidney functions adversely and proportionally with
severity of the disease. Besides, we showed the considerable recovery in kidney function with
the treatment of COVID-19.

This is the first study investigating the kidney damage markers in COVID-19 patients. We
found that COVID-19 patients under treatment in ICU exhibited extremely higher levels of

serum cystatin C, and urine KIM-1/creatinine and urine NGAL/creatinine ratios. These results
clearly described the acute kidney damage by COVID-19 using molecular kidney damage
markers for the first time in the literature. Lowered CKD-EPI, CKD-EPI cystatin C and CKDEPI creatinine-cystatin C eGFR levels were determined in them, as well.

Currently, it has been reported that kidney disease on admission and AKI during
hospitalization were associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death [17]. In our study,
indicators of altered kidney function and kidney damage were significantly higher in died
COVID-19 patients compared the survived ones. Our univariable Cox regression model
indicated that kidney function parameters and damage markers could predict the survival
outcomes of COVID-19 patients. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidity, we found
that urine KIM-1/creatinine ratio and proteinuria were associated with COVID-19 specific
death. In this regard, considering kidney function and kidney damage markers must not be
ignored in the COVID-19 patients, and serial monitoring of them should be considered.
Moreover, impairment in the kidney function and/or emerging kidney damage should alert
clinicians during the management of COVID-19 patients.

The present study has several limitations. First, our cohort has small number of patients.
However, we intended to obtain our pilot findings about COVID-19 associated functional
impairment in the kidney and kidney damage in default of sufficient data in the literature.
Second, even we performed adjusted analysis, other parameters and covariates than our
investigated might have played a role on survival analysis. In other respects, our study has
some strengths. One of them is, serial monitoring of the serum creatinine levels with available
accurate baseline values. Second one is the use of molecular kidney damage markers which
could indicate functional alteration in the kidney prior the elevation of serum creatinine
levels. This provided us to clearly describe the acute kidney damage by COVID-19 for the
first time in the literature. Classification of the COVID-19 patients as before treatment, after
treatment and under treatment in ICU might have provided more accurate findings, therefore,
it may be accepted as other strength. Finally, this is the first study investigating the predictive
role of kidney damage markers in determining the survival outcomes of the patients with
COVID-19.
