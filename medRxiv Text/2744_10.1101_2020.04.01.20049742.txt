Abstract

18

In response to the mounting threat of COVID-19, we added questions to an ongoing food

19

preference study held at Louisiana State University from March 3-12 of 2020. We asked 356

20

participants: (1) In your opinion, how likely is it that the spread of COVID-19 (the coronavirus)

21

will cause a public health crisis in the United States? (2) How concerned are you that you will

22

contract COVID-19 by attending events on campus? Participants’ estimates of an impending

23

national health crisis increased significantly during the study’s second week (March 9-12) while

24

concern about personally contracting COVID-19 from attending campus events increased only

25

marginally during the study’s final days. We find those expressing a higher likelihood of an

26

impending national crisis were more concerned about contracting COVID-19 by attending

27

campus events, suggesting a possible transmission from perceptions of national-level events to

28

perceived personal vulnerability via local exposure.

29

perceived that COVID-19 would likely cause a public health crisis yet did not express concern

30

about contracting COVID-19 from event attendance. These participants were significantly more

31

likely to be younger students who agreed to participate in response to recruitment using same-

32

day flyer distribution. Women expressed a higher likelihood of an emerging national health

33

crisis, although they were not more concerned than men that attending campus events would

34

result in virus contraction. Other groups (e.g., white, students younger than 25, highest income

35

group) displayed similar concern about a national-level crisis, yet were significantly less

36

concerned about contracting COVID-19 from attending campus events than others.

37

participants randomly assigned to information emphasizing the national impacts of food waste

38

expressed significantly greater concern of contracting COVID-19 by attending campus events.

39

These results provide some initial insight about how people perceived national and personal risks

40

in the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis in Louisiana.

Introduction

43

Individual perceptions of personal and national threats posed by the transmission of SARS CoV-

44

2 and its sequalae (COVID-19) have undoubtedly shaped the public’s initial response to and

45

ultimately the speed and geographical diffusion of the most disruptive public health crises in the

46

past century[1]. Cowper[2], responding to unfolding events in the United Kingdom, notes that

47

public reaction to national level communications will critically impact how the pandemic

48

unfolds. Bagnoli, Lio and Sguanci [3] showed that individual perception of infection risk is a

49

critical parameter for predicting the spread of epidemics and argued for inclusion of such

50

perceptions in epidemiological models. Zhang, Deng and Zhang [4] analyzed minor differences

51

in COVID response times across Chinese provinces during early 2020 and found that a single-

52

day delay in provincial response significantly increased the newly confirmed case rate by 2.2%

53

which translates to on average of 497 more confirmed cases per 10,000 population per square

54

kilometer. Rapid response ultimately relies upon broad-based compliance by the population,

55

which stems from the perceived risk of the evolving phenomenon from each individual.

56

Previous research has documented several empirical regularities in human response

57

during epidemics. For example, Moran and Del Valle’s [5] meta-analysis revealed that women

58

were about 50% more likely to adopt non-pharmaceutical protective responses (e.g., mask

59

wearing, hand washing) during respiratory epidemics. de Zwart et al. [6] studied results from

60

surveys during the Avian Influenza (AI) epidemic and found Dutch participants were more likely

61

to undertake preventative actions among those who were older, had less formal education, had

62

obtained a flu vaccine, perceived higher severity of AI, perceive greater vulnerability to AI, and

63

thought more about AI. During the H1N1 influenza epidemic in Korea, Park et al. [7] found

64

female students reported higher perceptions of illness severity and of personal susceptibility to

65

infection than men.

66

However, little is currently known about how individuals assess the national and personal

67

risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic during critical communications windows. To our

68

knowledge, the only study that examines perceptions of the COVID-19 threat come from surveys

69

in China documenting demographic correlates of psychological impacts caused by the COVID

70

crisis [8]. These authors find that women, students, those reporting specific physical symptoms

71

and those with unfavorable self-rated health reported significantly greater psychological impacts

72

of COVID-19.

73

In this article, we share results from responses gathered during a study conducted on the

74

campus of Louisiana State University from March 3 to March 12, 2020, a period closely

75

preceding the closure of in-person classes and events on its Baton Rouge campus. In response to

76

the mounting threat of COVID-19 in the United States, we added two exit questions to an

77

ongoing in-person food preference study being held on campus. We asked 356 participants: (1)

78

In your opinion, how likely is it that the spread of COVID-19 (the coronavirus) will cause a

79

public health crisis in the United States? and (2) How concerned are you that you will contract

80

COVID-19 by attending events on campus? We juxtapose the evolution of responses to these

81

questions with official government pronouncements concerning COVID-19.

82

83

these questions and participant demographic characteristics as well as experimental treatments

87

Methods

88

Measurement

89

Data were collected from participants in an ongoing study focused on understanding consumer

90

food choice and consumption behavior during midday meals (11:00 AM – 2:00 PM). Students,

91

staff and faculty of Louisiana State University (LSU) were recruited to participate in a study held

92

at the campus’s Food Sensory Services Lab in which they would be offered a choice among

93

several commercially prepared lunch options. They were provided a fixed budget for lunch and

94

kept any unspent budget as cash compensation. After providing informed consent, participants

95

moved to isolated, individual kiosks with a computer to answer an online survey in which

96

information treatments were randomly assigned and subjects chose among a series of competing

97

lunch options. One of the participant’s preferred lunch options was delivered by staff to the

98

kiosk. Upon completing the meal, staff removed the food tray and the participant completed an

99

online exit survey via the kiosk computer that focused on satisfaction with the provided meal and

100

personal information.

101

The food preference study initially began on February 17, 2020. In late February, as

102

concerns about the spread of COVID-19 in the United States increased, we added questions to

103

the exit survey (S1 Appendix) to understand if these events were altering the profile of

104

individuals who chose to participate in the study. Two questions were added: (1) In your

105

opinion, how likely is it that the spread of COVID-19 (the coronavirus) will cause a public health

106

crisis in the United States? (National Likelihood); and (2) How concerned are you that you will

contract COVID-19 by attending events on campus (Local Vulnerability)? Participants answered

108

these questions in sessions from March 3 to March 12, 2020, the final day of the study. LSU

109

continued all in-person classes and food service operations through March 13, 2020, and no

110

official announcements were made regarding the cancellations of any on-campus activities

111

before the end of our last study session (2: 00 PM March 12th) [9]. At 4:00 PM on March 12th,

112

2020, LSU’s official communications regarding COVID-19 first mentioned the cancellation of

113

on-campus classes starting from the week of March 16th

114

cancellation of non-class activities involving 30 people or more immediately at 11:30 AM on

115

March 13, 2020 [11]. For reference, a national emergency was declared in response to COVID-

116

19 the afternoon of March 13, 2020 [12].

118

The sample includes the 356 participants enrolled from March 3 through March 12, 2020.

119

Individuals were recruited via pre-existing email recruitment lists, flyers circulated on campus,

120

advertising announcements on classes, and advertisements in university locations. Inclusion

121

criteria included age 18 years or older with no dietary restrictions to beef products.

122

Analysis

123

Results are analyzed in Stata (version 16). The focal variables relating to COVID-19

124

were captured using a 5-point Likert scale. When more convenient for exposition or analysis,

125

these responses are simplified into binary variables (very or moderately likely/concerned = 1; all

126

other responses = 0). We also define the variable National, Not Local to equal one when

127

participants think a national crisis is very or moderately likely but are neither very nor

128

moderately concerned about contracting the virus by attending campus events.

University classes, =0 otherwise), household income, race, health insurance status, recycling

131

frequency, experience with food composting, previous knowledge of food waste as an issue,

132

whether they are trying to eat healthier, and whether they attended the session in response to in-

133

person flyer distribution on the experiment date (as opposed to alternative recruitment such as

134

emails or class announcements). Randomly assigned between-subjects experimental elements

135

included in the analyses include whether participants received information about food waste (vs.

136

screen time, Food Waste Info); received information about improving nutrition (vs. financial

137

literacy, Nutrition Info); received meals with more vegetables (vs. fewer, Vegetable Group);

138

received meals on a large plate (vs. smaller, Large Plate); received meals on a compostable plate

139

(vs. plastic, Compostable Plate); and received menus where the vegetable was listed at the top in

140

the description of the offering (vs. lower, Veg Top of Menu). More detail and context concerning

141

the experimental elements are included in the Supporting Information (S2 appendix). The day of

142

the study (e.g., March 3, March 4, etc.) is also controlled in all analyses. Descriptive statistics

143

for the variables appear in Table 1.

144

To model the Likert-scale response to the two COVID-19 perception questions, an

145

ordered logit regression model is estimated with the aforementioned explanatory variables. The

146

National, not Local response pattern model is estimated with a logit regression. Classification

147

tree analysis is conducted for the binary version of the Local Vulnerability, where the Gini

148

improvement measure is used as the splitting criteria [13]. Three participants are omitted from

149

several analyses because of item non-response on at least one variable, leaving an effective

150

sample size of 353. Statistical significance was set at the 5% level with results at the 10% level

151

deemed marginally significant.

This study was approved by the Louisiana State University AgCenter and Ohio State

161

University Institutional Review Boards. All participants signed informed consent forms after

162

being briefed on the study and having any questions answered by research staff. The two

163

questions added on March 3, 2020, were granted post-hoc IRB approval.

day of the study. No randomly assigned experimental elements were significant, though several

239

(food waste information, provision of compostable plates) were marginally significant.

240

Local Vulnerability was significantly and positively associated with National Likelihood

241

such that a participant’s concern with contracting COVID-19 from attending campus events was

242

greater as the individual participant’s likelihood of a national public health crisis increased. We

243

modelled National Likelihood as an explanatory variable for Local Vulnerability because the

244

Local Vulnerability question was asked immediately after the National Likelihood question.

245

Personal characteristics that are positively associated with Local Vulnerability include being 25

246

years or older (regardless of student status) and identifying with a race other than white or black.

247

Those in the highest income category ($100,000 or more) displayed significantly lower Local

248

Vulnerability than those earning less than $15,000 per year. Participants that were randomly

249

assigned the food waste information treatment (rather than the screen time information

250

treatment) also reported significantly higher Local Vulnerability. The variables capturing the

251

day of the study were not jointly significant, and only March 10 and 12 were individually

252

marginally significantly different from the omitted first day of the study.

253

Only two variables were significant in the regression model for National, Not Local.

254

Older (≥25 years), non-students were less likely to feature this response pattern than younger

255

students while those who attended the experiment in response to in-person flyers were more

256

likely to feature this response pattern. No experimental treatments were significant, nor were

257

there any significant differences by the day of the study.

277

whether they reported income less than $15,000 with the proportion in that lowest income group

278

expressing Local Vulnerability being twice as high. For those attending March 9 or earlier, those

279

randomly assigned to receive compostable plates were 72% more likely to express Local

280

Vulnerability than those randomly assigned to other treatments.

281

Among those identifying with groups other than white, non-Hispanic, self-reported

282

recycling frequency was the next classification variable, with those reporting that they never

recycle expressing less Local Vulnerability than most other branches. Those randomly receiving

284

food waste information on any date were also in a branch with high Local Vulnerability as were

285

those not receiving food waste information so long as it was on March 12th, the final day of the

Discussion

289

As Poletti et al. [22] noted, the spread of epidemics can be dramatically delayed or

290

mitigated if individual perception of the risk of the epidemic is sufficiently large and leads to

291

reduced community contact. The authors emphasize that earlier public warnings about the

292

epidemic can lead to dramatic reductions in peak prevalence and the final size of the infected

293

population. Our analysis suggests that for LSU students, staff and faculty participating in a

294

standard campus-based study unrelated to the topic of infectious disease, a majority of

295

participants thought a national public health crisis from COVID-19 was moderately or very

296

likely even on March 3, the first day of our data collection, a date upon which the number of

297

cases nationally was reported to be 80 [14]. Nine days later, when the number of reported

298

national cases exceeded 1600 [14], nearly 90% of participants displayed National Likelihood,

299

with a significant jump in this perception compared to the first study day occurring at the

300

beginning of the second week of the study (March 9).

301

Regression analysis reveals some personal characteristics significantly associated with

302

National Likelihood that align with the previous literature, e.g., women perceive a national

303

public health crisis as more likely than men [23-24]. Other significant associations have no

304

precedent in the extant literature, e.g., participants who are trying to eat a healthier diet are

305

significantly negatively associated with National Likelihood.

306

spurious, or it may reflect a more nuanced relationship between dietary and health aspirations

307

and national public health perceptions that we are unable to disentangle given the post-hoc nature

308

of this analysis vis a vis the COVID-19 questions. For example, the result might reflect that

309

those desiring to eat healthier have been exposed to wide-spread nutrition misinformation in the

310

media, which has recently included unfounded claims that healthy eating or certain supplements

311

reduce the likelihood of developing COVID-19. Indeed, the proliferation of dubious nutritional

312

products has resulted in federal warnings to several companies promoting unproven nutrition-

313

based remedies and preventatives for COVID-19 [25]. This might indicate reduced perceived

314

risk of acquiring infectious disease among healthy eaters in our sample, based on these factors,

315

although further investigation is required.

This result may simply be

316

In Poletti et al.’s [22] model of epidemics, the spread is highly sensitive to the translation

317

of risk perception to self-prophylaxis measures, such as social distancing, which slows

318

community spread. While we did not elicit explicit measures of such behaviors, we did assess

319

participants’ perceived vulnerability to contracting COVID-19 from attending campus events,

320

(Local Vulnerability), which may signal a willingness to undertake social distancing and other

321

beneficial behaviors and be a behavioral precursor. The first insight from observing the raw data

322

plot in Figure 2 is that Local Vulnerability persistently lags National Likelihood, and does not

323

significantly exceed the 50% mark until the last day of the study, which is the first day after the

324

state of Louisiana had declared a public health emergency, but before LSU had cancelled classes

325

or campus events.

326

Regression analysis confirms that national level perceptions are associated with perceived

327

local vulnerability, as the National Likelihood variable in the Local Vulnerability regression

328

features a large, significant and positive coefficient. In addition, participants 25 or older and

329

those identifying with races other than white and black are more likely to express Local

330

Vulnerability, while those in the highest income category expressed lower Local Vulnerability

331

than those in the lowest income bracket. These results largely align with other findings from the

332

literature.

333

significantly higher risk from aggressive driving tactics than did younger drivers, while Lo [27]

334

found that higher income respondents expressed less concern about environmental risks, which

335

he hypothesized to stem from a heightened sense of material risk faced by those with lower

336

incomes. Flynn, Slovic and Mertz [28] found respondents identifying as white, particularly

337

white men, registered significantly lower environmental risk perceptions, hypothesizing that

338

socio-political factors including power and status may influence risk perceptions.

For example, Rhodes and Pivik [26] found drivers 25 and older perceived

339

Other characteristics typically identified in the literature (e.g., sex) are not significantly

340

associated with expressed Local Vulnerability. Interestingly, participants randomly assigned an

341

information treatment focused on the social and financial costs of food waste were significantly

342

more likely to express Local Vulnerability and marginally higher on National Likelihood. While

343

we cannot provide a definitive explanation of this relationship given post-hoc design constraints,

344

we note the food waste information treatment was the only information treatment to emphasize

345

national level and household level implications of individual behavior (e.g., food waste causing

346

$161 billion of losses at the national level and $1500 of losses in an average household). Further,

347

the classification tree finds that, similar to the randomly assigned information about food waste,

348

participants who were randomly assigned compostable paper plates and the participant’s

349

recycling habits also work as significant determinants of Local Vulnerability. One conjecture is

350

that participants who link the implications of individual behaviors to issues of sustainability may

351

reflect more critically on the implications of personal actions during a public health crisis, which

352

could help increase compliance with social distancing and other preventative behaviors.

353

There is a persistent group consisting of about 30% of participants who, for the entire

354

study period, including the final day, do not translate their perceived likelihood of a national

355

public health crisis into personal vulnerability from attending campus events (National, not

356

Local). These are likely a critical group in terms of modeling diffusion of COVID-19, as Poletti

357

et al. [22] emphasize the role of translating perceived risk into preventative behaviors such as

358

social distancing.

359

However, our analysis provides few insights into the characteristics associated with

360

National, not Local group. Regression analysis finds few significant associations other than the

361

fact that older non-students are less likely to feature this response pattern and that those who

362

spontaneously attended the study in response to same-day receipt of flyers were more likely.

363

The former suggests that younger people in academic settings may be diagnostic for predicting

364

this response pattern while the latter may be suggestive that certain personality traits have

365

predictive power.

366

This lack of insight into the National, not Local group is likely due to the post-hoc nature

367

of the analysis, one of several study limitations. Specifically, the study was originally designed
20

368

to investigate a topic other than COVID-19 perceptions, hence logical experimental treatments

369

and additional questions about personal perceptions and behaviors relevant to understanding and

370

predicting the spread of COVID-19 were not included and the questions that were posed were

371

not motivated by theory. Another study limitation is that the sample is drawn from a single

372

academic institution, limiting the representativeness of the data geographically, demographically,

373

and socioeconomically. Finally, the data were acquired prior to the declaration of a national

374

emergency, and we would expect further evolution in how people in this location might respond

375

to these questions in the face of more dire national promulgations concerning the pandemic.

376

377

Conclusions

378

By integrating questions focused on COVID-19 into an ongoing in-person experiment during the

379

two weeks prior to the major disruption in public activities in Louisiana and much of the country,

380

we provide some insights into how participants drawn from one community in Louisiana were

381

perceiving the national and local implications of the public health crisis that was unfolding

382

during the study period. Understanding perceptions related to risk can help to tailor national or

383

local responses to curb transmission of infectious disease.

384

We find that perceptions during this critical time increased steadily and rapidly such that

385

nearly 90 percent of participants agreed that it was likely that COVID-19 would become a

386

national public health crisis by the final day of our study, which corresponded with the day that

387

Louisiana declared a public health emergency. However, participants’ views of their personal

388

vulnerability to contracting the virus from attending local events increased more slowly and, only

21

389

on the day after Louisiana’s emergency declaration, did a majority of participants agree that

390

public event attendance increased their odds of contracting the virus.

391

While some characteristics that were significantly associated with a lower perceived local

392

vulnerability to contracting COVID-19 have precedent from previous risk perception research

393

(e.g., younger than 25, white, higher incomes), others are novel and suggest the need for more

394

investigation. For example, our finding of significantly lower perceived local vulnerability

395

among participants expressing a strong interest in eating healthier may support aggressive

396

information and enforcement campaigns against dietary schemes promoting themselves as

397

COVID-19 preventatives or remedies or broadly touting certain foods as immunity-boosting

398

[25]. Also, our finding that participants who were randomly assigned an information treatment

399

that emphasized the national implications of food waste expressed significantly higher

400

perceptions of local vulnerability may suggest that information campaigns emphasizing the

401

national implications of individual behaviors could help increase compliance with social

402

distancing and other preventative behaviors.

403

Throughout the study period, including the day after the emergency declaration, and

404

about 30% of participants did not convert national perceptions of a likely public health crisis into

405

perceived vulnerability from local event attendance. This could be a key group to target as

406

localities and states implement social distancing policies and procedures.

407

characteristics associated with this group are limited, but do include age, with students less than

408

25 years of age more likely to fall into this group than older, non-students. This provides

409

evidence to support strategies that tailor communications efforts to younger cohorts that

410

encourage social distancing and other prevention behaviors (e.g., WHO 2020 [29]).
