Abstract
Coronavirus pandemic of 2019-2020 has already affected over a million people and caused
over 50,000 deaths worldwide (as on April 3, 2020). Roughly half of the world population
has been asked to work from home and practice social distancing as the search for a
vaccine continues. Though government interventions such as lockdown and social
distancing are theoretically useful, its debatable whether such interventions are effective in
flattening the curve, which is ceasing or reducing the growth of infection in control
populations. In this article, I present a simple power law model that enables a comparison
of countries in time windows of 14 days since first coronavirus related death is reported in
that country. It therefore provides means to access the efficacy of above interventions.
Introduction
Several epidemiological and statistical models[1–5] have been employed recently for the
description of the coronavirus pandemic. Since the pandemic control is an ongoing effort,
many of these models provide either an optimistic or a pessimistic picture. Nonetheless,
such models are useful for government bodies to plan interventions and other measures to
curb the disease. For instance, air travel restrictions between most affected countries came
into existence by the middle of March’2020. Inbounds travelers from high risk countries
usually went through thermal screening at the airport, followed by strict isolation of
symptomatic and quarantine for asymptomatic travelers. Further, most countries have

adopted strategies to encourage social distancing in several phases, e.g., (1) educating

citizens to avoid physical contacts, (2) limiting social gathering, (3) closing academic
institutions, (4) strict lockdown with only essential services open. Finally, many countries
have adopted random testing in populations to identify affected people.
To the best of my knowledge of the scientific understanding of coronavirus at the point of
writing this article,
•

Infection mainly occurs through physical contact and is not airborne.

•

The effect of weather on the spread of pandemic has not been established.

•

Although the older people have high death risk due to comorbities, the virus also
affects younger populations. In fact, asymptomatic young people may be silent virus
carriers.

•

Travel restrictions between countries are very useful in the initial phases of the
pandemic but have little effect in the later phases.

Epidemiological models can be developed with the objective of either understanding the
effect of various interventions on the spread of the infection or to analyze and forecast the
magnitude of infections or death in different geographical regions. One of the simplest and
intuitive models can be developed in the following way. Lets consider 𝑖 = 1,2, … . . 𝑁 regions
(!)

of a system containing 𝑛!

active infections on day 𝑘. The system can be world and the

regions can be countries, or the system can be a country and the regions can be states, or
the system can be a state and the regions can be cities, etc.

Here, 𝑘!" is the rate constant for spread of infection from existing cases in region 𝑖 .
𝑓(𝑛! ! , 𝑘) is an arbitrary function that captures the nature of spread. For example, 𝑓 ∝ 𝑛! !
for a first-order process. 𝑞! (!) is the fraction of new cases that were quarantined in region 𝑖
on day 𝑘, where we assume that the quarantined cases do not infect further. 𝜏!"! is the
fraction of infected people of region 𝑖 going to region 𝑗, who have not been tested. 𝑁! is the
number of secondary infections caused by an infected person during the journey, e.g. at the

can be approximated as 𝜏! ! 𝜏! ! , where 𝜏! ! is the fraction of infected case

traveling to other regions. 𝑟! ! and 𝑑! ! are the number of cases recovered and died on day
𝑘. 𝑆! ! is the number of new cases coming from outside the system (if system is not world)
or emerging within system. Unfortunately, eq. (1) contains many parameters that are
difficult to estimate in the middle of a pandemic as the pandemic has not properly evolved
in many regions. Nevertheless, the beneficial effects of quarantine and travel restrictions
can be easily seen from eq. (1). In a hypothetical situation of full quarantine (𝑞! ! = 1) and
(!)

no travel (𝜏!" = 0), the growth is completely ceased unless new cases emerge within the
region (𝑆! ! ≠ 0). In realistic situations, none of the above condition can be fully met.
However, if 𝑆! ! = 0 and 𝑓 grows with 𝑘 more rapidly than the first-order growth in second
term of eq. (1), the functional form of 𝑓 in eq. (1) dictates the growth behavior.
I have tried several functions to fit the growth behavior and observed that power law
functions of the type 𝑛! ! ∝ 𝑘 ! with different exponents at different time windows
approximately captures the growth behavior of almost all countries. Similar fractal scaling
has been discussed by Ziff in a recent work[1]. Any serious intervention is expected to
‘flatten’ the curve by reducing 𝛼. The details of our methodology and obtained results are
discussed in the following sections.
Methodology
I have used the Covid data set of Johns Hopkins University ( https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/ ),
which contained data until April 1, 2020 at the time of download. Although the fitting was
performed for confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths per day, I only report the
results for deaths per day. This is because the number of reported confirmed cases may
significantly depart from the actual number of confirmed cases due to a systematic lack of
population-wide testing and the infection may reappear in asymptomatic and recovered
cases. Countries with atleast 10 reported deaths until April 1, 2020, are only considered
henceforth. For each country, Day 0 is determined as the day when the first death case is
reported. Following power-law relation is fitted,

where separate exponent 𝛼 is computed for 0-14 days (𝑚 = 0), 14-28 days (𝑚 = 1), 28-42
days (𝑚 = 2), etc. Mean 𝛼! and standard deviation 𝜎! of 𝛼 values are computed. Here, 𝑚
represents the number of countries for which the time window is applicable. For instance, if
Day 0 of a country is 20 days prior to April 1, 2020, it will be considered in the time windows
of 0-14 days and 14-28 days but not considered in 28-42 days, 42-56 days, etc. Following
risk-levels are assigned for countries in each time window:

•

SAFE if 𝛼 < 𝛼! − 𝜎!

•

MODERATE if 𝛼! − 𝜎! ≤ 𝛼 < 𝛼!

•

HIGH if 𝛼! ≤ 𝛼 < 𝛼! + 𝜎!

•

DANGEROUS if 𝛼 ≥ 𝛼! + 𝜎!

Results and Discussion
Table 1 shows the mean and standard deviation of 𝛼 in different time windows averaged
over the countries for which the first death has occurred before the beginning of the time
window. As expected, 𝛼! decreases with passage of time and the pandemic can be
assumed to be controlled after 70 days. Note however that while the exponents decrease,
the number of cases still remain high and the actual pandemic control would depend on the
recovery rate of infected individuals. The standard deviation 𝜎! is almost half of 𝛼! until 28
days but become comparable to 𝛼! beyond this period, which may be attributed to the
smaller number of countries over which averaging is performed.

death data of some representative countries are shown in the figure. The efficiency of a
country in controlling the pandemic can be accessed by determining risk levels. Note that if
a country is in the DANGEROUS level in a time window, it will not immediately go to
regions of lower risk in Figure 1 even when 𝛼 drops. Therefore, in order to contain the
pandemic, a country should begin interventions in the first time window. Interventions
occurring in later time windows have lesser effect also because they do not affect the
already infected cases that have been not detected or were asymptomatic. Table 2
summarizes the country-wise statistics where the DANGEROUS time windows of countries
