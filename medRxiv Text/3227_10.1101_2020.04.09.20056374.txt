ABSTRACT
Background: The emergence of COVID-19 global pandemic coupled with high transmission rate and
mortality has created an unprecedented state of emergency worldwide. This global situation may have a
negative impact on the psychological well-being of individuals which in turn impacts individuals’ performance.

Methods: A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Jordan between 22nd and 28th of
March 2020 to explore the mental health status (depression and anxiety) of the general population, healthcare
professionals, and university students during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety among the study
participants. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of depression and anxiety.

Results: The prevalence of depression and anxiety among the entire study participants was 23.8% and 13.1%,
respectively. Anxiety was most prevalent across university students 21.5%, followed by healthcare professionals
11.3%, and general population 8.8%. Females among healthcare professionals and university students, divorced
healthcare professionals, pulmonologists, and university students with history of chronic disease were at higher
risk of developing depression. Females, divorced participants among the general population, and university
students with history of chronic disease and those with high income (≥1500 JD) were at higher risk of
developing anxiety.

Conclusions: During outbreaks, individuals are put under extreme stressful condition resulting in higher risk
of developing anxiety and depression particularly for students and healthcare professionals. Policymakers and
mental healthcare providers are advised to provide further mental support to these vulnerable groups during this
pandemic.

1. INTRODUCTION
In December 2019, an infectious disease with unknown aetiology characterised with acute pneumonia has been
recognized in Wuhan, China, named 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (Wang et al., 2020). The causative
microorganism has been identified as a new RNA virus from the beta-coronavirus family, named as severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Guan et al., 2020). The respiratory illness caused by the
COVID-19 is highly contagious, therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has categorised it as a
pandemic infection (WHO, 2020).
COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact, making a huge number of the
population at risk of getting infected. The widespread of COVID-19 mainly in Wuhan, China and worldwide
has attracted attention all over the world. As of April 06, 2020, a total of 1,254,969 persons were diagnosed with
COVID-19 and 68,825 died of this life-threating infectious disease (Channel news Asia, 2020). In Jordan, a total
of 345 cases were confirmed and 110 patients recovered with five deaths reported (Channel news Asia, 2020;
World Stats, 2020).
Due to duty calls, healthcare professionals (HCP) are more likely to come in contact with COVID-19 carriers
putting them at a greater risk of contracting the infection and spreading it to others, including their loved ones. A
recent study in China reported that a total of 2,055 HCPs were diagnosed with COVID-19 (National Health
Commission, 2020). In response to COVID-19 pandemic, Jordan government took extremely proactive
measures to prevent the spread of the virus where the state of emergency was declared on March 20, 2020. The
country witnessed a complete lockdown, banning people from leaving their homes except for a few specific
reasons. Individual violating these orders were subject to three years in prison, a $4,200 fine, or both. The
government also implemented an extensive public health awareness campaign utilizing all available media
channels (The Jordan Times, 2020). The exponential increase in the number of cases and deaths in betterequipped countries, the spread of COVID-19 misinformation, the lack of medical treatment, and the shortage of
properly equipped units to care for patients all could contribute to provoking public fear, anxiety and/or
depression, which is usually neglected during crisis and pandemic management (Cao et al., 2020; Chen et al.,
2020; Downes, 2015; Huang & Zhao, 2020; Zhai & Du, 2020).
Psychological wellbeing has an important impact on individuals’ performance. This impact is well documented
among different populations including HCPs (Ramirez, Graham, Richards, Gregory, & Cull, 1996; Schafheutle,
Seston, & Hassell, 2011; Wallace, Lemaire, & Ghali, 2009), general population (GP) (Burt, Zembar, &
Niederehe, 1995), and university students (US) (Andrews & Wilding, 2004; Bruffaerts et al., 2018; Campos,
Oliveira, Mello, & Dantas, 2017; O'Malley, Voight, Renshaw, & Eklund, 2015). Therefore, the study of the
psychological wellbeing of these populations during COVID-19 pandemic is of paramount importance. This
study aims to explore the prevalence of depression and anxiety among the GP, HCPs, and USs during COVID19 outbreak, and identify key population(s) who might need psychological intervention.

2. METHODS
2.1. Study design and study population
A cross-sectional study by means of online survey was conducted in Jordan between 22nd and 28th of March
2020 to explore the mental health status (depression and anxiety) of the GP, HCPs, and USs during the outbreak
of COVID-19. The data collection period was restricted to one week as longer period may influence the mentalhealth status of the study populations.
2.1.1.

Sampling strategy

A convenience sample of eligible participants was invited to participate in the study. The GP, HCPs, and USs
were invited to participate in this study through social media (Facebook and WhatsApp). Each study population
was invited using a specific survey-link as each population has specific demographic questions. All participants
voluntarily participated in the study and were thus considered exempt from written informed consent. Study aim
and objectives were clearly explained at the beginning of the survey.
The inclusion criteria were: a) participants aged 18 years and above and living currently in Jordan; and b)
participants who had no apparent cognitive deficit. Participants were excluded if they were: a) below 18 years of
age; b) unable to understand Arabic language; and c) unable to participate due to physical or emotional distress.
2.1.2.

Depression and anxiety assessment scales

Previously validated assessment scales, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 and Generalized Anxiety
Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety among the study participants. These
screening instruments were frequently used and validated as brief screening tools among various populations for
depression and anxiety (Levis, Benedetti, Thombs, & Collaboration., 2019; Löwe et al., 2008; Martin, Rief,
Klaiberg, & Braehler, 2006; Maurer, Raymond, & Davis, 2018; S. Yoon et al., 2014). In addition, the following
information were collected: participants’ demographics (age, gender, income, and marital status). Furthermore,
all participants were asked whether they were worried about being infected with COVID-19 or transmitting it to
family members (yes/no question). The GP and USs were asked whether they had underlying chronic conditions
(yes/no question). The GP were also asked about their education level and employment status. HCPs were asked
about their specialities and exposure to COVID-19 patients and/or providing medical care for COVID-19
patients during this pandemic. USs were asked about their field of study and year level.
The PHQ-9 scale is a 9-questions instrument given to participants to screen for the presence and severity of
depression (Hartung et al., 2017; Hinz et al., 2016). The GAD-7 instrument was used to screen for anxiety
(Esser et al., 2018). The PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 instruments asked the participants about the degree of
applicability of each item (question), using a 4-point Likert scale. Participants’ response ranged from 0 to 3,
where 0 means “Not at all” and 3 means “Nearly every day”. The PHQ-9 instrument includes 9 items. Items are
scored from 0 to 3 generating a total score ranging from 0 to 27. A total score of 0–4 indicates minimal
depression, 5–9 mild depression, 10–14 moderate depression, 15-19 moderately severe depression, and 20–27
severe depression (Schwenk et al., 2011). The GAD-7 instrument includes 7 items. Items are scored from 0 to 3
generating a total score ranging from 0 to 21. A total score of 5–9 indicates mild anxiety, 10–14 moderate
anxiety, and 15–21 severe anxiety (Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & Löwe, 2006).

2.1.3.

Estimate of prevalence and classification of depression and anxiety.

Prevalence rates of depression and anxiety were determined using a cut-off point as recommended by the
authors of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scale. In this study, depression was defined as a total score of (≥ 15) in the
PHQ-9 instrument indicating a case with moderately severe or severe depression. Anxiety was defined using the
GAD-7 instrument with a total score of (≥ 15) indicating a case with severe anxiety. The higher the score the
more severe the case identified by any scale.
The prevalence rate of depression was estimated by dividing the number of participants who exceeded the
borderline score (≥ 15) by the total number of the participants in the same population. Prevalence rate of anxiety
was calculated using the same procedure.
2.1.4.

Sample size

The target sample size was estimated based on the WHO recommendations for the minimal sample size needed
for a prevalence study (Lwanga & Lemeshow, 1991). Using a confidence interval of 95%, a standard deviation
of 0.5, a margin of error of 5%, the required sample size was 385 participants from each study population.
2.1.5.

Ethical approval

This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at Faculty of Pharmacy in Isra University, Amman,
Jordan. As participation in the study was voluntary, the Research Ethics Committee approved consent waiver.

2.2. Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to describe participants’ demographic characteristics. Continuous data were
reported as mean ± SD for normally distributed variables and median (interquartile range (IQR)) for nonnormally distributed variables. Categorical data were reported as percentages (frequencies). The Mann-Whitney
U test/Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the median scores between different demographic groups.
Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for anxiety or
depression. Logistic regression models were carried out using anxiety or depression scores above the cut-off
points highlighted above. A two-sided p<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. The statistical analyses
were carried out using SPSS (version 25).

3. Results
3.1. Participants characteristics
A total of 4,126 individuals participated in the study (GP=1,798, HCPs=1,163, and USs=1,165). Table 1 details
the baseline characteristics of the participants in the three populations. The majority of participants (n=2,436,
59.0%) were females, aged between 18–29 years (n=2,287, 55.4%), single (n=2,225, 53.9%), and with an
income of 500 JD or below (n=2,152, 52.2%). Around half of the GP were employed (n=927, 51.6%), with the
majority (n=1,190, 66.2%) completed their bachelor’s degree. The largest proportion of the participating HCPs
were physicians (n=560, 48.2%). More than half of the participating USs (n=621, 53.3%) were studying nonmedical sciences.
Around 15.8% (n= 284) and 6.0% (n=70) of the GP and the USs respectively reported that they have a history of
chronic disease. The vast majority (n=3,124, 75.7%) of the participants from all populations reported that they
were concerned about contracting COVID-19 or transmitting it to family members. When participants were

asked if they have identified any problems over the past two weeks, to what extent have these problems
prevented them from doing their work, looking after their household affairs or dealing with people, 59.0%
(n=2,436) reported that they faced difficulties.

3.2. Prevalence of mental health problems
The prevalence of depression (participants with a total score of 15 and above; cases with moderately severe and
severe depression) among the entire study participants was 23.8% (n=980). Depression was most prevalent
across USs (n=449, 38.6%), followed by HCPs (n=247, 21.2%) and GP (n=284, 15.8%). The proportions of
minimal, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression were 24.3%, 31.8%, 20.2%, 13.4%, and
10.3% respectively. The prevalence of anxiety (participants with a total score of 15 and above; cases with severe
anxiety) from the entire study participants was 13.1% (n=539). Similarly, anxiety was most prevalent across
USs (n=250, 21.5%), followed by HCPs (n=131, 11.3%) and GP (n=158, 8.8%). The proportions of mild,
moderate, and severe anxiety were 35.6%, 19.0%, and 13.1% respectively. Table 2 details the prevalence of
depression and anxiety among participants stratified by severity.

3.3. Participant demographics and mental health problems
Table 3 presents participant demographics data and their median depression and anxiety scores. Depression
median score significantly differed across participants from different demographical characteristics (p<0.05),
except for the year level (for USs population). Anxiety median score significantly differed across participants
from different demographical characteristics (p<0.01), except for educational level (for the GP), year level and
field of study (for USs population).
University students, females, younger population (18–29 years), single and divorced, participants who
completed their bachelor degree (from the GP), with lower-income category (500 JD and below), pulmonologist
and ENT specialists (for HCPs), participants with no history of chronic diseases (for the GP and USs) tend to
have higher depression and anxiety median scores compared to others.
The logistic regression analysis identified the following group to be at a higher risk of depression: a) females
among HCPs and USs, b) divorced HCPs, c) pulmonologist, and d) USs with chronic disease history. On the
other hand, the following groups were at a lower risk of depression: a) elderly, married, and high income (1500
JD and above) participants among the GP and HCPs, b) students at their fifth year of study, and c) retried
participants from the GP. In addition, logistic regression analysis showed that the following groups were at a
higher risk of anxiety: a) females across the three study populations, b) divorced participants among the GP, and
c) USs with chronic disease history and who are with high income (1500 JD and above). On the other hand, the
following groups were at a lower risk of anxiety: a) elderly and married participants among the GP, b) HCPs
with high income (1500 JD and above) Table 4.

4. Discussion
Emerging COVID-19 is a recent pandemic the has exhausted the world’s resources including the lives of many.
Therefore, studies that investigated the impact of this novel pandemic on mental health are limited. A recent
study in China investigated the effect of COVID-19 on public psychological status, and reported that females
were three-times at a higher risk of developing anxiety. On the other hand, higher education level was associated

with a lower risk of developing depression by 0.39 time, these results are in-line with our study findings (Wang,
Di, Ye, & Wei, 2020). Another study with 52,730 participants revealed that 35.0% of respondents experienced
psychological distress during the epidemic with female respondents showing a higher risk of psychological
distress when compared to males. Similarly, our results showed that females demonstrated a higher risk of
anxiety and depression (p<0.05) which is in-line with reported data during epidemics, where women,
particularly those working in healthcare, were prone to developing depression and anxiety (Lai et al., 2020; Li
L, 2003). These gender differences in psychological distress including depression and anxiety have been
described previously. Several studies have demonstrated that female gender is a risk factor for developing
mental illness where women have been reported to have 1.6 greater incidence of depression compared to men.
This could be attributed to increased frequency of hormonal fluctuation in women compared to men (Albert,
2015; Bartels, Cacioppo, van Beijsterveldt, & Boomsma, 2013).
In this study, a significant proportion of all participants (75.7%) emphasized their concerns about contracting
COVID-19 or transmitting it to family members. Interestingly, although elderly are at higher risk of developing
COVID-19 complications, our findings demonstrated that elderly participants (≥50 years) within the GP group
had a significant lower risk of developing depression (OR for >50 years = 0.24, 95% CI 0.14 – 0.41, p<0.000)
and anxiety (OR for >50 years = 0.40, 95% CI 0.22 – 0.7, p<0.01) compared to younger population. Possible
explanation for these findings include lack of knowledge about possible complications, faith, or submission to
mortality.
On the other hand, mental problems were most prevalent among USs showing 38.5%, 21.5% for depression and
anxiety, respectively, followed by HCPs (21.2%, 11.3% respectively). The percentage of students suffering from
depression and anxiety is alarming. This high prevalence rate could be primarily attributed to the mandatory
switch to distance education despite the limited resources and skillsets. Therefore, students had major concerns
regarding the impact of this emergency situation on their education and overall school performance.
Interestingly, when students’ category was stratified according to year level, there was a slightly higher
depression and anxiety score among first- and second-year students, however, it was statistically non-significant
(p>0.05). This result tallied with the findings that a statistically significant higher prevalence rate of depression
and anxiety was among young adults (18–29 years, p<0.05). Several studies have investigated the association
between healthcare job-related stress with depression and anxiety (Gao et al., 2012; Mann & Cowburn, 2005;
Smolders et al., 2009; S. L. Yoon & Kim, 2013) and such association appears more pronounced during a highly
transmissible global pandemic such as COVID-19 (Lai et al., 2020). Our findings demonstrated that HCPs have
a higher risk of developing unfavourable mental health outcomes particularly depression and anxiety. As we
anticipated, pulmonologists and ENT physicians scored the highest in comparison to other HCPs. Potential
factors that has contributed to these findings include pulmonologists and ENT physicians being in the front-line
in treating COVID-19 patients, physician burnout, isolation form family, and feeling helpless due to the nature
of this disease. Similar findings are reported by Wong and colleagues (2007) during SARS outbreak where ER
physicians were found to have feeling of vulnerability, loss of control, fear of being infected or spreading the
virus to family members and others (Wong et al., 2007). The unclear dynamics of COVID-19 transmission
coupled with the high morbidity and mortality may exaggerate the perception of individual danger and provoke
depression and anxiety (W. Wang, Tang, & Wei, 2020).
Although ENT physician score for depression and anxiety were statistically non-significant, which could be
attributed to small sample size, we strongly believe that they are clinically important and should not be ignored.

(p>0.05). Furthermore, foreseeable shortages of medical supplies, personal protective equipment (PPE) and the
increasing number of both suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 contribute to the pressures and anxiety
for HCPs (Chan-Yeung, 2004).
In comparison to USs and HCPs, the GP exhibited a lower prevalence rate of depression and anxiety. Possible
contributor to these findings include the faith that Jordanians have in government. A study conducted by
Analyseize Research demonstrated that 95.0% of Jordanians have full faith in government emergency measures
to combat COVID-19 outbreak (Analyseize Research, 2020). Of note, married individuals were found to be at a
lower risk of developing depression; GPs (OR= 0.43, 95% CI 0.33-0.55) and HCPs (OR= 0.75, 95% CI 0.560.99). Previous research reported that married couples have less tendency to develop depression and anxiety
compared with divorced individuals which could be attributed to the impact of marriage on wellbeing and
partner support (Kalmijn & Monden, 2006). Furthermore, our results showed that retired individuals among the
GP tend to have a lower risk of developing depression (OR= 0.31, 95% CI 0.14-0.72. p<0.01) when compared
to employed or unemployed individuals, which is consistent with previous studies. On one research conducted
by Buffel and co-worker, they reported that retired individuals tend to have a lower score of depression during
crisis when compared to employed and unemployed persons (Buffel, Van de Velde, & Bracke, 2015). During
crisis there is a reported increase in unemployment rate which is positively correlated with depression rate
(Choudhry, Enrico, & Marcello, 2012; Choudhry, Marelli, & Signorelli, 2010).
The findings of this study highlight the impact of COVID-19 global pandemic on psychological well-being of
individuals, particularly HCPs and USs. It is our hope that these findings raise awareness amongst policy
makers and mental health providers in order to take the necessary measures to attend to psychological wellbeing
of individuals during global pandemic. Further studies to investigate the impact of time on mental health are
needed.

Strengths and limitations
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and largest (4,126 participants, including 1,163 HCP) study in the
Middle East that investigated the prevalence of depression and anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic. The large
sample size increased the generalisability of these findings. Additionally, the use of previously validated
assessment tools is another strength of the study.
However, there are some limitations. There are limited studies that explored the prevalence of depression and
anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic worldwide and in the Middle East specifically, a fact that limited our
ability to compare our findings with similar healthcare environment and culture. The sample size of ENT
physicians’ subgroup was small due to small population in this category nationwide. The impact of time on
mental health was not captured here due to the nature of this study and further studies are necessary. It would be
useful to repeat the study after the COVID-19 pandemic reach a peak to determine the effect of time on the
results. Although depression and anxiety are closely related, depression is almost related to disparate life events,
and needs a longer duration in time than the 2-weeks, that are monitored by the PHQ-9 instrument. However,
this remark is not valid for anxiety and GAD-7 is relevant to the subject. The above-mentioned remarks may
explain the surprising conclusion that USs are more affected and have higher depression and anxiety rates
compared to HCPs who are in the centre of the risk and seriously affected by this pandemic disease. Finally, we
used an online survey for data collection and therefore, we may have missed some of the targeted population.

However, we tackled this by distributing the survey among three different populations and widely used social
media.

5. Conclusion
Depression and anxiety are prevalent mental problems during COVID-19 pandemic. These mental problems
impact the psychological wellbeing of individuals from the entire community including university students,
healthcare professionals, and the general population. Females, university students, divorced individuals,
healthcare professionals at front-line, and those who are with underlying chronic conditions are at a higher risk.
Policymakers and mental care health providers are advised to attend to and provide mental support as needed to
vulnerable groups during this pandemic.
