Abstract
Background and Aims: The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) may affect the
disease status of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aimed to assess the
disease status of IBD patients in Hubei province by questionnaire online and guide to the
self-management of IBD patients during this epidemic.

Methods: A questionnaire was designed containing the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI), the Partial
Mayo Score (PMS), the short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (SIBDQ) and distributed
to Hubei IBD patients online within one month of traffic control after the outbreak of COVID-19.
This questionnaire also included some questions about patients’ self-report disease conditions and
their epidemiological history of COVID-19.
Results: A total of 102 eligible questionnaires were included in the analysis. No patient reported
infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in our study. Our
result showed that 69.64% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 80.44% of patients with
Crohn's disease (CD) were in remission. There was not a statistically significant difference in the
proportion of the active disease stage between the two types of disease (p=0.103). The majority of
patients (85.29%) had a good health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (SIBDQ≥50). The reduction
in physical exercise is a risk factor for worsening in conditions (OR=17.593, 95%CI 2.035 to
152.097, p=0.009).
Conclusions: The outbreak of COVID-19 might not have a significant impact on most Hubei IBD
patients within one month after the traffic control. The patient’s disease condition could be
assessed by our questionnaires. Doctors utilized the information and advised for IBD patients
about self-management during the period of COVID-19.
Key words: questionnaire, inflammatory bowel disease, Coronavirus Disease 2019

1. Introduction
In December 2019, an outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the
SARS-COV-2 emerged in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China, and spread rapidly

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043364; this version posted March 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this

worldwide1,2. On January 23, 2020, the Chinese government implemented traffic controls to
prevent the spread of COVID-193. Up to 20 February 2020 approximately a month after traffic
control when we distributed this questionnaire to IBD patients, there had been 75,465 cases of
COVID-19 confirmed in mainland China, including 62,662 cases in Hubei Province. The number
of confirmed diagnoses in Hubei Province is 83.03% of that in China, accounting for the vast
majority. At the same time, medical resources had also shifted more towards the diagnosis and
treatment of COVID-19 in Hubei province. These factors made routine medical treatment and
follow-up of patients with chronic diseases inconvenient. Under these influences, it is essential for
patients with chronic diseases to self manage under the guidance of a doctor in this particular
period. Self-management is the process by which patients participate in decision-making and
self-care under the guidance of a doctor4. Patient’s effective self-management can relieve
symptoms and control disease activity to a certain extent5.
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a type of chronic idiopathic bowel disease, includes
Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). IBD patients have varying degrees of immune
disorders6 so that they may be considered as virus-susceptible. It is particularly crucial for IBD
patients to know how to self manage during the epidemic. Self-management requires
monitoring of diseases by doctors first7. Our questionnaire can assess patients' disease activity and
quality of life online, which is an effective and convenient way to guide patients to promote better
self-management.
The questionnaire was a validated 60-item questionnaire including scoring systems for PMS,
HBI and SIBDQ. These indexes were designed to gain detailed knowledge of disease activity and
the quality of life of these IBD patients. There were questions to understand subjective feelings of

disease conditions. This questionnaire also included questions about COVID-19 epidemiological
history of these IBD patients. After evaluating the patient's disease activity and HRQoL by those
indexes, we gave feedback to these IBD patients and guided patients to develop targeted
self-management programs. This approach might facilitate the development and modification of
interventions to optimize patient self-management during the COVID-19 epidemic8.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design and Participants
This study was an online questionnaire survey among IBD patients from the region of Hubei
province.

From February 18, 2020 to February 20, 2020, the questionnaire was administered to a

sample of IBD patients with regular follow-up in our IBD center. There were two items of the
inclusion criteria for this study. One was that the patient (aging from 14 to 80) was established
diagnosis of IBD for at least three months, another was that the patient is available to finish the
online questionnaire (by Wechat, QQ, website, email) by himself or with the help of others. The
exclusion criterion was that the patient is not able to finish the questionnaire. During this study,
patients with IBD had been informed of the study’s aim from their GE. An IBD specialist nurse is
explicitly trained in this questionnaire contacted them to explain the study objectives. Participants
completed the questionnaire with an online survey portal. They completed questionnaires
voluntarily and independently, under uncompensated conditions.

2.2. Questionnaire design

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043364; this version posted March 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this

The questionnaire was a validated 60-item questionnaire that assesses IBD disease activity
across multiple domains, including the HBI, PMS and SIBDQ. HBI score ranges from 0 to 16 or
more, and the highest score depends on the number of liquid stools per day. HBI scores of 0 and 4
are assigned to the remission phase; 5 to 8 are assigned to moderately active disease phase; ≥9
are assigned to severely active disease phase9. We used PMS (excludes the endoscopic appearance
of the mucosa), a 9-point score composed of the stool frequency, bleeding components and
physician rating of disease activity. PMS of 0 and 2 are assigned to the remission phase; 3 to 6 are
assigned to moderately active disease phase; 7 to 9 are assigned to severely active disease phase10.
Total SIBDQ score ranges from 10 to 70, to find out how the patients have been feeling during the
last two weeks. They will be asked about symptoms related to IBD diagnosis, as well as the
general emotion status during the period and their attitude to the plague. Patients with a SIBDQ
score of more than 50 are considered to have a good HRQoL11.
In addition to the question about HBI, PMS and SIBDQ, the questionnaire included questions
regarding the subjective feeling about their change in disease conditions and epidemiological
history questions about COVID-19.

2.3. Statistical analysis
Data collection and its statistical analysis were carried out using the SPSS software system
(SPSS for Windows, Version 23.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago). Data analysis excluded incomplete items.
Categorical data obtained were presented as frequency counts and percentages. Median, range and
frequency were used to describe the demographic, SIBDQ scores and clinical characteristics.
Chi-square tests were used to test the significant difference of categorical variables between two

groups, such as the participants’ distribution in different disease active phase between UC and CD
patients, with fisher exact test as appropriate. The logistic regression analysis was used to identify
variables significantly associated with disease activity, and a multivariate model was built to
assess the effect of each potential confounding factor and determined independent and significant
factors associated with the disease index. The odds ratio (OR) was calculated to quantify the
corresponding risk. For all analyses, p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

2.4. Ethical Considerations
This study was approved by the National Health Commission of China and Ethics
Commission of Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and
Technology.

3. Results
3.1. Presenting Characteristics
A total of 111 electronic questionnaires were returned. There were 102 valid questionnaires,
with an effective rate of 91.89%. The nine questionnaires excluded were due to some missing
items. The median age of participants was 34 years (IQR, 27.25-42.25; range, 14-66), and 66.67%
of participants were men. There were 56 (54.90%) patients with ulcerative colitis and 46 (45.10%)
patients with Crohn's disease. Among all the participants in our survey, no one reported infection
with SARS-CoV-2; no one had symptoms related to COVID-19 or had a history of exposure.
Table 1 shows the demographic data and disease-related variables for all participants who agreed
and completed the survey.

3.2. Disease activity
We used PMS and HBI to score and grade disease activity in UC and CD patients,
respectively. The results were shown in Table 2. The median PMS of UC patients was 2 (IQR, 0-3;
range, 0-8). Of the 56 UC patients, 39 (69.64%) UC patients were in remission, 16 (28.57%)
patients had moderate activity, and 1 (1.79%) patients had severe activity. The median HBI of CD
patients was 2 (IQR, 1-4; range, 0-12). Of the 46 CD patients, 37 (80.44%) CD patients were in
remission, 6 (13.04%) patients had moderate activity, and 3 (6.52%) patients had severe activity.
There was not a statistically significant difference in the proportion of the disease activity stage
between UC and CD patients (p = 0.103).

3.3. Quality of life
The median SIBDQ of all participants was 59 (IQR, 52.25-63; range, 34-70). The median SIBDQ
of UC patients was 60 (IQR, 54.75-64; range, 35-70), and the median SIBDQ of CD patients was
58 (IQR, 52-62.75; range, 34-69). Among all participants, 87 (85.29%) patients had good HRQoL
(SIBDQ ≥ 50). There were 49 (87.50%) UC patients who had good HRQoL, compared with 38
(82.61%) CD patients who had good HRQoL (p=0.338) (table 3), suggesting HRQoL is not
significantly different between UC and CD patients.

3.4. Self-report disease conditions
In this questionnaire, we set up questions that allow patients to self-report changes in their
disease condition. Approximately half of the patients (n = 55, 53.92%) thought that their disease

condition did not change during the epidemic, 25 (24.51%) considered their disease condition
improved, and 22 (21.57%) considered their disease condition worsening. We attempted to study
the cause of change in patients' self-report disease conditions. The result showed that reduced
physical exercise is a risk factor for worse in the disease condition (OR=17.593, 95%CI 2.035 to
152.097, p=0.009). The other factors did not have a significant risk for changes in the patient's
disease condition. These data are shown in Table 4.

3.5. The change in medication regimens
We studied participants' medication regimens before and after the outbreak of COVID-19.
The results are shown in Table 5. Twenty patients who changed their medication regimens, with
10 UC patients and 10 CD patients. Then we investigated the reasons for the change in patient's
medication regimens during this outbreak situation. The largest proportion of the reason was the
inability to purchase medications (n = 18, 90.00%), and the second reason was the inability to go
to the hospital for routine treatment (n = 2, 10.00%). No one chose the options of "forgetting to
take medicine" and "reducing medicine on your own", which suggest that medication compliance
of these IBD patients we surveyed was excellent during the epidemic.

3.6. Emotional state
Negative emotions are significantly correlated with clinical recurrence and are also
considered to be independent risk factors for more frequent activities of disease12,13. Therefore, we
also investigated the emotional states of IBD patients in this survey. More than half of the

participants (57.85%) thought they had the ordinary moods during this epidemic, 35.29% had
positive moods, and 6.86% had negative moods.

4. Discussion
COVID-19 broke out in December 2019 in China. Hubei Province is one of the worst-hit
areas. COVID-19 was caused by SARS-CoV-2 which was generally susceptible to population14.
The elderly and patients with underlying diseases were more susceptible to infection and prone to
serious consequences15. Our results showed that there was no IBD patient reported being
diagnosed with COVID-19 in this survey. But this did not mean that IBD patients were not
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 since the samples of this study were not obtained by random sampling
and the sample size was relatively small. Until now, there is no evidence to prove the
susceptibility of IBD patients to COVID-19 from other study16. The epidemic led to a contraction
in routine medical resources, and IBD patients had difficulty maintaining previous disease
management. Our research focuses on guiding patients' self-management through the results of
questionnaires.
Since the start of traffic control in China in late January, the lifestyle, psychological and
physical condition of the Chinese population might change17-19, especially for residents in Hubei
province. This situation made it more difficult for IBD patients in Hubei province to have
face-to-face medical interventions. We used web questionnaires to evaluate the disease activity,
quality of life, and the patient's self-report disease condition of IBD patients. Then we provided
feedback on the patient's condition and advised on their self-management. This manner helped
IBD patients to adjust their treatment plans and develop a home-based self-management medical

intervention model. It has been proven that active doctor-patient communication can improve
patient confidence with treatment, shared decision-making capacity and then has a good impact on
disease activity4,20. We will continue to distribute questionnaires to this group of IBD patients in
Hubei province every month until the policy of traffic control removed. Then we will compare the
patient's objective evaluation results with the subjective report results. The final goal is to guide
patient home-based self-management during the outbreak of COVID-19.
Our results showed that 69.64% of UC patients and 80.44% of CD patients were in remission
assessed by PMS and HBI index. 85.29% of patients had a good quality of life during the
epidemic through the SIBDQ test. Among the patients' self-reported results, 78.43% of the
patients thought that their disease conditions had not changed or even improved. The disease
activity and quality of life of most patients were still in an ideal state, and their self-reported
disease conditions did not worsen. It showed that the epidemic had not a significant negative
impact on the majority of IBD patients within one month of traffic control.
We studied the influencing factors of the self-report disease condition of IBD patients during
this epidemic. The factors included “emotional state,” “change of medication regimen,” “daily
rest,” “subsequent visit,” “reduction of exercise” and “smoking.” The results showed that reduced
exercise is a risk factor for worsening disease (OR=17.593, p=0.009). The other factors that could
affect the disease conditions of IBD patients in previous studies21-26, but have not shown a
statistical correlation in our survey with a relatively small sample size. Therefore, we still
recommend that IBD patients maintain a positive emotional state, maintain the medication
regimen,

Pharmacological intervention is a key part of managing symptoms and maintaining remission
in patients with IBD27. It had become inconvenient for patients to return to the hospital or take
appropriate medications under this special circumstance. Our results showed that the number of
people who took no medication increased among UC and CD patients after the outbreak of
COVID-19. For UC patients, the number of patients taking mesalazine decreased due to the
inconvenience of obtaining medications. For CD patients, the use of Remicade and methotrexate
decreased, and the use of adalimumab increased. The decrease in medications might be due to the
inconvenience of obtaining medications. We recommend using other available medicines instead
of inaccessible Remicade. We tried to develop personalized treatment plans for specific patients
on time in this particular period. Such a measure could minimize the impact of changes in
medication regimens on the patient's disease condition. It was an important step to increase patient
self-management.
The result showed that 93.14% of patients had normal or even positive emotional states; only
6.86% of patients had negative emotional states in our survey. The result showed that the epidemic
did not have a very negative impact on the mood of these IBD patients in such a relatively early
month. However, previous studies have shown that emotional stress is significantly associated
with decreased quality of life, interventions to address psychological issues may be part of IBD
management28,29. Therefore, we should take intervention in those patients with negative moods to
prevent the emotional states from adversely affecting their disease conditions.

In the middle of February, more than half of the Hubei IBD patients in our study were in
remission. The majority of participates had a good HRQoL, and their self-reported disease
condition did not worsen. This result indicated that the outbreak of COVID-19 might not have a
significant impact on most IBD patients within one month after the traffic control. We will
continue to pay attention to the long-term effect of the epidemic on disease activity and HRQoL in
IBD patients in the future follow-up. In our survey, doctors used questionnaires to assess patients'
disease, give timely feedback and suggestions to IBD patients. This method facilitated the
effective self-management of patients under the circumstance of the COVID-19 outbreak.
