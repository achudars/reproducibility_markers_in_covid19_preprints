Abstract
Addition of adjuvant corticosteroid therapy to standard antiviral treatment of patients with
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is common in clinical practice. However, evidence is scarce
regarding the efficacy of adjuvant corticosteroids in patients who are critically ill. We
retrospectively evaluated the effects of adjuvant corticosteroid treatment on the outcome of
244 critically ill patients with COVID-19, using a risk stratification model that adjusts for
potential differences between the steroid group (n=151) and the non-steroid group (n=93).
We observed that adjuvant corticosteroid therapy was independent from 28-day mortality,
either in multivariate logistic regression of the entire cohort after adjustment for major
mortality-associated variables (age, SpO2/FiO2, and lymphocyte count) and individual
propensity score (adjusted OR: 1.05; 95% CI: -1.92-2.01), or in propensity score-matched (1:1
without replacement) case-control analysis (62 patients in 31 pairs; log-rank test P=0.17).
Additionally, subgroup analyses of 147 (60%) patients who had dyspnea and 87 (36%)
patients who had ARDS revealed corticosteroid treatment was not associated with clinical
outcome (both, P>0.3). However, increased corticosteroids dosage was significantly
associated with elevated mortality risk after adjustment for administration duration
(P=0.003); every ten-milligram increase in hydrocortisone-equivalent dosage was associated
with additional 4% mortality risk (adjusted HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07). Our findings
indicated that limited effect of corticosteroid therapy could pose to overall survival and
prudent dose within effective limits may be recommended for critically ill patients under
certain circumstances.

Introduction
The spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has already taken on pandemic proportions. A
substantial portion of patients developed rapidly progressive pneumonia leading to acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunctions, conditions associated
with high mortality [1, 2]. Adjuvant corticosteroid therapy of such patients is common in
clinical practice. However, evidence is scarce regarding the efficacy of adjuvant
corticosteroids in patients who are critically ill with COVID-19. We retrospectively evaluated
the effects of adjuvant corticosteroid treatment on the outcome of critically ill patients with
COVID-19, using a risk stratification model that adjusts for potential differences between the
steroid group and the non-steroid group.

Methods
Study population
We retrospectively reviewed medical records of all adult patients with confirmed infection of
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) who were admitted to
intensive care wards of Tongji hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 25 through February
25, 2020. A total of 244 eligible patients who had complete medical records and were at least
20 years old, critically ill, and treated with etiological antiviral agents were enrolled. Critically
ill patients were defined as those who were admitted to intensive care wards and required
mechanical ventilation (either invasive or noninvasive) or with ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ≤300mmHg;
,

when PaO2 is not available, SpO2/FiO2 ≤315 suggests ARDS), or sepsis with acute organ
dysfunction [3]. The clinical outcome was 28-day mortality after admission. The Ethics

Commission of Tongji hospital approved this study, with a waiver of informed consent.

Study design
The first part of this study was a retrospective cohort study that included all eligible patients.
The outcome of patients given corticosteroids was compared with those not given. The
second part was a 1:1 matched case-control study. The patients with corticosteroids
treatment (e.g., methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone) were designated
as “case subjects”, and those without as “control subjects”. We converted all preparations to
hydrocortisone-equivalent doses (methylprednisolone 1:5, dexamethasone 1:25) [4].

Statistical analyses
To reduce the effect of corticosteroids treatment selection bias and potential confounding,
we adjusted for differences in baseline characteristics by propensity score, which was
estimated to predict a patient’s probability of being treated with a corticosteroid without
regard to outcomes, using multivariate logistic regression [5]. Potential confounders
considered in propensity score matching (PSM) analysis were those variables included in the
final model by means of step-wise backward elimination procedures with P<0.20 [6]. Model

treatment on clinical outcome was analyzed by multivariate logistic regression with
adjustment for major variables (age, SpO2/FiO2, and lymphocyte count) associated with
mortality; the individual propensity score was incorporated into the model as a covariable to

calculate the propensity adjusted odds ratio (OR) [6]. Additionally, PSM was performed to
generate propensity score-matched pairs without replacement, and the survival probability
was compared between matched pairs by Kaplan-Meier curve and analyzed with log-rank
test. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI. Continuous variables
were described as the median (IQR) while categorical variables were expressed as
frequencies (%). All statistical analyses were conducted with R (version 3.6.2) using a Fisher’s
exact test for categorical data and Mann-Whitney test for continuous data. For unadjusted
comparisons, a two-sided P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Cohort study
Of the 244 critically ill patients with confirmed SARS-CoV2, the median age was 62 (50-71)
years, and 52% were male (Table). All patients were given antiviral therapy (e.g., oseltamivir,
arbidol, lopinavir/ritonavir, ganciclovir, interferon-α), and 151 (62%) were given adjuvant
corticosteroid treatment (hydrocortisone-equivalent dosage range: 100-800mg/d). The
median (IQR) administration duration of corticosteroid treatment was 8 (4-12) days. Multiple
organ dysfunctions were more common in the steroid group than in the non-steroid group.
Multivariate analysis that adjusted for major mortality-associated variables and propensity
score indicated that corticosteroid treatment was independent from overall mortality
(adjusted OR: 1.05; 95% CI: -1.92-2.01). Of the 244 patients in this study, 147 (60%) had
dyspnea and 87 (36%) had ARDS, and in subgroup analyses, multivariate analysis after
adjustment revealed corticosteroid treatment was not significantly associated with increased

28-day mortality (both, P>0.3).

Matched case-control study
Sixty-two patients in 31 pairs with and without corticosteroid therapy were matched by PSM
with balanced baseline characteristics (all, P>0.05; Table). The 28-day mortality rate was 39%
(12 out of 31) in case subjects and 16% (5 out of 31) in control subjects (P=0.09). Likewise,
we did not observe statistical significance in survival probability of this matched case-control
study, stratified by corticosteroid treatment (P=0.17; Figure). Unexpectedly, increased
corticosteroids dosage was significantly associated with elevated mortality risk (P=0.003) in
matched cases after adjustment for administration duration; every ten-milligram increase in
hydrocortisone dosage was associated with additional 4% mortality risk (adjusted HR: 1.04,
95% CI: 1.01-1.07).

Discussion
Our investigation indicated that addition of adjuvant corticosteroid therapy to standard
antiviral treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 was not associated with the 28-day
mortality, which means limited effect of corticosteroid therapy could pose to overall survival
of such disease.
Given the various adverse effects (e.g., avascular necrosis, diabetes, delayed virus
clearance, increased risk of secondary infections), corticosteroid therapy must be
commenced with caution after full consideration of indications and contraindications, and
routine corticosteroid use should be avoided during the process of anti-infection.

Additionally, we observed that increased corticosteroids dosage was associated with
elevated mortality risk, suggesting prudent dosage of corticosteroid should be promoted
when necessary. We acknowledged limitations of the study. First, we did not distinguish
patients who received corticosteroids for their underlying disease (e.g., COPD), the number
of which was however relatively small. Second, PSM is limited by adjusting for observed
covariables only, but in randomized trials randomization balances for known and unknown
factors. Owing to this limitation, randomized placebo-controlled trials are warranted to
resolve this clinically essential issue.
Altogether, abuse of corticosteroids is highly opposed and this study provided evidence
that low-dose corticosteroids within effective limits may be recommended for critically ill
patients with COVID-19 under certain circumstances.
