Abstract

18

New coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 poses a big challenge for global public health in

19

early 2020. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the virus rapidly spreads

20

all over the world and takes thousands of lives in just two months. It is critical to refine

21

the incidence and mortality risks of COVID-19 for the effective management of the

22

general public and patients in the outbreak. In this report, we investigate the incidence

23

and mortality risks of the infection by analyzing the age composition of 5319 infected

24

patients, 76 fatal cases, and 1,144,648 individuals of the general public in China. Our

25

result shows a relatively low incidence risk for young people but a very high mortality

26

risk for seniors. Notably, mortality risk could be as high as 0.48 for people older than

27

80 years. Furthermore, our study suggests that a good medical service can effectively

28

reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less.

Introduction

34

On Jan 7, 2020, a new pathogenic virus caused pneumonia was identified in the

35

sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.

36

It has typical features of the coronavirus family and therefore is classified as the

37

subgenus Sarbecovirus, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily(1, 2). This virus has been named

38

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease it

39

causes has been named “coronavirus disease 2019” (COVID-19). It is the third

40

epidemic coronavirus that emerges in the human population in the 21st century,

41

following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) outbreak in 2002

42

and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) outbreak in 2012(3, 4).

43

Coronavirus is one of the main pathogens of human respiratory infection owing to

44

frequent cross-species infections. The emerging virus rapidly becomes a challenge for

global public health due to spread by human-to-human transmission. The majority of

46

the earliest COVID-19 patients were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.

47

However, human-to-human transmission has frequently been occurring and that the

48

epidemic has been gradually growing(5). As of March 4th, 2020, 80566 laboratory-

49

confirmed cases have been reported in China. Internationally, more than 14396 cases

50

have been reported in 77 countries(6, 7) The number of infected individuals is far

51

surpassing that of SARS and MERS. SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe and even fatal

52

respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. It has been reported

53

that SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, suggests that

54

age and comorbidity may be risk factors for poor outcomes(8, 9). In China, the reported

55

death is approaching 3% in total of COVID-19 patients in the middle of February 2020.

56

At present, information regarding the prevalence and case-fatality on clinical

57

features and epidemiology of COVID-19 remains scarce. However, a relatively

58

accurate evaluation of incidence and mortality is required that will help refine the risk

59

assessment and ensure that the public and patients are managed in an effective way.

60

Therefore, it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate the risks for individual groups of

61

different ages and gender. In this report, we show our initial analysis of the public data

62

from local authorities. Our study shows that the incidence risk of COVID-19 might be

63

as low as 0.1 for children while it could be over 0.9 for 40-years old adults. Our result

64

also suggests that the mortality risk might be above 0.2 for patients older than 80 years

65

old. Notably, the mortality risk is significantly different between patients of Hubei

66

province and that of other parts of China.

Basic information of COVID-19 cases was released on official websites by the

73

COVID-19 cases were residents outside Hubei Province. Among the 76 fatal cases, 45

74

cases were reported as residents of Hubei province and 31 cases were reported as

75

residents of other parts of China. Epidemiological characteristics, such as age, gender,

76

and location were carefully checked to remove missing values or duplicated records.

77

The composition of the age of the general public was obtained by data of 1,144,648

78

individuals from the General Census of China (2018)(10).

79

Estimating incidence risk of COVID-19

80

We estimated the incidence risk of COVID-19 for different age groups in the

81

general public by a maximum likelihood approach. In this approach, given the age

82

composition of the general public and incidence risk of different age groups, age

83

composition of COVID-19 cases can be obtained in

P( Agei | incidence) =

84

P(incidence | Agei ) P( Agei )
.
∑ P(incidence, Agei )
i

85

Where P(incidence | Agei ) is the incidence risk of age group i; P ( Agei ) is the

86

proportion of age group i in general public. We assumed that the incidence risk for

87

different age groups could be obtained from a logistic function of age,

88

=
P(incidence | Age
1/ [1 + exp(
i)

89

of 5319 COVID-19 cases can be maximized by searching for optimized μ and γ.

90

Consequently, the incidence risk can be achieved in a maximum likelihood approach

91

where the risk is given by a logistic function of age with estimated parameters μ and

92

γ.

Characteristic of the COVID-19 cases and general public

112

The public data of a total of 5319 identified COVID-19 cases were included in our

113

analysis. There were 2829 (53.2%) males and 2490 (46.8%) females in the COVID-19

114

cases, the male to female ratio turned out roughly equal across all age groups. The age

115

of COVID-19 patients ranged from 0.5 to 97 years, with a mean of 45.2 years. The age

116

and gender composition of COVID-19 patients and the public reference is presented in

117

Table 1. Compared to the general public, the COVID-19 cases had higher average age,

118

and there was a higher proportion of people aged 30 to 69 years.

We collected detailed information of 76 fatal cases and plotted the age composition

120

of the cases and the general public in Figure 1. It is evident that death occurs more

frequently in older people but rare for patients under 40 years old. The fatal cases were

122

from 34 to 89 years old, with an average age of 71.47 and a standard deviation of 12.49.

123
124

Incidence risk of COVID-19 of the general public

125

Based on the age composition of 5319 COVID-19 cases and the 1,144,648

126

individuals of general public, we estimated the incidence risk in a maximum likelihood

127

approach. Our result shows that the disease can happen in all age groups, and there

128

lacks a significant difference between males and females (Figure 2). The difference in

129

incidence risk for different gender is observed only for the groups between 15 and 50

130

years old. After the age of 15, males have a slightly higher incidence risk than women,

131

but the increase is ignorable for people over 50 years old. Our result does not support a

132

previous report that SARS-CoV-2 generally affects more males than females in the

133

epidemic8. The incidence risk is low for children and teenagers but rapidly increases

134

for adults. For adults over 40-years old, the risk is higher than 0.9 when they have full

135

exposure to the virus.

136
137

Mortality risk of COVID-19 of general public

138

In our assessment for mortality risk, there is a significantly higher mortality risk in

139

older adults (Figure 3). The estimated fatal probability is less than 0.01 for individuals

140

under 40 years old, but it is more than 0.51 for people older than 90 years. The

141

calculated risk is much higher than the previous reports. Our result is consistent with

142

most of the earlier studies, supporting the hypothesis that older age is associated with

143

an increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Our analysis of the total of 76 fatal

144

cases suggests a mortality rate of 2.38% for general infection. However, we noticed that

145

the mortality rate of COVID-19 in reports is significantly different between identified

146

cases of Hubei province and that of other parts of China (11).

148

Different mortality risks in Hubei and other provinces

149

To compare mortality risk between Hubei and other provinces of China, we

150

divided 76 fatal cases into two subsets, 45 cases from Hubei province and 31 cases from

151

other parts of China. The aforementioned statistical analysis for mortality risk is applied

152

to the two subsets with nine different age groups each. To account for variability, we

153

further obtained a standard deviation of estimations by applying the same method on

154

1000 simulated data sets that generated with initial estimation. Our result shows that

155

mortality risk is no more than 0.13 ± 0.10 for people over 80 years old outside Hubei

156

province, but the risk is as high as 0.60±0.15 for the corresponding age group in Hubei

157

province (Figure 4). Mortality risk falls under 0.05 for people younger than 70 years in

158

other parts of China, while only people under 50 years old have a risk under 0.05 in

159

Hubei province. We also calculated the expectation of mortality rate for a general

160

infection inside and outside Hubei province as 4.78% and 0.95%.

161
162

Discussion

163

Our result suggests that there is a significantly higher mortality risk of COVID-19

164

for seniors than the previous report(11). It is probably due to the published report didn’t

165

account for the increasing death of the identified COVID-19 cases. In the previous study,

166

the crude mortality rate is only 2.3%, but the rate is approaching 3.7% on March 4th,

167

2020 (3,015 deaths among 80,566 identified COVID-19 cases). As of March 4th, 2020,

168

there were still 5,952 COVID-19 patients in severe condition in China. It has been

169

reported that the survival probability of critically ill patients continuously decreased

170

with the increase of time since admission to the intensive care unit (12). Our analysis

171

was based on the composition of the age of the different populations, and therefore it is

172

less affected by the disease progression of patients, especially the increasing death of

173

critically ill patients. Age has been reported as the independent predictor of adverse

174

outcome in SARS and MERS. Comorbidities and low immune function of older people

175

might be the major cause of higher mortality of coronaviruses(3, 4, 11). Prompt

176

administration of antibiotics to prevent infection and strengthening of immune support

177

treatment might reduce the mortality of seniors(8).

178

Our data showed that the mortality rate of COVID-19 is five times higher in Hubei

179

province than that in other parts of China. On the one hand, this difference may be

180

partially explained by insufficient medical resources due to such a large amount of

181

patients in Hubei Province in the breakout. On the other hand, detailed information on

182

the majority part of fatal cases (40 of 45 in total) from Hubei province was published

183

before January 25th, 2019. The mortality rate of early reported cases may be overstated

184

because case detection is highly biased towards the more severe cases. However, we

185

strongly suggest international authorities try their best immediately to prevent too many

186

COVID-19 patients overloading their health care system. Our hypothesis that a smooth-

187

running health care system can effectively reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19 is

188

strongly supported by the low mortality rate in other parts of China.

189

In conclusion, we investigate the incidence and mortality risks of the infection by

190

analyzing the age composition of COVID-19 patients and the general public in China.

191

Our data shows a relatively low incidence risk for young people but a very high

192

mortality risk for old adults. Therefore, it is prudent to strengthen the tertiary preventive

193

and clinical care of old aged patients to reduce mortality. Furthermore, our results also

194

support that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral

195

infection to 1% or less. Our study could be of value to medical authorities to implement

196

effective medical service. The lack of complete data for all COVID-19 cases potentially

197

increases the occurrence of selection and measurement biases in this study. Therefore,

198

further large-scale epidemiological studies are necessary to elucidate the risk factors of

199

COVID-19 for the general public.
