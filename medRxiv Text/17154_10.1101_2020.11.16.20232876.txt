Abstract
Introduction: In an attempt to improve outcomes for patients with coronavirus disease 19
(COVID-19), several drugs, such as remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine (with or without
azithromycin), and lopinavir/ritonavir, have been evaluated for treatment. While much attention
focuses on potential benefits of these drugs, this must be weighed against their adverse effects.
Methods: We searched 32 databases in multiple languages from 1 December 2019 to 27 October
2020. We included randomized trials if they compared any of the drugs of interest to placebo or
standard care, or against each other. A related world health organization (WHO) guideline panel
selected the interventions to address and identified possible adverse effects that might be
important to patients. Pairs of reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias.
We analyzed data using a fixed-effects pairwise meta-analysis and assessed the certainty of
evidence using the GRADE approach.
Results: We included 16 randomized trials which enrolled 8226 patients. Compared to standard
care or placebo, low certainty evidence suggests that remdesivir may not have an important
effect on acute kidney injury (risk difference [RD] 8 fewer per 1000, 95% confidence interval
(CI): 27 fewer to 21 more) or cognitive dysfunction/delirium (RD 3 more per 1000, 95% CI: 12
fewer to 19 more). Low certainty evidence suggests that hydroxychloroquine may increase the
risk of serious cardiac toxicity (RD 10 more per 1000, 95% CI: 0 more to 30 more) and cognitive
dysfunction/delirium (RD 33 more per 1000, 95% CI: 18 fewer to 84 more), whereas moderate
certainty evidence suggests hydroxychloroquine probably increases the risk of diarrhoea (RD
106 more per 1000, 95% CI: 48 more to 175 more) and nausea and/or vomiting (RD 62 more per
1000, 95% CI: 23 more to 110 more) compared to standard care or placebo. Low certainty
evidence suggests lopinavir/ritonavir may increase the risk of diarrhoea (RD 168 more per 1000,
95% CI: 58 more to 330 more) and nausea and/or vomiting (RD 160 more per 1000, 95% CI:
100 more to 210 more) compared to standard care or placebo.
Conclusion: Hydroxychloroquine probably increases the risk of diarrhoea and nausea and/or
vomiting and may increase the risk of cardiac toxicity and cognitive dysfunction/delirium.
Remdesivir may have no effect on risk of acute kidney injury or cognitive dysfunction/delirium.
Lopinavir/ritonavir may increase the risk of diarrhoea and nausea and/or vomiting. These
findings provide important information to support the development of evidence-based
management strategies for patients with COVID-19.

Introduction
As of November 16, 2020, there are 54.6 million cumulative cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and
at least 1.3 million deaths.1 Several drugs have been used for the treatment of patients with
COVID-19, often without high quality evidence demonstrating efficacy. Three drugs that have
been used for COVID-19 include remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin,
and lopinavir/ritonavir. None of these drugs have high certainty evidence evaluating their
effectiveness for key patient-important outcomes such as mortality, need for mechanical
ventilation, duration of hospital stay or time to clinical improvement.2

We are conducting a living systematic review and network meta-analysis to provide a summary
of the evidence for all drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19.2 Until now, we have not found
that any one of these drugs increases the risk of adverse effects leading to drug continuation
when compared to standard care or another drug treatment. However, we have not evaluated
drug-specific adverse effects, which patients might consider to be important when making
decisions about whether to use or not use a drug, particularly in the face of considerable
uncertainty regarding their desirable effects.

Building on the work of the living systematic review, the aim of this paper is to summarize the
best available evidence addressing drug-specific adverse effects in COVID-19. This evidence
synthesis is part of the BMJ-Rapid Recommendations project,3 to inform World Health
Organization (WHO) Living Guidelines on drugs for treatment of COVID-19.4,5

Methods
We followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA)
guidelines for reporting.6

Eligibility criteria
As selected by the linked guideline panel we included randomised clinical trials (RCTs) that
included people with suspected, probable, or confirmed COVID-19 comparing remdesivir,
hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir, alone or in combination with other drugs, for

treatment against one another or against no intervention, placebo, or standard care, and reported
on drug-specific adverse events of interest (see outcome identification below). We included trials
regardless of publication status (peer reviewed, in press, or preprint) or language. No restrictions
were applied based on severity of COVID-19 illness or setting in which the trial was conducted
(outpatient, hospital, ICU, etc). We excluded studies in which remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine,
and lopinavir/ritonavir were used for prophylaxis and studies in which different doses of the
same intervention were compared.

Information sources
We performed daily searches from Monday to Friday using the WHO COVID-19 database for
eligible studies, which is a comprehensive multilingual source of global literature on COVID19.7 Prior to its merge with the WHO COVID-19 database on 9 October 2020, we also
performed daily searches for eligible studies from Monday to Friday in the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 Research Articles Downloadable Database.8
To identify RCTs, we filtered the results from the CDC’s database through a validated and
highly sensitive machine learning model.9 In addition, we searched six Chinese databases. We
adapted the search terms for COVID-19 developed by the CDC to the Chinese language. For the
Chinese literature search, we also included search terms for randomised trials.

We also used living evidence retrieval services to identify any trials that might have been missed
with traditional search methods. These included the Living Overview of the Evidence (L-OVE)
COVID-19 Repository by the Epistemonikos Foundation10 and the Systematic and Living Map
on COVID-19 Evidence by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, in collaboration with the
Cochrane Canada Centre at McMaster University.11 We searched all English information sources
from 1 December 2019 to 27 October 2020, and the Chinese literature from inception of the
databases to 16 October 2020. A complete list of information sources is available in
supplementary text 1..

Study selection

Using systematic review software, Covidence,12 following training and calibration exercises,
pairs of reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts, followed by full texts of trials
that were identified as potentially eligible. A third reviewer adjudicated conflicts.

Data collection
For each eligible trial, pairs of reviewers extracted data independently using a standardised,
pilot-tested data extraction form. Reviewers collected information on trial characteristics (trial
registration, publication status, study status, design), participant characteristics (country, age,
sex, smoking habits, comorbidities), and outcomes of interest. Reviewers resolved discrepancies
by discussion and, when necessary, with adjudication by a third party.

Outcome identification
A linked WHO-BMJ Rapid Recommendations guideline panel4 consisting of patients, clinicians,
and research methodologists with representation from all WHO geographic regions provided
input on potentially important adverse effects of the medications. If any of the panelists believed
a specific adverse effect was possible and might influence the decision to use or not use each
drug, it was included in this systematic review as an outcome of interest. Panelists were asked to
focus on adverse effects important to patients, rather than surrogate measures. For example, we
considered clinically important cardiac toxicity including arrhythmias important, but did not
consider changes to the QT interval important.

The panel identified specific adverse effects for each drug. For remdesivir, we included acute
kidney injury. For hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin, we included
cardiac toxicity, diarrhoea, and nausea and/or vomiting. For lopinavir/ritonavir, we included
acute kidney injury, diarrhoea, and nausea and/or vomiting. For all of the drugs, we included
cognitive dysfunction/delirium and fatigue. We included studies in which researchers used any
definitions of these outcomes. In cases in which the definitions did appropriately reflect what is
important to patients, we rated down the certainty of the evidence for indirectness (see certainty
of the evidence below).

Risk of bias within individual studies

For each eligible trial and outcome, following training and calibration exercises, reviewers used
a revision of the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in RCTs (RoB 2.0)13 to rate trials as
either at i) low risk of bias, ii) some concerns—probably low risk of bias, iii) some concerns—
probably high risk of bias, or iv) high risk of bias, across the following domains: bias arising
from the randomisation process; bias due to departures from the intended intervention; bias due
to missing outcome data; bias in measurement of the outcome; bias in selection of the reported
results, including deviations from the registered protocol; and bias arising from early termination
for benefit. We rated trials at high risk of bias overall if one or more domains were rated as
“some concerns—probably high risk of bias” or as “high risk of bias”, and as low risk of bias
overall if all domains were rated as “some concerns—probably low risk of bias” or “low risk of
bias”. Reviewers resolved discrepancies by discussion and, when not possible, with adjudication
by a third party.

Data synthesis
Measures of effect and statistical analysis
We summarised the effect of interventions on dichotomous outcomes using odds ratios (ORs)
and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We conducted frequentist fixed-effects
pairwise meta-analyses using the R package “meta” in RStudio Version 1.3.1093.14 We used
fixed rather than random effects for the primary analysis because for many of the interventions,
the evidence consisted of two or fewer trials or there were several studies with few events. For
outcomes in which there were more than one trial with no events in both groups, we metaanalysed the data using risk differences (RD) rather than odds ratios.

Certainty of the evidence
We assessed the certainty of evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment,
development and evaluation (GRADE) approach.15 Two methodologists with experience in using
GRADE rated each domain for each comparison separately and resolved discrepancies by
consensus. We rated the certainty for each comparison and outcome as high, moderate, low, or
very low, based on considerations of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, publication bias,
and imprecision. We made judgments of imprecision using a minimally contextualised approach
with the null effect as a threshold. This minimally contextualised approach considers whether the

CI includes the null effect, or, when the point estimate is close to the null effect, whether the CI
lies within the boundaries of small but important benefit and harm.16 Additionally we analysed if
the total number of patients included in the meta-analysis was less than the required number of
patients generated by a conventional sample size calculation for a single adequately powered
trial to define if optimal information size (OIS) was met. For some of the interventions,
extensively implemented in other clinical scenarios, we used indirect evidence to complement
the certainty of evidence judgments. We created GRADE evidence summaries (Summary of
Findings tables) using the MAGIC Authoring and Publication Platform (www.magicapp.org) to
provide user friendly formats for clinicians and patients and to allow re-use in the context of
clinical practice guidelines for COVID-19.4,5 We calculated the absolute risks and risk
differences from the ORs (and their CIs) and the mean risk in the control groups across all of the
included trials. In cases where no events were reported in the control arm of any of the included
studies, we calculated baseline risks based on other comparisons for the same outcome.

Subgroup and sensitivity analyses
We performed Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis using the bayesmeta package.17 We used a
plausible prior for the variance parameter and a uniform prior for the effect parameter, as
suggested in an empirical study using pre-specified empiric priors as a sensitivity analysis for all
comparisons.18 We did not conduct any subgroup analyses.

Results
Study identification
After screening 14,806 titles and abstracts and 300 full texts, we included sixteen unique RCTs
with 8,152 patients that informed on drug-specific adverse events (figure 1).19-34 We did not
identify any additional eligible RCTs through the living evidence retrieval services. Two studies
reported adverse effects for remdesivir,19,33 ten for hydroxychloroquine,21-26,29-32 one for
hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin,21 and four for lopinavir/ritonavir.20,27,28,34 Of the sixteen
eligible RCTs, 13 have been published in peer reviewed journals, and 3 only as preprints.22,24,26
All of the trials were registered, published in English and most evaluated treatment in patients
admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (15/16; 93.7%). Most of the trials were conducted in China
(10/16; 62.5%). Table 1 presents the characteristics of the included studies. Additional study

Risk of bias in included studies
Supplementary figure 1 presents the risk of bias assessment of the 16 included studies for each
outcome. Overall and domain specific risk of bias judgments did not differ between the
outcomes reported in each individual study, and most of the studies (13/16, 81.2%) presented
significant methodological limitations.

Two studies19,33 including 1,281 patients reported on remdesivir specific adverse events. Both
studies reported on acute kidney injury and one study19 including 1,048 patients reported on
cognitive dysfunction/delirium. No studies reported on fatigue.

Acute Kidney Injury
Remdesivir may have little or no effect on acute kidney injury when compared to placebo (OR
0.85, 95% CI: 0.51 to 1.41; RD 8 fewer per 1,000 participants, 95% CI: 27 fewer to 21 more)
(Supplementary figure 2.). The certainty of the evidence was low because of serious imprecision
and serious indirectness (studies used change in serum creatinine rather than patient-important
measures of acute kidney injury like renal replacement therapy requirement).

Cognitive dysfunction/delirium
Remdesivir may have little or no effect on cognitive dysfunction/delirium when compared to
placebo (OR 1.22, 95% CI: 0.48 to 3.11; RD 3 more per 1,000 participants, 95% CI: 12 fewer to
19 more). The certainty of the evidence was low because of very serious imprecision.

Hydroxychloroquine
Ten studies21-26,29-32 including 3,663 patients reported on hydroxychloroquine specific adverse
events. Seven studies including 3,287 patients reported cardiac toxicity,21,22,24,27,30-32 six trials
including 979 patients reported diarrhoea,23-25,29-31 seven studies including 1,429 patients23-26,29-31
reported nausea and/or vomiting, one study30 including 423 patients reported on cognitive
dysfunction/delirium and two studies24,31 including 180 patients reported on fatigue.

Cardiac toxicity
Definitions of cardiac toxicity varied between trials: RECOVERY defined the outcome as new
major arrhythmias (supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation or
atrioventricular block requiring intervention),26 two studies as new arrhythmias,21,30 and one
study as new arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.32 The remaining studies did not provide details about
cardiac toxicity definition. Hydroxychloroquine may increase the risk of cardiac toxicity when
compared to standard care or placebo (RD 10 more per 1,000 participants, 95% CI: 0 more to 30

more) (Supplementary figure 3). The certainty of the evidence was low because of serious
imprecision and risk of bias (unblinded studies with possible detection bias).

Diarrhoea
Hydroxychloroquine probably increases the risk of diarrhoea when compared to standard care or
placebo (OR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.40 to 2.73; RD 106 more per 1,000 participants, 95% CI: 48 more
to 175 more) (Supplementary figure 4). The certainty of the evidence was moderate because of
imprecision as the optimal information size (OIS) was not met. Although most studies presented
methodological limitations, we did not rate down for risk of bias (RoB) as our concerns were
mitigated by a large effect size and indirect evidence showing consistent results.35

Nausea and/or vomiting
Hydroxychloroquine probably increases nausea and vomiting (OR 1.74, 95% CI: 1.26 to 2.41;
RD 62 more per 1,000 participants, 95% CI: 23 more to 110 more) (Supplementary figure 5).
The certainty of the evidence was moderate because of imprecision as OIS was not met.
Although most studies presented methodological limitations, we did not rate down for RoB as
our concerns were mitigated by a large effect size and indirect evidence showing consistent

Cognitive dysfunction/delirium
Hydroxychloroquine may increase cognitive dysfunction/delirium when compared to standard
care or placebo (OR 1.59, 95% CI: 0.77 to 3.28; RD 33 more per 1,000 participants, 95% CI: 18
fewer to 84 more). The certainty of the evidence was low because of very serious imprecision.

Fatigue
The effect of hydroxychloroquine on fatigue is uncertain when compared to standard care or
placebo (OR 2.75, 95% CI: 0.28 to 27.28; RD 82 more per 1,000 participants, 95% CI: 38 fewer
to 555 more) (Supplementary figure 6). The certainty of the evidence was very low because of
very serious imprecision and serious risk of bias.

Hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.16.20232876; this version posted November 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this

Only one study21 including 667 patients reported drug-specific adverse effects for
hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. The study compared hydroxychloroquine with
azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine alone, and standard care and reported on cardiac toxicity and
nausea and/or vomiting. Other outcomes, including diarrhoea, cognitive dysfunction/delirium or
fatigue were not reported.

Cardiac toxicity
The effect of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin on cardiac toxicity is uncertain when
compared to standard care or placebo (RD 10 more per 1,000 participants, 95% CI: 10 fewer to
20 more), or hydroxychloroquine alone (RD 0 more per 1,000 participants, 95% CI: 20 fewer to
20 more). The certainty of the evidence was very low because of very serious imprecision and
serious risk of bias.

Nausea and/or vomiting
The effect of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin on nausea and vomiting in uncertain when
compared to standard care or placebo (OR 1.49, 95% CI: 0.37 to 6.06; RD 8 more per 1,000
participants, 95% CI: 11 fewer to 78 more), or hydroxychloroquine alone (OR 0.54, 95% CI:
0.18 to 1.57; RD 20 fewer per 1,000 participants, 95% CI: 37 fewer to 24 more). The certainty of
the evidence was very low because of very serious imprecision and serious risk of bias.

Lopinavir/ritonavir
Four studies20,27,28,34 including 370 patients reported adverse effects of lopinavir/ritonavir. All
four studies reported diarrhoea and nausea and/or vomiting. Two studies including 259 patients
reported acute kidney injury20,27 and two studies including 254 patients reported fatigue.27,34 No
studies reported on cognitive dysfunction/delirium.

Acute Kidney Injury
The effect of lopinavir/ritonavir on acute kidney injury is uncertain when compared to standard
care or placebo (20 fewer per 1,000 participants, 95% CI: 70 fewer to 20 more) (Supplementary
figure 7). The certainty of the evidence was very low because of very serious imprecision and
serious risk of bias.

Diarrhoea
Lopinavir/ritonavir may increase the risk of diarrhoea when compared to standard care or
placebo (OR 4.28, 95% CI: 1.99 to 9.18; RD 168 more per 1,000 participants, 95% CI: 58 more

serious imprecision. Although most studies presented methodological limitations, we did not rate
down for RoB as our concerns were mitigated by a large effect size and indirect evidence
showing consistent results.36

Nausea and/or vomiting
Lopinavir/ritonavir may increase the risk of nausea and/or vomiting when compared to standard
care or placebo (RD 160 more per 1,000 participants, 95% CI: 100 more to 210 more)
(Supplementary figure 9). The certainty of the evidence was low because of very serious
imprecision. Although most studies presented methodologic limitations, we did not rate down for
RoB as our concerns were mitigated by a large effect size and indirect evidence showing
consistent results.36

Fatigue
The effect of lopinavir/ritonavir on fatigue is uncertain when compared to standard care or
placebo (OR 1.56, 95% CI: 0.53 to 4.58; 28 more per 1,000 participants, 95% CI: 25 fewer to
154 more) (Supplementary figure 10). The certainty of the evidence was very low because of

Risk of bias: Not serious. We rated one trial as high risk of bias due to deviations from the intended intervention. Indirectness: Serious as
studies used change in serum creatinine rather than patient-important measures of acute kidney injury.
Imprecision: Very serious. Confidence intervals include significant risk reduction and increase.
Risk of bias: Data primarily from unblinded studies, but we would expect that patients would be more closely monitored for cardiac
toxicity in trials than in usual clinical practice. Therefore, we expect the risk of cardiac toxicity to be higher in usual clinical practice.
Indirectness: Not serious. Trials measured cardiac toxicity differently in different trials. Imprecision: Serious. Confidence intervals
include no effect.
Risk of bias: Serious. Most of the evidence is from unblinded trials, we didn’t downgrade for RoB as our concerns were mitigated by a
large effect size and indirect evidence showing consistent results. Imprecision: OIS not met.
As there were no events in the control arms of included studies, we used the baseline risk estimated for Lopinavir/ritonavir vs. SOC
comparison for the same outcome.
Risk of bias: Serious. Most of the evidence is from unblinded trials. Imprecision: Very serious. Very small number of events.
Risk of bias: Serious. Most of the evidence is from unblinded trials; we did not downgrade for RoB as our concerns were mitigated by a

Sensitivity analyses
Our interpretation of the results did not substantially change when using a Bayesian random
effects model rather than frequentist fixed effects or when pooling relative estimates rather than
absolute estimates (supplementary figures 11 to 22).

Discussion
This systematic review and meta-analysis - directly informing the living WHO guideline for
COVID-19 therapeutics - provides a comprehensive overview of the evidence for drug-specific
adverse effects of interest for three commonly used drugs for treatment of COVID-19. From 40
interventions included in our living network meta-analysis,2 we only included studies reporting
on drug specific adverse events for remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, hydroxychloroquine with
azithromycin and lopinavir/ritonavir in this review as these drugs are receiving a high degree of
interest. None of these interventions may increase the risk of adverse effects leading to
discontinuation, however the certainty of the evidence was low for hydroxychloroquine and
moderate for remdesivir, while no information was available for hydroxychloroquine with
azithromycin, or lopinavir-ritonavir.2 In this review we found moderate certainty evidence that
hydroxychloroquine increases the risk of diarrhoea and nausea and/or vomiting and low certainty
evidence that it increases the risk of cardiac toxicity and cognitive dysfunction/delirium. For
lopinavir/ritonavir we found low certainty evidence that it increases the risk of diarrhoea, and
nausea and/or vomiting. Based on low or very low certainty evidence, we did not find evidence
that remdesivir or lopinavir/ritonavir increase the risk of acute kidney injury or cognitive
defunction/delirium.
Strengths and limitations of this review

The search strategy was comprehensive with explicit eligibility criteria, and no restrictions on
language or publication status. To ensure expertise in all areas, the review team is composed of
clinical and methods experts who have undergone training and calibration exercises for all stages
of the review process. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach and
interpreted the results considering absolute, rather than relative, effects.

We evaluated only a limited number of adverse effects and interventions, as selected by the
linked guideline panel. We included an adverse effect if any panel member believed it might be
important to patients when deciding whether to use or not to use a drug. However, there may be
other patient-important adverse drug effects that were not prespecified by the panel. Further,
some may perceive that excluding surrogate outcomes, such as an increase in liver enzymes or
electrocardiogram changes may lead to under-appreciation of potential harms, especially for
surrogates that are more closely linked on the causal pathway to patient important harms.

So far there is limited evidence for the harms associated with most drugs as adverse effects were
only reported by a limited number of studies. For comparisons with sufficient data, the primary
limitation of the evidence was lack of blinding, which might introduce bias through differences
in cointerventions or outcome assessment between randomisation groups. However, the large
magnitude of effects observed resulted in moderate certainty that hydroxychloroquine causes
specific adverse events.

These findings are consistent with “The Living Project” ( https://covid-nma.com/), which found
an increase in any adverse events with hydroxychloroquine (RR 2.16, 95% CI: 1.21 to 3.86) and
lopinavir/ritonavir (RR 2.39, 95% CI: 0.21 to 27.57), but not with remdesivir (RR 1.00, 95% CI:
0.87 to 1.15). However, they did not report on specific adverse events. Other systematic reviews
found an increase in the risk of diarrhoea and nausea and/or vomiting with lopinavir-ritonavir37,38
and hydroxychloroquine,38-40 increase in arrhythmias and QTc interval prolongation with
hydroxychloroquine alone,40-42 or combined with a macrolide,43,44 and no significant increase in
renal failure with remdesivir.45

Hydroxychloroquine probably increases the risk of diarrhoea and nausea and/or vomiting and
may increase the risk of cardiac toxicity and cognitive dysfunction/delirium. Remdesivir may
have no effect on risk of acute kidney injury or cognitive dysfunction/delirium.
Lopinavir/ritonavir may increase the risk of diarrhoea and nausea and/or vomiting. These
findings provide important information to support the development of evidence-based
management strategies for patients with COVID-19.
