As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads, the

20

susceptible subpopulation declines causing the rate at which new infections occur

21

to slow down. Variation in individual susceptibility or exposure to infection

22

exacerbates this effect. Individuals that are more susceptible or more exposed

23

tend to be infected and removed from the susceptible subpopulation earlier. This

24

selective depletion of susceptibles intensifies the deceleration in incidence.

25

Eventually, susceptible numbers become low enough to prevent epidemic growth

26

or, in other words, the herd immunity threshold is reached. Here we fit

27

epidemiological models with inbuilt distributions of susceptibility or exposure to

28

SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks to estimate basic reproduction numbers (𝑹𝟎 ) alongside

29

coefficients of individual variation (CV) and the effects of containment strategies.

30

Herd immunity thresholds are then calculated as 𝟏 − (𝟏⁄𝑹𝟎 )𝟏⁄#𝟏$𝑪𝑽 ' or 𝟏 −

31

(𝟏⁄𝑹𝟎 )𝟏⁄#𝟏$𝟐𝑪𝑽 ' , depending on whether variation is on susceptibility or

32

exposure. Our inferences result in herd immunity thresholds around 10-20%,

33

considerably lower than the minimum coverage needed to interrupt transmission

34

by random vaccination, which for 𝑹𝟎 higher than 2.5 is estimated above 60%.

35

We emphasize that the classical formula, 𝟏 − 𝟏⁄𝑹𝟎 , remains applicable to

36

describe herd immunity thresholds for random vaccination, but not for

37

immunity induced by infection which is naturally selective. These findings have

38

profound consequences for the governance of the current pandemic given that

39

some populations may be close to achieving herd immunity despite being under

40

more or less strict social distancing measures.

41

Scientists throughout the world have engaged with governments, health agencies, and

42

with each other, to address the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-

43

44

contact tracing, quarantine, and social distancing, to mitigate or suppress the initial

45

pandemic spread1. Successful suppression, however, may leave populations at risk to

46

resurgent waves due to insufficient acquisition of immunity. Models have thus also

47

addressed longer term SARS-CoV-2 transmission scenarios and the requirements for

48

continued adequate response2. This is especially timely as countries apply, relax and

49

reapply lockdown measures with varying levels of success in tackling national

50

outbreaks.

51

Here we demonstrate that individual variation in susceptibility or exposure

52

(connectivity) accelerates the acquisition of immunity in populations. More

53

susceptible and more connected individuals have a higher propensity to be infected

54

and thus are likely to become immune earlier. Due to this selective immunization by

55

natural infection, heterogeneous populations require less infections to cross their herd

56

immunity threshold (HIT) than suggested by models that do not fully account for

57

variation. We integrate continuous distributions of susceptibility or connectivity in

58

otherwise basic epidemic models for COVID-19 which account for realistic

59

intervention effects and show that as coefficients of variation (CV) increase from 0 to

60

5, HIT declines from over 60%3,4 to less than 10%. We then fit these models to series

61

of daily new cases to estimate CV alongside basic reproduction numbers (𝑅* ) and

62

derive the corresponding HITs.

Effects of individual variation on SARS-CoV-2 transmission

SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted primarily by respiratory droplets and modelled as a

susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) process.

Individual variation in susceptibility is integrated as a continuously distributed factor

68

that multiplies the force of infection upon individuals5 as

𝑆̇(𝑥) = −𝜆(𝑥)𝑥𝑆(𝑥),

(1)

70

𝐸̇ (𝑥) = 𝜆(𝑥)𝑥[𝑆(𝑥) + 𝜎𝑅(𝑥)] − 𝛿𝐸(𝑥),

𝐼 ̇(𝑥) = 𝛿𝐸(𝑥) − 𝛾𝐼(𝑥),

(3)

72

𝑅̇(𝑥) = (1 − 𝜙)𝛾𝐼(𝑥) − 𝜎𝜆(𝑥)𝑥𝑅(𝑥),

73

where 𝑆(𝑥) is the number of individuals with susceptibility 𝑥, 𝐸(𝑥) and 𝐼(𝑥) are the

74

numbers of individuals who originally had susceptibility 𝑥 and became exposed and

75

infectious, while 𝑅(𝑥) counts those who have recovered and have their susceptibility

76

reduced to a reinfection factor 𝜎 due to acquired immunity. 𝛿 is the rate of

77

progression from exposed to infectious, 𝛾 is the rate of recovery or death, 𝜙 is the

78

proportion of individuals who die as a result of infection and 𝜆(𝑥) =

79

(𝛽 ⁄𝑁) ∫[𝜌𝐸(𝑦) + 𝐼(𝑦)] 𝑑𝑦 is the average force of infection upon susceptible

80

individuals in a population of size 𝑁 and transmission coefficient 𝛽. Standardizing so

81

that susceptibility distributions have mean ∫ 𝑥𝑔(𝑥) 𝑑𝑥 = 1, given a probability

density function 𝑔(𝑥), the basic reproduction number is

(NPIs) designed to control transmission typically reduce 𝛽 and hence 𝑅* . We denote

the resulting controlled reproduction number by 𝑅, . The effective reproduction

number 𝑅-.. is another useful indicator obtained by multiplying 𝑅, by the

90

susceptibility of the population, in this case written as 𝑅-.. (𝑡) =

91

𝑅, (𝑡) ∫ 𝑥𝑆(𝑥, 𝑡) 𝑑𝑥 ⁄𝑁(𝑡) to emphasize its time dependence.

92

Top panels of Figure 1 depict model trajectories fitted to suppressed epidemics

93

(orange) in 2 European countries (Belgium and England) assuming gamma distributed

94

susceptibility and no reinfection (𝜎 = 0). We estimate: 𝑅* rounding 5 (Belgium) and

95

2.9 (England); individual susceptibility CV reaching 3.9 (Belgium) and 1.5 (England);

96

and overall intervention efficacy at maximum (typically during lockdown) being 60%

97

(Belgium) and 54% (England). Other estimated parameters are the day when NPIs

98

begin to affect transmission, after which we assume a linear intensification from

99

baseline over 21 days, remaining at maximum intensity for 𝑇/01 days and linearly

100

lifting back to baseline over a period of 𝑇23.4 days (both 𝑇/01 and 𝑇23.4 are estimated).

101

Denoting by 𝑑(𝑡) the proportional reduction in average risk of infection due to

102

interventions, in this case we obtain 𝑅, (𝑡) = [1 − 𝑑(𝑡)]𝑅* which is depicted for each

103

country, alongside 𝑅-.. (𝑡), underneath the respective epidemic trajectories. To assess

104

the potential for case numbers to overshoot if NPIs had not been applied, we rerun the

105

model with 𝑑(𝑡) = 0 and obtain the unmitigated epidemics (black). Further details

106

are described in Methods.

107

Variation in connectivity

108

In a directly transmitted infectious disease, such as COVID-19, variation in exposure

109

to infection is primarily governed by patterns of connectivity among individuals. We

110

incorporate this in the system (Equations 1-4) assuming that individuals mix at

111

random (but see Methods for more general formulations that enable other mixing

112

patterns). Under random mixing and heterogeneous connectivity6, the force of

infection is written as 𝜆(𝑥) = (𝛽⁄𝑁)(∫ 𝑦[𝜌𝐸(𝑦) + 𝐼(𝑦)] 𝑑𝑦⁄∫ 𝑦𝑔(𝑦) 𝑑𝑦), the basic

114

reproduction number is

115

𝜌 1
𝑅* = (1 + 𝐶𝑉 + )𝛽 @ + A,
𝛿 𝛾

116

𝑅, (𝑡) is as above and 𝑅-.. (𝑡) is derived by a more general expression given in

117

Methods. The results from this basic variable connectivity model are shown in

118

Extended Data Figure 1). To allow for the possibility that social distancing (𝑑) may

119

change not only the scale but also the shape of connectivity distributions, we consider

120

an extended model where connectivity is reformulated as (1 − 𝑑)[1 +

121

(1 − 𝑑)(𝑥 − 1)] (Extended Data Figure 2). This does not change the way the model

122

is written but special care is needed in analysis and interpretation to account for the

123

dynamic contact patterns. The basic reproduction number, in particular, depends

124

explicitly on a CV which is now dependent on social distancing.

125

Applying this model to the same epidemics as before we obtain the bottom panels of

126

Figure 1. The estimated epidemiological parameters are: 𝑅* rounding 8.9 (Belgium)

127

and 3.7 (England); individual connectivity CV reaching 3.9 (Belgium) and 1.6

128

(England); and intervention efficacy during lockdown being 45% (Belgium) and 37%

129

(England). The reported CVs correspond to baseline contact patterns.

130

Comparing the two models, variation in connectivity systematically leads to higher 𝑅*

131

estimates. The effect attributed to NPIs is lower in England than in Belgium. In both

132

countries, contacts appear to reach minimal levels around lockdown in April (𝑅,

133

plots), beginning to re-intensify thereafter but remaining below about half of pre-

134

lockdown levels by the end of the data series used for model fittings (solid portions of

135

the 𝑅, line), consistently with the CoMix contact survey7. To illustrate how the

136

epidemic may unfold beyond the data used in this study we simulate a hypothetical

137

scenario whereby contacts continue to reactivate linearly until eventually reaching the

138

pre-pandemic baseline. This leads to low epidemic activity over a period that

139

coincides with the Summer months, followed by a resurge as contacts intensify. This

140

resurgence is likely to be aggravated by seasonality as the Winter approaches,

141

although seasonality has not been included in our models. The percentage of the

142

population required to be immune to curb the epidemic and prevent future waves

143

when interventions are lifted appears remarkably conserved across models: 10 vs 11%

144

(Belgium); and 27 vs 25% (England).

145

We then fit to the same data the model constrained by 𝐶𝑉 = 0, i.e. assuming no

146

relevant heterogeneity in susceptibility or exposure to infection. The results are shown

147

in Figure 2. In this case epidemic potential is considerably larger and hence the effect

148

attributed to NPIs to fit the data must also be larger. The percentage of the population

149

required to be immune to prevent epidemic growth when interventions are lifted rises

150

to 73% (Belgium) and 63% (England).

151

Herd immunity thresholds

152

Individual variation in risk of acquiring infection is under selection by the force of

153

infection, whether individual differences are due to biological susceptibility,

154

exposure, or both. The most susceptible or exposed individuals are selectively

155

removed from the susceptible pool as they become infected and eventually recover

156

(some die), resulting in decelerated epidemic growth and accelerated induction of

157

immunity in the population. In essence, the herd immunity threshold defines the

158

percentage of the population that needs to be immune to reverse epidemic growth and

159

prevent future waves. When individual susceptibility or connectivity is gamma7

distributed and mixing is random, HIT curves can be derived analytically8 from the

161

model systems (Equations 1-4, with the respective forces of infections). In the case of

162

variation in susceptibility to infection we obtain

while variable connectivity results in

𝐻𝐼𝑇 = 1 − K
L
.
(1 − 𝜎)𝑅*

166

In more complex cases (such as the variable connectivity with dynamic CV or

167

assortative mixing) HIT curves can be approximated numerically. Figure 3 shows the

168

expected downward trends in HIT and the sizes of the respective unmitigated

169

epidemics for SARS-CoV-2 without reinfection (𝜎 = 0) as the coefficients of

170

variation are increased (here we adopt gamma distributions; for robustness of the

171

trends to other distributions see Gomes et al9). Values of 𝑅* and CV estimated for our

172

study countries are overlaid to mark the respective HIT and final epidemic sizes.

173

While herd immunity is expected to require 60-80% of a homogeneous population to

174

have been infected, at the cost of infecting almost the entire population if left

175

unmitigated, given an 𝑅* between 2.5 and 5, these percentages drop to the range 10-

176

20% when CV is roughly between 1.5 and 4.

177

When acquired immunity is not 100% effective (𝜎 > 0) HITs are relatively higher

178

(Extended Data Figure 3). However, there is an upper bound for how much it is

179

reasonable to increase 𝜎 before the system enters a qualitatively different regime.

181

and the HIT concept no longer applies. Respiratory viruses are typically associated

182

with epidemic dynamics below the reinfection threshold, characterized by seasonal

183

epidemics intertwined with periods of low detection.

184

Individual variation in exposure, in contrast with susceptibility, accrues from complex

185

patterns of human behaviour which have been simplified in our basic model. To

186

explore the scope of our results we generalised the models by relaxing some key

187

assumptions. First, we allowed connectivity distributions to change in shape (not only

188

scale) when subject to social distancing (Figure 1, bottom panels). Second, we enable

189

mixing to be assortative in the sense that individuals contact predominantly with those

190

of similar connectivity (Methods). Formally, an individual with connectivity 𝑥, rather

191

than being exposed uniformly to individuals of all connectivities 𝑦, has contact

192

preferences described by a normal distribution on the difference 𝑦 − 𝑥. We find this

193

modification to have negligible effect on HIT (Extended Data Figure 4).

194

Herd immunity thresholds and seroprevalence at sub-national levels

195

As countries conduct immunological surveys to assess the extent of exposure to

196

SARS-CoV-2 in populations it is of practical importance to understand how HIT may

197

vary across regions. We have redesigned our analyses to address this question. Series

198

of daily new cases in 4 European countries (Belgium, England, Portugal and Spain)

199

were stratified by region. Fitting the models simultaneously to the multiple series

200

enabled the estimation of local parameters (𝑅* and CV) while the effects of NPIs

201

were estimated at country level. Extended Data Figures 5-8 show how the modelled

202

epidemics fit the regional data and include an additional metric to describe the

203

cumulative infected percentage. These model projections are comparable to data from

204

seroprevalence studies such as in Spain12. In addition to their practical utility these

205

results begin to unpack some of the variation in HIT within countries: Belgium (9.4-

206

11%), England (16-26%), Portugal (7.1-9.9%) and Spain (7.5-21%). The sub-national

207

stratification has also enabled the application of the models to countries where the

208

epidemic was sufficiently asynchronous across regions to compromise the ability of

209

the models to fit the aggregate data (Portugal and Spain).

210

Discussion

211

The concept of herd immunity was developed in the context of vaccination

212

programs13,14. Defining the percentage of the population that must be immune to

213

cause infection incidences to decline, HITs constitute useful targets for vaccination

214

coverage. In idealized scenarios of vaccines delivered at random and individuals

215

mixing at random, HITs are given by a simple formula (1 − 1⁄𝑅* ) which, in the case

216

of SARS-CoV-2, suggests that 60-80% of randomly chosen subjects of the population

217

would need be immunized to halt spread considering estimates of 𝑅* between 2.5 and

218

5. This formula does not apply to infection-induced immunity because natural

219

infection does not occur at random. Individuals who are more susceptible or more

220

exposed are more prone to be infected and become immune, providing greater

221

community protection than random vaccination15. In our model, the HIT declines

222

sharply when coefficients of variation increase from 0 to 2 and remains below roughly

223

20% for more variable populations. The magnitude of the decline depends on what

224

property is heterogeneous and how it is distributed among individuals, but the

225

downward trend is robust as long as susceptibility or exposure to infection are

226

variable (Figure 3 and Extended Data Figures 4) and acquired immunity is efficacious

227

enough to keep transmission below the reinfection threshold (Extended Data Figure

228

3).

229

Several candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are showing promising safety and

230

immunogenicity in early-phase clinical trials16,17, although it is not yet known how

231

this will translate into effective protection. We note that the reinfection threshold10,11

232

informs not only the requirements on naturally acquired immunity but, similarly, it

233

sets a target for how efficacious a vaccine needs to be in order to effectively interrupt

234

transmission. Specifically, given an estimated value of 𝑅* we should aim for a

235

vaccine efficacy of 1 − 1⁄𝑅* (60% or 80% if 𝑅* is 2.5 or 5, respectively), which

236

seems to be materialising according to preliminary results from phase 3 trials.

237

Heterogeneity in the transmission of respiratory infections has traditionally focused

238

on variation in exposure summarized into age-structured contact matrices. Besides

239

overlooking differences in susceptibility given exposure, the aggregation of

240

individuals into age groups reduces coefficients of variation. We calculated CV for

241

the landmark POLYMOD matrices18,19 and obtained values between 0.3 and 0.5.

242

Recent studies of COVID-19 integrated contact matrices with age-specific

243

susceptibility to infection (structured in three levels)20 or with social activity (three

244

levels also)21 which, again, resulted in coefficients of variation less than unity. We

245

show that models with coefficients of variation of this magnitude would appear to

246

differ only moderately from homogeneous approximations when compared with our

247

estimates, which are consistently above 1 in England and above 2 in Belgium,

248

Portugal and Spain. In contrast with reductionist procedures that aim to reconstruct

249

variation from correlate markers left on individuals (such as antibody or reactive T

250

cells for susceptibility, or contact frequencies for exposure), we have embarked on a

251

holistic approach designed to infer the whole extent of individual variation from the

252

imprint it leaves on epidemic trajectories. Our estimates are therefore expected to be

253

higher and should ultimately be confronted with more direct measurements as these

254

become available. Adam at et22 conducted a contact tracing study in Hong Kong and

255

estimated a coefficient of variation of 2.5 for the number of secondary infections

256

caused by individuals, attributing 80% of transmission to 20% of cases. This

257

statistical dispersion has been interpreted as reflecting a common pattern of contact

258

heterogeneity which has been corroborated by studies that specifically measure

259

mobility23. According to our inferences, 20% of individuals may be responsible for

260

47-94% infections depending on model and country. In parallel, there is accumulating

261

evidence of individual variation in the immune system¢s ability to control SARS-

262

CoV-2 infection following exposure24,25. While our inferences serve their purpose of

263

improving accuracy in model predictions, diverse studies such as these are necessary

264

for developing interventions targeting individuals who may be at higher risk of being

265

infected and propagating infection in the community.

266

Country-level estimates of 𝑅* reported here (Figures 1, 2) are in the range 3-5 when

267

individual variation in susceptibility is factored and 4-9 when accounting for variation

268

in connectivity. The homogeneous version of our models would have estimated 𝑅*

269

around 2.7 and 3.7, in line with other studies26. Estimates for England suggest lower

270

baseline 𝑅* and lower CV in comparison with Belgium. The net effect is a slightly

271

higher HIT in England which nevertheless we estimate around 25-27% depending on

272

characteristics of the individual variation. NPIs reveal less impact when heterogeneity

273

is contemplated (37-60%), appearing to inflate and agree with Flaxman et al26 when

274

homogeneity assumptions are made (66-78%), although this does not affect the HIT

275

which relates to pre-pandemic societies.

276

More informative than reading these numbers, however, is to look at simulated

277

projections of how cases may unfold over future months (Figures 1, 2). In both

countries, when individual variation is considered, we foresee HIT being achieved

279

and the COVID-19 epidemic being mostly resolved by the end of 2020. Under the

280

homogeneous approximation, however, epidemic potential appears to justify

281

considerations of second lockdowns to flatten epidemic curves. Determining the level

282

of confidence on either scenario is highly relevant to policy decisions and hence of

283

central importance to public health. According to the Akaike information criterion

284

(Extended Data Table 5) data favours the models that account for individual variation

285

and a more natural resolution for the pandemic. Models that account for individual

286

variation in susceptibility score particularly well and amongst those that account for

287

variation in exposure those that allow this variation to reduce with social distancing

288

perform better.

289

Looking back, we conclude that NPIs had a crucial role in halting the growth of the

290

initial wave between February and April irrespective of individual variation. Although

291

the most extreme lockdown strategies may not be sustainable for longer than a month

292

or two, they proved effective at preventing overshoot, keeping cases within health

293

system capacities, and may have done so without impairing the development of herd

294

immunity.

413

METHODS

414

Model structure and underlying assumptions

415

The model presented here is a differential equation SEIR model, where susceptible

416

individuals become exposed at a rate that depends on their susceptibility, the number

417

of potentially infectious contacts they engage in, and the total number of infectious

418

people in the population per time unit. Upon exposure, individuals enter an

419

asymptomatic incubation phase, during which they slowly become infectious27-30.

420

Thus, infectivity of exposed individuals is made to be 1/2 of that of infectious ones

421

(𝜌 = 0.5). After a few days, individuals develop symptoms – on average 4 days after

422

the exposure to the virus (𝛿 = 1/4) – and thus become fully infectious31-33. They

423

recover, i.e., they are no longer infectious 4 days after that (𝛾 = 1/4), on average34.

424

Efficacy of acquired immunity

425

We conducted the core of our analysis under the assumption that no reinfection occurs

426

after recovery due to acquired immunity (𝜎 = 0). To analyse the sensitivity of these

427

results to leakage in immune response (𝜎 > 0) we calculated herd immunity

428

thresholds (HIT) as a function of coefficients of variation (CV) for different values of

429

𝜎. The results displayed in Extended Data Figure 3 confirm the expectation that as the

430

efficacy of acquired immunity decreases (𝜎 increases) larger percentages of the

431

population are infected before herd immunity is reached. Less intuitive is that there is

432

an upper bound for how much it is reasonable to increase 𝜎 before the system enters a

433

qualitatively different regime – the reinfection threshold10,11 (𝜎 = 1⁄𝑅* ) – above

434

which infection becomes stably endemic and the notion of herd immunity threshold

435

no longer applies. Respiratory viruses are typically associated with epidemics

436

dynamics below the reinfection threshold.

437

Effective reproduction number

438

The effective reproduction number (𝑅-.. , also denoted by 𝑅- or 𝑅4 by other authors)

439

is a time-dependent quantity which we calculate as the incidence of new infections

440

divided by the total number of active infections (affected by 𝜌 for individuals in 𝐸)

441

multiplied by the average duration of infection (also affected by 𝜌 for individuals in

442

𝐸)

443

𝑅-.. (𝑡) =

444

Assortative mixing

445

In the main text we assumed random mixing among individuals, but human

446

connectivity patterns are assortative due societal structures and human behaviours. To

447

explore the sensitivity of our results to deviations from random mixing, we develop

448

an extended formalism that allows individuals to connect preferentially with those

449

with similar connectivity, formally 𝜆(𝑥) =

450

(𝛽 ⁄𝑁)(∫ 𝑦 ℎ(𝑦 − 𝑥)[𝜌𝐸(𝑦) + 𝐼(𝑦)] 𝑑𝑦⁄∫ 𝑦𝑔(𝑦) 𝑑𝑦), where ℎ(𝑦 − 𝑥) is a normal

451

distribution on the difference between connectivity factors (Extended Data Figure 2).

452

Non-pharmaceutical interventions

453

We implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) as a gradual decrease in

454

viral transmissibility in the population and thus a lowering of the controlled and

455

effective reproduction numbers (𝑅, and 𝑅-.. ). Once containment measures are put in

456

place in each country, we postulate it takes 21 days until the maximum effectiveness

457

of social distancing measures is reached, approximately linearly. In the simulations

458

presented throughout we have held this condition (maximum “lockdown” efficacy)

459

for 𝑇/01 days, where 𝑇/01 is estimated for each study country in countrywide

460

analyses and fixed at 30 in regional analyses. Eventually, lockdowns were lifted and

461

social distancing measures progressively relaxed. This relaxation is implemented

462

linearly over a period of 𝑇23.4 days, which is also estimated. We note however that the

463

estimation of epidemiological parameters is not affected by the shape assumed for the

464

relaxation of interventions beyond the date of the last data point (June 11th in Belgium

465

and July 1st in England). In particular, assuming that social distancing measures

466

remained constant from these dates onwards, for example, would make no difference

467

to the estimated parameters.

468

Bayesian Inference

469

The model laid out above is amenable to theoretical exploration as presented in the

470

main manuscript and provides a perfect framework for inference. Fundamentally, to

471

be able to reproduce the inception of any epidemic, we would need to estimate when

472

local transmission started to occur (𝑡* ), and the pace at which individuals infected

473

each other in the very early stages of the epidemic (𝑅* ). All countries, to different

474

extents and at different timepoints of the epidemic, enforced some combination of

475

social distancing measures. To fully understand the interplay between herd immunity

476

and the impact of NPIs, we then set out to estimate the time at which social distancing

477

measures started to have an impact on daily incidence (𝑡*9 ), what their maximum

478

efficacy (𝑑/01 ) was and how long it lasted (𝑇/01 ), a parameter used to determine the

479

rate at which contacts resume as restrictions are lifted (𝑇23.4 , which more specifically

480

represents the time it would take to reach pre-pandemic contact intensity should the

481

lifting of restricting have linear effect), the basic reproduction number (𝑅* ) and what

482

the underlying variance in heterogeneity is for susceptibility or exposure to infection.

483

In order to preserve identifiability, we made two simplifying assumptions: (i) the

484

fraction of infectious individuals reported as COVID-19 cases (reporting fraction) is

485

constant throughout the study period and is comparable between countries

486

proportionally to the number of tests performed per person; (ii) local transmission

487

starts (𝑡* ) when countries/regions report 1 case per 5 million population in one day.

488

To calculate the reporting rates, we used the Spanish national serological survey12 as a

489

reference and divided the total number of reported cases up to May 11th by the

490

estimated number of people that had been exposed to the virus. This gives us a

491

reporting rate for Spain around 6%. Unfortunately, there are no other national

492

serological surveys that could inform the proportion of the population infected in

493

other countries, so we had to extrapolate the reporting rate for those. Assuming the

494

reporting rate is highly dependent on the testing effort employed in each country,

495

reflected in the number of tests per individual, we estimate the reporting rate by

496

scaling the reporting rate recorded in Spain according to the ratio of PCR tests per

497

person in other countries relative to the Spanish reference of 0.9 tests per thousand

498

people (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing). This produced estimated case

499

reporting rates (ratio of reported cases to infections) of 9% for Portugal, 6% for

500

Belgium (and Spain) and 2.4% for England.

501

Whist national case and mortality data is easily available for most countries, more

502

spatially resolute data is difficult to find in the public domain. Thus, we restricted our

503

analysis to countries for which disaggregated regional case data was easily available.

504

We collected the data at two time points. First, we compiled all available data from

505

the day the countries started reporting COVID-19 cases to the initial collection date

506

(May 20th) and later collated available data from May 21st to July 10th.

507

Parameter estimation was performed with the software MATLAB, using PESTO

508

(Parameter EStimation Toolbox)35, and assuming the reported case data can be

509

accurately described by a Poisson process. We first fixed the beginning of local

510

transmission (parameter 𝑡* ) in each data series as the day in which reported cases

511

surpassed 1 in 5 million individuals. Next, we optimized the model for the set of

512

parameters 𝜃 = {𝑅* , 𝐶𝑉, 𝑡*9 , 𝑑/01 , 𝑇/01 , 𝑇23.4 } by maximizing the logarithm of the

513

516

(with respect to 𝑡* ), and 𝑛 is the total number of days included in the analysis for each

517

country.

518

To ensure that the estimated maximum is a global maximum, we performed 50 multi-

519

starts optimizations, and selected the combination of parameters resulting in the

520

maximal Loglikelihood as a starting point for 108 Markov Chain Monte-Carlo

521

When fitting the model to disaggregated data, we follow the procedure outlined above

526

but fix 𝑇/01 = 30 days, 𝑇23.4 = 120 days and estimate region-specific 𝑅* and 𝐶𝑉,

527

with common 𝑡*9 and 𝑑/01 .

528

The countrywide fitting procedure was applied to 2 countries (Belgium and England)

529

and repeated for each of the 4 model variants considered here (homogeneous,

530

heterogeneous susceptibility, heterogeneous connectivity with constant CV, and

531

heterogeneous connectivity with CV reducing in proportion to social distancing). Our

532

study included two more countries (Portugal and Spain), where countrywide analyses

533

could not be performed due to the epidemic being geographically desynchronised. We

534

implemented stratified analyses on all 4 countries. In the fitting procedures using sub-

535

national data, we assumed regions had the same start date for interventions that

536

mitigate transmission (𝑡*9 ), and that these measures produced the same maximum

537

impact on transmission (𝑑/01 ) everywhere. Thus, the only region-specific parameters

538

to be estimated are {𝑅* 3 , 𝐶𝑉3 }. Parameter estimates obtained from each of the model

539

variants are displayed in Extended Data Table 1 (heterogeneity in susceptibility),

540

Extended Data Table 2 (heterogeneity in connectivity with constant CV), Extended

541

Data Table 3 (heterogeneity in connectivity with dynamic CV) and Extended Data

542

544

procedure to inform on the quality of each model’s fit to the datasets of reported cases

545

(Extended Data Table 5). In all cases, heterogeneous models are preferred over the

546

homogeneous approximation. The three heterogeneous models are roughly equally

547

well supported by the data used in this study. Further research should complement

548

this with discriminatory data types and hybrid models to enable the integration of

549

different forms of individual variation.

. Finally, we apply the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for each estimation

Extended Data Fig. 1| SARS-CoV-2 transmission with individual variation in

connectivity. Variation in connectivity (constant CV). Connectivity factors
implemented as gamma distributions. Suppressed wave and subsequent dynamics in
Belgium and England (orange). Estimated epidemic in the absence of interventions
revealing overshoot (black). Blue bars are daily new cases. Controlled (𝑅, ) and
effective (𝑅-.. ) reproduction numbers are displayed on shallow panels underneath the
main plots. Blue shades represent social distancing (intensity reflected in 𝑅, trends
and shade density). 𝑅, values in the dotted portion of the orange lines do not interfere
with the fittings and are only used to illustrate how the epidemic may unfold beyond
the data analysed here. Consensus parameter values (Methods): 𝛿 = 1/4 per day; 𝛾 =
1/4 per day; and 𝜌 = 0.5. Fraction of infected individuals identified as positive
(reporting fraction): 0.06 (Belgium); 0.024 (England). Basic reproduction number,
coefficients of variation and social distancing parameters estimated by Bayesian
inference as described in Methods (estimates in Extended Data Table 2). Curves
represent mean model predictions from 108 posterior samples. Orange shades
represent 95% credible intervals. Vertical lines represent the expected time when herd

variation in proportion to social distancing. Individual variation in connectivity is
originally implemented as a gamma distribution of mean 1 parameterised by the
coefficient of variation (CV) (black). Social distancing is initially implemented as a
reduction in connectivity by the same factor to every individual, from 𝑥 to (1 − 𝑑)𝑥
(top panels). A more general formulation where CV may reduce with social
distancing is implemented by modifying 𝑥 to (1 − 𝑑)[1 + (1 − 𝑑)(𝑥 − 1)] (bottom
panels).

Extended Data Fig. 3| Herd immunity threshold and epidemic final size with

reinfection. Curves in the main panels generated with the SEIR model (Equation 1-4)
assuming 𝑅* = 3 and gamma-distributed susceptibility (top) or connectivity (bottom)
with constant CV. Efficacy of acquired immunity is captured by a reinfection
parameter 𝜎, potentially ranging between 𝜎 = 0 (100% efficacy) and 𝜎 = 1 (0
efficacy). This illustration depicts final sizes of unmitigated epidemics and associated
HIT curves for 6 values of 𝜎: 𝜎 = 0 (black); 𝜎 = 0.1 (green); 𝜎 = 0.2 (blue); 𝜎 = 0.3
(magenta); 𝜎 = 1⁄3 (red); and 𝜎 = 0.4 (orange);. Above 𝜎 = 1⁄𝑅* (reinfection
threshold (Gomes et al 2004; 2016)) the infection becomes stably endemic and there
is no herd immunity threshold. Representative epidemics of the regime 𝜎 ≤ 1⁄𝑅* are
shown on the right while the regime 𝜎 > 1⁄𝑅* is illustrated on top. All depicted
dynamics are based on the rightmost CVs represented on the main panel.

Extended Data Fig. 4| Herd immunity threshold and epidemic final size with

gamma-distributed exposure to infection and assortative mixing. Curves in
central panel generated with the SEIR model (Equation 1-4) assuming 𝑅* = 3 and
gamma-distributed connectivity. Assortative mixing is implemented by imposing a
normal distribution for contact preferences such that individuals contact preferentially
with those with the similar contact degree (left). This illustration used normal
distributions with standard deviation 𝑆𝐷 = 50 (green); 𝑆𝐷 = 10 (blue); and 𝑆𝐷 = 2
(magenta). More assortative mixing leads to more skewed epidemics. Herd immunity
thresholds were calculated numerically as the percentage of the population no longer
susceptible when new outbreaks are effectively prevented (approximately when the
exposed fraction crosses the peak in the absence of mitigation). Final sizes of the
corresponding unmitigated epidemics are also shown. Representative epidemics are
depicted on the right based on the rightmost CVs represented on the main panel (with
vertical lines marking the point when herd immunity is achieved).

Extended Data Table 2| Estimated parameters for heterogeneous connectivity
model (constant CV). Estimates generated from model fit to the national datasets are
in the grey shaded rows. The remaining rows provide the region-specific estimates.
Best parameter estimates are presented as a bold median bounded by the lower and
upper ends for the 95% credible interval. Model runs are initiated on the day (𝒕𝟎 )
when reported cases surpassed 1 in 5 million individuals: Belgium (day 1); England
(day 29); Portugal (day 3); Spain (day 8).

Loglikelihood obtained for each combination of model and data partitioning for each
country, as well as the Akaike information criterion. Models are labelled by a sort
name as follows: homog (homogenous); hetsus (heterogeneity in susceptibility);
hetcon (heterogeneity in connectivity with constant CV); hetdyn (heterogeneity in
connectivity with dynamic CV).
