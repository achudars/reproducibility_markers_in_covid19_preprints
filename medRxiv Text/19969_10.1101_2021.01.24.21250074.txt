Abstract

32

Endemic human coronaviruses (hCoV) circulate worldwide but cause minimal mortality.

33

Although seroconversion to hCoV is near ubiquitous during childhood, little is known about

34

hCoV-specific T cell memory in adults. We quantified CD4 T cell and antibody responses to

35

hCoV spike antigens in 42 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected individuals. T cell responses were

36

widespread within conventional memory and cTFH compartments but did not correlate with IgG

37

titres. SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T cells were observed in 48% of participants and correlated

38

with HKU1 memory. hCoV-specific T cells exhibited a CCR6+ central memory phenotype in the

39

blood, but were enriched for frequency and CXCR3 expression in human lung draining lymph

40

nodes. Overall, hCoV-specific humoral and cellular memory are independently maintained, with

41

a shared phenotype existing among coronavirus-specific CD4 T cells. This understanding of

42

endemic coronavirus immunity provides insight into the homeostatic maintenance of immune

43

responses that are likely to be critical components of protection against SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

46

In contrast to the high pathogenicity of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

47

coronaviruses, endemic human coronaviruses (hCoV) circulate worldwide but typically cause

48

common colds with only limited morbidity and mortality1. Endemic hCoV encompass two alpha-

49

coronaviruses (aCoV), NL63 and 229E, and two beta-coronaviruses (bCoV), HKU1 and OC431.

50

Sero-epidemiological studies suggest that infection and seroconversion to hCoV occurs during

51

early childhood (typically by 4 years of age)2-4, although there are discrepant reports on the

52

prevalence of each virus within distinct geographical cohorts2,5. Despite the early development of

53

immunity against multiple hCoV, most adults remain susceptible to periodic reinfection6-8, with

54

increased susceptibility among immunocompromised individuals9-11. This suggests the

55

magnitude and/or quality of hCoV-targeted immunity in adults is insufficient for sterilizing

56

protection but instead may limit the burden of disease to asymptomatic or mild infection8.

57

Defining the extent of serological and/or cellular immunity required to protect individuals from

58

reinfection or severe disease remains a key question in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As

59

neutralizing responses wane after CoV infection, it is likely that a combination of serum

60

antibody and B cell / T cell memory provide longer-term protection from the recurrence of

61

disease12,13. The study of hCoV-specific T and B cell memory can therefore provide a key

62

preview into the development of durable, protective SARS-CoV-2 immunity.

63

Characterisation of population-level immunity to hCoV can also inform our understanding of

64

cross-reactive immune responses between high pathogenicity and endemic CoV. Studies of

65

SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity in uninfected individuals clearly demonstrate pre-existing

66

cross-reactive antibody14-16, B cell16 and T cell responses17-22. Nevertheless, it is currently

67

unclear what contribution, if any, cross-reactive immunity plays in modulating the response to

68

SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination23. Detailed analyses of cross-reactive T cells suggest the

69

majority of such responses are dominated by CD4 T cells and directed toward non-RBD epitopes

70

of the spike (S) protein18,21,24. To date, however, consensus regarding the origin of these cross-

71

reactive responses is lacking, with evidence both for18 and against25 a major contribution from

72

hCoV-specific memory T cells.

73

Deconvolution of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 responses and de novo SARS-CoV-2 immunity

74

requires a more detailed understanding of hCoV-specific serological and cellular memory.

75

Relatively little is known about population-level T or B cell memory to hCoV in adults, despite

76

evidence suggesting an impact of recent hCoV infection on COVID-19 severity26. Several

77

groups find widespread but modest CD4 T cell responses to hCoV proteins, with estimates for

78

the prevalence of memory responses ranging from 70-100% of study participants24,25,27.

79

Detection of hCoV-specific CD8 T cell responses has been less reported27, and the prevalence of

80

cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2-specific responses in these cohorts varies substantially24,25.

81

Furthermore, data comparing hCoV-specific T or B cell responses in the circulation with the

82

presence or absence of such responses in the respiratory tract or secondary lymphoid organs

83

(SLO) is lacking. Studies in animal models suggest that respiratory infections can generate long-

84

lived T cell memory in lung draining lymph nodes (LDLN)28, raising the possibility of analogous

85

responses following hCoV infection.

86

To address these knowledge gaps, we assessed the prevalence and phenotypic characteristics of

87

hCoV spike-specific antibody, memory T cell and memory B cell responses in a cohort of

88

SARS-CoV-2 uninfected adults. We find that the magnitude of hCoV immunity is independent

89

of age and is characterized by robust antibody titres, widespread CD4 T cell memory within both

90

Tmem and cTFH populations, and an enrichment of T cell memory in LDLN. In contrast,

91

neutralizing antibody activity is relatively low and memory B cells are infrequently detected in

92

either the circulation or LDLN. Overall, our data detail a consistent pattern of hCoV-specific

93

immune memory in the circulation and SLO which likely co-ordinate to provide long-term

94

protection from hCoV infection.

Results

96

hCoV-specific antibody and CD4 T cell memory is common among adults

97

We recruited a cohort of 42 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected adults (n=21 male, n=21 female), ranging

98

in age from 18-67 years with no recent cold or COVID-19 symptoms (Figure 1A). Consistent

99

with previous studies15,16, we detected baseline plasma antibody responses to one or more hCoV

100

S antigens in all participants, with substantially lower reactivity toward SARS-CoV-2 S (herein

101

CoV-2; Figure 1B). Plasma IgG endpoint titres for hCoV antigens ranged from 1:176 to 1:18268

102

(median 1:1485 for HKU1, IQR 1:886.8-2045; median 1:4475 for OC43, IQR 1:2082-6979;

103

median 1:2066 for 229E, IQR 1:1185-3789; median 1:1716 for NL63, IQR 1:1193-2731).

104
105

To determine the distribution of CD4 T cell memory responses, we stimulated PBMC with

106

recombinant S antigens and quantified antigen-specific Tmem (CD3+CD4+CD45RA+CXCR5-)

107

by measuring upregulation of the activation markers CD25 and OX-40 by flow cytometry (a

108

well-established activation-induced marker (AIM) assay29-31) (Figure 1C; gating in Supplemental

109

Figure 1). Across the cohort, 88% of individuals exhibited a memory response greater than

110

0.01% above background32 to any hCoV S antigen (Figure 1D). Interestingly, the prevalence of

111

responses was highest to HKU1 S (86% of participants), and lowest to NL63, with only 50% of

112

individuals exhibiting NL63 S-specific responses (Figure 1D). The magnitude of responses to

113

hCoV S antigens ranged from undetectable to a maximum of 0.84% of the Tmem compartment

114

(Figure 1E). Among individuals with above-background responses, median antigen-specific

115

Tmem frequencies were highest to HKU1 (median 0.133%, IQR 0.056-0.248, n=36), followed

116

by OC43 (median 0.106%, IQR 0.049-0.170, n=34), NL63 (median 0.093%, IQR 0.055-0.168,

117

n=21), and 229E (median 0.080%, IQR 0.050-0.124, n=27). Similar to other cohorts17,19, we find

118

48% of participants (n=20) demonstrated cross-reactive response to CoV-2 S with a median

119

frequency of 0.049% (IQR 0.027-0.160), despite no evidence of prior infection (Figure 1D/E). T

120

cell responses were similar when measured using either CD25/OX-40 or CD137/OX-4019 AIM

121

assays (Supplementary Figure 2A-C). Across the cohort, there was no relationship between the

122

total frequency of hCoV S-specific Tmem and age, or any association with gender

123

(Supplementary Figure 3A-B).

124
125

hCoV-specific CD4 Tmem are predominately TCM cells with a CCR6+ phenotype

126

Given divergent host receptor specificity and possible differences in tissue tropism among

127

hCoV1, we assessed whether memory or chemokine receptor phenotypes differed among S-

128

specific CD4 T cell populations (gating in Supplementary Figure 1B). Similar to the parental

129

Tmem population, hCoV S-specific and CoV-2 cross-reactive CD4 T cells were predominately

130

CD27+CCR7+, classically defined as central memory T cells (TCM; Figure 2A-B). In contrast to

131

the bulk Tmem population, however, hCoV S-specific cells were substantially enriched for

132

CCR6 expression (with or without co-expression of CXCR3; Figure 2C-D). When comparing

133

intra-individual responses, hCoV S-specific Tmem phenotypes were generally similar across all

134

S antigens (Figure 2E). Prior studies have also described a dominant CCR6 phenotype of CoV-2

135

S-specific Tmem among convalescent COVID-19 subjects33, and here we find that CoV-2 cross-

136

reactive responses are similarly highly CCR6 biased (Figure 2D-E).

137
138

hCoV reactivity is detected among circulating T follicular helper cell (TFH) memory

139

Circulating TFH cells (cTFH; CXCR5+CD45RA-) comprise a clonally34 and functionally29,35

140

distinct memory CD4 T cell population identified by CXCR5 expression. Activated cTFH

141

correlate with antibody responses to infection or vaccination, and are thought to be surrogates of

142

germinal centre (GC) TFH activity36,37. Resting cTFH, in contrast, may represent a long-lived,

143

homeostatic memory population from which recall responses can be elicited even years after

144

antigen exposure38-41. Like conventional Tmem, hCoV-specific and cross-reactive cTFH

145

responses were widely detected across the cohort (Figure 3A). The frequency of donors

146

exhibiting cTFH responses above 0.01% to each antigen was similar to that observed for Tmem

147

responses (90% for HKU1, 88% for OC43, 69% for 229E, 59% for NL63, 43% for CoV-2).

148

Median frequencies among responding donors were highest to HKU1 (median 0.241%, IQR

149

0.147-0.531), followed by OC43 (median 0.213%, IQR 0.126-0.424), 229E (median 0.126%,

150

IQR 0.061-0.340), NL63 (median 0.096%, IQR 0.050-0.210) and CoV-2 (median 0.085%, IQR

151

0.050-0.195) (Figure 3A).

152

Interestingly, hCoV responses comprised a greater proportion of the cTFH population compared

153

to the Tmem compartment in a paired analysis (p<0.002 for all hCoV antigens), with some

154

donors exhibiting a greater than 9-fold enrichment of hCoV-specific cells in the cTFH gate (data

155

for HKU1 shown in Figure 3B). Similar to Tmem, antigen-specific cTFH were highly enriched

156

for a CCR6+CXCR3- phenotype (Figure 3C-D). The phenotypes of HKU1- and CoV-2-specific

157

cTFH in SARS-CoV-2-uninfected donors are consistent with phenotypes previously described in

158

COVID-19 convalescent subjects29. Comparison of antigen-specific cTFH and Tmem cells

159

revealed a significant enrichment of the CCR6+CXCR3- phenotype among cTFH, including the

160

CoV-2 cross-reactive population (Figure 3E-F). These data suggest that while hCoV memory is

161

broadly observed among both Tmem and cTFH subsets, the frequency and phenotype of these

162

responses are, to a degree, subset-specific.

164

CoV-2 cross-reactive T cells correlate with HKU1 T cell memory

165

It is currently unclear whether CoV-2 cross-reactive T cell responses arise primarily from hCoV

166

memory or reflect cross-reactivity from a broad array of antigen specificities18,25. Among the

167

cohort, subjects with CoV-2 cross-reactive CD4 T cell responses frequently exhibited memory

168

responses to multiple hCoVs (Figure 4A). We assessed the relationship between the frequency of

169

CoV-2 and hCoV memory responses and found significant correlations only between βCoV and

170

CoV-2 cross-reactivity (p=0.006 for HKU1, p=0.018 for OC43; Figure 4B). This association is

171

consistent with a greater sequence homology among βCoV strains (CoV-2, HKU1 and OC43)

172

compared to the aCoV 229E and NL6342.42 Among the subset of donors with cross-reactive

173

responses, only HKU1 memory correlated with CoV-2 cross-reactivity (p=0.030, Figure 4B).

174

Interestingly, while almost all individuals with CoV-2 cross-reactive responses exhibited HKU1

175

and OC43 memory, the converse was not observed. Indeed, individuals with relatively similar

176

patterns of hCoV reactivity could exhibit notably different CoV-2 reactivity (Figure 4C). There

177

was no significant association of demographic characteristics among individuals with or without

178

CoV-2 cross-reactive responses, although the cross-reactive group did exhibit a greater

179

representation of women compared to those without cross-reactivity (p=0.06, Supplemental

180

Figure 3C-D). Given the association between HKU1 and CoV-2 T cell frequencies, we assessed

181

whether a particular phenotype of HKU-specific Tmem was related to the presence or absence of

182

cross-reactive responses, but found no such distinctions (Supplemental Figure 3E).

183
184

Cellular and humoral immune memory to hCoV are maintained independently

185

Studies of convalescent COVID-19 cohorts have demonstrated a strong correlation between

186

SARS-CoV-2-specific cTFH, memory B cells, binding IgG and serum neutralization19,29,32, as

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.24.21250074; this version posted January 26, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

187

expected from a coordinated acute immune response. To assess whether such associations are

188

maintained in long-term hCoV immunity, we explored correlations between antibody and T cell

189

responses across the cohort. Surprisingly, there was no relationship for any antigen between

190

plasma IgG endpoint titre and the frequency of either S-specific CD4 Tmem or cTFH (p>0.05 for

191

all; data for HKU1 and NL63 shown in Figure 5A). To gain greater insight into the coordination

192

of cellular and humoral hCoV memory, we undertook an in-depth interrogation of immunity to

193

NL63, which shares use of the cellular entry receptor ACE2 with SARS-CoV and CoV-2, and

194

therefore likely has similar tissue tropisms in vivo.

195

To assess S-specific MBC and quantify plasma neutralising activity, NL63 S-specific memory B

196

cell (MBC) probes were generated as described previously29, and a novel NL63 pseudovirus-

197

based neutralization assay was performed with 293T cells stably expressing hACE2 as targets.

198

MBC specific for NL63 and CoV-2 S were detected infrequently among the cohort, particularly

199

in comparison to the frequency of CoV-2 S-specific MBC previously reported among COVID-19

200

convalescent donors29 (Figure 5B). Accordingly, the frequency of NL63 S-specific MBC did not

201

correlate with plasma NL63 binding IgG titres (Figure 5C). Plasma neutralising activity against

202

NL63 pseudovirus was detected among all donors tested, with a median IC50 of 100.7 (n=12,

203

IQR 56.6-234.6). Neutralising activity strongly correlated with NL63 S-specific antibody titres

204

(p=0.006) but was not associated with NL63 S-specific MBC frequencies (Figure 5D). We did,

205

however, observe a trend toward a positive correlation of neutralization with NL63 S-specific

206

cTFH responses (p= 0.081; Figure 5E). Given our prior observation that CCR6+ CoV-2 S-

207

specific cTFH responses were inversely associated with neutralizing antibodies after COVID-

208

1929, we assessed the correlation between NL63 neutralising activity and NL63 S-specific cTFH

209

phenotype (for donors with NL63 S-specific cTFH responses, n=7). Interestingly, the frequency

210

of CCR6+ cTFH again negatively correlated with plasma neutralization activity (p=0.048; Figure

211

5E), although the small sample size is a caveat of this analysis.

212
213

Enrichment of HKU1 and NL63 S-specific T cells in lung-draining lymph nodes

214

Although assessment of hCoV immunity has been primarily limited to peripheral blood, studies

215

suggest that repeated infections with respiratory viruses can seed long-lived memory T cell

216

responses in lung and lung-draining lymph nodes (LDLN)28,43.28,43 We therefore assessed the

217

frequency of HKU1, NL63 and CoV-2 S-specific CD4 T cell responses in matched LDLN (n=5)

218

and lung samples (n=6) from a human tissue biobank (gating in Supplementary Figure 5). We

219

detected robust HKU1 and NL63 responses within the CD45RA- CD4 T cell population of

220

LDLN (Figure 6A). Given the higher levels of background T cell activation in SLO compared to

221

peripheral blood, we validated the specificity of the hCoV responses by confirming that antigen

222

stimulation also drove expression of CD154 on OX-40+ cells (Figure 6A). Among the 5 donors

223

studied, the median frequency of HKU1 and NL63 S-specific Tmem was 1.2% (range 0.12-2.19)

224

and 1.12% (range 0.31-4.04), respectively (Figure 6B). Reactivity to CoV-2 S was substantially

225

lower, with a median of 0.07% (range 0.01-0.99). Similar antigen-specific responses were

226

observed within the CD4+CD45RA-CXCR5+ population (Figure 6B). There was limited to no

227

evidence of ongoing hCoV S-specific GC TFH activity among the samples (data not shown).

228

In contrast to the high frequencies of hCoV-specific CD4 T cells in LDLN, we found only

229

modest hCoV reactivity among lung-derived CD4 T cells (Supplementary Figure 6A-B). These

230

data are consistent with reports that tissue resident T cells (TRM) in the lung are relatively short-

231

lived compared to other tissues44. Furthermore, the majority of AIM+ cells did not exhibit a

232

CD69+CD103+ phenotype, suggesting they are unlikely to represent bona fide lung-resident T

233

cells45 (Supplementary Figure 6C). Similarly, we found little evidence for the presence of NL63

234

or CoV-2 cross-reactive MBC in either the LDLN or lung tissues (Supplementary Figure 6D-E).

235
236

It has been speculated that the dominant CCR6+ phenotype of CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells may

237

reflect preferential homing of these cells to the lung32.32 We therefore compared the

238

CCR6/CXCR3 phenotypes of hCoV-specific T cells in LDLN to the peripheral blood obtained

239

from the unmatched healthy adult cohort presented in Figures 2-3. After adjustment for baseline

240

activation, we found that LDLN-derived hCoV S-specific Tmem exhibited a predominately

241

CXCR3+ phenotype, with a substantial population of CCR6-CXCR3+ cells (median 37.7% for

242

HKU1, 37.5% for NL63; Figure 6C-D). In contrast, only 10.8% and 11.2% of circulating HKU1

243

and NL63 S-specific Tmem among the blood donor cohort were CCR6-CXCR3+ (Figure 2D). As

244

we previously observed for cTFH in the periphery, CXCR5+ hCoV-specific T cells in the LDLN

245

remained more likely to express CCR6 than their Tmem counterparts (Figure 6E-F).

246

Nevertheless, LDLN-derived hCoV-specific CXCR5+ cells were enriched for CXCR3 expression

247

(median 30.7% CCR6-CXCR3+ for HKU1, 19.4% for NL63) compared to the phenotypes

248

observed among peripheral cTFH (median 6.6% CCR6-CXCR3+ for HKU1, 9.8% for NL63;

249

Figure 6E-F, Figure 3D). Collectively, these data suggest either differential retention or

250

formation of CXCR3+ hCoV S-specific CD4 T cells in LDLN compared to peripheral blood.

Discussion

252

Despite periodic re-infection, most adults experience only mild or asymptomatic hCoV infection,

253

suggesting the presence of at least partially protective immune memory. We find that, in addition

254

to near-universal plasma antibody reactivity to hCoV, memory T cell responses to both a- and

255

bCoV are widespread. In contrast, the relatively modest neutralization activity against NL63 and

256

low frequencies of S-specific MBC suggest that sterilizing humoral immunity is likely absent.

257

Instead, additive contributions of multiple arms of adaptive immunity, in particular anti-viral T

258

cell responses, may underpin protection.

259

While several studies have quantified hCoV-specific T cell responses in adult cohorts24,25,27, it

260

was unclear whether the different viruses would elicit phenotypically distinct Tmem or cTFH

261

responses. Together with studies of convalescent SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses29,32, our

262

data suggest that the CCR6+ phenotype of circulating hCoV-specific CD4 memory cells may be

263

broadly reflective of coronavirus infection in humans. Indeed, AIM-based assays have

264

consistently identified a high proportion of CCR6+CXCR3- cells among SARS-CoV-2 S-specific

265

CD4 T cells29,32, in spite of low IL-17 production following antigen stimulation22,29,32.

266

Interestingly, longitudinal follow-up of COVID-19 convalescent subjects indicated a time-

267

dependent increase in the proportion of CCR6+ S-specific cTFH33, suggesting a convergence of

268

phenotypes between CoV-2-specific and hCoV-specific cTFH memory over time.

269

Chemokine receptor expression on CD4 T cells is often used as a surrogate of cytokine

270

expression and Th1/Th2/Th17 function, but these receptors also regulate lymphocyte trafficking

271

to SLO and tissues. While there was little evidence for hCoV S-specific T cell memory in the

272

lung, both HKU1 and NL63 responses were robustly detected in LDLN. The enrichment of

273

CXCR3+ hCoV T cell responses in LDLN compared to peripheral blood suggests a potential

274

involvement of CXCR3 expression in recruitment or retention of these cells out of the

275

circulation. These data are consistent with observations in other respiratory infections, where

276

CXCR3 mediates lung trafficking of antigen-specific CD4 T cells46,47. Future studies will be

277

required to address the role, if any, for these cells in contributing to protection from re-exposure

278

to CoV infection.

279

Consistent with other cohorts17,19, we find evidence for CoV-2 cross-reactive CD4 T cells in

280

uninfected donors. In vitro expansion of CoV-2 cross-reactive T cell clones has demonstrated the

281

potential for shared specificity with all hCoV18,24. However at a cohort-wide level, we find the

282

frequency of CoV-2 cross-reactive cells correlates most strongly with HKU1 memory, although

283

no immediate immunological or demographic features distinguish HKU1-reactive individuals

284

with or without cross-reactive CoV-2 responses. Larger population-based studies will be required

285

to determine any associations between particular HLA class II alleles and cross-reactive CD4

286

responses. Although it has been speculated that pre-existing cross-reactive T cell immunity could

287

be beneficial in the context of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines23, it should be noted that only CXCR3+,

288

but not CCR6+, cTFH responses appear to correlate with neutralizing antibody titres during

289

COVID-19 convalescence29,31,48. While recall of the CCR6+ cTFH could induce expression of

290

CXCR3, currently available evidence suggests the highly CCR6-biased responses to hCoV may

291

not be beneficial in the context of vaccination or re-exposure.

292

Overall, these data clarify the characteristics of long-term immunity to endemic coronaviruses,

293

which have comparable magnitudes and share phenotypic features of S-specific antibody and T

294

cell memory across all four hCoV. Insight into the homeostatic maintenance of hCoV immunity

295

is likely to provide a preview of long-term CoV-2-specific immunity established in the

296

population after vaccination or wide-spread infection.

Methods
Subject recruitment and sample collection

300

SARS-CoV-2 uninfected controls were recruited as part of a previous COVID-19 study29, and

301

relevant demographic characteristics are indicated in Figure 1A. For all participants, whole blood

302

was collected with sodium heparin anticoagulant. Plasma was collected and stored at -80ºC, and

303

PBMCs were isolated via Ficoll Paque separation, cryopreserved in 10% DMSO/FCS and stored

304

in liquid nitrogen. The study protocols and sample use were approved by the University of Melbourne

305

Human Research Ethics Committee (#2056689) and all associated procedures were carried out in

306

accordance with the approved guidelines. All participants provided written informed consent in

307

accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

308

The use of tissue samples from human donors was approved by The University of Melbourne

309

Human Research Ethics Committee (#1954691) and all associated procedures were carried out in

310

accordance with approved guidelines. Tissues were collected from 6 donors: male, age 40-50, brain

311

death; female, 30-40, brain death; male, 30-40, circulatory death; male, 50-60, brain death; female,

312

60-70, brain death; female, 50-60, brain death. Tissues were passed through 70µM filters and

313

homogenised into single cell suspensions, which were subsequently cryopreserved in 10% DMSO/FCS.

328

Antibody binding to recombinant S proteins was determined by ELISA as previously

329

described29. Briefly, 96-well Maxisorp plates (Thermo Fisher) were coated overnight at 4oC with

330

2µg/mL recombinant S , blocked with 1% FCS in PBS, and incubated with plasma dilutions for

331

two hours at room temperature. Plates were washed, incubated with 1:20,000 dilution of HRP-

332

NL63 pseudovirus neutralisation assay

368

HIV-based lentivirus particles pseudotyped with S from NL63 were generated based on a

369

previously published protocol50. Lenti-X 293T cells (TakaraBio) were co-transfected with a

370

lentiviral backbone plasmid expressing Luciferase-IRES-ZsGreen (BEI Resources; NR-52948),

371

helper plasmids encoding HIV Tat, Gag-Pol and Rev (BEI Resources; NR-52948) and a

372

pseudotyping plasmid encoding native NL63 S protein (DQ445911.1). Lenti-X 293T cells were

373

seeded in T175 flasks (18×106 cells/flask) and transfected using lipofectamine (ThermoFisher

374

Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions. At 6 hours after transfection, cell culture

375

media was replaced with 36ml of fresh D10 media (DMEM with 10% FCS and 1% PSG). After

376

another 48 hours of incubation, cell culture supernatants containing virions were clarified via

377

centrifugation at 500g for 10 min, filtered through a 0.45µM PES filter and stored at -80ºC.

378

Infectivity of virions was determined by titration on 293T-ACE2 cells (BEI resources; NR-52511).

379
380

For the NL63 pseudovirus neutralisation assay, poly-L-lysine (Sigma Aldrich) coated 96-well

381

white plates (Interpath) were seeded with 293T-ACE2 cells (12,000 cells per well in 60µl). The

382

next day, eight 2-fold serial dilutions of plasma (60µl) were incubated with NL63 pseudovirus

383

(60µl) for 1 hour at 37ºC (final plasma dilution of 1:20-1:2,560). Plasma-pseudovirus mixtures

384

(100µl) were then added to 293T-ACE2 cells and incubated at 37ºC for 48 hours. Plasma samples

385

were tested in triplicate, with “virus+cells” and “virus only” controls included to represent 100%

386

and 0% infectivity respectively. After 48 hours, all cell culture media was carefully removed from

387

wells. Cells were lysed with 25µl of passive lysis buffer (Promega), incubated on an orbital shaker

388

for 15 mins and developed with 30µl britelite plus luciferase reagent (Perkin Elmer).

389

Luminescence was read using a FLUOstar Omega microplate reader (BMG Labtech). The relative

390

light units (RLU) measured were used to calculate %neutralisation with the following formula:
