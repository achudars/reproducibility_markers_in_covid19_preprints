A BSTRACT
The reproduction number is an indicator of the evolution of an epidemic. Consequently, accurate
estimators for this number are essential for decision making in politics. Many estimators use filtered
data as input to compensate for fluctuations of reported cases. However, for daily-based estimations,
this filtering leads to delays. Some approaches use small window sizes for filtering to overcome this
issue. This, in turn, leads to an increased periodic behavior of estimators. To overcome these issues,
in the present paper, we introduce an estimator for the reproduction number that uses an acausally

Delay-robust Estimation of the Reproduction Number

filtered number of cases as input, hence avoiding both the periodic behavior and the delay. For the
filter size, we suggest using a multiple of one week since reported cases often exhibit a weekly pattern.
We show that this approach is more robust against periodicities, and that it does not exhibit any delays
in the estimation compared to estimators with smaller filter sizes.
Moreover, often it is hard to examine estimators in detail because a ground truth is missing. For
analyzing different properties of the estimators, we propose a method to generate synthetic datasets
that can be taken as ground truths. Importantly, the synthetic data contains all relevant real-world
behavior.
Finally, we apply the proposed estimator to the publicly available coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) data for Germany. We compare the proposed estimator to two estimators used by the federal
German Robert Koch Institut (RKI). We observe that our estimator is more stable than the benchmarks
especially if the reproduction number is close to 1. Based on the observation that the proposed
estimator appears more robust, it may be a useful asset when considering governmental interventions.

1 Introduction
Epidemiologists employ the (basic) reproduction number R(t) at time t to quantify the “average number of people
infected by a typical case” [9]. Albeit an average number, its importance for policymakers is unquestionable, providing
a threshold for the spread of diseases (R(t) > 1) or their confinement (R(t) < 1). For instance, many governmental
interventions during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic were and are unfortunately based on too-large
estimates of the reproduction number R(t) [8]. Clearly, accurate daily estimates of R(t) are of paramount relevance for
taking further future actions. However, it is also the past that deserves attention: did the estimates of the reproduction
number R(t) justify and show effectiveness of past interventions? Although the existing literature is rich on both kinds
of problems, various challenges remain:
• Real-world data is (often) incomplete; often the available data pertains only to confirmed cases and to confirmed
deaths.
• Moreover, the records are delayed. Figure 1 shows the connection and delays between a model of some disease
and the necessary testing and reporting—all of which contributes to the (lagging) reported records.
• A further challenge is that the estimated number of cases N̂ (t) at time t might be changed retrospectively.
The cause of this effect is the delay in reporting. This delay leads to a changing data basis between two
calculations of the nowcasting1 model on two subsequent days. Consequently, the result of the nowcasting
model changes. Especially for daily-based estimation, this is hard to handle. Thus, in the literature, delay
patterns and probabilities of misreporting are used for overcoming this issue. However, such values change
during an epidemic. Moreover, since delays are often caused by weekends or public holidays, they lead to
periodicities in the reported data, which challenge estimators too.
• Finally, the reproduction number is not observable; it is an artificial, computed number. Consequently, no
ground truth is available. However, ground truths are necessary for calculating error measures, and for verifying
and justifying a posteriori the decisions that were taken for example by governments. The only observable
data are the reported (C(t)), nowcasted (N̂ (t)) and the estimated number of deaths (compare Figure 1).
In light of the above challenges, the present paper contributes twofold:
• We provide a periodicity-aware estimator for the reproduction number R(t). We show that it outperforms two
existing approaches in use by the German Robert Koch Institut (RKI) for the raging COVID-19 pandemic. Our
proposed estimator uses an acausal filter; it relies on values from the past, the present, and the future. The
future values for calculating R(t) are predicted based on the previous week. This projected acausal filtering
can cope with periodicities, much better so than causally filtered approaches with filter sizes less than one
week. Also, around the critical threshold of R(t) ≈ 1 the proposed estimator is more robust.

Often, the current state of epidemic are not known or uncertain, e.g., the current number of cases is not immediately available.
Therefore, these values are estimated based on past values. This is denoted as nowcasting.

• We provide a synthetic yet realistic data set, which is based on predefined values of R(t). Consequently,
this data set provides a defined ground truth that allows to compare existing estimators to the proposed one.
Moreover, for making the data set more realistic, we incorporate delays that are derived from real-world data
about the COVID-19 outbreak in Germany.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 summarizes related work on R(t)-estimators. Section 3
introduces the proposed estimator. Subsequently, Section 4 presents the data generation. Afterwards, Section 5 evaluates
the estimators on the synthetic dataset. In Section 6, we apply the estimator to the records of the COVID-19 epidemic in
Germany. Finally, we wrap up our contributions and give an outlook on future research in Section 7.

2 Related Work
There exists a rich literature on estimating the reproduction number R(t); we merely provide snapshots for the sake of
brevity. For instance, Fraser shows how to compute the reproduction number from a combination of historical data and a
probability of infection from a case i days ago [9]. In contrast, Cintrón-Arias et al. derive the reproduction number R(t)
from the modeling parameters of a standard susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model [6]. Instead, Thompson et al.
first estimate the serial interval—the time between two cases in a transmission chain— and then use a causal filter to
estimate R(t). Chowell et al. compare four methods for estimating R(t) of the Spanish flu in San Francisco from 1918
to 1919 [5].
The rapid spread of COVID-19 across the globe has led to tremendous research efforts on estimating reproduction
numbers. For instance, the German RKI relies on nowcasting to estimate the value of R(t) [2]. It uses nowcasting
to account for reporting delays, and it imputes missing values. Other papers focus on the effect of interventions.
For instance, Khailaie et al. examine the impact of interventions on the reproduction number R(t) in Germany [12],
Hyafil and Morina focus on Spain [10], and Leung et al. estimate R(t) in various Chinese cities and provinces [13].
Additionally, Leung et al. evaluate different intervention strategies. The results from [4] indicate that the changes
in R(t) are caused directly by interventions instead of gradual changes in the behavior. Dehning et al. combine Bayesian
frameworks and an SIR-model to evaluate the time dependence of the effective growth rate [7]. Additionally, Dehning
et al. identify three change points in the growth rate of COVID-19 in Germany—all of which correspond to governmental
interventions [7]. Zhang et al. provide a similar study that analyzes the effect of interventions, but the work is extend to
examine the interplay between age, contact pattern, social distancing, risk of infection, and infectioness [19]; for their
work the authors conducted surveys in Wuhan and Shanghai. Park et al. compute the basic reproduction number with
uncertainties [15], and Tariq et al. estimate the reproduction number by analyzing clusters of cases as well as by case
incidences [17].
There are other studies inspired by the problems of delay patterns and/or misreporting. Azmon et al. evaluate R(t)estimators by using simple artificial delay patterns [3]. Another example is the work of Abbott et al., which aims to
reduce the effect of delays. To do so the authors use a delay—extracted from historical data—to calculate the onset date
out of the date of the report. However, the authors do not consider weekday-dependent periodicities [1].
It should be noted that there often exists the assumption that nowcasting approaches implicitly mitigate weekly delay
patterns. However, this is only the case if the nowcasting is nearly perfect. Furthermore, often filters with a length of
one week are used for coping with periodic behavior of the delays. However, in most cases, the impact on the delays for
fast changes of the reproduction number R(t) is not examined.

Estimating R(t) via Filtering

Broadly speaking, there are two paradigms to computing reproduction numbers: employing “compartmental models” or
“time-since-infection models” [9]. We follow the latter approach as described in [9], according to which there exists the
following relation between the number of cases N (t) at time t and the (instantaneous) reproduction number R(t)
R(t) =

N (t)

where tgen is the so-called generation time [14, 11].

Estimators based on Equation (1) alone suffer from periodicities—which often occur in time-series. Thus, many
approaches seek to reduce the influence of periodicities, for example, by using filters with the size of one typical period,
e.g. a week.
In the following, we present one existing approach which uses causal filtering. Afterwards, we propose two further
approaches which are based on acausal filtering. Figure 2 shows the connection between the three approaches: the
causal filter is based on data from the past and the present; the acausal filter is based on data from the past, the present,
and the future, but there are no means to determine the future values from the present; the projected filter uses data from
the past, the present, and the future, and future values are projected from the past.
All three approaches are inspired by Equation (1) and have the form
Rx,` (t) =

N̂x,` (t)
N̂x,` (t − tgen )

,

(3)

where t is the time, tgen is the generation time, ` is the filter length, N̂ is the nowcasted number of cases, and the
subscript x ∈ {c, a, p} determines the approach used for filtering.
• c specifies the causal filtered number of cases,
• a is the acausal filtered number of cases, and
• p is the projected and acausal filtered number of cases,
see also Figure 2. Note, since the true number of cases (N ) is not known (compare Figure 1), the estimators have to
work with the nowcasted number of cases N̂ .
From Equation (3), we see that the reproduction number is a quotient of case numbers. We compare three different
filters of computing the number of cases.

is the causal moving average of the estimated number of cases N̂ (t) at time t over the last ` days. This method is used
by [11]. Although this approach accounts for periodicities, it introduces unnecessary lag to the estimator (shown later).
A possible remedy is to employ an acausal filter, which uses not just the past and present but also future values for the
number of cases. The acausal filtered N̂ (t)2 is

This is a symmetric filter; the day of interest is “in the center” of the filter.
The previous approach takes the future values for granted. Consequently, this approach is only suitable for a retrospective
analysis of R(t). This method is used by [11]. To calculate the daily-based instantaneous reproduction number R(t) it
remains to answer how to obtain future values. Therefore, we propose to project values from the past into the future.

Having introduced three different filters for the number of cases, there follow three different estimators for the
instantaneous reproduction number R(t)3 .
Remark (Notation). In the following, we use either the Equation (3) either with the nowcasted number of cases (N̂ ) or
the reported cases (C(t)). To facilitate distinction later on we use the superscripts N or C in combination with R(t).
Also, we use N ∗ to denote the most current and consequently most inaccurate nowcasting method.

4 Creating Synthetic Datasets based on COVID-19 Data in Germany
What are meaningful ways to compare the three estimators from the previous Section 3? Clearly, applying them to
real-world data is favorable. However, real-world data comes with real-world fuzziness. Hence, we suggest a method to
generate synthetic data. Such approaches are popular in machine learning if the dataset is not good enough, e.g. Street
and Kim created a synthetic dataset for getting a ground truth for concept drift detection [16].
For our purposes, the synthetic dataset needs to satisfy three requirements.
1. The ground truth shall be unambiguous. Hence, we create our dataset based on the given values of R(t).
2. The dataset shall contain realistic periodicities. Hence, we apply delay structures to the created cases that we
extract from the publicly available COVID-19 data for Germany.
3. The dataset shall be realistic and it shall follow a curve similar to the reported cases.
The following algorithm generates a synthetic dataset fulfilling the above requirements; it is based on Equation (1). As
input, the algorithm needs a smooth time-series of the reproduction number, the number of cases for the initial week,
and a delay pattern. Based on this input, the algorithm performs the following two steps.
1. Based on previous values, generate new cases by rearranging Equation (1)
N (t) = R(t)

`−1
X

N (t − i) · wi ,

(7)

i=0

where N (t) is the number of new cases at time t, wi weights how much infections are caused by cases at time
t − i, and R(t) is the reproduction number at time t.

For notational simplicity we assume that ` is odd.

2. Afterward, apply a delay pattern to N (t) to obtain the cases with periodicities
C(t) =

d
X

N (t − i) · pweekday(t - i),i .

(8)

i=0

where pweekday(t - i),i is the share of days with a delay of i at the weekday of time t + i, t is the time in days, and
d is the longest considered delay. Note that C(t) is simplified since we do not consider further influences like
testing rates, probabilities of false-negative (or false-positive) test results.
As mentioned above, the data generation needs a delay structure as input. Instead of using a one-day, two-day, or
weekend delay structure as in [3], we extract them from real COVID-19 data since we assume that real-world delay
structures ones are more complex. Therefore, a dataset containing the date of illness and the date of the report for cases
is necessary. Given such data, the following steps extract a delay structure4 .
1. For each combination of date of illness and record, calculate the difference between both.
2. For each date of illness, extract the weekday—we assume a weekly periodicity.
3. Group the data by the weekday and the delay. Afterwards, calculate the sum for each group. This sum is the
absolute number of cases that fall ill on the particular weekday with a specific delay.
4. For each sum, divide it by the number of people who fall ill on the specific weekday. The result is the share of
the cases for the particular weekday that is reported with the corresponding delay.
In the following, we describe the relevant parameters used for creating a dataset. As R(t) we choose a smoothed step
sequence with 300 days. The three steps are one drop from 3.2 to 0.9 in step 30 and two increases from 0.9 to 0.95 at
step 100 and from 0.95 to 1.0 at step 200. This step sequence is smoothed by
R(t) = α · R(t − 1) + (1 − α) · Ru (t)

(9)

where α is a smoothing factor, t is the time, and Ru (t) is the un-smoothed reproduction number.
The data generation also requires a delay structure. We extract it from the data provided by RKI5 . This dataset contains
cases of all German counties from January 28 until May 21. The following preprocessing steps are required6 .
• Aggregate the data spatially for getting all cases of Germany for the specific date of illness and date of the
report.
• Filter the data according to the following rules.
– Consider only values for which the date of illness is reported.
– Consider only values for which the date of illness is before the date of report.
– Consider only values for which the difference between report date and date of illness is smaller than two
weeks. The average delay in the complete dataset is 6.78 days. The average delay in the dataset with a
maximum delay of two weeks is 5.48.
Figure 3 shows the resulting delay structure. Note that the sum for each weekday is one and that 10.16 % of the reported
cases have a delay greater than two weeks. We observe that each weekday has a weekly delay structure. Moreover,
the delay structure is different for each weekday. A probable explanation is the weekend’s strong influence on the
periodicities. Also, the plot indicates that most cases are delayed for three or four days.
Finally, the last input needed by the data generation is the number of cases in the initial six days. For this parameter, we
chose [1,2,2,3,3,4]. With these parameters we generate the synthetic dataset; it is shown in Figure 4. The analysis with
a cross-correlation indicates that the curve of C(t) is delayed by ten days. Note that the delay between the peaks in
the nowcasted numbers and the daily reports of the RKI is twelve days. The difference can be explained by additional
delays that can arise from the forwarding of data by local health authorities to the central institution in Germany, the
Robert Koch Institut (RKI).

Evaluation and Discussion – Synthetic data

In this subsection, we evaluate the estimators on the synthetic data generated in Section 5. Therefore, we test both
proposed acausal estimators on the number of N (t) and the number of reported cases C(t), see Figure 1. The benchmark
estimators are the ones from the RKI with filter lengths ` of four and seven [11].
Accuracy of the R(t)-Estimators
We use the mean absolute error (MAE) to evaluate the accuracy of the three different estimators from Section 3

where R(t) is the reproduction number R̂(t) is the estimated reproduction number. The MAE is applied on the
estimation of R(t) for the whole dataset, as well as on a truncated dataset without the first 55 values. The truncated
dataset is used for evaluating the estimators without the starting phase, which dominates the MAE on the complete
dataset.
Table 1 provides the MAE of the estimators on the synthetic dataset. The left column gives the accuracy on the reported
data, the column in the middle on the reported data shifted by ten days, and the right column on N (t). Note that the
delay of ten days is the delay between C(t) and N (t) measured by the cross-correlation.

C
is that R̂p,7 (t) and R̂c,7 (t) react slower than the other estimators. Consequently, the shift reduces the delay, and the
accuracy improves.

(t), followed by R̂c,4
(t). In
N
N
N
contrast to the result on C(t) , R̂c,4 (t) is better than R̂c,7 (t) and R̂p,` (t) . The reason, therefore, is that N (t) does not
have weekly periodicities, which can harm accuracy. Consequently, the filter size does not influence the accuracy.

MAE

Moving Average of MAE
For a more detailed examination of the accuracy, we evaluate the curves of the moving average of the MAE with a
C
(t) in
window of 14 days. Therefore, Figure 5 provides the complete curves as well as two cutouts. Note, we omit R̂c,4
the cutouts due to the high error. We make four observations.
C
N
1. In Figure 5a, we observe that R̂c,4
(t) has a high error. In contrast, R̂c,4
(t) has a small error. The reason,
C
N
therefore, is that R̂c,4 (t) and R̂c,4 (t) are prone to suffering from periodicities. However, N (t) has no
C
periodicities in contrast to C(t) . Consequently, only R̂c,4
(t) has a high error.
C
2. In Figure 5c, R(t) is stable, and so is the MAE of all estimators. However, the level of error differs. R̂a,7
(t)
C
C
and R̂c,7
(t) have higher error values than the R̂p,7
(t). The estimators that bases on N (t) achieve the smallest.

3. During periods where R(t) changes (Figure 5b), all estimators have peaks in their moving MAE. The smallest
N
error is achieved again by the estimators, which base on N (t). R̂a,7
(t) has the lowest peak, followed by
N
N
N
R̂c,7 (t) , R̂p,7 (t) , and R̂c,4 (t) .
C
C
For the estimators on C(t) , R̂a,7
(t) has the smallest peak. This observation indicates that R̂a,7
(t) reacts faster
C
C
than R̂c,7
(t) and R̂p,7
(t).
4. Moreover, the MAE of all estimators based on C(t) is smaller after the change. This is caused by the
fluctuations, which we analyze in the next part.
Influence of Periodicities
Figure 6 shows the complete R(t) curves of the different estimators (Figure 6a) as well as two cutouts showing a rising
flank of R(t) (Figure 6b) and a stable period (Figure 6c). We make five observations.

the MAE at a rising flank of R(t).

(c) This cutout shows the MAE of the estimators during a stable
period of the R(t).

Figure 5: The moving average of the mean absolute error (MAE) of the different tested estimators is given. The window
C
size for the moving average is 14. Note for both cutouts, we remove R̂c,4
(t) since its error is high, compared to the
other estimators.

C
1. R̂c,4
(t) fluctuates stronger than the other estimators. The reason for this behavior is that this estimator works
C
on data with weekly periodicities and that its filter size is not a multiple of one week. Thus, R̂c,4
(t) is not able
C
to cope with the periodicities. Consequently, for making the cutouts clearer, we omit R̂c,4 (t) there.

2. Estimators that works on C(t) show different behavior than estimators on N (t). At the beginning of Figure 6
as well as during the complete cutouts (Figures 6b and 6c), we observe that the estimators that work on N (t)
have fewer fluctuations than the estimators on C(t). The reason, therefore, is that N (t) does not have weekly
periodicities. Accordingly, the corresponding estimators also have no fluctuations.
3. In Figure 6b, we observe that the estimators differ in their speed of capturing changes. Estimators based on
N
acausal filtering adapt faster than estimators based on causal filtering. R̂a,7
(t) is even faster than the ground
truth. The reason, therefore, is that acausal filter-based estimators consider future values.
4. In Figure 6b, we see that the fluctuations of estimators, which work on C(t) are smaller if the R(t) is nearer to
one. This observation explains that if R(t) is one, the average number of new cases is constant. Consequently,
if R(t) is one, variations of C(t) are only caused by weekly periodicities. On the other hand, an increasing
distance of R(t) to one leads to a larger gap between the weekly minimum and weekly maximum of C(t).
Thus, the estimated reproduction numbers fluctuate more if R(t) is further away from 1. This behavior also
explains the remaining fluctuations, e.g., in Figure 6c.
5. The last observation is about the difference in the fluctuations of the estimators based on C(t). The amplitudes
C
C
of the fluctuation of R̂c,7
(t) and R̂a,7
(t) are the same. However, they differ in their phase. The cause of this

behavior is the usage of causal and acausal filtering and the resulting shift. Moreover, we observe that R̂p,7

Use-case – COVID-19 Germany

In this section, we evaluate the performance of the estimators from Section 3 on a real dataset.
Dataset for Germany We use a daily updated dataset provided by the RKI7 for our use case. In the
following, we use the version from the June 19, 2020. The first entry in the dataset pertains March 02, 2020; the last
entry pertains June 18, 2020. This dataset contains different phases, e.g., an exponential increase of the number of cases
(R(t) > 1) and a phase where R(t) fluctuates around one.
COVID -19

Retrospective evaluation Our first evaluation is on the retrospective evaluation of the course of COVID-19 in Germany.
The tested methods and benchmarks are the same as in Section 5. Figure 7 shows the resulting curves of the estimated
N
R(t). Note that the RKI has been using R̂c,4
(t) in its public communication since April 3, 2020. Since May 10, a new
N
estimator was used in parallel based on R̂c,7
(t), see [11]. We make four observations.

1. The R̂(t) of all estimators decreases until the end of March 2020. Afterward, a period follows with estimates
fluctuating around a stable constant follows. This is caused by the interventions against COVID-19 in Germany.
N
2. R̂c,4

the beginning of June. Probably the reason is an accumulation of public holidays around the end of May and
the beginning of June.

(t) react faster to changes than the other estimators. We discussed this behavior already in the

4. The last observation is that the estimators based on the reported data show higher fluctuations than the
estimators on the nowcasted data. This observation is explainable by the nowcasting, which probably reduces
the fluctuations, which are caused by the delay patterns.

Evaluation of the Fluctuations In the second evaluation, we investigate the fluctuations by comparing weekly

We make four observations.
N
1. We observe that the distance between minima and maxima R̂c,4
(t) is larger compared to other estimators.
N
Additionally, for R̂c,4 (t), we see that the minima occur mostly on Sundays or Mondays. Such an accumulation
is not observable for the other estimators. Probably, the higher fluctuations and the accumulation of the minima
are caused by filtering over four days instead of filtering over a multiple of one week.
N
(t) is before the peak in the other estimators. A possible

4. R̂p,7
(t) has a similar behavior as R̂a,7

C
reason is that R̂p,7 (t) works on the C(t) data. Consequently, we can say that a retrospective acausal filtering
on C(t) has a similar performance than causal and acausal filter-based R(t) estimators on nowcasted data.
C
This observation indicates that R̂p,7
(t) is an accurate R(t) estimator for the daily-based analysis.

Conclusion

We show that delays in reporting lead to fluctuations in R(t)-estimators. To overcoming this issue we propose to use
filters with the length of one week. Moreover, we suggest to use acausal filtering instead of causal filtering, because

Delay-robust Estimation of the Reproduction Number

A P REPRINT

this prevents the estimators from lagging behind the true reproduction number R(t). Acausal filters need future values.
Hence, we project the values from the past into the future. Our results show that acausal filtering improves the overall
accuracy and reduces fluctuations. Moreover, if the reproduction number R(t) is close to one, then the proposed
approach is more robust and accurate than the benchmarks.
Another contribution of the present paper is to propose a methodology for synthetic data creation. It is undertaken on
the basis of COVID-19 outbreak in Germany. The dataset contains all relevant real-world facets.
Future work will focus on improving synthetic data generation. For example, the data generation should consider
under-reported cases (as in [3]), and herd immunity. Moreover, delays and the number of under-reported cases may
change over time—aspects the data generation should consider. The longer COVID-19 continues to rage, the more
societal aspects need to incorporated, e.g. public holidays and school vacation.
Also, with the diffusion ad smearing of COVID-19 across countries, the interpretability and relevance of a single
reproduction number shrinks. Can local reproduction numbers (for counties or states) be devised, and how do they
contribute to an improved global reproduction number?
