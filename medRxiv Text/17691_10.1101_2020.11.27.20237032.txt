ABSTRACT

A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of
COVID-19 and continues to be a global health challenge. To understand viral disease biology, we
have carried out proteo-genomic analysis using next generation sequencing (NGS) and massspectrometry on nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients to examine clinical genome and
proteome. Our study confirms the hyper mutability of SARS-CoV-2 showing multiple SNPs. NGS
analysis detected 27 mutations of which 14 are synonymous, 11 are missense and 2 are extragenic
in nature. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates indicated their close relation to
Bangladesh isolate and multiple origins of isolates within a country. Our proteomic analysis, for
the first time identified 13 different SARS-CoV-2 proteins from the clinical swabs. Of the total 41
peptides captured by HRMS, 8 matched to nucleocapsid protein, 2 to ORF9b, 1 to spike
glycoprotein and ORF3a, with remaining mapping to ORF1ab polyprotein. Additionally, host
proteome analysis revealed several key host proteins to be uniquely expressed in COVID-19
patients. Pathway analysis of these proteins points towards modulation in immune response,
especially involving neutrophil and IL-12 mediated signaling. Besides revealing the aspects of
host-virus pathogenesis, our study opens new avenues to develop better diagnostic markers and
therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the latest addition to the extensive list of infectious
diseases caused by viruses that have jumped from animals to humans. The global outbreak of
COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated
from the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. After SARS-CoV in 2003 1,2 and Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012,

3

SARS-CoV-2 is the third of

coronavirus family to cross the species barrier and infect humans with severe respiratory disease.
It has proven to be more dangerous than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV due to its alarming
transmission rate through respiratory droplets, encountering infected persons or contaminated
surfaces.4

SARS-CoV-2 was first identified by meta-transcriptomic sequencing from the

bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a patient in China and the sequence was made available at Global
Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) platform on 12th January 2020.5 Phylogenetic
analysis shows that about 30 kb genome of this new RNA virus is most closely related to a group
of SARS-like coronavirus (humans and bat) with 89.1% similarity.5 SARS-CoV-2 has 14 open
reading frames (ORF), which codes for structural, accessory non-structural and replication
proteins. ORF1ab is the largest of all having 21,291 nucleotides and codes for replicase
polyprotein. Structure protein genes located downstream to ORF1ab, aligned in the following
order- spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) with ORFs that code for
accessory non-structural proteins are located in between. SARS-CoV-2 forms a capsid of lipid
bilayer with embedded E, M and S proteins.6 Till the time any drug or efficient vaccines are
developed, the biggest challenge in front of the scientific committee and health workers is to
contain the spread of the virus by testing, tracing and isolation of infected subjects until recovery.

Since the first SARS-CoV-2 sequence was made available, more than 140,000 complete genome
sequences have been added to the list by laboratories across the world. Despite a large number of
sequences being available, it is still not clear how fast the virus mutates and if the mutations impact
its virulence in the context of the growing pandemic. In addition, very little information is available
regarding the clinical proteome of the virus. Until recently, only a few proteins, mainly including
structural proteins N and S have been identified from clinical swabs. Besides, host proteome
studies from clinical samples are necessary to fill the void in understanding the host response to
viral infection.
In this study, genomic analysis of COVID-19 was performed by next generation sequencing
(NGS) on swab samples of Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive
individuals, collected from Bangalore, India. Variant analysis of these samples showed a high
mutation rate, with ≥11 mutations observed per sample. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences
with other variants from India as well as across the world revealed their close relation to one of
the Bangladesh isolates, which had showed European origin. SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny indicated
the prevalence of isolates showing multiple origins within a country. Overall, through genomic
analysis of SARS-CoV-2, our study highlighted increasing variations (SNPs) in the viral genome
and their role to understand its evolution and virulence.
In addition to sequencing the genome by NGS, our study also explored the COVID-19 clinical
proteome and host-protein responses by using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). We
performed HRMS on swab samples of both RT-PCR positive and negative patients. In total, we
identified 41 peptides matching to 13 different COVID-19 proteins, including proteins from
ORF1ab polyprotein, Spike glycoprotein, ORF3a, ORF9b and Nucleocapsid. Additionally, the
host proteomic analysis revealed significant differences between RT-PCR positive and RT-PCR

negative host proteomes. We found 441 proteins to be uniquely present in positive samples. Most
of these proteins are involved in neutrophil degranulation and activation pathways indicating host
immunological response to the virus. In conclusion, our analysis confirms the presence of COVID19 peptides in nasal swab samples and proteomic analysis also predicted host responses to viral
infection, including identification of the neutrophil response as a key host response against
COVID-19 infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample Collection
Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from the diagnosed patients as a part of routine
monitoring. Part of the samples after diagnosis were sent to the lab for research purpose. Samples
were classified into positive and negative based on the RT-PCR result targeting E and RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes of the virus. Samples were collected only after the
approved consent of the patients who were informed about the study. The study was conducted
after approval of the institutional human ethics committee, IISc (19-01092020).
RNA Library Preparation
Total RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs of three positive patients (RT-PCR test) was extracted
using Trizol based extraction. RNA samples were quantified using Qubit RNA Assay HS
(Invitrogen). RNA purity was checked using Nanodrop and integrity was assessed on TapeStation
using RNA HS ScreenTapes (Agilent). Qiagen SARS-CoV-2 Primer (Qiagen) was used to prepare
libraries from RNA extracted from COVID-19 positive subjects. Viral RNA was converted to
cDNA and used as a template for multiplex PCR with primers spanning the entire genome of the
virus. The amplicons were then pooled and purified before proceeding for library preparation.

During library preparations, the amplicons were subjected to a series of enzymatic steps that repair
the ends, tails the 3’ end with a single ‘A’ nucleotide, followed by ligation of the adapters. The
adapter-ligated products were then purified and enriched using a limited cycle PCR. The final
cDNA libraries were purified and checked for fragment size distribution on TapeStation using
D1000 DNA ScreenTapes (Agilent).
Next-generation sequencing of SARS-CoV-2
Prepared cDNA libraries were quantified using Qubit High Sensitivity Assay (Invitrogen).
Quantified libraries were pooled and diluted to final optimal loading concentrations for cluster
amplification on Illumina flow cell followed by sequencing on Illumina HiSeq X instrument to
generate 150 bp paired-end reads.
Mutation analysis
Initially, the quality of the reads was checked using FastQC v0.11.9.7 Further, the sequencing
adapters clipped at 5’ and 3’ end of reads were trimmed using Cutadapt v2.9.8 The adapter trimmed
pair-end reads were then aligned to the Wuhan reference genome (Accession No. NC_045512.2)
downloaded from NCBI.9 The fast and accurate read alignment was achieved by using BWA
v.0.7.12 aligner.10 The aligned reads were sorted, removed soft-clippings and then variant calling
was performed using GATK variant caller.11 The reported variants were then annotated to study
their effects in proteins and genes using SNPEff tool.12 The variant class, amino acid changes and
other relevant annotations were added to the variants.
Nucleotide Sequence Accession Number
The SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences have been submitted to NCBI under the accession
number PRJNA668889.

The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method and the
Tamura-Nei model.13 The tree with the highest log likelihood (-525441.09) was generated. The
initial tree for the heuristic search was obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and
BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Tamura-Nei model and
then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. The tree was drawn to scale, with
branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. The analysis involved 40
nucleotide sequences with a total of 29945 positions in the final dataset. Codon positions included
were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X.14
Sample preparation for Mass spectrometry
In-solution sample preparation was done to extract the peptides from the protein solution.
Briefly, samples collected in VTM were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. The
supernatant was collected in a separate microcentrifuge tube and the pellet was washed with 1x
PBS. Further, the pellet containing epithelial cells was lysed by 1x Triton buffer (chilled). Lysate
in the supernatant was collected after centrifuging at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. Both lysate
and supernatant were proceeded for protein precipitation by the addition of chilled acetone and
kept at -80°C for 2 hrs. Precipitated proteins were washed with chilled acetone and dissolved in
50mM ammonium bicarbonate. Proteins were reduced using 10mM DTT (Sigma-Aldrich) in
50mM ammonium bicarbonate at 56°C for 45 mins followed by alkylation with 55mM
iodoacetamide in 50mM ammonium bicarbonate at 37°C for 30 mins in the dark. In-solution
digestion was carried out by adding trypsin (Promega) 1µg/µl to a final protease to protein ratio of
1:50 (w/w) and incubated at 37˚C for 16 hours, with frequent shaking. Digestion was stopped using
formic acid and all the samples were subjected to vacuum dry.

Mass Spectrometry and Database Search
The dried trypsin digested peptides were reconstituted in a mixture of 20% ACN and 80% MQ
containing 0.01% formic acid. The protein digests were analyzed using Agilent 1290 Infinity II
LC system coupled with Agilent Advance Bio Q-TOF (6545XT). The column used for
chromatography was Agilent AdvanceBio Peptide Map (2.1x 150mm, 2.7µ). Mobile phase A was
MQ (0.1% formic acid) and mobile phase B was ACN (0.1% formic acid). The peptides were
separated by using a 90 min gradient flow at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The MS and MS/MS scan
were acquired in the positive mode and stored in centroid mode. The following MS data acquisition
parameters, Vcap was set at 3500V, drying gas flow rate and the temperature was set at 12 L/min
and 270 ̊C, respectively. Collision energy with a slope of 3.6V/100 Da and an offset of 4.8V was
used for fragmentation. The precursor ion data were captured in a mass range of 200-1800 m/z and
product ions data were acquired in the range 50-2900 m/z. Reference exclusion was given for
0.05min after 1 spectrum. The raw data were analyzed using MaxQuant software (v1.6.2.10) and
processed through the MS excel sheet. The database analysis was performed against SARS-CoV2 proteome and Homo sapiens proteome in the UniProt database (Proteome ID- UP000005640).
The following search parameters were used for the database analysis: Precursor mass tolerance:
10ppm, fragment mass tolerance: 40ppm with cysteine carbamidomethylation as a fixed
modification and methionine oxidation and protein N-term acetylation as variable modifications.
MS Data repository
Mass spectrometry proteomics data acquired on nasopharyngeal swabs have been deposited
to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE15 partner repository under dataset
identifiers PXD021896 and 10.6019/PXD021896.

Gene ontology and Pathway Analysis
All Uniprot IDs of host proteins found exclusively in COVID-19 positive samples were extracted
and analyzed through DAVID Tool for conversion to Entrez IDs. These Entrez IDs were then used
for the identification of Gene Ontology terms and pathways. Statistical significance of the genes
involved in positive samples was analyzed using the R package, clusterProfiler. To determine
whether any terms annotate a specified list of genes at a frequency greater than that would be
expected by chance, clusterProfiler calculates a p-value using the hypergeometric distribution.
Statistically enriched GO terms were then plotted and analyzed through dot plot, category net plot
(Cnetplot) and enrichment map (Emap).

Genome sequence reveals emerging mutations in SARS-CoV-2
Since the first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was shared on 12th Jan 2020, 5 there are more
than 133,000 genome sequences are available at GISAID to date.16 To correlate the sequence of
prevailing COVID-19 with those reported earlier, we carried out Illumina HiSeq X, NGS of SARSCoV-2. COVID-19 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs, tested positive by RT-PCR was converted
to cDNA and processed for NGS as described in the methods section. NGS analysis retrieved the
complete genome sequence from all three samples. FastQ files generated from NGS were reference
mapped to SARs-CoV-2 isolate, Wuhan-Hu-1 (Accession No. NC 045512.2) with 100% genome
coverage. The alignment of these 3 isolates with reference genome showed the prevalence of single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) (Figure1). Sample 1, 2 and 3 showed 11, 16 and 19 SNPs,
respectively. The number of mutations observed are higher than the average mutations per sample

of around 7 worldwide.17 A total of 27 variations were found in isolates out of which 4 are common
to all and 11 are exclusively common to samples 2 and 3. The 4 common mutations observed in
all three isolates are c.241C>T, c.3037C>T, c.14408 C>T and c.23403A>G. In total, we found 9
mutations belonging to the category of most frequent mutations out of which 6 (c.241C>T,
c.3037C>T, c.14408C>T, c.23403A>G, c.25563G>T and c.28881G>A) are common in all the
continents, c.26735C>T and c.28854C>T are specific to Asian isolates and c.18877C>T found in
both America and Asian isolates.
The amino acid substitutions due to these point mutations are represented in the lower panel of
Figure 1. Out of 27, 25 mutations are in the coding region, which generate 14 synonymous and 11
missense amino acid substitution. 3 of these 11 missense mutations could be of high impact as
they substitute charged to uncharged amino acid or vice-versa, hence, may impact the structure
and consequently the function of the proteins. These include- p.D614G in Spike glycoprotein,
p.Q57H in ORF3a and p.G204R in Nucleocapsid.
Further, to see the evolutionary relationship of these isolates we constructed a phylogenetic tree
using MEGA X software. Phylogenetic analysis showed that sample 2 and 3 are more closely
related and all three are in close relation to one of the Bangladesh isolates, which appears to be
originated from France isolates. Distinct clade-wise assignment revealed that all the isolates belong
to G derived clade (European origin), isolate 1 to GR and isolate 2 and 3 to GH.

Clinical proteome of SARS CoV-2
Despite an ample collection of genome information, the information on clinical proteome of
COVID-19 is ill explored. Only around 15 studies reported the proteome of SARS-CoV-2.18 We

obtained from 12 COVID-19 positive patients were analyzed using Agilent Advance Bio Q-TOF
(6545XT). Extracted proteins from swabs were reduced, alkylated and digested as described in the
methods section. From MS/MS spectra recorded at FDR ≤1% we were able to identify 41 unique
peptides matching to 13 different viral proteins. The maximum number of peptides were attributed
to ORF1ab polyprotein. As showed in peptide-map in Figure 3, we detected 8 peptides matching
to Nucleocapsid protein, 7 peptides to NSP3, 6 peptides to exoribonuclease, 4 peptides to 2'-Omethyltransferase, 3 peptides each to RdRp (NSP12) and endoribonuclease, 2 peptides each
to NSP2, Helicase and protein 9b and 1 peptide each to NSP8, NSP10, Spike glycoprotein and
protein 3a. Peptide ITEHSWNADLYK (2’O Methyltransferase) was detected in 50% of the
sample (6/12) and peptide IVQMLSDTLK (exoribonuclease) detected with the highest intensity.
Sample 12 showed the maximum number of identified peptides (8 attributed to 6 different
proteins). Apart from sample 1,3,10 and 11, peptides for 2'-O-methyltransferase protein are
detected in all the sample (66.6%). Our MS result showed a correlation with the result of RTPCR for positive samples. Our result suggests the potential of mass spectrometry for highly
sensitive and reliable diagnosis.

Host responses to SARS CoV-2 infection
We also looked for host protein dynamics upon SARS-CoV-2 infection by searching the MS
data against the human proteome database (Proteome ID- UP000005640). For this, we analyzed 9
samples of both COVID-19 positive and negative patients. Negative being those which tested
negative by RT-PCR and which did not show any COVID-19 peptides. To characterize the
pathways that are getting modulated by the viral infection, we compared the list of host proteins
identified by LC-MS/MS in all positive and negative samples. Figure 4A represents the Venn

diagram of host proteins. We identified 441 proteins to be uniquely present in positive sample, 246
exclusively in negative sample and 158 found common to both.
We classified unique proteins from the proteome of positive samples to their GO terms and
pathways to characterize host protein dynamics upon viral infection. The statistical significance of
GO was further analyzed using the R package, clusterProfiler. In total, proteins unique to positive
samples were classified into 244 GO terms. Figure 3B showing a dot plot for the top 30 GO terms
according to their statistical significance. We found neutrophil mediated immune responses
including degranulation and activation of neutrophil to be higher in positive samples (35 gene
count). The abundance of proteins involved in these pathways found to be enriched in positive
samples. Additionally, we observed a large collection of proteins involved in the cellular response
to oxidative stress and toxic substance and in metabolic pathways, for instancenucleoside/ribonucleoside triphosphate metabolic process, NAD and NADH metabolic process,
amino acid metabolism and glycolytic process. Apart from these, we also observed increased
number of proteins involved in RNA processing mechanism including- regulation of RNA/mRNA
stability, splicing and localization to Cajal bodies. Among host immune responses, proteins
involved in interleukin 12 and 7 mediated signaling pathways were also identified in the positive
samples. Figure 3D showing enriched map plot for the pathways identified for unique proteins
present in positive samples. Our results indicate that viral infection modulates host in all aspectsbiologically, molecularly and cellularly for its survival.

DISCUSSION
To strengthen the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 in terms of its origin, virulence and host-virus
pathogenesis we have analysed the virus genome, proteome as well as host protein response in
COVID-19 patients. Our genomic analysis based on these three samples from Bengaluru, which
is an urban city in the Southern part of India confirms a high rate of mutation in Indian isolates.
Earlier studies observed a low mutation rate of the virus, with an average of 7.23 mutations per
sample.17 This rate seems to vary between countries whilst India (8.40), Kazakhstan (9.47) and
Bangladesh (9.47) show high mutation rate per sample as compared to the world’s average. Whilst
India’s average mutation rate is estimated around 8.40, our all three isolates showed ≥11 mutations
per sample, with an average mutation rate of 15.33, which is significantly higher than those
reported previously. As previous studies were conducted during early phase of pandemic hence,
low mutation rate was observed. In total, we found 27 SNPs out of which 14 results in synonymous
mutation, 11 missense mutation and 2 are extragenic in nature, observed in the 5’UTR region. 3
of these 11 missense mutations are charged to uncharged or vice-versa amino acid substitution
observed in N, S and Orf3a protein. Comparison of the predicted Centroid secondary structure of
wild type (WT) and variants (mutant) 5’UTR showing positional entropy of each base, showed
there is no change in entropy for 241C>T transition. But entropy is significantly changed for
110C>T transition, not only for that particular base but also for the stem it belongs as compared to
WT. This transition may impact viral RNA processing and expression through altered binding of
predicted host RBPs- BRUNOL4, RBM38 and SRSF2.19 So far, the virus has maintained its
genome integrity by avoiding large scale indels and most of the mutations observed are in form of
SNPs (Figure 1). The silent mutations could cause a cumulative effect in the long term, in terms
of translational efficiency by changing codon usage. Missense mutations may or may not have a

direct effect on protein structure and function, but the emergence of new mutations with time may
modulate its virulence. Also, mutations in the extragenic region may impact RNA folding,
transcription and replication ability.20 Based on the marker mutations within the phylogenetic
cluster, GISAID introduced a nomenclature system for major clades. Distinct clade wise
assignment reveals that all the isolates belong to G derived clade (European origin), isolate 1 to
GR and isolate 2 and 3 to GH specifically, highlighting the current prevalence of G originated
clades. Though there are 6 major clades currently, more clades can be classified in future with
emerging and settling mutations.
To map the evolution and spread of SARS-CoV-2, a global whole-genome phylogenetic tree
was created. We observed no direct correlation between isolates and geographic regions though
some isolates showed close relations with other isolates of the same country or neighboring
countries. For instance, isolates from India mapping close to neighboring countries like
Bangladesh, Nepal and China (Hong Kong), stating exchange of virus between neighboring
countries. Few of China isolates were found close to Wuhan reference sequence in phylogenetic
tree but most of the isolates showed a mosaic pattern of distribution (Figure 2).
Our HRMS data revealed important facets of COVID-19 disease biology. Previous studies also
explored this area using viral cell lines, nasopharyngeal swabs and also gargle solution.21-23 So far
from the clinical swabs, only a few proteins have been identified. Reported studies mainly
identified structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we analyzed 12 RT-PCR positive
nasopharyngeal swabs for the presence of COVID-19 peptides. In our sample size we found 41
peptides matching to 13 different SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Most of the peptides matched to
Nucleocapsid protein and NSP3. 29 peptides matched to ORF1ab polyprotein, 2 to protein 9b, 1
to protein 3a and 9 to structural proteins S (2) and N (11). Detection of ORF9b with two peptides

function of ORF9b in suppressing Type I and III interferons,

no evidence of its expression

was reported so far. This is the first time we are identifying ORF9b in clinical samples which can
further be explored to explain the severity of clinical cases and varying susceptibility of
individuals. We observed that number of peptides identified did not always correlate with Ct values
in the RT-PCR test. ORF10 protein still remains elusive though data showed its role in
ubiquitination; its expression in clinical swabs is still a question mark.
In comparison to RNA, proteins are more stable and better candidates for diagnosis. Proteins
can be better reflective of virus load and disease. A greater number of peptides identified in sample
may indicate greater viral load and proliferation, with samples showing maximum peptides could
reflect severity of the disease. Through global proteomics, we identified temporal changes in host
proteome upon viral infection. In our sample size, we identified 441 proteins exclusively in
positive samples. Pathway analysis of these proteins reveals alteration in basic host processes and
heightened immune response (Figure 4), as also reported previously, which showed that host cells
try to combat viral load by alleviating immune response especially, mediated by macrophage,
complement and IL-6 signaling.26,27 Here we observed enrichment of neutrophil-mediated immune
responses which are known to play a crucial role in airway infections and elicit antiviral response.28
Not many studies are there who commented on the role of neutrophils in COVID-19 and more or
less their role is not very clear. Though they are important for effective immune response, they can
also be cytotoxic and lead to hyperinflammation through degranulation and lysis during severe
pneumonia.28-30 With increasing studies showing upregulated neutrophil genes and neutrophilattracting chemokines in SARS-CoV-2, current literature also showed their role in damaging host
inflammatory responses through involvement of NETs and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte

ratio observed in severe cases, indicating their association to COVID-19 pathology.31-33 Hence,
further studies would be useful in dissecting their role and to understand the mechanism involved
in severe cases.
We also observed more proteins involved in the cellular response to IL-12 and IL-7, which has
a role in adaptive immune system mainly T-cell mediated immune response. As expected, we
observed a heightened response to oxidative stress. An additional cluster of proteins identified in
clinical swabs mainly enriched in RNA processing (splicing, spliceosomal components), mRNA
stability, localization to Cajal body and RNA metabolism. This result relates to previous studies
which also suggested splicing as a crucial pathway for SARS-CoV-2 survival.21,34 Pathways
involved in metabolism, for instance- Carbon metabolism, RNA/DNA synthesis, NAD/NADH
synthesis, unsaturated fatty acid metabolism also among the enriched pathways observed in
positive samples. Unsaturated fatty acid are components of phospholipids and involves in
maintenance of membrane fluidity. Phospholipids along with sphingolipids mediate signal
transduction and immune responses. Earlier studies reported phagocytosis and platelet
degranulation mediated alteration in production of glycerophospholipid, and reduction of
glycerophospholipid upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.35,26 Overall, through our study we suggest a
complete alteration of host processes affecting cellular, metabolic or biological functions.
Furthermore, our global proteomics unravels cellular and molecular pathways for therapeutic
interventions. Essentially, our result suggests that proteomics can not only offer timely and
sensitive diagnosis but also has the ability to reveal prognosis and severity of viral infection.
Altogether our study combining genomics and proteomics revealed genome-wide SNPs,
COVID-19 proteome and dynamics of host proteome in clinical samples. In combination with
etiological and patient severity details, multiomics studies cannot only predict the progression of

SARS-CoV-2 but will also help in identifying drug targets to offer counter treatment for this as
well as for future pandemics.

CONCLUSION
In this proteo-genomic study of SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed the clinical proteome of COVID-19
and the variations accumulated in the genome since its identification. The clinical landscape of
SARS-CoV-2 and host proteome highlighted correlation between the viral proteins and host
responses (Figure 5). Through our proteomics study, we confirmed expression of various (13 in
this study) viral proteins in the host cell. Pathway analysis of host proteome indicated enrichment
of proteins majorly involved in immune response, metabolism and RNA processing. We identified
several COVID-19 peptides within a 90 min MS-acquisition window, few of which are unique to
SARS-CoV-2 and not present in other coronaviruses, confirming SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our
study suggests the importance of SARS-CoV-2 specific peptide LVDPQIQLAVTR (Orf9b) and
IFTIGTVTLKQGEIK (Orf3a) in its accurate detection. Though more studies can further deepen
the understanding of viral biopathology, this study offers both proteo-genomic analysis of SARSCoV-2 confirming high rate of mutation in Indian isolates and expression of viral protein (Orf9b)
in the host cell, which suppresses the host innate immune response. Enrichment of proteins
involved in neutrophils mediated immune response pointed towards the crosstalk between host
and pathogen. Our study highlighted the potential of mass-spectrometry as a specific and sensitive
diagnostic tool and laid down the foundation for future studies. Further studies combined with
patient severity details can help in predicting the prognosis of viral infection.

Figure 5. Schematic representation of clinical proteome of COVID-19 patient.
The figure depicts COVID-19 and host-epithelial cell proteomes identified in this study. Upon
vesicular internalization, the coronavirus RNA undergoes a series of replication and translates into
viral proteins. Viral proteins are indicated in red text while host proteins identified in positive
samples are shown in black. Viral structural proteins like spike glycoprotein undergoes folding
and trafficking through ER. The nucleocapsid form (genome and N) individually assembled in the
cytoplasm further joins structural proteins in ER-Golgi intermediate compartment forming a
complete virion particle. The assembled virion particles exit the infected cell by exocytosis and
continue to transmit.
