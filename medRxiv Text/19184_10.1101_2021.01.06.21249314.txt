Abstract

23

Rapid antigen-detecting tests (Ag-RDTs) can complement molecular diagnostics for

24

COVID-19. The recommended temperature for storage of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs ranges

25

between 5-30°C. In many countries that would benefit from SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs, mean

26

temperatures exceed 30°C. We assessed analytical sensitivity and specificity of eleven

27

commercially available SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using different storage and operational

28

temperatures, including (i) long-term storage and testing at recommended conditions, (ii)

29

recommended storage conditions followed by 10 minutes exposure to 37°C and testing at

30

37°C and (iii) 3 weeks storage followed by testing at 37°C. The limits of detection of SARS-

31

CoV-2 Ag-RDTs under recommended conditions ranged from 8.2x10 5-7.9x107 genome

32

copies/ml of infectious SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatant. Despite long-term storage

33

at recommended conditions, 10 minutes pre-incubation of Ag-RDTs and testing at 37°C

34

resulted in about ten-fold reduced sensitivity for 46% of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs, including

35

both Ag-RDTs currently listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization. After

36

3 weeks of storage at 37°C, 73% of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs exhibited about ten-fold

37

reduced sensitivity. Specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using cell culture-derived human

38

coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 was not affected by storage and testing at

39

37°C. In summary, short- and long-term exposure to elevated temperatures likely impairs

40

sensitivity of several SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs that may translate to false-negative test

41

results at clinically relevant virus concentrations compatible with inter-individual

42

transmission. Ensuring appropriate transport and storage conditions, and development of

43

tests that are more robust across temperature fluctuations will be important for accurate

44

use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs in tropical settings.

Introduction

46

Advantages of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) include

47

fast results and their applicability on site without dependence on laboratory settings. Ag-

48

RDTs are not intended to replace real-time RT-PCR as the gold standard for SARS-CoV-

49

2 diagnostics (1, 2), but can be deployed for surveillance in high-risk environments or

50

areas with insufficient laboratory capacity. With a constantly growing number of

51

commercially available Ag-RDTs on the global market, the number of studies validating

52

Ag-RDTs from different manufacturers is increasing rapidly (3-9). Those validation studies

53

have so far not focused on the performance of Ag-RDTs under conditions that differ from

54

recommended storage and test execution conditions (5-30°C), such as those observed in

55

tropical settings where ambient temperatures commonly exceed 30°C (Figure 1A). This

56

is challenging because tropical regions are strongly affected by the SARS-CoV-2

57

pandemic as evident from total cases reported from India, Brazil, Argentina, and

58

Colombia, four out of the ten most affected countries worldwide by November 2020

59

(Figure 1B).

60

Several studies have shown the need for validation of diagnostic tools in resource-limited

61

tropical regions because co-endemic diseases can affect diagnostic test performance (10-

62

14). The same might also apply to the environmental conditions under which Ag-RDTs

63

are transported, stored and used. Temperature tolerance of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tools

64

or environmental stability requirements have been previously discussed as hurdles and

65

corresponding guidelines for stability testing of in vitro diagnostics are provided by the

66

World Health Organization (WHO) (15, 16). To date, knowledge about temperature

67

stability of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs is scarce.

To validate the performance of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT in tropical settings, we compared

69

analytical sensitivity and specificity of eleven SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using recommended

70

and elevated temperatures.

Materials and Methods

73

Storage and testing of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs at 37°C

74

For storage at recommended conditions, the tests were stored at ambient temperature

75

and were monitored that the room temperature stayed between 15-25°C. For storage at

76

37°C, SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs were removed from cartons for space reasons and stored

77

in plastic bags in a 37°C incubator for 19-21 days for sensitivity and 8-9 days for specificity

78

testing. All tests were kept in their individual foil packaging until use. For experiments with

79

infectious SARS-CoV-2, Ag-RDTs were transferred to a BSL-3 laboratory and stored in a

80

37°C incubator until test application. For specificity testing with infectious human

81

coronavirus (HCoV)-229E and HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs were transferred to

82

a BSL-2 laboratory and stored in a 37°C incubator until test validation. For experiments

83

testing short-term exposure to 37°C following storage at recommended temperatures,

84

SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs were transferred to a BSL-3 laboratory and stored for 10 minutes

85

in a 37°C incubator until test operation. After application of SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E or

86

HCoV-OC43 cell culture supernatant in a biological safety cabinet, Ag-RDTs were further

87

incubated in a 37°C incubator until readout of the results.

Analytical sensitivity

91

SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/Munich/ChVir984/2020) was grown on Vero E6 cells (C1008;

92

African green monkey kidney cells) and maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS at

93

37°C with 5% CO2. Viral RNA was extracted from cell culture supernatant using the

94

QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's

95

instructions. RNA concentration was determined by specific real-time RT-PCR and in

96

vitro-transcribed RNA standards designed for absolute quantification of virus

97

concentrations (17, 18).

98

For determination of the limit of detection (LOD), a SARS-CoV-2 stock (3.1x109 copies/ml)

99

was serially diluted in plain DMEM and 5µl/dilution were added to the extraction buffer of

100

the respective kit for validation experiments. For the Coris COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip test,

101

5µl of SARS-CoV-2 supernatant was added to 95µl of PBS to reach the required sample

102

volume of 100µl prior to addition of LY-S buffer to the sample for test validation. Initially,

103

validation experiments were performed in triplicates for a small subset of tests

104

(ActivXpress, Genedia, ichroma, JOYSBIO) at recommended conditions (i) with all three

105

replicates showing the same result (Supplementary Table 1). Consequently, validation

106

experiments for all included tests were subsequently performed in duplicates due to a

107

limited amount of available tests for all conditions tested. LOD was defined as the lowest

108

dilution at which both replicates were positive. A dilution factor correction was applied

109

based on the volume of extraction buffer (range between kits, 100-500µl) provided by

110

each SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT kit.

113

Analytical specificity

114

Specificity was tested using cell culture supernatant of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43,

115

grown on CaCo-2 cells. Quantification of viral stocks was performed by RT-PCR using an

116

in house protocol and photometrically quantified in vitro-transcribed RNA standards as

117

described above. 5µl of stocks were directly used for validation experiments. The required

118

sample volume of 100µl for the Coris COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip was reached as described

119

above. Experiments were performed in duplicates.

120
121

Interpretation of test results

122

Tests were performed according to the test-specific supplier instructions for use, except

123

for the sample preparation as noted above. Results in the form of a band on

124

immunochromatography paper were scored independently by two persons except for the

125

reader-based tests Bioeasy 2019-nCoV Ag and ichroma - COVID-19 Ag. In case of

126

discrepancy for visual tests, a third person was consulted to reach a final decision. Results

127

were defined as unclear when a weak, discontinuous band or smear was observed that

128

could not be clearly defined as a positive or negative result. In case of test failure indicated

129

by absence of a visible positive control band, the test procedure was repeated with the

130

same sample.

138

Results

139

At present, there are at least 119 SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs commercially available (21).

140

Eleven of those SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests were selected for temperature stability

141

validation based on the availability of clinical performance data (3), and manufacturing by

142

leading suppliers implying availability on the global market (Table 1). Subsequently,

143

analytical performance of selected SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs was assessed following

144

storage and application of tests under recommended conditions as well as elevated

145

temperatures (termed tropical conditions henceforth), using three different experimental

146

settings.

The first setting was (i) storage at recommended conditions (room temperature (rt); 15-

152

30°C) for 1-6 months and test incubation at recommended conditions (rt; 15-30°C). The

153

second setting was (ii) storage at recommended conditions (rt; 15-30°C) for 1-6 months,

154

10 minutes pre-incubation of tests at 37°C prior to testing and test incubation at 37°C so

155

as to mimic recommended storage of kits prior to test usage under non air-conditioned

156

conditions in tropical settings. The third setting was (iii) storage under tropical conditions

157

(37°C) for 19-21 days followed by test incubation at 37°C to mimic non air-conditioned

158

storage and test application in tropical settings (Figure 2).

159

First, we determined analytical sensitivity at recommended conditions by determining the

160

limit of detection (LOD) of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs at room temperature using serial

dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatant (dilution range: 7.2x106 copies/ml to

162

3.1x109 copies/ml; Table 2) following storage for 1-6 months at room temperature. Prior

163

to performing all experiments in duplicates we validated analytical sensitivity for a small

164

subset of tests at recommended conditions in triplicates, showing that results for

165

duplicates and triplicates were identical (Supplementary Table 1). As extraction buffer

166

volumes differ between manufacturers and a constant volume of SARS-CoV-2

167

supernatant was applied for validation experiments, the limit of detection (LOD) for each

168

Ag-RDT was calculated by correcting for the respective dilution factor. The dilution-factor

169

corrected limit of detection (LOD) for validated SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs ranged from

170

8.2x105 copies/ml to 7.9x107 copies/ml of SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatant (Table 2).

171

Those LODs were consistent with previously published virus concentrations for validation

172

of Ag-RDTs using clinical samples (3), suggesting robustness of our data. Our data also

173

highlight profound differences in analytical sensitivity of up to 100-fold for SARS-CoV-2

174

Ag-RDTs from different manufacturers.

We then assessed analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs following short- and

long-term exposure to 37°C (settings (ii) and (iii); Figure 2) by determining the level of

190

detection (LOD) using identical serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatant.

191

The analytical sensitivity of about half of the evaluated SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs (five out of

192

eleven; 46%) was already compromised by about ten-fold when tests were stored under

193

recommended conditions but exposed to 37°C for only ten minutes prior to testing at 37°C

194

(Figure 3). After 19-21 days storage at 37°C and testing at 37°C, eight out of the eleven

195

SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs (73%) showed an about ten-fold reduction in analytical sensitivity

196

when compared to recommended temperatures.

Additionally, analytical specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs under recommended and

198

under tropical storage and test application conditions ((i) and (iii); Figure 2) was examined

199

by testing for cross-reactivity with the ubiquitous HCoV-229E (2.9x107 copies/ml) and

200

HCoV-OC43 (1.0x106 copies/ml) (22, 23). Those HCoV concentrations were selected

201

according to the guidelines on analytical specificity testing for SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs

202

published by the German Federal institute for vaccines and biomedicines (24). SARS-

203

CoV-2 Ag-RDTs showed no cross-reactivity with HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43 upon

storage and testing at elevated temperatures (Table 3).

Discussion

216

Our study highlights that even short-term exposure to elevated temperatures may

217

compromise sensitivity of currently available SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs.

218

Our data are consistent with impaired sensitivity of other Ag-RDTs at elevated

219

temperatures, including Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (MRDTs). An assessment of five

220

MRDTs reported a 13% to 53% decline in sensitivity for three MRDTs following 90 days

221

of storage at 35°C (25). Moreover, an evaluation assessing temperature stability of

222

dengue NS1 antigen-based RDTs at 35°C showed a gradual decline in test sensitivity for

223

seven out of eight tested dengue Ag-RTDs after storage for about 20 days at elevated

224

temperatures (26). Beyond storage, elevated temperatures during shipment can also

225

affect Ag-RDT performance. Supply chains of MRDTs were studied in Burkina Faso,

226

Senegal, Ethiopia, the Philippines and Cambodia, demonstrating regular exceeding of

227

30°C during transport (27, 28). Consequently, the WHO recommends heat stability testing

228

between 35°C and 40°C for MRDTs (29) and supply and delivery chains to tropical

229

countries must contain adequate cold chains (30).

230

As discussed by others, temperature stability guidelines for in vitro diagnostics exist,

231

however there are currently no specific guidelines for the validation of Ag-RDTs regarding

232

temperature stability (31-34). Common validation guidelines including environmental

233

conditions could be a first step towards globally reliable diagnostics.

234

At the same time, our data imply a huge challenge to tropical countries with regard to

235

adequate storage of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs. Besides storage capacity, temperature

236

control and monitoring of storage facilities is required, especially for long-term storage of

237

Ag-RDTs. To guarantee temperature-regulated storage, a certain level of infrastructure is

238

required, ideally air-conditioned facilities with temperature monitors and secured power

239

supply. However, these requirements are not realistic and appropriate concepts for

240

adequate storage in remote areas without electricity and rudimentary infrastructure will be

241

required.

Our study is limited by focusing on analytical test performance exclusively for reasons of

243

comparability of test results across the different conditions and based on limited access

244

to clinical samples. An additional limitation of our study is the use of duplicates for some

245

tests instead of a higher number of replicates, which was due to the limited availability of

246

all tests included in the study. Further studies will be required to assess test performance

247

upon tropical storage and application in tropical conditions using large numbers of clinical

248

samples. Additionally, not only the effect of elevated temperature but also the effect of

249

increased humidity on test performance will have to be assessed. Finally, future studies

250

documenting the impact of decreased temperature on test performance may also be

251

needed. Despite these limitations, our study presents a robust resource for further

252

validation studies as a high number of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs was included. Additionally,

253

our data on an overall impaired performance of Ag-RDTs at elevated temperatures are

254

consistent across tests and analytical sensitivity for several tests was identical upon usage

255

of either duplicates or higher numbers of replicates.

256

In sum, it was shown previously that clinically relevant virus concentrations of about 106

257

genome copies per ml suffice for virus isolation and culture and therefore serve as a

258

correlate for infectivity (35, 36). Our study strongly suggests that short- and long-term

259

exposure to elevated temperatures may compromise sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs
