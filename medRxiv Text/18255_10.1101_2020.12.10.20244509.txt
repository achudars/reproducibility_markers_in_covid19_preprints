Abstract
Many survivors from severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) suffer from persistent
dyspnea and fatigue long after resolution of the active infection. In a cohort of 25 consecutive
COVID-19 survivors admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation hospital (76% male), 80% of them
had at least one sonographic abnormality of diaphragm muscle structure or function.
Specifically, when compared to established normative data, 76% had reduced diaphragm
thickening ratio (impaired contractility), and 20% patients had reduced diaphragm muscle
thickness (atrophy). These findings support neuromuscular respiratory dysfunction as a highly
prevalent underlying cause for prolonged functional impairments after hospitalization for COVID19.

Introduction
The substantial burden of chronic disability post-hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) is increasingly clear.1 In a recent study, nearly half of COVID-19 patients were not
able to return to work 60 days after hospital discharge.1 Survivors of severe COVID-19
frequently report persistent shortness of breath, cough and fatigue post-hospitalization.1, 2 While
these symptoms may stem from direct involvement of the lung parenchyma itself, the possibility
of underlying neuromuscular respiratory weakness should be considered. Neurological
manifestations of COVID-19 are increasingly recognized with prominent involvement of the
neuromuscular system ranging from mild creatine kinase (CK) elevation to flaccid tetraplegia
requiring tracheostomy.3 Here we report neuromuscular ultrasound findings that define the
unexpectedly high prevalence of structural and functional alterations to the diaphragm muscle
after hospitalization for COVID-19.

Consecutive patients (n=25) were identified on admission to a dedicated COVID-19 unit at a
single rehabilitation hospital (Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, Chicago, USA). They were admitted to
inpatient rehabilitation from 14 separate acute care hospitals between July 21st, 2020 and
September 24th, 2020. Acute care data was obtained as available through chart review of
medical records as summarized in table 1. The diaphragm muscle was assessed on a portable
ultrasound system (TE7, Mindray, Mahwah, USA) with either a 6- to 14-MHz linear array or 2- to
5-MHz curvilinear array selected to maximize image clarity on the basis of individual
characteristics such as body habitus. Briefly, each hemi-diaphragm was identified in the zone of
apposition, and thickness was measured at end‐expiration and maximal inspiration (figure 1).
Normal values have been established for diaphragm end‐expiratory muscle thickness
(>0.14 cm) and thickening ratio (>1.2), calculated as thickness at maximal inspiration/thickness
at end‐expiration.4 Approval obtained from Northwestern University IRB (STU23625789).

Results
This report summarizes the assessment of 25 consecutive patients who survived COVID-19 and
were admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation unit in table 1. Briefly, of these patients 6 (24%)
were female and 19 (76%) were male, 12 (48%) had a diagnosis of pre-diabetes or diabetes
mellitus, 15 (60%) had hypertension, whereas only 3 (12%) had a diagnosis of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. The average time spent on a ventilator at
the acute care hospital was 44.3 days and the mean peak CK level in these patients was 753
U/L (range 39-3090 U/L). A total of 10 patients (40%) were on supplemental oxygen at the time
of diaphragm ultrasound, and none of them were ventilator dependent. There were 5 patients
(20%) who had an end-expiration thickness value below the normal cut off, whereas 19 patients
(76%) had a reduced thickening ratio on at least one side, and 10 patients (49%) had reduced
thickening ratio bilaterally. Overall, 20 patients (80%) had at least one structural or functional
abnormality on diaphragm ultrasound (figure 2).

Discussion
To our knowledge this is the first study utilizing ultrasound to evaluate the diaphragm in COVID19 survivors and demonstrates that patients who require inpatient rehabilitation after acute
hospitalization have a very high prevalence of diaphragm dysfunction. These findings are
remarkably similar to a previous report of sonographically identified diaphragm dysfunction in
patients with confirmed myopathy.5 In contrast, diaphragm ultrasound findings in patients with
chronic dyspnea related to COPD largely resembled the healthy population.6 Given the large
number of COVID-19 survivors who suffer from persistent dyspnea months after onset of
disease,7 it is possible that diaphragm muscle dysfunction is a major contributing factor.
Recent autopsy data obtained from COVID-19 patients admitted to an intensive care unit
in the Netherlands demonstrated that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor
represents an entry point for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 to directly
infect the diaphragm.8 However, only a modest subset (4 out of 26) had detectable levels of viral
ribonucleic acid present in the muscle tissue. Therefore, we hypothesize that the mechanism of
diaphragm involvement for the majority of COVID-19 patients is not from direct muscle infection,
but more likely analogous to that of critical illness myopathy (CIM). The pathophysiology of CIM
is considered a multifactorial condition associated with exposure to high-dose steroids, muscle
membrane dysfunction, microcirculatory changes associated with inflammation, and impaired
glucose transporter type 4 translocation to the muscle membranes.9, 10 This combination of
factors results primarily in atrophy of type 2 muscle fibers. The diaphragm is likely injured via the
same mechanism in COVID-19 as it is comprised of a nearly even mix of type 1 and type 2
myofibers.11
Our study provides new insight into neuromuscular respiratory weakness as an
important contributor to prolonged functional impairments in survivors from COVID-19. It
remains unclear to what extent diaphragm involvement may exist in milder COVID-19 not

requiring hospitalization. Subjective dyspnea and fatigue are among the most frequently
reported symptoms in these so called “long haulers”.12 Clinicians should consider a diaphragm
ultrasound study if there is clinical concern for neuromuscular respiratory weakness in nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19. Currently, long term dysfunction in these patients is
primarily attributed to lung parenchymal damage, overlooking diaphragm dysfunction as a
possible contributor.13 Given that the diaphragm is the main respiratory muscle, we speculate
that prolonged dysfunction may be a factor in at least a subset of patients. The high prevalence
of diaphragm dysfunction in more severe COVID-19 survivors highlights the importance of
neuromuscular respiratory rehabilitation protocols in this population. Further investigation is
required to determine how diaphragm structure and function recover after hospital discharge
and how this may related to their functional status or risk for further medical complications.
