Abstract
Background: Severe ill patients with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection
progressed rapidly to acute respiratory failure. We aimed to select the most useful
prognostic factor for severe illness incidence.
Methods: The study prospectively included 61 patients with 2019-nCoV infection
treated at Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 13, 2020 to January 31, 2020. Prognostic
factor of severe illness was selected by the LASSO COX regression analyses, to predict
the severe illness probability of 2019-CoV pneumonia. The predictive accuracy was
evaluated by concordance index, calibration curve, decision curve and clinical impact
curve.
Results: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was identified as the independent
risk factor for severe illness in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The NLR had a cindex
of 0.807

and the decision curve and clinical impact curve showed that the NLR had superior
standardized net benefit. In addition, the incidence of severe illness was 9.1% in age ≥
50 and NLR < 3.13 patients, and half of patients with age ≥ 50 and NLR ≥ 3.13 would
develop severe illness. Based on the risk stratification of NLR with age, the study
developed a 2019-nCoV pneumonia management process.
Conclusions: The NLR was the early identification of risk factors for 2019-nCoV severe
illness. Patients with age ≥ 50 and NLR ≥ 3.13 facilitated severe illness, and they should
rapidly access to intensive care unit if necessary.
Introduction
Coronavirus was a large virus family, which was known to cause common cold and
serious illness such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS).1-4 It was found that the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019nCoV) was the cause of unexplained viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China in December
2019, and was recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 12,
2020. In the following month, 2019-nCoV was transmitted in Hubei Province,
throughout China and even other countries,5 causing 34,662 confirmed cases by
February 8, 2020.
Most patients with novel coronavirus infection were mild. Moderate illness often
experienced dyspnea after one week. Severe ill patients progressed rapidly to acute
respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, metabolic acidosis,
coagulopathy, and septic shock. Early identification of risk factors for severe illness
facilitated appropriate supportive care and promptly access to the intensive care unit
(ICU) if necessary. For mild patients, general isolation and symptomatic treatment were
available, and ICU-care was needed unless the condition worsens rapidly, such to
reduce the mortality and alleviate the shortage of medical resources.
We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics, imaging features, treatments, and
outcomes of patients with mild and moderate or severe 2019-nCoV infection, to explore
the most useful prognostic factor for accurate individualized assessment of the severe
incidence of 2019-nCoV infection.
Methods
Patient selection
This study was a prospective single-center study, which included 61 patients with 2019nCoV infection treated at Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 13, 2020 to January 31,
2020. Diagnosis of 2019-nCoV pneumonia and clinical classification according to the
new coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan (trial version 4) developed
by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China
(http://www.nhc.gov.cn/). The clinical classifications are as follows: (1) mild, with

fever, respiratory tract symptoms, and imaging shows pneumonia. (2) moderate, meet
any of the following: a) respiratory distress, respiratory rate ≥ 30 beats / min; b) in the
resting state, means oxygen saturation ≤ 93%; c) arterial blood oxygen partial pressure
/ oxygen concentration ≤ 300mmHg (1mmHg = 0.133kPa). (3) severe, one of the
following conditions: a) respiratory failure occurs and requires mechanical ventilation;
b) Shock occurs; c) ICU admission is required for combined organ failure. This study
was approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Ditan Hospital, and all patients
signed the informed consent.
Baseline data collection
All suspected 2019-nCoV infection patients were taken upper respiratory throat swab
samples at admission and stored in virus transport medium, which were transported to
Beijing CDC for laboratory diagnosis. Inﬂuenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H7N9),
inﬂuenza B virus, bacterial and fungal detections of sputum or respiratory secretions
were performed at this hospital. Epidemiological history, comorbidity, vital signs,
symptoms and signs were recorded in detail, and laboratory tests including biochemical
Indicators, blood routine, C-reactive protein, chest radiograph or CT scan.
Follow-up
After admission, the patients were re-examined for laboratory indexes and imaging
examination, and recorded symptoms and signs, treatments and outcome events. The
endpoint of this study was the severe illness developed.
Statistical analysis
Age and days were represented by median (range), categorical variables by number (%),
and laboratory data by mean (interquartile range). The cutoff value of neutrophil-tolymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated based on the maximum Youden index.
Compared the differences between the two groups with t-test, chi-square test or MannWhitney U test. LASSO COX regression was used to select independent risk factors
that affect outcomes. Analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 statistical package
(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and R version 3.0.2 was used to establish nomogram,
calibration, decision curve and clinical impact curve. P-value < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Of the 61 patients with 2019-nCoV infection included in this study, 44 were diagnosed
as mild (mild group) and 17 as moderate or severe (severe group) on admission. The
median age of the two groups was statistically different, the mild group was 41 years
old and the severe group was 56 years old. None of the 61 patients had a history of
Huanan seafood market exposure in Wuhan, 17 of them (27.9%) had not left Beijing
recently, but had a close exposure history with 2019-nCoV pneumonia patients, and the

other 44 (72.1%) patients were Wuhan citizens or visited Wuhan recently. There was
no significant difference of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease between the two groups, but the patients with hypertension in the
severe group were more than those in the mild group (p = 0.056) (Table 1). Among 61
cases, 60 (98.4%) cases had fever, 5 (8.2%) cases had high fever ( > 39 ℃), 3 (4.9%)
cases had dyspnea. 7 (11.5%) cases had mild shortness of breath. Most of the patients
in the severe group had cough, sputum production, and fatigue. 11 (18.0%) cases had
gastrointestinal symptoms. Blood neutrophil count in the severe group was significantly
higher than that in the mild group, blood lymphocyte count, serum sodium and chlorine
levels were significantly lower, and the rate of bacterial infection was significantly
increased (Table 1).

The median days from illness onset to admission were 4 days in both groups. All
patients were isolated after admission, 34 (55.7%) patients received antiviral treatment,
of which 8 patients received oseltamivir (75 mg every 12 h, orally), 26 patients received
lopinavir and ritonavir tablets (200 mg twice daily, orally). Nearly half of the patients
received antibiotic therapy (42.6%), and 84.2% of the patients in the severe group
received antibiotic therapy. One patient was received methylprednisolone for 3 days
before admission and stopped after admission, and another patient took
methylprednisolone 8 mg every other day for ten months for optic neuromyelitis and
continued taking it after admission. Most of the patients in the severe group received
oxygen support and nebulization inhalation therapy, of which 3 patients received noninvasive ventilation and 2 received invasive mechanical ventilation. Nebulization
inhalation drugs included recombinant human interferon α2b and acetylcysteine. By the
end of Jan 31, no patients died, 3 patients were discharged, and the remaining patients
were in hospital, of which 8 patients progressed to severe illness and still in the ICU
(Table 1).
X-ray or CT showed multiple lung lobe or bilateral involvement in 48 (78.7%) patients.

Prognostic factors of severe illness
26 variables were included in the LASSO regression, the results showed that age, NLR
and hypertension obtained from the 61 cases cohort were predictive factors for severe
illness incidence when the partial likelihood deviance was smallest, and NLR was the
significant factors when the lambda was 1 standard error (Figure 2A and 2B). The three
factors mentioned above were included in the multivariate COX regression analyses,
the results showed that age and NLR were predictive factors. However, the hazard ratios
(HR) of age was close to 1, then age was transformed into a categorical variable (< 50
years / ≥ 50 years) based on cutoff value, and then the three variables were included in
the COX regression analyses again. Finally, NLR was selected as the most useful
prognostic factor affecting the prognosis for severe illness incidence by the forward
selection procedure.

of 0.807 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.676–0.938) for predicting the severe illness
probability. The calibration curves showed that the predicted rates were in agreement
with the actual results observed in the cohort (Figure 2D). The decision curve and
clinical impact curve showed that the NLR had superior standardized net benefit and
influence on the outcome of patients (Figure 2E and 2F).
Comparison of the NLR with MuLBSTA and CURB-65
Using receiver operating characteristic analysis, the predictive value of the NLR for the
incidence of severe illness was compared to that of the MuLBSTA and CURB-6 models.
The results showed that the NLR had the highest area under curve (AUC) (0.849), and
had higher sensitivity and specificity than the other two models (Table 2).
After NLR was incorporated into MuLBSTA (NLR-MuLBSTA) and CURB-65 (NLRCURB-65) models respectively, it was found that the prediction effect of the improved
model was significantly better than that of the original model, but there was no
significant difference of AUC in NLR vs. NLR-MuLBSTA and NLR vs. NLR-CURB65 (p = 0.9675 and p = 0.2971, respectively) (Table 2).

Performance of the NLR in stratifying risk of patients
The median follow-up time was 10 days, minimum 2 days, and maximum 26 days.
Patients were divided into two strata according to the cutoff value of NLR (low risk: <
3.13; high risk: ≥ 3.13) and age (age < 50 years; age ≥ 50 years). Kaplan–Meier analysis
showed significant statistical differences in the two groups (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.00028)
(Figure 3A and 3B). Furthermore, patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia were stratified
for severe illness incidence with respect to age with NLR (strata 1: age < 50 years and
NLR < 3.13; strata 2: age < 50 years and NLR ≥ 3.13; strata 3: age ≥ 50 years and NLR
< 3.13; strata 4: age ≥ 50 years and NLR ≥ 3.13). There was no severe illness case in
the strata 1 and strata 2, 1 (9.1%) case in the strata 3 and 7 (50%) cases in the strata 4.
As shown in Figure 3C, the severe illness incidence was significantly different between
strata 3 and 4 (p = 0.0195), but the difference between the strata 2 and 3 was not
significant (p = 0.4142).

Discussion
Since the outbreak of 2019-nCoV pneumonia in December 2019, there were 2000 to
4000 new confirmed patients every day in China, and the number of severe cases and
deaths was also increasing day by day. The research showed that 26% of patients
received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%.6 The number of patients in Wuhan and
other regions is increasing rapidly. The current difficulty is the shortage of medical

resources, especially critical care resources. If severe cases can be identified as early as
possible, risk stratification management will help alleviate insufficient medical
resources and might reduce mortality. No risk predictive model of severe illness about
2019-nCoV pneumonia has been published to date.
Most of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia patients in the hospital were from Wuhan. Patients
with 2019-nCoV pneumonia on early onset were not very severe. The median time from
onset to admission of severe patients and mild patients was similar, but the severe
patients deteriorated on 7-14 days of illness course and developed to severe pneumonia
and acute respiratory failure. The severe or death patients with 2019-nCoV infection
were mostly old age with comorbidities.7 In the study, severe ill ones are all over 50
years old. The decrease of lymphocyte count was related to the progress of the disease.
we proposed that blood lymphocyte related index may be a potential predictor. The
NLR was a widely used marker for the assessment of the severity of bacterial infections
and the prognosis of patients with pneumonia and tumors. The increase of NLR
indicated poor clinical prognosis.8-14 The results indicated that 2019-nCoV may act on
T lymphocytes, and T lymphocyte damage is an important factor that causes patients to
deteriorate13. In addition, patients with severe illness might have bacterial infection due
to low immune function. The latest report followed up the laboratory test results of
patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and found that 5 patients had a rising neutrophil
count and a falling lymphocyte count before their deaths.6
In the study, the data of 61 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia were analyzed, the
baseline characteristics of patients in the mild and severe groups were described and
compared, and the dynamic changes of laboratory indexes and imaging were
demonstrated. The independent risk factors affecting incidence of severe illness were
screened. The results showed that NLR was the most significant factor affecting the
severe illness incidence, and it had significant predictive value. Furthermore, according
to the NLR and age stratification, the incidence of severe ill ones with NLR ≥ 3.13 and
aged ≥ 50 years old was 50%, and 9.1% in age ≥ 50 and NLR < 3.13 patients.
Previous studies showed that the MuLBSTA score can early warn the mortality of viral
pneumonia, which included six indicators, such as age, smoking history, hypertension,
bacterial co-infection, lymphopenia, and multilobular infiltration.15 CURB-65 score
was widely used to evaluate 30-day mortality of patients with community-acquired
pneumonia.16-18 In the study, NLR was compared with MuLBSTA and CURB-65
scoring models, the results showed that NLR had higher AUC, c-index, sensitivity and
specificity, which indicated that NLR was better than the other two models in early
predicting the incidence of severe illness. Furthermore, it was found that the prediction
effect of the NLR-MuLBSTA and NLR-CURB-65 models was better than that of the
original model. But NLR was an easy-to-use predictor index.
Based on the results, we suggest that patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia can improve
risk stratification and management according to NLR and age model. Patients with age
< 50 years old and NLR < 3.13 who are no risk should be treated in a community

hospital or home isolation. Patients with age < 50 years old and NLR ≥ 3.13 who are
low risk need to be general isolation ward. Patients with age ≥ 50 and NLR < 3.13
patients who are moderate risk, should be admitted to isolation ward with respiratory
monitoring and supportive care. Patients with age ≥ 50 and NLR ≥ 3.13 who are high
risk should actively transfer to ICU with invasive respiratory support equipment (Figure
3D). If there are large-scale cases, the risk stratification and management will help
alleviate the shortage of medical resources and reduce the mortality of critical patients.
There were some limitations in the study. First, the study was a single center with small
sample and no external validation cohort. Second, most of patients are still in hospital,
whose condition maybe change in follow-up. And the study has not included the final
survival outcome. However, we focused on the early identification of critical cases for
risk stratification and management. We expect that the risk model can help alleviate the
shortage of medical resources and manage the patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia.
Conclusion
The NLR was the most useful prognostic factor affecting the prognosis for severe
illness patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia. Early application of NLR with age was
beneficial to patients' classification management and relief of medical resource shortage.
