Abstract
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe critical condition with a high mortality
that is currently in focus given that it is associated with mortality caused by coronavirus
induced disease 2019 (COVID-19). Neutrophils play a key role in the lung injury characteristic
of non-COVID-19 ARDS and there is also accumulating evidence of neutrophil mediated lung
injury in patients who succumb to infection with SARS-CoV-2. We undertook a functional
proteomic and metabolomic survey of circulating neutrophil populations, comparing patients
with COVID-19 ARDS and non-COVID-19 ARDS to understand the molecular basis of
neutrophil dysregulation.

Expansion of the circulating neutrophil compartment and the

presence of activated low and normal density mature and immature neutrophil populations
occurs in ARDS, irrespective of cause. Release of neutrophil granule proteins, neutrophil
activation of the clotting cascade and upregulation of the Mac-1 platelet binding complex with
formation of neutrophil platelet aggregates is exaggerated in COVID-19 ARDS. Importantly,
activation of components of the neutrophil type I interferon responses is seen in ARDS
following infection with SARS-CoV-2, with associated rewiring of neutrophil metabolism, and
the upregulation of antigen processing and presentation. Whilst dexamethasone treatment
constricts the immature low density neutrophil population it does not impact upon
prothrombotic hyperinflammatory neutrophil signatures.

Summary: Given the crucial role of neutrophils in ARDS and the evidence of a disordered
myeloid response observed in COVID-19 patients, our work maps the molecular basis for
neutrophil reprogramming in the distinct clinical entities of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
ARDS.

Conclusions: This work maps the molecular basis for neutrophil reprogramming in the distinct
clinical entities of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory condition caused by novel coronavirus
(SARS-CoV-2) infection. In the most severe cases (termed “Critical COVID-19”), infection
with SARS-CoV-2 can lead to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
(1). ARDS is a clinical syndrome defined by the presence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on
chest radiograph and arterial hypoxaemia that develops acutely in response to a known or
suspected insult. ARDS is known to be the consequence of disordered inflammation (2), and
is characterised by a protein-rich oedema in the alveoli and lung interstitium, driven by
epithelial and vascular injury (2, 3) and increased vascular permeability (4, 5). Limited data
exists regarding the mechanisms causing hypoxaemia and lung inflammation following
infection with SARS-CoV-2, although post-mortem case reports provide evidence of diffuse
alveolar damage, with the presence of proteinaceous exudates in the alveolar spaces, intraalveolar fibrin and alveolar wall expansion (6). In previously described ARDS cohorts in which
SARS-CoV-2 was not an aetiological factor, alveolar damage is associated with worsening
hypoxia and increased mortality (7). In this context, hypoxia is a key driver of dysfunctional

inflammation in the lung, augmenting neutrophil persistence and survival (8, 9) and promoting
the release of pro-inflammatory mediators that cause ongoing tissue injury (2, 3). Nondyspnoeic hypoxia is widely described in patients with severe COVID-19 (10), where it is
associated with altered circulating leukocyte profiles with an increase in neutrophil to
lymphocyte ratios and the presence of lymphopaenia (11, 12). More recently, post-mortem
studies have revealed that the diffuse alveolar damage does not directly associate with the
detection of virus, supporting the concept of aberrant host immune responses as drivers of
tissue injury and pulmonary disease progression (13). A disordered myeloid response is further
evidenced by analysis of gene clusters and surface protein expression of whole blood and
peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) layers of patients with mild and severe COVID-19
(14). However, the functional relevance of these transcriptional signatures remains to be
explored given the limited reliance of neutrophils on transcription to regulate protein
expression (15). It also remains to be addressed whether the observed changes in neutrophil
sub-populations are specific to COVID-19 ARDS or a reflection of the aberrant neutrophil
inflammatory responses more broadly associated with the pathogenesis of ARDS. It is also
unclear as to how these may be impacted by anti-inflammatory strategies including
dexamethasone, which has shown to lower 28-day mortality for patients receiving invasive
mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone (16).

One of the distinct features of COVID-19 that has emerged is the clinical evidence of a prothrombotic state, neutrophil retention within the lung microvasculature and the colocalisation
of neutrophils with platelets in fibrin rich clots (17). Together with evidence of the formation
of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (18, 19) this raises the important question as to whether
neutrophils are inappropriately activated within the circulation thus contributing to vascular
injury and thrombosis in COVID-19. Exploring the differences in neutrophil responses

between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS provides an opportunity to understand the
mechanisms common to ARDS and those that drive the hypercoagulable hyperinflammatory
state specific to COVID-19 thus identifying urgently required therapeutic targets.

In this program of work, we compared the blood neutrophil populations of patients with
COVID-19 ARDS to those of patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS, moderate COVID-19 and
healthy controls to define the neutrophil host response to SARS-CoV-2. Prior to SARS-CoV2, a significant confounder of ARDS studies has been the heterogeneity of the underlying
processes that result in ARDS with hyperinflammatory and hypoinflammatory phenotypes
described. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 provides a unifying trigger to this aberrant host
response, whilst comparison between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS allows us to
identify neutrophil responses that are observed following infection with SARS-CoV-2, or
associated with ARDS all cause.

Methods
Healthy donor and patient recruitment
Human peripheral venous blood was taken from healthy volunteers with written informed
consent obtained from all participants prior to sample collection as approved by the University
of Edinburgh Centre for Inflammation Research Blood Resource Management Committee
(AMREC 15-HV-013). The collection of peripheral venous blood from patients diagnosed with
COVID-19 and/or presenting with ARDS was approved by Scotland A Research Ethics
Committee. Patient recruitment took place from April 2020 through January 2021 from The
Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Scotland, UK through the ARDS Neut (20/SS/0002) and
CASCADE (20/SS/0052) Study, with informed consent obtained by proxy. The presence of

ARDS was defined using the Berlin criteria (20). Acute physiology and chronic health
evaluation (APACHE II) score = acute physiology score + age points + chronic health points,
was undertaken (minimum score = 0; maximum score = 71), where increasing score is
associated with increasing risk of hospital death (21). Functional Comorbidity Index data (FCI)
was also captured as an 18-item list of comorbidities used to adjust for the effect on
physiological function (22). Scores were performed on intensive care unit admission or earliest
time possible. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
either on nasopharyngeal swab, or deep airway samples. In non-COVID-19 ARDS viral
infection was excluded.

Isolation of human peripheral blood neutrophils
Up to 80 mL of whole blood was collected into citrate tubes. An aliquot of 5 mL of whole
blood was treated with red cell lysis buffer (Invitrogen) and with the remaining volume, human
blood leukocytes were isolated by dextran sedimentation and discontinuous Percoll gradients
as described by Haslett et al. (1985) (23).

Cell Culture
Normal density neutrophils (NDN) obtained from the polymorphonuclear (PMN) layer of
healthy donors were resuspended at 5 × 106/mL in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)
1640 (Gibco) with 10% dialyzed foetal calf serum (Gibco) and 50 U/mL streptomycin and
penicillin in normoxia (19 kPa) or hypoxia (3 kPa) at 5% CO2 as previously described (24).
Cells were cultured in the absence or presence of interferon (IFN)α/ IFNβ (500 units/mL)
and/or resiquimod (15 μM, Sigma-Aldrich) for the indicated time prior to harvest. For flow
cytometry studies using dexamethasone and resiquimod, cells were cultured in hypoxia and
pre-treated with varying doses of dexamethasone (0-1 μM) for 4 h, followed by treatment with

resiquimod (15 μM) for 1 h. For heavy glutamine tracing studies, NDN were cultured in the
presence of 2 mM U-13C5 glutamine (Cambridge). For extracellular flux analysis, cells were
cultured in the presence or absence of interferon in hypoxia as above before transfer to an
extracellular flux cell culture microplate after 3 hours.

Flow cytometry
Lysed whole blood, PMN and PBMC layers isolated from Percoll gradients, as well as healthy
control NDN used for dexamethasone/resiquimod studies were stained with Zombie Aqua™
Fixable viability dye (1:400) (Biolegend) to exclude dead cells from analysis. Cells were
subsequently treated with Human TruStain FcX™ (1:100) (Biolegend) and stained for 30 min
on ice with antibodies listed in Table 1 with appropriate fluorescence minus one (FMO)
controls. Cells were then washed and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA) and acquired
using BD LSRFortessa™ flow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson). Compensation was performed
using BD FACSDiva™ software version 8.0 and data analysed in FlowJo version 10.2. Gating
strategy to identify neutrophils, maturity and surface expression of various markers are outlined
in Figure 1. Samples with neutrophil purity of <95% (CD66b+CD49d-) were excluded from
analysis.

Proteomic sample preparation
NDN were centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 7 mL of 0.2 % NaCl
(w/v in H2O) for 5 min at room temperature and topped up with 7 mL of 0.2 % NaCl (w/v in
H2O). Cells were washed twice in DPBS (Thermo Fisher), pelleted at 300 × g for 5 min at 4
°C and resuspended in 372 μL of freshly made 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) lysis buffer
and vortexed. Samples were then heat denatured in a heat block for 5 min at 100 °C and stored
at –80 °C. Cell lysates were thawed and tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP)

and triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) were added to a final concentration of 10 mM and
50 mM respectively. Lysates were shaken at 500 rpm at 22 °C for 5 min before being incubated
at 98 °C for 5 min. Samples were allowed to cool and were then sonicated with a BioRuptor
(30 cycles: 30 s on and 30 s off). Tubes were centrifuged at 17,000 × g to collect the cell lysate
and 1 mL of benzonase (27.8 units) was added to each sample and samples incubated at 37 °C
for 15 min. Samples were then alkylated with addition of 20 mM iodoacetamide for 1 h at 22
°C in the dark. Protein lysates were processed for mass spectrometry using s-trap spin columns
following the manufacturer’s instructions (Protifi) (25). Lysates were digested with Trypsin at
a ratio 1:20 (protein:enzyme) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Peptides were eluted from strap columns by sequentially adding 80 mL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate followed by 80
mL of 0.2 % formic acid with a final elution using 80 mL of 50 % acetonitrile + 0.2 % formic
acid.

LC-MS analysis
For each sample, 2 mg of peptide was analysed on a Q-Exactive-HF-X (Thermo Scientific)
mass spectrometer coupled with a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RS (Thermo Scientific). LC buffers
were the following: buffer A (0.1% formic acid in Milli-Q water (v/v)) and buffer B (80%
acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in Milli-Q water (v/v)). 2 μg aliquot of each sample were
loaded at 15 μL/min onto a trap column (100 μm × 2 cm, PepMap nanoViper C18 column, 5
μm, 100 Å, Thermo Scientific) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The trap
column was washed for 3 min at the same flow rate with 0.1% TFA then switched in-line with
a Thermo Scientific, resolving C18 column (75 μm × 50 cm, PepMap RSLC C18 column, 2
μm, 100 Å). The peptides were eluted from the column at a constant flow rate of 300 nl/min
with a linear gradient from 3% buffer B to 6% buffer B in 5 min, then from 6% buffer B to
35% buffer B in 115 min, and finally to 80% buffer B within 7 min. The column was then

washed with 80% buffer B for 4 min and re-equilibrated in 3% buffer B for 15 min. Two blanks
were run between each sample to reduce carry-over. The column was kept at a constant
temperature of 50 oC at all times.

The data was acquired using an easy spray source operated in positive mode with spray voltage
at 1.9 kV, the capillary temperature at 250 °C and the funnel RF at 60 °C. The MS was operated
in DIA mode as reported earlier (26) with some modifications. A scan cycle comprised a full
MS scan (m/z range from 350-1650, with a maximum ion injection time of 20 ms, a resolution
of 120 000 and automatic gain control (AGC) value of 5 × 106). MS survey scan was followed
by MS/MS DIA scan events using the following parameters: default charge state of 3,
resolution 30.000, maximum ion injection time 55 ms, AGC 3 x 106, stepped normalized
collision energy 25.5, 27 and 30, fixed first mass 200 m/z. The inclusion list (DIA windows)
and windows widths are shown in Table 2. Data for both MS and MS/MS scans were acquired
in profile mode. Mass accuracy was checked before the start of samples analysis.

Analysis of proteomics data
The DIA data were analyzed with Spectronaut 14 using the directDIA option (27). Cleavage
Rules were set to Trypsin/P, Peptide maximum length was set to 52 amino acids, Peptide
minimum length was set to 7 amino acids and Missed Cleavages set to 2. Calibration Mode
was set to Automatic. Search criteria included carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed
modification, as well as oxidation of methionine, deamidation of asparagine and glutamine and
acetylation (protein N-terminus) as variable modifications. The FDR threshold was set to 1%
Q-value at both the Precursor and Protein level. The single hit definition was to Stripped
sequence. The directDIA data were searched against the human SwissProt database (July 2020)
and included isoforms. The Major Group Quantity was set to the Sum of peptide quantity and

the Minor Group Quantity was set to the Sum of the precursor quantity; Cross Run
Normalization was disabled. Fold changes and P-values were calculated in R utilising the
bioconductor package LIMMA version 3.7(28). The Q-values provided were generated in R
using the “qvalue” package version 2.10.0. Estimates of protein copy numbers per cell were
calculated using the histone ruler method (29). The mass of individual proteins was estimated
using the following formula: CN × MW/NA = protein mass (g cell−1), where CN is the protein
copy number, MW is the protein molecular weight (in Da) and NA is Avogadro’s Constant.
Raw mass spectrometry data files and Spectronaut analysis files have been deposited to the
ProteomeXchange (30) Consortium via the PRIDE (31) partner repository.

Cell immunostaining for microscopy
PMN and PBMC layers isolated from Percoll gradients were fixed with 1.5 % PFA. FACS of
NDN and LDN from PMN and PBMC layers respectively were performed using BD
FACSAria™ Fusion flow cytometer fitted with a 70 µm nozzle and running BD FACSDiva™
software version 8.0 (Beckton Dickinson). Singlets were gated according to forward scatter
height vs. forward scatter area (FSC-H vs. FSC-A) and side scatter height vs. side scatter area
(SSC-H vs. SSC-A) parameters and NDN and LDN identified according to forward vs. side
scatter (FSC vs. SSC) parameters. NDN and LDN were collected at 4 °C in 15 mL Falcon tubes
pre-coated with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; Thermo Fisher).
Cells were pelleted and blocked with Fc Receptor Blocking Solution followed by staining with
anti-CD41 antibody (Biolegend) and counterstaining with propidium iodide (Biolegend)
according to manufacturer’s guidelines. Multichamber slides (Ibidi) were used to image the
samples in a confocal microscope (Leica SP8). Image acquisition was performed at 63x
magnification with the same settings across all images. Fiji software was used to process the
images (32). Scale bars depict 5 m.

Measurement of granule protein levels
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed according to manufacturer’s
protocol to quantify MPO, lactoferrin and elastase levels (Abcam) in plasma from healthy
donors, non-COVID-19 ARDS, COVID-19 patients and cell media supernatant of resiquimod
treated NDN cultures from healthy donors (15 μM, Sigma-Aldrich).

Metabolomic analysis
2.5 × 106 neutrophils freshly isolated from the PMN layer of patients were centrifuged at 300
× g for 5 min at 4 °C, with pellets resuspended in 100 μL of 80% methanol. Alternatively, 5 ×
106 NDN from healthy controls were cultured in hypoxia for 4 h in the presence or absence of
IFNα/IFNβ, washed twice in ice cold saline following culture and lysed in 200 μL of 50:30:20
methanol:acetonitrile:water. Following extraction, samples were stored at –80 °C. Relative
metabolite abundance was determined using ion-pairing Reverse Phase High Performance
Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) or Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography
coupled to a Q-exactive Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer. Data were analysed in a targeted manner,
using Xcalibur (Thermofisher Scientific) against an in-house compound library to integrate the
area under the curve at the expected retention time. Individual metabolites were expressed
relative to the mean of the healthy control population and analysed in Prism 9.00 (Graphpad
Software Inc).

Extracellular flux analysis
After culture, cells were harvested into sealed eppendorfs and maintained in hypoxia for one
wash in warm saline. Cells were resuspended at 3 × 106/mL in XF DMEM pH 7.4 (Agilent),
supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and IFNα/IFNβ added to the appropriate cells at the

concentrations described previously. 3 × 106 neutrophils were adhered into each well of a 24well cell culture microplate (Agilent) pretreated with cell-tak (Corning) to give triplicate
samples per condition with 4 wells were left as media controls. After allowing CO2 to degas
for 45 min in a hypoxic incubator, the plate was loaded into a Seahorse XFe 24 Analyzer
(Agilent) operated in a hypoxic chamber (3% O2, 0.1% CO2; SCI-tive hypoxic work station,
Baker Russkinn). Treatment compounds were resuspended in XF DMEM and cells were
sequentially treated by injection of resiquimod (15𝜇M), glucose (10 mM, Sigma), oligomycin
A (1 μM, Sigma) and 2-deoxyglucose (50 mM, Sigma). All media and compounds were preequilibrated in hypoxia. Data were acquired using Seahorse Wave Controller (version 2.6,
Agilent) and analysed using Wave before exporting to GraphPad to pool for final analysis.

Statistical analyses
Statistical tests were performed using Prism 9.00 software (GraphPad Software Inc). Data was
tested for normality using Shapiro-Wilk test and outliers excluded according to Grubb’s test,
with significance testing detailed in figure legends. Significance was defined as a p value of
<0.05 after correction for multiple comparisons where applicable. Sample sizes are shown in
figure legends, with each n number representing a different donor.

Results
Study population cohorts
To define the circulating neutrophil response to infection with SARS-CoV-2 we studied
peripheral blood neutrophil populations isolated from hospitalised patients with moderate
COVID-19 and COVID-19 ARDS, comparing these to critical care patients with non-COVID19 ARDS and healthy controls (male, n = 4; female, n = 5; age range: 20 – 50 years) (Figure

2A). Patient demographic details are provided in Table 3. In accordance with the WHO
COVID-19 classification, patients recruited had either moderate (clinical signs of pneumonia
with oxygen saturations >90%) or critical (ARDS) COVID-19 (33). Patients with Berlin
criteria ARDS had mean APACHE II scores of 18.1 (Non-COVID-19) and 14.8 (COVID-19)
respectively. Viral infections were excluded from the aetiology of non-COVID-19 ARDS. Of
the 12 patients recruited with COVID-19 ARDS, 9 received dexamethasone.

Circulating neutrophil populations are expanded in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
ARDS
To explore the different neutrophil populations, flow cytometry analysis of whole blood was
first performed to identify CD66b+ cells as neutrophils, with CD16 used as a marker of
maturity. CD66b+CD16+ and CD66b+CD16- cells were observed, indicating the presence of
a heterogenous population of mature and immature neutrophils in ARDS patients, regardless
of COVID-19 status (Figure 2B). Given immature neutrophils are characteristically lowdensity neutrophils (LDN) and associated with disease (34), flow cytometry analysis was
performed on PMN and PBMC layers isolated using Percoll density gradients. Further
characterisation of neutrophil maturity was undertaken by CD10 expression and showed both
a mature (CD66b+CD16+CD10+) and immature (CD66b+CD16-CD10-) LDN population in
the PBMC layer of non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 ARDS patients (Figure 2C). In contrast,
these populations are notably absent in the PBMC layer of healthy control individuals (Figure
2C). Importantly, these LDN populations demonstrated evidence of increased activation states
with loss of CD62L (Figure 2D), and upregulation of both CD66b and CD63 (Figure 2E-F).
Total neutrophil counts generated from Percoll preparations showed a large expansion of
neutrophils in ARDS (Figure 2G). Though a major proportion of the neutrophil population
consisted of mature NDN from the PMN layer, we detected the presence of immature and

mature low density neutrophil populations in ARDS patients (Figure 2H). Of note, the increase
in immature LDN in the COVID-19 ARDS cohort was significantly reduced in those receiving
dexamethasone despite a retained expansion of NDN and mature LDN populations (Figure
2H).

Circulating neutrophils restructure their proteomes whilst retaining global cellular
processes in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS
A growing body of studies have described a disordered myeloid response following infection
with SARS-CoV-2 using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These studies provide
important insights to the reprogramming of myelopoiesis and the emergence of precursor
neutrophil populations. However, there is a real need to understand how these transcriptional
signatures relate to functional changes in myeloid cell responses, which requires information
at a protein level. To understand changes in the functional proteome of circulating neutrophils
we used a label free Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry approach.
Estimates of protein copy numbers per cell were calculated using the histone ruler method (29),
along with total cellular protein content and the mass of subcellular compartments. We
compared protein abundance between non-COVID-19 ARDS, COVID-19 ARDS and healthy
control neutrophil populations. Analysis of the NDN populations, common to both healthy
control and ARDS identified around 4500 proteins (Figure 3A), with a subtle reduction in the
total protein content of COVID-19 ARDS neutrophils (Figure 3B). We observed preservation
of global cellular processes across all disease groups evidenced by equivalent mitochondrial
protein content, ribosomal protein content, nuclear envelope protein abundance and
cytoskeletal protein abundance (Figure 3C). Key components of the translation initiation
complex were also conserved across health and disease groups (Figure 3D). This would suggest
that any differences observed in key neutrophil functions are not driven by a loss of core

cellular processes and, therefore, more likely to be consequent upon activation of signalling
pathways in response to infectious and inflammatory challenges. Globally we only detected a
small number of proteins involved in transcription factor activity whose abundance was
modified in response to COVID-19 (Figure 3E). These included the interferon regulated
proteins TRIM22 and STAT1, which were induced in COVID-19 ARDS neutrophils and the
glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1 which was down regulated.

To determine which components of the neutrophil proteome remodel in patients with COVID19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS we undertook Linear Models for Microarray data (LIMMA)
analysis to identify significant differences in protein abundance (data are available via
ProteomeXchange). We identified more than 200 proteins to be increased in abundance
between COVID-19 ARDS and healthy control neutrophils which were not significantly
changing in non-COVID ARDS (Figure 4A-B). Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis
of these differentially regulated proteins identified a COVID-19 signature which was defined
by a greater abundance of proteins in type I IFN signalling pathways and the platelet
degranulation (Figure 4B). Change in expression of cullin 2, cyclin dependent kinase 2,

(MCM3-5 and MCM7) and

phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase, proteins associated in other cell types with
cell cycle control, was common to both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS, whilst proteins
important for mitochondrial translational termination and cell surface receptor signalling
pathways were enriched in non-COVID-19 ARDS samples (Figure 4B). We identified 115
proteins with reduced abundance in ARDS (all cause) versus healthy control neutrophils,
including some proteins that were specific to COVID-19. However, distinct biological
processes impacted by SARS-CoV-2 infection were not identified among those proteins
with reduced abundance.

COVID-19 ARDS neutrophils form aggregates with platelets and activate prothrombotic
pathways with enrichment in the low density population
A striking clinical and post-mortem observation in patients with COVID-19 is the prevalence
of micro and macrovascular thrombosis. With previous evidence of NET formation (18, 19),
together with the colocalization of neutrophils with platelets in fibrin rich clots and our
identification of a platelet degranulation signature within the COVID-19 ARDS samples, this
led us to question the mechanism by which neutrophils could be contributing to immune
mediated thrombosis in COVID-19. NDN displayed an overall increase in proteins associated
with fibrin clot formation; fibrinogen alpha, fibrinogen beta and coagulation factor XIII alpha
chain (F13A1) and a failure to induce proteins that inhibit fibrin clot formation in NDN like
antithrombin-III (Figure 5A). This signature was greatest in COVID-19 ARDS neutrophils
(Figure 5A). We also detected a platelet protein signature indicated by the presence of the
platelet proteins platelet factor 4, platelet basic protein (Figure 5B). Confocal imaging on
sorted mature neutrophil populations from COVID-19 ARDS patients subsequently revealed
the existence of a direct physical association between LDN and platelets in these patients, as
opposed to neutrophils from healthy donors (Figure 5C). To understand how neutrophil
platelet aggregates were forming we looked for evidence of platelet activation on the neutrophil
surface, and neutrophil expression of adhesion molecules involved in platelet interactions.
Initial measurements for expression of CD41, a marker of platelet activation, revealed the
presence of CD41 on mature LDN isolated from COVID-19 patients (Figure 5D). This
coincided with a significant increase in mature neutrophil expression of the CD11b component
of the Mac-1 platelet binding complex (Figure 5E). This phenotype was specific to the mature
neutrophil populations, with only low-level surface expression of CD41, CD18, CD11b
observed in the immature LDN population (Figure 5D-E).

Toll like receptors (TLRs) are important for viral recognition by the innate immune response.
TLR family members 7 and 8 have been previously reported to enable recognition of single
stranded RNA viruses including influenza and SARS-CoV-2 (35, 36). To directly address
whether neutrophil sensing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was important for the regulation of Mac-1,
we stimulated healthy control neutrophils with TLR 7 and 8 agonist resiquimod (37).
Additionally, hypoxic culture conditions were used to replicate the systemic hypoxia that
circulating neutrophils are exposed to in patients with COVID-19 ARDS. Resiquimod upregulated neutrophil expression of both components of the Mac-1 platelet binding complex,
CD11b and CD18 (Figure 5F) replicating the observed phenotype of COVID-19. In keeping
with the patient data, the addition of dexamethasone to resiquimod stimulation did not impact
CD11b or CD18 expression (Figure 5F).

The presence of neutrophil platelet aggregates in patients with COVID-19 ARDS led us to
question why neutrophils were binding to activated platelets, and whether there was evidence
that neutrophils themselves were becoming inappropriately activated in the blood. Neutrophils
express a plethora of cell surface receptors to enable them to respond to noxious stimuli. A
key element of this response is the highly regulated release of cytotoxic granule proteins.
However, inappropriate degranulation in the lung tissue during ARDS is associated with
epithelial and vascular damage which in turn potentiates lung injury (38). In health, the release
of toxic granules by neutrophils in the circulation is limited by the requirement of a second
activation stimulus following neutrophil priming (39). Comparison of the proteomes of NDN
populations revealed that granule cargo proteins are highly abundant and account for
approximately 20% of the neutrophil protein mass (Figure 6A). In both COVID-19 and nonCOVID-19 ARDS, whilst we observed an equivalent abundance of primary (CD63, CD68 and

Presenilin-1), secondary (Ras related proteins 1A-B and 2A-C), secondary and tertiary
(secretory carrier membrane protein 1-4, vesicle associated membrane protein 2) and
specifically tertiary (solute carrier 11A1) granule membrane proteins (data are available via
ProteomeXchange), there is a relative reduction in the abundance of the granule cargo proteins
within these circulating cells (Figure 6B). Survey of these individual proteases reveals these
changes to be modest, but to occur across the different granule compartments and to be
amplified in COVID-19 (Figure 6C-J). To address whether this relative reduction in intracellular granule protein content was consequent upon neutrophil degranulation, we quantified
surface expression of CD63, a protein known to be externalised upon degranulation, and
CD66b, whose surface expression augments in response to degranulation. We observed a
significant increase in CD63 and CD66b expression which was specific to the COVID-19
ARDS neutrophils (Figure 6K). Importantly an increase in serum levels of the neutrophil
granule proteins myeloperoxidase (MPO), lactoferrin and elastase in the COVID-19 ARDS
patient cohort (Figure 6L) confirmed a phenotype of enhanced circulating neutrophil
degranulation in the COVID-19 ARDS patient cohort, which was not impacted by
dexamethasone (Figure 6M). Consistent with neutrophil sensing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
promoting activation and degranulation, stimulation of healthy control neutrophils with the
TLR7 and 8 agonist resiquimod increased neutrophil shedding of CD62L and upregulated
expression of CD66b and CD63 (Figure 6N). This resulted in an increase in detectable levels
of the granule proteins MPO and lactoferrin in the cell culture supernatants (Figure 6O).

Activation of neutrophil type I interferon signalling pathways and antigen presentation
in COVID-19
Type I IFN are a group of cytokines which characterise the anti-viral response but are also
implicated in inflammatory disease and in malignancy. Persistent high levels of circulating

type I IFN are associated with more severe disease in the late stages of disease (40), thought to
be due to dysfunctional inflammation rather than uncontrolled viral infection. This complexity
is further reflected in the divergent signals in IFN stimulated genes (ISG) described in whole
blood and PBMC myeloid cell populations, where select changes in transcript abundance are
used to identify specific cell clusters (14). Here, we report using LIMMA analysis of NDN
proteomes a type I IFN signature within the COVID-19 ARDS neutrophils (Figure 4B). We
therefore surveyed the abundance of proteins involved in anti-viral responses downstream of
IFNα/β receptor (IFNAR). This revealed across the pathway a greater abundance of proteins
important for type I IFN signalling and anti-viral responses in COVID-19 ARDS neutrophils
including 2’,5’-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) proteins which activate RNase L (Figure 7A),
Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 2-alpha Kinase 2 (EIF2AK) which inhibits viral
transcription (Figure 7B) and the GTP binding Mx proteins which inhibit viral replication
(Figure 7C).

Another important effect of IFN signalling in viral infection is to stimulate antigen presentation
of intracellular (i.e. viral) antigens via the proteosome to alert T-cells to the infected cell.
Analysis of the antigen presentation and processing pathway showed preserved levels of the
immunoproteasome subunits in COVID-19 neutrophils (Figure 7D), but a global increase in
the expression of proteins implicated in immune cell development, regulation, antigen
processing and presentation (Figure 7E). These included a greater copy number of the
Transporter Associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) proteins required for transport into the
endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto class I MHC molecules (Figure 7F), and in class I
MHC molecules themselves (Figure 7G).

ARDS neutrophils and type I interferon stimulated healthy neutrophils have altered
metabolic profiles with enhanced glutamine utilisation
Type I IFNs have been found to drive metabolic adaptations in plasmacytoid dendritic cells
(pDC) with upregulation of fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation promoting pDC
activation in response to Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 9 agonists (41). To address whether
neutrophils have the capacity to adapt their metabolic programs in response to type I IFN or
TLR 7 and 8 activation, blood neutrophils from healthy controls were stimulated in the
presence or absence of resiquimod, IFN and IFN and glycolysis was assessed by
extracellular flux analysis (Figure 8A). Resiquimod induced a significant uplift in glycolysis
and glycolytic capacity, which was partially abrogated by the addition of type I IFNs (Figure
8A). To further characterise the metabolic rewiring in response to type I IFN we undertook
LC-MS quantification of individual metabolic intermediaries. In keeping with the real time
reduction in extracellular acidification rates, IFN treated neutrophils showed a reduced lactate
content (Figure 8B). This was associated with preservation of TCA cycle intermediaires
including citrate, alphaketoglutarate, malate and succinate (Figure 8C) and a significant
increase in the amino acid glutamate (Figure 8D). Together with (U)-13C5 glutamine tracing
into glutamate this would support the ability of neutrophils to substrate switch in response to
exposure to type I IFN (Figure 8E). To address whether this metabolic rewiring was observed
in blood neutrophils isolated from patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS we
undertook LC-MS analysis of freshly isolated cells. In contrast to type I IFN stimulation of
healthy control neutrophils, neutrophils from COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS patients
demonstrated an increase in intracellular levels of free glucose (Figure 8F) while preserving
their lactate content (Figure 8G) and TCA cycle intermediaries (Figure 8H) compared to
healthy control neutrophils, suggesting these cells have equivalent glycolytic flux and TCA
cycle activity. However, in keeping with the capacity of ARDS neutrophils to substrate switch,

glutamate levels were elevated in both COVID-19 and non-COVID ARDS neutrophils (Figure
8I).

Discussion
ARDS continues to result in significant mortality despite considerable research endeavour.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 infection has confounded this, with 10-20% of hospitalised
patients progressing to ARDS (42). Urgent understanding of the immunological features
specific to COVID-19 ARDS is therefore required. Moreover, the pathophysiological
consequences of myeloid dysfunction as determined by scRNA-seq, mass flow cytometry and
blood count studies is as yet unclear, as is the mechanism by which dexamethasone improves
clinical outcomes in COVID-19 ARDS (14, 40, 43, 44). We therefore employed flow
cytometry and mass spectrometry to characterise disease specific protein and metabolite
signatures in ARDS neutrophil populations and explored their functional implications. Using
this approach, we identify that the expansion of low density and normal density neutrophil
populations previously observed in COVID-19 is also observed in non-COVID-19 ARDS.
Whilst total cell counts are retained in patients receiving dexamethasone therapy, we report an
associated contraction of immature LDN neutrophil populations. It will be important to
understand moving forwards whether a key therapeutic effect of dexamethasone is the
suppression of acute myelopoiesis in response to infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Proteomic survey also allowed us to highlight key processes, including activation of type I IFN
responses that are distinct to COVID-19 ARDS, but more notably, processes not previously
detected by scRNA-seq including platelet degranulation and the expression of proteins
implicated in immune cell development, regulation, antigen processing and presentation.

Importantly, these protein signatures were observed within mature NDN, suggesting this not
to be a consequence of disordered myelopoiesis. It is interesting to note that MCM proteins,
that are responsible for the separation of DNA and as such are conventionally associated with
DNA replication, were enriched in both COVID-19 ARDS and non-COVID-19 ARDS. In the
context of neutrophils, a terminally differentiated cell, this may hint to processes involved in
the unravelling of DNA for NET formation rather than cell cycle control and serves as an
interesting concept for further exploration.

A striking clinical divergence between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS is the
prominence of micro and macrovascular thrombosis in COVID-19 ARDS. Here, we report
proteomic signatures indicative of platelet degranulation and clotting cascade activation. These
observations together with evidence of neutrophil platelet binding, extend the previously
reported contribution of neutrophils to the pathogenesis of immune clot formation through the
release of NETs to one of TLR mediated neutrophil activation and the formation of neutrophil
platelet aggregates. It is interesting to note that it is the neutrophils within the low density layer
we observe by confocal microscopy to bind to platelets and to be associated with the
upregulating the Mac-1 platelet binding complex in COVID-19 ARDS. Further work will be
required to understand whether LDN also demonstrate a propensity for NETs formation, and
whether these aggregates, previously reported in the lung tissue at post-mortem, impair
neutrophil transmigration and directly contribute to vascular damage and to the formation of
microthrombi (17-19). It will also be important to dissect whether the uplift in expression of
proteins associated with fibrin clot formation in COVID-19 ARDS is consequent upon intrinsic
neutrophil expression of these proteins, neutrophil processing of platelet proteins or reflective
of adherent platelets contributing to the protein signatures of the circulating neutrophil
populations.

The importance of neutrophil activation of type I IFN signalling pathways in COVID-19 ARDS
also requires further consideration given the disconnect between tissue injury and viral
detection (45). The ability of neutrophils to cross-present exogenous antigens to CD8+ T cells
has previously been reported and is highly relevant for T cell priming in vivo (46). This may
be particularly relevant in a disease where early CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses against
SARS-CoV-2 are thought to be protective (47, 48), but late responses are associated with
damaging inflammation (48-51). Whilst activation of anti-viral responses including class I
MHC antigen presentation would therefore appear beneficial with respect to viral control, if
this is associated with a hyper-inflammatory neutrophil phenotype and delayed T cell
activation, the net consequence could be persistent tissue injury. In this regard, we would
predict that inappropriate degranulation of neutrophils in the circulation would be highly
damaging and cause wide-spread inflammation within the microvasculature where neutrophils
are known to be sequestered. Our evidence of expanded neutrophil numbers together with
increased neutrophil activation and degranulation confirmed by the detection of plasma
neutrophil granule proteins in patients with COVID-19 ARDS and TLR-agonist in vitro assays
would support this concept of a hyper-inflammatory, damaging circulating innate response.
These pro-thrombotic hyperinflammatory neutrophil protein signatures would appear to be
retained in patients with COVID-19 ARDS receiving dexamethasone therapy. This is perhaps
not surprising given the paucity of evidence for the impact of corticosteroids on neutrophilic
inflammation, highlighting the need for additional therapeutic strategies.

Finally, the mechanism by which type I IFN regulates neutrophil behaviour remains to be fully
elucidated. In pDC, TLR 9 mediated activation is dependent upon autocrine production of type
I IFNs and an increase in oxidative metabolism (41). Neutrophils are unique in their reliance

on non-oxidative metabolism for ATP production, even when oxygen is freely available. It is
therefore of interest that in response to IFN and IFN, neutrophils rewire their metabolic
programme by reducing their glycolytic potential. Together with an increase in detectable
levels of glutamate in neutrophils isolated from patients with COVID-19 ARDS, and existing
evidence that neutrophils can undergo gluconeogenesis (52), this raises the interesting
possibility that ARDS neutrophils re-wire their metabolic processes to facilitate ongoing
inflammatory responses which may be detrimental to the host. Future work will be required to
better understand whether these metabolic changes potentiate anti-viral and pro-inflammatory
innate immune responses following viral challenge. Of interest small molecules already exist
for targeting glutamine utilisation and have been trialled in the cancer setting, raising the
possibility of metabolic drug repurposing for the treatment of COVID-19 (53).

In summary, using mass spectrometry we describe pathophysiological protein and metabolic
neutrophil signatures that are common to ARDS and those distinct to COVID-19 ARDS. We
identify a type I IFN response in COVID-19 ARDS neutrophils which is associated with
metabolic rewiring, neutrophil degranulation and the formation of neutrophil platelet
aggregates in the blood which persist irrespective of dexamethasone treatment. A clear
limitation of this study is the relatively small number of patients recruited. This is balanced
against the detailed analysis we have been able to perform in these patient groups and the move
towards functional dissection of neutrophil responses not previously captured in transcriptional
data sets.

Further understanding of the mechanisms which regulate aberrant neutrophil

responses will likely be important in developing strategies to target the innate responses
following infection with SARS-CoV-2 to enable an effective therapeutic arsenal for COVID19 ARDS.

controls (HC, n = 4), non-COVID-19 ARDS (NA, n = 6) and COVID-19 ARDS (CA, n = 7,
open circles depicting dexamethasone-treated patients) patients determined by proteomic
analysis. Data are mean ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, determined by one-way
ANOVA and Holm-Sidak’s post hoc-testing. (B) Copy numbers of EIF2AK in the same
samples described in (A). Data are mean ± SD. *p < 0.05, determined by Kruskal-Wallis and
Dunn’s post hoc-testing. (C) Copy numbers of Mx proteins in the same samples described in
(A). Data are mean ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, determined by one-way ANOVA and HolmSidak’s post hoc-testing. (D) Copy numbers of PSMB proteins in the same samples described
in (A). Data are mean ± SD. (E) Volcano plots (left) obtained from proteomic survey of normal
density neutrophils (NDN) isolated from the samples described in (A) including a selection of
proteins implicated in antigen processing and presentation and interferon signalling
(GO:0002376) highlighted in red and with some of them labelled as illustrative examples.
Refer to methods section for details. Proteins with a P value <0.05 (horizontal dashed lines),
fold change >2 (outer vertical dashed lines) and a copy number >200 in at least one condition
after Linear Models for Microarray data analysis were considered as significantly different in
the comparisons CA vs HC (top) and NA vs HC (bottom). Table (right) includes a selection of
proteins from the samples described in (A) involved in antigen processing and presentation or
interferon signalling which significantly change in abundance in CA vs. HC (>2 fold change,
p<0.05). Proteins highlighted in red show a COVID-19 specific signature and did not
significantly change in non-COVID-19 ARDS alone. Mean copy numbers are shown. (F) Copy
numbers of Transporter Associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) proteins in the same
samples described in (A). For TAP-1, data are mean ± SD. **p < 0.01, determined by one-way
ANOVA and Holm-Sidak’s post hoc-testing. For TAP-2, data are mean ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p
< 0.01, determined by Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s post hoc-testing. (G) Copy numbers of
