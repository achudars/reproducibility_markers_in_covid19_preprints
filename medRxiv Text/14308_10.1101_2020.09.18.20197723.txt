Abstract
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been damaging our daily life after declaration of pandemic.
Therefore, we have started studying on the characteristics of Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model to know
about the truth of infectious disease and our future.
After detailed studies on the characteristics of the SIR model for the various parameter dependencies with respect to
such as the outing restriction (lockdown) ratio and vaccination rate, we have finally noticed that the second term
(isolation term) in the differential equation of the number of the infected is quite similar to the "helium ash particle loss
term" in deuterium-tritium (D-T) nuclear fusion. Based on this analogy, we have found that isolation of the infected
is not actively controlled in the SIR model. Then we introduce the isolation time control parameter q and have
studied its effect on this pandemic. Required isolation time to terminate the COVID-19 can be estimated by this
proposed method.
To show this isolation control effect, we choose Tokyo for the model calculation because of high population density.
We determine the reproduction number and the isolation ratio in the initial uncontrolled phase, and then the future
number of the infected is estimated under various conditions. If the confirmed case can be isolated in 3~8 days by
widely performed testing, this pandemic could be suppressed without awaiting vaccination. If the mild outing
restriction and vaccination are taken together, the isolation control time can be longer. We consider this isolation time
control might be the only solution to overcome the pandemic when vaccine is not available.

1. Introduction
	 
Since the Wuhan pneumonia in this Jan. 20 in China,
was reported, we have been studying the COVID-19
infection using SIR model. Then, we have noticed the
second equation (the quarantine term) used in the SIR
mode is quite similar to the 4He ash particle balance
equation in the nuclear fusion research [1]. By this
analogy, we have found that the time in the isolation
term can be interpreted as the natural isolation, which
means that the isolation is not conducted in a controlled
manner in a traditional SIR model. This fact inspired us
how to suppress this infectious disease. We show that it
is possible to calculate the required isolation time (from
infection to isolation) to suppress the COVID-19.
In this paper we have chosen Tokyo with large
population where might be suitable to apply the SIR
model. The future number of the infected is estimated
with various conditions with the outing restriction ratio
and isolation time control parameters.
When the
infected people are identified by massive testing and then
quickly isolated from the society, the infectious disease
could be terminated.

2. Estimation of the future number of infection
in Tokyo based on SIR model	  	 
	  	  In this paper we have used the traditional SIR
model [2][3]. In this model we interpret the isolation
term using the analogy from the nuclear fusion research,
providing the new insight into this field. SIR model
equations are given by 	  	 
⎧ dS
= −S(t) β I (t)
⎪ dt
⎪
⎪ dI
⎨ = S(t) β I (t) − γ I (t)
⎪ dt
⎪ dR = γ I (t)

(3)

where S is the susceptible fraction，I is the infectious
fraction and R is the recovered fraction which is the sum
of the death toll and recovered. β is the infection rate per
day and γ is the isolation ratio or the recovered rate per
day.
The second term in the right-hand side of Eq. (2) is
called the isolation term or quarantine term, and it can be
also expressed by
	  	  	  dI = S(t) β I(t) − I(t)

where τ has the dimension of time expressing the
averaged lifetime of the infectious disease. This is also
interpreted that an infected person is finally removed

similar to the "4He ash particle loss term" used in a
"nuclear fusion research" [1]. This loss time is called the
"particle confinement time" in a nuclear fusion, and
expresses the average time for 4He particle to escape
from the confined plasma. This analogy inspired us to
consider how to terminate the COVID-19 pandemic.
Detailed explanations on this analogy will be described
in the Appendix. If the isolation can be quickly
conducted within a short time, isolation term is increased,
and then the number of infected people would be
reduced. This is because the contact time with infected
people can be shortened.
	 
In this SIR model, the total population is constant as
N(t) = S(t)+I(t)+R(t) = constant by adding Eqs.(1)-(3).
Therefore, we have calculated the number of the infected
in Tokyo because of a constant population in a short time.
To solve the SIR model, the initial value is set to S(0)=1,
R(0)=0 and I(0)=given. We also note that this traditional
SIR model assumes the permanent immunity.
	 
Using the effective reproduction number defined by
Reff= βS(t)/γ, Eq.(2) can be written as dI/dt = γ (Reff -1)I.
As the basic reproduction number Ro= β/γ is for the
initial value of S(0)=1, Reff=S(t)Ro holds. We see that
the number of the infected people increases for Reff＞1
and decreases for Reff<1, where Reff expresses the
positive or negative value corresponding to the
derivative dI/dt. Reff only shows the tendency at the
present time slice.
2.1. First phase

Table 1
	  Data of COVID-19 patients in Tokyo (April 17, 2020)
[4]
Population: 14 millions,	  	 
Confirmed cases per day：206 persons
Total cumulative recovered: 122
Cumulative death toll: 63	  	 
Cumulative discharged persons from the hospital：52	 
Although we need parameters β, γ and then the
basic reproduction number Ro, it is difficult to determine
γ by Eq.(3) because data is not enough and not smooth
in this case. As the basic reproduction number is
reported to be 2 to 3 by recent research [5], we have used
this range of value. As the main purpose of this paper
is to estimate the isolation time and not to analyze the
present situation in detail, the recovery time is most
important. Therefore, we surveyed the recovery time
using the cumulative number of the confirmed case and
discharged case from the hospital as shown in Fig. 1-(a).
The time difference between two curves is considered to
be nearly the recovery time, which is less than 20 days.
As Eq. (2-2) provides the number of the infected,
γ and Ro are chosen by the trial and error to fit with the
infection data as shown in Fig.1-(b). Then we have
employed Ro=2.9 as given by Liu et al. [6], and γ=0.057
corresponding to the recovery time τ=17.54 days less
than 20 days, which provide the coefficients	 β = 0.1653.

	 
We divided the calculated time ranges into the first
phase and second phase in the following. The first
phase starts on May 1, 2020 in this study and may not be
affected by any governmental control measures. As the
Day 48 from the start (April 17, 2020) provides the
largest number of the infected per day, the two days later
(Day 50) was taken as the first day of the second phase.
The first phase is given by the following traditional
SIR model expressed by the basic reproduction number
Ro as 	 
⎧ dS
= −S(t) β I (t)= −S(t) Roγ I (t)
⎪ dt
⎨
⎪ dI = S(t) β I (t) − γ I (t) = S(t) Roγ I (t) − γ I (t)
⎩ dt

(1 − 2)
(2 − 2)

As Eq. (3) is the same as the second term in Eq.(2-2)
with the inverse sign, we do not write down it in the
following for simplicity. Here the only one infected
person is assumed as the initial value I(0)=
1/14,000,000=7.14286 x10-8 and S(0)=1 for the
population of Tokyo 14,000,000 as given in Table 1.
We calculate the fraction of S, I and R, and multiply the
population to obtain the final value. Above
simultaneous equation has been solved by Mathematica
(wolfram research).

2.2.The second phase after the outing
restriction
	  In this work the second phase has started after 12
days from the state of emergencies in Japan (April 7).
After Day 50 we introduce the outing restriction ratio c =
80 % in the SIR model, which means that 20% of the
total population can move freely outside and 80% are
staying home.
This calculation can be done by
employing the basic reproduction number Ro multiplied
by (1-c) [8]. This means that the number of the
susceptible people is reduced by (1-c), namely S(t)(1-c),
and the number of non-susceptible people of S(t)c is
staying home without infection.
With the outing
restriction ratio c, Eqs. (1) and (2) can be written as
⎧ dS
= −S(t) (1 − c ) β I(t)
⎪ dt
⎨
⎪ dI = S(t) (1 − c ) β I(t) − γ I(t) = γ { Reff (1 − c ) − 1} I(t)
⎩ dt

conducted during this period.

(1 − 3)
(2 − 3)

where Reff=βS(t)/γ=S(t)Ro, The calculated results are
shown in Fig. 2 for various outing restriction ratios c.
The initial values in the second phase are taken from the
last one in the first phase. A small number of c is not
effective at all to reduce infection. A large number, such
as c=0.8, can reduce the number of the infected
substantially, but it takes two months (June 18, 2020) to
reduce down to 50 persons per day, and four months
down to 10 persons per day.
On the other hand, if c=0.7 is taken it will take 200
days to reduce down to 50 persons per day. If c=0.65 is
taken, the number of infected per day is not reduced and
constant. This value can be derived by the condition of
Ro(1-c) =1 obtained by dI/dt=0 and S(t)~1 in Eq. (2-3),
providing c=1-1/Ro=1-1/2.9 =0.655. When c=0.6 is
chosen, the number of the infected is increasing as
shown in Fig.2-(a) We should note that the variation of
the outing restriction leads to the large difference in the
number of the infected.
We added the data until July 9, 2020 to compare it
with the actual situation as shown in Fig.2-(b). At the
first glance, the state of emergency was so effective to
reduce the infection. The actual number of the infected is
much smaller than the curve of c=0.8 and 0.9 near the
end of the state of emergency. This is because we
assume the outing restriction is imposed on only the
susceptible people and the infected patients are free to
move. As the outing of the infected patients is also
limited, the first term in Eq.(2-3) should be S(t)(1-c)2βI(t)
for the assumption of the same outing restriction ratio.
Therefore, the outing restriction of c=0.8 actually
corresponds to c2=1-(1-0.8)2= 0.96 if we transform the
form (1-c)2 to (1-c2). Although larger value of c=0.8 is
proposed by committee, larger value of c2=0.96 was
achieved in an actual situation. This estimation can be
justified by the two-body collision theory as also used in
nuclear fusion research [1], corresponding to the first
term in Eq.(A-1) in Appendix. But the red curve with
c2=0.96 is still higher than the actual values. Therefore,
we increased the isolation ratio from γ=0.057 (red line)
to γ=0.09 (blue line), providing the reasonable fit. The
larger isolation ratio could be justified by active isolation

infected for various outing restriction ratios in the second
phase during and after the state of emergency. Green line

April 20, 2020, and (b) calculated at July 10, 2020.
Note that red lines show the cases of the isolation ratio of
γ=0.057 (Ro=2.9) and a blue line γ=0.09 (Ro=1.83). 	 
It is criticized that polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
testing is not fully conducted to find the COVID-19
patients in Japan. Therefore, more infected patients are
expected [9]. However, as the purpose of this work is
to see the future tendency and to study the isolation
effect, we use the presently available data without
discussion on this problem.
	 
2.3. The third phase with the second wave
	  	 	 Even after the first wave is over, some portion of
infected people still exit. Therefore, the infected patient
would be increased again as long as outing restriction is
lifted up. We predict the number of the infected as a
function of the outing restriction ratio in the third phase
that started after 100 days.
	 	 	 	 In this calculation, the outing restriction ratio in the
second phase (50 to 100 days) is assumed as c=0.9. In
Fig. 3-(a), the numbers of the infected in the third phase
are shown for c=0.5 to 0.8. When the outing restriction
is set to c=0.5, it increases again up to 200 infected
people per day in September. For c=0.6, it increases to

the same level by the end of 2020.
	  However, when the outing restriction ratio is given
by c=0.65, the number of the infected per days becomes
constant. Of course, when c=0.7 or 0.8 are maintained,
it will be decreased as seen in Fig. 3-(a). Therefore, to
keep the infection number low, the outing restriction
ratio should be larger than c=0.65. However, it might
be very difficult to maintain such a strong measure from
a viewpoint of economy.
When no more restriction is set, the number of
infected people rapidly increases as in the first wave.
The strong restriction can again suppress the number of
the infected. The oscillatory situation can be seen in the
report [10]. Therefore, in Tokyo after the state of
emergency was lifted up on May 25, 2020, the number of
the infected slowly increased as shown in Fig.3-(b). On
July 10, 243 persons were confirmed as positive. To
estimate the level of outing restriction without the state
of emergency, we calculated that the third phase started
at Day 90 (21 infected people) and fitted data with
curves with c=0 to 0.3 as shown in Fig.3-(b). The
isolation ratio of γ=0.09 (the blue line) is assumed in the
third phase because the time difference between the
confirmed and discharged date from the hospital is
almost 11 days after Day 80, which is obtained by the
same method as shown in Fig. 1-(b).
As the cases of
c=0.1 ~ 0.25 are almost the best fitting curves, the new
way of life under the condition without outing restriction,
such as mask wearing, hand washing, and social
distancing, may be providing this value. We note if the
smaller isolation ratio of γ=0.057 is taken, c is further
increased as c=0.3 ~ 0.35. We note that the initial value
of the number of patients at Day 90 sensitively
determines the subsequent number of the infected
people.

3. SIR model with outing restriction, vaccination
and isolation control	 
	  To avoid an outing restriction or lockdown, it is clear
that we need to have vaccination. However, to obtain
safe vaccine, we have to wait for it. Therefore, we have
to manage to keep the number of the infected as low as
possible although it is not good for the testing the effect
of vaccine.
In this section, we propose the
comprehensive SIR model to unify the outing restriction,
vaccination and isolation together, and show their
equivalent relationship.
3.1. Outing restriction and vaccination
	  	 We show in Fig. 4 how we can consider the SIR
epidemic curve when the outing restriction and
vaccination are taken into account. 	 
	  	 Figure 4-(a) corresponds to no restriction case on the
human behavior. The basic reproduction number is
Ro=2.9 as in section 2.1. Figure 4-(b) shows the case of
40 % outing restriction (c=0.4). The number of the
susceptible people S(t)(1-c) with free movement is
reduced by the outing restriction, and the rest of them
S(t)c are staying home. As the horizontal line is given
by the initial susceptible number S(0)(1-c), the epidemic
curve exists below this line.
As the effective
reproduction number is Reff = Ro(1- c) = 1.74 for S(t)~1
in this case, the peak fraction of the infected I(t) would
be delayed and reduced.
	 	 	 When the susceptible people have vaccination with
the ratio of v, SIR model equations are given by

⎧ dS
= −S(t) (1 − v ) β I(t)
⎪ dt
⎨
⎪ dI = S(t) (1 − v ) β I(t) − γ I(t)

and result is shown in Fig.4-(d) for the vaccination ratio
of v=0.3 and the outing restriction ratio of c=0.15. We
do see that the infected people appear earlier without any
restriction, and later with restrictions.
We show the various SIR curves in Fig. 5 to see
the effect of the outing restriction ratio. When the
outing restriction ratio c is increased, it is seen that the
peak fraction of the infected is reduced and delayed.
	  	  	 

Fig 6 for S(t)~1. When the vaccination ratio increases,
the outing restriction ratio can be relaxed. Of course
this depends on the basic reproduction number as seen in
Fig. 6.	 	 In the case of large basic reproduction number,
the vaccination ratio should be large, because infectious
disease is more transmissive. So called "herd
immunity" holds for vaccination ratio over ~50 %
without the outing restriction as shown in Fig. 6.
However, the herd immunity strategy is quite dangerous
because a lot of people are infected and then the death
toll will be increased, and also it is not clear yet whether
the antibody can last longer or not for COVID-19. We
note that if the new way of life with c=0.1~0.25 is
maintained as shown in Fig.3-(b), herd immunity could
be established with the vaccination ratio larger than
30 %.
At present as we have no effective and safe vaccine,
how we can suppress this COVID-19 without outing
restriction or lockdown. We seek such a solution based
on SIR model.

The condition to reduce the infected case is given
by the effective reproduction number less than 1 as
Reff=S(t)Ro(1-c)(1-v) ≤ 1 when both the outing restriction
and vaccination are taken into account. Hence, we have
the relationship: c ≥ 1-1/{S(t)Ro(1-v)} which is shown in

3.2. Isolation ratio γ
	 
The number of the infected people depends on the
isolation coefficient γ. This value γ was determined in
the first phase where any control measures were not
taken yet. Here to know how the number of the
infected is increased, we have calculated the first term
(solid curve) and the second term (dotted curve) in Eq.
(2) for various isolation coefficients γ as shown in Fig. 7.
When the isolation coefficient is as small as γ = 0.04, the
peak value of the infected people βS(t)I(t) is much larger
than the one of the second term γI(t). We see that the
second term is delayed from the first term. Therefore,
the infected people are increased. For example, γ =
0.057 has been used in the analysis for Tokyo as shown
in Figs. 1, 2 and 3.
On the other hand, for the larger isolation
coefficient as γ= 0.12, the difference of their peaks is
small and their time delay becomes shorter with the
isolation ratio. In other word, the first term and second
term become comparable. This means that the number
of the infected is not increased if the isolation is taken as
soon as the case is confirmed. This is also interpreted
as follows. As the basic reproduction number is given by
Ro = β/γ, the large isolation coefficient γ provides the
smaller Ro, reducing the number of infected people.

in this case . This leads to the following linear
approximation in the case of q <<1 as
Reff =

β S(t)
β S(t) (1 − q )
~
γ (1 + q )
γ

(5)

This is exactly the same expression with the outing
restriction ratio of q. We have thus found that there is
the equivalence between outing restriction (lockdown)
and isolation in Eq. (2) in SIR model. However, this
holds only for the small value of q less than 1.
If we introduce the isolation term as
	  	  dI = S(t) β I(t) − I(t) 	 
dt
τ (1 − q )

（2-6）

it can be used for the large value close to q = 1. This
provides the effective reproduction number
Reff=βS(t)/γ = βS(t)τ (1-q)= S(t)Ro (1-q) with Ro= βτ.
The large q value provides the smaller effective
reproduction number. This situation is shown in Fig. 8.
During this recovering time, patient is infectious but not
actually isolated from the susceptible space so far in the
traditional SIR model. By introduction of the isolation
time control parameter q, we can artificially control this
infectious time.

isolation time control proposed in this work.

second term in Eq.(2) for various isolation ratios
	 
3.3. Equivalence between outing restriction and
isolation in SIR model
	  Outing restriction (or lockdown) causes the large
economical loss. Therefore, we should consider how
this epidemic could be overcome without vaccine and
outing restriction.
When the outing restriction ratio of c is imposed, the
effective reproduction number is given from Eq. (2-3) as
Reff=βS(t)(1-c)/γ. On the other hand, when the excess
isolation q takes place (no infected person is isolated by
testing error), we can use γ(1+q) as the isolation term
coefficient. The effective reproduction number is given
by
Reff =

β S(t)
γ (1 + q )

(4)

Isolation control has the same effect as the outing
restriction. To confirm this, we calculated the second
phase using the isolation time control by changing q
from 0.2 to 0.8 as shown in Fig.9. The number of the
infected actually decreases with the isolation time
control parameter q as the outing restriction case. The
required isolation times τγ =τ(1-q) are also shown in the
parenthesis for each q. It is seen that 3 to 5 days are
necessary to reduce the number of the infected to the
small value. The horizontal line is obtained when
Ro(1-q)=1 is satisfied, namely q=0.65 for Ro=2.9, which
agrees with the numerical one. If the isolation time
control parameter q is larger this value, the number of
the infected decreases.
The required isolation time can be longer when the
outing restriction is imposed at the same time as will be
seen in the next section. The required isolation time
thus obtained becomes quite reasonable. If isolation

isolation time control
When the outing restriction is imposed at the same
time, isolation control is relaxed. The isolation time
can be longer than that with isolation control alone.
Equation (2-6) can be written in this case as 	 
	 

dI
I(t)
= S(t) (1 − c ) β I(t) −
dt
τ (1 − q )

Fig. 10 Dependencies of the number of the infected on
isolation time control parameters q with the outing
restriction of c=0.3. (τγ= τ (1- q) and τ =17.54 days).
	 
To compare the case without the outing restriction
in the third phase, the same condition is used except for
c=0. To suppress the infectious disease it is necessary
to isolate the infected people within 5.2 days (q=0.7)
without the outing restriction as shown in Fig. 11.
However, with the outing restriction ratio of c=0.3, 7.8
days (q=0.55) is enough to suppress (Fig. 10). Thus we
have found that it is easier to suppress the infectious
disease by isolation control if the mild outing restriction
is imposed at the same time.
	  	 

(2-7)

and the effective reproduction number is given by
Reff=βS(t)/γ = S(t)Ro(1-c) (1-q). This means that the
outing restriction is equivalent to the isolation control.
For example, as the outing restriction ratio of c = 0.3 and
isolation time control parameter of q = 0.7 provides
(1-c)(1-q)= 0.7ｘ0.3~0.21, which is almost the same as
the outing restriction ratio of c = 0.8.
Long term prediction until the end of 2020,
corresponding to Fig. 3, is conducted for various
isolation time control parameters of q=0.5 to 0.7.
Results are shown in Fig.10 in the third phase, how the
number of the infected is controlled by the isolation time
control parameter together with the outing restriction of
c=0.3, corresponding to the parameters in the new way
of life as shown in Fig.3-(b).
	  	 	 For q=0.55, the number of the infected is reduced to
3 persons per day at the end of 2020. For the case of
q=0.7, the number of the infected is 0.6 person after 50
days. Thus we have found that the longer isolation time
is permitted when outing restriction is imposed at the
same time, which could be called the combined control.
The condition of the flat curve in the third phase
given by S(t)Ro(1-c)(1-q) =1 provides q=1-1/{Ro(1-c)} =
0.50 for S(t)~1, Ro=2.9 and c=0.3 as shown in Fig.10.

Fig. 11 Dependencies of the number of the infected on
isolation time control parameters without the outing
restriction c=0. (τγ= τ (1- q) and τ =17.54 days).
	  When peoples have vaccination with outing restriction,
Eq. (2-7) is finally given by
	  	  dI = S(t) (1 − c ) (1 − v ) β I(t) − I(t)
dt
τ (1 − q )

(2-8)

and the effective reproduction number is given by Reff=
S(t)Ro(1-c) (1-v) (1-q). The vaccination ratio of v = 0.3
provides the same effect with the outing restriction ratio
of c=0.3. Therefore, by vaccination ratio of v=0.3, it is
possible to suppress this infection disease within 2020 by
the isolation time control parameter with q > 0.55
(isolation within 7 days) as shown in Fig.10 without
outing restriction. Thus, not to affect the daily life and
social economy, this isolation time control strategy is a
hopeful solution.
4.Discussions and summary
	  We have noticed the interesting papers on the
effectiveness of isolation and quarantine to overcome
infectious disease [11]. We have used the word

"isolation" as used in the reference [12]. Accurate data
on viral load with respect to the time from infection as
shown in the reference [13][14]. could improve the
estimation proposed in this work.
Because only
average time has been used in this work. However,
such work is beyond this paper.
Big problem in this COVID-19 is that there are a lot
of asymptomatic but infectious cases [15][16]. Therefore,
active and massive testing is so important for quick
isolation of the identified person. Such technology has
been under active development. For example, recently
the new method is invented by TakaraBio in USA to
allow faster and larger scale PCR testing, where 5,000
tests can be done in about two hours [17]. As the
National Institute of Health is aiming at the 6 million
PCR tests per day, such aggressive research plan is
promising to suppress this pandemic [18]. Recently,
innovative technique such as vocal biomarkers is
proposed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory to identify the
asymptomatic people with COVID-19 positive [19].
Vocal change before and after infection could be
detected by processing speech recording. In addition,
contact-tracing technique using communication tool is
also useful [13].
	  	  There is a well known method to survey the
COVID-19 spread in the country with the small capacity
of the PCR testing resources. As swage surveillance
successfully used for monitoring Polio [20], it might be
an effective method to detect the COVID-19 infected
peoples in the restricted area within the swage network
[21]-[24]. As it can find the COVID-19 positive without
time delay, the actual COVID-19 spread in that area is
provided. If the peoples living in such area are tested by
group PCR testing, it can reduce the PCR testing
resources and shorten the isolation time. Therefore,
such swage water monitoring system should be
constructed for monitoring the spread of COVID-19
infection to terminate this pandemic. It might be also
useful for future unknown infectious diseases.
Research on the detector dog is also very interesting
to identify the COVID-19 patients. As reported in the
papers [25][26], the trained dog can distinguish the
COVID-19 patient by their scent. Average detection rate
is reported to be 94 % [25]. Therefore, this method
might be very useful in mass gathering events and airport
where quick and massive PCR testing is required.
Various new ideas and wisdom as discussed above
should be taken up seriously to overcome this pandemic.
	  	 To know the truth of infectious disease, we have
studied the characteristics of SIR model equation in
detail. Based on the 4He ash removal study in a D-T
nuclear fusion [1], we have found that the time in the
isolation term can be interpreted as the natural isolation
time, which means that the isolation is not conducted in a
controlled manner in a traditional SIR model.
Therefore, we introduce the isolation time control
parameter q to control the isolation time. We have finally
found that the outing restriction ratio c, the vaccination
rate v, and the isolation time control parameter q are
equivalent with respect to the basic reproduction number.
This means that isolation control has the same function
of vaccination or the outing restriction. In an actual

situation especially after the first wave when the number
of patient decreases, massive PCR testing etc should be
conducted and then infected people especially without
symptom should be identified and isolated as soon as
possible. We have to construct such an advanced social
system with great care about human rights. Without
such system, the economic activity cannot be maintained
unless a safe vaccine is not supplied.
In this study, the required isolation time is 3 ~ 5
days without any outing restriction, but it can be longer
as 5 ~ 8 days with the outing restriction of c=0.3 to
suppress this COVID-19. We note that this value is
obtained by the new way of life as shown in Fig.3-(b).
Although this isolation time depends on the basic
reproduction number, the required isolation time
obtained in this study is quite realistic and could be
accomplished. Above estimated time could be also
justified by the fact that the median duration of viral
shedding in the asymptomatic group is 19 days [16]. This
value is quite similar to our employed value of infectious
period or recovery time τ =17.54 days. This isolation
time control concept may be able to explain the success
in Taiwan, New Zealand and Mainland China to
suppress COVID-19 disease.
In conclusion, with reliable, simple and massive
testing method, if isolation can be done in a short time
after case identification, this pandemic could be
overcome without the strong outing restriction such as
lockdown before vaccine is completed.
Medical research institutes and pharmaceutical
companies are actively developing the vaccine to curtail
this pandemic. In contrast, only the central and local
governments can do wide, repeated and quick
COVID-19 testing and quick isolation. The bureaucratic
system such as the public health center and the ministry
of health can play an important role to manage the
isolation time control together with various laws. Upon
considering this simple theory proposed here, we believe
government should be definitely a main player to
terminate this infectious disease.

D + T ->４He (3.5 MeV) + n (14.7 MeV)
Here high energy alpha particles (4He particle) should be
removed from the D-T plasmas after losing their energy
to the surrounding D-T plasmas. This 4He particle can
be expressed by the particle balance equation given by
[Eq.(3) in the Ref. [1]]
dnHe
= σV
dt

DT

nD nT −

nHe
τ He

（A-1）

The first term shows the 4He production term by D-T
nuclear reactions, where nD is the deuterium, density, nT
is the tritium density, <σV>DT is the D-T fusion rate, σ is
the cross section of the D-T fusion and V is the relative
velocity between D and T particles. This term is also
analogous to the first term in Eq. (2) in the SIR model,
which expresses the collision (close contact) between the
susceptible and infective persons.
The second term expresses the 4He particle escaping
from the plasma. Escaping time is τHe in an average as
shown in Fig.A. This term is exactly the same as the
isolation term in SIR model equation (2). This can be
interpreted as that the infected person goes out to the
isolation space after τγ.	 During this infectious time the
infected persons moves freely. The infected people is not
isolated immediately after infection as this He ash.

Fig. A

He ash exhaust in a D-T fusion plasma

	  We have long been studying how we can exhaust
these 4He ash particles quickly from the fusion plasma
such as in tokamak and helical reactors. We have
noticed that especially in an advanced fusion reactor
such as neutron lean fusion reactor, exhaust of ash
particles are crucially important [27].	  The particle
confinement time in the second term should be as short
as possible to build a fusion reactor. This fusion
concept is the quite similar to the epidemic strategy to
maintain the economic activity by isolating the infected
people quickly.
