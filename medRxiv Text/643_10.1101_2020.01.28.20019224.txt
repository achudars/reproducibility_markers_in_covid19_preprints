Abstract
Traveller screening is being used to limit further global spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV)
following its recent emergence. Here, we project the impact of different travel screening
programs given remaining uncertainty around the values of key nCoV life history and
epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will
miss more than half of infected travellers. Breaking down the factors leading to screening
successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally
undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were
exposed. These findings emphasize the need for measures to track travellers who become ill
after being missed by a travel screening program. We make our model available for interactive
use so stakeholders can explore scenarios of interest using the most up-to-date information. We
hope these findings contribute to evidence-based policy to combat the spread of nCoV, and to
prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.
Introduction
As of January 28, 2020, the novel 2019 coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak has been intensifying
rapidly in China, and has demonstrated potential for international spread. Many jurisdictions
have imposed traveller screening and other travel restrictions (World Health Organization,
2020). It is widely recognized that screening measures are imperfect barriers to spread (Bitar et
al., 2009; Gostic et al., 2015; Mabey et al., 2014), due to: the absence of detectable symptoms
during the incubation period; variation in the severity and detectability of symptoms once the
disease begins to progress; imperfect performance of screening equipment or personnel; or
active evasion of screening by travellers. Previously we estimated the effectiveness of traveller
screening for a range of pathogens that have emerged in the past, and found that arrival
screening would miss 50–75% of infected cases even under optimistic assumptions (Gostic et
al., 2015). Yet the quantitative performance of different policies matters for planning
interventions and will influence how public health authorities prioritize different measures as the
international and domestic context changes. Here we use a mathematical model to analyse the
expected performance of different screening measures for nCoV, based on what is currently
known about its natural history and epidemiology and on different possible combinations of
departure and arrival screening policies.

Our previous analysis considered the contributions of both departure and arrival screening
programs, focusing on the context of international spread of infections via air travel. In the
current context of the nCoV outbreak, both departure and arrival screening have been proposed
and implemented in some countries, though neither approach is likely to be applied uniformly to
all air travellers. Traveller screening is also being applied in other contexts, including at
roadside spot checks on major routes out of Wuhan. These are directly analogous to departure
screens in our earlier analysis, i.e. one-off screening efforts with no delay due to travel duration.
As of January 28, 2020, the Chinese government has been expanding the geographic area and
modes of transportation subject to strong travel restrictions. If there was perfect compliance and
the restricted area encompassed all areas with community transmission of the virus, then these
measures could in theory eliminate the necessity of wider traveller screening. However,
multiple factors point to on-going risk, including the existence of substantial numbers of cases in
several population centers outside Wuhan (World Health Organization, n.d.), and very early in
the outbreak, reports of citizens seeking to elude the restrictions or leaving before restrictions
were in place. As the virus continues to spread within China, and as cases continue to appear in
other countries, the risk of exportation of cases from beyond the current travel-restricted area is
likely to grow.
As a result, increasing emphasis has been placed on the effectiveness of arrival screening to
prevent importation of cases to areas without established spread. At the same time, there is
great concern about potential public health consequences if nCoV spreads to developing
countries that lack health infrastructure and resources to combat it effectively. Limited
resources also could mean that some countries cannot implement large-scale arrival screening.
In this scenario, departure screening would be the sole barrier -- however leaky -- to importation
of cases into these countries. It is also important to recognize that, owing to the lag time in
appearance of symptoms in imported cases, any weaknesses in screening would continue to
have an effect on case importations for up to two weeks (roughly, the maximum reported
incubation period) after changes in screening policy or epidemic context in the source region.
Accordingly, we consider scenarios with departure screening only, arrival screening only, or
both departure and arrival screening. The model can also consider the consequences when
only a fraction of the traveller population is screened, due either to travel from a location not
subject to screening, or due to deliberate evasion of screening.
The central aim of our analysis is to assess the expected effectiveness of screening for nCoV,
taking account of current knowledge and uncertainties about the natural history and
epidemiology of the virus. We therefore show results using the best estimates currently
available, in the hope of informing policy decisions in this fast-changing environment. We also
make our model available for public use as a user-friendly online app, so that stakeholders can
explore scenarios of particular interest, and results can be updated rapidly as our knowledge of
this new viral threat continues to expand.

Results
Model
The core model has been described previously (Gostic et al., 2015), but to summarize briefly, it
assumes infected travellers can be detained due to the presence of detectable symptoms (fever
or cough), or due to self-reporting of exposure risk via questionnaires or interviews. Before
screening, travellers can be classified into one of four categories: (1) symptomatic and aware
that exposure may have occurred, (2) symptomatic but not aware of exposure risk, (3) aware of
exposure risk but without detectable symptoms, and (4) neither symptomatic nor aware of
exposure risk (Fig. 1). Travellers in the final category are fundamentally undetectable, and
travellers in the third category are only detectable if aware that they have been exposed and
willing to self report.
In the model, screening for symptoms occurs prior to questionnaire-based screening for
exposure risk, and detected cases do not progress to the next stage. This approach allows us to
track the fraction of cases detected using symptom screening or risk screening at arrival or
departure. Additionally, the model keeps track of four ways in which screening can miss infected
travellers: (1) due to imperfect sensitivity, symptom screening may fail to detect symptoms in
travellers that display symptoms; (2) questionnaires may fail to detect exposure risk in travellers
aware they have been exposed, owing to deliberate obfuscation or misunderstanding; (3)
screening may fail to detect both symptoms and known exposure risk in travellers who have
both and (4) travellers not exhibiting symptoms and with no knowledge of their exposure are
fundamentally undetectable. Here, we only consider infected travellers who submit to screening.
However, the supplementary app allows users to consider scenarios in which some fraction of
infected travellers intentionally evade screening (Fig. 1E).
Parameters
The probability that an infected traveller is detectable in a fever screen depends on: the
incubation period (the time from exposure to onset of detectable symptoms); the proportion of
subclinical cases (mild cases that never develop detectable symptoms); the sensitivity of
thermal scanners used to detect fever; the fraction of cases aware they have high exposure risk;
and the fraction of those cases who would self-report truthfully on a screening questionnaire.
Further, the distribution of individual times since exposure affects the probability that any single
infected traveller has progressed to the symptomatic stage. In a growing epidemic, the majority
of infected cases will have been recently exposed, and will not yet show symptoms. We used
methods described previously to estimate the distribution of individual times since exposure for
different parameter regimes (Gostic et al., 2015). Briefly, the model assumes the fraction of
cases who are recently exposed increases with R0. The distribution of times since exposure is
truncated at a maximum value, which corresponds epidemiologically to the maximum time from
exposure to patient isolation, after which point we assume cases will not attempt to travel.
(Isolation may occur due to hospitalization, or due to confinement at home in response to
escalating symptoms or nCoV diagnosis).

At the time of this writing, nCoV-specific estimates are available for most of these parameters,
but almost all have been derived from limited or preliminary data sources and remain subject to
considerable uncertainty. Table 1 and the Methods summarize the current state of knowledge.
Here, we used two distinct approaches to incorporate this uncertainty into our analysis.
First, to estimate the probability that an infected individual would be detected or missed (Fig. 2),
we considered a range of plausible values for the mean incubation time, and the fraction of
subclinical cases. We focus on these two parameters because screening outcomes are
particularly sensitive to their values. All other parameters used to generate Fig. 2 were fixed to
the best available estimates listed in Table 1.
Second, we considered a population of infected travellers, each with a unique time of exposure,
and in turn a unique probability of having progressed to the symptomatic stage. Here, the model
used a resampling-based approach to simultaneously consider uncertainty from both (1)
stochasticity in any single individual’s screening outcome, and (2) uncertainty as to the true,
underlying natural history parameters driving the epidemic. Details are provided in the methods,
but briefly, we constructed 1000 plausible parameter sets, drawn using Latin hypercube
sampling from plausible ranges for each parameter (Table 1). Using each parameter set, we
simulated screening outcomes for a population of 100 infected individuals. Fig. 3A shows the
distribution of infected travellers detected per simulation, and Fig. 3B shows the mean fraction
of individuals with each screening outcome from across all simulations.

Individual probabilities of a given screening outcome
Our model outputs the probability of different screening outcomes through time, including the
overall likelihood of detecting the infected traveller and the different contributions to success or
failure. First, we explored the probability that any particular infected individual would be detected
by a screening program, as a function of the time between exposure and the initiation of travel
(Fig. 2). A crucial driver of the effectiveness of traveller screening programs is the duration of
the incubation period, particularly since infected people are most likely to travel before the onset
of symptoms. Here we considered three scenarios with different mean incubation periods: 5.5
days is most consistent with most existing estimates, while 4.5 and 6.5 days provide a
sensitivity analysis roughly consistent with ranges, confidence or credible intervals reported
elsewhere (Backer et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). Even within
the narrow range tested, screening outcomes were sensitive to the incubation period mean. For
longer incubation periods, we found that larger proportions of departing travellers would not yet
be exhibiting symptoms – either at departure or arrival – which in turn reduced the probability
that screening would detect these cases, especially since we assume few infected travellers will
realize they have been exposed to nCov.

A second crucial uncertainty is the proportion of cases that will develop detectable symptoms.
We considered scenarios in which 5%, 25% and 50% of cases are subclinical, representing a
best, middle and worst-case scenario, respectively. The middle and worst-case scenarios have
predictable and discouraging consequences for the effectiveness of traveller screening, since
they render large fractions of the population undetectable by fever screening (Fig. 2).
Furthermore, mild cases who are unaware of their exposure risk are never detectable, by any
means. This is manifested as the bright red ‘undetectable’ region which persists well beyond the
mean incubation period. For a screening program combining departure and arrival screening, as
shown in Fig. 2, the greatest contributor to case detection is the departure fever screen. The
arrival fever screen is the next greatest contributor, with its value arising from two factors: the
potential to detect cases whose symptom onset occurred during travel, and the potential to
catch cases missed due to imperfect instrument sensitivity in non-contact infrared thermal
scanners used in traveller screening (Table 1). Considering the effectiveness of departure or
arrival screening only (Fig 2 - Supplementary figure 1-2), we see that fever screening is the
dominant contributor in each case, but that the risk of missing infected travellers due to
undetected fever is substantially higher when there is no redundancy from two successive
screenings.

Overall screening effectiveness in a population of infected travellers during a growing epidemic
Next we computed population-level estimates of the effectiveness of different screening
programs, as well as the uncertainties arising from the current partial state of knowledge about
this recently-emerged virus. To do so, we modeled plausible population-level outcomes by
tracking the fraction of infected travellers detained, given a growing epidemic and current
uncertainty around parameter values. We separately consider the best, middle and worst-case
scenarios for the proportion of infections that are subclinical, and for each scenario we compare
the impact of departure screening only, arrival screening only, or programs that include both.
The striking finding is that even under the best-case assumptions, with just one infection in
twenty being subclinical and all travellers passing through departure and arrival screening, the
median fraction of infected travellers detected is only 0.34, with 95% interval extending from
0.20 up to 0.50 (Fig. 3A). The total fraction detected is lower for programs with only one layer of
screening, with arrival screening preferable to departure screening owing to the possibility of
symptom onset during travel. Considering higher proportions of subclinical cases, the overall
effectiveness of screening programs is further degraded, with a median of just one in ten
infected travellers detected by departure screening in the worst-case scenario. The key driver of
these poor outcomes is that, even in the best-case scenario, nearly two thirds of infected
travellers will not be detectable (as shown by the red regions in Fig. 3B). This is because in a
growing epidemic, the majority of travellers will have been recently infected and hence will not
yet have progressed to the symptomatic stage, and because we assume that few are aware of
their exposure risk. As above, the dominant contributor to successful detections is fever
screening.

Interactive online app for public use
We have developed an interactive web application using Shiny in which users can replicate our
analyses using parameter inputs that reflect the most up-do-date information. The
supplementary user interface can be accessed at
https://faculty.eeb.ucla.edu/lloydsmith/screeningmodel. Please note that while the results in Fig.
3 consider a range of plausible values for each parameter, the outputs of the Shiny app are
calculated using fixed, user-specified values only.

Discussion
The international expansion of nCoV cases has led to travel screening measures being
proposed and implemented in numerous countries. Given the rapid growth of the epidemic in
China, emphasis on these measures is likely to rise in an attempt to prevent community spread
of the virus in new geographic areas. Using a mathematical model of screening with preliminary
estimates of nCoV epidemiology and natural history, we found that screening will in the best
case only detect less than half of infected travellers. We found that two main factors influenced
the effectiveness of screening. First, symptom screening depends on the natural history of an
infection: individuals are increasingly likely to show detectable symptoms with increasing time
since exposure. A fundamental challenge of screening is that many infected individuals will
travel during their incubation period, a point at which they still feel healthy enough to travel but
are simultaneously most difficult to detect. This effect is amplified when the incubation period is
longer; infected individuals have a longer window in which they may travel with low probability of
detection. Second, screening depends on whether exposure risk factors exist that would
facilitate specific and reasonably sensitive case detection by questionnaire. For nCoV, there is
so far limited evidence for specific risk factors; we therefore assumed that at most 40% of
travellers would be aware of a potential exposure, and that a minority would self-report their
exposure honestly, which led to limited effectiveness in questionnaire-based screening. The
confluence of these two factors led to many infected travellers being fundamentally
undetectable. Even under our most generous assumptions about the natural history of nCoV,
the presence of undetectable travellers made the greatest contribution to screening failure.
Correctable failures, such as missing a traveller with fever or awareness of their exposure risk,
played a more minor role.
There are some limitations to our analysis. Parameter values for nCoV, such as the incubation
period, are based on the limited data currently available. For such parameters, the tail of the
distribution is important for understanding the potential for long delays until symptoms, but the
tails of skewed distributions are notoriously difficult to characterize using limited data. In
general, current parameter estimates may also be affected by bias or censoring, particularly in
the early stages of an outbreak when most cases have been recently infected, and when data
are primarily available for relatively severe, hospitalized cases. Another crucial uncertainty
highlighted by our analysis is the frequency of cases too mild or non-specific to be detected as

nCoV infections. At least one asymptomatic case is known to have occurred in a child (Chan et
al., 2020). Further, children and young adults have been conspicuously underrepresented
among hospitalized cases (Chen et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). The possibility
cannot be ruled out that large numbers of subclinical cases are occurring, especially in young
people. If an age-by-severity interaction does indeed exist, then the mean age of travellers
should be taken into account when estimating screening effectiveness. Further, transmission
occurred before the onset of symptoms in one recent case report (Rothe et al., 2020). While it is
too early to draw conclusions from a single case report, determining whether pre-symptomatic
transmission is the norm also has major implications for the risk of establishing on-going spread
in new locales .
As country-specific screening policies can change rapidly in real-time, we focused on a general
screening framework rather than specific case studies. We also assumed traveller adherence
and no active evasion of screening. However, there are informal reports of people taking
antipyretics to beat fever screening (Mahbubani, 2020), which would further reduce the
effectiveness of these methods. With travel restrictions in place, individuals may also take
alternative routes (e.g. road rather than air), which would in effect circumvent departure and/or
arrival screening as a control measure. Our quantitative findings may overestimate screening
effectiveness if many travellers evade screening.
Our results have several implications for the design and implementation of control measures.
Arrival screening could delay the introduction of cases if the infection is not yet present (Cowling
et al., 2010), or reduce the initial rate of spread by limiting the number of parallel chains of
transmission initially present in a country. But because screening is inherently leaky, it is crucial
to also have measures in place to identify cases missed at arrival screening. For example,
travellers could be provided with an information card to self-screen and self-report (Public
Health England, n.d.), alongside increased general surveillance/alertness in healthcare settings.
We should not take false confidence from reports that infected travellers are being detected by
existing screening programs. Our findings indicate that for every case detected by travel
screening, one or more infected travellers were not caught, and must be found and isolated by
other means.
The expected high miss rate of screening programs also has implications for assessing when
different programs are worthwhile investments. For areas yet to experience community-based
transmission of the virus, and subject to substantial traveller inflows from affected areas, arrival
screening can delay importation of cases and build awareness among incoming travellers.
Even once there is some early-stage community transmission in a specific location, arrival
screening may still reduce the chance of multiple independent transmission chains and ease the
work of contact tracing teams, although the relative benefit of such screening for overall case
prevention with decline as local transmission increases. Once there is generalized spread which
has outpaced contact tracing, departure screening to prevent export of cases to new areas will
be more valuable than arrival screening to identify additional incoming cases. However the
cost-benefit tradeoff for any screening policy should be assessed in light of past experiences,
where few or no infected travellers have been detected by such programs (Gostic et al., 2015).

Several factors could potentially strengthen the screening measures described here. With
improved efficiency of thermal scanners or other symptom detection technology, we would
expect a smaller difference between the effectiveness of arrival-only screening and combined
departure and arrival screening in our analysis. Alternatively, the benefits of redundant
screening (noted above for programs with departure and arrival screens) could be gained in a
single-site screening program by simply having two successive fever-screening stations that
travellers pass through (or taking multiple measurements of each traveller at a single station).
As risk factors become better known, questionnaires could be refined to identify more potential
cases. Alternatively, less stringent definition of high exposure risk (e.g. contact with anyone with
respiratory symptoms) would be more sensitive. These approaches would boost sensitivity of
screening, but could also incur a large cost in terms of false positives detained, especially
during influenza season.
The availability of rapid PCR tests would also be beneficial for case identification at arrival, and
would address concerns with false-positive detections. If such tests were fast, there may be
potential to test suspected cases in real time based on questionnaire responses, travel origin, or
borderline symptoms. However, such measures could prove highly expensive if implemented at
scale. There is also scope for new tools to improve the ongoing tracking of travellers who pass
through screening, such as smartphone-based self-reporting of temperature or symptoms in
incoming cases. Recent travellers could even be asked to maintain a diary of close contacts for
14 days following arrival, to expedite contact tracing in the event they become ill with nCoV.
This would be cheaper and more scalable than intense follow-up, but is likely to be limited by
user adherence.
Our analysis underscores the reality that respiratory viruses are difficult to detect by travel
screening programs, particularly if a substantial fraction of infected people show mild or
indistinct symptoms, and if incubation periods are long. Quantitative estimates of screening
effectiveness will improve as more is learned about this recently-emerged virus, and will vary
with the precise design of screening programs. However, we present a robust qualitative finding:
in any situation where there is widespread epidemic transmission in source populations from
which travellers are drawn, travel screening programs can slow but not stop the importation of
infected cases. By decomposing the factors leading to success or failure of screening efforts,
our work supports decision-making about program design, and highlights key questions for
further research. We hope that these insights may help to mitigate the global impacts of nCoV
by guiding effective decision-making in both high- and low-resource countries, and may
contribute to prospective improvements in travel screening policy for future emerging infections.

Materials and Methods
Modeling strategy
The model’s structure is summarized above (Fig. 1), and detailed methods have been described
previously (Gostic et al., 2015). Here, we summarize relevant extensions, assumptions and
parameter inputs.
Extensions
Our previous model tracked all the ways in which infected travellers can be detected by
screening (fever screen, or risk factor screen at arrival or departure). Here, we additionally keep
track of the many ways in which infected travellers can be missed (i.e. missed given fever
present, missed given exposure risk present, missed given both present, or missed given
undetectable). Cases who have not yet passed the incubation period are considered
undetectable by fever screening, even if they will eventually develop symptoms in the future. In
other words, no traveller is considered “missed given fever present” until they have passed the
incubation period and show detectable symptoms. Infected travellers who progress to
symptoms during their journey are considered undetectable by departure screening, but
detectable by arrival screening. Additionally, in the supplementary user interface, we
implemented the possibility that some fraction of infected travellers deliberately evade
screening.
Fraction of subclinical cases
Our best-case scenario, in which only 5% of cases are subclinical, is consistent with the fact
that the vast majority of nCoV cases detected to date have shown fever or other detectable
symptoms (Chan et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020). But so far the data have
primarily captured severe, hospitalized cases, so the true fraction of subclinical nCoV cases
remains a crucial unknown. Particularly given the conspicuous under-representation of children
and young adults among hospitalized patients (Huang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020), our medium
and worst-case scenarios (75% and 50% subclinical) remain plausible.
Incubation period distribution
Numerous recent studies have estimated that the incubation period lasts about 5.5 days on
average (Backer et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020), with the tail of
the distribution stretching to at least 12 days (Backer et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). Consistent
with these observations, a recent study by Backer, Klinkberg and Wallinga (2020) characterized
the incubation period distribution for nCoV, concluding that a Weibull distribution provided the
best fit to data, but that a gamma distribution performed almost as well. We proceed by adopting
their best-fit gamma distribution (mean 5.7 days, s.d. 2.6, or alternatively, shape = 4.8, scale =
1.2), as the gamma form is more computationally convenient within our model. In order to vary
the mean incubation period in our uncertainty analyses while maintaining the shape of this two-

%.'
Effectiveness of exposure risk questionnaires
The probability that an infected traveller is detectable using questionnaire-based screening for
exposure risk will be highest if specific risk factors are known. Other than close contact with a
known nCoV case, or contact with the Hunan seafood wholesale market in the earlier phase of
the outbreak in Wuhan, we are not aware that any specific risk factors have been identified.
Given the relative anonymity of respiratory transmission, we assume that a minority of infected
travellers would realize that they have been exposed before symptoms develop (20% in Fig. 2,
range 5-40% in Fig. 3). Further, relying on a previous upper-bound estimate (Gostic et al., 2015)
we assume that only 25% of travellers would self-report truthfully if aware of elevated exposure
risk.
Table 1 summarizes the state of knowledge about additional key natural history parameters, as
of January 28, 2020.
