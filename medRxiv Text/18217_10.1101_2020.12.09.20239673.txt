Abstract
Background. When patients with chronic kidney disease are infected with severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) they can face two specific problems:
Virus-specific immune responses may be impaired and remdesivir, an antiviral drug
described to shorten the time to recovery, is contraindicated. Antiviral treatment with
convalescent plasma could be an alternative treatment option.
Methods. In this case series we present two kidney transplant recipients and two
patients dependent on haemodialysis who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and
received convalescent plasma. Antibodies against the spike 1 protein of SARS-CoV-2
were determined sequentially by IgG ELISA and neutralization assay and specific T cell
responses by interferon-gamma ELISpot.
Results. Prior to treatment, in three patients antibodies were undetectable by ELISA
(ratio < 1.1), corresponding to low neutralizing antibody titers (≤ 1:40). One patient was
also negative to the ELISpot and two showed weak responses. After convalescent
plasma treatment we observed an increase of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (IgG
ratio and neutralization titer) and of specific T cell responses. After intermittent clinical
improvement one kidney transplant recipient again developed typical symptoms at day
12 after treatment and received a second cycle of convalescent plasma treatment.
Altogether, three patients clinically improved and could be discharged from hospital.
However, one multimorbid female in her early eighties deceased.
Conclusions. Our data suggest that the success of convalescent plasma therapy may
only be temporary in patients with chronic kidney disease; which requires an adaptation
of the treatment regimen. Close monitoring after treatment is needed for this patient
group.

Introduction
In patients with chronic kidney disease and infected with severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) treatment can be complicated because their
immune function is suppressed due to medication to prevent allograft rejection and/or
the underlying kidney disease. Thereby, the formation of specific antibodies and of T
cell immunity is impaired; which can result in a prolonged persistence of SARS-CoV-2
(for up to two months1). Furthermore, remdesivir, an antiviral nucleoside analogue which
shortened the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)
disease2, is contraindicated in this special cohort. Antiviral treatment with convalescent
plasma (CP) could be an alternative treatment option. Data on patients with chronic
kidney disease infected with SARS-CoV-2 and receiving CP treatment are still limited.
We are aware of only 12 described kidney transplant recipients who received CP.3-6
Whereas clinical improvement after CP has been shown for all six kidney transplant
recipients included in three studies3-5, in the fourth study6 a mortality rate for solid organ
recipients (including six with kidney allograft) in the range of recipients without CP
treatment7-9 was reported (23%6 vs. 24-32%7-9, respectively). However, the previous
reports did not present data on the course of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies or T cells
in the patients.

It was the aim of the current study to follow-up up virus-specific humoral and cellular
immunity in patients with chronic kidney disease who were infected with SARS-CoV-2
and received CP therapy. We functionally analysed the antibodies (by neutralisation
assay) and measured T cell responses by the highly sensitive ELISpot method, using

various protein antigens of SARS-CoV-2 as specific stimuli. Finally, in one transplant
recipient who again developed typical COVID-19 symptoms after initial clinical
improvement we had the chance to modify the treatment regimen and to apply a second
cycle of CP therapy.

Materials and Methods

Patients and blood donors
The current case series includes two renal transplant recipients and two haemodialysis
patients (Table 1) and their respective CP donors. One patient suffered from moderate
and three from severe COVID-19 disease.10 All patients had chronic kidney disease
according to the estimated glomerular filtration rate of 7-29 mL/min/1.73 m². One cycle
of CP consisted of three units, each containing 200-280 mL, which was applied at day
1, 3 and 5. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the University
Hospital Essen, Germany (20-9256-BO for the patients and 20-9225-BO for the donors)
and the study participants provided written informed consent. All necessary
patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms
have been archived. The procedures were in accordance with the institutional and
national ethical standards as well as with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in
2013.

Methods

Antibody ELISA
To assess SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immunity, IgG antibodies were determined by
a CE marked Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG semi-quantitative ELISA (Euroimmun, Lübeck,
Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The ELISA plates were coated
with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) 1 protein (receptor binding domain). Serum
samples were analysed automatically at a 1:100 dilution, using the ImmunomatTM
(Virion\Serion, Würzburg, Germany). Results are given as ratio (patient sample / control
sample). An antibody ratio of ≥ 1.1 was considered positive, of ≥ 0.8 to < 1.1 borderline
and of < 0.8 negative.

Virus neutralization assay
The function of specific antibodies was measured by a cell-culture based neutralization
assay, using Vero E6 cells (ATCC® CRL-1586™, Manassas, Virginia, USA) and a
clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2.11,12 Neutralization capacity was determined by endpoint
dilution assay, expressed as 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/mL. Serial
dilutions (1:20 to 1:1280) of the respective sera were pre-incubated with 100 TCID50 of
SARS-CoV-2 for one hour at 37°C and added afterwards to confluent Vero E6 cells
cultured in 96-well microtiter plates. On day 3 after infection, the cells were stained with
crystal violet (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) solved in 20 % methanol (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany) and the appearance of cytopathic effects (CPE) was analysed by light

microscopy. The neutralizing titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest serum
dilution at which no CPE breakthrough in any of the triplicate cultures was observed.

ELISpot assay
To assess SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular immunity, we performed ELISpot assays, using
peptide pools of the S1/S2 protein, of the S1 protein and of the membrane (M) protein
(Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and an S1 protein antigen of SARSCoV-2 (Sino Biological, Wayne, PA, U.S.A.). We tested 250,000 peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) per cell culture and measured IFN-γ production after 19
hours, as published recently in detail12 (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/1/20-3772app1.pdf). Spot numbers were analysed by an ELISpot reader (AID Fluorospot,
Autoimmun Diagnostika GmbH, Strassberg, Germany). Mean values of duplicate cell
cultures were considered. SARS-CoV-2-specific spots were determined as stimulated
minus non-stimulated (background) values (spots increment). We defined threefold
higher SARS-CoV-2-specific spots versus background together with at least three spots
above background as positive response. This cut-off was set based on negative control
values as described previously.12

Results
In three patients with undetectable SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG (ratio <1.1) and low
neutralizing antibody titers (≤ 1:40) we observed an increase of antibody titers (Figure
1A-C). One patient who was transplanted twice (RTX01) initially showed a clinical
response to CP therapy, but at day 12 again developed typical symptoms of COVID-19
disease (fever and shortage of air). Therefore, she received another cycle of CP therapy
(from the same donor). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies increased after both CP cycles and
SARS-CoV-2 viral load decreased (ct value to the PCR increased from 17.8 to 25.8
after the first and to 34.9 after the second CP cycle). The antibody ratios in the first
three patients prior to the CP therapy were 0.15, 0.14 and 0.17 and the respective
neutralizing antibody titers 1:20, < 1:20 and 1:40. After CP therapy, antibodies in the
patients reached a maximum ratio of 3.07, 2.19 and 3.70, corresponding to a
neutralizing titer of up to 1:640, 1:160 and 1:640, respectively. In the donors, the
antibody ratios were 5.83, 7.33 and 10.44 and the neutralizing titers 1:1280, 1:320 and
1:160, respectively. The fourth patient with pre-existing antibodies showed an increase
of specific immunity (ratio 5.96 → 7.01; neutralizing titer 1:640 → 1:1280) (Figure 1D).
SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in the CP donor of the fourth patient were lower (ratio
3.39, neutralizing titer 1:320). Cellular immunity could be followed-up by IFN-γ ELISpot
in three patients, using four different SARS-CoV-2-specific antigens (peptide pools of
the S1/S2, S1 and M protein and an S1 protein antigen). In all three patients IFN-γ
production to the ELISpot intermittently increased after CP therapy, reaching a
maximum at day 6 to 14 after therapy. These three patients clinically improved and
could be discharged from hospital. However, one multimorbid female in her early

therapy.

Discussion
Our data indicate that CP therapy led to an increase of specific humoral and cellular
immunity in two kidney transplant recipients and two haemodialysis patients with SARSCoV-2 infection. CP therapy could bridge the phase of acute COVID-19 disease.
However, presumably due to drug-induced immunosuppression or impaired kidney
function, the immune responses were not as long-acting as expected. In one patient
with two prior kidney transplantations (RTX01) two cycles of therapy were necessary for
successful treatment. It can be supposed that the patient herself was unable to mount
an adequate antibody response and that the passively transferred antibodies partly
bound the virus that resides in the affected organs and in the respective lymphoid
tissue.13 Theoretically, it is possible that CP therapy mitigates the native humoral
immune response and leaves an individual vulnerable to subsequent reinfection with
SARS-CoV-2.3,14 This phenomenon appears more likely in immunosuppressed vs.
otherwise healthy individuals. Concerning ELISpot data, we observed a maximum of
IFN-γ responses shortly after completion of the CP cycle. Of note, cellular immunity is
regarded as important for recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection15 and appears as shortlived in the current cohort. As CP therapy is a form of passive immunization, an
increase of cellular responses is not expected at first glance. It can be speculated that
due to the reduction of the viral load the patients were able to generate specific T cell
responses by themselves. It was previously described that high viral load (of the

hepatitis B virus) caused antigen-specific immune tolerance.16 Possibly, a similar
imbalance between viral load and control by the immune system occurred in the current
cohort. After an initial increase IFN-γ production decreased again, which could reflect
the fact that due to the decrease of antibodies antigen-specific immune tolerance reappeared or that pro-inflammatory immune responses shifted to anti-inflammatory
responses.17 Moreover, treatment with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and
prednisone (in both transplant recipients) and toxic metabolites due to chronic kidney
disease suppressed T cell function, which could impede long-term protection against
reinfection.3,18

Both kidney transplant recipients showed clinical improvement and three out of four
patients with chronic kidney disease; which is in the range of previous reports3-6.
However, due to the low patient number, it was beyond the aim of our study to answer
the question if CP therapy was effective. This answer can only be given by large
randomized clinical studies such as the Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy
(RECOVERY) trial 19; which are currently underway.

In conclusion, our data suggest that despite an increase of SARS-CoV-2-specific
immunity the success of CP therapy may only be temporary in a subset of patients with
chronic kidney disease. Thus, short-term treatment control appears mandatory for this
patient group. If necessary, the the treatment regimen has to be adapted.

Figure 1. Course of specific humoral and cellular immunity in four patients with
chronic kidney disease infected with SARS-CoV-2 and receiving convalescent
plasma treatment. Antibodies were determined by an S1 specific IgG ELISA
(Euroimmun) and by cell-culture based neutralization assay (NT titer). T cell responses
were analysed by an interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) ELISpot assay, using peptide pools of
the S1/S2, S1 and M protein and an S1 protein antigen as specific stimuli (depicted as
S1/S2, S1, M and S ELI). We here present data on two kidney transplant recipients
(RTX01, RTX02) and two patients on haemodialysis (HD01, HD02) and compared their
immune responses with those of the corresponding donors of convalescent plasma (CP,
