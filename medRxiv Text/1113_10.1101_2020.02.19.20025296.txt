Abstract:
Objective: To determine the predictive value of CT and clinical characteristics for
short-term disease progression in patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia
(NCP).
Materials and Methods: 224 patients with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus
(COVID-19) infection outside Wuhan who had chest CT examinations were
retrospectively screened. Clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records.
CT images were reviewed and scored for lesion distribution, lobe and segment
involvement, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and interstitial thickening. All
included patients with moderate NCP were observed for at least 14 days from
admission to determine whether they exacerbated to severe NCP (progressive group)
or not (stable group). CT and clinical characteristics between the two groups were
compared, and multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses were
performed to identify the risk factors for developing severe NCP.
Results: A total of 141 patients with moderate NCP were included, of which 15
(10.6%) patients developed severe NCP during hospitalization and assigned to the
progressive group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.26 [1.04-1.53]; P = 0.018) and CT severity score (OR and 95% CI, 1.25
[1.08-1.46]; P = 0.004) on admission were independent predictors for progression to
severe NCP, and sensitivity analysis confirmed the consistent results in nonimported
patients but not in imported patients. However, no significant difference in lung
involvement was found on CT between imported and nonimported patients (all P >
0.05). Patients who were admitted more than 4 days from symptom onset tended to
have more severe lung involvement. Spearman correlation analysis showed the close
association between CT severity score and inflammatory indexes (r = 0.17~0.47, all P
< 0.05).
Conclusion: CT severity score was associated with inflammatory levels and higher
NLR and CT severity score on admission were independent risk factors for short-term
progression in patients with NCP outside Wuhan. Furthermore, early admission and
surveillance by CT should be recommended to improve clinical outcomes.

Introduction
The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) originated from Wuhan
has shown the ability of human-to-human transmission and rapidly spread to become
a world-wide emergency along with increasing imported and secondary contacted
infection risk.1 Most patients with NCP have a mild clinical course, while a proportion
of patients demonstrated rapid deterioration (particularly within 7-14 days) from onset
of symptoms into severe NCP with or without acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS). These patients have poor survival and often require intensive medical
resource utilization, and the mortality of them are about 20 times higher than that of
non-severe 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) patients. 2,3 Thus, early identification
of patients at risk of serious complications of NCP is of clinical importance. Several
studies reported that the prevalence of severe NCP ranged from 15.7% to 26.1% and
these cases were often associated with abnormal chest CT findings and clinical
laboratory data.3-5 Guan et al indicated that patients with severe NCP were more likely
to show ground-glass opacity (GGO), local or bilateral patchy shadowing, and
interstitial abnormalities on CT.5 This likely reflects the clinical progression of disease
but also offers an opportunity to investigate the clinical utility of chest CT as a
predictive tool to risk-stratify the patients. Furthermore, the predictive value of chest
CT in NCP prognosis is warranted as to assist the effective treatment and control of
disease spread. Previous study suggested that higher CT lung score correlated with
poor prognosis in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(MERS).6 Chest CT has been demonstrated to be an important approach for screening
individuals with suspected NCP and monitoring treatment response according to the
dynamic radiological changes of NCP.7 Therefore, we enrolled a cohort of patients
with moderate NCP on admission and observed for at least 14 days to explore the
early CT and clinical risk factors for progression to severe NCP. Meanwhile, we also
compared the CT and inflammatory indexes in patients with different source of
infection or period from symptom onset to admission to provide deep understanding
of the relationship among CT findings, epidemiological features, and inflammation.
Materials and Methods
Patients
Our study was conducted in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA). The permission of Institutional Review Board of The
Third Xiangya Hospital was obtained for retrospective assessment of clinical and
radiological data with waiver of informed consent.
Health records were reviewed for patients who were treated at Third Xiangya Hospital,
Changsha Public Health Treatment Center, and Second People’s Hospital of Hunan
between January 17, 2020 and February 1, 2020. Patients were included in the study if
they satisfied the following criteria: 1) confirmed COVID-19 infection; 2) available
chest CT scan on admission. The diagnosis of COVID-19 infection was established
based on the World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance, and a confirmed

case was defined as a positive result to high-throughput sequencing or real-time
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for nasal and
pharyngeal swab specimens. Patients were observed for at least 14 days from
admission to determine whether they exacerbated to severe NCP (progressive group)
or not (stable group).
Clinical data collection
Demographic, epidemiological, and laboratory data were obtained with data
collection forms from electronic medical records. According to the source of infection,
patients were divided into imported group (patients who had recently been to Wuhan)
and nonimported group (patients who contacted with people from Wuhan or local
infected patients). The clinical classification of NCP are as follows: (1) moderate type,
patients with fever, respiratory tract symptoms, and radiological evidence of
confirmed pneumonia. (2) severe type, patients with one of the following: a)
respiratory distress (respiratory rate ≥ 30 beats/min); b) hypoxia (oxygen saturation ≤
93% in the resting state); c) hypoxemia (arterial blood oxygen partial pressure/oxygen
concentration ≤ 300mmHg). (3) critical type, patients with one of the following: a)
respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation; b) shock; c) intensive care unit
(ICU) admission is required for combined other organs failure. In this study, severe
NCP broadly included severe and critical types as above defined. The endpoint of this
study was the development of severe NCP, and patients who discharged or did not
developed severe NCP at enrollment were censored.
CT examination and image analysis
The SOMATOM go.Top scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), GE Revolution CT
scanner (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, USA), and TOSHIBA Aquilion 16 (Toshiba,
Tokyo, Japan) were used for chest CT examinations. The images were reconstructed
to 1.0-mm thickness for the transverse scans. Sagittal and coronal reconstructions
with a 3.0-mm thickness were performed.
All CT images were reviewed independently by two radiologists, each with over 10
years of experience in chest imaging. A third experienced radiologist was consulted if
there was a disagreement in interpreting imaging results. The imaging features
including ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, crazy-paving, and air
bronchogram defined as previous studies were recorded.8,9 The lesion distribution
pattern, lobe and segment involvement were also assessed. The CT findings in the
outer one third of the lung were defined as peripheral, and those in the inner two
thirds of the lung were defined as central. Besides, the presence of discrete nodules,
lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion was recorded. Each of the five lung lobes was
reviewed for opacification and consolidation. The lesions extent within each lung lobe
was semi-quantitatively evaluated by scoring from 0 to 5 based on the degree of
involvement: score 0, none involvement; score 1, ≤ 5% involvement; score 2, 6%~25%
involvement; score 3, 26%~50% involvement; score 4, 51%~75% involvement; score
5, > 75% involvement. The total score was calculated by summing up scores of all
five lobes to provide a CT severity score ranging from 0 to 25.7

Statistical Analysis
Quantitative variables are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR), and
categorical variables are presented as frequency and percentage. Normality of the
continuous variables was assessed with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Differences
between groups were examined using Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney U test for
quantitative variables according to the normal distribution and Chi-square test or
Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression with
forward stepwise selection based on likelihood ratio was used to identify the risk
factors for development of severe NCP, and sensitivity analysis was performed
according to the source of infection. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM
SPSS statistics software (version 22.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and R software
(version 3.6.1). A P value of less than 0.05 considered to be statistically significant.
Results
1. Clinical characteristics
A total of 224 patients were identified according to the inclusion criteria, of which 83
patients were excluded for having: 1) observation period from admission less than 14
days (n = 60); 2) negative CT findings or severe NCP on admission (n = 16); 3) age
younger than 18 years old (n = 7). Finally, a cohort of 141 patients were included in
our study (Figure 1). The baseline demographic, epidemiological, and laboratory
characteristics of included 141 patients are presented in Table 1. Among them, 76
(53.9%) patients who had recently been to Wuhan were imported and 72 (51.1%)
were male, with a median age of 44 years and a median period symptom onset to
admission of 4 days. 52 patients of them had discharged at enrollment.
During the hospitalization, 15 cases progressed to severe NCP (progressive group)
and the remaining patients did not (stable group). Compare with stable group, patients
in progressive group were significantly older (P = 0.001), but the male gender and
imported proportions were not shown statistical difference. Patients who progressed
to severe NCP were more likely to have underlying hypertension (P = 0.004), but did
not otherwise have significant differences in other co-morbidities including diabetes,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease,
cerebrovascular disease and chronic hepatitis B infection. The main symptoms
between the two groups were not statistically different, while slightly more patients
manifested digestive symptoms in progressive group, such as anorexia and diarrhea (P
= 0.088 and 0.065, respectively). Patients in the progressive group had lower baseline
lymphocyte count, higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and C-reactive
protein (all P < 0.01).
2. CT findings
There were 87 (61.7%) patients with 4 to 5 lobes involved, with a median of 9
segments involved. Most lesions were bilateral (87.2%) and peripheral or mixed
distributed (98.6%). The main CT characteristics of patients with NCP included GGO,
GGO with crazy-paving, consolidation, and GGO with consolidation, ranging from

29.8%~95.7% (Table 1; Figure 2 a-f). Other infrequent features included discrete
nodules, lymphadenopathy, and small pleural effusion. Compared with stable group,
patients in progressive group had more lobes and segments involved, higher
proportion of crazy-paving sign, and higher CT severity score (all P < 0.05; Figure 3
a).
3. Multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses
Logistic regression analysis showed that baseline NLR (odds ratio [OR] and 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.26 [1.04-1.53]; P = 0.018) and CT severity score (OR and
95% CI, 1.25 [1.08-1.46]; P = 0.004) were independent predictors for progression to
severe NCP (Table 2). When stratifying by the source of infection (imported or
nonimported), the results showed that baseline NLR (OR and 95% CI, 1.71
[1.05-2.79]; P = 0.023) and CT severity score (OR with 95% CI, 1.58 [1.09-2.28]; P =
0.001) remained the significant risk factors in nonimported patients, but not in
imported patients. Among the imported patients, only age (OR with 95% CI, 1.13
[1.04-1.22]; P = 0.004) was the predictor for progression to severe NCP.
4. Comparison between subgroups according to source of infection and period from
symptom onset to admission
There was no significant difference in the CT findings between imported and
nonimported patients, who had similar lesion distribution pattern, main imaging
features and comparable lung involvement and CT severity score (Figure 3 b). For
patients who were admitted more than 4 days from symptom onset, more lobes or
segments involved and higher CT severity score were found (Figure 3 c), while there
was no significant difference in age and inflammatory indexes (including white blood
cell count, NLR, and C-reactive protein) between patients with different period (≤ 4
days vs. > 4 days) from symptom onset to admission.
Further Spearman correlation analysis showed the close association between CT
characteristics and inflammatory indexes, especially for CT severity score and
C-reactive protein (Figure 4).
Discussion
In this study, we retrospectively assessed the CT and clinical characteristics of 141
patients with NCP outside Wuhan and identified the baseline risk factors for clinical
progression. Our results showed that higher NLR and CT severity score on admission
were independent predictors for progression to severe NCP, especially in nonimported
patients. In addition, patients who were admitted longer from symptom onset tended
to have more severe lung involvement.
With the increase of newly confirmed and severe cases, the management of severe
patients brings huge challenge in efficiently controlling the COVID-19 outbreak.
Some patients progressed rapidly with ARDS and subsequent multiple organ
dysfunction syndrome (MODS).2 Early identification of patients with high risk to
develop ARDS or MODS and risk stratification management might be helpful to
reduce mortality. In our cohort, the prevalence of severe NCP was 10.6%, which was

lower than some large-scale reports.3,5 The main cause was because our patients were
moderate on admission and enrolled from one single city. We found that progressive
patients were older and had a greater number of underlying hypertension than stable
patients. These data were in agreement with another recent report, which suggested
that age and history of hypertension may be risk factors for short-term progression.10
Our study further showed that progressive patients had lower baseline lymphocyte
count, higher NLR and C-reactive protein. COVID-19 virus might act on lymphocytes
as does severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which induces a
cytokine storm and results in a series of immune responses.11 Some studies suggest
that decrease of T lymphocyte count indicate that coronavirus consumes many
immune cells and inhibits the cellular immune function, and reduced but
hyperactivated peripheral T cells partially accounts for the severe immune injury in
COVID-19 patients.12,13 Thus, damage to lymphocytes might be an important factor
leading to exacerbations of patients. NLR, as a simple lymphocyte related parameter
to assess easily the inflammatory status, is widely used for the prediction of prognosis
of patients with pneumonia.14,15 Higher NLR indicates damaged lymphocyte function
and/or risk of bacterial infection due to low immune function. In addition, C-reactive
protein is another serum maker produced by the liver in response to inflammation. Liu
et al showed that C-reactive protein might be predictive of disease severity in
COVID-19 infected patients. 16 Thus, our results suggested that patients with higher
inflammatory levels on admission had higher risk to develop severe NCP.
To explore the predictive value of CT for progression, we compared the difference of
CT characteristics in stable and progressive patients, and found that progressive
patients had greater lung involvement and higher CT severity score. CT severity score
is used to semi-quantitatively estimate the pulmonary involvement, which is
associated with both number of involved lobes and extent of lesions. 17 Pan et al
reported a 4-stage dynamic pattern of NCP based on CT severity score and indicated
that lung abnormalities showed greatest severity approximately 10 days after initial
onset of symptoms. 7 In support of our findings, a previous report regarding MERS
showed the predictive value of CT severity score for prognosis and short-term
mortality.6 Furthermore, higher proportion of progressive patients showed
crazy-paving sign which reflects interstitial thickening. 18 Guan et al also reported
higher proportion of severe patients with interstitial abnormalities.5 The binding of
COVID-19 spike protein to the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)
contributes to the downregulation of ACE2, increased pulmonary capillary
permeability, and diffuse alveolar damage during NCP.19,20 In patients with SARS,
mixed and predominant reticular patterns were noted from the second week.8,21 Thus,
we speculated that the involvement of the interstitial vascular endothelial cells results
in interlobular and intralobular septal thickening, which is associated with the disease
severity.
Our results showed that NLR and CT severity score on admission were significant
predictors for progression to severe illness. The early predictive value of NLR has
been reported in a recent study.10 To our knowledge, this is the first study to indicate

the role of CT to predict disease progression in patients with NCP. Previous study
showed that the MuLBSTA score can early warn the mortality of viral pneumonia,
which included lymphopenia and multilobe infiltration.22 Our findings were consistent
with theirs but more quantitatively in terms of imaging evaluation of lung
involvement. Like SARS and MERS, some NCP patients progressed rapidly at about
10-14 days after onset likely dues to the cytokine storm in the body as evidenced by
increased plasma proinflammatory cytokines.11,23 Our results further revealed the
significant association between inflammatory markers and CT characteristics,
especially for C-reactive protein and CT severity score, which indicated the potential
value of CT to estimate pulmonary inflammation and lung damage. Furthermore, the
predictive significance of NLR and CT severity score was confirmed only in
nonimported patients outside Wuhan. Among the imported patients from Wuhan, the
elder had higher risk to develop severe illness. However, the reason for this
discrepancy between imported and nonimported patients remains to be elucidated.
The patients who were admitted more than 4 days after symptom onset had more
severe lung involvement, which likely attributed to the lung involvement progression
as disease course extends. Song et al found that more consolidation and less GGO
lesions in patients with an interval > 4 days between symptom onset and CT scan.24
Thus, early admission and surveillance by CT is crucial for the individual
management of patients with NCP.
There were some limitations in our study. First, our study retrospectively included 141
patients with moderate NCP on admission from one single city outside Wuhan. Data
from multiple cities are needed to further validate our findings. Second, dynamic
inflammatory indexes and treatment during hospitalization were not included in the
analysis. More comprehensive investigation of the relationship between CT
characteristics and cytokine storm induced by COVID-2019 needs to be performed.
In conclusion, our results showed that higher NLR and CT severity score on
admission were independent risk factors for short-term progression in patients with
NCP. The CT findings in patients with NCP were associated with inflammatory levels
and both them have the potential to predict disease progression. Imported and
nonimported patients outside Wuhan should be managed equally, and early admission
is required for avoiding severe pulmonary damage.
