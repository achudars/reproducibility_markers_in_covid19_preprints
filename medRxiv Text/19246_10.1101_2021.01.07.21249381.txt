Abstract
Comparing age and sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization and mortality with
influenza and other health outcomes opens the way to generating hypotheses as to the
underlying mechanisms, building on the extraordinary advances in immunology and
physiology that have occurred over the last year. Notable departures in health outcomes
starting around puberty suggest that burdens associated with influenza and other
causes are reduced relative to the two emergent coronaviruses over much of adult life.
Two possible hypotheses could explain this: protective adaptive immunity for influenza
and other infections, or greater sensitivity to immunosenescence in the coronaviruses.
Comparison of sex differences suggest an important role for adaptive immunity; but
immunosenescence might also be relevant, if males experience faster
immunosenescence. Involvement of the renin-angiotensin-system in SARS-CoV-2
infection might drive high sensitivity to disruptions of homeostasis. Overall, these
results highlight the long tail of vulnerability in the age profile relevant to the emergent
coronaviruses, which more transmissible variants have the potential to uncover at the
younger end of the scale, and aging populations will expose at the other end of the scale.
Introduction
From early in the pandemic, the discrepancy in SARS-CoV-2 outcomes across age was striking
(1); evidence for sex differences followed soon afterwards (2). Age profiles associated with
infectious disease contain the signature of both transmission dynamics and vulnerabilities to
infection (3). For our analysis of emerging pathogens, and influenza where waning of immunity
occurs, we consider the variability in risk of infection across age to be secondary to variability
associated with health vulnerabilities. We use age and sex profiles of health outcomes in the
context of known features of immune function to probe the underlying mechanisms of the
morbidity and mortality impact of SARS-CoV-2.
Results and Discussion
We analysed age and sex data for hospitalization, severe disease (requiring intensive care or
resulting in death) and death for SARS-CoV-2 (France and globally), MERS (Saudi Arabia),
SARS (China), influenza (France and US), as well as all-cause hospitalization (France) and
mortality (28 European countries) (Figure S1). For each pathogen, we compare the incidence
within each age-group with the incidence observed in 60 year olds (Figure A-C, Figure S2). This
approach allows us to adjust for differences in mortality that affect all age groups and the age
structure of the underlying population. We also compare the incidence between males and
females (Figure D-F, Figure S2).
The relative increase in the probabilities of hospitalization, severe disease and death are
strikingly consistent for older individuals across pathogens as well as with all-cause
hospitalization and mortality. For COVID-19 cases over 40y in age, each additional year of life
was associated with a 10.7% (95%CI: 10.3-11.0) relative increase in probability of death. This
was very similar to SARS (10.2%, 5.2-15.5), MERS (7.1%, 6.2-8.0), influenza (8.5%, 8.1-8.8)
and all cause mortality (10.2%, 10.1-104%), and, indeed, the latter has been previously noted
(4, 5). Influenza age distributions were also consistent across countries and across different

reporting systems within the same country (Figures S3-S4). However, there are notable
departures between pathogens among younger age groups.

Qualitatively, all age-patterns echo the classic U-shape of human mortality (6): initially high
levels of infant hospitalization, severe disease and death first fall, and then increase (Figure
1A-C). However, the age at which the increase in hospitalization, severe disease or
mortality occurs differs considerably. In particular, for both influenza and all cause
hospitalisations, rates remain relatively low between ages 10 and 50, while a stark increase
is observed for SARS-CoV-2 right after the minima of 9; and for MERS from 6 years (Figure
1A). Severe disease (Figure 1B) and deaths (Figure 1C) also exhibit a steeper increase
from a younger age for the coronaviruses, although the long level period is less apparent.
These patterns will be shaped by immune functioning over age (7). Early in life,
development of immune capacity and memory increase protection from infectious diseases.
These gains are then eroded by immunosenescence (8): dysregulation of innate immunity
and depletion of adaptive effectors including naive B and T-cells diminishes defense against
infectious pathogens or cancer, and increases inflammation (9). The latter effect,
sometimes termed ‘inflammaging’ (10), is associated with diseases of old age
(cardiovascular disease, strokes, diabetes, etc). The remarkable consistency of late life
increases in hospitalization, ICU and death across pathogens (Figure 1A-C) suggests a
common mechanism, and immunosenescence is the most obvious candidate. But what do
discrepancies earlier in life suggest?
Theory predicts that immunosenescence should begin at the onset of puberty (11), and indeed,
immunopathology-associated cytokines (like IL-6) gradually increase with age in healthy adults
(12, 13). Falling levels of protective cytokines (like IL-17A and Ifn-gamma) across pediatric and
adult SARS-CoV-2 patients (14) echo this result. Thus, one interpretation of the early start to the
increase in hospitalization, severe disease and death in SARS-CoV-2 and MERS is that
coronaviruses are more sensitive than influenza to this background immunosenescence at
earlier life stages.
Two possible mechanisms can be invoked to explain this. First, children are likely to experience
several influenza infections early in life (15), and may accumulate sufficient immunity to buffer
them from either infection or its consequences for much of adulthood. This is not the case for
the two emergent coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 or MERS. Second, coronavirus dependence on
the ACE2 receptor might make immunopathology a particular risk even for relatively minor viral
loads (16), as the ACE2 receptor acts to reduce inflammation. The resulting sensitivity to
disruption of homeostasis could interact with the age trajectory of immune decline, so that some
threshold for severe outcomes was crossed earlier in coronaviruses than in influenza. The first
explanation is thus rooted in development of adaptive immunity, while the second is associated
with more general disruption of immune functioning starting around puberty which the emergent
coronaviruses might be more likely to trigger.

Sex differences in immunity (17) provide another lense into evaluating possible
mechanisms underpinning the burden of SARS-CoV-2. In both influenza and SARS-CoV-2,
the burden of hospitalization shifts from being male-biased at the youngest ages, to female
between the ages of 18 and 24 and then back to male again at late ages (Figure 1D), with a
slight late life reduction in relative male burden at very late ages presumably attributable to
frailty effects (18). This broad trajectory is also seen for severe cases of SARS-CoV-2
(Figure 1E). Mortality data lack these non-linearities, and the male burden grows consistently
relative to the female burden in both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 across age, but this increase is
much more rapid in SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1F).
Typically, a male bias in risk occurs when weak immune responses underlie significant host
damage by a pathogen, while a female bias occurs when strong immune responses promote
host damage (19). Respiratory infections typically trigger strong Type 1 immune responses,
resulting in inflammation-associated damage to the lung. As estrogens are associated with
efficient immune recruitment and response (20–22), while androgens are largely characterized
as immunosuppressive (17), greater risk of hospitalization in females after puberty and before
menopause is not unexpected for respiratory pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 and influenza (Figure
1D), with further potential amplification of vulnerability during pregnancy (although this is
generally only up to 5% of the population hospitalized)(23). Interestingly, however, this greater
risk of hospitalization does not translate into much greater risk of mortality in females for either
pathogen (Figure 1F), echoing the ‘male-female health survival paradox’, (where females in
worse health survive better than comparable males (24)) although this effect is typically reported
at much later ages.
Advances in SARS-CoV-2 immunology broadly aligns with expectations for sex differences.
Greater male pathology seems associated with a failure to control the virus soon after infection
(16, 25–27), while females may both detect (28, 29) and respond (30, 31) earlier. This female
advantage may compound over age as a result of the age trajectories of particular immune
effectors, e.g., Mucosal Associated Invariant T-cells which are an important line of defense in
the lungs recruit more efficiently to airways (32), and deplete less rapidly with age in female
blood. Conversely, female severe outcomes seem driven by over-responding immune systems,
i.e., higher levels of innate immune cytokines were associated with worse disease progression
in females, but not males (27).
Assuming that the broad general patterns hold, for influenza, adaptive immunity could benefit
females by diminishing excessive immune responses, or males by enabling more efficient
pathogen control. If influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are otherwise comparable, hospitalization data
suggests that immunity benefits females, as the hospitalization data indicates a reduced bias
towards female burden in influenza relative to SARS-CoV-2 for ages <30 years (blue line above
the red line, Figure 1D); the bias then moves into males in SARS-CoV-2 at a younger age than
for influenza, and accelerates more rapidly (Figure 1D), also observed for mortality (Figure 1F).
However, although these patterns suggest that immunity could explain the age and sex
differences in SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, immuno-senescence cannot be dismissed - faster
male immunosenescence (33, 34) could also drive these results.

Despite the fact that younger individuals have been less vulnerable to the pandemic virus to
date, probing the age and sex trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that a lack of protective
immunity, potentially amplified by the intersection of viral receptor use with host homeostasis
mechanisms can expose an early start to immunosenescence. Viral evolution might expose this,
which would increase the morbidity and mortality burden associated with the pandemic virus;
which vaccination might provide an opportunity to buffer.. More generally, as the global
population ages, the intersection of immuno-senescence with pathogens for which we have no
adaptive immunity may open important vulnerabilities to emergent pathogens.

Materials and Methods
Data sources
1. COVID-19 in France. We obtained hospitalisation data from the French SI-VIC system from
the period March-September 2020. The SI-VIC system is integrated into all hospitals in France
and has been used since March 2020 to monitor COVID-19 hospitalised patients. Data are sent
daily to Santé publique France, the French national public health agency. We obtained the
number of hospitalisations, the number of patients requiring intensive care treatment and the
number of patients that died for single year age classes and by sex.
2. Influenza emergency visits in France. We obtained the age and sex distribution of emergency
visits from the French OSCOUR® network between 2004 and 2019, where influenza was
identified as the main or associated clinical diagnosis(35). The OSCOUR® network was set up
in 2004 by Santé publique France and now covers about 95% of all French hospitals. We
removed data from 2009 from this dataset as 2009 was a pandemic year with different agedistribution of cases.
4. Influenza ICU and death data in France. We obtained the number of cases requiring ICU and
the number of deaths by age for the period 2012-2017, from the French national hospital
discharge database (PMSI), which contains all records of hospitalisations in all hospitals in
France (36). We included hospital stays where influenza was identified as the main or
associated clinical diagnosis.
5. Influenza mortality data USA. We extracted the number of deaths by single year age class
and by sex where influenza was the main cause of death for the whole of the USA in 2019 from
the US National Vital Statistics System (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/deaths.htm).
6. MERS data. We used the MERS database maintained by Andrew Rambaut at the University
of Edinburgh that was collated during the MERS outbreak in 2013
(https://github.com/rambaut/MERS-Cases/). This linelist database province individual age, sex
and whether the individual required intensive care treatment and whether they died.
7. SARS mortality data. We obtained the number of SARS deaths in China from Yu et al., in the
following age classes: 0-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75+ (37).
8. All emergency visits in France. We obtained the age and sex distribution of all coded
emergency visits (all causes) in French hospitals from the OSCOUR® network between 2004
and 2019.
9. All cause mortality in 28 European countries. We extracted the all-cause number of deaths by
single year age class and by sex for the 28 EU countries (including the UK) through the
Euromomo system.
10. Multi-country SARS-CoV-2 mortality model estimates. We obtained estimates of the relative
risk of death given infection by age and sex from a previously published model that fitted age
and sex-specific COVID-19 death data from 45 countries(1).

Data analyses
1. Comparisons by age

We compared the incidence between each group using a rolling window of size 5 years with that
of 60 year olds. Taking each pathogen in turn, we compared the incidence within each age
group by dividing the total number of deaths within an age group with the size of the population
from the national census for that country. We then calculated the relative incidence within each
age group as compared to 60 year olds. This approach allows us to adjust for underlying
differences in incidence and outcome across pathogens that affect all age groups in the same
way. We considered three different outcomes: Hospitalisation (or emergency department visit in
the case of influenza), severe disease (defined as requiring ICU treatment or ending in death)
and death. For all cause emergency department visits, we removed the cases that were due to
influenza to ensure any patterns weren’t being driven by influenza admissions. To capture
uncertainty we calculated 95% Wald confidence intervals. For the multi-country SARS-CoV-2
mortality estimates, the risk of death given infection was derived from a Bayesian model that
combined the results of 22 national-level seroprevalence studies with reported age and sexspecific COVID-19 death data from 45 countries. Relative risks by age were calculated in 5 year
age groups as compared to those aged 60-64 years.

2. Comparisons between males and females
For all-cause hospitalisation and mortality, influenza hospitalisation (France) and death (USA),
and SARS-CoV-2 hospitalisation (France), severe disease (France) and death (multicountry
study), sufficient data was available to detect differences by both sex and age. We compared
the incidence between males and females using a rolling window of size 10 year age groups (5
year groups in the case of the multi-country SARS-CoV-2 analysis). Taking each pathogen in
turn, for each window, we divided the incidence in males with that observed in females. We
calculated 95% Wald confidence intervals.
