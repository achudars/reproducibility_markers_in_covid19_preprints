ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
It is important to know if mortality among hospitalised covid-19 patients has changed as the
pandemic has progressed. The aim of this study was to describe the dynamics of mortality
among patients hospitalised for covid-19 in a nationwide study.
DESIGN
Nationwide observational cohort study of all patients hospitalised in Sweden 1 March to 30
June 2020 with SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity 14 days before to 5 days after admission, and a
discharge code for covid-19.
SETTING
All hospitals in Sweden.
PARTICIPANTS
15 761 hospitalised patients with covid-19, with data compiled by the Swedish National
Board of Health and Welfare.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Outcome was 60-day all-cause mortality. Patients were stratified according to month of
hospital admission. Poisson regression was used to estimate the relative risk of death by
month of admission, adjusting for pre-existing conditions, age, sex, care dependency, and
severity of illness (Simplified Acute Physiology, version 3), for patients in intensive care units
(ICU).
RESULTS
The overall 60-day mortality was 17.8% (95% confidence interval (CI), 17.2% to 18.4%), and
it decreased from 24.7% (95% CI, 23.0% to 26.5%) in March to 13.3% (95% CI, 12.1% to
14.7%) in June. Adjusted relative risk (RR) of death was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.51 to 0.63) for June,
using March as reference. Corresponding RR for patients not admitted to ICU and those
admitted to ICU were 0.60 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.67) and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.48 to 0.79),

respectively. The proportion of patients admitted to ICU decreased from 19.5% (95% CI,
17.9% to 21.0%) in the March cohort to 11.0% (95% CI, 9.9% to 12.2%) in the June cohort.
CONCLUSIONS
There was a gradual decline in mortality from March to June 2020 in Swedish hospitalised
covid-19 patients, which was independent of pre-existing conditions, age, and sex. Future
research is needed to explain the reasons for this decline. The changing covid-19 mortality
should be taken into account when management and results of studies from the first pandemic
wave are evaluated.

Introduction
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has put enormous pressure on the
healthcare system in general and on hospitals in particular, despite extensive interventions to
reduce spread of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.1 Patients admitted for covid-19 have been
reported to have mortality fractions of ≥20% overall2-5 and of >34% among patients admitted
to an intensive care unit (ICU).2,6-8 The proportion of patients requiring ICU admission is
reported to be 17-32%.2,9-11

Most studies on covid-19 mortality have included patients admitted between February and
April 2020, i.e. early in the covid-19 pandemic.1 Since the outbreak of the pandemic, there
has been a gradual and substantial increase in our understanding of covid-19. This may have
contributed to the improved survival that has been noted among ICU-treated covid-19
patients. In an ICU study of covid-19 patients in England, Wales and Northern Ireland by
Doidge et al.,8 a decline in 28-day mortality was noted from 43.5% before the peak of the first
pandemic wave to 34.3% after the peak. A meta-analysis of Armstrong et al.12 showed lower
ICU mortalities in studies published April-May than in those published January-March.
However, a large proportion of hospitalised covid-19 patients are never admitted to ICU, and
to our knowledge it has not been clarified if mortality has changed among non-ICU treated
hospitalised patients. Karagiannidis et al.5 reported no considerable change in mortality over
time in a large German cohort of unselected hospitalised covid-19 patients.

The present Swedish study was undertaken to examine whether mortality has changed with
time in a nationwide cohort of hospitalised covid-19 patients. The specific aim was to
evaluate nationwide 60-day mortality separately for non-ICU treated and ICU treated patients,
during the first 4 months of the pandemic, using data compiled by the Swedish National
Board of Health and Welfare (NBHW).

Methods

Study design and setting
Nationwide observational cohort study on SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals treated for
covid-19 in Swedish hospitals.

Participants
The study population was derived from cross-linked national population-based registers using
the unique personal identity number assigned to each Swedish resident at birth or on
immigration to Sweden.13
From the National Patient Register (NPR), held by the NBHW, all patients admitted to
hospitals in Sweden between 1 March and 30 June, 2020 were identified, see flowchart in fig
1. Cross-linking with the Swedish reporting system for notifiable infectious diseases
(SmiNet)14 provided data on SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results. Hospitalised patients with a PCR
test result positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA 14 days before to 5 days after admission were then
identified. Finally, those with a discharge code of covid-19, i.e. U07.1 according to the 10th
International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), (n=15 761) constituted the study
population of the present study.

Outcome and covariate data
Primary outcome was 60-day mortality, defined as death from any cause within 60 days of
index hospital admission. Sixty days was considered to be a reasonable follow-up time since
very few patients remain in hospital for longer periods, but patients in ICU often remain
hospitalised beyond 30 days.5 Date of death was obtained from the Swedish Cause of Death
Register15 (held by NBHW). Since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic, the register has
been updated daily with all dates of death, as reported to the Swedish Tax Agency (mandatory
reporting by law), resulting in no loss to follow-up.

ICU episodes were identified from the Swedish Intensive Care Registry, a national quality
register for intensive care in Sweden including 83 of 84 ICUs in the country.16 Since the
outbreak of the pandemic the register has had complete coverage of all ICU treated covid-19
patients in Sweden.

In the present study, patients were stratified according to month of admission, in line with the
Swedish epidemiological curve of new admission for covid-19 (fig 2), i.e. rapid increase in
admission rate in March, relatively stable high admission rate in April, relatively stable
moderately high admission rate in May, and decreasing admission rate in June. The date of
index admission for each patient was defined as the admission date of the first hospital care
episode that fitted the inclusion criteria.
To account for patient transfer within or between hospitals, resulting in multiple entries in the
NPR, duration of hospital stay was defined as number of days between index admission date
and last discharge date in cases with sequential admissions. A sequential admission was
defined as a readmission occurring within 1 day of the previous one, starting with the index
admission. Duration of hospital stay in days was compared using the outcome discharge status
(alive/deceased) rather than 60-day mortality, to avoid truncating one group at 60 days by
default.
Comorbidities were defined using discharge diagnoses for the last five years and/or prescribed
drugs dispensed during the year preceding index admission. A 30-day wash-out window prior
to index admission date was applied. Codes defining each comorbidity are provided in table
E1. In addition, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was calculated as described in table E2.
Information on discharge diagnoses were identified through the NPR, which contains
information on all reported cases of inpatient care and/or visits to a physician at a specialised
outpatient clinic in Sweden. The validity of the register is generally high with positive
predictive values of 85% to 95% for most diagnoses in validation studies.17
Data on drugs dispensed were obtained from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register (held by
NBHW), which contains all prescribed and pharmacy-dispensed medicines in the community
classified according to the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC). It
has almost complete coverage (data missing <1%).18

Information on care dependency (nursing home resident or homecare) prior to admission was
obtained from the Care and Social Services for the Elderly and for Persons with Impairments
Register (held by NBHW). Date and country of birth were obtained from the NPR.
Data on Simplified Acute Physiology, version 3 (SAPS3), oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2),
treatments and procedures on the ICU were obtained from the Swedish Intensive Care
Registry. For SAPS3 and PaO2/FiO2, information from the first admission only was used. If a

patient had several ICU admissions, treatment information was retrieved for all episodes of
ICU care for covid-19.

Statistical analyses
Baseline patient characteristics were tabulated by month of admission, ICU treatment and
survival outcome. Confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for proportions using the Wilson
Score interval and expressed as percentages.
Crude survival curves with 95% Hall-Wellner confidence bands were estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier estimator, plotted by month of admission with all-cause mortality as event.
Follow-up was truncated at 60 days after index admission. The log-rank test was used to test
for differences in survival between groups, with a two-sided alpha of 0.05.
Furthermore, percentage mortalities were plotted by month of admission, overall, by age
groups (<60, 60-69, 70-79, ≥80), sex, and healthcare region.
Incident number of covid-19 patients admitted to hospital per day was plotted by index
admission date for the whole patient cohort as well as separately for ICU, using the first
occurring ICU admission date for a patient. The number of covid-19 patients residing in
hospital care per day was also calculated, again showing one curve for the overall cohort and
one for the ICU treated cohort separately. Lines were smoothed using a seven-day rolling
average, based on three days prior-three days after admission.
Relative risk (RR) with 95% CI was estimated in multivariable analysis for the outcome 60day mortality with month of hospitalisation as exposure of interest, using modified Poisson
regression models.19 Estimates of RR were obtained from three models: Model 1 adjusted for
age (continuous, both a linear and quadratic term), sex (male/female), CCI (categorical, 0, 12, 3-4, 5+), care dependency (nursing home, homecare, neither), country of birth
(Sweden/other), and healthcare region (North, Uppsala-Örebro, Stockholm-Gotland,
Southeast, West, and South). Model 2 additionally included an interaction term between
month of admission and healthcare region. Model 3 estimated age as a categorical variable
(<60, 60-69, 70-79, ≥80) for increased interpretability, and included an interaction term
between month of admission and age group.

Model 1 was also stratified between ICU admission or not during the hospital episode. In
cases of ICU care, the SAPS3 score (continuous) for the first ICU episode was added, creating
Model 4.
In all regression models, missing data were handled by complete case analysis. Data were
complete on all variables except for country of birth and CCI (5% missing) and SAPS3 (<1%
missing). Sensitivity analyses were performed comparing adjusted RR when imputing
missing country of birth to ‘Sweden’ or ‘Outside Sweden’, and when imputing missing CCI
to extreme values ‘0’ or ‘5+’.
All data management and statistical analyses were performed using SAS Software SAS

Results
Study Population
Altogether, 15 761 patients admitted for covid-19 in Swedish hospitals were studied, median
age 64 years (interquartile range, 51 to 78 years), 57.5% men and 42.5% women. Fig 2 shows
the number of new hospital admissions and the total numbers of in-patients on each time
point. The peak numbers of patients admitted and in hospital care occurred during April. The
proportion of patients admitted to ICU was 14.4% (95% CI, 13.9% to 15.0%).

Patient characteristics, stratified according to month of admission, are shown in table 1. The
proportion of men decreased from 60.1% (95% CI, 58.1% to 62.1%) in March to 54.2% (95%
CI, 52.4% to 56.1%) in June. Age distribution changed over time with the number of patients
< 40 years and > 90 years increasing between March and June. The proportion of patients
with a CCI of zero was 58.1% (95% CI, 56.1% to 60.1%) in March and 63.7% (95% CI,
61.9% to 65.5%) in June. In March 42.2% (95% CI, 40.2% to 44.2%) of patients were born
outside Sweden compared to 33.7% (95% CI 32.0% to 35.5%) in June.
The duration of hospital stay is presented in table E3. The duration was clearly longer for
patients admitted to ICU than for those not, but there was no clear change in duration over
time.

Overall mortality
The overall 60-day mortality was 17.8% (95% CI, 17.2% to 18.4%), it was 25.5% (95% CI,
23.7% to 27.3%) among patients admitted to ICU and 16.5% (95% CI, 15.8% to 17.1%)
among patients not admitted to ICU. Table 2 shows patient characteristics for survivors and
non-survivors at 60-day follow-up, stratified according to patients admitted or not admitted to
ICU during hospital stay.

Changes in Mortality Over Time
Fig 3 shows that the overall 60-day mortality decreased from 24.7% (95% CI, 23.0% to
26.5%) in March to 13.3% (95% CI, 12.1% to 14.7%) in June. Likewise, it decreased from
36.1% (95% CI, 31.8% to 40.6%) to 20.1% (95% CI, 16.0% to 24.9%) for patients admitted
to ICU, and from 21.9% (95% CI, 20.1% to 23.9%) to 12.5% (95% CI, 11.3% to 13.9%) for
patients not admitted to ICU.

Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed mortality differences according to month of admission, with
a log-rank p-value <0.001 for both non-ICU and ICU treated patients (fig 4). The survival
curves showed a higher initial mortality rate for the March cohort than for the other months of
admission, most clearly so for those admitted to ICU.

In multivariable regression analyses, the decrease in mortality remained throughout the study
period with an adjusted relative risk (RR) of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.51 to 0.63) in June, using March
as reference. Adjusted mortality, with March as reference, decreased in patients not treated on
ICU with RR 0.60 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.67), and in patients treated on ICU with RR 0.61 (95%

CI, 0.48 to 0.79) (fig 5, fig E1-E3). Sensitivity analysis showed no impact on results when
imputing missing data on country of birth as “Sweden or outside Sweden” and with CCI as
either of the two extreme values.

Fig E4-E6 show changes in mortality over time for age categories, sex, and healthcare
regions. Tables E4-E5 show the relative risks from model 3 and 4, i.e. per month of admission
separately by healthcare region and age respectively. There was a significant interaction both
for age group and healthcare region (Joint test p<0.001). In the healthcare regions, the overall
mortality in March ranged from 15.0% to 28.0%. The decline in mortality was most
pronounced in the healthcare region with the highest initial mortality, i.e. Stockholm-Gotland,
which also had the highest number of covid-19 cases/population (table E4 and E6, fig E6). In
June, the overall mortality ranged from 10.3% to 15.3% in 5 healthcare regions, although it
was 19.1% in one healthcare region (North).

Change in variables over time among patients admitted to ICU
As shown in fig 6, the proportion of patients admitted to ICU decreased from 19.5% (95% CI,
17.9% to 21.0%) in the March cohort to 11.0% (95% CI, 9.9% to 12.2%) in the June cohort,
and the overall proportion receiving invasive mechanical ventilation decreased from 16.8%
(95% CI, 15.4% to 18.4%) to 6.4% (95% CI, 5.6% to 7.4%). Table 3 presents characteristics
over time of patients admitted to ICU. The proportion of ICU patients receiving invasive
mechanical ventilation decreased from 86.5% to 58.6% and the proportion receiving dialysis
decreased from 22.8% to 13.8%, while the proportion of patients treated in the prone position
increased in April and May compared to March. However, SAPS3 and PaO2/FiO2 on ICU
admission remained unchanged during the study period.

Discussion
The present nationwide study on patients hospitalised for covid-19 in Sweden showed a
distinct gradual decline in 60-day mortality between March and June both for non-ICU treated
and ICU treated patients. The results were stable after adjustment for pre-existing conditions,
age, sex, level of care dependency, country of birth, healthcare region, and SAPS3 (ICU
treated patients).

The mortalities of 17.9% among hospitalised covid-19 patients overall and 25.5% among ICU
treated covid-19 patients were low compared to reported mortalities from other countries, i.e.
≥ 20%2-5 and > 34%,2,6-8 respectively. Reasons for differences in outcome are difficult to
analyse since studies use different outcome definitions, provide different patient
characteristics, and often include patients that are still treated in hospital. Importantly, the
time period of inclusion is probably crucial for the overall mortality and for differences
between studies, since the mortality has clearly been changing over time. In the present study,
the overall 60-day mortality declined from 24.7% in March to 13.3% in June, it declined from
36.1% to 20.1% among ICU treated patients, and from 21.9% to 12.5% among non-ICU
treated patients. However, as noted in fig E6, the mortality dynamics over time varied
between the Swedish healthcare regions. The reasons for these variations are not known, but a
number of factors may have contributed to those and to the overall decline in mortality.

First, improvements of management and care have probably been of great importance for the
declining mortality. For instance, the present study shows that even though acute severity of
illness (SAPS3) among ICU-treated patients remained unchanged over time, the proportion of
patients managed in the prone position increased, and the proportion receiving invasive
mechanical ventilation decreased (table 3).
During the study period the drug therapy of patients with covid-19 changed continuously. In
March 2020, many covid-19 patients in Sweden received off-label treatment with chloroquine
phosphate/hydroxychloroquine,21 until this use was stopped by the European Medicines
Agency on April 1. However, this use may not have affected outcome, since a randomised
control trial (RCT) by Horby et al.22 found that patients treated with hydroxychloroquine had
similar mortality as those receiving standard of care treatment. In March and early April,
publications showed that anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
was associated with a better prognosis23 and that thromboembolic events occurred despite
standard doses thromboprophylaxis.24 Accordingly, high-dose LMWH treatment became
standard in Swedish ICUs in April. We are still awaiting the results of ongoing RCT of
LMWH at different doses (NCT04345848; NCT04344756)25, so we do not yet know the
impact of high-dose LMWH on outcome. Corticosteroids became standard care for covid-19
patients requiring oxygen therapy after June 16, when the RECOVERY RCT showed survival
benefits from corticosteroids.26 Prior to that, corticosteroids were predominantly used on the
ICU, and their use increased over the study period (table 3). However, the infrequent use of

corticosteroid treatment in March-May suggests that corticosteroids were unlikely to be a
major cause for the decline in mortality among ICU patients.

Second, the high load of new admissions and of patients in hospital care for covid-19 in
March and April (fig 2) may have contributed to the high initial mortality. This notion is
supported by the result from healthcare region Stockholm-Gotland, which had the highest
number of new covid-19 admissions/population in March-April (table E4) and also the
clearest decline in mortality (fig E6).

Third, the decline in mortality may have been due to a change in the selection of covid-19
patients for hospital care. Among hospitalised covid-19 patients in the present study, the
proportion admitted to ICU and receiving invasive mechanical ventilation decreased
substantially over time (fig 6). In addition, the proportion of patients without comorbidity
(CCI zero) increased significantly over time. These aspects indicate that the overall
hospitalised covid-19 population was gradually less severely ill. This explanation is supported
by an Italian study of covid-19 patients diagnosed in the emergency department between
March and May, showing that the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract
gradually decreased and the proportion of patients requiring ICU care decreased over time.27

Fourth, the decline in mortality could perhaps be due to changes in virulence of the SARSCoV-2 virus. Young et al.28 showed that a major deletion in the SARS-CoV-2 genome was
associated with milder infection.28 Among 521 virus strains in Sweden with complete
genome sequences, 19 different SARS-CoV-2 strain sequences were identified, 11 of
which were identified in strains collected in March only.29 It will be important to investigate if
the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 strains in May and June had an inherent reduced virulence
or had undergone genetic changes that reduced virulence.

The results of the present study, showing declining mortality over time in both non-ICU
treated and ICU treated patients, combined with some previous studies showing declining
mortality among ICU treated patients8,12, shed new light on covid-19 mortality and enables a
more appropriate evaluation of the management of the pandemic. For instance, in studies
using mortality as endpoint, the timing of inclusion may play a crucial role regarding
outcome. The results of before-and-after studies on specific interventions should thus be

interpreted with caution. The impact of an intervention during a high-mortality period does
not necessarily apply to the same intervention during a period with significantly lower
mortality. This is important when planning for allocation of healthcare resources to meet the
next phases of the pandemic.

The present study has a number of strengths. First, it was a nationwide study including all
hospitals in Sweden, minimising risk of selection bias. Second, it was based on national
registers with standardised reporting on a national level, minimising bias of ascertainment.
The unique national personal identification number of all Swedish residents enabled crosslinkage of registers at the individual level. Third, the inclusion of both non-ICU treated and
ICU treated patients enabled analyses of the full nationwide cohort of hospitalised covid-19
patients. Fourth, the use of 60-day mortality provided a robust outcome measure with a
follow-up long enough to enable hospital discharge of most patients.

The study also has limitations. First, clinical data regarding organ function were not available
for non-ICU treated patients. Thus, it was not possible to determine degree of respiratory
failure within the whole cohort. Second, data on do-not-resuscitate orders were not available
and thus, it is not known if criteria for admission to ICU changed with time. However, SAPS3
scores on ICU admission were constant throughout the study period, indicating that the
criteria for ICU admission had probably not changed considerably. Third, we did not have
access to data on drug therapy on wards during hospital stay, and thus we could not
appropriately assess the impact of different drug therapy for outcome. Fourth, the NPR lacks
information from primary care, hence the CCI may be underestimated. However, replacing
CCI with the individual comorbidities measured from both the NPR and the Prescribed Drug
Register (thus catching primary care) in the models did not attenuate RR estimates further
(not shown).

In conclusion, there was a distinct gradual decline in mortality for both non-ICU treated and
ICU treated hospitalised covid-19 patients. Future studies are needed to address and explain
this decline. The changing covid-19 mortality should be considered when the management
and results of studies from the first pandemic wave are evaluated.
