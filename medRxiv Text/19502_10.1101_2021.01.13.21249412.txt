Abstract

22

Controlling the course of the COVID-19 pandemic will require widespread deployment

23

of consistent and accurate diagnostic testing of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Ideally, tests

24

should detect a minimum viral load, be minimally invasive, and provide a rapid and simple

25

readout. Current FDA-approved RT-qPCR-based standard diagnostic approaches require

26

invasive nasopharyngeal swabs and involve laboratory-based analyses that can delay results.

27

Recently, a loop mediated isothermal nucleic acid amplification (LAMP) test that utilizes

28

colorimetric readout received FDA approval. This approach utilizes a pH indicator dye to detect

29

drop in pH from nucleotide hydrolysis during nucleic acid amplification. This method has only

30

been approved for use with RNA extracted from clinical specimens collected via nasopharyngeal

31

swabs. In this study, we developed a quantitative LAMP-based strategy to detect SARS-CoV-2

32

RNA in saliva. Our detection system distinguished positive from negative sample types using a

33

handheld instrument that monitors optical changes throughout the LAMP reaction. We used this

34

system in a streamlined LAMP testing protocol that could be completed in less than two hours to

35

directly detect inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in minimally processed saliva that bypassed RNA

36

extraction, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 50 genomes/reaction. The quantitative method

37

correctly detected virus in 100% of contrived clinical samples spiked with inactivated SARS-

38

CoV-2 at either 1X (50 genomes/reaction) or 2X (100 genomes/reaction) of the LOD.

39

Importantly the quantitative method was based on dynamic optical changes during the reaction

40

so was able to correctly classify samples that were misclassified by endpoint observation of

41

color.

Introduction

45
46

Widespread deployment of rapid, accurate diagnostics is one of several key requirements

47

for blunting the COVID-19 pandemic. Ideal tests are minimally invasive, requiring little or no

48

sample preparation steps, and can be conducted on-site with a rapid and simple readout of a test

49

outcome. However, the standard diagnostic approach requires an RNA extraction step from a

50

nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and subsequent Reverse Transcription-quantitative Polymerase Chain

51

Reaction (RT-qPCR). The invasiveness of the collection procedure often causes patient

52

discomfort, reducing enthusiasm for regular retesting. Swab samples must then be stored in a

53

viral transport medium (VTM) to stabilize the virus until the sample can be analyzed, usually

54

after shipping to off-site laboratories. Furthermore, RNA extraction and RT-PCR analysis

55

require specialized equipment and clinical laboratory training that are not easily adaptable to

56

near-patient analysis. Finally, slow sample processing and nucleic acid amplification procedures

57

cannot be significantly streamlined to facilitate rapid detection.

58

Testing saliva for RNA of respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to have

59

high agreement in performance and sensitivity to approved RT-qPCR based tests of NP swab-

60

based molecular tests.1–3 Isothermal analogs to PCR such as loop-mediated isothermal

61

amplification (LAMP) can be implemented with comparatively simple and low-power equipment

62

4–6

63

as few as five copies of template molecules per reaction.7 LAMP specifically is commonly

64

observed to be more robust than equivalent qPCR assays to inhibitors in clinical samples, so that

65

accurate results can be obtained even with rudimentary sample preparation (i.e. just add sample

66

mixed with extraction buffer).8–10 Even so, as of December, 2020, less than 3% of all

and has proven to reliably amplify synthetic SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA from samples with

67

commercially available diagnostics with regulatory approval used for SARS-CoV-2 detection in

68

the Unites States FDA, European Union and Asia utilize isothermal technology.11

69

The colorimetric SARS-CoV-2 LAMP diagnostic assay developed by COLOR was one

70

of the first of these isothermal assays to receive Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the

71

FDA.12 In this assay pyrophosphate hydrolyzed during a positive amplification event lowers the

72

pH of the reaction buffer containing phenol red indicator, resulting in an observable change in

73

color.13 This assay has proven to have a low false negative rate when used in conjunction with

74

purified gamma-irradiated virus and purified viral clinical samples.12 While other FDA-EUA

75

approved isothermal based methods have received FDA approval when used for serum or

76

respiratory samples (i.e. nasopharyngeal swabs),14–16 approvals for direct detection in saliva have

77

lagged behind no matter the molecular basis of the test. While SARS-CoV-2 RNA is as stable in

78

saliva as it is in VTM,1,17 the effects of saliva on direct LAMP detection is poorly understood and

79

VTM can interfere with the colorimetric readout.18 For example, variations in pH and buffering

80

capacity of individual saliva samples can confound results of pH-dependent assays such as

81

colorimetric LAMP, especially if relying on visual classification of endpoint color.

82

To date, the use of a colorimetric LAMP assay with clinical saliva samples has not been

83

reported. Applications of isothermal amplification to detect SARS-CoV-2 have utilized

84

commercially available polymerase enzyme mixes that contain nucleotides, Tris pH buffer, and

85

Tween detergent. Additional studies have optimized amplification efficiency of genomic RNA

86

from whole-virus samples resuspended in water by supplementing commercial reaction mixes

87

with guanidinium chloride,19 Tris-EDTA (TE) and Tween-20.20 Detection sensitivity of whole

88

virus has been further optimized by pre-incubating viral samples at 95°C to denature the viral

89

capsid before adding samples to a LAMP reaction mix.21–23 Sample processing protocols have not

Quantitative analysis of colorimetric-luminance readout

115
116
117

Instrumentation
For real-time monitoring and quantitative detection of colorimetric LAMP assays we

118

customized a handheld, battery-powered, fluorescence-based instrument with a heating block

119

accommodating a strip of 8 PCR tubes (BioRanger™, Diagenetix Inc., Honolulu, HI, USA; Fig.

120

1A). The instrument interfaces to a companion Android app to monitor changes in color of the

121

reaction mix. The modifications made to the device were removal of emission filters, and

122

attenuation of raw signal by a combination of placing a diffuser over the photodiode detectors

123

and electrically lowering their transimpedance gains. The resulting luminance signal (L) in

124

arbitrary units (a.u.) results from scattering and reflections of excitation light not absorbed by the

125

sample. Changes in the luminance in the dynamically monitored system correspond primarily to

126

changes in absorbance of light by the sample. For sample illumination we tested three different

127

color LEDs (Luxeon Rebel Color Line, Lumileds Ltd., San Jose, CA): blue (part number LXML-

128

PB01-0040); green (part number LXML-PM01-0100), and; amber (part number LXML-PL01-

129

0040). Preliminary experiments (Supplementary Fig. S0) indicated that the green LEDs resulted

130

in features in positive amplification curves that were identifiable earlier in the reactions than

131

curves from other colors, and which could also be used for more definitive reaction

132

classification. Based on these preliminary results we used green channel for monitoring reactions

133

reported in this study, using quantitative analysis of amplification curves as described below.

134

Calibration of the instrument was made with representative endpoint reactions with negative

Processing Luminance Data

139

For detailed analysis of experimental reactions described in this manuscript we used the

140

raw “luminance” data from files generated automatically in the BioRanger app. Unless otherwise

141

stated, all values were shifted to start at “zero” luminance by subtracting the initial (t = 0

142

minutes) raw luminance value from every raw value. These baseline corrected luminance values

143

(L) were smoothed using a 2nd order polynomial with a rolling average of 4 adjacent data points.

144

The maximum values of luminance derivatives (L’) for each assay were identified from

145

derivative data (identified using forward difference and smoothed again with a 2nd order

146

polynomial with 4 neighbors) using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA,

147

USA).

New England BioLabs,24 targeting the envelope (E1) and nucleocapsid (N2) genes of the SAR-

154

CoV-2 viral genome (GenBank accession number MN908947), were tested individually and in

155

combination. For the final contrived clinical evaluation an internal control (IC) primer set that

156

amplifies human b-actin “housekeeping” gene (ACTB) was used to detect the presence of

157

inhibitors in saliva samples. Primers were synthesized commercially (Integrated DNA

Technologies / IDT, Coralville, Iowa) using standard desalting and resuspended in nuclease free

159

water. For each primer set an individual 10X primer stock was prepared so that adding 2.5 µL of

160

each stock to a LAMP reaction yielded the following final primer concentrations in both

161

fluorescent and colorimetric LAMP assays: 0.2 µM F3/B3, 1.6 µM FIP/BIP and 0.8 µM LB/LF.

162

For LAMP assays containing dual primer sets targeting both the E and N gene of SARS-CoV-2

163

genome, 2.5 µL of each 10X stock were added to each reaction mixture.

164
165
166

Colorimetric LAMP Assay
All colorimetric assays contained 12.5 µL WarmStart® RT-Colorimetric 2X Master Mix

167

(DNA & RNA, M1800, New England Biolabs, MA, USA), 2.5 µL primer mix (10X) stock of

168

each primer set used (E1, N2 or ACTB), either 2 µL or 5 µL of sample and appropriate volumes

169

of nuclease free water to make a total volume of 25 µL per reaction. After loading LAMP

170

reagents and test samples a drop (~ 20 µL) of sterile mineral oil was added to each reaction tube

171

(excluding some of the negative controls in preliminary evaluation) and closed, followed by brief

172

centrifugation of the 8-assay tube strip.

173

For reactions containing guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl molecular grade, J7582322,

174

ThermoFischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), 1.25 µL of GuHCl stock (0.8 M) was

175

substituted for the equivalent volume of nuclease free water to achieve a final reaction

176

concentration of 40 mM GuHCl. Stock GuHCl solution was prepared in deionized water and

177

adjusted to pH 8.0 with 1 M KOH (90% reagent grade, 484016, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,

178

USA) and filter sterilized (0.22 µM 13 mm Whatman filter, 99091302, MilliporeSigma, St.

All real-time colorimetric assays were carried out in 0.2 mL reaction tubes (TempAssure,

181

Optical Caps, USA Scientific Inc., Orlando, FL, USA) in a modified 8-well isothermal amplifier

182

platform (BioRanger). Amplification progress was logged every 30 seconds for a maximum of

183

40 minutes. At the end of the assay the closed tube strip was briefly placed on ice and a

184

photograph was taken using a cell phone camera. The colorimetric master mix contains a phenol

185

186

manufacturers (NEB) protocols25 as follows: negative reactions remain pink while successful

Fluorescent LAMP Assay
Fluorescent LAMP assays were performed in parallel to most colorimetric assays under

191

the same experimental and assay conditions except fluorescent assays included 0.5 µL

192

fluorescent dye (50X, E1700S, New England Biolabs). Assays were performed in either a) 0.2

193

mL reaction tubes (TempAssure, Optical Caps, USA Scientific Inc., Orlando, FL, USA) in an

194

unmodified 8-well isothermal amplifier platform (BioRanger™, Diagenetix Inc., Honolulu, HI,

195

USA) or b) 0.1 mL reaction tubes (TempAssure, Optical Caps, USA Scientific Inc., Orlando, FL,

196

USA) in a real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosciences StepOnePlus™). Both instruments were

197

programmed for isothermal incubation at 65°C for 31 minutes. Fluorescence values

198

corresponding to fluorescein were recorded every minute during the 31-minute reactions in the

199

StepOnePlus™ PCR machine, and every 30 seconds in the BioRanger isothermal amplifier. For

200

the BioRanger, threshold times (tT) of positively classified reactions are reported as the time at

201

which the maximum rate of fluorescence increase occurs, to control for variations in reaction

202

intensity and fluorescence sensitivity between channels. For the StepOnePlus™ PCR machine,

Controls and Standards
For preliminary assay optimization and characterization, positive control (PC) standards

211

containing 5.25 – 5,250 ge/ 5 µL were prepared daily by dissolving synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA

212

from frozen stock in nuclease free deionized water, whereas negative controls (NC) did not

213

contain target template RNA. For contrived clinical sample testing reactive controls (RC)

214

containing 5 x 103 ge/mL – 1.0 x 106 ge/mL in the primary sample were prepared by spiking

Quantitative Classification of Results from Luminance Data
To identify features in luminance curves that consistently differentiated positive and

231

negative colorimetric LAMP reactions, we considered simple quantitative metrics from

232

amplification data recorded on the modified BioRanger device assaying RNA standards in water.

233

The value of each metric for discriminating the binary populations was evaluated in a

234

commercial software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) using unpaired t-test assuming

235

equal variances.

236

Based on these preliminary results, Reactions were classified based on the value of the

237

peak luminance derivative L' (a.u./min.), as strong peaks are consistent with sigmoidal

238

amplification characteristic of qPCR or LAMP. Classification thresholds were empirically

239

derived from baseline measurements of controls standards without viral RNA. The threshold for

240

positive classification was determined as the value excluding at least 99.9% of negative controls

241

(for standards in water prepared with viral RNA) or non-reactive controls (for contrived clinical

242

samples in saliva) based on observed means and sample standard deviations using a one-tailed t-

243

statistic. The LOD for colorimetric assay in standards or contrived clinical samples in the

244

modified instrument was defined as the lowest concentration (ge/mL) where all replicates were

245

positively detected by this metric.

Saliva Collection
Approximately 1-3 mL of saliva was collected from healthy individual volunteers in 15

253

mL conical tubes (352196, FalconTM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Donors

254

were asked to not eat or drink anything other than water before saliva was collected. Saliva

255

samples were collected fresh on the mornings of experimentation and stored at 4 ºC until

256

processed. On the day of each experiment saliva samples were spiked with known quantities of

257

inactivated (gamma-irradiated) SARS-CoV-2 virus following protocols described in this section.

Standardized Processing and Assay of Contrived Clinical Samples
In the absence of known positive COVID-19 clinical samples, we followed the Federal

261

Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) guidance for molecular diagnostic development for

262

Emergency Use Authorization28 and validated the sensitivity and accuracy of the colorimetric

263

LAMP assay using contrived clinical samples. Saliva collected from three healthy donors

264

presumed to be free of SARS-CoV-2 virus was pooled and spiked with inactivated gamma

265

irradiated SARS-CoV-2. Spiked saliva samples were heat inactivated in a dry bath at 95 ºC for

266

30 minutes, allowed to cool to room temperature then stored on ice until downstream processing.

267

100 µL of each treated 1 mL spiked sample was combined with an equal volume (1:1) of

268

stabilization buffer containing 1X TE (10 mM Tris, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8, IDT) and 1% Tween-

269

20 for a final sample concentration of 0.5X TE and 0.5% Tween-20. 2 µL of each sample was

270

added directly to the colorimetric LAMP reaction mix for detection of the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene

using the N2 primer set only. Reactions were analyzed by real-time colorimetric LAMP (65°C,

273

reactions.

275

Validation in contrived clinical samples

276
277

Ten individual saliva specimens were collected from healthy donors and evaluated for the

278

real-time quantitative SARS-CoV-2 colorimetric LAMP assay. One milliliter of each of the 10

279

specimens was spiked with gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 to produce five contrived positive

280

clinical samples with a viral load at 1X the previously established LOD of 5 x 104 ge/mL

281

corresponding to 50 ge/reaction and five contrived positive samples at 2X the LOD (1 x 105

282

ge/mL) corresponding to 100 ge/reaction. Unadulterated volumes from each original specimen

283

were assayed identically to serve as a paired non-reactive sample for each contrived positive

284

clinical sample. The 20 samples (10 negative and 10 positive) were randomized and blinded and

285

processed through the entire standardized assay procedure.

286

For every saliva sample (n=20) an eight-assay diagnostic test panel was performed to

287

simultaneously test two replicates each of the test sample, internal control (IC), positive control

288

(PC) and negative control (NC). Saliva samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 N-gene and human

289

b-actin (IC). Positive controls contained 2.1 x 106 ge/reaction of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA

290

304

Fluorescent LAMP assays were used to evaluate optimal reaction conditions for assays

305

containing single and duplexed primer sets. The addition of 40 mM GuHCl to fluorescent LAMP

306

assays improved both the speed and sensitivity for the detection of synthetic RNA in spiked

307

water controls. Assays containing only the N2 primer set and guanidine hydrochloride performed

308

best overall in terms of sensitivity (~ 5.25 genome equivalents/reaction) and speed of detection

309

(mean tT = 19 minutes, Supplementary Fig. 1). The differences in the speed of detection for

310

duplexed reactions were unremarkable; E1 primers are less sensitive than the N2 primers by

311

approximately an order of magnitude in any condition. E1-primed reactions were also more

312

temperature sensitive: incubation at 68°C inhibited LAMP reactions. Colorimetric assays were

313

run ten minutes longer than fluorescent assays for a total time of 40 minutes to compensate for

314

the relatively slow color change of the phenol red indicator that has been demonstrated to take

315

forty to fifty minutes to detect single copy numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in previous

Colorimetric LAMP assays using the E1 primer set had relatively poor sensitivity and

322

slow amplification (Supplementary Fig. 1, 2A-C). In comparison assays duplexed with both E1

323

and N2 primer sets were more sensitive but resulted in relatively noisy luminance profiles

324

especially during the first five minutes of the reaction (Supplementary Fig. 2D-F). By

325

comparison assays with just the N2 primer set resulted in smooth luminance profiles and

326

detection of 5.25 ge/reaction in two out of three replicates (Fig. 1B-C). Luminance derivative

327

(L') profiles for positive standards amplified with N2 primer set had two identifiable peaks in

328

contrast to negative reactions which had relatively flat luminance profiles (Fig. 1D). We

329

subsequently chose to use the N2 primer set only in standardized reactions because of the robust

330

and clear luminance signals and sufficient performance to detect the vast majority of SARS-

331

CoV-2 positive samples based on reported saliva viral loads averaging 102-103 copies per

332

microliter.1,31

333

Under optimized assay conditions the colorimetric luminance curve of PC standards is bi-

334

phasic with two distinct exponential growth phases in the first and last half of the reaction. We

335

quantitatively evaluated two curve features, presumably associated with initial amplification and

336

subsequent color change, at time intervals where a log-linear luminance profile was observed to

337

occur in PC assays. Specifically, local maxima in rates of luminance increase (L') occur between

338

5 and 20 minutes (L'MAX1) and then again between 20 and 40 minutes (L'MAX2) (Fig. 2A). The first

339

five minutes of luminance values were excluded from consideration for L'MAX1 because noise in

340

the baseline signal was previously observed to occur early in the reaction, particularly for assays

341

containing duplexed primer sets (Supplementary Fig. 2B, 2E).

342

The luminance curves of NC assays testing N2 primers (Fig. 1) plus five NC assays from

343

other trials conducted that day testing different primers sets (Supplementary Fig. 2) were pooled

344

(n=8) and compared to PC purified RNA standards (n=13, Fig. 1C-D). L'MAX2 was the only L'-

345

maxima that significantly (P = 1.647e-006) differentiated PC from NC based on differences

346

between means (PC - NC = 5,876 a.u./min., Fig. 2B, 2C). Correspondingly our decision

347

threshold for classifying positive control RNA standards was L'MAX2 > 2764 a.u./min., the

348

approximate equivalent to the pooled average of eight negative control assays (µ=394.4

349

a.u./min.) plus 4.78 sample standard deviations (sd=495.7, t.999=4.78, dof=7, a=0.001). Using

350

this threshold, results from the colorimetric instrument are in 100% agreement with endpoint

351

visual assessment of yellow color, with both approaches detecting 3/4 assays containing 5.25

352

ge/reaction with the N2 primer set, and every positive standard with more template RNA.

353

The times corresponding to the first luminance derivative peak (L'MAX1) in the

354

colorimetric assay (10 – 20 minutes) were similar to threshold times observed in fluorescence-

355

based LAMP assays with the same primers (Fig. 2D). These results contrast sharply with

356

previous studies showing that incubation times of forty to fifty minutes are required for reliable

357

color development and end-point detection of SARS-CoV-2 colorimetric LAMP assays.12,29,32

358

This indicates that our simple instrument is able to detect subtle changes in the optical

359

characteristics of the reaction that occur before easily observable color changes. The second

360

luminance derivative peaks (L'MAX2) in our instrument are much larger than L'MAX1 and are

361

typically observed between 25-35 minutes into the reaction which is more consistent with times

Limit of detection in saliva

397

The sensitivity of the colorimetric-LAMP assay was quantitatively assessed by following

398

optimized assay protocols for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva using a handheld instrument

399

for luminance readout (Fig. 3). To reduce the impact of saliva-bound nuclease activity, we

400

supplemented the reaction buffer with Tris-EDTA (TE) to stabilize the viral genomic RNA

401

released from the capsid following heat treatment of viral samples. EDTA protects nucleic acids

402

from degradation by chelating the nuclease cofactor Mg2+ and Tris maintains a pH above 7.5, at

403

which nucleases are less active. Researchers at the University of Illinois extensively evaluated

404

cheaper alternatives to commercial sample transport buffers containing expensive and

405

proprietary viral RNA-stabilizing agents like DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research), and

406

demonstrated that TE buffer is effective at stabilizing nucleic acids for sensitive detection (500-

407

1000 viral particles per mL) by RT-qPCR.20 We similarly demonstrated that addition of TE to

heat-inactivated samples containing intact gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 improved the LOD of

409

the colorimetric assay by an order of magnitude compared to spiked samples diluted in water

410

only (Supplementary Fig. 3). Furthermore, their research suggests that extended heating of the

411

sample (i.e. 30 minutes, 95°C) inactivates inhibitors in saliva whereas standard protocols for heat

412

inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 at lower temperatures (i.e. 30 minutes, 60°C) did not allow for

413

sensitive detection. Herein spiked saliva samples are subjected to heat treatments at 95°C for 30

414

min prior to diluting the sample 1:1 with TE buffer.

415

Reactive controls (RC) containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in saliva were classified as

416

positive for detection if L'MAX2 was greater than 660 a.u./min, equivalent to the approximate

417

average (µ=86.09 a.u./min.) plus 4.78 standard deviations (sd=119.1, t.999=4.78, dof=7, a=0.001)

418

of eight non-reactive control (NRC) (Fig. 4A). Applying this classification threshold, the

419

luminance-based LOD, defined by the lowest concentration where SARS-CoV-2 is detected in

420

all replicates, is 5 x 104 ge/mL corresponding to 50 ge/reaction (Fig. 4B). Luminance

421

amplification curves for this section can be found in Supplementary Figure 4.

422

SARS-CoV-2 was detected both visually and quantitatively below the LOD (5 x 103 ge/mL –

423

2.5 x 104 ge/mL) in some replicates but at a lower rate. In some reactive samples below the LOD

424

and in reactions in which SARS-CoV-2 was not visually detected, a low-amplitude luminance

425

signal (L'MAX2 < 1,000 a.u./min) is observed in the last twenty minutes. This could indicate latent

426

target amplification and a longer reaction time could improve sensitivity of small quantities of

427

viral RNA. However longer incubation times (> 40 minutes) have shown to increase the false

428

positive rate. One NRC reaction showed a color change, however the L'MAX2 values were less

429

than 100 a.u./min. The yellow/orange NRC reaction was quantitatively classified as ‘Not

430

Detected’ reducing the initial false positive (FP) rate of visual end-point determination from

samples, 10 reactive controls containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2 at 1X and 2X the LOD (5 x

465

104 ge/mL) determined from saliva standards (Fig. 4), and 10 non-reactive controls (0 ge/mL),

466

were tested using the standardized protocol (Fig. 3). In addition to two replicate assays for the N-

467

gene, each sample was subjected to a test panel including two replicates each of an internal

468

control reaction (IC; for human b-actin), a positive control (PC; supplemented with 106

469

ge/reaction synthetic RNA), and a negative control with no sample or supplemental RNA. Each

470

individual assay of the test panel was interpreted both visually (pink = Not detected,

471

yellow/orange = Detected) as well as quantitively, using the previously established luminance

472

readout classification threshold determined from saliva standards (L'MAX2 > 660 a.u./min =

473

Detected, L'MAX2 < 660 a.u./min. = Not detected). A test panel was interpreted as ‘Detect’ if

474

SARS-CoV-2 N-gene was detected in 2/2 replicates, ‘Detected†’ for 1/2 replicates and ‘Non-

475

detect’ for 0/2 replicates. Additionally, the panel results were deemed valid if both replicates for IC

476

(2/2) and PC (2/2) were detected and neither NC (0/2) replicates were detected. Panels with any

477

unexpected outcome of control reactions is classified as ‘Inconclusive’. Examples of three test

478

panels are shown in Figure 5; detailed results for all 20 diagnostic panels are included in

479

Supplementary Figure 5, and the sample pairing key is shown in Supplementary Table 2.

480

Although the test panels were run on two colorimetry-enabled BioRanger instruments

481

over two weeks and by multiple experimenters using different batches of reagent stocks,

482

performance analysis demonstrates that the method sensitivities, specificities and accuracy to

483

quantitatively detect SARS-CoV-2 did not vary substantially. All assays that resulted in an

484

endpoint color of yellow also showed luminance signal amplification rate above decision

485

threshold values where L'MAX2 was above 660 a.u./min. (Fig. 6A). A failed color change at the

486

LOD correlated with no or low intensity luminance signals (L'MAX2 < 660). The SARS-CoV-2 N-

487

gene was detected in all test sample replicates (10/10) for saliva samples spiked with 1 x 105

488

ge/mL (2X LOD). At least one replicate tested positive for each sample with 5 x 104 ge/mL (1X

489

LOD), though not all replicates at this concentration tested positive (6/10) (Fig. 6B). SARS-

490

CoV-2 was not detected in any of the contrived negative samples (NRC). Human ACTB gene

491

was detected in all but one test panel IC (19/20 samples, 38/40 replicates).

492

Sample 1 and sample 2 (Supplementary Fig. 5) were the first panels run on the day of

493

testing and performed in parallel on two different instruments without first pre-heating the

494

incubation chamber. This resulted in significant amount of noise in all assays of Panel 1 and one

495

NRC assay of Panel 2. Panel 2 NRC assay was noisy from 0-25 minutes, resulting in an L'MAX2

496

value of 746 a.u./min. However, after inspection of the smoothed and corrected L' curve, it was

497

clear that the local maxima (L'MAX2) was an artifact due to noise and the assay was classified as

498

‘Not-detected’. Subsequently all tests were performed on pre-heated incubation blocks reaching

499

a temperature of at least 50 ºC prior to loading the reaction tubes. This phenomenon was

500

observed in preliminary experiments but not well characterized and in most cases, the luminance

501

curve corrections and smoothing were sufficient to remove noise or artifacts falsely indicating

502

amplification.

503

Panel 9 tested an NRC sample, and even though endpoint assessment of the color (light

504

orange) resulted in positive classification for both replicates, no signs of amplification were

505

observed in the luminance data. Using the real-time data, both classified correctly as negative

506

(Supplementary Fig. 5, panel 9). Similarly, one replicate of the panel 3 sample (also an NRC

507

sample) was light orange incorrectly indicating amplification based on endpoint color, though

508

the luminance data correctly showed no amplification (Supplementary Fig. 5, panel 3). In

509

contrast the internal control reactions on panel 9 showed evidence of faint and late amplification

510

in the luminance data but failed to meet threshold for positive classification, resulting in this

511

panel being inconclusive, even though the endpoint color of these internal controls was yellow

512

(positive). The N-gene was correctly detected in all positive control replicates (40/40) and not

513

detected in any of the negative control replicates (0/40) (Fig. 6A-B).

514

The L'MAX2 values provide a robust indication of nucleic acid amplification that may not

515

accompany an endpoint color change that is sensitive to variations in sample characteristics. This

516

suggests that dynamically monitoring luminescence might improve classification accuracy where

517

sample pH is too low, in addition to situations in which buffering capacity is too high to yield a

518

complete red to yellow color change. In comparison, classification based on endpoint color in

519

our panels results in a false positive rate of 10% near the LOD.

Discussion

549
550

As COVID-19 continues to surge, there is increasing need to expand points-of-care and

551

mobile testing platforms to quell the transmission of this virus. Nucleic acid amplification

552

emerged as the gold standard for detection efficiency in the early months of the pandemic

553

because this method is both highly specific and highly sensitive. Paired with an RNA isolation

554

sample-processing step, RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection assays provided the necessary

555

data for viral transmission rates and initial contact tracing. RT-PCR-based testing, while accurate

556

and sensitive, is heavily reliant on thermocycling equipment that requires a specialized

557

demand. Antibody-based detection platforms are emerging as an alternative to RT-PCR based

560

assays to meet the rising demand for rapid, point-of-care testing. While antibody-based detection

561

methods can be adapted for at-home, point-of-care detection, or mobile testing, this methodology

562

is inherently less sensitive than nucleic acid amplification-based assays.

563

Isothermal nucleic acid amplification merges the mobility of antibody-based assays with

564

the high sensitivity of RT-PCR as an efficient platform to expand COVID-19 testing. In this

565

study, we have built upon the colorimetric endpoint readout of LAMP-based testing and have

566

provided proof-of-design for a mobile platform that utilizes isothermal nucleic acid amplification

567

in conjunction with direct detection of SARS-Cov-2 from saliva. We have paired SARS-CoV-2

568

detection during isothermal nucleic acid amplification with a mobile, handheld device that

569

detects colorimetric changes during isothermal amplification similar to that of a microplate

570

reader used in previous studies.12 This method is capable of detecting purified (synthetic) SARS-

571

CoV-2 RNA template within an order of magnitude of single particle detection (5.25

572

genomes/reaction) therefore comparable to the theoretical maximum sensitivity of other RT-

573

PCR-based approaches as well as other LAMP-based SARS-CoV-2 detection designs.

574

COLOR initially received FDA approval for merging LAMP-based testing with a

575

colorimetric endpoint readout that streamlined detection and circumvented the need for highly

576

specialized diagnostic equipment. The majority of FDA-approved LAMP-based assays have only

577

been authorized for samples that have first undergone RNA purification. In order to develop a

578

direct-detection assay from saliva samples that can vary in pH, nucleic acid amplification and pH

579

change must be measured independently. Previous studies have examined the accuracy and

580

sensitivity of endpoint colorimetric changes indirectly by conducting parallel experiments with

581

real-time fluorescent-based assays.13,33,34 These approaches, however, cannot directly verify

582

whether a colorimetric readout corresponds to amplification or a spurious pH change. This

583

indirect approach has hindered progress towards developing a direct-detection assay from saliva

584

samples. Our approach, however, provides a platform to independently measure both nucleic

585

acid amplification and colorimetric endpoint readout for every sample and provide a means to

586

determine whether SARS-CoV-2 can be detected directly from saliva.

587

Using a commercial BioRanger, the time course of the initial luminance derivative peak,

588

L'MAX1, corresponded to the time to the threshold of detection for fluorescent-based LAMP

589

assays, while the time course of the second luminance derivative peak, L'MAX2, corresponded to

590

the times reported to be required for endpoint color change. These data indicate that our method

591

can detect subtle optical changes at the initiation of LAMP amplification, perhaps due to

592

increased scattering from small particulates of magnesium pyrophosphate, as well as more

593

intense optical changes later in the reaction corresponding to transition of pH through the pKa of

594

the phenol red indicator. The modified BioRanger, therefore, provides an ideal platform for

595

evaluating whether a LAMP-based assay can be implemented for the direct detection of SARS-

596

Cov-2 from saliva.

597

Direct detection of viral particles from saliva can present a host of additional

598

complications. In addition to fluctuations in pH that can destabilize the viral capsid or cause a

599

spurious color change, saliva contains nucleases that can degrade the viral genome, reducing the

600

amount of virus that can be detected by LAMP. Previous work has shown that encapsulated

601

SARS-CoV-2 is stable in saliva 20,35,36 and isothermal nucleic acid amplification efficiency is

602

enhanced when the heat-inactivated saliva matrix is buffered with TE and Tween 20. Processing

603

samples in this way, we implemented a low-cost alternative to VTM that was completely

604

compatible with both luminance detection and endpoint colorimetric detection of isothermal

605

amplification of SARS-Cov-2 nucleic acid.

606
607
608

Future Implementation
Through the assay that we developed in this study, we were able to directly detect

609

inactivated SARS-CoV-2 from saliva with an LOD of 50 genomes/reaction. This detection

610

sensitivity is similar to a previously-described LAMP-based SARS-CoV-2 direct detection assay

611

used in conjunction with nasopharygeal samples stabilized in VTM.37 In October of 2020,

612

COLOR’s rapid LAMP test was deployed at the San Francisco International airport for onsite

613

passenger testing as one of the “Trusted Testing and Travel Partners” in Hawaii’s pre-travel

614

COVID-19 testing program developed to encourage safe travel, tourism and re-opening of the

615

economy. The methods presented here can be adapted in a similar way to provide real-time

616

monitoring as a companion diagnostic to colorimetric endpoint detection of SARS-CoV-2

617

amplification from easy-to-collect saliva samples. This approach has the potential to reduce the

618

cost and invasive nature of COVID-19 testing and can be broadly applied to point of care

619

detection in field surveillance programs or in remote clinical settings.
