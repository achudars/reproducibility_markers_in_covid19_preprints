Abstract
The current COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2,
disproportionally affects the elderly and people with comorbidities like obesity and associated type
2 diabetes mellitus. Small animal models are crucial for the successful development and validation
of antiviral vaccines, therapies and to study the role that comorbidities have on the outcome of
viral infections. The initially available SARS-CoV-2 isolates require adaptation in order to use the
mouse angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (mACE-2) entry receptor and to productively infect the
cells of the murine respiratory tract. We have “mouse-adapted" SARS-CoV-2 by serial passaging
a clinical virus isolate in the lungs of mice. We then used low doses of this virus in mouse models
for advanced age, diabetes and obesity. Similar to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, the outcome
of infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 resulted in enhanced morbidity in aged and diabetic
obese mice. Mutations associated with mouse adaptation occurred in the S, M, N and ORF8 genes.
Interestingly, one mutation in the receptor binding domain of the S protein results in the change of
an asparagine to tyrosine residue at position 501 (N501Y). This mutation is also present in the
newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses reported in the U.K. (20B/501Y.V1, B1.1.7 lineage)
that is epidemiologically associated with high human to human transmission. We show that human
convalescent and post vaccination sera can neutralize the newly emerging N501Y virus variant
with similar efficiency as that of the reference USA-WA1/2020 virus, suggesting that current
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will protect against the 20B/501Y.V1 strain.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the present
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic which has claimed hundreds of thousands of
lives with the death toll still rising. The virus belongs to the family Coronaviridae and genera
Betacoronaviruses which consists of a single stranded, positive sense ~30kB RNA as genome. The
genome encodes for four structural proteins – nucleoprotein (NP), spike (S), envelope (E) and
membrane (M) proteins. The S protein of the virus plays an integral part in viral fusion and entry
into host cells. The homotrimeric S protein consists of S1 and S2 subunits. The receptor binding
domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) present on
the host cellular surfaces. The interaction is followed by S2-driven-transcleavage of the S protein
by cellular metalloproteases such as TMPRSS2, thereby facilitating an efficient fusion and release
of viral contents into the host cell (1). Since the RBD domain is necessary for direct interaction
with the host receptor, mutations in RBD can affect SARS-CoV-2 infection efficiency depending
on the host. As the RBD is also the target of virus-neutralizing antibodies, mutations in RBD can
impact the neutralizing titers of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies.
The virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets and causes a diverse array of symptoms
from completely asymptomatic infections to fever, cough, anosmia, pneumonia, acute respiratory
distress syndrome, microvascular coagulation, multi-organ dysfunction and other severe
manifestations -including death- in humans. Several predisposition factors have been found to be
associated with increased susceptibility to severe COVID-19. Hypertension, cardiovascular
diseases, gender, advanced age and obesity have already been defined as major risk factors among
humans attributing to increased mortality by enhancing secondary conditions such as hypoxemia
and pneumonia (2–7). In order to study SARS-CoV-2-associated comorbidities, there is a need for
small animal models in which pulmonary inflammation, lung lesions and histopathology after
SARS-CoV-2 infection can be investigated. The RBD of the S protein from the SARS-CoV-2
strain that started the pandemic does not efficiently bind mouse ACE-2 (mACE-2, a murine
ortholog of human-ACE-2) (8) and as a consequence this SARS-CoV-2 strain does not efficiently
infect laboratory mouse strains efficiently. Several approaches have been developed to allow the
use of mouse models for SARS-CoV-2 research (9–11), often guided by the experience obtained
previously for mouse models to study SARS-CoV. Many of these models rely on transgenic mice
that express hACE-2 in epithelial cells or sensitize mice to SARS-CoV-2 infection by adenovirusmediated transduction of the hACE-2 gene (Ad-hACE-2) in the respiratory tract (9,12). These
models have been crucial for studying host-pathogen interactions, prophylactic and therapeutic
interventions in the context of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, a major
drawback of these models is that expression of hACE-2 is often driven by a promoter that is not
the original ACE-2 promoter, and therefore promoter control and expression patterns can differ
and, in the case of Ad-hACE-2, depend on transduction efficiency. These problems would be
circumvented by a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (MA-SARS-CoV-2) that uses the endogenously
expressed mACE-2. Moreover, a MA-SARS-CoV-2 can be used with already established mouse
models of the comorbidities associated with more severe COVID-19 and allows the efficient
exploiting of the genetic toolboxes available for mice.
In this study, we have developed and characterized a MA-SARS-CoV-2 strain after serially
passaging a clinical virus isolate (USA-WA1/2020) first in immune-compromised followed by
immune-competent mice. We mapped mutations associated with mouse adaptation in the SARSCoV-2 genome and observed that one of them is the N501Y mutation in the RBD from the spike
protein that was also reported for the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant (20B/501Y.V1 strain)

with potentially enhanced human transmission potential. This mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain
with N501Y mutation causes enhanced morbidity in mouse models for advanced age, obesity and
obesity-associated type 2 diabetes mellitus. Finally, we show that human sera from convalescent
and vaccinated individuals can neutralize both the reference USA-WA1/2020 strain and the mouse
adapted strain that contains the N501Y spike mutation with similar efficiency.

Materials and Methods
Reagents:
All chemicals for synthesis were purchased from Thermofisher, unless noted otherwise. Horse
radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody was purchased from Abcam
(ab6823). Anti-mouse SARS-CoV-2 NP (NP1C7C7) and anti-mouse SARS-CoV-2 spike
(2BCE5) antibodies were obtained from Center for Therapeutic Antibody Development at Icahn
School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York. Antibodies used in Western blot were anti-mouseACE-2 (R&D, MAB3437), anti-beta-tubulin (Sigma Aldrich, T8328) and anti-mouse (HRPconjugated, KwikQuant).
Cell lines:
Vero-E6 cells (ATTC-CRL 1586, clone E6) are routinely cultured in the laboratory and were
maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS, Hyclone), penicillin/streptomycin and 1% non-essential amino acids. Mouse ACE-2
(mACE-2) expressing Vero-E6 cells were established by transducing Vero-E6 cells with a
lentiviral vector expressing mACE-2 and a puromycin resistance gene (supplementary figure S1).
Cells were selected as a polyclonal population by puromycin selection and mACE-2 expression
was confirmed by Western blot.
Mouse models for comorbidities:
All mice strains were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, MA and were housed in a
pathogen-free facility at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, with food and water ad libitum,
adhering to the guidelines from Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). To
establish obese mice models, C57Bl6 mice were fed with control or high fat diets (Research Diets).
Mice body weights were recorded over 14 weeks followed by diabetic profiling by intraperitoneal
glucose tolerance test. Briefly, mice were moved to fresh cages and fasted for 6 hours with access
only to water. Mice were then injected intraperitoneally with dextrose solution at 2g/kg body
weight. Blood from mice was drawn by sub-mandibular bleed at 0 min, 30 min and 60 min of
injection. Blood glucose levels were estimated by Glucose Assay Kit (abcam) by extrapolation
from a standard curve. These obese mice were challenged with MA-SARS-CoV-2 to study the
severity of disease progression. To study age as a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2-linked disease
severity, 6-8-weeks or 52-weeks-old C57Bl6 mice were used for mouse-adapted-SARS-CoV-2
challenge.

SARS-CoV-2 isolates and mouse adaptation:
SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 (BEI resources; NR-52281), referred in this manuscript as
WT-SARS-CoV-2, was used to challenge mice intranasally. A variant of virus (termed MASARS-CoV-2) was obtained after series of passaging in different backgrounds of laboratory mice
as well as mACE-2 expressing VeroE6 cells. Briefly, the virus was serially passaged every 2 days
via intranasal inoculation of the virus in 50 ul volume derived from the spun-down supernatants
of lung homogenates. The mouse adaptation of the SARS-CoV-2 variant was studied in C57Bl6,
BALB/c and 129S1/SVMJ (termed 129 for simplicity in the text and figures) mice models. Viral
stocks were sequenced after propagation to verify the integrity of the original viral genome.
Deep sequencing of the viral stocks.
To sequence the viral stocks we followed the protocol developed by ARTIC
(https://artic.network/ncov-2019) with the primer set version 3. Viral RNA was purified
using Viral-RNA kit (mega-Bio-Tek) following the manufacturer instructions and used as
template to prepare a cDNA. Overlapping amplicons of ~400 bp covering the whole genome where
barcoded using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) Native Barcoding Expansion kit (EXPNBD104). Libraries where prepared according to the manufacturer instructions, loaded on
a minION sequencer equipped with a FLO-MIN106D flow cell. The consensus sequence was
obtained using Lasergene software (DNAstar).
Multi-cycle growth curve for WT and MA-SARS-CoV-2:
Confluent Vero-E6 cells in 24 well format were infected with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of
0.001 of either WT or MA-SARS-CoV-2 virus for 45 minutes, the inoculum was then removed
before supplementing with viral growth media (1x Minimal Essential Medium + 2% FBS + 1%
penicillin/streptomycin). Each well was considered as one replicate per timepoint and supernatants
were stored at –80°C. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay for each sample.
Virus challenge:
2.5x104 plaque forming units (PFU) per mice of WT- or MA-SARS-CoV-2 were used for
intranasal infection, unless specified otherwise under mild ketamin/xylazine sedation. Body
weights were recorded every day to assess the morbidity post-infection until organ harvest. The
organs were homogenized in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and virus titers were determined
by plaque assay. Blood for serology or micro-neutralization assays was collected either by
submandibular bleeding technique or terminally by cardiac puncture.
Plaque assay:
Plaque assays were performed to determine viral titers in samples or organs harvested from mice
challenged with WT or MA-SARS-CoV-2. Briefly, lungs or other organs were harvested from the
mice and homogenized in sterile 1X PBS. After brief centrifugation (10,000 g x 5 minutes), the
tissue debris was discarded, and the supernatant was 10-fold serially diluted starting from 1:10

dilution. Pre-seeded Vero-E6 or mACE-2-Vero-E6 cells (for WT and MA-SARS-CoV-2
respectively) were infected with tissue homogenate for 1 hour at room temperature (RT) followed
by an overlay of 2% Oxoid agar mixed with 2X MEM supplemented with 0.3% FBS. The cells
were incubated for 72 hours at 37°C and 5% CO2 followed by fixation in 1ml of 4% methanolfree formaldehyde. The plaques were immune-stained with anti-mouse SARS-CoV-2-NP and antimouse SARS-CoV-2-spike antibodies for 1 hour at RT and consequently with HRP-conjugated
anti-mouse secondary IgG antibody for 1 hour at room temperature (RT). Finally, the plaques were
developed with TrueBlue substrate (KPL-Seracare) and viral titers were calculated and expressed
as plaque forming units (PFU)/ml.
Western Blot:
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma Aldrich, USA) supplemented with protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche, Switzerland). Total protein concentration was determined in each sample by BCA
assay and normalized. The lysates were run on a 4-20 % gradient polyacrylamide gel at 60V and
transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (BioRad Laboratories) using BIORAD semi-dry transfer system. PVDF membranes were blocked in 5 % non-fat dry milkcontaining Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20 (TBST) containing 0.1% Tween-20. Anti-Tubulin
and anti-mACE-2 (R&D Systems, Cat# MAB3437) primary antibodies were used at dilution of
1:1000 while secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies were used at dilutions of 1:10000 in 3% BSAcontaining TBST.
50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) calculation and in vitro micro-neutralization
assay:
To estimate the neutralizing efficiency of sera from vaccinated or SARS-CoV-2-infected mice or
humans, in vitro microneutralization assays were performed similarly to what is described
previously (13). Briefly, the mice or human sera were inactivated at 56°C for 30 min. Serum
samples were serially diluted 3-fold starting from 1:10 dilution in Vero-E6-infection medium
(DMEM+ 2% FBS+ 1% non-essential amino acids). The samples were incubated with optimized
tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID50), as described in the figure legends, of either WT- or MASARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour in an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 followed by incubation with pre-seeded
Vero-E6 at 37°C for 48 hours. The plates were fixed in 4% formaldehyde at 4°C overnight. For
TCID50 calculation, the virus stock was serially diluted 10-fold starting with 1:10 dilution and
incubated on Vero-E6 cells for 48 hours followed by fixation in 4% Formaldehyde. The cells were
washed with 1xPBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1XPBS. The cells were washed
again and blocked in 5% non-fat milk in 1xPBS+ 0.1% Tween-20 for 1 hour at room temperature.
After blocking, the cells were incubated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP and anti-spike monoclonal
antibodies, mixed in 1:1 ratio, for 1.5 hours at room temperature. The cells were washed in 1xPBS
and incubated with 1:5000 diluted HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody for 1 hour
at RT followed by a brief PBS wash. Finally, 100μl tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) substrate was
added and incubated at RT until blue color appeared, and the reaction was terminated with 50μl

was calculated as compared to negative control.
Serum samples from human subjects:
Ethics statement:
The study protocols for the collection of clinical specimens from individuals with and without
SARS-CoV-2 infection by the Personalized Virology Initiative were reviewed and approved by
the Mount Sinai Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB-16-00791; IRB-20- 03374). All
participants provided informed consent prior to collection of specimen and clinical information.
All specimens were coded prior to processing.
Sample collection:
A total of 34 sera were selected from study participants based on their SARS-CoV-2 spike enzyme
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antibody titer (negative [N=4] versus weak [N=8], moderate
[N=11] or strong positive [N=11]). In addition, we included sera from six individuals that had
received two doses of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (V1-V6). Demographics and available
metadata for each participant is summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Sera were heat-inactivated
(56°C, 1 hour) and all experiments were conducted in a blinded manner.

Results
Serial passaging of SARS-CoV-2 in mice results in mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2
The USA-WA1/2020-SARS-CoV-2 (termed WT-SARS-CoV-2) virus isolate was passaged eleven
times in the lungs of various strains of mice as outlined in Fig. 1A. The virus was first allowed to
adapt to murine ACE-2 receptor in immune-compromised mice with weak innate immune
responses. To this end, the virus was consecutively passaged four times in IFNα/l receptor knockout mice in C57Bl6 genetic background, using 50 µl of lung homogenate from each infected mouse
collected at three days post infection (DPI). The virus was then further passaged three times in
BALB/c mice and four times in 129 mice. The 129 mice were chosen for mouse adaptation as they
have been shown to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV, a virus that uses the same hACE-2 receptor
as SARS-CoV-2. After eleven passages, the virus was plaque-purified and clonal virus stocks of
the MA-SARS-CoV-2 were prepared in mACE-2 expressing Vero-E6 for further infection
experiments. For comparative purposes, clonal virus stocks of the WT-SARS-CoV-2 were also
generated using Vero-E6 cells. The consensus genomic sequence of the MA-SARS-CoV-2 was
generated by sanger and deep sequencing methods and the sequence changes are summarized in
Table 1. The MA-SARS-CoV-2 contained two amino acid mutations and one four amino acid
insertion in the S, and one amino acid mutation in the M, N and ORF8 gene products of the virus
(Fig. 1B). One of the amino-acid changes in the RBD of spike protein in the virus, N501Y, has
previously been reported to be associated with mouse-adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 (21) and is
predicted to increase binding to mACE-2 (14). Interestingly, the same N501Y mutation has
recently been reported in newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants (20B/501Y.V1 strain) with

MA-SARS-CoV-2 efficiently replicates in the lungs of different wild-type strains of mice and
results in transient morbidity based on their genetic background
The pathogenicity of MA-SARS-CoV-2 was examined in terms of its infection and replication
potential in laboratory mouse strains of different genetic backgrounds. While the WT-SARS-CoV2 was unable to infect any of the laboratory strains of mice, MA-SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected
129 (Fig. 1Ci), C57Bl6 (Fig. 1D) as well as BALB/c mice (Fig. 1E) with detectable virus titers in
lungs and nasal turbinates of 129 mice and lungs of male and female C57Bl6 and BALB/c mice,
obtained at different days post infection (DPI) as depicted in Fig. 1. MA-SARS-CoV-2 infection
resulted in about 12% body weight loss in 129 mice (Fig. 1C-ii) while no weight loss was observed
in infected C57Bl6 and BALB/c mice.

MA-SARS-CoV-2 results in enhanced morbidity in mouse models of obesity, obesityassociated diabetes and advanced age
The successful establishment of a MA-SARS-CoV-2 allowed us to study risk factors previously
associated with severe COVID-19 in humans. We focused on mouse models for obesity, diabetes
and advanced age. Briefly, 6–8-week-old female C57Bl6 mice were fed with either control/lowfat (CD) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 14 weeks and the body weight changes were recorded over
time. The mice on HFD gained almost twice the original weight and became obese (hence called
obese mice) over time as compared to the mice on CD (also referred to as lean mice) (Fig. 2A).
The diabetic status of the mice was determined by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (22), which
suggested that the mice on HFD were diabetic while the mice on CD were not (Fig. 2B). The CD
and HFD mice were then challenged with a low dose of MA-SARS-CoV-2 (1.7 x 103 PFU/mice)
and various organs including duodenum, heart, brain, kidney, lungs and pancreas were harvested
five days-post-infection (Fig. 2C). Upon infection, the obese mice showed more morbidity, as
reflected in higher body weight loss over five days-post-infection as well as on higher lung viral
titers when compared to the lean mice (Fig. 2D-i and D-ii). We also tested our MA-SARS-CoV-2
on 6-8-week-old and 52-week-old female C57Bl6 mice, also referred to as young and old mice,
respectively. With the same low viral challenge dose (1.7 x 103 PFU/mice), the 52-week-old mice
showed more morbidity as reflected by body weight loss over five days-post-infection when
compared to young mice. The 52-week-old mice also showed physical symptoms of distress
including hunched back and difficulty and reluctance in movement while the 6-8-week-old mice
resumed normal activity. Additionally, the viral lung titers were also found to be higher in 52week-old mice as compared to 6-8-week-old mice. five days-post-infection. Our data summarizes
that both obesity/diabetes and advanced age in mice result in higher morbidity during SARS-CoV2 infection. Although we did not find detectable virus titers in other organs with low virus
challenge in obese or aged mice, this does not exclude possible extrapulmonary viral replication
at other time points or with a higher dose of virus challenge.

N501Y mutation does not affect SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by mouse convalescent and post
vaccination serum
The WT-SARS-CoV-2 and MA-SARS-CoV-2-infected 129 mice were further tested for the
presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies against both viral strains. As shown in
Fig. 3, the MA-SARS-CoV-2 post-challenge sera were able to neutralize both WT-SARS-CoV-2
(Fig. 3A-i and A-ii) as well as MA-SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3B-i and B-ii) in in vitro
microneutralization assays. Additionally, no neutralizing antibody titers were observed in the sera
of 129 mice infected with WT-SARS-CoV-2 against both strains of viruses, which is in line with
WT-SARS-CoV-2 not being able to infect or replicate efficiently in 129 mice lungs and therefore,
negligible immune responses were induced in the mice. Besides post-challenge studies, we also
performed in vitro microneutralization assays using 3-week post-vaccination sera from BALB/c
mice that received an adjuvanted recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein vaccine (from a vaccination
study reported in our recent prepublication (15) that is currently under revision). The adjuvantedspike vaccination sera were found to be neutralizing to the same extent against both strains of the
virus, irrespective of the N501Y mutation (Fig. 3C and 3D).

(A, B) 129 mice were mock-infected or infected with 2.5 x 104 PFU/mouse of either of WT- or MA-SARS-CoV-2.
Blood was drawn from mice 3-weeks post-infection and microneutralization assays were performed against WTSARS-CoV-2 (A-i and A-ii) or MA-SARS-CoV-2 (B-i and B-ii) using 200TCID50 of each virus. Sera from mice preexposed to MA-SARS-CoV-2 were able to neutralize both strains of virus. (C, D) Sera from BALB/c mice, nonvaccinated or vaccinated with adjuvanted-SARS-CoV-2- recombinant S-protein, were tested for presence of
neutralizing antibodies by in vitro microneutralization assays with WT- SARS-CoV-2 (C-i and C-ii) or MA- SARSCoV-2 (D-i and D-ii). Sera from mice vaccinated with adjuvanted-spike protein was able to neutralize both strains of
virus. Sera from non-vaccinated mice were used as control in the experiment. Symbols represent geometric means;

N501Y mutation does not affect SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by human convalescent and
post vaccination serum
The comparison of post-vaccination and post-challenge sera from mice showed that both WT- and
MA-SARS-CoV-2 strains were neutralized to the same extent indicating that the N501Y
substitution in the receptor binding domain of Spike does not mediate antibody escape. To further
validate these observations, we next performed similar microneutralization assays using sera from
study participants with or without SARS-CoV-2 immune responses. We included samples from
individuals who had recovered from natural infection or had received the Pfizer vaccine (see
supplementary table 1). Sera were tested for neutralizing potential against both WT- as well as
MA-SARS-CoV-2 strains. Post-vaccination sera had neutralizing antibody titers that were similar
to the highest neutralization titers observed in convalescent sera (Fig. 4). Moreover,
microneutralization titers against both WT- and MA-SARS-CoV-2 were comparable. Overall, our
study shows that the N501Y mutation in the RBD domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein does
not compromise the neutralization potential of this virus by convalescent and post-vaccination
human sera.

Fig. 4. Post-vaccination or convalescent human sera neutralize both WT- and N501Y MA-SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
Post-vaccination or post-infection human sera were analyzed for virus neutralization by in vitro microneutralization
assays using 450TCID50 of either WT-SARS-CoV-2 or MA-SARS-CoV-2 and the ID50 (inhibition) values were
calculated and compared. Each symbol represents ID50 (inhibition) value calculated for a human serum sample. Both
post-vaccination sera as well as convalescent sera neutralize both strains of virus. Sera from sero-negative individuals
were used as negative control for the experiment.

Discussion
There is an urgent need for animal models to test efficacies of antiviral interventions and to study
underlying risk factors associated with enhanced illness during COVID-19. We -adapted the USAWA1/2020 strain to mice by serial passaging the virus in mouse lungs. This resulted in acquisition
of mutations that allow the virus to efficiently replicate to detectable titers in the lungs of mice.

Mouse adaptation did not impact growth kinetics of the virus on Vero E6 cells, which suggests
that mutations associated with mouse-adaptation broadened receptor specificity rather than
changed receptor specificity from human (or primate) ACE-2 to murine ACE-2. We observed
multiple mutations associated in different viral genes. The MA-SARS-CoV-2 has acquired an
asparagine to tyrosine mutation at position 501 in the spike RBD (N501Y). The same mutation has
recently been described by Gu et al. (2020) for mouse-adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 following a
similar strategy with aged BALB/c mice (16). In silico analysis also predicted that the N501Y
mutation would result in enhanced RBD affinity for the mACE-2 receptor (14). We therefore
concluded that this mutation is important for mouse adaptation. We also observed a four amino
acid insertion in the spike protein (KLRS). This insertion has been described in SARS-CoV-2
viruses recovered from deer mice upon experimental infection with the same USA-WA1/2020
strain (17). Minority variants with this insertion were already present in the original SARS-CoV2 virus obtained from BEI Resources at low frequency and seems also to be enriched after
passaging in Vero E6 cells (data not shown) and mice (this study). Interestingly, cats have recently
been identified as an animal species sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection (18) and SARS-CoV-2
with the KLRS insertion was also enriched in lung and GI tract tissues as well as nasal,
oropharyngeal and rectal swabs from infected cats upon experimental infection (supplementary
Fig. 3). Therefore, it is likely that the KLRS insertion increases viral replication in multiple hosts,
not only in mice. The effect of presence of the KLRS insertion is currently being investigated. We
also observed mutations outside of the spike protein of the MA-SARS-CoV-2. As has been shown
for influenza virus and SARS-CoV before, multiple viral gene products may contribute to
virulence, either individually or by interaction with each other (19–21). At this point it is still
unclear if the mutations outside of spike protein contribute to increased replication and virulence
in mice or if they are passenger mutations. Introduction of the observed mutations in a recombinant
virus approach for SARS-CoV-2 infectious clone is needed to investigate the individual or
synergistic contributions to replication and virulence of these mutations.
Interestingly, the N501Y mutation in the RBD of the S protein is also found in the newly emerging
20B/501Y.V1 strain that was first detected in the UK but now is circulating worldwide with high
transmissibility. The N501Y mutation is the only mutation in the RBD of the S protein of the UKorigin 20B/501Y.V1 strains, and therefore, might impact its antigenicity. The vaccines that are
currently being rolled out have an N at position 501. Viral escape from neutralizing antibodies has
been shown in vitro using pseudoviruses (22) and there are strong concerns that monoclonal
antibody therapies and vaccines that become currently available may have reduced efficacy against
circulating strains with the N501Y mutation. We showed that convalescent and post-vaccination
sera obtained from both mice and humans can still potently neutralize the MA-SARS-CoV-2
variant with N501Y mutation in its RBD. This strongly suggests that humoral immune responses
induced by the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are currently entering the market will be protective
against the newly emerging 20B/501Y.V1 strain. This is especially important for people with
comorbidities that are at risk for severe illness during COVID-19 and therefore, are prioritized for
vaccination. Comorbidities include advanced age, type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Obesity
was a predictor for mortality among intensive care unit-admitted patients with severe COVID-19,
and put patients at higher risk for hypoxemia (6). Diabetes increases mortality among COVID-19
patients (3). In this work we present two mouse models for studying enhanced illness during the
outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of these comorbidities with the MA-SARS-CoV2 that has the N501Y mutation. This mouse model does not rely on transgenic expression or
adenoviral transduction of hACE-2. Therefore, it is suitable to study the effect of ACE inhibitors

and angiotensin II type I-receptor blockers that are used to treat diabetics and can result in
upregulation of hACE-2, thereby potentially sensitizing patients for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection
