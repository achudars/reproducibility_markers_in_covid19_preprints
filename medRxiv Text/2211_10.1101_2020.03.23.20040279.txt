ABSTRACT
Objective: To investigate the clinical presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
particularly the incidence of gastrointestinal tract symptoms.
Design: We enrolled adult COVID-19 patients from a mobile cabin hospital in Wuhan with a
definitive diagnosis by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing. Face-to-face interviews were conducted
in which the patient selected COVID-19-related symptoms and report the time of onset and
duration of symptoms.
Results: A total of 212 adults were enrolled in this study, of which 127 (59.9%) were females,
mean age was 48.50 ±13.15 (range: 17-79) years, and mean disease course was 26.78±9.16 (3-60)
days. Fever and cough were the most common and earliest clinical symptoms of COVID-19.

Diarrhoea occurred in 43.8% (93/212) of patients, of which 86.0% (80/93) had mushy stools.
Nausea and vomiting were also common (20.7%). Diarrhoea lasted for 4.00(2.00-8.85) days and
mostly occurred 5.00(0.25-11.00) days after the emergence of the first symptoms. Multiple
logistic regression analysis found that diarrhoea was significantly correlated with fatigue
[OR2.900,95%CI (1.629-5.164), p<0.0001].
Conclusions: Gastrointestinal tract symptoms are common in COVID-19 and most occur during
the middle stage of the disease and lasts for a short period of time. Clinicians need to pay greater
attention to gastrointestinal tract symptoms of COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently become a global pandemic.1 Fever and cough
are the most common clinical presentations. 2-3 Gastrointestinal tract symptoms such as nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhoea are often seen in coronavirus infections such as severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).4-5 Recent studies report that
gastrointestinal tract symptoms are rarely observed in COVID-19 patients,2-3 observed in about 3.0%
of cases. However, a US report revealed that the first patient experienced 2 continuous days of
diarrhoea on Day 6 after disease onset.6 Are gastrointestinal tract symptoms rare in COVID-19?
We recently worked in a mobile cabin hospital and conducted a detailed investigation of the
clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19.

METHODS
Ethical considerations
This study was reviewed by the ethics committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Ethics
Approval No.: WDRY2020-K033) and written informed consent from patients was waived. Only
verbal explanation was required, and verbal informed consent was obtained from the patients.
Subject population
Hardcopy forms were formulated and printed. From February 18 to March 2, 2020, COVID-19
patients ≥16 years of age in Wuchang mobile cabin hospital were recruited. The patients
themselves completed a form that collected general demographic information, current medical
history, past medical history, date of first positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid result, chest CT
result, and COVID-19 contact history. COVID-19-related clinical symptoms were listed with tick
boxes in the form. The study participants were asked to check the boxes of their recent symptoms

and write down the specific date of onset and duration of each symptom. All patients in this mobile
cabin hospital were long-time residents of Wuhan and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic
acid by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and their diseases were
classified as mild and moderate COVID-19 according to the diagnostic criteria in Diagnosis and
Treatment Plan of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (trial edition 5).7 After patients completed the
hardcopy forms, photographs were taken, and the data were uploaded onto the network. Before the
mobile cabin hospital was closed, the hardcopy forms were destroyed as medical waste.
Data analysis
SPSS 26.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Disease course referred to the duration from
onset of first symptoms to the date of the investigation. Disease course in asymptomatic patients
was defined as the interval from test date of the positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test result to
the date of the investigation. Symptom duration was defined as the interval from onset of that
symptom to resolution or investigation. Symptom occurrence node refers to the duration from
onset of the first symptom of COVID-19. High fever was defined as temperature ≥39°C. Patients
with ages ≥50 years were described as elderly patients. A disease course ≥20 days was defined as
long disease course. A history of chronic disease was defined as other diseases that persisted for 3
months before COVID-19 such as hypertension, diabetes, hepatitis B, and tuberculosis. The
Kolmogorov-Smimov test was used to determine whether the data were normally distributed.
Continuous variables were expressed as the means and standard deviations or medians and
interquartile ranges (IQR) as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized as the counts
and percentages in each category. We grouped patients into diarrhoea and
non-diarrhoeaWilcoxon rank-sum tests were applied to continuous variables, chi-square tests
and Fisher’s exact tests were used for categorical variables as appropriate. To identify risk factors
for COVID-19, Pearson's chi-squared test was used for correlation analysis. Differences with a
P-value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
A total of 212 adults were enrolled in the study, of which 127 (59.9%) were females, and mean age
was 48.50 ±13.15 (range: 17–79) years. In terms of educational level, 8.0%(17/212) completed
elementary school education, 52.8%(112/212 ) attained middle school education, and 39.2%
(83/212) were college graduates. Mean disease course was 26.78 ± 9.16 (range: 3–60) days. There
were 12 clinically asymptomatic patients, and mean disease course was 18.08 ± 9.32 (range: 9–33)
days. Five of these 12 patients had chest computed tomography (CT) scans that showed viral
pneumonia but they had no clinical presentation. Approximately 44.3% of the patients claimed to
have a clear contact history with individuals with COVID-19. Chest CT scans showed that almost
all patients (96.7%, 207/212) in this study had specific characteristics for COVID-19.7
Fever and cough were the most common clinical presentations (Figure 1), and patients with
high-grade fever accounted for 14.2% (30/212). Profuse sweating occurred in 114 patients, of
which 89.5% (102/114) had night sweats. Diarrhoea occurred in 43.8% (93/212) of patients, of
which 86.0% (80/93) had mushy stools. Nausea and vomiting were also common (20.7%). Around
3.3% (7/212) of the patients developed conjunctival congestion.
Cough was the most persistent symptom, whereas conjunctival congestion had the shortest
duration. Diarrhoea persisted for an median duration of 4.00 (2.00-8.75) days and is one of the
clinical symptoms with the shortest duration.
Nasal congestion, myalgia, headache, chills, fever, fatigue, and coughing were common initial
symptoms, whereas gastrointestinal tract symptoms were rare initial symptoms. In this study, 5
(2.4%) patients had an initial symptom of diarrhoea, whereas most patients developed diarrhoea
5.00(0.25-11.00) days (median) after the development of initial symptoms (Figure 3).

Correlation analysis of diarrhoea found that fatigue had the highest correlation with
diarrhoeaOR, 2.900, 95%CI(1.629-5.164), p<0.0001. Diarrhoea was not associated with sex
or disease course(P>0.05), and old age might be a protective factor against diarrhoea (OR, 0.552,
95%CI (0.319-0.955))(Table 1).
DISCUSSIONS
Coronavirus is a large virus family that can cause various conditions ranging from the common
cold to severe infectious diseases such as SARS and MERS.8 COVID-19 is a recently discovered
infection in humans and is now considered a pandemic.1,9 The most common clinical presentations
associated with coronavirus infection are fever and cough.2-3,9 The results of this study have further
proven previous conclusions. Studies have found that gastrointestinal tractsymptoms are one of the
common clinical presentations in SARS and MERS. 4-5,9 However, recent studies found that
diarrhoea is rare in COVID-19,2-3,10 with an incidence of about 3%. A US study reported that their
first patient, who had mild COVID-19, developed diarrhoea lasting for 2 days. 6 In addition, a
study reported that diarrhoea may be an initial symptom of COVID-19.11 In this study, we found
that a minority of patients had an initial symptom of diarrhoea. In contrast to the results of previous
studies, this study found that diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting are common in COVID-19. Why are
there differences between the results of this study and other past clinical investigations? First, the
data sources of these studies vary. The information used by Zhong et al. was obtained from
medical records, 3,10 whereas the data in this study was provided by the patients themselves. Even
though this is a retrospective study, the study subjects were adults and most had an educational
level of middle school and above, thereby ensuring the reliability and authenticity of the content of
this study. Second, the time nodes of the data records are different. The results of this study found
that diarrhoea mostly occurred 5 days after the development of initial symptoms; therefore,
patients may not have developed gastrointestinal tract symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, and
vomiting in the other studies. In this study, the mean disease course when patients underwent

interviews was 26.78 ± 9.16 days, which far exceeds the duration in other studies. For example,
Gong et al. showed that the mean disease course of deceased patients was 10.56 ± 4.42 days.12
Furthermore, in contrast to cough and other symptoms, diarrhoea in COVID-19 patients lasted for
a short duration and mostly occurred as mushy stools instead of watery diarrhoea in SARS.4
Therefore, diarrhoea may be overlooked by clinicians and patients during COVID-19. As
digestive tract symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting tend to be overlooked in
coronavirus infections, Kim et al. proposed considering diarrhoea as one of the clinical
presentations during MERS diagnosis.13
Why do we need to pay attention to gastrointestinal tract symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea,
and vomiting? First, as COVID-19 is a wasting disease, vomiting and diarrhoea affect nutrient
absorption in patients and therefore may affect disease outcomes. Our study found that diarrhoea is
significantly correlated with fatigue, suggesting that diarrhoea may decrease the quality of life of
patients. Hence, clinicians must actively strengthen nutrition supportive treatment in COVID-19
patients. In addition, Xiao et al. isolated viable SARS-CoV-2 virus from fecal samples of
COVID-19 patients and the human receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme, 14
is highly expressed in the stomach, duodenum, and rectal epithelial cells, supporting the possibility
that SARS-CoV-2 can enter host cells in the digestive tract. Gu et al. proposed that the digestive
tract may be one of the target organs of SARS-CoV-2.15 Our study showed that digestive tract
symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting are common in COVID-19, suggesting that the
possibility of fecal–oral transmission is high. Therefore, we need to actively promote hand hygiene
to prevent this disease. Moreover, public health authorities need to actively manage digestive tract
excretions from patients to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
As the subjects of this study are patients with mild cases in mobile cabin hospitals, we were
unable to determine whether gastrointestinal tract symptoms are common in severe patients.
Therefore, we can only suggest that digestive tract symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, and

vomiting are common in mild COVID-19. At present, no large-scale study has discovered the
SARS-CoV-2 virus in fecal samples. 14 Therefore, a large sample size of COVID-19 patients is
required for a study in which stool samples should be collected approximately one week after the
onset of initial clinical symptoms in COVID-19 patients to assess the proportion of COVID-19
patients with stool samples containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This will provide valuable
evidence to support aggressive public health strategies.
In conclusion, gastrointestinal tract symptoms are common in COVID-19 and most occur
during the middle stage of the disease and lasts for a short period of time. Clinicians need to pay
greater attention to the gastrointestinal tract symptoms of COVID-19.
