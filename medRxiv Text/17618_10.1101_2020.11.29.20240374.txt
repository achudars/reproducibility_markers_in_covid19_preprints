Abstract

38

Background: Limited data are available on the relationship between infant and

39

pediatric asthma and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

40

(COVID-19).

41

Political limitations such as school closure may affect the treatment behavior of

42

pediatric asthma. To investigate the trends of treatment behavior in the field of

43

pediatrics during the COVID-19 pandemic.

44

Methods: This is a retrospective observational study using Diagnosis

45

Procedure Combination (DPC) data from the Quality Indicator/Improvement

46

Project (QIP) database. We identified children with asthma aged 15 years or

47

younger who were patients from July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2020. The main

48

outcome was a comparison between asthma patients' treatment behavior

49

before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

50

We statistically tested the admission volume changes based on the discharge

51

date after adjusting for seasonality through a Fourier term using an interrupted

52

time-series analysis (ITS).

53

Results: We identified 10,481 inpatients cases in 67 hospitals and 258,911

54

out-patients cases in 180 hospitals who were diagnosed with asthma. We

55

performed ITS analysis for inpatients. The reduction in the number of patients

56

during this period was estimated to be 232 (P=0.001). In addition, ITS analysis

57

was performed for patients aged <3 years. The reduced number of patients

58

during this period was estimated to be 155 (P<0.001).

59

Conclusions: We found that the number of pediatric asthma patients

60

dramatically decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. We need to continue

61

research into the trends of pediatric asthma patients after the COVID-19

62

pandemic in Japan.

64

Key Messages

65

There are increasingly available data on the relationship between adults'

66

asthma and COVID-19. However, in the fields of pediatrics, limited data are

67

available. Patients with moderate to severe asthma who needed hospitalization

68

dramatically decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides, doctors

69

prescribed nebulizers more than metered-dose inhalers by the clinical guideline

70

recommendation. Our findings reinforce the value of political inventions, such

71

as school closure reduced the number of asthma attacks in infants and

72

school-age children.

Introduction

74

In December 2019, pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)

75

occurred in Wuhan, China. According to the World Health Organization (WHO),

76

217,769 deaths had been caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

77

globally by May 1, 20201. Public health interventions, including school closure

78

and the city lockdown, began in many countries.

79

Pediatric asthma is one of the most common diseases in infant to school-age

80

children. Risk factors, including respiratory virus infection, air pollution, and

81

house dust, can exacerbate pediatric asthma. Environmental triggers are

82

particularly important. In Japan, all schools excluding nursery schools were

83

closed nationwide on February 27, 20202. Besides, the COVID-19 pandemic

84

caused dramatic changes in daily practice and health care delivery systems in

85

many countries. Some states reported hospital avoidance in pediatrics,

86

including emergency department visits and hospital admission during the

87

COVID-19 pandemic.

88

Unlike the lockdown policy in many countries, including the United States,

89

China, and European countries, the Japanese lockdown did not have a legally

90

binding force. Therefore, the lockdown in Japan was a voluntary lockdown2.

91

The 'voluntary lockdown' promoted a change of lifestyle, such as decreasing

92

transportation and industrial activity and closure of schools, which intended to

93

limit physical interactions among people. These political interventions may have

94

affected the environment for children.

95

In this study, we describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric

96

asthma-related health care utilization including emergency departments and

97

hospitalization.

98

Inhaled steroids and β2 agonists are a key treatment option for asthma3. The

99

Japanese Society of Pediatric Allergy and Clinical Immunology recommends

100

using a metered-dose inhaler rather than a nebulizer because a nebulizer can

101

spread the aerosol on caregivers and medical staff. We also investigated the

102

trends for the prescription of inhalers4.

103

Methods

105

Source of data

106

Our study was a retrospective observational study using Diagnosis Procedure

107

Combination (DPC) data from the Quality Indicator/Improvement Project (QIP)

108

database. The QIP database contains DPC data from acute care hospitals

109

voluntarily participating in the project. The DPC/per-diem payment system

110

(PDPS) is a Japanese prospective payment system applied to acute care

111

hospitals. In total, 1,730 hospitals adopted the DPC/PDPS in 2018, which

112

accounted for 54% (482,618/891,872) of general beds of Japanese hospitals in

113

20185,6

114

The cumulative number of participating hospitals for the QIP was over 500,

115

which were located all over Japan and included both public and private

116

hospitals of various sizes. The number of general beds, which are hospital beds

117

that are not psychiatric, infectious diseases, or tuberculosis beds according to

118

the Japanese classification of hospital beds, ranged from 30 to 1,151 in 2016.

119

The DPC data consist of claims and discharge summaries, including

120

International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes

121

classifying the primary diagnosis, cause of admission, the most and the

122

second-most medical-resource-intensive diagnoses, up to 10 comorbidities,

123

and 10 complications. The DPC data also contain codes of all services and

124

medications provided during each hospitalization as well as PDPS information.

127

The study was conducted after obtaining approval from the Kyoto University

128

Hospital Ethics committee of the Kyoto University Graduate School and Faculty

129

of Medicine, according to the guidelines on medical and epidemiological

130

research (No. R0135). Using the DPC database, we identified inpatients with

131

discharge dates from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2020, and outpatients at the date

132

of a visiting hospital within the same periods.

133

We collected data for each patient during the research period. We selected

134

hospitals that sent DPC data for more than 9 months each year to QIP

135

database.

136

All patients were aged ≤15 years and were diagnosed with asthma according to

137

the ICD-10 codes (J45.x, J46).

138

139

Statistical analysis

140

An interrupted time-series analysis (ITS), including segmented regressions,

141

was performed to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on

142

population-level admissions. We statistically tested the changes in admission

143

volume based on the discharge date after adjusting for seasonality through a

144

Fourier term. We compared the number of admissions per month based on the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.29.20240374; this version posted December 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

145

discharge date, not the date of admission, because the DPC data were

146

generated after patients' discharge from hospitals. We hypothesize that

147

COVID-19 would impact the level change of admission volume immediately

148

after March 2020, as an implemented point. The Japanese government

149

declared a state of emergency and requested self-quarantine, social distancing,

150

and school closure. We classified the patients into three age groups: 0–2, 3–5,

151

and 6–15 years. These groups corresponded to nursery school for ages 0–2,

152

kindergarten for ages 3–5 years, elementary school for ages 6–12 years, and

153

junior high school for ages 12–15 years.

154

All analyses were computed using R statistical software (version 3.4.0), and a

155

two-sided significance level was fixed at 0.05.

163

age was 5 years (IQR 3, 9 years), and the most common age category was

164

6–11 years in outpatients. The number of males was much bigger than females

165

in both inpatients and outpatients. The median value of the length of stay for

166

each month was 5 days (IQR 4, 6) during the study period. The proportion of

167

patients with asthma who visited emergency departments from July 2019 to

168

June 2020 decreased by more than 30% compared to that from July 2018 to

169

June 2019.

2019. The number of inpatients of the other age categories also showed

182

decreasing trends between July 2019 and June 2020 compared to that between

183

July 2018 and June 2019 (Figure 2 a)–c)).

184

The number of patients who were complicated with an infection showed a

statistically significant decrease between July 2019 and June 2020 compared

186

to that between July 2018 and June 2019, especially for patients aged ≤3 years

187

(Figure 2 d)–f)). There was a statistically significant decrease in the number of

188

outpatient cases between July 2018 to June 2019 and July 2019 to June 2020

Discussion

197

This study demonstrated the trends of asthma in the pediatric population by

198

using a large-scale administrative database. Our study had three major

199

findings.

200

First, pediatric patients with moderate to severe asthma who needed

201

hospitalization dramatically decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic.

202

Moreover, infant patients controlled their asthma attacks more than school-age

203

children. There were several reasons for this situation. One reason for asthma

204

is an infection7; school closure and 'voluntary lockdown' may have influenced

205

the children's disease. The most common route of infection is contact among

206

children and is well known. Besides, the Japanese government convinced

207

businessmen to stay and work at home during the 'voluntary lockdown' starting

208

in April 8. Previous reports have shown that adherence improved during

209

lockdown for the COVID-19 pandemic9. Besides, PM2.5 was one of the

210

environmental risk factors that decreased in several areas, including India,

211

China, England, and The United States during lockdown. Lockdown caused a

212

reduction in traffic volume, including cars, airplanes, and trains, which resulted

213

in decreased environmental risk factors, including PM2.5, CO2, and O3101112.

214

Second, the number of outpatients during the pandemic decreased compared

215

to that before the pandemic. Most outpatients controlled their asthma, so it is

216

possible that the patient’s parents avoided a hospital visit. These hospital

217

avoidances in Japan were similar to other countries13. Previous reports have

218

stated that online or telephone health care services increased in European

219

countries14. Online or telephone health care services could have been provided

220

in Japan; however, there were few cases using online or telephone health care

221

services in our study (data not shown).

222

Third, doctors prescribed nebulizers more than metered-dose inhalers. The

223

Japanese Society of Pediatric Allergy and Clinical immunology recommended

224

using a metered-dose inhaler rather than a nebulizer in March 2020, because a

225

nebulizer can spread aerosol on caregivers and medical staff. The guideline

226

has not infiltrated sufficiently to all hospitals and medical staff during a short

227

period, and infant patients cannot use a metered-dose inhaler.

228

Our study had several limitations. QIP hospitals represented a limited number

229

of hospitals in Japan. Therefore, it is difficult to generalize our results to

230

nationwide pediatric asthma patients. However, a previous study15 for adult’s

231

asthma patients showed similar results to ours. Therefore, we consider that our

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.29.20240374; this version posted December 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

232

findings also have validity for inpatients. Although most outpatients with asthma

233

usually visit clinics, acute hospitals such as QIP hospitals treat patients who

234

have other comorbidities or follow the acute phase for asthma. Finally, we had

235

no data about air pollution in Japan.

236

237

Conclusions

238

We found that the number of pediatric asthma patients did not increase due to

239

respiratory infections such as COVID-19. These results were supported by

240

political inventions such as school closure and social distancing. In addition,

241

infant patients controlled their asthma attacks more than school-age children.

242

We need to continue the research into trends of pediatric asthma patients after

243

the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.
