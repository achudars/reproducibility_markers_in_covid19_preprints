Summary Paragraph:

2
3

Age is the dominant risk factor for infectious diseases, but the mechanisms linking the two are

4

incompletely understood1,2. Age-related mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) detected from

5

blood-derived DNA genotyping, are structural somatic variants associated with aberrant

6

leukocyte cell counts, hematological malignancy, and mortality3-11. Whether mCAs represent

7

independent risk factors for infection is unknown. Here we use genome-wide genotyping of

8

blood DNA to show that mCAs predispose to diverse infectious diseases. We analyzed mCAs

9

from 767,891 individuals without hematological cancer at DNA acquisition across four

10

countries. Expanded mCA (cell fraction >10%) prevalence approached 4% by 60 years of age

11

and was associated with diverse incident infections, including sepsis, pneumonia, and

12

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization. A genome-wide association study of

13

expanded mCAs identified 63 significant loci. Germline genetic alleles associated with expanded

14

mCAs were enriched at transcriptional regulatory sites for immune cells. Our results link mCAs

15

with impaired immunity and predisposition to infections. Furthermore, these findings may also

16

have important implications for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in prioritizing

17

individual preventive strategies and evaluating immunization responses.

With advancing age comes increased susceptibility to infectious diseases1,2. Immunosenescence

2

is the age-related erosion of immune function, particularly with respect to adaptive immunity12-

3

15

4

infections, with impaired immune responses increasing risk for infections16-18. Age-related

5

mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) detected from blood-derived DNA, are clonal structural

6

somatic alterations (deletions, duplications, or copy neutral loss of heterozygosity) present in a

7

fraction of peripheral leukocytes that can indicate clonal hematopoiesis (CH)3-5. mCAs are

8

associated with aberrant leukocyte cell counts, and increased risks for hematological malignancy

9

and mortality3-11.

. Leukocytes, including T-cells and B-cells, are key mediators of adaptive host defenses against

10
11

While the relationship between mCAs and increased hematologic cancer risk is well established3-

12

5

13

We hypothesized that mCAs increase risk of infection since mCAs are somatic variants that

14

increase in abundance with age and are associated with alterations in leukocyte count. In this

15

study, we harnessed DNA genotyping array intensity data and long-range chromosomal phase

16

information inferred from 767,891 individuals across four countries to analyze the associations

17

between expanded mCA clones (i.e., mCAs present in at least 10% of peripheral leukocyte DNA

18

indicative of clonal expansion) and diverse infections, including severe coronavirus disease 2019

19

(COVID-19) from SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1a). To elucidate genetic risk factors for the

20

development of expanded mCA clones, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS)

21

in the UK Biobank and subsequent in silico cell-specific, transcriptomic, and pathway analyses.

, the impact of mCAs on age-related diminishment in immune function is poorly understood.

Population characteristics and mCA prevalence

4

A total of 767,891 unrelated, multi-ethnic individuals across the UK Biobank (UKB)

5

(N=444,199), Mass General Brigham Biobank (MGBB) (22,461), FinnGen (N=175,690), and

6

BioBank Japan (BBJ) (N=125,541) passing genotype and mCA quality control criteria

7

(Supplementary Notes 1-5) were analyzed (Supplementary Table 1). While UKB and BBJ

8

mCA calls were previously performed3,4, the MoChA pipeline

9

(https://github.com/freeseek/mocha) was implement to detect mCAs in MGBB and FinnGen

10

(Extended Data Figure 1) from genome-wide genotyping of blood DNA in the present study.

11

Among the UKB participants, mean age at DNA collection was 57 (standard deviation [SD] 8)

12

years, 204,579 (46.1%) were male, 188,875 (45.0%) were prior or current smokers, and 66,551

13

(15.0%) had a history of solid cancer. In the MGBB, mean age was 55 (SD 17) years, 10,306

14

(45.9%) were male, 9,094 (40.5%) were prior or current smokers, and 6,080 (27.1%) had a

15

history of solid cancer. In FinnGen, mean age was 53 (SD 18) years, 71,000 (40.4%) were male,

16

42.7% were prior or current smokers (when smoking status was available), and 31,855 (18.1%)

17

had a history of solid cancer. In BBJ, mean age was 65 (SD 12) years, 72,186 (57.5%) were

18

male, and 66,913 (53.3%) were prior or current smokers, and 25,987 (20.7%) had a history of

19

solid cancer.

20
21

In the UKB, among 444,199 unrelated individuals without a known history of hematologic

22

malignancy, 66,011 (14.9%) carried an mCA (15,350 autosomal) and 12,398 (3.2%) carried an

23

expanded mCA clone, defined as an mCA mutation present in at least 10% of peripheral

leukocytes (2,985 autosomal) (Supplementary Table 2). While most of carriers only carried one

2

mCA, 6% of individuals carried between 2 to 22 non-overlapping mCAs (Supplementary Note

3

6). In the MGBB, across 22,461 unrelated individuals without a history of hematologic cancer,

4

3,784 (16.8%) carried an mCA (1,025 autosomal) and 1,026 (5.2%) carried an expanded mCA

5

clone (337 autosomal). In FinnGen, across 175,690 individuals without a history of hematologic

6

cancer, 22,040 (12.5%) carried an mCA (3,164 autosomal), and 9,558 (5.9%) carried an

7

expanded mCA clone (1,620 autosomal). In BBJ, across 125,541 individuals without a history of

8

hematologic cancer, only autosomal mCAs were available, with 20,440 carriers (16.3%) and

9

1,676 (1.3%) that carried an expanded clone. (Supplementary Table 2).

10
11

Consistent with previous reports, the prevalence of mCAs increased with age and was more

12

common among men (Supplementary Note 7,8, and Supplementary Table 3). Across the

13

UKB, MGBB, FinnGen, and BBJ cohorts combined, the prevalence of expanded mCAs was

14

0.5% among individuals <40 years, 1.2% among 40-60 years, 7.8% among 60-80 years, and

15

26.5% among those greater than 80 years (Figure 1b), the majority of which is due to loss of X

16

in females and loss of Y in males (Supplementary Note 7). The prevalence of expanded

17

autosomal mCAs was 0.27% among individuals <40 years, 0.52% among 40-60 years, 1.5%

18

among 60-80 years, and 4.6% among those greater than 80 years (Figure 1c).

Association of mCAs with hematologic traits

21

We observed a striking association of mCA cell fraction with aberrant cell blood counts acquired

22

at the same visit as blood for genotyping (Figure 1d). Increased mCA cell fraction was

23

associated with overall increased white blood cell count with general consistency across the cell

differential components, with inflections at around cell fraction of 0.1 (Figure 1d). The strongest

2

association across all mCAs groupings (autosomal/chrX/chrY) with blood counts was between

3

expanded autosomal mCAs and increased lymphocyte count at enrollment (Beta 0.40 SD or 0.25

4

x109 cells/L; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.44 SD; P=4.2x10-84) (Extended Data Figure 2, Supplementary

5

Note 9).

7

Similarly, incident hematologic cancer risk was also strongly dependent on cell fraction

8

(Extended Data Figure 3a,b). We reproduced the associations of mCAs with hematologic

9

cancers with similar effects as previously described in the UKB4,5. We found that expanded

10

autosomal mCAs with cell fraction >10% were most strongly associated with incident

11

hematologic cancer (Extended Data Figure 3c), with the strongest association being for

12

incident chronic lymphocytic leukemia (HR 121.9; 95% CI 93.6 to 158.9; P=4.2x10-277);

13

although an association with myeloid leukemia was also present (HR 12.3; 95% CI 7.7 to 19.7;

14

P=2.3x10-25) (Supplementary Figure 11). While expanded chrX and chrY mCAs were also

15

associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, their effects were considerably lower (chrX: HR

16

24.1, 95% CI 5.8 to 99.9, P=1.1x10-5 and chrY: HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.0, P=0.038) (Extended

17

Data Figure 3c).

Associations with diverse infections

20

mCA presence across the genome was associated with diverse incident infections (defined in

21

Supplementary Data 1,2) (HR 1.06; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.09; P=8.6x10-8) (Supplementary Note

22

10), independent of age, age2, sex, smoking status, and first 10 principal components of ancestry

23

in the combined UKB, MGBB, and FinnGen meta-analysis. The dependence of this association

with mCA cell fraction is further visualized in Figure 2a,b, which shows an increase in

2

proportion of incident infection cases and incident sepsis cases with cell fraction, with greater

3

slopes observed at approximately cell fraction >10%. Accordingly, the associations across

4

diverse infections were stronger for expanded mCA clones, (HR 1.12; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.2;

5

P=6.3x10-7) (Figure 2c). Furthermore, among expanded mCA clones, the strongest association

6

was observed among expanded autosomal mCAs (HR 1.3; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.4; P=1.8x10-7)

7

(Figure 2c). Accounting for multiple hypothesis testing, expanded autosomal mCAs were

8

significantly associated with sepsis (HR 2.7; 95% CI 2.3 to 3.2; P=3.1x10-28), respiratory system

9

infections (HR 1.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 1.5; P=3.8x10-10), digestive system infections (HR 1.5; 95%

10

CI 1.3 to 1.7; P=2.2x10-9), and genitourinary system infections (HR 1.3; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.4;

11

P=3.7x10-4) (Figure 2c). The specific expanded autosomal mCAs implicated for infection were

12

diverse in nature – across all chromosomes, of different sizes, and mixed across gain, loss, and

13

copy-number neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNN-LOH) mCAs (Extended Data Figure 4).

14

Further associations across 20 specific infectious disease subcategories are enumerated in

15

Supplementary Note 11. For sex chromosome mCAs, none of the incident infections achieved

16

statistical significance (P<0.005) in meta-analysis across the three cohorts; however, respiratory

17

infections were suggestively associated (expanded chrX: HR 1.5; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.9; P=0.0068;

18

expanded chrY: HR 1.09; 95% CI 1.0 to 1.2; P=0.005) (Supplementary Figure 12).

19
20
21

Risks for incident fatal infections were assessed in BBJ since non-fatal incident infectious

22

disease events are currently unavailable in BBJ. Among individuals without any cancer history in

23

BBJ, autosomal mCAs showed nominal associations with fatal incident infections (HR 1.12,

95% CI 1.0 to 1.2 P=0.04), with expanded autosomal mCAs being associated with incident

2

sepsis mortality (HR 2.0; 95% CI 1.0 to 4.2; P=0.05) (Supplementary Table 4, Extended Data

3

Figure 5), as well as pneumonia history (OR 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1 to 1.5; P=0.0019).

4
5

Sensitivity analysis for the association of expanded autosomal mCAs and incident sepsis found

6

that the association was consistently significant across different age groups (Supplementary

7

Note 13), and that it was additionally independent of a 25-factor smoking covariate10, body mass

8

index, type 2 diabetes mellitus, leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, and lymphocyte percentage

9

(Supplementary Table 5).

10
11

Stratified analyses indicated expanded autosomal mCAs in individuals with cancer prior to

12

infection (either any solid tumors, or hematologic malignancy after time of blood draw for

13

genotyping) conferred stronger effects for sepsis (HR 2.8; 95% CI 2.3 to 3.4; P=9.7x10-26) and

14

respiratory system infections (HR 1.6; 95% CI 1.4 to 1.8; P=6.1x10-12) compared to individuals

15

without a prior cancer history (sepsis: HR 1.3; 95% CI 0.8 to 2.0; P=0.33, Pheterogeneity=0.001;

16

respiratory system infections: HR 1.2; 95% CI 1.0 to 1.3; P=0.045, Pinteraction=0.001) (Extended

17

Data Figure 6,7; Supplementary Note 14,15). This interaction was driven by prevalent solid

18

cancer, not hematologic cancer after DNA acquisition for mCA genotyping (Supplementary

19

Table 6). Further multivariable adjustment indicated that incident sepsis and infection were

20

independent of chemotherapy, neutropenia, aplastic anemia, decreased white blood cell count,

21

bone marrow or stem cell transplant, and radiation effects prior to infection (with these

22

phenotypes defined using ICD-10 and ICD-9 phecode groupings19) (Extended Table 1).

Association with COVID-19 hospitalization

2

Across 719 COVID-19 hospitalized cases in the UKB, 44 individuals (6%) carried an expanded

3

mCA clone at time of enrollment (in 2010), versus 3% among 337,877 controls. Adjusting for

4

age, age2, sex, prior or current smoking status, and principal components of ancestry, expanded

5

mCAs were associated with COVID-19 hospitalizations (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.1 to 2.2; P=0.0082),

6

with higher effect estimates from expanded autosomal mCAs (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.2 to 4.1;

7

P=0.02) (Figure 3a). Analyses in FinnGen showed evidence of independent replication. The

8

meta-analyzed associations across UKB and FinnGen of expanded autosomal mCAs on COVID-

9

19 hospitalization was OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.5, P=0.004 (Figure 3a,b). Similar to prior

10

phenotypes, the fraction of individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 increased with cell fraction,

11

with particularly strong slopes after cell fraction >10% (Figure 3c). In the UKB, further

12

sensitivity analysis was performed; the associations persisted with additional adjustment for

13

normalized Townsend deprivation index, normalized body mass index, type 2 diabetes mellitus,

14

hypertension, coronary artery disease, any cancer, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary

15

disease (Extended Data Figure 8a). Additionally, similar associations were observed in the

16

UKB when comparing COVID-19 hospitalization to tested negative controls, COVID-19

17

positive to all from English provinces and, COVID-19 positive to tested negative controls

18

(Extended Data Figure 8b). Similar to the diverse nature of mCA clones observed in cases of

19

incident infection, specific mCA clones carried by COVID-19 hospitalized individuals were also

20

diverse in nature – across multiple chromosomes, a wide range of sizes, and both gain, loss, and

21

CNN-LOH copy changes (Figure 3d). Similar effects associations effects of expanded mCAs

22

with COVID-19 were also observed with incident pneumonia in the UKB (Extended Data

23

Figure 8c).

Germline genetic predisposition to expanded mCAs

3

To further elucidate causal factors for expanded mCA clones, we performed a genome-wide

4

association study (GWAS) in the UKB. We identified 63 independent genome-wide significant

5

loci (r2< 0.1 across 1MB windows of the genome) (Figure 4a, Supplementary Data 3). Across

6

the 63 germline variants, significant correlation was seen between different mCA categories

7

(Supplementary Note 16), suggesting the presence of shared germline genetic variants

8

predisposing to mCAs across the genome. Follow-up analyses using an additive polygenic risk

9

score comprised of 156 independent genome-wide significant variants associated with mosaic

10

loss-of-chromosome Y (mLOY) from males from a prior study in the UKB20, found significant

11

associations with expanded autosomal mCAs and expanded ChrX mCAs in females, further

12

highlighting the shared germline contributors towards mCAs across the genome

13

(Supplementary Note 17). TWAS combining the expanded mCA GWAS results with

14

GTEXv821 whole blood expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) using UTMOST22 prioritized

15

62 genes (P<3.2x10-6) promoting expanded mCA development (Figure 4b). While gene

16

enrichment analyses with the Elsevier Pathway Collection did not identify significantly

17

associated pathways after multiple testing correction, top pathways were linked to DNA damage

18

repair and lymphoid processes (Extended Data Figure 9a). The corresponding GWAS locus-

19

zoom plots for some of these immune-related genes are shown in Extended Data Figure 9b. To

20

prioritize tissues most implicated by these loci, tissue enrichment analyses using GenoSkyline-

21

Plus were performed. Significant enrichment was identified in immune-specific epigenetic and

22

Discussion:

2
3

Across four geographically distinct biobanks comprising 767,891 individuals without known

4

hematologic malignancy, clonal hematopoiesis (CH) represented by expanded mCAs is

5

increasingly prevalent with age but not readily detectable by conventional medical blood tests. In

6

addition to strongly predicting future risk of hematologic malignancy, expanded mCAs were also

7

associated with risk for diverse incident infections, particularly sepsis and respiratory infections.

8

These findings were robust across age, sex, tobacco smoking, and were strongest among those

9

who develop cancer. Consistent with these observations, expanded mCAs were also associated

10

with increased odds for COVID-19 hospitalization.

11
12

These results support several conclusions. First, mCA-driven CH is a potential risk factor for

13

infection. Recent work showed that CH with myeloid malignancy driver mutations, also referred

14

to as ‘clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential’ (CHIP), predisposes to myeloid

15

malignancy and coronary artery disease23-27. Meanwhile, CH with larger chromosomal

16

alterations (i.e., mCAs) predisposes primarily to lymphoid malignancy but not coronary artery

17

disease3-5,8,9. Our observations suggest CH defined by the presence of mCAs is a risk factor for

18

infection. Since the relationship between mCAs and infection risk was not substantially

19

attenuated when adjusting for leukocyte or lymphocyte counts at baseline visit, the impact of

20

mCAs on infection risk likely acts through mechanisms independent of the impact of CH on cell

21

counts. For example, as mCAs alter gene dosage (e.g., via duplications and deletions) and

22

remove allelic heterogeneity (e.g., copy neutral loss-of-heterozygosity events) in leukocytes,

23

potential impacts on the differentiation, function, and survival of leukocytes are mechanisms that

12

1

could lead to altered infection risk. Our germline analyses specifically implicate lymphoid

2

tissues. In particular, many of the mCA susceptibility loci are the same as those found in chronic

3

lymphocytic leukemia, a condition in which lymphocyte differentiation and function is altered

4

promoting infection risk28-31. Therefore, molecular changes in leukocytes that promote clonal

5

expansion may occur at the expense of reduced ability to combat infection.

6
7

Second, the infectious disease risk associated with mCAs is exacerbated in the setting of cancer.

8

It is well-established that mCAs in blood-derived DNA increase risk for hematologic cancer3-5.

9

Furthermore, recent evidence suggests an association between mCAs detected in blood-derived

10

DNA and increased risk of select solid tumor7,10,32. Our analysis identified an interaction between

11

mCAs and prior cancer diagnosis that amplified sepsis and pneumonia risk. Importantly, this

12

interaction was restricted to individuals with solid cancers, not antecedent blood cancer. While

13

this observation could be partially due to synergistic immunosuppressive side effects of cancer

14

therapies33, the observed associations persisted despite adjustment for many of these treatments.

15

Alternatively, abnormal regulation of immune inflammatory pathways that release cytokines and

16

inflammatory cells may create chronic states of inflammation in individuals with mCAs34,35.

17

Surveillance for expanded mCA clones, particularly among those who develop solid cancer, may

18

help identify individuals at high risk for infection that could benefit from targeted interventions.

19
20

Third, our findings could have particular relevance for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We

21

observed that mCAs are associated with elevated risk for COVID-19 hospitalization, with greater

22

than two-fold risk linked to expanded autosomal mCAs. Maladaptive immune responses,

23

particularly in leukocytes, increase risk for severe COVID-19 infections36-39. Awareness of

13

1

COVID-19 risk associated with mCAs may help with the prioritization of emerging prophylactic

2

treatments and initial vaccination programs. However, whether immune response to conventional

3

vaccination approaches is altered in the context of mCAs deserves further study.

4
5

This analysis of mCAs and infection had some limitations. First, our study only measures mCAs

6

at one time point for each participant. While our sampled mCA time point is likely correlated

7

with CH at time of infection, CH dynamically changes over time potentially leading to

8

differences in cellular fraction or additional undetected events that were acquired prior to

9

infection. Second, we cannot rule out the possibility of undiagnosed hematologic malignancy

10

among individuals with mCAs with only blood DNA. However, given the observed prevalence

11

of mCAs (4% by age 60 years) among individuals without diagnosed hematologic malignancy

12

and general scarcity of hematologic malignancy in the general population, we anticipate

13

undiagnosed hematologic malignancy at DNA acquisition to be uncommon. Third, despite the

14

robust adjustment and sensitivity analyses performed in our statistical analysis, including

15

adjustment for chemotherapy, bone marrow transplant, radiation, and other features associated

16

with poor cancer prognosis (neutropenia, aplastic anemia, decreased white blood cell count), we

17

cannot completely rule out the impact of residual confounding in our results from unknown or

18

unmeasured sources. Consistency across cohorts and infection types and biologic plausibility

19

mitigates this possibility, but functional studies testing the hypothesis that these represent causal

20

relationships merit consideration.

21
22

In conclusion, we report evidence for increased susceptibility to a spectrum of infectious diseases

23

in individuals carrying mCAs in a detectable fraction of leukocytes. The impacts of mCA on

Online Methods:

Study samples

4

A total of 767,891 individuals across four biobanks were analyzed: UK Biobank (UKB), Mass

5

General Brigham Biobank (MGBB), FinnGen, and Biobank Japan (BBJ)40-42. Across all three

6

cohorts, written informed consent was previously obtained from all participants. Individuals with

7

known hematologic cancer at time of or prior to blood draw for genotyping were removed from

8

all analyses. Additional information on each cohort is provided in Supplementary Note 1.

9
10

Mosaic chromosomal alteration detection

11

Mosaic chromosomal alteration (mCA) detection has been previously described in the UKB4,5

12

and BBJ3. mCA detection in the MGBB and FinnGen were performed with the Mosaic

13

Chromosomal Alterations (MoChA) software and pipeline (https://github.com/freeseek/mocha).

14

Briefly, genotype intensities were transformed to log2(R ratio) (LRR) and B-allele frequency

15

(BAF) values to estimate total and relative allelic intensities, respectively, as previously

16

described43. Further details regarding the mCA detection are provided in Supplementary Note

17

1-5. Across all three studies, expanded mCA refers to the presence of at least one detectable

18

mCA present in >10% of circulating leukocytes (e.g., cell fraction >10%). A 10% cell fraction

19

threshold was employed since this has been previously linked to greater clonal haematopoiesis-

20

related risk for incident mortality10 and myocardial infarction23, additionally this subset was

21

observed to most strongly associate with phenotypes in the UK Biobank including aberrant blood

22

cell counts, incident hematologic cancer, and incident infections (Figure 1d, 2a,b, Extended

23

Data Figure 3ab). Autosomes and sex chromosomes were also separately considered; only

24

autosomal mCAs were available for BBJ.

Clinical outcomes

3

Definitions for infection outcomes are detailed in Supplementary Data 1,2. In the UKB, the

4

first reported occurrences over median 8-year follow-up in Category 2410 were used as

5

categorized by the UKB which maps primary care data, ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes from hospital

6

inpatient data, ICD-10 codes in death register records, and self-reported medical conditions

7

reported at the baseline, to ICD-10 codes. For each set of phenotypes grouped by organ system

8

or by category, the time to first incident event after baseline examination in individuals free of

9

prevalent history of each disease category was used. In the MGBB, electronic health record data

10

was used to define incident ICD-10 codes grouped in the same fashion after DNA collection date

11

over a median 3-year follow-up. In FinnGen, phenotypes were grouped together across ICD-8,

12

ICD-9, and ICD-10 codes (Supplementary Data 2), with incident infections defined after DNA

13

collection date over a median 3-year follow-up. In BBJ, analyses were performed using fatal

14

incident events attributed to diverse infection outcomes in Supplementary Data 1 since non-

15

fatal incident events were not available; additionally, analyses for pneumonia were performed

16

using history of pneumonia prior to genotyping, based on interviews and medical record

17

reviews41. Other clinical phenotypes defined in the UKB, MGBB, and FinnGen are detailed in

18

Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Data 6-8.

20

UKB coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), from SARS-CoV-2 infection, phenotypes used in

21

the present analysis were downloaded on July 27, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined

22

by polymerase chain reaction from nasopharygeal, oropharyngeal, or lower respiratory samples

23

obtained between March 16, 2020 and July 17, 2020. COVID-19 hospitalized cases were defined

as any individual with at least one positive test who also had evidence for inpatient

2

hospitalization (Field 40100). Controls included two sets: (1) participants from UKB English

3

recruitment centers who were not known to have COVID-19, which were individuals with

4

negative or no known SARS-CoV-2 testing or (2) participants with a negative SARS-CoV-2 test.

5

Individuals with COVID-19 of unknown or low severity (i.e., at least one positive SARS-CoV-2

6

test without a known hospitalization) were excluded from the primary analyses.

7

Replication was performed in FinnGen where SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined either by

8

polymerase chain reaction or by antibodies for samples obtained between March 2, 2020 and

9

July 27, 2020. Across both cohorts, individuals who died prior to March 1, 2020, and therefore

10

were not at risk for COVID-19 infection, were excluded from COVID-19 analyses.

11
12

Statistical methods for infection associations

13

Association analyses of expanded mCAs with primary incident infection across 10 main

14

infectious disease organ system categories (listed under “organ system” in Supplementary Data

15

1) were performed using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for age, age2, sex, ever

16

smoking status, and principal components 1-10 from the genotyping data. Time since DNA

17

collection was used as the underlying timescale. The proportional hazards assumption was

18

assessed by Schoenfeld residuals and was not rejected. Individuals with a history of

19

hematological cancer prior to DNA collection were excluded. P-value threshold for significance

20

among the primary organ system infection analyses was two-sided 0.05/10=0.005 to account for

21

multiple hypothesis-testing. Secondary and sensitivity analyses are detailed in the

22

Supplementary Note 1. Analyses of incident events were performed separately in each biobank

23

using the survival package in R (version 3.5, R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). Meta-analyses of

the UKB, MGBB, and FinnGen results were performed using a fixed effects model from the

2

meta package.

3
4

For UKB COVID-19 analyses, logistic regression was performed to estimate the association

5

between expanded mCAs and COVID-19 hospitalization using the aforementioned phenotype

6

definition, adjusting for sex, age, age2, smoking status, and the first ten principal components

7

from the genotyping data. As above, individuals with prevalent hematologic cancer were

8

excluded from analyses. For the COVID-19 analyses, statistical significance was assigned at

9

two-sided p-value < 0.05. Secondary multi-variable models were additionally adjusted for

10

normalized Townsend deprivation index44, inverse rank normalized body mass index at baseline,

11

type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, any cancer, asthma, and chronic

12

obstructive pulmonary disease.

13

Genome-wide association study

14

GWAS was performed using Hail-0.2 software (https://hail.is/) on the Google cloud. Variants

15

were filtered to high-quality imputed variants (INFO score >0.4), with minor allele frequency

16

>0.005, and with Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium P>1x10-10, as previously performed. A Wald-

17

logistic regression model was used for analysis, adjusting for age, age2, sex, ever smoking, PC1-

18

10, and genotyping array. Significant, independent loci were identified using P<5x10-8 and

19

clumping in Plink-2.0 using an r2 threshold of 0.1 across 1MB genomic windows using the 1000-

20

Genomes Project European reference panel. An additive mLOY polygenic risk score was

21

developed as such: ∑,*./ 𝐵𝑒𝑡𝑎 × 𝑆𝑁𝑃*+ , where 𝐵𝑒𝑡𝑎 is the weight for each of the 156

22

independent genome-wide significant variants previously identified in UKB males20 and 𝑆𝑁𝑃*+ is

23

the number of alleles (i.e., 0, 1, or 2) for 𝑆𝑁𝑃* in female 𝑗 in the UKB.

Cell-type enrichment analyses

2

We applied partitioned LD score regression using the LDSC software45 to perform enrichment

3

analysis using the expanded mCA GWAS summary statistics in combination with tissue-specific

4

epigenetic and transcriptomic functionality annotations from GenoSkyline-Plus22. In addition to

5

the baseline annotations for diverse genomic features as suggested in the LDSC user manual, we

6

specifically examined the enrichment signals on two tiers of annotations of different resolutions:

7

GenoSkyline-Plus functionality scores of 7 broad tissue clusters (immune, brain, cardiovascular,

8

muscle, gastrointestinal tract, epithelial, and others); and GenoSkyline-Plus functionality scores

9

of 11 tissue and cell types within the immune cluster (listed in Figure 8D).

10

Transcriptome-wide association and pathway enrichment analysis

11

Transcriptome-wide association was performed using the expanded mCA GWAS summary

12

statistics in combination with the UTMOST46 whole blood model updated to GTEXv8 (N=670).

13

Significant genes were identified using a Bonferroni cutoff of P<0.05/15,625 or 3.2x10-6.

14

Pathway enrichment analyses was performed using genes with TWAS P<0.001 using the

15

Elsevier Pathways through the EnrichR web server47.

Figure 1: Study schematic. a. Genome-wide mCAs were detected across the UKB4, MGBB (via
the MoChA pipeline), FinnGen (via the MoChA pipeline), and BBJ3. Association of expanded
mCAs (cell fraction >10%) with incident infectious diseases in UKB, MGBB, and FinnGen and
with incident infectious disease mortality in BBJ was performed. A GWAS for expanded mCAs
was then performed in the UKB to discover causal factors for expanded mCAs. Using the
GWAS results, cell-specific functional enrichment analyses were performed using GenoSkylinePlus, which combines epigenetic and transcriptomic annotations with GWAS summary statistics
to estimate the relative contribution of cell-specific functional markers to the GWAS results.
Additionally, to prioritize putative causal genes and pathways promoting the development of
expanded mCAs, whole blood TWAS was performed using UTMOST via GTEx v8. Association
of b. all expanded mCAs with cell fraction >10%, and c. all expanded autosomal mCAs, with
age using 5-year age bins stratified by sex among individuals in the UKB, MGBB, FinnGen, and
BBJ combined. Plots by cohort and across other mCA groupings are available in
Supplementary Note 7, 8. d. Associations of mCA cell fraction with blood counts (in units of
10^9 cells/L) in the UKB among individuals without prevalent hematologic cancer at time of
blood draw for genotyping and cell count measurement. The dotted horizontal lines reflect the
mean blood count for individuals without an mCA. The dotted vertical lines at cell fraction of
0.10 represents the cutoff for the expanded mCA definition. Individuals with known hematologic
cancer at time of or prior to blood draw for genotyping were excluded.

Figure 2: Associations of expanded mCAs with incident infections. Visualizing the dependence
with cell fraction among a. all mCAs, and b. autosomal mCAs, of any incident infection and
incident sepsis in the UKB among individuals without prevalent hematologic cancer at time of
blood draw for genotyping across. The dotted vertical lines at cell fraction of 0.10 represents the
cutoff for the expanded mCA definition. c. Association of all expanded mCAs, and separately,
expanded autosomal mCAs with incident infections across individuals in the UKB, MGBB, and
FinnGen. Analyses are adjusted for age, age2, sex, smoking status, and principal components 110 of ancestry. Individuals with prevalent hematologic cancer were excluded from analysis.
Association analyses for other groupings of mCAs (including across all mCAs regardless of cell
fraction, as well as chrX and chrY mCAs are provided in Supplementary Notes 10, 12). BBJ =
BioBank Japan, MGBB = Mass General Brigham Biobank, mCA = mosaic chromosomal

Figure 4: Inherited risk factors for expanded mCAs: GWAS, TWAS, and Cell Type Enrichment.
a. GWAS for expanded mCA identified 63 independent loci. b. Quantile-quantile plot of the
whole blood TWAS of the expanded mCA GWAS using 670 samples from GTExv8 shows
enrichment across 62 genes. The horizontal dotted line reflects the Bonferroni-adjusted p-value
for significance. Genes with TWAS P<5x10-8 or those important in the pathway-enrichment
analyses from Extended Data Figure 9 are labeled. c. cell-type enrichment results from the
Expanded mCA GWAS across immune, brain, cardiovascular (CV), muscle, gastrointestinal
(GI), epithelium, and other tissues as annotated using GenoSkyline-Plus annotations. D.
Zooming in to show the stratified enrichment by specific categories of immune cells and tissues.
Across panels C. and D., the vertical dotted lines indicate (1) P=0.05 for suggestive enrichment,
and (2) the Bonferroni-adjusted P-value for significant enrichment. GWAS = genome wide
association study, TWAS = transcriptome-wide association study, CV = cardiovascular, GI =

Extended Data Figure 3: Association of mCAs with incident cancer in the UK Biobank.
Association of a) all mCA and b) autosomal mCA cell fraction with incident hematologic cancer.
The dotted vertical line at cell fraction of 0.1 shows the cutoff point for expanded mCAs (defined
as mCAs with cell fraction >10%). c) Association of expanded mCA categories ( with cell
fraction>10%) with incident cancer in the UK Biobank. Analyses are adjusted for age, age2, sex,
smoking status, and principal components of ancestry. Individuals with a history of hematologic
cancer at enrollment were removed from analysis. CLL = chronic lymphocytic leukemia, MPN =
myeloproliforative neoplasm, mCA = mosaic chromosomal alterations

Extended Data Figure 8: Associations of expanded mCAs in the UK Biobank with COVID-19
and incident pneumonia. Associations of expanded mCAs with a. COVID-19 hospitalization
across different adjustment models, and b. different COVID-19 phenotypes in a fully adjusted
model. Adjustment models include 1) an unadjusted model, 2) a sparsely adjusted model which
adjusts for age, age2, sex, smoking status, and principal components of ancestry, and 3) a fully
adjusted model which additionally adjusts for Townsend deprivation index, BMI, and the
following comorbidities: Asthma, COPD, CAD, T2D, any cancer, and HTN. mCA = mosaic
chromosomal alterations, COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, CAD = coronary
artery disease, T2D = type 2 diabetes mellitus. c. Association of expanded mCAs with incident
pneumonia stratified by sex, adjusted for age, age2, sex (in the All model only), smoking status,
and principal components of ancestry. mCA = mosaic chromosomal alterations

Extended Table 1: Sensitivity analysis of expanded autosomal mCA with incident sepsis and
with pneumonia association in the UK Biobank among those with cancer prior to incident
infection, separately adjusting for chemotherapy, neutropenia, aplastic anemia, decreased white
blood cell count, bone marrow or stem cell transplant, and radiation effects prior to infection (as
defined using the Vanderbilt ICD-10 and ICD-9 phecode groupings10). Other covariates in the
model included age, age2, sex, smoking status, and PC1-10 of ancestry. The summary stats (HR,
P-value, 95% CI) reflect those for the expanded autosomal mCA term in each model.
CI = confidence interval; HR = hazard ratio; mCA = mosaic chromosomal alteration; N =
number; NOS = not otherwise specified
