Abstract
Objectives: The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating from Wuhan has rapidly
spread throughout China. While the origin of the outbreak remains uncertain,
accumulating evidence links a wet market in Wuhan for the early spread of 2019-nCoV.
Similarly, the influence of the marketplace on the early transmission dynamics is yet to
be investigated.
Methods: Using the daily series of 2019-nCov incidenceincluding contact history with
the market, we have conducted quantitative modeling analyses to estimate the
reproduction numbers (R) for the market-to-human and human-to-human transmission
together with the reporting probability and the early effects of public health
interventions.
Results: Our mean R estimates for China in 2019-2020 are estimated at 0.37 (95%CrI:
0.02-1.78) for market-to-human transmission, and 3.87 (95%CrI: 3.18-4.78) for
human-to-human transmission, respectively. Moreover we estimated that the reporting
rate cases stemming from market-to-human transmission was 3-31 fold higher than that
for cases stemming from human-to-human transmission, suggesting that contact history
with the wet market played a key role in identifying 2019-nCov cases.

Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the proportions of asymptomatic and subclinical
patients constitute a substantial component of the epidemic’s magnitude. Findings
suggest that the development of rapid diagnostic tests could help bring the epidemic
more rapidly under control.

Introduction

A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) originating from Wuhan has rapidly spread
throughout China, with multiple cases exported to 25 countries around the world. The
cumulative number of confirmed cases has reached 75204 including 2006 deaths as of
February 19, 2020 [1]. Early mean estimates of the reproduction number have been
estimated in the range 1.4-2.5, comparable with estimates for seasonal, 2009 pandemic
flu, SARS and MERS [2-5]. The epidemic continues to spread throughout China at an
alarming rate while chains of transmission start to unfold in other countries including
Singapore, Korea, and Japan, indicating that the possibility of a pandemic scenario cannot
be ruled out.

Evidence suggest that the novel coronavirus likely jumped from a primary reservoir (e.g,
horseshoe bats) to an intermediary reservoir, possibly generating an outbreak among wild
animals in at least one wet market in Wuhan, China [6-7]. The virus first infected multiple
individuals visiting the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, initiating multiple chains of
transmission that ensured sustained transmission in the human population [8]. While the
detailed origin of the outbreak remains uncertain, significant evidence strongly links the

Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan for the early spread of the novel
coronavirus (COVID-19) among humans [7].

In this paper we conduct quantitative modeling analyses to quantify the role of the wet
marketplace on the early transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus in China [9].
For this purpose, we analyzed and modeled data that stratifies the market hazard
(market-to-human transmission) and human-to-human transmission.

Materials and methods

Epidemiological incidence cases

Daily series of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were extracted from a
recently published study [7]. From December 8, 2019 to January 21, 2020, we analyzed
a total of 425 confirmed cases by date of symptoms onset including information on
whether the case was linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. That is, this
unique case series stratifies cases with visiting history to the Huanan Seafood
Wholesale Market, which has been purported as source of this large epidemic [9], and
those arising from human-to-human transmission. Because the corresponding incidence
curve is subject reporting delays, the last 12 epidemic days were excluded from our
analysis. Thus, the study period is set from December 8th, 2019 to January 9th, 2020.

Epidemiological modelling

We model two types of infections: a) market hazard (market-to-human
transmission, including primary infections arising from zoonotic transmission to some
extent) and b) human-to-human transmission chains. A model schematic of the
transmission dynamics is provided in Figure 1. Primary infection (index case) occurs as
a result of a spillover event, and primary infections may generate secondary cases. The
number of infected individuals stemming from the market-to-human and the
human-to-human route are denoted by im and ih, respectively.

We employed a discrete-time integral equation to capture the daily incidence
series with contact history. Let fs denote the probability mass function of the serial
interval of length s days, which is given by

average number of secondary infections generated by one single infection generated
from the market-to-human or from the human-to-human transmission, respectively.

To account for the type of infection dependent probability of occurrence, θ j
[12], we assume that the number of observed cases for infection type j on day t, hj(t),
occurred according to a Bernoulli sampling process, with the expected values E(cj;Ht-1),
where E(cj; Ht-1) denotes the conditional expected incidence, on day t, given the history
of observed data from day 0 to day (t-1), denoted by Ht-1. Thus, the number of expected
newly observed cases is written as follows:

Subsequently, we also account for the reporting probability that depends on the
type of infection. We assume that the number of reported cases by infection type j on
day t, hj(t), is the product of type-dependent reporting rate, qj, and the actual number of
cases, cj(t).
Further, we model the time-dependent variation in the transmissibility
associated with implementation of public interventions in Wuhan. This time dependence
was modelled by introducing a parameter δti, by transmission route. Time dependence in
primary infection and secondary infection is given by

The serial interval is assumed to follow a gamma distribution with the mean and SD at
7.5 and 3.4 days, respectively, based on ref. [8]. The maximum value of the serial
interval was fixed at 16 days as the cumulative probability distribution of the gamma
distribution up to 16 days reaches 0.97.
For sensitivity analyses, we examined the effect of varying the mean of the
serial interval on Rj by varying the mean serial interval from 5.5 to 9.5 days.
We estimated model parameters and made projections using a Monte Carlo
Markov Chain (MCMC) method in a Bayesian framework. Point estimates and the
corresponding 95% credibility intervals were drawn from the posterior probability
distributions. All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.5.2 (R Foundation

Results
The daily series of nCov incidence in China in 2019-2020 are displayed in
Figure 2. Visual inspection indicates that the trend of nCov laboratory-confirmed cases
that are not linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market follows a rapid growth
pattern, whereas those cases linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market follow an
overall stable incidence pattern until early January in 2020, likely associated with the
closing of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan.
Figure S1 displays the observed and model-based posterior estimates of the
daily number of nCov laboratory-confirmed cases by transmission route in China from
December, 2019 to January, 2020. Overall, our dynamic models are able to capture the
temporal dynamics (i.e. incidence) for both market-to-human and human-to-human
transmission routes. Importantly, our posterior estimates of the basic reproduction
numbers for China in 2019-2020 are estimated at 0.37 (95%CrI: 0.02-1.78) for
market-to-human, and 3.87 (95%CrI:3.18-4.78) for human-to-human, respectively.
Other parameter estimates for the probability of occurrence and reporting rate are
estimated at 0.93 (95% CrI: 0.74-1.00) and 0.028 (95% CrI: 0.02-0.04) for
market-to-human and 0.90 (95% CrI: 0.73-0.99) and 0.00 (95% CrI: 0.00-0.01) for
human-to-human, respectively. A Tukey-Kramer test indicated significant differences in
probabilities of occurrence (p <0.001) and reporting probability (p <0.001) according to

infection route. Moreover, the proportionate reduction in transmissibility brought about
the enhanced public health interventions is estimated to be 0.07 (95% CrI: 0.00-0.28)
after January 1, and to be 0.50 (95% CrI: 0.02-0.97) after January 8, 2020, which is
measured using a time-dependent scaling factor, α.
The total number of estimated laboratory-confirmed cases (i.e. cumulative
incidence) are 43.0 (95% CrI: 26.4-63.7) for cases infected though market-to-human
transmission, 174.8 (95% CrI: 134.3-216.7) for cases infected through human-to-human
transmission. For comparison, the actual numbers of reported laboratory-confirmed
cases during our study period are 43 and 187, respectively.
Furthermore, we inferred the total number of nCov infections by transmission
route to quantify the nCov burden in China during our study period. Our results indicate
that the total number of unobserved cases (i.e. cumulative infections) by subgroup are
1685.1 (95% CrI: 1375.3- 2009.2) for those cases infected though market-to-human
transmission, and 59986.9 (95% CrI: 19925.4-200988.9) for those cases infected
through human-to-human transmission.
Results of sensitivity analyses on the mean serial interval ranging from 5.5 to
9.5 are shown in Figures 3. We found that estimates of R from human-to-human
transmission are somewhat sensitive to changes in the mean serial interval, ranging
from 2.63 (95% CrI: 2.31-3.01) to 5.69 (95% CrI: 4.43-7.44), while R for primary
infections takes a relatively similar range below the epidemic threshold of 1.0.

Discussion
We have conducted statistical modeling analyses to elucidate the early
transmission characteristics of the novel COVID-19 outbreak in China from December
in 2019 to January 2020 by stratifying cases according to transmission route. In
particular, we report estimates of the reproduction numbers for market-to-human and
human-to-human transmission as well as the occurrence reporting probability and
estimate the early effects of public health interventions.
Our posterior estimates of basic reproduction numbers for China in 2019-2020
are estimated to be 0.37 (95%CrI: 0.02-1.78) for market-to-human transmission, and
3.87 (95%CrI: 3.18-4.78) for human-to-human transmission, respectively. These R
estimates that account for more details of the underlying transmission dynamics shed
light on the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. Thus, our analysis suggests that the
total number of unobserved cases (i.e. cumulative infections) are estimated to be 1685.1
(95% CrI: 1375.3- 2009.2) for unobserved cases from market-to-human transmission
and 59986.9 (95% CrI: 19925.4-200988.9) for unobserved cases from human-to-human
transmission. Our R estimates accounting for the unobserved cases (infections) makes
the estimated values somewhat higher than previous estimates based solely on observed
cases [2, 7]. More importantly, our results indicate a substantial contribution of mild
and asymptomatic cases to the epidemic, and this could influence estimates of R derived
from a single epidemic curve of observed reported cases, which does not fully capture
the transmission dynamics [13,14].
Moreover, we also identified a remarkable decrease in the reproduction
number, and this decline is in line with the timing of the closing of the Huanan Seafood

Wholesale Market (identified as the origin of the epidemic) and the official
announcement about the epidemic by China CDC. We found that R for
human-to-human transmission decreased from 3.87 (95%CrI: 3.18-4.78) to 3.53
(95%CrI: 2.84-4.35) (Relative risk reduction (RRR): 0.07 (95%CrI: 0.00-0.28)) and to
1.91 (95%CrI: 0.10-3.92) (RRR: 0.50 (95%CrI: 0.02-0.97)). However, these estimates
need to be interpreted with epidemic context in mind. Specifically, the first intervention
targeting market-to-human transmission is unlikely to have mitigated the risk of
secondary infections arising from the unfolding transmission chains. The latter decrease
is likely the result of enhanced public interventions. However, in the context of rapid
and widespread national transmission, efforts to mitigate further spread were
complicated by difficulties to track multiple chains of transmission involving cases of
the disease with a wide spectrum of illness including asymptomatic and subclinical
cases.
Furthermore, reporting probabilities for cases stemming from market-to-human
and human-to-human cases were estimated to be low, but we estimated that the
reporting rate for market-to-human route was 3-31 fold higher, suggesting that contact
history with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market played a key role in identifying
cases with COVID-19. Indeed, during the initial disease stages, infected individuals
with COVID-19 exhibit clinical features that are similar to those of other common
respiratory diseases [15]. Moreover, in the context of the ongoing influenza season, the
absence of rapid diagnostic testing for this novel disease complicate case identification
for this novel coronavirus [16]. Because polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which
are time consuming, are not widely available, there is a crucial need to develop rapid

diagnostic tests in order to improve the accuracy and speed of clinical diagnosis and
enhance reporting rates.
Our results are not free from limitations. First, the serial interval for COVID-19
assumed in our analyses was extrapolated from a previous study, and had to exclude
recent data from the epidemic curve due to reporting delays. In fact, our sensitivity
analysis on the serial interval indicate some influence on our R estimates. Further our
R estimates could be further improved using additional data collected by field
investigations. Second, we cannot rule out the possibility that some cases with contact
history with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market got infected by contact with
humans. However, our low R estimate for market-to-human transmission indicates that
such a proportion is quite low. Third, our method is a powerful tool to estimate the
underlying cases including asymptomatic and mild symptoms, and our results suggests
that those proportions constitute a large fraction of the epidemic’s magnitude. Indeed,
the result of careful screening and detailed examination of a total of 566 Japanese
returnees evacuated from Wuhan city by government-chartered planes during January
29-3, 2020 revealed a ratio of 5 asymptomatic to 4 symptomatic cases [17]. In addition,
one study reported that the majority of seasonal coronavirus infections are
asymptomatic by most symptom definitions and only 4% of individuals experiencing a
seasonal coronavirus infection episode sought medical care for their symptoms [18].
This accumulating evidence further underscores the need to account for a significant
fraction of asymptomatic cases. Future serological surveys among the local residents in
the epicenter of the epidemic and other areas will shed light into the true magnitude of
this epidemic that is having a global impact.

In summary, we have provided epidemiological and transmission parameters of
COVID-19 in China from 2019 to 2020 using an ecological model. The power of our
approach lies in the ability to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified
uncertainty from limited data collected by surveillance systems.

Figure 1 - Schematic model diagram of COVID-19 transmission dynamics

A schematic model diagram of transmission dynamics is presented. The transmission
routes are classified into market-to-human transmission and human-to-human
transmission. Infected through market-to-human route and human-to-human route is
indicated by im and ih, respectively. Reported cases of primary case infected through
market-to-human route and of secondary or later cases though human-to-human route is
indicated by cm and ch, respectively. A virus with substantial human-to-human
transmission potential could yield subsequent transmissions caused by human-to-human
transmission.
Figure 2 – Observed and posterior estimates of the daily number of the COVID-19
cases in China, 2019-2020

Total number of cases with or without contact history with the Huanan Seafood
Wholesale Market for our study period is 43 and 187, respectively. Observed
laboratory-confirmed cases are the dots. Dashed lines indicates 50 percentile, and areas
surrounded by light grey and deep grey indicates 95% and 50% credible intervals (CrI)
for posterior estimates, respectively. Upper panel (A) correspond to incidence arising
from market to human transmission. Lower panel (B) correspond to observed cases
