To the Editor:

2

In the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19), children seem to be less severely affected

3

than adults. Case series of Chinese children with COVID-19 report mostly mild symptoms of a

4

respiratory tract infection (RTI) [1, 2], though severe cases were also reported [3]. Children

5

may however shed large quantities of viral particles in respiratory secretions and faeces, even

6

when they are without symptoms of infection, and may thus contribute substantially to human-

7

to-human transmission [4–6]. Coronavirus (HCoV) detection in asymptomatic children is quite

8

common for other serotypes (OC43, NL63, 229E and HKU1) [7]. In case of severe HCoV-

9

associated disease, younger age and chronic illness are identified risk factors [7, 8].

10

Furthermore, in HCoV-infected children, other respiratory viruses are often co-detected, and

11

these other viruses may contribute to symptomatic illness [7]. Until now, bacterial co-infections

12

have not been investigated. Improved understanding of determinants of symptomatic HCoV-

13

associated illness may also increase our understanding of symptomatology and the potential

14

role of transmission of COVID-19 by the paediatric population in the current pandemic.

15

Because of a lack of data regarding the potential role of viral and bacterial co-infection in

16

symptomatology and severity of HCoV infections and COVID-19, we evaluated respiratory

17

viruses and the nasopharyngeal bacterial microbiome in the context of seasonal HCoV

18

infections in a recent case-control study of children admitted to the hospital with lower

19

respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in The Netherlands.

20

Between 2013 and 2015, we enrolled 154 children admitted with LTRI and aged between 4

21

weeks and 5 years, and 307 age-, gender- and season-matched healthy controls. Methods

22

were previously published in detail [9]. The study protocol (www.trialregister.nl, NTR5132) was

23

approved by the Dutch National Ethics Committee. Written informed parental consent was

24

obtained from all participants. In the present work, we investigated whether symptomatology

25

of HCoV infection is associated with viral and/or bacterial co-infections.

26

In short, nasopharyngeal swabs from cases at hospital admission and from healthy

27

community-dwelling controls were tested for respiratory viruses using qualitative multiplex Real

28

Time-PCR (RespiFinder® SMARTfast 22; Pathofinder, Maastricht, Netherlands) [10]. In

29

addition, bacterial DNA was isolated and sequenced using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

30

Sequencing data is publicly available from the Sequence Read Archive database (BioProject

31

ID PRJNA428382). Statistical analysis was performed in R (version 3.6.1). A p-value <0.05 or

32

a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value <0.10 was considered statistically significant. Cases

33

and controls were stratified according to HCoV detection (OC43, HKU1, NL63 or 229E).

34

Differences in age were assessed with t-tests and differences in gender with chi-square tests.

35

To test differences in viral (co-)detection and total number of viruses between groups, logistic

36

and linear regression were used, respectively, adjusting for age. Differential abundances of

37

the 50 most highly abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were tested using

38

metagenomeSeq, adjusted for age [11].

39
40

Viral data was available from 150 cases and 303 controls. HCoV was detected at a similar rate

41

in 24 (16.0%) cases and in 58 (19.1%) controls (p=0.49). In all HCoV-positive children, both

42

cases and controls, HCoV-OC43 was most commonly detected (62.5% cases, 51.7% controls;

43

p=0.52), followed by HCoV-NL63 (16.7% cases, 27.6% controls; p=0.44), HCoV-229E (16.7%

44

cases, 10.3% controls; p=0.67) and HCoV-HKU1 (12.5% cases, 12.1% controls; p=1.00).

45

There was one case with co-detection of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E,another case with both

46

HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, and one control with co-detection of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-

47

HKU1. HCoV was most frequently detected in the winter months, with 95.8% of HCoV-positive

48

cases and 84.6% of HCoV-positive controls detected between December and March. Age was

49

comparable between HCoV-positive cases (mean 17.0 months (SD 15.9)) and HCoV-positive

50

controls (mean 16.4 months (SD 14.9), p=0.88), and between HCoV-positive and HCoV-

51

negative cases (mean 17.5 months (SD 15.0), p=0.87). Gender was also comparable between

52

HCoV-positive cases (50.0%) and HCoV-positive controls (41.4%; p=0.64) as well as HCoV-

53

negative cases (36,6%; p=0.32).

54

Co-detection of other respiratory viruses with HCoV was more frequent in cases (96%) than in

55

controls (69.0%; p=0.019) (Figure 1A). The total number of viruses detected in HCoV-positive

56

cases amounted to maximum four (mean 2.5 (SD 0.9)), and was significantly higher than in

57

HCoV-negative cases (mean 1.4 (SD 0.7); p<0.001) as well as in HCoV-positive controls

58

(mean 2.1 (SD 0.9); p=0.043). Co-infection mostly concerned respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),

59

which was even significantly more often detected in HCoV-positive cases (70.8%), than in

60

HCoV-negative cases (43.9%; p=0.014; Figure 1A-B). By contrast, detection of rhinovirus was

61

lower in HCoV-positive cases (37.5%) than in HCoV-positive controls (62.1%; p=0.042; Figure

62

1A). Co-detection of other viruses in HCoV-positive cases concerned adenovirus (16.7%),

63

bocavirus (16.7%), human metapneumovirus (8.3%) and influenza virus (4.2%), though not

64

different from HCoV-positive controls and HCoV-negative cases (Figure 1A-B).

65

At the level of individual bacteria, we observed significantly increased abundances of

66

Haemophilus

67

Fusobacterium species in HCoV-positive cases compared to HCoV-positive controls. HCoV-

68

positive cases also had amongst others significantly decreased abundances of Moraxella

69

species, Helcococcus and Corynebacterium propinquum/pseudodiphtheriticum (Figure 1C).

72

were not observed (Figure 1D). H. influenzae/haemolyticus was also significantly differentially

73

abundant between HCoV-negative cases and HCoV-negative controls, though the effect size

74

was smaller than between HCoV-positive cases and HCoV-positive controls. Importantly, we

75

observed a trend toward increased H. influenzae/haemolyticus abundances in HCoV-positive

76

cases (median abundance 32.7% [IQR 0.3-78.3]) when compared to HCoV-negative cases

77

(median abundance 6.1% [IQR 0.1-49.4]; Wilcoxon test: p=0.080).

78

In summary, we have shown a high rate of 19.1% of asymptomatic HCoV carriage in healthy,

79

community-dwelling children, which is in line with previous reports [7, 8]. HCoV carriage and

80

disease seems, as most viral infections, highly seasonal in children. As aforementioned, mild

81

and asymptomatic paediatric cases with high viral loads are also observed in the current

82

COVID-19 pandemic [1–5]. The contribution to the spread of the disease by these children

83

currently remains unknown, but is potentially substantial given significant viral shedding also

84

occurs in asymptomatic children [6], and because they keep mixing with family members and

85

other individuals in the community [12].

86

We have also shown that viral co-detection in HCoV-positive children differs between

87

asymptomatic and symptomatic HCoV-positive children. Next to viral co-infection, increased

88

abundance of several bacteria such as H. influenzae/haemolyticus and Fusobacterium is also

89

associated with clinical symptoms of LRTI. By contrast, other bacteria like Moraxella as well

90

as the presence of rhinovirus are associated with absence of symptoms. This implies that co-

91

infection with specific viruses and bacteria may lead to HCoV-associated respiratory symptoms

92

in young children. Regarding COVID-19, one study indeed found a viral co-detection rate of

93

40% for paediatric patients [13], while another study with predominantly adult patients found a

94

much lower rate of 3.2% [14]. Whether microbial co-colonization may play an important role in

95

developing (severe) symptomatology of COVID-19, in children and in adults, thus remains

96

open to further investigation. This is however crucial to study to better understand disease

97

pathogenesis, and thereby inform therapy and prevention of severe HCoV-associated

98

infections.
