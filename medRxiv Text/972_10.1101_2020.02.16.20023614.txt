Abstract
Background: Since December 2019, a pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel
coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has broken out in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The
continuous rising of infected cases has imposed overwhelming pressure on public
health decision and medical resource allocation in China. We managed to forecast the
infection peak time in Hubei province and the severe and critical case distribution.
Methods: We used data resource according to cases reported by the National Health
Commission of the People’s Republic of China (Jan 25, 2019, to Feb 28, 2020) as the
training set to deduce the arrival of the peak infection time and the number of severe
and critical cases in Wuhan on subsequent days. Medical observation, discharge,
infected, non-Severe, infected and severe, cure and death data were collected and
analyzed. Using this state transition matrix model, we will be able predict when the
inflection peak time (the maximum open infection cases) in Hubei Province will occur.
Also, we can use this model to predict the patient distribution (severe, non-severe) to
better allocate medical resource. Under relative pessimistic scenario, the inflection
peak time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients
will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively.
Results: In very optimistic scenarios (daily NCC decay rate of -10%), the peak time of
open inflection cases will arrive around February 23-February 26. At the same time,
there will be a peak in the numbers of severely ill and critically ill patients, between
6800-7200 and 1800-2000, respectively. In a relative optimistic scenario (daily NCC
decay rate of -5%), the inflection case peak time will arrive around February
28-March 2. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between
7100-7800 and 1900-2200, respectively. In a relatively pessimistic scenario (daily
NCC decay rate of -1%), the inflection peak time does not arrive around the end of
March. Estimated time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically
ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. We are using the
diagnosis rate, mortality rate, cure rate as the 2/8 data. There should be room for
improvement, if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the peak time will
arrive earlier than our estimation. Also, the severe and critical case ratios are likely to

decline as the virus becomes less toxic and medical conditions improve. If that
happens, the peak numbers will be lower than predicted above.
Conclusion: We can infer that we are still not close to the end of this outbreak and the
number of critically ill patients is still climbing. Assisting critical care resources in
Hubei province requires the government to consider further tilt, and it is vital to make
reasonable management of doctors and medical assistance systems to curb the
transmission trend.

Introduction
Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by zoonotic 2019 novel coronavirus
(2019-nCoV) outbreaks in China during early December 20191.The Chinese
Government has progressively implemented several measures to stop the spread of the
epidemic2. Given the high prevalence and wide distribution of coronaviruses, the

condition will continue for some time3. As of February 10th, 2020, 37,626
laboratory-confirmed cases and 1016 death cases have been documented in China.
Pragmatic effectiveness trials are increasingly recognized as an essential component
of medical evidence and good prediction models can help formulate scientific
prevention and treatment programs4, 5.
In the recent past, two other novel coronaviruses (CoVs), severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV; in 2002) and Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV; in 2012) have emerged, and the world is placed on high
alert6, 7. They have similar symptoms, while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have low
potential for sustained community transmission8. Infections and deaths of SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV are less than 2019-nCoV, thus the previous prediction model is no
longer suitable for 2019-nCoV9.
In this study, we provide State Transition Matrix Model to predict the 2019-nCoV
infection peak and patient distribution. More importantly, from a public health
viewpoint, we then estimate the risk metrics (infectivity, severity and lethality) of the
NCP. We set up six different scenarios, in order to control for model error. So, we can
identify the close contact/patient’s state by utilizing a state vector at any moment.

Methods
Study Population
Medical observation, discharge, infected, non-Severe, infected and severe, cure and
death data and corresponding information released by the National Health
Commission of the People’s Republic of China from Jan 25, 2019, to Feb 28, 2020
were analyzed.

State Transition Matrix Model
State transition matrix modeling is a well-regarded approach widely applied in
clinical decision analysis based on computer simulation. For estimating the infection
peak time and the scale of severe and critical cases in subsequent days, we chose the
Markov model cohort simulation.

Parameter Selection and Estimate
In order to estimate the risk metrics (infectivity, severity, lethality) of the NCP, we
build a state transition matrix model as the following.

We define the states in this model. Medical Observation (MO) is a close contact of
a known infected patient is identified and put into medical observation. In the next
day, outcome could be any of the three: confirmed infection, discharged without
infection, or stay in MO. Discharge (dis) is a terminal state for a close contact, until
he or she becomes another incident of close contact again. Infected is an intermediate
state, where the patient becomes a confirmed infected case. The outcome is binary:
severe, or non-severe. And the outcome is revealed immediately. Non-Severe (INS) is
the patient also has three possible outcomes in the next day: cure, severe, or stay in
non-severe. Infected and Severe (IS), the patient has three possible outcomes in the
next day: death, non-severe, or stay in severe. Cure (Cu) is also a terminal state for the
patient. Death (D) is a terminal state for the patient. So, at any moment, we can
identify the close contact/patient’s state by utilizing a state vector, defined as the
following:

V   

 ]’

Where each element of the vector stands for one state in the same sequentially

arranged order as mentioned above. Please note that infected itself is not an
independent state, since the outcome is revealed instantaneously, so we combine
Infected with Severe and Non-Severe.
For each person, the state vector can only have one element with value of 1, and the
other elements all have value of zero. For example, if a patient is currently in state
“infected and severe”, the state vector for her is [0 0 1 0 0 0]’. The next day, her state
vector could become either [0 0 0 0 1 0]’ (cure) or stay the same.
For the sample population, the state vector is defined as the count of people in each
state. For example, if there are 100 patients being treated today, out of which 10 are
severe, and 90 are non-severe. The state vector for this sample population is [0 0 90
10 0 0]’.
Let’s define the state transition matrix as the following:

TransMatrix   
,

Where

    !"! # "$$ % "& '  " ' (
,

Suppose we have a state vector V(t) for a sample population at time t, how do we
predict the state vector V(t+1) in the next day?
Apply simple linear algebra, we can get the following equation:

V)t * 1,  TransMatrix - V)t,
Since the head count of a certain state comes from itself, all other possible
transitions into the state (e.g. INS has two possible income states, MO and IS), minus
the outcome states (IS, and Cu).
If we want to predict for N period, the equation becomes the following:

V)t * N,  TransMatrix - V)t,


If the population is limited and the transition matrix is stationary, the above formula
will be sufficient in predicting all future outcomes. In our case, the population is not
fixed, so we need to introduce the additional input into the population: new close
contacts.

Using this state transition matrix model, we will be able predict when the inflection
peak time (the maximum open infection cases) in Hubei Province will occur. Also, we
can use this model to predict the patient distribution (severe, non-severe) to better
allocate medical resource.
Although there is an intermediate state during the above hospitalization: non-severe
illness (the new standard is broken down into mild and normal), severe illness (which
can also be divided into general critical and critical), due to the lack of intermediate
state transfer probability, we combine the entire hospital period into a therapeutic state,
in order to keep the model simple. This minimizes the need for only the following five
parameters.

who collects the original data from National Health Commission. We collected
supplementary data from Hubei Health Commission. The data period starts from
2019/12/31, and ends on 2020/2/11. Data is updated on a daily basis.
Next, we describe how we estimate these parameters from empirical probabilities.

Scenario Setup
We set up six different scenarios, in order to control for model error. Two of the
scenarios are very optimistic, two of them are relatively optimistic, and two of them
are relatively pessimistickan (Table 1).

Results
Parameter Estimation
This decay rate is closely linked to R0 and is directly estimated from empirical data.
The 8-day average is -6%, but it is volatile, so we will test -1%, -5%, -10%
respectively (Figure 1A). Since we could not obtain the one-day probability of lifting
medical observation in Hubei Province, we used national rate for reference. The latest
one-day probability is 17% and the 10-day moving weighted average is 13%.
Considering that the probability of Hubei Province may be lower than that of the
whole country, we test it with 17% and 13%, respectively. (Figure 1B). In Hubei
Province, the latest one-day probability of transition from medical observation to
confirmed infection is 2.15%, with a weighted average of 3.94% over the last 10 days,
ending at 2/11. As this probability continues to decline, we use the average (3.04%) of
these two values as our model parameter to be cautiously optimistic (Figure 1C). The
latest single-day mortality rate was 0.33% and the 10-day moving weighted average
was 0.41%. As this probability continues to decline, we use the average (0.37%) of
these two values as our model parameter to be cautiously optimistic (Figure 1D). The
latest one-day cure rate is 1.46% and the 10-day moving weighted average is 1.27%.
As this probability continues to decline, we use the average (1.37%) of these two
values as our model parameter to be cautiously optimistic (Figure 1E). From the
historical data, the proportion of critical cases is relatively stable; the proportion of

severe cases fluctuates more. As these two probabilities continues to fluctuate, we also
use the average (17.56%, and 4.82%) of the latest value and 10-day moving weighted
average as our model parameters to put more weight on recent observation. (Figure
1F). The parameters we use in our forecast are listed in Table 2.

Peak Time Estimation
In very optimistic scenarios (daily NCC decay rate of -10%), the peak time of open
inflection cases will arrive around February 23-February 26. At the same time, there
will be a peak in the numbers of severely ill and critically ill patients, between
6800-7200 and 1800-2000, respectively (Figure 2A and 2B). In a relative optimistic
scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -5%), the inflection case peak time will arrive
around February 28-March 2. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients
will lie between 7100-7800 and 1900-2200, respectively (Figure 2C and 2D). In a
relatively pessimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -1%), the inflection peak time
does not arrive around the end of March. Estimated time is March 25 - April 2. The
numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and
2200-2700, respectively (Figure 2E and 2F). We are using parameters with 50%
weight on the diagnosis rate, mortality rate, cure rate as of 2/11. There should be room
for improvement, if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the peak time will
arrive earlier than our estimation. Also, the severe and critical case ratios are likely to
decline as the virus becomes less toxic and medical conditions improve. If that
happens, the peak numbers will be lower than predicted above (Figure 2G and 2H).
The parameters we use in our forecast are listed in Table 2.

Discussion
In Hubei Province, since the outbreak of 2019-nCoV and the determination of
human-to-human transmission, it has spread to all over China and even the world10.
The growth trend of its cases is exponential during the epidemic period, but with the
strict implementation of disease prevention and control, the inflection point of case
growth will come as scheduled. Our results predicted the inflection point of patient

growth and the distribution of patient status under different expectations by using
mathematical models with Infectivity, Severity, and Lethality as indicators. The
results show that under the existing medical and public health intervention, the Decay
Rate of New Close Contacts is 10%, the inflection point of growth will come as early
as February 23 (very optimistic), and the attenuation rate is 5% to 3 The beginning of
the month (relatively optimistic), and when the decay rate drops to 1%, it will arrive
at the latest on April 14 (very pessimistic).
As the birthplace of the disease, Hubei Province has mountains of confirmed and
suspected cases. In order to finally overcome the disease, Hubei Province adopted
plenty of even severe measures to restrict population movements, and adopted various
strategies, such as prohibiting assembly, delaying school and resumption of work, or
working from home, to significantly reduce the internal population contact rate.
Although cases have spread throughout China, according to plans developed and
implemented during previous major outbreaks such as SARS, the Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome or a pandemic influenza outbreak, Hubei Province has eased
intercity transmission through strict disease prevention and control and limits the
worst cases to Hubei Province11-13. Persistent and compulsory implementation, as well
as the cooperation of the people and the efforts of medical staff, will bring real relief.
Through the guidance of the inflection point of the epidemic and the distribution of
patient status, the government, medical work and tight medical resource allocation
will become more efficient and reasonable. Wu, J. T. et al. indicated that it will peak
in April with the infection rate staying put; it will reach a peak in May with the
infection rate decreasing by 25%,; if the infection rate decreases to 50%, the epidemic
will slowly increase in the first half of 2020 and will not reach its peak9.
The difficulty of the current epidemic control is that when these patients were
admitted to the hospital, only 43.1% of them were feverish at the time, and more
patients had fever during their hospitalization. A recent study showed that 2019-nCoV
was detected in stool samples from patients with abdominal symptoms14. However,
identifying and screening patients with atypical symptoms is difficult15. Rapid
interpersonal transmission between close contacts is an important feature of

2019-nCoV pneumonia

10, 16

. For SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome

(MERS), both of which are coronavirus-induced, almost all patients have fever
symptoms when they are diagnosed, and only 1-2% does not have fever17. Thus, to
promote the early inflection point, the infected people should be detected and isolated
early, the medical team need to develop a new coronavirus vaccine, strengthened
contact tracing and quarantine, and what’s more, wearing masks, avoiding crowd
contact and strengthening their own immunity are requisite.
By utilizing the official notification data on the website of the National Health
Commission, the State Transition Matrix Model predicted inflection points and
patient distribution (based on the current state of the patient and not subject to
historical factors). Owing to Hubei Province not affected by external factors such as
people mobility (return peaks) and local control, compared to the national analysis,
the effect only analyzing Hubei Province could be better. If the population is limited
and the transition matrix is fixed, the above formulas will enough to predict all future
results. However, the index of new cases will be affected by the input of PCR kit18.
Simultaneously, as for confirming diagnosis of new cases, pharyngeal swabs are not
as accurate as alveolar lavage fluid which means the possibility of false negatives.
Furthermore, CT diagnosis is recommended, yet still with uncertainty14. Therefore,
another advantage of this model is that, relative to the new cases, we choose to
analyze critical and severe cases, which possess better stability, and the main medical
resource consumption group is this group of patients. With the help of our model
would optimize the critical medical resources allocation.
At present, tremendous medical resources are deployed in Wuhan, Hubei. If there is
a slight slack in other areas, the prevention and control of the epidemic will be a
devastating blow. Community governance is the basis of social governance and the
most basic unit of national governance. In the comprehensive prevention and control
system formed by the combination of national joint defense and joint control and
group defense and group control, the community is an important coupling point, and
the social epidemic prevention and protection system must be woven in the
community. Only victory from Hubei can lead China to victory, and victory from

China will bring the global victory.
Nevertheless, there are still limitations. Primarily, critical or severe cases will be
affected by the gradually rational allocation of treatment teams and medical resources,
the strengthening of medical power or virus toxicity decreasing. As a result, the peak
time might arrive earlier than our estimates. Secondly, the impact of seasonal factors
has not been considered and supposing 2019-nCoV is affected by the season, our
prediction results may be unreliable. Hence, if these indicators continue to change, the
model could have opportunities for improvement. In addition, due to the
characteristics of severe and critical cases, there may be a huge impact on factors such
as age and complex underlying diseases. Therefore, with the increasing awareness of
the severity of the disease and the strengthening of prevention and control in various
sectors of the society, various indicators may be reduced. At the same time, because
of the instability of the previous indicators, these dynamic changes may affect the
predictive efficacy of the model.

Conclusions
We can infer that we are still not close to the end of this outbreak and the number of
critically ill patients is still climbing. And assisting critical care resources in Hubei
province requires the government to consider further tilt, and it is vital to make
reasonable management of doctors and medical assistance systems to curb the
transmission trend
