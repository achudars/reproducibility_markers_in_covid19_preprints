Abstract
A

novel

pneumonia-associated

respiratory

syndrome

named

coronavirus

disease-2019 (COVID-19), which caused by SARS-CoV-2 and broken in Wuhan, China in
the end of 2019. Unfortunately, there is no specific antiviral agent or vaccine available to
treat

SARS-CoV-2

infections.

Also,

information

regarding

the

immunological

characteristics in COVID-19 patients remains limited. Here we collected the blood
samples from 18 healthy donors (HD) and 38 COVID-19 patients to analyze changes in γδ
T cells. In comparison to HD, the γδ T cells percentage was decreased. γδ T cells are able
to immediately respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection and upregulate the activation marker
CD25. In addition, the increased expression of CD4 in γδ T cells may serve as a
biomarker for the assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

A severe pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome spread rapidly in Wuhan,
China in the end of 2019. A novel coronavirus, officially named severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, was identified as the culprit pathogen [1, 2]. It has
also been officially named as coronavirus infection disease-19 (COVID-19) by WHO,
which listed the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern. The virus
has so far caused 81,896 confirmed cases and 3,287 deaths in China according to WHO.
COVID-19 has rapidly spread in more than 180 countries worldwide, including Italia, Iran,
Japan, and the United States.
According to the transcriptome sequencing, SARS-CoV-2 shares 74.9% homology
with SARS-CoV [3] and 96% homology with a bat coronavirus at the whole-genome level,

respectively [2]. According to the pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved
non-structural proteins domains, SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive-sense RNA virus,
which belongs to the family of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [4, 5].
Currently, there is no specific antiviral agent or vaccine available to treat
SARS-CoV-2 infections. Clinical treatments for COVID-19 patients are primarily
supportive and symptomatic treatments. Although there are several potential therapeutic
targets to repurpose the existing antiviral agents or develop effective interventions against
this novel coronavirus [6], toxicology and clinical trials are required for potential uses in
the clinic. According to the pathological reports for COVID-19, it was shown that
SARS-CoV-2 mainly caused inflammatory responses in the lungs [7]. Several studies
showed that COVID-19 patients developed lymphopenia and rising pro-inflammatory
cytokines in severe cases [8, 9]. Inflammation can be triggered when innate and adaptive
immune cells detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. Innate T cells can provide a first line of
defense against pathogens. However, how innate T cells respond to SARS-COV-2
infection remains unclear.
Among innate immune cells, γδ T cells proliferate rapidly and respond to pathogens
by inducing apoptosis, mediating antigen presentation and immune regulation [10]. In
healthy adult humans, γδ T cells represent 1%-10% of the total circulating lymphocytes,
predominately displaying the CD4 and CD8 double negative phenotype [11]. However, in
some cases, a fraction of γδT cells can express either CD4 or CD8 [12-14]. γδ T cells do
not recognize classical peptide antigens, their TCRs are non-MHC restricted and they can
respond to pathogen-associated molecular patterns and produce cytokines in the

absence of TCR ligands [15].
In many infections, the number of γδ T cells increases both locally and systemically a
few days post-infection. A study found that the ratio of γδ T cells among total lymphocytes
in the lungs significantly increased in mice infected with influenza A (H1N1) virus three
days post infection [16]. This observation suggests that γδ T cells play an important role in
the host immune response. During acute HIV infection, previous studies showed that the
surface expression of the activation marker, CD25, is significantly increased on γδ T cells
[14], whereas various viruses may have different effects on the patterns of γδ T cells
activation [17, 18].
To demonstrate how γδ T cells behave upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, we analyzed the
PBMC samples from 38 patients and focused on the characterization of γδ T cell
phenotypes. We showed that upon infection, the percentage of γδ T cells in the peripheral
blood isolated from COVID-19 patients was drastically decreased when compared with
healthy donors (Figure 1A). Although in the acute or early stages of other viral infections

，

the percentage of γδ T cells increased, we observed a decrease of γδ T cells in
symptomatic patients. This might be explained that various types of virus impact γδ T cells
in different ways. It is likely that γδ T cell response, including proliferation and cellularity, is
dependent on the specific types of viral infections. It is also possible that most patients in
this study showed mild symptom besides fever, as opposed to serious illness featuring
pneumonia.
Interestingly, we found that in comparison to HD group, the percentages of CD4 γδ T
cells within the γδ T cell population increased dramatically, while CD8 γδT remained

unchanged in COVID-19 patients (Fig1 B and C). The increase of CD4 γδ T cells indicated
that in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, this particular subset of γδ T cells may play
roles in antigen presentation and facilitation of activation of adaptive immune cells, which
has been demonstrated in different models [19]. The data also suggested this subset of
immune cells could immediately respond to viral infection similar to other innate immune
cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, to provide the first line of immune defense.
Therefore, γδT cells may act as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity in
response to SARS-CoV-2 infection[20].
In COVID patients, we further observed that γδ T cells exhibited a strong activation
phenotype in COVID-19 patients based on CD25 expression (Fig2 B). However, the early
activation marker CD69 showed no difference between the patients and healthy donor
(HD) group (Fig2 A). It is possible CD69 is expressed strongly earlier during infection,
followed by reversion to the quiescent state during prolonged recovery. Since we
observed a decreased percentage of γδT cells, we suspected whether γδT cells
underwent exhaustion. However, the expression of PD-1 did not differ in γδT cells
between HD and COVID-19 patients (Fig2 C).
In summary, γδ T cells are able to immediately respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection and
upregulate the activation marker CD25. γδ T cells may act in parallel to other innate cells
to mediate both direct and indirect defenses against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the
increased expression of CD4 in γδ T cells may serve as a biomarker for the assessment
of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
