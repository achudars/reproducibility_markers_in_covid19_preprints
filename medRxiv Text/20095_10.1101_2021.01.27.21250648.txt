Several new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 have been isolated in the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Many
of the variants contain single variants of functional significance (e.g. S: N501Y increases transmissibility). To
study the occurrence and co-circulation of these variants, we have developed an easy-to-use dashboard at
janieslab.github.io/sars-cov-2.
We created a multiple sequence alignment workflow and
processing script to generate a variant dataset, which
populates this dashboard. We then use the features of the
dashboard, such as visualization of the single and complex
nucleotide variants geospatially and in a color-coded matrix
format. Users also interact with the dashboard to filter the
underlying data to regions of interest and or variants of
interest. The user can export reports based on the desired
filters, which we intend to be used for regionally specific
pandemic response. We find in Genbank, an isolate from
Massachusetts containing [(S: Q677H), (ORF3a: Q57H), (M:
A85S), (N: D377Y)] collected on September 11, 2020.
Moreover, we find that many viral isolates bear a marker
of increased transmissibility (S: N501Y) in linkage with at
least one variant of concern isolated from Ohio also range
across the Untied States and stretch from British Columbia,
Canada to Mexico. When we analyze co-circulation of more
complex variant constellations with (S: N501Y), we note that
the Upper Midwest and Northeast United States contain
these isolates.

Introduction
The United States has experienced the arrival of SARS-CoV2 variants containing mutations such as Spike N501Y that
increase transmission of the virus in the United Kingdom and
South Africa (1).
In addition, there have been reports of SARS-CoV-2 variants
containing novel mutations in the coronavirus’ Spike protein
and other single variants in low frequency locally [e.g. (S:
Q677H), (M: A85S), and (N: D377Y)]. This is shown in Table 1A in Tu et al. (2021).
The properties of this complex variant containing [(S:
Q677H), (M: A85S), and (N: D377Y)] has not yet been
studied in empirical tests. However, the authors report that
like Spike N501Y-containing variants the United Kingdom and South Africa, [(S: Q677H), (M: A85S), and (N:
D377Y)]-containing variants have increased in frequency
in Columbus, Ohio from from 10% in December 2020 to
upwards of 61% in January 2021. In another preprint by
Pater et al. (2021), authors report additional isolation of
the variant containing [(S: Q677H) and (N: D377Y)] in
Michigan, Utah, and Texas.
Note: Tu et al. (2021), in Table 1A, presents a minor single nucleotide variant that they
list as A25563G. However, in the data we have, this position contains the major SNV:
G25563T. This SNV is very common as it occurs in hundreds of isolates from North
America. SNV G25563T corresponds to amino acid substitution Q57H in ORF3a and
has risen in preponderance in Europe and the USA over 2020 (4). As such, we have
corrected this variant as G25563T, Q57H in ORF3a in our analyses.

In summary, the viral variants that have raised concern in a
few US States in recent reports are widespread. Based on
the increase in the proportion of variant viruses being sampled and some empirical evidence in the United Kingdom,
South Africa, and Ohio, these variants are likely to lead to
increased transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across North America in the coming months.

Results
Using our SARS-CoV-2 dashboard, we report on several isolates of interest put in the public domain in NIH’s Genbank
(e.g., MW454623.1 by Lemieux et al.) and several isolates in
GISAID.
This Massachusetts isolate contains: (S: Q677H), (ORF3a:
Q57H), (M: A85S), (N: D377Y), as (like another from
Ohio posted in GISAID (EPI_826463) reported in Tu et al.
(2021v2). The Massachusetts isolate was collected on
September 11, 2020. The Ohio isolates in public databases
were collected primarily in December 2020.
Here we extend these works by defining a new constellation of viral mutations in SARS-CoV-2 variant [(S:
Q677H), (ORF3a: Q57H), (M: A85S), (N: D377Y)] currently recorded in Massachusetts and Ohio from public
databases. See Figure 2.

Additional Observations.

(See Figures 1 and 3.)

• We find [(ORF3a: Q57H), (S: Q677H)] isolates in
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, and Ohio.
• Isolates of [(ORF3a: Q57H), (S: Q677H), and (N:
D377Y)] occur in Michigan, Minnesota, Utah, and
Wisconsin.
• We find [(S: N501Y), (ORf8: R52I)] isolates
widespread in the United States and with records for
Canada and Mexico, including: British Columbia,
California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland,
Wisconsin, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York,
Oklahoma, Ontario, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Quebec,
Tamaulipas Mexico, and Texas.
• We find [(S: N501Y), (N: D377Y)] isolates also
widely distributed including: British Columbia, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico,
Ohio, Oklahoma, Ontario, Oregon, Quebec, and Texas.

Conclusions
Here we show that the variants that contain mutations associated with increased transmissibility such as N501Y of the
UK and South African variant occur widely in North America. [(S: N501Y) linked to (ORF8: R52I)] or [(S: N501Y)
linked to (N: D377Y)] in viral isolates is much more geographically widespread than initially reported.
These N501Y-bearing isolates are in co-circulation and there
are several other variants that such as [(S: Q677H), (ORF3a:
Q57H), (M: A85S), (N: D377Y)], [(ORF3a: Q57H), (S:
Q677H)], [(ORF3a: Q57H), (S: Q677H), and (N: D377Y)] in
the states of Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, and Ohio.
As such, these viruses can recombine and or experience selective pressure that leads to more complex variant constellations with functional consequences.

We expect these lists of places containing these mutational
constellations to continue to increase in content and geography, and will update the SARS-CoV-2 dashboard.

Methods

Data and Code Availability

We downloaded data from the GenBank (5) and GISAID
(6, 7) public repositories with dates of isolation ranging from
March 2020 to early January 2021 with the exception of the
reference isolate from Wuhan in December 2020. We aligned
the data using MAFFT v7.310 (8) and edited out spurious ‘n’
characters added by data submitters. We used the Wuhan-Hu1 isolate (NCBI’s GenBank accession number NC_045512)
as an ungapped nucleotide reference sequence, counting from
1, to create a single .NEXUS file of 349 taxa and 29,912 characters. We did not curate the alignment beyond the last mutational position of interest, 29,402.

All code, current data, and acknowledgments are available on GitHub at github.com/janieslab/SARS-CoV2_VariantDashboard.

Bioinformatics Data Preparation and Visualization. Us-

ing AliView (9), we selected mutational positions of interest
and set each position aside as individual .FASTA files containing just the accession data and one base.
Once .FASTA files of the individual mutations of interest
were created, these files were parsed using a custom R script.
This script creates a data frame of each accession, position,
reference nucleotide, and variant nucleotide and also parses
out location information from the accession. We then join
these data with a reference table of states, countries, and latitude and longitude information. See Table 1 below for an
example.
Tableau was used as the visualization engine and provided an
interactive way to plot variant occurrence geospatially and
provides an intuitive mechanism to browse accessions by location or variant. The color-coded matrix format is much
easier to visualize complex variants than tree-based formats.
See Figure 4.
