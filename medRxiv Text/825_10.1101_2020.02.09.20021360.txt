Abstract
As of February 11, 2020, all prefecture-level cities in mainland China have reported confirmed
cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), but the city-level epidemical dynamics is
unknown. The aim of this study is to model the current dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and
predict the trend in the next 30 days under three possible scenarios in mainland China. We
developed a spatially explicit epidemic model to consider the unique characteristics of the virus
transmission in individual cities. Our model considered that the rate of virus transmission among
local residents is different from those with Wuhan travel history due to the self-isolation policy.
We introduced a decay rate to quantify the effort of each city to gradually control the disease
spreading. We used mobile phone data to obtain the number of individuals in each city who have
travel history to Wuhan. This city-level model was trained using confirmed cases up to February
10, 2020 and validated by new confirmed cases on February 11, 2020. We used the trained
model to predict the future dynamics up to March 12, 2020 under different scenarios: the current
trend maintained, control efforts expanded, and person-to-person contact increased due to work
resuming. We estimated that the total infections in mainland China would be 72172, 54348, and
149774 by March 12, 2020 under each scenario respectively. Under the current trend, all cities
will show the peak point of daily new infections by February 21. This date can be advanced to
February 14 with control efforts expanded or postponed to February 26 under pressure of work
resuming. Except Wuhan that cannot eliminate the disease by March 12, our model predicts that
95.4%, 100%, and 75.7% cities will have no new infections by the end of February under three
scenarios. The spatial pattern of our prediction could help the government allocate resources to
cities that have a more serious epidemic in the next 30 days.

1. Introduction
Wuhan, a large city with 14 million residents and a major air and train transportation hub of
central China, identified a cluster of unexplained cases of pneumonia on December 29, 2019 1.
Four patients were initially reported and all these initial cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood
Wholesale Market 2. Chinese health authorities and scientists did immediate investigation and
isolated a novel coronavirus from these patients by January 7, 2020, which is then named as
2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization 3,4. 2019-nCoV can cause acute respiratory
diseases that progress to severe pneumonia 5. The infection fatality risk is around 3% estimated
from the data of early outbreak 3,6. Information on new cases strongly indicates human-to-human
spread 1,7,8. Infection of 2019-nCoV quickly spread to other cities in China and other countries
(Figure 1). It becomes an event of global health concern 9. Up to February 11, 2020, according to
the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, all prefecturelevel cities of mainland China have confirmed cases and the total number reaches to 42667, of
whom 1016 have died and 4242 recovered; 24 oversea countries have 398 confirmed cases (1
died). Chinese government took great effort to control the spread of disease, including closing
the public transportation from and to Wuhan on January 23, extending the Spring Festival
holiday, postponing the school-back day, and suspending all domestic and international group
tours.

Wuhan, Hubei province excluding Wuhan, mainland China excluding Hubei province, and
outside mainland China.

Unfortunately, many external factors bring a challenge to control virus spreading. First, it might
be already late to stop the migration of infected cases. Evidence suggests that Wuhan is the

center of 2019-nCoV outbreak1,10. However, around 5 million Wuhan residents left Wuhan in
January 2020 due to the Spring Festival (January 24, 2020). It is very likely that a considerable
number of infected cases have moved from Wuhan to other cities before Wuhan government
implemented border control on January 23. Second, it is highly possible that infected cases
spread the virus to their family members or relatives 7. A study based on 425 patients at the early
stage of outbreak revealed that the time from infection to illness onset is 5.2 days 1. As a result,
presymptomatic cases who have left Wuhan may not be isolated themselves from their family
and relatives 11. Third, due to the sudden outbreak of virus, the preparation and resources for
preventing virus transmission are limited. The protective equipment in many hospitals in Wuhan
was in short supply so that it is difficult to maintain strict personal hygiene. With the quick
increase of infected cases, Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province have large pressure to
isolate and give medical treatment to infected people. All above factors make preventing the
spread of 2019-nCoV even more difficult than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),
another coronavirus outbreak in China 17 years ago that caused more than 8000 infections and
800 deaths.
Projecting the epidemic trend of 2019-nCoV outbreak is critical for the decision makers to
allocate resources and take appropriate actions to control virus transmission. Right after the
outbreak, several studies have retrieved the epidemiological parameters and predicted the future
situation 12–15. These studies used the reported cases at the early stage of outbreak and modeled
epidemic dynamics in Wuhan and nation-wide. A recent study 10 used air passenger data and
social medium data to forecast the spread of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan and other major Chinese
cities. They estimated that 75815 individuals have been infected in Greater Wuhan as of January
25, 2020 and epidemics are already growing exponentially in major cities of China with a 1-2
weeks lag time behind Wuhan outbreak. Although these studies at the early stage of outbreak
help us understand the key epidemiological characteristics of 2019-nCoV, the fine-scale and
updated epidemic trend in individual Chinese cities remains unknown, which is more helpful for
allocating medical resources to achieve the optimal result of preventing disease spreading.
To model the updated fine-scale epidemic dynamics of all individual cities in mainland China,
we proposed a spatially explicit approach. We first used mobile phone data to obtain the number
of people who traveled from Wuhan to each individual city. Then we developed a new
epidemiological model based the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model to fit the
dynamics of 2019-nCoV at the city level. Finally, we used this model to predict the trend under
three possible scenarios: the current trend maintained, control efforts expanded, and person-toperson contact increased due to work/school resuming.

2. Methods
Data sources
We collected the daily data of confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV Pneumonia in 306 prefecture-level
cities in mainland China up to February 11, 2020 (Supplementary data Table 1) from a platform
reporting real-time statistics of 2019-nCoV (https://ncov.dxy.cn/ncovh5/view/pneumonia). These

daily reported data were used to train and validate our epidemic model. We employed China
Unicom mobile phone database (https://www.cubigdata.cn) to obtain the inter-city human
mobility. China Unicom is one of three largest mobile service providers in China. It has 0.32
billion users. Considering that 2019-nCoV emerged in Wuhan around January 1, 2020 and
Wuhan implemented the quarantine on January 23, 2020, we collected the number of people who
have Wuhan travel history during January 1-24, 2020 in each city based on the mobile phone
dataset (Figure 2 and Supplementary data Table 2). In addition, Household Registered
Population at 2017 year-end derived from census data was used to approximate the number of
local residents in each city during 2020 Spring Festival (Supplementary data Table 2).

A spatially explicit epidemic model
Our proposed model stems from the SIR model, a classic approach to simulate epidemiological
dynamics. We modified the SIR structure based on the unique characteristics of the outbreak of
2019-nCoV. First, in all cities other than Wuhan, the initial infectious cases are most likely
imported from Wuhan10. Second, many Wuhan residents moved to other cities due to the Spring

Festival and this mobility was closed after the quarantine on January 23. Third, those people
from Wuhan have low contacts with local residents because Chinese government required them
to implement self-isolation. Last, during the past 40 days, all cities took efforts to control the
virus spreading, which slows down the daily increase of new infections (Figure 1). Accordingly,
in the modified SIR model, the susceptible variable 𝑆 was divided into two groups: 𝑆1 , the
number of local susceptible, and 𝑆2 , the number of susceptible with Wuhan travel history. These
Wuhan-inbound groups (𝑆2 ), have transmission rate (𝛽2) different from transmission rate (𝛽1) of
local residents ( 𝑆1 ) as Chinese government took measures to reduce the person-to-person
contacts. A decay rate a was introduced to tune the value of β in each day, accounting for the
gradual impact of prevention interventions in each city. In our modified SIR model, recovered
population R was extended to include those cured, died, and isolated in hospital because they
cannot transmit the virus. The differentiate equations of our modified SIR model is as follows:

Where 𝑁𝑜 is the total local population derived from the census data, and 𝑁𝑤 represents the total
population with Wuhan travel history during January 1 to January 24, estimated from mobile
phone data; I is the number of infections, 𝛽 and 𝛾 denote the daily transmission rate and daily
recovery rate respectively.
In our model, four variables need to be initialized: (1) initial number of infectious 𝐼0 , treated as a
parameter to be estimated (see next section); (2) initial number of local susceptible 𝑆10, equal to
the total number of the local population of each city 𝑆10 = 𝑁𝑜 ; (3) initial number of susceptible
traveling from Wuhan 𝑆20 , equal to the population from Wuhan excluding the initial infectious
𝑆20 = 𝑁𝑤 − 𝐼0 ; and (4) initial number of removed 𝑅0 , assuming no cured, hospitalized, or death
at initial state 𝑅0 = 0.

Estimation of model parameters
Our modified SIR model has four parameters: transmission rate 𝛽1 among local residents, 𝛽2
among people with Wuhan travel history, decay rate a, and recovery rate 𝛾. For 𝛾, we assume
that once an infected individual is hospitalized, the person will be segregated and therefore no
longer infectious. According to a recent study using the first 425 patients 1, the mean incubation
period of 2019-nCoV is 5.2 days, and the mean duration from illness onset to hospital admission

is 9.1 days. We assume that the incubation period and duration from illness onset to first medical
visit is similar with these 425 infected cases. Therefore, the estimated infectious period is 5.2 +
9.1 = 14.3 days and 𝛾 equals 1/14.3 = 0.0699.
For parameters 𝛽1, 𝛽2, and a, we used the daily cumulative confirmed cases up to February 10,
2020 to retrieve their optimal values to reflect the current dynamics in each city. We first
estimated the optimal value of 𝛽2 and a of Wuhan since its epidemic model only has one
transmission rate 𝛽2. Then, the estimated 𝛽2 was used as a prior parameter for the estimation of
𝛽1 and a for individual prefecture-level cities. The Nelder-Mead algorithm 17 was employed to
estimate parameters through minimizing the sum of squared differences between the simulated
and actual daily cumulative confirmed cases. To better capture the current trend, the number of
daily cumulative cases were also used to weight the samples in parameter retrieval. Since the
epidemic model is highly sensitive to the initial infectious number I0, and the reported initial
infectious number often has large uncertainty, we treated the initial infectious number 𝐼0 as
another parameter to be estimated together with 𝛽1 and 𝛽2 . Specifically, we used daily
cumulative confirmed cases of each city from January 25 to February 10, 2020 to retrieve the
parameters and assumed January 20, 2020 as the start point when massive inter-city mobility
happened before the Spring Festival. The goodness of model fitting was assessed by comparing
the number from model simulation and reported cases. The trained model was further validated
using the reported data on February 11, 2020.

Prediction of different scenarios
We predicted the epidemic dynamics in the next 30 days under three scenarios: the current trend
maintained (scenario 1), control efforts expanded (scenario 2), person-to-person contacts
increased due to work resuming (scenario 3). These three scenarios were designed by
considering the joint effect of virus transmissibility and outbreak control 18,19 and realized by
manipulating model parameters from February 11, 2020 to March 12, 2020 (see an example in
Figure 3). Decay rate 𝑎 reveals the effectiveness of government control and removal rate 𝛾
represents the promptness of medical treatment. Therefore, scenario 1 keeps a value the same as
the trained model. In scenario 2, we doubled the value of a to reflect more efforts in each city for
controlling the disease. In scenario 3, the interference of work resuming was considered, so a
short rebound was introduced to the transmission rate 𝛽 (i.e. changing a to -a during February
11-15 period). 𝛾 in all scenarios gradually increased from 1/14.3 to 1/9.8 in the 30 days to reflect
the reduction of average diagnostic isolation time 20.

3. Results
Parameter estimation
To examine the goodness of model fitting, we calculated R-squared and root mean square error
(RMSE) between the fitting result and confirmed cases in each city (see representative examples
in Figure 4). The median value of R-squared and RMSE across all cities is 0.96 and 1.20
respectively, indicating that our model can well fit the current spreading trend. We examined the
fitted models with R-squared less than 0.7 (26 out of 306 cities) and found that all these cities
have very small number (1-3) of confirmed cases and the number does not change in the past
several days. It is reasonable to assume that these cities have completely controlled the spreading
and no new infected cases will emerge in the future. Therefore, for these cities with R-squared
less than 0.70, the 𝛽1 value of the city was set to zero.

with representative severity of disease spreading: (a) Wuhan, (b) Xiaogan, (c) Beijing, (d)
Chengdu, (e) Kunming, and (f) Datong
Transmission rate 𝛽2 estimated using Wuhan confirmed cases is 0.9, reflecting a high
transmission around January 20. The transmission rate 𝛽1 , decay rate a, and initial infectious
population 𝐼0 vary from city to city (Supplementary data Table 3). As the transmission rate
among local residents in each city, 𝛽1 reflects the intensity of control measures adopted by each
local government at the beginning of outbreak, as well as the awareness of citizens to take
protective measures. For example, 𝛽1 in megacities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and
Shenzhen are low (Figure 5.a) which may attribute to higher health literacy of their citizens 21,
although they have intensive traffic and population mobility. Decay rate a reflects the continuous
effort input by each city to control the transmission of disease. It shows that decay rates of cities
close to Wuhan is generally lower than other cities (Figure 5.b), suggesting the big challenge
faced by these cities to control the disease spreading.

confirmed cases
Model validation
To test the prediction capacity of our model, we used the reported confirmed cases on February
11 in all cites excluding Wuhan because its high confirmed case leads to bias in assessment. We
compared the predicted daily new infections on February 11 with the reported confirmed cases in
the same day. The predicted values by our model well match the reported infected cases (Rsquared: 0.86, RMSE: 6.35, P < 0.0001, Figure 6.a). To demonstrate the effectiveness of our
model, the results was compared with the prediction from the classic SIR model that uses
uniform parameters estimated from nationwide data (𝛽= 0.209, 𝛾=0.0699). Compared with our
model, the predicted values by the classic SIR model does not match with the daily new infected
cases (R-squared: 0.30, RMSE: 13.22, P < 0.0001, Figures 6.b).

Epidemic dynamics under three scenarios
We predicted daily infected cases of each city up to March 12, 2020 under three different
scenarios (scenario 1 - the current trend maintained; scenario 2 - control efforts expanded; and
scenario 3 - person-to-person contacts increased due to work resuming). Our prediction shows
that the whole mainland China will have 72172, 54348, and 149774 people infected up to March
12, 2020 under the above three scenarios respectively (Supplementary data Table 4). To provide
an intuitive picture about epidemic dynamics in different scenarios, we showed in Figure 7 the
number of cumulative infections in each city on March 12. The infected people will mainly
distribute in the central and eastern provinces, the number of western cities at a relatively low
level under all scenarios. In scenario 3 (Figure 7.c), many cites have much larger number of
infections than scenario 1 (Figure 7.a) and 2 (Figure 7.b), suggesting that work resuming will
bring large challenge to control the disease timely. This difference is significant for those cities
with largest number of infections by March 12 (Figure 8), such as Wuhan and other cities in
Hubei province.

scenarios (Data of Wuhan is 40613, 27021, and 98486 that is not shown properly in this figure)

To understand the specific attributes of epidemic dynamics under different scenarios, we
investigated the temporal changes of daily new infections across all cities in mainland China. In
Figure 9, we show the results in Wuhan, Hubei province excluding Wuhan, other provinces, and
four first-tier cities. Compared with the scenario 1 where current trend is maintained, the daily
new infections in scenario 2 reduces quickly in the second half of February. In scenario 3 where
transmissibility rebounds after the public holiday in all cities, the peak of new infections will
postpone ten days and the magnitude will be twice of that in scenarios 1 and 2. Our simulation
suggests that strict quarantine of inner- and inter-city population movement during February
would have a significant effect on the suppression of virus spreading.

Figure 9. Temporal change of daily new infections in Wuhan, Hubei province excluding Wuhan,
other provinces, and four first-tier cities based on the proposed model
Change of daily new infections number is an important indicator of effective intervention. The
date when the number of new daily infections reaches the peak (Figure 10. a-c, Supplementary
data Table 4) suggests that the exponential growing of disease will stop and the spreading would
be controlled gradually. Under current trend, our model estimated that the number of new
infections in 79.7% cities already reached the peak point before February 11 and in all other
cities, it will reach the peak point by February 21. With the control effort expanded, all cities will
have the peak point of new infections by February 14, one week earlier than current trend.
However, the peak point of new infections will be greatly delayed under scenario 3 that a few
cities in Hubei province will show the peak point of new infections by February 26.

The daily new infections decreasing to zero (Figure 10.d-f, Supplementary data Table 4) is the
signal of eliminating the coronavirus outbreak. Our results show that this successful day in cities
close to Wuhan is much later than other cities under all scenarios. Our prediction suggests
Wuhan cannot eliminate the disease by March 12 under all scenarios. For other cities, if the
current trend is maintained (scenario 1), 95.4% cities can eliminate the disease by the end of
February and all of them can succeed by March 12. With control efforts expanded (scenario 2),
all cities except Wuhan will completely control the disease by the end of February. However,
only 75.7% cities can completely win the battle against 2019-nCoV by the end of February if
person-to-person contacts increase due to work resuming (scenario 3). Nine cities in Hubei

province still have daily new infections on March 12, 2020, the last day in our prediction under
scenario 3.

1(a), scenario 2(b), and scenario 3(c); dates when no more daily new infections emerge under

4. Discussion
In this study, we modeled the updated epidemic trend of 2019-nCoV for each individual city in
mainland China and used the model to predict the future trend under three possible scenarios.
Our model accounts for 86% of the variation in the number of daily reported infections on
February 11 across cites in mainland China. With this model, we predict that all cities will show
the peak point of daily new infections by February 21, if the current trend is maintained. This
date can be advanced to February 14 with control efforts expanded or postponed to February 26
under pressure of work resuming. Cities in central and east of mainland China will face a
challenge to prevent the growing of disease transmission due to work resuming.
Compared with other recent modeling studies, our study has the following strength. First, the
unique characteristics of the novel coronavirus spreading were taken into account in our
proposed model. Considering that the new coronavirus originates from Wuhan and the majority
of the local infected patients outside Wuhan had Wuhan travel history before the Spring Festival,
we extended the SIR model to capture the transmission characteristics of the novel coronavirus
in mainland China. Second, a decay rate was introduced into the model for quantifying the
intervention implemented in each city. Third, our proposed spatially explicit model is able to

obtain fine scale prediction result. Different cities have different transmission rates due to their
own conditions (for instance, population density and human mobility characteristics). If only the
transmission rate in national scale is used to model the epidemics of different cities 10, the
prediction of epidemic trend of all major cities would be similar to Wuhan (see Figure 4 in Wu et
al., 2020).
Our predictions of three future scenarios, namely the current trend maintained, control efforts
expanded, person-to-person contacts increased due to work resuming, provide information for
decision makers to allocate resources for controlling the disease spread. Generally speaking,
densely populated cities and cities in central China will face severe pressure to control the
epidemic, since the number of infections keeps increasing in all three scenarios in the near future.
By comparing predictions of three scenarios, it is obvious that reducing the transmissibility is a
critical approach to reduce the daily new infections and controlling the magnitude of epidemics.
Fortunately, the latest number of confirmed diagnoses (Figure 1) and our prediction both show
the slowing down of new infections in these days, indicating current control measures
implemented by Chinese government are effective, including controlling traffic between Wuhan
and other regions, isolating suspected patients, canceling mass gatherings, and requiring people
to implement protective measures. However, once the Spring Festival travel rush returns as
scenario 3 (most provinces planned to resume work on February 9), it will inevitably cause
considerable growth in transmissibility and further re-increase of epidemics. In addition, current
insufficient supply of protective equipment may exacerbate this situation. Therefore, public
health interventions should be performed continuously to obtain the best results of epidemic
control. The following measures are recommended to implement continuously in the near future,
such as, postponing work resuming, arranging work-from-home, and instructing enterprises to
implement epidemic prevention measures. Essentially, all measures are for reducing population
mobility and person-to-person contact, and there is no panacea for all conditions, hence
interventions in different regions should be adapted according to local epidemics.
Our modeling work has several limitations. First, due to the limited prior knowledge for this
sudden 2019-nCoV outbreak, the infection rate and recovery rate in this study are regarded as the
same for different age groups, which may result in errors of predication for cities with different
age structures. Second, the model parameters were estimated using the reported confirmed cases
that may be lower than the actual number of infections, so parameter estimation may not
represent the real situation. Third, besides transmission between Wuhan and other cities, we do
not consider other inter-city transmissions. Although the Chinese government strictly controlled
the traffic between cities, the inter-city transmission may contribute to the epidemic dynamics in
future days, especially during days of work resuming.
