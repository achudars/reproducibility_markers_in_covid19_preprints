Abstract
Background
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, China, however, the
factors affecting the mortality remain unclear.
Methods
Thirty-two days of data that were shared by China National Health Commission and China Weather
Net were collected using standard forms. The difference in the mortality of confirmed and severe cases
before and after the use of “Fangcang, Huoshenshan, and Leishenshan” makeshift hospitals (MSHs)
was tested using Mann-Whitney U test. We also studied whether air temperature (AT) could affect the
above outcomes of COVID-19 cases by performing Spearman’s analysis.
Results
Eight days after the use of MSHs, the mortality of confirmed cases was significantly decreased both in
Wuhan (U = 1, P < 0.001) and Hubei (U = 0, P < 0.001), while in non-Hubei regions, as a contrast, the
mortality of confirmed cases remained unchanged (U = 40, P = 0.139). However, another eight days
later, changes in the mortality in non-Hubei regions also became significant (U = 73, P = 0.039).
Mortality of confirmed cases was found to be significantly correlated with AT both in Wuhan (r =
-0.441, P = 0.012) and Hubei (r = -0.440, P = 0.012).
Conclusions
Our findings indicated that both the use of MSHs and the rise of AT were beneficial to the survival of
COVID-19 cases.

Introduction
In early December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19, previously known as 2019-nCoV)
induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) broke out in Wuhan,
China.1

2

This newly discovered coronavirus had been confirmed to have human-to-human

transmissibility3 and has now spread across the country.4 However, the mortality caused by COVID-19
had been reported to be unbalanced in different regions.4 Briefly speaking, the mortality in Wuhan city
was generally higher than that in other cities, and the mortality in Hubei Province was generally higher
than that in other provinces. The specific reason needed to be investigated so that we can better contain
the epidemic.
Wuhan as the source of the epidemic in China, was under great pressure of treatment despite the
assistance received from all over the country. Many patients in Wuhan were unable to see a doctor,
could not be hospitalized previously. The medical resources consumed by rescuing such patients would
then further compress the treatment space of other patients. Such a vicious circle induced by
inappropriate resource allocation might be one of the reasons for the high mortality in Wuhan. In
addition, by reviewing the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Guangdong in
2003, we could find that the SARS epidemic gradually subsided with the warming of the weather, and
was basically controlled until the warm April and May. Therefore, we assume that different air
temperature (AT) in different regions might also contributed to the unbalanced mortality.
Up to February 5, 2020, the first three Fangcang, Huoshenshan, and Leishenshan makeshift hospitals
(MSHs) had been put into use in Wuhan.5 The Fangcang hospitals, which belong to field mobile
medical systems, are composed of a number of movable cabins. They have multiple functions such as
emergency treatment, surgical disposal, clinical examination and so on. In case of any public health
emergency, the cabins can rush to the scene as soon as possible, and then in situ expand to a class II
hospital.6 In the present study, we aim to research whether these MSHs could reduce the mortality
induced by COVID-19. In addition, we also studied whether the AT could improve the survival of
COVID-19 cases.
Methods
Data collection and mortality calculation
From January 21 to February 21, the number of each day’s total cases confirmed by nucleic acid test,
severe cases and new deaths in Wuhan city, Hubei Province and non-Hubei regions (as a contrast so as
to reduce bias) were collected by two authors independently. All the above data were available on the
official

website

of

National

Health

Commission

of

the

people's

Republic

of

China

(http://www.nhc.gov.cn/). Growth rate of confirmed cases was calculated by dividing the new
confirmed cases by the total confirmed cases on the previous day. Each day’s mortality was calculated
by dividing the number of new deaths by the average number of confirmed cases on that day and the
previous day, and mortality of severe patients was calculated by the number of severe cases. Each day’s
AT were collected from China Weather Net (http://www.weather.com.cn/), and the AT of Hubei
Province was represented by the average AT of its cities.
Statistical analysis
The data of each region was divided into group A (after the hospitals were built) and group B (before
the hospitals were built). Since the sample size was small (less than 50), the normality of data was
determined using Shapiro–Wilk test, and P value > 0.05 was considered as normally distributed.7 If the

outcomes of two groups were both normally distributed, Student’s t test would be performed to
compare the difference between groups, and if the outcomes of at least one group was skewed
distribution, Mann-Whitney U test would be performed instead.8 We compared data of eight days,
sixteen days after the use of MSHs, respectively, with the data of sixteen days before the use of MSHs.
As for the correlation analysis, if the AT and the corresponding outcome were both normally distributed,
Pearson correlation analysis would be performed to investigate their correlation, otherwise, Spearman's
correlation analysis would be performed instead.9 SPSS 26.0 statistical software (IBM, New York,
USA) was used for statistical data processing, and GraphPad Prism 8.3 (GraphPad Software Inc., New
York, USA) was applied for plotting graphs. All tests were two-sided, and P value < 0.05 was
considered as significant.
Results
Mortality difference before and after the use of MSHs
Each day’s total confirmed cases, severe cases, new deaths and AT in different regions were
summarized in Table 1. As shown in Supplementary Table S1, for each outcome, at least one group
was skew distribution (P < 0.05), so Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare the difference
between groups. The results of eight days after the use of MSHs are shown in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The growth rate of confirmed cases was significantly decreased both in Wuhan (U = 27, P = 0.023) and
Hubei (U = 23, P = 0.012), but in non-Hubei regions, as a contrast, changes were also significant (U =
3, P < 0.001). The mortality of confirmed cases was significantly decreased both in Wuhan (U = 1, P <
0.001) and Hubei (U = 0, P < 0.001), while in non-Hubei regions, as a contrast, the mortality of
confirmed cases remained unchanged (U = 40, P = 0.139). Similarly, the mortality of severe cases was
significantly decreased in Hubei (U = 0, P < 0.001), while in non-Hubei regions, changes were not
significant (U = 33, P = 0.056).
The results of sixteen days after the use of MSHs were shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Results of
the growth rate of confirmed cases was basically consistent with that of the first eight days. Changes in
the mortality of confirmed cases were significant both in Wuhan (U = 1, P < 0.001) and Hubei (U = 0,
P < 0.001), but not like the results of the first eight days, changes in non-Hubei regions became
significant (U = 73, P = 0.038). Similarly, changes in the mortality of severe cases in Hubei were
significant (U = 0, P < 0.001), while in non-Hubei regions, changes also became significant (U = 66, P
= 0.019) this time.
Correlation between AT and outcomes
Except AT, all outcomes were skew distribution as shown in Supplementary Table S2. Therefore,
Spearman’s analysis was used to investigate their correlation among AT, and the results are shown in
Figure 3. For the growth rate of confirmed cases, it was not significantly related to AT no matter in
Wuhan (P = 0.730) or in Hubei (P = 0.062). But for the mortality of confirmed cases, its correlation
between AT was considered to be significant both in Wuhan (r = -0.441, P = 0.012) and Hubei (r =
-0.440, P = 0.012). The mortality of severe patients was also found to be significantly related to AT (r =
-0.421, P = 0.016). That is to say, if the AT rises 1 Celsius, the mortality of confirmed cases would
decrease 0.44% and the mortality of severe cases would decrease 0.42% on average.
Discussion
Our study found that after eight days of the use of MSHs, the mortality of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan

and Hubei was significantly decreased, while as a contrast, the change in non-Hubei regions was not
significant. The results preliminarily verified that these MSHs were beneficial to the survival of
COVID-19 cases. Later, after another eight days, the difference of mortality between the pre and post
use of MSHs was still significant in Wuhan and Hubei. However, not like the results of the first eight
days, the difference in non-Hubei regions became significant. The accumulation of treatment
experience of medical staff might be one of the reasons. In addition, according to the trade-off
hypothesis, a pathogen must multiply within the host to ensure transmission, while simultaneously
maintaining opportunities for transmission by avoiding host morbidity or death.10 That’s to say,
coronavirus with weak virulence was more likely to spread than that with strong virulence, which
might explain why the mortality in non-Hubei regions also decreased over time. However, empirical
evidence remains scarce and the truth needs to be investigated.
Our study also found that the rise of AT could significantly reduce the mortality of both common and
severe patients. According to a previous study, the first occurred deaths were mainly elderly people
who had comorbidities or surgery history before admission.11 Acute or chronic cold exposure, however,
could elicit bad effects on the respiratory system. Pulmonary mechanics would be compromised by
bronchoconstriction, airway congestion, secretions and decreased mucociliary clearance.12 It has also
been reported that cold exposure was coincided with hormonal changes, which might directly or
indirectly alter the immune system.13 The above factors would worsen the underlying medical
conditions of elderly people, and this might explain why a warm weather could reduce the mortality of
COVID-19 cases.
When it comes to the transmissibility of coronavirus, an in vitro study of transmissible gastroenteritis
virus and mouse hepatitis virus found that at higher AT, these coronaviruses survived for a shorter time
on the surfaces of stainless steel.14 A case-crossover analysis performed in Saudi Arabia also found that
primary Middle East Respiratory Syndrome were more likely to occur when condition was relatively
cold and dry.15 However, our results seemed to be inconsistent with these previous studies, as no
significant correlation between AT and the growth rate of confirmed cases in Wuhan was found. One of
the potential reasons was that the current AT was not high enough to exert a significant impact on
SARS-CoV-2. As the AT gets higher, subsequent studies are necessary to further validate our results.
But considering the new cases in tropical areas such as Singapore and Malaysia,16 it seems that the rise
of AT alone would not completely control this epidemic.
