Abstract
Introduction: The new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has caused distress and
repercussions in mental and physical health of individuals. Depression, anxiety and
worsening of sleep quality have been reported in several recent articles that surveyed
populations all over the globe. Our work meant to access, through a cross-sectional
study, these disorders in the Brazilian population, through the application of an online
questionnaire conducted on the second trimester of 2020.
Materials and Methods: We applied an online questionnaire, filled with questions
regarding social, economic, financial, educational and health status, as well as questions
from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), and from the Pittsburgh Sleep
Quality Index (PSQI).
Results: We collected 2,695 valid answers, from April 24th to May 31st, 2020. Age ranged
from 18 to 79 years, mean of 31.3. Women were 76.3%, men 23.7%. Symptoms of
Anxiety were found in 56.5%, of depression in 46.1%, and of bad sleep in 49.2%. Some

groups were more prone than others to one or more of those conditions, such as:
younger people, women, mestizos, Northeasterners, people with lesser years of
education, of lower income or whose income dropped significantly during the pandemic,
caregivers, students, sedentary or people practicing less physical activity, people who
followed more hours of news of COVID-19 and those less engaged in social and
instrumental activities.
Conclusion: anxiety, depression and bad sleep quality were significantly high in our
survey. Mental and sleep health is heterogeneously affected among individuals,
depending on social, economic, financial, educational and health status.

HIGHLIGHTS
-

An online survey (DEGAS-CoV) was conducted between April 30th and May
31st, 2020, with people living in Brazil, aged 18 or more. The study obtained
2,695 valid answers.

-

Rates of possible anxiety, possible depression and bad sleep quality were
56.5%, 46.1% and 49.2%, respectively. Rates are similar to another Brazilian
survey, with 45,161 participants, conducted in a similar time window.

-

Were more prone to mental and/or sleep conditions: younger participants,
women, mestizos, unemployed, students, people with less years of
education, people with lower income or with considerable drops of income
during the virus outbreak, caregivers, people who followed more news of
COVID-19, people less engaged in social and instrumental activities,
smokers, sedentary or those who practiced less physical activity, and people
who had symptoms suspected (confirmed or not) of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

-

Alcohol drinkers were slightly less likely to be possibly depressed. That
finding needs more clarification and may be due to confounders.

I. Introduction
Since December 2019, after the first report
in China (1), the new strain of Coronavirus,
prompter of a severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), designated as
COVID-19 by the World Health
Organization (2), has caused and
unprecedent, worldwide distress. Public
health measures are taken in many cases,
in an improvised fashion and within a blink
of an eye. In short intervals social
restrictions might be lifted, just be
implemented again later, due to the
erratic behavior of the virus and
oscillations in its transmission ratio and
also the evidence of secondary waves of
outbreak (3).
In an unsteady scenario of a deadly virus
outbreak, with massive misinformation,
added to the negative effect of social
restrictions, a rise in the prevalence of
mental disorders, such as depression and
anxiety, and disruptions in the normal,
physiological sleep are widely expect to
occur, with possible short- and long-term
consequences (4) (5). Previous studies
with data from past epidemic disorders,
such as in H1N1 influenza in 2009 (6),
SARS-CoV in 2002 and Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012 (7)
attest this fact.
One of the first to access mental and sleep
issues during the outbreak of COVID-19,
Huang and Zhao applied an online
questionnaire in 7,236 people living in
China, finding anxiety, depression and bad
sleep ratios of 35%, 20% and 18%,
respectively (8).

Several other studies conducted in
countries in all continents, showed an
increase of anxiety, depression, bad sleep
quality and/or stress as well (8) (9) (10)
(11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17). One study
from the United Kingdom (12) found that
higher levels of anxiety were associated
with more somatic symptoms, like
gastrointestinal disturbances or fatigue,
hence impoverishing life quality in such
cases. In Brazil, one study accessed mental
and sleep complaints during COVID-19 in
more than 45,000 people, surveyed
through an online form, and found 52.6%
of possible anxiety, 41.4% of possible
depression and 43.5% of bad sleepers (18).
This study intended to measure the overall
prevalence of anxiety and depression
symptoms, and bad sleep quality in the
second trimester of 2020, among people
living in Brazil, while moderate to severe
social restrictions were in place, and
compare rates between different groups,
according to social, financial, educational,
health and economic status.
II. Materials and Methods
II-A. Ethical aspects, inclusion criteria and
study design
We conducted a cross-sectional study,
called DEGAS-CoV, an acronym for
“Depression, General Anxiety and Sleep
Disorders during COVID-19”. The study
was based on an online survey from April
30th to May 31st 2020, when measures
establishing some degree of social
distancing – governmental advice or
imposition of restrictions like closure of
commerce, surveillance of circulation of

cars and pedestrians, and even lock-down
in more critical areas were in place, in
Brazil.
Before commencing, ethical approval was
granted by the São Leopoldo Mandic
Medical College Ethical Committee.
Dissemination and recruitment of
participants was made entirely online,
through snowball sampling (19), keeping in
mind the current scenario of social
restrictions. Participants were approached
by the researchers either directly, via
social medias (i.e., WhatsApp, Facebook
and others), or indirectly, when other
participants, in their turn, shared the link
to the survey with their acquaintances.
Participants were required to be at least 18
years old, and to be currently living in
Brazilian soil. No physical or mental
conditions/disorders were considered as
exclusion criteria. Both people who
already contracted or did not contract
COVID-19 were included as well.
Before answering, the participant was
presented with a consent form and was
required to check that he/she had read
and agreed with all conditions.

II-B. Questionnaires Applied
The online form was divided in three
questionnaires, and was created using
Google Forms (20).
The first questionnaire consisted of
interrogations
formulated
by
the
researchers, and meant to access
geographical, educational, financial, and

health status of participants, as well as
habitual behaviors, such as social activities
(SA) – phone or video calls/conferences
and in-person interactions with familiars,
friends or other people - and instrumental
activities
(IA)
–
care
of
offspring/parents/relatives, pet sitting,
preparing meals, cleaning the house and
other inhouse daily activities, shopping,
religious/spiritual worship - and time spent
watching or reading news. Lastly, patients
were required to answer two questions
regarding COVID-19. First, if they already
contracted COVID-19 and, if not, how
afraid they were of contracting – possible
answers were “already contracted”, “no or
little fear”, “moderate fear”, and “intense
fear of contracting”. Secondly, they were
asked to grade, in a Likert scale fashion,
from 1 to 5, how severely COVID-19 had
affected their lives, in general, being 1
“no/very low interference” and 5 “total
interference”.
The second questionnaire was composed
of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale - HAD (21), consisting of 14 multiplechoice questions, 7 for the evaluation of
possible depression and 7 for possible
anxiety. The Brazilian Portuguese
validated translation (22) was used. The
higher the frequency and/or intensity of
symptoms, the higher the punctuation. A
cut-off of 9 points for each symptom was
considered for tagging the responder as a
bearer of those conditions.
For the last questionnaire, researchers
used a modified version of Brazilian
validated translation (23) of the Pittsburgh
Sleep Quality Index - PSQI (24), what was

called mPSQI. This instrument is designed
for the triage of people with sleep of bad
quality, regardless of etiology. The PSQI
score is calculated by the sum of
components (subset of questions), each
receiving a determined weight. For most
authors, a cut-off score of 5 points is
adequate for the identification of bad
sleepers (25).
The original version of the PSQI consists of
10 questions, being the first 4 open
questions dealing with a free estimate of
time of going to bed and getting up, sleep
latency in minutes and effective hours of
sleep, and the last 6 questions of multiplechoice; the higher the frequency and/or
intensity of symptoms, the higher the
punctuation. In the original version, the
maximum score is 21 points (24).
For the mPSQI, we opted for suppression
of the first 4 and also of the 10th question,
leading to a maximum possible
punctuation of 15 points. For the first 4
questions, we felt that calculation and
estimation of time could offer some
difficulty to some responders, particularly
those with lesser education years, given
that no presential support could be
offered. Question 10 was not included
because, besides not being considered for
scoring, it required the participant to have
a partner or other roommate to attest
snoring, and given the unusual
circumstances, a considerate fraction of
people enrolled could not have an
informant. The cut-off commonly used
value of five points for the PSQI was
maintained for the mPSQI, as there was no

certainty of sensitivity/specificity by
adopting a lower cut-off for the mPSQI.

II.C - Data Analysis
Statistical Analysis was conducted in the
Statistical Package for Social Sciences
(SPSS) suite (26). Categorical variables
were compared by Chi-Square test, with
adopted significance level of 95%. For
contingency tables with more than 1
degree of freedom, a Post-Hoc analysis
was conducted, being the p value (⍺)
modified by Bonferroni correction (27), for
a contingency table of i lines and j columns,
⍺ = 0.05 / (i x j). Odd ratios were
calculated by univariate logistic regression.
When needed, correlation was made by
Spearman 2-tailed Correlation index (ρ),
since data was non-parametric.

III. Results
III-A. Exploratory analysis
The questionnaire received a total of 2,839
inputs. After exclusions, either due to
duplicity (last answer was validated) or to
incoherent responses, a total of 2,695
forms remained. Mean age was of 31.3
years of age; 2,052 (76.3%) were women
and 636 (23.7%) men; most auto-declared
themselves as whites, followed by
mestizos, blacks, Asians and indigenous.
Epidemiological data of participants are
further detailed in Table 1, ahead.

Depression and Bad Sleep Quality and
Statistical Analysis

private sectors or those who were retired
or received pension.
Rates of possible conditions were similar
among non-health workers and health
workers (regardless of dealing or not with
COVID-19 cases).

III-B1. Demographics
Prevalence of mental and sleep disorders
were higher in younger people, especially
in the first quartile (ages 18 to 22).
Meanwhile, the oldest quartile (ages 39 to
79) was statistically less anxious and
depressed than expected.
Anxiety and depression were significantly
higher in mestizos, and significantly lower
in whites. There was no significance in
differences of sleep quality among
ethnicities.
There were no statistical disparities of
mental or sleep issues when people who
lived alone were compared to people living
with more people during the pandemic.

Caregivers were significantly more prone
to mental and sleep disorders than noncaregivers, especially depression.
III-B3. Financial Status
Responders of families with lower monthly
incomes and/or whose income had
dropped during the pandemic were more
prone for those conditions. Also, those who
did not contribute to the family budget, or
were not the main contributors were also
more prone to possible anxiety and
depression.
Sleep quality did not vary significantly
among people with different family
income, drop in family budget or among
providers and non-providers.

III-B2. Education and Occupation
People with less years of education tended
to have more anxiety, depression and bad
sleep symptoms, while those who had
postgraduation degrees were significantly
suffering less from those conditions.
Unemployed
(regardless
of
being
discharged more or less recently) and
students had a higher prevalence of
anxiety, depression and bad sleep quality
than freelancers, workers of public or

III-B4. Physical Conditions, Comorbidities,
Habits and Behaviors
Weight did not seem to interfere in rates of
disorders. Having or not comorbidities and
being or not a smoker also did not interfere
with anxiety and depression rates. People
with no comorbidities were less prone to
be bad sleepers than otherwise. Rates of
bad sleep quality in smokers up to 10
cigarettes per day (65.6%) and in smokers
of more than 10 cigarettes per day (73.3%)

were significantly higher than in nonsmokers (47.8%).
Rates of anxiety and bad sleep did not vary
greatly among those who did not drink and
alcohol consumers. The rate of depression
was higher than expected in non-drinkers
(49.6%), and lower than expected in those
drinking up to twice a week and did not
consume in the evening (41.6%). In
general, alcohol drinkers were 27% less
likely to be diagnosed with depression, in
our sample. Nocturnal drinking did not play
a statistically significant difference in rates.
Participants who did not had symptoms of
COVID-19, by the time of the survey, were
less likely to be anxious, depressed or bad
sleepers than those with symptoms,
regardless of confirmation of infection by
the virus.
People who watched and/or read more
than 3 hours per day of news were 71% (CI
1.12-2.59) more likely to be in the anxious
group, and 61% (CI 1.07-2.42) more likely
to be in the bad sleepers’ group, when
compared to those who did not follow
news. They were also 39% more likely to be
in the depressed group, although in this
case, the CI of 0.92-2.09 did not allow a
concrete confirmation of this trend.
The three disturbances had the highest
ratios in those who were exercising much
less than before the pandemic and in those
who were sedentary by the time of the
collection of data, regardless of being
active or not before the pandemics. For
those who were active, responders that
preferred exercising in the morning had the

lowest ratios of anxiety, depression and
bad sleep, although only depression
reached statistical significance.
Lastly, patients were asked about the time
spent in social activities (SA), like phoning
or video-calling friends and relatives,
engaging in social interactions and
relationships, and in instrumental activities
(IA), such as care of offspring, parents or
other relatives, pet sitting, cleaning the
house, religious activities. People who
increased time spent both in SA and IA
were significantly less prone to anxiety,
depression and bad sleep. People who
spent less time in SA than before COVID-19
were 28%, 62% and 66% more likely to be
in the anxiety, depression and bad sleep
groups, respectively, while those who
spent less time in IA than before the
infection were 67%, 63% and 75% more
likely to be in the anxiety, depression and
bad sleep groups, respectively.
III-B5. Correlations
Table 4 shows there was a moderate
correlation between Anxiety Score – HAD
(A) and Depression Score – HAD (D), and
between Global mPSQI score and both HAD
(A) and HAD (D). Grading of how much
COVID-19 had affected the responder’s life
(in a Likert scale, from 1 to 5) correlated
moderately with both HAD (A) and HAD (D),
but weakly with mPSQI. Graph 1 depicts
the cumulative dispersion of grading versus
HAD (A), HAD (D) and mPSQI. Fear of
contracting COVID-19 also displayed a
weak correlation with other variables.

IV. Discussion
In this survey, we found global rates of
56.5% for possible anxiety, 46.1% for
possible depression and 49.2% for bad
sleep quality.
A meta-analysis conducted by Salari et. al
(28) found, among 17 studies conducted in
2020, anxiety rates varying between 6.33%
and 50.9% (mean of 32.9% for Asian and
23.8% for European studies) and
depression rates from 17.17% to 53.5%
(mean of 35.3% for Asian and 32.4% for
European studies). Assessment for those
conditions was heterogeneous. The most
frequent used instruments were the DASS21 - Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale
(29), the GAD-7 – Generalized Anxiety
Disorder 7-item (30), and the PHQ-9 –
Patient Health Questionnaire (31).
Rates of anxiety and depression in our
survey were higher than the averages of
the
aforementioned
meta-analysis,
however some factors must be bore in
mind: first, none of those studies used the
HAD scale for anxiety and depression,
adopted in this study. Secondly, and in
particular regarding anxiety rate, studies
that used the DASS-21 scale also assessed
stress levels. Some of the stress questions
are of resemblance with anxiety questions
of the HAD scale - for instance: “I found it
hard to wind down” is accounted for stress
in DASS-21, and “I feel tense or 'wound up’“
is accounted for anxiety in HAD. This raises
a possibility that, in studies based on the
DASS-21, anxiety rates were lower due to a
split caused by the stress group. Thirdly,
none of those studies included were from

Latin-American
countries.
Another
Brazilian study (32), with 45,161
participants, intended to evaluate
sadness/depression, anxiety/nervousness
and sleep problems. Data was collected
online between April 24th and May 24th,
2020, a time window very much similar to
ours. Although using a much simpler form,
consisting of a few questions – i.e., not
using
standardized,
validated
questionnaires, this survey found rates of
52.6% of anxiety/nervousness, 43.5% of
sadness/depression and 43.5% of an onset
of sleep issues, percentages that resemble
ours.
Studies conducted out of a pandemic
scenario shows lower rates of the same
disturbances. A Brazilian, multicenter
survey of 2014 (33), was conducted with
data from 1,857 participants who were
assessed when using primary healthcare,
from four Brazilian cities. This study also
used the HAD scale as instrument to access
mental disorders. Anxiety rates oscillated
from 35.4% to 43%, and depression rates
ranged between 21.4% and 31%. In our
survey, anxiety and depression rates (see
Tables 2a-d) are higher. Another study (34)
estimated, by analysis of 12,000 people
that responded to the 2011 National
Health and Wellness Survey in Brazil, the
prevalence of Major Depression to be
10.2%, again much lower than what we
found.
Our data shows that youngers, females,
students, people with lower familiar
monthly income or a significant drop of
income during the epidemic, unemployed,
people following more hours per day of

news concerning COVID-19, people
engaging less in exercising and in social and
instrumental activities were groups
associated with greater odds of being
possibly anxious, depressed and/or bad
sleeper. Younger age and more time
following news were also associated with
higher levels of mental and sleep issues in
a Chinese survey of 7,236 volunteers,
conducted by Huang and Zhao (8),
corroborating our findings for these
groups.
Mestizos were more likely to be possibly
depressed. Although rates of one or both
disturbances were also higher in blacks and
native Brazilians (indigenous), this did not
reach statistical significance, possibly due
to low sampling. The disproportional high
rate of whites (74.1%) and low rates of
mestizos (19.4%), blacks (4.4%) and other
ethnicities responding (latest Brazilian
census shows 47.5% of auto-declared
whites, 43.2% of mestizos and 7.5% of
blacks (35)) are clear evidence of the social
and economic inequality in our local reality
(36).
BMI did not influence rates of anxiety,
depression and bad sleep, while the
absence of comorbidities was a protective
factor for better sleep quality, but not for
anxiety and depression. Sedentary people
(regardless of being or not active before
the pandemic) were more prone all those
conditions, and those who already
practiced before and kept practicing more
than 3 times a week showed the least
tendency
to
mental
and
sleep
disturbances, showing that exercising
played a role in preventing worsening of

mental and sleep status in our sample.
Also, of note, people that preferred to
exercise early were less depressed. That
could be due a bidirectional relationship, as
depression is commonly linked with
morning fatigue and unwillingness to
engage in energetic activities (37).
Curiously enough, those who did not
consume alcohol had a significant higher
rate of depression than alcohol consumers.
We do not propose a logical explanation,
but researchers should pay attention to
forthcoming articles, to see if this pattern
replicates, or if it could be merely
coincidental. Conversely, despite not
reaching significant differences, but
towards what is traditionally more
expected, alcohol consumers, especially
those with nocturnal consumption, had
higher rates of anxiety and bad sleep
quality. Smokers had greater incidence of
bad sleepy quality, especially those who
smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day.
This is expected, as smoking is known to be
disruptive to good sleep (38).
Also relevant is the observation that, in
most of the similar studies we found so far,
where snowball recruiting was performed therefore sampling was not randomized
but rather by convenience, younger adults
(up to the fourth decade of life) and
females were the most solicitous. Female
participation was majoritarian in most
studies conducted worldwide, with
encountered proportions of 51% (12)
53.8% (17), 54.6% (8), 64.7% (15), 66% (10),
76.1% (16), 76.3% (our data) and 81.1% (9).
Females were the minority in two studies,
with proportions of 41.6% (11) and 45.5%

(13). Mean ages, for papers that provided
this asset, were of 31.7 (our data), 33 (11),
and 35.3 (8). Other papers provided age
ranges: one study disclosed that 56.5% of
participants were from 18 to 25 years-old
(9), in another 77% of participants were
from 18 to 40 years-old (10), and yet in
other 47.3% were aged between 18-35
years, and an additional 33.8% were from
36 to 45 years-old (17). While youth is
naturally expected to outweigh middle
agers and seniors, due to easiness of
interaction with digital technology, the
more participation of females could be
multifactorial.
Apart from snowball sampling, there were
other limitations. By lowering by 7 points
the maximum punctuation possible of the
PSQI, the authors acknowledge that
sensitivity might have been diminished for
detection of bad sleepers, but a necessary
cost, given the facts already explained in
methodology. Nonetheless, we consider
that the specificity of the diagnosis of bad
sleep remained unharmed, and the high
proportion of bad sleepers, with the
mPSQI, is by itself a fact worthy of
consideration.
V. Conclusion
The DEGAS-CoV study, in accordance to
many published papers so far, shows high
rates of anxiety (56.5%), depression
(46.1%) and bad sleep quality (49.2%)
during COVID-19. These rates reflect the
time of data collection, in the second
trimester of 2020, in the Brazilian
population. Some groups were more prone
to those disturbances, such as: younger

people, women, mestizos, people with
lesser years of education, of lower income
or whose income dropped significantly
during the pandemic, unemployed,
caregivers, people who followed more
hours of news of COVID-19, sedentary or
those who engaged less in physical activity,
and those less engaged in social and
instrumental activities. More studies,
especially longitudinal, could provide more
information on if the prevalence of mental
and sleep issues remains constant during
the pandemic crisis or suffer changes
related to different aspects, like adaptation
to the situation, social restriction
relaxation and improved treatments or
vaccines. We also intend to conduct further
sub-analyses of our data, in search of more
significant statistical findings.
