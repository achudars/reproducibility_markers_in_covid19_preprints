•

Patients with COVID-19 thrombosis have immune complexes that activate platelets through
FcγRIIA signalling

•

Patients with COVID-19 thrombosis demonstrate increased VWF antigen and activity that
is not related to severe ADAMTS13 reduction

Abstract
Thrombosis is a prominent feature of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and often occurs in patients
who are critically ill; however, the mechanism is unclear. This COVID-19 associated coagulopathy
(CAC) shares features with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), including mild thrombocytopenia
and thrombosis. We thus tested 10 CAC patients for anti-PF4/heparin antibodies and functional platelet
activation. HIT was excluded in all samples based on anti-PF4/heparin antibody and serotonin release
assay results. Of note, 6 CAC patients demonstrated platelet activation by the serotonin release assay that
was inhibited by FcγRIIA receptor blockade, confirming an IgG-specific immune complex (IC)-mediated
reaction. Platelet activation was independent of heparin, but inhibitable by both therapeutic and high dose
heparin. All 6 samples were positive for IgG-specific antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain
(RBD) or the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These samples were additionally characterized by
significant endothelial activation, shown by increased von Willebrand factor antigen and activity.
ADAMTS13 activity was not severely reduced, and ADAMTS13 inhibitors were not present, ruling out
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Our study thus identifies platelet-activating ICs as a mechanism
that contributes to CAC thrombosis.
Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly transmissible viral infection caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has resulted in a global pandemic.1,2 Critically ill
patients with COVID-19 can have prominent coagulation abnormalities, including mild thrombocytopenia
and diffuse arterial and venous thrombosis.3-6 While the mechanism of COVID-19 associated
coagulopathy (CAC) is unclear, this clinical presentation shares many features of heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia (HIT), namely thrombocytopenia and thrombosis during critical illness.7
HIT is a prothrombotic disorder that typically presents as thrombocytopenia related to heparin treatment
and is associated with a high risk of thrombosis. HIT is caused by IgG-specific antibodies targeting
platelet-factor 4 (PF4) that form immune complexes (IC) and cause platelet activation through the
FcγRIIA receptor.8,9 Recent reports have speculated that ICs also contribute to the pathobiology of severe

COVID-19.10 In this report, we describe platelet-activating ICs in CAC patients. These ICs are not formed
from IgG-specific anti-PF4/heparin antibodies and occur in combination with significant endothelial cell
activation. Platelet-activating ICs may thus be an important mechanism of CAC thrombosis.
Study Design and Methods
Blood samples from 10 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were referred to the McMaster Platelet
Immunology Laboratory (MPIL) for HIT testing. Demographic data were obtained including sex, platelet
nadir, heparin use, thrombotic event, admission diagnosis, and outcome. Control samples included 8
convalescent COVID-19 positive patients; 5 pre-pandemic HIT positive samples (HIT); and 7 prepandemic healthy controls (HC).
Testing for anti-PF4/heparin antibodies was done using an anti-PF4/heparin enzymatic immunoassay
(EIA, LIFECODES PF4 enhanced assay, Immucor GTI Diagnostics, Waukesha, Wisconsin) for IgG,
IgM, and IgA PF4-heparin antibodies. If positive, an in-house, IgG-specific anti-PF4/heparin EIA was
performed.11 All samples were then tested for functional platelet activation in the serotonin release assay
(SRA) with heparin (0.1, 0.3, and 100 U/mL) as previously described. An anti-human CD32 antibody
(IV.3) was added to the SRA to confirm FcγRIIA engagement.12
Testing for IgG-, IgA- and IgM specific antibodies against the RBD and spike protein of SARS-CoV-2
virus was done using our in-house ELISA.13
As a measure of endothelial activation, VWF antigen levels were assessed by the HemosIL von
Willebrand Factor antigen automated chemiluminescent immunoassay (Instrumentation Laboratory,
Bedford, MA). VWF activity was measured using the Innovance VWF Ac Assay (OPHL03, Siemens,
Marburg, Germany). ADAMTS13 metalloproteinase activity and anti-ADAMTS13 antibody were tested
for all patients, as previously described, to determine whether VWF changes were related to ADAMTS13
activity.14 Data represent mean ± SEM and are analyzed by Student t test. Results are considered
significant at P < 0.05.
This study was approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board.
Results and Discussion
Blood samples were referred to the MPIL for HIT testing from 10 CAC patients (Supplementary Table 1).
All patients developed thrombocytopenia and had been exposed to unfractionated heparin. All 5 patients
for whom full clinical data were available had thrombosis; thrombosis data were unavailable for the
remaining 5 patients. Initial testing for IgG, IgA, and IgM anti-PF4 antibodies was negative in 5 CAC
samples (OD405nm < 0.4), thus excluding HIT (Supplementary Table 2). IgG-specific anti-PF4 antibodies

were then tested in the 5 positive CAC samples; 2 were negative (OD405nm < 0.45), and 3 were weakly
positive (OD405nm range 0.495-0.931). Of these weakly positive samples, the positive predictive value of
HIT is < 1.4% (Supplementary Table 2).15 All 10 CAC samples were then tested in the SRA where none
demonstrated heparin-dependent platelet activation (Figure 1A). This combination of anti-PF4/heparin
EIA results with heparin-independent platelet activation excludes HIT in all samples.12
6 CAC samples demonstrated significant platelet activation in the absence of heparin (Figure 1A). Platelet
activation was inhibited with all heparin concentrations (0.1, 0.3 U and 100 U/mL), as opposed to the
classic, heparin-dependent activation seen in HIT patients with therapeutic heparin levels (Figure 1A and
1B). Addition of IV.3 (FcγRIIA inhibitor) inhibited platelet activation, confirming an IgG-specific ICmediated reaction (Figure 1A and 1B). Since certain virus-targeting, IgG-specific antibodies are known to
form ICs, we tested for COVID-19 antibodies using our anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA.13 All 6 CAC samples
contained IgG-specific antibodies against RBD, spike, or both proteins (Figure 1C), while none of the
controls had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Convalescent plasma from non-critically ill COVID-19
patients did not activate platelets in the SRA, despite having high titres of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies,
indicating that antibodies alone are insufficient for platelet activation (data not shown). A subset of CAC
patient sera thus contain ICs that mediate platelet activation via FcγRIIA signalling.
ICs are known to trigger endothelial cell activation in diseases such as HIT and lupus vasculitis with
subsequent VWF release.16,17 We therefore tested VWF antigen, which was markedly elevated in CAC
samples (range, 2.1-10.1 U/mL; mean = 5.9 U/mL; normal range, 0.5-1.5 U/mL) compared with healthy
controls (range 0.9-1.5 U/mL; mean = 1.2 U/mL) (Figure 2A). Ristocetin activity, as a marker of VWF
activity, was also significantly increased (range, 2.2-8.52 U/mL; mean 4.6 U/mL; normal range 0.8-1.8
U/mL) compared to healthy controls (range, 0.53-1.67 U/mL, mean = 1.18 U/mL) (Figure 2B). These
data confirm significant endothelial cell activation in CAC samples containing platelet-activating ICs.
To determine if this VWF increase was related to ADAMTS13 metalloproteinase function, we tested for
ADAMTS13 activity and the presence of anti-ADAMTS13 antibody. ADAMTS13 activity was
moderately reduced (< 40%) in all CAC samples but only severely deficient (< 10%) in 1 (Figure 2C).
Only 1 sample contained anti-ADAMTS13 antibody, which did not correspond to severe ADAMTS13
deficiency (Figure 2D). The elevated VWF is therefore not secondary to severe ADAMTS13 reduction.
We have described our findings in CAC samples obtained from COVID-19 patients with a clinical
suspicion for HIT. Similar to HIT, certain patient samples contain ICs capable of mediating platelet
activation. However, in contrast to HIT, CAC ICs are not formed of anti-PF4/heparin antibodies and are
capable of platelet activation in the absence of heparin. The lack of anti-PF4/heparin antibodies and

presence of heparin-independent SRA activation strongly rules out HIT. Furthermore, these plateletactivating ICs are inhibited by FcγRIIA blockade and heparin, including therapeutic (0.1 and 0.3 U/mL)
and high (100 U/mL) doses. This is an important observation that highlights a novel mechanism for CAC
ICs in promoting thrombosis.
We also confirm that endothelial cell activation contributes to coagulopathy, as previously shown.18 We
demonstrate that this is not secondary to severe ADAMTS13 activity reduction (<10 %) or the presence
of anti-ADAMTS13 antibody, as described in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). This pattern
is more consistent with a secondary thrombotic microangiopathy and is likely compounded by the
presence of platelet-activating ICs.19,20
A limitation of this study is the inability to characterize the specificity of these platelet-activating ICs. It is
possible that the ICs are composed of COVID-19 virus-antibody complexes, as seen with H1N1 viral
infection.21 This is further supported by inhibition with therapeutic heparin, since heparin binds the
SARS-CoV-2 RBD to cause a conformational change with altered binding specificity, potentially
disrupting the ICs and inhibiting platelet activation.22 Regardless, the data presented here clearly outline
the characteristics of these ICs and differentiate them from other severe coagulation disorders, including
HIT and TTP.
We thus propose a model whereby certain severe CAC patients feature a novel IC-mediated thrombotic
microangiopathy that is characterized by significant platelet and endothelial cell activation. These ICs can
produce a highly prothrombotic state resembling HIT but with unique platelet activating properties.

Figure Legends
Figure 1: CAC patients with COVID-19 antibodies contain ICs that are capable of activating
platelets in the SRA in a manner that is unique from HIT ICs. (A) CAC (n = 10) patient sera
compared to (B) HIT patient (n = 5) sera, serving as a control, in the SRA. 14C-serotonin release was
measured in the presence of increasing heparin doses or with addition of IV.3 (FcγRIIA inhibitor). 14Cserotonin release >20% is positive in the SRA (horizontal dashed line). Most CAC patient sera (n = 6,
solid line) demonstrate heparin-independent platelet activation, as opposed to classic HIT controls.
Platelet activation was inhibited with IV.3 in both groups. (C) IgG, IgA, and IgM COVID-19

antibodies in platelet-activating CAC patient sera (n = 6). Antibodies were measured in the
SARS-CoV-2 ELISA and include RBD and spike protein specificity. Values are shown as a ratio
of observed optical density to the determined assay cut-off optical density. Values above 1 ratio
are considered positive in the SARS-CoV-2 ELISA.
Figure 2: CAC samples with platelet-activating ICs show evidence of significant endothelial
activation. (A) VWF antigen and (B) VWF activity are significantly elevated in CAC compared to
healthy controls. (C) ADAMTS13 activity is moderately reduced (10-40%) in CAC as compared to
healthy controls without an associated increase in (D) anti-ADAMTS13 antibody. One CAC sample was
positive for presence of an anti-ADAMTS13 antibody, but this sample did not correspond to a severe
reduction in ADAMTS13 activity. Therefore, none of the CAC samples meet criteria for TTP and are
more in keeping with enhanced endothelial activation secondary to a secondary thrombotic
microangiopathy. Data represent 6 CAC samples that demonstrated platelet-activating properties in the
SRA. **P < 0.01, 2-tailed, unpaired Student t-test.
