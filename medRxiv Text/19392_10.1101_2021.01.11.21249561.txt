Abstract

31

The ongoing coronavirus pandemic reached Mexico in late February 2020. Since then Mexico

32

has observed a sustained elevation in the number of COVID-19 deaths. Mexico’s delayed

33

response to the COVID-19 pandemic until late March 2020 hastened the spread of the virus in

34

the following months. However, the government followed a phased reopening of the country in

35

June 2020 despite sustained virus transmission. In order to analyze the dynamics of the COVID-

36

19 pandemic in Mexico, we systematically generate and compare the 30-day ahead forecasts of

37

national mortality trends using various growth models in near real-time and compare forecasting

38

performance with those derived using the COVID-19 model developed by the Institute for

39

Health Metrics and Evaluation. We also estimate and compare reproduction numbers for SARS-

40

CoV-2 based on methods that rely on both the genomic data as well as case incidence data to

41

gauge the transmission potential of the virus. Moreover, we perform a spatial analysis of the

42

COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico by analyzing the shapes of COVID-19 growth rate curves at the

43

state level, using techniques from functional data analysis. The early estimate of reproduction

44

number indicates sustained disease transmission in the country with R~1.3. However, the

45

estimate of R as of September 27, 2020 is ~0.91 indicating a slowing down of the epidemic. The

46

spatial analysis divides the Mexican states into four groups or clusters based on the growth rate

47

curves, each with its distinct epidemic trajectory. Moreover, the sequential forecasts from the

48

GLM and Richards model also indicate a sustained downward trend in the number of deaths for

49

Mexico and Mexico City compared to the sub-epidemic and IHME model that outperformed the

50

others and predict a more stable trajectory of COVID-19 deaths for the last three forecast

51

periods.

Author summary

54

Mexico has been confronting the COVID-19 epidemic since late February under a fragile health

55

care system and economic recession. The country delayed the implementation of social

56

distancing interventions resulting in continued virus transmission in the country and reopened its

57

economy in June 2020. In order to investigate the unfolding of the COVID-19 epidemic in

58

Mexico and Mexico City the authors utilize the mortality data to generate and compare thirteen

59

sequentially generated short-term forecasts using phenomenological growth models. Moreover,

60

the reproduction number is estimated from genomic and time series data to determine the

61

transmission potential of the epidemic, and spatial analysis using case incidence data is

62

conducted to identify the characteristic growth patterns of the epidemic in different Mexican

63

states including rapid increase in the growth rate followed by a rapid decline and slow growth

64

rate followed by a rapid rise and a rapid decline. The best performing models indicate a more

65

sustained transmission of the pandemic in Mexico. The forecasts generated from the GLM and

66

Richards growth model indicate towards a sustained decline in the number of deaths whereas the

67

sub-epidemic model and IHME model point towards a stable epidemic trajectory for forecasting

68

periods as of August 23, 2020.

Introduction

78

The ongoing COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic is a global challenge that calls for

79

scientists, health professionals and policy makers to collaboratively address the challenges posed

80

by this deadly infectious disease. The causative SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory

81

syndrome virus 2) is highly transmissible via respiratory droplets and aerosols and presents a

82

clinical spectrum that ranges from asymptomatic individuals to conditions that require the use of

83

mechanical ventilation to multiorgan failure and septic shock leading to death [1]. The ongoing

84

pandemic has not only exerted significant morbidity but also excruciating mortality burden with

85

more than 79.2 million cases and 1.7 million deaths reported worldwide as of December 29,

86

2020 [2]. Approximately 27 countries globally including 9 countries in the Americas have

87

reported more than 10,000 deaths attributable to SARS-CoV-2 as of December 29, 2020 despite

88

the implementation of social distancing policies to limit the death toll. In comparison, a total of

89

774 deaths were reported during the 2003 SARS multi-country epidemic and 858 deaths were

90

reported during the 2012 MERS epidemic in Saudi Arabia [3-5].

91
92

While effective vaccines against the novel coronavirus have begun to roll out, many scientific

93

uncertainties exist that will dictate how vaccination campaigns will affect the course of the

94

pandemic. For instance, it is still unclear if the vaccine will prevent the transmission of SARS-

95

CoV-2 or just protect against more severe disease outcomes and death [6, 7]. In these

96

circumstances epidemiological and mathematical models can help quantify the effects of non-

97

pharmaceutical interventions including facemask wearing and physical distancing to contain the

4

98

COVID-19 pandemic [8]. However, recent studies have indicated that population density,

99

poverty, over-crowding and inappropriate work place conditions hinder the social distancing

100

interventions, propagating the unmitigated spread of the virus, especially in developing countries

101

[9, 10]. Moreover, the differential mortality burden is also influenced by the disparate disease

102

burden driven by the socioeconomic gradients with the poorest areas showing highest

103

preventable mortality rates [11]. In Mexico, a highly populated country [12] with ~42% of the

104

population living in poverty (defined as the state if a person or group of people lack a specified

105

amount of money or material possessions) [13] and ~60% of the population working informally

106

(jobs and workers are not protected or regulated by the state) [14], the pandemic has already

107

exerted some of the highest COVID-19 mortality levels [15]. Mexico ranks fourth in the world in

108

terms of the number of COVID-19 deaths, approximating a 9.8% case fatality rate (probability of

109

dying for a person who has tested positive for the virus and is one of the most important features

110

of the COVID-19), including the highest number of health worker deaths (~2000 deaths)

111

reported in any country [16-18]. Mexico also remains one of the countries with the lowest

112

number of tests conducted for COVID-19 [19].

113
114

Mexico is fighting the COVID-19 pandemic under three phases of COVID-19 contingency

115

identified by the Ministry of Health: Viral importation, community transmission and epidemic

116

[20]. The COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico was likely seeded by imported COVID-19 cases

117

reported on February 28, 2020 [21, 22]. As the virus spread across the nation in phase one of the

118

pandemic, some universities switched to virtual classes, and some festivals and sporting events

119

were postponed [23]. However, the government initially downplayed the impact of the virus and

120

did not enforce strict social distancing measures. This led to large gatherings at some social

5

121

events such as concerts, festivals and women’s soccer championship despite the sustained

122

disease transmission in the country, with the early reproduction number estimated between ~2.9-

123

4.9 for the first 10 days of the epidemic [24, 25]. Despite the ongoing viral transmission,

124

pandemic was generally under-estimated in Mexico [26].

125
126

Mexico entered phase 2 (community transmission) of the pandemic on March 24, 2020 as the

127

virus started to generate local clusters of the disease [27, 28]. This was followed by closure of

128

public and entertainment places along with suspension of gatherings of more than 50 people as

129

late as March 25, 2020 [29]. Moreover, a national emergency declaration was issued on March

130

30, 2020, halting the majority of activities around the country with the aim to mitigate the spread

131

of the virus [30]. However, the virus continued to spread across the country, ravaging through

132

the poor and rural communities, resulting in the delayed implementation of stay-at-home orders

133

by the government on April 12, 2020 [31]. These preventive orders were met with mixed

134

reactions from people belonging to different socio-economic sectors of the community [32].

135

Moreover, restrictions on transportation to and from the regions most affected by COVID-19

136

were not implemented until April 16, 2020 as the virus continued to spread [33]. Shortly after, on

137

April 21, 2020, Mexico announced phase 3 of the contingency (epidemic phase) with wide-

138

spread community transmission [34].

139
140

With lockdowns and other restrictions in place, Mexican officials shared model output [35]

141

predicting that COVID-19 case counts would peak in early May and that the epidemic was

142

expected to end before July of 2020 [36]. Despite notorious disagreement between surveillance

143

data and government forecasts, these model predictions continued to be cited by official and

144

independent sources [37, 38]. The extent to which these overly optimistic predictions skewed the

145

plans and budgets of private and public institutions remains unknown. Under the official

146

narrative that the pandemic would soon be over, Mexico planned a gradual phased re-opening of

147

its economy in early June 2020, as the “new normal” phase [30].

148
149

In Mexico, reopening of the economic activities started on June 1 under a four color traffic light

150

monitoring system to alert the residents of the epidemiological risks based on the level of

151

severity of the pandemic in each state on a weekly basis [39, 40]. As of December 29, 2020

152

Mexico exhibits high estimates of cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths; 1,401,529 and

153

123,845 respectively [15]. Given the high transmission potential of the virus and limited

154

application of tests in the country, testing only 24.54 people for every 1000 people (as of

155

December 28, 2020) [19], estimates of the effective reproduction number from the case data and

156

near real-time epidemic projections using mortality data could prove to be highly beneficial to

157

understand the epidemic trajectory. It may also be useful to assess the effect of intervention

158

strategies such as the stay-at-home orders and mobility patterns on the trajectory of the epidemic

159

curve along with the spatiotemporal dynamics of the virus.

160
161

In order to investigate the transmission dynamics of the unfolding COVID-19 epidemic in

162

Mexico, we analyze the case data by date of symptoms onset and the death data by date of

163

reporting using mathematical models that are useful to characterize the empirical patterns of

164

epidemic [41, 42]. We also examine the mobility trends and their relationship with the epidemic

165

curve for death along with estimating the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 to

166

understand the transmission dynamics during the course of the pandemic in Mexico. Moreover,

167

we employ statistical methods from functional data analysis to study the shapes of the COVID-

168

19 growth rate curves at the state level. This helps us characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics

169

of the pandemic based on the shape features of these curves. Lastly, twitter data showing the

170

frequency of tweets indicating stay-at-home-order is analyzed in relation to COVID-19 cases

171

counts at the national level.

Methods

174

Data

175

Five sources of data are analyzed in this manuscript. A brief description of the datasets and their

176

sources are described below.

177

(i)

IHME data for short term forecasts Apple mobility trends data

178

We utilized the openly published IHME smoothed trend in daily and cumulative COVID-19

179

reported deaths for (i) Mexico (country) and (ii) Mexico City (capital of Mexico) as of October

180

9, 2020 to generate the forecasts [43]. IHME smoothed data estimates were utilized as they were

181

corrected for the irregularities in the daily death data reporting, by averaging model results over

182

the last seven days. As this was our source of data for prediction modeling, it was chosen for its

183

regular updates. The statistical procedure of spline regressions obtained from MR-BRT (“meta-

184

regression—Bayesian, regularized, trimmed”) smooths the trend in COVID-19 reported deaths

185

as described in ref [44]. This data are publicly available from the IHME COVID-19 estimates

186

downloads page [43]. For this analysis, deaths as reported by the IHME model (current

187

projection scenario as described ahead) on November 11, 2020 are used as a proxy for actual

188

reported deaths attributed to COVID-19.

189

190

Mobility data for Mexico published publicly by Apple’s mobility trends reports was retrieved as

191

of December 5, 2020 [45]. This aggregated and anonymized data is updated daily and includes

192

the relative volume of directions requests per country compared to a baseline volume on January

193

13, 2020. Apple has released the data for the three modes of human mobility: Driving, walking

194

and public transit. The mobility measures are normalized in the range 0-100 for each country at

195

the beginning of the series, so trends are relative to this baseline.

196

(iii)

Case incidence and genomic data for estimating reproduction number

197

In order to estimate the early reproduction number we use two different data sources. For

198

estimating the reproduction number from the genomic data, 111 SARS-CoV-2 genome samples

199

were obtained from the Global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID) repository

200

between February 27- May 29, 2020 [46]. For estimating the reproduction number from the case

201

incidence data (early reproduction number and the effective reproduction number), we utilized

202

publicly available time series of laboratory-confirmed cases by dates of symptom onset which

203

were obtained from the Mexican Ministry of Health as of December 5, 2020 [15].

204

(iv)

Case incidence data for Spatial analysis

205

We recovered daily case incidence data for all 32 states of Mexico from March 20 to December

206

5 from the Ministry of Health Mexico, as of December 5, 2020 [15].

207

(v)

Twitter data for twitter analysis

208

For the twitter data analysis, we retrieved data from the publicly available twitter data set of

209

COVID-19 chatter from March 12 to November 11, 2020 [47].

212

We harness three dynamics phenomenological models previously applied to various infectious

213

diseases (e.g., SARS, pandemic influenza, Ebola [48, 49] and the current COVID-19 outbreak

214

[50, 51]) for mortality modeling and short-term forecasting in Mexico and Mexico City. These

215

models include the simple scalar differential equation models such as the generalized logistic

216

growth model [49] and the Richards growth model [52]. We also utilize the sub-epidemic wave

217

model [48] that captures complex epidemic trajectories by assembling the contribution of

218

multiple overlapping sub-epidemic waves. The mortality forecasts obtained from these

219

mathematical models can provide valuable insights on the disease transmission mechanisms, the

220

efficacy of intervention strategies and the evaluation of optimal resource allocation procedures to

221

inform public health policies. COVID-19 pandemic forecasts generated by The Institute for

222

Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) are used as a competing benchmark model. The

223

description of these models is provided in the supplementary file.

224
225

The forecasts generated by calibrating our three phenomenological models using the IHME

226

smoothed data estimates (reference scenario) are compared with the forecasts generated by the

227

IHME reference scenario and two IHME counterfactual scenarios. The IHME reference scenario

228

depicts the “current projection”, which assumes that the social distancing measures are re-

229

imposed for six weeks whenever daily deaths reach eight per million. The second scenario

230

“mandates easing” implies what would happen if the government continues to ease social

231

distancing measures without re-imposition. Lastly, the third scenario, “universal masks”

232

accounts for universal facemask wearing, that reflects 95% mask usage in public and social

233

distancing mandates reimposed at 8 deaths per million. Detailed description of these modeling

234

scenarios and their assumptions is explained in ref. [43].

236

Model calibration and forecasting approach

237

We conducted 30-day ahead short-term forecasts utilizing thirteen data sets spanned over a

238

period of four months (July 4-October 9, 2020) (Table 1). Each forecast was fitted to the daily

239

death counts from the IHME smoothed data estimates reported between March 20-September 27,

240

2020 for (i) Mexico and (ii) Mexico City. The first calibration period relies on data from March

241

20-July 4, 2020. Sequentially models are recalibrated each week with the most up-to-date data,

242

meaning the length of the calibration period increases by one week up to August 2, 2020.

243

However, owing to irregular publishing of data estimates by the IHME, after August 2, 2020 the

244

length of calibration period increased by 2 weeks, followed by a one week increase from August

245

17-September 27, 2020 as the data estimates were again published every week.

We compare the cumulative mortality forecasting results obtained from our models to the

cumulative smoothed death estimates reported by IHME reference scenario as of November 11,

2020. Weekly forecasts obtained from our models were compared to the forecasts obtained from

254

the three IHME modeling scenarios for the same calibration and forecasting periods.

For each of the three models; GLM, Richards and the sub-epidemic model, we estimate the best

268

at the first data point for each of the three models [55]. Uncertainty bounds around the best-fit

269

solution are generated using parametric bootstrap approach with replacement of data assuming a

270

Poisson error structure for the GLM and sub-epidemic model, whereas a negative binomial error

271

structure was used to generate the uncertainty bounds of the Richards growth model; where we

assume the mean to be three times the variance based on the noise in the data. Detailed

description of this method is provided in ref [55].

Each of the M best-fit parameter sets are used to construct the 95% confidence intervals for each

parameter by refitting the models to each of the M = 300 datasets generated by the bootstrap

approach during the calibration phase. Further, each M best fit model solution is used to generate

278

m= 30 additional simulations with Poisson error structure for GLM and sub-epidemic model and

negative binomial error structure for Richards model extended through a 30-day forecasting

Performance metrics

285

We utilized the following four performance metrics to assess the quality of our model fit and the

286

30-day ahead short term forecasts: the mean absolute error (MAE) [58], the mean squared error

287

(MSE) [59], the coverage of the 95% prediction intervals [59], and the mean interval score (MIS)

288

[59] for each of the three models: GLM, Richards model and the sub-epidemic model. For

289

calibration performance, we compare the model fit to the observed smoothed death data

Mobility data analysis

317

In order to analyze the time series data for Mexico from March 20-December 5, 2020 for three

318

modes of mobility; driving, walking and public transport we utilize the R code developed by

319

Kieran Healy [60]. We analyze the mobility trends to look for any pattern in sync with the curve

320

of COVID-19 death counts. The time series for mobility requests is decomposed into trends,

321

weekly and remainder components. The trend is a locally weighted regression fitted to the data

322

and remainder is any residual left over on any given day after the underlying trend and normal

323

daily fluctuations have been accounted for.

326

We estimate the reproduction number, :, for the early ascending phase of the COVID-19

327

epidemic in Mexico and the instantaneous reproduction number :࢚ throughout the epidemic.

328

Reproduction number, :࢚ , is a crucial parameter that characterizes the average number of

329

secondary cases generated by a primary case at calendar time ; during the outbreak. This

330

quantity is critical to identify the magnitude of public health interventions required to contain an

331

epidemic [61-63]. Estimates of :࢚ indicate if the widespread disease transmission continues

332

(:࢚ >1) or disease transmission declines (:࢚ <1). Therefore, in order to contain an outbreak, it is

333

vital to maintain :࢚ <1.

335

Estimating the reproduction number, :࢚ , from case incidence using generalized growth

336

model (GGM). The GGM is a useful phenomenological model that allows relaxation of the

337

exponential growth during early ascending phase of the outbreak via a modulating “deceleration

338

interval of SARS-CoV-2 is modeled assuming gamma distribution with a mean of 5.2 days and a

349

standard deviation of 1.72 days [65]. We estimate the growth rate parameter , and the

350

deceleration of growth parameter , as described above. The GGM model is used to simulate the

351

progression of local incidence cases $௜ at calendar time ௜ . This is followed by the application of

352

the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval denoted by =௜ to the renewal

368

In this equation, $௧ is the number of new infections on day  and ?௦ represents the infectivity

369

function, which is the infectivity profile of the infected individual. This is dependent on the time

370

since infection (s), but is independent of the calendar time (t) [71, 72].

371
372

The term ∑௧௦ୀଵ $௧ି௦ ?௦ describes the sum of infection incidence up to time step t − 1, weighted by

373

the infectivity function ?௦ . The distribution of the generation time can be applied to approximate

374

?௦ , however, since the time of infection is a rarely observed event, measuring the distribution of

375

generation time becomes difficult [69]. Therefore, the time of symptom onset is usually used to

376

estimate the distribution of serial interval (SI), which is defined as the time interval between the

377

dates of symptom onset among two successive cases in a disease transmission chain [73].

378
379

The infectiousness of a case is a function of the time since infection, which is proportional to ?௦

380

if the timing of infection in the primary case is set as time zero of ?௦ and we assume that the

381

generation interval equals the SI. The SI was assumed to follow a gamma distribution with a

382

mean of 5.2 days and a standard deviation of 1.72 days [65]. Analytical estimates of Rt were

383

obtained within a Bayesian framework using EpiEstim R package in R language [73]. Rt was

384

estimated at 7-day intervals. We reported the median and 95% credible interval (CrI).

392

sequences from other geographical regions, down sampled to n=4325 representative sequences.

393

We used the sequence subsample from Nextstrain (www.nextstrain.org) global analysis as of

394

August 15, 2020. These sequences were aligned to the reference genome taken from the

395

literature [74] using MUSCLE [75] and trimmed to the same length of 29772 bp. The maximum

plotted data, we removed all retweets and tweets not in the Spanish language. We also filtered by

437

the following hashtags: #quedateencasa, and #trabajardesdecasa, which are two of the most used

438

hashtags when users refer to the COVID-19 pandemic and their engagement with health

439

measures. Lastly, we limited the tweets to the ones that originated from Mexico, via its 2-code

440

country code: MX. A set of 521,359 unique tweets were gathered from March 12 to November

441

11, 2020. We then overlay the curve of tweets over the epi-curve in Mexico to observe any

442

relation between the shape of the epidemic case trajectory and the frequency of tweets during the

time period, March 12- November 11, 2020. We also estimate the correlation coefficient between

Results

Fig 1 (upper panel) shows the daily COVID-19 death curve in Mexico and Mexico City from

448

March 20-November 11, 2020. As of November 11, 2020, Mexico has reported 105,656 deaths

449

whereas Mexico City has reported 15,742 deaths as per the IHME smoothed death estimates. The

450

mobility trend for Mexico (Fig 1, lower panel) shows that the human mobility tracked in the

451

form of walking, driving and public transportation declined from end of March to the beginning

452

of June, corresponding to the implementation of social distancing interventions and the Jornada

453

Nacional de Sana Distancia that was put in place between March 23-May 30, 2020

454

encompassing the suspension of non-essential activities in public, private and social sectors [82].

455

The driving and walking trend subsequently increased in June with the reopening of the non-

456

essential services. Fig 1 (upper panel) shows that reopening coincides with the highest levels of

457

daily deaths. These remain at a high level for just over two months (June and July). Then, from

over a period of seven months (March-September), based on the calibration phases as provided

in Table S1 and Fig 2, the sub-epidemic model outperforms the GLM with lower RMSE

09/13, 3/20-09/20, 3/20-09/27. The GLM model outperforms the other two models for the

485

remaining six calibration phases in terms of RMSE. The Richards model has substantially higher

486

RMSE (between 10.2-24.9) across all thirteen calibration phases. The sub-epidemic model also

487

outperforms the other two models in terms of MAE, MIS and the 95% PI coverage. The sub-

488

epidemic model shows the lowest values for MIS and the highest 95% PI coverage for nine of

489

the thirteen calibration phases (Table S1). Moreover, the sub-epidemic model outperforms the

490

other two models in eleven calibration phases for MAE. The Richards model shows much higher

MIS and lower 95% PI coverage compared to the GLM and sub-epidemic model.

followed by the Richards model (85.9- 100%) and the GLM model (53.2-100%) (Table S2, Fig

Over-all the goodness of fit metrics points toward the sub-epidemic model as the most

Comparison of daily death forecasts

541

The thirteen sequentially generated daily death forecasts from GLM and Richards growth model,

542

for Mexico and Mexico City indicate towards a sustained decline in the number of deaths (S1

543

Fig, S2 Fig, S3 Fig and S4 Fig). However, the IHME model (actual smoothed death data

544

estimates) shows a decline in the number of deaths for the first six forecasts periods followed by

545

a stable epidemic trajectory for the last seven forecasts, for Mexico City and Mexico. Unlike the

546

GLM and Richards models, the sub-epidemic model is able to reproduce the observed

547

stabilization of daily deaths observed after the first six forecast periods for Mexico and the last

548

three forecasts for Mexico City (S5 Fig, S6 Fig, S7 Fig and S8 Fig)

Comparison of cumulative mortality forecasts

551

The total number of COVID-19 deaths is an important quantity to measure the progression of an

552

epidemic. Here we present and compare the results of our 30-day ahead cumulative forecasts

553

generated using GLM, Richards and sub-epidemic growth model against the actual reported

554

smoothed death data estimates using the estimates of deaths obtained from the IHME death data

555

reported as of November 11, 2020. Figs 6 and 7 present a comparative assessment of the

556

estimated cumulative death counts derived from our three models along with their comparison

557

with three IHME modeling scenarios; current projection, universal masks and mandates easing;

558

for our thirteen sequentially generated forecasts.

Mexico. The 30 day ahead forecast results for the thirteen sequentially generated forecasts for

575

Mexico utilizing GLM, Richards model, sub-epidemic growth model and IHME model are

576

presented in S9 Fig, S10 Fig, S11 Fig and S12 Fig. The cumulative death comparison is given in

577

Fig 6. For the first, second, third and thirteenth generated forecasts the GLM, sub-epidemic

578

model and the Richards model tend to underestimate the true deaths counts (~50,255, ~54,857,

579

~58,604, 89,730 deaths), whereas the three IHME forecasting scenarios closely estimate the

580

actual death counts. For the fourth, fifth and seventh generated forecast the sub-epidemic model

581

and the IHME scenarios most closely approximate the actual death counts ~63,078, ~67,075,

582

~76,054 deaths respectively). For the sixth generated forecast the GLM model closely

583

approximates the actual death count (~73,911 deaths) whereas for the tenth generated forecast

584

the sub-epidemic model closely approximates the actual deaths (~84,471 deaths). For the eighth,

585

ninth, eleventh and twelfth generated forecast GLM, Richards and sub-epidemic model tend to

under-predict the actual death counts with IHME model estimates closely approximating the

587

actual death counts (Table 2).

593

In summary, the Richards growth model consistently under-estimates the actual death count

594

compared to the GLM, sub-epidemic and three IHME model scenarios. The GLM model also

595

provides lower estimates of the mean death counts compared to the sub-epidemic and three

596

IHME model scenarios, but higher mean death estimates than the Richards model. The 95% PI

597

for the Richards model is substantially wider than the other two models. Moreover, the three

598

IHME model scenarios predict approximately similar cumulative death counts across the thirteen

599

generated forecasts, hence indicating that they do not differ substantially.

601

Mexico City. The 30 day ahead forecast results for thirteen sequentially generated forecasts for

602

the Mexico City utilizing GLM, Richards model, sub-epidemic growth model and IHME model

603

are presented in S13 Fig, S14 Fig, S15 Fig and S16 Fig. The cumulative death comparison is

604

given in Fig 7 and Table 3. For the fourth and fifth generated forecast all models under-predict

605

the true death counts (11,326, 11,769 deaths respectively). For the first and second generated

606

forecast the sub-epidemic model and the IHME scenarios closely approximate the actual death

607

count (~10,081, ~10,496 deaths). For the third and sixth generated forecast GLM and Richards

608

model underestimate the actual death count (~10,859, ~12,615 deaths respectively) whereas the

609

sub-epidemic model over predicts the death count for the third forecast and under-predicts the

610

death count for the sixth forecast. The three IHME model scenarios seem to predict the actual

611

death counts closely. From the seventh-thirteenth generated forecasts, all models under-predict

612

the actual death counts.

In general, the Richards growth model has much wider 95% PI coverage compared to the other

620

models. The mean cumulative death count estimates for the GLM and Richards model closely

621

approximate each other for the cumulative forecasts. However, the actual mean death counts lie

622

within the 95% PI of the GLM and sub-epidemic model for all the thirteen forecasts. The three

623

IHME model scenarios predict approximately similar cumulative death counts across the thirteen

624

generated forecasts with much narrow 95% PI’s.

Estimate of reproduction number, R from genomic data analysis. The majority of analyzed

629

Mexican SARS-CoV-2 sequences (69 out of 83) have been sampled in March and April, 2020.

630

These sequences are spread along the whole global SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny (Fig 8) and split

631

into multiple clusters. This indicates multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to the country

632

during the initial pandemic stage (February 27- May 29, 2020). For the largest cluster of size 42,

633

the reproduction number was estimated at >

1.3 (95% HPD interval [1.1,1.5]).

clearly visible. For cluster 1, the rate rises rapidly from April to July and then shows small

687

fluctuations. For cluster 2, there is rapid increase in growth rate from April to July followed by a

688

rapid decline. Chihuahua in cluster 3 shows a slow growth rate until September followed by a

689

rapid rise until mid-September which then declines rapidly. For cluster 4, the rate rises slowly,

690

from April to September, and then shows a rapid rise (Fig S20).

692

From the colormap (Fig 12) we can see that the cases were concentrated from the beginning in

693

the central region in Mexico and Mexico City. Daily cases have been square root transformed to

694

reduce variability in the amplitude of the time series while dashed lines separate the Northern,

695

Central, and Southern regions. Fig S20 shows the timeseries graph of daily COVID-19 new cases

696

by the date for all states, Northern states, Central states, and the Southern states. As observed for

697

both Northern and Central regions including the national level, the epidemic peaked in mid-July

698

followed by a decline at around mid-September, which then started rising again. Southern states

699

exhibit a stable decline. Fig S21 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases at state level as of

700

December 5, 2020.

Some of the areas with a higher concentration of COVID-19 cases are: Mexico City, Mexico

state, Guanajuato in the central region and, Nuevo Leon in the Northern region.

hashtag (stay-at-home order hashtag) has been gradually declining as the number of cases have

710

continued to increase or remain at a steady pace, showing the frustration of public on the

711

relaxation of lock downs. Mostly the non-government public health experts are calling for more

712

lockdowns or social distancing measures but are not being heard by the authorities. It could also

713

imply that the population is not following the government’s stay at home orders and hence we

714

continue to observe the cases. S22 Fig shows that the highest number of tweets were made in the

715

earlier part of the epidemic, with the number of tweets decreasing as of June 2020. In contrast,

716

the number of cases by onset dates peaked around mid-June. The correlation coefficient between

717

the epicurve of cases by dates of onset and the curve of tweets representing the stay-at-home

718

orders was estimated at R=-0.001 from March 12- November 11, 2020.

720

Discussion

721

The results of our GLM model fit to the death data for all the thirteen calibration phases and

722

GGM fit to the case incidence data indicate sub-exponential growth dynamics of COVID-19

723

epidemic in the Mexico and Mexico City with the parameter p estimated between (p~0.6-0.8).

724

Moreover, the early estimates of R indicate towards sustained disease transmission in the country

725

with >௧ estimated at 0.9 as of September 27, 2020. As the virus transmission continues in

726

Mexico, the twitter analysis implies the relaxation of lockdowns, with not much decline in the

727

mobility patterns observed over the last few weeks as evident from the Apple’s mobility trends.

728

Moreover, the systematic comparison of our models across thirteen sequential forecasts deem

729

sub-epidemic model as the most appropriate model for mortality forecasting. The sub-epidemic

730

model is also able to reproduce the stabilization in the trajectory of mortality forecasts as

731

observed by the most recent IHME forecasts.

732
733

The sub-exponential growth pattern of the COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico can be attributed to a

734

myriad of factors including non-homogenous mixing, spatial structure, population mobility,

735

behavior changes and interventions [83]. These results are also consistent with the sub-

736

exponential growth patterns of COVID-19 outbreaks observed in Mexico [84] and Chile [85].

737

Along with the sub-exponential growth dynamics, the reproduction number estimated from the

738

genomic sequence analysis and the case incidence data (>௧ ~ 1.1-1.2) indicate towards sustained

739

transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Mexico during the early transmission phase of the virus

740

(February 27- May 29, 2020), with similar estimates of reproduction number retrieved from

741

another study in Mexico [86] and Chile for the same time period [87]. These estimates of >௧ are

742

similar to those derived for other Latin American countries including Peru, Chile and Brazil that

743

have observed similar outbreaks of COVID-19 in the surrounding regions [85, 88]. The early

744

estimate of >௧ obtained from the Cori et al. method also coincides with the early estimates of >௧

745

obtained from the case incidence data and the genomic data (>௧ ~1). The instantaneous

746

reproduction number estimated from our study shows that >௧ is slightly above 1 since the end of

747

March, without a significant increase. This is in accordance with the estimates of >௧ obtained

748

from another study conducted in Mexico [89].

749
750

In general, Mexico has seen a sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission and an increase or a

751

sustained steady number of cases despite the social distancing interventions including the stay-at-

752

home orders that were declared on April 12, 2020 and eased around June 2020. As our twitter

753

data analysis also shows, the number of cases by onset dates was negatively correlated to the

754

stay-at-home orders, indicating population’s frustration towards the stay-at-home orders and

36

755

reopening the country resulting in pandemic fatigue. Hence, people might have stopped

756

following the government’s preventive orders to stay at home. Mexico has been one of the

757

countries where the stay-at-home orders have been least respected, with an average reduction in

758

mobility in Mexico reported to be ~35.4% compared to 71% in Brazil, and 86% in Argentina and

759

Colombia [90]. The intensity of these orders have affected the population disproportionately,

760

with some proportion of the population showing aggression towards quarantine and stay-at-home

761

orders [32]. We can also appreciate the variable spatial-temporal dynamics of the COVID-19

762

epidemic in Mexico. Our classification of epidemic pattern at the state level in Mexico shows

763

distinct variation of growth rates across states. For instance, cluster 1 including Baja California,

764

Colima and Mexico City has stable growth at a higher rate and cluster 4 including

765

Aguascalientes, Durango, Queretaro, and Zacatecas shows a rising pattern in the growth rate

766

(Figure 11). This information can be used by the states in guiding their decision regarding the

767

public health measures. For example, states in cluster 1 and 4 may need strict public health

768

measures to contain the epidemic.

769
770

We compared the performance of our three models for short-term real-time forecasting the

771

COVID-19 death estimates in Mexico and Mexico City. As in Fig 2-5 the sub-epidemic model

772

can be declared the most appropriate model as it exhibits the most desirable performance metrics

773

across majority of the calibration and forecasting phases. This model has the capacity to

774

accommodate more complex trajectories suggesting a longer epidemic wave and can better

775

adjust to the early signs of changes in transmission of the disease, while other models (GLM and

776

Richards) are less reactive. This model can also be utilized as a potential forecasting tool for

777

other cities in Mexico and compared with other models. Moreover, shorter forecasts (5,10 days)

37

778

could be also be conducted with the sub-epidemic model using the consecutive calibration

779

phases to further reduce the error metrics [48].

780
781

Overall, the sequential forecasts based on the daily smoothed death estimates for Mexico from

782

the two models (GLM, Richards) suggest a decline in over-all deaths (S1 Fig and S2 Fig)

783

consistent with the sustained decline in COVID-19 associated case fatalities since mid-August as

784

reported by the Mexican government officially [91]. However, this decline in COVID-19 deaths

785

can be attributed to the inaccurate reporting of deaths in the surveillance system or downplay of

786

fatalities by the government. For instance, the reported excess deaths as of September 26, 2020

787

are estimated to be 193170, with 139151 attributable to COVID-19 [92]. While the official tally

788

of COVID-19 deaths in Mexico is only exceeded by USA and Brazil, its roughly approximated

789

with that of India, a country whose population is ten times larger than Mexico [93]. As observed

790

earlier, the easing of the social distancing interventions and lifting of lockdowns in Mexico in the

791

month of June led to a surge of the COVID-19 associated deaths [94]. In June, the government of

792

Mexico also inaccurately forecasted a potential decline in the number of COVID-19 deaths to

793

occur in September [95]. Therefore, the forecasting trends need to be interpreted cautiously in

794

order to inform policies. The IHME model also shows a decline in COVID-19 deaths in Mexico

795

from mid-August-September, which have stabilized since then for the last six forecast periods

796

(S5 Fig). The sub-epidemic model also indicates a stabilization of the deaths for the last seven

797

forecast periods (S6 Fig) consistent with the results of the IHME model.

798
799

Similarly, for Mexico City, the sequential forecasts obtained from the GLM and Richards model

800

fit to the daily death data estimates indicate a decline in the overall deaths (S3 Fig, S4 Fig). The

38

801

IHME and sub-epidemic models on the other hand indicate a stabilized trajectory of deaths for

802

the last three forecast periods (S7 Fig and S8 Fig) (suggesting that the actual death counts might

803

not be decreasing in Mexico City) as seen with Mexico. Based on the death data, the observed

804

decline or stability in death predictions could likely reflects the false slowing down of the

805

epidemic in Mexico City [94]. Moreover, insufficient testing can also result in an inaccurate

806

trajectory of the COVID-19 death curve [96].

807
808

The cumulative comparison of deaths in Mexico and Mexico City indicates that in general, the

809

Richards model has under-performed in predicting the actual death counts with much wider

810

uncertainty around the mean death estimates. The Richards model has also failed to capture the

811

early sub-exponential dynamics of the death curve. The cumulative death counts obtained from

812

the flexible sub-epidemic model closely approximate the cumulative death counts obtained from

813

the three IHME modeling scenarios. Whereas the GLM slightly under predicts the cumulative

814

death counts (Fig 6, Fig 7). On the other hand the COVID-19 predictions model projects 87,151

815

deaths (95% PI:84,414, 91,883) for Mexico as of October 27, 2020 (last forecasting phase), an

816

estimate that closely approximates the estimates obtained from the GLM model (between

817

77,258-93,454 deaths) [97].

818
819

The three models (GLM, Richards, sub-epidemic model) used in this study generally provide

820

good fits to the mortality curve, based on the residuals, with the Richards model unable to

821

capture the early sub-exponential dynamics of the death curve. Moreover, these

822

phenomenological models are particularly valuable for providing rapid predictions of the

823

epidemic trajectory in complex scenarios that can be used for real-time preparedness since these

39

824

models do not require specific disease transmission processes to account for the interventions.

825

Since these models do not explicitly account for behavioral changes, the results should be

826

interpreted with caution. Importantly, since the death curves employed in this study are reported

827

according to the date of reporting, they are likely influenced by variation in the testing rates and

828

related factors including the case fatality rates. Further, delays in reporting of deaths due to the

829

magnitude of the epidemic could also influence our predictions. Moreover, using the reporting

830

date is not ideal, due to the time difference between the death date and the reporting date of

831

death, which at a given moment can give a false impression of the ongoing circumstances.

832
833

This paper is not exempt from limitations. First, the IHME (current projections, mandated mask,

834

and worst-case scenario) model utilized has been revised multiple times over the course of the

835

pandemic and differs substantially in methodology, assumptions, range of predictions and

836

quantities estimated. Second, the IHME has been irregular in publishing the downloadable

837

estimates online for some periods. Third, we model the death estimates by date of reporting

838

rather than by the date of death. Lastly, the unpredictable social component of the epidemic on

839

ground is also a limiting factor for the study as we do not know the ground truth death pattern

840

when the forecasts are generated.

841
842

In conclusion, the reproduction number has been fluctuating around ~1.0 from end of July-end of

843

September 2020, indicating sustained virus transmission in the region, as the country has seen

844

much lower mobility reduction and mixed reactions towards the stay-at-home orders. Moreover,

845

the spatial analysis indicates that states like Mexico, Michoacán, Morelos, Nuevo Leon, Baja

846

California need much strict public health measures to contain the epidemic. The GLM and sub-

847

epidemic model applied to mortality data in Mexico provide reasonable estimates for short-term

848

projections in near real-time. While the GLM and Richards models predict that the COVID-19

849

outbreak in Mexico and Mexico City may be on a sustained decline, the sub-epidemic model and

850

IHME model predict a stabilization of daily deaths. However, our forecasts need to be

851

interpreted with caution given the dynamic implementation and lifting of the social distancing

852

measures.

Fig 9: Upper panel: Reproduction number with 95% CI estimated using the GGM model. The estimated

1181

reproduction number of the COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico as of May 29, 2020, 2020 is 1.1 (95% CI:

1182

1.1, 1.1). The growth rate parameter, r, is estimated at 1.2(95%CI: 1.1, 1.4) and the deceleration of growth

1183

parameter, p, is estimated at 0.7 (95%CI:0.68, 0.71).
