ABSTRACT
Since late 2019 the world is facing the rapid spreading of a novel viral disease (SARSCoV-2) provoked by the coronavirus 2 infection (COVID-19), declared pandemic last 12
March 2020. As of 27 March 2020, there were more than 500,000 confirmed cases and
23,335 deaths worldwide. In those places with a rapid growth in numbers of sick people
in need of hospitalization and intensive care, this demand has over-saturate the medical
facilities and, in turn, rise the mortality rate.
In the absence of a vaccine, classical epidemiological measures such as testing,
quarantine and physical distancing are ways to reduce the growing speed of new
infections. Thus, these measures should be a priority for all governments in order to
minimize the morbidity and mortality associated to this disease.
System dynamics is widely used in many fields of the biological sciences to study and
explain changing systems. The system dynamics approach can help us understand the
rapid spread of an infectious disease such as COVID-19 and also generate scenarios to
test the effect of different control measures.
The aim of this study is to provide an open model (using STELLA® from Iseesystems)
that can be customized to any area/region and by any user, allowing them to evaluate
the different behavior of the COVID-19 dynamics under different scenarios. Thus, our
intention is not to generate a model to accurately predict the evolution of the disease nor
to supplant others more robust -official and non-official- from governments and renowned
institutions. We believe that scenarios comparison can be an effective tool to convince
the society of the need of a colossal and unprecedented effort to reduce new infections
and ultimately, fatalities.

INTRODUCTION
Since late 2019 the world is facing the rapid spreading of a novel viral disease (COVID19) provoked by the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. On 12 March 2020, this
infectious disease was declared pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). As
of 27 March 2020, there were more than 500,000 confirmed cases and 23,335 deaths
worldwide.
An
updated
daily
report
can
be
seen
at
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/.
The case fatality rate of COVID-19 varies depending on the country and the state of the
pandemic (updated information at https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-casefatality-rates/) and it oscillates generally around 3% and 6% with some exceptions such
as Italy, where it reaches 10%. The case fatality rate (CFR) was established at 1.6% in
South Korea, 3.04% in China, 10.09% in Italy, and 7.38% in Spain, but the latter might
be overestimated since many mild cases have not been spotted. CFR may depend on
the quality of the health care received by the patient, detection capacity of each country,
previous conditions and age of the patient and also, and probably the most relevant
number, the effort in diagnosing, that would rise up the numbers of confirmed infected
people (WHO 2020a).
What seems to be clear is that, in those places were there has been a rapid growth in
numbers of sick people in need of hospitalization and intensive care, this demand has
over-saturated the medical facilities and availability of specialists which in turn, has risen
the mortality rate by the shortage of health care resources. This dramatic scenario can
be seen now in Italy, where the shortage in ICU (Intensive Care Unit) increased the crude
mortality ratio up to a 7.7% (Lazzerrini and Putoto, 2020).
In the absence of a vaccine, classical epidemiological measures such as testing in order
to isolate the infected people, quarantine and physical distancing of people are ways to
reduce the growing speed of new infections as much as possible and as soon as
possible. Thus, this measure is being a priority for all governments in order to minimize
the morbidity and mortality associated to this disease (Ferguson et al. 2020, WHO 2020
a).
System dynamics is widely used in many fields of the biological sciences to study and
explain changing systems, such as population dynamics, predator-prey dynamics,
spread of diseases or pests (Hannon and Ruth, 2009). The system dynamics approach
can help us understand the rapid spread of an infectious disease such as COVID-19 and
also generate scenarios in the model to test the effect of different control measures.
The aim of this study is to provide an open model that can be customized to any
area/region and by any user, allowing them to generate scenarios to compare different
intervention measures and evaluate the different behavior of the COVID-19 dynamics.
Thus, our intention is not to generate a model to accurately predict the evolution of the
disease nor to supplant others more robust -official and non-official- from governments
and renowned institutions. We believe that scenarios comparison can be an effective
tool to convince the society of the need of a colossal and unprecedented effort to reduce
new infections and ultimately, fatalities.

METHODS
1. MODEL STRUCTURE AND CUSTOMIZATION
We used data of COVID-19 spread from Spain to calibrate the model and show how to
generate scenarios.
To build the model, we used the program STELLA® (IseeSystems) version 9.0.2. This
permits to generate a model that can be adapted to all kind of scenarios by anyone with
a basic knowledge of STELLA®, since our intention is also to promote participation of
other scientists, health care workers and policy-makers to improve the structure and
accuracy of the model.
We decided to use a SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered) model adapted
to the complexity of the COVID-19 spread.
STELLA® works with 4 main items: Stocks, Flows, Converters and Connectors (Figure
1):
•

The Stocks represent something that accumulates people in this case (mainly),
although they can also refer to materials, money, etc. At any time, the Stocks
reflect the numbers of items. They are represented by rectangles.

•

Flows are the inputs and outputs of the Stocks. They reflect the number of items
that enters or exits a Stock per unit of time. In this model we use ‘day’ as a unit
of time. They are represented by a wide arrow with a valve.

•

Converters are used to modify an activity; they are numbers (e.g. a constant) or
formulae that will change their result depending on other parameters (i.e. other
Converters or Stocks value). The symbol is a red circle.

•

The Connectors transmit an input or an output from/to a Converter, Stock or Flow.
They are represented by a red thin line.

This stock (conveyor type) is for those people that
develop a mild condition (no medical care

Asymptomatic, although most of the asymptomatic
cases progress to symptomatic ones. They are
infective, but they are not diagnosed due to their
mild symptoms. Thus, they are not reflected in the

X R0 Contacts per
infected per day

This rate is a
graphical
function. Along
365 days, a
different R0 can
be applied for
each day. It can
be seen that
after an initial R0
of 2.8 (Spain
from data), it
drops at day 36
of the simulation
to 0.1 (isolation measures).

A R0 value can be set for
each day of the simulation (up
to 365 days).

X Quarantine rate mild
patients at home

This is set at 1 (100%) by default, that is, people at home with
mild symptoms that are isolated.

This value can be set to any
between 0 and 1.

X Number of
respirators

The Number of respirators must be set at each scenario, just
double-click and change the value.

X Death rate ICU vs
Respirators

The Death rate ICU vs. Respirators can be different depending
on the number of respirators. The higher the utilization rate is, the
higher should be the death rate.

Data can be changed to make
real or theoretical scenarios.
The values in the model are
not real, just to show how this
variable works. If a real
scenario is needed, these
numbers should be estimated
according to the local
experience or considering
similar situations in other
places with comparable health
care facilities.

Note that in this model, R0 is
not the Basic Reproduction
Number of the epidemic, a
dimensionless number which
represents the expected
number of cases directly
generated by one case when
all individuals are susceptible
to infection (Fraser et al.
2009). In our case, R0 is the
number of contacts per
infected and per day (see
model for more details about
calculations).

Line 3 shows the number of deaths in the second scenario, when
the mortality rate increases as the saturation of the ICU services
goes up. Line 1 shows a constant and low mortality rate, no
matter the saturation of ICU is.
Stocks of people Subclinic and Asymptomatic are those that
maintain the epidemic growing.
The strategy of performing massive test among all population (not
symptomatic or subclinic) can reduce the deaths toll, and even,
be cheaper than ICU or hospital stays.

The model permits to make different scenarios with different entry
of infected travelers from outside the system. The graphical
function allows to put a different number of infected travelers per
day (along 365 days).

The death toll can be affected significantly if infected newcomers
enter the system. In the graph below, blue line (1) is the result of
modeling with only one infected person at time 0. Lines
numbered as 2 and 3 correspond to 10 people infected
(newcomers at day 10); and line 4, 10 people at day 1, 100
people new at day 10, and 100 more infected people at day 20.
The result shows a differential death toll of almost 300.

measures were set by the Spanish Government (14 March 2020).

The adjustment of the number of deaths and fatality rate is shown in Figure 5. We had
to apply a non-constant fatality rate to better fit the real numbers. Doted red and green

second, with a lower fatality rate after a peak.

RESULTS
Once we calibrated the model, we built up different scenarios and compared them.
Scenario 1. Implement isolation measures vs. no isolation at all
Isolation measures would affect the initial R0. In order to compare the effect of the
implementation of different degrees of isolation measures, we set the same R0 at the
beginning (until 14 March) and lower R0 after the lockdown.
A) Constant R0 of 2.32: no social distancing measures are implemented.
B) Initial R0 of 2.32, and R0 of 0 from 14 March, representing a theoretical scenario
where there is not a single new infection after the lockdown.
C) Initial R0 of 2.32, and R0 of 0.1 from 14 March, representing hard social
distancing measures.
D) Initial R0 of 2.32, and R0 of 0.8 from 14 March, representing medium social
distancing measures.
E) Initial R0 of 2.32, and R0 of 1.5 from 14 March, representing milder social
distancing measures.

Figure 6. Scenario 1: Implemented isolation measures vs. no measures. Isolation measures
would affect R0 from the day the measures are implemented. R0 of 2.32 during all the period
represents no isolation measures. R0 0 and R0 0.1 represent hard isolation, being R0 0 the
minimum theoretical, impossible to achieve. It seems that the R0 achieved after 14 March is
around 1.5.

Scenario 2. Isolation measures one week after their actual adoption
We claim the usefulness of this approach to test theoretical scenarios. In Figure 7 we
show the results of implementing the lockdown one week later (from 14 to 21 March).
In order to get this scenario, we set the R0 from 21 March at 0.8.

Figure 7. Scenario 2: Isolation measures implemented on 14 March vs. on 21 March using a R0
of 1.5 after the isolation measures’ onset. Violet dotted line shows no isolation measures taken.

Scenario 3. Testing randomly all the population without symptoms on 14 March
From a basic scenario (R0 at 2.32 before 14 March and at 0.8 after that date), we
analyzed the hypothetical action of randomly testing the asymptomatic people, i.e.
uninfected and infected (asymptomatic and subclinical) people. In Figure 8, four
scenarios are shown. All four refer to an unrealistic testing period of one day (14
March) when 5, 10, 20 and 30 million tests would be done. A positive test implies that a
person goes into quarantine and hence, without any possibility to infect other people.

Figure 8. Scenario 3: Testing randomly people without symptoms and subclinical on 14 March.
All scenarios with a R0 of 2.32 before 14 March, and of 0.8 afterwards. We hypothesized that if
massive testing had been performed, R0 would have been kept at 0.8.

Scenario 4. Ceasing or relaxing the isolation measures some days after the
lockdown
From a basic scenario (R0 2.32 before 14 March and 0.8 from 14 March), we tested what
1) what would have happened if the isolation measures had ceased
2) what would have happened if the isolation measures had ceased or relaxed eight
days after the lock down, that is 22 March, (R0 0.8 to 2.32) or get less severe (R0 0.8 to
1.4). Results are shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Scenario 4: Testing the effect of ceasing or relaxing the isolation measures. From a
basic scenario (R0 2.32 before 14 March and 0.8 from 14 March), we tested what would happen
if, 8 days after the lock down, the isolation measures ceased (R0 0.8 to 2.32) or turned into less
severe measures (R0 0.8 to 1.4).

Scenario 5. Predicting when would the peak of infections per day occur and the
effect of different degrees of isolation measures

From the basic scenario (R0 2.32 before 14 March and 0.8 from 14 March), we predicted
when the peak in infections per day would occur, and compared different R0 values,
representing from harder isolation measures (lower R0) to more relaxed ones (higher
R0). Figure 10 shows the result of the simulation.

Figure 10 Scenario 5: Representation of estimated daily flow of infected people. Peak of
infections per day is estimated to occur around 8-9 April. After that peak, it is crucial to maintain
the isolation measures (lowering R0 as much as possible) in order to minimize the daily flow of
new infections. A R0 below 0.15 would be desirable, i.e. a new case of infection every 6.7 infected
cases.

DISCUSSION
The entire world is facing a new pathogen, so far unknown for humans. Nevertheless,
some experts had been lately suggesting that a similar scenario could happen (Allen et
al. 2017).
Although the model has limitations, since it is a simplification of the reality, the results of
the calibrated model (Figure 3) fits quite well with the official data of infected people with
COVID-10 in Spain until 24 March. Until today, it is difficult to obtain the most probable
R0 after 14 March because of the time lag of detected patients due to the incubation
period (set at 6 days). Therefore, further time is needed to quantify the effect of mitigation
measures in the R0 reduction.
We think that the real amount of infected people would reach, at least, 2.1 times the
official numbers, calculated from a 3.4% fatality rate from days 24 and 25 March (Figure
4). If the fatality rate estimation changed, the real numbers of infected people would rise
up consequently. It is important to remark that not knowing the real numbers of infected
people does not significantly affect the power of the approach we propose here, since
the comparison of different scenarios (e.g. reducing R0 after a day or another) uses the
same base model. Hence, we can say that the measure that works better in the model,
would work better in the real world as well. Besides, the results of this model would
improve if we could adjust all the parameters to the real situation. Then, we could build

a more robust model. In fact, our intention is to generate further versions of this model
with whenever more accurate parameters are available.
Fatality numbers followed a smooth curve until 24 March, when the increase of deaths
was higher than expected, but on 25 March it went down again. In case the amount of
fatalities does not follow the way pointed out by the dotted lines in Figure 5A, we will
recalculate the fatality rates showed in Figure 5A and 5B, but we will wait a few more
days. Moreover, more time is still needed to check a possible third scenario, that is a
higher case fatality rate as the epidemic saturates health services.
Regarding the social distancing measures, the model detects and quantifies the positive
effect of reducing the R0, as seen in Figure 6. According to our results, the earlier the
measures are taken, the better, as seen in Figure 7.
We also tested what would happen if a random testing policy for all population would
have been adopted. Even performing 20 or 30 million tests (from a population of 47
million) the result is poor (Figure 8), indicating that the efforts of testing should be more
focused on suspected cases. This last approach was adopted in China by a contact
tracing strategy (WHO 2020c) that allowed isolation of those infected prior to symptoms,
and also a door-to-door monitoring to identify cases with symptoms (Shen et al. 2020).
In the last of the scenarios, we analyzed what would happen if the isolation measures
ceased 10 days after their implementation. As seen in Figure 9, these measures should
not cease, since there are still infective individuals in the population and no herd
immunization is operating due to the low percentage of population recovered and thus,
immunized by illness.
With the parameters used in the model, the peak of infected cases will occur around 89th April (Figure 10). These numbers could be more accurate by using more reliable data
of the COVID-19 evolution of the real infected population. Nonetheless, we think the error
of the model could be of few days. Other models state that the peak would occur around
14th April in Spain (Burgos-Simón et al. 2020).
It is interesting to point out that it would be vital to prevent infection number from
increasing, maintaining the lowest R0 possible after the peak. As seen in Figure 10, an
R0 higher than 0.15 would rise the number of new cases of infection again.
Other models of the spreading of COVID-19 in Spain, e.g. Burgos-Simón et al (2020),
did not compare scenarios of different actions to reduce the speed of spreading and
stated that the peak would occur between 18 and 20 April, about 10 days after our
calculations (Figure 10). Arenas et al (2000) predicted ICU saturation from the end of
March to the 23 April, although we did not represent the ICU patients, the peak of new
infected people (Figure 10) is expected for the 8-9 April, so ICU higher demand will be
concentrated from some weeks after that date, probably a couple of weeks after Arenas’
model. Another model applied in Spain with data from 28 February with few dozens of
cases (Aleta and Moreno, 2020) expressed the necessity of early detection of positive
cases with symptoms. But from our point of view, due to the incubation period when the
patient is contagious and the great percentage of asymptomatic and subclinical cases,
that strategy would have been not enough to stop the spread of this disease, now a
pandemic.
Comparison of different scenarios has already been done by other researchers, such as
Ferguson et al. (2020) for the United Kingdom, remarking that both models, ours and

Ferguson’s, reflect the advantages of physical distance among people to reduce the
number of infections.
This model does not pretend to impersonate official predictions nor scenarios about the
COVID-19 spread in the different areas or countries. Considering the complexity of the
spreading phenomenon and the exponential component, it is an impossible task for
researchers and professionals interested in this pandemic to attempt to predict the
dynamics or the effect of different measures without using a model that includes the main
aspects of the pandemic. Regarding the forecast for Spain, there are further constraints
on the model adjustment i.e. frequent changes in counting rules of infected people and
case definition, and changes in testing and isolation policies. In fact, isolation measures
were announced to become harder in Spain from Monday, 30 March.
Moreover, the evolution of the epidemic differs greatly from one Spanish region to
another due to the spatial distribution of the people (rural areas vs. big cities), to
population movements, and regional health systems´ characteristics, among others. It
must be said that rates can be better calculated in samaller and more homogeneous
areas and, in turn, better results can be obtained running the model.. Nevertheless, the
model could be customized to fit any region following the instructions aforementioned.
One important limitation of our model is the lack of reliable data about the actual cases
of infection, mainly asymptomatic and with mild symptoms. In the last days, only the
severe cases and suspected cases among active health care staff have been confirmed
with a test in Spain. We hope this situation can be changed in the following weeks, as
the Spanish Government is acquiring more diagnostic tests (Spanish Government,
2020).
One strength of this model is that is has been conceived open-access. We keen to
facilitate others to adapt the model to their own situation. The use of this model for an
educational purpose can be a strong tool to convince people about the importance of
adopting early social distancing approaches (Figure 7) and also to maintain them in time
(Figure 8).
We think it could be particularly convenient for researchers and health care staff in lowand middle-income countries. These regions are especially vulnerable to the pandemic.
Facing a new pathogen as CoV-2 and its dynamic represents a huge challenge for any
country, especially for those with weaker health care systems. Some Sub-Saharan
African countries have already detected more than 100 cases of COVID-19 (WHO 2020).
Although some knowledge about STELLA modeling is needed, we think that any
interested person with a light training could customize it, by adapting the basic data
(Stocks and Converters) to the region of interest and generate different scenarios. We
are now working in a video tutorial to explain the design of the model in order to facilitate
other stakeholders to modify the structure and customize parameters to their areas of
interest.
