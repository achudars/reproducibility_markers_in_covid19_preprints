Background
Loneliness and physical activity are important targets for research into the impact of COVID-19 because they
have established links with mental health, could be exacerbated by social distancing policies and are potentially
modifiable.
Method
We analysed mental health data collected during COVID-19 from adults aged 50 and over alongside comparable
annual data collected between 2015 and 2019 from the same sample. Trajectories of depression (PHQ-9) and
anxiety (GAD-7) were analysed with respect to loneliness, physical activity levels and a number of
socioeconomic and demographic characteristics using zero-inflated negative binomial regression.
Results
3,281 people completed the COVID-19 mental health questionnaire, all had at least one data point prior to 2020.
In 2020, the adjusted PHQ-9 score for loneliness was 3.2. (95% CI: 3.0-3.4), an increase of one point on
previous years and 2 points higher than people not rated lonely, whose score did not change in 2020 (1.2, 95%
CI: 1.1-1.3). PHQ-9 was 2.6 (95% CI: 2.4-2.8) in people with decreased physical activity, an increase of 0.5 on
previous years. In contrast, PHQ-9 in 2020 for people whose physical activity had not decreased was 1.7 (95%
CI: 1.6-1.8), similar to previous years. A similar relationship was observed for GAD-7 though the differences
were smaller and the absolute burden of symptoms lower.

After accounting for pre-COVID-19 trends, we show that experiencing loneliness and decreased physical
activity are risk factors for worsening mental health during the pandemic. Our findings highlight the need to
examine policies which target these potentially modifiable risk factors.

Introduction
In order to contain and reduce the spread of COVID-19, the UK government introduced lockdown measures on
23 rd March 2020 which restricted time permitted outside and all non-essential in-person contact. Those with
certain high risk medical conditions were advised to ‘shield’ (i.e. not leave the house for 12 weeks) and those
aged 70 and over were advised to strictly adhere to the restrictions. The potential mental health impacts of this
have been highlighted in a number of high profile commentaries, with possible mechanisms including the
pressures of lockdown, anxieties about infection and the knock-on economic consequences (1–7). Previous
research into mental health in the pandemic has largely focused on socioeconomic, demographic and clinical
comorbidities, with younger age, female gender and low socioeconomic status being consistently associated
with higher risk (8–11). While these links are undoubtedly important, research must also focus on potentially
modifiable risk factors.
Loneliness and physical activity are critical mediators of mental health and therefore warrant close consideration
during the pandemic (5,12,13). The pandemic may lead to low activity levels and exacerbate the relationship
between loneliness and mental health in some (for example through social distancing and movement
restrictions) and as such they may represent modifiable targets for resilience and management programmes.
Longitudinal data covering the pre-pandemic and pandemic period is needed to address this key question. Three
representatively sampled surveys (two US and one UK) of data pre and during the pandemic reported no
significant changes in loneliness but no links were drawn between the interactions with the pandemic on mental
health levels (11,14,15). One cross sectional study linked loneliness with worse mental health and a second
study indicated that people with low social support (a possible proxy for loneliness) had a more severe trajectory
of depression during the pandemic (8,16). However without data prior to 2020, it is impossible to evaluate fully
the specific importance of these factors during the pandemic, in particular whether these relationships reflect
well-established links between loneliness and mental health or whether there was a specific effect of the
pandemic. Though highlighted as important in commentaries, there has been little research into the links
between physical activity and mental health during the pandemic; to our knowledge, the only published study
used a cross sectional design (17).
To address the gap in research around the impact of loneliness and physical activity on mental health during
COVID-19 we analysed data from 3,281 participants, all of whom had mental health data available from before
the pandemic. We hypothesized that trajectories of depressive and anxiety symptoms in people who were lonely
and whose physical activity had decreased during the pandemic would be adversely affected. In addition, we
also examined a number of other demographic and socioeconomic variables on mental health trajectories.

Method
Study design and setting
The study was conducted with participants from the PROTECT study. PROTECT is a longitudinal study of
mental and cognitive health with annual assessment in people over the age of 50 which was launched in

November 2015 (http://www.protectstudy.org.uk/) (18). There are currently over 25,000 people enrolled in
PROTECT. Written informed consent was obtained online from all participants.
In May 2020, around 4.5 years after PROTECT started, a specific COVID-19 mental health questionnaire was
launched in PROTECT, again completed online. Here we present an analysis of data collected between 13th May
and 8 th June 2020, combined with existing data from previous years.
The authors assert that all procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant
national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as
revised in 2008. All procedures involving human subjects/patients were approved by the UK London Bridge
National Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 13/LO/1578) and the COVID-19 mental health questionnaire was
approved by the same committee (as an amendment) on 6th April 2020.
Participants
The PROTECT cohort includes people aged 50 or over at enrolment living in the UK. Additional inclusion
criteria are: access to a computer and internet, able to read and write English and no diagnosis of dementia. All
participants who opted in to study communications were invited to complete the COVID-19 mental health
questionnaire.
Variables
The principal outcome measure for this study was PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores (measuring depression and anxiety
respectively) record pre-pandemic (2015-2019) and during the pandemic (2020).
PROTECT pre-pandemic data collection 2015-2019
Before the pandemic, all participants completed a series of online self-report questionnaires, which included
demographic information (date of birth, gender, highest level of education [left school at 16, left school at 18,
undergraduate degree, post-graduate degree], employment status [full time, part-time, self-employed, retired,
unemployed] and marital status [married/civil partnership/co-habiting, widowed/divorced/separated, single],
history of psychiatric illness). In addition, mental health assessments were completed annually prior to the
pandemic as well as in 2020.
Depression was assessed with the PHQ-9, a 9 item questionnaire which assesses the frequency of depressive
symptoms over a two week window (19). Each item is rated on a 4 point scale (0=not at all; 1=several days;
2=more than half the days; 3= nearly every day). Anxiety was assessed with the GAD-7, a 7 item questionnaire
assessing the frequency of anxiety symptoms over a two week window (20). The ratings are the same as PHQ-9.
For both scales, a threshold of 5 or above is indicative of mild and 10 or above is indicative of moderate or
severe symptoms.
Participants completed up to four annual GAD-7 and PHQ-9 assessments spread over 5 years between 2015 and
2019 (depending on enrolment date). Enrolment to PROTECT is open continuously and started with a national
publicity drive in October and November 2015, as a result the majority of current participants enrolled in those
two months. For those who completed the COVID-19 mental health questionnaire this figure was 1,930 (59%).
After the initial wave of enrolment, 405, 382, 338 and 18 enrolled in 2016, and in 2017, 2018 and 2019

respectively. Thus, most completed annual assessments between October and January of each year. PROTECT
pre-pandemic data was available from a data-freeze in early October 2019.
Mental health during COVID-19 May 13th-June 8th 2020.
Symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Participants were asked whether they had any of the main symptoms of
COVID-19 in the last two weeks (which at the time were a new persistent cough for more than 24 hours or a
high temperature) or if they had been hospitalized with COVID-19 in the last four weeks.
Physical activity changes. Participants were asked about changes in their physical activity since March 2020.
The data were categorised to identify people who reported a decrease in their level of physical activity and those
who did not.
Physical illnesses. Participants were asked if they had any of the following conditions associated with
moderately increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus: long-term respiratory illness, chronic heart disease,
chronic kidney disease, liver disease, neurological disease, diabetes, illness affecting the spleen, weakened
immune system or BMI>=40. They were also asked if they had any of the following conditions which would
require them to shield (high risk of severe illness from coronavirus): received an organ transplant and remain on
ongoing immunosuppression medication, undergoing active chemotherapy or radiotherapy, cancer of the blood
or bone marrow who are at any stage of treatment, severe chest conditions such as cystic fibrosis or severe
asthma (requiring hospital admissions or course of steroid tablets), severe diseases of body systems. People were
also asked if they had received a letter advising them to shield and if they answered yes they were included in
the high risk group. These physical conditions were coded 0 (no relevant conditions); 1 (moderate risk
conditions) and 2 (high risk conditions).
Loneliness. Loneliness was assessed using the three item UCLA loneliness scale (21). The questions ask how
often the participant has felt lack of companionship, left out and isolated from others with the possible answers
being ‘hardly ever’, ‘some of the time’ and ‘often.’ Loneliness was treated as binary for this analysis,
dichotomized into those experiencing any loneliness (i.e. rating at least ‘some of the time’ on any question) and
those experiencing none.
Finances. Participants were asked to respond yes or no the question “Has the COVID-19 (coronavirus) had had
a negative impact on your finances?”
Statistical methods
The statistical analyses were carried out in two stages.
In the full cohort we first undertook a case level analysis of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 rated in 2020 during the
pandemic, categorizing both into a three level factor (see above for cut offs) representing no, mild and
moderate-to-severe symptoms. Differences in the proportions of current depression and anxiety levels by risk
factor were analysed using the chi-square test. We then undertook descriptive analysis of the change in case
level proportions between 2019 and 2020.
For the second and principal analysis, we examined trajectories of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 between October 2015
(the start of the PROTECT study) and 8th June 2020. Initial analysis of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 total scores using

linear mixed effects models showed evidence of departure from the assumption of normally distributed residuals
(see supplement). This could not be rectified by transformations and instead we considered models for counts of
symptoms. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression (ZINB) was chosen for each scale due to overdispersion and evidence of excess zeros. Zero inflated models use a mixture model approach in which the
population is assumed to consist of an at-risk subgroup, and a sub-group not at risk for PHQ-9 and GAD-7
symptoms during the study period (the source of the excess zeros). The model is comprised of two components:
the first accounts for the distribution of symptoms in the at-risk population (negative binomial component), the
second is a logit model accounting for factors associated with membership of the non-risk sub-population (zeroinflated component). A random intercept term was included to allow for correlations between repeated
measurements on the same individual. The Vuong test statistic was used to compare the fit of zero-inflated
models with single-equation Poisson and negative binomial models.
Univariate models were run for both PHQ-9 and GAD-7 for loneliness and physical activity, as well as the
following socioeconomic variables: age group (under 70 and 70 and over), gender, psychiatric diagnosis history,
education level, employment status, marital status, negative financial impact of the pandemic, risk medical
condition. Education, employment status and marital status were all dummy coded. A linear and quadratic term
for time since study start and a 2020 indicator variable was added to estimate the effect of the pandemic on
PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores after removing any background trend in previous years. Zero-inflated models did not
include an interaction term with 2020 (models were not significantly improved by including an interaction
term). Therefore the zero-inflated component does not tell us anything specific about the effect of 2020 so for
simplicity they are not reported here. Incidence rate ratios were calculated to illustrate the incremental effect on
PHQ-9/GAD-7 scores of each risk factor in 2020 relative those without the risk factor.
All statistically significant variables were included in a final adjusted model to assess independent effects.
Predicted values from the adjusted final model were obtained and plotted for year 0 (study start, October 2015),
1 year, 2 years, 3 years after study start, and during the pandemic (i.e. ~4.5 years after study start).
Of the 3,281 people who completed the COVID-19 mental health questionnaire in 2020, 2,238 had four
previous data points; 566 had 3; 415 had 2; and 62 had 1 (Figure 1). The distribution of assessment by month in
each year is shown in the supplement.

Results
Participants
In total, 3,281 people completed the COVID-19 mental health questionnaire, 542 of these either joined
PROTECT in May/June 2020 specifically to do the COVID-19 element or they joined PROTECT after the
October 2019 data freeze so no pre-pandemic data available for this analysis. These were excluded but there
were no major differences in characteristics between the 3,821 used in this analysis and the 542 excluded (see
supplement). The characteristics of the sample analysed are described in [Table 1. The mean age in 2020 was 67
(standard deviation 6.5, range 55-96), around one third had an undergraduate level education, 80% were female
and 98% were white (because of the very low numbers of other ethnicities, ethnicity was not considered further
in the analysis). These figures are similar to the wider 25,000 PROTECT study sample (18). Twenty-six (0.7%)
people reported having a new continuous cough or high temperature in the last two weeks, a similar proportion
(1%) reported a family member with these symptoms. One person in the sample had been hospitalized with
COVID-19 in the last four weeks.

Risk factors and trajectories
Case level analysis
In the cross sectional pandemic data, only variable not associated with higher proportions of mild and
moderated-to-severe depressive and anxiety symptoms was education level (see supplement for proportions).
Mild and moderate to severe anxiety cases were generally less common and the only variables not associated
with higher proportions of cases were education level and marital status.
We then compared case level differences in 2019 with 2020. Overall case level estimates for moderate-tosevere symptoms were comparable across the two years. One hundred and eighty-five (5.6%, 95% CI: 4.9-6.4)
and 89 (2.7% 95% CI: 2.2-3.3) of 3,281 people in 2020 had a PHQ-9 score ≥10 and a GAD-7 score ≥10
respectively. This compared with 124 (4.1%, 95% CI: 3.5-5) and 66 (2.2%, 95% CI: 1.8-2.8) respectively with
moderate-to-severe symptoms in 2019 (n=2,959). There was a more pronounced difference in mild symptoms.
In 2020 634 (19%, 95% CI: 18-20.7) has mild depressive symptoms compared with 392 (13.2%, 95% CI: 12.114.5) in 2018.

Similarly, 415 people had mild anxiety symptoms in 2020 (12.6%, 95% CI: 11.6-13.8),

compared with 276 in 2019 (9.3%, 95% CI: 8.3-10.4).

Trajectories of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores
The results from the univariate analysis are shown in supplementary data. Loneliness, decreased physical
activity, being a woman and being retired were all associated with significant worsening of depressive
symptoms in 2020. Similarly loneliness, decreased physical activity and being a woman were also associated
with worsening GAD-7 scores in 2020. Not being in full time employment was associated with a greater
worsening of GAD-7 score relative to being full time employed. Both those with a psychiatric history and those
without experienced worsening symptoms during the pandemic, but the change was relatively higher in the no

history group. The absolute GAD-7 score for people with a psychiatric diagnosis was consistently higher
throughout the entire study period.
For the final adjusted model of PHQ-9 trajectory, loneliness, activity level, gender and retirement status were all
included as covariates and for the GAD-7 adjusted model, loneliness, physical activity, gender, full time
employment status and history of psychiatric condition were included as covariates.
Results from the adjusted models are shown in Table 2 and predicted adjusted PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores for
each time point are provided in full in the supplement, plots of these predicted values for loneliness and physical
activity are shown in [Figure 2.
Loneliness:
Loneliness was associated with a 30% increase in PHQ-9 score in 2020, relative to the not lonely group
(IRR=1.3, 95% CI: 1.2-1.4, p<0.0001). Prior to 2020 people rated as lonely scored approximately one point
higher than those rated not lonely ([Figure 2).

In 2020 (4.5 years after study start), however the difference

between the two groups was ~2 points, with PHQ-9 score increasing to 3.2 (95% CI: 3.0-3.4) among those who
reported loneliness and remaining stable (1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.3) for those not reporting loneliness. In other
words, about 50% of the difference in PHQ-9 score between loneliness and no loneliness during the pandemic
was accounted for by the general higher burden of symptoms associated with being lonely. For context, this
means that in 2020 people who were lonely reported either a new PHQ-9 symptom for several days of the last
two weeks or a worsening of an existing symptom to more than half the days in the last two weeks.
For GAD-7, symptoms were 20% worse in those who rated as lonely (IRR=1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.4, p<0.0001).
Among those with no loneliness, GAD-7 total score was 0.5 across all years (Error! Reference source not
found.). For those with loneliness, GAD-7 score was 0.5 higher (~1) in years prior to 2020 but in 2020 the
score increased to 1.6 (95% CI: 1.5-1.7). Again, the pandemic accounted for around 50% of the difference in
GAD-7 scores attributable to loneliness in 2020.
Physical activity:
Decreased physical activity during the pandemic was associated with a 20% increase in PHQ-9 and GAD-7
symptoms during 2020 (IRR=1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.2, p<0.0001 and IRR=1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.3, p<0.0001
respectively). The general trajectory of PHQ-9 and the difference in scores between those reporting a decreased
in physical activity, and those not, was similar to loneliness, although the difference was smaller ([Figure 2).
That is, there was around a 0.5 point difference in the years prior to 2020 and 1 point difference in 2020
(decreased physical activity: 2.6, 95% CI: 2.4-2.8, no decrease: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.6-1.8). Similar to loneliness
again, GAD-7 score was modestly higher for people with decreased physical activity in the years prior to 2020
(Figure 2). However in 2020, GAD-7 score increased to 1.2 (95% CI 1.1-1.3) among those reporting decreased
physical activity, which compares with 0.9 for those with no decrease in physical activity (95% CI: 0.8-0.9).
Gender, employment status and psychiatric history:
Being a woman and being retired were both also associated with worsening PHQ-9 symptoms during 2020
(IRR=1.1, 95% CI: 1.0-1.2, p=0.004; IRR=1.1, 95% CI: 1.0-1.2, p=0.001). Similarly, being a woman was also

associated with worse GAD-7 scores in 2020 (IRR=1.2, 95% CI: 1.0-1.3, p=0.03). Having a history of a
psychiatric condition was associated with a relatively lower score in 2020 (IRR=0.8, 95% CI: 0.8 - 0.9,
p=0.0002). However, this was driven by an increase in mental health symptoms in those with a history of
psychiatric diagnosis. The absolute levels GAD-7 score for people with a psychiatric history remained higher in
2020 than those without (1.44 [95% CI: 1.3-1.59] vs 0.69 [95% CI: 0.63-0.75], see supplement).

The

association between full time employment and improved mental health identified in the univariate analysis did
not hold in the adjusted analysis (Table 2).

Discussion
This is the first longitudinal study to focus specifically on the links between loneliness, physical activity and
mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic with longitudinal data pertaining to pre-pandemic mental health.
Overall, in a cohort aged between 55 and 96, there was an increase in the proportion of people with mild
depressive symptoms from 13.2% in 2019 to 19% in 2020 and an increase in the proportion of people with mild
anxiety symptoms (from 9.3% to 12.6%). Proportions of people with moderate-to-severe symptoms were
comparable. Longitudinally, both loneliness and decreased physical activity were associated with worse mental
health in 2020 compared to previous years, suggesting that the association observed in 2020 was not due to a
longer standing relationship between current loneliness and physical activity and mental health before 2020. Our
data also show that the impact of the pandemic on mental health would be overestimated without the
longitudinal perspective, bringing new insight to these established mental health risk factors and in line with
recent findings related to other risk factors (22).
Around half of the sample reported some degree of loneliness during the pandemic. Loneliness during the
pandemic was associated with a 1 point higher score on the PHQ-9 between 2015 and 2019 compared to people
who did not report loneliness, but this difference doubled to 2 points during the pandemic. In contrast, there was
no worsening of mental health symptoms for people who did not report loneliness. Over one third of the sample
reported decreased physical activity during the pandemic. The effect on PHQ-9 scores was more modest that of
loneliness but was nevertheless associated with a worsening of symptoms during the pandemic. There were also
statistically significant increases in GAD-7 scores for both loneliness and decreased physical activity though the
differences were smaller than for PHQ-9 scores. Collectively, these findings emphasise the potential impact of
finding novel solutions to tackle loneliness and decreased physical activity during the pandemic and underscore
the important general relationship between the two and mental health (13,16,23).
Of the socioeconomic and demographic variables analysed, both being a woman and being retired were
associated with pandemic-specific worsening in mental health, in line with previous UK representatively
sampled studies (9,24). While our data do not show any increase in mental health symptoms related to other

socioeconomic factors specifically associated with the pandemic (e.g. rating that the pandemic had a negative
financial impact or employment status) we believe it would be premature to rule out an effect, firstly because the
economic impact of the pandemic has not yet fully taken hold and secondly because we note other large
representative surveys have reported clear links (8,9). Finally, similar to other studies we found no evidence
that having a medical condition associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19 was associated with
worsening symptoms of depression and anxiety (9).
Limitations
One important limitation is the potential for bias in an on-line self-selecting sample. In particular we note the
overrepresentation of women, white British people and those with a higher education, however because our
analysis is focused on longitudinal patterns rather than prevalence there is still merit in identifying these trends
within this sample. A second limitation is determining causation, a pervasive issue observational studies.
Because the loneliness and physical activity questions were only taken during the pandemic it may be the case
that worse mental health drove a decrease in physical activity and increase in loneliness. The wider literature
has highlighted a causal relationship between higher physical activity levels and lower risk for major depressive
disorder (but no causal relationship for the reverse) so in the context of this evidence it would be reasonable to
hypothesise that maintaining physical activity during the pandemic may mitigate risk of mental health
deterioration (25). A large randomised control trial would be needed to assess this but our findings pave the
way for robust intervention testing. We are not aware of any studies which have conclusively shown a causal
directional link between loneliness and mental health but the well-established link between the two is one of the
reasons why loneliness is a critical policy area in the UK and internationally. Here we are able to show that for
the first time that the association between loneliness and worse mental health is not solely due to those who are
currently lonely having long-standing worse mental health; there is a specific effect of 2020 in this sample
which is an important advance over previous cross sectional studies.
In conclusion, in this large longitudinally studied sample exploring mental health effects of the COVID-19
pandemic in middle aged and older people in the UK, we found that loneliness and decreased physical activity
were both associated with worse mental health during the pandemic and that this was distinct from the general
relationship between these two risk factors and poor mental health. Our study provides robust evidence in
support of targeted interventions to improve mental health of people in mid to late life in the subsequent waves
of the pandemic.
