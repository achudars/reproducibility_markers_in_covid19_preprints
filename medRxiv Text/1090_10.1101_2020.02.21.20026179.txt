Abstract

We tested samples collected from nine patients diagnosed with coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus was found in urine, blood, anal swabs and
oropharyngeal swabs. It is the first time for SARS-CoV-2 found in urine, though no
urinary irritation was found.

Introduction
2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection outbroke and spread to the
world from 2019. By January 28, 2020, a total of 4593 global confirmed cases, of
which 4537 were from China, had been reported(1). On January 30, 2020,
SARS-CoV-2 infection was declared as a global health emergency by World Health
Organization (WHO). The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection and organ invasion
are unclear, which directly leads to difficulties and blindness in clinical diagnosis and
treatment. We aim to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from urine, blood, anal swab
and oropharyngeal swab samples. We hope to provide evidences of the multiple organ
invasion of the virus and figure out its relation with clinical manifestations.

Methods
Nine patients confirmed diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection(2) were included
in this prospective study. Urine, blood, anal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs from

enrolled patients were obtained and detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA level by quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Patients’ demographic data and
clinical characteristics were recorded. This study was approved by the institutional
review board (IRB) of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. All
patients voluntarily signed an informed consent form approved by the IRB before
participation.

Results
Patient 7, a 31 years old female without any urinary irritation, had positive
results of SARS-CoV-2 in both urine and oropharyngeal swab on the 7th day after
symptom onset. Patient 1 and 5 had negative results in oropharyngeal swab, on the
10th and 15th day after onset. Patient 8 had three positive results in blood, anal swab
and oropharyngeal swab on the 3rd day after onset. Viral load was roughly higher in
anal swab than oropharyngeal swab in patient 9 (Table).

Eight of nine patients had an obvious history of epidemiological exposure
to SARS-CoV-2. All patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms were cough,
sore throat, fatigue and diarrhea. Four patients had a lymphopenia. Elevated
C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were found in 6 and 5 cases
respectively. All patients had normal serum levels of procalcitonin, alanine
transaminase, creatinine, myocardial enzyme and arterial partial oxygen pressure.

Discussion

The pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection is still unclear. Current
evidences indicate that it can invade multiple organ systems, including the respiratory
system, digestive system and hematological system(3-5). But whether it can invade
the urinary system has not been reported. In our study, urine, blood, anal swab and
oropharyngeal swab from 9 patients were retested by qRT-PCR. It is the first time for
the SARS-CoV-2 found in urine, though no urinary irritation was found. In addition,
the quantity of the virus in the anal swab was closer to that of the oropharyngeal test,
and those in the blood and urine were less than that of the oropharyngeal test,
indicating that the "clearing effect" of the digestive tract on the virus is not obvious.
Nevertheless, the relative symptoms, including diarrhea and urinary irritation did not
happen to every patient with virus in anal swab and urine specimens. All samples
were negative at the earliest time of the 10th day after onset in that mild patient.
Therefore, we believed that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the urinary system,
hematological system and digestive system other than the respiratory system, not
always with relative symptoms. Mild patients can be self-limiting. This will prompt
clinicians to pay attention to the clinical manifestations of multiple systems, even if
the corresponding clinical symptoms do not appear. In addition, it is necessary to
carry out multiple examinations of various specimens to assess changes in disease and
prognosis.
