Abstract
The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is of global concern and has
recently emerged in the US. In this paper, we construct a stochastic variant of the SEIR model to
make a quasi-worst-case scenario prediction of the COVID-19 outbreak in the US West and East
Coasts. The model is then fitted to current data and implemented using Runge-Kutta methods. Our
computation results predict that the number of new cases would peak around mid-April 2000 and
begin to abate by July, and that the number of cases of COVID-19 might be significantly mitigated
by having greater numbers of functional testing kits available for screening. The model also
showed how small changes in variables can make large differences in outcomes and highlights the
importance of healthcare preparedness during pandemics.

Author Summary
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has escalated into a global pandemic and has recently
emerged in the US. While some countries have managed to contain COVID-19 efficiently, other
countries previously thought to have been well-prepared for outbreaks due to higher living
standards and healthcare quality have witnessed an unexpected number of cases. It is currently
unclear how the US can cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, especially after mishaps during the
initial stages. Our study combines conditions unique to the US and transmission dynamics in
regions affected most by COVID-19 to produce a quasi-worse-case scenario of COVID-19 in the
US and shows the importance of healthcare preparedness during pandemics.

Introduction
Coronaviruses (CoVs) comprise a family of enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses that are
known to infect a broad range of animals ranging across mammals and birds. CoVs have been
prevalent worldwide for several decades [8, 26] and cause diseases generally associated with the
respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and nervous systems. To date, there are seven CoVs that are
known to infect humans and are associated with respiratory symptoms. Four CoVs (HCoV-229E,
HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HKU1) present relatively mild respiratory tract infections [26],
whereas the other three CoVs, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (SARSCoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the novel
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are considerably more virulent
and have caused outbreaks with pandemic potential. They are responsible respectively for the
2002-2003 SARS outbreak [6, 15], the 2012 MERS outbreak [36], and the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic [37]. As CoVs have a global distribution, exhibit considerable genetic diversity and
genomic recombination, and have zoonotic potential while sympatry between humans and wildlife
increase [5, 26], it is very likely that there will be new CoV outbreaks in the future.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (previously 2019-nCoV) originated from Wuhan city
in Hubei province of China [37]. While the first case was reported in December 2019, it has since
been thought to emerge as early as November 2019 [25]. Since then, COVID-19 has continued to
spread around the world, and at this date, over 150 countries have been affected [3]. Although
some countries have managed to contain COVID-19 efficiently, others previously thought to have
been well-prepared for outbreaks due to higher living standards and healthcare quality have
witnessed an unexpected number of cases [24]. As a result, the scale of COVID-19 within each
nation has become relatively uncertain and has only heightened social and economic unrest.

COVID-19 was first reported in the US on January 20, 2020 [11]. While little initial action
was taken during the initial days, an exponential increase in the number of cases [24] spurred
immediate actions in an attempt to contain COVID-19. For instance, social distancing is being
enforced via the closure of educational institutions, restrictions on travel, and suspension of events,
and research funding for SARS-CoV- 2 has increased. Unfortunately, containment of COVID-19
has been hindered by various factors, such as the initial production of defective test kits [27], a
current limited availability of test kits [28, 29], and lack of medical supplies [30, 31]. It is currently
unclear how well the US healthcare system will cope with the COVID-19 pandemic over the next
few months, especially in view of the lack of adequate projections of the scale of COVID-19
infections and mortality across the country.
In this paper, we attempt to construct a mathematical model that simulates the scale of
COVID-19 outbreak in the US. Despite the uncertainty of the pathogenicity and molecular
virology of SARS-CoV-2 [23], a few key features pertaining to its transmissibility have been
studied. The basic reproduction number ùëÖ0 , which represents the average number of new
infections an infectious person can cause in a na√Øve population, generally range from 2.3 to 2.9
[22, 33, 38]. The incubation period (the time between initial exposure and development of
symptoms) is approximately 5.2 days on average [16, 19], and the infectious period (the time from
onset of symptoms to isolation) is approximately 3 days on average [20, 21]. These transmission
features are useful parameters to consider for modeling, which we will describe in detail next.

Methods: Designing the Model
To model the COVID-19 outbreak, we use a variant of the SEIR model (see [7, 18] for some
examples). We mainly focus on the East and West Coast of the United States. We assume that
there is no travel between the different population zones, and that the natural birth and death rates
are equal.
Figure 1 depicts the basis of our model, focusing on a particular coast, where arrows
indicate the flow of the population at different stages.

Figure 1: A diagram summarizing our modified SEIR model for each coast.
In Figure 1, S represents the susceptible population, and E represents the exposed
population (i.e. individuals who have been infected but are not yet themselves infectious). The
infected population I divided into two groups, ùêºùêª and ùêºùê∂ , wherein the subscripts H and C stand for
‚Äúhospital‚Äù and ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù respectively. ùêºùêª represents those that are infected and isolated (such
as those that have been pre-tested and found to carry the virus), and ùêºùê∂ for those that are infected
but not isolated (such as those with unreported cases or present mild symptoms that are
overlooked). Thus, people in ùêºùêª is unable to spread the virus whereas those in ùêºùê∂ can spread the
virus. As testing kits in the US are currently in low supply, the current model projects significantly
higher levels of ùêºùê∂ than ùêºùêª at any given point in time. Once infected, there are two possibilities:
either recovery or death. These outcomes are represented by the populations R and D above, with

subscripts as designated above. We also assume the recovered population will have acquired
immunity to the virus and are no longer susceptible.
In the mathematical model underlying Figure 1, we treat the various symbols above as
functions over time, and the precise variables for ordinary differential equations are as follows.

ùõæ
ùëÖ0

The reciprocal of the incubation period
The reciprocal of the infectious period
The basic reproduction rate, defined to be the value ùõΩ/ùõæ

The expression ùëÅ = ùëÜ + ùê∏ + ùêºùêª + ùêºùê∂ + ùëÖùêª + ùëÖùê∂ represents the effective total population
in the US, i.e. the population that matters for the purposes of virus transmission. Then, for each
coast in the US, the discussion above can be mathematically modeled as follows.

Notice that ùëÖ0 is not present in the model above. However, ùëÖ0 is important as the contact
rate is hard to directly estimate, and we will use ùëÖ0 and ùõæ to estimate ùõΩ using the relation ùõΩ = ùëÖ0 ùõæ.
The basic reproduction rate is also not static over time, and we will use different values over the
following three phases:
‚Ä¢

Phase 1: There is no action done on the epidemic

‚Ä¢

Phase 2: Some action is done to slow down the epidemic, and the coast is preparing for the
next phase.

Phase 3: Coast shutdown; schools moved online, events canceled, and most public areas closed.
To prepare for a quasi-worst-case-scenario, we assume ùëÖ 0 ‚â• 1. This is because ùëÖ0 = 1

represents a neutral reproduction rate, whereas ùëÖ0 < 1 and ùëÖ0 > 1 represents less and more
spread, respectively. The next section describes in detail how we simulate our model.

Methods: Implementing the Model
We simulated our model in MATLAB to prepare for a quasi-worst-case-scenario. We employed a
fourth-order Runge-Kutta method [12] to numerically solve the above specified ordinary
1

differential equations, with the range ùë° ‚àà [0, 250] and stepsize ‚Ñé = 3 (both measured in days). As
for the initial conditions for each coast, we assume that there will not be any pre-existing immune
responses that may help defend against the virus, due to SARS-CoV-2 being sufficiently divergent
from other CoVs [23]. Hence, the entire population is initially susceptible due to the virus. For
example, if a single infected person is introduced at ùë°0 = 0 to a population of 53 million people
(e.g. West Coast US, including Seattle), we will then have ùëÜ(ùë°0 ) = 53 ‚àó 106 , ùêºùëê (ùë°0 ) = 1, and
ùê∏(ùë°0 ) = ùêºùêª (ùë°0 ) = ùê∑ùêª (ùë°0 ) = ùê∑ùê∂ (ùë°0 ) = ùëÖùêª (ùë°0 ) = ùëÖùê∂ (ùë°0 ) = 0.
We estimate the proportion of pre-tested exposed individuals œÅ is set to be 0.1, and the
mortality rate c is set to be 0.05 [2, 35]. The basic reproduction rate ùëÖ0 is specified based on the
government response to the outbreak (the three phases); for instance, if a partial shutdown is
implemented at time ùë°1 , and then a full shutdown at ùë°2 , we will have 1 ‚â§ ùëÖ0 (ùë°2 ‚â§ ùë° ‚â§ 250) ‚â§
ùëÖ0 (ùë°1 ‚â§ ùë° ‚â§ ùë°2 ) ‚â§ ùëÖ0 (0 ‚â§ ùë° ‚â§ ùë°1 ) . In our case, using the estimates obtained in [21] and
depending on the coast being studied, we set the first phase ùëÖ0 (0 ‚â§ ùë° ‚â§ ùë°1 ) to be either 2.7 or 2.9,
the second phase ùëÖ0 (ùë°1 ‚â§ ùë° ‚â§ ùë°2 ) to be either 2.3 or 2.5, and the third phase ùëÖ0 (ùë°2 ‚â§ ùë° ‚â§ 250) =

1. The West Coast will take the lower of the two values to account for the lower average population
density.
To account for the variations of incubation period ùõº ‚àí1 and infectious period ùõæ ‚àí1 within
the population, we sampled 100 values of each of them from an Erlang distribution of shape 2 [21]
at each timestep ùë°ùëñ . Let us denote these 100 values as ùõºùëò‚àí1 (ùë°ùëñ ) and ùõæùëò‚àí1 (ùë°ùëñ ), where ùëò = 1, ‚Ä¶ , 100.
The Erlang distribution for which we sampled ùõº ‚àí1 from has a mean set to be 5.2 days, and for ùõæ ‚àí1,
3 days, as suggested by [16, 19, 20]. The minimum of the distribution range is also restricted to be
1, i.e. minimum possible incubation period is 1 day. Correspondingly, we will have 100 values of
the contact rate ùõΩ for at timestep, ùõΩùëò (ùë°ùëñ ) = ùëÖ0 (ùë°ùëñ )ùõæùëò (ùë°ùëñ ). We then performed 100 iterations of the
fourth-order Runge-Kutta for each of these ùõºùëò , ùõΩùëò , and ùõæùëò to obtain 100 values for the next
timestep, ùë°ùëñ+1 . Finally, the mean of these 100 values at ùë°ùëñ+1 was taken. It is also important to note
that at every iteration, the effective total population ùëÅ should be updated.
In summary, our chosen values are organized in the following table.

Results
Using elements outlined in the previous sections to model the situation for the West Coast, East
Coast, as well as the entire US, we ran 50 simulations using the model described in the previous
section. We then compared our simulation results to current data between January 20 and March
19 [2, 13], assuming a delay in reporting time of about 8 to 10 days and using population estimates
derived from [4].

The West Coast
The first case of COVID-19 in the West Coast was reported on January 20, 2020 in Seattle, WA.
We used a population estimate of 53 million. If January 20 is designated Day 0, we assume Phase
2 started at around Day 45, and Phase 3 started at around Day 60. The simulation results suggest
that, under quasi-worst-case-scenario, the data for the number of people infected by COVID-19 is
far more than reported: about 80% of ùêºùê∂ (those infected but not isolated) are not accounted for.

(Fig. 3).

The East Coast
The first case of COVID-19 in the East Coast was reported on February 1, 2020 in Boston, MA.
However, since no other new cases were reported for about two weeks, we assume a starting time
of one month later than for the West Coast. In the graphs below, we will still plot them starting
from the first reported case in the US (i.e. January 20). For the East Coast, we used a population
estimate of 152 million. Based on government actions, we also assume that the starting dates for
Phases 2 and 3 are about a week behind that of the West Coast. The simulation results are similar
to that of the West Coast; for a quasi-worst-case scenario, the actual number of infections is
predicted to be about 400,000 for reported (Fig. 4), and about 1,450,000 for the actual number of
infections (Fig. 5).

The United States: Hypothetical 25% Infected Worse-Case Scenario
As COVID-19 has escalated into a pandemic, we also considered that a greater number of people
would fall ill due to the lack of prior immunity. Considering the previous pandemic, the 2009
Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic where around 24% of people were infected [14], as well as the nonstatic nature of our variables, we ran another simulation on the entire US population with
approximately 22% to 26% of the population infected (based on randomness) to predict such a
scenario. For this simulation experiment, we used values for and starting days of the phases that
was a rough weighted estimate of the two coasts, but used the same values for the other variables
as described in the previous section. We also assumed five infected individuals were introduced
into the population.
As Fig. 6 illustrates, in this quasi-worst-case-scenario, about 3.8 million of the US
population would die from COVID-19 (assuming a death rate of 5%), and the remaining 76.2
million would recover from the virus.

hypothetical scenario where around 25% of the US will be infected. The left figure shows the
estimated number of infected people over time, and the right figure estimates the cumulative
number of deaths by considering a constant 5% mortality at each unit time.

Discussion
This paper presents a model for simulating the scale of COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.
The simulations focused on the West and East Coasts (Figs. 2-5), and also modeled a hypothetical
worst-case scenario for the entire US (Fig. 6). The model implemented factors specific to the US,
which include the three phases of government response, travel restrictions that restrict crossboundary transmissions, and limits to testing kits and healthcare accessibility resulting in semistrict isolation.
The model fits the reported data by assuming that about 80% of the non-isolated cases are
not reported (Figs. 2, 4); however, the actual number of cases may be much higher (Figs. 3, 5).
That assumption agrees with a prior study [17] and provides another evidence that COVID-19 is
not easy to contain. The model also predicts that the peak of the outbreak would occur by early
April, and the outbreak would wind down by the start of July. However, the model does not account
for delays in reporting; as such, one should expect the peak reported number of infections to occur

around mid-April. In addition, the peak would occur sooner on the West Coast, which was affected
first. However, all peaks should occur around mid-April unless there are major changes to the
reproduction rates, for which there is no current evidence. It should be noted that the trends in the
model‚Äôs estimates share similarities with the epidemic curves during the SARS and MERS
outbreaks [32, 34].
One way to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 is to successfully isolate more infected
people, i.e. to have a higher relative proportion of ùêºùêª over ùêºùê∂ . That outcome should be achieved
when defective testing kits are replaced and more testing kits are allocated, so that more exposed
people can be tested and isolated accordingly. For instance, if 50% more people had been tested
(ùúå = 0.15) since the start of the outbreak, the model would predict 40% of the projected severity
(Figs. 7, 8). As the US faced mishaps in the allocation of testing kits during the initial handling of
COVID-19, the original peak is likely inevitable. Testing more people from this point onwards (i.e.
late March) would accelerate the cool down; a simulation for ùúå = 0.3 is shown in Figs. 9, 10.
Additional ways to mitigate the mortality of COVID-19 include improving accessibility to
healthcare and boosting quantities of essential supplies such as respirators and ventilators.
However, the sudden onset of COVID-19 and the overall unpreparedness of the United States
make these data inaccessible. It should also be noted that while the global mortality during
COVID-19 is currently 3.8%, it is noticeably different across nations [24]. As a result, we chose a
5% mortality rate (ùëê = 0.05) in our quasi-worst-case scenario prediction of COVID-19 in the US.
Other factors at a molecular level can further modulate our variables. For instance, the
actual ùëÖ0 in the US might be different as the transmissibility and infectivity of CoVs have been
shown to be modulated by abiotic factors such as temperature and humidity [1], and the robustness
of host immunity further affects the etiology, pathogenesis, and overall virulence of CoVs [9]. As

a result, our paper used numbers from prior studies that are based on other countries hit relatively
hard by COVID-19 such as China, South Korea, and Italy, and enables us to successfully construct
a quasi-worst-case model of COVID-19 in the US.
We are mindful that computational simulations are, by their very nature, approximations.
There are currently no predictive models that satisfactorily produce a picture of the spread or
clinical impact of the disease as too many variables can affect the spread of a disease, especially
for pandemics like COVID-19. Moreover, simulations can vary noticeably with small variations
in assumptions and parameters. To cite one example, minor changes in the distribution of the
infected population ùêº between ùêºùêª and ùêºùê∂ can dramatically affect the model‚Äôs predictions. Also, at
the societal level, the length of time that the cohort of patients remain hospitalized is often
unknown in the early stages of a pandemic, and can greatly influence the use and deployment of
medical supplies and personnel, thus altering the course of the infection and recovery rates.
Nevertheless, the few scenarios presented and discussed in this paper strongly suggest that even
with current containment and mitigation efforts, the COVID-19 outbreak will significantly impact
the health of the US population.

Figure 10: Comparison of COVID-19 outbreak with 3X number of people tested starting late
March (solid) versus the current situation (transparent) by considering only the infected that
are reported (ùêºùëÖ = ùêºùêª + 0.2ùêºùê∂ ). The left and right figures show the West and East Coasts,
respectively. Note that more reported cases are initially observed than originally projected because
testing many more people shifts potentially unreported ùêºùê∂ to the ùêºùêª cohort. Two peaks are observed
for the West Coast: the original peak is projected have already passed, and implementing 3X more
tests will result in another peak of reported infections.
