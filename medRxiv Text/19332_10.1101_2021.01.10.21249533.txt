ABSTRACT

41

Rationale

42

Aerosol dispersion under various oxygen delivery modalities, including high flow nasal

43

cannula, is a critical concern for healthcare workers who treat acute hypoxemic respiratory

44

failure during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Effects of surgical masks on droplet

45

and aerosol dispersion under oxygen delivery modalities are not yet clarified.

46

Objectives

47

To visualize and quantify dispersion particles under various oxygen delivery modalities and

48

examine the protective effect of surgical masks on particle dispersion.

49

Methods

50

Three and five healthy men were enrolled for video recording and quantification of particles,

51

respectively. Various oxygen delivery modalities including high flow nasal cannula were

52

used in this study. Particle dispersions during rest breathing, speaking, and coughing were

53

recorded and automatically counted in each condition and were evaluated with or without

54

surgical masks.

55

Measurements and Main Results

56

Coughing led to the maximum amount and distance of particle dispersion, regardless of

57

modalities. Droplet dispersion was not visually increased by oxygen delivery modalities

58

compared to breathing at room air. With surgical masks over the nasal cannula or high-flow

59

nasal cannula, droplet dispersion was barely visible. Oxygen modalities did not increase the

60

particle dispersion counts regardless of breathing pattens. Wearing surgical masks

61

significantly decreased particle dispersion in all modalities while speaking and coughing,

62

regardless of particle sizes, and reduction rates were approximately 95 and 80-90 % for larger

63

(> 5 μm) and smaller (> 0.5 μm) particles, respectively.

64

Conclusions

65

Surgical mask over high flow nasal canula may be safely used for acute hypoxemic

66

respiratory failure including coronavirus disease 2019 patients.

INTRODUCTION

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes

76

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), transmits by droplets and bioaerosols from

77

COVID-19 patients (1). Based on the initial reports on the COVID-19 pandemic, around

78

5–30% of COVID-19 patients develop severe respiratory distress and require intensive care

79

unit admission to receive advanced respiratory support in terms of oxygen therapy and

80

non-invasive and invasive ventilatory support (2). High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a

81

non-invasive oxygen delivery system that allows for administration of humidified air-oxygen

82

blends as high as 60 L/min and a titratable fraction of inspired oxygen as high as 100%.

83

Recent studies found that HFNC use in the management of respiratory failure caused by

84

COVID-19 was associated with a reduced rate of invasive mechanical ventilation (3, 4).

85

However, resources, including ventilators, as well as manpower of healthcare workers, during

86

the COVID-19 pandemic are limited. Some patients with chronic hypoxemic respiratory

87

insufficiency need palliative respiratory care, and some bedridden elderly patients do not

88

wish to be intubated. Therefore, it is important to wisely utilize non-invasive respiratory care,

89

including HFNC, for both patients and healthcare workers.

90

HFNC and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) have been categorized as

91

aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) (5) based on the hypothesis that the high-velocity gas

92

flow may promote aerosolization of patients' secretions containing viable viruses, which may

93

then be dispersed in the environment and be inhaled by healthcare workers, thereby resulting

94

in nosocomial infection during COVID-19 respiratory care (6). Therefore, evaluation of

95

particle dispersion under these AGP-associated respiratory supports is critical for effective

96

and safe treatment in severe COVID-19 patients. Some simulation studies showed that HFNC

97

increased the dispersion amount and distance of large droplets (7, 8) and aerosols (9), while

98

other clinical environmental studies found no significant increase in dispersed microbes (10)

99

or aerosols (11) by HFNC. These findings indicate that the effects of HFNC on the dispersion

100

of droplets and aerosols are controversial.

101

Notably, a study using coronavirus other than SARS-CoV-2 indicates that surgical masks

102

reduce the number of droplets, aerosols, and viruses in the exhaled breath (12); however, no

103

studies have investigated whether surgical masks prevent generation of droplets or small

104

particles under respiratory management. Accordingly, this study aimed to visualize and

105

quantify the particles generated from the human respiratory tract exposed to HFNC and other

oxygen delivery modalities. Additionally, the effects of surgical masks on particle dispersion

107

under oxygen delivery modalities were also investigated.

108

METHODS

109

Participants

±

110

Three and five healthy men (average height and weight: 173.6 ( 7.4) cm and 68.6

±5.6) kg, respectively) were voluntarily recruited for video recording and quantitative

111

(

112

analysis of droplets, respectively. Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) age ≥ 20 years; 2) no

113

respiratory or systemic symptoms for 14 days before the experiments; and 3) no contact

114

history with COVID-19 patients. Written informed consent was obtained from all the

115

participants. All the staffs worked for these experiments wore the appropriate personal

116

protective equipment including N95 mask and eye goggles inside the room. This study

117

protocol was approved by the Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences

118

Research Ethics Committee (Approval number: 20092503).

Visualization of droplet dispersion

120

In the visualization experiment, four different oxygen delivery modes, including

121

nasal canula at 5 L/min (non-humidified, Nakamura Medical Industry Co., Ltd.), simple

122

oxygen mask at 10 L/min (non-humidified, Nakamura Medical Industry Co., Ltd.), HFNC at

123

60 L/min (humidified, AIRVO2/Opti flow+, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare), and NPPV with an

124

inspiratory positive airway pressure/expiratory positive airway pressure of 10/4 cm H2O at

125

FiO2 of 21% (humidified, Philips Respironics V60/Amara Gel full face mask) were used.

126

Particle dispersion under room air, nasal cannula, and HFNC and the dispersion patterns with

127

or without surgical masks were recorded in the sitting position. Three breathing patterns,

128

including rest breathing, 3 sets of speaking of sound (ta-chi-tsu-te-to and pa-pi-pu-pe-po), and

129

3 sets of coughing, were recorded in three participants. Generalized droplets from mouths

130

were flashed continuously by Parallel Eye D (Shin Nippon Air Technologies). Scattering

131

light from droplets was recorded by a super high-sensitive camera (Eye Scope, Shin Nippon

132

Air Technologies) and analyzed by Image processing software (particle eye viewer, Shin

133

Nippon Air Technologies). The recording area was 1 meter from participants' mouths. The

136

For quantitative evaluation, the droplet dispersion under four conditions including

137

room air, nasal canula at 5 L/min, and HFNC at 30 L/min or 60 L/min (humidified) and two

138

patterns for each condition with or without surgical masks were measured. Also, the

140

speaking of sound (ta-chi-tsu-te-to and pa-pi-pu-pe-po), and 5 sets of coughing, were

141

measured in five participants. Particles dispersed from participants' mouths were recorded as

142

described above and counted by the Fine Particle Visualization System (Type-S, Shin Nippon

143

Air Technologies) with a 1/30 sec speed, which was located in two linear columns at 25-45

144

and 60-80 cm from the mouth, respectively (Supplement Figure 1). Particles sized > 5 µm

145

and > 0.5 µm were automatically counted independently. The study was performed in an

146

air-controlled room with a down-flow of 0.3 m/sec from the air supply system. The room

147

temperature and humidity were maintained at 27

148

movies were blinded to participants during both experiments, and participants had a 10 ml of

149

water to keep the oral cavity hydrated between each experiment condition.

157

Individual differences were observed in the amounts of droplets; however, three participants

158

showed similar trends at each condition. The accumulated droplet (> 5 μm) dispersion in a

159

representative participant is shown in Figure 1, and movies are shown in Supplemental videos.

160

In the room air, droplet particles were barely visible at rest breathing but were observed while

161

speaking and coughing. Some droplets reached over 60 and 100 cm from mouths while

162

speaking and coughing. While coughing, visible particles had the largest amounts, the

163

farthest distance, and the largest size. Visible droplet dispersion was neither increased nor

164

farther reached among oxygen delivery modalities. Notably, by wearing a surgical mask over

165

the nasal cannula or HFNC, droplet dispersion was barely visible, even while speaking and

166

coughing.

167

With the simple oxygen mask of 10 L/min, small amounts of visible droplets floated from

168

the slit between the oxygen mask and face while coughing. With the NPPV mode, droplets

169

were visible through the expiration port of full-face NPPV masks and floated beyond the

170

distance of 50 cm. These findings were observed in two of the three participants (Figure 1

171

and Supplement Figure 2 and 3).

Quantitative evaluation of droplet dispersion under various oxygen delivery modalities

173

The quantification results of droplet and aerosol dispersion are shown in Figure 2.

174

Droplet dispersion counts at coughing without surgical masks showed a 1-log increase

175

compared to those at speaking and more than a 2-log increase compared to those at rest

176

breathing. At rest breathing, particle counts were not different among all oxygen delivery

177

modalities with surgical mask usage. Counts of droplets (> 5 μm) and smaller particles

178

including aerosols (> 0.5 μm) were not different under nasal canula or HFNC and room air

179

while speaking and coughing. Furthermore, the increased flow rate of HFNC (from 30 L/min

180

to 60 L/min) did not affect the particle counts in each pattern, even while coughing.

181

We examined the reduction ratios of wearing surgical masks in the particle count of

182

each size under each oxygen delivery modality at each breathing pattern (Table 1). As a result,

183

at speaking and coughing under the nasal cannula or the HFNC, we observed decreases in the

184

particle counts by wearing surgical masks (P < 0.05, the t-test for the null-difference within a

185

participant between the usage of the surgical mask.). At speaking and coughing, reduction

186

ratios of particle dispersion by wearing surgical masks were approximately 95% and 80-90%

187

in droplets (> 5 μm) and smaller particles including aerosols (> 0.5 μm), respectively (Table

188

1). Interestingly, reduction efficacy of dispersion by surgical masks tended to be higher under

189

NHFC than under nasal cannula while speaking.

190

In terms of dispersion distance of droplets and aerosols, the number of particles

191

obtained from two separate counters is shown in Figure 3. Dispersion distance of droplets (>

192

5 μm) and smaller particles including aerosols (> 0.5 μm) decreased at the far side compared

193

to the near side. Smaller particles including aerosols (> 0.5 μm) obviously decreased at the far

194

side compared to the near side while speaking; however, they remained at the far side while

195

coughing. Surgical masks effectively reduced aerosol dispersion, even while coughing.

196

Compared to nasal cannula, HFNC did not increase aerosol dispersion in the near or far side.

197

Moreover, the flow rate of 60 L/min did not increase aerosol dispersion compared to that of

198

30 L/min in the near or far side.

199

DISCUSSION

200

In this study, we performed two experiments in different oxygen delivery modes and

201

modalities. Based on the particle visualization study, we found that visible droplets reached

202

60–80 cm while speaking and 1 m while coughing in a sitting position; the findings are

203

similar to those in a recent study (13). In addition, these findings support results in a

204

systematic meta-analysis, which showed that a physical distance of 1 m or more is optimum

205

to reduce person-to-person virus transmission and to keep healthcare workers from

206

contracting the SARS-CoV-2 infection (14). Surgical masks obviously reduced visible

207

droplets in our study; these findings in photos and videos confirm the effect of surgical masks

208

on transmission of viral particles in society and in hospitals caring for oxygen-delivered

209

patients during the pandemic. Based on our quantification study, the majority of particles

210

produced by the HFNC mode were smaller particles or aerosols; the finding is supported by a

211

previous study, which measured the median diameter of particles (range, 1.19-1.42

212

produced by HFNC (11). Coughing increased the amount and distance of dispersing smaller

213

particles, suggesting that aerosols from lung alveoli were especially dispersed by coughing.

214

HFNC did not increase the number of smaller particles or aerosols compared to conventional

215

nasal cannula or room air while coughing. These findings suggest that oxygen delivery

216

devices investigated in this study are potential aerosol-dispersing procedures, but not AGPs

217

(15).

218

In the NPPV mode, although only one type of NPPV mask was evaluated in this study,

219

floated droplets were visible while coughing and might harm bioaerosol dispersion during

220

treatment. In addition, droplets and aerosols were approximately 10-times more during

221

coughing than during speaking, regardless of types of oxygen devices. The difference is

222

larger than that in a previous study (11), which showed about a twice increased number of

223

particles while coughing in any devices; however, those particles were assessed only about 5

μm)

224

cm away from mouths in that study (11). Notably, surgical masks significantly reduced

225

dispersion counts of both droplets and aerosols while speaking or coughing, regardless of

226

oxygen delivery modes. Indeed, surgical masks effectively reduced over 90% of droplets and

227

over 95% of aerosols during HFNC. While speaking, the reduction rate of particle dispersion

228

by surgical masks during HFNC was higher than that during nasal cannula. This result is

229

supported by previous findings of velocity map of gas flow experiments (16), which showed

230

that the proportion of droplets (> 5 µm) captured by surgical masks was higher during 40

231

L/min of HFNC than during 6 L/min of nasal cannula, suggesting that high-velocity particles

232

are more likely to be captured into surgical masks than lower velocity particles (16). In our

233

study, 60 L/min of HFNC did not increase counts and dispersion distance of droplets or

234

aerosols compared to 30 L/min of HFNC; the finding is consistent with that in a previous

235

study (11). The particle dispersion may be limited when the cannula of HFNC is properly

236

fitted (9), even at the highest flow rate.

237

This study has several limitations. First, this study included a relatively small

238

number of individuals. The particle experiments were performed in healthy volunteers, but

239

not in viral pneumonia patients. Second, only one-sided visualization was recorded, and

240

dispersion in the three-dimensional space was not evaluated. Third, the particle quantification

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.10.21249533; this version posted January 12, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

241

experiment was performed at a mild down flow, which might affect the natural distance of

242

dispersion, and the design of the quantification experiment limited the detection area of

243

particles. Forth, particles with a size of less than 0.5 µm were not detectable in our study;

244

however, these smaller particles are not speculated to contain enough viruses for transmission

245

(17). To date, the virus load of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols generated from coughing or

246

included in exhaled breath from patients with COVID-19 has not been reported (18),

247

although SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be viable in room air for 3 hours (19). The virus

248

load or concentration required for transmission in humans needs to be further investigated.

249

In summary, with our study, HFNC did not increase either quantity or distance of droplet and

250

aerosol dispersion compared to standard nasal cannula therapy, and surgical masks decreased

251

particle dispersion and improved safety of healthcare workers during HFNC, even at the

252

highest flow, in appropriate infection control settings. Our findings support that surgical

253

masks should be recommended for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to

254

viral pneumonia, including COVID-19 patients. Further studies are warranted to examine

255

viral spread and risks associated with HFNC therapy in COVID-19 patients.
