Abstract
Introduction: The natural history and transmission patterns of endemic human coronaviruses
are of increased interest following the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Methods: In rural Kenya 483 individuals from 47 households were followed for six months
(2009-10) with nasopharyngeal swabs collected twice weekly regardless of symptoms. A total
of 16,918 swabs were tested for human coronavirus (hCoV) OC43, NL63 and 229E and other
respiratory viruses using polymerase chain reaction.
Results: From 346 (71.6%) household members 629 hCoV infection episodes were defined
with 36.3% being symptomatic: varying by hCoV type and decreasing with age. Symptomatic
episodes (aHR=0.6 (95% CI:0.5-0.8) or those with elevated peak viral load (medium aHR=0.4
(0.3-0.6); high aHR=0.31 (0.2-0.4)) had longer viral shedding compared to their respective
counterparts. Homologous reinfections were observed in 99 (19.9%) of 497 first infections.
School-age children (55%) were the most common index cases with those having medium
(aOR=5.3 (2.3 – 12.0)) or high (8.1 (2.9 - 22.5)) peak viral load most often generating secondary
cases.
Conclusion: Household coronavirus infection was common, frequently asymptomatic and
mostly introduced by school-age children. Secondary transmission was influenced by viral load
of index cases. Homologous-type reinfection was common. These data may be insightful for
SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
Four endemic species of human coronavirus (hCoV); HKU1, OC43, NL63 and 229E are
widespread and associated primarily with mild acute respiratory illness [1]. Infections with
endemic hCoVs are reportedly more severe in young children and the elderly [2,3]. In the last
two decades, three new members of this virus family have emerged as human pathogens; severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [4], Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [5] and most recently SARS-CoV-2 [6]. The pandemic spread and
continued circulation beyond the initial wave of infection suggests a potential for SARS-CoV2 to become resident within the human population. A focus on the natural history and
transmission characteristics of current little-studied endemic species of hCoV may give insight
to the future behaviour of this emergent relative [7].
Using data from a study of 47 households in rural Kenya, we have previously reported baseline
data on the occurrence of hCoV [8] and a detailed analysis of reinfection with hCoV-NL63 [9].
In the present study, we investigate the natural history of infection and transmission patterns
of three endemic hCoV within these households.

Materials and Methods
The household data
This study utilizes data from a prospective household-based cohort study conducted in one
administrative location within the Kilifi health and demographic surveillance system (KHDSS)
[8,10] on the Kenyan coast. The study design and methods have been described elsewhere
[8,11]. Briefly, with a primary objective of characterising ‘who infects whom’ with respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV), households with an infant born after the end of the 2008/2009 RSV
season (referred to as the study infant) and at least one elder sibling (aged <13 years) were

enrolled. The study period spanned a complete RSV season from 8th December 2009 to 5th June
2010. Nasopharyngeal specimens (NPS) were collected from all household members
irrespective of symptoms, once a week in the first four weeks and twice-a-week thereafter until
the study end. A household was defined as members (who need not be related) of one or more
building units who share the same cooking facility. The study had a good retention rate (>80%)
of households and of individuals over the study period [11].

Molecular testing of the NPS collections using multiplex RT-PCR assay
A previously described real time multiplex RT-PCR (mPCR) assay with targets for 15
respiratory viruses was used [12]. The target pathogens were human coronavirus (hCoV
species (also called types) OC43, NL63 and 229E), RSV A and B, rhinovirus (RV), adenovirus
(AdV), parainfluenza virus (types 1-4), influenza virus (types A, B and C) and human
metapneumovirus (hMPV). A preliminary screen of the NPS showed the last three virus groups
were uncommon during the surveillance period and hence not screened for the remainder of
the NPS collections [8]. A specimen with a cycle threshold (Ct) value of ≤35.0 for a specific
virus target was considered positive.

Statistical analysis
Data analyses were undertaken in STATA Version 13.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas,
USA). Descriptive statistics for continuous variables are presented as mean (± standard
deviation) and median (interquartile range (IQR)). Categorical variables were summarised
using counts and proportions and the chi- square test of association was used to examine the
independence. The Mood’s median test was used to investigate equality of median times across

levels of categorical variables. Two or more groups were compared using test for equality of
proportions.
Type-specific individual hCoV infection episodes were defined as a period with positive mPCR
result(s) of the same type with no more than 14 days apart [13]. Episodes where no samples
were collected and tested for >7 days before or after the infection episode were considered leftor right-censored, respectively. An episode was considered symptomatic if the individual was
identified with any of the following symptoms during the infection episode; cough, runny nose,
sore throat, nasal flaring, indrawing, crackles, wheeze, fever, unable to feed, head nodding,
lethargy, unable to talk, cyanosis or difficulty breathing. Co-infection was assigned when
within the hCoV infection episode an NPS collection was mPCR positive for a different hCoV
species or another of the viruses tested, namely; RSV, RV, or AdV. Detection of two or more
individual infection episodes by the same hCoV type in a household within a span of 14 days
constituted a household outbreak. For each household hCoV introduction, a primary (index)
case was defined as the first person(s) to test positive for hCoV by mPCR while secondary
case(s) were the rest of the members who are part of the same household outbreak. For
individuals with multiple hCoV infection episodes, reinfections were classified as either
homologous (same hCoV species) or heterologous (different hCoV species) with respect to
previously detected species during the study period. As an example, if an individual has 3
infections in the temporal order OC43, NL63 and OC43, then the second infection episode
would be heterologous to the first, and the third homologous to the first infection episode and
heterologous to the second episode.
Durations of virus shedding were estimated using a midpoint method which was defined as the
period starting midway between the first positive sample and the previous negative sample and
ending midway between the last positive sample and the subsequent negative sample. Further
details on this approach are provided elsewhere [13]. Kaplan Meir (KM) curves were used to

describe the survival functions (time to end of virus shedding) by different categorical variables
across the three endemic hCoV types. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) obtained from
multivariable Cox proportional hazards (PH) models were used to estimate the influence of
several factors on the duration of shedding and symptoms. Logistic regression models were
used to identify risk factors for spread of infection from the primary cases to other household
members. The risk factors considered were age, sex, household size, presence of respiratory
symptoms, presence of other respiratory pathogens and peak viral load in an infection episode.
The peak/highest viral load was defined as the lowest Ct value in an individual infection
episode and was categorised into three levels; low (>=30), medium (20-29) and high (<20). To
account for clustering either at individual or household level, robust cluster variance estimator
was used in the Cox PH and logistic regression models discussed above.
Results
Baseline characteristics
A total of 483 individuals from 47 households had NPS collected over the six-month period.
The mean number of household members was 10.5 (SD=6.5) classified into small (4-7
members), medium (8-16 members) and large (17- 37 members). The median age of
participants at the start of sampling was 10.7 years (IQR: 4.0 – 23.4). The cohort had 214
(44.3%) male participants. Of the 47 study infants, the average age at the start of the study was
3.9 (SD=2.6) months and 22 (46.8%) of the infants were males. A total of 16,918 NPS from
483 individuals were successfully tested for OC43, 229E and NL63. The median number of
NPS collected from study participants was 41 (IQR: 30 - 44).
Of the 16918 samples tested, 1274 (7.5%) were positive for any of the three hCoV: 651 (3.8%),
418 (2.5%) and 241 (1.4%) samples were positive for OC43, NL63 and 229E, respectively.
Seven (0.04%) NPS collections were positive for both OC43 and NL63, 17 (0.1%) were

positive for both OC43 and 229E and 13 (0.08%) were positive for both NL63 and 229E. Only
one sample was positive for all three hCoV tested. Higher individual crude attack rates (Table
1) were seen in school going children (129/169; 76.3%), males (160/214; 74.8%) and younger
individuals (<1 year; 42/55, 76.4%, 1-4 years; 64/82, 78.0% and 5-14 years; 125/163, 76.7%)
(Supplementary figure S1) and individuals residing small (75/95, 79.0%) and large households
(97/124, 78.2%).
Symptomatic individuals contributed to 410 (32.2%) of the 1274 samples that were positive
for any HCoV and 3150 (20.1%) of 15645 hCoV negative samples. Symptomatic individuals
contributed to 240 (36.9%), 132 (31.6%) and 47 (19.5%) of the total number of samples that
tested positive for OC43, NL63 and 229E, respectively, and correspondingly 3320 (20.4%),
3428 (20.8%) and 3513 (21.1%) of samples that tested negative. There was a statistically

HCoV infection episodes
The pattern of shedding of each of the three hCoV types and of all hCoVs, is displayed in
Figure 1. Over the study period, 346 (71.6%) of the 483 individuals experienced one or more
hCoV infection episode. The total number of individual infection episodes was 260 for OC43,
216 for NL63, 140 for 229E and 629 for any hCoV type. Of these the number of episodes
symptomatic was 116 (44.5%) for OC43, 85 (39.4%) for NL63, 35 (25.0%) for 229E and 228
(36.3%) for any hCoV type. The proportion of symptomatic episodes differed by hCoV type

(23.6%), 28 (20%) and 105 (16.7%) of OC43, NL63, 229E or any hCoV infection episodes,
respectively were either right or left-censored and were excluded in survival analysis.
On average, the peak viral load of the individual infection episodes was higher in symptomatic
compared to asymptomatic episodes (Figure 2). This was supported by linear regression model,
adjusted for age, fitted on the peak viral load showing symptomatic infection episodes had a
higher viral load (lower Ct values) compared to asymptomatic episodes for OC43 (. = −4.16,
95% CI= -5.55, -2.77, p-value<0.001), NL63 (. = −2.74, 95% CI= -5.06, -0.43, pvalue=0.020), 229E (. = −5.79, 95% CI= -9.88 , -1.70, p-value=0.006) and any hCoV (. =
−3.11, 95% CI= -4.50, -1.72, p-value <0.001).

Durations of hCoV shedding and factors influencing shedding patterns
The duration of virus shedding varied by hCoV type with the longest median duration observed
for OC43 (7.5 days, IQR: 3.5 -13.5) and the shortest median duration for 229E (3.5 days, IQR:
3.5 - 7.0) (Figure 3). The results of the survival analysis of shedding durations are shown in
Table 2. For OC43, the rate of recovery from an infection episode, compared to children aged
<1 year, was higher in children aged 5-14 years (aHR=2.21, 95% CI: 1.40 – 3.47, pvalue=<0.001), those aged 15-39 years (aHR=1.72, 95% CI: 1.05 – 2.83, p-value=0.032) and
older adults 40 years or more (aHR=3.44, 95% CI: 1.97 – 6.01, p-value <0.001). Age
dependence for duration of infection episodes was not observed for NL63, 229E and pooled
hCoV type analysis. Lower rates of recovery from OC43 virus shedding (i.e. longer shedding
durations) were observed among symptomatic (compared to asymptomatic) individuals
(aHR=0.56, 95% CI: 0.39 - 0.81, p-value=0.002), and individuals with medium peak viral load
(aHR=0.32, 95% CI: 0.22-0.47, p-value <0.001) and high peak viral load (aHR= 0.22, 95%

CI: 0.14-0.36, p-value <0.001) compared to individuals with low peak viral load. Recovery
rates from NL63 infection episode was dependent on detection of other viral pathogens within
the same infection episode (aHR= 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34 - 0.87, p-value= 0.011), being
symptomatic (aHR= 0.67, 95% CI: 0.50 - 0.90, p-value=0.009), and medium (aHR= 0.49, 95%
CI: 0.33 - 0.74, p-value=0.001) and high (aHR=0.37, 95% CI: 0.24 - 0.59, p-value <0.001)
peak viral load in an infection episode. For 229E, having medium (aHR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.30
- 0.78, p-value=0.003) and high (aHR=0.21, 95% CI: 0.11 - 0.40, p-value=<0.001) peak viral
load significantly affected the rate of recovery from an infection episode. The KM curves for
each factor are presented in supplementary figures S2-S5.

Duration of symptomatic period
The median duration of symptoms (Supplementary Table S1) was 7.0, 4.0, 3.5 and 4.0 days,
for OC43, NL63, 229E and any hCoV, respectively. For any hCoV median durations tended to
decline with increasing age, increase in the presence of other respiratory viruses and increase
for high peak viral load. There was some variation between hCoV type.
The rate of recovery from symptoms (Supplementary Table S2) within any hCoV infection
episodes increased with age; 1-4 years (aHR=1.45, 95% CI: 1.03 - 2.04, p-value=0.034), 5-14
years (aHR=1.64, 95% CI:1.12 - 2.39 , p-value=0.010), 15-39 years (aHR=2.25, 95% CI: 1.30
– 3.89 , p-value=0.003); 40 years and above (aHR=1.61, 95% CI: 1.10 – 2.37, p-value=0.014).
A similar pattern was observed on OC43 alone out of the three hCoVs. Infection episodes with
a coinfection with another virus had lower rates of recovery from symptoms for 229E
(aHR=0.33, 95% CI: 0.17 - 0.63, p-value=0.001) and any hCoV (aHR=0.71, 95% CI: 0.55 0.91, p-value=0.006). The rate of symptoms clearance within OC43 infection episodes was
influenced by medium peak viral load (aHR=0.15, 95% CI 0.07 - 0.31, p-value < 0.001) and

high peak viral load (aHR=0.14 95% CI: 0.07 - 0.29, p-value<0.001). Similarly, a lower
recovery rate was observed for any hCoV infection episodes with medium peak viral load (aHR
0.44, 95% CI: 0.29 - 0.68, p-value < 0.001) and high peak viral load (aHR=0.35, 0.23 - 0.54,
p-value<0.001).

Reinfection
Details of reinfections in the study cohort are given in Table 3. Of 483 study individuals, 346
(71.6%) experienced one or more infection episodes and 171 (35%) experienced multiple
infection episodes for any hCoV type. Of the 215, 163, and 119 individuals who had first
infections of OC43, NL63 and 229E, respectively, a corresponding 35 (16.3%), 44 (27.0%)
and 20 (16.8%), experienced one or more homologous reinfections. In summation, a total of
497 first infections with OC43, NL63 and 229E were observed of which 99 (19.9%) were
infected at least once with the homologous type. Of the 629 episodes, 346 (55.0%) were first
and 283 (45.0%) secondary, infections and 154/283 (54.4%) reinfections were of homologous
type. Analysing the total infections by type, the proportion of homologous reinfection episodes
$
varied (!(")
= 6.12, p-value =0.047) by type (17.3% of 260 OC43 episodes, 24.5% of 216

NL63 episodes and 15.0% of 140 episodes due to 229E). In addition, 48 (31.2%) of the 154
homologous reinfection episodes due to any hCoV were symptomatic, compared to 56 (43,4%)

first infection episode and start of the first reinfection episode, a total of 16 (9.4%) did not have
any swabs taken, possibly indicating a continuation of the first episode, while 9 (5.3%), 8

(4.7%), 14 (8.2%) and 124 (72.5%) had 1,2,3 and ³4 PCR negative samples respectively out
of the 171 individuals with multiple infections.
There was no difference in the proportion of symptomatic episodes in the first infection
episodes (124/346, 35.8%) compared to reinfections (104/283, 36.8%) (p-value=0.7952).
Disaggregation of symptomatic infection episodes by hCoV type showed that the contribution
of each pathogen to the first 124 symptomatic episodes varied; OC43 (58.1%), NL63 (26.6%),
229E (14.5%) and hCoV-hCoV coinfection (0.8%). Similarly, out of the 104 symptomatic
reinfections episodes, there was a variation in the proportion of hCoV type; OC43 (36.5%),
NL63 (44.2%), 229E (12.5%) and hCoV- hCoV coinfection (6.7%).

Transmission of hCoV in households
All the 47 households had at least one of the three hCoV detected while hCoV-OC43, NL63
and 229E were detected in 44 (93.6%), 33 (70.2%) and 30 (63.8%) of the households,
respectively. There were 78, 48, 59 and 201 household introductions for OC43, NL63, 229E
and any hCoV, respectively. Siblings and cousins, predominantly of school going age, to the
study infants were index cases for 59.0%, 64.6%, 52.5% and 53.7% of OC43, NL63, 229E and
any hCoV household introductions, respectively (Figure 4). Out of the total number of
household introductions, 46 (59.0%), 30 (62.5%), 23 (39.0%) and 96 (47.8%) led to secondary
infections in 35, 23, 17 and 43 households for OC43, NL63, 229E and any hCoV, respectively.
The proportion of secondary infections due to the 3 hCoV types was significantly different
$
across types (!($)
= 7.50, p-value =0.023).

The risk of generating a secondary case after introduction of any of the three endemic hCoV in
the household was higher for index cases whose peak viral load was medium (aOR=5.29, 95%
CI: 2.34 – 11.96, p-value <0.001) or high (aOR=8.12, 95% CI: 2.92 - 22.51, p-value <0.001)

compared those with a low peak viral load. However, being a symptomatic index case was not
associated with increased risk of infecting other members of the household (aOR=0.97, 95%
CI: 0.42 - 2.21, p-value=0.933) compared to asymptomatic index cases (Supplementary Table
S3).
Discussion
Longitudinal studies of households have played an important role in developing understanding
of the epidemiology of respiratory viruses [7,14]. Here we continue this approach, reporting an
intensive surveillance of 483 household members in rural coastal Kenya [11], to delineate the
natural history of infection and transmission patterns of three endemic coronaviruses (OC43,
NL63 and 229E). This involved the application of sensitive molecular diagnostic methods
[7,14], and additionally applied sampling that was frequent and irrespective of observed
symptoms [8]. The hCoV types were common in this setting with each of the 47 households,
and about 72% of the enrolled household members, experiencing infection with at least one of
three targets over the six months of the study. A note of caution in interpreting the results of
this study is that infection status determined by PCR assay is not necessarily indicative of active
infection or an individual’s infectiousness.

Crude attack rates were highest for hCoV-OC43 and lowest for 229E, higher in general for
younger age classes (<15 years of age), school-age children and for males. These results are
broadly consistent with the findings by Monto et al. who also found highest incidence for
OC43, lowest for 229E, and higher incidence among those aged below 5 years for NL63 and
OC43 [7].

The three hCoV types had differing durations of shedding ranging from 3.5 days (229E) to 7.5
days (OC43). However, these median time estimates are influenced by our sampling frequency:
predominantly every 3-4 days. The duration of shedding was longer in episodes with high peak
virus load and which were symptomatic. Consistent with findings from other studies, we report
occurrence of hCoV infection episodes among asymptomatic individuals [15–17] who had
lower viral load [18] and shorter durations of virus shedding compared to symptomatic
episodes. Despite asymptomatic infections being predominant (>70% of episodes) the above
findings suggest they were less likely to transmit infection compared to symptomatic
individuals. The duration of symptomatic episodes was related to peak virus load as reported
elsewhere [25] and tended to decline with increasing age.

Participants of all ages had appreciable risk of infection for the three endemic viruses
suggesting previous infection does not provide solid immunity. This is supported by our
observation that, within the short period of the study, reinfections were common and as
frequently of homologous as heterologous type. Overall, 20% of individuals with a first
infection of one or other type, were reinfected by the same type at least once, most commonly
for type NL63 (24.5%). Homologous reinfections were frequently (>30%) symptomatic. We
report no difference in the proportion of symptomatic cases between the first episodes and
reinfection episodes and note that the time to reinfection with homologous was similar to
heterologous episodes (~40 days). Our observations indicate that immunity to reinfection is
commonly short lived and does not appear to be type specific. A recent serological study
involving 10 adult men detected reinfections from seasonal coronaviruses but most frequently
occurring after an interval of 12 months[19]. A limitation of our analysis is that reinfections
might in fact have been prolonged shedding from a single infection. This is likely not a major

effect as in most presumed reinfections (>70%) there were at least 4 PCR test negative results
between episodes.

Older children (siblings and cousins) and other adults were the major introducers of hCoV
transmission into the household compared to RSV transmission in the same households
whereby older children (> 32%) were the leading primary cases [11]. Similarly, children have
been reported to form the highest proportion of index cases in the USA and UK [7,20].
However, presence of older adults, children, smokers and individuals with chronic ailments
within the households in the UK study was associated with increased household transmission
[20]. Secondary transmission of hCoV to other household members upon introduction was high
(48%) for any of the three hCoVs (ranged from 39% to 62% across type). This differs from a
recent study in England which concluded that the vast majority (>90%) of observed hCoV
infections were acquired outside the household [20]. In our study, the risk of secondary
transmission was higher among index cases with high viral loads. Interestingly, there was no
significant association between the presence of symptoms among index cases and the risk of
secondary transmission, as observed elsewhere [20].

In conclusion, endemic coronaviruses are common within the household setting, infecting all
age groups, and often without eliciting symptoms. Secondary transmission following
household introduction is associated with viral load but not, it appears, with symptomatic
status, and homologous reinfection is common for all hCoV types.
