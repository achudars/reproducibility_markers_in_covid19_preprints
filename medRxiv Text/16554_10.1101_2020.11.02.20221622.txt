Abstract

In response to COVID-19, the international water community rapidly developed methods to
quantify the SARS-CoV-2 genetic signal in untreated wastewater. Wastewater surveillance using
such methods has the potential to complement clinical testing in assessing community health. This
interlaboratory assessment evaluated the reproducibility and sensitivity of 36 standard operating
procedures (SOPs), divided into eight method groups based on sample concentration approach and
whether solids were removed. Two raw wastewater samples were collected in August 2020,
amended with a matrix spike (betacoronavirus OC43), and distributed to 32 laboratories across the
U.S. Replicate samples analyzed in accordance with the project’s quality assurance plan showed
high reproducibility across the 36 SOPs: 80% of the recovery-corrected results fell within a band
of +/- 1.15-log10 genome copies/L with higher reproducibility observed within a single SOP
(standard deviation of 0.13-log10). The inclusion of a solids removal step and the selection of a
concentration method did not show a clear, systematic impact on the recovery-corrected results.
Other methodological variations (e.g., pasteurization, primer set selection, and use of RT-qPCR or
RT-dPCR platforms) generally resulted in small differences compared to other sources of
variability. These findings suggest that a variety of methods are capable of producing reproducible
results, though the same SOP or laboratory should be selected to track SARS-CoV-2 trends at a
given facility. The methods showed a 7-log10 range of recovery efficiency and limit of detection
highlighting the importance of recovery correction and the need to consider method sensitivity
when selecting methods for wastewater surveillance.

Introduction

The international water community responded rapidly to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic by
developing methods to measure SARS-CoV-2 genome concentrations in wastewater1-3. This effort
was prompted by the identification of fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in infected individuals4-6.
As a result, wastewater surveillance has the potential to complement clinical testing by providing
a broad observational assessment of the community’s health3, 7. Such knowledge could help guide
public health agencies to identify and respond to outbreaks. Unlike clinical data—which may be
biased toward the evaluation of symptomatic individuals—wastewater contains regular inputs
from the entire population representing all stages of infection from symptomatic to presymptomatic to asymptomatic individuals. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that
wastewater surveillance can provide an early warning of community infection, with wastewater
concentrations spiking several days before identification through clinical testing7-11.
In April, 2020, The Water Research Foundation (WRF) hosted an international summit to evaluate
the use of wastewater surveillance as an indicator of the distribution of COVID-19 in
communities12. The participants identified two priority applications for the use of wastewater
surveillance data: 1) tracking trends in occurrence and 2) assessing the degree of community
prevalence. One of the prerequisites for these applications, however, is the identification of
reliable, reproducible, and sensitive methods10, 12, 13. To help address this issue, this study
performed an interlaboratory evaluation of 36 different methods used to assess the genetic signal
of SARS-CoV-2 in untreated wastewater. The nationwide study included 32 U.S. laboratories from
19 different states each processing split samples of two different raw wastewaters emanating from
populations known to have high levels of infection. The project sought to identify if and how the
SARS-CoV-2 findings were impacted by multiple methodological differences such as sample
concentration method, pasteurization pre-treatment, primer/probe selection, and solids removal
steps. The effort did not intend to standardize a single method, but evaluate whether the existing
methods provide sufficient reliability and reproducibility to track trends in occurrence and assess
the prevalence of community infection.

Methods

3.1 Participating labs
The 32 participating laboratories included 17 academic labs, 6 commercial labs, 4 nonmunicipal government labs, 3 municipalities, and 2 manufacturers of molecular tests (Table
1). Prior to the interlaboratory study, many of the labs were engaged in on-going monitoring
efforts across the country. The participating labs agreed to follow the project’s quality
assurance project plan (QAPP) described below and process ten independent samples over a
one-week period. The project QAPP is described in detail in this section in addition to an
overview of the 36 individual Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) evaluated in the study.

3.2 Microorganisms
Human betacoronavirus OC43 was used as a matrix spike to assess the recovery efficiency of each
method. To prepare the OC43 matrix spike, a concentrated stock of OC43 (Betacoronavirus 1
(ATCC® VR-1558™)) was grown in cell culture using HCT-8 cells (ATCC® CCL-244™),
according to ATCC instructions. The concentration of OC43 genome copies (GC) in the stock was
quantified by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) against a
standard curve of Quantitative Genomic RNA from Betacoronavirus 1 (ATCC® VR-1558DQ™)
to determine the GC per ml of the stock. Eight labs concurrently evaluated additional matrix spike
organisms, including bovine coronavirus (BCoV), heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2, bacteriophage
MS2, bacteriophage Phi6, in vitro transcribed RNA, and an engineered RNA virus.

3.3 Sample collection, shipping, and handling
As detailed in the QAPP, raw wastewater samples were collected and distributed from two
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Los Angeles County on two sampling days: (1) the
Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant (operated by the City of Los Angeles Sanitation and

Environment) on August 17, 2020 (Plant 1) and (2) the Joint Water Pollution Control Plant
(operated by the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts) on August 19, 2020 (Plant 2). These
plants are two of the largest wastewater treatment plants on the west coast of the United States
(Table 2). The sample collection location at both WWTPs was after grit removal prior to primary
clarification. At both WWTPs, a single 40-gallon grab sample was collected at approximately
10:00 am. The bulk sample was distributed into 1-gal containers (one for each lab) while mixing
the bulk sample continuously to promote homogeneity. To confirm the homogeneity of the
samples, 1-L aliquots were collected after the 1 st, 17th, and 34th samples and the total suspended
solids, temperature, and pH were measured as surrogates for sample homogeneity (Table 2). The
1-gallon samples were chilled on dry ice to a temperature of approximately 4°C and then blindspiked with betacoronavirus OC43 to a final concentration of 2.8 x 108 GC/L. The samples were
shipped to each laboratory with enough ice packs to maintain a temperature below 10°C. The
participating labs were instructed to begin processing the sample between 8:00 AM and 12:00 PM
Pacific time on the day after sample collection (i.e., 24 ± 2 hr after sample collection).

3.4 Sample analysis
The participating labs each processed a total of 10 sample replicates. Most of the labs achieved
these 10 sample replicates by processing five sample replicates from Plant 1 and five from Plant
2. Eight laboratories evaluated the impact of heat pasteurization (60°C for 60 min) and so they
achieved their 10 sample replicates by processing five sample replicates without heat
pasteurization and five with heat pasteurization, all from Plant 1.
Each of the participating labs followed their own SOP for sample pre-treatment, concentration,
extraction, and molecular analysis. Four of the participating labs tested two different SOPs leading
to a total of 36 SOPs evaluated across the 32 labs. The SOPs were organized into eight method
groups based on the concentration step prior to RNA extraction and whether solids were removed
prior to concentration. The key method steps and categorization of the 36 SOPs are shown in Table
3. Briefly, the starting sample volume ranged from 0.25 mL to 400 mL across the SOPs. The first
step in sample processing was pre-treatment (e.g., heat pasteurization, solids removal, and/or
chemical addition). Most labs did not pasteurize their samples before processing. SOPs involving
heat pasteurization for all of the samples are marked with “H” and those involving heat
pasteurization for half of the samples are marked with “(H)”. Approximately half of the SOPs
involved the removal of solids (using either centrifugation, filtration, or both) prior to
concentration. Method groups with SOPs involving solids removal are marked with an “S”. Many
of the SOPs involved addition of chemicals to adjust the pH and/or the ionic composition of the
matrix prior to concentration. After pre-treatment, the next major step in sample processing was
concentration. The four main categories of concentration steps among these SOPs were 1) no
concentration (i.e., direct extraction), 2) ultrafiltration, 3) filtration using an electronegative
membrane (i.e., HA filter), and 4) PEG precipitation. The next step in sample processing was

extraction. A variety of different extraction kits and in-house methods were used by the
participating laboratories to extract the RNA from the sample. After extraction, the molecular
analysis was conducted using either one-step or two-step RT-qPCR or reverse transcription digital
PCR (RT-dPCR). All labs analyzed the native SARS-CoV-2 molecular signal using the N1 and
N2 primer/probes sets and the OC43 matrix spike (Table 4). The concentration factors (CF)
resulting from the different method steps of the SOPs, calculated using the equation below, ranged
from 5 to 2100.

While each laboratory followed their own SOP, each lab was required to adhere to the project’s
QAPP that described the quality control requirements14. The QAPP was constructed to ensure
uniformity in sample collection, shipping and handling, quality control for the analytical methods,
data management, and validation. Key elements of the QAPP included:

Blind matrix spikes. OC43 was spiked into each wastewater aliquot to achieve a final
concentration of 2.8 x 108 GC/L. The spike concentration was chosen to exceed typical background
levels by orders of magnitude. Each lab was required to analyze OC43 concentrations in the same
RNA extract used for SARS-CoV-2 quantification. Results from the OC43 blind matrix spikes
were used to determine the recovery efficiency for each method.
RT-qPCR standard curves. Standard curves were required for each qPCR plate in which an
environmental sample was quantified. The QAPP did not specify the use of a single type of
standard due to cost and time constraints; however, it did specify that any plasmid-based standards
be linearized prior to use.
Positive control. At least one positive control per target was run on each PCR plate to identify
false negative results.
No template control (NTC). The QAPP specified the inclusion of NTCs using PCR grade water
processed by the same PCR steps as the sample. NTCs were required on every PCR plate to
identify false positive results.
Laboratory method blank. At least one method blank (i.e., reagent water handled and processed
by the same steps as the wastewater sample) was required for every round of samples.
Inhibition control. To assess the presence of inhibitory substances, the QAPP required that a
molecular target not naturally present in the matrix be added to two qPCR wells in addition to the
environmental RNA extract. The same target was added to two additional wells with PCR grade
water. If the difference in RT-qPCR cycle numbers was greater than 1.0 between the two samples
(i.e., the environmental extract and the PCR grade water), the labs were required to dilute and rerun the sample. For dPCR, the signal in the environmental sample was compared to the signal in
the PCR grade water. If the ratio was less than 0.5, the labs were required to dilute and re-run the
sample.
Molecular duplicates. For each replicate RNA extract, the molecular analysis was performed in
duplicate.
Optional matrix spike. Nine of the laboratories evaluated a second matrix spike organism in
addition to the QAPP-specified OC43 spike. The labs were required to spike the second surrogate
to the raw wastewater samples at concentrations exceeding the background concentration. The
sample was processed and analyzed for the surrogate in the same replicates used to analyze for the
native SARS-CoV-2 and the spiked OC43.

3.5 Data analysis
The following quality control exclusion criteria were used to determine which data were included
in the method analysis.
Limit of detection. Only results within the linear region of the standard curve were accepted as
quantifiable results above the detection limit. An allowance of one CT (corresponding to an
approximate two-fold decrease in concentration) was given when determining whether the results
were within the range covered by the standard curve. Results that were lower than one CT of the
lowest quantifiable standard were considered non-detects (NDs). Results that were self-reported
by the laboratory as below the limit of detection or the limit of quantification were considered
NDs. Two thirds of the SOPs had at least one molecular replicate that was marked as non-detect
due to these criteria.

Non-detects. NDs were not included in the method analysis. If one of the molecular replicates for
a sample replicate was non-detect and the other was above the detection limit (duplicates were
performed for each sample replicate), only the result above the detection limit was used. If both
molecular replicates were non-detect, the result for the sample replicate was non-detect. The
number of sample replicates that were non-detect for both molecular replicates is presented in the
results section.
Standard curves. If multiple replicates were performed for each standard, only the replicates with
quantifiable results were used to develop the standard curve.
Sample hold time. If the sample was processed more than 24 hours outside of the specified 4-h
processing window (8 a.m. to 12 p.m. Pacific Time on the day after sample collection), the results
were not included in the method analysis. The results from one SOP (1S.1(H)) were excluded
based on this criterion. Exceptions were made for two labs (SOPs 2.1 and 3.6) who immediately
froze the samples upon receipt.
Contamination. If all of the NTCs or method blanks for N1, N2, or OC43 gave positive results,
the results were excluded from the method analysis. This exclusion criterion applied to SOP 3.2
(but only for the N1 target).
Minimum recovery efficiency. If the recovery of the OC43 matrix spike was less than 0.01%, the
SARS-CoV-2 results were excluded from the method analysis. The results from two SOPs (2S.1
and 3S.1) were excluded based on this criterion. Nevertheless, the limit of detection could still be
calculated for these SOPs so their values were included in the method sensitivity analysis.
Cross-reactivity between BCoV and OC43. Several of the laboratories reported cross-reactivity
between OC43 and their second matrix spike, BCoV. Further investigation showed that the OC43
primer/probes detected BCoV but not vice versa. This was confirmed in vitro through
quantification of BCoV cDNA with the OC43 assay as well as in silico using NCBI BLAST.
Because the BCoV was typically spiked at concentrations that were an order of magnitude lower
than OC43 (SOPs 1S.2H, 2S.3, 3.4, 4S.3, and 4S.7) and because the current OC43 assay had lower
sensitivity towards BCoV genome than the BCoV assay, the impact was deemed to be negligible
(< 10%). In one case (SOP 3.5), the OC43 and BCoV concentrations were the same order of
magnitude. No correction to the OC43 recovery was deemed necessary because the BCoV matrix
spike led to an approximate two-fold increase in concentrations, whereas the recovery efficiencies
ranged over several orders of magnitude.
Amplification plots. Five of the SOPs (1.1, 2S.2, 2S.3, 4S.2(H), 4S.7) had non-sigmoidal
amplification plots for all of the sample replicates while the standards had the expected sigmoidal
shape. The results from these SOPs were not excluded for this reason, but it should be noted that
there may be greater error associated with these results since the results are more dependent on the
fluorescence threshold selected for qPCR quantification. A non-sigmoidal amplification curve
may be due to a level of matrix interference that was not detected by the inhibition control (all five
SOPs passed their inhibition controls).

Number of replicates. While most laboratories processed five sample replicates per sample, four
labs processed three replicates per sample (SOPs 1S.3(H), 2.1, 2.2, and 4S.8(H)), one lab processed
one replicate per sample (SOP 4.4), and SOP 4S.5H processed eight replicates for the Plant 1 and
ten sample replicates for Plant 2. All data were included in the analysis.
A summary of the results that were excluded from the analysis are presented in Table 5.

Two thirds of SOPs had at least one molecular replicate that were marked as non-detect due to the results falling outside of
the range covered by the standard curve. NDs were not included in the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 results, but the SOPs were still
included in method sensitivity analysis.

After applying the exclusion criteria, the results of the sample replicates from each WWTP were
analyzed separately. In the eight cases where an SOP was tested with and without pasteurization,
the results were analyzed independently. When analyzing data by method group, only the five
replicates without pasteurization were included in the statistical analysis of the method groups so
as to not give extra weight to those SOPs.

3.6 Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed in R using the log10-transform of the SARS-CoV-2
concentration, recovery efficiency, and limit of detection15. One-way ANOVA was used to
compare the results of the eight method groups. A Tukey post-hoc test was used to perform
multiple pair-wise comparisons. Comparisons with a p-value less than 0.05 were considered
significant. Two-way ANOVA, with an interaction term, was used to evaluate the impact of
different method steps, specifically, heat pasteurization, solids removal, primer/probe target, PCR
platform, and matrix spike selection. Two-way ANOVA allows for the evaluation of two
independent variables. The difference between the two levels of the second independent variable
are calculated at each level of the first independent variable and averaged to determine if the
difference is significant. For each of the method steps evaluated, the first independent variable was
either the SOP or the concentration step and the second independent variable was the method step
of interest: heat pasteurization, solids removal, primer/probe target, PCR platform, and matrix
spike surrogate. The dependent variable was either the SARS-CoV-2 concentration or the matrix
spike recovery. When the design was unbalanced, a type III sum of squares approach was used for
two-way ANOVA.

Results

Over 2000 data points were produced from the interlaboratory analyses. This section addresses
the reproducibility and sensitivity of the methods, both across all SOPs as well as within each of
the eight major method groups. In addition, the impact of several other method steps—namely,
pasteurization, primer/probe set, PCR platform, and matrix spike surrogate selection—were
evaluated.

4.1 Reproducibility
The reproducibility of the methods was evaluated at three different levels: 1) across all method
groups, 2) within each method group, and 3) within each SOP.
Across all Methods
To evaluate the variability of the SARS-CoV-2 concentrations measured by the different SOPs,
the log-transformed N1 and N2 concentrations measured in the Plant 1 sample replicates (corrected
for recovery based on the OC43 matrix spike) were plotted in a box plot (Figure 1). The data
showing the uncorrected values can be found in the Electronic Supplementary Information (Figure
ESI-1). The majority of the SOPs had sufficient sensitivity to obtain quantifiable results for most
or all of the sample replicates performed for Plant 1 and Plant 2. Data that were below the detection
limit or that did not pass the quality control criteria were not included in this evaluation. 36 SOPs
at Plant 1 and 22 SOPs at Plant 2 passed the quality control criteria and had at least one sample
replicate with detectable concentrations (where methods processed both with and without
pasteurization were considered distinct SOPs). The variability, or reproducibility, of the different
SOPs was quantified by calculating the range in which 80% of the data fell. The 10th and 90th
percentile concentrations were 4.4-log and 6.7-log genome copies per liter (GC/L), respectively,
for the combined N1 and N2 datasets (shown as dashed lines in Figure 1). In other words, 80% of
the values from 36 different SOPs fell within a +/- 1.15-log band (2.3-log range). While a similar
degree of reproducibility was observed at Plant 2, fewer SOPs were tested since those evaluating
the impact of pasteurization only processed the Plant 1 sample and a greater percentage of the
samples that were processed resulted in NDs (data not shown).

each SOP. NDs and data excluded based on the quality control criteria are not plotted. The dashed lines
show 10th and 90th percentiles across all N1 and N2 results.

In contrast, the recovery efficiency of the SOPs spanned seven orders of magnitude (Figure 2).
Correcting for this source of methodological variability allowed the recovery-corrected
concentrations to converge within a tighter minimum-maximum range than the uncorrected values
(uncorrected data shown in Figure ESI-1), highlighting the importance of correcting for recovery
in obtaining reproducible results across SOPs.

by each SOP. The SARS-CoV-2 results from the SOPs highlighted are not represented in Figure 1 due to
the fact that the results were all non-detect (gray), the recovery was below the quality control cut-off of
0.01% (blue), or both (orange).

Within a Method Group
The reproducibility of SOPs within each of the eight method groups was evaluated (Figure 3). The
groups were based on the concentration step prior to RNA extraction—either (1) direct extraction
or concentration by (2) ultrafiltration, (3) HA filtration, or (4) PEG precipitation—and whether
solids were removed prior to concentration. The reproducibility within each method group was
quantified by calculating the 10th and 90th percentile for the corrected SARS-CoV-2 concentrations
from the replicates within each method group. Of the method groups with multiple SOPs, groups
3, 3S, and 4 had the greatest reproducibility with 10th-to-90th percentile bands of 1-log or less.
Method group 1 had the lowest reproducibility with a 10th-to-90th percentile band of 3.2-logs. The
factors leading to higher reproducibility within some method groups was not clear from the
analysis. Potential factors include features inherent in the methods that lend themselves towards
higher reproducibility or greater similarity of the SOPs within that method group. For example,
three laboratories in method group 4 used a very similar SOP and had been in communication with
each other prior to this study. The high reproducibility observed within group 4 suggests that
aligning the details of an SOP between participants and greater interlaboratory communication
may help to further improve the reproducibility of methods.
A box plot of the corrected SARS-CoV-2 N1 concentrations in eight method groups is shown in
Figure 3. Given the variability of the pooled samples within the method groups, the recoverycorrected results from the different method groups were not systematically impacted by solids
removal or concentration. Of the 28 pairwise combinations, only six had significant differences:
1S and 1 (p = 0.00047), 2 and 1 (p = 0.0028), 3 and 1 (p = 0.031), 4S and 1 (p = 0.0074), 2S and
1S (p = 0.013), and 3S and 2S (p = 0.0027). In other words, multiple methods led to similar results
if the results were corrected for recovery. Similar trends were observed at Plant 2 (data not shown).
Because only one or two SOPs were present in method groups 1S and 3S, the variability within
those groups was not as well characterized as the other groups. Further studies with additional
SOPs per group could be used to confirm the impact of solids removal and concentration steps.

each of the eight method groups (grouped by concentration step and solids removal). The number of
SOPs and total sample replicates included in each method group are shown at the top of the box plot.

Within each SOP
The reproducibility of each SOP was determined by calculating the standard deviation of the logtransformed results for the five replicates processed by the laboratory (Table 6). The precision of
the SOPs was high based on a median standard deviation of 0.13 for both the N1 and N2 targets at
Plant 1. The reproducibility with an SOP generally increased after correcting for recovery.

4.2 Sensitivity
The sensitivity of each SOP was evaluated by quantifying the theoretical limit of detection (LOD),
which was, in turn, a function of three variables: the recovery efficiency, the concentration factor
(CF), and the instrument detection limit of the PCR platform. The recovery efficiency for each
SOP was calculated as the percentage of the OC43 matrix spike that was detected by the method
(Figure 2). The concentration factor quantified the degree to which the SARS-CoV-2
concentrations increased as the raw wastewater was processed to produce the final RNA extract.
Concentrations factors were SOP-dependent (Table 3). The instrument detection limit is the lowest
concentration at which the PCR instrument can reliably distinguish a target signal from the
background. Rigorous methods for quantifying instrument detection limits have been described
previously16, but were not evaluated during this study. In lieu of this, a theoretical instrument
detection limit of one GC per 5 µl PCR assay was assumed.
These three factors were used to calculate the theoretical LOD for each SOP:

The theoretical LOD of the SOPs spanned more than six orders of magnitude (Figure 4). The high
degree of variability in LODs was due largely to the recovery efficiencies, which also exhibited a
similar range of magnitudes. The band defining the 10th and 90th percentiles spanned from a
theoretical LOD of 3.0- to 6.1-log GC/L. To understand the sensitivity of the methods to detect
lower concentrations than those present in the August 2020 wastewater samples, the log-difference
between the measured SARS-CoV-2 concentrations and the theoretical LOD was determined for
each SOP. The median difference across all methods was 0.8 logs, though some methods could
detect concentrations 2-log lower or more.
The variabilities in sensitivities can also be evaluated based on the frequency of sample replicates
with NDs at each WWTP. As anticipated, SOPs with higher LODs (lower sensitivity) tended to
have higher rates of NDs, and SOPs with lower LODs (higher sensitivity) tended to have fewer
NDs (Figure 5). Recall, the theoretical LOD is based on the observed OC43 recovery—the actual
SARS-CoV-2 recovery was not directly measured. Therefore, the fact that a strong relationship is
observed between the LOD and the frequency of NDs suggests that OC43 is generally providing
an accurate reflection of the relative SARS-CoV-2 recovery across different methods. It should be
noted, however, that other factors affecting OC43 recovery at each lab (e.g., sample-to-sample
differences, shipping effects, sample handling) may also contribute to the differences in the
calculated LODs.

The outlier shown in gray (SOP 3S.1) processed the sample using a different PCR platform to enumerate
OC43 and SARS-CoV-2.

To assess whether sensitivity was linked to methodological differences, the LODs for both
WWTPs were compared by method group (Figure 6). The LODs between method groups was
generally indistinguishable, partially due to the high variability of LODs within the method groups
with solids removal. In each of these solids removal groups, the large LOD range was driven by a
single SOP in the group with a high LOD, specifically, 1S.3(H), 2S.1, 3S.1, and 4S.8(H). These
SOPs all had NDs and/or recovery below 0.01%. Only three of the 28 pairwise combinations were
significantly different and all were associated with method group 2S: 2S and 1(p = 0.0011), 2S
and 3 (p = 0.0062), and 2S and 4S (p = 0.011). The SOPs with highest sensitivity were not all
associated with the same method group, meaning that multiple methods may be capable of
achieving high sensitivities.

4.3 Impact of Other Method Steps
In addition to the main method steps differentiating the SOPs in this study (i.e., concentration
step and solids removal), several other method steps were evaluated, namely heat pasteurization,
primer set, PCR platform, and surrogate used as the matrix spike.

4.3.1 Pasteurization
To evaluate whether heat pasteurization impacted the measured SARS-CoV-2 concentrations, five
labs used their SOPs to process 10 replicates of the same wastewater: five without heat
pasteurization and five with heat pasteurization conducted at 60°C for 60 min. Two-way ANOVA
showed a statistically significant (p = 1.5 x 10-13) but small increase (0.41-log for N1 and 0.31-log
for N2) in the corrected SARS-CoV-2 concentrations after pasteurization.

Figure 7. Impact of heat pasteurization on the log-transformed SARS-CoV-2 (N1 target) concentrations
(corrected for recovery efficiency) at Plant 1. Five sample replicates for each SOP, with and without heat
pasteurization, were performed.

4.3.2 Primer/probe set
To evaluate whether the selection of primer/probe set impacted the measured SARS-CoV-2
concentrations, all sample replicates were analyzed using both the N1 and N2 primer/probe sets.
Two-way ANOVA showed a significant (p-value of 10-8 for Plant 1 and 0.00042 for Plant 2) but
small difference between the results: N1 was 0.13-log greater than N2 at Plant 1 and 0.12-log
greater at Plant 2.
4.3.3 PCR Platform
To evaluate the impact of the PCR platform (quantitative PCR or digital PCR), the SOPs were
grouped by platform within each method group (Figure 8). There was an unequal distribution of
SOPs using quantitative and digital PCR across the different method groups. Of SOPs that passed
the quality control and had detectable SARS-CoV-2 concentrations, 22 used quantitative PCR and
eight used digital PCR; the eight SOPs that used digital PCR were distributed across only four of
the method groups. The low sample numbers and unbalanced datasets made it difficult to perform
a robust statistical comparison of the two platforms; based on the preliminary information, no clear
patterns emerged between the two quantification platforms. Previous studies have indicated that
dPCR may have advantages over qPCR in terms of increased sensitivity and resistance to
inhibitory substances17, 18. Additional studies would be required to further evaluate the extent to
which such differences exist for the SARS-CoV-2 methods.

target) concentrations (corrected for recovery efficiency) at Plant 1. The data are from 22 SOPs (93
replicates) that used quantitative PCR and 8 SOPS (39 replicates) that used digital PCR.

4.3.4 Matrix spike Selection used for Recovery Correction
The impact of matrix spike selection was evaluated by comparing the recovery of OC43 against a
number of alternatives (Figure 9). All but one of the surrogates (i.e., in vitro transcribed RNA used
in SOP 1.1) showed a statistically different recovery than OC43 (p <0.05), though the difference
between OC43 and the other surrogates varied. For example, the difference between OC43 and the
other betacoronaviruses—bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2—was
relatively small compared to the other surrogates (average of 0.35-log and 0.47-log higher than
OC43, respectively). One systematic difference was that OC43 was added upon sample collection
before shipment to the labs whereas the second matrix spike was added upon receipt by the
individual labs. A lower recovery for OC43 could be the result of decay that occurred in the sample
during shipment that was not accounted for by the second surrogate. In comparison to the other
betacoronaviruses, other surrogates had larger differences in recovery than OC43. For example,
enveloped bacteriophage Phi6 had a recovery that was 3.9-log lower than the OC43 recovery. It is
important to note that differences in surrogate recovery may be SOP-dependent, meaning that a
surrogate may behave similarly to another in one SOP but differently in another. These findings
suggest that multiple surrogates may be acceptable, but highlight the differences between some of
the commonly used selections.

Discussion

This study demonstrated that a diverse set of 36 methods was able to quantify the SARS-CoV-2
genetic signal in raw wastewater with a high degree of reproducibility. 80% of the data from the
eight different method groups fell within a band of approximately +/- 1-log GC/L. This finding
bodes well for the nationwide interest in tracking SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewater since a single
standardized method may not be critical for obtaining comparable results between laboratories.
Access to multiple, reliable methods may also increase the number of labs capable of participating
in monitoring efforts and provide resilience against supply chain issues that have beset these efforts
during the pandemic.
The findings also show, however, that methods-related hurdles remain before using the data for
watershed-based epidemiology and modeling (e.g., estimating incidence and prevalence). This end
use requires obtaining accurate information on the absolute concentration of SARS-CoV-2 genetic
material in raw wastewater in addition to other information such as fecal shedding rates as noted
below. Unfortunately, the accuracy of the methods—i.e., their ability to correctly quantify the true
number of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies—could not be assessed because the actual concentrations
in the raw wastewater samples were unknown. Despite the relatively tight band of results (80%
within +/- 1 log), this 2-log range may be too wide for estimating community infection since 2
logs represents the difference between 1% and 100% of the population being infected. Additional
data gaps must also be addressed for accurately modeling community infections including
information on a) viral shedding rates in feces during different stages of infection6, 19, 20, b) how
the genetic signal changes during travel through the wastewater collection system21-23, and c)
sewershed modeling to estimate travel time and dilution. Multiple efforts should be pursued to
address these knowledge gaps.
The findings are encouraging, however, for tracking changes or trends in virus concentrations. For
this purpose, the absolute numbers quantified are not as important as identifying when and to what
18

degree those numbers are increasing or decreasing24. The collection of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater
concentrations could be used in conjunction with clinical data to provide complementary
information on the extent of community infection and the effectiveness of public health
interventions. The data could also be used to identify “hot spots” within a collection system where
higher virus concentrations are measured 7-9. This knowledge could be used to trigger additional
investigations of the populations within that sub-sewershed to identify and respond to communities
experiencing higher infection rates. One benefit of this type of tracking is that the changes in
wastewater concentrations may precede the clinical evidence of infection by multiple days,
allowing for more responsive and focused public health interventions. A related use of this
approach is confirmation of ongoing low community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in areas, such as
small rural regions, for which testing rates are low. The use of wastewater surveillance as a sentinel
for community infection has been described in Utah and at the University of Arizona11.
This study’s findings would suggest that the same method or laboratory be used to assess the
SARS-CoV-2 concentrations over time at a given set of locations. For example, use Method A to
assess trends within the sewersheds in Region X over time rather than switching between Methods
A, B, and C over the monitoring period. Other regions (e.g., Region Y) could select different
methods, but should then use the same method over the entire testing period to facilitate the
tracking of trends. One exception to this may be cases in which multiple laboratories use a similar
SOP and have demonstrated a high degree of reproducibility across labs, such as SOPs 4.1, 4.2,
and 4.3. Given the high degree of intra-method reproducibility observed (standard deviation < 0.2
log GC/L), many methods have sufficient precision to sensitively detect when changes in virus
concentrations are occurring. Collecting samples at multiple locations will also help identify where
they are occurring.
Factors promoting reproducibility. The high inter-method reproducibility was the result of three
key factors: 1) the results were largely unaffected by methodological differences, 2) only data
passing all QA/QC checks were included in the analysis, and 3) the QAPP normalized the findings
to account for important sources of variability.
Minimal impact of methodological differences. The 36 methods were divided into eight groups
based on two major methodological differences: the presence or absence of both a solids removal
step and a sample concentration step. Based on this study’s findings, neither of these
methodological branch points caused a clear, systematic impact on the enumeration of SARSCoV-2 levels particularly after correcting for differences in recovery (see below). Additional work
is recommended to further confirm these findings, though the preliminary data suggest that these
differences are not important sources of variability.
Another positive finding was that the use of pasteurization prior to processing led to only modest
impacts on virus enumeration when recovery correction was incorporated. This variability of
approximately 0.3 to 0.4 logs may be acceptable, particularly if pasteurization pre-treatment is a
requirement for lab safety. Multiple participants in the interlaboratory comparison noted that their
institutions mandated pre-pasteurization (per CDC guidelines) to minimize the lab staffs’ exposure
to the infectious agents in the raw wastewater (both SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogenic viruses
and microorganisms). One concern was that pasteurization steps have been previously shown to
impact both the infectivity and genetic signal of other viruses when heated at 72˚C25. The QAPP

prescribed lower temperature, longer duration conditions for pasteurization (60˚C for 60 minutes)
since it was hypothesized that higher temperature, shorter duration conditions may have a greater
impact on virus fate26-29. Future studies could be used to confirm the range of acceptable
pasteurization conditions for SARS-CoV-2 samples.
The two primer sets developed by the CDC for clinical diagnosis were used in this study. While
the N1 primer set led to significantly higher concentrations than N2, these differences were
considered to be minimal (approximately 0.1 log difference) compared to the other sources of
variability. These findings suggest that future efforts may not need to evaluate both primer sets for
tracking wastewater concentrations of SARS-CoV-2. Reducing the number of total PCR reactions
per assay may be of particular interest for resource-constrained settings, though care should be
taken to ensure that primer/probe sets account for mutational changes in the RNA sequence. The
study also included methods using both qPCR and dPCR. Given the low number of dPCR methods
evaluated, there was not sufficient statistical power to compare the results from the two platforms.
Based on a preliminary analysis of the data, no clear pattern of differences emerged between the
two quantification platforms suggesting both may be acceptable for future monitoring.
Moving forward, additional elements could be specified in the QAPP that may further improve the
reproducibility across methods. For example, specifying the type of standards to be used and how
the samples are shipped and stored prior to processing may further control variability. The high
reproducibility between SOPs 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 also suggests that greater consistency between
SOPs and improved coordination between labs can further improve reproducibility.
Identification and selection of high-quality data. One of the key conclusions from this study is that
any future monitoring efforts that entail the use of multiple methods should impose a minimum set
of QA/QC requirements via a QAPP. The scope of the QAPP should cover the entirety of the
process from sample collection, shipping, and handling, to acceptable analytical methods, to
quality control requirements, data management, and validation. In this study, the QAPP ensured
that all split samples were homogeneously distributed and processed within a narrow, specified
window. This degree of detail was deemed critical to assess method reproducibility since some
preliminary data suggested that the virus integrity may decay relatively rapidly with time and
temperature11. Through the QA/QC requirements specified—including the use of non-template
controls, extraction controls, matrix spikes, and qPCR standards—a handful of data were flagged
and eliminated from the analysis (Table 5). By specifying these QA/QC requirements, data that
failed these checks were identified and justifiably eliminated from the dataset, allowing the team
to focus on methodological sources of variability.
Normalizing across methods. One benefit of a large interlaboratory method comparison is that it
provides an opportunity to compare methods in a setting where many variables are held constant.
One unexpected finding was the wide range of recovery efficiencies represented by the different
methods. More than seven orders of magnitude separated the methods at the extremes indicating a
more than 10 million-fold difference in their ability to recover the OC43 betacoronavirus from the
wastewater matrix. Because of this huge range, correcting based on the matrix spike recovery was
deemed critical since not correcting for this factor could lead to equivalent magnitudes of
variability. This recommendation is in line with recent work by Li et al. (2019).

One challenge with correcting for recovery is that it assumes that the matrix spike behaves
similarly to the target virus. Additional studies are needed to assess how well OC43 mimics SARSCoV-2 behavior in wastewater matrices, meaning that correcting based on OC43 (or any other
viral surrogate) may also introduce some degree of variability in the results. For example,
differences between SARS-CoV-2 and the matrix spike organism in terms of solids association,
thermal sensitivity, extraction efficiency and surface properties may lead to variability when
correcting for recovery after solids removal steps, pasteurization, and concentration methods,
respectively. Nevertheless, the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and OC43 are likely to have a
smaller net impact on the results than differences in recovery efficiency. The similarity in recovery
efficiencies of the three betacoronaviruses tested in this study (OC43, BCoV, and heat-inactivated
SARS-CoV-2) provides some assurance that OC43 may behave in a similar fashion to SARSCoV-2. In a post-study poll of the laboratory participants, 87% supported the practice of reporting
and correcting for recovery efficiency. Additional work to confirm the selection of matrix spike
organisms is recommended.
Evolving the Methods. Demonstrating the high degree of reproducibility between methods is an
important step because it confirms that multiple methods can be used to obtain similar results in
these complex matrices. This does not mean, however, that all of the methods are equally suited
for all future efforts. One of the most promising end uses for these methods is to track SARS-CoV2 concentrations in wastewater as a bellwether for community health. Ideally, methods employed
for such uses would have both high precision to identify upward or downward trends in the data
as well as high sensitivity to quantify concentrations in both epidemic (high community infection)
and endemic (low community infection) settings. To understand how the sensitivity of these
methods translates to potential application of this tool in endemic settings, the prevalence of
COVID-19 in Los Angeles County at the time of sampling was estimated. Assuming infected
individuals shed SARS-CoV-2 in in their feces for at least 27 days6, then 61,000 people with
confirmed infections were shedding SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater samples collected during the
study31. In a population of ten million people, this corresponds to 1 in 160 people. At this level of
community infection, nearly all of the methods were able to achieve quantifiable results of virus
concentrations. The degree to which the concentration in the wastewater (and consequently the
percent of the population infected) could decrease while still obtaining quantifiable numbers will
vary across the methods.
The methods showed a sizable range of theoretical limits of detection with most falling in the 103
to 106 GC/L range (in comparison, the measured SARS-CoV-2 were generally in the range of 104
to 106 GC/L). Methods with theoretical LODs as low as 102 GC/L were also identified that would
offer a 10- to 1000-fold improvement over those methods. Additional studies should identify the
methods best suited for tracking trends, particularly those that offer high precision, reproducibility,
and sensitivity. As the call for more expansive state- and nationwide monitoring programs
increases, methods that offer higher throughput and lower processing time may also rise to the top.
The findings can also be used to identify methods that are best suited for areas with greater resource
constraints, including those without the financial, technical, and material resources available in
large U.S. cities. Through this lens, methods that have lower material costs, fewer and simpler
steps, and require less specialized knowledge could offer important advantages. For example, the
direct extraction methods forego the use of downstream concentration steps eliminating the need

for filtration devices, centrifuges, and additional chemicals. Consequently, these methods may be
cheaper, faster, and easier to run. Further research is needed to show if these methods can also
provide sufficient precision, reproducibility, and sensitivity, to be the methods of choice for the
diversity of locations across the country and globe.

Conclusions

•

A nationwide interlaboratory comparison of methods for the quantification of SARS-CoV-2
genetic signal in wastewater showed a high degree of reproducibility. 80% of the results from
eight method groups (36 different methods) fell within a band of approximately +/- 1-log
GC/L.
Recovery-corrected results did not show a systematic impact from solids removal or
concentration method used. Additional methods steps that were evaluated (e.g., pasteurization,
primer set selection, and PCR platform) generally resulted in small differences compared to
other sources of variability.
Factors leading to greater interlaboratory reproducibility include a) the relative insensitivity of
the findings to methodological differences, b) the implementation of strict QA/QC
requirements, c) the use of a quality assurance project plan to normalize the findings and
account for important sources of variability, and d) implementing a shared SOP among
different laboratories.
The findings support the use of wastewater surveillance for tracking trends in the
concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 within communities. They also highlight methodological
challenges related to modeling incidence and prevalence.
Additional metrics should be used to select the best methods for future efforts including
method sensitivity, cost, equipment requirements, and simplicity.
