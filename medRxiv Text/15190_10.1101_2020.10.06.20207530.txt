Abstract
Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented public health
crisis, but its effect on suicide deaths is little understood.
Methods: We analyzed data from monthly suicide statistics between January 2017 and October
2020 and from online surveys on mental health filled out by the general population in Japan.
Results: Compared to the last three years (2017-2019), the number of suicide deaths was lower
than average during the initial phase of the pandemic but exceeded the past trend starting in July
2020. The source of the increase was mainly female suicides whose numbers increased by
approximately 70% in October 2020 (IRR: 1.695, 95% CI: 1.558-1.843). The largest increase was
found among young women (less than 40 years of age). Our survey data indicated that the status
of mental health among young women has been deteriorating in recent months, and that young
female workers were more likely than any other group to have experienced a job or income loss,
suggesting adverse economic conditions surrounding some of these individuals.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that continuous monitoring of mental health, particularly that of
the most vulnerable populations identified in this study, and appropriate suicide prevention efforts
are necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic.

INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented public health crisis that has
both physical and mental health consequences. Emerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19
pandemic severely affects the mental health of the general population.1,2 These findings correspond
with concerns that deteriorating mental health, in combination with higher unemployment rates
during the pandemic, have the potential to increase the incidence of suicide worldwide.3,4
Despite this risk, to the best of our knowledge, no peer-reviewed study has documented how the
COVID-19 pandemic has affected the prevalence of suicide at the national level by major
demographic groups, owing to the lack of reliable fast-reporting data. The present study examined
the suicide deaths and mental health status of the general population during the COVID-19
pandemic in Japan. We focused on Japan for two reasons. First, Japan has one of the highest suicide
rates among OECD countries.5 Its suicide rate (the number of suicide deaths per 100,000 people)
in 2018 was 16.5 and in that year, more than 20,000 people ended their lives by suicide.6 Thus, the
vulnerable population in Japan may be highly responsive to the pandemic-inducted crisis, which
could result in a rapid increase in suicide deaths. Second, Japan has rapid-release monthly suicide
statistics, which, in combination with our own monthly survey data, allow us to closely monitor
the status of the general population since the onset of the pandemic.
Japan had its first encounter with COVID-19 earlier than most of the rest of the world. The first
case was reported on January 16, 2020, followed by outbreaks on a cruise ship at Yokohama Port
in February 2020. The first wave of COVID-19 cases was observed in April 2020, and a second,
larger wave of cases started in July 2020. As of October 31, 2020, the total number of confirmed
COVID-19 cases was 91,329, and the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 was 1,754, or
13.95 deaths per 1 million people.7 The number of new COVID-19 cases in Japan is shown in
Supplementary Figure 1.
The Japanese government has imposed several measures to stem the tide of the pandemic. School
closure started in early March. The Japanese government declared a state of emergency in major
metropolitan areas on April 7, 2020, which was extended to the rest of the country on April 16.
Without introducing lockdown measures or strict domestic movement restrictions during the state
of emergency, authorities requested non-essential businesses to close or opt to work remotely.
Stores and restaurants were asked to operate for reduced hours. The state of emergency was lifted
on May 25, 2020.
METHODS
We analyzed the publicly available monthly suicide statistics tabulated by the National Police
Agency (NPA) and published by the NPA and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of the
Japanese government.8,9 The NPA suicide statistics are based on police investigations of suicide
cases. In Japan, the police investigate all suspected cases of suicide, and the agency records all
deaths that are determined to be suicide in its suicide statistics data. We used the agency’s monthly
tabulation between January 2017 and the most recent available data, October 2020 (as of
November 30, 2020). There are two types of NPA data: those tabulated based on the date that the

deceased was found and those tabulated by the date of death. We used the former, as these is the
most frequently updated data.
We examined the total number of deaths by suicide, the number of suicides by sex, age group (less
than 40 years, 40–59 years, and 60 years and older), and major occupation. We estimated the
following Poisson regression model:
('

!"#$#%&!,#,$ = ( )% %%,&'&' + ,! ,
%)(

where the dependent variable is the number of suicides in month m in year y for group g, where
. = 1, ⋯ , 12. %%,&'&' is an indicator variable for each month in 2020 (until October), where 3 =
1, ⋯ , 10 and its associated coefficient, )% , captures the difference in the number of suicides in
month k relative to the baseline period, which is the corresponding month in the last 3 years. The
month fixed effects (i.e., 12 indicator variables for each month), ,! , were included to capture the
baseline monthly fluctuations in suicide deaths. To facilitate the interpretation of the Poisson
regression results, we converted the coefficients to incidence rate ratios (IRR). This part of the
analysis used publicly available data; thus, no ethics approval was necessary.
In addition, we assessed the status of mental health among the general Japanese population by
using data from a series of monthly online surveys that we have been conducting since April 2020.
We selected the respondents from a commercial online panel so that they were representative of
the Japanese population in terms of sex, age group, and area of residence. Each monthly survey
contained 1,000 respondents. A more detailed description of the survey is provided in
Supplementary File 1. For the purposes of this study, we used surveys taken between April and
October 2020 (N=7,000).
As measures of mental health, we analyzed the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms,
measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire nine-item scale10 and the seven-item General
Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7),11 respectively. We also examined the self-reported change in
employment status of the respondents in the labor market to understand whether they had
experienced major job-related changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We asked about changes
in employment status only since June, and we used the data between June and October 2020, when
we analyzed the job-related changes of the respondents (N=5,000). We calculated the presence of
depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 10) and anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 ≥ 10) for all respondents, as
well as the percentages of those in the labor force who had lost their job, taken leave or been laid
off from work, or experienced significant reduction in working hours in the last 3 months, and
stratified them by sex and age group.
The survey was approved by the Ethics Review Committee on Human Research of Waseda
University (approval #: 2020-050) and Osaka School of International Public Policy, Osaka
University.

RESULTS
During our study period, the number of suicides recorded in the NPA data was 81,431, of which
55,963 cases were male and 25,468 suicide cases were female. The average number of suicides
per month was 1,732.57 (SD = 158.98), and the maximum number was 2,158 which was recorded
in October 2020.
The top panel of Figure 1 shows the IRRs for the months in 2020 when we used the number of
suicide deaths in Japan overall and by sex as the outcomes. The estimation always includes
indicator variables for each month, and thus, the baseline period is the mean of 2017–2019 in the
corresponding months. The number of suicide deaths in the two time periods is provided in
Supplementary Figure 2. The shaded area in the figure indicates the period of the state of
emergency. Starting in February, when the country had a major encounter with the disease with
the Diamond Princess case, Japan experienced a decrease in suicide deaths. However, the declining
trend observed in the early phase reversed in July and the IRR increased to 1.302 in October (95%
CI: 1.237–1.369). The source of the increased suicide cases was mainly female suicides; the IRR
for female suicides was 1.181 (95% CI: 1.079–1.292) in July, and it continued to rise until October
(IRR: 1.695, 95% CI: 1.558–1.843).
According to Figure 2, which reports the IRRs by sex and age group, suicide deaths by all
demographic groups exhibited the same trajectories, with an initial decline during the state of
emergency, followed by an increase starting in July. We observed the largest increase among
young individuals (less than 40 years old) for both sexes. In particular, the incidence of suicide
among young women was 1.648 and 1.956 (95% CI: 1.384–1.962 and 1.66–2.304) for August and
October, respectively. However, in October, suicides by middle-aged women (age group 40–59
years) also sharply increased (IRR: 1.955, 95% CI: 1.679–2.276).
Figure 3 reports the IRRs for the months in 2020 by major occupation categories. The number of
suicide deaths by occupation group is provided in Supplementary Figure 3. It indicates that
students and homemakers experienced the largest increase in suicides during the second phase of
the pandemic. Student suicides started to increase in June with its IRR peaked in August (1.915,
95% CI: 1.678–2.186). The increase was observed not just among middle and high school students;
the number of suicides by university students almost doubled in August and September 2020 (46
and 51 in 2020, respectively, the average in 2017-2019 in each month: 24). The incidence of
suicide among homemakers also increased starting in the summer months, with the IRR for
homemaker suicides rising to 1.873 in October (95% CI: 1.661–2.113). Among the employed, the
number of suicides started to rise in July and the IRR in October was 1.335 (95% CI: 1.271–1.402).
Figure 4 reports the percentages of those categorized as having depressive symptoms or anxiety
disorders according to sex and age group. The top panel shows the prevalence of depression based
on PHQ-9 score, and the bottom panel shows the percentages of those who were considered to
have anxiety disorders based on their GAD-7 score. Overall, relatively young individuals (those
less than 40 years old) were more likely to have depressive and anxiety symptoms than those in
older age groups. The June data reported the worst status of mental health for these relatively
young individuals, which was right after the state of emergency was lifted. Figure 4 also suggests

that the prevalence of depressive symptoms among relatively young women has been increasing
since July, with 31.08% of them (N = 148) being classified as depressed in October.
Finally, when we analyzed our survey respondents in the labor force who reported that they had
lost their job, taken leave/been laid off from work, or experienced a drastic decrease in working
hours over the past 3 months, stratified by sex and age groups, female respondents were more
likely to have reported changes in their employment status and working hours, with 21.37% of
them reporting such changes, compared to 16.25% of male workers. Among female workers,
25.24% of young individuals (less than 40 years old) reported drastic changes in employment and
working conditions, whereas the corresponding number for young male workers was lower at
17.01%. The full data are reported in Supplementary Table 1.
DISCUSSION
This study examined the monthly trajectories of suicide deaths in Japan during the COVID-19
pandemic. We found that the number of suicide deaths was lower during the initial phase of the
pandemic in 2020 than the average during the period of 2017–2019. Starting in July 2020, however,
the number exceeded the trend of the past 3 years. Across all age and occupation groups, the largest
increase was found among relatively young women, those aged less than 40 years old at the time
of their death. The prevalence of suicide among students and homemakers during the second phase
of the pandemic was also notably higher in 2020 than the monthly averages of 2017–2019.
Potential factors behind the large increases in suicide cases by women and young individuals
during the second phase of the pandemic include the economic consequences of the pandemic,
school closure, and media reporting of celebrity suicides. The economic damage of the current
pandemic was particularly evident in industries that are served mainly by women, such as the
service, retail, and travel industries.12 The labor statistics in October 2020 indicate that the number
of employed individuals in non-permanent positions, such as part-time or contract workers,
decreased for eight consecutive months from the onset of the pandemic. Between July and October
2020, the number of these precarious workers decreased by 4.59 million from the same months in
the previous year, of which 2.91 million were women.12 It should also be noted that the occupation
categories reported in the NPA data are based on the occupation at the time of death, and some
women might have been categorized as homemakers if they had lost their jobs prior to their death.
The results of our survey also revealed the unfavorable psychological and economic conditions of
young women. We found that the status of mental health among young women (less than 40 years
of age) was worse than that of women aged above 40 years, which may underlie their relatively
high suicide rate in the second half of 2020. Relatively worse mental health conditions among
young and economically vulnerable individuals were also reported in another study, in which other
attributes of the respondents were explicitly taken into account.13 In addition, we found that young
female workers were more likely to have experienced a job or income loss in recent months than
any other groups were, suggesting their adverse economic conditions.
The increase in student suicides might be associated with school closure and an unusual school
calendar in 2020. Schools in Japan closed around March 2, after the former Prime Minister, Shinzo
Abe, abruptly announced a request for school closure on February 27, 2020, and they did not

reopen until the state of emergency was lifted in late May. Thus, elementary to high school students
had to stay at home for almost 3 months. Emerging evidence indicates the negative impact of
school closure on students; a study conducted between June and July (after school reopening)
found that 72% of surveyed students (age 7–17 years) reported symptoms that indicated some form
of stress reaction.14
Returning to school after a long break is known to be difficult for some students even in normal
years, and student suicides have previously peaked on the first day of school after the summer
break, specifically on September 1.1 Elementary to high schools in Japan resumed in around late
May and reopened in August after a short summer break in 2020, which may explain the observed
increase in student suicides starting in June.
As for university students, most universities in Japan switched to online teaching when the new
academic year started in April, and largely stayed online during the spring and fall semesters.16 It
is possible that some university students were under distress because online and solitary learning
without on-campus activities continued for a prolonged period; 29.41% of the students in our
survey (N = 153) were classified as depressed, equivalent to the prevalence of depression
symptoms among those who had lost their jobs (Supplementary Table 2).
Media reporting on celebrity suicides might also explain some of the increases in suicide deaths
observed in this study. Several well-known individuals died by suicide during the pandemic; two
notable instances were the suicide death of a male actor, who died at the age of 30 years on July
18, 2020, and that of a 40-year-old actress on September 27, 2020. Both of them were at the peak
of their career and the media reporting on their unexpected suicide deaths might have affected
vulnerable individuals. The subsequent increase in actual suicides is known to be particularly large
when celebrity suicides are widely discussed on social media or when they are regarded as a
“surprise,”17,18 both of which are applicable in the abovementioned two cases.
Although the number of suicides started increasing in July 2020, Japan experienced a decline in
suicide deaths in the initial phase of the pandemic. The decline may be explained by enhanced
social connectedness during times of crisis. For instance, the level of social connectedness and
altruism is known to increase in the aftermath of natural disasters,19 and if natural disasters and the
current pandemic share certain similarities, then enhanced connectedness might have worked as a
protective factor with regard to suicide risks.
This study has several limitations. First, our analysis used provisional monthly data on suicide
deaths, which may be corrected upward in subsequent months. Thus, any reported decline should
be interpreted with caution. Second, our data on suicide deaths are aggregate in nature, because
the NPA does not release individual-level data; thus, our analysis could not control for the impacts
of confounders. Third, our online surveys relied on the commercial panel of respondents, who
were not randomly sampled from the general population. Thus, the survey data might not include
certain segments of the population.
Despite these limitations, the present study makes an important contribution to the scientific
community by reporting the trajectories of suicide deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and by
highlighting the most vulnerable populations during this unprecedented public health crisis. The

experience in Japan may provide valuable implications for other countries. Given that the most
affected industries were those mainly served by women in many other countries, it is likely that
women constitute one of the highest risk groups for suicide in those countries as well. Similarly,
since many countries also introduced school closures during the peak period of the pandemic,
future studies should investigate the impact of school closures on schoolchildren and university
students. The results of our study strongly indicate that continuous monitoring of mental health
and appropriate suicide prevention efforts are necessary during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Supplementary Information: Description of the online surveys
The status of mental health and economic conditions of the general population reported in this
study were based on a series of ongoing monthly surveys. We sampled our respondents from a
web panel of a major commercial survey company in Japan, the Survey Research Center. For each
survey, the company sent out screening questions to approximately 10,000 registered individuals
and then constructed a final sample of 1,000 respondents so that they were representative of the
Japanese population in terms of their sex, age groups, and areas of residence.
Each of the surveys was conducted on the following dates:
1st survey – April 16-18
2nd survey – May 15-17
3rd survey – June 17-19
4th survey – July 17-21
5th survey – August 24-26
