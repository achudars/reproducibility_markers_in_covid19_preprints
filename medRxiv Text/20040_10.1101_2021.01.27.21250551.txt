Prediction of province-level prevalence of covid-19 In Iran

Abstract
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become the greatest threat to global
health in only a matter of months. Iran struggling with COVID-19 coincidence with Nowruz
vacations has led to horrendous consequences for both people and the public health workforce.
Modeling approaches have been proved to be highly advantageous in taking appropriate actions
in the early stages of the pandemic. To this date, no study has been conducted to model the
disease to investigate the disease, especially after travel restrictions in Iran. In this study, we
exploited the opportunities that Artificial neural networks offer to investigate contributing factors
of early-stage coronavirus spread via generating a model to predict daily confirmed cases in Iran.
We collected publicly available data of confirmed cases in 24 provinces from April 4, 2020, to
May 2, 2020, with a list of explanatory factors. The factors were checked separately for any
linear associations and to train and validate a multilayer perceptron network. The accuracy of the
models was evaluated, the R2 scores were 0.842 for population distribution, 0.822 for health
index, and 0.864 for the population in the provinces. Our results suggest the significant impact of
the mentioned factors on disease spread in the time of travel restrictions when the vacation
ended. Accordingly, this information can be implicated in assessing the risk of epidemics and
future policy makings in this area.

Prediction of province-level prevalence of covid-19 In Iran

Introduction
In late January 2020, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from China became to be an
international concern(Anon n.d.). The virus rapidly spread across the world with more than 60
million confirmed cases in 218 countries. Despite all countries' efforts to mitigate the disease
spread through imposing travel restrictions and lockdown, due to the high transmissibility of the
virus(Sanche et al. 2020), many countries including Iran became afflicted within the first months
of the outbreak(Hamzelou 2020).
Iran is one of the first countries to confront the Coronavirus outbreak with a high number
of confirmed cases in the world. The government decided to close public places and cancel all
social events to mitigate the transmission. By early March all provinces were affected by the
pandemic which was just a few weeks after the first cases were reported in Qom (Venkatesan
2020). One great adversity faced during the pandemic was that the outbreak coincided with the
Nowruz holidays which led to a sharp increase in number of daily cases (Heidari and Sayfouri
2020). On March 27th in the middle of Nowruz vacations, Iranian authorities enacted travel
restrictions to reduce the transportation of COVID-19 carriers to each province. the delay in
decision making has been debated to be one of many reasons the disease spread rapidly across all
provinces(Abdi 2020)
Many factors have been known to be associated with the initial levels of the Coronavirus
outbreak at the country level including geographical factors(Sun et al. 2020), demographical
parameters (Dowd et al. 2020), healthcare services(Emanuel et al. 2020), and economic status
(Lai et al. 2020). Meanwhile, some research projects have been carried out to investigate the
early-stage dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran. For instance, (Dadar et al. 2020)
convey that there is a negative relationship between COVID-19 incidence and the relative

distance of provinces from Qom as the epicenter of the disease. Also, the study reported a
relationship between the elderly population with the outbreak. In another study, (Ahmadi et al.
2020) reported a direct relationship between population density and intra-provincial movement
with the infection rate of each province. This work also points out the weather impacts on the
disease infection rate. Acknowledging such factors would be of great help in foreseeing
inevitable conditions brought by epidemics in different climate zones.
Artificial Neural Network as a machine learning tool has been wildly used in studies to
forecast the outbreak due to its proven application in epidemiologic risk assessments(Manliura
Datilo, Ismail, and Dare 2019). (Car et al. 2020) has used a limited time-series dataset of
Coronavirus patients to obtain a quality neural network model of disease spread. In another case
in which artificial neural networks have become handy (Mollalo, Rivera, and Vahedi 2020), they
collected a wide range of relevant factors and employed a neural network model to forecast
COVID-19 incidence across the United States.
Interestingly most of the research studies in Iran were conducted during the period
before travel restrictions in which It was permissible for provinces to receive travelers from other
provinces. In this paper, we aim to generate a spread model of COVID-19 and investigate the
demographical and healthcare factors impact on disease incidence from April 4th to May 2nd in 25
provinces. To predict daily confirmed cases in the provinces, we collected potentially impacting
variables and employed a multi-layer perceptron network trained by publicly available COVID19 data from Iran authorities. This work would give a vision of the dynamic nature of this
epidemic in the early stages. Thus, both adopting policies and assessing mitigation strategies are
crucial in the future.

materials and Methods

data collection
The number of daily confirmed cases for the period from April 4, 2020, to May 2, 2020,
was obtained from the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education website. The dataset
shows the disease spread in provinces as time-series data. Due to the excess of missing values in
reported cases, seven provinces are excluded from the study. Demographic data and literacy for
each province were extracted from census data from the Statistical Centre of Iran
(www.amar.org.ir) Table 2. To avoid any underlying association of variables, men's population
divided by province populations was used. Since each province has medical infrastructures to
cope with COVID-19, Province-level healthcare infrastructure indices were extracted from
(Shojaei et al. 2020) to represent healthcare access and quality of each province. Incidence rate
per 100,000 residents during the study period (2 April until 4 May) with all variables is reported
for provinces. The geographical distribution of the confirmed cases and healthcare indices are
illustrated in Error! Reference source not found..

Statistical analysis
Data preprocessing is necessary to reduce the effect of outliers in analyses. All the
variables including population-based, health indices, literacy indices, altitude, and distance from
the epicenter, were normalized before the analysis. Any linear association between incidence rate
per 100,000 residents and the variables was measured via Pearson's correlation coefficient (r).
All analyses were performed using python version 3.8

Artificial neural network
Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a common network model for supervised learning
regression studies. It consists of input, hidden and output layers figure 1. In this study, the
capability of each variable as predictors is evaluated through the network model to predict new
COVID-19 cases of Iran provinces.
The variables table 1 was imported as neurons into the network via the input layer. These
values then were affected by weights of the connections and imported to the next hidden layers
which ended to produce the output variable in the output layer. The flexible ability of hidden
layers to recognize patterns in the data makes this machine-learning method superior to the
standard regression model.
To restructure the time-series dataset of confirmed cases to a supervised learning
problem, we used the sliding window method. An approximated window iteratively segments the
time-series data until optimal window size(m) with the least possible error is chosen. A matrix of
historical daily case data in all provinces is then retrieved to train the neural network. The output
variable, in this case, is province-level forecasted daily COVID-19 cases.
k-fold cross-validation technique carried out for model internal validity assessment. This
technique randomly partitioned the dataset to k subsets of equal size (in this case, k=10), which
was repeatedly used in training and testing to the point every subset served once to test the
model. The entire process was repeated 10 times. The result is then presented as the average of
achieved scores, with standard deviation noted.
A base model which only contains daily cases as input variables were defined to assess
the performances of neural network each time variables were added as an input to the model
figure 2. Root mean square error (RMSE) and the absolute fraction of variances (R2) metrics

were utilized to evaluate the performance of the model and to investigate the capabilities of
variables to predict the output variables. All the procedure was performed in the python
environment using scikitlearn library on a PC with a six-core 2.6 GHz processor and 16 GBs
RAM.

Results

Iran has a population of over 83,000,000 with a territory of 1,648,195 km2. All analyses
were carried out in the period of 4 April until 2 May for 24 provinces. Most cases were reported
in Tehran as a highly-populated and developed province.
The linear relationships between COVID-19 incidence and variables were investigated
Table 3. The results revealed that COVID-19 incidence in provinces has no significant
associations with either demographic variables or healthcare indices. Also, no statistically
significant relation was found between disease incidence in provinces with their Distance from
Qom as the epicenter of the disease (r = -0.26, p > .05).
A multilayer perceptron was used in the study. The optimal number of hidden layer
neurons was obtained by a trial-and-error procedure and selection was made based on the lowest
RMSE and highest R2 metrics. In the MLP model, 18 combinations of inputs were examined to
evaluate the performance of variables to act as predictors, each time they were added as an input
to the base model figure 2. Most accurate models were obtained when variables population
distribution(R2=84%), health index(R2=82%), and population(R2=86%) were added as an input
to the base model Fig 4.

Discussion

Coronavirus's early-stage spread was investigated in this study with the help of an
artificial neural network due to its proven potentials in epidemic forecasting. New Covid-19
cases were predicted with the use of daily diagnosed cases from 25 provinces of Iran from 2
April until 4 May, along with demographic and healthcare factors to discover new possible
influencers of the disease spread in the country.
The most notable variable is the distance from Qom which shows how provinces are
vulnerable to spread from the epicenter of the disease. It was shown in a study(Dadar et al. 2020)
in the earlier days of the outbreak, the distance was significantly associated with COVID-19
spread. Our study showed that no significant relationships existed in the observation period of
the study. One worth-mentioning issue is that the Nowruz holidays had a great impact on the
spread dynamics of the pandemic(Heidari and Sayfouri 2020). Our study was carried out in the
period after the holidays in which many travelers had contributed to rapid growth in daily
COVID-19 cases and disease spread across the country. This can be in tune with the postulation
that with the amount of time after all provinces are affected by the virus, especially after
holidays, the distance would not be a criterion for predicting the epidemic.
The study aimed to develop a COVID-19 spread forecasting model in search of variables'
contribution to disease prevalence. Models with high accuracy were obtained by taking
population, population density, and health indices to account as predictor variables in the neural
network. Thus, no direct relationships were found between population density or population with
the incidence rate of COVID-19, both factors were effectual in the increase of accuracy of our
predictive model. Also, Population density had been proved to be an effective parameter in the

outbreak as mentioned in (Ahmadi et al. 2020) in earlier days of the pandemic which could be a
sign of dynamic behavior of the pandemic.
In the course of our research, we faced some limitations mostly due to the lack of data in
the case of both variables and daily cases. Many factors may be involved in the virus spread
across the country which was not accessible at the province level. Also, we were not able to
verify our predicted data to the real data since the data was not published for provinces.
characterizing the main factors of the early-stage outbreak of such a contagious virus
provides opportunities to comprehend the early dynamics of the outbreak. Also, it could be of
great importance in confronting the future epidemics, in terms of taking preventive action or
implementing control measures by policymakers based on prior knowledge.

Fig. 3. Flow diagram of modeling process. Confirmed cases data is collected (A) and converted to a base
matrix, the matrix is then used to train the MLP(D) with a performance report (E). Each demographic
variable(B1) is added to base matrix in a loop like manner(F) to train the network(G) with a performance
report(H), the performances are compared to investigate the effects.
