ABSTRACT

Early detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been
proven crucial during the efforts to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several
diagnostic methods have emerged in the past few months, each with different shortcomings
and limitations. The current gold standard, RT-qPCR using fluorescent probes, relies on
demanding equipment requirements plus the high costs of the probes and specific reaction
mixes. To broaden the possibilities of reagents and thermocyclers that could be allocated
towards this task, we have optimized an alternative strategy for RT-qPCR diagnosis. This is based
on a widely used DNA-intercalating dye and can be implemented with several different qPCR
reagents and instruments. Remarkably, the proposed qPCR method performs similarly to the
broadly used TaqMan-based detection, in terms of specificity and sensitivity, thus representing a
reliable tool. We think that, through enabling the use of vast range of thermocycler models and
laboratory facilities for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, the alternative proposed here can increase
dramatically the testing capability, especially in countries with limited access to costly
technology and reagents.

INTRODUCTION

Since its emergence in Wuhan during December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide, affecting health, jobs, education and social
interactions of millions as well as countries’ economies 1. Government authorities across the
world have chosen different approaches to deal with this situation, often based on social
distancing and early detection followed by contact tracing. For the latter, and considering the
World Health Organization’s recommendations 1,2, the testing capacity has turned out to be a
limiting factor in numerous countries.
Given the prevalence of transmission by individuals which are asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic
or suffering from mild symptoms 3–6, expanding the testing capacity becomes critical in order to
rapidly detect and contain outbreaks. Initially, a testing strategy was adopted worldwide, which
combined column-based RNA extraction from naso-pharyngeal swabs with retro-transcription
followed by quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) using TaqMan fluorescent probes 7. However, the whole
pipeline is expensive, labor-intensive and requires specific qPCR equipment in terms of
laboratory facilities. These issues, combined with the dramatically increased demand in the early
days of the pandemic, resulted in testing bottlenecks that substantially delayed the tracking and
isolation of infected individuals. In peripheral countries, these shortcomings tend to be
amplified by economic struggling, shortage of key reagents in the international market and
limited laboratory and equipment capacities. With that in sight, diagnosis alternatives have
started to emerge, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-based assays, which
offers a rapid diagnosis when compared to TaqMan-based RT-qPCR and does not require
specialized detection equipment 8,9. Each alternative has different advantages and limitations,
such as laboratory infrastructure requirements for receiving and fractioning viral-containing
swabs, analytical sensitivity and convenience or necessity for multiplex-capable thermocyclers.
In this study, we describe the optimization of a series of custom and commercial DNAintercalating dye alternatives based on a previously described amplicon 10, including specific
reaction conditions for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, we show here that this
methodology is as sensitive and reliable for diagnosis as TaqMan-based RT-qPCR standards and
can be used in any qPCR thermal cycler.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLE COLLECTION AND FRACTIONATING
Swab samples were received by the Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas en Retrovirus y SIDA
(INBIRS, CABA, Argentina) and fractionated in a Level II Biosafety Laboratory. Anonymized and
randomized samples were either inactivated and transported to be extracted at Instituto de
Fisiología, Biología Molecular y Neurociencias (IFIBYNE, CABA, Argentina) or directly extracted
on site (as described).
TOTAL RNA EXTRACTION
RNA was extracted out of 300 µl of swab samples using a Chemagic 360-D automated
extraction equipment (Perkin-Elmer) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
RETRO-TRANSCRIPTION FROM TOTAL RNA
Unless specified otherwise, retro-transcription reactions were done using MMLV-RT following
manufacturer instructions (Invitrogen). A time-saving protocol was developed (thoroughly
described in Supplementary Table 1). Program: 37°C-20’; 70°C-15’, ran in a BioRad T100 thermal
cycler. For the qPCR, obtained cDNAs were diluted 1:10.
To ensure that reverse transcriptases (RT) from other providers (MMLV-RT and GoScript,
Promega) could be alternatively used, we tested them in parallel using the same retrotranscription program described above. In addition to these international alternatives, we also
evaluated a locally produced commercial RT, FLYE-Ultra Highway (INBIO Highway, Cat. N°
K1610). It is important to note that the program’s temperatures had to be adapted for this last
alternative: 60°C-20’; 95°C-15’.

PRIMER DESIGN AND RECOLLECTION
Since unspecific priming and/or primer dimer formation are the biggest challenge to overcome
when switching from TaqMan to unspecific DNA dye as the method of detection in qPCR, we
screened a vast set of custom designed and published primers 10. Custom designed oligos were
obtained using Beacon Designer Software (Premier Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA, USA) or
Primer3Plus 11. All candidate pairs were checked for dimer formation in both Thermo Fisher
Primer Analyzer and Beacon Designer. Off-targets were analyzed using Primer Blast 12. Finally,
the presence of common described mutations on the target sequence and cross-priming with
other coronaviruses was assessed with custom R scripts. We selected 10 candidates, depicted in
Supplementary Table 2, for further screening.
On the other hand, we selected two pair of primers targeting housekeeping human genes
(POLR2A and U1) commonly employed in our laboratory to be used as internal controls. Their
primer sequences can also be found in Supplementary Table 2.

PRIMER SCREENING
We screened the different primer pairs using a custom formulation for the PCR mix, containing
SYBR® Green (Invitrogen™ SYBR™ Green I Nucleic Acid Gel Stain, 10,000X concentrate in DMSO,
S7563 or SYBR Green I nucleic acid gel stain 10.000X, S9430, Sigma) as the intercalating dye.
Given that we expected these initial conditions to be a priori sub-optimal in terms of specificity

and efficiency, several minor adjustments were made (program settings, Magnesium/DMSO
concentration, among others) to obtain final working conditions (Supplementary Table 1). For
the screening, we used every primer pair and performed standard curves with serial dilutions
(1:4) from pooled positive samples (previously diagnosed using a commercial RT-qPCR TaqMan
Kit) and evaluated absolute cycle threshold (Ct) values, reaction efficiency, correlation between
expected and observed Cts, the number and position of peaks in the melting curves and
potential maximum threshold for detection due to unspecific amplification.
For the internal positive control of human RNA detection, serial standard curves were performed
(5 points, 1:2 from a pool of samples) to corroborate the selected housekeeping genes worked
efficiently and free of non-template amplification. The custom-made mix and the INBIO
Highway master mix were used for this purpose (see ahead for specifics on those mixes).

TAQMAN ONESTEP RT-QPCR
Following RNA extraction, detection of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material was performed using a
commercial TaqMan RT-qPCR Kit (DisCoVery Kit by AP Biotech, Ref: APB-COV19R2ROX). The
procedure
was
done
following
the
manufacturer’s
indications
(https://apbiotech.com.ar/pub/media/Content/Datasheet/APB-COV19R2ROX.pdf). Alternatively,
the GeneFinder RT-qPCR Kit was used for some experiments (REF: IFMR-45,
https://www.fda.gov/media/137116/download). All reactions were run in a BioRad CFX-96
thermocycler.
For the comparison between the published Charité protocol 7 and our modified method with
SYBR Green, we prepared a mix (Supplementary Table 1) based on Thermo Fisher/Invitrogen
SuperScript III OneStep RT-PCR System with Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase. The qPCR was
performed according to manufacturer’s instructions: 55°C-10’; 94°C-3’; (94°C-15’’ & 58°C-30’’)
45x. All reactions were run in either an ABI Quantstudio 3 or an ABI StepOnePlus.

SYBR GREEN ONE STEP RT-QPCR
The adapted Charité protocol for SYBR Green mix (Supplementary Table 1) was based on
Thermo Fisher/Invitrogen SuperScript III OneStep RT-PCR System with Platinum® Taq DNA
Polymerase. The qPCR program used: 60°C-10’; 95°C-3’; (95°C-15’’ & 60°C-40’’) 40x, melting
curve. All reactions were run in either an ABI Quantstudio 3 or an ABI StepOnePlus.
SYBR GREEN QPCR
All SYBR Green based mixes are thoroughly described in Supplementary Table 1. For every
reaction the qPCR cycling was done with a 95°C-15’’ denaturation step and 40 cycles of 60°C40’’ annealing/elongation, followed by a melting curve. The activation time was adapted to the
one recommended by the manufacturers of each mix or Taq Polymerase (Supplementary Table
1). The master mixes tested were: INBIO Highway qPCR Mix (Ref M130,
https://www.inbiohw.com.ar/es/productos/178591/pcr/Master-Mix-qPCR-con-SYBR.html), Solis
Biodyne 5x HOT FIREPol EvaGreen® qPCR Mix Plus and Biodynamics Real Mix Ref B124-100.
Two custom-made mixes were prepared using different Taq Polymerases (INBIO Highway TFREE Taq REF E1202, https://www.inbiohw.com.ar/es/productos/168157/pcr/Kit-T-Free-ADNpolimerasa.html, and Qiagen Hot Start Taq REF 203203).

A SARS-CoV-2 RNA standard was kindly provided by INEI-ANLIS Dr. Carlos G. Malbrán (Buenos
Aires, Argentina). This standard was quantified (4x106 molecules per µL) using the SARS-like
Wuhan, Iv-RNA E gene Standard; 1x108 copies/µL provided by the Pan American Health
Organization / World Health Organization. Serial dilutions (1:10) were done, starting from a
quantity of 4x105 molecules per µL and ending in 4 molecules per µL. Five µL of each dilution
were used in each reaction (as described before).

GENERATION OF A POSITIVE CONTROL FOR RT-QPCR
The positive control RNA was obtained by cloning a region of SARS-CoV-2 genome in the
plasmid pBluescript under the control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. To this end,
pBluescript KS+ plasmid was digested with BamHI and XhoI and gel-purified with an extraction
kit. In turn, the insert was generated by RT-PCR using samples of positive patients as a source of
SARS-CoV-2 genomic material. The primers (listed in Supplementary Table 2) included
restriction enzyme adapters (BamHI and XhoI within the forward and reverse primers
respectively) to allow cloning within the pre-digested pBluescript. Alternatively, the insert can be
generated by gene synthesis or PCR amplification of overlapping primers. The amplified region
must include the target sequence of the primers listed as RdRP. The PCR product was
subsequently digested with previously mentioned enzymes and ligated to the linearized vector
with T4 DNA ligase. The cloned products were transformed into DH5α E. coli, followed by
standard plasmid miniprep protocols. The plasmid constructs obtained were linearized with XhoI
restriction enzyme and incubated with T7 RNA polymerase for in vitro transcription. Finally, DNA
in the reaction was degraded by incubation with RNAse-free DNase I according to the
manufacturer’s indications. Total RNA was purified with AGENCOURT® RNAClean® XP
magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter) and quantified with a Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific) to be
used as a positive control RNA standard sample in RT-qPCR reactions.

RESULTS
SELECTION OF A PRIMER PAIR FOR SARS-COV-2 DETECTION
An initial screening was conducted with a set of candidate primer pairs (Supplementary Table 2).
We tested the different primer pairs on serial dilutions of a pool of positive samples (already
diagnosed using a commercially available TaqMan Kit) and no-template controls. We scored the
Ct value for each of these reactions and assessed the different primers for: amplification
efficiency, R2 for the linear regression of Ct vs. log(quantity), melting curves and the
amplification cycle at which unspecific PCR products start to be detected in the no-template
controls. Figure 1A shows the amplification and melting curves for each primer pair, and Figure
1B a summary of the data obtained. Based on this information, the RdRP primer pair was chosen
for further studies. Furthermore, an in vitro transcribed RNA was generated and used as a
positive control to monitor the quality of each RT-qPCR run. This is particularly relevant when
using custom-made mixes that, according to the preparation, could yield variable outcomes.
SYBR GREEN RT-QPCR AS A SUITABLE ALTERNATIVE TO TAQMAN RT-QPCR FOR SARSCOV-2 DETECTION
With the goal of providing experimental alternatives to the gold standard TaqMan RT-qPCR,
several qPCR mix options were tested. These all relied on either SYBR Green or Eva Green, as
alternative intercalating dyes, for the detection of the genetic material and ranged from onestep reaction mixes to two-step methods using a custom mix (see Materials and Methods). The
main objective was to facilitate a range of customizable solutions for specific needs that might
arise during the COVID-19 diagnosis pipeline. Additionally, we aimed at sorting them from the
most timesaving to the least, irrespectively of their cost and/or availability in the local market. To
cope with the main disadvantage of unspecific amplification observed when using intercalating
dyes instead of labeled probes, we defined the critical amplification cycle at which unspecific
PCR products were detected and set it as the cutoff cycle of our methods’ detection limit. While
we are conscious that this strategy impairs the limit of detection (LOD) marginally, it seemed
more reasonable to prioritize specificity in this context in order to diminish the occurrence of
false positives.
Firstly, we adapted the Charité protocol published by the World Health Organization (WHO) to
use SYBR Green instead of TaqMan probes 7. For this purpose, we evaluated the pair of RdRP
primers selected from the screening, added the dye and adjusted the cycling program and mix
composition (see Methods). Interestingly, there was a substantial increase in sensitivity when
using the intercalating dye compared to the TaqMan probes N and ORF1ab (Figure 2A), with an
average decrease in Cts of approximately 4 cycles, which allowed for every true positive sample
to be detected as positive. When comparing the limit of detection (LOD) of a SARS-CoV-2
standard RNA (see Methods), we found higher sensitivity when using SYBR Green rather than a
TaqMan-based approach with an amplicon in the same region of the viral RNA (using RdRP
primers and probe P1 7) (Figure 2B). We selected a Ct cutoff of 35, since it ensured full specificity
(Figure 2C and Supplementary Data 1). Consequently, the LOD for the SYBR Green-based RTqPCR with the RdRP primer pair is approximately 20 copies of viral genome (Figure 2B). Since 5
µl of RNA are used per reaction, this means that the intercalating dye method could detect as
low as 4 copies (c) of viral RNA per µl or 4000 c/ml.

Next, we decided to switch to a classic two-step RT-qPCR protocol to broaden the possibilities
of reagents to be used for the procedure. We tested the different qPCR mixes in a panel of
samples (38 - 156 samples) comparing in parallel with a TaqMan diagnosis commercial kit
(DisCoVery by AP-Biotech) as our gold-standard. By analyzing the overlap with this goldstandard and calculating the corresponding sensitivity and specificity values, we show that every
commercial qPCR master mix we tried (INBIO Highway Ref M130, Solis Biodyne 5x HOT FIREPol
EvaGreen® qPCR Mix Plus and Biodynamics Real Mix Ref B124-100 see Methods for details) and
two custom mixes (INBIO Highway Taq E1202 preparation and Qiagen Hot Start Taq 203203 see
Methods for details) proved efficient for diagnosis purposes (Figure 2C and Supplementary Data
1) with the proposed primers and qPCR program, an adjusting a specific Ct cutoff for each case.
Remarkably, none of the mixes showed an average Ct shift higher than 3 cycles (Figures 2C-D
and Supplementary Data 1) when comparing with the DisCoVery SARS-CoV-2 kit. As expected,
the decrease in sensitivity in the 2-step options is biased towards the samples with low amounts
of viral RNA, as measured by the DisCoVery SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR kit (Figure 2E). While this
would result in an increase of the number of false negatives, it would affect people with lower
viral load specifically, which tend to correlate with lower transmission 13,14. Furthermore, we
propose that this is a minor drawback if it is counterbalanced by a large increase in the testing
capabilities due to the higher availability and lower costs of reagents and the use of more qPCR
thermocyclers.
Lastly, four different reverse transcriptases were tested, and the RT procedure was simplified and
streamlined to be time saving and to reduce manipulation of samples (see Methods). Our results
showed that all the tested RT enzymes worked equally well (Figures 2F and G).

SELECTION OF A HUMAN HOUSEKEEPING GENE TO BE USED AS AN INTERNAL CONTROL
Two primer pairs, targeted to human POLR2A mRNA and U1 snRNA, were shown to work
adequately with the proposed mixes (Figures 3A-B). Thus, either one can be used as an internal
control for diagnosis.

DISCUSSION

The aim of this report is to provide alternative RT-qPCR approaches for diagnosis of COVID-19
caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We present
alternative strategies to the current gold standard (TaqMan-based RT-qPCR), mainly based in
intercalating dye-based detection. The key advantages of intercalating dyes (particularly SYBR
Green) are their wide availability, low cost, simplicity of use, wide range of thermocyclers
capable of detecting them and the and the easy ordering of oligonucleotides without the
requirement for labeled probes.
In that line, probably the most time-saving option that we favor would be to follow the Charité
protocol adapted for SYBR Green. Nevertheless, we decided to optimize different alternatives in
case that One-Step master mixes would appear out of reach either for their cost or due to
unavailability in local or regional markets. This might sound far-fetched in economically strong
countries but needs to be deeply considered for those peripheral countries struggling with
recession, shortages and lack of infrastructure. Consequently, we generated Two-Step protocols
that can be followed with commonly used reverse transcriptases (MMLV-RT) from different
vendors and a variety of qPCR mixes. For the former we tried four different RT brands, all of
which performed equally well, leading to the speculation that RT from additional vendors could
probably be used as well, after little experimental validation. Similarly, as long as the proposed
qPCR cycling program and pair of primers are used, all the qPCR mixes we tested, including a
very accessible custom formulation, proved to be useful for the described procedure.
The main limitation we encountered when switching to intercalating dyes for detection was
unspecific amplification. Unlike labeled probes, which have an extra layer of specificity, negative
samples analyzed with SYBR Green-based qPCRs may sometimes exhibit unspecific sigmoidal
fluorescence curves with high Ct values due to, for example, primer dimer amplification. While
the wide screening of primer pairs that we performed resulted in an amplicon where this issue
was greatly diminished, it came at the cost of analyzing and selecting a specific threshold to
consider a sample positive for each qPCR mix. The thresholds were selected to exclude Cts
arising from occasional amplification of negative controls (lacking any template). As described
above, this did not have a major effect on the sensitivity of detection. It is worth mentioning that
a negative result on this kind of test does not rule out completely the possibility of actual SARSCoV-2 infection. Other variables, like the progression of the disease at the moment of the swab
or the quality of the sample, also influence the final result of the test. A proper diagnosis must
take into account all these variables and not only the result of the qPCR.
The work presented here clearly broadens the possibilities regarding the use of reagents and
equipment. Furthermore, this method based on intercalating dyes displays similar diagnostic
power to widely used qPCRs based on labeled probes. Hence, combining these alternatives for
SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR with simple and accessible clinical sample and RNA
preparation methods, would render a significant improvement on testing capacities, specially of
low-to-medium income countries.

Figure 1.

Selection of a primer pair for SARS-CoV-2 detection. (A) Serial dilutions of a pool of positive

samples for each primer pair. Representative amplification (left panel) and melting curves
(middle panel) are shown. Corresponding RT-qPCR products were solved by gel electrophoresis
and representative images of positive samples (+) and negative controls (-) are shown (right
panel). (B) Summary of the data generated for selection of a highly specific primer pair. Ct: cycle
threshold. Amplification efficiency and R2 relates to the log-linear fit of the relation between
Relative quantity vs. Ct for known serial dilutions of a positive control. An amplification efficiency
of 100% represents a decrease of one Ct for a 1:2 dilution. Unspecific amplification: Ct of
amplification curves observed in negative controls (without template), probably due to primer
dimers.

Using an intercalating dye can yield similar sensitivity and specificity as TaqMan probes.

(A) Boxplot of the Ct shift for the SYBR Green RT-qPCR (RdRP amplicon) versus two different
TaqMan-based reactions (N and ORF1ab amplicons) using the Charité protocol. (B) RT-qPCR
amplification curves for serial dilutions of a SARS-CoV-2 standard RNA, from 4x105 copies per
µL (c/µL) to 4 c/µL, using either the unmodified Charité protocol (TaqMan) or the one adapted
for an intercalating dye (SYBR Green). (C) Summary of the performance obtained using the
different commercial and customized RT-qPCR protocols evaluated. (D) Ct values for each
sample (arbitrarily numbered) tested with every RT-qPCR protocol developed and optimized in
this work. Not all samples were evaluated with all protocols. Missing points represent negative
(not amplified) samples. (E) A drop in diagnostic sensitivity using two-step RT-qPCR approaches
is circumscribed to samples with higher Ct values. Table summarizing the sensitivity observed
using either the INBIO master mix or the custom-made mix when separating the positive
samples in terciles (T1-T3) according to the previously assessed Ct value using the RT-qPCR
DisCoVery kit (ORF1ab and N amplicons). (F) RT-qPCR amplification curves for either serial
dilutions of a pool of positive samples (top panel) or random samples (bottom panel), using four
different retro-transcriptases for cDNA synthesis.
