Abstract
A newly identified novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused numerous acute
respiratory syndrome cases in Wuhan China from December 2019 to Feb 2020. Its
fast spreading to other provinces in China and overseas is very likely causing a
pandemic. Since the novel coronavirus has been reported to be capable of
endangering thousands of lives, it is extremely important to find out how the
coronavirus is transmitted in human organs. Apart from fever and respiratory
complications, gastrointestinal symptoms are observed in some patients with
2019-nCoV but the significance remains undetermined. The cell receptor angiotensin
covering enzyme II (ACE2), which is the major receptor of SARS-nCoV, has been
reported to be a cellular entry receptor of 2019-nCoV as well. Here, to more precisely
explore the potential pathogen transmission route of the 2019-nCoV infections in the
gastrointestinal tract, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the colon
tissue of healthy adults and colorectal cancer patients of our cohort and other
databases. The data indicates that ACE2 is mainly expressed in epithelial cells of the
colon. The expression of ACE2 is gradually increased from healthy control, adenoma
to colorectal cancer patients in our cohort as well as in the external Asian datasets.
According to the expression profile of ACE2 in colon epithelial cells, we speculate
adenoma and colorectal cancer patients are more likely to be infected with
2019-nCoV than healthy people. Our data may provide a theoretical basis for the
classification and management of future 2019-nCoV susceptibility people in clinical
application.

Introduction
As one member of the family coronaviride, coronavirus are enveloped with
non-segmented positive sense RNA, which are broadly distributed in humans and
other mammals(1). Most of the coronavirus are harmless to human, except the beta
coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)(2, 3) and
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)(4, 5), which lead to
numerous lethal respiratory disease cases in the past two decades. In December
2019, a series of unidentified pneumonia disease outbreaks was reported in Wuhan,
Hubei province, China. In a subsequent pathogen identification process, 2019-nCoV
(2019 novel coronavirus) was identified from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of these
pneumonia disease patients(6, 7). This virus was identified as the cause of the deadly
pneumonia disease in human (7). As of Feb 11, 2020, China has reported more than
42747 confirmed and more than 21675 suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infections
across 33 Chinese provinces or municipalities, with 1017 fatalities. In addition, since
2019-nCoV is a novel coronavirus for human, there is no specifically effective drug for
the infected patients.
Recently, Huang et al. reported that one diarrhea case was found in 38 patients
with 2019-nCoV infections(8). In addition, some patients with diarrhea were constantly
diagnosed in subsequent newly discovered 2019-nCoV infected cases, which indicate
that 2019-nCoV may infect people via digestive systems. Although other groups have
shown ACE2 expression profile in digestive system and lung by single-cell
transcriptomes bioinformatics analysis from external datasets(9, 10)， unfortunately,
most data of these datasets are not from Asian adults. Therefore, to provide more
implications of viral transmission in clinical diagnosis and treatment, it’s urgent to
explore ACE2 expression in the digestive system of Asian people.

Results
To investigate the ACE2 expression pattern in the gastrointestinal tract of Asian adult
samples, we incorporated two public single cell RNA-seq data of colorectal cancer
(CRC) cohorts from GEO (GSE97693 and GSE81861) and one cohort from Renji
Hospital. We performed single cell analysis on 504 cells from GSE97693, including
485 cell from CRC (primary tumor) and 19 cells from healthy normal control (NC). We
observed that ACE2 is expressed in 38.5%(194/504) of all human colon cells. We also
observed that the ACE2 expressed cells were significantly enriched in tumors when
compared with healthy normal tissues (39.6% vs 10.5%, p <0.05) (Fig. 1 A-C).
Consistently, in GSE81861 dataset, ACE2 is expressed in 10.5%(62/590) of all
human colon cells. We also observed that the ACE2 expressed cells were significantly
enriched in colorectal tumors when compared with healthy normal tissues (12.5% vs
7.0%, p < 0.05) (Fig.1D-F). Those results intrigue us to investigated whether ACE2 is
also enriched in precancerous lesion of colorectal tumor, such as colorectal
adenoma(CRA). We performed single cell RNA profiling on the tissues from colorectal
cancer, colorectal adenoma and healthy normal control from Renji Hospital hospital.
Totally, 21,686 cells (4784 from CRC, 7130 from CRA and 9772 from NC samples)
were collected after single cell RNA-seq quality control (Fig.2A). The ACE2 expressed
cells were significantly enriched in CRC samples compared with CRA and NC
samples (5.15% vs 2.94% and 1.75%, p<0.05) (Fig.2 B, C). In consistent with
previous studies(9, 10), we also observed that ACE2 cell were mainly expressed in
epithelial cells which highly express EPCAM(Fig.2D).

Methods
Single cell sequencing
Single cell libraries were generated using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ library and gel
bead kit v3 from 10x Genomics. Libraries were sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000
System (Illumina) at Shanghai GeneGenery BioTech Co.Ltd with 150 bp paired-end
sequencing of reads. Gene counts were obtained by aligning reads to the hg38

genome (GRCh38) using CellRanger toolkit (version 3.0.2, 10X Genomics). The
unique molecular identifier (UMI) count matrix was converted to anndata objects
(version 0.6.22) using the Scanpy package v1.4.4 (pmid: 29409532). We utilized the
following procedure to control for data quality: cells with fewer than 200 genes, and
genes that are detected in less than 3 cells. Following the quality control procedure,
the dataset consisted of 21,686 cells expressing 22,760 genes. The filtered gene
expression matrix was normalized using Scanpy’s sc.pp.normalize_total function. A
single-cell neighborhood graph was computed on the 50 first principal components
that sufficiently explain the variation in the data using 15 nearest neighbors. Uniform
Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was run for visualization. Cell types
were annotated based on the expression of known marker genes.
External data sources: GSE97693 and GSE81861 were used for bioinformatics
analysis. The reads or fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM or
FPKM) or transcripts per million mapped reads (TPM) were retrieved from GEO
database(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). In GSE97693 dataset, only TPM data
were used for analysis.

Discussion
The upper respiratory, gastrointestinal and central nervous system are usually
the infection targets of coronavirus in humans and other mammals(11). A distinct
coronavirus SARS-CoV was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS)(2, 12, 13). This virus may destroy the upper respiratory
tract and damage the patient’s intestines by causing diarrhea(14-16). In December
2019, 2019-nCoV from the same family as SARS virus has been identified, and this
virus can also cause fever, lower respiratory tract infection and gastrointestinal
symptoms (17). The genome sequences of 2019-nCoV have been obtained by
next-generation sequencing from pneumonia disease patients’ samples, and the
spike protein of this virus was identified as well(17). This virus may directly bind the

angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), which was known as cell receptor for
SARS-CoV (6). In addition, 2019-nCoV is able to enter lots of mammal cells with
ACE2 receptor expression, but not cells without ACE2(6). Interestingly, 2019n-CoV
just specifically uses ACE2 to infect mammal cells, but not other coronavirus
receptor(6). Therefore ACE2 receptor may be the key component for 2019-nCoV to
infect human and transmit in the host body.
It is reported that ACE2 is highly expressed in the lung and other digestive tract
organs in public external databases(9, 10, 18). However, Asian adult data is rare in
these datasets. Here, we firstly proved that ACE2 is expressed in the colon epithelial
cells of Chinese adults. Furthermore, ACE2 expression is gradually increased from
normal colon epithelium, adenoma to colorectal cancer patients’ tissues. Based on the
expression of ACE2, colorectal cancer and adenoma patients are more likely to be
infected and injured by 2019-nCoV, than healthy people.
As an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) homologue(19, 20), ACE2 is a zinc
metallopeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I) and
angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin (1–9) and angiotensin (1–7), respectively(21).In
addition to being a functional receptor for SARS-virus to enter mammal cells, ACE2
contributes substantially to the efficiency of SARS-CoV replication as well(22).
Recently, 2019-nCoV was confirmed to share the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as
SARS-CoV(6). In addition, J. Byrnes et al. found that inhibition of ACE2 with GL1001,
which is a selective inhibitor of this enzyme significantly reduced DSS-induced distal
colon pathology, indicating that ACE2 may mediate the mucosal inflammation in
DSS-induced inflammatory bowl disease (IBD) of mouse(23). Inhibition of ACE2 may
increase the level of its substrates, such as gherlin and further block the production of
pro-inflammatory cytokines(24). In a recent clinical report, 2019-nCoV may cause
cytokine storm and multi-organ failure in severe pneumonia patients(8). Therefore, we
speculates that 2019-nCoV may interact with ACE2 receptor in gastrointestinal tract,
then further impair the intestinal mucous membrane barrier and increase the
inflammatory cytokines production. With the intensification infection of 2019-nCoV,
more inflammatory factors are produced, which eventually leads to a storm of

inflammatory factors. Therefore, it is possible to use ACE2 inhibitors to treat
2019-nCoV patients by blocking ACE2 receptor of the intestinal epithelial cells in
future clinical application.
In a word, our data support the intestinal tropism of the 2019-nCoV has some
implications on clinical presentation and viral transmission. ACE2 expression is much
higher in epithelia cells of colorectal cancer tissues than health control, which
indicates that 2019-nCoV may be more harmful to colorectal cancer patients than
health control people. Understanding of the tissue tropism of 2019-CoV on intestinal
cells may also help to elucidate the pathogenetic mechanism of this virus and possibly
help in the development of novel antiviral therapy. Future studies have to elucidate
whether the replication of 2019-nCoV is depend on ACE2 in host cells, and whether
2019-nCoV binding to a co-receptor in addition to ACE2 might be involved in the
specific infection of lung, gastrointestinal tract and other organs.
