ABSTRACT
The SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model, statistical approach to the parameter identification
and the official WHO daily data about the confirmed cumulative number of cases were used to
make some estimations for the dynamics of the coronavirus pandemic dynamics in Ukraine, Italy
and Austria. The volume of the data sets and the influence of the information about the initial stages
of the epidemics were discussed in order to have reliable long-time predictions. The final sizes and
durations for the pandemic in these countries are estimated.
Keywords: coronavirus pandemic, epidemic outbreak in Italy, Austria and Ukraine, coronavirus
COVID-19, coronavirus 2019-nCoV, mathematical modeling of infection diseases, SIR model,
parameter identification, statistical methods.

Introduction
Here we consider the development of epidemic outbreak in Italy, Ukraine and Austria
caused by coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) (see e.g., [1]). Some estimations of the epidemic
dynamics in these countries can be found in [2-7]. In particular, the final size of the epidemic in
Italy was calculated in [5]. Unfortunately, the real number of confirmed cases in Italy already
exceeds the saturation level predicted in [5] on March 27, 2020. In this paper we will try to clarify
the predictions for Italy, to estimate the final size and the duration of the epidemic in Austria and
Ukraine and to discuss the amounts of data needed for accurate long-term predictions. In this paper
we will use the SIR model [8–12] and the statistics-based method of parameter identification [11,
12].

the initial stage of epidemics used only for comparison with SIR curves, [1]

SIR model
The SIR model for an infectious disease [7-11] relates the number of susceptible persons S
(persons who are sensitive to the pathogen and not protected); the number of infected is I (persons
who are sick and spread the infection; please don’t confuse with the number of still ill persons, so
known active cases) and the number of removed R (persons who no longer spread the infection;
this number is the sum of isolated, recovered, dead, and infected people who left the region);  and

Table 2. Official cumulative numbers of confirmed cases in Italy, Austria and Ukraine used
for calculations, comparisons and verifications of predictions, [1]

The analytical solution for the set of equations (1–3) was obtained by introducing the function

V (t )  I (t )  R(t ) , corresponding to the number of victims or cumulative confirmed number of
cases, [11]:

F1 (V , N , )   (t  t0 )

Thus, for every set of parameters N,  ,  , t0 and a fixed value of V the integral (6) can be
calculated and the corresponding moment of time can be determined from (5). Then functions I(t)
and R(t) can be easily calculated with the of formulas, [11, 12].

Function I has a maximum at S   and tends to zero at infinity, see [8, 9]. In comparison, the
number of susceptible persons at infinity S  0 , and can be calculated from the non-linear
equation, [11, 12]:

S  ( N  1)e

The final number of victims (final accumulated number of cases) can be calculated from:

V  N  S

(9)

To estimate the duration of an epidemic outbreak, we can use the condition

V (t final ) =1

(10)

which means that at t  t final less than one person still spread the infection.

Parameter identification procedure
In the case of a new epidemic, the values of this independent four parameters are unknown
and must be identified with the use of limited data sets. A statistical approach was developed in [11]
and used in [5, 11, 12, 15] to estimate the values of unknown parameters. The registered points for
the number of victims Vj corresponding to the moments of time tj can be used in order to calculate

F1 j  F1 (V j , N , ) for every fixed values N and  with the use of (6) and then to check how the
registered points fit the straight line (5). For this purpose the linear regression can be used, e.g.,
[13], and the optimal straight line, minimizing the sum of squared distances between registered and
theoretical points, can be defined. Thus we can find the optimal values of  , t0 and calculate the
correlation coefficient r .

Then the F-test may be applied to check how the null hypothesis that says that the proposed
linear relationship (5) fits the data set. The experimental value of the Fisher function can be
calculated with the use of the formula:

F

r 2 (n  m)
(1  r 2 )(m  1)

(11)

where n is the number of observations, m=2 is the number of parameters in the regression equation,
[13]. The corresponding experimental value F has to be compared with the critical value FC (k1 , k2 )
of the Fisher function at a desired significance or confidence level ( k1  m  1 , k2  n  m ), [14] .
When the values n and m are fixed, the maximum of the Fisher function coincides with the
maximum of the correlation coefficient. Therefore, to find the optimal values of parameters N and

 , we have to find the maximum of the correlation coefficient. To compare the reliability of
different predictions (with different values of n) it is useful to use the ratio F / FC (1, n  2) at fixed
significance level, [15]. We will use the level 0.001; corresponding values FC (1, n  2) can be taken
from [14]. The most reliable prediction yields the highest F / FC (1, n  2) ratio.

Results for Italy
The first preliminary prediction for Italy was published in [5] on March 27, 2020. Its results
are presented in the first column of Table 3. Usually the number of cases during the initial period of
an epidemic outbreak is not reliable. To avoid their influence on the results, only Vj values for the
period March 5-22, 2020 ( 12  t j  29 , see Table 2) were used to calculate this first prediction. For
other predictions different values of the initial tj1 and final tj2 moments of time were used. They are
shown in Tables 3-5 together with corresponding number of observations n. The SIR curves for the
prediction No. 4 (calculated with the use of the recent Vj values without taking into account
maximum number of initial moments of time) are shown in Fig. 1. Markers represent the Vj values
taken for calculations (“circles”); for a comparison (“triangles”) and a verification of predictions
(“star”).
It can be seen that the real epidemic outbreak could start even in January 2020. Probably,
first cases of COVID-2019 infection were not identified and sick people were not isolated. It could
be a reason of the high saturation level of the epidemic (approximately 148,000 - 153,000 according
to the last predictions 3 and 4). The new cases could stop to appear at the moments of time 93 -99
(see two last values in the last row of Table 3). These moments correspond to May 25-31, 2020.
The average time of spreading infection 1/  could be estimated as 0.7-0.75 days (according to last
two predictions, see Table 3). By comparison, in South Korea was approximately 4.3 hours, [16].

For this country the results of calculations are shown in Table 4. Fig. 2 represents the results
for the prediction No. 2 corresponding to the highest value of F / FC (1, n  2) . It can be seen that
first cases of COVID-2019 infection were probably timely identified and sick people were isolated.
This may be a reason for much lower saturation level of the epidemic in Austria (approximately
12,000 - 13,000 according to the last predictions 2 and 3). The new cases could stop to appear at the
moments of time 62 -65 (see two last values in the last row of Table 4). These moments correspond
to April 24-27, 2020. The average time of spreading infection 1/  could be estimated as 0.44-0.47
days and is much lower than in Italy, but higher than in South Korea, [16].

Results for Ukraine
The results of calculations are shown in Table 5. Fig. 3 represents the results for the
prediction No. 6-1 corresponding to highest number of initial points which were not used for
calculations. Since the epidemic outbreak occurred later than in Italy and Austria, the number of
observations in Ukraine is lower and presented predictions have to be treated as very preliminary
ones. It can be seen that the first case of COVID-2019 infection in Chernivtsi was probably timely
identified and isolated. The epidemic outbreak was probably caused by other persons. Preliminary
estimations of the saturation level are approximately 1,700 - 2,000 (according to the last predictions
2-2, 5-2 and 6-1). The new cases could stop to appear at the moments of time 57-61 (see three last
values in the last row of Table 5). These moments correspond to April 19-23, 2020. The average
time of spreading infection 1/  could be estimated as 0.36-0.4 days.

SIR model characteristics.

Discussion
The accuracy of any mathematical model is limited. The used SIR model is not an exception.
The real processes are much more complicated. In particular, all the parameters in SIR model are
supposed to be constant. If the quarantine measures and speed of isolation change or new infected
persons are coming in the country, the accuracy of the prediction reduces. The accuracy of
predictions increases with increasing the number of observations. On the other hand, the need for
forecasts is reduced if an epidemic is stabilized.

Conclusions
The SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model and statistical approach to the parameter are
able to make some reliable estimations for the epidemic outbreaks. The accuracy of long-term
predictions is limited by uncertain information, especially at the beginning of an epidemic. The long

enough observations may eliminate the influence of the initial stage data and increase the accuracy
of predictions. Even at limited amount of data the SIR model can be used to estimate the final size
of an epidemic and its duration. The further course of COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine, Austria and
Italy will show the real accuracy of the proposed method.
