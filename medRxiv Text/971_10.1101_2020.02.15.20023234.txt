Abstract

26

Background: In March 2020, overall, 37,000 international students from the country at risk

27

of the 2019-novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection will arrive in Seoul, South Korea.

28

Individuals from the country at risk of COVID-19 infection have been included in a home-

29

quarantine program, but the efficacy of the program is uncertain.

30

Methods: To estimate the possible number of infected individuals within the large influx of

31

international students, we used a deterministic compartmental model for epidemic and

32

perform a simulation-based search of different rates of compliance with home-quarantine.

33

Results: Under the home-quarantine program, the total number of the infected individuals

34

would reach 24–53 from March 17–March 20, 50–86 from March 18– March 16, and 234–

35

343 from March 4– March 23 with the arrival of 0.1%, 0.2%, and 1% of pre-infectious

36

individuals, in Seoul, South Korea, respectively. Our findings indicated when incoming

37

international students showed strict compliance with quarantine, epidemics were less likely to

38

occur in Seoul, South Korea.

39

Conclusion: To mitigate possible epidemics, additional efforts to improve the compliance of

40

home-quarantine are warranted along with other containment policies.

BACKGROUND

46

Three major respiratory virus-related events have been observed in South Korea in the 21st

47

century: severe acute respiratory virus (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome, and the

48

2019-novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection, all of which are caused by members of the

49

coronavirus family. The first individual with COVID-19 infection in South Korea was

50

identified on January 20, 2020 and, the number of laboratory-confirmed cases increased

51

between then and February 12, 2020 [1]. To reduce the number of individuals entering South

52

Korea who may have been exposed to COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, an international travel

53

ban from Hubei Province, China to South Korea was implemented on February 3, 2020

54

(Figure 1) [2]. Furthermore, to identify individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-

55

19, the South Korean public health authority implemented a quarantine program. Any persons

56

who have travelled from a country with COVID-19 infection risk within the previous 14 days

57

or have been in contact with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection within the previous

58

14 days is defined as an individual for quarantine [3]. Quarantined individuals are asked to

59

comply with home-quarantine and are monitored by local public health workers twice a day

60

for 14 days after contact with individuals with infection [3].

61

On February 14, 2020, the South Korean public health authority identified an

62

individual with COVID-19 infection; the patient had been contacted by another individual

63

who was suspected of avoiding the quarantine program during his period of home-quarantine

64

[4]. According to previous literature, the effectiveness of quarantine varies widely depending

65

on individuals’ daily motility patterns [5]; Despite this compliance with home-quarantine in

66

the present instance is still in question.

67

It is important to note that 37,000 students from China, where major cities are likely

68

experiencing localized outbreaks [6], will enter Seoul, South Korea, on March 1, 2020 at the

start of the spring semester. This large number of incoming youths from the country with

70

COVID-19 infection risk may increase the risk of local transmission in South Korea.

71

In this study, we aimed to estimate the number of infected individuals in Seoul, South Korea,

72

based on compliance with home-quarantine among these incoming international students.

73
74

METHODS

75

To simulate possible epidemics, we used the deterministic compartmental model of the

76

susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed type (see the Supplementary Appendix). We

77

assumed that the population mixed homogeneously, and that no COVID-19 transmission had

78

occurred within the community in Seoul, South Korea. We assumed that either 0.1%, 0.2%,

79

or 1% of the incoming international students were in the pre-infectious period of COVID-19

80

infection, based on previous literature reporting that 0.2% of individuals with contactees of

81

SARS infection were asymptomatic [7]. We also assumed that the international students

82

would arrive in Seoul, South Korea in the 15 days before and after March 1, 2020, and that

83

no individuals were isolated during entry screening upon arrival. Furthermore, we assumed

84

that all quarantined individuals were confined at home or to the university dormitory as per

85

the current South Korean quarantine program for COVID-19 infection implemented by the

86

local public health authority. The baseline scenarios were based on the currently identified

87

number of infected persons from China in South Korea, which was 12 on February 6, 2020,

88

with the assumption of 90% compliance with home-quarantine during the pre-infectious

89

period. Scenarios with different quarantine compliance rates (70%, 80%, or 90%) among

90

these international students were also modeled. We considered a time horizon of 180 days for

91

the number of individuals infected and quarantined since January 20, 2020, when the first

92

COVID-19 case was identified in South Korea. The parameter values of our model, obtained

from previous studies, are shown in the Supplement Material.

95

RESULTS

96

We estimated that the total number of infected individuals would reach 24–53 from March

97

17–March 20, 50–86 from March 18–March 16, and 234–343 from March 4–March 23 with

98

the arrival of 0.1%, 0.2%, and 1% of pre-infectious individuals, in Seoul, South Korea,

99

respectively (Figure 2).

100

We also estimated that the number of individuals isolated from the South Korean

101

quarantine program would peak at 24–47 from March 17–March 25, 48–77 from March 16–

102

March 28, and 225–305 from March 14–March 25 with the arrival of 0.1%, 0.2%, and 1% of

103

pre-infectious individuals in Seoul, South Korea, respectively (Figure 3). The number of

104

infected and isolated individuals would increase with higher proportions of subclinical

105

COVID-19 cases. However, the number of infected and isolated individuals was smaller due

106

to the high compliance of the quarantine program.

107
108

DISCUSSION

109

When no effective vaccine or treatment is available for infectious disease, the quarantine of

110

individuals suspected of having the infection, including those exposed to infection from

111

epidemic countries, has been used as a mitigation strategy by public health authorities [8, 9].

112

The number of laboratory-confirmed individuals with COVID-19 infection is

113

increasing in China and other Asian countries. In South Korea, the likelihood of local

114

transmission is increasing because travelers are arriving from COVID-19-affected countries.

115

The quarantine of individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19 is an efficient

116

public health strategy, to reducing transmission while using limited public health resources,

117

because the presence of individuals with unidentified infection is highly likely among

118

individuals exposed to the infectious diseases [9]. Therefore, the number of individuals with

119

infection can be estimated based on compliance with home-quarantine to provide relevant

120

evidence for public health authorities and to improve international students’ compliance with

121

the quarantine program in advance.

122

In South Korea, individuals who had contacted a person with infection were asked to

123

comply with home-quarantine and were monitored by local public health workers twice a day

124

for 14 days post-contact [3]. Individuals who were not included in the quarantine program but

125

had experienced any possible contact were encouraged to notify public health authorities and

126

submit to quarantine. All daily necessities were provided to all quarantined individuals by the

127

public health authorities to avoid possible contact with any susceptible population, as

128

indicated by the South Korean law. Therefore, the current quarantine program in South Korea

129

is very broad and includes a large number of people. However, to relieve the pressure on

130

public health resources, the quarantine program for incoming international students will be

131

monitored by the education authority [10]. This may affect the efficacy of quarantine and

132

increase the number of infected and isolated individuals.

133

Our findings indicate that most of the infected individuals isolated from the home-

134

quarantine program; Therefore, epidemics by incoming international students are unlikely to

135

occur in Seoul, South Korea; However, the number of infected and isolated individuals could

136

increase by mid or late March. Furthermore, the quarantine program may consume a large

137

number of public health resources because it involves monitoring quarantined individuals and

138

isolating infected individuals.

139

The present study had several limitations. Firstly, some parameters including the

140

latent period and rate of infection among those in contact with a person with infection were

141

obtained from the modelling studies of COVID-19 [6, 11, 12], and consequently may revise

142

the results. Secondly, we used a deterministic model, and can’t evaluate the uncertainty of

143

these estimates, which is an inherent feature and missed under current analysis. However,

144

allowing a search of different plausible values of these parameters through this model

145

simulation approach, ensures the reliable parameter estimates and able to mimic the future

146

dynamics of the number of infected individuals, which is much smaller than the total

147

population [13]. Thirdly, we did not consider transmission that occurred before symptom

148

onset and did not account for subclinical infection.

149
150

CONCLUSIONS

151

As public health resources are limited, quarantine of individuals who may have been exposed

152

to infectious disease is crucial for preventing local transmission [14]. Therefore, strict home-

153

quarantine of individuals from countries at risk for COVID-19 infection is important to

154

reduce the number of infected individuals and to prevent possible epidemics in the

155

community.
