abstract: "We create a dataset of all the papers published on bioRxiv and medRxiv between X and Y. We extract the text from these papers and parse them for keywords to do with the availability of data and scripts underpinning the paper. We find that X per cent of papers have X. Our paper demonstrates the need for Y."
