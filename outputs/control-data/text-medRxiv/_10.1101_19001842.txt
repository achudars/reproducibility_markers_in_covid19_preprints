Vitamin D and Systemic Cytokines

1

ABSTRACT.

2

Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in human populations and has been linked to immune

3

dysfunction. Here we explored the effects of cholecalciferol supplementation on circulating

4

cytokines in severely vitamin D deficient (blood 25(OH)D3 << 30 nmol/L) adolescents

5

aged 12-15 from Mongolia. The study included 28 children receiving 800 IU daily

6

cholecalciferol for 6 months spanning winter and spring, and 30 children receiving placebo

7

during the same period. The levels of 25(OH)D3 were assessed at baseline, three and six

8

months. Twenty-one cytokines were measured in serum at baseline and at six months. The

9

median blood 25(OH)D3 concentration at baseline was 13.7 nmol/L (IQR=10.0-21.7).

10

Supplementation tripled blood 25(OH)D3 levels (p<0.001) and reversed the direction of

11

change for most cytokines (16/21, 86%). Supplementation was associated with elevated

12

interleukin (IL)-6 (p=0.043). The placebo group had reduced MIP-1α (p=0.007) and IL-8

13

(p=0.034) at six months. These findings suggest that cholecalciferol supplementation and

14

seasonality have a measurable impact on circulating cytokines in adolescents, identifying

15

chemokines as potentially important biomarkers of vitamin D status in this population.

INTRODUCTION.
Accumulating evidence indicates that vitamin D has important non-skeletal functions,
particularly in the immune system (1-5). In particular, vitamin D deficiency has been

Vitamin D and Systemic Cytokines

associated with increased risk for diseases tightly linked to immune function, such as

2

autoimmune conditions and respiratory tract infections (1, 4-6). Notably, a recent meta-

3

analysis found that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced the risk of acute

4

respiratory infections most prominently in individuals with low blood 25(OH)D

5

concentrations (<25 nmol/L) (7), and in our earlier studies in Mongolian children, in whom

6

vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D3 <25 nmol/L or 10 ng/ml (8)) prevalence exceeds 80%, we

7

observed a significant reduction of acute respiratory tract infection associated with

8

cholecalciferol supplementation (9, 10). Similar observations were made regarding the

9

relationship of vitamin D and immunity to TB infection in other cohorts (2).

10

The in vivo effects of vitamin D on immunity are incompletely understood in the context

11

of different human populations and genetic backgrounds (3), although studies performed in

12

vitro and in animal models indicate that the nature of vitamin D effects on immunity is

13

context- and cell type-dependent. For example, vitamin D exerts stimulatory effects on

14

monocytes and macrophages inducing interleukin (IL)-1 production, while modulating

15

adaptive immune responses by increasing IL-10 production by dendritic and T cells (1, 5).

16

Given the protective effects of vitamin D against respiratory infections and the evidence

17

of the vitamin’s immune roles in vitro, here we tested the hypothesis that six months of

18

cholecalciferol supplementation in vitamin D-deficient adolescents would result in a

19

significant change in the circulating mediators of antiviral and antibacterial immunity.

of vitamin D supplementation on latent TB incidence in 120 Mongolian children

2

(ClinicalTrial.org ID: NCT01244204) (9). The screening and recruitment of participants

3

was described previously (9, 11). Briefly, children aged 12-15 years residing in

4

Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, were recruited. The study intervention consisted of

5

800 IU vitamin D or placebo (Tishcon Corp., Salisbury, MD) daily for 6 months from

6

November 2009 to May 2010, during the coldest 6 months of the Mongolian year. For the

7

current study 58 paired serum samples (baseline and six months) were randomly selected

8

from the parent placebo (n=30/59) and supplemented (n=28/61) groups. This study was

9

designed to supply pilot data for future immune studies in the same cohort, therefore no

10

formal sample size calculations were performed and sample size was determined based on

11

the available study budget. All study procedures were approved by the institutional review

12

boards of the Mongolian Ministry of Health, National University of Mongolia and the

13

Harvard School of Public Health (Ref. #16571). Written consent to participate was

14

collected from both children and their parents.

Blood (8.0 ml) was collected by venipuncture into red top tubes (Becton

proinflammatory (IL-17α, IL-23), regulatory (IL-10, IL-21) as well as Type I (interferon

2

(IFN)γ, IL-12) and Type II cytokines (IL-13, IL-4, IL-5) (see Supplementary Table 1 for

3

details) were measured at baseline and at 6 months using the Human High Sensitivity T

4

Cell Panel (HSTCMAG-28SK) on a MAGPIX instrument (EMD Millipore). All

5

experimental assays were performed by research personnel blinded to the supplementation

6

status of participants.

7

Statistical analysis.

8

Differences in demographic characteristics between the cholecalciferol supplemented and

9

placebo groups were assessed using Independent-Samples Mann-Whitney U and Chi-

10

Square Tests. Mean height-for-age and height-for-BMI z scores were calculated using

11

WHO Anthro software (12). Cytokine concentrations were Log10-transformed prior to

12

analysis to facilitate visualization, while hypothesis testing was performed on the original

13

(not transformed) data. Serum 25(OH)D and cytokine concentrations across study visits

14

were compared using paired t-test, while differences between the placebo and

15

cholecalciferol supplemented groups at each time point were assessed by one sample t-test.

16

To compare the cumulative change in cytokine concentrations between the supplemented

17

and placebo groups, we first calculated the proportion of cytokines that were found on

18

average increased or decreased at follow-up for each participant group (solid dots for each

19

cytokine in Figure 2), and then performed a Chi-Square test of the null hypothesis that

20

there was no significant change in cumulative cytokine concentrations between the placebo

21

and cholecalciferol-supplemented children. All statistical analyses and graphing were

22

performed using IBM SPSS V.23 (NY, US) and GraphPad Prism V.6.0. (CA, US).

RESULTS.

Participant demographics.

3

Samples from a total of 58 children were analyzed. At baseline the median serum

4

25(OH)D3 concentration was 13.7 nmol/L and basic socio-demographic characteristics

5

were not significantly different between the supplemented and placebo groups

6

(Supplementary Table 2).

8

Changes in systemic 25(OH)D3 concentrations.

9

First, we examined blood 25(OH)D3 levels at baseline (November) and three and six

10

months (February and May, respectively) (Figure 1). Children receiving placebo had

11

significantly reduced 25(OH)D3 in February (mean= 10.6 nmol/L, mean fold change

12

(MFC)=1.4, p<0.001) and an increase of 25(OH)D3 in May (mean= 23.2 nmol/L,

13

MFC=1.5, p<0.001) compared to November. On the other hand, children receiving

14

cholecalciferol exhibited an elevation of 25(OH)D3 in February (mean= 44.3 nmol/L,

15

MFC=3.1, p<0.001) and this increase was sustained in May (mean= 49.0 nmol/L,

16

MFC=3.5, p<0.001) compared to November. Compared to the placebo group,

17

cholecalciferol supplemented participants had significantly higher blood 25(OH)D3 levels

18

in both February (4.2-fold, p<0.001) and May (2.1-fold, p<0.001) (Figure 1).

Due to missing data, paired cytokine analysis was performed for 49 (27 placebo and 22

supplemented group, 85.7% (18/21) and 14.3% (3/21) of measured cytokines exhibited a

2

positive and negative change, respectively, while in the placebo group the mean difference

3

in cytokine concentrations was negative for 76.2 % (16/21) and positive for 23.8% (5/21) of

4

the assessed cytokines. Thus, cholecalciferol supplementation had a significant effect on

5

the cumulative change in blood cytokine concentrations compared to placebo (Chi-square

6

statistic= 16.2, p<0.001). The cholecalciferol supplemented group had elevated IL-6

7

(MFC=1.4, p=0.043) (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 1), while the levels of

8

chemokines MIP-1α and IL-8 were significantly reduced in the placebo group (MFC= 2.38,

9

p=0.007 and MFC=1.31, p=0.034 for MIP-1α and IL-8, respectively, Figure 2 and

10

Supplementary Figure 1). The mean cytokine concentrations did not significantly differ

11

between the placebo and supplemented groups at baseline or at six months.

12

14

DISCUSSION.
In this study the supplemented group’s 25(OH)D3 concentrations increased gradually

15

reaching 49 nmol/L at six months, while the un-supplemented adolescents remained

16

severely deficient with blood 25(OH)D3 levels remaining <25 nmol/L throughout the study,

17

linking the observed cytokine changes with the recent meta-analysis findings indicating that

18

25 nmol/L is a critical threshold of vitamin D deficiency associated with elevated risk for

19

acute respiratory infection (7). Interestingly, in May the placebo group had higher

20

25(OH)D3 concentrations compared to November, although these levels were still under the

21

critical threshold of 25 nmol/L (Figure 1)

22

23

Compared to baseline, six months of cholecalciferol supplementation resulted in a
cumulative shift toward elevation for a majority (~%86) of measured cytokines. This was in

Vitamin D and Systemic Cytokines

stark contrast with the effect seen in the placebo group, where compared to baseline ~76%

2

of cytokines exhibited a cumulative shift toward reduction, suggesting that vitamin D

3

deficiency could contribute to a gradual change of immune variables over winter. Further,

4

the vitamin D-deficient children had significantly reduced MIP-1α (CCL3) and IL-8

5

(CXCL8) concentrations at six months compared to baseline. This effect was not seen in

6

the supplemented participants, suggesting that vitamin D deficiency is implicated in the

7

reduction of these chemokines playing roles in leukocyte homing and activation and

8

mediating antibacterial and antiviral immune responses. Previously, vitamin D

9

supplementation in the context of chronic kidney disease was implicated in decreasing the

10

concentrations of another chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and our

11

findings provide further evidence for the role of vitamin D in chemokine homeostasis (13).

12

The increased IL-6 observed in the supplemented children is consistent with in vitro

13

studies showing that macrophages and monocytes up-regulate IL-6 expression upon

14

vitamin D stimulus (1) and IL-6 expression is up-regulated in the peripheral blood

15

mononuclear cells of vitamin D supplemented multiple sclerosis patients (14). At the same

16

time vitamin D supplementation was found to down-regulate IL-6 in some studies (15-18).

17

These seemingly contradictory findings regarding IL-6 and vitamin D could be attributed to

18

various confounders and differences among the studies, such as the duration and dosage of

19

vitamin D supplementation, the participants’ genetic background, underlying clinical

20

conditions and extent of vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency at baseline.

21

Our findings are consistent with other studies reporting an increase of IL-10 in vitamin

22

D supplemented individuals (19-21), as we also observed a strong trend to elevated IL-10

23

in the supplemented children. Somewhat surprisingly, we saw no change in IFN-γ in our

study, the Type I cytokine that was significantly elevated in vitamin D-supplemented US

2

and Mexican adults (19, 20), which could reflect the diverse effects of vitamin D in

3

different age and/or ethnic groups.

4

Our findings should be interpreted in the light of limitations. First, the study was

5

designed as a pilot with a small sample size, which must have reduced the power to detect

6

small differences in cytokine concentrations. The small sample size also limited our choices

7

for data analysis, and we were unable to employ multivariable modeling in this study. Our

8

analysis was also limited by the cytokine panel size and time points included in the study.

9

Lastly, we tested the effects of a rather conservative vitamin D regimen and future studies

10

should assess the effects of different supplementation protocols on systemic immune

11

mediators.

12

In summary, this study for the first time assessed the immune effects of cholecalciferol

13

supplementation in adolescents from North/East Asia. Although it is challenging to

14

differentiate between the effects of vitamin D supplementation versus seasonality, six

15

months of cholecalciferol supplementation had a perceivable impact on systemic immune

16

mediators in this population. Future studies should explore in more detail the utility of the

17

identified cytokines as biomarkers of vitamin D-mediated immune function and the

18

associations of the identified immune pathways with clinical outcomes.

Measurements were performed on serum samples from vitamin D3 supplemented (n=22)

13

and placebo (n=27) groups. Circles represent means of difference between Log-transformed

14

cytokine concentrations at the six-month follow-up visit and baseline. Bars are 95%

15

confidence intervals. Cytokine change is considered significant when its respective

16

confidence intervals are found entirely on the positive or negative sides of the x-axis and

17

are not spanning the “0” reference line. Stars denote cytokines (MIP-1α, IL-8, IL-6)

18

exhibiting statistically significant changes (p< 0.05)- see Supplementary Figure 1 for

19

participant-level data for these cytokines.
