Abstract
Background: There is growing evidence that polygenic risk scores (PRS) can be
used to identify individuals at high lifetime risk of coronary artery disease (CAD).
Whether they can also be used to stratify risk of subsequent events among those
surviving a first CAD event remains uncertain.
Methods: Using two subsamples of UK Biobank, defined at baseline as prevalent
CAD (N=10,287) and without CAD (N=393,108), we evaluated associations between
a CAD PRS and incident cardiovascular and fatal outcomes, during a median follow
up of 7.8 years.
Results: A 1 S.D. higher PRS was associated with increased risk of incident MI in
participants without CAD (OR 1.33; 95% C.I. 1.29, 1.38), but the effect estimate was
markedly attenuated in those with prevalent CAD (OR 1.15; 95% C.I. 1.06, 1.25);
heterogeneity P =0.0012. Additionally, among prevalent CAD cases, we found
evidence of an inverse association between the CAD PRS and risk of all-cause
death (OR 0.91; 95% C.I. 0.85, 0.98) compared to those without CAD (OR 1.01; 95%
C.I. 0.99, 1.03); heterogeneity P =0.0041. A similar inverse association was found for
ischaemic stroke (Prevalent CAD (OR 0.78; 95% C.I. 0.67, 0.90); without CAD (OR
1.09; 95% C.I. 1.04, 1.15), heterogeneity P <0.001).
Conclusions: Bias induced by case stratification and survival into UK Biobank may
attenuate, or reverse, associations of polygenic risk scores derived from case-control
studies or populations initially free of disease. Polygenic risk scores for subsequent
events should be derived from new genome wide association studies conducted in
patients with established disease.

Key messages
•

CAD PRS are positively associated with incident myocardial infarction risk
amongst established CAD cases.

•

However, the effect size is attenuated compared to estimates from CAD-free
populations.

•

CAD PRS are inversely associated with mortality and stroke risk amongst
established CAD cases.

•

These associations may reflect index event bias induced by stratifying on
case status.

Introduction
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is heritable, with over 300 independent
genetic loci with additive effects known to influence disease risk having been
identified in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) (1-4). Exploiting the
increasing amount of risk variation captured by identified loci, recent studies have
illustrated the potential use of CAD polygenic risk scores (PRS) for identifying
individuals at elevated risk of CAD (5-7), where the scores are based on counts of
the number of risk alleles carried.
However, the extent to which CAD PRS derived from general population
cohorts or case-control GWAS are associated with CAD disease progression, as
characterized by subsequent or recurrent events amongst diseased cases, remains
unclear. Indeed, established risk variants for onset of CAD may not necessarily
equate with variants influencing risk of subsequent events because of genuine
aetiological differences between the pathophysiology of the two states (8) (9).
Alternatively, even if variants influencing disease onset also genuinely influence
progression, associations may be distorted because of index event bias, where
conditioning on an index event (e.g. presence of CAD) may induce confounded
associations between risk factors in the sample of individuals with the index event
(10, 11). The lack of a strong association between the major CAD risk locus at 9p21
and subsequent event risk highlights possible differences in genetic associations of
CAD risk variants dependent on case status (12) (13).
Previous studies have found some evidence that CAD PRS are associated
with increased risk of subsequent events (e.g. recurrent MI and revascularization) (7,
14-19), although a recent study in a French-Canadian population found that CAD

PRS are substantially less effective at predicting recurrence and incident cases than
prevalence (7). Stronger conclusions have been limited by the modest sample sizes
of recurrence studies, with most previous studies including less than 5000 cases, as
well as the inconsistency of cardiovascular and fatal endpoints across different
studies.
Using two subsamples of UK Biobank, defined as individuals (a) free of CAD;
and (b) those with evidence of prevalent CAD at enrolment, we aimed to evaluate
the extent to which associations between CAD genetic risk variants and incident
events differ when restricting to a case-only sample while also running several
exploratory analyses to detect and account for potential index event bias.

Methods
Data sources
UK Biobank
UK Biobank is a large-scale cohort study, which recruited approximately
500,000 individuals aged between 40 and 69 years from across the United Kingdom.
Genotype data are available for the majority of participants with extensive phenotype
data collected via questionnaire at baseline. Study participants are linked to
electronic health record data from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), secondary care
data containing International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD10) and
Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Surgical Operations
(OPCS) codes relating to study participants diagnoses and operative procedures.
Study participants are also linked to the mortality register from the Office of National

Statistics (ONS) which contains data on death, time of death, as well as primary and
secondary causes (20).
For the purposes of this study, we used a sample of 408,480 individuals which
was generated by starting with the full sample and removing individuals of nonEuropean descent, individuals with more than 10 putative third-degree relatives in
the kinship table and individuals who were flagged in quality control (sex mismatch,
heterozygosity and individual missingness). We then defined two subsamples for our
analyses; a) baseline CAD controls, generated by removing prevalent CAD cases
(see below) and individuals that self-reported as having had a heart attack (Field ID:
6150-0.0, 20002-0.0) or coronary angioplasty/coronary artery bypass grafts (Field ID:
20004-0.0), and b) prevalent CAD cases identified using the following ICD10 (I21I25, Z955) and OPCS codes (K40-K46, K471, K49, K50, K75) from HES occurring
before their study enrolment date. In secondary analyses, CAD cases were stratified
into coronary artery disease with myocardial infarction (CADMI) cases (ICD10: I2123, I241, I252) and coronary artery disease cases with no evidence of myocardial
infarction (CADnoMI).
Phenotype data collected at baseline included sex, age, body mass index
(BMI) (Field ID: 21001-0.0), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (Field ID: 4080-0.0), selfreported type II diabetes (Field ID: 2443-0.0), self-reported smoking status (Field ID:
20116-0.0) and self-reported statin use (Field ID: 20003).
Incident events after recruitment into the UK Biobank were ascertained using
ICD10 and OPCS codes from HES using similar codes to published phenotyping
algorithms (21). Incident cardiovascular events of interest included: MI (I21-23, I241,
I252), heart failure (I110, I130, I132, I260, I50), ischemic stroke (I63, I693), stroke

(I60-64, I69) and revascularization (K40-46, K471, K49, K50, K75). Fatal events of
interest included cardiovascular (CVD) death, CAD death and all-cause death and
were ascertained using primary cause of death from mortality register data using ICD
codes for cause-specific mortality. Composite events of interest were combined CAD
death/MI and a combined variable including all cardiovascular outcomes. More
information on relevant ICD10 and OPCS codes are contained in Supplementary
Table 1.
UK Biobank study participants (N=488,347) were assayed using the UK
BiLEVE Axiom™ Array by Affymetrix1 (N= 49,950) and the closely related UK
Biobank Axiom™ Array (N= 438,427). Directly genotyped variants were pre-phased
using SHAPEIT3 (22) and imputed using Impute4 and the UK10K (23), Haplotype
Reference Consortium (24) and 1000 Genomes Phase 3 (25) reference panels with
post-imputation data including ~96 million genetic variants (26, 27).
CARDIOGRAMPlusC4D
CARDIOGRAMPlusC4D (28) is a global collaboration of studies using a casecontrol approach to identify genetic variants associated with the presence of CAD.
In this study, we used publicly available GWAS summary data from a recent
consortium study independent of UK Biobank (2), which were downloaded from the
CARDIOGRAM website (http://www.cardiogramplusc4d.org/data-downloads/).
Statistical analysis
CAD PRS
We used GWAS summary data from CARDIOGRAMPlusC4D to construct a
CAD PRS of SNPs. Initially, all SNPs meeting a P-value inclusion criterion (P<5x106

) were considered in order to generate a restrictive score containing only loci with

relatively strong evidence for association with CAD. Highly correlated markers were
then removed by LD clumping (R2<0.2, 250 kb distance threshold) the summary data
using PLINK v1.9 (29) and the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 (GBR samples) (25). The
final CAD PRS included 182 SNPs with the contribution of each SNP weighted by
the GWAS effect estimates.
CAD PRS and incident events
Associations between the CAD PRS and incident cardiovascular (stroke,
ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, revascularization), fatal (allcause death, CVD death and CAD death) and composite (all CVD, CAD death or MI)
outcomes were evaluated in the baseline CAD case and control samples. Logistic
regression was used to estimate associations, with all analyses adjusted for age and
sex. For comparison, we presented effect estimates in the two samples and tested
for heterogeneity between these estimates (30). As a sensitivity analysis, we
stratified the case only sample by type of CAD (CADMI / CADnoMI) and compared
estimates between the two samples with a test for heterogeneity. All estimates were
presented in terms of a standard deviation increase in the PRS.
CAD PRS and baseline covariates
Index event bias may lead to confounded associations between different CAD
risk factors (e.g. between CAD PRS and BMI) amongst cases which are not present
or are not as strong in samples of CAD free individuals. In turn, these may confound
associations between risk factors and subsequent events (31). Therefore, we
quantified and compared associations between CAD risk factors and the CAD PRS
in the case and CAD-free samples.

As covariates of interest we chose established risk factors for CAD available
in UK Biobank (age, sex, SBP, BMI, type II diabetes, ever smoking and statin use),
which were collected at study baseline. Linear or logistic regression models in R
v3.6.0 were used to estimate associations between the CAD PRS and covariates in
the baseline CAD case and control samples. Analyses with age and sex as the
phenotypes of interest were run unadjusted, with all other regression models
including age and sex as covariates. For comparison, we presented the value of
covariates of interest at quintiles (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%) of the CAD PRS distribution
and formally tested for heterogeneity between estimates for first and subsequent
events (30).
Accounting for index event bias
To evaluate the potential effects of index event bias on our analyses, we ran
sensitivity analyses using two different approaches. First, we repeated the CAD PRS
and incident events analyses in the baseline CAD case sample, including SBP, BMI,
type II diabetes, ever smoking and statin use as covariates. These CAD risk factors
were included as covariates to attempt to account for confounded associations
between the CAD PRS and these covariates relating to index event bias.
Second, we used a recently proposed method to correct for index event bias
in GWAS. SNP effects on prognosis (i.e. on events occurring after an index event)
are adjusted using residuals from the regression of the SNP effects on the index
event against the SNP effects on prognosis. The main caveat with the approach is
that it assumes that the direct genetic effects on incidence and prognosis are
independent (32).

In this instance, the index event is existing CAD so we used GWAS summary
data from the CARDIOGRAMPlusC4D GWAS (2). For a GWAS of prognosis, we
used the UK Biobank CAD case sample (N=10,287) to perform a GWAS of all-cause
mortality using a logistic model in snptest v2.5.2 (33), including age, sex and the first
ten principal components as covariates. As suggested previously (32), we then
extracted 116,438 independent SNPs common to both the CARDIOGRAMPlusC4D
and the UK Biobank GWAS summary statistics by restricting to well-imputed SNPs
(INFO>0.99) and LD pruning (250 kb step window, 5 SNP step size, r2=0.1) using
the 1000 Genomes GBR samples (Phase 3) (25) as a reference panel. These SNPs
were then used to calculate the slope correction estimate using the SIMEX (34)
option in the IndexEvent.R package with a Hedges-Olkin estimate calculated as a
sensitivity analysis. When applying this in practice, the SIMEX slope estimates did
not converge using all SNPs, even with 10,000 simulations, so we decided to reduce
noise by removing SNPs not strongly associated with the index trait and calculate
the slope using a subset of 5564 SNPs which were nominally associated with the
index trait in CARDIOGRAMPlusC4D (P<0.05).
Next, we adjusted the betas and standard errors in the UK Biobank GWAS of
mortality using the slope of the regression. For example, the adjusted betas were
calculated by subtracting the product of the slope estimate and the CARDIOGRAM
incidence beta estimate from the prognosis beta for each SNP. Finally, to estimate
the association between the CAD PRS and mortality amongst CAD cases from
summary data (instead of individual level data as previously), we used an inversevariance weighted method (35) (36) across 54 independent SNPs (28) using CAD as
the exposure and mortality as the outcome. The subset of chosen independent
SNPs reached genome-wide significance in the largest GWAS independent of UK

Biobank. Estimates were presented in terms of the association of an increase in the
CAD PRS, corresponding to an odds increase of CAD, with log-odds of mortality. For
comparison, we estimated the PRS association before and after correction.

Results
CAD PRS and incident events
Associations between the PRS and incident events differed greatly between
the two samples, with confidence intervals non-overlapping for eight out of the ten
outcomes tested (heterogeneity P < 0.05). In the CAD free sample, we found strong
evidence of positive associations between the CAD PRS and incident cardiovascular
and fatal outcomes such as MI (OR 1.34; 95% C.I. 1.29, 1.38), CAD death (OR 1.31;
95% C.I 1.23, 1.40) and ischemic stroke (OR 1.09; 95% C.I. 1.04, 1.15). In contrast,
in the prevalent CAD sample, we found evidence of a positive, but attenuated
association with MI (OR 1.15; 95% C.I. 1.06, 1.25; Int P=0.012), weak evidence for
an association with CAD death (OR 0.96; 95% C.I. 0.85, 1.08; Int P=9.1x10-6) and
evidence of inverse associations with all-cause death (OR 0.91; 95% C.I. 0.85, 0.98;
Int P = 0.0041) and ischemic stroke (OR 0.78; 95% C.I. 0.67, 0.90; Int P = 1.8x10-5)
(Figure 1 / Table 1). Amongst prevalent CAD cases, we did not find strong evidence
of heterogeneity by CAD subtype (CAD without prior MI, CAD with prior MI) with
overlapping confidence intervals across all outcomes (Supplementary Table 2).

CAD PRS and baseline covariates
The CAD PRS was inversely associated with age, BMI and smoking initiation
and positively associated with statin use in both samples, with some evidence of
larger effect sizes in the CAD sample for age (Int P=0.0064), statin use (Int P<0.001)
and BMI (Int P=0.011). In contrast, we found some evidence that the CAD PRS is
associated with increased SBP in those without CAD, but this association was
largely attenuated in the prevalent CAD sample (Int P=0.020). Similarly, the direction
of effect estimates differed between the two samples for type II diabetes with some
weak evidence of heterogeneity (heterogeneity P=0.053) (Table 2) (Supplementary
Figures 1-7).

1 Test for heterogeneity between regression estimates in prevalent case and control samples

Accounting for index event bias
First, we included CAD risk factors (SBP, BMI, smoking, diabetes) and statin
use as covariates in the model to account for potential index event bias. Although
estimates in general moved slightly closer to the non-case estimates from Table 1,
we did not find evidence of discernible statistical differences when including these
covariates (Table 3).

Second, we applied a method to correct for index event bias in GWAS (32).
The regression of genetic effects for prognosis on those for incidence generated a
positive slope estimate using both SIMEX (0.0655; 95% C.I. 0.646, 0.0664) and the
Hedges-Olkin estimator (0.0516). Prior to the adjustment using the SIMEX estimate,
a 1-unit odds increase in genetic liability to CAD was associated with reduced odds
of mortality (OR 0.76; 95% C.I. 0.65, 0.90; P=0.0018), directionally concordant with
the individual level data analysis which was scaled differently (see Table 1). After
correction, the association between the CAD PRS and mortality increased in
magnitude with a slightly more extreme inverse association, although confidence
intervals overlap before and after correction (OR 0.72; 95% C.I. 0.60, 0.85;
P=0.0001).

Discussion
In this study, we have demonstrated that associations of CAD PRS with
covariates and incident cardiovascular and fatal outcomes differ between those with
and without prior CAD. Notably, we found that associations of the PRS with risk of
future MI and CAD death were greatly attenuated among those with established
CAD, with some evidence of a positive association for MI but very weak evidence for
a positive association with CAD death, compared to those without CAD.
Furthermore, we found evidence for inverse associations between the CAD PRS and
all-cause death and ischaemic stroke amongst cases which were not present in
individuals without known CAD.
These findings could be partially explained by index event bias, whereby
stratifying on case status induces non-causal associations between genetic variants
and risk factors. For example, individuals with high genetic risk for CAD may develop

coronary disease despite low levels of conventional CAD risk factors such as
smoking and adiposity. Indeed, we found some evidence that higher CAD PRS are
associated with reduced BMI and smoking initiation in both samples, with more
extreme effect sizes observed in the case sample suggesting that attenuated
associations may be attributable to cases with higher genetic risk being otherwise
healthier. Similarly, another possibility is that bias may be induced by the selection of
study participants into UK Biobank; individuals with high genetic risk for CAD may be
more likely to die prior to being recruited into the study or decline participation for a
health reason. This possibility is supported by the inverse association between the
CAD PRS and age, again with a larger effect size amongst cases which suggests
that individuals with higher genetic risk for CAD may have increased mortality. A
further possibility is that the difference in associations are partially explained by
aetiological heterogeneity between CAD onset and progression, characterised by
differential drivers of stable and unstable plaque risk. However, it seems unlikely that
the observed protective associations of the CAD PRS with all-cause death and
ischemic stroke are explained by biological differences.
Medication use such as statins may also have contributed to the inverse
associations in individuals with prevalent CAD, with previous evidence suggesting
that statin use is more effective in those with higher genetic risk to CAD (19, 37).
This interaction likely relates to genetic overlap between CAD and LDL cholesterol,
the target of statins, with higher genetic risk individuals more likely to have elevated
LDL cholesterol. However, although statins may be more effective in individuals with
higher genetic risk that doesn’t necessarily equate to lower absolute risk amongst
individuals with elevated genetic risk, as our results imply for several outcomes.

Indeed, in one of the previously cited studies (19), individuals with higher genetic risk
were found to have increased mortality.
To investigate the potential effects of index event bias on our analyses, we
applied two distinct methods. However, the two methods shifted estimates in
opposite directions; adjusting for covariates moved the estimates towards the noncase sample estimates while the index event correction strengthened the inverse
association between the CAD PRS and mortality amongst cases. One possible
explanation for the increased inverse association after the index event correction, is
that the method assumes that the direct effects of prognosis and incidence are
independent. In the context of coronary disease, there are clearly factors which
influence both incidence and prognosis, such as LDL cholesterol, suggesting this
assumption may not hold.
Our findings have several important implications. First, although we did not
formally evaluate prediction metrics, the modest odds ratios observed suggest that
despite PRS positively associating with MI risk amongst diseased cases, existing
PRS are likely to have limited effectiveness for prediction of subsequent events and
therefore risk stratification in this setting (38). These findings imply that genetic
prediction of subsequent coronary disease events is likely to require dedicated
GWAS of coronary disease progression. Second, our findings contribute to the
existing literature (13, 31, 32, 39, 40) emphasising the caution required when using
genetic data to infer causality in the context of disease progression. Genetic
associations are generally thought to be causal by analogy with Mendelian
randomization (41) because of the reduced possibility of confounding and reverse
causation, but the observed protective associations of CAD PRS with mortality and
ischemic stroke suggest that this may not hold for case-only studies. Index event

bias has been shown to have modest impact on individual SNPs effects (39) but our
results illustrate that bias likely accumulates when combining multiple markers
together in a PRS, which could also affect Mendelian randomization studies. Third,
the observed associations between the CAD PRS and age across both CAD cases
and controls in UK Biobank suggest that potential bias from selection into UK
Biobank requires further investigation and consideration in genetic studies (10).
Our study has notable limitations. First, our analyses used only the UK Biobank
and require independent replication in different datasets and populations. Second,
we could not differentiate between the effects of possible biases and genuine
biological differences between onset and progression. Third, available biomarker
data including LDL cholesterol was not available in UK Biobank at the time of writing,
so we were unable to explore associations between the CAD PRS and CAD related
biomarkers. Fourth, other researchers have derived more accurate PRS from the
CardioGramPLUSC4D data than ours (5, 6); however, individual risk prediction was
not our goal, and given the positive association of our PRS with CAD incidence we
expect the same qualitative findings would result from PRS including a greater
number of weakly associated SNPs.
In conclusion, we have illustrated that associations between CAD genetic risk
variants and cardiovascular outcomes differ when examined in those with and
without prior CAD. This may be due to index event bias, although other possibilities
need to be explored. Future work, such as dedicated GWAS of disease progression,
by initiatives such as the GENIUS-CHD consortium (40) will aim to further explore
genetic differences between onset and progression of CAD.
