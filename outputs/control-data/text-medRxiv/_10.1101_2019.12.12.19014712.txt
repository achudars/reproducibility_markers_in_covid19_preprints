Abstract
Purpose – There remains an unmet need for preclinical models to enable personalized
therapy for ovarian cancer (OC) patients. Recently, patient-derived organoid (PDO)
cultures of patients with OC have been established that faithfully represent the
histopathological features and genomic landscape of the patient tumor. In this study,
we evaluate the capacity of OC PDOs to predict clinical drug response and functional
consequences of tumor heterogeneity.
Experimental design – 36 genomically characterized PDOs from 23 patients with
known clinical histories were exposed to chemotherapeutics and targeted drugs.
Results – OC PDOs maintained genomic features of the original tumor lesion and
recapitulated patient response to neoadjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel combination
treatment, according to distinct clinical outcomes (histopathological, biochemical and
radiological). PDOs displayed inter- as well as intrapatient drug response
heterogeneity, which could in part be explained by genetic aberrations. All PDOs were
resistant to PARP-inhibitors, in accordance with homologous recombination pathway
fidelity and genome-wide mutation context. KRAS, BRAF and NRAS mutation status
predicted response to BRAF-inhibitor vemurafenib and pan-HER-inhibitor afatinib, and
explained differential response among four PDOs derived from distinct tumor locations
of an individual patient. Importantly, PDO drug screening identified sensitivity to at
least one drug for the majority of patients (88%).
Conclusions – OC PDOs are a valuable preclinical model system that can provide
insights in drug response for individual patients with OC, complementary to genetic
testing. Generating PDOs of multiple tumor locations can improve clinical decision
making and increase our knowledge on genetic and drug response heterogeneity.

Introduction
Epithelial ovarian cancer (OC) is characterized by the development of
chemotherapy resistance and poor survival. Overall survival for patients with OC has
only slightly improved over the past decades, despite developments in the field such
as optimized surgical tumor resection, administration of (hyperthermic) intraperitoneal
chemotherapy and introduction of targeted treatments such as PARP-inhibitors (1).
While most patients with OC respond well to initial treatment, the majority will develop
recurrent disease within the first two years and become resistant to chemotherapy. In
the setting of recurrent disease, a wide range of chemotherapeutic and targeted drugs
is available. PARP-inhibitors are indicated for patients who experienced complete or
partial response to previous platinum treatment, irrespective of BRCA1/2-mutation
status (2–4). Still, BRCA1/2-mutation carriers experience more benefit from PARPinhibition compared to patients with homologous recombination (HR)-proficient tumors
(5). However, for the majority of relapsed patients and drugs, no genetic markers are
available to predict response. These patients might benefit from patient-derived model
systems that can be employed to test response to drugs prior to treatment in the clinic.
Traditionally, OC drug response has been studied in 2D-cell lines and
xenografts. 2D-cell lines offer a relatively cheap and quick model system, suitable for
high-throughput drug screening; while patient-derived xenografts offer the potential to
study tumor drug response in a living organism, but are not suitable for highthroughput drug screening experiments (6). In the past decade patient-derived
organoids (PDOs) have been established, a 3D-cell culture model system that
maintains cellular heterogeneity of healthy tissues and tumors. Recently, PDOs of OC
were established which represent the genomic features of the original tumors (7–9).
Furthermore, a drug screening comparison between 2D-cultures and PDOs of OC
revealed that cytostatic drug efficacy was dependent on the employed culture system;
PDO drug responses correlated better with genomic aberrations compared to 2D-cell
cultures (9). To employ the organoid system to guide treatment choice in the clinic, it
is vital that the correlation between PDO drug response and clinical drug response is
established. To this extent, prospective clinical trials have been performed with PDOs
of patients with colorectal cancer, in which in vitro drug screening recapitulated patient
response to chemotherapy and targeted drugs (10,11). For OC, we and others
previously provided anecdotal evidence on the correlation between clinical and PDO
drug response (7,8,12), but direct comparisons are still limited.
When predicting treatment response, genetic heterogeneity should be
considered. Epithelial OC, especially the high-grade serous subtype, is a
heterogeneous disease with widespread inter- and intrapatient genetic heterogeneity
(13,14). A virtue of the PDO model system is the possibility to study genetic and
phenotypic tumor heterogeneity (15).
In this study, we systematically assessed if in vitro drug response of OC PDOs
correlates to patients’ clinical response to chemotherapeutics. We studied inter- and
intrapatient drug response heterogeneity to a wide range of chemotherapeutics as well
as targeted drugs, and linked differential drug response to genetic variation.

Materials and methods
Patient inclusion, sample and clinical data collection
For this study we included patients with epithelial OC. Each patient signed informed
consent and was able to withdraw her consent at any time. Tumor samples, ascites
and blood samples were gathered between January 2016 and September 2019 at the
University Medical Center Utrecht, and Leiden University Medical Center, The
Netherlands. Patient data and tissue collection was performed according to the
guidelines of the European Network of Research Ethics Committees (EUREC)
following European, national and local law. The Institutional Review Board of the UMC
Utrecht (IRB UMCU) approved the biobanking protocol: 14-472 HUB-OVI. Clinical
data was collected from the patient files. Patient samples were derived at primary
disease during primary debulking surgery or interval debulking surgery, or adnex
extirpation procedures. Upon recurrence, tissue was collected during (laparoscopic)
surgery performed for treatment or diagnostic purposes, or ascites was collected
during palliative drainage procedures. For the comparison of PDO drug response and
clinical response, solely patients that underwent interval debulking surgery were
considered.
Organoid derivation and culture
Organoids were derived from tumor samples of patients with OC and cultured
according to our previously described protocol (7). PDO names are informative of
histological subtype, patient and tumor location. Histological subtype:
HGS/LGS=high/low-grade
serous
adenocarcinoma,
HG=high-grade
adenocarcinoma, SBT/MBT=serous/mucinous borderline tumor, MC=mucinous
adenocarcinoma, CCC=clear cell carcinoma, END=endometrioid carcinoma. The first
number indicates the patient, the second number indicates tumor location.
In vitro PDO drug response testing and data-analysis
PDO drug response testing was performed as previously described (7). In short, PDOs
were exposed to drugs in varying concentrations and to controls (DMSO, ABT263/navitoclax) for 120 hours in 384-well plates, after which ATP levels were
measured with the Cell-Titer Glo2.0 assay (Promega BV). All screens were performed
in technical replicates. Biological replicates were performed in a subset of PDOs and
drugs (supplementary table 6) to investigate biological variation. Results were
normalized to vehicle (DMSO = 100%) and baseline control (ABT-263/navitoclax 20
μM). Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6. Drug dose-response curves were
visualized using linear regression analysis (setting: log(inhibitor) vs. normalized
response -- variable slope; least squares (ordinary) fit; no constraints). Concentrations
where 50% cell viability (IC50-value) was reached were interpolated. The area under
the curve (AUC) was approximated between the lowest and highest concentrations
screened in the actual assay with the trapezoid rule for numerical integration.

Clinical drug response measures
Histopathological response was assessed with the chemotherapy response score
(CRS) after three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, according to the guidelines
described by Bohm et al (16). All available hematoxylin and eosin stained slides of
each tumor location from which we established PDOs were assessed for tumor purity.
The slide with the most tumor per location was subsequently blinded scored by two
certified pathologists (PvD, CV), as CRS-1 (no or minimal pathological response),
CRS-2 (appreciable pathological response) or CRS-3 (complete or near-complete
pathological response). In case of disagreement consensus was reached.
Radiological response was assessed according to the RECIST criteria for solid tumors
(version 1.1) (17). A score for each patient was obtained, from best to worst response:
complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive
disease (PD). Biochemical response was measured by assessing response and timing
of normalization (<35kU/L) of biomarker cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) (18). For
progression-free survival (PFS) a cut-off of six months was employed; since patients
with less than six months PFS are predicted to be resistant to subsequent platinumtreatment. For overall survival 17 months was taken as a cut-off, based on survival
data of a recent cohort of patients (2015-2016) with HGSOC stage IIIC and IV disease
by the Dutch Cancer Registration. Seventeen months after diagnosis, 50% of patients
with HGSOC stage IV were still alive (supplementary table 3).
DNA isolation and whole genome sequencing (WGS)
DNA was isolated with the DNeasy Qiagen kit (PDOs and blood samples) and
Genomic Tip Qiagen kit (tumor samples), supplemented with RNase treatment. Fresh
frozen tumor material obtained through biopsy procedures was processed with the
QiaSymphony DSP DNA kit for low input. For DNA library preparation, 500–1,000 ng
of DNA was used. Subsequently, whole-genome paired-end sequencing (2x 150 bp)
was performed on Illumina HiSeq X Ten and NovaSeq 6000 to a median coverage of
31X (range 24-45X).
WGS data analysis
WGS data were processed using the Hartwig Medical Foundation (HMF) somatic
mutation workflow. We installed the pipeline (v4.8) locally using GNU Guix with the
recipe from https://github.com/UMCUGenetics/guix-additions. Full details and pipeline

(https://github.com/hartwigmedical/pipeline). Briefly, sequence reads were mapped
against human reference genome GRCh37 with Burrows-Wheeler Alignment (BWAMEM) (v0.7.5a) (20). Indel realignment and base recalibration was performed with the
Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, v3.8.1) (21). Somatic single nucleotide variants
(SNVs) and small insertions and deletions were called with Strelka (v1.0.14) (22). The
functional effect of the somatic SNVs and indels were predicted with SnpEff (v.4.3)
(23). Somatic structural variants (SVs) were called with GRIDSS (v1.8.0) (24).
Copy number alterations (CNAs) were called with PURPLE (25). PURPLE also
assesses tumor purity. In case of low tumor purity, a quality flag was raised
(“NO_TUMOR”; supplementary table 9). For tumor samples MC-3.2, MC-3.3, MBT2.1 and MC-1.2, based on manual verification, a wrong ploidy level was automatically
selected by PURPLE. Therefore, and due to the impossibility of manually correcting
the ploidy selection in PURPLE, we ran Control-FREEC (v. 11.0) (26) instead on all
samples (tumor and PDO) from those patients. Telomeric and centromeric regions
were masked for visualization.
For samples CCC-1, END-1.1, END-1.2, HGS-22 and HGS-23 no normal reference
sample was available for somatic mutation calling. In these cases, germline SNV
calling was performed with GATK (21) and only SNVs with a “HIGH” or “MODERATE”
effect as predicted by SnpEff were considered. Similarly, germline SV calling was
performed using GRIDSS and SV calls were filtered against the SV Panel of Normals
from
the
HMF
analysis
pipeline,
which
can
be
found
in
https://resources.hartwigmedicalfoundation.nl. Since PURPLE requires tumor-normal
pairs, CNA calling for these five samples was performed individually with ControlFREEC (v. 11.0) (26).
Assessment of homologous recombination (HR) status
To identify HR-deficient samples, BRCA1 and BRCA2 as well as other genes in the
HR-pathway (BARD1, BRIP1, CHEK2, FANCA, PALB2, RAD50, RAD51(B/C/D)) were
assessed for biallelic inactivation, incorporating both germline and somatic WGS data.
Biallelic inactivation was defined as: a deep deletion (i.e. full loss of both alleles); or
Loss-Of-Heterozygosity (LOH) in combination with (i) a known pathogenic/likely
pathogenic variant according to ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/;
GRCh37, database date 2018-12-07), or (ii) a frameshift, nonsense or essential splice
variant as annotated by SnpEff (http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/; v4.1h). Additionally,
CHORD (Classifier of HOmologous Recombination Deficiency; Nguyen et al, in
preparation) was employed to classify PDO samples as HR-proficient or -deficient
based on the presence of genome-wide somatic mutation contexts (primarily deletions
with flanking microhomology and 1-100kb structural duplications). Samples without a
germline reference sample were excluded from CHORD evaluation.

The Drug Gene Interaction database (DGIdb) was utilized as a resource to obtain a
list of genes that have a known interaction with drug response (27). WGS data of
PDOs were checked for SNVs, SVs and CNAs in DGIdb genes, in case differential
drug response was observed within related PDOs. Homo-polymer regions were
excluded. To identify significantly amplified and deleted genes we applied stringent
criteria adopted from Priestley et al (19). An amplification was defined as [minimum
exonic copy number > three times the sample ploidy], while a deletion was defined as
[minimum exonic copy number <0.5 times the sample ploidy]. Related samples were
regarded genetically heterogeneous on copy number level, if they presented with
different copy-number states (amplified vs neutral vs deleted). Furthermore,
differential response among related samples was only considered if the ploidycorrected copy number levels were >10% apart.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics including mean, SD and SEM were conducted with R (software
package, version 3.5.0). The significance level for 95% confidence interval was set to
α=0.05. The Pearson correlation test was applied to evaluate the correlation between
replicate experiments. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied for the comparison
of clinical response groups. The means of two technical replicates of each sample at
all measured drug concentrations were compared between clinical response groups
(CRS-1 vs -2, RECIST SD vs PR, no CA-125 normalization vs normalization, PFS <6
months vs >=6 months, OS <17 months vs >=17 months). We corrected for multiple
testing with the Bonferroni method (alpha = 0.05 / 5 (tests)), resulting in a statistically
significant threshold of p=0.01.

Results
PDOs can be (rapidly) established from different OC subtypes
In total, we included 36 PDOs (of which 29 were established previously (7)),
derived from 23 patients with different histological subtypes of OC who underwent
primary or interval debulking surgery or ascites drainage (supplementary table 1).
PDO sample names are informative of histological subtype as well as patient (first
number) and tumor location (second number).The majority of PDOs in our biobank
were thoroughly characterized and biobanked prior to drug testing, to establish a
reliable platform. However, in order to incorporate PDO-based drug response
prediction in clinical care, PDO establishment and screening must be executed within
a short time span. As a pilot experiment, we successfully established and rapidly
screened organoids from a patient with recurrent disease (HG-26; supplementary
figure 1). Within 20 days of tumor collection the response to six therapies became
available.
PDOs retained genomic features of the original tumor lesion
First, we compared the genomic profiles of PDOs and the tumors they were
derived from. An average of 8,290 and 10,358 SNVs were identified in the parental
tumor specimen and their matched PDO, respectively. On average 67% of variants
were shared between the tumor and PDO, 6% of the SNVs were unique to the tumor,
and 27% to the PDO (supplementary figure 2). Assessment of CNAs demonstrated
comparable copy-number states in the majority of pairs (supplementary figure 3).
HGS-3.1, LGS-2.2 and MC-2.1 presented with a much higher number of SNVs than
their matched tumor specimen and considerable CNA dissimilarities within PDO-tumor
pairs. These exceptions are likely due to a high degree of normal cell contamination
in the tumor samples, which was confirmed by PURPLE, a purity ploidy estimator
(supplementary table 9) (25). In general, PDOs are enriched for tumor cells, whereas
tumor samples are heterogeneous, representing a mix of tumor cells and normal cells.
For tumor samples with sufficient tumor content, PDOs retained the genomic features
of the original tumor lesions.
PDO drug response correlates to patients’ clinical response
Next, we evaluated the potential of PDOs to reflect patients’ drug response to
chemotherapy. For this we selected all PDOs that were derived at interval debulking
surgery from patients with HGS OC, with known clinical histories (supplementary table
1 (clinical comparison) and 2). Seven PDOs (derived from five patients) were exposed
to carboplatin and paclitaxel combination treatment in vitro and we could directly
compare their response to the patient’s clinical response. Related samples HGS-3.1
and HGS-3.2 were most sensitive to carboplatin and paclitaxel combination treatment
(AUC=0.37 and 0.29), while HGS-24 was resistant (AUC=0.88) (figure 1). These PDO
drug responses showed a statistically significant correlation (p<0.01) with clinical
response as measured by histopathological (chemotherapy response score (CRS)),
biochemical (normalization of serum biomarker CA-125) and radiological (RECIST)

responses (figure 1; supplementary figure 4). PDOs derived from tumor locations with
no or minimal histopathological response (CRS=1) were less sensitive to carboplatin
and paclitaxel combination treatment compared to PDOs derived from tumor locations
with appreciable pathological response (CRS=2) (p=5.821e-05, Wilcoxon signed-rank
test) (16). Biochemically, clinical drug response is measured according to the
response criteria and timing of normalization of CA-125 (17,18). Even though all
patients exhibited CA-125 response during primary treatment, PDOs derived from
patients who did not reach CA-125 normalization during primary treatment were less
sensitive to the chemotherapeutics compared to PDOs from the patient in whom CA125 levels normalized (<35kU/L, p=0.0004). Radiological response was assessed
according to the RECIST criteria (version 1.1) (17), comparing imaging data at
initiation of chemotherapy to imaging data prior to interval debulking based on CTscanning. PDOs derived from patients with RECIST stable disease were less sensitive
to carboplatin and paclitaxel combination treatment compared to PDOs from patients
with RECIST partial response (p=0.0092). To compare long-term clinical response to
PDO response, recurrence and survival were assessed. All patients experienced
recurrent disease within four to 14 months after the last primary treatment, and 6month progression-free survival (PFS) did not correlate to PDO drug response. After
17 months 50% of patients with FIGO stage IV HGS OC are still alive (supplementary
table 3); only one out of five patients (HGS-24) in our cohort lived shorter than 17
months, and this PDO exhibited strongest resistance to carboplatin and paclitaxel
combination treatment.
PDOs exhibit interpatient drug response heterogeneity which correlates
partially with their genetic makeup
Next, we investigated the response of all PDOs (N=36) to a broader range of
drugs and drug combinations (3-19 per PDO, on average 13; supplementary table 5),
including chemotherapeutics and targeted drugs. Drugs were selected based on
clinical practice or evaluation in clinical trials for ovarian cancer or solid tumors in
general. Drug response experiments were performed in technical replicates and
replicate AUC values highly correlated (R²=0.87) (supplementary figure 5). PDOs were
considered resistant if the drug concentration that reduced viability of >50% of cells
(IC50-value) was higher than the concentration achievable in patient plasma
(concentration steady state, maximum concentration (Css/Cmax; supplementary table
4) (28,29).
Divergent responses were observed to chemotherapeutic drugs carboplatin
(platinum/alkylating agent), paclitaxel (taxane/antimicrotubule agent) and gemcitabine
(pyrimidine antagonist) (figure 2A-C; supplementary table 5). A minority of PDOs was
sensitive to carboplatin (7/31, 23%) and paclitaxel monotherapy (5/31, 16%), while
sensitivity to gemcitabine was observed in most PDOs (29/35, 83%). Response also
correlated with OC histological subtype, all LGS-samples showed resistance to
paclitaxel and carboplatin monotherapy (except for response to carboplatin in LGS3.1), while a sensitive response was restricted to HG(S)-samples. For certain PDOs,
combination treatment with two chemotherapeutic drugs resulted in lower IC50 values

compared to treatment with the single drugs (supplementary table 5). Our results, for
example, showed that carboplatin and paclitaxel treatment alone had minimal effect
on LGS-3.1 with an IC50-value of 1.46 and >2.5 log μM, respectively, while the IC50value of carboplatin and paclitaxel was reduced to 0.56 and -0.34 log μM in the
combination treatment.
The responses to targeted drugs revealed differences and similarities between
PDOs which in part correlated to their genetic makeup. For example, all PDOs were
resistant to the PARP-inhibitors olaparib, niraparib, and rucaparib (figure 2D-F),
consistent with the absence of biallelic inactivation of BRCA1 and BRCA2, and other
genes involved in homologous recombination (e.g. CHEK2, FANCA, PALB2, RAD50,
RAD51(B/C/D); supplementary table 8 and 9). Additionally, HR-classifier CHORD
(Nguyen et al, in preparation) classified all samples as HR-proficient based on
genome-wide somatic mutation contexts (supplementary figure 6). As expected,
BRAF-, KRAS-, and NRAS-mutant PDOs showed resistance to pan-HER-inhibitor
afatinib (12/25; figure 2G) and sensitivity to BRAF-inhibitor vemurafenib (5/7; figure
2H). Alterations in CDKN2A and XIAP, known to affect response to CDK-inhibitor
flavopiridol, were present in our cohort (30–32). CDKN2A was affected in the two
PDOs most resistant to flavopiridol: MBT-2.1 showed loss of both alleles and END-1.1
harbored a nonsense variant (p.(R58*); figure 2I), while copy number loss of XIAP was
observed in two of the flavopiridol-sensitive PDOs (figure 2I). Sensitivity to WEE1inhibitor adavosertib correlated with TP53 mutation status. All TP53 wildtype PDOs
(N=7) showed resistance, while TP53 mutants (N=15) were distributed among both
the resistant and sensitive PDOs (figure 2J). For the remaining drugs, alpelisib, AZD8055, MK-2206, and pictilisib, no known genotype and drug response phenotype
correlations were observed.
Subsequently, we evaluated for each individual patient how many of the tested
monotherapies (3-13 per patient) remained as potential treatments based on an IC50value smaller than the achievable concentration in patient plasma (Css/Cmax). In case
of multiple tumor locations per patient, all test results were considered. A predicted
sensitive response to at least one (and maximum five) drug(s) was observed for 88%
of patients, except for HGS-1-R3, MC-3 and HG-26 in which all of the 13, seven and
three tested monotherapies yielded a resistant response in at least one of their PDOs
(figure 3; supplementary table 5).
PDOs derived from individual patients revealed intrapatient drug response
heterogeneity
In addition to assessing interpatient drug response heterogeneity, we examined
intrapatient drug response heterogeneity. For seven individual patients, two to four
PDOs were derived from distinct cancer lesions at a single time point. For one
additional patient, three PDOs were derived at subsequent time points (supplementary
table 1, heterogeneity comparison). To set a threshold for differential drug response,
we first assessed the extent of biological variability. We observed low drug response
variability across biological replicates (N=84) with an IC50-value correlation coefficient
of R²=0.82 and mean IC50-fold change of 2.5±1.5 (range=1.0-7.3) (supplementary

figure 7; supplementary table 6), therefore, a ten-fold change in IC50-value was
chosen as a stringent cut-off for differential drug response.
While homogeneous responses were observed to a subset of drugs and drug
combinations; carboplatin combined with gemcitabine, adavosertib, or olaparib,
carboplatin, olaparib, niraparib, rucaparib, alpelisib, AZD-8055, flavopiridol, pictilisib,
and vemurafenib (supplementary figure 8), all related PDOs exhibited differential drug
response to at least one drug, as defined by a >10-fold change in IC50-value (figure
4). In the seven patients of whom multiple PDOs were derived at the same time point,
differential response to mono-treatment was observed 11/36 times (31%). Importantly,
in six cases, one of the samples yielded a sensitive response whereas a related
sample yielded a resistant response.
To examine the impact of intratumor genetic heterogeneity on phenotypic
heterogeneity, we assessed genetic variants in genes that are known or predicted to
interact with drugs according to the drug-gene interaction database resource (DGIdb;
supplementary table 7) (30). HGS-13.3, LGS-2.2, LGS-5.2, MC-3.1 and MC-3.2 PDOs
were markedly less sensitive to the pan-HER-inhibitor afatinib compared to their
related PDOs (figure 4F). Despite meeting the criteria of differential response, all four
BRAF-mutant LGS-5 PDOs were classified as resistant to afatinib with an IC50-value
above the steady state concentration of -0.8 log μM. The remaining related PDOs with
differential response (HGS-13, LGS-2, MC-3) were classified as both sensitive and
resistant to afatinib. We observed a direct genotype and drug response phenotype
correlation for the four PDOs derived from a patient with a mucinous OC (MC-3). The
two most resistant PDOs (MC-3.1 and MC-3.2) harbored a KRAS hotspot mutation
(p.G12V), whereas the other resistant PDO MC-3.4 harbored two different KRAS
mutations (p.L19F and p.Q61E, both reported to have an attenuated phenotype
compared to hotspot mutations (33,34) and the sensitive PDO MC-3.3 was KRAS
wildtype (WT) (supplementary table 8). KRAS mutations were independently
confirmed with Sanger sequencing (supplementary figure 9).
LGS-5 PDOs also exhibited different sensitivities to gemcitabine and the MEKinhibitor cobimetinib (figure 4B, 4G). LGS-5.1 and LGS-5.2 were both resistant to
gemcitabine, whereas LGS-5.3 and LGS-5.4 were sensitive. LGS-5.4 was also
sensitive to cobimetinib, while the other LGS-5 PDOs were resistant. All LGS-5 PDOs
were largely genetically identical, and no variants or copy number changes were
identified that explained differential response to these drugs (supplementary table 8,
9).
HGS-13.3 PDOs revealed a >10-fold higher IC50-value compared to HGS-13.4
PDOs for gemcitabine, the combined carboplatin and paclitaxel treatment and afatinib
(figure 4B, 4C, 4F, supplementary table 5). Consistent with previous findings on the
effect of copper-efflux pumps on chemotherapy sensitivity (35–37), copy number
losses of ATP7A and ATP7B were identified in the HGS-13.4 (supplementary table 9).
Additionally, six other genes previously associated with chemotherapy response
(EIF4EBP1, EDNRB, NAT2, TLE3, BRCA2 and NRG1) (38–40), exhibited different
copy-number states between HGS-13.3 and -13.4 which may also have contributed to

the observed differential response to gemcitabine and combined carboplatin and
paclitaxel treatment (supplementary table 9).
END-1 PDOs, both derived from distinct parts of the tumor lesion in the same
ovary, demonstrated differential drug response to gemcitabine, WEE1-inhibitor
adavosertib and AKT-inhibitor MK-2206 (figure 4B, 4D, 4E). We identified genetic
alterations in WWOX, ERBB2 and HRAS that might have contributed to the observed
differential response (supplementary table 8, 9) (41–45). However, even though END1.2 achieved the lowest IC50-values for all three drugs, both END-1.1 and END-1.2
were classified as sensitive to gemcitabine and resistant to MK-2206 and adavosertib
(figure 4B, 4D, 4E).
HGS-3.1 and LGS-3.1 displayed drug responses that were very similar to their
related PDOs (figure 4; supplementary table 5). In these related PDOs, differential
response was only observed for the combined carboplatin and paclitaxel treatment,
while drug responses were similar to carboplatin and paclitaxel mono-treatment. Two
carboplatin-response associated genes (30), CLCN6 and MTHFR, exhibited copy
number loss in the sensitive PDO LGS-3.1 (supplementary table 9). Functional studies
have not focused on CLCN6 and chemotherapy response, but have shown additive
effects of MTHFR-inhibition and chemotherapeutic drugs (46).
Additionally, drug response heterogeneity was examined in a patient from
whom PDOs were obtained at multiple time points. HGS-1 was derived from primary
chemosensitive disease and HGS-1-R2 and HGS-1-R3 were derived from recurrent
chemoresistant disease, and together these PDOs reflected the clinical course of the
patient. HGS-1-R2/R3 were less sensitive to the mono- and combination treatment of
carboplatin and paclitaxel compared to HGS-1 (figure 4A, 4C; supplementary table 5).
Although HGS-1-R2 and HGS-1-R3 were derived from ascites collected within a
timeframe of one month, differential sensitivity was observed to paclitaxel,
gemcitabine and adavosertib (figure 4A, 4B, 4D).
Moreover, we assessed if SVs (including gene fusions) in genes from the
DGIdb resource could be linked to differential drug response. In the related PDOs
derived from the eight patients that exhibited differential drug response, no SVs were
identified that could explain phenotypic heterogeneity. In addition to genetic
heterogeneity in genes reported to influence drug response by the DGIdb, related
PDOs also exhibited varying degrees of genome-wide heterogeneity at both the SNV
and CNA levels (supplementary figure 10). The average number of unique SNVs and
CNAs in all related PDOs were 24% (2 to 70%) and 17% (0 to 100%), respectively.
Considerable genomic heterogeneity at SNV level was observed in LGS-2 and MC-3
(30-70% unique SNVs per PDO), while these PDOs exhibited differential drug
response to only one/two drugs. On the other hand, END-1 and LGS-5 had the lowest
degree of genomic heterogeneity (2-14% unique SNVs per PDO) and exhibited
heterogeneous response to three drugs. In conclusion, we did not observe a direct
correlation between genome-wide heterogeneity and differential drug response.

Discussion
We have performed drug screening on 36 PDOs derived from 23 patients
comprising all major OC histopathological subtypes. OC PDOs resembled the tumors
they were derived from, with an average overlap of 67% of SNVs and similar CNA
profiles. PDOs generated at interval debulking recapitulated clinical response to firstline carboplatin and paclitaxel combination treatment for histopathological (p=5.821e05), biochemical (p=0.0004) and radiological (p=0.0092) outcomes.
Diverse responses to registered drugs for OC were observed among PDOs.
Limited sensitivity to first-line carboplatin (7/31, 23%) and paclitaxel (5/31, 16%)
treatment was observed, compared to sensitivity in the majority of patients to secondline gemcitabine treatment (29/35, 83%). All PDOs exposed to PARP-inhibition were
found to be resistant, in line with HR-proficiency classification based on WGS data.
Response to targeted drugs under clinical investigation could partly be explained by
genetic variation; resistance to afatinib (12/25, 48%), resistance to adavosertib (7/17,
41%), response to flavopiridol (N=4/17, 24%) and sensitivity to vemurafenib (5/7,
71%). Importantly, we identified a sensitive response to at least one tested drug in
nearly all patients (22/25, 88%). Since not all PDOs were exposed to the same number
of drugs (3-13 monotherapies tested per patient), this is likely an underrepresentation.
Finally, intrapatient tumor heterogeneity assessment in seven patients with organoids
derived from multiple tumor locations, revealed differential response to at least one
drug for all patients, indicating the importance to evaluate multiple tumor locations.
In a systematic approach, we showed that PDO drug response correlated with
several clinical response measures. This included histopathological assessment of
tumor regression according to a three-tier method (CRS) (16), which is recommended
for assessment of response to neoadjuvant therapy (47). Histopathological grading of
tumor regression offers the advantage to study each tumor site separately, as opposed
to patient-wide measures of response such as CA-125 and RECIST. While Bohm et
al. (16) previously reported that the prognostic significance of the CRS on omental
tumor lesions was greater than on primary tumor sites, we applied it to all tumor
locations where organoids were derived from. In this study, we present a correlation
between CRS and PDO drug response to carboplatin and paclitaxel combination
treatment.
In order to bring PDO-based drug response assessment to the clinic, PDO
establishment and drug screening needs to be performed within a short timeframe,
preferably limited to the diagnosis-treatment interval. In line with previous studies
(8,48–50), we demonstrated that rapid PDO establishment and drug screening is
feasible. To further validate the predictive value of PDOs, we plan to undertake a
prospective trial in which organoids will be derived from both primary and recurrent
tumors and tested for response to drugs provided in the clinic, while clinical response
is systematically monitored.
Considering intrapatient drug response heterogeneity, derivation of organoids
from multiple tumor locations of individual patients, may further improve treatment
allocation (51). Although sequencing studies have shown that OCs display extensive

inter- and intratumor heterogeneity on a genetic level (13,14), we could only partially
link inter- and intratumor heterogeneous drug responses to genetic heterogeneity.
Additionally, some of the CNAs that we identified in genes reported to be related to
drug response by the DGIdb might be non-contributive passenger events, given the
high frequency of CNAs in high-grade serous OC. Therefore, follow-up studies with
increased sample sizes and deeper sequencing are required to decipher drug
response associations with the candidate genes identified here, and to discover novel
resistance mechanisms. Importantly however, the lack of complete correlation
between genetic and functional testing at this point, stresses the need for functional
testing in addition to genetic testing to improve clinical decision making.
The establishment of a larger collection of OC PDOs will provide the opportunity
to determine comprehensive, clinically useful genotype-phenotype correlations. When
a large collection including drug response data is available, treatment stratification can
potentially be performed based on genomic or transcriptomic characteristics of specific
PDO subtypes, which could make organoid derivation dispensable in the future (51).
This transition requires an accurate classification of drug-sensitive and -resistant
PDOs. Similar to previous studies (28,29), OC PDOs were considered sensitive if the
drug concentration that reduced viability of >50% of cells was lower than the
concentration achievable in patient plasma (Css/Cmax). However, the Css/Cmax will
vary between patients and is not necessarily the concentration that is achieved in the
tumor (52,53). In addition, sometimes patients require dose adjustments due to
adverse events which also affect the drug concentration achievable in both plasma
and tumor. Therefore, it should be taken into account that tumors predicted to be
sensitive based on the PDO drug response may clinically not respond. Prospective
clinical trials comparing clinical to PDO drug response, should be complemented with
plasma drug level measurements to further elucidate the relation between in vitro and
clinical sensitivity.
To conclude, OC PDOs provide a valuable preclinical model system to guide
treatment choice in the clinic as it satisfies the following criteria; 1) PDOs genetically
resemble the original tumor from which they are derived, 2) PDO drug response
reflects patients’ clinical response, and 3) PDO establishment and drug screening can
be performed within a short timeframe. Generating and testing PDOs of multiple tumor
locations will offer insights in differential drug response as a result of tumor
heterogeneity. This information could improve treatment stratification and reduce the
development of drug resistance. Complementary PDO drug screening and genomic
analysis allows the linkage of genotypes with drug sensitivity patterns to identify
candidate biomarkers for drug response.

tumor lesion (SNVs). Stacked bar chart showing the number of shared (red) and
unique (tumor-green, PDO-blue) SNVs between tumor and PDO pairs.
Supplementary figure 3. OC PDOs retained genomic features of the original
tumor lesion (CNAs). A) Comparison of genome-wide CNAs in tumor and PDO pairs.
B) Genome-wide CNAs in PDO-only samples. Copy-number losses are depicted in
blue and gains in red.
Supplementary figure 4. Correlation of OC PDO drug response with specific
measures of clinical response. (A-E) Drug dose-response curves of OC PDOs for
carboplatin and paclitaxel combination treatment dichotomized into clinical response
groups. Upper x-axis: carboplatin drug concentrations, lower x-axis: paclitaxel drug
concentrations. Dose response curves normalized to positive (navitoclax, ABT-263)
and negative controls (DMSO). Non-linear regression analysis: log(inhibitor) vs.
normalized response -- Variable slope fit. Red=clinically resistant, blue=clinically
sensitive, A) Histopathological tumor response: CRS1=no or minimal response vs
CRS2=appreciable response. B) Biochemical response: no normalization (<35 kU/L)
of serum CA-125 during primary treatment vs normalization. C) Radiological response:
stable disease vs partial response according to RECIST criteria. D) Progression-free
survival: <6 months vs >=6 months. E) Overall survival: <17 months vs >=17 months.
