Abstract
Bordetella pertussis causes whooping cough in humans. Despite high routine vaccination coverage,
pertussis has become the most prevalent vaccine-preventable disease in many industrialized countries,
since the 1990s. While a plethora of candidate explanations for the resurgence remain hotly debated, two
prevailing ideas focus on vaccine driven pathogen adaptation and on the switch to the latest generation
vaccines. We use a suite of genomic and epidemiological approaches to characterize pertussis transmission
in the Netherlands, between 1949 and 2017, investigate drivers of B. pertussis population diversity, and
the role of allele shifts in the resurgence. Reconciling the epidemiological data with sequence data has
allowed us to characterize a resurgence that is not accompanied with increased transmission but has
unique functional genomic signatures of decreased diversity. Here we show a positive association between
genetic diversity and incidence which validates the hypothesis that the resurgence is associated with the
expansion of more pathogenic strains. We see a direct effect of vaccination on the replicative fitness of
pathogens. Our models suggest, large outbreaks are unlikely to be due to immune evasion and the vaccine
switch cannot be contributing to increased pertussis incidence. Therefore, efforts aimed at mitigating the
resurgence in the population at large, and particularly in vulnerable infants, are more likely to succeed
by maintaining routine vaccine coverage high.

Main
Pertussis is a highly contagious disease, primarily caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis (1–5). It
was historically considered a childhood disease, with a mean age of infection in the pre-vaccine era between
4-6 years (1, 7). Research on vaccine development started more than a century ago (1), due in part to
high child mortality and morbidity burden (3). In the pre-vaccine era, there were 115,000 to 270,000 cases
of pertussis and 5,000 to 10,000 deaths due to the disease each year, in the US alone (3). The roll-out of
routine infant vaccination programs starting in many countries during the 1940s and 1950s was associated
with notable declines in pertussis disease burden. Indeed, these success of early vaccination efforts (using the
whole cell vaccine, DTwP) in reducing incidence led some to consider pertussis as a potential candidate for
eradication (1–3, 6). However, over the past two decades, high-profile outbreaks in populations with longstanding immunization and high coverage, pertussis is once again a major public health challenge (1, 2, 9, 11–
13). In 2013, the Global Burden of Disease Study estimated pertussis related mortality in the first year of life
to be approximately 56 000 deaths (14). A definitive explanation for the re-emergence of pertussis remains
elusive (2, 8–10, 15–17), however, there is a great deal of attention paid to the potential role of vaccines on

(i) pathogen evolution (15, 19), (ii) disease severity and asymptomatic carriage (17, 20), and (iii) waning of
protective immunity and vaccine failure (16, 21, 22).
The resurgence of pertussis in the Netherlands is a very interesting case study. It has been suggested
that B. pertussis in the Netherlands shows vaccine-driven evolution (15, 19, 25, 26). In the Netherlands, the
surveillance of pertussis is based mainly on notifications which were made compulsory in 1976. Routine vaccination was introduced in 1953 with a whole cell vaccine (DTwP) (27, Fig. 1). Many changes in vaccination
schedule and formulation occurred between 1953 and 2004 (15, Fig. S1): (i) between 1975 and 1984, there
was a temporary reduction of DTwP dosage; (ii) in 1999 an acceleration of the first 3 doses to a 2, 3 and
4 month schedule; (iii) in 2001 the introduction of an acellular vaccine (Tdap) booster for 4 year-olds and,
finally; (iv) in 2005 the replacement of the DTwP by an acellular vaccine (DTaP) (Fig. 1). Almost a decade
prior to the switch to DTaP, pertussis incidence increased suddenly in 1996, and since then, has exhibited
regular epidemic cycles (27, Fig. 1).

Figure 1: Pertussis in the Netherlands. Temporal trends in allele frequencies of virulence associated B. pertussis genes
and annual pertussis notifications and vaccine coverage in The Netherlands in the period 1949â2017. Top half of the plot shows
B. pertussis allelotype frequencies (1949-2017). Allelotypes 1-6 are defined by specific combinations of different alleles of genes
related to virulence (Allelotype data obtained from van Gent et al. (25)). Bottom half shows the total number of annual cases
in the Netherlands 1976-2017 (red) green line shows vaccine coverage and vertical dotted lines illustrate the introduction of the
whole cell vaccine (light green, 1953-2004) and the introduction of the acellular vaccine (2005-Present). NEED TO UPDATE
THE TOP PART

Coincident with the resurgence were shifts in B. pertussis allelotype frequencies associated with virulence (15, 19, 25, 26, Fig.1). The B. pertussis strains circulating during epidemics exhibit diversity visible
on a genome structural level that is reflected in allelotype (combinations of difference allelles) frequencies
(Fig. 1, top panel). Through time, we observe waves of allelotypes becoming more prevalent and, eventually, going extinct, giving way to new variants (Fig. 1). These allele changes are associated with small
mutations, mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in virulence associated genes - ptxA, ptxP
(pertussis toxin), prn (pertactin) and fim3 (fimbriae) (15, 19, 25, 26) (Fig. 2A). Shifts in alleles frequencies, some of which associated with a selective sweeps, provide the most compelling evidence that selective
forces are at play (15, 19, 25, 26). Several recent studies have investigated the relationship between the
effective population size of viral pathogens and the number of infected hosts (29–31). By harnessing information present in epidemiological time series, genomic (whole genome sequences) and demographic data,
we sought to elucidate the relationship between bacterial population diversity and covariates to gain insight
into contemporary pertussis epidemiology and evolution. Specifically, we formulated evolutionary models, in
an attempt to reconstruct the B. pertussis history and transmission dynamics, by integrating parallel data
streams of incidence reports (whole population and age-stratified incidence data - Figs. 1 & 5 bottom), whole
genome isolate sequences, demographic characteristics, vaccine coverage and features, within a coalescentbased framework, that incorporates generalized linear models, for statistical inference. We thus set out to
test a set of covariates of evolution and investigate potential drivers of allele shifts and genetic diversity in B.
pertussis populations, in the Netherlands, and how these shifts might relate to the resurgence of pertussis.
Such retrospective knowledge can clarify the past, potentially being of value for rational vaccine design that
takes into account the genetic diversity of the bacterium and for predicting the future complexity of regional

We used the concatenated SNPs (Tohama I reference, Figs. S2 and S3) to reconstruct the phylogeny. The
resulting maximum clade credibility (MCC) time-stamped tree had an estimated root height with a mean of
267.3 years with a 95% HPD (Highest Posterior Density) interval of [223.5, 317.7] (Figs. S4-S6 - Maximum

In addition, both MCC (Maximum clade credibility) and maximum likelihood phylogenies estimate root
height is estimated between the years 1700 and 1800 (Figs. S4-S6). Further, the reconstructed phylogeny
(Fig. 2B) shows a notable change in the population structure of B. pertussis after the introduction of
vaccination in the 1950s, exhibiting a ladder-like structure with a long trunk and short side branches. The
evolutionary rate of the Dutch population (2.96 10-4 SNPs/bp subs/site/year) appears to fall within the
expected range for B. pertussis previously reported in (24). We find that observed phylogenetic patterns
of sequence clustering strongly congruent with vaccine eras. This phylogeny, while representing the whole
genome sequence (WGS) of B. pertussis, was modelled with the whole genome partitioned into 11 functions.
The 24 functional categories defined in Bart et al (24) were further grouped together into 11 broader categories
that were used to define the functional categories of the SNPs. These functions depict (i) biosynthesis; (ii) cell
process RNA; (iii) cell surface; (iv) conserved regions; (v) metabolism; (vi) miscellaneous; (vii) pseudogenes;

(viii) regulation; (ix) transport binding; (x) unknown and (xi) virulence (Fig. 3). Partitioning revealed
different rates of coalescence, with biosynthesis, virulence, regulation and cell surface functional partitions
with the highest rates (respectively 0.679,0.635, 0.624, 0.615) and the remaining functions with slower rates
(the highest being metabolism with 0.56 and the slowest call process RNA functions with 0.467). Similar
results are observed when performing this analysis on the SNPs extracted using B1917 (Dutch isolate sequence
from 2000).
B. pertussis has been considered a monomorphic pathogen (2, 15). Nevertheless, the changes in structure
of the population are reflected in the expression diversity and shifts in virulence factors (the set of genes
expressed by B. pertussis which allow it to invade and persist inside the host (2)). These proteins expressed
by the virulence associated genes are polymorphic (24, 26, 32). Through time, we observe, in the Netherlands,
B. pertussis bacteria circulating during epidemics exhibit diversity visible on a genome structural level that
is reflected in changes in allele composition (Fig. 2A) in the pathogen population, with particular alleles
becoming dominant and other decreasing in prevalence. As in the phylogenetic reconstruction, we see a
decrease in diversity (Figs 2B), also reflected in the entropy of all functions (Figs. S7-S10). PtxA1 allele is
detected in the population in the 1980s, quickly going into fixation (Fig. 2A). A similar pattern is observed
with ptxP3 which becomes prevalent in the mid 1990s (Fig. 2A), contemporary of the resurgence in 1996
(Fig. 1).

Integrating pertussis epidemiology and molecular evolution
Different functions show varying coalescent rates thus we expected inferred the demographic history of B.
pertussis for each of the 11 functions (Fig. 3B) to reflect that. We performed tree topology analysis in which
we checked for landscape similarities (33) between trees of the 11 functions of the B. pertussis genome. Kmeans revealed 3 clusters (Fig. 3A): (1) Biosynthesis, Virulence and Regulation SNPs; (2) Metabolism and
Cell surface SNPs; (3) all other functions. Number of SNPs differs between functions (Fig. 3B), accounting
for selection pressure on each of these functional sub-populations. With varying proportions between 15.6%
(Cell surface SNPs) to 3.5% (Cell RNA). Similar patterns were observed when using B1917 for SNP extraction
(Fig. S5).
We started by estimating B. pertussis demography - through effective population size, Ne (39, 43, 47),
that characterizes genetic variability - using a Bayesian coalescent non-parametric model with a skygrid prior
without testing possible associations of biological significance (39). Reconstructing trends of epidemic growth
and decline from pathogen genealogies, allows us to relate pathogen effective population size and time-varying
variables that may impact the replicative fitness of a pathogen. We estimated Ne using skygrid priors in
the model with no covariates (39). Thus, for each of the functions, we estimated demography, treating them
as independent sub-populations, as well as for the WGS with 11 partitions (for validation Fig. S6). We
observed a similar general trend for all 11 functions (Fig. 3B). Following the introduction of vaccination,
in 1953, we observed a slight increase in gene diversity, punctuated by episodes of clonal expansion and
retraction (Fig. 3B). In the mid-1990s, there appears to be a marked drop in diversity in most functions
apart from the conserved and Cell RNA regions (Fig. 3B). Around 2004, prior to the introduction of routine
acellular vaccine, we observed a surge in diversity in virulence and biosynthesis only. Diversity continued
to decrease until 2012. In all functions, apart from metabolism, we observed marked diversification in 2012,
the year with the highest number of reported cases. After 2012 diversity rapidly dropped until 2017 in
most functions. Shannon entropy (Figs. S7-S9) particularly, when following the changes in the ten SNPs
with highest entropy through the period 1949-2017) show a similar pattern to our Ne estimates. In that
we see a reduction in diversity overtime, with some of the functions showing higher standing diversity (i.e.
pseudogenes and unknown functional SNPs).
To examine whether we could see a signal of selection, we looked at changes in entropy (Figs. S S7-10)
and Tajima’s D (49), a statistic used to test the null hypothesis of mutation-drift equilibrium and constant
population size, was calculated for all functions separately. A randomly evolving DNA sequence contains
mutations with no effect on the fitness and survival of an organism. The randomly evolving mutations are
called "neutral", while mutations under selection are "non-neutral". All functions show a negative Tajima’s
D value lower than -2 (with a p value <0.05), depicting positive populations selection.

Due to the impact that transmission dynamics and selection can have on pathogen genetic variation (34–
36), we explore associations with potential covariates (annual cases, unvaccinated births and vaccine composition changes) with fluctuations in the effective population size of each of the 11 functions. Thus, we test
biological covariates of potential significance alongside estimation of kinetics of gene diversity Ne trajectory
in time within a generalized linear model (GLM) framework (40). This enables the estimation of the fitness
effect of external covariates as well as the prediction of future epidemic dynamics should conditions change
(Fig. 4).
The first model explored annual pertussis reported cases as a covariate of (Ne ) of each of the 11 functions,
to investigate the association of changes in genetic diversity and allele shifts with the resurgence of pertussis
(Fig. 4A & B and Fig. 3). The clusters estimated the 2D multidimensional scaling (MDS) were indicative of
the associations observed in the GLMs. Functions in cluster 1 (biosynthesis, virulence and regulation) showed
a positive association with reported cases. The coefficients quantifying the effect sizes for the incidence
covariate have a posterior mean βbiosynthesis of 0.095 (0.008, 0.35); a posterior mean βregulation of 0.019
(0.009, 0.026); a posterior mean βvirulence of 0.217 (0.003, 0.52). There is a negative association with the
cell surface SNPs and annual reported cases with coefficients quantifying the effect size for the incidence
covariate have a posterior mean βcell surface of -0.06 (-0.14, -0.01). There was no association between annual
reported cases and the remaining 7 functions.

(Ne ) of B. pertussis in the Netherlands for the period 1949 till 2017, as inferred via a skygrid coalescent tree prior (Gill et
al. 2016). Stationary distributions reached by MCMC with the whole genome (partitioned SNPs into 11 putative functions).
(A) Annual reported cases 1976-2017. (B) Coefficient outputs of the GLM testing the association of case reports and genetic
diversity. Background dashed lines reflect vaccine epoch: No vaccine, DTwP, DTaP. The vertical dashed line shows 0. The dots
are the coefficients quantifying the effect sizes and the horizontal lines are the 95% BCI. If BCI includes zero the association
is not significant. (C) Annual unvaccinated births 1949-2017. (D) Coefficient outputs of the GLM testing the association of
unvaccinated births and genetic diversity. (E) Vaccine changes. No vaccine 1949-1952; DTwP 1953-2004; DTaP 2005-Present.
(F) Coefficient outputs of the GLM testing the association of vaccine composition changes and genetic diversity. Solid lines refer
to β estimates for DTwP and dashed lines refer to β estimates for DTaP. The background grey bands highlight the significant
associations.

The second model explored annual unvaccinated births as a covariate of (Ne ) of each of the 11 functions.
We wouldn’t expect vaccine coverage to have a significant effect on gene diversity through time, as vaccine
coverage quickly rose and remained fairly high. Thus, unvaccinated birth rates, as a proxy for the influx
of susceptibles in the population was a more appropriate covariate (Fig. 4C). The only function associated
with unvaccinated births is cell surface. The model with (log) unvaccinated births resulted in a similar
trajectory of loss of genetic diversity (Ne ) after the introduction of whole cell vaccination with the trajectory
punctuated by episodes of clonal expansion, selection and diversification, that track the covariate trajectory
(Fig. 4C & D and Fig 3). The coefficient quantifying the effect size for the unvaccinated births covariate
has a posterior mean of 1.4 (0.08, 3.12), indicating a positive significant association.
The final model explored effects of changes in vaccine type as a covariate of (Ne ) of each of the 11
functions. This model did not yield associations Ne of any of the functions.
From the Shannon entropy analysis, when we investigated in SNPs diversity over the 1949-2017 we see
similar trends and patterns of association with annual notifications and susceptible pool (Figs. S7-S10).
Analysis was repeated with B1917 (Figs S12-S17). All associations present with SNPs extracted with
Tohama I were validated when using B1917 albeit with slightly different coefficient and 95% BCI estimates
(Fig. S17).
The results of the GLM illustrate several possible dynamics:(i) Increase virulence and increased transmission; (ii) increase virulence decreased transmission; (iii) clonal expansion.

Resolving with pertussis transmission
To explore these possibilities, looked at epidemiological data. Since the resurgence in 1996 (Fig. 1) prior
to the switch from DTwP to DTaP in 2005, incidence steadily increased, culminating in 2012 with close to
14000 confirmed cases. We picked a Morlet wavelet to deconstruct the annual reported cases time series.
The wavelet transform decomposes a signal using functions (wavelets). We recovered dominant periodic
components. Incidence remained at a higher level peaking every 3-4 years (Figs. 1 & 5 top). We obtained
age-structured pertussis annual case reports for the period 1997-2016 (Fig. 5, bottom). During this period
we observed an increasing contribution of the older age groups to the disease burden, particularly individuals
in the 10-49 years age groups. This is reflected by the increase in mean age of first infection calculation
(pink line, Fig.5 bottom). Mean age of infection continues to increase, specifically after the introduction of
the DTaP in 2005, vaccine mean age of infection oscillates between 20 and 30 years of age.

Discussion
At first glance, the resurgence and persistence of pertussis despite intense vaccination efforts is unexpected
because B. pertussis is highly clonal and lacks the genetic diversity of many other pathogens(2, 15, 19, 37).
Two potential explanations for the resurgence in the Netherlands are centered on whether recent epidemics
are a consequence of waning of vaccine-derived immunity or emergence of novel variants able to escape
vaccine protection(2, 8, 8, 10, 10, 15, 19). It is important to distinguish between these explanations, as they
warrant distinct public health responses: altering the vaccine schedule versus developing a new vaccine.
Pathogen genomes are a valuable source of information about transmission dynamics (48). Notwithstanding sequences have not been used in conjunction with long-term pertussis epidemiological and demographic
data to understand disease dynamics and resurging events. We sought to incorporate these parallel data
streams for pertussis in the Netherlands between 1949-2017, by combining the analysis of both epidemiological and phylogeny data with the aim to provide insight on interactions between epidemiological and
pathogen evolutionary processes to characterize transmission dynamics to ultimately optimize population
specific control strategies.
Many time varying covariates, particularly those with a mechanistic influence on replicative fitness of
pathogens, are closely related to the growth rate of epidemic size (48). It is important to assess the re-

lationship between effective population size and epidemiological dynamics characterizing the number of
infections and disease transmission. In this study, we aimed to understand drivers of pertussis transmission in the Netherlands in a period spanning pre vaccination and two different vaccines (15, 19, 25). Using
novel Bayesian coalescent methods that incorporate external potential drivers (39, 40), we formally tested
hypothesis of vaccine-driven pathogen evolution and resurgence mechanisms. We aimed to examine epidemiologically relevant covariates of genetic diversity, looking for potential genomic signatures (effective
population size trends) that may be related with transmission dynamics and that could potentially allow us
to elucidate underlying processes driving disease (29, 31, 48).
The phylogenetic reconstruction revealed a change in structure in the phylogeny (Fig. 2A) which supports
previous studies describing strong selection during the vaccine period, suggesting vaccination could act as a
major force driving changes in B. pertussis populations (15, 19, 24–26). Polymorphisms in B. pertussis surface
proteins have been detected in several countries (15, 19, 24–26) and variations in pertussis toxin (Ptx) and
pertactin (Prn) have been shown to affect vaccine efficacy in a mouse model (15, 19). Diversification of gene
expression profiles may also influence pathogenicity, which has been suggested in previous studies (15, 19, 24–
26). Thus understanding selection patterns, could lead to better insight into the mechanisms of pathogen
adaptation. While we can harness information from the WGS, trying to infer associations with vaccine
and demographic covariates was be more fitting by looking at separate regions of the genome that might
be under differential selection pressures. For all putative 11 functions we observed an overall decrease in
genetic diversity through time. Decrease in genetic diversity through time can potentially be a snapshot of
clonal expansion of those new alleles that appear to have high fitness (15, 19, 24–26) within the population,
reduction in transmission (48) as well as sample bias (47). Futher the significant negative Tajima’s D (Fig.
3B) potentially depicts selective sweeps (or linkage to a swept gene), and the observed population expansions
after a bottleneck (15, 19, 24–26).
Virulence is the product of complex interactions among evolutionary, ecological and epidemiological
processes (53). Thus, it is important to evaluate our results holistically. If taken separately, the phylodynamic
GLM analysis on the association between annual reported cases and the putative SNPs for cluster of virulence
regulation biosynthesis functions could paint a picture of long-term selection for increase virulence and
pathogenicity (Figs 4 A-D). Biosynthesis, cell surface, regulation, metabolic and virulence alleles are regulated
similarly in the bvg locus (51). Biosynthesis related genes such as Bordetella liposacharides (LPS) are strongly
related with pathogenicity. Virulence genes’ products are thought to play a role later in pathogenesis â such as
toxins and their secretion systems (52). Mooi and colleagues have also argued that the increased prevalence
of ptxP3 in the Netherlands (Fig 2C) is associated with increased virulence through production of a more
toxic toxin (15, 19, 25). While the expansion of ptxP3 strains suggests that these strains carry mutations
that have increased their fitness (25, 26), the assertion that ptxP3 strains produce more pertussis toxin,
which results in increased virulence and immune suppression (25, 26), is at odds with the epidemiological
patterns observed (Figs. 4 & 5). Further, epidemiological theory (56) illustrates that if transmission was
increasing we would see a decrease in age of infection and shorter inter epidemic periods. Annual case reports
show a pattern of decreased transmission in the Netherlands (Fig 5). Even though pertussis has resurged
in 1996 and incidence remains high, inter-epidemic period and mean age of infection reveal of decrease in
transmission (Fig. 5). This pattern, in conjunction with the genomic diversity signatures, highlights the
increase in pathogenicity seems to translate in more visible symptoms, rather than infectiousness. This
is nonetheless concerning. Thus the much proposed increased virulence or pathogenicity is a product of
increased symptomatic cases, offset by increased surveillance. In fact, as transmissability declines we should
expect a selection for lower virulence (53).
The positive association between cell surface diversity and unvaccinated births clearly shows the direct
effect of vaccine selection pressure on the cell surface alleles.high levels vaccination are expected to lead to a
decrease in population diversity, acting as selective pressure whereby only those lineages escaping the vaccine
may survive. Indeed, some previous studies have observed such a decrease in population diversity following
the introduction of vaccination (24, 54, 55). The positive association, shows a vaccination effective in
maintaining herd immunity through decreasing diversity and reducing prevalence of older lineages. However
especially during the DTwP era it seems to fail to completely eradicate older strains, maintaining diversity.
As the vaccine coverage decreases observe a rapid increase in diversity. One explanation might be effects
on replication cycle which relates with transmission efficiency. Examining the age of patients from which
sequences were isolated between 2011 and 2017 (Fig. 6), further validated the hypothesis that rather than

patterns of immune evasion as previously proposed in the acellular era (post 2005) (15, 19, 25) what we
observe is higher probabilities of cases coming from unvaccinated or individuals who had the DTwP vaccine,
perhaps alluding to vaccine failure.
Of the 7 functions not showing direct clear association with epidemiological covariates, it was not surprising that there was no association with metabolic SNPs (Figure 5). The metabolite rich intracellular
environment relaxes selective constraints on metabolic genes, which leads to accumulation of mutations, loss
of function and gene loss to maximize fitness (53).
Our analysis provided insight into fundamental problems in evolutionary ecology, whilst integrating
disparate data streams enhanced our understanding of epidemiological public health issues. Epidemiological
and genomic surveillance of populations is crucial understating patterns of pertussis resurgence. The results
showed that genomic surveillance, when integrated with epidemiological and demographic data, illustrated
a resurgence not driven by immune evasion or enhanced transmission capabilities but resulting in increased
pathogenecity whereby there is selection for alleles that appear to be more detectable. A continued integrative
approach could prove useful in guiding pertussis control in a resource-efficient manner.

Methods
Whole genome sequences
We obtained a total of 193 Whole genome sequences (WGS): downloaded 72 B. pertussis WGS (clinical isolates) with known sampling dates 1949 - 2012 for the Netherlands from publicly available data
EMBL/GenBank. 121 whole genome sequences were directly obtained from the Bordetella Unit from the
National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM).

Allelotype and Virulence factors temporal frequencies
Allelic variation has been found in virulence-associated genes coding for the pertussis toxin A subunit (ptxA),
pertactin (prn), serotype 2 fimbriae (fim2), serotype 3 fimbriae (fim3) and the promoter for pertussis toxin
(ptxP). Allelotypes are defined by different combinations of alleles for these genes. Data obtained from van
Gent et al. (25) (Fig.1). Virulence factor data (Fig. 2b directly obtained from Bordetella Unit from the
National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM).

Effective diversity H 0
Measures of how many different types of isolates are present in this population (41). It takes into account
both isolate richness as well as the dominance/evenness. If we have two years with equal richness, yet one
site is dominated by a single species whereas a second site has a more even abundance of the isolates, then
clearly we would consider the second as more diverse. And so the concept of diversity resilience and function.

Pertussis vaccination data
Vaccine coverage and type data obtained from the National immunization program from the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM).

Unvaccinated birth rate
Unvaccinated birth rate was calculated using annual estimates for population size, birth rate and vaccine
coverage.

Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) extraction
To extract single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from whole genome sequences, we used Tohama I (accession number BX470248) as the reference for alignment (24, 37). We used SAMtools (http://samtools.sourceforge.net),
in combination with Wgsim to simulate Illumina sequencing for each of the sequences (https://github.com/lh3/wgsim).
These reads were then mapped to the reference genome, using BWA-MEM (https://github.com/lh3/bwa),
to extract the SNP positions (Fig. S2). SNP positions were controlled for alternate base calls, map, strand
and base bias. We validated this procedure using the SNP data available in Bart et al. (24). Additionally,
this entire pipeline from the alignment of the reads to the functional annotation of the SNPs was re-run
using the B1917 complete genome as the reference (accession number CP009751.1 and assembly version
GCA000193595.3) as an alternative measure to cross validate our observations and results (Fig. S13). Detailed methods and commands used in this pipeline are provided in the supplementary materials (Appendix
SI) to ensure reproducibility.

Functional Mapping
Each SNP was mapped by additional filtering of SNPs based on functional annotations using Tohama I as
reference (24, 37). Functional annotations of the identified SNPs were then performed using snpEff v4.3t
using these reference genome annotations. The 24 functional categories defined in Bart 2014 were further
grouped together into 11 broader categories that were used to define the functional categories of the SNPs.
We subsequently used B1917 (2000 isolate) as a reference as validation.

Shannon Entropy
The shifts in Shannon entropy (42) presented in figure 3 were obtained by first splitting the sequences into
pre- and post-2005. Then, for each data set, we calculated the entropy per SNP position:
X
H(X) = −
p(x) log2 p(x),
x∈X

where p(x) is the frequency of each SNP variation in our sample. We then calculated the relative change in
entropy across SNPs for each gene function:

∆H =

X Hpost − Hpre

.

Phylogenetic inference
Time structured phylogenies were inferred using BEAST 1.8.4 (43). Phylogeny was rooted using Tohama
I (37). Molecular evolution was modeled according to a general time reversible (GTR)+Γ4 substitution
model (46) independently across four partitions (codon positions 1, 2, 3 and non-coding intergenic regions).
A relaxed molecular clock with branch rates drawn from a lognormal distribution (44) that draws branchspecific rates was used to infer the evolutionary rate from date calibrated tips. All other priors used to infer
the phylogenetic tree were left at their default values. All analyses were run for 200 million steps across ten

independent Markov chains (MCMC runs) and states were sampled every 10 000 steps. Complete details
are provided in the SI Appendix S5 also on the alternative Phylogenetic inference was repeated using SNPs
extracted using B1917 as the genome of reference for validation.

Tajima’s D
Tajima’s D (49) is statistic used to test the null hypothesis of mutation-drift equilibrium and constant
population size. Tajima’s D is computed as the difference between two measures of genetic diversity: the
mean number of pairwise differences and the number of segregating sites, each scaled so that they are
expected to be the same in a neutrally evolving population of constant size. Tajima’s statistic computes a
standardized measure of the total number of segregating sites (these are DNA sites that are polymorphic)
in the sampled DNA and the average number of mutations between pairs in the sample. The two quantities
whose values are compared, are both method of moments estimates of the population genetic parameter θ,
and so are expected to equal the same value. If these two numbers only differ by as much as one could
reasonably expect by chance, then the null hypothesis of neutrality cannot be rejected. Otherwise, the null
hypothesis of neutrality is rejected. This analysis was performed using the R package pegas v0.11.

Phylogenetic trees landscape topology
Using all 11 functional group trees, we explore landscapes of phylogenetic trees computed as distance matrices
between each tree topology. 2D multidimensional scaling (MDS) visualization were generated, as described
in Kendall & Colijn (33). K-means clustering is applied to the distances to choose the number of clusters so
as to optimize the Bayesian information Criterion (BIC). ADD MORE DETAILS HERE

Demographic inference
A flexible non-parametric skygrid tree prior (39) was used to infer B. pertussis Netherlands demography, from
molecular data by recovering estimates of effective population size (Ne )—a measure of genetic diversity—
at 68 evenly spaced grid points across 69 years, ending at the most recent tip in the tree (2017) in BEAST
v1.8.4 (43), under a relaxed molecular clock with rates drawn from a lognormal distribution (44) and codon
position partitioned (positions 1 + 2 and 3) HKY+Γ4 (43, 45, 46) nucleotide substitution models. In addition,
a GMRF (Gaussian mean random field) prior is used to smooth the Ne trajectories. The overall evolutionary
rate was given an uninformative continuous time Markov chain (CTMC). MCMC chains were set up, each
running for 200 million states, sampling every 10 000 states.

Testing factors associated with B. pertussis diversity through time
The reconstructed phylogeny formed the basis for testing covariates using a generalized linear model (GLM)
framework (39, 40) that estimates a coefficient of effect size β that infers degree of correlation and its
significance of each candidate covariate for genetic diversity trajectory through time as the response variable
(effective population size - Ne ) (39, 40). To determine if a particular covariate can be incorporated in
the model, we employed stochastic search variable selection by computing Bayes factors (BFs) for each
covariate (45).This approach uses the data to select the explanatory variables and their effect sizes We set
the prior for inclusion probabilities (δ) such that there was a 50% probability of each covariate being included.
For this, δ is a binary indicator (0, 1) variable that allows for calculation of Bayes Factors and thus model
selection (45). So at a given interval, log(Ne (t)) = βδ log(cov)t + wt . The candidate covariates considered
were (i) pertussis annual incidence; (ii) unvaccinated births- a proxy measure of both vaccine coverage and
demographic changes- and (iii) changes in pertussis routine vaccination namely, vaccine type (whole cell
composition changes and its replacement with the acellular vaccine) and in schedule (SI Appendix, Table
S4). This methodology is explained in detail here (39, 40). Details regarding why most covariates should
be log transformed is in SI Appendix, section S6.1. Details regarding using covariates with missing data are
in SI Appendix, section S6.2. Details regarding using covariates as factor levels are in SI Appendix, section
S6.3. Details of Bayes factors calculations are in SI Appendix, section S6.4.

Wavelet analysis
In order to investigate the periodicity of pertussis epidemics over this period, we used wavelet analysis (50) to
decompose time series, to detect the dominant frequencies and dominant period through time. Wavelets are
especially powerful when time series data are inherently non-stationary (50). For this analysis, we used the
Morlet wavelet of log-transformed total annual cases. This decomposition yields a good localization in both
time and frequency, which is well suited for investigating the temporal evolution of aperiodic and transient
signals.

Mean Age of Infection
In the presence of vaccination interventions, mean age of infection (A) is dependent on the effective reproductive number (Rp ) (56). We expect mean age of infection to decrease as Rp increases. we calculate mean
age of infection as:
1 X
Ci ∆ai
A=
N i
where, Ci is the number of reported cases in each age class, N is the total number of individuals in the
population and ∆ai is the time spent in each age class.
