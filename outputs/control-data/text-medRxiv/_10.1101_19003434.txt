Abstract
The Katanga region in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been struck
by repeated epidemics of measles. In many of the affected health zones, reactive
mass vaccination campaigns were conducted in response to the outbreaks. Here, we
attempted to determine how effective campaigns were in curtailing a large outbreak
in 2015. Using a model of measles transmission we compared observed case numbers
to a counterfactual of no campaigns, by first fitting a model to the data including the
campaigns and then re-running this without vaccination. Focusing on eight of the
68 health zones in the Katanga region, we estimated the reactive campaigns to have
reduced the size of the outbreaks by approximately 21,000 (IQR: 16,000–27,000;
95% CI: 8300–38,000), or 21% (IQR: 17%–25%, 95% CI: 9.3%–34%) of possible
measles cases. There was considerable heterogeneity in the impact of campaigns,

with campaigns startgin earlier after the start of an outbreak being more impactful.
We further sought to establish whether the spatial pattern of the outbreak could
have been determined in advance to help prioritise areas for vaccination campaigns
and speed up the response. The best predictors of outbreak size among all the
health zones were vaccination coverage derived from cluster surveys and outbreak
size in 2010-13. This, combined with the fact that the vast majority of reported
cases were in under-5 year olds, would suggest that there are systematic issues of
undervaccination. If this was to continue, outbreaks would be expected to continue
to occur in the affected health zones at regular intervals, mostly concentrated in
under-5 year olds. Taken together, our findings suggest that while a strong routine
vaccination regime remains the most effective means of measles control, it might be
possible to improve the effectiveness of reactive campaigns by considering predictive
factors to trigger a more targeted vaccination response.

Introduction

2

There have been repeated outbreaks of measles in the Democratic Republic of

3

Congo (DRC). The Katanga region (formerly known as Katanga province) is in the

4

southeast of the country bordering Zambia and comprises the provinces of Haut-

5

Katanga, Haut-Lomami, Lualaba and Tanganyika. It has experienced large periodic

6

measles outbreaks, such as in 2006–07, 2010–13 [1, 2]. In response to these, reactive

7

mass vaccination campaigns have been conducted to protect those assumed to be at

8

risk both within the outbreak area and beyond.

9

Standard measles epidemic responses include reinforcing measles surveillance in

10

affected areas, providing free care to reduce measles mortality, and reactive vacci-

11

nation campaigns in order to control measles transmission. In collaboration with

12

the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Oﬀice for Africa (AFRO) and the

13

United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) sup-

14

ported the Ministry of Health to respond to various measles outbreaks including

15

two major measles outbreaks in the Katanga region. Firstly, in 2010–13, a measles

16

epidemic was reported with over 96,000 suspected cases reported, 77% of which oc-

17

curred in children under 5 years of age, and more than 1400 deaths [2]. In 2011, in

18

response to the ongoing epidemic, MSF vaccinated more than 1.8 million children 26

19

of the 68 health zones in the Katanga region [1]. Secondly, in February 2015, a new

20

measles epidemic started in Katanga, DRC, lasting the whole year and resulting in

21

over 40,000 cases and more than 400 deaths in 2015 [3]. MSF responded with the

22

standard epidemic responses including a reactive vaccination campaign in order to

23

stop measles transmission during epidemics, targeting more than 25 health zones.

24

The time interval between the outbreak starting in different parts of Katanga

25

and the vaccination response implemented varied. Previously, modelling studies in

26

Niger have demonstrated that even late vaccination intervention in response to an

27

outbreak could prevent a large number of cases, though early intervention will al-

28

ways have a larger impact [4, 5, 6, 7]. However, this may be context-specific and

29

vary with local epidemiology and outbreak patterns. The response to the Katanga

30

outbreak provides an opportunity to retrospectively study the effectiveness of the

31

campaigns conducted in mitigating excess morbidity. More generally, important

32

lessons could be learned about the relationship between response times and effec-

33

tiveness of campaigns, and how campaign targets could be selected in the future to

34

ensure greatest impact.

35

We studied the 2015 measles outbreak and responsive mass vaccination cam-

36

paigns conducted as part of the standard epidemic response to assess whether the

37

most-affected areas could have been predicted from information on previous out-

38

breaks and administrative or otherwise estimated vaccination coverage. We further

39

investigated the outbreak in several health zones using a mathematical model of

40

measles transmission, to quantify the impact of vaccination campaigns that were

41

conducted in those areas.

42

Methods

43

Data sources and cleaning

44

Suspected measles cases (WHO definition) from 2010–16 were collated from the

45

integrated disease surveillance (IDS) system, described previously in [2]. These

46

data are split into age groups 1-4 years and 5 years and over, at the level of health

47

zones. The database did not contain any information on cases under the age of 1

48

year.

49

Administrative coverage data from 2009-16 collected by the Ministry of Health

50

was available as the number of doses administered per week was collected at the

51

level of health zones, separated into age groups 9-11 months and 12-23 months.

52

Population denominators were extracted from the coverage data. Since the last

53

census in DRC prior to this study had been done in 1981, these numbers are subject

54

to considerable uncertainty.

55

We further used vaccination coverage estimates from a previous study [8]. These

56

used data collected as part of the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in 2013–

57

14, extrapolated from geo-located information on children’s vaccination status from

58

vaccine cards and parental recall. We averaged the estimates by month of age to

59

arrive at the proportion of under-5 year olds that were unvaccinated, that is had

60

received no dose of measles-containing vaccine.

61

Information on reactive mass vaccination campaigns conducted in 2015 was ex-

62

tracted from MSF reports. The total number of vaccine doses administered was

63

collated at the level of health zones, and at various temporal resolutions from days

64

to a single number of doses delivered for a whole campaign.

65

Factors that could predict outbreak size

66

We tested the predictability of outbreaks from demographic factors and outbreak

67

and vaccination history in a negative binomial Generalized Linear Model with log-

68

arithmic link. Robust standard errors and p-values were calculated using the sand-

69

wich R package [9, 10]. The number of suspected cases reported during the 2015

70

outbreak at the health zone level was modelled as a function of health zone popu-

71

lation size, the number of cases in the 2010–13 outbreak, MoH administrative and

72

estimated vaccination coverage.

73

Modelling measles with mass vaccination campaigns

74

We modelled measles transmission at the level of health zones using a stochastic

75

transmission model with a fixed time step of 2 weeks, corresponding to the generation

76

time of measles [11]. At each time step t, the number of new infections in health

77

zone i, Iit was drawn from a negative binomial distribution with mean λit Si(t−1)

78

and shape m, allowing for overdispersion of transmission, or superspreading [12]:

Iit ∼ NB(λit Si(t−1) , m)

79

where Si(t−1) and Ii(t−1) are the number of people susceptible and infected,

80

respectively, at time t−1, and λit is the force of infection experienced by susceptibles

81

in health zone i at time t:

λit = R0

82

83

Ii(t−1)
Ni

where Ni is the population size of health zone i, R0 is the basic reproduction
number.

84

When a mass vaccination campaign was conducted, the number of susceptible

85

people immunised was calculated by multiplying the number of doses administered

86

with the proportion of the population still susceptible Sit /Ni , and a campaign eﬀi-

87

ciency factor ei , estimated as part of the inference procedure described below. This

88

factor comprises both vaccine eﬀicacy and the eﬀiciency in targeting susceptible

89

children, which were not identifiable separately. With a perfect vaccine and random

90

distribution, this would take a value of 1. If vaccines were preferentially given to

91

susceptibles, it would take values of greater than 1 (subject to vaccine eﬀicacy). If

92

vaccines were preferentially given to already immune children, it would take values

93

of less than 1.

94

During a two-week span, half of vaccinations were modelled to be administered

95

before transmission occurred and half afterwards. While the measles vaccine takes

96

2 weeks to come into effect, it provides potentially high level of protection from

97

72 hours after administration [13, 14, 15]. We therefore assumed that vaccination

98

starts to fully immunise a child instantaneously.

99

For the counterfactual scenarios of how the outbreaks would have evolved with-

100

out a reactive mass vaccination, we simulated the model from the time of the mass

101

vaccination campaigns, but without reducing the number of susceptibles as a con-

102

sequence of vaccination. We then drew samples from the joint distribution of tra-

103

jectories and observations, to obtain alternative trajectories of observed cases. To

104

evaluate the impact of the campaigns, we calculated the reduction in the number of

105

cases observed in each of the trajectories. If this yielded a negative difference (i.e., if

106

random sampling yielded alternative trajectories with more cases than the observed

107

ones), we treated the impact as 0 (i.e., same number of cases in both scenarios).

108

Selection of health zones for fitting and estimating populations

109

The health zones selected for the dynamic model were ones that reported more

110

than 10 cases in at least one week in 2015 and had a reactive mass vaccination

111

campaign with the number of doses delivered and results from a follow-up coverage

112

survey available. A total of eight health zones were modelled, including the one

113

that saw most cases (Malemba-Nkulu, 8856 reported cases) and 7 of the 13 health

114

zones with most cases in 2015: Ankoro (3910), Kinkondja (2773), Mukanga (2723),

115

Bukama (2632), Songa (928) and Kabalo (904).

116

Since a large proportion of cases was found in children (77% in 1-to-5 year olds,

117

with no further age-breakdown available), and none of the vaccination campaigns

118

targeted over-15 year olds, we modelled measles transmission to be occurring ex-

119

clusively in under-5 year olds. The relevant population sizes were estimated as the

120

number of doses administered in the vaccination campaigns divided by the coverage

121

estimated from concurrent vaccination surveys. Where vaccination campaigns were

122

limited to under-5 or under-10 year olds, we estimated the total population size

123

under 15 as 2.72 or 1.39 times the estimated population size, respectively, based on

124

multipliers used for estimating the sizes of age groups in the administrative coverage

125

data provided.

126

Model fitting and counterfactual scenarios

127

The model was fitted simultaneously to the eight selected health zones. The likeli-

128

hood of observing bi-weekly incidence Dit in health zone i at time t was taken to

129

follow a negative binomial distribution with fixed overdispersion ϕ.

130

where ρ is the proportion of cases that is reported, $µ is the rate of background

reporting of measles, either due to cases that were not part of the epidemic or

132

misclassification, for example of rubella cases, and ϕ is the reporting overdispersion.

distribution on the mean reporting rate was weakly informed by a coverage survey

Further, there was a positive correlation of reported incidence in 2015 and admin-

Combining these factors and population size in a regression model confirms these

the coverage estimate from DHS data (-1.1, p<0.001), but both retained predictive

value, the coverage estimate strongly so. This suggests that some predictive value

183

of case numbers in 2010–13, and strong predictive value of the coverage estimate

184

was retained at the lower level of the health zone.

The impact of mass vaccination campaigns

186

To investigate the impact of the mass vaccination campaign in more detail, we

187

fitted a dynamic model to the case trajectories in 8 health zones (Fig. 6). We

188

estimated a basic reproduction number of 4.3 (mean; interquartile range, IQR: 4.0–

189

4.5) and an average reporting rate of 24% (IQR: 19%-29%), corresponding to a

190

total of 77,000 (IQR: 73,000–81,000; 95% CI: 66,000–91,000) estimated cases from

191

19,079 reported cases in the 8 health zones. On average, 55% (IQR: 49%-62%) of

under-5 year olds were estimated to have been immune before the outbreak. The

estimated campaign eﬀicacy factor ranged from 0.21 (IQR: 0.09–0.31) in Kinkondja

In total, we estimate that 21,000 (IQR: 16,000–27,000; 95% CI: 8300–38,000)

196

cases were averted by the vaccination campaigns in the seven health zones analysed,

197

corresponding to relative reduction in case load of 21% (IQR: 17%–25%, 95% CI:

198

9.3%–34%). Of the approximately 250,000 doses delivered to under-5 year olds

199

in the 8 health zones, we estimated 22,000 (IQR: 17,000–26,000, 95% CI: 11,000–

200

37,000) or 9.2% (IQR: 7.2%–11%, 95% CI: 4.5%–15%) of administered doses went

201

to susceptible children.

202

There was heterogeneity in impact between health zones. The greatest abso-

203

lute impact achieved by a mass vaccination campaign in the health zones investi-

204

gated was in Malemba-Nkulu with 6800 (IQR: 4000–9100; 95% CI: 0–17,000) cases

205

averted with 26,208 doses, while the greatest relative impact was in Kabalo with a

206

33% (IQR: 17%–54%; 95% CI: 0%–73%) reduction in case load from an estimated

207

20,727 doses (Table 4). On the other hand, only 230 (IQR: 0–810; 95% CI: 0–

208

2400) or 2.4% (IQR: 0%–11%; 95% CI: 0%–29%) of cases were estimated to have

209

been averted in Bukama from an estimate 31,400 doses. Speed of implementation

210

of the mass vaccination campaign (or shorter delay to implementation) was highly

211

correlated with a greater relative reduction of cases (Pearson’s p = -0.85, p=0.008).

Discussion

213

In spite of repeated strategic and reactive vaccination campaigns, large measles

214

outbreaks continue to occur in Katanga, DRC, causing significant morbidity and

215

mortality. Strategies to mitigate the burden of measles are urgently needed. Here

216

we conducted both predictive and retrospective modelling of the measles outbreaks

217

in Katanga in 2015, with the aim to evaluate the impact of the vaccination response

218

as well as potential for improvement.

219

The predictability of outbreaks is related to the quality of the available data. We

220

found little relationship between reported administrative vaccination coverage and

221

observed incidence. In fact, there was a small positive correlation, that is more cases

222

occur where vaccination uptake as indicated by the EPI programme is higher. This

223

could be because high routine vaccination rates might be an indicator of surveillance

224

quality and therefore case reporting. At the same time, Strategic Immunisation

225

Activities were conducted across Katanga after the 2011 outbreak [22]. We did not

226

have access to any details of these campaigns, which may have been targeted at areas

227

with low reported vaccination rates, thus raising immunity in those health zones.

228

Not all of the suspected cases included in this study may have been measles and

229

instead have been misdiagnoses due to rubella or other causes of rash [23]. While we

230

included a parameter for misclassification in the modelling analysis, this is diﬀicult

231

to identify and may be an underestimate. Lastly, there is uncertainty around the
15

232

population estimates used as denominator when estimating coverage, as high rates

233

of migration and urban growth make existing data quickly outdated.

234

Vaccination rates as estimated from cluster surveys as part of the DHS pro-

235

gramme, on the other hand, were well correlated with case data, with higher vac-

236

cination rates corresponding to lower case burden. These estimates encompass all

237

vaccination activities and not just routine immunisation, and they do not suffer

238

from denominator issues caused by uncertainty in the population sizes within health

239

zones.

240

Reconstructing the outbreak with a mathematical model of the case trajectories

241

suggested that reactive mass vaccination campaigns reduced the case load substan-

242

tially, and more so the earlier it was implemented. We estimated that tens of thou-

243

sands of susceptibles were immunised during those campaigns and, consequently,

244

tens of thousands of cases averted in under-5 year olds. While the estimated over-

245

all proportion of doses that went to susceptibles may appear low at approximately

246

10%, this must be seen in the context of conducting vaccination campaigns during

247

ongoing outbreaks, where part of the population may already have been infected

248

and thus naturally immunised. In all health zones, we estimated that vaccines were

249

preferentially given to immune children, who may have been immunised through

250

routine vaccination, been targeted in previous campaigns, or infected and acquired

251

natural immunity during the ongoing or previous outbreaks. At the same time, the

252

estimated 21,000 cases averted correspond to a reduction in burden of over 20%.

253

In the health zones modelled, the case-fatality ratio in the reported data was 1.2%,

254

suggesting that around a hundred infant lives were probably saved by the campaigns.

255

Our transmission model suffered from several limitations. We did not have access

256

to an age breakdown of cases older than 5 years, and information on under-1 year olds

257

was missing completely. Because of this, we only modelled transmission in under-

258

5 year olds. At 77% of reported cases, it seems safe to assume that transmission

259

in under-5 year olds was driving the outbreaks. The estimated basic reproduction

260

number of 4.3 (IQR: 4.0–4.5) is small in comparison with other settings, possibly

261

because transmission does not occur in school-like settings with close mixing of

262

large numbers of children, but rather households and communities affecting children

263

before they reach school age.

264

The estimated impact of the campaigns might have been greater if cases averted

265

in over 5-year olds had been taken into account. We further ignored any spatial

266

progression of the outbreak or connectivity between health zones and modelled each

267

area in isolation. In reality, mass vaccination campaigns that reduced cases in one

268

area may well have prevented subsequent cases in nearby areas in other health zones.

269

Lastly, we assumed constant reporting rates. If, on the other hand, reporting quality

270

changes between regions or over time, it would affect our fits which would interpret

271

these changes as changes in transmission rather than reporting.

272

In spite of enormous efforts, measles is proving diﬀicult to control in Katanga.

273

On the 10th June 2019, the DRC Ministry of Health oﬀicially declared a new measles

274

outbreak in 23 out of the 26 provinces of DRC, with initial cases for this outbreak

275

reported in late 2018. This new measles outbreak coincided with an ongoing Ebola

276

outbreak in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces of DRC which had begun in August

277

2018. There have been suggestions that the diversion of resources and attention

278

towards the Ebola response may have reduced the healthcare capacity required to

279

respond to a surge in measles cases [24]. Although at the time of writing, the health

280

zones most affected by the measles outbreak were outside the area where Ebola was

281

mostly concentrated, it has been shown during the 2013–16 outbreak in West Africa

282

that reduced vaccination services as a result of an Ebola outbreak can have a severe

283

impact on measles circulation [25, 26, 27].

284

The ability to partly predict the case load in 2015 from outbreaks in 2010–13 at

285

the province level suggests that there might be underlying problems in the provision

286

of routine immunisation services that did not change in the intervening time. At

287

the end of outbreaks as big as the ones occurring in Katanga, not many children are

288

left susceptible, whether a mass vaccination campaign has been conducted or not.

289

The fact that another big outbreak could happen so soon after the last suggests a

290

rapid increase in susceptibles that have not been served by the routine vaccination

291

programme, and strengthening this should be a priority. At the same time, it is

292

clear that the mass vaccination campaigns only prevent part of the observed cases,

293

partly because of unavoidable delays in confirming an outbreak and launching a

294

campaign. Preventive strategies based on predictive models have a potential to

295

have a much greater impact if they can prevent outbreaks altogether, but their use

296

is based on the predictive potential of the models used. We found that vaccination

297

estimates based on a spatial model applied previously to vaccination survey data was

298

a good predictor of outbreak size at the relatively fine level of health zones. There is

299

enormous promise in using such estimates to guide strategic immunisation activities

300

and close any existing gaps in immunity. As has been proven many times over,

301

it is only through strong and comprehensive routine vaccination, supplemented by

302

strategic campaigns where necessary, that sustained measles control and, ultimately,

303

elimination can be achieved.
