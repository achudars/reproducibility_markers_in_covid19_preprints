Abstract
Introduction: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a known risk factor for
abnormal cervical cytology and cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate cervical
cytological abnormalities and its relation with CD4 (T4 Lymphocyte) count among HIV
seropositive women.
Methods: We conducted a study on 58 HIV positive women referred to Ahvaz Counseling
Center for Behavioral Disease, southwest of Iran between 2016 and 2017. Pap smear was
performed for all participants from the cervix and endocervix. Patient's’ characteristics including
age, duration of disease, treatment with anti-retroviral treatment (ART), marital status, number of
children, and contraception method were also recorded. Cervical cytological abnormalities
reported as Bethesda system (TBS). A regular blood sample was taken from all the patients to
evaluate the CD4 cells counts. Logistic regression models were used to obtain OR of presences
of cytological abnormalities related to CD4 counts, controlling for important factors.
Results: Out of 58 patients only 5 were not under ART. We demonstrated that 29.3 % of patients
had squamous cell abnormalities and these abnormalities, was more prevalent among 30-40
years old patients (70.6%). The prevalence of ASC-US (Atypical Squamous Cells of
Undetermined Significance), LSIL (Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions) and HSIL
(High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions) were 19.0%, 3.4%, and 6.9% respectively.
Overall 9 patients need to repeat Pap smear test. Presence of cervical cytological abnormalities
was not associated with the CD4 count, even after adjusting for the variable such age, duration of
disease and ART.

Conclusion: We found a high prevalence of ASC-US in HIV-infected women which was
independent of age, duration of diseases and history of ART. Though cervical cancer screening
in this population might have a substantial public health benefit.

Introduction
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) still is one of the major causes of death
worldwide[1, 2] and cancer is the leading cause of death in these population[3]. Since the
primary demonstration of Harold zur Hausen in the early 1980s, the link between genital HPV
infections and cervical cancer are well established[4, 5] and accountable for 70% to 80% of
advanced cervical cancers[6, 7].
About half a million new cervical cancer and 266,000 death occurred in 2012 worldwide[8].
According to the WHO and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), cervical
cancer is the second most common cancer in women in low and middle-income countries[9, 10].

Partially the differences in the occurrence of disease in developed and developing nation could
be due to the absence of screening and lifestyle changes programs, insufficient infrastructure and
trained personnel[10, 11]. Women with HIV are at greater risk of developing squamous cell
adhesion (SIL) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer[12]. Several
studies have shown that the incidence of CIN and cervical cancer in women with HIV is about 2
to 22 times higher than that of HIV-negative women[13, 14]. Cervical epithelial cell
abnormalities (ECA) represent a range of SIL from mild to severe dysplasia to aggressive
concessions[15]. Unfortunately, despite the existing recommendations, most of the HIV-positive
women are not screened properly[16] and a large number of deaths are due to delayed detection
of cervical cancer[12].
Cervical carcinoma is a preventable disease through early cytological and cytotoxic screening
that indicates the role of Pap smear[13, 17]. Women in advanced stages of HIV (Stage III and
IV), having multiple sexual partners and long-term contraceptive pills (OCP), have increased the
risk of ECA[13, 18]. Immunological status such low CD4 levels also play an important role in
cervical carcinogenesis[13].
The present study was conducted to evaluate the cytological changes in the pap smear and its
association with the CD4 count. We hypothesis that prevalence of abnormal Pap smear among
HIV seropositive women is higher than healthy population and CD4 count linked with this
situation.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was done among a cohort of fifty eight HIV seropositive women
above 18 years old. Subjects attending Ahvaz Counseling Center for Behavioral Diseases
between 20th March 2016 and 19th March 2017 recruited for the study after the Ethical

Committee’s approval. All patients were informed and written consent was taken before
enrolment. The diagnosis of HIV was based on the presence of two HIV Ab ELISA positive tests
and confirmation by western blot test. Pregnant women, subject with the irregular periodic cycle,
virgin, and those with a history of cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer were excluded from the
study (see figure 1).
Patient and Public Involvement
We did not involve patients or the public in our work. Socio-demographic information including
age, duration of disease, marital status, number of children, mode of HIV transmission,
contraception method, and history of ART (at least a month treatment assumed to be under
treatment) was collected. A blood sample was taken from all the patients on completion of
the morning visit. CD4+ lymphocytes count determined using CyFlow miniPOC which is
reliable and accurate[19] and reported as cells in a microliter (cells/μl).

Cytology sampling
Pap smear tests conducted by a trained midwife and all procedure performance were under the
responsibility of a gynecologist from Department of Obstetrics and Gynecologist, Razi hospital,
Ahvaz, Iran. The exocervix and endocervix samples were taken with Cervex-Brush® Combi in
accordance with the standard protocol[20]. Brush disconnected from the handles, and the heads
were deposited into a BD Sure Path™ ethanol-based preservative fluid, which can be stored for
weeks at room temperature. Samples vial capped, labeled and delivered to Pasteur lab on the
liquid-based media. In the laboratory, blood cells and inflammatory exudates were removed from
the suspension and the samples homogenized. The smears were confectioned on slides and
stained using BD PrepStain slide processor. All samples were interpreted and reported by a
pathologist according to the Bethesda system 2001[21] which is comparable with 2014 with a

minor revision[22]. In the current study the cervical cytological interpretation was denominated
as negative for intraepithelial lesions and malignancy (NILM) which includes inflammatory
changes, organisms, atrophic changes and reactive changes; atypical squamous cells of
undetermined significance (ASC-US), cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H), squamous intraepithelial
lesions (SILs) including low-grade SILs (LSILs) and high-grade SILs (HSILs) and invasive
carcinoma. The presence and severity of inflammation in the smears reported as mild (< 30
inflammatory cells high power field), moderate (30 to 100 inflammatory cells/high power field)
and severe (> 100 inflammatory cells/high power field). Prevalence of bacterial vaginosis
(BV), Trichomonas vaginitis (TV), and vaginal candidiasis (VC) was determined in the samples.
Women with Pap smear abnormality were referred to the Department of Obstetrics &
Gynecology as per American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology[23].

Statistical Analysis
Characteristics of patients including mean, frequencies, and contingency tables described. Visual
inspection of data and Shapiro-Wilk W test were used to investigate normality of variables. We
calculated Square-root of CD4 count since it was not normally distributed (i.e. heteroscedastic
standard division). Logistic regression was used to find the association between CD4 count and
presences of squamous cells abnormality (ASC-US and SIL) and NILM, adjusted for important
risk factors. The results are given as absolute change in the CD4 count for presences of
cytological abnormality (i.e. ASUS/SIL and NILM). For model selection we investigated
possible predictors of CD4 such age, duration of disease, history of ART (yes vs. no) and
contraception as an indicator variable for oral contraceptive pill, tubal ligation, and condom) and
marital status (married vs. unmarried), using t-test and Pearson’s correlation coefficient, as

of fungal organism morphology consistent with Candida Spp (figure 2b). Non-neoplastic cases
with metaplasia and atrophic cervicitis were 9 and 2 cases respectively. Normal results without
any cytological anomalies, organism and inflammation were observed in 25.9% of patients.
Seventeen (29.3%) patients had abnormalities in cervical squamous cells, including 2 (11.7%)
low LSILs (figure 1c), 4 (23.5%) High HSILs (figure 2d) and 11 (64.7%) ASC-US (figure 2e). In
the present study, most of the anomalies (70.6%) were observed in the age group of 30 to 40
years’ old.

ART, marital status (married vs. unmarried), using the oral contraceptive pill, tubal ligation, and
condom, with CD4 cells counts but age was negatively and statistically significant predictor of
CD4 (r=0.33, P=0.01). However, the cytological abnormality was not related to the
immunological status of patients indicated by CD4 cells count (see table 3).

1. Discussion
In the current study, the prevalence of abnormal Pap smear in women with HIV was 29.3%,
which is almost 6 time higher than in the general population. Comparable outbreak has been
reported previously showing 26% cytological abnormal, but unlike our finding which ASC-US
were the most common form of abnormality, they reported more LSIL lesions form[24]. In a
study in Nigeria based on the Bethesda classification system, 27.6% of young HIV seropositive
women had cervical abnormalities, which predominantly were LSIL (12.2%),[25]. Similar
studies also reported that ECA is prevelant among HIV seropositive women ranging from 20 to
26%,[26, 27].

Various national and even local scale survey showed that prevalence of cervical abnormalities in
HIV seropositive women is higher than normal population[28-37]. Therefore, it can be said that
HIV is one of the independent risk factors for abnormalities and cervical cancer.
Our observation was n line with Gentient and Kodey studies which have demonstrated the most
influenced sub-population were women above 30 years we have found that 70% of cervical
abnormality apear to be among women aged 30 to 40 years[28, 30].
Also, it appears that 65% of smears were inflammatory and coexistences of inflammation and
ASC-US observed in 81% of cases which is consistent with the results of other studies[28, 29].
Perhaps due to the smale number of observation alike to other studies we did not detected
cervical cancer[29]. However many other studies showed an incidence of approximately equal to
0.1% during follow up period[30, 33, 34]
We did not find a link between the prevalence of Pap test abnormality and duration of disease or
being under ART[27, 28] however, inconsistency exists in the literature[34].
We were unable to detect a statistically significant link between cervical squamous cell
abnormalities and serum CD4 count. These results coincided with the findings of the study by
Kodey et. all [28]. However, many studies have shown that HIV infected women with CD4
lower than 200 cells/μL or less than 350 are at high risk for cervical cell abnormalities[27, 30,
33, 34, 38-40]. This could be due to the fact that most of our patients had a CD4 count equal or
more than 500 cells/µL and this probably lower power of our data to observe a risk difference if
one existed.
in the current study although methodologically we obeyed from standard and globally reliable
protocols and also controlled for many important individuals and environmental confounding
factor, however, encountered some restrictions. A first limitation is a small number of samples

thus; results should be interpreted with caution. In addition, because the study was conducted
only in one center, the results of the present study cannot be generalized to the whole society.
High prevalence of abnormal Pap test among HIV seropositive women is a public health
concern. Providing preventive measure such early detection of HPV as additional screening
options in HIV-infected women is very important. Also needs for an updated guideline for
cervical cancer screening and clinical management of the susceptible group.
