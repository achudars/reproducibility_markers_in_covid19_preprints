ABSTRACT
Objective:
We aimed to identify (1) differences in opioid poisoning mortality among population groups, (2)
geographic clusters of opioid-related deaths over time, and (3) health conditions co-occurring with opioidrelated death in Ohio by computational analysis.
Materials and Methods:
We used a large-scale Ohio vital statistic dataset from the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) and U.S.
Census data from 2010-2016. We surveyed population differences with demographic profiling and use of
relative proportions, conducted spatiotemporal pattern analysis with spatial autocorrelation via Moran
statistics at the census tract level, and performed comorbidity analysis using frequent itemset mining and
association rule mining.
Results:
Our analyses found higher rates of opioid-related death in people aged 25-54, whites, and males. We also
found that opioid-related deaths in Ohio became more spatially concentrated during 2010-2016, and
tended to be most clustered around Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. Drug abuse, anxiety and
cardiovascular disease were found to predict opioid-related death.
Discussion:
Comprehensive data-driven spatiotemporal analysis of opioid-related deaths provides essential
identification of demographic, geographic and health factors related to opioid abuse. Future research
should access personal health information for more detailed comorbidity analysis, as well as expand
spatiotemporal models for real-time use.
Conclusion:
Computational analyses revealed demographic differences in opioid poisoning, changing regional patterns
of opioid-related deaths, and health conditions co-occurring with opioid overdose for Ohio from 20102016, providing essential knowledge for both government officials and caregivers to establish policies
and strategies to best combat the opioid epidemic.

INTRODUCTION
Opioids are a class of drugs derived from the opium poppy plant that block the reception of pain signals
in the brain. Opioids include prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine, and
morphine and are used to alleviate chronic pain and manage postoperative pain. Opioids are also used
illegally, including heroin and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl (which is also used medically). While
the number of opioid prescriptions written has skyrocketed in the last two decades, illegal opioid use,
opioid abuse and accidental opioid overdose have also increased.[1] Opioid-related overdoses are
commonly referred to and categorized as “opioid poisoning (T40.0-T40.4, T40.6)” according to
International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes (ICD-10).[2] The mortality rate due to opioid
poisoning has consistently increased each year and now it is recognized as a national crisis.[3] Since 2000,
death from drug overdoses has increased by 137%, while deaths from opioid overdoses has increased by
200%.[4] According to the data released by the U.S Department of Health and Human Services, 130
people died each day from opioid-related drug overdoses in 2017 and 11.5 million people misused
prescription opioids.[5]
The opioid epidemic is a nationwide issue, and scientific research is key to identifying causal factors,
discovering susceptible communities and developing policies to address this problem. Increased
availability of healthcare data presents a tremendous opportunity for data analysis to identify potential
predictors of opioid misuse and predict patients susceptible to opioid misuse.[6] There have been several
attempts to apply computational or statistical analysis to solve the problems associated with the opioid
epidemic.[7-11] The purposes of these studies varied, ranging from understanding and detecting
geographical clusters or hot spots where opioid misuse has occurred within urban neighborhoods,[12] to
developing a surveillance model to identify patients who are misusing opioids or are over-prescribed.[10]
Spatiotemporal analysis has been applied to identify relationships between environmental or economic
factors and opioid misuse or overdose.[12-14] Through these attempts, several predictive covariates were
revealed. Housing vacancy, dilapidated housing and misdemeanor arrests have been shown to be
significantly associated with illicit drug activity.[12, 13] Additionally, individuals with a higher income

and greater access to healthcare have been found to be associated with prescription opioid poisoning.[14]
Existing research on comorbidity with opioid abuse mostly focuses on psychiatric disorders and cooccurring substance abuse.[7-9,15-18] Logistic regression models have been developed to predict patients
who may be susceptible to prescription opioid abuse.[7-9] Comorbid psychiatric disorders have been
considered for their impact on the efficacy of various treatments of opioid use disorder,[15] and literature
reviews have found high rates of co-occurrence between opioid use disorder and anxiety, psychiatric
comorbidity, and drug use.[16-18]
These studies focus on either city-level spatiotemporal patterns, and/or solely on abuse of a single class of
opioids. Our research performs comprehensive profiling, spatial pattern mining, and comorbidity analysis
on a large-sized dataset collected at a state-wide level for all opioid-related deaths. Our research utilizes a
large-scale vital statistic dataset from the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) and U.S. Census datasets to
perform retrospective and extensive analysis at a statewide and census tract level. The purpose of this
study is to identify demographic and spatial factors, as well as co-occurring health conditions that are
associated with opioid-related overdose. To achieve this, we applied several data mining approaches such
as clustering and frequent pattern mining. We expect that our results will inform policy makers, law
enforcement, emergency health services, and caregivers to predict and prevent opioid abuse throughout
Ohio.

METHODS
Data description
In this paper, we used ODH mortality data containing decedent information by opioid poisoning and
misuse. We were approved to access limited and identifiable data, completed the Data Use Agreement
(DUA), and de-identified decedent data. Access and use of the data was approved by the ODH IRB. We
filtered ODH mortality data by selecting only opioid-related records. We considered a death opioidrelated if the record had a positive value for any of the following nine indicators: Methadone, opiates,
prescription opiates, Fentanyl, Fentanyl and Analogues, Carfentanil, designer opioids, commonly
prescribed opioids, and/or other opioids. Then, we chose records for analysis which contained positive

values for “Opioid Related Death,” “Unintended Death,” “Undetermined death,” and “Drug Poisoning
Injury Mechanism.”
As a result, 13,094 records satisfied these conditions from 2010-2016. Of these records, 13,057 were not
missing any values in the demographic and location fields. Figure 1 shows the entire process of data
refinement. This dataset was used in our comorbidity analysis mentioned in the next section.
This dataset was used for the remaining analysis and is hereafter referred to as “ODH-Opioid data.” We
obtained publicly available demographic data from the 2010 U.S. Census Bureau and from the American
Community Survey (ACS) from 2011-2016 to gather characteristics of the entire population of Ohio, as
well as from each Ohio census tract.[19]
Analysis
Our analysis of 2010-2016 opioid overdose data is composed of the following three sections: 1)
demographic-based analysis to survey differences among population groups; 2) spatiotemporal pattern
analysis (census tract level) to discover potential global and local spatial clusters; 3) co-occurrence
analysis with cause of death and its corresponding health condition to identify potential patterns or rules
between them. As the data covers a seven-year period, it is possible to confirm trends and patterns over
the years.
1. Demographic-based analysis to survey disparities among population groups
Decedent demographic information, such as age, race and sex, was taken from ODH-Opioid data. Then,
the same population-level demographic data in Ohio was obtained from the ACS. Based on these datasets,
we compared and analyzed the prevalence of opioid-induced deaths in population groups relative to
population distribution. We calculated relative proportions for each population group based on these two
datasets for seven years. Then, we performed a paired t-test to investigate the statistical difference
between the proportion values of two datasets.
2. Spatiotemporal pattern analysis (census tract level) to discover potential global and local spatial
clusters

Each record in ODH-Opioid data contains geographical information about a given decedent, such as
residence or place of death. It is necessary to investigate whether deaths tend to be focused in a specific
region or dispersed within a dataset to predict spatial patterns of opioid abuse. To achieve this, we applied
spatial autocorrelation, which can measure the degree to which an object is similar to other nearby objects.
More specifically, a positive value of spatial autocorrelation indicates the relationship between the value
at a location and the values of its neighbors is positive; otherwise, the spatial autocorrelation is negative.
Moran statistics are one of the commonly used approaches to measure this relationship.[20] There are two
types of Moran’s I statistics: global and local.
Global Moran’s I statistics provide a single measure of spatial autocorrelation for an attribute in a region
as a whole, whereas Local Moran’s I statistics provide a measure of the tendency of a given unit to have
an attribute value that is correlated with values of nearby areas. Local spatial autocorrelation analysis is
based on LISA (Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation) statistics and is computed for each individual
unit. The following two functions represent Global and Local Moran’s I statistics:

In our analysis, we used census tract as the unit of region. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent
statistical subdivisions within a county. We aggregated the number of deaths by census tract level and
then normalized the number of deaths by dividing the total population in the corresponding Tract ID. This
normalization allowed spatial autocorrelation to be performed with the ratio of the actual population to
the number of deaths in the area. We used these census tract death rates for spatiotemporal pattern
analysis.
We performed spatiotemporal pattern analysis by using a free, open source software tool, GeoDa.[21] We
applied Global Moran’s I statistics to Ohio at the state-level and LISA statistics to each region by census
tract. GeoDa also reported p-values to show statistical significance, and we applied 0.05 as our alpha level.
3. Comorbidity analysis with cause of death and its corresponding health condition
This analysis aimed to identify which health conditions frequently co-occurred with opioid poisoning, and
whether the cause of death exhibited significant associations with co-occurring health conditions. We
applied frequent itemset mining and association rule mining to ODH-Opioid data to carry out these
analyses. Although ODH-Opioid data are filtered as “death by opioid misuse,” the specific causes of
death are more diverse. In the ODH mortality dataset, cause of death was listed by ICD codes (ICD-9 and
ICD-10). In order to analyze the observed health conditions, we had to simplify the literal text as reported
for the deceased person to a standard term. Figure 2 shows the overall workflow for the text clustering
method we used to convert the literal text to a structured term. Then, we integrated cause of death with
converted health condition and applied frequent itemset mining to reveal which events (i.e. itemset)
frequently occur together.[22]
From the results of our frequent itemset mining, we performed association rule mining with a minimum
confidence of 0.5 in order to quantify the association between two itemsets. After sorting all rules by Lift
value, only the rules with at least one health condition in itemset A and at least one cause of death in
itemset B were selected from the results (Lift > 1: positive relationship, which means if A is present, then
B happens).

1. Demographic-based analysis to survey disparities among population groups
Using ODH-Opioid data, we compared the demographics between the overall Ohio population and those
who died due opioid poisoning. Figure 3 (A) shows the difference between population proportion and
mortality proportion by opioid poisoning across seven years for each age group. For example, while the
group aged 24-44 years made up an average of 25.1% of the overall population across the 7 years, the
same age group consisted of an average of 51.3% of the opioid deaths. There was a significant difference
between the two groups for all ages except the 55-60 age group. This result implies that the pattern of
mortality by opioid poisoning is different from the general population distribution. In particular, groups
aged 25-44 and 45-54 years died by opioid poisoning more frequently than any other age groups
compared to the general population distribution. We performed the same analysis for race and sex.
Figures 3 (B) and (C) show the comparison results. There was a statistically significant difference
identified between the mortality and population distribution for all races except for “Native Hawaiian or
Other Pacific Islander,” with the white population exhibiting the highest mortality counts. Similarly, there
was a statistically significant difference for both males and females, with a higher fatality proportion for
males, and a lower fatality proportion for females, as compared to their respective population proportions.
In summary, between 2010-2016 in Ohio, people who were white, male and aged 25-54 years were most
likely to die by opioid poisoning. Table 1 shows detailed results of the statistical tests.
Finally, as shown in Figure 3 (D), we calculated the mortality rate per 10,000 people for each age group
in each year. As we concluded earlier, morality rates for age groups 25-44 and 45-54 were the highest and
the ratio increased with time.

2. Spatiotemporal pattern analysis (census tract level) to discover potential global and local spatial
clusters
As seen in Figure 4, the Global Moran's I value, which provides a single measure of spatial
autocorrelation for an attribute in a region as a whole, continuously increased from 2010-2016. This
signifies higher specificity and lower randomization of clustering, meaning that the opioid crisis became
more spatially concentrated during these years.
Figure 5 demonstrates the results of our spatiotemporal pattern analysis for each census tract. As shown in
Figure 5, there are four types of patterns of LISA statistics as follows: High-High, High-Low, Low-High,
and Low-Low. The first field of a given LISA pattern indicates the degree of LISA statistics in the
corresponding region and the second field of a given LISA pattern indicates the degree of LISA statistics
of the neighboring regions. For example, a High-Low designation for a certain region means the LISA
statistics of the region is significantly high but the values of its neighboring regions are significantly low.
Generally, we can consider High-High and Low-Low status as spatial clusters because these regions have
similar LISA statistics values. It was revealed that the High-High and Low-Low regions have become
increasingly dispersed from 2010 to 2016.

Table 2 shows the top 10 census tracts represented by county name based on the LISA statistics value. As
a result, it was confirmed that the counties located inside or near Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati,
which are the most populated in Ohio, had the highest concentration of deaths by opioid poisoning.

3. Co-occurrence analysis with cause of death and its corresponding health condition
Table 3 shows the representative terms for health conditions of the deceased derived from a text
clustering approach. As mentioned in the Methods section, we used these health condition terms and
cause of death classified by ICD-10 code as an input of frequent itemset and pattern mining to reveal the
underlying relationship between health condition and cause of death with regard to opioid poisoning
mortality. Of the total 13,094 records, only 2,887 records contained data for both health condition and
cause of death, so the remaining records which had a value of “NA” were excluded for the co-occurrence
analysis.

Frequent itemset mining was performed after setting the minimum support count to 200. From the results,
the itemsets which had more than two items including one or more health conditions were selected. Table
4 shows the top 10 results based on frequency for this analysis. We revealed that cardiovascular disease
was the most prevalent concomitant health condition in decedents by opioid poisoning. Cardiovascular
disease frequently occurred with death due to hypertensive heart disease without heart failure. Drug abuse
frequently occurred with death due to mental and behavioral disorders because of multiple drug use.
Additionally, mental health conditions, such as anxiety, were frequently associated with opioid poisoning
mortality.
Table 5 shows the results of association rule mining. We identified that drug abuse, anxiety and
cardiovascular disease were significantly and positively correlated with opioid poisoning mortality.

Table 3. Results of clustering health conditions. We set the number of clusters to 70 through several empirical
experiments. For each cluster, we selected the most frequent term, and then redundant clusters were manually
removed by an expert. Through this post-processing, we could obtain 31 representative terms which indicates a
given decedent’s health condition.

DISCUSSION
The opioid epidemic is one of the most pressing issues affecting Ohio, and news reports of overdose
deaths constantly remind us of this. In August 2019, six people died of suspected fentanyl overdose
within 24 hours, bringing the opioid-overdose death count to 10 for a three-day period.[23] All 10 deaths
occurred within Cuyahoga County, Ohio, which encompasses Cleveland. This horrific event reminds us
as researchers of the crucial need for research to prevent more deaths due to opioid overdose. Thus, with
the accessibility to opioid abuse and overdose data, it is imperative to apply computational analysis to
understanding the opioid epidemic.
To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no large-scale data driven approaches covering
comprehensive analysis including profiling, spatial pattern mining, and association rule mining with
statewide mortality records for all opioid-related deaths. Our research provides a comprehensive analysis
in these areas, showing that various data mining algorithms such as text mining, spatial clustering and
frequent pattern mining can be used to predict opioid overdose. The opioid epidemic is not only an
important issue for research in the public health field, but also in the computer science field.
The first approach of our three-pronged analysis utilized demographic profiling and relative proportions
to find disparities in opioid abuse among population groups. We found that people aged 25-44 and 45-54
died due to opioids more frequently than any other age group, and that whites and males also had higher
rates of death due to opioid overdose. Our second approach used spatial autocorrelation to map
geographical patterns of opioid abuse, and we found that opioid-related deaths have become more
spatially concentrated over time. In particular, Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati had the highest
concentration of deaths. Finally, our third approach focused on identifying health conditions that cooccurred with opioid-related death. We found that drug abuse, anxiety and cardiovascular disease were
significantly and positively correlated with death due to opioid overdose.
The increasing spatial concentration of opioid overdose deaths that we observed is an interesting finding.
From 1999-2004, the rate of opioid-related death rates in rural areas exceeded that in urban areas,[24] but
recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows an increase of drug

overdose deaths in urban areas compared to that of rural areas in 2017.[25] Our results are consistent with
this national pattern, which may suggest that Ohio undergoes similar changes in the spatial distribution of
opioid abuse, and/or that our spatiotemporal model can be used as a tool to predict patterns of opioid use
in consecutive years. Predictive geographical models would be essential in targeting prevention strategies
for specific regions, as well as allocating resources to areas most in need.
Our comorbidity findings are consistent with existing studies that have identified anxiety, mental illness,
and drug use to be associated with opioid abuse.[7,8,16-18] However, to our knowledge, other studies
have not found an association between opioid abuse and cardiovascular disease. This finding may be due
to the limited information from death records; only 22% contained information in the health condition
field. In future studies, we plan to collect more robust data by combining vital records from ODH data
and patient Electronic Health Record (EHR) data at the Cleveland Clinic. We recommend that similar
studies be performed with data from hospitals in Columbus and Cincinnati to understand larger patterns.
Such analyses can be used to develop a predictive model to stratify patient risk based on previously
identified predictors of opioid misuse, which will aid caregivers in prescription decision-making.
Furthermore, we suggest specific application of spatial pattern mining to be used to identify areas of
opioid abuse real-time, rather than solely in a retrospective fashion. A real-time predictive model would
be indispensable for law enforcement agents and emergency health service providers to predict and
prevent opioid abuse.

CONCLUSION
As data related to opioid abuse and overdose have recently become available, large-scale, computational
approaches to analysis are an imperative tool to combat the opioid epidemic. In this study, we utilized
seven years of Ohio vital statistics data to reveal the race, age group, and regional differences of opioid
poisoning. Additionally, we identified several prevalent health conditions that are frequently associated
with opioid-related deaths. Although the data we utilized was limited to Ohio and was retrospective in
nature, our findings help to understand the patterns and factors associated with opioid-related deaths,
which could be useful in the development of predictive models. We expect that our findings provide

essential knowledge to identify predictors of opioid misuse and predict the changing geographic pattern of
opioid overdoses, enabling government officials and caregivers to improve their strategies for prevention
and treatment of opioid abuse and to allocate resources most efficiently.
