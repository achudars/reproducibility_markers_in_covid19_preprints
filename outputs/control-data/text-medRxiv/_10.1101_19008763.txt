Abstract

Background: Hypermethylation of 06-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)promoter seen in high grade
gliomas (HGG) leads to the accumulation of O6-meG DNA damage which mispairs with thymine, requiring
recognition by mismatch repair protein dimer MutSα, whose primary component is coded by Human MutS homolog
protein 2 (hMSH2). O6-meG repair necessitates the interaction/combined action of MGMT andhMSH2 to maintain
genomic stability. Analysis of the correlation between MGMT methylation and hMSH2mRNAexpression in HGG
and their role in the prognosis was explored.
Methods: Study was performed on 54 primary-frontal lobe HGG tumors, MGMT promoter methylation was
detected by Q-MSP and Q-PCR was used to analyse hMSH2 m-RNA expression levels.
Results: MGMT methylation was seen in 62%patients the mean percentage of methylation (PoM) being
(17.62±17.20) %. MGMT PoM≥10% had improved Progression free survival (p=0.015) and ≥8% had better Overall
survival (p=0.043), indicating its predictive significance. Over expression of hMSH2 was seen in 50% patients with
a median fold change of 2.74 (p=0.021). Univariate analysis of high hMSH2 expression with therapy(CT+RT)
showed poor PFS (p=0.002). There was no correlation between MGMT methylation and hMSH2 expression.
Conclusion: MGMT PoM of ≥10% is a significant prognostic marker. Over expression of hMSH2 is prognostic
marker for poor treatment response. Lack of/aberrant correlation between MGMT andhMSH2 could indicate
impaired DNA repair of O6-meG in HGG, and this could be one of the factors responsible for both, gliomagenesis
and variations in treatment response.
Keywords: High grade glioma, DNA damage, O-6meG, MGMT, MMR,hMSH2.

1.Background:
Malignant high grade gliomas (HGG), are the fastest growing cancers, constitute Grade III and Grade IV
tumors(Louis et al. 2007). Prognosis and survival for patients with HGG are poor, and tumors are highly resistant to
chemotherapy and radiotherapy(Cabrini et al. 2015). Current standard of treatment includes chemotherapy (CT) with
alkylating agents such as temozolomide (TMZ) along with intermittent radiotherapy(RT), but most patients’ exhibit
rapid disease progression(Alvino et al. 2006).DNA damages per day occur at a high rate of 1000–1,000,000
molecular lesions per cell(H N et al. 2015).Hence, anefficient DNA repair system is required for the effective
maintenance of genome integrity(Frosina 2009). Glioma develops through accumulation of genetic alterations due to
DNA damage that allow the cells to escape normal growth-regulatory mechanisms(McLendon et al. 2008).DNA
repair genes play a key dual role in primary gliomagenesis as well as treatment response (Lahtz and Pfeifer 2011;
Perazzoli et al. 2015).DNA damaging agents often causes more than one type of damage, and more than one repair
pathway may be involved in repair process of each DNA damage(Iyama and Wilson 2014; Kinsella 2009). Direct
reversal of DNA damage and mismatch repair proteins are amongst the first to be recruited to the site of DNA
damage, therefore expression of genes involved in it are key to maintain genomic stability(Iyama and Wilson 2014).
Direct reversal of DNA damage repair system constitute,06-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene
which codes for the suicide enzyme MGMT, that protects the cells against lesions caused by alkylation of DNA at
the O-6 position of guanine.Methylation at CpG islands of the MGMT promoter leads to gene silencing and
decreased expression, and is among the well- studied process in HGG (Manuel et al. 2016).MGMT promoter
methylation status is a potential predictive marker for response to adjuvant radiotherapy plus chemotherapy,
particularly with alkylating agents like temozolomide (TMZ)(Park et al. 2012; Villani et al. 2015).This epigenetic
modification leads to cytotoxic effects, due to accumulation of errors in the form of O6-methylguanine (O6meG)(Bearzatto et al. 2000).These damages induce the formation of O6-meG: T and O6-meG: C mispairs during
DNA duplication and thereby subsequent recruitment of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system(Quiros, Roos,
and Kaina 2010).MMR is a post-replicative functional downstream pathway to MGMT. It plays a ubiquitous role in
ensuring replication fidelity and is responsible for correcting mismatch errors, preserving microsatellites’ and
thereby genomic integrity(Modrich 1994). MMR can detect and repair base-base and insertion–deletion mismatches
that are formed during DNA replication (Peltomaki 2003). Altered expression of MMR genes confer a mutator
phenotype with small genetic disruptions, leading to emergence of microsatellite instability and somatic

mutations(Vageli et al. 2012).MMR deficient tumor cells have accumulation of mutations coupled with replication
errors. In accordance with ‘futile repair’ model, the MutS component of the MMR system recognizes and attempts
to repair O6-meG:T andO6-meG:Cmispairs(Modrich and Lahue 1996). However, the repair event is not successful
resulting in the degradation of the pyrimidine-containing strand followed by subsequent reinsertion of C or T
opposite the O6-meG, since the methylated base is in the template strand and MMR targets the newly synthesized
strand(Hsieh and Yamane 2008). Human MutS homolog protein 2 (hMSH2)is the primary component for mismatch
recognition; it forms dimers MutSα along with hMSH6 or MutSβ along with hMSH3depending on the damage
occurred (Fishel 2015). Hence, the optimum expression of hMSH2 is critical among the other two genes for the
entire MMR system to carry its function. Studies on exploring the functional implication of mismatch repair genes
in HGG are limited, however there are reports indicating presence of microsatellite instability in adult high-grade
gliomas, which is a sign of aberrant MMR functioning(Demokan 2006; Viana-Pereira et al. 2011).Persistent O6meG mismatch errors are also associated with increased levels of sister chromatid exchanges and chromosome
aberrations (Hsieh and Yamane 2008). These damages along with aberrant methylation are dependent on MMR and
homologous recombination (HR) processing of the lesion(Kenyon et al. 2012).Recent evidence also suggests there
are clinically relevant alterations in the DNA- MMR system beyond alterations in the MGMT gene (Stark et al.
2015). High MGMT enzyme activity is known to confer resistance to O6-G-methylating agents through detoxifying
the DNA, but the actual apoptotic process requires a functional MMR system(Quiros, Roos, and Kaina
2010).Therefore, in the absence of MGMT activity due to methylation, cell sensitivity to O6-meG-methylating
agents is largely dependent on MMR efficiency(Cabrini et al. 2015). Recognition of mismatch is the first step
determining this efficiency(McFaline-Figueroa et al. 2015) and requires proper functioning of hMSH2 mRNA.
Given the crucial functional interactions, regulated levels of MGMT and MMR seem important for processing
methylation directed DNA damages to maintain genomic stability (Fig 1).Therefore, exploring the correlation
between MGMT and hMSH2 would help in better understanding of HGG primarily due to the critical role of these
two genes in gliomagenesis as well as for treatment response. In this context, the association between these genes
and their impact on progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in HGG were analyzed in this study.

The resected frontal lobe primary HGG tumors were obtained from 54 adult (age 18-55 years) patients who
underwent surgery at the Department of Neurosurgery, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences
(NIMHANS), Bangalore, India from December 2011-January 2014. Peripheral blood was also collected from the
patients prior to surgery. Normal non-tumor cortical brain tissues (n=8) were collected from other patients who
underwent surgery for non-glioma condition (frontal- lobe epilepsy). Prior informed consent was obtained from all
the subjects as per the guidelines and approval of the Institute ethical committee. The resected tumor tissues were
bisected, one portion was placed in RNAlater (Sigma Aldrich, Missouri, USA) and standard storage protocol was
followed, till the isolation of nucleic acids. Remaining tissue was fixed in 10 % buffered neutral formalin, processed
for paraffin section, and was used for histopathological grading, which was carried out at Department of
Neuropathology, NIMHANS, Bangalore. Data on various demographic details such as age, sex, histological
classification and post-surgery adjuvant treatment status were collected from medical records section. Pre and postoperative scans (MRI/CT) were analyzed at Department of Neuro-imaging and Radiology, NIMHANS, Bangalore to
check for extent of resection. Patient follow-up evaluation was monitored for up to 24-months from date of surgery
to check PFS and OS of the patients.
2.2.Isolation of Nucleic acids:
Histologically characterized tissues which contained >95 % tumor cells were used for the analysis. DNA isolation
from tissues and blood were carried out using Nucleospin® Tissue and Nucleospin® Blood L (Macherey Nagel
GmbH & Co. KG, Germany), respectively.RNA isolation from both tumor and control brain tissues were carried out
using Pure LinkTM RNA Mini kit (Ambion, California, USA). DNA and RNA were quantified using Nanodrop ND
2000c (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, USA). DNA and RNA samples having purity of 1.8–1.99 (A260/280) and
>2.00 (A260/280), respectively were used.
2.3.Bisulphite conversion and real-time methylation specific PCR (Q-MSP):
Bisulphite conversion of DNA (500ng- 1µg) was carried out using MethylCodeTMBisulphite Conversion kit
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Real time Methylation specific PCR (Q-MSP) was carried out using the eluted
bisulphite modified DNA as template in 1:3 fold dilutions (1-2µL). Comparative Ct method was used and the PCR
conditions were: 10 minutes at 95°C, then 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds, 55°C for 15 seconds, and 60°C for 45

seconds in 10µL reaction volume set using 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix II without UNG (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Methylation and unmethylation-specific primers and probes along with an
endogenous control of COL2A (Rivera et al. 2009), were used. Singleplex experiment was performed in triplicates in
a MicroAmp optical 96-well reaction plate (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Each plate included nontemplate control (water), an unmethylated control (bisulfite treated normal leukocyte DNA), and a methylated
control (bisulfite treated DNA from methylated glioma cell line U251-MG) along with the samples. The cell line
was cultured in the central laboratory and tested in prior for its methylation status. To validate the Comparative Ct
method, a relative standard curve experiment using a serial dilution of DNA from methylated glioma cell line U251,
was used as the calibrator to check the amplification efficiency of both the target and housekeeping genes
(Efficiency between 90-110% was considered optimal). Samples with a Ct-value above 35 were censored (resulting
in a quantity of 0). The percentage of methylated reference (PMR) was calculated for each sample from the median
quantity value from the triplicates by dividing the MGMT/COL2A quantity ratio in the target by the MGMT/COL2A
quantity ratio in the methylated control (Rivera et al. 2009). Threshold value for scoring methylation positive
samples was defined based on the qMSP result of the internal control bisulfite treated normal leukocyte DNA, all of
which had PMR values of zero. Samples with a PMR value above zero were scored as methylation positive. The
samples which had amplification in both methylated and unmethylated targets where considered as methylated
based on the PMR value (≥1). The percentage of methylation (PoM) was calculated using (RQ=2¯ ΔΔCt) *100, where

ΔΔCt =ΔCt MGMT-ΔCt Cal-U251.
2.4.Reverse transcription and Q-PCR:
Total RNA (500ng) extracted from tissue samples (~30mg) was reverse transcribed using 2X- with Oligo (dT)
SuPrimeScript RT Premix (GENETBIO Inc., Daejeon, Korea). The optimized conditions in a final volume of 20μl
were 5mins at 65°C, 60mins at 50°C followed by heating at 70°C for 10mins in an Eppendorf Personal Mastercycler
(Hamburg, Germany) and the product was stored at -20°C.
Real-time PCR was carried out for hMSH2 gene using cDNA template in 1:20 fold dilution. All quantitative PCR
reactions were carried out in three replicates of each sample using a reaction volume of 10μl reaction containing
0.5μl of 20 x Assays-on-DemandTM Gene Expression Assay Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA;
Assay ID- Hs00954125-m1; FAM™ dye labeled MGB probe). 2x TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix II, no

AmpErase/UNG (Applied Biosystems) were used and reactions were carried out in Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast
Real-Time PCR System (Foster City, CA, USA). 18S rRNA (Assay ID- Hs99999901_s1; FAM™ dye labeled
MGB probe) was used as endogenous controls and each plate included ‘No template controls’ in triplicates for both
the hMSH2 and 18srRNA. The thermal cycler was programmed for an initial denaturation step of 10min at 95°C
followed by 45 thermal cycles of 15 sec at 95°C, 60 sec at 60°C. Fluorescent data were converted into cycle
threshold (Ct) measurements, and we calculated gene expression values by comparative threshold cycle (ΔΔCT)
method, which uses the formula 2-ΔΔCt to calculate the expression of target genes normalized to a calibrator. Ct data
for hMSH2and 18srRNAin each sample were used to create ΔCT values [ΔCT Sample =CThMSH2−CT18srRNA].Thereafter,

ΔΔCt values were calculated by [ΔCT Sample –ΔCT Calibrator], the ΔCT values of combined normal brain tissues were
designated as calibrators. Relative quantity (RQ) of primary HGG compared with the non-glioma brain tissues was
calculated with the equation: RQ= 2–ΔΔCt. A relative standard curve experiment was performed to check the
efficiency (90-110% was considered optimal) of the target and the housekeeping gene (Perez-Cabornero et al. 2009).
2.5.Statistical evaluation:
Statistical analysis was carried out using IBM SPSS 20.0 software for Windows. Normality of distribution of data
was checked using Shapiro-Wilk test. Non-parametric tests were used for those that were found to be not normally
distributed. Optimal cut-off value for classifying MGMT PoM as high or low was estimated by using the Receiver
Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve analysis (Villani et al. 2015).Comparisons between percentage of MGMT
methylation and mRNA expression levels among the different grades and types were performed using the KruskalWallis test. Kaplan Meier survival curves were used to check PFS and OS, univariate comparisons were made using
log-rank test. Multivariate analysis to check independent prognostic value of variables was carried out using Cox
proportional hazard mode. Probable correlation between MGMT promoter methylation and mRNA expression of
hMSH2 was analyzed using Spearman correlation test.
3.Results:
3.1.Cohort characteristics and clinical features:
Study group consisted of fifty four adult patients (Mean age: 39.2±9.9) with histologically confirmed frontal/frontoinsular HGG [Grade III:Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma (AOD), Anaplastic mixed Oligoastrocytoma (AOA),

3.2.Q-MSP:
Q-MSP analysis based on PMR valuation revealed positive MGMT promoter methylation in 62% (35/54) of the
samples. Positive methylation statuses among the different variables are given in Table1, with an overall median
PoM of 10.16% (ranging from 0.9-64). The mean MGMT PoM for the methylated sampleswas17.62±17.20% and
this was used for further analysis (Fig 2). Statistically significant differences were observed in PoM for grade III
(p=0.05) and oligodendroglioma (p=0.015) (Table.2).

3.4. Expression of hMSH2mRNA:
Expression of hMSH2mRNAin HGG relative to non-glioma brain tissue revealed over-expression (median was
considered as cut-off)in 50% of subjects (Fig 3a),with median fold change of 2.74 (p=0.021).Overall mean hMSH2
mRNA expression level observed was 13.06±24.07.There were differences in the levels
ofhMSH2expressionbetween the grades and types, but not statistically significant; Grade IV and astrocytoma were
seen to have higher expression (Table 2).
3.5.Correlation between MGMT and hMSH2:
Association between the statuses’ of MGMT methylation and hMSH2 expression using chi-square analysis was
checked and no significant association[χ2=0.081; (p=0.776)] was observed. Further, Spearman’s correlation analysis
between MGMT PoM and hMSH2 mRNA expression (Fig 3b) also showed a negative correlation [ρ=0.183;p=0.294] which was statistically not significant.
3.6.Survival analysis:
Univariate analysis using Kaplan-Meier survival and log-rank tests showed that MGMT methylation, age ≤39, grade
III, oligodendroglioma and gross total resection (GTR)were good survival indicators for both PFS and OS (Table 4).
PFS and OS was checked separately for both the grades.

In the 24months of follow-up 72.2% patients had HGG progression. MGMT PoM greater than 10% showed good
PFS (p=0.015). Mean PFS for samples with ≥10%MGMT methylation was 18.15±1.88 months and for <10%
MGMT methylation it was 12.30±1.38 months (Fig 4a). MGMT methylation status had a significant impact on PFS
(p=0.001) in grade III, but not in grade IV tumors (p=0.527). Univariate hMSH2gene expression did not show any
statistically significant association with PFS or OS. However, univariate analysis combining the two
variableshMSH2 expression status along with adjuvant therapy showed significant impact on PFS in grade III
tumors(p=0.002). Patients who underwent therapy (CT+RT) showed a difference in the median PFS, which was 17
months for patients with high hMSH2and24 months for those with low hMSH2 expression (Figure 5 a & b).
Interestingly, patients who did not undergo therapy had almost similar median of 11 and 12 months for high and low
expression respectively. Grade IV tumors also demonstrated a similar trend as grade III, but was not statistically
significant (p=0.099) (Table 5).

3.6.2. OS:
In the 24 months of follow-up 42.6% patients did not survive. MGMT PoM greater than 8% showed good OS
(p=0.043). Mean OS for ≥8%MGMT methylated samples was 20.55±1.50 months and for <8% MGMT methylated
samples was 16.98±1.49 months (Fig 4b). MGMT methylation status did not seem to affect OS in grade IV tumors
(p=0.952), but had a significant impact in grade III tumors (p=0.040). Similar to PFS, a significant impact of
hMSH2expression combined with adjuvant therapy was seen on OS (Fig 5 c & d) in grade III (p=0.007) and a trend
towards significance was observed in grade IV (p=0.098).
Multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazard revealed age ≤39, grade III, GTR, adjuvant therapy and MGMT
methylation were good independent prognostic indicators for PFS. The same variables with the exception of MGMT
methylation were found to be significant for OS as well (Table 6).

4.Discussion:
Differences in the ability to repair DNA damage contributes to the cancer risk as well as treatment response
(Demokan 2006). Methylation of MGMT at 0-6-position remains unrepaired as there are no other known repair
enzymes which carry out the function(Liu et al. 2009); leading to accumulation of single base pair
mismatches(Pukkila et al. 1983).This DNA damage response pathway is of importance due to its rolein

gliomagenesis and also for determining efficacy of therapy using alkylating agents(Rodríguez-hernández et al.
2013).Processing of O6-meG is dependent on methylation status of MGMT promoter region (Warren, Forsberg, and
Beese 2006) and on MMR proteins(Zhang et al. 2010).Given the exploratory nature of our investigation and this
being the first study to check the relationship between MGMT promoter methylation and gene expression of its
functional downstream gene hMSH2 in HGG, we did not have a specific directional hypothesis.
MGMT methylation is known to be a good prognostic and predictive indicator which is supported by reports(Manuel
et al. 2016; Sciuscio et al. 2011). However, information about the extent of MGMT methylation is required for better
understanding of its role in influencing expression of other genes involved in functional downstream
pathways(Iliadis et al. 2012). qMSP was used in this study to determine PoM due to the specificity of the method
and also helps in analyzing more number of CpG sites(Parrella et al. 2009).PoM was found to be significantly higher
in grade III when compared with grade IV tumors, suggesting that the extent of MGMT methylation is dependent on
grade and could be another factor for progression of severity in glioma. De-methylation of MGMT leading to
decrease in PoM may be a factor responsible for progression of tumor grade, along with many other molecular
events. A similar mechanism may apply to the type of glial cell as well. we observed oligodendroglioma to have
significantly higher methylation and better prognosis when compared with astrocytoma, which is in accordance with
literature wherein oligodendroglioma is seen to have higher methylation and better prognosis (Mo et al. 2005).This
could probably indicate that higher MGMT methylation may be one of the factors responsible for providing
oligodendroglioma the prognostic advantage. PoM of ≥10% MGMT methylation was seen to be a significant
prognostic indicator for PFS and ≥8% for OS, this observation is consistent with earlier reports (Håvik et al. 2012;
Villani et al. 2015). We also observed the independent efficacy of MGMT methylation in predicting PFS through
multivariate analysis, as reported in other studies (Qiu et al. 2014; Rivera et al. 2009).
MGMT methylation leads to accumulation of mismatch errors(Qiu et al. 2014), that has to be corrected by the MMR
system. If there are MMR aberrations especially in the mismatch recognition dimer MutSα,it would lead to
accumulation of mutations, thereby increasing replication errors and genomic instability (Modrich and Lahue
1996).hMSH2is critical among the three MutSαproteins for the efficient functioning of mismatch recognition
(McFaline-Figueroa et al. 2015).José L. McFaline-Figueroa et al. 2015, demonstrated that a minor change in
hMSH2 protein expression has major impact on response of glioblastoma to TMZ(McFaline-Figueroa et al. 2015).

However, studies on hMSH2 mRNA expression are sparse, and there is no data available on the levels of mRNA
expression in primary HGG in the literature. It is important to understand the expression of hMSH2 owing to its’
evolutionary significance and ubiquitous function in post DNA replication and repair. Differential DNA MMR
expression indicates mutation rate variations(Supek and Lehner 2015),andhMSH2is a critical gene for efficient
MMR. However, our results interestingly demonstrate an equal distribution of over and lowhMSH2mRNA
expression, suggesting the underlying aberrant expression status in HGG, in accordance with a report on hMSH2
protein levels being aberrant (Alkam et al. 2013).Differences in expression levels between the grades and cell types
correlating with severity were also observed (Table 3). Grade II and III glioma is known to have decreased hMSH2
expression when compared with grade IV (Zheng et al. 2006). Similarly, in our study higher hMSH2expression was
seen in grade IV and as astrocytoma, which probably indicates the increased underlying mutations, a characteristic
in these sub-types of HGG.
Based on the functions of these genes, a positive correlation between MGMT methylation and hMSH2 expression is
essential for efficient repair of O6-meGs and for maintaining genomic stability. Higher MGMT methylation would
lead to MGMT gene silencing and accumulation of O6-meG(Park et al. 2012),this could induce an increase
inhMSH2 expression for carrying out repair caused due to deficiency of MGMT enzyme(Frosina 2009). On the other
hand, in HGG we found a negative correlation between extent of MGMT methylation and levels of hMSH2mRNA
expression i.e., higher the methylation of MGMT, lower the expression of hMSH2.This probably indicates the lack
of regulation between these two genes in HGG tissues and implicates a dysfunctional repair of O6-meG.There are no
reports in the past indicating this kind of association between genes of two repair mechanisms; however, some
studies have examined the correlation of methylation status with mRNA and protein expression within a single
repair mechanism. MGMT and hMSH2 methylation is seen to have positive direct correlation with its own mRNA
and protein expressions, respectively (Alkam et al. 2013; Uno et al. 2011). Conversely, this impaired correlation
between MGMT and hMSH2could be one of the early events which may be responsible for increasing the mutations
across the HGG genome. Since, studies have shown that defects in the mismatch repair system result in accelerated
accumulation of mutations in critical genes and lead to, progression to malignancy (Demokan 2006).However, it is
difficult to ascertain the speculated aberrant correlation due to the complexity of biological relationship between
promoter methylation and its impact on gene regulation (Sciuscio et al. 2011), especially in a primary HGG tissue.

HGG is known to have resistance to CT and RT, especially therapy with alkylating agents(Weller et al.
2009).MGMT and MMR are major determinants of the tumor response to TMZ with concomitant RT (Zhang et al.
2010). Knowledge of MGMT levels and MMR status in cancer cells might be useful predictors of their chemotherapeutic response (Casorelli, Russo, and Bignami 2008). This is demonstrated in our study, wherein MGMT
methylation and hMSH2 low expression along with CT+RT was seen to have a better prognosis. There were patients
in our cohort who did not receive any form of adjuvant therapy and therefore difference in survival time between
them and patients who underwent CT+RT were considered for analysis. The observed statistically significant
prognostic impact enabled us to determine the affectivity of CT+ RT, in terms of extending the survival for few
months. Over-expression of hMSH2mRNA was seen to have poor PFS when CT+RT are administered. This could
be due to hMSH2 interfering with the TMZ sensitivity, wherein the DNA damage caused by TMZ may be repaired
by an increasedhMSH2expression.
5. Conclusion:
DNA damages are known to occur ubiquitously, the DNA repair mechanisms individually or in combination target
and repair the damages. This coordinated function is highly essential in determining the genomic stability and
thereby in mediating normal cellular physiology. Failure DNA repair systems are known to be associated with all
cancers, but it’s not well explored in glioma. Studies so far have explored mutations and protein expression of
individual DNA repair mechanisms. However, a better approach would be to analyze the influence of
mutations/errors in one DNA repair mechanism on another, as their interdependence or lack of it could underlie
complex conditions like glioma. Future studies taking this aspect into consideration are necessary, evidenced by our
study which provides preliminary indications of the importance of analyzing correlation between two DNA repair
mechanisms with a similar biological function. The observations also emphasises the importance of analysing
hMSH2 along with MGMT methylation status and warrants further research.
