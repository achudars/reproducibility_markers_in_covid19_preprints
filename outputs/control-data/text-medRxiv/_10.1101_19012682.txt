Abstract

Introduction

In China, standard smoking cessation practices are rarely used by healthcare service providers

(HSPs). WeChat, a popular social media app, has been widely used in China.

Methods

In this single-blind, randomized trial, undertaken in China with 8-week interventions and follow-

up to 52 weeks, about 2,200 providers from different health care settings will be randomly

selected to the intervention or control group. This trial will be conducted in China between June

2018 to October 2019. The intervention group will receive regular smoking cessation training

program messages by the professional team to 8 weeks and follow to 52 weeks. A hard copy of

the

manual

will

be

sent

to

each

provider

from

the

intervention

group

by

mail

after

randomization. The Control group will only communicate by themselves and receive thanks

messages for 8 weeks, and follow-up to 52 weeks. The trial will be carried out in two phases.

The first phase is the pilot study (n=200, 8-week intervention and follow-up to 16 weeks) and

the second is the main study (n=2000, 8-week intervention and follow-up to 52 weeks). The

primary outcome measure will be the utilization rate of behavioural and pharmacotherapy

interventions

for

smoking

patients

from

8

to

52

weeks.

pharmacotherapy interventions for cigarette smoking cessation in health care settings by the

'WeChat WeQuit' program.

Implications

This protocol may show that 'WeChat WeQuit' training program will be effective in increasing

the provision of effective tobacco cessation interventions by Chinese-speaking HSPs, especially

therapists, to patients with cigarette smoking, which will provide valuable insights into bridging

the gap between need and services for smoking cessation in China. Overall, we believe this

program will be likely to have very substantial public health benefits if it would provide a widely

accessible and efficacious smoking cessation information for Chinese HSPs.

Introduction

With over 300 million smokers, cigarette smoking remains a major public health concern in

1

China . In 2015, there were 933.1 million daily smokers in the world, and 6.4 million deaths

(11.5% of global deaths) were attributable to cigarette smoking worldwide. Over three quarters

of deaths

the

attributable to smoking were in men, and 52.2% took place in four countries (China,

and

Russia)

Smoking

remains the single most effective prevention for lung cancer and other smoking related health

5,6

.

In China, male physician smoking prevalence is high with few former smokers, and standard

7-9

smoking cessation practices are rarely provided by HSPs

. Evidence showed that smoking HSPs

were less likely to ask about smoking status and advise smoking patients to quit, and physicians

with higher perceived quality of their training in smoking cessation methods led to greater

10

utilization of evidence-based cessation interventions

. Thus, health-care professionals should

take more responsibility for providing smoking cessation services that are readily available,

effective and cheap. Taking the National Health Service (NHS) Stop-Smoking Service

users during the past several years, most of the health care settings have built WeChat public

. There is evidence to show that WeChat-

based medical services can improve the quality of care and treatment efficacy. Take smoking

cessation services, for example.

Objectives of the main study:

1.

The primary outcome will be the utilization rate (i.e. rate=smokers treated divided by

smokers seen) of behavioural and pharmacotherapy interventions by HSPs for smoking

patients from 8 to 52 weeks. The number of smokers seen by each HSP, as well as the

number of smokers given treatment by each HSP will be measured. The utilization rate

will be recorded by each HSP.

from 58.1% in the control group to 80.7% in the intervention group, for assessing the utilization of

advising on stop-smoking medications, 348 HSPs are required to have a 80% chance of detecting as

significant, at the 5% level, an increase in the primary outcome measure from 85.9% in the control

group to 94.7% in the intervention group. For assessing 4-week biologically verified quit rates,

increase in the primary outcome measure from 50.4% in the control group to 63.6% in the

the most conservative outcome of the study self-reported prevalence abstinence. However,

considering

relatively large drop-offs

, a total sample size of 2200 participants in this study

(1100 in each arm) will have more than a 95% chance of detecting a significant difference.

Discussion

Since its first release in 2011, WeChat, as a free instant messaging application for smartphones

that enables the exchange of text, voice, pictures, videos, and location information between

individuals and groups via mobile phone indexes, has become the most popular social media

app in China. In addition to its service in communication, library, financial and other fields, it

has been widely used to promote human health. Thus, by this 'WeChat WeQuit' educational

cost-effective way of increasing the number of people saved by the SSS

, this ‘WeChat WeQuit’

program is very likely to provide a cost-effective way to reach large numbers and achieve a

substantial impact.

However,

some

participants may not be serious enough in reading messages as a few WeChat users complain

about bombardment by excessive information. WeChat users today are constantly bombarded

by messages and can easily ignore them. In order to increase the utilization of the program, a

hard copy of behavioural and pharmacotherapy interventions manual will be sent to each HSP

by mail after randomization.

Ethical issues

The protocol was approved by the university ethics committee (The Second Xiangya Hospital of

Central South University Review Board, 2018, No. S071) and the studies will be carried out in

accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. At the time of the initial screening interview, the

study participants will be required to read the informed consent (confirmation of electronic

version of written informed consent will be performed) and may ask any questions they may

have about it. At the same time, a researcher will read the consent statement to every HSP

during the recruitment process. Each participant will receive an explanation about the aims,

importance,

procedures,

measurements,

potential

risks

and

benefits

of

the

study

before

recruitment. At the time of the initial screening interview and again during the orientation

session preceding the study, participants will be required to know about the consent form and

may ask any questions they may have about it. Participation will be completely voluntary. If you

want to stop this service, you can drop out at any time. Only the investigators can identify the

personal information of participants and have access to the final trial dataset. In this single-

blind, randomized trial, you will have a 50 % chance to be selected to either a control group or

to a group that receives the ‘WeChat WeQuit’ program. If you are in the control group, you are

welcome to join in the ‘WeChat WeQuit’ program after the study. Participants will be given

contact details

of

the study coordinator for their future questions

and concerns. Thus, all

participants will be able to contact the study team for extra advice or suggestions.

Appendix 2

The 5 R’S of motivation

Relevance - 1 minute

Ask patient about how quitting may be personally relevant. Encourage the patient to indicate

why quitting is personally relevant, being as specific as possible. Motivational information has

the greatest impact if it is relevant to a patient’s disease status or risk, family or social situation

(e.g., having children in the home), health concerns, age, gender, and other important patient

characteristics

(e.g.,

prior

quitting

experience,

personal

barriers

to

cessation).

Examples

of

relevance include:

•

Longer and better quality of life

•

Extra money

•

People you live with will be healthier

•

Decrease chance of heart attack, stroke or cancer

•

If pregnant, improves chance of healthy baby

Risks - 1 minute

Ask the patient about their perception of short-term, long-term and environmental risks of

continued use. The HSPs may suggest and highlight those that seem most relevant to the

patient. The HSPs should emphasize that smoking low-tar/low-nicotine cigarettes or use of

other

forms

of

tobacco

(e.g.,

E-cigarettes,

eliminate these risks. Examples of risks are:

smokeless

tobacco,

cigars,

and

pipes)

•

Acute

risks:

shortness

of

breath,

exacerbation

of

asthma,

increased

risk

of

respiratory

infections, harm to pregnancy, impotence, infertility.

•

Long-term risks: heart attacks and strokes, lung and other cancers (e.g., larynx, oral cavity,

pharynx,

esophagus,

pancreas,

stomach,

kidney,

bladder,

cervix

and

acute

myelocytic

leukemia), chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (chronic bronchitis and emphysema),

osteoporosis, long-term disability and need for extended care.

•

Environmental risks: increased risk of lung cancer and heart disease in spouses; increased

risk for low birth weight, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), asthma, middle ear disease,

and respiratory infections in children of smokers.

Rewards - 1 minute

Ask the patient about perceived benefits/rewards for quitting tobacco use. The HSPs may

suggest and highlight those that seem most relevant to the patient. Examples of rewards follow:

•

Health (self & others)

•

Food taste

•

Sense of smell

•

Feel better

•

Example to others

•

Additional years of life

•

Saving money

•

Performing better in physical activities

•

Improved appearance including reduced wrinkling/aging of skin and whiter teeth

Roadblocks - 3 minutes +

The HSPs should ask the patient to identify barriers or impediments to quitting and provide

treatment

(problem-solving

counseling,

medication)

that

could

address

barriers.

Typical

barriers might include:

•

Withdrawal symptoms

•

Fear of failure

•

Sleep problems

•

Weight gain

•

Lack of support

•

Depression and anxiety

•

Enjoyment of tobacco

•

Limited knowledge of effective treatment options

Repetition - 1 minute +

Respectfully repeat the 5 R’s each visit, providing motivation and information. Tobacco users

who have failed in previous quit attempts should be told that most people make repeated quit

attempts before they are successful.
