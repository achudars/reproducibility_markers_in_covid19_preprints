Abstract

2

Escherichia coli sequence type 131 H30 has garnered global attention as a dominant

3

antimicrobial-resistant lineage of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli, but its transmission

4

dynamics remain undefined. We applied whole genome sequencing to identify putative

5

transmission clusters among clinical isolates of H30 from children across the U.S. Of 126

6

isolates, 17 were involved in 8 putative transmission clusters; 4 clusters involved isolates with

7

some evidence of healthcare-associated epidemiologic linkages. Geographic clustering analyses

8

showed weak geographic clustering. These findings are consistent with a framework where

9

within-hospital transmission is not a main contributor to the propagation of H30 in a pediatric

10

setting.

Background

14

Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) cause a wide range of non-intestinal

15

illnesses, ranging from uncomplicated urinary tract infection to potentially fatal bacteremia [1].

16

Unlike intestinal pathogenic E. coli, which is commonly associated with outbreaks, ExPEC

17

infections are historically considered sporadic, and tracking ExPEC transmission has not been a

18

clinical or public health priority. However, the widespread dissemination of antimicrobial-

19

resistant lineages such as sequence type (ST) 131-H30 (also known as ST131 Clade C), a

20

dominant multidrug-resistant (MDR) ExPEC lineage in both adults and children, has brought

21

new interest to understanding the transmission dynamics of these common pathogens [2,3]. In

22

particular, the relative importance of healthcare vs. community transmission to the

23

propagation of MDR ExPEC lineages remains poorly defined, though recent work indicates

24

community exposures may be more important in pediatric patients.[4]

25
26

The transmission dynamics of ST131-H30 (hereafter, H30) are challenging to study. Like other

27

ExPEC lineages, H30 is known to asymptomatically colonize the gut for extended periods of

28

time prior to—or potentially without ever—transitioning to extraintestinal infection [5]. These

29

instances of long-term intestinal colonization likely result in numerous “silent” transmission

30

events [6]. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) and phylogenetic methods can shed light on

31

pathogen transmission dynamics even in the presence of silent transmission events. Here, we

32

used WGS to identify putative transmission clusters among passively collected clinical H30

33

isolates from four children’s hospitals across the U.S. We also quantified genomic evidence of

34

geographic clustering to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of H30 among children.

Methods

36

Strain collection and whole genome sequencing

37

All isolates and clinical data came from a previously described multicenter case-control study.

38

Briefly, between September 1, 2009 and September 30, 2013, four freestanding children’s

39

hospitals—referred to here as “West,” “Midwest 1,” “Midwest 2,” and “East”— collected E. coli

40

isolates during the course of standard clinical care from individuals <22 years old. All extended-

41

spectrum cephalosporin-resistant and a subset of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-sensitive

42

isolates were collected [7]. The Institutional Review Board at each hospital approved the study

43

protocol. H30 isolates were identified using the fumC/fimH genotyping scheme [8]; only the

44

first H30 isolate per individual was included.

45
46

All H30 isolates underwent WGS on the Illumina NextSeq platform. Sequencing reads were

47

quality filtered, trimmed, mapped to a high-quality H30 reference genome (EC958), and single

48

nucleotide variants (SNVs) were called and filtered.[9] Filtered SNVs were used to construct a

49

pairwise SNV distance matrix using snp-dists, and a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree,

50

using IQ-tree [10,11]. See Supplementary Methods for more details. Sequence data generated

51

are available from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under BioProject PRJNA578285 (see

52

Supplementary Table 2 for study sample metadata).

53
54

Identification and characterization of putative clusters

55

Pairwise SNV distances within and between all combinations of collection sites were visualized,

56

and the minimum SNV distance between two isolates from discordant collection sites was used

57

to define a threshold for identification of putative transmission clusters. This approach was

58

selected in an effort to capture direct and indirect transmission events that are

59

epidemiologically relevant, i.e. would warrant further investigation should the clusters have

60

been identified in real-time. Given the substantial geographic distance between the collection

61

sites in this study, we expect no epidemiologically relevant transmission events that span two

62

distinct collection sites. The transcluster package in R (version 3.5.1 ,R Core Team, 2018) was

63

used to estimate counts of uncaptured transmission events separating isolates in each putative

64

cluster while incorporating the sampling dates and estimated evolutionary rate and

65

transmission rate of H30 [12]. See Supplementary Methods for more details.

66
67

Genomic evaluation of geographic clustering

68

To examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of H30, we quantified genomic evidence of

69

geographic clustering using two approaches. The primary approach was a previously described

70

SNV-distance based approach where a ratio of the median SNV distance within collection sites

71

over the median SNV distance between collection sites (SNVwithin / SNVbetween) is calculated, with

72

a ratio closer to zero indicating more evidence of clustering by collection site [13]. Statistical

73

significance of the pairwise-SNV distance-based clustering was assessed using permutation-

74

based 95% interval estimates with 1000 permutations; a SNV distance ratio below the lower

75

bound of the 95% interval estimate indicated evidence of geographic clustering. Secondarily,

76

we applied a previously described phylogenetically informed approach [14]. Briefly, the number

77

of isolates in well-supported phylogenetic clades of size 2 or greater that were homogeneous

78

for collection site (“pure” clusters) was tallied. Statistical significance of these counts was again

79

assessed using permutation-based 95% interval estimates with 1000 permutations; counts

80

higher than the upper bound of the permuted 95% interval estimate were considered evidence

81

of clustering. Both approaches were first executed on the full sample set and then on four

82

temporally segregated sample sets in approximate one-year increments to explore whether

83

geographic signal interacted with the temporal variability of sampling.

84
85

Clustering by “geographically close” sites compared to “geographically distant” sites was also

86

examined. In SNV-distance based analyses, pairs of isolates that spanned Midwest 1 and

87

Midwest 2 were classified as geographically close, while all other discordant site pairs were

88

classified as geographically distant. In phylogenetically informed analyses, the two sites in the

89

Midwest region of the U.S. were collapsed into one “Midwest” category. The same methods

90

described above were applied to the full data set and to the temporally segregated sample sets.

91
92

Results

93

One hundred thirty H30 isolates were identified out of 1,347 E. coli screened over the four-year

94

study period. Three of the 130 H30 isolates were determined to be non-H30 after in silico

95

analysis and one isolate was identified as a subsequent isolate from an individual already in the

96

study, leaving 126 H30 isolates in the remainder of the analyses. After quality filtering and

97

recombination masking, 3,433 variable sites were identified and included in the whole-genome-

98

based SNV alignment.

100

There were 7,875 different pairwise comparisons made, with the pairwise SNV distance ranging

101

from 0 to 165 SNVs. The minimum SNV distance between isolates from discordant collection

102

sites was 14 SNVs, and pairs of isolates separated by less than or equal to 14 SNVs were

103

considered to be members of a putative transmission cluster (Figure 1A). Using this threshold,

104

eight putative clusters were identified involving seventeen isolates, seven clusters containing

105

two isolates and one cluster containing three isolates (Figure 2A, Supplementary Figure 1). The

106

putative cluster with three isolates (Cluster 1) consisted of one pair separated by 15 SNVs,

107

which was just beyond the selected cutoff, but because the other two pairs within the cluster

108

were separated by <14 SNVs, all three isolates were included in further analyses. Clusters

109

contained a mix of community- and healthcare-associated isolates (Supplementary Figure 2).

110
111

Out of the eight identified putative clusters, documented epidemiologic data associated with

112

four clusters (Clusters 2,6,7,8) was consistent with possible nosocomial acquisition. Clusters 2

113

and 6 involved individuals with documented overlapping dates of hospitalization (Figure 2B).

114

The genomic evidence for direct transmission within these clusters is less clear: they were

115

separated by 12 and 10 SNVs, respectively, and the transcluster method estimated that there

116

were between 8 and 19 transmission events separating the isolates in these clusters (Figure

117

2A). Additionally, only one of the two isolates in Cluster 2 was phenotypically resistant to

118

trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Supplementary Figure 2). However, the within-cluster

119

difference in isolation dates was 179 and 199 days, so long-term colonization and within-host

120

evolution may have inflated the estimated number of transmission events and resulted in a loss

121

of a resistance determinant. Clusters 7 and 8 consisted of isolates that differed by 0-1 SNVs

122

after quality filtering and were collected between 1 and 7 days of one another, with the

123

transcluster method estimating direct transmission (Figure 2A). While there was no

124

documentation of overlapping hospitalizations within Cluster 7 or 8, both individuals within

125

Cluster 7 had surgical site infections associated with neurological procedures, while both

126

individuals within Cluster 8 were paraplegic. These connections are consistent with a plausible

127

epidemiological link in inpatient or outpatient care, although conclusively establishing such a

128

link is outside the scope of these data.

129
130

Genomic clustering analyses demonstrated minimal evidence of geographic clustering by

131

collection site. Visual inspection of geographic sites on the phylogenetic tree did not show

132

remarkable evidence of geographic clusters (Supplementary Figure 1). The median SNV

133

distance within pairs across concordant sites was not significantly different from the median

134

SNV distance within pairs across discordant sites. (SNVwithin / SNVbetween = 1.01, 95% interval

135

estimate 0.99-1.01 Figure 1A). Similarly, the median SNV distance within pairs across the most

136

geographically proximate discordant sites (Midwest 1 and Midwest 2) was not significantly

137

lower than the median SNV distance within pairs across more geographically distant site pairs

138

(SNVwithin / SNVbetween = 1.03, 95% interval estimate 0.99-1.02, Figure 1B). The phylogenetic-

139

informed approach demonstrated weak clustering in the data by study site and no clustering by

140

Midwest sites vs. other sites (Supplementary Figure 3). Results for temporally segregated

141

sample sets were similar, with most measures not supporting evidence of clustering

142

(Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figures 4 and 5).

Discussion

145

We applied WGS to clinical isolates collected from four freestanding U.S. children’s hospitals

146

over four years to identify putative transmission clusters and investigate the spatiotemporal

147

dynamics of E. coli ST131-H30. We identified eight putative transmission clusters of H30

148

involving seventeen isolates, including two clusters with documented overlapping

149

hospitalizations and two clusters with other plausible healthcare-associated epidemiologic

150

links. Genomic spatiotemporal analyses demonstrated little evidence of geographic clustering

151

of H30 more broadly.

152
153

To our knowledge, there are no available data about transmission of H30 between children

154

within healthcare settings. Our observation of limited plausible within-hospital transmission is

155

not surprising, given the infrequent documentation of MDR-ExPEC transmission within

156

healthcare, generally [15]. These findings are consistent with a framework where within-

157

hospital transmission is not a dominant contributor to the propagation of H30 in a pediatric

158

setting. However, the identification of some plausible nosocomial transmission highlights the

159

utility of WGS of isolates collected during the course of standard clinical care to uncover silent

160

transmission events.

161
162

There are also no data, to our knowledge, describing the spatiotemporal dynamics of H30

163

within the U.S. using geographically diverse isolates. Our observation of limited geographic

164

clustering was unexpected; we anticipated a stronger genomic signature associated with

165

sustained local circulation at the various geographic sites. These findings may reflect the rapid

166

and recent dissemination of H30 at the time of this data collection. Whether these patterns

167

remain the same today, almost two decades after H30 is believed to have disseminated rapidly

168

and globally, is worthy of further study [2].

169
170

The results of this study should be interpreted in the context of multiple limitations. First, the

171

available epidemiologic data were limited — including a lack of detail about the location of

172

specific wards during overlapping hospitalizations — and, as such, all observations of plausible

173

transmission should be interpreted cautiously. Second, as highlighted elsewhere [12], the

174

selection of a SNV threshold as a method of defining putative transmission clusters has

175

limitations. However, the multicenter design in this study provided the opportunity to apply a

176

conservative threshold where even indirect transmission was epidemiologically unlikely, which

177

we believe to be a reasonable approach given the limited transmission data available about

178

H30. Finally, the local epidemiology of H30 may have changed since the collection of these

179

isolates. This study also had several strengths, including a multicenter design; a large collection

180

of H30 isolates from an understudied pediatric population; and the use of WGS and

181

phylogenetically informed approaches to investigate both transmission-based and geographic

182

clustering.

183
184

As antimicrobial resistance rates among ExPEC rise, there is new urgency to improve our

185

understanding of the transmission dynamics of these common pathogens. Taken together, our

186

findings of minimal evidence of transmission clusters or broader geographic clustering are

187

consistent with the prevailing conceptualization of H30 as a globally and recently disseminated

on community-based exposures when investigating the transmission dynamics of H30.

Figure 2: A) Phylogeny of eight identified putative transmission clusters of H30 identified from
four children’s hospitals in the U.S. colored by study site, with the number of days separating
their collection; the number of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) separating them after quality
filtering; and a range of estimated number of transmission events separating them as
calculated by the R package transcluster. The range of estimated transmission events reflect a
range of reasonable values for substitution and transmission rates, but do not account for
potential intra-host evolution or diversity. B) Temporal depiction of the overlapping
hospitalizations of individuals in Cluster 2 and Cluster 6. The black diamond indicates the date
of isolate collection and the purple bars represent time hospitalized. Time is measured in days
since the isolation of the first isolate in each cluster.
