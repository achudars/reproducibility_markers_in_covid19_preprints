Abstract

Background: Age is the strongest risk factor for most chronic diseases, and yet individuals

4

may age at different rates biologically. A biological age formed from biomarkers may be a

5

stronger risk factor than chronological age and understanding what factors contribute to it

6

could provide insight into new opportunities for disease prevention.

7

Methods and findings: Among 480,019 UK Biobank participants aged 40-70 recruited in

8

2006-2010 and followed up for 6-12 years via linked death registry and secondary care

9

records, a subpopulation of 141,254 (29.4%) non-smoking adults in good health and with no

10

medication use or disease history at baseline were identified. Independent components of 72

11

biomarkers measured at baseline were characterised by principal component analysis. The

12

Klemera Doubal method (KDM), which derived a weighted sum of biomarker principal

13

components based on the strengths of their linear associations with chronological age, was

14

used to derive sex-specific biological ages in this healthy subpopulation. The proportions of

15

the overall biological and chronological age effects on mortality, coronary heart disease and

16

age-related non-fatal hospital admissions (based on a hospital frailty index) that were

17

explained by biological age were assessed using log-likelihoods of proportional hazards

18

models.

19

Reduced lung function, reduced kidney function, slower reaction time, lower insulin-like-

20

growth factor 1, lower hand grip strength and higher blood pressure were key contributors to

21

biological age (explaining the highest percentages of its variance) in both men and women,

22

while lower albumin, higher sex hormone-binding globulin and lower muscle mass in men,

23

and higher liver enzymes, blood lipids and HbA1c in women were also important. Across

24

both sexes, a 51-principal component biological age explained 66%, 80% and 63% of the age

25

effects on mortality, coronary heart disease and hospital admissions, respectively. Restricting

26

the biological age to the 12-13 key biomarkers corresponding to the 10 most importantly

27

contributing principal components resulted in little change in these proportions for women,

28

but a reduction to 53%, 63% and 50%, respectively, for men.

29

Conclusions: This study identified that markers of impaired function in a range of organs

30

account for a substantial proportion of the apparent effect of age on disease and hospital

31

admissions. It supports a broader, multi-system approach to research and prevention of

32

diseases of ageing.

Introduction

36

Age is the strongest risk factor for most chronic diseases that limit healthy lifespan, yet

37

individuals may age biologically at different rates,1 illustrated by differential rates of disease

38

accumulation and frailty onset. Understanding the contributors to biological ageing could

39

lead to opportunities for early prevention of later life disease2 and limiting the disease burden

40

associated with growing elderly populations.

41

‘Biological age’ is often used to refer to a composite risk score estimated from measurements

42

of biomarkers of ageing,1,3-5 which may be constructed from different types and numbers of

43

biomarkers.5-7 Biological ages constructed from clinical biomarkers widely measured in

44

routine care were found to be more predictive of health outcomes than those constructed

45

using epigenetic ages2,6 and telomere length.6 The most important contributors to biological

46

age have varied between studies, in part due to differences in the set of biomarkers

47

available.8,9

48

The main methods of estimating biological ages using clinical biomarkers are multiple linear

49

regression, principal component analysis (PCA) and the Klemera Doubal method (KDM),

50

which derives a weighted sum of biomarkers based on the strengths of their associations with

51

chronological age10 and is favoured by comparison studies.9,11,12 KDM allows comparison of

52

the predictive value of its biological age with that of chronolological age for health outcomes,

53

when chronological age has not been included as a constituent ‘biomarker’. However, KDM

54

biological ages have typically included chronological age13 and the predictive values of

55

biological ages have only occasionally been compared with those of chronological age13 or

56

mortality-based scores.2,14 Multiple linear regression has been used in many studies5,9,12 and

57

both multiple linear regression and KDM have been extended to principal components of

58

biomarkers instead of individual biomarkers.11

59

The UK Biobank is a richly phenotyped resource with 0.5 million participants15 that provides

60

an unrivalled opportunity to investigate earlier stages of ageing through biological, lifestyle

61

and environmental factors, compared to previous studies of typically 100-10,000 participants

62

with panels of fewer than 30 biomarkers.5 A substantial middle aged, apparently healthy

63

subpopulation of the UK Biobank can be identified, to reduce reverse causality from prior

64

health or medication use affecting biomarker levels.

65

This study aims to: (1) investigate and implement reliable methods of estimating biological

66

age in the UK Biobank, (2) identify the main biomarker determinants of biological age, and

67

(3) investigate the relationship between biological and chronological age in the prediction of

68

health outcomes.

71

The UK Biobank recruited 0.5 million participants across the UK aged 40-70 for baseline

72

assessment in 2006-2010. Information on sociodemographic characteristics, self-reported

73

health behaviours and medication was recorded. Linkage to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)

74

and national death registries provided prior and prospective information on secondary care

75

outcomes and date and cause of death. Over 100 biomarkers and physical attributes were

76

measured using various measurement devices, and blood and urine assays (S1 Appendix 1

77

and 2).15 This study was covered by the general ethical approval for UK Biobank studies

78

from the NHS National Research Ethics Service on 17th June 2011 (Ref 11/NW/0382).

79

After data cleaning (S1 Figure 1), 480,019 participants, followed up for a median of 8.7 years

80

for death registry records and 8.0 years for HES records were included (S1 Appendix 1). A

81

composite measure of prior health, derived from chronic disease-related medication count,

82

walking speed, number of HES episodes prior to recruitment, smoking status, previous age-

83

related chronic disease and hip or wrist fracture was used to stratify the population into 4

84

groups: (1) healthy (generally non-smokers with no prior disease or medications), (2) some

85

medications, (3) slightly unhealthy, and (4) poor health (S1 Appendix 1). This study focused

86

on the 141,254 people in the healthy subpopulation, in order to reduce reverse causality, and

87

contrasted results for this subpopulation with those for the poor health subpopulation and the

88

whole population.

89

Statistical Analyses

90

Among 110 available biomarkers, a panel of 72 biomarkers was obtained after excluding

91

biomarkers that: (1) were missing in >30% participants, (2) were measuring the same

92

biological trait as another biomarker, or (3) had poor reproducibility, assessed through intra-

93

individual correlations of <0.1 in the 19,335 individuals with a repeat measurement (S1

94

Appendix 2 and S1 Table 3). For each sex and prior health subpopulation, trends of each

95

biomarker with chronological age were visually assessed for linearity (S1 Appendix 3A),

96

before using linear methods to estimate biological ages. To represent the biomarkers as

97

linearly uncorrelated principal components, PCA with varimax rotation11 was carried out on

98

the 72 biomarkers, which gave 51 principal components with eigenvalues >0.33. These

99

principal components were characterised based on constituent biomarkers with the largest

100

factor loadings (S1 Appendix 3B–D).

101

Biological ages were estimated using KDM,10 separately within each sex and prior health

102

subpopulation (S1 Appendix 3C). A similar method, stepwise linear regression, was

103

considered and the results for both methods were compared in the appendices (S1 Appendix

104

3C and 4). Biomarker principal components were ranked by their importance, measured by

105

the proportion of variance in the biological ages that each component explained (S1

106

Appendix 3E).

107

Three health outcomes were constructed from HES and death records: (1) death from chronic

108

disease (excluding: infectious diseases, pregnancy, congenital malformations and external

109

causes),16 (2) fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) and (3) age-related non-fatal

110

hospital admissions (S1 Appendix 2). These hospital admissions are the subset of those types

111

of admissions in a published hospital frailty risk score17 that are age-related in the UK

112

Biobank (S1 Table 6). The predictive powers of chronological age and biological ages for

113

each health outcome were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for Index

114

of Multiple Deprivation 2010 quintile, smoker status, alcohol consumption and assessment

115

centre, and computing Harrell’s C-indices (measures of statistical discrimination similar to

116

the area under the receiver operating curve). Prediction of CHD and hospital admissions by

117

biological age was compared with a benchmark of prediction by a mortality score similar to

118

those proposed by previous studies2,14 and derived from stepwise Cox regression, using

119

unadjusted Cox models (S1 Appendix 3F).

120

To investigate the relationship of the biological ages to chronological age, the proportion of

121

variation in chronological age described by each biological age was estimated. The

122

proportion of the overall biological and chronological age effect on mortality, CHD and

123

hospital admission risk that was explained by each biological age was also estimated, by

124

comparing the log-likelihoods from these Cox models (S1 Appendix 3G). Calibration of

125

biological ages to chronological age and the risk calibration of biological ages with each

126

health outcome was assessed (S1 Appendix 3H).

127

The statistical analysis was repeated on biomarkers corresponding to the 10 most important

128

biomarker principal components in the analyses of the panel of 51 biomarker principal

129

components among healthy participants of each sex. The predictive and explanatory power

130

for this reduced biomarker panel was compared to the full panel. Guidelines for Transparent

131

Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis

132

(TRIPOD)18 were followed (S1 Table 14).

Results

134

Study characteristics

135

Of the 480,019 participants, 141,254 (29.4%) were in the healthy subpopulation (Table 1).

136

During a median follow up period of 8.7 years for mortality and 8.0 years for CHD and

137

hospital admissions (S1 Appendix 1), 1.7% of healthy, and 3.9% of all participants died from

138

chronic diseases; 1.9% of healthy and 4.0% of all participants without CHD at baseline had a

139

first CHD event; 16.0% of healthy and 23.1% of all participants who were not admitted to

140

hospital for age-related reasons prior to baseline had been admitted with diagnoses of these

141

conditions during follow up (S1 Table 7). Sociodemographic patterns and the proportion of

142

participants healthy at baseline were similar between sexes.

Biomarker characteristics

146

The relationships of most candidate biomarkers to chronological age were broadly linear or

147

flat (S1 Figure 3 and Figure 1). Several biomarkers displaying non-linear trends and

148

differences by sex or by prior health are highlighted in Figure 1, which shows standardised

149

biomarker levels for comparability between biomarkers. Lung function biomarkers, systolic

150

blood pressure, cystatin C and reaction time had the strongest linear relationships with age,

151

while diastolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI) and low density lipoprotein

152

cholesterol (LDL-C) had clear inverse U-shaped relationships with age that were attenuated

153

in the healthy subpopulation. Diastolic blood pressure peaked or plateaued at different ages

154

and BMI displayed different trends in the healthy and poor health subpopulation. Biomarkers

155

that displayed substantially different trends between sexes were heel bone density, LDL-C,

156

calcium, alkaline phosphatase and phosphate (S1 Figure 3).

157

Many biomarker principal components had a single biomarker strongly loaded onto them and

158

were easily characterised. Multiple biomarkers were strongly loaded onto the adiposity, lung

159

function, blood pressure and blood lipid principal components (S1 Figure 5). The coefficients

160

of the biomarker principal components in the biological ages for the healthy subpopulation

161

are listed in S1 Table 9. The estimated biological ages appeared stable in 10-fold cross

162

validation as their prediction errors were small (S1 Appendix 4 and S1 Figure 6).

Predictive power and calibration of biological ages

The KDM biological ages (based on 51 principal components) were well calibrated as they

matched healthy participants’ chronological ages on average (S1 Figure 7). The KDM ages

were more predictive of CHD and hospital admissions than the benchmark mortality score

176

(approximate increases in C-indices for CHD/hospital admissions: 0.135/0.111 in men,

177

0.109/0.068 in women), and the mortality score performed only slightly better than chance

178

(C-indices ~0.5; S1 Table 12). KDM ages alone were not statistically significantly better than

179

chronological age and did not statistically significantly supplement chronological age alone

180

in predicting the health outcomes in the healthy subpopulation (increase in C-indices for

181

mortality/CHD/hospital admissions: 0.007/0.006/0.002 in men, 0.002/0.023/0.001 in women;

182

S1 Table 13). However, when estimated in unhealthier subpopulations, they supplemented

183

chronological age alone in the prediction of mortality and CHD in these subpopulations (for

184

the whole population, increase in C-indices: 0.031/0.015 in men, 0.014/0.028 in women; S1

185

Table 13).

186

The stepwise regression age was poorly calibrated as it was distributed across a narrower age

187

range than chronological age on average (S1 Figure 7), and was not considered in further

188

analyses. The prediction results and a risk calibration assessment are described in detail in S1

Biomarker importance in biological ages

191

In the KDM ages, reduced lung function featured most strongly in the healthy subpopulation

192

(Figure 2), describing 12.4% (men) and 10.3% (women) of the variation in biological age (S1

193

Table 10). Higher cystatin C, slower reaction time, lower insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-

194

1), lower hand grip strength, higher and higher blood pressure also featured strongly for both

195

sexes; while lower albumin, higher sex hormone-binding globulin and lower muscle mass

biomarkers featured strongly for men; and higher levels of alkaline phosphatase, LDL-C and

biomarkers: respiratory, renal, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, endocrine, metabolic and

Relationship between biological and chronological age

210

The KDM ages described 44.0% and 51.3% of the variation in chronological age for healthy

211

men and women respectively. More importantly, with respect to the prediction of mortality,

212

CHD and hospital admissions, and averaged across sexes, the KDM ages described 66%,

213

80% and 63% of the overall biological and chronological age effect respectively (Figure 3A

214

and S1 Table 11). The proportion described by the KDM age is attributed to each constituent

biomarker, broadly in the proportions of biomarker importances (Figure 2). Constructing the

216

236

Key biomarker determinants of biological ages

237

Lung, kidney, cognitive and liver function, IGF-1, hand grip strength and blood pressure

238

were key contributors to biological ages for both sexes, while sex hormone-binding globulin

239

and muscle mass in men, and cardiovascular function and HbA1c in women were also

240

important.

241

The top-ranking biomarkers in this UK population generally matched those in a Singaporean

242

study9 and slight variations by sex were seen in both populations. However, these lung and

243

renal function biomarkers were not investigated in the study of Canadian, South Korean and

244

Eastern European biological ages, which instead found that the top-ranking blood-based

245

biomarkers varied by population and sex.8 Studies of ageing biomarkers also found that lung

246

and renal biomarkers were top-ranking determinants of functional decline19 and variation in

247

age-related traits.20 The present study provides additional detail on the relative importance on

248

ageing of biomarkers within body system groups, such as cystatin C over other renal

249

biomarkers (creatinine and creatinine-based eGFR),21 as previous studies each assessed only

250

one of these biomarkers.8,9,19,20

251

Several key biomarkers in this study (blood pressure, blood lipids, height and lung function)

252

have each been shown to be associated observationally, and in some cases causally, in

253

randomised trials and Mendelian randomisation studies, with a range of age-related diseases

254

(Table 2). Associations for other key determinants such as cystatin C and hand grip strength

255

have been less extensively researched, and available studies have focused on mortality and

256

cardiovascular outcomes.21-25 Blood pressure did not feature as strongly as the

257

aforementioned biomarkers in our study, despite being well-established as a modifiable and

258

causal risk factor of cardiovascular disease.26 Other cardiovascular biomarkers did not feature

259

strongly for men, whereas for women, LDL-C and apolipoprotein B, causally linked to

atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,27 were also important (Figure 2), and may have

261

contributed to better prediction of CHD in women than in men (S1 Tables 12 and 13). Cohort

262

effects in this population are difficult to disentangle, and may influence trends in body size.

263

Hence, height may be acting as a proxy for cohort effects.

Relationships of biomarkers to age

270

Lung function biomarkers, systolic blood pressure, cystatin C and reaction time had the

271

strongest linear relationships with age regardless of prior health, and therefore contributed

272

substantially to variation in the KDM biological ages (Figure 2). The differences in trends for

273

diastolic blood pressure, BMI and LDL-C by prior health were suggestive of reverse causal

274

effects of disease or medication use on biomarker levels. BMI featured less strongly in the

275

biological ages (the general adiposity component was 28th most important for men and 26th

276

for women) potentially due to reverse causality,56 but has been causally linked to 30

277

diseases.57 Therefore, BMI may be a modifiable risk factor that affects biological age.

278

Prediction in healthy versus unhealthy individuals

279

Knowledge of biological age is potentially more useful in apparently healthier individuals

280

because in unhealthy individuals, disease and hospital admissions are diagnostic indicators of

281

ageing;58 furthermore knowledge of risk of non-fatal outcomes is likely to provide a longer

282

window for intervention and prevention than knowledge of mortality risk. Biological ages

283

were better than the benchmark mortality score in predicting CHD and hospital admissions

284

(S1 Table 12). The predictive value of a biological age varied by health status and was

285

greater in unhealthy individuals (S1 Tables 12 and 13), likely reflecting the contribution of

286

diagnostic indicators of ageing. Therefore, it is important to take into account the health and

287

age profile of the population when comparing different studies.

288

The KDM permitted investigation of the relationship between biological and chronological

289

ages with respect to predicting health outcomes, and automatically calibrated biological ages

290

to chronological age. By contrast, the stepwise regression method resulted in a poorly-

291

calibrated biological age in the UK Biobank despite its frequent use in biological ageing

292

studies5,9,12 (where its risk calibration was not investigated). Comparison of an individual’s

293

biological age with their chronological age could provide a valuable means of communicating

294

modifiable health risks, alongside their detailed biomarker profile.59 A prognostic biological

295

age could also augment a national prevention programme promoting clinical biomarker

296

screening in a middle-aged population,60 after causal factors underlying its constituents have

297

been established. The most important biomarkers in biological age were measured via blood

298

biochemistry measurements, spirometry and physical measurements, which can currently be

299

administered quickly and simultaneously in clinical settings. For women, it may be suitable

300

to measure just 12 key biomarkers across 7 body systems to assess biological ageing, as

301

relatively little explanatory and predictive value was compromised. Despite the successful

302

use of clinical risk prediction tools, ‘heart age’ and ‘lung age’ in clinical care,61 there is little

303

evidence as yet of implementation of an overall biological age, and proposals to use it in drug

304

development8,16,62 and clinical care2,5,62 may be longer term uses.

305

Strengths and limitations of this study

306

The estimation methods used assumed that biomarkers with the strongest linear relation to

307

chronological age contribute most to biological age, but these biomarkers are not necessarily

308

strongly linked to health outcomes. Analysis of key determinants of biological age were

309

limited by the range of biomarkers available. Not all biomarker trends in the UK Biobank

310

were linear (S1 Figure 3), but a previous study has shown that incorporating non-linearity

311

was computationally complex and only slightly improved the accuracy of estimated

312

biological age components.63 However, the epidemiological reliability of the present analyses

313

was increased through stratification by prior health, use of biomarker principal components,

314

cross validation and adherence to clinical risk prediction reporting guidelines (S1 Table 14).18

316

A biological age consisting of clinical biomarkers reflecting functionality of a range of

317

organs accounted for a substantial proportion of the effect of age on disease and hospital

318

admissions in the UK Biobank. An overall biological age has potential to be used and

319

evaluated as a broader-based approach to risk identification and prevention than individual

320

biomarkers. Of the most important biomarkers contributing to the derived biological age,

321

cardiometabolic biomarkers have well-studied causal associations with mortality and

322

cardiovascular disease, but further research is needed to identify modifiable causal factors

323

underlying all components, for a range of age-related diseases.
