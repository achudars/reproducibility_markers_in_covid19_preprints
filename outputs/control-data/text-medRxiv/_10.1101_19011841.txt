Visual-cortex-DMN alpha dysrhythmia in PTSD p. 2

ABSTRACT
Background: Anomalies in default mode network (DMN) activity and alpha (8-12 Hz)
oscillations have been independently observed in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recent
spatiotemporal analyses suggest that alpha oscillations support DMN functioning via interregional synchronization and sensory cortical inhibition. Therefore, we examined a unifying
pathology of alpha deficits in the visual-cortex-DMN system in PTSD.
Methods: Patients with PTSD (N = 25) and two control groups—patients with Generalized
Anxiety Disorder (N = 24) and healthy controls (N = 20)—underwent a standard eyes-open
resting state (S-RS) and a modified resting state (M-RS) of passively viewing salient images
(known to deactivate the DMN). High-density electroencephalogram (hdEEG) were recorded,
from which intracortical alpha activity (power and connectivity/Granger causality) was extracted
using the exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA).
Results: Patients with PTSD (vs. controls) demonstrated attenuated alpha power in the visual
cortex and key hubs of the DMN (posterior cingulate cortex/PCC and medial prefrontal
cortex/mPFC) at both states, the severity of which further correlated with hypervigilance
symptoms. With increased visual input (at M-RS vs. S-RS), patients with PTSD further
demonstrated reduced alpha-frequency directed connectivity within the DMN (PCC mPFC)
and, importantly, from the visual cortex (VC) to both DMN hubs (VC PCC and VC mPFC),
linking alpha deficits in the two systems.
Conclusions: These interrelated alpha deficits align with DMN hypoactivity/hypoconnectivity,
sensory disinhibition, and hypervigilance in PTSD, representing a unifying neural underpinning
of these anomalies. The identification of visual-cortex-DMN alpha dysrhythmia in PTSD further
presents a novel therapeutic target, promoting network-based intervention of neural oscillations.

INTRODUCTION
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly debilitating psychiatric disorder.
Prevailing models of PTSD neuropathology have focused on dysfunctions of the prefrontalcortex-amygdala circuit (1, 2). Recently, evidence has further extended this circuit pathology to
implicate large-scale brain network anomalies in the neuropathology of PTSD (1, 3-6).
Anomalies in the default mode network (DMN), a major resting-state network (RSN), have been
especially highlighted in this literature, characterized by attenuated network activity and
disrupted network communication, involving reduced within-network and increased crossnetwork connectivity (4, 7-15).
The DMN is one of the most consistently identified RSNs, anchored in a midline core
consisting of two key hub structures—the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (16-18). While prominent in the resting state, the DMN is deactivated
by salient sensory input or externally-oriented cognitive processing and, accordingly, exhibits
reciprocal inhibition with networks associated with those processes (e.g., the visual, salience, and
dorsal attention networks) (19-22). As such, DMN dysfunctions can, on one hand, interrupt
internal mentation and ‘tranquil’ resting states and, on the other, heighten visual vigilance and
attention. Indeed, DMN dysfunction has been linked to heightened emotion/stress response and
weakened top-down regulation, perpetuating stress symptoms (18, 23, 24) and potentially
underpinning PTSD symptoms of hypervigilance and negative intrusions (7, 25, 26).
While neuroimaging data have isolated the DMN as the dominant network in the resting
brain, electrophysiological data (electroencephalogram/EEG or magnetoencephalogram/MEG)
have identified alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations as the dominant electrical activity in the resting brain
(27-29). Alpha oscillations represent a key neural mechanism in mediating long-range interregional interactions (27, 30, 31). Importantly, converging evidence has linked alpha oscillations

directly to DMN activity (especially in its hubs of PCC and mPFC), advancing the notion that
the DMN could be organized and maintained by long-range synchronization of alpha oscillations
(32-39).
While alpha oscillations positively correlate with DMN activity, they are known to
negatively correlate with visual network activity (27, 28, 39-41), consistent with the inverse
relationship between the two networks. Alpha oscillations (originating in the sensory cortex and
thalamus) play a key role in visual inhibition by suppressing visual cortical excitation and
feedforward propagation (27-31, 40, 42-47). This active function of alpha oscillations can
present a second mechanism—visual cortical inhibition—to support DMN activity. That is, by
suppressing visual processing and propagation, alpha oscillations could protect the DMN from
environmental disruptions, especially in busy sensory environments.
Alternatively, deficient alpha activity could give rise to DMN dysfunctions by failing to
sustain long-range synchronization across the DMN and failing to inhibit sensory afferents to the
DMN. Aberrant alpha oscillations have been featured in a “thalamocortical dysrhythmia” model
of neuropsychiatric disorders (48, 49), which are conceptualized transdiagnostically as
oscillopathies (50, 51). Recently, our lab demonstrated reduced resting-state alpha activity (in
both power and long-range connectivity) in patients with PTSD (vs. healthy controls and patients
with generalized anxiety disorder/GAD), which was further associated with severity of
hypervigilance (52). Given the demonstrated association between alpha oscillations and DMN
activity, we hypothesized that PTSD is associated with deficient alpha activity in the DMN and
deficient alpha-mediated inhibition of sensory cortical input to the DMN.
Therefore, extracting intracortical alpha activity using the exact low-resolution
electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA) (53) of high-density EEG, we conducted source-level

analysis of resting-state alpha activity in patients with PTSD, relative to healthy controls and
patients with GAD. The GAD group was included to rule out effects of general anxiety and
hyperarousal that would confound resting-state neural oscillations (54). To highlight the
vulnerability of the DMN to salient sensory input, we included a modified resting state (M-RS)
involving passive viewing of salient pictures, in addition to a standard, eyes-open resting state
(S-RS). We assessed two specific hypotheses of alpha deficits in PTSD, including (1) a deficit in
alpha activity (i.e., attenuated alpha power and connectivity) in the DMN and (2) a deficit of
alpha inhibition of visual cortical (VC) activity (i.e., attenuated alpha power) and relay to the
DMN (i.e., attenuated alpha-frequency directed connectivity; VC DMN), especially with strong
visual input (as in the M-RS). Finally, we examined clinical associations between such deficits
and the PTSD symptom of hypervigilance, linking neuropathology to clinical symptomatology.

METHODS & MATERIALS
Participants
The data presented here belong to a larger study, part of which was initially reported in
Clancy et al. 2017 (52). Participants consisted of outpatients with a diagnosis of PTSD (n = 25)
or GAD (n = 24), and healthy controls (HC; n = 20). Participants were matched for age and
gender across groups. All participants had no neurological disorders or history of severe
traumatic brain injury. All participants provided written, informed consent to participate in the
study, which was approved by both the Florida State University Institutional Review Board and
the Department of Defense Human Research Protection Official’s Review. Demographic details
are presented in Table 1, and in greater detail in Clancy et al. 2017 (52).

Clinical Assessment
Diagnoses were assessed by trained clinicians using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSMV (55). Participants additionally completed the PTSD Checklist for DSM-IV: civilian version
(56). In the present study, internal consistency was high for the total questionnaire (α = 0.95) and
the hyperarousal subscale (α = 0.84). As in previous work (52, 57), Item 16 assessing symptoms
of hypervigilance or ‘being watchful or on guard’ was extracted to index hypervigilance.

Experimental Paradigm
Participants were seated in a comfortable recliner in a dimly lit, sound attenuated and
electrically shielded room. High-density electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded during
two resting states. To evaluate intrinsic neural activity, a standard resting state (S-RS) recording
was conducted first, lasting 2 minutes while participants fixated on a crosshair on the screen. To
assess the impact of environmental sensory input on alpha oscillations and DMN functioning, a
modified resting state (M-RS) recording was also conducted, involving 5 minutes of passively
viewing a continuous stream of images (subtending a visual area of 7.8° X 5.8°), each for 333
ms. Images were chosen from the International Affective Picture System (58), depicting neutral
(e.g. buildings, daily objects; n = 322), positive (e.g. erotic; n = 253), and negative (e.g.
mutilation; n =346) scenes, randomly intermixed.

EEG Acquisition and Preprocessing
EEG data were recorded from a 96 channel BrainProducts actiCap system with
Neuroscan SynAmps RT amplifiers (1000 Hz sampling rate, 0.05-200 Hz online bandpass filter,
referenced to the FCz channel). Electro-oculogram (EOG) was recorded using four electrodes

with vertical and horizontal bipolar derivations. EEG/EOG data were downsampled to 250 Hz,
high-pass (1 Hz) and notch (60 Hz) filtered. We then applied Fully Automated Statistical
Thresholding for EEG artifact Rejection algorithm (FASTER) (59) for artifact detection,
correction, and rejection. Output data were epoched into 1-second segments and submitted to
eLORETA for source analyses. Details regarding the FASTER procedure are outlined in the
Supplemental Material.

Exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA)
Using the high-density, artifact-minimized EEG data, we conducted intracranial source
analyses using eLORETA, a linear inverse solution to reconstruct cortical activity with scalp
EEG data (53). The LORETA algorithm has been cross-validated in multiple studies combining
EEG-based LORETA with fMRI (60-64), positron emission tomography (65, 66), and
intracranial recordings (67). The solution space consists of 6239 cortical gray matter voxels with
a spatial resolution of 5 x 5 x 5 mm in a realistic head model. eLORETA is a suitable tool to
investigate network activity and connectivity (36, 68-70) and has provided important network
insights into psychiatric disorders (36, 54, 71).
For accurate inverse solutions, eLORETA was modeled for the S-RS and M-RS
separately, from which whole-brain source estimates of alpha (8-12 Hz) power were derived
(53). For source-based alpha-frequency connectivity analysis, time series of regions of interest
were derived from eLORETA (36), which were then submitted to Granger causality analysis
based on bivariate autoregressive (AR) modelling (72). A model order of 20 (80 ms in time for a
sampling rate of 250 Hz) was chosen in a two-step process: (1) Akaike Information Criterion

(AIC) and (2) comparing spectral estimates obtained by the Fourier-based AR model for data
pooled across all subjects (44).
Regions of Interest (ROIs): DMN hubs (i.e., PCC and mPFC) and visual cortex were
selected as ROIs (16, 73). ROIs were defined by grey-matter voxels within a 10 mm radius of the
ROI centroids (53, 71). All ROIs were centered on the midline to incorporate both hemispheres,
with centroid coordinates obtained from the Neurosynth (www.neurosynth.org) meta-analysis
maps (as peak voxels) of “default mode” (for the PCC: 0, -50, 30 and the mPFC: 0, 50, 0) and
“passive viewing” (for the visual cortex: 0, -90, 20). All coordinates are reported in Montreal
Neurological Institute (MNI) space. For connectivity analysis, both directions for each pair were
examined such that the three ROIs resulted in a 3 x 3 matrix of alpha-GC connectivity for each
of the two resting states.

Statistical Analyses
Source-level power and GC were submitted to planned simple contrasts of States (S-RS
vs. M-RS) to demonstrate the extent of alpha adaption from S-RS to M-RS. We then performed
simple contrasts of Group (PTSD vs. Control) for the two states to test PTSD-related deficits in
alpha power and GC, and double contrasts of State and Group to assess the effect of visual
stimulation (S-RS minus M-RS) between groups. Pearson correlations were performed to assess
clinical associations of alpha power and GC with symptom severity of hypervigilance. Guided by
our previous surface-level analysis showing no difference between the two control (GAD and
HC) (52), we combined them into a single Control group. In Supplemental Results, we
confirmed that these two control groups did not differ in the source-level analyses.

Multiple-comparison corrections were applied for the analyses. For power analyses
involving whole-brain voxel-wise comparisons, we used Monte Carlo simulations (with actual
Gaussian filter widths extracted from the data) to derive the corrected threshold (p < .05): voxel
level p < 0.005 (one-tailed) over eleven contiguous voxels. As for connectivity analyses, the 3 x
3 connectivity matrix resulted in 6 comparisons for each hypothesis testing, for which we applied
the false discovery rate (FDR) criterion (FDR p < .05). Lastly, for clinical association analyses,
we conducted confirmatory correlation analyses constrained to regions demonstrating main
effects, for which correction was not applied. We also applied a whole-brain regression of alpha
power on hypervigilance scores, followed by Monte Carlo multiple comparison correction.
Trend-level and non-corrected effects will be reported but not further discussed.

RESULTS
PTSD-related alpha power deficits in the DMN and visual cortex
Validating intracranial source estimation of alpha oscillations, we observed “alpha
blocking” by visual stimulation. Specifically, the contrast between S-RS versus M-RS (collapsed
across groups) isolated alpha power reduction at M-RS across a large cluster (624 voxels)
spanning bilateral visual cortices (peak voxel: -20, -100, 0; t = -4.50; Supplemental Figure 1A).
Next, simple contrasts of Group (PTSD vs. Controls) revealed alpha power deficits in
PTSD across the visual and DMN ROIs at each state. The visual cortex exhibited the strongest
group effects: at S-RS, a large cluster (283 voxels) spanning bilateral cuneus (peaks: 5, -70, 30/5, -70, 30; t’s < -3.41), bilateral precuneus (peaks: 5, -60, 35/-5, -65, 25; t’s < -3.75), and the
right superior occipital gyrus (peak: 40, -80, 25; t = -3.90; Figure 1A); at M-RS, a cluster (68
voxels) in the bilateral precuneus, overlapping the S-RS cluster (peaks: 5, -55, 50/-5, -55, 40; t’s

< -3.11; Figure 1B). Regarding the DMN, alpha deficits emerged in PTSD in the bilateral PCC
for both states (S-RS: 60 voxels; peaks: 15, -45, 40/-5, -50, 35; t’s < -3.32; M-RS: 199 voxels;
peaks: 5, -30, 25/-5, -30, 25; t’s < -3.76; Figure 1A-B), and the bilateral mPFC at M-RS only (88
voxels; peaks: 15, 60, -10/-15, 65, -15; t’s < -3.10; Figure 1B). Additional alpha power deficits
(whole-brain corrected) appeared in the bilateral insula (S-RS: right/left: 49/76 voxels; peaks: 35,
-5, 20/-35, 20, 5; Figure 1A; M-RS: right/left: 136/25 voxels; peaks: 40, -5, 15/-30, 25, 5; Figure
1B; t’s < -3.52). No significant clusters emerged for enhanced alpha power in the PTSD group,
even at a lenient threshold of p < .05. Finally, double contrasts of State (M-RS minus S-RS) and
Group (PTSD minus Control) yielded no difference between groups (voxel-level p’s > 0.11).
These group effects are summarized in Table 2.

PTSD-related alpha connectivity deficits within and between the DMN and visual cortex
Like the power analyses above, we first assessed the effect of State (S-RS vs. M-RS) on
alpha-frequency connectivity (collapsed across the groups). We observed reduced bidirectional
alpha connectivity from the S-RS to the M-RS within the DMN: PCC

mPFC (M-RS minus S-

RS; t = -3.49, p = 0.001, FDR p < 0.05) and mPFC PCC (t = -3.14, p = 0.003, FDR p < 0.05;
Supplemental Figure 1B), suggesting disrupted DMN connectivity in general by salient visual
input (at M-RS).
Next, simple contrasts of Group for the S-RS revealed reduced alpha connectivity from
the PCC to the visual cortex/VC (PCC

VC) in PTSD (vs. Controls; t = -2.26, p = 0.027; Figure

2A), albeit failing FDR correction. No other effects emerged during this state (p’s > .34). For the
M-RS, the PTSD group (vs. Controls) demonstrated reduced connectivity within the DMN,
including PCC

mPFC (t = -2.82, p = .008, FDR p < 0.05; Figure 2B) and, at a trend level,

mPFC PCC (t = -1.91, p = 0.064). The PTSD group demonstrated additional deficits in alpha
connectivity from the visual cortex to both DMN ROIs at M-RS: VC PCC (t = -3.06, p =
0.004, FDR p < 0.05) and VC mPFC (t = -2.05, p = .049; albeit not FDR corrected). No effect
appeared in the opposite (DMN VC) direction (p’s > 0.12).
Double contrasts of State (M-RS minus S-RS) and Group (PTSD vs. Control) revealed
different effects of state (i.e., visual stimulation) on connectivity between the groups. Greater
connectivity reduction from S-RS to M-RS appeared in the PTSD (vs. Control) group in
VC PCC (t = -2.22, p = 0.032) and VC mPFC (t = -2.18, p = 0.036). Specifically, from S-RS
to M-RS, significant connectivity reduction emerged in VC PCC (t = -2.84, p = 0.011, FDR p <
0.05) and VC mPFC (t = -3.04, p = 0.007, FDR p < 0.05) in the PTSD group, but none in the
Control group (p’s > 0.628). These group effects are also summarized in Table 2.

Clinical Associations
We then performed correlation analyses, regressing power or connectivity values on
symptom severity in hypervigilance. Confirmatory analyses (constrained to the regions identified
in the main contrasts) revealed negative associations between hypervigilance and alpha power in
the precuneus/superior parietal lobule at S-RS (39 voxels; peak: -20, -75, -55; r = -0.49, p < .005;
Figure 3A) and the DMN at M-RS: PCC (13 voxels; peak: 5, -45, 45; r = -0.28, p < .05) and
mPFC (50 voxels; peak: -10, 65, -15; r = -0.30, p < .05; Figure 3B). Whole-brain regression
analysis further revealed negative associations with alpha power in the ventral visual cortex at SRS (left inferior temporal gyrus: 13 voxels; peak: -55, -5, -40; r = -0.40, p < .005 whole-brain
corrected; Figure 3A). There was no significant correlation between hypervigilance and alpha
connectivity (p’s > 0.20).

DISCUSSION
Source-level analysis of RS alpha oscillations isolated alpha (power and connectivity)
deficits in the DMN and visual cortex in PTSD, especially during strong visual stimulation. In
support of our first hypothesis — alpha deficits in the DMN, the PTSD group demonstrated
reduced alpha power in the posterior DMN hub (the PCC) at both S-RS and M-RS as well as the
anterior hub (the mPFC) at M-RS, accompanied by reduced DMN (PCC mPFC) alphafrequency connectivity at M-RS. In support of the second hypothesis — alpha deficits in the
visual cortex, the PTSD group exhibited reduced alpha power in the visual cortex at both states.
Importantly, joining alpha deficits in the two neural systems, diminished alpha-frequency
connectivity from the visual cortex to the DMN was observed in the PTSD group at M-RS.
Finally, alpha power deficits in the DMN and visual cortex directly correlated with symptom
severity of hypervigilance. Therefore, linking anomalies in DMN and alpha activity in PTSD, the
current results indicate interrelated alpha deficits in the DNM and visual cortex, implicating
visual-cortex-DMN alpha dysrhythmia in the neuropathology of PTSD.
Neural oscillations actively participate in mental activities by modulating local neuronal
excitability and mediating long-range neural communication (51, 74). Aberrant resting-state
(intrinsic) neural oscillations (e.g., thalamocortical dysrhythmia) in neuropsychiatric disorders
has been increasingly recognized (48, 49, 75), promoting the transdiagnostic conceptualization of
“oscillopathies” for these disorders (50, 51). Advancements in neural computational algorithms
(such as eLORETA) have permitted intracranial source estimation of neural oscillations in
hdEEG recordings, providing important insights into oscillatory dysrhythmia in multiple
disorders, e.g., schizophrenia (76, 77), depression (71), and PTSD (78). As validation of our

hdEEG source analysis, we confirmed a strong “alpha blocking” effect of visual stimulation by
demonstrating extensive alpha power reduction in bilateral visual cortices from the S-RS
(minimal visual input) to the M-RS (strong visual input). By contrast, no other regions emerged
from this contrast, highlighting the sensitivity and specificity of this source analysis of alpha
oscillations.
Our source-level group analysis further identified alpha deficits within and between the
visual cortex and the DMN in PTSD. Concerning the visual cortex, alpha oscillations are known
to mediate visual cortical inhibition, and accordingly, alpha power correlates inversely with
visual cortical activity (27, 28, 40, 41). In the PTSD group, reduced alpha power in the visual
cortex was extensive and enduring across states. Without visual stimulation (at S-RS, reflecting
intrinsic activity), alpha deficits spanned a large cluster over the cuneus, precuneus, and superior
occipital gyrus, suggesting wide-spread, intrinsic neural disinhibition and hyperactivity across
primary and secondary visual cortices in PTSD. This sensory cortical disinhibition aligns with
extant electrophysiological evidence of impaired sensory gating and sensory cortical
hyperactivity (to simple, neutral stimuli) (79-82) and behavioral disturbances in sensory
filtering/gating and response in these patients (79, 83). With strong visual input at M-RS, alpha
power reduction was particularly localized to the parietal visual cortex (primarily bilateral
precuneus). Given that this region is strongly involved in visual spatial attention and perception
(84-86) and that the M-RS condition mimics a real-life environment with salient sensory
information, this alpha deficit (reflective of disinhibited visual spatial attention) can underlie
hypervigilance in PTSD, expressed as excessive alertness to and scanning of the environment
(87).

As mentioned above, alpha oscillations also play a critical role in long-range neural
communication and is especially involved in the DMN; accordingly, alpha power correlates
positively with DMN activity (32-39). The alpha deficit in the DMN hubs thus align with the
extant literature citing DMN hypoactivity in PTSD (4, 7). The fact that DMN alpha power
reduction extended from the PCC only at S-RS to both the PCC and mPFC at M-RS accentuates
the particular DMN vulnerability in PTSD in a sensory-rich environment. In addition, as alpha
oscillations synchronize activity and facilitate coherence across regions, reduced alpha power in
these key DMN hubs further suggests compromised communication across the network in PTSD.
Indeed, connectivity analyses revealed reduced PCC mPFC alpha connectivity at M-RS in the
PTSD group. This hypo-connectivity between the DMN hubs highlights impaired
communication within the core architecture of the DMN. Clinically, DMN alpha deficits in both
local power and inter-hub connectivity, especially acute in a sensory-rich environment, could
contribute to difficulty in maintaining “tranquility” or “rest” (7, 17, 25) and avoidance of sensory
stimulation in patients with PTSD (79, 83).
Our manipulation of visual stimulation between the two states revealed a direct link
between alpha deficits in the visual cortex and the DMN. Consistent with general DMN
susceptibility to salient sensory input, we confirmed a general reduction (in the entire sample) in
bidirectional alpha connectivity between the DMN hubs (PCC mPFC and mPFC PC) as
visual input increased from the S-RS to the M-RS. Beyond that, in the PTSD (but not Control)
group, increased visual stimulation (from S-RS to M-RS) further diminished visual cortical alpha
connectivity to both DMN hubs (VC PCC and VC mPFC). As mentioned above, alpha
oscillations in the sensory cortex mediate sensory inhibition, such that this VC DMN alpha
projection would serve to protect the DMN by blocking sensory afferents to the network.

Visual-cortex-DMN alpha dysrhythmia in PTSD p. 16

However, while this protective inhibitory process withstood the increased visual input at M-RS
in the Control group, it broke down among patients with PTSD, suggesting impaired gating of
sensory entry to (i.e., compromised protection of) the DMN. Exploratory correlation analyses
further indicated a close correlation between VC PCC and PCC mPFC alpha connectivity at
M-RS (r = 0.31, p = 0.013), highlighting a mechanistic link between these two pathways. That is,
disinhibited visual cortical propagation to the PCC, in the presence of strong environmental
input, could further impair PCC-driven alpha synchronization with the mPFC, worsening DMN
dysfunction in PTSD.
Together, current findings implicate a core visual-cortex-DMN system of alpha
dysrhythmia in PTSD. The critical role of visual cortical alpha deficits in this pathology lends
credence to our sensory hypothesis of PTSD centered on sensory cortical disinhibition (52, 88)
and bottom-up accounts of PTSD in general (89, 90). This core visual-cortex-DMN system of
alpha dysrhythmia was reinforced by the specificity of alpha deficit sources. Despite the use of
whole-brain analyses, group differences in alpha power and clinical associations between alpha
power and hypervigilance were localized to the visual cortex and the DMN only (except for the
insula as discussed below). While DMN hypoactivity is known to be associated with PTSD
symptom severity (5, 7, 14, 91), the clinical association in the visual cortex highlights an
additional pathway linking visual cortical disinhibition to PTSD symptoms. Notably, the
associations with hypervigilance implicate not only both the dorsal (i.e., the parietal cortex) and
ventral visual cortices (i.e., the inferior temporal gyrus) but also the higher-order regions with
strong interactions with limbic and frontal regions. As the ventral visual cortex underpins visual
object perception, its involvement here aligns with the fact that hypervigilance in PTSD

associated with hyperactivity and hypersensitivity to (threat and neutral) sensory cues (92, 93), in
addition to exessive spatial scanning engaging the doral visual cortex.
While the insula was not an a priori ROI in the current study, expansive alpha deficits
spanning the posterior and anterior insula emerged in PTSD following whole-brain correction.
The insula is a highly heterogeneous structure, with the posterior portion receiving strong
sensory afferents and the anterior portion densely connected with limbic and prefrontal regions
as a key node of the salience network/SN (94-97). Abnormal insular and SN activity has been
repeatedly observed in patients with PTSD (4, 15), and alpha suppression via neurofeedback can
increase SN activity (98). Our data provide preliminary evidence of insular alpha dysrhythmia in
PTSD, potentially underlying some of the insular anomalies.
We included patients with GAD as an additional control condition to rule out general
effects of anxiety and arousal on alpha activity. Our previous sensor-level analysis of alpha
oscillations revealed no alpha deficits in this group (52), which directed us to combine patients
with GAD and healthy controls into one control group in the source-level analysis. Nonetheless,
as reported in Supplemental Results, we systematically examined source-level anomalies in the
GAD group, confirming no difference between them and healthy controls, except for enhanced
mPFC PCC alpha connectivity at M-RS. We surmise that this mPFC PCC hyper-connectivity
could heighten DMN functioning in GAD, supporting the hallmark symptoms of self-referential
rumination and worry in these patients. Overall, these results ruled out the possible confound of
general anxious arousal in attenuating alpha activity, highlighting a specific alpha dysrhythmia in
PTSD.
Integrative neuroimaging and electrophysiological research have promoted the idea that
alpha oscillations sustain and facilitate DMN functioning by synchronizing spontaneous activity

across the network and suppressing sensory cortical propagation. Translating these mechanisms
to the neuropathology of PTSD, we confirmed interconnected alpha deficits in the DMN and
visual cortex in patients with PTSD. Therefore, the current findings provide the first evidence of
visual-cortex-DMN alpha dysrhythmia in PTSD, presenting a unifying neural underpinning of
sensory disinhibition, DMN dysfunction, and hypervigilance in this disorder. The specification
of this alpha dysrhythmia further isolates a novel therapeutic target, promoting network-based
interventions (15) using brain stimulation of alpha oscillations (99) in the visual-cortex-DMN
system as a new line of treatment for PTSD.

SUPPLEMENTARY METHODS
FASTER Algorithm
The Fully Automated Statistical Thresholding for EEG artifact Rejection (FASTER)
algorithm was used for the detection and removal of artifacts within the data. Using a z-score
threshold of ± 3, the FASTER algorithm detects and corrects for artifacts within single channels,
individual epochs, independent components, and within-epoch channels. FASTER first
interpolates deviant channels from the continuous data using the EEGLAB spherical spline
interpolation function. Data were then segmented into non-overlapping, 1-second long, meancentered epochs. Epochs were then rejected based on z-scores ± 3 within parameters of
amplitude range, variance, and deviation. Epoched data were then re-referenced to averaged
mastoids and submitted to independent component analysis (ICA) decomposition using the
Infomax algorithm. Artefactual components (i.e. muscular artifacts, eye blinks and saccades,
electrode “pop-offs”, etc.) were automatically detected and removed from the data. Lastly,
deviant channels within individual, cleaned epochs were interpolated again using the EEGLAB
spherical spline interpolation function.

SUPPLEMENTARY RESULTS

Group contrasts of alpha power

Alpha power contrasts of PTSD versus healthy controls (HC) and GAD controls,
individually, revealed consistent results to those reported in the main text (Supplemental Figure
2). At S-RS, relative to HC, patients with PTSD demonstrated reduced alpha in a large (71
voxel) cluster spanning the PCC/precuneus (peak: 20, -60, 35) and cuneus/superior occipital

gyrus (peak: 45, -80, 25; t’s < -3.42). A contrast of PTSD vs. GAD revealed a similar cluster
(112 voxel) spanning the PCC/precuneus (peak: 15, -50, 40) and cuneus (peak: 5, -65, 15; t’s <
3.31). Finally, patients with PTSD demonstrated reduced alpha in the right insula compared to
HC (10 voxels; peak: 35, -5, 15; t’s < -3.18) and left insula compared to GAD (30 voxels; peak: 30, 25, 0; t’s < 3.29).

At M-RS, patients with PTSD demonstrated similar reductions in alpha power over a
large cluster spanning the PCC/precuneus, relative to HC (121 voxels; peak: 5, -55, 50; t’s < 2.41) and GAD (112 voxels; peak: 15, -45, 40; t’s < -3.31). An additional cluster emerged in the
mPFC, relative to HC (10 voxels; peak: 10, 65, 0; t’s < 2.87) and GAD (95 voxels; peak: -15, 65,
-15; t’s < -3.31), consistent with results reported in the main text spanning the posterior and
anterior hubs of the DMN. Additional deficits emerged in the right insula compared to HC (10
voxels; peak: 45, -5, 15; t’s < -2.98) and bilateral insula compared to GAD (right/left: 84/65
voxels; peak: 60, -15, 30/-30, 25, 5; t’s < -3.58). Notably, there were no significant differences
between HC and GAD groups at either state.

Group contrasts of alpha-frequency connectivity
Alpha connectivity contrasts of PTSD versus healthy controls (HC) and GAD controls,
individually, revealed consistent results to those reported in the main text (Supplemental Table
1). At S-RS, a marginal decrease in alpha connectivity from PCC

VC emerged in PTSD (vs.

HC: t = -1.72, p = 0.092; vs. GAD: t = -1.83, p = 0.073). At M-RS, PTSD similarly showed
decreased alpha connectivity from PCC
2.68, p = 0.010), as well as from VC

mPFC (vs. HC: t =-2.78, p = 0.008; vs. GAD: t = PCC (vs. HC: t = -2.36, p = 0.023; vs. GAD: t = -3.30, p

= 0.002). Notably, HC and GAD did not differ on any of these contrasts (p’s > 0.224). However,

relative to both PTSD and HC, the GAD group demonstrated increased alpha connectivity from
mPFC

PCC (PTSD vs. GAD: t = 3.25, p = 0.003; HC vs. GAD: t = 2.65, p = 0.012),

suggesting GAD-specific augmentation in alpha connectivity.
Double contrasts of State (M-RS minus S-RS) and individual Group additionally revealed
marginally greater decreases in VC PCC alpha connectivity from the S-RS to M-RS in PTSD
relative to HC (t = 1.87, p = 0.068) and GAD (t = -1.87, p = 0.069). Furthermore, greater
decreases in VC mPFC alpha connectivity emerged from the PTSD versus GAD contrast (t = 2.29, p = 0.027), but not for the PTSD versus HC contrast (t = -1.50, p = 0.142), albeit in the
right direction. HC and GAD did not differ on any of these contrasts (p’s > 0.411).
