Research indicates students of lower socioeconomic status (SES) are educationally disadvantaged. We sought to
examine differences in paramedic student academic performance from counties with varying SES in the United
States. Student performance data and SES data were combined for counties within the states of California,
Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and Virginia. Linear multiple regression modelling was performed to determine
the relationship between income, high school graduation rate, poverty and food insecurity with first-attempt
scores on the Fisdap Paramedic Readiness Exam (PRE) versions 3 and 4. Linear regression models indicated
that there was a significant relationship between county-level income, poverty, graduation rate, food insecurity,
and paramedic student academic performance. It remains unclear what type of relationship exists between
individual SES and individual academic performance of paramedic students. These findings support the future
collection of individual student level SES data in order to identify issues and mitigate impact on academic
performance.

Introduction
With over 50 million Americans living at or below the poverty line (Oxfam, 2019), poverty is
a social issue that is endemic across the United States. Those living in poverty face
challenges in accessing healthcare, education and food – things many take for granted. In
addition, over 50 million Americans are food insecure, meaning they lack consistent access to
enough food to lead an active, healthy life (Gundersen, 2013). This results in children and
students going to bed hungry at night. Often times, a school breakfast will be their only meal
for the day. Living in poverty means these students are less likely to finish high school or
college, which may further influence their lifestyle as adults, including job prospects,
decisions around diet, recreational activities, and substance use (Lacour & Tissington, 2011;
Ladd, 2012). In addition, poverty and low socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with
visible low social status, and this can be a source of intrinsic chronic stress, increasing
vulnerability to distress and potentially destructive coping mechanisms (Mulia, Schmidt,
Bond, Jacobs, & Korcha, 2008).
SES, which is a measure based largely on income, education and occupation, is a major social
basis for inequalities and an important predictor of an individual’s health, career and lifetime

earnings. Low SES is strongly associated with lower educational attainment (Lacour &
Tissington, 2011; van der Berg, 2008), and this association is observable across data from
local to national levels (Ladd, 2012). Students from low SES households are more likely to
experience food insecurity (Dean & Sharkey, 2011), which is strongly associated with
precarious housing status (Goldrick-Rab, Richardson, Schneider, Hernandez, & Cady, 2018;
Hughes, Serebryanikova, Donaldson, & Leveritt, 2011; Silva et al., 2017), and in turn is
related to lower academic success (Roustit, Grillo, Martin, & Chauvin, 2015). An estimated
25% to 36% of post-secondary students suffer from food insecurity (Silva et al., 2017), more
so in the community college population (Goldrick-Rab et al., 2018). If students are food
insecure, they may face difficulties in their educational pursuits.
Considering that socioeconomic issues exert such influence on student performance,
educators should remain aware of such issues within their student population. Educators who
are unaware of these influences may be less likely to connect students to appropriate supports
in order to foster success. Unless educators appropriately support students from low SES
backgrounds, paramedic training programs risk precipitating a cycle that makes them less
likely to enrol in college in the first instance, more likely to fail out, and less likely to have
formal qualifications when compared to their peers from higher SES backgrounds (Blanden
& Gregg, 2004; National Student Clearinghouse, 2016). Lack of support ultimately
negatively affects adult working life, in terms of both income and working hours (Duncan,
Magnuson, Kalil, & Ziol-Guest, 2012; Duncan, Magnuson, & Votruba-Drzal, 2017)
Importantly, this means support both from inside and outside of educational institutions is
essential. If students lack adequate support at home from family and peers, this can present a
further barrier to their educational attainment (Engle, 2007). Due in part to the parents’ own
education level, and the chronic stress associated with poverty and low SES, families living
in high poverty, high unemployment and low education neighbourhoods are likely to employ
fewer education-oriented practices with their children (Greenman, Bodovski, & Reed, 2011).
Evidence shows that increased parental involvement in academic matters can mitigate some
of the effects of low SES (Greenman et al., 2011). Increased family support has been
demonstrated to directly influence overall academic achievement and retention rates at the
community college level (Kuh, Kinzie, Buckley, Bridges, & Hayek, 2006).
Many paramedic programs are delivered through the community college system and therefore
it is a source of concern that many programs do not routinely collect information related to
student SES. While the relationship between individual SES and academic performance in
paramedic students remains unclear, there is strong evidence from the broader literature to
suggest that low SES can result in negative effects on academic performance. Such data
within paramedic education programs needs to be collected, otherwise educators will remain
blind to the effects of SES on students. Additionally, students from certain geographical areas
may face challenges when they enter and paramedic education programs due to the local
socioeconomic climate. It is highly unlikely that all students from a low SES background
would report such issues, due to the significant stigma associated with poverty and low SES.

In light of the ease of availability of county-level SES data, we proposed to investigate if
these data could be used to uncover some of the concerns we have highlighted in relation to
poverty, income, food insecurity and parental education, specifically in relation to paramedic
students. These insights will then be used to explore potential solutions for consideration.
Aim
We sought to examine the relationship between paramedic student academic performance and
county-level SES indicators. Additionally, we sought to examine the relationship between a
paramedic applicant’s parental education level and the applicant’s entrance exam scores. We
hypothesized that paramedic students from counties with lower SES (as defined by median
income, percent living below the poverty line, percent of food insecurity and high school
graduation rate) would demonstrate lower performance on exams when compared to students
from counties with higher SES (as defined by the same criteria). We also hypothesized that
lower parental education level would be associated with lower applicant entrance exam
scores.
Methods
Ethics approval
This study was conducted with ethics approval from Inver Hills Community College in
Grove Heights, Minnesota.
Data collection
Data were acquired for paramedic students with accounts in Fisdap™, an internet-based EMS
education administrative database in the states of California, Virginia, Louisiana, Texas and
Mississippi. These states were selected to allow for variation in SES as well as an adequate
number of paramedic programs that enter data into Fisdap™. In addition to basic
demographic data, entrance exam (EE) scores from September 2018 to January 2019, were
collected for these students. Parent education level was also collected from EE data.
Paramedic Readiness Exam (PRE versions 3 and 4) scores from 2011 to 2019, were obtained
for these students as well. Only scores from the first attempt at the PREs were counted.
Publicly accessible SES data for all counties within the identified states were acquired from
the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation County Health Rankings for 2017, and US Census
data. ZIP code data were converted to county for each state via an online US ZIP Code
lookup tool.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Records from students who had indicated their consent for research, had complete
demographic information, including ZIP code, and who had made at least one attempt on the
EE, PRE3 or PRE4 (not all programs use all exams) were included in the analyses. Records

from students who did not give consent for research, that had incomplete demographic data,
or missing ZIP code information were excluded from analyses. Only first attempt scores were
included, and counties with less than 5 reported scores were excluded.
Data analysis
Statistical analyses were performed in R (R Core Team, 2019). A multiple linear regression
analyses was performed utilizing PRE3 and PRE4 scores, combined with income, poverty
level, high-school graduation rate and food insecurity data to determine predictive
relationships between these variables. To obtain the relationship of each parental educational
level EE score, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted with score as the
dependent level and the parent education level (with six levels) as the factor. Continuous
variables are presented as means, median, standard deviations (SD). p <0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

Definitions
The following definitions are utilized in the County Health Rankings Report (Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation, 2019), and the US Census Data (United States Census Bureau, 2019),
and are applicable to the data and discussion in this study.
Socioeconomic status (SES): an economic and sociological combined total measure of a
person's work experience and of an individual's or family's economic and social position in
relation to others, based on income, education, and occupation.
Poverty: the Census Bureau uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size
and composition to determine who is in poverty. If a family's total income is less than the
family's threshold, then that family and every individual in it is considered in poverty. The
official poverty thresholds do not vary geographically, but they are updated for inflation. The
official poverty definition uses money income before taxes and does not include capital gains
or noncash benefits (such as public housing, Medicaid, and food stamps). [variable: Poverty]
Food insecurity: the percentage of the population who did not have access to a reliable source
of food during the past year. This measure was modelled using information from the
Community Population Survey, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and American Community
Survey [variable: Food]
High school graduation: the percentage of ninth grade cohort that graduates high school in
four years. [variable: GradRate]
Median household income: the income where half of households in a county earn more and
half of households earn less. Income, defined as “Total income” is the sum of the amounts
reported separately for: wage or salary income; net self-employment income; interest,

These results indicate that there was a collective significant effect between income, poverty,
graduation rate, food insecurity, and PRE4 scores, (F(4,54)=4.72, p < 0.01, R2=.26). The

Discussion
This study demonstrated that county-level SES indicators, in particular a combination of
income, poverty level, high school graduation rate and food insecurity, had a significant
relationship with paramedic student academic performance. Median household income is a
well-recognized indicator of income and poverty, and this income at a county-level was
significantly related to exam scores in both PRE3 and PRE4 exams. With one in four children
in the United States living on or below the poverty line (Oxfam, 2019), this is a cause for
concern.
Parental academic achievement was significantly associated with EE scores in this study.
This is significant due to previous research which demonstrated that performance on the EE
positively predicted first-time pass rate on the National Registry of Emergency Medical
Technicians Cognitive Exam (Page, Bowen, & Stanke, 2015), and was associated with
performance on cardiology and airway unit exams (Page, Bowen, & Stanke, 2013). EE
performance was also associated with graduation success in paramedic programs
(Renkiewicz et al., 2015).
There is significant stigma attached to lower SES (Johnson, Richeson, & Finkel, 2011;
Stewart et al., 2009; Williams, 2009), which may present as a barrier to individual students
seeking assistance. In order to remove such barriers, paramedic programs may consider
interventions such as online resources regarding income support, the provision of
scholarships, and access to confidential counselling and support services. In addition,
programs should endeavour to highlight the availability of existing resources within the larger
college or university community. These may include resources such as financial aid, health
plans, legal advice, used book stores, bike-shares, and transit passes.
Paramedic programs are often delivered through community colleges, and such students are
more likely to go a day without eating than their university counterparts (Goldrick-Rab et al.,
2018). Food insecurity and housing instability can negatively affect classroom attendance,
academic performance and the ability to continue in higher education (Broton & GoldrickRab, 2016; Goldrick-Rab et al., 2018). Paramedic programs may need to consider
implementing interventions such as food banks, sharing shops, breakfast clubs, information
on food supplementation, and rent and meal subsidies where appropriate. Despite the
evidence that SES affects student academic performance, paramedic programs do not
routinely collect information on the individual SES of their students. It remains unclear what
type of relationship exists between individual SES and individual academic performance of
paramedic students. This study suggests that paramedic programs should attempt to collect
individual SES data from students that can then be used to identify issues and mitigate any
potential effects of SES on academic performance. Such data would need to be collected and
acted upon in confidence.

Limitations
The results presented are subject to several limitations. The study was limited to data
obtained retrospectively, from self-reported demographic data, and first attempt at entrance,
PRE-3 and PRE-4 paramedic exams submitted to Fisdap™. Not all paramedic programs in
the United States use the Fisdap™ database and testing products. The sequence of tests, and
the conditions under which the tests were conducted (proctored, open-book, timed etc.)
cannot be determined from the Fisdap™ data. Students may have entered their program or
work address instead of their home address. Counties and ZIP codes generally contain
significant variability in SES, and this cannot be accounted for in our data. County-level data
also do not reflect individual student SES, which is a more accurate predictor of individual
student success. There is no prior evidence this data exists, hence the use of surrogate data
markers. Counties that had less than 5 reported scores and records that were missing ZIP
codes were excluded from analysis.
Conclusion
This study has demonstrated that county-level SES factors are associated with paramedic
student academic performance. While this study utilised county-level data as a surrogate for
individual student SES, it does provide some insight into the potential effects that a student’s
background may have on their academic performance. Accepting that the results need to be
interpreted in the context of the significant limitations of such an approach, given the lack of
other avenues by which to explore this issue, we believe that the results nevertheless improve
our understanding of the issue. The results of this study also serve to highlight for the first
time within paramedic education the identified role of SES on academic performance. This
issue remains (anecdotally) poorly addressed within paramedic education programs. Given
the evidence that SES can impact academic performance in general, this study supports the
collection of individual student level SES data in order to accurately identify and address its
effects on student success in education programs.
