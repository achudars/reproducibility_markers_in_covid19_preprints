Abstract
Background: Extended-spectrum betalactamase (ESBL-) producing K. pneumoniae is one of
the most common causes of infections with antimicrobial resistant bacteria worldwide. The
spread of colonization of humans with this pathogen is on the rise. The future prevalence of
colonization with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, and the potential of public health
interventions to lower it, remain uncertain. Methods: Based on detailed data on antimicrobial
consumption and susceptibility systematically recorded for over 13 years in a Swiss region, we
developed a mathematical model to i) reconstruct the observed course of colonization with

ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae; and ii) to assess the potential impact of public health
interventions on future trends in colonization. Results: Simulated prevalence of
colonization with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae stabilized in the near future when rates of
antimicrobial consumption and in-hospital transmission remained stable in the main
analyses (simulated prevalence in 2025 was 5.3% (5.0%-9.1%) in hospitals and 2.7%
(2.1%-4.6%) in the community versus 5.6% (5.1%-9.5%) and 2.8% (2.2%-5.0%) in 2019).
The largest changes in future prevalence were observed in simulations that assumed
changes in overall antimicrobial consumption. When overall antimicrobial consumption was
set to decrease by 50%, prevalence in 2025 declined by 89% in hospitals and by 84% in the
community. A 50% decline in transmission rate within hospitals led to a reduction in
prevalence of 43% in hospitals and of 13% in the community by 2025. Prevalence changed
much less (<9%) across scenarios with reduced carbapenem consumption. Assuming higher
rates for the contribution from external sources of colonization, led to decreasing
estimations of future prevalence in hospitals. While high uncertainty remains on the
magnitude of these contribution, the best model fit suggested that as much as 46% (95% CI:
12%-96 %) of observed colonizations could be attributable to sources other than human-tohuman transmission within the geographical setting (i.e., non-local transmission).
Conclusions: This study suggests that overall antimicrobial consumption will be, by far, the

Introduction
Over 650,000 infections with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria with more than 33,000
attributable deaths are estimated to occur every year in the European Union (1). The rapid
spread of extended-spectrum betalactamase (ESBL-) producing Enterobacteriaceae, and the
subsequent increase in carbapenem consumption is of global concern (2-5). Local and
external interacting sources of colonization mediate this spread in a population. Local
sources of colonization include human-to-human transmission within communities that
share geographic proximity. External sources of colonization include traveling to regions
with high prevalence of colonization with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (highprevalence regions), as well as consumption of contaminated food (6-8). Transmission of
ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, in particular Klebsiella pneumoniae, is known to be
enhanced by hospitalizations and antimicrobial consumption (7, 9, 10). Infections caused by
K. pneumoniae are the third most prevalent among resistant pathogens (1) and a major
clinical challenge.
Theoretical and data-driven studies have characterized the sensitivity of drug resistance to
differences in the spatial distribution of antimicrobial drug use (11-13). But to which extent
antimicrobial consumption and local and external sources of colonization have contributed
to the spread of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, and the magnitude of their effect on the
future prevalence of colonization with this pathogen, is not yet understood. This knowledge
is however necessary to accurately project the future burden of colonization with ESBLproducing K. pneumoniae, and to design public health interventions capable of effectively
tackling this process.
The prevalence of colonization with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae in Switzerland is
steadily increasing throughout the country, as evidenced by data from the Swiss Centre for
Antibiotic Resistance; (ANRESIS). This prevalence is lower in Switzerland than it is in its
neighbouring countries, and similar to that in the Netherlands, Norway and Denmark (14,

15). The future prevalence of colonization with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, and the
potential of public health interventions to reduce it, remain uncertain.
This study aimed to project the future prevalence of colonization with ESBL-producing K.
pneumoniae under different public health interventions by means of a mathematical model
calibrated to a population with stable structure and subject to incoming sources of
colonization. We did this by means of a mathematical model that reconstructed the course of
the prevalence of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and antimicrobial consumption within
hospitals and in the community as observed over 13 years in a Swiss region with stable
population structure and detailed in- and out-patients records.
Methods:
The ANRESIS database and the modelled population
Antibiotic resistance and antimicrobial consumption data were obtained from the Swiss
Centre for Antibiotic Resistance database (ANRESIS), which has been previously described
in detail (16). In brief, ANRESIS prospectively collects routine and patient-specific antibiotic
resistance data representing around 80% of annual hospitalization days across Switzerland
(17). Most laboratories gather data from multiple hospitals, ranging from primary- to
tertiary-care institutions and from the community (general practitioners). The model
developed for this study used data from the Swiss Canton of Valais. This canton is
geographically relatively isolated and has a population of approximately 350,000
inhabitants, which remained stable throughout the observed years (18). All 25 healthcare
institutions in the Valais participate in ANRESIS, with five public hospitals contributing most
of the data. Data have been collected since 2004 using standardized methodology (19).
Antimicrobial resistance: We used the outcomes of susceptibility tests to ceftriaxone as
surrogate for presence/absence of ESBL-production. We considered all clinical samples of
invasive (from a usually sterile site) and non-invasive K. pneumoniae, and assumed invasive

samples to represent clinically significant infections, and non-invasive samples to represent
non-clinically significant infections and/or colonization. Clinically significant infections were
assumed to lead to antimicrobial therapy. We included susceptibility data collected between
2004 and 2017. Estimations of prevalence excluded repeated tests with the same
ceftriaxone resistance results for the same patient within the same year.
Antimicrobial consumption: Outpatient data in 2017 include around 50% of all of
prescribed antibiotics as 56% (69/123) pharmacies in the region reported their data to
ANRESIS, runs assumed that it was also the case for the simulation period. Inpatient data
included data from all public hospitals. Inpatient antimicrobial consumption was imputed
for the smaller, private institutions on the basis of yearly bed-days and accordingly to the
consumption in the public hospitals. Data collection spanned between 2006 and 2015 for
inpatients and between 2013 and 2016 for outpatients. Consumption data was expressed in
defined daily doses (DDD) for the 5th level of hierarchy according to the WHOCC-ATC
classification (20) (for example: J01CA; Penicillins with extended spectrum).
The model considers three types of antimicrobial therapy termed regular, restricted and
neutral. Regular and restricted types represent no activity and activity against ESBLproducing pathogens, respectively. The neutral type represents antibiotics that neither
select for nor have a clinical relevant effect on ESBL-producing pathogens, or the effect on
ESBL producing pathogens is disputed, such as penicillin/betalactame inhibitor
combinations (21-23). Supplementary Table S1 shows all categories in each group.
Mathematical model structure
We developed a mathematical model simulating the spread of colonization with ESBLproducing K. pneumoniae under the pressure of antimicrobial consumption in two settings,
represented by two interconnected models: the hospitals and the community. Figure 1
summarizes this model structure. Model parameters were set to reflect interactions

between settings, and their specific transmission dynamics. Table 1 shows all model
parameters. The model assumes that a dynamic fraction of the population is hospitalized,
and captures admissions in hospitals and discharges back to the community by means of
hospitalization and discharge rates. Overall rates of antimicrobial consumption are assumed
to indicate a response to likely bacterial infections (24). Rates of admission, discharge and
antimicrobial consumption were set to reflect data from the Valais region recorded by
ANRESIS.

Local transmission: Simulated persons hold a colonization status with ESBL-producing K.
pneumoniae (colonized vs. non-colonized; compartments labelled S and r, respectively in
Figure 1). In the model, the result of local transmission events (e.g. ‚Äúperson-to-person‚Äù) is
colonization with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. Transmission can occur in hospitals and
in the community i.e., interactions between non-hospitalized persons. The model considers
setting-specific transmission rates of the pathogen.

External force of colonization: This parameter aims to capture colonization through food
products (25-27) and from travellers returning from high-prevalence regions (28-30). The
model represents these processes through a ‚Äúforce of colonization‚Äù, independent of the
prevalence within the modelled population. To reflect the increasing number of people
travelling to high-prevalence regions, the external force of colonization ùúÄ(ùë°) was assumed to
increase at a constant speed from the year 2000 onwards. To facilitate interpretation of this
parameter, we use a more familiar measure, derived from this rate in the results, which we
termed ‚Äúexternal force of colonization equivalent‚Äù. The external force of colonization
equivalent was estimated based on the goodness of fit of the mathematical model and
labelled Œµ*. It approximates the proportion of prevalence observed until 2017 attributable to

), were P is the prevalence measured in 2017 in the

community setting).
Effect of antimicrobial therapy on transmission: The model considered two levels of
susceptibility and infectiousness with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae: normal and amplified
(Figure 1, table 1). Persons with amplified susceptibility (compartment ùëÜùëé in Figure 1)
were more likely to become colonized than those with normal susceptibility (compartment
ùëÜùëõ ). An amplified susceptibility status was attained trough antimicrobial treatment.
ùëò
Analogously, persons with amplified infectiousness (compartments ùëü1,ùëé
) were more likely to

transmit ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae to others. Amplified infectiousness occurred as a
result of inadequate antimicrobial treatment. In the model, when a patient colonized with
ceftriaxone-resistant K. pneumoniae was erroneously treated with regular antimicrobials for
an infection caused by this pathogen, such treatment failed and was followed by treatment
with restricted antibiotics.
Model calibration and the role of external force of colonization
We estimated transmission rates for the hospital and community settings by fitting the
model to reproduce the data on K. pneumoniae ceftriaxone susceptibility in both settings
simultaneously. We also iteratively fitted and simulated transmission by assuming external
rates of colonization equivalent Œµ* varying between 0% and 45% in steps of 15%. In an
independent analysis, we also estimated the external force of colonization resulting in the
best model fit. Model fits were attained by minimizing the sums of squared differences
between model outputs and data points weighted to reflect measurement errors in the data.
The model was normalized to a constant population of 100,000 inhabitants.

We considered public health interventions and changes in clinical routine that would derive
in different scenarios of antimicrobial consumption and in hospital transmission. Changes in
these variables were modelled as exponential increases and declines, at rates set to reach
target levels in 2025.
Modelled scenarios of antimicrobial consumption: For model projections, we considered
hypothetical scenarios of change in: 1) overall consumption of antimicrobials, and 2)
consumption of a restricted group of antimicrobials (carbapenems). Antimicrobial
consumption was assumed to remain stable at current levels or to reach increases and
decreases of 10%, 25% and 50% by 2025.
Scenarios of in-hospital transmission: We considered hypothetical scenarios where inhospital transmission remained stable at current levels or reached increases and decreases
of 10%, 25% and 50% by 2025.
Sensitivity analyses on model projections: Because there are no reliable estimates for
infectiousness amplification caused by antimicrobial consumption, we assessed the effect on
our projections of a range of values for this parameter.
All algorithms, including data processing, statistical analyses, solutions of differential
equations, optimizations utilized in model fitting procedures, sensitivity and uncertainty
analyses were implemented in R version 3.4.2 (31). In particular, the packages deSolve (32),
optim (33) and FME (34) were functional to the outcomes reported in this study.

Results
Model calibration included data from susceptibility tests performed in 15,137 inpatients and
16,050 outpatients. Observed prevalence of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae varied from
1.4% (95% CI: 0.4 ‚Äì 3.7%) in 2005 to 10.4% (5.0 ‚Äì 19.2%) in 2017 in the hospitals setting,
and from 2.7% (0.7 ‚Äì 7%) in 2007 to 2.4% (1.0 ‚Äì 4.9%) in 2016 in the community setting.
Consumption of all types of antimicrobials have increased in hospitals, reaching 55,747,
7,694 and 66,177 defined daily doses (DDD) for the regular, restricted and neutral types in
2015, respectively. Conversely, in the community, the use of regular and neutral
antimicrobials changed only slightly over time, reaching 245,628 and 521,243 DDD in 2016
respectively, while consumptions of antimicrobials of the restricted type increased by 50%
with respect to 2013, reaching 1,150 DDD in the year 2015.
Model calibration: Figure 2 shows observed and modelled prevalence of ESBL-producing
K. pneumoniae, and Table 1 the values for the fitted parameters. Estimated transmission
rate in the hospital setting was 15-fold larger than that in the community setting. Fitted
external force of colonization equivalent was 45.5 (95% CI: 12.1-95.7%). Modelled
prevalence between 2005 and mid-2017 varied from 0.7% (95% CI: 0.4%-1.5%) to 5.8%
(5.3%-9.4%) and from 0.3% (0.1%-0.5%) to 2.8% (2.2%-4.7%) in the hospital and
community settings, respectively.
The prevalence data point for 2006 in hospitals (Figure 2) corresponds to an atypical jump
in prevalence. The circumstances that led to this measurement were unfortunately not
documented. We included this point and its corresponding uncertainty without any
additional penalty.

Effect of the external force of colonization on prevalence: Figure 2 also shows the effect
of this parameter on model projections. Increasing values for the external force of
colonization resulted in lower, stabilizing future prevalence in hospitals. Maximum

projected prevalence in hospitals by 2025, obtained by assuming null external force of
colonization equivalent, was 7.6% (95% CI: 2.6%-14.1%). Maximum projected prevalence in
the community was 2.7% (1.1%-5.4%), with little variation between scenarios of no null
external force of colonization. These simulations assumed that antimicrobial consumption
and transmission rates remained constant since 2018.
Model projections on the impact of public health interventions between 2019 and
2025
Simulations assuming changes in overall antimicrobial consumption resulted in the largest
changes in projected prevalence. Projected prevalence changed less in simulations
considering changes only in carbapenem consumption than in simulations assuming
changes in in-hospital transmission rates (Figure 3).
Scenarios of antimicrobial consumption
Changes in overall antimicrobial consumption (Figure 3A): Stable antimicrobial
consumption led to almost unchanged prevalence between 2019 and 2025 in both settings.
By contrast, future prevalence varied considerably across other scenarios of antimicrobial
consumption, with more antimicrobials leading to rapidly increasing future prevalence. A
50% increase in antimicrobial consumption was projected to lead to prevalence of 58.3%
(95% CI: 53.6%-64.7%) (10-fold increase from 5.6% (5.1%-9.5%) in 2019) in hospitals and
36.0% (29.2%-43.2%) in the community (13-fold increase from 2.8% (2.2%-5.0%)) by 2025
(Figure 3A). Analogously, although at a much lower speed, reductions in antimicrobial
consumption led to declining prevalence. A 50% reduction in antimicrobial consumption led
to a prevalence of 0.6% (0.4%-1.1%; 89% reduction) in hospitals and of 0.4% (0.3%-0.8%)
(84% reduction) in the community by 2025. Figure S1 shows simulated changes in
prevalence by 2025 with respect to 2019 across scenarios of overall antimicrobial
consumption.

Changes in carbapenem-class antimicrobial consumption (Figure 3B): These
simulations, which only varied consumption of carbapenem-class antimicrobials, resulted in
changes in prevalence considerably smaller than those reported above did. When
carbapenem consumption was set to increase by 50%, projected prevalence was 6.4% (95%
CI: 5.9%-11.0%) (13% increase) in hospitals and 3.0% (2.4%-5.2%) (9% increase) in the
community. When carbapenem consumption was set to decline by 50%, prevalence declined
by less than 9% in both settings (Figure S2A).
Scenarios of in-hospital transmission (Figure 3C): Prevalence in 2025 almost doubled
(5.6%; 95% CI: 5.1%-9.5%) to 10.2% (8.1%-18.4%) in the hospital setting and increased by
9% in the community when we assumed a 50% increase in in-hospital transmission rate by
2025. When in-hospital transmission rate was set to decline by 50%, prevalence dropped by
43% in hospitals and by 13% in the community (Figure S2B).

Sensitivity analyses on the infectiousness amplification mediated by antimicrobials
The results of these sensitivity analyses were similar to those of the main analysis. Figures
S3-6 are analogous to Figures 2, 3 and S2 when assuming no amplification (ùúàùëñ = 1 versus ùúàùëñ
= 2 in the main analysis) and higher amplification (ùúàùëñ = 3) of infectiousness after
antimicrobial treatment with a regular agent. Prevalence projected in scenarios without
amplification of infectiousness was higher and less sensitive to antimicrobial consumption
than that projected in scenarios assuming higher amplification of infectiousness.

Discussion
We developed a mathematical model that reconstructed the observed course of colonization
with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae between 2005 and 2017. This model enabled us to

assess the potential impact of changes in clinical practice, including those mimicking public
health interventions on the future prevalence of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. The
simulations suggested that with stable rates of antimicrobial consumption and in-hospital
transmission, prevalence would stabilize in the near future, as it has been suggested by
former studies (35). Expected future prevalence depended on the assumed contribution of
non-local transmission (i.e., thought external forces of colonization) during the calibration
period. Increasing values for the contribution of non-local transmission imply less local
transmission, and led the model to project lower future prevalence in hospitals. This result
highlights the urgency to slow down transmission at the local level. Simulated future
scenarios showed that the most powerful driver of prevalence will be overall antimicrobial
consumption, followed by in-hospital transmission rates. The influence of carbapenem
consumption on prevalence stood evidently behind these two across simulations.

In line with published data (36), our model fits estimated transmission rates much higher
within hospitals than in the community (15-fold). The best fit also suggested that as much as
46% of the prevalence of colonization measured until 2017 could be attributable to sources
external to the modelled population, but uncertainty remained too wide to claim a finding.
Data from a recent longitudinal study from the Netherlands suggested a 43% prevalence of
ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae among people who recently travelled to
high-prevalence regions. In the same study, these travellers accounted for 18% of all cases
of colonization with these pathogens (37). Another study that screened retail raw vegetables
in Amsterdam found ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in 6% of screened samples (38).
These findings suggest that in low prevalence settings, an important share of colonizations
with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae could not be prevented by means of local public
health interventions. Nevertheless, our model projections showed how three different
interventions at the local level could influence the future prevalence of colonization with

ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. For example, while an increase of only 10% in overall
antimicrobial consumption may quickly trigger escalation of colonization, an equivalent
reduction may lead to a sharp decrease in its prevalence.
Carbapenem prescriptions are currently intentionally restricted in routine clinical practice
(39, 40). In contrast, our model suggests that further reductions in consumption of the

carbapenem-class alone would have a modest effect on the prevalence of ESBL-producing K.
pneumoniae. Of note, mathematical models of pathogen transmission and at healthcare
facility levels have investigated the role of antibiotic restriction and sequential treatment
with different types of antimicrobials. Their results counterintuitively suggest that antibiotic
restriction may promote resistance instead of hindering it (11, 12). The model was
originally formulated to also model resistance to carbapenems. However, the setting we
modelled did not have reported cases of carbapenem resistance over the study period. Our
study could therefore not model the effects of increase carbapenem consumption on
carbapenem resistance. This could limit the potential for generalization of our results to
settings with prevalent carbapenemase resistance.

In line with former studies, the model was more sensitive to transmission rates than it was
to single antibiotic class restrictions (carbapenem class in our study) (13). Simulations
projected that eventual increases in in-hospital transmission rates could lead to
considerable rises in prevalence in this setting. Reduced in-hospital transmission was
effective at reducing prevalence within hospitals, but its effect on the community setting
was relatively modest.

Although our findings remained qualitatively unchanged when confronted with different
assumptions regarding increases in infectiousness of a resistant bacteria associated with
antimicrobial therapy, the generalized lack of estimates for this parameter in the literature
may limit the scope of the values we projected for future prevalence. The sensitivity
analyses showed that not only did this parameter, which reflects antimicrobial selection
pressure, largely determined the magnitude of the impact of antimicrobial consumption on

prevalence; it was also decisive for the values of future prevalence, even in the absence of
changes in antimicrobial consumption. Our study therefore suggests that precise estimates
of future prevalence would require risk factors research aimed at estimating this
parameter.

We used the outcomes of susceptibility tests to ceftriaxone as a surrogate for
presence/absence of ESBL-production. However, these tests are imperfect surrogate
markers for the occurrence of ESBL resistances, as other mechanism may also contribute to
non-susceptibility.
Upon re-parameterization, adapting this model to other resistant pathogens with analogous
transmission routes, such as ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, should be straightforward.

The model was set to reproduce internally consistent time trends on outcomes of resistance
tests, antimicrobial consumption, hospitalization and discharge rates, systematically
collected. The implications of our findings regarding the comparative ability of different
public health interventions to fight the spread of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae are
therefore likely to hold true for other regions, even those with higher resistance levels.

Implications of findings
These results can help inform public policy on strategies to mitigate the spread of resistant
bacteria. Expectations regarding the impact of local interventions may need adjustment to
account for constrains derived from potentially high contributions of non-local
transmission.
This study suggests that interventions including local or national antimicrobial stewardship
programs might be most effective if they aim at reducing overall antimicrobial consumption.
Further restricting antimicrobials of the carbapenem class is unlikely to noticeably decrease

future prevalence of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. Therefore, in regions with very low
prevalence of carbapenem-resistant pathogens, additional restrictions of carbapenem must
be carefully weighed against potential detrimental effects of an initially inappropriate
antimicrobial therapy.

Conclusion
The outcomes of our simulations suggest that public health interventions reducing overall
antimicrobial consumption would be considerably more powerful at reducing the
prevalence of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae than those reducing in-hospital transmissions,
or further restricting carbapenem class antimicrobial consumption.

Figure 1. Simplified model structure
The model considers community and hospital settings interconnected by hospitalizations and dismissals. Transmission within each setting is
simulated by means of a core model with setting specific parameters. In the core model (right black box), uncolonized individuals can have
¬´normal¬ª (ùë∫ùíè ) and ¬´amplified¬ª (ùë∫ùíÇ ) susceptibility to colonization, reflecting increased risk of colonization associated with antimicrobial therapy
(dark, orange arrows). Colonization with ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (red arrows) can occur through human-to-human contact
locally (within hospitals and the community) and through external sources (e.g. traveling to high-prevalence areas and contaminated food).
Colonized individuals are classified into two levels according to their ability to transmit the resistant pathogen: ¬´normal¬ª infectiousness (ùíìùüè,ùíè)
and ¬´amplified¬ª infectiousness (ùíìùíåùüè,ùíÇ ) (dark orange arrows). The model explicitly accounts for infections caused by K. pneumoniae ESBL with
inadequate antimicrobial treatment (ùëò = 1, otherwise ùëò = 0).

Figure 2. Measured prevalence, model fit and projections of colonization with ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae for a range of
external forces of colonization
Data from ANRESIS (grey dots and error bars with 95% confidence intervals)
Projected future incidence in hospitals decreased monotonously with increasing external force of colonization.
*The external force of colonization equivalent is a proxy for the fraction of observed prevalence by 2017 attributable to external sources.

Figure 3. Projections of colonization with ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae for representative scenarios/strategies
Scenarios included changing: antimicrobial consumption (panels A and B), and in-hospital transmission rate (panel C).
In Panel A scenarios of antimicrobial consumption included changes in all types of antimicrobials, while in panel B they included only antibiotics
of the carbapenem class.
