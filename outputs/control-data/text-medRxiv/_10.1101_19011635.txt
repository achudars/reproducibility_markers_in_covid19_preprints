ABSTRACT

2
3

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a recommended treatment for recurrent

4

Clostridioides difficile infection, and there is promise that FMT may be effective for

5

conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Previous FMT clinical trials have

6

considered the possibility of a “donor effect”, that is, that FMT material from different

7

donors has different clinical efficacies. Here we lay out rigorous statistical methodology

8

for detecting donor effects, finding that reliable detection of a donor effect requires trials

9

with more than 200 FMT-treated patients. A re-evaluation of previous FMT clinical trials

10

for IBD showed that while there is very little evidence for a non-zero donor effect, the

11

existing data are also not inconsistent with substantial donor effects. Large-scale meta-

12

analysis, combined with careful reporting from clinical trials, will be crucial in

13

determining if donor effects are clinically relevant for IBD.

INTRODUCTION

16
17

The human microbiome is increasingly understood to play a key role in health and

18

disease.1 Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), the infusion of a healthy person’s

19

stool into a patient, is one method for manipulating the gut microbiome. FMT is

20

recommended for treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection.2,3 Although the

21

specific mechanisms by which FMT cures C. difficile infection are not well understood,

22

FMT is being investigated as a therapy for dozens of other microbiome-related

23

indications.1

24
25

A key challenge in identifying FMT’s specific mechanism, or mechanisms, is the

26

complexity and diversity of human stool, a mixture of bacteria, viruses, fungi, microbe-

27

derived molecules, and host-derived molecules which varies enormously from person to

28

person.4,5 It has therefore been hypothesized that different stools, stool donors, or

29

matches of donors and recipients could have different abilities to treat disease. This

30

concept has been referred to with terms like “donor effect”, “super-donor”, and “super-

31

stool”.6–9

32
33

If FMT’s efficacy varied widely across donors, then rational, a priori selection of stool

34

donors based on biomarkers that predict their donated FMT material’s efficacy could

35

improve the clinical practice of FMT.10,11 Differences in FMT efficacy between stool

36

donors or specific stool samples could be also an important starting point for scientific

37

investigations into the “active ingredient” in FMT donations.6 It is therefore important to

38

quantify the extent of donor variability in indications where FMT is a promising

39

treatment.

40
41

There are no reports of a donor effect in the context of C. difficile infection, the condition

42

for which the use of FMT is best studied.12 However, multiple studies, mostly for

43

ulcerative colitis, a kind of inflammatory bowel disease, have tested for donor

44

effects.8,9,13–20 In all of these studies, identifying a donor effect was a post hoc analysis,

45

and in no case was multiple hypothesis correction, a critical methodology in post hoc

46

analyses, employed. As we show herein, in at least two previous reports the specifics of

47

the clinical design require adjustments to the statistical tests used, such that those

48

reports inflated the apparent evidence for a donor effect.13,14

49
50

Furthermore, previous reports mostly analyzed donor effects with respect to the null

51

hypotheses that all donors produce stool with equal clinical efficacy, or that particular

52

features of stool, like its bacterial community diversity, are unrelated to clinical efficacy.

53

We propose that, rather than merely asking if donor effects exist or not, we should ask

54

about the size of the donor effect, whether it is clinically relevant, and whether it is large

55

enough to be detected in the studies that are testing for it. It is inconceivable that all

56

stool has precisely the same therapeutic effect. If 2 donors are each used to treat

57

enough patients, the difference between their treatment efficacies would almost

58

certainly become statistically significant. However, without quantifying the donor effect,

59

it is difficult to determine if the effect is clinically relevant or to determine how many

60

patients would be required to power a clinical trial to reliably detect a donor effect.

61
62

Here we re-evaluate the existing evidence for donor effects and evaluate the

63

implications of that evidence for experimental design and clinical practice. First, we lay

64

out easy-to-implement but statistically rigorous methods for evaluating the donor effect

65

in post hoc analyses. Second, we use these methods to estimate the statistical power of

66

FMT clinical trials to detect donor effects. Finally, we apply these statistical methods to

67

the existing literature.

METHODS

71
72

Distinguishing types of stool superiority

73

Discussions of “super-donors” and “super-stool” have suggested that stool might be

74

superior in at least 4 distinct but conceptually related senses. To avoid confusion in our

75

re-evaluation of the evidence for donor effects, we distinguish between these definitions

76

of stool superiority:

77
78

1. Donor superiority, in which particular donors are associated with better clinical

79

outcomes for the recipient patients. For example, Moayyedi et al.13 tested

80

whether a particular donor (“donor B”) was associated with better patient

81

outcomes, compared to the other donors.

82
83

2. Donor characteristic superiority, in which a donors with some particular
characteristic are associated with better outcomes. For example, donor age, diet,

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19011635; this version posted November 12, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

84

and host genetics have been suggested as potential factors in donor

85

superiority.8,16,21

86

3. Donation superiority, in which donations with some particular characteristic are

87

associated with better outcomes. For example, Vermeire et al.22 tested whether

88

stools with higher bacterial diversity are associated with better outcomes.

89

4. Donor-recipient match superiority, in which certain combinations of donor and

90

recipient are associated with better outcomes,8,9,20,23,24 analogous to how donors’

91

and recipients’ blood types are matched for blood transfusions. FMT studies

92

have tested whether stool from “related” donors,25 typically defined as first-

93

degree relatives but also sometimes including spouses or partners, is associated

94

with better patient outcomes.

95
96

These types of superiority are conceptually related and not mutually exclusive. For

97

example, imagine it were the case that female donors were associated with better

98

patient outcomes than male donors, making a case for “donor characteristic superiority”.

99

However, because donors have a clinical effect on the patient only via their donation,

100

sex of donor cannot be the molecular mechanism by which some donations are more

101

efficacious than others. It would have to be that sex determined or correlated with some

102

component of the stool that made those donations more effective. In other words, there

103

must be an underlying “donation characteristic superiority” that correlates with donor

104

sex. Thus, even if donor-recipient match superiority might be the most accurate model,

105

simpler types of superiority may be parsimonious.7

107

When pools of stool from multiple donors are used for FMT, it is typical to test for donor

108

superiority (i.e., if the pools that include material from a particular donor are associated

109

with better patient outcomes)15 and pool characteristic superiority (e.g., if pools with

110

higher bacterial α-diversity are associated with better patient outcomes).17 One could

111

also test if particular pools are associated with better patient outcomes.

112
113
114

Model of donor effects and quantification of donor effect size

115

To quantify the size of the donor effect, we modeled each donor as having a unique

116

treatment efficacy, that is, the proportion of patients that would reach a positive clinical

117

endpoint in a very large clinical trial. The donors’ treatment efficacies are drawn from a

118

distribution. Specifically, the log odds of the donors’ treatment efficacies are normally

119

distributed. We used this model of distribution in donor efficacies because it

120

corresponds to the distribution of a random effect in a logistic regression, which can be

121

fit to data using well-established statistical methods.26

122
123

Under this model, the size of the donor effect is related to the “width” of this distribution.

124

If the donor effect is strong, the difference in treatment efficacies between donors tends

125

to be large. We defined the effect size as the median difference in treatment efficacy

126

between two randomly selected donors (see Supplemental Methods). For example, say

127

the effect size is a median difference of 10 percentage points, and the mean treatment

128

efficacy across donors is 50%. Then it would not be unusual if two donors selected at

129

random had efficacies of 45% and 55%.

130
131

Statistical power computations

132

We performed statistical power computations to estimate what donor effect size can be

133

reliably detected in an FMT clinical trial for IBD. At a range of effect sizes, statistical

134

power was estimated as the proportion of 1,000 simulated clinical trials with p < 0.05.

135

For each simulated clinical trial:

136
137

1. Efficacies for donors (2, 3, 6, or 12 donors) were randomly drawn from a

138

distribution of log odds. The mean of the distribution of log odds was selected

139

based on typical FMT efficacy rates (30%).9,13,15,27 The effect size determines the

140

standard deviation.

141
142

2. Patients treated with FMT (12, 24, 48, 96, or 192 patients) were distributed
evenly among the donors.

143

3. Patients’ outcomes for patients were simulated based on their donors’ efficacies.

144

4. A statistical test (Fisher-Freeman-Halton test, see below) was run, and the p-

145

value noted.

146
147

If the simulated power for any effect size reached 80%, we found the effect size

148

corresponding to 80% power by linear interpolation.

149
150

10 effect sizes were evaluated, ranging from approximately zero (10-6 standard

151

deviation in log odds) to the difference in log odds between the typical FMT efficacy rate

152

and typical placebo rate for a clinical indication. This design sets the upper limit on

153

donor efficacies such that, at most, those donors 1 standard deviation below the mean

154

(i.e., ~16% of all donors) have efficacies worse than typical placebo rates (5%).

155
156

Studies re-analyzed

157

We analyzed a set of studies from recent FMT clinical study literature that tested for the

158

hypothesis that one donor or donation characteristic was associated with improved

159

patient outcomes (Results). To simplify the analyses, we considered only a single

160

dichotomous outcome, whether a patient achieved the trial’s primary clinical endpoint.

161

We also restricted microbiome analyses to consider only the bacterial α-diversity of

162

stool, as associations between donor material α-diversity and patient outcomes have

163

been investigated in multiple studies,14,16,22 and the hypothesis that improved bacterial

164

diversity in stool is part of the motivation for using pools of stool from multiple donors in

165

FMT.15,23,27

166
167

Statistical methodology

168

Statistics were computed using the R programming language (version 3.6.0).28 To test

169

the hypothesis that there is any difference in efficacy between donors (or pools of

170

donors), we used the Fisher-Freeman-Halton test (function fisher.test) on 2 × D

171

contingency tables, where D is the number of donors (or pools). In cases when the

172

Fisher-Freeman-Halton test is computationally infeasible, we use the χ2 test (function

173

chisq.test). For 2 × 2 contingency tables (e.g., to test if one donor has a different

174

treatment efficacy than all the others), we used Fisher’s exact test (function exact2x2)29

175

and the mid-p value to prevent the tests from being overly conservative.30 We used

176

logistic regressions (function glm) to test for donation/pool characteristic superiority. We

177

used random effects logistic regressions (function glmer from the lme4 package)26 to

178

estimate the strength of the donor effect.

179
180

Microbiome analysis

181

We re-analyzed raw 16S rRNA sequencing data from three studies (Kump et al., study

182

accession PRJEB11841; Jacob et al., accession PRJNA388210; Goyal et al., accession

183

PRJNA380944) using QIIME 231 (version 2019.7) and Deblur.32 Paired reads were

184

joined (vsearch plugin, default parameters), quality filtered (quality-filter plugin, default

185

parameters), and denoised using Deblur (trim length 253 nucleotides, 1 minimum reads,

186

otherwise default parameters). To follow Kump et al.’s general analysis method, each

187

sample in the resulting table of amplicon sequence variants was downsampled to the

188

minimum number of ASV counts across samples. Bacterial α-diversity was computed as

189

richness, the number of unique ASVs present in each sample. For Goyal et al., the

190

sequencing data was single-ended, so reads were not paired for that study. When a

191

donor had multiple samples, we associated a single α-diversity with each donor by

192

computing the average number of ASVs over that donor’s samples.

RESULTS

200
201

Statistical power of FMT clinical trials for IBD to detect a donor effect

202

Using simulations, we estimated the minimal strength of the donor effect required for an

203

FMT clinical trial for IBD to reach 80% statistical power in detecting a donor effect with a

204

Fisher-Freeman-Halton test (Figure 1). Trials’ ability to reliably detect a donor effect

205

increased with the strength of the donor effect, the number of patients, and the number

206

of donors in the trial. More patients and donors allowed for reliable detection of weaker

207

donor effects.

208
209

For trials with 24 patients and any number of donors, the strength of the donor effect

210

required for reliable detection of that effect was implausibly large: it would require that a

211

substantial fraction of donors caused their patients to perform worse than placebo (see

212

Methods). Similarly, studies with 2 donors and 192 or fewer patients were also unable to

213

detect plausible donor effects. Trials with 96 patients were able to reliably detect a

214

donor effect when the median difference in treatment efficacy between randomly

215

selected donors was 20 percentage points or more. In other words, the donor effect

216

must be strong enough that, in a typical pair of donors, one might have a clinical

217

efficacy of 20% and the other 40%. Even with 384 patients in a trial, the donor effect

218

would need to be large enough that the median difference in clinical efficacy between

219

randomly selected donors was more than 10 percentage points.

220
221

Re-evaluations of the evidence for a donor effect in IBD

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19011635; this version posted November 12, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

222

The results of the statistical power computations above suggest that previous studies of

223

FMT for IBD are unlikely to have detected a donor effect. We therefore re-evaluated the

224

evidence for a donor effect in IBD from a selection of FMT clinical studies (Table 1).

225
226

Rossen et al. 2015

227

In this study,9 23 ulcerative colitis patients were treated with FMT. 17 patients received

228

stool from 1 of 15 donors; 6 patients received stool from 2 different donors. In the

229

original publication, the investigators report on the performance of 3 donors (Table 2).

230

There was no evidence of a donor effect (mid-p > 0.05, Fisher’s exact test) for any of

231

the 3 donors. However, the study is small enough that the data are not inconsistent with

232

large variability between donors. For example, the upper 95% confidence interval on

233

donor A’s odds ratio of successful patient outcome compared to all other donors is 29.

234

In other words, the data do not provide evidence of a donor effect, but they also cannot

235

definitively rule out a strong donor effect.

236
237

Moayyedi et al. 2015

238

In this study,13 38 ulcerative colitis patients were treated with FMT. Each patient was

239

treated with stool from 1 of 6 donors. Donors were used according to an adaptive

240

process, described in the original publication. Briefly, at the start of the trial, patients

241

were treated with stool from one of two donors (A or B). Material from donor B then

242

became unavailable, and patients were instead treated with stool from donor A or 1 of 4

243

other donors (C, D, E, and F). At this point, donor B became available again, and “[t]he

244

remaining participants allocated to active therapy all received FMT from donor B

245

exclusively, as [the investigators] had not experienced any success with donor A”. In the

246

original study, donor B’s performance (7 of 18 treated patients achieved the primary

247

endpoint) was compared against all other donors (2 of 20 patients; odds ratio 5.5 [95%

248

CI 1.0 to 44], mid-p = 0.048, Fisher’s exact test).

249
250

In general, adaptive trial designs require special statistical methodologies.33 However,

251

we were aware of no statistical methodologies designed to account for an adaptive

252

design like the one used in this trial. To investigate whether typical statistical tests like

253

Fisher’s exact test or a χ2 test accurately measure the statistical significance of the

254

collected data, we simulated a simplified adaptive donor selection process. Among the

255

first 24 patients, use all 6 donors 4 times each. Then exclusively use the best-

256

performing donor for the remaining 14 patients. Finally, compare the overall

257

performance of this donor against all the others. In these simulations, if all the donors

258

are the same, the probability of finding mid-p < 0.05 is approximately 9%, greater than

259

that 5% that would be expected if the test were accurate for that type of data

260

(Supplemental Results). The intuitive explanation is that, if all donors are the same, the

261

selection process is merely setting aside donors who had “bad luck” on their first

262

patients, and they are not allowed to recover their performance with a run of “good luck”

263

later on. This is not a flaw of Fisher’s exact test. Instead, it is problem of applying a

264

statistical test to data that do not meet the assumptions of the test.

265
266

Although the adaptive procedure that led to extensive use of donor B may have

267

improved the probability of the trial’s success,7 the procedure was not pre-specified,

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19011635; this version posted November 12, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

268

making it impossible to rigorously determine the degree to which the observed results

269

are consistent with all donors being identical, that is, whether donor B simply had a

270

“lucky” initial run. Thus, the value mid-p ≈ 0.05 reported above is inaccurately optimistic,

271

and a value closer to 0.09 is a better representation of the likelihood of a donor having

272

the kind of success observed in this trial.

273
274

Paramsothy et al. 2017

275

In this study,15 41 ulcerative colitis patients were randomized to receive FMT, and

276

another 37 were randomized to placebo and later received FMT. Each patient received

277

FMT from 1 of 21 pools of donors. Each pool included 3 to 7 donors, out of 13 total

278

donors.

279
280

The original publication compared the best performing individual donor against all the

281

others (14 of 38 patients achieved the primary outcome, versus 7 of 40 assigned to

282

other donors; odds ratio 2.7 [95% CI 0.96 to 8.2], mid-p = 0.06, Fisher’s exact test). This

283

result, although near mid-p = 0.05, was not subjected to multiple hypothesis correction,

284

as there are 13 relevant hypotheses to be tested, one per donor. In terms of pools of

285

donors, there was also no evidence that any particular pool was associated with better

286

outcomes (p = 0.57, Fisher-Freeman-Halton test on 2 × 21 table of patient outcomes by

287

pool).

288
289

To develop an estimate of the strength of the donor effect, we used a logistic

290

regression, modeling the pool as a random effect. This model estimated that the median

291

difference between the efficacy of two randomly selected pools is 0 percentage points

292

(95% CI 0 to 20 percentage points). In other words, the regression’s best estimate of

293

the variation in efficacy among pools is zero, even without applying any penalizations

294

for model complexity. Thus, similar to Rossen et al., the data do not provide evidence

295

for a donor effect, but they are also not inconsistent with a strong effect, since the upper

296

confidence limit on the strength of the donor effect is 20 percentage points.

297
298

Costello et al. 2019

299

In this study,27 38 ulcerative colitis patients received FMT from 1 of 11 pools. Each pool

300

included stool from 3 or 4 donors, out of 19 total donors. Similar to Paramsothy et al.,

301

there was no evidence of heterogeneity in patient outcomes by donor pool (p = 0.50,

302

Fisher-Freeman-Halton test on 2 × 11 table) nor evidence of better outcomes for any

303

particular donor (mid-p > 0.05 for all donors, Fisher’s exact test). Furthermore, a logistic

304

In this study,17 20 ulcerative colitis patients received FMT from 1 of 6 pools. Each pool

309

included stool from 2 donors, out of 4 total donors. In this analysis, we analyzed only the

310

14 patients available for follow-up at 12 weeks, using remission at this timepoint as the

311

outcome. Similar to Paramsothy et al. and Costello et al., there was no evidence for

312

differences in patient outcomes by pool (Fisher-Freeman-Halton test on 2 × 4 table, p =

313

0.86) or by donor (mid-p > 0.05 for all 4 donors, Fisher’s exact test). A logistic

314

regression estimated the median difference in efficacy between two randomly selected

315

pools as zero (95% CI 0 to 31 percentage points).

316
317

The pools administered to 13 of the 14 patients were characterized using 16S rRNA

318

sequencing, allowing for an analysis of patient outcomes by bacterial characteristics of

319

the pools (Figure 2). However, there was no evidence for an association between

320

patient outcomes and the bacterial community α-diversity, measured as the number of

321

unique amplicon sequence variants (ASVs, i.e., denoised 100% OTUs), of the pool they

322

received (p = 0.18, Wilcoxon rank-sum test).

323
324

To develop confidence intervals around the strength of the donor effect, we fit a logistic

325

regression to the data, predicting patient outcomes from pool α-diversity. The model’s

326

point estimates for pool efficacy was 20% (95% CI 2% to 76%) for the pool with the

327

lowest α-diversity (239 ASVs) but 84% (95% CI 25% to 99%) for the pool with the

328

highest diversity (487 ASVs). In other words, the data do not provide statistically

329

significant evidence for an association between pool α-diversity and patient outcomes,

330

but they cannot definitively rule out the possibility of a wide variation in efficacy between

331

pools.

Meta-analysis of pool studies

Paramsothy et al., Costello et al., and Jacob et al. have sufficiently similar designs and

335

the available data to allow a meta-analysis. A logistic regression on the combined data

from all three studies, with the study as a fixed effect, estimated the median difference

337

in efficacy between two randomly selected pools as zero, with a smaller confidence

338

interval than for any individual study (95% CI 0 to 16 percentage points).

339
340

Goyal et al. 2018

341

In this study,16 21 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (any of Crohn’s disease,

342

ulcerative colitis, or indeterminate colitis) received FMT and were available for follow-up.

343

We used remission at 30 days as the outcome. Each patient received stool from 1

344

donor, precluding any test of donor superiority. However, 16S rRNA sequencing was

345

performed, allowing for an analysis of donation characteristic superiority, similar to

346

Jacob et al. above.

347
348

Similar to that study, there was no evidence for an association between patient

349

outcomes and the α-diversity (p = 0.3, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), but a logistic regression

350

estimated a potentially wide but statistically insignificant variation in donation efficacy

351

across the range of α-diversities among donors, predicting an efficacy of 38% (95% CI

352

8% to 82%) for the donor with the lowest α-diversity (386 ASVs) and an efficacy of 75%

353

(95% CI 26% to 96%) for the donor with the highest diversity (1072 ASVs). Again, there

354

was no statistically significant association between patient outcomes and donor stool

355

characteristics, but the data are not inconsistent with a wide variation.

360

3 patients. Like Jacob et al. and Goyal et al., this study tested whether increased α-

361

diversity was associated with improved patient outcomes.

362
363

In the original analysis, the 4 patients who did not respond clinically to FMT were

364

compared against the 4 patients who reached remission (Figure 2). 16S rRNA

365

sequencing data was available for 28 donations associated with those 8 patients.

366

Donors assigned to patients who received remission did not have statistically

367

significantly higher α-diversity than those assigned to patients who did not respond

368

(Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 0.3).

369
370

The original publication reported statistically significant differences between the α-

371

diversity of stool samples associated with remission (n = 16) compared to samples

372

associated with no response (n = 12; p = 0.11). Our analysis has a different conclusion,

373

finding no support for a donor effect, principally because we analyzed the data as only 8

374

independent data points (i.e., one for each patient), while Kump et al. analyzed the data

375

as if there were 28 independent data points (i.e., one for each donation that was

376

administered to a patient that also has associated microbiome data). Repeated

377

measurements of the material delivered to a patient do not constitute independent

378

measures of the patient’s outcome. In other words, when testing for an association

379

between patient outcomes and a donation characteristic like α-diversity, the weight of

380

the evidence is determined by the number of patient outcomes, not by the number of

381

microbiome measurements.

383

As an extreme example, consider a study with two donors and two patients: donor A is

384

used with a patient who achieves remission, while donor B is used with a patient who

385

has no response to FMT. If 100 microbiome samples were taken from each of donors A

386

and B, a difference between A’s and B’s samples could be found with great statistical

387

confidence. However, this does not translate into confidence in the relationship between

388

the microbiome and patient outcome.

389
390

Similar to the studies above, a logistic regression identified a potentially wide but not

391

statistically significant variation in donation efficacy across the range of α-diversities,

392

predicting an efficacy of 38% (95% CI 8% to 82%) for the donor with the lowest α-

393

diversity (386 ASVs) and an efficacy of 75% (95% CI 26% to 96%) for the donor with

394

the highest diversity (1072 ASVs).

396

Vermeire et al. 2016

397

In this study, 14 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (either of Crohn’s disease or

398

ulcerative colitis) received FMT, each from a different donor. The original study reported

399

that the bacterial α-diversity of donations varied by patient outcomes, that patients with

400

successful outcomes received more bacterially diverse donations (Wilcoxon rank-sum

401

test, p = 0.012). However, the underlying bacterial sequencing data was not available

402

for re-analysis.

405

In this study, 41 patients with ulcerative colitis received FMT, each from a different

406

donor. The original study found no difference in the α-diversity of the stool from 7

407

donors whose patients met the primary endpoint, compared to 19 donors whose

408

patients did not (p = 0.69). The study also tested whether the abundance of 10 taxa

409

were differentially abundant among those two groups of donors, finding p-values less

410

than 0.05 for 2 of 9 taxa, neither of which was significant after Benjamini-Hochberg

411

multiple hypothesis correction.34 The underlying bacterial sequencing data was not

DISCUSSION

416
417

In simulation of FMT clinical trials for IBD, we found that trials would need to be very

418

large, with more than 200 patients receiving FMT, to achieve 80% statistical power to

419

detect a modest donor effect (median 10 percentage point difference in efficacy

420

between two randomly selected donors). In other words, if the donor effect were only

421

strong enough that randomly selected pairs of donors had a 10 percentage point

422

difference in efficacy —say, one having a 30% efficacy and the other a 40% efficacy—

423

then no existing trial of FMT for IBD had a design that could reliably detect such an

424

effect.

425
426

Concluding that existing FMT studies for IBD were simply not powered to detect donor

427

effects, we re-evaluated reports from those studies, finding no statistically rigorous

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19011635; this version posted November 12, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

428

evidence for the superiority of particular donors and only very weak evidence for

429

variation in FMT’s efficacy based on the α-diversity of the FMT material (specifically, a

430

single result from Vermeire et al.). In most cases, the statistical best estimate for the

431

strength of the donor effect is exactly zero. However, the small size of these studies

432

relative to the number of patients required to reliably detect a plausible donor effect also

433

means that the data cannot definitively rule out a large donor effect, as much as 20 or

434

30 percentage points between randomly selected donors. It therefore remains

435

undetermined if differences between donors are clinically relevant to FMT for IBD.

436
437

These sobering results are subject to multiple limitations. First, we measured the

438

associations between very simple measures. We considered only dichotomous patient

439

outcomes and the relatively simple microbiological characteristic of bacterial α-diversity

440

as determined by 16S rRNA taxonomic marker gene sequencing. Reliably detecting

441

donor effects may require more sophisticated methods. For example, Jacob et al. report

442

that donors’ bacterial compositions meaningfully differed with respect to patient

443

outcomes (Figure 4C in that publication, PERMANOVA, p = 0.044). More proximal and

444

fine-grained measurements of patients’ response to FMT may also provide more

445

sensitivity for detecting differences in donor efficacies. Dichotomous primary endpoints

446

and ordinal changes in patients’ Mayo scores are subject to enormous sources of

447

variance in the patient’s biology and disease history that may be hiding the more subtle

448

effects of differences between donors.

449

450

Second, we modeled the distribution of donors and pool efficacies as Gaussian in log

451

odds space. This approach allowed us to use mixed model logistic regression, a well-

452

established statistical procedure, to estimate the variance in donors’ efficacies, but it is

453

not an intuitive measure of variation. Furthermore, this model of donor variability does

454

not require that all donors’ efficacies be higher than the placebo rate. A model of donor

455

variability that does sensibly account for placebo rates was previously used in a study of

456

FMT clinical trial design,7 but that model would require adaptation to make it suitable for

457

statistical inference.

458
459

In light of the number of patients required for a well-powered test for a donor effect, we

460

propose that an important path is meta-analysis across clinical trials, compiling

461

characterizations of donors’ and patients’ microbiomes and host factors, linked with

462

patient outcomes.6 This approach will present difficult technical challenges, as data from

463

multiple studies be carefully collected, cleaned, and analyzed to make the analytical

464

results valid across those studies.35 However, liberal sharing of clinical metadata and

465

microbiome data, including careful reporting of donor and donation characteristics, will

466

more easily enable inference across studies, and may provide the best direction forward

467

to characterizing the donor effect for FMT in IBD.

Figure 1: Statistical power calculations showing detectable effect sizes for varying trial

designs. In simulated clinical trials, a number of patients (vertical axis) are evenly

584

allotted to a number of donors (horizontal axis). Each tile’s color and number show the

585

minimum effect size (median difference in efficacy, measured in percentage points,

586

between two randomly selected donors) required for the trial design to reach 80%

587

statistical power. Gray tiles show that 80% statistical power cannot be achieved for

588

plausible donor variations (i.e., for which most donors perform at least as well as

589

placebo). p.p.: percentage points.

SUPPLEMENTAL METHODS

622

Calculating the median difference in treatment efficacy between two randomly

623

selected donors

624

To convert a mean and standard deviation, measured in terms of log odds ratios, into

625

the median difference in treatment efficacy between two randomly selected donors,

626

measured in terms of percentage points:

627
628

1. 2 million random variates are drawn from a normal distribution with that mean log

629

odds and standard deviation

630

2. These values are transformed into probabilities

631

3. The difference between subsequent values is calculated, and the median

632

determined

633
634
635

SUPPLEMENTAL RESULTS

636

Moayyedi et al. adaptive simulation

637

To determine this probability, we simulated 10,000 clinical trials. In each trial:

638
639

•

6 donors had 4 success/fail trials with probability of success 9 / 39 = 0.23.

640

•

The best performing donor (or, in the case of a tie, a randomly selected donor

641

among the best performers) had 14 additional success/fail trials with the same

642

probability of success

643

•

The performance of the donor with 18 patients was compared against the

644

aggregate performance of the other donors, with 20 patients, using a Fisher’s

645

exact test.

646
647

The test returned mid-p < 0.05 in 8.6% of simulations (n = 866; 95% CI 8.1% to 9.2%).
