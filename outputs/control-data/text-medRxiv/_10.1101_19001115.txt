Abstract

19

Background: Tuberculosis (TB) disease reactivates from distant latent infection or recent

20

(re)infection. Progression risks increase with age. Across the World Health Organisation

21

Western Pacific region, many populations are ageing and have the highest per capita TB

22

incidence rates in older age groups. However, methods for analysing age-specific TB

23

incidence and forecasting epidemic trends while accounting for demographic change remain

24

limited.

25
26

Methods: We applied the Lee-Carter models, which were originally developed for mortality

27

modelling, to model the temporal trends in age-specific TB incidence data from 2005 to 2018

28

in Taiwan. Females and males were modelled separately. We combined our demographic

29

forecasts, and age-specific TB incidence forecasts to project TB incidence until 2035. We

30

compared TB incidence projections with demography fixed in 2018 to projections accounting

31

for demographic change.

32
33

Results: Our models quantified increasing incidence rates with age and declining temporal

34

trends. By 2035, the forecast suggests that the TB incidence rate in Taiwan will decrease by

35

54% (95% Prediction Interval (PI): 45%-59%) compared to 2015, while most age-specific

36

incidence rates will reduce by more than 60%. In 2035, adults aged 65 and above will make

37

up 78% of incident TB cases. Forecast TB incidence in 2035 accounting for demographic

38

change will be 39% (95% PI: 36%-42%) higher than without population ageing.

39
40

Conclusions: Age-specific incidence forecasts coupled with demographic forecasts can

41

inform the impact of population ageing on TB epidemics. The TB control programme in

42

Taiwan should develop plans specific to older age groups and their care needs.

Introduction

49

In 2018, tuberculosis (TB) was still the top infectious killer in the world [1]. The End TB

50

strategy aims at a 90% reduction in TB incidence rate by 2035 compared with 2015, but the

51

current global rate of decline of around 2% per year is not on track to achieve this [2]. Latent

52

TB infection risk accumulates over lifetimes while TB transmission is ongoing. The

53

prevalence of latent TB infection is highest in older age groups [3], who not only have had

54

the longest exposure, but were often exposed to higher TB transmission rates in the past.

55

ageing, with associated higher rates of progression [4], thus acts as a demographic driver

56

towards higher per capita TB incidence [5]. In the Western Pacific region, many countries

57

have their highest per capita TB incidence rates among older age groups [1]. Among

58

Western Pacific region countries, China, Hong Kong (China), Japan, Korean, Singapore, and

59

Taiwan are facing both high TB burden and population ageing[6,7].

60
61

The age profile of future TB incidence is critical for forecasting public health needs and

62

rational policy design [8]. First, older populations will have higher TB (and background)

63

mortality rates [9,10], which implies added difficulty in meeting treatment success targets.

64

Secondly, older adults have more comorbidities and more complex health care needs, which

65

may lead to a longer care-seeking process and higher healthcare expenditure per case. For

66

instance, patients with chronic lung diseases may have signs or symptoms overlapping with

67

TB, making correctly diagnosing their TB slower and more costly [11]. Thirdly, the proportion

68

of TB cases in older age groups should inform policy making, for example suggesting

69

integrating TB care entry points into long-term care programmes, or through clinician training

70

highlighting older people as a TB risk group with their own diagnostic and management

71

challenges [11].

72
73

Quantitatively forecasting the TB incidence age profile needs combined models forecasting

74

demographic change and statistical forecasts of age-specific TB incidence. However, a time

75

series analysis producing age-specific forecasts of the TB incidence has not been published

76

to our knowledge. Use of autoregressive integrated moving average models, often including

77

the seasonality of TB incidence is more common [12], and comoving time series analysis

78

has been applied [13] without age-specific information. Age-specific TB incidence modelling,

79

including the use of age-period-cohort models, has been undertaken but without producing

80

epidemic forecasts (e.g. Iqbal et al. [14] and Wu et al. [15]). Mechanistic mathematical

81

modelling, with age structure, also has the potential to generate forecasts [5,16–18].

82

However, age-specific forecasting and the impact of demographic change have yet to be

83

analyzed.

84
85

In many settings, the demographic transition and population ageing are outpacing declines

86

in TB incidence, so methods to understand and forecast the impact of changing demography

87

on TB epidemics are needed. We, therefore, developed a statistical method capturing age-

88

specific incidence trends and forecasting future epidemics while accounting for demographic

89

change.

Setting and data sources

93

TB incidence in Taiwan has steadily declined from 64 confirmed TB cases per 100,000 in

94

2007 to 41 per 100,000 in 2017. Since 2005, the proportion of TB cases in Taiwan over 65

95

years of age has been over 50% and increasing. Between 2007 and 2017, the average age

96

in Taiwan increased from 36 to 40, and the proportions of adults above 65 rose from 10% to

97

14% [7].

98
99

Notification data of culture-confirmed TB cases, excluding foreigners, were obtained from the

100

Taiwan Center for Disease Control surveillance system. Counts were reported by age group,

101

sex, month, and county. Ages were reported as (0-4, 5-9, ..., 65-69, 70+) years. The

102

demographic data were obtained from the Department of Statistics, the Ministry of the

103

Interior, Taiwan. These data included the mid-year population estimators, deaths, migration

104

in single-year ages, and fertility in five-year age groups (15-19, ..., 45-49). We used data in

105

2005-2018 as a training set. The demographic data from 2005 to 2017 were collected for the

106

population demographic modelling (a shorter period because of the release schedule). All

107

the training data in this article were published by the Taiwan officials and free access on the

108

internet; the usage is licensed by the Open Government Data License:

109

[https://data.gov.tw/license].

110
111

Importantly, we assumed no case detection gaps existed during the time frame covered by

112

this article. We, therefore, regard “TB notification” and “TB incidence” as synonymous with

113

the number culture-confirmed tuberculosis cases notified during a specific period.

114

115

Age-specific incidence modelling and forecasting

116

We considered annual incidence rates by age and sex. The incidence rates by age groups

117

and sex were calculated as the yearly notification counts divided by corresponding mid-year

118

population estimates. Females and males were analysed separately with the same

119

parameterisation. We modelled the incidence rates using Lee-Carter Models (LCMs) [19]

120

formulated with age and time-varying terms. The LCMs were initially designed for mortality

121

rate modelling, where they now predominate. Estimation, forecasting, bootstrapping

122

methods for LCMs are well-developed.

123
124

We performed a likelihood-based LCM estimation, and also the comparable Poisson

125

regression [20]:

126

log (𝐸(𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠𝑎𝑔𝑒,𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 )) = 𝛼𝑎𝑔𝑒 + 𝛽𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝜅𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 + log(𝑝𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑔𝑒,𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 )

127

, where 𝐸(. ) is expectation function, 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 ∈ {2005, … , 2018} is the calendar year,

128

𝛼𝑎𝑔𝑒 is age effect term, 𝜅𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 is period effect term, and 𝛽𝑎𝑔𝑒 is coefficients adjusting

129

period effects for different age groups, and 𝑎𝑔𝑒 ∈ {0 − 4, 5 − 9, … ,70+} represents

130

the age categories. To maintain identifiability, we imposed the constraints

131

Σ𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝜅𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 = 0 and Σ𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝛽𝑎𝑔𝑒 = 1 . Two nested Poisson models, one using an age-

132

profile and a discrete period effect, i.e. 𝛼𝑎𝑔𝑒 + 𝜅𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 , and another using an age-profile

133

and a linear effect, i.e. 𝛼𝑎𝑔𝑒 + 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 × 𝜅, were used as comparators. Akaike

134

information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and log-likelihood

135

were considered as goodness of fit metrics.

136
137

For forecasting, inspired by the Lee-Carter demographic forecasting, we used

138

Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average models with drift [21], constructed from the LCM

139

period effects. In forecasting, the death and birth processes applied semiparametric

140

bootstrap sampling [22].

Population modelling and forecasting

143

We constructed a synthetic population with birth, death and migration processes. The

144

demographic methods adapted from those used in the Taiwan National Development

145

Council’s population projection report [7]. The demography was modelled by single age (06

146

100 years old) and sex. Mortality forecasting used the Lee-Carter model [19] below 84 years

147

of age and the Coale-Kisker method [23] for above 85. The birth forecasting used the fertility

148

rates of women in childbearing ages, from 15 to 49, with a modified LCM [24]. For

149

consistency with incidence forecasting, semiparametric bootstrap sampling was used for

150

deaths and births [22]. The Migration process was modelled by linear regression with age

151

effects and a linear trend; the forecasting applied residual bootstrap sampling with the age-

152

specific parameters seen in 2017. The forecasts were used for the next step by aggregating

153

to the age groups as that of the incidence data.

154

155

Forecasting overall TB incidence

156

The TB incidence model and the demographic model were built independently. Forecasts of

157

age-specific TB incidence were weighted by forecasted population demography to obtain

158

forecasts of per capita TB incidence for the whole population. TB incidence was calculated

159

as per 100,000 rates by given strata. TB incidence rate reductions were calculated with

160

respect to the incidence in 2015 and presented as percentages. For simplicity, some results

161

were presented with age groups of 0-14, 15-34, 35-64, and above 65. In forecasting, the

162

95% prediction intervals and mean values were computed from 10,000 bootstrap samples.

163

Uncertainty was propagated from every submodel. To compare with the global reduction

164

target of the End TB strategy [2], we forecasted the incidence until 2035. The milestones of

165

2020, 2030 and 2035 of the End TB strategy of percentage reductions in per capita TB

166

incidence from 2015 were used as intermediate outcomes.

172

including projected changes in population structure by computing the fraction of total TB

respectively and is the calendar year. This corresponds to the definition of population

Incidence modelling

184

Fig 1 shows the estimators of the Lee-Carter models of the incidence data. The age effect

185

estimators (𝛼𝑎𝑔𝑒 ) suggested the baseline incidence rates increase with age. In both

186

sexes, the higher levels in age groups older than fifteen years correspond to higher

187

TB incidence rates. The point estimators of age-period adjustments (𝛽𝑎𝑔𝑒 ) showed

188

no specific trend. However, there are large uncertainties for all estimates pertaining

189

to under 15-year age groups, excepting the reference group aged 0-4. The period

190

effect estimators (𝜅𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 ) had nearly constant trends with calendar years. Fig 1 also

Incidence forecasting and age structure

211

Fig 3 demonstrates the trends of the population TB incidence rate and TB incidence rates by

212

age-group (<15, 15-34, 35-64, >65). The forecast in Fig 3A suggests that the TB incidence in

213

2035 will be 22 (95% Prediction Interval (PI): 19-25) per 100 000. The overall incidence

214

reduction will reach 54% (95% PI: 45%-59%) in 2035, which is 37% short of the 90%

215

reduction in the End TB Strategy. Fig 3B shows the age-specific incidence rates will have

216

60% to 80% reductions from 2015 to 2035 apart from the 5-9 group. The rate reductions in

217

most age groups will be higher than the forecast reduction of 44% in the whole population.

218

Fig 3C decomposes the overall incidence rates by age groups. The TB incidence rates from

219

age groups below 65 will be gradually decreasing whereas the above 65 will nearly stay

220

constant from 2018 to 2035. Fig 3D shows the proportion of TB incidence in each age group.

221

The proportion among adults aged over 65 years will reach 68% (95% PI: 67%-69%) and

222

79% (95% PI: 78%-81%) in 2025 and 2035, respectively. In 2035, more than 97% of incident

223

cases will occur among those aged 35 years or older.

224

225

Impact of demography on TB incidence

226

Fig 4 shows the forecast incidence rates with and without demographic change. In the

227

scenario without demographic change, the forecast suggests that the incidence in 2035 will

228

be around 13 per 100,000 compared to 23 with demographic change and the 90% reduction

229

target of 4.5 per 100,000. The 95% prediction intervals for forecasts with demographic

230

change continuously expand year by year, whereas without demographic change they

231

converge to a constant width within five years. Table 2 shows the impact of demographic

232

change. Up to 2020, TB incidence rates will have 23% and 27% reductions with and without

233

demographic change respectively. Considering demographic change, the incidence rates

234

are projected to reduce by 54% (95% PI: 45%-59%) from 2015 to 2035; without

235

demographic change, the reduction will be 72% (95% PI: 67%-76%). In both scenarios, the

236

trends of incidence rates showed diminishing reductions to the time scale. In 2035, the

forecasts suggested that 39% (95% PI: 36%-42%) of incident TB cases can be attributed to

demographic change.

Discussion

244
245

A substantial proportion of tuberculosis (TB) incidence in Taiwan is among people aged over

246

65 years. Social and economic development typically bring reductions in TB incidence but

247

also reduced birth and death rates and population ageing. This study provides a novel

248

investigation into the potential impact on TB incidence from population ageing using

249

statistical modelling and forecasting. Current trends of TB incidence declines and

250

demographic change suggest TB incidence rates in Taiwan will decrease to 25 per 100,000

251

by 2035. This represents a 45% reduction since 2015, missing the End TB goal of 90%

252

reductions in TB incidence rates. We have shown that higher age-specific incidence rates in

253

older age groups can mean that population ageing acts against reductions in TB rates, with

254

TB incidence in 2035 projected to be 39% higher than without demographic change.

255
256

Previous studies have employed statistical methods either to forecast TB incidence,

257

[12,13,30,31] or to analyze patterns by age using age-period-cohort models, [14,15] but we

258

are the first study to statistically forecast age-specific TB incidence. Some transmission

259

modelling studies [16,18] have explored issues related to age-structure, but without

260

forecasts or formal assessment of fit. We made novel use of Lee-Carter models (LCMs),

261

[19,21] which employ an elegant low-dimensional decomposition of age-specific rates to

262

model trends and overall shape. LCMs were originally introduced for mortality rate modelling

263

and are now the dominant approach, but have been applied elsewhere. Within demography,

264

Hyndman [24] and Rueda-Sabater and Alvarez-Esteban [32] used LCMs to forecast the

265

fertility rates, and Cowen [33] fitted LCMs to abortion rates. Kainz et al. [34] modelled

266

chronic kidney disease prevalence as rate data, and Yue et al. [35] modelled cancer

267

incidence and mortality. However, we are the first to apply LCMs to TB, finding they fitted

268

better than Poisson Age-Period models. Our approach offers a generalizable and easily-

269

implemented method for forecasting age-specific TB incidence and the impact of

270

demographic change on total TB incidence.

271
272

For Taiwan and many other high-income settings, TB notifications are thought to parallel TB

273

incidence with only a small gap. In settings where this gap is larger and changing over time,

274

interpretation of TB notification data is more problematic and notifications may not be a good

275

proxy for incidence. Taiwan does not have United Nations Population Division demographic

276

forecasts, hence our bespoke demographic modelling. For most nations, these forecasts

277

could be used ‘off the shelf’. We have presented results on percentage reductions in both

278

per capita TB incidence rates and in total TB incidence (e.g. Table 2), which are similar

279

because of Taiwan’s small projected population change over the period considered; this may

280

282

The decline in TB incidence in Taiwan probably has multiple contributory causes, including

283

improvements in TB control, socio-economic development, and the reductions in the

284

prevalence of latent TB as a result of declining transmission. For an infectious disease like

285

TB, reduced transmission can amplify and sustain over time changes in underlying causative

286

factors, complicating their analysis. The low TB rates in children aged under fifteen may

287

reflect low exposure to TB in this group or potentially lower rates of case detection. Our

288

assessment of the impact of population ageing on TB incidence and case-mix has particular

289

current relevance to many WHO Western Pacific region countries [1] and will be relevant to

290

many more countries and regions in the future. Our analysis could provide a template for

291

analysts who wish to explore issues related to future TB incidence and demography where

292

age-specific data are available.

293
294

Our analysis accounted for cohort propagation of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in a

295

phenomenological way. LTBI represents accumulated lifetime risk of infection by exposure to

296

active tuberculosis disease. Older individuals in most settings have higher LTBI prevalence

297

due both to longer cumulative exposure and (in declining epidemics) exposure to a higher

298

mean infection rate over their lifetime. The ageing through of these LTBI positive cohorts

299

thus generates a secular time trend in reactivation disease rates at a particular age. Our

300

approach does not explicitly model LTBI prevalence, because this would introduce additional

301

parameters and, without LTBI data, identifiability issues. However, LTBI cohort effects are

302

accounted for in our current approach indirectly by modelling the secular trends in age-

303

specific incidence rates.

304
305

Extending the model by adding exogenous variables is possible. Our analysis did not

306

address the impact of other variables for simplicity and clarity. Important predictors could

307

include socioeconomic status and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. [36] However,

308

projections would require additional time-series analysis to forecast these explanatory

309

variables.

310
311

Older age as a risk factor for TB disease has perhaps been under-explored since age is not

312

a modifiable risk factor, and since in most current high-burden settings populations and the

313

typical age of TB cases are fairly young. Our result that population ageing will act to slow

314

declines in TB incidence does not seem to have been previously noted. However, the

315

importance of older age groups to TB control is already evident in many Asian populations,

316

[16] and this will be an increasingly widespread facet of global TB control if reductions in

317

incidence continue and accelerate in the future. Older populations will also have their own

318

particular challenges in terms of access, diagnosis and comorbidities complicating their care.

319

Public health planning to develop adapted strategies for care and control to meet these

320

changing population needs is essential.

321
322

In summary, the Lee-Carter model provides a tool to project age-specific tuberculosis

323

incidence and hence forecast overall TB incidence while accounting for demographic

324

change. In Taiwan, population ageing may slow the decline of TB incidence by 39% over the

325

period 2015 - 2035. TB care and control programmes will increasingly need to address the

326

needs of older adults, who will comprise a growing majority of the TB epidemic.
