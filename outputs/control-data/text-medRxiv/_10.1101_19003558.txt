Abstract
Background: Pregnancy loss is one of the most frequent pregnancy
complications. It is unclear how recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) impacts
disease risk later in life and if later disease risk is different in women with or
without a live birth prior to RPL (primary vs. secondary RPL). We sought to
investigate if women have an increased risk of disease following RPL, and if
there was a difference between primary and secondary RPL.
Methods: Using population-wide health care registry databases from Denmark
we identified a cohort of 1,370,896 women between 12 and 40 years in the
period January 1, 1977, to October 5, 2016 who had been pregnant. Each
woman was followed on average for 15.8 years. Of these, 10,691 (0.77%)
women fulfilled the criteria for RPL (50.0% had primary RPL). Relative Risk
Ratios (RR) were calculated in a phenome-wide manner for diagnoses with a
cumulative incidence proportion ൒0.1% in women with RPL. Diagnoses
related to assessment and diagnosis of RPL and those appearing later in life
were separated using a Mixture Model.
Results: In the full cohort of pregnant women, 0.77% (10,691) fulfilled the
criteria for RPL (50.0% primary RPL). Compared to women without RPL,
primary RPL increased the risk of subsequent cardiovascular disorders,
including atherosclerosis (RR=2.45, 1.65-3.51 95% Uncertainty Interval (UI)),
cerebral infarction (RR=1.87, 1.43-2.4 95% UI), heart failure (RR=1.97, 1.442.63 95% UI), and pulmonary embolism (RR=1.82, 1.32-2.46 95% UI).
Women with secondary RPL had an increased risk of obstetric complications,
e.g. placenta previa (RR=3.76, 2.9-4.8 95% UI), premature rupture of

membrane (RR=2.55, 2.21-2.91 95% UI), intrapartum hemorrhage (RR=2.8,
1.77-4.31 95% UI), gestational hypertension (RR=2.2, 1.67-2.87 95% UI), and
puerperal sepsis (RR=2.54, 1.8-3.5 95% UI). We also noticed associations to
autoimmune, respiratory, gastro-intestinal and mental disorders in both
subtypes.
Conclusion: Our findings show that RPL is a risk factor for a spectrum of
disorders. This can in part be due to increased screening following RPL, but it
also suggests that RPL may directly influence or share etiology with a number
of diseases later in life. Research into the pathophysiology of both pregnancy
loss and later diseases merits further investigation.

Introduction
Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL) is a condition that affects 1-3% of couples,
depending on its precise definition.1,2 While the definition of RPL is not fully
consistent across the world, it has historically been defined as three or more
consecutive pregnancy losses (PL).3 The reason for requiring repeated PLs
as part of the RPL definition is that with increasing number of losses the
frequency of euploid losses also increases while the chance of a live birth
decreases.4–6 RPL is divided into two categories: primary and secondary RPL.
In primary RPL, there has been no live birth prior to the consecutive losses. In
secondary RPL, the women have had at least one live birth. Prior studies
have pointed towards a different pathophysiology for these two subtypes. In
primary RPL there may be pathophysiological factors that make it impossible
to carry a pregnancy to term, whereas in secondary RPL there may be an
increased maternal immunization.11 Two Scandinavian studies found that 4048% of cases were secondary RPL.1,12 One study from Israel reported that
61% of cases were secondary RPL.13

RPL is a multifactorial condition that in addition to fetal causes have multiple
known female risk factors such as autoimmune diseases, endocrine
disorders, and uterine malformations.2,9 Male risk factors have been
investigated less, but include chromosomal abnormalities, sperm DNA
fragmentation, and age.10 Some factors associated with a delayed time to
pregnancy and infertility, such as endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome,
and diabetes have a clear association to disease later in life, including
malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular disease.14–16

Moreover, obstetric complications have also been found to increase the risk of
cardiovascular disease (CVD).17 In recent years, PLs and RPL have been
identified as a risk factor for malignancies and cardiovascular disease
(CVD).18–22 The association with CVD has been further explored in a study
that found first degree relatives of women with RPL had an increased risk of
CVD.23,24 Despite RPL having a major impact on the affected couples, both
mentally and physically, the etiology and life-long consequences are poorly
understood.7,8 Our hypothesis is that RPL and pregnancy losses not attributed
to aneuploidy are associated with later disease.
In this study, we compare primary and secondary RPL in a phenome-wide
analysis using a nation-wide cohort based on 1,370,896 women.

Methods
The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (ref: 2015-540939 and SUND-2017-57) and Danish Health Authority (ref: FSEID-00001627
and FSEID-00003092). Informed consent and assessment of the proposal in
scientific ethical committees are not required for registry-based research in
Denmark.

Study design and setting
This observational population was identified using the nationwide Danish
Patient Registry and the Danish Medical Birth Registry. We included women
aged 12-40 with at least one live birth or pregnancy loss (PL) in the period
between 1st January 1977 and 5th October 2016. Women with multiple births
(twins or higher order) were excluded. The population totaled 1,370,896
women.
Women with RPL were followed from the date of meeting the exposure until
the end of follow-up (criteria until death or October 5th 2016).
Each woman with RPL was matched with twenty women from the population
without RPL. The women were matched based on year of birth and number of
previous live births. The matched comparison group of women without RPL
was followed for the outcomes from the same date of the woman with RPL
they were matched to, i.e. only the hospital admissions occurring on or after
the date of RPL and matching was used in the analysis. Women with RPL
were divided into primary and secondary RPL based on the parity history prior
to the date of RPL.

Outcomes were identified using several nationwide registries that cover all
hospital admissions in Denmark (see Supplementary Methods for a
description).25
We identified 10,691 women that fulfilled the criteria for RPL (50.0% primary)
(defined in the next section). The number of years the women were followed
varied based on the outcome, but the total number of person-years was, on
average, 1,782,238 years (range 1,231,217-1,799,076 years) for women with
primary RPL and the matched group, and 1,744,736 years (range 1,155,4271,763,733 years) for women with secondary RPL and the matched group.
Across all outcomes, the median follow-up up time for women was 15.8 years,
ranging from 11.6-16.4 years for each specific outcome.

Pregnancy Loss and Recurrent Pregnancy Loss
PLs were identified from hospital admissions in the Danish National Patient
Registry (

Table 1). In Denmark, every child showing signs of life at delivery is
categorized as a live birth irrespective of gestational age. If there is no sign of
life at delivery it is considered a pregnancy loss prior to the 28th completed
weeks of gestation and a stillbirth hereafter. This definition was changed
starting from 2004 when stillbirth were counted from the 22nd completed
weeks of gestation. We filtered out diagnoses that were repeated within a
medically unreasonable period of time: 1) <22 weeks between two live or still
births, 2) <90 days between two PLs, induced abortions, molar or ectopic
pregnancies, 3) <22 weeks between a PL, induced abortion, or an
extrauterine or molar pregnancy and a stillbirth or livebirth, and 4) <30 days
between a live or still birth and a PL, abortion, or an extrauterine or molar
pregnancy.
Cases of RPL were identified using hospital discharge codes (

Table 1) or by three consecutive PLs. The date of RPL diagnosis was defined
as the date of the third PL or RPL diagnosis, whichever came first.
In the matching process, we used 1,370,339 women from the total population.
The median number of unique matched women per outcome was 186,752,
ranging from 133,875 to 187,355.

Outcomes
In the phenome-wide analysis we investigated ICD-10 codes at the third level
that had a prevalence ൒0.1% in women with RPL (626 diagnoses). ICD-10
codes related to birth, pregnancy loss, and abortion were excluded (O00-O08
and O80-O84), as well as codes from ICD-10 chapters 19, 20, 21, and 22.
Only the first instance of a diagnosis code was included.

Differentiating early from late disease occurrences
Some of the diagnoses with an increased risk are due to investigations at an
RPL clinic. To differentiate the diagnoses found during investigations at RPL
clinics and later in life, we fitted a log-normal mixture model (LMMM). The
optimal number of components was determined using the Bayesian
Information Criteria. For each diagnosis code with an increased risk, the time
from RPL diagnosis until the outcome occurred was summarized as the
median. Time distributions were visualized as histograms that binned multiple
diagnoses into one bin.

Statistical Analysis
Risk ratios (RR) were estimated using a hierarchical Bayesian Poisson loglinear model. As covariates we included the age and previous number of live
births. A model was fit separately for women with primary and secondary
RPL, respectively. Bayesian posterior distributions were summarized as 95%
uncertainty intervals (UI). All estimates were derived from the same Bayesian
multilevel model with a pooled prior, which shrinks the expected values and is
one way of dealing with the multiple comparison issue.26 We defined a prior
structure that takes into account the chapter structure in the ICD-10
terminology, see Supplementary Text for a thorough evaluation of the priors
and the model. Distributions of time from RPL diagnoses until outcome were
modelled using a log-normal mixture model. Additional detail on the statistical
procedures are provided in the Supplementary Text. All data were analyzed
using stan v2.18, python v2.7 and R v3.1.3.

Results
Out of a pool of 1,310 unique ICD-10 codes assigned to women after RPL, we
investigated 615 diagnoses with a cumulative incidence proportion of at least
0.1% in women with RPL. We found 180 and 172 diagnoses with an elevated
RR in primary and secondary RPL, respectively. These covered very
heterogenous types of disease (Figure 1, Supplementary Table 2), and
included cardiovascular disorders, obstetric diagnoses, autoimmune diseases,
mental disorders, digestive disorders, and respiratory diseases. We also
observed eight diagnoses with a RR lower than one in women with primary
RPL, which were all related to complications of labor and delivery.
Differentiating early from late disease, we identified an “early” and “late”
component for both primary and secondary RPL (Figure 2, Supplementary
Table 3). The early component was found to have a mean of 2.5 (sd=0.9)
years for primary RPL and 1.8 (sd=0.7) years for secondary RPL. The
component contained a lot of diagnoses routinely investigated as part of the
RPL clinic work-up, e.g. uterine and cervical malformations, balanced
chromosomal rearrangements, and abnormal immunological findings in
serum. Additionally, there were many diagnoses related to obstetric
complications and pregnancy for both primary and secondary RPL. When we
compared primary and secondary RPL, looking only at the diagnoses with an
increased risk in one of the subtypes, we observed many obstetric
complications in secondary RPL (Error! Reference source not found.). These
included placenta previa (RR=3.76, 95% UI 2.9-4.8), premature rupture of
membrane (RR=2.55, 95% UI 2.21-2.91), intrapartum hemorrhage (RR=2.8,
95% UI 1.77-4.31), gestational hypertension (RR=2.2, 95% UI 1.67-2.87), prePage 12 of 29

eclampsia (RR=2.31, 95% UI 1.83-2.88), puerperal sepsis (RR=2.54, 95% UI
1.8-3.5), and placental abruption (RR=2.99, 95% UI 2.2-3.97). The latter also
had an increased risk in primary RPL, albeit lower (RR=1.32, 95% UI 1.041.65).
The late component was found to have a mean of 13.3 (sd=5) after the
primary PRL diagnosis and contained 160 diagnoses. Strikingly, for many
cardiovascular diseases we did not observe an increased risk in women with
secondary RPL (Error! Reference source not found.). This included
atherosclerosis (RR=2.45, 1.65-3.51 95% Uncertainty Interval (UI)), cerebral
infarction (RR=1.87, 1.43-2.4 95% UI), heart failure (RR=1.97, 1.44-2.63 95%
UI), and pulmonary embolism (RR=1.82, 1.32-2.46 95% UI). Other diseases
included lupus erythematosus (RR=2.6, 1.42-4.53 95% UI), systemic lupus
erythematosus (RR=3.51, 2.28-5.21 95% UI), and COPD (RR=1.38, 1.11-1.7
95% UI). Several mental disorders were also found, including anxiety
(RR=1.29, 1.08-1.52 95% UI), obsessive-compulsive disorder (RR=1.59,
1.07-2.35 95% UI), and psychiatric disorders associated with the puerperium
(RR=2.14,1.15-4.0 95% UI).
In women with secondary RPL, the “late” component had a mean value of
12.0 (sd=3.7) years after the diagnosis. Diagnoses that only had an increased
risk in women with secondary RPL included irritable bowel syndrome
(RR=1.33, 1.12-1.58 95% UI), ulcerative colitis (RR=1.32, 1.03-1.69 95% UI),
and intestinal malabsorption (RR=1.67, 1.16-2.41 95% UI). Mental disorders
included recurrent depressive disorders (RR=1.25, 1.07-1.45 95% UI) and
mixed personality disorders (RR=1.66, 1.17-2.39 95% UI).

We also observed thyroid disorders (hypothyroidism, nontoxic goiter,

and gastritis and duodenitis) with an increased risk in both subtypes,
belonging to the late component.

Discussion
In this study, we performed the largest registry-based phenome-wide study todate of short- and long-run disease incidence associated with recurrent
pregnancy loss (RPL). The population comprised 1,370,896 women, of which
10,691 had three or more consecutive PLs. By investigating diagnoses
occurring after RPL, we identified distinct spectrums of complications for
primary and secondary RPL. The diagnoses were divided into “early” and
“late” complications: The “early” complications contained many previously
established risk factors for RPL that are part of the routine screening at RPL
clinics.2 These included coagulation disorders, congenital malformations of
the female genital organs, and autoimmune diseases. The component also
contained obstetric complications, of which some only had a higher risk in
secondary RPL. The “late” component included multiple complications in
heterogenous disease domains, such as cardiovascular diseases,
autoimmune diseases, mental disorders, digestive system disorders, and
respiratory diseases. The disorders occurred, on average, more than ten
years after the RPL diagnosis, and there were a distinct set of diseases
associated to primary and secondary RPL. We found no evidence that women
with RPL had an increased risk of malignancies, irrespective of the subtype.
The basis for this study was nation-wide data collected over a 39-year period.
Reporting to the Danish registries used in this study is mandatory. An
important source of bias is unregistered PLs. This includes PLs handled at
home, in general or gynecological practice. This leads to some women being
erroneously classified as not having RPL leading to an underestimation of the
RR. Further, the RPL definition depends on the reliability of the identification

of spontaneous pregnancy losses in the DNPR. However, this condition has
previously been estimated to have a positive predictive value of 97%27. Lack
of information from the DMBR could result in women being classified wrongly
as primary and secondary RPL; nonetheless, the DMBR is considered to be
complete.28 The registries do not contain complete information on smoking
status or BMI. Additionally, we did not have any information on socioeconomic
status or whether the partner was the same for all pregnancies, which could
confound our findings. Neither did we include the disease history prior to RPL,
which could also confound the results. Still, many women experiencing RPL
are not properly investigated prior to referral to a specialist clinic, and it is
therefore not possible to take this into account. We also note that the infant
and maternal mortality in Denmark is extremely low.30,31 This is partially due to
universal healthcare and referral to specialist clinics involved in the monitoring
and treatment of e.g. pregnant women with diabetes and heart disease.
Therefore, we would not expect to see many pregnancy losses in the cohort
due to e.g. uncontrolled diabetes. Additionally, there are no known causal
factors for RPL with the exception of embryonal malformations, and it is thus
difficult to control for pre-existing conditions related to RPL. We have
attempted to correct for an extremely important factor, namely age, as well as
parity which may also affect the health state, as seen with breast cancer.32,33
A recent Danish study noted that there is no difference in BMI between
women with secondary and primary RPL.34 Moreover, the probability of an
early pregnancy loss is highly correlated with age. Since we did not have
information on the karyotype of the product of conception, we have tried to
minimize the confounding effect from aneuploidy by only including women

younger than 40 years of age. A mixture of cases due to aneuploidy would
weaken the signal, and we could thereby have missed some associations, or
underestimated the relative risks. Lastly, this study was based on population
data from a 39-year period. Whilst this is helpful for a long follow-up period,
changes and developments in medical practice may influence the results.
However, we did attempt to mitigate this effect by matching women born in
the same year.
Here we studied only the first occurrence of a diagnosis. Nonetheless, it may
also be of interest to study if certain conditions have a higher recurrence rate
in women with RPL. This is complicated by the fact that it is difficult to
determine from the registry whether a disease is actually reoccurring or just a
repetition of the existing condition. In our study we used predefined ranges to
tackle this issue in relation to birth and pregnancy loss. Lastly, due to the
large number of outcomes studied in this phenome wide analysis, we cannot
rule out chance findings. Nevertheless, the large number of diagnoses
associated with RPL remains striking and is consistent within certain domains
of disease, which merits further investigation.
We found that primary and secondary RPL, when considered separate
phenotypes, are followed by a unique spectrum of complications. Our
observations in the domain of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and obstetric
complications are in accordance with prior studies.19,20,35,36 Yet, previous
studies of CVD and PL have not been stratified by subtype, and here we
demonstrate that primary RPL drives the observed associations. This is an
important distinction, as this could point towards shared pathophysiology only
present in women with primary RPL and could serve as basis for future

screening and risk-assessment profiles. Furthermore, we found that systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE), a recognized risk factor for RPL, also was
significantly more frequent in women after a RPL diagnosis and belonged to
the “late” component. This can be explained in at least two different ways.
First, if SLE and RPL share a common pathophysiological cause our findings
indicate that this cause has not always manifested fully at the time of RPL
diagnosis and evaluation or it could be that RPL itself increases the risk of
SLE possibly through increased microchimerism.37,38 Lastly, the increased risk
of mental disorders and substance abuse could possibly be mitigated by a
closer follow-up and referral to therapy.
The study was performed in a single, national cohort over a period of 39
years. The Danish definition of RPL has been the same in that period, but is
different from the one recently adopted by ASRM and ESHRE. Aligning the
disease patterns in two cohorts with different definitions can be difficult, and
this should be taken into consideration in future comparative studies.
The large population of women, both with and without RPL, allowed us to
investigate late-state complication in a phenome-wide manner. This has
historically not been possible, owing to the small cohort sizes often used. The
findings we present here are of wide interest as we identify RPL as a risk
factor and a potential early indicator of later disease, stratified by the subtype.
There are large discrepancies across health in men and women.39 Here, we
have tried to elucidate how the fertility history contributes to disease. The
identification of complications across the full spectrum of disease present a
new set of challenges that must be examined in-depth clinically to uncover the

etiology. Identification of clinically relevant subtypes is an important aspect of
precision medicine, both to tailor screening and therapy to reduce the disease
burden, but also to prevent overdiagnosis and unnecessary invasive
procedures. Considering the full pregnancy history including prior pregnancy
losses is thus relevant when evaluating and predicting the future risk of
disease in women.
