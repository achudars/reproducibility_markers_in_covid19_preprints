Abstract

The prognosis prediction of cancer patients is important for disease management. We introduce
DeepProg, a new computational framework that robustly predicts patient survival subtypes based on
multiple types of omic data, using an ensemble of deep-learning and machine-learning models. We apply
DeepProg on 32 cancer datasets from TCGA and identified multiple cancer survival subtypes. Patient
survival risk-stratification based on DeepProg is significantly better (p-value=7.9e-7 rank sum test) than
Similarity Network Fusion based multi-omics data integration in all cancer types. Further comprehensive
pan-cancer comparative analysis unveils the genomic signatures common among all the poorest survival
subtypes, with genes enriched in extracellular matrix modeling, immune deregulation, and mitosis
processes. Furthermore, models built on closely related cancer types using DeepProg are predictive of the
subtypes of some other cancers, demonstrating the utility of DeepProg for transfer learning.

Introduction
Cancer subtypes identification, based on molecular signatures, enables tumor classification beyond tumor
stage, grade, or tissue of origin 1. Cancer subtypes sharing similar molecular and pathway alterations
could be treated with the same drugs 2. One of such subtypes are survival stratified patient subtypes
based on prognostic signatures 3, which can assist clinicians in decision making 4. Moreover, the
molecular differences associated with patient survival help shed light to understand the mechanism of
tumor progression 5.
Most survival-based molecular signatures are based on one single type of omics data 6. Since each omic
platform has specific limitations and noises, multi-omics based integrative approach presumably can yield
more coherent signatures 7. However, this approach to predict clinical phenotypes are much less explored

comparatively, due to the combination of computational and practical challenges. These challenges
include platform-specific measurement biases 8, different data distributions which require proper
normalizations 9, as well as very limited sample-sizes with multi-omics measurements due to the high cost
10

. Among the multi-omics data integration methods, most of them do not model patient survival as the

objective, rather the survival differences associated with molecular subtypes are evaluated in a post hoc
fashion 11. iCluster, Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) and rMKL-LPP are such examples 12–14. iCluster is
of the earliest methods to cluster cancer samples into different molecular subtypes based on multi-omic
features, using probabilistic modelling to project the data to a lower embedding 12. rMKL-LPP combines
multiple regularized kernels for each omics to transform the data into a lower embedding and then cluster
the samples using k-means 14. Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) algorithm is another popular clustering
method to integrate different omic features, by first constructing a distinct similarity network for each
omic then fusing the networks using an iterative procedure

13

. It was applied on multiple TCGA cancer

datasets 15,16.
Unlike the methods mentioned above, DeepProg explicitly models patient survival as the objective. It
constructs an ensemble of hybrid-models (a combination of deep-learning and machine learning models)
and integrate their outputs following the ensemble learning paradigm. We applied DeepProg on RNASeq, Methylation, and miRNA data from 32 cancers in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), with a total of
around 10,000 samples. All the models constructed by DeepProg show better predictive performances
when compared to SNF method. The gene expression in the worst survival subtype of all cancers shares
common signatures involved in biological functions such as mitotic enhancement, extracellular-matrix
destabilization, or immune deregulation. Moreover, DeepProg can successfully predict the outcomes for
samples from one cancer using the models built upon other cancers. In short, DeepProg is a powerful,
generic, machine-learning and deep-learning based method that can be used to predict the survival
subtype of an individual patient.

Results

DeepProg Method overview
DeepProg is a general hybrid computational framework to predict patient survival based on one or more
omics data types, such as mRNA transcriptomics, DNA methylation and microRNA expression (Figure
1). The first phase of DeepProg is composed of dimension reduction and feature transformation using
auto-encoders, a type of deep neural-network. In the default implementation, the auto-encoders have 3
layers, the input layer, the hidden layer (100 nodes), and the output layer. The transformed features are
then subject to uni-variate Cox-PH fitting, in order to further select a subset of features linked to survival.
Next, using unsupervised clustering approach, DeepProg identifies the optimal number of classes (labels)
of survival subpopulations, and use these classes to construct support vector machine (SVM) based
machine-learning models, in order to predict a new patient’s survival group. To ensure robustness of the
models, DeepProg adopts a boosting approach and builds an ensemble of models. The boosting approach
yields more accurate p-values and C-indices with lower variances and leads to faster convergence of the
models (Supplementary Table 1). Each of these models is constructed with a random subset (eg. 4/5) of
the original dataset and evaluated using the C-index value from the remaining hold-out (eg. 1/5) testing
samples.

Prognostic prediction on 32 TCGA cancers
We applied DeepProg to analyze the multi-omics data (RNA-Seq, miRNA-Seq and DNA methylation) of
32 cancers in TCGA (Supplementary Table 2). We used only RNA and MIR for Ovarian Cancer (OV)
because only a small fraction (9 out of 300) of the samples had the 3-omics data at the time of the
manuscript submission. For each cancer type, we selected the optimal clustering number K that produces
the best combination of silhouette scores and Adjusted Rand Index (Supplementary Table 3), metrics
that measure the clustering stabilities and accuracy. Almost all cancers (30 out of 32) have K=2 as the
most optimum survival-subgroups (Figure 2A). With the optimal cluster numbers, we computed the log-

rank p-values among the different survival subtypes of each cancer, all of which are statistically
significant (log rank p-values < 0.05) and have C-indexes (0.6 -1.0) greater than 0.5, the expected value
of random models. Among them, 23 out of 32 cancers have log rank p-values less than 5e-4, highlighting
the values of the models at differentiating patient survival (Figure 2B). Additionally, we investigated the
average number of hidden-layer features significantly associated with survival, for each omic data type
and each cancer (Supplementary Figure 1). Overall, RNA-Seq has the most amount of important hidden
features towards survival prediction. miRNA hidden features have similar patterns in all cancers, with
fewer total counts. Although vast heterogeneity exists among 32 cancers, some cancers known to be
closely related, such as colon cancer (COAD) and gastric cancer (STAD), as well as bladder cancer
(BLCA) and kidney cancer (KIRC), also share similar prognostic hidden features.

To evaluate the new DeepProg method, we compared the results from the 32 cancers above with those
obtained from the Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) algorithm

13

, a state-of-the-art method to integrate

multi-omics data (Figure 2B and 2C, Supplementary Figure 2). Previously SNF was used to identify
cancer subtypes linked to survival by others 15,16. As shown in Figure 2B, the survival subtypes from SNF
only have significant survival difference in 13 out of 32 cancers (p-value<0.05). In all, DeepProg yields
much better log-rank p-values (Figure 2B) and C-indices (Figure 2C). Additionally, considering that
TCGA datasets might have changed since the time of the SNF publication, we also used the patient
subtypes identified in the original SNF paper on five test datasets, and used them to obtain log-rank
survival subtype p-values

13

. These p-values are all less significant, compared to those obtained from

DeepProg using the same five datasets as the inputs (Supplementary Table 4).

Validation of DeepProg performance by other cohorts
One key advantage of the DeepProg workflow is its ability to predict the survival subtype of any new
individual sample that has some common RNA, miRNA or DNA methylation features with the training
dataset (Figure 1B). DeepProg normalizes a new sample by taking the relative rank of the features and
use them to compute the distances to the samples in the training set (see Methods). To validate the patient

survival risk stratification of DeepProg models, we applied them on additional independent cancer
datasets, two from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cohorts (Figure 3A-B) and four from breast cancer
(BRCA) cohorts (Figure 3C-F). The two HCC validation sets are LIRI dataset with 230 RNA-Seq
samples, and GSE dataset with 221 gene expression array results (see Methods). We obtained a C-index
of 0.80 and log-rank p-value of 1.2e-4 (LIRI), and a C-index of 0.73 and log-rank p-value of 1.5e-5
(GSE), respectively (Figure 3A-B). The four BRCA datasets have C-indices of 0.68-0.73, all with
significant log-rank p-values (<0.05) for survival difference (Figure 3C-F). We thus validated the
predictability of DeepProg by additional HCC and BRCA cohorts.

Identification of signature genes for the worst survival subtypes reveals pan-cancer patterns
In order to identify the key features that are associated with patient survival differences, we conducted a
comprehensive analysis on features in each omic layer that are significantly over- or under-expressed
among the subset of patients with the poorest survival. Next, among the over- or under-expressed features
we selected important features from the input data types whose Wilcoxon rank test p-values are less than
1e-4. For each of these features we computed the univariate Cox-PH regression in each cancer type and
ranked them based on the -log10 (p-values). Upon normalizing these ranks between 0 and 1, we obtained
a pan-cancer rank by summing over all 32 cancer types (see Methods). We describe the results in RNASeq analysis in the following and summarize the results on microRNA and DNA methylation analysis in
Supplementary File 1.
The RNA-Seq analysis shows some emerging patterns of over-represented genes within the poorest
survival group (Figure 4A). CDC20 is ranked first, and some other genes from the cell division cycle
(CDC) family, including CDCA8, CDCA5, CDC25C and CDCA2, are also among the top 100 genes
(Supplementary Table 5). Additionally, numerous genes from the Kinesin Family Member (KIF) (i.e.
KIF4A, KIF2C, KIF23, KIF20A, KIF18A, KIFC1, KIF18B, and KIF14) are present in the top 100 genes
(Supplementary Table 5). The CDC genes

and KIF genes over expression

have been reported

in metastasis process and linked to poor prognosis. Many other genes over-expressed in the poor survival

LGALS1, GLT25D1, CKAP4, IGF2BP3 and ANXA5

24

. Using the ranking values, we clustered the

cancers and the genes and detected two clear gene clusters, enriched with biological functions of cellcycle and mitosis (Adj. p-value= 3e-42) and Extracellular matrix organization pathway (Adj. p-value=6e9), respectively (Figure 4A). In addition, the analysis shows two distinct groups of cancers, where GBM,
HNSC, OV, STAD, COAD, LUSC, and KIRC are in one group, and cancers such as PRAD, PAAD, and
LUAD are in the other group (Figure 4A).
Among the genes that are under-expressed in the poorest survival groups, CBX7 and EZH1 are the top 2
genes (Supplementary Table 5). Down-regulation of CBX7 was shown to play a critical role in cancer
progression

25

carcinogenesis

. Similarly, EZH1 inhibition was shown to be involved in cell proliferation and
26,27

. Additionally, multiple genes in zinc finger family are downregulated (ZBTB7C,

ZMAT1, ZNF18, ZNF540, ZNF589, ZNF554, and ZNF763). ZNF genes are a large family of
transcription factor and many of them were shown relevance in cancer progression 28.

RNA-Seq co-expression network analysis
To characterize further the RNA-Seq gene expression associated with the poorest survival subtypes, we
performed a global gene co-expression analysis. For each cancer type, we selected differentially
expressed genes from the worst survival subtype (Figure 4A) and constructed a pan-cancer consensus coexpression network. As an illustration, we constructed a subgraph of co-expression using the top 200
genes and the most significant edges (Figure 4B), performed gene community detection using randomwalks algorithm

29

. A large fraction of top co-expressed genes overlaps with the top survival genes

highlighted earlier. For example, a tight cluster (group 1) is composed of multiples CDC and KIF genes,
together with BUB1, MCM10, AURKB, CENPA, CENPF, and PLK1. These genes are related to mitosis
and cell cycle pathway (q-value=2e-28). Two clusters (groups 4 and 5) that include multiple collagens are
enriched with extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and receptors function (q-value=2e-16) (Figure
4B). These results follow the conclusions of previous studies highlighting close correlations between

ECM genes, notably SPARC and COL1A1, and tumor invasiveness 30. In addition, the network unveiled
two major groups of genes associated with immunoregulation between lymphoid and non-lymphoid cell
pathway (group 2, q-value=6e-10) and smooth muscle contraction (group 3, q-value=7e-12), respectively.
Similar to signature gene results (Figure 4A), gene-cancer cluster map shows very close similarities
between COAD and STAD on RNA co-expression (Figure 4C), which was observed earlier in features,
and was reported as pan-gastrointestinal cancers from the cancer tissue-of-origin study (Hoadley et al.,
2018).

Similar cancer types can be used as predictive models
Motivated by the similarities observed among some cancers, we explored if the models are suitable for
transfer learning, that is, the model built on one particular cancer type can be used to predict survival of
patients in another cancer type. We tested all pairs of 32 cancers, used alternatively as training and test
datasets.

Many of the cancer models are effective at predicting other cancer types (Figure 5A).

Interestingly, models built on mesothelioma (MESO) data significantly predict the subtypes of 13 other
cancer types, with long-rank p-values ranging from 0.048 to 4.8e-6, and C-indices ranging from 0.58 to
0.82. In general, cancer types that are biologically more relevant have higher predictive accuracies of
cross-cancer predictions, for example, the cancer pair COAD/ STAD, the two close cancer types
identified by the earlier signature gene analysis (Figure 4C). The STAD model significantly predicts the
subtypes of COAD samples (p-value=0.018, CI=0.60) (Figure 5B), and vice versa for the COAD model
prediction on STAD samples (p-value=5.4e-3, CI=0.66) (Figure 5C).

Discussion

In this report, we present a novel and generic computational framework, named DeepProg, which
processes multiple types of omics data sets with a combination of deep-learning (autoencoder) and
machine-learning algorithms, specifically for survival prediction. We have demonstrated several

characteristics of DeepProg, including its superior predictive accuracy over the state-of-the-art method
SNF, its robustness at predicting other HCC and BRCA population cohorts’ patient survival, as well as its
suitability as a transfer learning tool trained from a relevant cancer to predict another cancer.
A few unique mechanistic features of DeepProg contribute to its accuracy. First, it uses boosting
procedures that increase the robustness of the final model, by agglomerating weaker models from
different subsets of the original samples. This design is well adapted to distributed computing
architectures and can be scaled-up easily. Secondly, it employs a modularized design for each omic data
type, and can be extended to other omics and data types. DeepProg first processes each omic data set
individually with autoencoders, and then merge the hidden layer features under a unified Cox-PH fitting –
clustering – supervised classification workflow. The autoencoder structure transforms the initial input
features of various omics types into new features. In this study, we demonstrated DeepProg in integrating
3 types of omics data: RNA-Seq, microRNA-Seq and DNA methylation. Due to the characters of
different types of data, such as sparsity for mutation data, sequential and spatial organization for image
data, other specialized deep-learning models can be developed as individual modules and added to
DeepProg. DeepProg, performed significantly better overall than SNF at predicting patient survival. One
major reason is that SNF doesn’t model patient survival as the objective, rather, it relies on the patterns
from omics solely, to yield insights on phenotypes. Also, as an unsupervised method, SNF lacks the
predict the prognosis of a new samples like DeepProg.
We further used DeepProg to identify global signatures of tumor aggressiveness among 32 types of
cancers. Although previously several pan-cancer studies used one or different omic types to understand
pan-cancer molecular hallmarks 24,31,32, the report here is first of its kind to systematically characterize the
differences between survival subtypes in pan-cancer. We identified the top survival features linked to the
aggressive subtypes and focused on RNA-Seq expression analysis. The pan-cancer gene regulatory
network highlights the top co-expressed genes in the most aggressive subtype of these cancers. Many of
them are related to cell proliferation, extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, and immunoregulation,
confirming earlier results in literatures on cancer invasion 33,34. Such genes are notably linked to the cell-

genes linked to smooth muscle contraction. For example, Calponin gene CNN1, TAGLN, and TMP2 are
co-expressed in different cancers (Figure 4). Also, CNN1, TAGLN and TMP2 were already characterized
as prognostic molecular markers for bladder cancer with higher expression associated with lower survival
37

. Interestingly, various transcription factor families, such as Zinc finger genes are down-regulated and

HOX genes are hypermethylated (Supplementary Table 5). Such observations are supported by previous
reports, as multiple zinc-finger proteins have been shown to act as tumor suppressor genes

38

, and

dysregulation of HOX genes is frequent in cancer as many of them play important roles in cell
differentiation

39

. It will be of interest to follow up experimentally to test their effects. Lastly, through

comprehensive comparison among 32 cancers, the molecular similarities that are clinically (survival)
relevant are revealed. For example, aggressive subgroups from COAD and STAD, two gastroenteric
cancers, present multiple common patterns. We speculate that these relationships can be exploited in the
future to build more robust analyses 40, and help strategize treatment plans by leveraging patient profiles
and cancer similarities.

Methods

TCGA datasets
We obtained the 32 cancer multi-omic datasets from NCBI using TCGA portal (https://tcgadata.nci.nih.gov/tcga/). We used the package TCGA-Assembler (versions 2.0.5) and wrote custom scripts
to download RNA-Seq (UNC IlluminaHiSeq RNASeqV2), miRNA Sequencing (BCGSC IlluminaHiSeq,
Level 3), and DNA methylation (JHU-USC HumanMethylation450) data from the TCGA website on

Assembler, respectively. Then, we processed the data with the functions ProcessRNASeqData,
ProcessmiRNASeqData, and ProcessMethylation450Data. In addition, we processed the methylation data
with the function CalculateSingleValueMethylationData. Finally, for each omic data type, we created a
gene-by-sample data matrix in the Tabular Separated Value (TSV) format using a custom script.

Validation datasets

For breast cancer data, we use four public breast cancer gene expression microarray datasets and one
Metabric RNA-Seq dataset as the validation datasets. Four public datasets (all on Affymetrix HGU133A microarray platform) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Their
accession IDs are GSE4922 42, GSE1456 43, GSE3494

44

and GSE7390 45. Their pre-processing was

described in a previous study 46. For the Metabric dataset, we obtained approval from the Synapse
repository: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn1688369, and used the provided normalized data
described in the Breast Cancer Challenge

47

. The metabric dataset consists of 1981 breast cancer

samples, from which we extracted RNA-Seq data. For hepatocarcinoma datasets, we used two larger
datasets: LIRI and GSE datasets, as described in the previous study 41.

DeepProg framework
DeepProg is a semi-supervised hybrid machine-learning framework that takes multiple omics data
matrices and survival information as the input. For each sample s, the survival data have two features: the
observation time t and the observed event (death) e. The pipeline is composed of the following
unsupervised and supervised learning modules (the details of each step is described in the subsequent
paragraphs). Module 1: unsupervised subtype inference: each input matrix is processed with: a)
normalization, b) transformation using an autoencoder for each omics data type, and c) selection of the
survival-associated latent-space features from the bottle neck layer of autoencoders. The selected
survival-associated latent-space features from all the omics are then combined for a clustering analysis.
Module 2: supervised prediction of a new sample, this module is composed of the following steps: a)

construction of a classifier using the training set, b) selection and normalization of the common features
with the new sample, c) prediction. For both unsupervised and supervised inferences, we use an ensemble
of DeepProg models through boosting approach: each model is constructed with a random subset (80%)
of the training dataset. The clustering and the prediction results are combined according to the relevance
of each model.

Normalization
We first select the top 100 features from the training set that have the highest variance. Then for each
sample, we inversely rank the features and divide them by 100, so that the score is normalized between 0
and 1. Next we compute the sample-sample Pearson correlation matrix of size n, the number of samples.
For each sample, we use the sample-sample distances as new features and normalize it using the rank as
well. As a result, each sample has n features with the score of the first feature equal to 1.0 and the last
feature equal to 0.
To a normalize a new sample (in the model prediction stage), we first select the set of common features
between the new sample and the training set. We then perform the same steps as described above: a)
selection of top 100 features, b) rank-based normalization, c) distance computation with the samples from
the training set, and d) rank normalization.

Autoencoder transformation
An autoencoder is a function

  ’ that reconstructs the original input vector v composed of m

features through multiple nonlinear transformations (

    ᇱ  

). For each omic data type,

we create one autoencoder with one hidden layer of size h (default 100) that corresponds to the following

      /    .
To train our autoencoders, we search the optimal W*, W`*, b* and b’* that minimizes the log-loss
function.
We use python (2.7) Keras package (1.2.2) with theano as tensor library, to build our autoencoders. We
use the Adam optimization algorithm to identify W*, W`*, b* and b’*. We train our autoencoder on 10
epochs and introduce 50% of dropout (i.e. 50% of the coefficients from W and W’ will be randomly set to
0) at each training iteration.

Selection of new hidden-layer features linked to survival
For each of the transformed feature in the hidden layer, we build an univariate Cox-PH model using the R
package survival 48 and identify those with log-rank p-values (Wilcoxon test) < 0.01. We then extract all
the significant new latent features from all autoencoders and combine them as a new matrix Z.

Cancer subtype detection
We perform a gaussian mixture model-based clustering on matrix Z to identity patient clusters (subtypes)
in each cancer. For this we use the GaussianMixture function from the scikit-learn package with 1000
iterations, 100 initiations and a diagonal covariance matrix. The resulting clusters are sorted according to
their median survival levels: the cluster labelled as “0” has the overall lowest median survival, while the
last cluster “N” has the highest survival overall.

Construction of supervised classifiers to predict the cancer subtype in new samples
We use the cluster labels obtained from the above Gaussian mixture model to build several supervised
machine learning models that can classify any new sample, under the condition that they have at least a
subset of features in common with those input features from the training set. First, we compute a KruskalWallis test for each omic type and each feature, in order to detect the most discriminative features with
respect to the cluster labels. Then we select the 50 most discriminative features for each omic type and

combine them to form a new training matrix M. We apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to
construct a predictive model using M as the input and the cluster labels as classes. To find the best hyperparameters of the classifier, we perform a grid-search using a 5-fold cross-validation on M, with the
objective to minimize the errors of the test fold. The algorithm constructs at first a classifier using all the
omic types from the training samples. If a new sample shares only a subset of omics data types and a
subset of the features with the training samples (eg. a sample has only RNA-Seq measurement), then
DeepProg constructs a classifier using only this subset of omics data type and features, before applying it
to the new sample. We use the python sklearn package to construct SVM models and infer the class
probability with the predict_proba function, by fitting a logistic regression model on the SVM scores 49.

Boosting procedure to enhance the robustness of DeepProg
To obtain a more robust model, we aggregate multiple DeepProg models constructed on a random subset
of the training samples. As the default, we use 10 models with 80% of original training samples to
construct all the cancer models, expect for LUSC and PRAD which we use 20 models since they are more
difficult to train. The aggregation of these models (per cancer) works as the follow: after fitting, we
eliminate those models without any new features linked to survival or having no cluster labels
significantly associated with survival (log-rank p-value > 0.05). For a given sample, the probability of
belonging to a particular cancer subtype is the average of the probabilities given by all the remaining
models. We use the class probability of the worst survival subtype to assign the final label. Based on the
initial number of clusters K, we define threshold values such as thres1=0.50 for N=2, thres1=0.33,
thres2=0.66 for N=3 and so on. The final label l of a new sample depends on which interval its class
probability p falls within: l=0 if p < thres1, l=1 if thres1 <= p < thres2, etc.

Choosing the correct input number of clusters and performance metrics
When fitting a model, DeepProg computes several quality metrics: the log-rank p-value for a Cox-PH
model using the cluster labels as described above, the concordance index (C-index) 50, and the Silhouette

score measuring the clusters homogeneity. In addition, DeepProg measures the clustering stability, that is,
the consistence of class labeling among the difference models during boosting. We compute the clustering
as the following: a) For each pair of models, we compute the adjusted Rand Index between the two set of
cluster labels (ARI) 51, b) we then calculate the mean of all the pair-wise rand indexes. For each cancer
models we test different initial number of clusters (K=2,3,4,5). We then select the K presenting the best
overall results based on silhouette score. Furthermore, we also select carefully the K that minimizes the
crossovers on the Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots, when plotting the stratified patient survival groups according
to the cluster labels.

Identification of the differentially expressed features amongst the 32 cancers
To identify the input omics features differentially expressed between the worst survival subtype and
other(s), we perform two-group (worst survival subgroup and the other remaining samples) Wilcoxon
rank-sum test for each feature, using the Scipy.stats package. We then select features significantly overor under-expressed with p-values<0.001. Next, we rank the differentially expressed features among the 32
cancers. For this purpose, we construct a Cox-PH model for each cancer and each significant feature and
rank the features according to their -log10 (log-rank p-value). We then normalize the ranks among these
significant features between 0 and 1, where 1 is attributed to the feature with the lowest Cox-PH log-rank
p-value and 0 is assigned to the feature with the highest Cox-PH log-rank p-value in the set. We then sum
the ranks of each feature among the 32 cancers to obtain its final score.

Construction of the co-expression network
For each cancer, we first identify (at most) the top 1000 RNA-Seq genes enriched in the worst subtype
according to their Wilcoxon rank test p-value. We then use these genes to construct a Gene Regulatory
Network. For each pair of genes (nodes), we obtain an interaction score based on their correlation, and
assign it to the edge between them. For each network, we normalize the scores by dividing them with the
maximal value. We then score each gene with the sum of its edge scores. We combine the network

obtained for the 32 cancers into a global pan-cancer co-expression network, using the GRNBoost2
algorithm from the python package arboreto. Specifically, we use the following steps: a) aggregating the
nodes, node weights, edges, and edge weights of each cancer network into a consensus graph, b) selecting
the top 200 genes and construct its corresponding subgraph, c) performing edge pruning on each gene by
removing all but the top 10 edges, according to their weights, and d)applying a community detection
algorithm on the graph using the random-walk algorithm from the python library igraph, and visualizing
the graph using Gephi 52.

Figure legends
Figure 1 The computational framework of DeepProg
DeepProg uses the boosting strategy to build several models using a random subset of the dataset. In each
model, each omic data matrix is normalized and then transformed using an autoencoder. Each of the new
hidden-layer features in autoencoder is then tested for association with survival using uni-variate Cox-PH
models. The features significantly associated with survival are then subject to clustering with Gaussian
mixture models to identify the optimal number of clusters. Upon determining the optimal cluster, the top
features in the each omic input data type are selected through Kruskal-Wallis analysis (default threshold =
0.05). Finally, these top omics features are used to construct a support vector machine (SVM) classifier,
and to predict the survival risk group of a new sample. DeepProg combines the outputs of all the classifier
models to produce more robust results.
