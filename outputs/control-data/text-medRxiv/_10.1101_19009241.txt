CELL PHONE INTERVENTION

Abstract
Background. Excessive cell phone use contributes to distracted driving, may increase risk for
automobile accidents, and a minority of mobile phone users exhibit behaviors consistent with
technological addiction. The purpose of this study was to determine whether cell phone beliefs
and behaviors could be changed by a brief educational encounter. The Theory of Reasoned
Action provided a lens for viewing attitudes and behavior.

Methods. A one-week pre-post design with a thirty-day follow-up was used with participants (N
= 215, 67.0% female, age = 20.0 + 1.6) assigned to a peer led intervention or comparison groups.
The intervention included cell-phone educational materials. A short index of cell phone behavior
was developed which showed good internal consistency with a Cronbach’s alpha of .81.

Results. The intervention group “agreed” or “strongly-agreed” more than the comparison group
on five of the seven areas of cell phone beliefs and behaviors ( p < 0.05, item Cohen’s d = .32 to
.47, total d = .50) at one-week following receipt of informational materials.

Discussion. We conclude that attitudes and behaviors regarding cell phones are malleable and
susceptible to change in young-adults following a brief psychoeducational intervention.

CELL PHONE INTERVENTION

Introduction
Most citizens of developed countries have access to and use cellphones, or similar mobile
devices, to transfer information and data [1-3]. Cultural demands of the information age require
most users to engage in use of mobile technologies to be a part of employment, education,
recreation, or social-life [4-6]. Additionally, there are socially implied sanctions imposed for
people who do not keep up with and use mobile technology frequently [7]. Mobile phones have
replaced some other devices (e.g. cameras, address book) but may become an object of
attachment [8].
There may also be adverse health consequences associated with cellphone use [9].
Glucose was elevated in the orbitofrontal cortex of adults on the side of the brain adjacent to a
cell phone receiving a call [10]. These neural changes were temperature independent and glucose
was reduced in the temporoparietal junction and anterior temporal lobe of young-adults (age 21
to 29) on the same side as cell phone exposure [11]. There is also an extensive body of data
utilizing electroencephalographs [12]. A meta-analysis identified subtle, but significant,
reductions in sperm motility (-8.1%) and viability (-9.1%) among mobile phone users [13]. Onehour of exposure to a mobile phone to young-adults in their early twenties increased plasma lipid
peroxidases and decreased antioxidant enzymes [14]. Understanding whether these acute effects
increase the susceptibility to certain diseases has been the topic of intense interest [15]. Mobile
phone use does not appear to increase the risk for glioblastoma [16] and microarray studies have
generally been unable to identify a proteomic profile that is beyond what would be expected by
chance [17].
There are several epidemiological findings in this area which include, arguably, the best
established and most consequential risks. There were 3,157 documented automobile fatalities

which involved distracted driving in the U.S. in 2016 and, of these, a cell-phone that was in-use
at the time of the accident for over four-hundred [18]. Even these numbers may be
underestimates as they do not take into account how texting at night contributes to drowsy
driving [19] which could further increase motor vehicle accidents. Two-thirds of adults (age 1865) in the U.S. reported talking on their cell phones and one-third received or sent a text or email
while driving in the past month [20]. Even for the minority who do not choose to use mobile
phones, proximity to the devices carried by their peers and others can impose risks. Non-users
can be the victims of injuries sustained by user inattention [21]. A video game for mobile devices
has resulted in accidents [22]. On the other hand, public health investigations have generally
found that text-messaging interventions can produce positive outcomes for diabetes selfmanagement, weight loss, smoking cessation, and medication adherence [23,24].
There is a behavioral component to wireless technology use that may increase
unintentional injury and mental health issues [25]. Overuse or misuse of this technology may
have parallels to addiction [2, 26, 27] although much further research may be needed to establish
this [28]. People with addictive behaviors are not always able to make rational decisions
regarding that behavior [2, 29, 30]. For some users, an inordinate amount time is spent in nonproductive activities that cut into time spent on healthier endeavors [21, 31].
The millennial generation, born between 1982 and 2002 [32, 33], may have a special
relationship with technology [7, 22]. This is the first generation to grow-up with mobile
information-based technology being likened to adequate educational preparation and success as
an adult [34]. Educational leaders have spent an enormous amount of time, money, and
administrative resources continuously upgrading modern education paradigms to procure
technologically friendly environments [35, 36]. Millennials are more likely than prior

generations to demand and use technology in innovative ways to enhance their lives [37, 38].
However, it turns out that their focus is primarily for social activities rather than academic or
professional which is aided through their use of technology. Millennials, primarily traditional
college age students, spent an average of 14 hours texting, 6.5 hours talking on the phone, and
6.5 hours using social media sites per week with some sending over 200 texts in a day [39].
The Theory of Planned Behavior has been refined by Ajzen and colleagues over the past
four-decades [40-42]. Behavior is viewed as guided by beliefs about the consequences, the
normative expectations of others, and the presence or absence of factors that may impact it.
These behavioral beliefs, normative beliefs, and control beliefs contribute to the attitude toward
the behavior, the subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control, respectively, which together
result in behavioral intention [41]. The Ajzen model has been widely utilized in such diverse
areas as nutrition [43], exercise [44], and responsible drinking [45].
It is currently unknown whether cell-phone attitudes and behavior are modifiable.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the likelihood of behavior change regarding
mobile devices following a brief educational intervention to millennials. This research question
was embedded within the Theory of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior [40-42].

Materials and methods
Participants
The participants were young-adult college students (N = 215, 67.0% female, age = 20.0 +

Research team members held informal meetings to develop reliable quantitative surveys
with items based in concepts from the Theory of Reasoned Action [40-42]. Drafts of each
instrument were piloted using demographically similar non-participant groups.
A comprehensive search of the literature was conducted regarding the potential for
negative health effects associated with cellular phone use including sleeplessness, injury and
other situations and behaviors deleterious to human health. Using these results [6, 10-13, 20, 21,
25, 31, 46 – 50], a brief, one-page educational fact sheet was produced to use as an intervention
tool. When instruments and tools were satisfactory to the research team, approval was obtained
from a university IRB.
A quasi-experimental study design was employed. It was a one-week pre- postintervention design with a subset of participants also completing a 30-day follow-up. Due to the
potential benefits of the intervention, delayed intervention was used with the comparison group
assuring the ethical treatment of all participants. The data collection protocol was determined by
the research team and data collection packets were provided to each data collector. Due to the
public-health (e.g. distracted driving) risks associated with cell-phone use, participants were
assigned to the intervention or comparison groups in an approximately 3:1 ratio. Each data
collection packet held a pre-coded participant log with pre-determined selected numbers
identifying comparison group participants (participant #2, #5, #7, #14, #20, etc.), the informed
consent, and 20 pre- and post-intervention coded surveys to provide identification for follow-up.
The one-page fact sheet was provided to the intervention group immediately after the preintervention survey was completed. The comparison group received it immediately after the
second (i.e. one-month) post-intervention survey (See Appendix A for the instrument). There
were seventeen volunteer data collectors who were trained to gain written informed consent,

administer the survey, and provide the fact sheet effectively. Each data collector was charged to
recruit twenty willing potential participants who would be assigned to either an intervention or a
comparison group. All potential participants were “cold contacts” of the millennial generation
(age < 30) attending a public liberal arts institution in the northeastern United States.
Recruitment commonly occurred in public areas. No incentives were offered for participation.
As part of the pre-intervention survey, demographic and general cell phone information
(cell phone type and basic usage frequency), were collected. The survey also included items
based in the Theory of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior, transitioning from values to
attitude and intention such as: “I believe there may be negative health effects related to cell
phone use” and “I should change some of my behaviors when it comes to my cell phone use”
(Appendix A). One week later, the first post-intervention survey was administered to intervention
and control groups. A subset of both groups completed the post-intervention survey at one-month
after the baseline. The fact sheet was shared with the comparison group members at this juncture
after the second post-test data had been obtained.

Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics were used to describe the characteristics of both groups. We
compared cell phone use and attitudes and intentions for the two groups by calculating the
percentage of agreement with survey items which was analyzed with a chi-square with Yates
correction. Differences between groups on parametric measures were expressed in terms of
Cohen’s d. Variability was expressed as the SD unless noted otherwise. Comparisons between
the intervention versus the control group was analyzed in SYSTAT, version 13.1 (Chicago, IL)
with alpha set at 0.05. Internal consistency was determined with Cronbach’s alpha. A total index
of cell-phone attitudes and behaviors was calculated by summing the seven post-test ratings (1 =

strongly agree to 5 = strongly disagree), with the two negatively worded items reverse scored.
Figures were prepared with GraphPad Prism, version 6.07 (La Jolla, CA).

Results
Participant demographics and baseline characteristics are provided in Table 1. No
demographic or cell phone related variables differed significantly between groups at baseline.
Parametric analysis identified one item (I sometimes miss things going on around me (i.e.
conversations, class lectures, etc.) because I am doing something on my cell phone” at baseline
between the comparison (2.5 + 0.7) and the intervention (2.8 + 0.8, t(210) = 2.85, p < .005) but
no other differences (p > .18). The internal consistency of the 12-item mobile-phone baseline
assessment (questions 1 to 12 in Appendix A) was 0.78.
Figure 1 depicts the mean ratings at the one-week post-test. The intervention scored
significantly lower (1 = strongly agree to 5 = strongly disagree) on three of the five positively
worded items (d = .32, .44, and .35). The fourth item, “I plan to keep my cell phone away from
my body more often”, approached common statistical thresholds (t(213) = 1.93, p = .054). The
two reverse worded items showed the opposite pattern with significantly higher ratings (d = .40
and .47). Non-parametric analyses showed the same general pattern with significant differences
favoring the intervention on four items (Supplementary Figure 1).
The internal consistency of the 7-item post-intervention measure was 0.82. Therefore, a
total index of mobile phone behaviors was created. The Intervention scored lower than the
Comparison (Figure 2, t(210) = 3.16, p < .005, d = .50). The effect size was larger in females (d
= .57) than males (d = .38) but similar in smart-phone (d = .54) and non-smart-phone (d = .47)
users.

At one-month after the baseline, a subset of participants (33.3% of the original control
and 39.4% of the intervention) were reassessed for the second Post-Test. The completers were
1.5 years younger than non-completers (Completers = 19.2 + 1.5, Non-completers = 20.6 + 1.3,
t(213) = 7.41, p < .0005). More completers (79.5%) than non-completers (59.2%, χ2(1) = 8.85, p
< .005) viewed their cell phone as a necessary expense but groups were otherwise
indistinguishable (Supplemental Table 1). There were no differences between the intervention
and comparison on individual items (p > .09) or the total score (p = .32). However, as shown in
Figure 2, the Intervention at one-month was still lower than the Comparison at one-week (t(122)
= 2.62, p < .01). Further, the Comparison at one-month was significantly decreased relative to
the Comparison at one-week (t(82) = 3.61, p < .001). The test-retest correlation between posttests at one-week and one-month was limited for all participants (r(84) = -.04) and within each
group separately (Comparison: r(22) = -.14; Intervention: r(60) = .01). The majority of the
intervention condition agreed that they learned something new from the fact-sheet at the first
(87.1%) and second (65.6%) Post-Tests.

Discussion
This report makes two contributions to the public health and behavioral addiction fields.
First, this controlled study demonstrates that mobile phone use attitudes and behaviors are fluid,
and perhaps, malleable in young-adults. Second, this investigation provide some preliminary
psychometric support for the development of a relatively abbreviated instrument to quantify cell
phone behaviors. The prevalence and use of information technology by millennials in the form of
mobile devices is well established [3, 9, 21]. There is a mounting body of evidence to suggest
that exposure to electromagnetic radiation emitting devices has detectable, and possibly
deleterious, effects on human health and well-being [10, 12, 13, 15, 21, 47, 48, 51, 52] although
see [16, 17]. Currently, the best established public-health risk associated with mobile phones may
be distracted driving [25]. Young-adults, age < 29 were over-represented fatal crashes involving
cell phone use while driving [18]. Sleep is a fundamental neurobiological process but texting is
part of a profile of poor sleep hygiene by many adolescents and young-adults [21, 50, 53]. Lightemitting electronic devices can also reduce melatonin [54]. Many people, especially those from
the millennial generation, find it hard to comport their lives without continuous wireless access.
To date, there is very little available in the popular culture to alert users of any potential
risks. Notably, an early association between cell phone use and brain cancer [15] did generate
some media attention but this association was not substantiated in subsequent research [55].
There are only a few public policies curtailing or prohibiting mobile device use, which occur in
very specific environments (e.g. texting while driving; cell phone use on an airplane or movie
theater or during an educational lecture; near a gasoline pump). Risks are commonly associated
only with special circumstances, in which adherence and enforcement of, may be culturally

subjective. This may send the message that all other use is safe. The present findings that cell
phone attitudes and behaviors can be modified, at least transiently, may be of particular interest
to mental health providers with patients, or their family members, interested in reducing their
mobile phone use [27]. Further, the development of cell phone interventions may be useful for
individuals caught repeatedly violating laws prohibiting texting and driving.
While the majority of time spent on mobile devises is for social or recreational reasons
among millennials, they also use their mobile devices as tools for all manner of information and
navigation throughout their day (e.g. social media, email, clocks/calendars, GPS, audio and video
entertainment). The feasibility of curtailing that multi-faceted usage has not yet been well
established. This investigation identified a small-moderate effect size with a brief-intervention at
a short (one-week) interval.
Although not the primary objective, this study also adds to other findings to develop
other abbreviated measures of problematic cell phone use [56-59]. A Smartphone Addiction
Inventory has been developed for cell phone users that can read Mandarin which showed
excellent internal consistency and very good two-week test-retest reliability in a primarily male
young-adult sample [60]. The internal consistency of both the baseline and Post-Test instrument
used in this effort was sufficient. However, this was not the case for the test-retest reliability.
However, as only a minority of participants were available for the one-month Post-Test, any
inferences regarding the data at this interval (correlations or means) should be made with great
caution.
Some additional limitations and future directions are also noteworthy. First, although the
participants in this controlled study provided evidence that they changed their cell phone use
behaviors, and this post-intervention pattern appeared to be persistent (relative to the comparison

group at one-week), the endpoints measured were based on self-report. Future efforts to reduce
phone use could also incorporate more objective measures like phone bills or an application that
records mobile phone use [61]. Second, the participants were young-adults and
disproportionately female. As high-school and college-age students have the highest mobile
phone usage [21], and some data indicates that females have more problematic cell phone use
patterns [50, 53], we view the sample characteristics as a strength of this report. However,
additional longitudinal studies will be necessary to further characterize the persistence of mobile
phone attitudinal and behavior changes following interventions. This investigation was
completed with a normative sample of young-adults. More intense, and repeated, interventions
may be needed for individuals with more excessive, and problematic, mobile-phone attitudes and
behaviors [27].
In conclusion, this investigation provides evidence that cell phone use can be modified, at
least temporarily, in young-adults.
