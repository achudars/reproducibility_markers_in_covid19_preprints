Abstract
Background. Frailty is a strong predictor of adverse aging outcomes. However, the longitudinal
drivers of frailty are not well understood. This study aimed at investigating the longitudinal
trajectories of a frailty index (FI) from adulthood to late life and identifying the predictors of the
level and rate of change in FI.
Methods. An age-based latent growth curve analysis was performed in the Swedish Adoption/Twin
Study of Aging (N=1,842; aged 29-102 years) using data from up to 15 measurement waves across
27 years. A 42-item FI was used to measure frailty at each wave.
Results. A bilinear, two-slope model with a turning point at age 65 best described the age-related
change in FI, showing that the rate of increase in frailty was more than twice as fast after age 65.
Underweight, obesity, female sex, overweight, being separated from one’s co-twin during
childhood, smoking, poor social support and low physical activity were associated with a higher
level of FI at age 65, with underweight having the largest effect size. When tested as timevarying predictors, underweight and higher social support were associated with a steeper increase
in FI before age 65, whereas overweight and obesity were associated with less steep increase in
FI after age 65.
Conclusions. Predictors for the level and rate of change in frailty are largely actionable and could
provide targets for intervention. Underweight increased the risk of higher FI trajectory until age
65, whereas being overweight or obese were associated with slower progression of frailty
towards the oldest ages.

Introduction
Frailty is an age-related condition of sizeable public health importance. It is characterized by
increased vulnerability to multiple adverse outcomes, such as disability, hospitalization, and
mortality (1). The importance of increased screening and identification of the risk factors among
community-dwelling adults has been stressed by recent research (2). However, despite the wealth
of research devoted to understanding frailty, its life-course determinants remain poorly understood.
Previous research has shown that lifestyle factors in midlife, such as low physical activity (3),
sedentary life style (4) and obesity (5) are associated with an increased risk of frailty in old age,
but life-course predictors of the rate of change are less well understood and limited to individuals
aged 65 years and older (6,7). As recent research by others (8) and us (9-11) suggests that an
increase in frailty exhibits a relatively greater mortality risk in younger and middle-aged adults
than in old individuals, it is pertinent to identify the determinants of frailty trajectories as early as
possible to be able to target the driving forces.
There are several approaches to assess frailty, the Fried frailty phenotype (FP) (12) and the
frailty index (FI) developed by Rockwood et al. (13) being the most frequently used ones. The FP
views frailty as a physical syndrome and categorizes individuals as robust, pre-frail, and frail based
on exhaustion, weight loss, weak grip strength, slow walking speed, and low energy expenditure.
The FI is a continuous scale measure that can be constructed from various health-related items,
including a minimum of 30 variables that meet the standard criteria (13). Provided that a range of
different health domains are included, the FI captures the multidimensional nature of frailty. While
both measures predict adverse aging outcomes (14,15), the FI is more sensitive in identifying risks
at the lower (healthier) end of the frailty continuum (16,17), and thus is better suited for younger
adults.

In the present study, we aimed to add to the understanding of the longitudinal development
of frailty and its predictors with a up to 27 years follow-up and 15 waves of repeated measurements
in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA; age range 29-103 years at enrolment). As
the development of frailty is a highly multifactorial process and often occurs over a longer period
of time and, predictors across various domains were considered and simultaneous changes in key
predictors were accounted for.

Methods
Sample
SATSA is a longitudinal program in gerontological genetics (18). The participants are same-sexed
twins, where some twin pairs have been reared together and some separated before age 11 and
reared apart. SATSA was initiated in 1984, ended in 2014 and is comprised of nine questionnaires
(Q) and ten in-person testing (IPT) waves. Data collection periods are presented in the Supplement
(eFigure 1). New participants in IPT waves were enrolled up until IPT5. SATSA data collection,
sampling procedures and the data sets until the seventh Q and seventh IPT have been previously
described and are publicly available (19). The present study includes data from 1987 to 2014, from
all Q and IPT waves except Q1, IPT1, IPT4 and Q6 (from which an FI could not be constructed),
yielding 15 measurement waves. In total, 1,842 individuals (1,074 women, 768 men; 654 complete
twin pairs) participated. The number of waves the individuals participated in ranged between one
and 15 (mean 5.2, standard deviation [SD] 4.0), where 1,324 individuals (71.9%) participated in
three or more waves and 523 (28.4%) participated in seven or more waves.

A Rockwood-based FI has previously been created and validated for SATSA(10), and contains 42
self-reported health deficits such as diseases, symptoms, mood and activities in daily living
identically constructed across the 15 waves. The FI variables and their scoring are presented in the
Supplement (eTable 1). The deficits across the items were scored and the FI was defined as the
sum of deficits divided by the number of deficits considered. For example, an individual having 8
deficits had an FI of 8/42=0.19. Although the theoretical maximum of the FI is 1, over 99% of
individuals in almost every study cohort have an FI<0.7, indicating that accumulation of deficits
beyond this point is lethal (20).
Sex was coded as 0=female and 1=male. The birth cohort was coded as 0=born prior 1926
and 1=born 1926 or later, reflecting the division of the old and the middle cohort in the Swedish
Twin Registry (STR) (21). Rearing status was coded as 0=reared apart before age 11 (reference)
and 1=reared together. Educational attainment and childhood social class were derived from the
first questionnaire in 1984 and the STR. Educational attainment was coded as 0=basic education
(<7 years; reference) and 1=higher education (≥7 years). Childhood social class, based on selfreported parental occupation for the rearing parents, was coded as 0=unskilled manual employees,
1=skilled manual workers, lower non-manual employees, and farmers, 2=self-employed
(excluding professionals), 3=intermediate non-manual workers and 4=higher non-manual workers,
including professionals (22). Information about smoking and partner status were derived from the
first measurement occasion at which an FI was obtained. Smoking status was coded as 0=nonsmoker, 1=former smoker and 2=current smoker, and treated as ordinal in the analysis.. Partner
status, which included both marital and non-marital spouse, was coded as 0=no partner (reference)
and 1=has partner. Information about body mass index (BMI) was collected at each measurement
occasion, calculated as self-reported weight divided by height squared (kg/m2), and categorized as
follows: 0=normal weight (18.5≤BMI<25.0; reference category), 1=underweight (BMI<18.5),

2=overweight (25.0≤BMI<30.0) and 3=obese (BMI≥30.0). Social support, which was available in
Q2, IPT2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q7, Q8 and Q9, was a standardized continuous score (min -26.8, max 20.6)
containing information about the participant’s relationships to friends and relatives (23). A negative
score indicated low social support, whilst a positive score indicated high social support. Leisure
time physical activity, available in IPT3, Q4, Q5, Q7, Q8 and Q9, was a standardized, continuous
score (min 31.4, max 72.4) in which a higher value corresponded to higher physical activity (24).

Statistical analysis
An age-based latent growth curve model (LGM) was used to assess the longitudinal trajectories in
the FI and to identify the determinants for the level and the rate of change in the FI. In LGM, each
observation (FI measurement) is a function of a latent intercept, one or several latent slope(s) and
random error. The model estimates both a mean trajectory for the entire sample (fixed effects) as
well as intra- and interindividual variation around this trajectory (random effects). In this study,
variation around the mean trajectory was estimated on three levels. Level 1 constituted the
observations. Level 2 and 3 constituted the participants and the twin pairs, respectively. Due to
convergence issues, however, we omitted the random slopes for level 3 (twin pairs) and only
included a random intercept for level 3. Detailed description of the LGM is provided in the
Supplement (eMethods and eFigure 2). Correlations between the FI values across waves were
analyzed using Spearman’s rho.
The raw FI trajectory plots were produced in RStudio (R v.3.4.1; Boston, MA: RStudio Inc.)
using ggplot2 (25) (v.3.1.0). To identify the best-fitting functional form (linear, quadratic or
bilinear two-slope) to model the change in the FI, age-based unconditional growth curve models
were performed in Stata v.15.1 (College Station, TX: StataCorp LP) using the mixed command.

Best fit was assessed by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC) values, where smaller fit statistics indicate better fit.
Sex, birth cohort, rearing status, educational attainment, smoking, childhood social class,
partner status, BMI categories, social support and physical activity were tested for their
associations with the intercept and the rate of change, which was assessed using a bilinear trajectory
with two slopes (see Results). A sensitivity analysis on rearing status was performed to assess
whether the degree of relatedness, based on the relationship of the rearing individuals to the twin,
is associated with the FI. Information on the degree of relatedness to rearing individuals was
available for 1,546/1,842 individuals (83,9%) of whom 935 were in pairs who were reared together,
173 were reared by biological parents (while the co-twin was adopted away), 148 were adopted to
relatives and 290 were adopted to non-relatives. Twins reared together were considered as the
reference category.
Social support, physical activity and BMI categories were available across several waves
(see previously) and hence were additionally tested as time-variant covariates (eMethods and
eTable 2). In this model, the associations with both the intercept and slopes were tested using timevarying covariates (social support, physical activity and BMI categories). Smoking status,
childhood social class, social support and physical activity were centered at their mean so that the
modelled intercepts represent the expected value of FI for an average person in the sample. The
BMI categories underweight, overweight and obesity were contrasted to normal weight, as frailty
and BMI exhibit a U-shaped association with both high and low BMI increasing the risk of frailty
(26,27).
Due to the skewed distribution of the FI (left-skewed, data not shown), natural logarithm
(ln) of the FI was used in the LGM. Prior to normalization, a constant of 0.01 was added to all FI
values to facilitate the transformation of values FI=0. For graphical visualization of the FI

trajectories, lnFI values were back-transformed to the original FI scale. Significance level was set
to α=0.05.

Ethics
All participants have given their informed consent. The SATSA study was approved by the
Regional Ethics Review Board in Stockholm (Dnr 80:80, 84:61, 86:148, 98:319, 2007/151-31,
2010/657-31/3), 2015/1729-31/5).

Results
Table 1 provides descriptive information about the study sample at the effective baseline (Q2)
where the majority (N=1,477; 80.2%) of the analysis sample had data available. Characteristics of
the study sample at each wave are presented in the Supplement (eTable 3). Characteristics of the
study sample based on the number of waves the individuals participated in are presented in the
Supplement (eTable 4). In comparison to individuals with less than seven complete waves,
participants in seven or more waves tended to be younger and more educated, have higher levels
of social support, and a lower FI. They were also more likely to have a partner compared to those
participating only once or twice. A correlation matrix for the FI across the waves is presented in
the Supplement (eTable 5). Most of the correlations were >0.5, and ranged from 0.57 to 0.86
between adjacent waves.
Comparison of the fits of the models based of lnFI (Supplement; eTable 6) indicated that a
bilinear two-slope model with an inflection point (intercept) at age 65 years provided the best fit to
the data. In this model, the first slope (hereafter denoted as slope 1) represents the change in the FI
until the age of 65 and the second slope (hereafter denoted as slope 2) represents the change from
this age onwards (Figure 1b). For estimation of the bilinear trajectory, the model used individuals

with three or more observations. Individuals with fewer than three data points only contributed to
the estimation of the intercept. 1,324 participants (71.9%) participated in at least three waves; thus,
they contributed to the estimations of all three latent factors (intercept, slope 1 and slope 2).
The estimated growth curve models using the bilinear fit are presented in Table 2 (only
fixed effects are shown). The same models including the random effects are presented in the
Supplement (eTable 7). The unconditional (unadjusted) growth model demonstrated that the mean
level of lnFI at age 65 years (i.e., the intercept) is -2.57 (corresponding to FI=0.07 on the
untransformed scale) and the yearly increase is 0.014 until the age of 65 years and 0.038 after the
age of 65 years (Table 2, Model A). Individual raw trajectories for the untransformed FI by age
and the estimated bilinear two-slope model for the FI trajectory are presented in Figure 1. The same
trajectories but based on the lnFI are presented in the Supplement (eFigure 3).
In Model B (Table 2), the following time-invariant covariates (baseline/first available
measurement used) were associated with lower levels of frailty at the age 65: male sex, having a
partner, higher social support and higher leisure time physical activity. Being reared apart,
underweight, overweight, obese and smoking were associated with higher levels of FI at age 65.
Baseline social support and overweight were also associated with the rate of change; higher social
support was associated with a steeper increase in FI before age 65 and overweight was associated
with slower increase in FI after age 65. Birth cohort was not associated with the FI, and childhood
social class and educational attainment were not significant after addition of other covariates so
they were excluded from the model. In the sensitivity analysis for the degree of relatedness (based
on Model B) where rearing status was replaced with the degree of separation, only those who were
adopted to non-relatives had significantly higher FI levels (beta=0.13, standard error [SE]=0.049,
p=0.009) compared to those reared together. Twins who stayed with their biological parents while
their co-twin was adopted away (beta=0.04, SE=0.058, p=0.5) and twins who were adopted to

relatives (beta=0.08, SE=0.06, p=0.2) did not have significantly higher FI levels compared to twins
reared together. In Model C that was based on Model B (Table 2), social support, physical activity
and BMI categories were tested simultaneously as time-varying covariates. Variables that were
associated with the level of FI in this model were akin to Model B, with the exception that partner
status was no longer significant and thus excluded from the model. For the associations with the
rate of change in FI, higher social support and underweight were associated with a steeper increase
in FI before age 65, whereas overweight and obesity were associated with a less steep increase in
slope 2 (Table 2, Model C). Physical activity was not associated with the slopes, so its interaction
terms with age were excluded from the model. FI trajectories (with lnFI values back-transformed
to the original FI scale) based on this model by time-varying measures on social support and BMI
categories are presented in Figure 2. Same trajectories but using the lnFI are presented in the
Supplement (eFigure 4).
Across all the models A-C, there was significant inter-individual variation in the FI
trajectories (Supplement; Random effects in eTable 7). The positive covariance between intercept
and slope 1 and negative one between intercept and slope 2 indicted that individuals having a
steeper rate of increase up to the age of 65 years have higher FI levels at the inflection point but
after that their rate of increase is relatively decreased. The negative covariance between the two
slopes, although not statistically significant in Model C, likewise indicated that those having a less
steep increase up to the age of 65 years catch up after that. However, random effects for the slopes
between twin pairs (level 3) could not be assessed due to convergence issues, so the models only
included a random intercept for between-pair effects (Supplement; eTable 7).

Discussion
This study investigated the developmental trajectories and determinants of FI over an extended
period: from adulthood into very old age. The population trajectory indicated a moderate increase
up to the age of 65 years – an inflection point after which the increase in FI more than doubled. In
a model using baseline measurements for all the predictors, female sex, being reared apart
(separated from one’s co-twin in childhood), not having a partner, smoking, low physical activity,
underweight, overweight, obesity and poor social support were associated with a higher level of
frailty at age 65 (i.e., intercept). Higher baseline social support was also associated with a faster
increase in FI before age 65, reflecting only a catch-up growth (convergence) though, as higher
social support was associated with a lower FI level at age 65. Baseline overweight was associated
with a slower increase in FI after age 65. To address simultaneous changes in the predictors and
FI, we extended the model by including time-varying, repeated measurements of social support,
physical activity and BMI categories. In this model, higher social support and underweight were
associated with a faster rate of increase in the FI before the age of 65 years, and overweight and
obesity were associated with a slower rate of increase in the FI after age 65. The decelerated rates
of change in FI for those who were obese or overweight were large enough to make the trajectories
of FI cross over the FI trajectories for normal weight persons after age 85. Physical activity showed
no associations with the rate of change, and having a partner was no longer associated with the
level of FI in this model.
Frailty has been traditionally regarded as a syndrome of the old, and longitudinal studies
into frailty trajectories including younger individuals or covering the entire adult lifespan are
scarce. With repeated measurements of FI up to across 27 years, our study provides new insights
into the developmental trajectories of frailty. The fact that we observed a turning point for the FI
trajectory at age 65, after which the rate of change more than doubles, suggests that an effective

window for prevention might be well before old age. Our estimates for the level and rate of change
after age 65 are comparable to those reported in the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam for
individuals aged 65+, where they used lnFI in the modeling akin to us (6). However, comparing
our (back-transformed) estimates to those for the Swedish population in the Survey of Health,
Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), suggests somewhat lower estimates in our study (28).
The SHARE study modeled the rate of change as a single slope for individuals aged 50 and older,
which may partly explain the differences. More studies into frailty trajectories covering the entire
adult lifespan are nevertheless needed to resolve whether our findings on the bilinear growth and a
tipping point at age 65 are generalizable to other populations.
As predictors of frailty have rarely been analyzed in longitudinal settings using repeated
measurements both of frailty and the predictors, the results of our study add to the understanding
of the independent predictors of frailty. Many of the factors that we found to predict higher levels
of frailty, such as female sex, underweight, overweight, obesity, smoking, poor social support, low
physical activity and not having a partner have also been identified in previous studies (6,7,26,27).
Some studies have also identified low socioeconomic position and lower education associated with
higher FI (6,28). In our study, socioeconomic position and education were however not associated
with the level of FI after inclusion of other predictors, suggesting that other risk factors may
override socioeconomic adversity. As a new risk factor for frailty, we identified being separated
from one’s co-twin in childhood to be associated with higher FI levels. Sensitivity analysis for the
degree of relatedness to rearing individuals indicated that in comparison to twins reared together,
only those who were adopted to non-relatives had significantly higher FI levels, although there was
a suggestive trend towards increasing FI levels with increasing degree of relatedness.
Socioeconomic adversity alone is unlikely to underlie the association as those non-relative families
that could adopt a child at the time were likely wealthier than the families that gave away their

child for adoption. The higher FI among the adoptees may thus reflect early life stress, caused by
being separated from one’s biological family. A similar finding on childhood stress and frailty was
recently reported in the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study; those men who were evacuated abroad
unaccompanied by their parents in childhood during World War II had a higher risk of frailty
(measured using the FP) in late life compared to non-separated men (29). However, this study
found no associations in women. These findings nevertheless call for more research into how
different types of childhood stressors may increase the risk of frailty.
Our results are in general in agreement with previous findings on a U-shaped relationship
between BMI and the level of frailty (26). Although frailty is partly viewed as a “wasting
syndrome” and malnutrition in old age is an established risk factor for it (30), there is a paucity of
longitudinal studies looking specifically into underweight and frailty. Our approach using repeated
measurements for both FI and BMI allowed us to disentangle this relationship. We not only
identified underweight as a major risk factor for higher FI at age 65, but also found an association
between time-varying underweight and a faster increase in FI before age 65. The number of
underweight individuals in our study was, however, low at baseline and decreased further in the
subsequent waves, decreasing our chances to detect potential associations with the rate of change
after age 65. The very large effect sizes between underweight and the level and rate of increase in
the FI (before age 65) nevertheless indicate that underweight is a key driver of frailty.
Time-varying overweight or obesity were not associated with the rate of change in FI before
age 65 but both were associated with a slower increase after age 65. At the age of 85, deceleration
rates were large enough to cross over the FI trajectory for normal weight individuals, indicating
that older persons being overweight or obese had the fewest frailty deficits. However, as our
observations started to get sparse from age 90 onwards, our projections cannot be used to infer
whether the decelerated rates would result in significantly lower levels of FI for overweight and

obese individuals at the oldest ages. Existence of potential biases, for example due to mortality
selection and involuntary weight loss, calls for cautious interpretation. Pertaining to the latter, the
category of normal weight (at any given measurement occasion) contains those who are constantly
lean as well as those that have lost weight due to disease, making this group potentially
heterogeneous in terms of health status. Weight loss, especially in old age, commonly occurs as a
result of underlying pathology, which per se may be accompanied with increase in frailty. Although
less common in old age, high muscle or lean body mass may in turn sometimes manifest as
overweight, and being “fat and fit” as opposed to “lean and unfit” has been considered beneficial
for some age-related diseases (31-33). Whether such obesity paradox exists for frailty in very old
age is unknown. Results from the Helsinki Businessmen Study lend partial support against it (34).
They analyzed the association between incident frailty at mean age ~79 (measured using the FP)
and past weight trajectories, and found no protective effect of being constantly overweight or
gaining weight (BMI <25 in the beginning and ≥25 in the end) (34). Instead, they found that those
who lost weight (BMI ≥25 in the beginning and <25 in the end) had a higher risk of incident frailty
compared to constantly normal weight (34). The role of underweight was nevertheless not
specifically assessed in this study as none of the men had a BMI <18.5 in midlife.
Interventions based on physical activity have thus far shown most promise in preventing or
reversing frailty (35). Although we found that both baseline and time-varying physical activity
were associated with lower FI at age 65, the effect size was rather modest and there was no
association with the rate of change. One potential explanation is that since this was an observational
study, cross-time changes in physical activity are likely to be more subtle than in interventional
studies, and a bigger effect size would probably be required to detect significant associations with
the rate of change. In addition, physical activity was available only in 6/15 of the measurement
occasions, decreasing the number of available repeated measurements. It is also possible that other

factors, such as BMI, are stronger in their independent effects, and that there are interactions, such
as moderation, between BMI and physical activity. Partially supporting this assertion, a study using
latent growth curve analysis on (physical) frailty has shown that obesity has a stronger effect on
the progression of frailty in those older individuals who have low physical activity (7).
This study has some limitations. The FI and covariates are based on self-reported data.
However, regarding BMI, a previous study in SATSA has demonstrated high correlations (≥0.93)
between self-reported and measured BMI and that the misclassification of BMI based on selfreported data is stable over time (36). As pertinent to all studies with long follow-ups into old age,
individuals who were younger, less frail and had more favorable values in the covariates provided
more measurement occasions, and thus contributed more to the estimates. Moreover, our results
cannot be used to infer the direction of the changes between frailty and the predictors. The apparent
strengths of this study include the very long follow-up, covering the entire period from adulthood
into very old age, ample measurement occasions and availability of a wide array of covariates that
enabled us to identify independent predictors of frailty.
In conclusion, our study finds that the predictors for the level of frailty are largely
modifiable and could thus be considered as targets for intervention. The association between
adoption status and frailty however warrants more research to resolve whether it mostly taps into
early life stress or also captures socioeconomic circumstances. As underweight appeared as a driver
for increased rate of change before age 65, targeting undernutrition in adulthood might prove useful
in preventing future frailty. Any interventional strategy might nevertheless have their effective
window before the sharp increase in the rate of change at age 65. Lastly, further studies are needed
to resolve whether having extra weight confers some protection against progression of frailty in
the advanced ages.
