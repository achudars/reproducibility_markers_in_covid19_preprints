Abstract
Background and Objective: Paralytic Ileus (PI) is the pseudo-obstruction of the intestine
secondary to intestinal muscle paralysis. PI is caused by several reasons such as overuse of
medications, spinal injuries, inflammation, abdominal surgery, etc. We have developed an early
mortality prediction framework that can help intensivist, surgeons and other medical
professionals to optimize clinical management for PI patients in terms of optimal treatment
strategy and resource planning.
Methods: We used publicly available ICU database called MIMIC III v1.4, extracted patients
that had paralytic ileus as primary diagnosis over the age of 18 years old. We developed FLAIM
Framework a two-phase model (Phase I: Statistical testing and Phase II: Machine Learning
application) that was compare to traditional methods of machine learning. We used five different
machine learning algorithms to test the validity of our Framework. We evaluated the
effectiveness of the proposed framework by comparing accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, and area under the curve (AUC) for each
model.
Results: The highest improvement in AUC of 7.78% was observed due to application of the
proposed FLAIM method. Additionally, almost for all the machine learning models,
improvement in accuracy was also observed. With the FLAIM framework, we recorded an
accuracy of 81.30% and AUC of 81.38% under support vector machine (with RBF kernel) model
in predicting mortality during a hospital stay for the PI patients
Discussion: Our results show promising clinical outcome prediction and application for
individual patients admitted to the ICU with paralytic ileus after the first 24 hours of admission.
Key Words: Paralytic Ileus, mortality prediction, machine learning, MIMIC III

1. Introduction and Background
Paralytic ileus (PI) or intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a rare disorder of the intestine which is
characterized by the paralysis of the intestinal peristalsis without any machinal cause. This leads
to an impaired movement of food or fecal matter along the gastrointestinal tract [1]. Diagnosis is
made clinically and it can present with symptoms like abdominal bloating, pain, nausea,
vomiting and constipation as initially described by Dudley et al [2]. PI is caused by either
primary or idiopathic dysfunction of gastrointestinal motility (acquired or inherited mutations)
[3]. Additionally, it could be due to abdominal and/or pelvic surgery [4], systemic lupus
erythematosus [5], scleroderma [6], Parkinson’s disease [7], infections [8], medications like
opioids and antidepressants [9], radiation to the abdomen [10] and malignancies lung cancer
[11]. Unfortunately, paralytic ileus has a poor clinical outcome [12] and an early prediction could
be helpful for care delivery.
The mortality of patients with PI can be as high as 40% [13] in the ICU setting. Patients
admitted to the intensive care are especially at risk of dying because of the seriousness of their
condition. Some of these ICU may have additional risks associated when these patients undergo
colonic decompression [14] and while providing bowel rest with reduced food intake [15]. With
this in mind, it becomes important to have an approach that can predict the risk of mortality in
these patients and help clinicians in making a decision faster and allocate adequate resources to
these patients.
The MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) database is a freelyavailable, large database that has de-identified patient data associated with more than forty
thousand patients that were admitted to the critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center between 2001 and 2012 and developed by the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) [16]. This dataset has been used to predict mortality for multiple diseases
[17]. In this paper, we utilized risk factors that are based on laboratory test results in order to
predict mortality in PI patients.
To obtain an optimal mortality risk prediction performance, we proposed an automated
framework called FLAIM. The proposed FLAIM framework works in two phases. In the first
phase, it uses Cox-regression (univariate and multivariate) and Kaplan-Meier analysis based
statistical methods to find out a relevant (reduced) set of risk factors while the second phase
explores the feasibility of different machine learning models which are used for classification
purposes. Machine learning models are provided with some training data, the model learns a
hypothesis i.e. a fitting function denoted by h(x) by optimizing error achieved on the training
data. Thus, the model learns the behavior of the distribution of the data by analyzing the training
data set. The model performance i.e. the performance of the learned hypothesis function is tested
on the unseen testing data. The main objective is to construct such a model that would show
better performance on the training data and would also generalize to unseen data i.e. the testing
data. Hence, such a constructed model can be deployed in hospitals for predictions in future.
In this paper, we have explored the hybridization of six different machine learning
models with the above-mentioned statistical models that are utilized for evaluating most relevant

(reduced) set of risk factors. The machine learning models used for mortality prediction of PI
patients include linear discriminant analysis (LDA), (GNB), Decision Tree (DT) model (also
known as CART in literature), K nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machines (SVMs)
with linear and radial basis functions (RBF). Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a method
used in statistics, pattern recognition and machine learning (ML) to find a linear combination of
features which characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events [18]. SVM has
been used in bioinformatics fields for its excellent performance in classification by drawing a
hyperplane [22] [23]. A hyperplane is a line that divides two classes where each labeled data lay
on one side. To separate classes, there may be many possible hyperplanes that can differentiate
instances, however, the goal is to find an optimal hyperplane that has a maximum margin or
maximum distance from the data points of both classes [20,24]. When the samples are not
separable then an error term is considered as cost function that leads to poor classification.
Regularization methods are used to deal poor classification issues such as overfitting and
underfitting.
In addition to the classification models stated above, in FLAIM we have also used
Decision Tree model. A decision tree has nodes (attributes) and edges which make a machine
processable tree-like structure which helps to build a parseable logic that leads to a decision,
where edges are the outcomes of the split to the next node. The root node performs the first split,
whereas leaves, terminal nodes predict the outcome. Entropy and information gain are the
mathematical methods that have been used for the splitting of nodes [25]. Another machine
learning model used for mortality prediction of PI patients is GNB model. It uses Bayes theorem
of probability for prediction of unknown class. Usually, three approaches have been used for
classification in Naive Bayes. 1) Gaussian: It assumes that continuous features follow a normal
distribution, 2) Multinomial: When features are discrete, 3) Bernoulli: When features are binary
[26,27][28] is most frequently non-parametric methods used in data science. In kNN, (k) is the
number of nearest neighbors where unknown instances or data-points are classified based on the
nearest known instances in the feature space. The instances which are close to each other are
more likely of the same class. Distance between instances is commonly measured using the
Euclidean distance [29]. The principal of kNN during training is to store all data points then the
prediction algorithm calculates the distance from new data-point (x) to all points in the data and
finally assigns the instance to that class which has the shortest distance.

2 Methods
2.1 Study Type: Retrospective investigation of clinical electronic health records
2.2 Participants: The data was obtained from a publicly available database to researchers called
MIMIC III. The was collected by many different intensive care units including surgical, trauma
surgery, medical, coronary and cardiac surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
(BIDMC), Boston, Massachusetts from 2001-2012. All patients’ records are completely
anonymous, and all the data collected has received a prior Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approval from BIDMC and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The institutional IRB
requirement was waived because the database is HIPAA-complaint deidentified and our study
complies with the ethical standards set by the Helsinki declaration (1964) and its amendments
[16]. This database contains clinical parameters from de-identified ICU admission patients to the
above mentioned.
We selected all patients using the ICD-9 code for paralytic ileus (560.1) [30] from all and
extracted all the data from the rest of the datasets including initial labs, demographic
information, ICU stay data, microbiological reports, and prescription information. We excluded
calculated the age using the date of birth and date of admission and remove all patients that were
under the age of 18 for this analysis.
2.3 Testing methods: Initial labs for the first day of ICU admission were extracted from the data
set using the MIMIC code available for public access repository on GitHub, which included
hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cells, platelets, serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium,
chloride, bicarbonate), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose, anion gap, lactate,
bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time (PT), partial-thromboplastin time (PTT) and international
normalization ratio (INR). All of these labs were expressed as minimum and maximum values
for each blood marker, we calculated the average and subdivided the values into either normal
range and abnormal values. Reference ranges were used to calculate these values and can be seen
in Table 2.
2.4 Analysis: We have developed the FLAIM (Fahad-Liaqat-Ahmed Intensive Model) a
machine learning framework for the early mortality risk prediction of patients with the PI
disease. Our proposed framework works in two phases (Figure 1).

generate two lists of risk factors i.e. full-risk-factors list (22 variables) and reduced-risk-factors
list (15 variables) based on the statistics that were performed.
The cox-regression analysis [32] gives us the hazard ratio for these risk factors which can be
used in conjunction with the Kaplan-Meier analysis [33] to make a rank order list of these
variables ranked from highest to lowest; two lists were generated full-risk-factors list (22
variables) and reduced-risk-factors list (only statistically significant results were used, 15
variables). The reduced set of risk factors that are obtained based on the statistical methods, they
are supplied to different machine learning models for classification. The outcome of this phase
can be viewed in Figure 3.
Phase II: In this phase, different machine learning models are applied to risk factors that have
been found significant in Phase I, and higher weight can be given to the variables/risk factors
based on hazard ratios as shown in Table 3. During the second phase, the data (risk factors) is
partitioned in two parts i.e., training and testing datasets (Figure 4). The training dataset with risk
factors or feature vectors denoted by X_train along with the label information denoted by
Y_train are supplied to the machine learning models. The machine learning models analyze the
distribution of the training data and tries to learn a hypothesis function i.e., a fitting function that
would represent the behavior or distribution of the whole dataset. In the next step, the
performance of the trained or learned machine learning model is tested by considering the testing
dataset. During the testing process, only feature vector or risk factors denoted by X_test is
supplied to the trained or learned machine learning model, the model predicts the label based on
the learned knowledge or rules from the training data. The predicted labels are compared with
the true labels of samples of the testing dataset and based on the comparison, the prediction
accuracy is evaluated.

3.1 Participants: We used the complete list of risk factors (full list) and a selected list of risk
factors (reduced list) (Table 3.) to predict outcome in the test-set using Linear Discriminant
Analysis, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, K-Nearest neighbor and support vector
machines (Supp 1.) In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we used the
publicly available MIMIC III dataset. A total of 1021 patients’ data were extracted from the
original dataset of the MIMIC III database that were diagnosed with PI. All the patients were
above the age of 18 years of age at their first admission. The median age of patients was 63.2
years, most of the people that were admitted to the ICU were women (63.8%) and mostly
Caucasian (74%) from all the ethnic groups. These patients had a median stay of 14.5 ± 16.2
days of hospital stay and 4.2 ± 10.7 days of intensive care stay. Emergency admission comprised
of most admission making 76.7% of all patients that were admitted to the ICU while most
admissions came through referrals around 490 patients (48%). Mortality among these patients
was 16.8% (173), while 441 (43.2%) were transferred out to different health facilities and 407
(40%) patients were discharged home. All of this can be seen in Table 1.

3.2 Analysis Participants: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of these blood markers revealed that
at
at the first 24 hours of ICU admission labs show a relationship between better overall survival
al
during these patient’s hospital stay. The largest difference between median patient survival was
as
seen with abnormal vs normal anion gap (37 vs 129 days(d)) a difference of 92 days. Serum
m
abnormal vs normal bicarbonate (55d vs 129d), PT (55 vs median not reached (MNR)), BUN
N
(51d vs MNR), bilirubin (37d vs 67d), creatinine (57d vs 78d), PTT (54d vs 67d) and platelets
ets
(55d vs 66d) were also significant (Table 2, Figure 4 and Figure 5). Showing abnormalities of
these markers lead to worse patient survival during their hospital stay in these patients.
These results were used to make an ordered list of risk factors that affect patient outcomes from
m
most to least as described in table 3. We used previously established machine learning
ng
algorithms as shown in supplemental 1.

RBF model developed under FLAIM architecture.
Subsequently, we used two third (2/3) i.e., n=684 samples for training the machine learning
ng
models while one third of the dataset (n=337) for testing purposes. The results for each machine
ne
learning model is presented in Table 3. Our assessment of the algorithm was based on testing set
accuracy sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve (AUC) to assess for the best
est
algorithm. As in machine learning, the quality of output of a model is judged by AUC, hence, we
utilize the AUC and accuracy as the primary evaluation metrics for selecting optimal model

under the proposed FLAIM architecture. Our best algorithm SVM RBF on reduced risk factors

yielded highest AUC of 81.38%, testing accuracy of 81.30%, training accuracy of 83.18%,
%,
sensitivity of 35.59%, a specificity of 91%. The second-best algorithm was LDA with AUC of
82.02%, testing accuracy of 70.32%, training accuracy of 69.59%, sensitivity of 83%, a

5. Discussion
Paralytic ileus although a rare but a morbid and fatal condition [34] and almost 16.8% mortality
to all patients that were admitted to the ICU in our patient population. For that reason, it becomes
important to identify patients that may be at risk of dying during their ICU stay. Out dataset
revealed that the majority of admitted patients are elderly individuals with a median age of 63
years [34–36]. In this cohort of patients, we observed labs which were performed in the first 24
hours to predict overall survival. The best predictors of patient survival were serum anion gap
(37d vs 129d), bicarbonate (55d vs 129d), PT (55d vs MNR), BUN (51d vs MNR), bilirubin (37d
vs 67d), creatinine (57d vs 78d), PTT (54d vs 67d) and platelets (55d vs 66d). While other labs
like serum chloride, hematocrit, hemoglobin, white blood cells, and albumin were nonsignificant. The abnormal initial anion gap is associated with adverse outcomes in admitted to
the ICU [37] which is also seen in the study as well. Similarly, abnormal potassium[38]
bicarbonate [39] , BUN [40] , bilirubin [41], creatinine [42], platelets [43]. Abnormal
coagulation studies in a patient with sepsis have shown worse outcomes in ICU patients. We
considered patients with age > years along with their demographic information such as gender
and ethnicity and prepared a final list of all risk factors and further ranked them according to
their severity (Table 3).
In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid model, we developed two
types of experiments. In the first experiment, we utilized the conventional machine learning
models such as LDA, GNB, DT, KNN, and SVM as baseline using full set of risk factors. In the
second experiment, the same machine learning models were hybridized with the statistical
models using the proposed FLAIM method (see Figure 1). The main objective of developing two
different types of experimental settings was to validate the fact that the proposed hybrid method

is capable of reducing the complexity of machine learning models as well as enhancing their
predictive performance. The performance comparison or evaluation of the two experiments were
carried out from two aspects i.e. using mortality prediction accuracy and ROC curve to yield
AUC. Both the accuracy and AUC are well used metrics to evaluate a model performance.
Therefore, these two-evaluation metrics were exploited for comparison of the proposed methods
with baseline methods.
From Table 3, the improvement in AUC of conventional machine learning (baseline)
models can be observed. The baseline models and their AUC have been reported in red and the
AUC for the corresponding proposed or developed methods (under FLAIM architecture) have
been reported in green color. It can be seen that the optimal performance is obtained with SVM
RBF model as it yields accuracy rate of 81.30% and AUC of 81.38% which is better compared to
the other baseline and proposed methods. Additionally, the constructed model has another
benefit of lower complexity i.e., it uses reduced set of risk factors. This means if we provide risk
factors (serum lactate, BUN, PT, anion gap, creatinine, INR, bilirubin, potassium, PTT,
bicarbonate, platelets, sodium, glucose, Age more than 65 years and gender) the model will
correctly predict ~81% of the time if the patient will die during their hospital stay or not. Other
models that showed potential similar results but were less accurate than the optimal model, were
LDA (reduced risk factors), DT (reduced risk factors) and SVM (Linear) with full risk factors
and reduced set of risk factors. To effectiveness of the proposed SVM (RBF) under FLAIM
architecture is validated by observing the AUCs in Figure 4 of conventional SVM (RBF) and the
proposed version of SVM (RBF). The AUC of conventional SVM RBF is 78.89% while the
AUC of the proposed SVM RBF is 81.38%, hence, the improvement of 2.49% can be observed.
Similarly, the ROC charts for each model (conventional and proposed) are depicted in Figure 3
(see supplementary section). For almost all the models, the improvement in AUCs can be
observed due to application of the proposed FLAIM architecture. Hence, our proposed
framework could potentially facilitate the critical care physicians in determining which patients
are at the highest risk of mortality while their hospital stay and should be treated with more care.
Our future direction is to develop a more sophisticated model that incorporates more
clinical parameters and has a higher AUC and accuracy of predicting clinical outcome for
paralytic ileus patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Further experiments are required to
evaluate the performance of the proposed framework with different age groups in different
clinical situations.

6. Conclusion
FLAIM is a statistically robust machine learning framework which is developed for clinical use
to predict mortality risk in PI patients. The mortality prediction was modelled based on clinically
relevant labs or risk factors that were collected from the PI patients during their first 24-hours of
stay in the intensive care unit. Experimental results evidently show that the proposed method
reduces the complexity of conventional learning models by effectively reducing the number of
risk factors and also improves the predictive performance and output quality of conventional

machine learning models. From the simulation results, it can be safely concluded that the
proposed method can also be expanded in the future to predict mortality and other risks
associated with the ICU admitted patients for various diseases.
