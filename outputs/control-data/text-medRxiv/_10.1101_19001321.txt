Abstract
Background
The use of the 12-lead ECG is common in UK paramedic practice but its value depends upon accurate
placement of the ECG-electrodes. Several studies have shown widespread variation in the placement
of chest electrodes by other health professionals but no studies have addressed the accuracy of
paramedics. The main objective of this study was to ascertain the accuracy of the chest lead
placements by registered paramedics.
Methods
Registered paramedics who attended the Emergency Services Show in Birmingham in September
2018 were invited to participate in this observational study. Participants were asked to place the chest
electrodes on a male model in accordance with their current practice. Correct positioning was
determined against the Society for Cardiological Science & Technology’s Clinical Guidelines for
recording a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (2017) with a tolerance of 19mm being deemed
acceptable based upon previous studies.
Results
52 eligible participants completed the study. Measurement of electrode placement in the craniocaudal
and mediolateral planes showed a high level of inaccuracy with 3/52 (5.8%) participants able to
accurately place all chest leads. In leads V1 - V3, the majority of incorrect placements were related to
vertical displacement with most participants able to identify the correct horizontal position. In V4, the
tendency was to place the lead too low and to the left of the pre-determined position whilst V5 tended
to be below the expected positioning but in the correct horizontal alignment. There was a less defined
pattern of error in V6 although vertical displacement was more likely than horizontal displacement.
Conclusions
Our study identified a high level of variation in the placement of chest ECG electrodes which could
alter the morphology of the ECG. From a patient safety perspective, we would advocate that
paramedics leave the chest electrodes in situ to allow hospital staff to assess the accuracy of the
placements.

Introduction
International guidelines for the management of patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of an
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) recommend that a 12-lead ECG be recorded by attending emergency
medical service (EMS) personnel prior to hospital conveyance.[1-4] The recording of a prehospital
ECG has become increasingly common in sophisticated Prehospital EMS Systems and has been
shown to significantly increase the proportion of patients who receive Primary Percutaneous Coronary
Intervention (PPCI) within 90 minutes of calling the EMS, and to increase the number of ST-elevation
Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) patients who receive fibrinolytics in hospital within 30 min of
arrival.[5] Patients who receive a prehospital ECG also exhibit significantly lower hospital and 30day mortality rates than those who did not with most of the differences attributable to significantly
lower rates of mortality in STEMI patients.[5] However, the patient benefit that can be derived from
the prehospital recording of a 12-lead ECG is reliant upon the ability of EMS personnel to recognise
STEMI, or to have access to telemetry to allow another healthcare professional to make the decision,
and to accurately place the ECG electrodes. Studies have investigated the ability of EMS personnel to
interpret 12-lead ECG recordings in cases of STEMI,[6-9] but none have explored the ability of EMS
personnel to correctly place the electrodes.
Incorrect positioning of precordial electrodes presents a risk to patients as it can lead to morphological
changes in the ECG,[10-12] with subsequent misinterpretation. The risks are that a patient may
receive potentially harmful therapeutic procedures or may encounter a delay in the administration of,
or potentially the withholding of, beneficial therapeutic procedures. Accuracy of precordial electrode
placement has been studied with other health professionals and has highlighted varying degrees of
accuracy. Rajaganeshan et al.[13] found that the correct position for V1 was identified by 90% of
cardiac technicians, 49% of nurses, 31% of physicians (excluding cardiologists) and only 16% of
cardiologists. This study also saw a frequent malposition of V5 and V6. Medani et al.[14] found that
only 10% of participants (doctors, nurses and cardiac technicians) correctly applied all of the leads
with the most common errors being the placement of the V1 and V2 leads too superiorly, and the V5
and V6 leads too medially. McCann et al.[15] found clinically significant variability in the
identification of standardized precordial electrode positions among senior emergency clinicians. From
these studies, we hypothesised that there was likely to be a high level of inaccuracy in the placement
of the precordial electrodes by EMS personnel.
Methods
The primary objective of this prospective observational cohort study was to identify the accuracy of
precordial lead placement by UK registered paramedics. Participants were recruited at the Emergency
Services Show in Birmingham, UK on the 19-20 September 2018. Participants were eligible if they
were on the Health and Care Professions Council register (paramedic) at the time of the study, and
trained and authorised to record and interpret 12-lead ECGs in the out-of-hospital setting. Recruitment
was through posters displayed at the show, promotion by the College of Paramedics (UK professional
body) at their seminar sessions, and through word of mouth at the show. Participants were provided
with an information sheet and a briefing from the researcher, with an opportunity to ask questions.
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before data were collected. Data were
anonymised and information on the performance of individual participants was not made available to
anybody outside the research team.
Participants provided professional demographic information relating to their length of experience as a
paramedic, the recency of their practice, their academic route to qualification (university route or

vocational route), whether they had a specialist role, and the time since their last formal training on
ECG electrode placement. Information was collected electronically through the Jisc Online Survey
tool (https://www.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/) which allocated a unique identifier to each participant and
removed the need to collect person identifiable information. Participants were then asked to place the
6 precordial electrodes on to the chest of a human male model in accordance with their current
practice. Before measurement, participants were asked to confirm that they were satisfied with their
positioning and were offered an opportunity to make an adjustment if they felt it necessary. Following
placement of the electrodes, participants were asked to mark the lead placements on a diagram of
bony landmarks with the anterior, mid-, and posterior axillary lines marked on for reference. They
were also asked to state, in writing, the landmarks that they used when placing the electrodes and the
anatomical positions where each electrode should be positioned. This would allow for comparison
between underpinning knowledge and physical performance; only the data from the lead placement is
reported here.
Prior to participant enrolment, the correct placements had been pre-determined by two paramedics
and an advanced clinical practitioner in accordance with the Society for Cardiological Science &
Technology’s 2017 Clinical Guidelines for recording a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram.[16] To
maximise the accuracy of our lead placement, we followed precisely the guidelines, measured the
mid-clavicular point with a tape measure for V4 accuracy, and had confirmation from an advanced
clinical practitioner who was not directly involved with the study. We used a transparent overlay
sheet to mark the exact position of our electrodes. The overlay was attached to the model using
Transpore™ tape and the position of the corners was marked on the model’s chest using a fine marker
pen. The corners of the overlay could then be re-located against the marks and, for consistency, the
same researchers placed the overlay into position and completed the measurements. The overlay was
pre-printed with 5 mm boxes to assist with the visualisation of the measurement. We used Skintact®
FS-50C electrodes as they were typical electrodes for ambulance service use and had a centrally
placed connector which was used as a consistent measuring point. Deviation from our positioning was
recorded in the craniocaudal (vertical) and mediolateral (horizontal) planes with a deviation of 19mm
deemed to be within an acceptable tolerance based on previous studies. Data were input into
Microsoft® Excel and then plotted on a scatter graph to show dispersal from the centre point of our
electrode. SPSS (version 25.0.0.1, SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA) was used to undertake a Twotailed Pearson Bivariate correlation to establish relationships between the placement of leads across
vertical and horizontal planes.
Ethics
Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Wolverhampton Research Ethics Committee.
Results
52 eligible participants completed the study. 43 (82.7%) declared no specialist role, 7 (13.5%) said
they had a specialist primary care role, one had a critical care paramedic role and one had a role as an
ambulance service training officer. The majority (62%) had between one and four years of operational
experience as a paramedic and over 86% of participants were current in practice at the time of the
study. The route to first registration was mainly via higher education as 43 (82.7%) had either a
foundation degree, diploma of higher education or BSc/BSc (Hons) in a paramedic subject. The
remaining participants had either followed the vocational route to qualification (15.4%) or a
Certificate of Higher Education (1.9%). Only four (7.7%) held a higher degree in clinical practice.

Table 2. Range of electrode placements (mm) from pre-determined reference point
The positions of the electrodes are shown in Figure 1. There was substantial variation in the
positioning of all electrodes, with patterns of incorrect displacement emerging in leads V1 - V5. In
leads V1 and V2, the majority of errors were related to the electrodes being positioned too high on the
chest. The majority (75% for V1 and 67% for V2) were able to place the electrode correctly on the
horizontal plane. The highest displacement for both V1 and V2 would have placed the electrode in the
second intercostal space.
In V3, the majority of incorrect placements were related to vertical displacement with most
participants (87%) able to identify the correct horizontal position. In V4, the tendency was to place the
lead too low and to the left of the pre-determined position with only one placement being displaced
too high. Placement of V5 tended to be below the expected positioning although 77% were able to
correctly identify the correct horizontal placement. There was a less defined pattern of error in V6
although vertical displacement was more likely than horizontal displacement in terms of absolute
numbers and degree of error.
Further analysis of data sought to establish correlation between the placement of leads across vertical
and horizontal planes. A Two-tailed Pearson Bivariate correlation was undertaken; these are presented
in Table 3.

Discussion
In this study, we found significant variation in the placement of the chest electrodes by registered
paramedics. Incorrect positioning of electrodes has been well established as a cause of artefact on the
ECG, [17– 21] which poses risks to the patient. Patients may receive treatment that is potentially
harmful and unnecessary, or they may have appropriate treatment withheld; there is the additional risk
of non-conveyance of a patient who should be transported to hospital and the potential danger created
by inappropriate transport under emergency conditions. Correct placement of ECG electrodes is also
important for reproducibility and diagnosis where serial comparison is undertaken.
Previous studies with other health professionals have identified common misplacement of leads V1
and V2 [13, 17] with a similar pattern reflected in our study. Placement of both of these leads tended
to be significantly higher than the recommended placement with many electrodes situated within the
second or third intercostal space. Walsh, [17] has demonstrated that the ECG resulting from such
misplacement may generate erroneous patterns such as incomplete right bundle branch block,
anterior T wave inversion, septal Q waves, or ST-segment elevation.
The identification of anatomical landmarks is important for the correct placement of electrodes but
many participants in our study did not seek to formally identify these landmarks. This meant that
when V1 was incorrectly placed, V2 would be incorrectly placed in a mirror image. The correlation
shown between electrodes V1 and V2 is suggestive that electrode placements were influenced by
previous electrode location rather than on identification of anatomical landmarks. For electrodes V2,
V3 and V4, it would be expected that a high positive correlation would exist given that V3 is
positioned midway between V2 and V4. This was the case in the vertical plane although the
relationship between electrodes was not as strong as would have been expected; the reason for this is
unclear. As V2 was incorrectly placed in a high number of cases in our study, it follows that V3 was
also misplaced. Electrodes V4-V6 should be placed at the same horizontal level so again, a high
correlation would be expected in the vertical plane. Correlation was strong in these electrodes, but this
led to propagation of inaccuracy as misplacement of one electrode influenced misplacement of
subsequent electrodes.
We carefully considered our choice of model as other studies have identified obesity and modesty in
females as factors linked with poor chest electrode placement. [11, 22] Our chosen model was a male
subject of medium build with easily identifiable landmarks so did not present with the complexities of
female or obese patients; it is postulated that our results would have revealed greater placement
inaccuracy had our model been overweight or female. We do not yet fully understand why there was

poor adherence to standard electrode placement in our study, although we did observe that many
participants did not locate landmarks prior to placing the electrode. Our second paper (in progress)
seeks to understand whether participants knew the correct positions but were unable to translate these
to the human body, or whether there is misunderstanding of the correct placement locations.
Our sample size was relatively small, which will impact the generalisability of the results; however,
our findings are similar to those from previous studies involving other health professionals and it does
suggest a pattern of inaccuracy that causes concern. From a patient safety perspective, we would
advocate that paramedics leave the chest electrodes in situ; this will allow hospital clinicians and/or
ECG technicians to assess the accuracy of the placement and either utilise the same positioning for a
comparative ECG recording, or disregard the findings of the prehospital ECG.
Conclusion
Our study identified a high level of variation in the placement of chest ECG electrodes by UK
registered paramedics. It is not known to what extent, if any, incorrect placement has resulted in
incorrect ECG interpretation or patient management but the inaccuracy by our study participants was
high and likely to cause morphological changes that could impact on patient treatment. It also raises
questions as to the reliability and replication of findings of ECGs from patient to patient and as serial
recordings over time for any given patient. We recommend that the prehospital ECG electrodes are
left in situ to reduce the risk of unreliable comparative ECG recordings.
Work is needed to understand why this is happening, but emphasis needs to be placed on the
importance of identifying landmarks during initial and refresher training.
Limitations
Our sample size was small and was recruited through a convenience sampling strategy. It is possible
that the sample may not be reflective of the wider paramedic population in the UK or internationally
but the results do reflect patterns of inaccuracy that have previously been identified in studies
involving other health professionals
