Title: Safety of Flexible Sigmoidoscopy in Pregnant Patients with Known or Suspected
Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Abstract:
I.

Background and Aims

Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy is the gold standard for the diagnosis and staging of
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). However, there is limited safety data in pregnant
populations, resulting in conservative society guidelines and practice patterns favoring
diagnostic delay. The aim of this study is to investigate if the performance of flexible
sigmoidoscopy is associated with adverse events in pregnant patients with known or suspected
IBD.

II.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the University of California San Francisco
(UCSF) between April 2008 and April 2019. Female patients aged between 18 and 48 years
who were pregnant at the time of endoscopy were identified. All patient records were reviewed
to determine disease, pregnancy course, and lifestyle factors. Two independent reviewers
performed the data abstraction. Adverse events were assessed for temporal relation (defined as
within 4 weeks) with endoscopy. Any discrepancies in the two reviewers’ data were reviewed by
a third independent investigator. Descriptive statistics of data were calculated, and comparison
of continuous and categorical data were made using a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test and
Fisher’s exact test, respectively.

III.

Results

We report the outcomes of 48 pregnant patients across all trimesters who underwent lower
endoscopy for suspected or established IBD. There were no hospitalizations or adverse
obstetric events temporally associated with sigmoidoscopy. 78% of patients experienced a
change in treatment following sigmoidoscopy. 12% of the patients with known IBD were found to
have no endoscopic evidence of disease activity despite symptoms.

IV.

Conclusions

Lower endoscopy in the pregnant patient with known or suspected IBD is low risk and affects
therapeutic decision making. It should not be delayed in patients with appropriate indications.

Introduction
The pregnant woman with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) presents
management challenges to the treating physician. Among women with IBD at the time
of conception, 36% of Ulcerative Colitis (UC)1 and 33% of Crohn’s Disease (CD)2
patients will experience an increase in disease activity. Active disease is associated
with increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion,
preterm birth, and low birth weight.3-4 Accurately establishing the presence and severity
of IBD activity during pregnancy in the symptomatic patient is a critical juncture in
decision making.

There are several challenges in accurately establishing the presence and severity of
IBD activity during pregnancy. Due to physiologic changes and alterations in
gastrointestinal motility, pregnancy often presents with a myriad of gastrointestinal
symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation, hemorrhoids and diarrhea, that mimic
symptoms of an IBD flare.5 The noninvasive modalities of assessing for evidence of
inflammation – such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein – lose their
predictive value in pregnancy.6-7 While levels of fecal calprotectin (FCP) have been
shown to be elevated in pregnant patients with IBD, there is currently no established
cut-off for FCP that effectively predicts disease activity in the pregnant IBD patients.7
Furthermore, several meta-analyses have suggested that there is a significant false
positive rate, which in the pregnant patient would lead to inappropriate exposure to
escalated IBD therapy.8-10 As such, an endoscopic evaluation is critical in accurately
staging the severity of IBD in pregnancy and avoiding delay in care.

Potential risks associated with endoscopy during pregnancy include fetal hypoxia from
increased intra-abdominal pressure during endoscopy. Hence, the American Society of
Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) currently recommends that endoscopy be
postponed to second trimester whenever possible.11 However, delayed diagnostic workup of a suspected IBD flare in a pregnant patient has serious consequences, as does
empiric therapy with biologics and immunosuppressants.

Based on the paucity of studies studying the use of lower endoscopy in pregnancy,
larger numbers are needed to fully understand the risks versus benefits of lower
endoscopy in pregnant IBD patients. The aim of this study is to investigate if the
performance of flexible sigmoidoscopy is associated with adverse events in pregnant
patients with IBD.

Methods:

A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the University of California San
Francisco (UCSF) between April 2008 and April 2019. Institutional ethics approval was
obtained (IRB 18-26237). Structured EHR data was extracted from the UCSF Epic
system using Clarity and Caboodle tools7. Prior to being used for this study, the data
was de-identified to comply with the US Department of Health and Human Services
‘Safe Harbor’ guidance. This database was queried to identify female patients aged
between 18 and 48 years inclusive bearing diagnosis codes corresponding to IBD,
melena, hematochezia, or diarrhea and procedure billing codes corresponding to lower
gastrointestinal endoscopy. Additional patients were separately identified from a
database of endoscopic reports using keyword-based search (see Supplemental
Methods). All records meeting the above criteria were subsequently assessed by two
independent reviewers (MK, PA) to confirm pregnant status at the time of lower
gastrointestinal endoscopy.

Eligible patient records were further reviewed to determine disease, pregnancy course,
lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol use, bowel preparation, and pregnancy
outcomes. All adverse events were assessed for temporal relation (defined as within 4
weeks) with endoscopy. Any discrepancies in the two reviewers’ data were further
reviewed by a third independent investigator (VAR).

Descriptive statistics of continuous data were calculated as means and medians with
standard deviation and interquartile ranges (IQR), respectively. Categorical data were
reported by absolute numbers and percentages. Comparisons of continuous data were
made using t-tests with unequal variance for normally-distributed data, or the Wilcoxon
rank-sum test otherwise. Comparisons of categorical data were calculated using
Fisher’s exact test.
Results:

In total, 48 pregnant patients underwent 47 flexible sigmoidoscopies and 3
colonoscopies. 41 (85%) of these patients had a previous diagnosis of IBD (7 Crohn’s
Disease, 34 Ulcerative Colitis). Median maternal age was 33 years [IQR: 30.1-35]
(Table 1). Sedation was used in 5/50 (10%) procedures and 86% had biopsies.
Monitored anesthesia care was present in 3 cases (2 colonoscopy and 1
sigmoidoscopy). Median sigmoidoscopy scope insertion was 30 cm [range: 15-40]. A
total of 8 endoscopies were performed in the first trimester, 26 in the second, and 16 in
the third trimester.

There were no hospitalizations or pregnancy adverse events temporally associated with
flexible sigmoidoscopy in either IBD or non-IBD patient groups. One intrauterine fetal
demise between 30-34 weeks gestational age (GA) (procedure at 10 weeks GA) and
one elective termination in the second trimester (procedure at 13 weeks GA) occurred in
the IBD group, but were not temporally or etiologically thought to be related to the
sigmoidoscopy. Median GA at birth was 39 weeks in the IBD group [IQR 2] and 40.2
weeks in the non-IBD group [IQR 0.9, p=0.03]. Rates of caesarean section delivery
were 32.4% and 16.7% in IBD and non-IBD women, respectively (Table 2, p=0.6).

In the IBD group, 88.4% of women had evidence of disease activity at the time of
flexible sigmoidoscopy, with 62.7% of women showing evidence of moderate to severe
disease. For the 20 women who were found to have severe disease, 11 women (55%)
were started on biologics for the first time, 1 woman (5%) underwent a switch in her

biologic therapy, 6 women (30%) were started on systemic steroids, and 1 woman
underwent a proctocolectomy during pregnancy (Table 3). Conversely, for the non-IBD
pregnant patients who underwent a lower endoscopy, 5 patients (71.4%) were
diagnosed with internal hemorrhoids, and the rest had normal endoscopic findings. No
incident cases of IBD were diagnosed in this group.
Discussion:

The mainstay of caring for women with IBD of childbearing age is careful preconception
counseling and optimization of medical therapy to ensure steroid free clinical remission
of at least 3 months prior to conception.3 Despite best efforts, however, many women
with IBD experience worsening of their disease activity during pregnancy. The current
ASGE guidelines recommend deferring lower endoscopy to second trimester or to the
post-partum period; however, risks of IBD disease activity to the pregnancy call for
timely endoscopic evaluation. This is why the American Gastroenterology Association
Pregnancy Care Pathway recommends unsedated, unprepped flexible sigmoidoscopy
as needed in any trimester in the patient with IBD.3

The safety of endoscopy was previously studied in a nationwide population-based
cohort study by Ludvigsson et al.12 This studied 3052 pregnancies exposed to upper
endoscopies, lower endoscopies, or endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatographies, and showed that exposure to any endoscopic procedure
during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth and small for
gestational age, independent of trimester. However, studies specifically studying the
pregnant IBD patient population, which has increased rates of spontaneous abortions
and pregnancy-related complications than their non-IBD counterparts, have been few
and small in size. A matched case-control study of 42 IBD patients published by De
Lima et al.13 reported two spontaneous abortions that were thought to be temporally
related to lower gastrointestinal endoscopy. However, the authors noted that the
spontaneous abortion rate was higher in the control population of IBD patients not
undergoing endoscopy, and overall reported no increased adverse outcomes for the

mother or fetus in any trimester. Consistent with prior studies, our work – the largest
study to date of pregnant patients with known or suspected IBD undergoing flexible
sigmoidoscopy – supports the safety of flexible sigmoidoscopy as a diagnostic
procedure for patients with strong indications. An unsedated, unprepped flexible
sigmoidoscopy without obstetric monitoring was found to be low risk and not associated
with any maternal or fetal adverse events. These results reflect the combined
experience of 11 different endoscopists and capture all trimesters of pregnancy. In total,
approximately 78% of patients experienced a change in their therapy following the lower
endoscopy.

In higher-risk groups such as pregnant patients presenting with red-flag symptoms, the
decision to proceed with diagnostic lower endoscopy is frequently contrasted with noninvasive alternatives such as fecal calprotectin. Although the fecal calprotectin is a
commonly-used biomarker for IBD, its sensitivity and specificity are insufficiently precise
to be used as a primary diagnostic tool for IBD7-10,14, let alone to make major therapy
changes in the gravid patient. We note that 15% of the patients in this cohort had
“negative” lower endoscopic findings. Changes in bowel habits and hemorrhoids are
common in the pregnant patient, and these results highlight the importance of
confirming the diagnosis prior to initiation or escalation of immunosuppression.

In line with previously published data, pregnant IBD women in this cohort had higher
rates of Cesarean section delivery than their non-IBD counterparts. This finding is
similar to the results of large population-based studies that showed that women with
IBD have a 1.5 to 2-fold increase in the rate of Cesarean delivery.15-17 The pregnant IBD
women were also noted to have a slight reduction in median gestational age at birth by
1 week compared to their non-IBD counterparts. While this was a statistically significant
difference, it is not a clinically significant one - both groups of women had a median
gestational age of at least 39 weeks, a clinical timepoint after which adverse neonatal
outcomes are seen to decrease.17

This study is limited by its sample size and retrospective nature. The absolute risk of
adverse events following sigmoidoscopy in the general population is small, and as such
our study is insufficiently powered to estimate these risks in this special population. We
cannot exclude the possibility of confounding bias relevant to the decision of which
patients should undergo lower endoscopy. Moreover, we note that this study was
carried out at a tertiary care medical center with expertise in both IBD and Obstetrics.

In spite of these limitations, this study contributes significant additional case experience
to the literature on this understudied and vulnerable population. Although pregnancy is a
common phenomenon in the general population, interventional clinical studies in this
group are rare precisely because of the risks – whether perceived or real. Although this
attitude reflects an appropriate sensitivity towards this group, the gaps in knowledge
and risk-adverse climate in clinical practice can paradoxically lead to overly
conservative guidance and lower-quality care. In the absence of controlled trials, we
suggest that cohort studies such as this are essential to demystify the perceived risks of
medically necessary procedures and increase awareness and engagement by both the
clinical and research communities. We hope subsequent guidelines will reflect this
approach.

In conclusion, this study adds to the growing body of data supporting the safety of lower
endoscopy in pregnant patients presenting with signs and symptoms concerning for
new-onset or worsening Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Lower endoscopy in women with
IBD during all trimesters of pregnancy is of low risk for mother and child. When
indicated, this procedure should not be deferred as it directly impacts the medical
decision making needed for optimal obstetric and gastrointestinal outcomes.
