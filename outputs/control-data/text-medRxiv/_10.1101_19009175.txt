Abstract
Background—The goals of this study were: assess left-and right-sided subcutaneous
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) eligibility in adult congenital heart disease
(ACHD) patients, use machine learning to predict S-ICD eligibility in ACHD patients, and
transform 12-lead ECG to S-ICD 3-lead ECG, and vice versa.
Methods—ACHD outpatients (n=101; age 42±14 y; 52% female; 85% white; left ventricular
ejection fraction (LVEF) 56±9%) were enrolled in a prospective study. Supine and standing 12lead ECG was recorded simultaneously with a right- and left-sided S-ICD 3-lead ECG. Peak-topeak QRS and T amplitudes, RR, PR, QT, QTc, QRS intervals, Tmax, and R/Tmax (31 predictor
variables) were tested. Model selection, training, and testing were performed using supine ECG
datasets. Validation was performed using standing ECG datasets and out-of-sample non-ACHD
population (n=68; age 54±16 y; 54% female; 94% white; LVEF 61±8%).
Results—A 40% of participants were ineligible for S-ICD. Tetralogy of Fallot patients
passed right-sided screening (57%) more often than left-sided (21%; McNemar's χ2 P=0.025).
The ridge model demonstrated the best cross-validation function. Validation of the ridge models
was satisfactory for standing left-sided [ROC AUC 0.687 (95%CI 0.582-0.791)] and right-sided
[ROC AUC 0.655(95%CI 0.549-0.762)] S-ICD eligibility prediction. Out-of-sample validation
in the non-ACHD population yielded a 100% sensitivity of the pre-selected threshold for the
elastic net model. Validation of the transformation matrices showed satisfactory agreement (<0.1
mV difference).
Conclusion—Nearly half of the contemporary ACHD population is ineligible for S-ICD.
Machine-learning prediction of S-ICD eligibility can be used for screening of S-ICD candidates.

Introduction
A subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) is a life-saving device that
prevents sudden cardiac arrest in vulnerable patients.1 The approval of the S-ICD for use in the
United States is significant because of the benefits it has over the traditional, transvenous ICD,
which include the lack of risk for vascular occlusion, systemic infection2, and the adverse effects
of lead extraction.3 S-ICD can be especially advantageous in adults with congenital heart disease
(ACHD) patients who may have limited or no venous access to the heart, and in whom there is
increased risk of systemic embolism when a persistent shunt is present.4, 5 These individuals are
often at increased risk for sudden cardiac arrest that is higher in ACHD compared to the general
population6 and frequently require thoracic surgery to place an epicardial ICD system. ACHD
patients may face multiple generator changes in their lifetime, making an S-ICD a viable option
due to its less-invasive placement. The 2017 AHA/ACC/HRS Guidelines7 for the prevention of
sudden cardiac arrest in ACHD patients recommend S-ICD use when feasible.
S-ICD requires electrocardiographic (ECG) pre-screening before implantation to assess
sensing. S-ICD screening involves the recording of a special 3-lead ECG with ECG electrodes
placed in the locations of S-ICD sensing electrodes, as advised by the manufacturer.8 This
additional step may negatively impact the utilization of S-ICD.9 Lack of confidence is the most
common barrier for referral10 among physicians, and the perceived strength of the physician
recommendation is the most common theme associated with ICD refusal among primary
prevention candidates.11 Conversely, a 12-lead ECG is readily available and easy to obtain.
Therefore, using a conventional 12-lead ECG as the tool for pre-screening eligibility would
greatly improve a physician’s confidence and recommendation to suitable patients.

Our group recently developed a screening tool to predict left-sided S-ICD eligibility from a
12-lead ECG.12 However, validation of this screening tool in an out-of-sample population has not
been performed. Moreover, in ACHD patients, right-sided S-ICD implantation may improve SICD eligibility.13 However, very little data is available regarding right-sided S-ICD eligibility
predictors in ACHD patients. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether it is feasible to
transform the 12-lead ECG into left-and right-sided S-ICD 3-lead ECG, and vice versa.
We conducted this study with several goals: (1) assess left-and right-sided S-ICD eligibility
in ACHD patients, (2) validate the previous12 left-sided S-ICD eligibility prediction tool, (3) use
machine learning to predict right- and left-sided S-ICD eligibility in ACHD patients, and (4)
develop and validate transformation matrices to transform 12-lead ECG to S-ICD 3-lead ECG,
and vice versa.
Methods
A MATLAB (MathWorks, Inc, Natick, MA) open-source code for ECG analyses and a user
manual is provided at https://github.com/Tereshchenkolab/S-ICD_eligibility. Fully de-identified
raw digital ECG signal data generated for this study are available at the GitHub at
https://github.com/Tereshchenkolab/S-ICD_eligibility.
Study population
We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study at the Oregon Health & Science University
(OHSU). The Institutional Review Board approved the study, and all participants signed
informed consent before entering the study. Eligible adult patients that had been previously
diagnosed with ACHD were invited to participate during scheduled appointment with their
cardiologist. Inclusion criteria were: (1) known congenital heart defect followed at the OHSU

ACHD clinic, (2) age ≥ 18 years, (3) able to stand on their own for the duration of ECG
recording. Exclusion criteria were: (1) acute medical condition, (2) life expectancy less than one
year due to non-cardiac condition and (3) developmental delay.
Study participants were grouped based on the complexity of ACHD anatomy and physiology
as described in 2019 ACHD AP Classification14: simple (IA-B), moderate complexity (IIB-C), or
complex(IIIC-D).
For out-of-sample validation of the machine learning models, we used the data of our
previous S-ICD eligibility study,12 which enrolled a widely generalizable sample of the OHSU
outpatient population, with a broad range of age (18–81 y), body mass index (BMI; 19–53
kg/m2), QRS duration (66–150 ms), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; 37–77%).
ECG recording and traditional ECG analysis
A MAC 5500 HD ECG system (General Electric (GE) Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA)
was used to record ECGs. Four 10-second digital ECGs (sampling rate 500 Hz, amplitude
resolution 1 µV) were recorded in the following order: right-sided 15-lead supine, left-sided 15lead supine, left-sided 15-lead standing, and right-sided 15-lead standing. A15-lead ECG
configuration included simultaneously recoded standard 12-lead ECG, and a special 3-lead ECG.
Three additional unipolar ECG electrodes (a1, a2, a3) were placed according to
recommendations8 to imitate the location of the sensing S-ICD electrodes (Figure 1).
For left-sided S-ICD, the a1 electrode was placed over the 5th intercostal space at the
midaxillary line, the a2 was placed 1 cm left lateral of the xiphoid midline, and the a3 was
placed 14 cm superior to the a2 electrode.8 For right-sided S-ICD, a2 was moved 1 cm right
lateral of the xiphoid midline, and a3 to 14 cm superior to the new right-sided placement of a2,

whereas the position of a1 was left unchanged (Figure 1). In patients with dextrocardia, all
electrodes were placed in mirror-image fashion, as appropriate.
Averaged across 12-leads RR’, PR, QT, QTc, and QRS intervals, as well as lead-specific
peak-to-peak QRS- and T-amplitudes were measured automatically by the GE 12SL algorithm
(GE Marquette, Milwaukee, WI), using Magellan ECG Research Workstation V2 (GE
Marquette, Milwaukee, WI). R/T ratio in the lead with the largest T wave was calculated as
previously described.12
Anthropometric measurements
Hip, waist, lower and upper chest circumference were measured using a measuring tape
while the participant was standing. The lower chest circumference was measured at the level of
the xiphoid process, and upper chest circumference was measured at the level of the armpits. The
subcostal angle was assessed. The ratio of the lateral diameter of the chest to the anteroposterior
diameter of the chest was estimated. Height and weight were measured, and BMI was calculated.
Assessment of S-ICD eligibility
Bipolar S-ICD leads were derived from recorded unipolar a1, a2, and a3 leads by
subtraction, as follows: Bipolar lead A1 = a2 – a3. Bipolar lead A2 = a1 – a3. Bipolar lead A3 =
a1 – a2. Digital bipolar 3-lead left- and right-sided ECG morphologies in standing and supine
position were evaluated using a digitized version of the Boston Scientific EMBLEM S-ICD
Patient Screening tool8 by at least two investigators (AR, NJ, LW). A MATLAB (Mathworks,
Natick, MA) viewer for digital S-ICD eligibility assessment (Supplemental Figure 1) was
developed by the investigators (NJ, KTH, AR). We provided open-source code and a user
manual at https://github.com/Tereshchenkolab/S-ICD_eligibility. In the case of disagreement,
the 3rd investigator (LGT) made the final determination. A sensing vector passed screening if

maximum QRS amplitudes crossed the dotted line and all QRS complexes and T waves fit
within a profile in all beats, in both standing and supine 10-second recording at 5–20 mm/mV
gain, either on the left or right side. The reasons for failure (high T-wave, high R-wave, deep Swave, small QRS complex, high P, or flutter F-wave) were recorded.
Statistical analyses
After confirmation of normality, continuous variables were reported as mean ± standard
deviation (SD) and compared using the t-test. The χ2 test was used to compare categorical
variables. A paired t-testing was used to compare ECG measurements on the left and right side,
standing, and supine. McNemar’s χ2 statistic was used for paired comparison of S-ICD
ineligibility causes in different positions (standing, supine) on the left and right side.
Validation of the previous left-sided S-ICD eligibility tool
Accuracy of our previously developed left-sided S-ICD eligibility prediction tool12 was
validated using the entire study population. We measured Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC), and calculated sensitivity and specificity of the previously
defined threshold (pass if ≥ 0).
Machine learning model selection, training, testing, and validation
We applied a machine learning technique to develop a prediction of left-sided and right-sided
S-ICD eligibility. Supine ECG datasets served for machine learning (training and testing),
whereas standing ECG datasets, and the data of our previous S-ICD eligibility study12 served for
validation. We compared logistic regression, lasso, elastic net, and ridge models in four machine
learning steps (Figure 2).
In the first step, we split the data of the supine ECG datasets into training (80%) and testing
(20%) random samples.

In the second step, we fitted four different models (logistic regression, lasso, elastic net, and
ridge) using the training sample only. We included altogether 31 predictor variables: peak-topeak amplitudes of QRS complex, T- amplitudes on each out of 12 ECG leads, and averaged
across 12 leads PR, QT, QTc, QRS intervals, the largest T wave amplitude (Tmax), R/Tmax 15, and
heart rate (HR).
In the third step, we evaluated the prediction model performance of each technique (logistic
regression, lasso, elastic net, and ridge) using the testing sample. We selected the best model
with the smallest out-of-sample deviance and the largest deviance ratio. Penalized coefficients
were used for comparison. The best threshold of predicted probability of left-sided and rightsided S-ICD eligibility in both training and testing samples was selected considering two factors.
First, we considered the Liu method, which maximizes the product of sensitivity and
specificity.16 However, as the goal of screening is to identify all individuals who are likely
eligible for S-ICD, we strived to maximize the sensitivity of the test, targeting 100% sensitivity.
In the fourth step, we predicted left-sided and right-sided S-ICD eligibility in two new
datasets: (1) standing ECG recordings, and (2) our previous S-ICD eligibility study data.12 We
determined the accuracy of prediction by measuring ROC AUC. In addition, we validated the
sensitivity of pre-defined (determined at the 3rd step) threshold.
Transformation of 12-lead ECG into S-ICD 3-lead ECG
The dataset was randomly split into the two equal size samples: the training and the
validation samples each had 50% of the observations. Transformation matrices were developed
for right-sided and left-sided, supine and standing sets of ECG data, to transform 12-lead ECG
signal into 3-lead ECG signal, using random effect panel data linear regression with maximum
likelihood estimator. Inverse transformation matrices were developed for transformation of S-

ICD 3-lead ECG signal into 12-lead ECG signal. Previously, Kors et al. demonstrated the
superiority of a statistical regression approach for the development of a transformation matrix.17
Transformation matrices were developed in the training sample. Then, in the validation sample,
an agreement between the originally recorded and transformed 10-second signal was measured
sample-by-sample, by paired t-testing, and the average difference with 95% confidence interval
(CI) was reported.
Statistical analysis was performed using STATA MP 16.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station,
TX). P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Study population
A total of 101 ACHD patients were recruited (Table 1). Most of the study participants had
moderate or complex ACHD with hemodynamic impairment and on average, borderline
systemic ventricular function. Participants had a history of Fontan, Ross, Mustard, Senning,
Rastelli, Glenn, Damus-Kaye-Sensel, and Norwood procedures. Nearly every fifth study
participant already had a transvenous cardiac device implanted: more likely an ICD (65%) than a
pacemaker (35%). Approximately two-thirds of participants (68%) were currently taking
cardiovascular medications (Table 1), and nearly half were taking antiarrhythmic medications
(beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, sotalol, amiodarone, dofetilide, or digoxin). Almost
half of the study population was on anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs. More than half of the
population received drugs targeting hemodynamic improvement (angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin receptor-neprilysin
inhibitor, aldosterone antagonists, vasodilators, and diuretics).

Assessment of S-ICD eligibility
There were 61 participants (60%) that passed either left- or right-sided screening, whereas
the remainder of participants (40%) were deemed non-eligible for S-ICD. Ineligible participants
were more likely to be males, or have had a Fontan palliation. There was a trend towards lower
LVEF, the use of medications for heart failure treatment, history of past or current smoking, and
lower BMI in those who failed ECG screening (Table 1). No difference in ACHD complexity
was observed between those who passed versus failed screening.
Overall, a similar percentage of participants was eligible for right-sided (n=49; 49%) and
left-sided S-ICD (n=45; 45%; McNemar's χ2 P=0.450). Only a third of participants (n=33; 33%)
passed both left- and right-sided screening, whereas 12 (12%) passed only left-sided, and 16
(16%) passed only right-sided screening. Tetralogy of Fallot patients passed right-sided
screening (8/16) more often than left-sided (3/16; McNemar's χ2 P=0.025). Similarly, taken
together Tetralogy of Fallot and Fontan procedure patients (Figure 3) passed right-sided
screening more often than left-sided (McNemar's χ2 P=0.014). No anthropometric characteristics
were associated with differences in either left- or right-sided S-ICD eligibility.
No participants had all 3 S-ICD vectors with eligible ECG morphologies. In any position and
any side, less than half of the participants (40-45%) had two admissible S-ICD vectors, whereas
nearly a quarter of participants failed all three vectors (Figure 3).
Overall, little difference was observed in eligibility of ECG morphologies in different
positions: left and right supine, left and right standing. The rates of pass/fail across complexity
groups were similar for both right and left-sided vectors, either standing or supine (Figure 3).
Representative examples of failed ECG morphologies are shown (Figure 4). Change of the body
position from supine to standing led to a slight heart rate increase, QTc lengthening, and QRS

shortening (Table 2). S-ICD ineligibility due to large P (or F) waves was more likely in left
standing than in left supine position. S-ICD ineligibility due to a small QRS was more likely on
the right side, in both supine and standing positions (Table 2). No other differences in ECG
morphology affected S-ICD eligibility in different positions and sides.
Validation of the S-ICD eligibility prediction tool
Validation ROC AUC for our previous S-ICD eligibility tool12 was unsatisfactory (0.551;
95%CI 0.493 – 0.608). The sensitivity of the pre-defined threshold (≥ 0)12 was 73%, and
specificity was 35%.
Machine-learning prediction of S-ICD eligibility
Selection of the best models was performed using the supine ECG datasets. A comparison of
the prediction models’ performance using testing supine ECG samples is shown in Table 3. For
the left-sided S-ICD eligibility prediction, the ridge model demonstrated the smallest deviance,
and the largest deviance ratio, which characterizes the best cross-validation function. The elastic
net model was the 2nd best, closely followed by lasso. Logistic regression showed the worst outof-sample cross-validation function for both left-sided and right-sided prediction. Ridge and
logistic regression models included all predictor variables, whereas lasso selected only four
predictors (HR, QT interval, Tmax, and TV1 amplitude), and elastic net – only five predictors (HR,
QT interval, Tmax, TV1, and peak-to-peak QRSV3 amplitudes). Cross-validation plots and
coefficient paths are shown in Figure 5. Using the lasso and elastic net prediction model
estimates, left-sided S-ICD eligibility can be calculated as the following:
𝐿𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑜 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 = −0.016 × 𝐻𝑅(𝑏𝑝𝑚) + 2.4 × 𝑄𝑇(𝑠) − 1.4 × 𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑚𝑉) − 0.03 × 𝑇𝑉1 (𝑚𝑉)

Lasso score ≥ - 0.5 predicted left-sided S-ICD eligibility with 91% sensitivity and 30%

− 0.003 × 𝑄𝑅𝑆𝑉3 + 0.06
Elastic net score ≥ - 0.5 predicted left-sided S-ICD eligibility with 96% sensitivity and 10%
specificity.
For the right-sided S-ICD eligibility prediction, both lasso and elastic net models shrunk to
zero coefficients. Therefore, even if both lasso and elastic net demonstrated the minimum crossvalidation function, we had to select the ridge model as the best model (Table 3). Therefore, we
were not able to develop simple linear equations for right-sided S-ICD eligibility prediction.
Out-of-sample (standing ECG) validation of the ridge models was satisfactory for both leftsided [ROC AUC 0.687 (95%CI 0.582-0.791)] and right-sided [ROC AUC 0.655(95%CI 0.5490.762)] S-ICD eligibility prediction.
Out-of-sample validation of the lasso and elastic net prediction models in the previous nonACHD study population 12 yielded high sensitivity of the pre-selected in this study threshold (≥ 0.5): 100% for the elastic net model, and 77% for lasso model. Validation ROC AUC in a nonACHD population was unsatisfactory for all models: specifically for lasso (ROC AUC 0.554;
95%CI 0.355-0.754), elastic net (ROC AUC 0.548; 95%CI 0.340-0.756), and ridge model (ROC
AUC 0.477; 95%CI 0.282-0.671).

Transformation of routine clinical 12-lead ECG to S-ICD 3-lead ECG, and vice versa
Transformation matrices are reported (Supplemental Tables 1-2). Validation of the
transformation matrices showed satisfactory agreement between the originally recorded and
transformed signals (Figure 6 and Supplemental Table 3). For most of the leads (52/60; 87%),
the difference in the voltage was not clinically meaningful (less than 0.1 mV). We provided
open-source software application for transformations at https://github.com/Tereshchenkolab/SICD_eligibility.
Discussion
This prospective study of the contemporary ACHD population revealed several important
findings. First, we observed a high rate of S-ICD ineligibility: nearly half of ACHD patients
were not eligible for S-ICD. While the complexity of ACHD was not associated with S-ICD
ineligibility, ineligible ACHD patients exhibited a trend towards more significant hemodynamic
impairment as compared to those who passed eligibility screening. The high rate of S-ICD
ineligibility in ACHD population represents a significant barrier for the adoption of potentially
advantageous and less invasive S-ICD technology for the prevention of sudden cardiac death in
ACHD. Second, we used machine learning to develop and validate an S-ICD eligibility
prediction tool, to simplify and make it more convenient to screen potential S-ICD candidates.
We found that the most accurate prediction model suggests the use of as many as possible
available 12-lead ECG features, and, therefore, is impractical for “by-hand” calculation.
Nevertheless, we were able to develop and validate a simplified S-ICD prediction model for
left-sided S-ICD. The simplified model includes only four or five readily available ECG features;
it has high sensitivity but low specificity and can be used as a first preliminary step for S-ICD

eligibility screening. All calculators are freely available at www.ecgpredictscd.org. Thirdly, we
developed and validated transformation matrices, to transform 12-lead ECG into S-ICD 3-lead
ECG, and vice versa. The ability to reliably transform signals of these two leads systems could
improve S-ICD diagnostics and facilitate the development of fully automated S-ICD eligibility
assessment, using routinely recorded 12-lead ECG.
Nearly half of the contemporary ACHD population is ineligible for S-ICD
In recent decades, the ACHD population has expanded due to the advancements in pediatric
cardiology and congenital cardiac surgery; 90% of children with severe congenital heart disease
now survive to 18 years of age.14 More than 1.4 million adults live with ACHD in the United
States.18 Sudden cardiac death is the most frequent cause of death in ACHD.19 Patients with
transposition of great arteries and tetralogy of Fallot have the highest risk of life-threatening
ventricular arrhythmias.20 Since the entire S-ICD system is implanted in an extra-thoracic space,
it eliminates the complications related to endo- or epicardial leads.21 The ACHD patients with no
transvenous access to the heart (namely Fontal palliation), or those with a right-to-left shunt and
increased risk of systemic emboli, can attain the utmost potential benefit22 from implantation of
S-ICD. Unfortunately, our study demonstrated that 40% of the contemporary complex ACHD
population is ineligible for S-ICD.
The rate of ineligibility observed in this study for both right- and left-sided S-ICD in ACHD
patients (40%) is higher than the rate reported by Alonso et al.23 for tetralogy of Fallot (23%) and
mixed ACHD patients13 (25%), the rate reported by Okamura et al. (12%)24, Garside et al.6
(25%; left-sided only), and Zeb et al.25 (13%; left-sided only). Higher rate of S-ICD ineligibility
in our study can be due to the large size, greater complexity and heterogeneity, and more severe
functional impairment of our study population.14 We found that the sickest patients with a trend

towards higher degree of hemodynamic impairment (who potentially can benefit the most from
S-ICD) have higher likelihood of failing ECG screening. The results of this study underscore the
need to improve S-ICD technology further to increase the number of eligible ACHD patients.
Our previous study12 showed remarkable (3-fold) improvement in S-ICD eligibility after ECG
filtering. In this study, high QRS and T voltage was the main reason for S-ICD ineligibility and
turning S-ICD ECG filtering feature ON can increase the number of eligible ACHD patients.
Similar to previous studies conducted in the ACHD population13 23-25, we found more Fontan
and tetralogy of Fallot participants that passed screening with the right-sided vector. Findings of
improved S-ICD eligibility with the right-sided placement of S-ICD lead merit further studies
comparing effectiveness in arrhythmia termination. Several case reports demonstrated successful
defibrillation with 65J in ACHD patients with right-sided S-ICD lead placement.26-28
Theoretically, right-sided S-ICD lead placement can be more effective in arrhythmia termination
than left-sided S-ICD lead placement, because of a more favorable S-ICD electric lead field,
encompassing the whole heart (Figure 1). An in silico study reported a lower defibrillation
threshold for right-sided than for left-sided S-ICD lead placement.29 An observational study in a
general S-ICD population30 demonstrated similar rates of successful defibrillation with the first
65J shock (79% left-sided and 73% right-sided lead; P=NS), and similar rates of ineffective
shocks (2.9% left-sided and 1.9% right-sided lead; P=NS). A randomized controlled trial is
needed before right-sided S-ICD lead placement can be recommended as preferential in ACHD.
Using 12-lead ECG for prediction of 12-lead eligibility: a machine learning approach
Results of our study, demonstrating a large proportion of ACHD population being ineligible
for S-ICD, highlight the importance of S-ICD eligibility screening. Currently, S-ICD eligibility
assessment is performed in specialized centers, and some patients have to travel long distances

only to be ultimately disqualified. The referring physician must assess S-ICD eligibility before
offering this treatment option to a patient, to avoid disappointment if a patient is subsequently
deemed ineligible. To address this constraint, we developed and validated S-ICD eligibility
prediction tools, which can use widely available routine resting 12-lead ECG.
We used an advanced machine learning approach that illuminated several important findings.
Model selection by machine learning demonstrated that the most accurate out-of-sample
prediction tool included all available ECG features, specifically QRS and T amplitudes in each
of 12 leads, all averaged ECG intervals (PR, QRS, QT), and heart rate. Along those lines, we
developed transformation matrices to transform the entire ECG waveform from one type to
another: from 12-lead ECG to 3-lead ECG and vice versa. Validation of transformation matrices
demonstrated substantial agreement between originally recorded and transformed signals.
Reliable signal transformation opens an avenue for further development of additional diagnostic
and prognostic features that can enhance S-ICD functionality, as well as for the development of
fully automated S-ICD eligibility assessment using routine 12-lead ECG.
At the same time, machine learning indicated that simplified prediction of S-ICD eligibility
could not be sufficiently accurate. Both lasso and elastic net models for right-sided lead
eligibility prediction shrunk all coefficients to zero, suggesting that no linear equation exist to
describe prediction function accurately, because of its non-linearity. Therefore, we did not offer a
simplified calculator to predict right-sided S-ICD eligibility. On the other hand, several models
were selected by machine learning for the simplified prediction of left-sided S-ICD eligibility.
Selected by machine learning S-ICD eligibility predictors (HR, QT, maximum T amplitude) have
been previously reported in other ACHD studies24, including our previous model.12 Realizing
that even using a machine learning approach we cannot offer perfect prediction of S-ICD

eligibility by a simple linear model, we tuned developed models to high sensitivity. A simple
calculator using readily available ECG metrics (HR, QT, Tmax, TV1, QRSV3) can be used for
screening; it can identify all potential S-ICD candidates that need to undergo further assessment
by the Boston Scientific EMBLEM S-ICD Patient Screening tool.8
Importantly, in this study, we used a supervised machine learning approach, to be able to
interpret the models and understand factors associated with S-ICD ineligibility, and to provide
open-source prediction tools. We cannot rule out a possibility of more accurate prediction by
unsupervised machine learning, which was not utilized in this study.
Limitations
We only performed ECG screening in the supine and standing positions but did not screen
during exercise or other postures, which can theoretically increase the percentage of ineligible
patients. Nonetheless, as we observed very little difference in eligibility between standing and
supine positions in this study, we can infer that unlike in the general population,12 body posture
change in an ACHD population has little to no effect on S-ICD eligibility. Consistently with our
findings, Wilson et al.31 did not detect significant differences in the R/T amplitude ratio in
tetralogy of Fallot and single ventricle physiology patients in a supine, prone, left lateral, right
lateral, sitting, and standing positions, whereas such differences were observed in controls.
Similarly, Zeb et al.25 reported that posture change did not affect S-ICD eligibility in ACHD
patients.
On the other hand, in our study, an increase in HR was associated with large P-waves as a
cause of ineligibility, and overall, with less likelihood of passing the screening. As ACHD
patients are prone to sinus tachycardia and supraventricular arrhythmias, future studies of S-ICD
eligibility in ACHD during exercise are needed.

Although we enrolled a complex ACHD population and presented a comparable sample size6,
13, 24

, our study suffered limitations typical for all ACHD studies.14 ACHD patients are

heterogeneous: specific congenital lesions and repairs are rare. Each ACHD patient has unique
anatomy and physiology. Larger studies in ACHD populations would better account for inherent
heterogeneity. However, our study cohort was representative of the wide variety of ACHD
patients typically seen across the range of both anatomic and physiologic spectra, and thus the
findings are likely more generalizable than other studies focusing on single defects. It is
noteworthy that our broad inclusion also encompasses patients who would require a transvenous
ICD because of indications for pacing and who would not be considered for S-ICD.
While our study had an equal presentation of men and women, the study population was
predominantly white. Future studies in ethnically diverse populations are needed. It is not clear
what role, if any, race or ethnicity would have on S-ICD eligibility.
Finally, though we found some suggestions of poorer hemodynamics in patients who were
ineligible for S-ICD, there was no sufficient statistical power to detect differences in LVEF;
estimated power was 0.34. RV and systemic ventricle hemodynamic function was not
systematically evaluated in this study. Larger studies are needed to validate our finding of a trend
towards greater hemodynamic impairment in unsuitable for S-ICD ACHD patients.

Figure legends
Figure 1. Placement of a1, a2, and a3 electrodes for the 3-lead ECG to mimic the leads A1
(a2-a3), A2 (a1-a3), and A3 (a1-a2) sensing vectors of the S-ICD.
Figure 2. Machine learning steps: S-ICD eligibility prediction development, and validation.
Figure 3. A. The proportion of patients with transposition of great arteries, Tetralogy of
Fallot, and Fontan procedure with passing and failing for right (R)- and left (L)-sided sensing
vectors. B. The proportion of study participants who failed all three vectors or passed 1-2 leftand right-sided vectors standing and supine.
Figure 4. Representative examples of S-ICD screening template passing and failing ECG
morphologies.
Figure 5. The coefficient paths after (A) lasso, (B) elastic net, (C) ridge models. A line is
drawn for each coefficient that traces its value over the searched values of the lasso penalty
parameter λ on a reverse logarithmic scale. Lasso is letting variables into the model based on its
penalty and the current value of λ. Cross-validation (CV) function (the mean deviance in the CV
samples) is plotted over the search grid for the lasso penalty parameter λ on a reverse logarithmic
scale for (D) lasso, (E) elastic net, (F) ridge models. The first λ tried is on the left, and the last λ
tried is on the right.
Figure 6. Representative examples of recorded and transformed right-sided 3-lead ECG
morphologies, and corresponding 12-lead ECG recorded during standing in a Fontan patient.
