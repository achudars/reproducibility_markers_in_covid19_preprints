Triage-based care of people with Back Pain:
STarT Back or Start diagnosing? An observational study.
Tim Germon, Alex Jack, Jeremy Hobart
Abstract

Objectives
Back pain is a massive public health problem. The STarT Back Screening Tool (SBST) was
developed for use in primary care to triage people with lumbar pain, classifying them as low,
medium or high “risk” of prolonged symptoms. This classification guides non-surgical
interventions including manual treatments, exercise and cognitive behavioural therapy.
Claims suggest SBST brings generic health and cost benefits. National guidance recommends
STarT Back is used at the first primary care consultation but can be used at any stage. For
SBST to be an effective triage tool it should distinguish structural from non-structural pain.
We tested this requirement in consecutive people referred to a single triage practitioner,
hypothesising it was not possible conceptually.
Design
An observational study of the relationship between routine, prospectively collected triage
data and diagnosis.
Setting
A secondary care spinal triage service based in a teaching hospital.
Participants
We studied consecutive referrals with lumbar pain triaged by a single extended scope
practitioner (ESP) over 22 months (Nov 2015-Sept 2017).

Main Outcome Measures
SBST and pain visual analogue scores (VAS: 0-10) were collected at the initial consultation.
We compared data for people with and without surgically remedial lesions.
Results
1041 people were seen (61% female, mean age 53), n=234 (28%) had surgically amenable
explanations for pain. People with surgical lesions were older (58 v 51yrs), more likely male
(48 v 35%) and had higher VAS scores (6.8 v 6.1). Surgery and non-surgery subgroups had
similar SBST total and domain score distribution profiles. The surgery subgroup had less low
risk (9%v21%) and more high risk (37% v 30%) classified people.
Conclusion
SBST scores did not differentiate surgical from non-surgical pathologies. It seems unlikely
that symptom questionnaires can estimate prognosis accurately unless everyone has the
same diagnosis, not just the same symptom. Diagnosis, rather than questionnaire scores,
should guide treatment and inform prognosis.

Summary Box
What is already known on this topic?

The symptom of low back pain is a common cause of disability worldwide.
The majority if people with low back pain probably do not have a structural problem in
their lumbar spine to explain the extent of their disability.
National guidelines throughout the world attempt to facilitate the identification and
treatment of people with, “non-specific low back pain”, and prescribe treatment for
people given this label.
What this study adds?

It seems unlikely that symptom questionnaires can estimate prognosis accurately unless
everyone has the same diagnosis, not just the same symptom.
The practice of recommending treatment and prognosticating in the absence of a
diagnosis needs further scrutiny.

Introduction

Back pain is a huge and increasing public health problem. Estimates, published nearly two
decades ago, suggested low back pain affects 24-36% of adults, persisted for >12 months
60-80% of the time, and that 85% of cases were “non-specific” (NSLBP).1,2,3 That is, more
than 8/10 people with low back pain seeing primary care physicians were assumed to have
no known specific underlying pathology or disease explaining their symptoms. Challenged
health services responded by seeking management guidelines and methods to triage care.

The STarT Back Screening Tool (SBST; Fig 1) sought to address this need.4 SBST developers
state: “there is a need for an adequately validated screening tool that allocates and
prioritizes treatment for the entire spectrum of patients with NSLBP presenting to primary
care, on the basis of treatment modifiable indicators, that is brief and quick to score”.
Specifically, SBST aims to classify people with NSLBP as high, medium or low risk of
prolonged symptoms and guide interventions (table 1). This approach is claimed to bring
generic health and cost benefits.5

Whilst SBST’s original focus on NSLBP appears clear, subsequent studies imply wider
application to people with both specific and non-specific back pain.4,5 This suggestion is
propagated in national guidance. Both the National Back & Radicular Pain Pathway and the
British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) and The Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCSE)
guidance to commissioners recommend SBST is administered to every person with back
pain at their first primary care, as well as subsequent secondary care consultations (Fig 2).6,7

STarT Back or Start diagnosing

This approach concerns us. First, it seems surprising to us that almost everyone with a
common symptom has no specific cause. Second, a conclusion that symptoms have no
explanatory cause is a diagnosis of exclusion requiring potential causes being excluded
actively. This can’t necessarily be undertaken easily in primary care. Third, we have concerns
about using symptom severity questionnaires to determine treatments in circumstances
where the primary symptom, here pain, is the final common pathway of multiple diagnoses.
Fourth, NSLBP is a label or description but not a diagnosis. We think this distinction is
essential. Conceptually, people with one diagnosis could receive the same treatment, within
reason. However, people with one label cannot be assumed to have one diagnosis. The only
things common to people with “NSLBP” are pain and no clear explanation. Finally, we
hypothesize that widespread application of SBST in primary care will triage people with
treatable causes away from beneficial interventions. As such, diagnoses and beneficial
treatments will be delayed or never realised.

For SBST to be used to identify risk, and guide interventions in primary care, a requirement
is the ability to differentiate between surgical and non-surgical causes. We tested this
requirement, hypothesising it was not possible conceptually for the reasons identified
above.

Methods
Keele STarT Back Screening Tool (SBST; Figure 1)

The SBST is a self-report questionnaire for people with back pain. There are 9 questions
(items). Eight items have two response categories: disagree and agree, scored 0 and 1. The

ninth item has five response categories: not at all, slightly, moderately, very much,
extremely; scored 0, 0, 0, 1, 1.

The SBST generates two scores. SBST total scores are generated by summing scores for all 9
items and range from 0 to 9. Higher total scores imply greater impact of back pain. SBST
psychosocial subscale scores are generated by summing scores of questions 5-9 and range
from 0-5. Higher subscale scores imply greater psychosocial impact.

The SBST score algorithm (Fig 1) defines people’s risk of persisting symptoms. First, SBST
total scores define people’s risk as low (SBST total score </=3 [of max 9]), or not low (>/=4
[of max 9]). Next, the SBST psychosocial subscale scores define the not-low-risk group as
medium risk (</=3 [of max 5]) or high risk (>/=4 [of max 5]).

Sample

We studied all people referred for opinions regarding lumbar pain triaged by a single (AJ)
extended scope practitioner (ESP) between November 2015 and September 2017. At the
initial consultation the ESP made a clinical assessment and recorded SBST and visual
analogue scale (VAS) pain scores (0 [no pain] to 10 [worst pain imaginable]). In accordance
with our usual management, people thought to have clinical presentations suggesting
structural abnormalities, principally pain thought to be indicative of nerve root
compression, were offered MRI scanning. This is at odds with national guidance which only
recommends MRI scanning prior to application of the STarT Back stratification in people
with, “severe radicular pain not responding to treatment after 6-8 weeks”. Cases where
scans are reported as suggesting lesions responsible for clinical presentations were

discussed with consultant surgeons from the combined neuro-orthopaedic spinal service.
When the surgeon considered the MRI abnormality explained the clinical presentation
people were offered surgical assessments. In other words, people in our series with whom
surgery was discussed would not have been offered that opportunity had national guidance
been adhered to strictly.

Analyses

We computed: baseline demographics, proportions of people who had MRI scanning and
surgery, baseline SBST and VAS score distributions and summary statistics for people with
and without surgically remedial lesions.

Patient & Public Involvement

This is a retrospective analysis of routinely collected patient and clinician reported
information as recommended by guidelines. In this context public and patient involvement
in the design would not have been possible.

Results

A total of n=1041 people were assessed by the ESP. Of these, n=489 (46.9%) had lumbar
MRI scans of which n=137 (28%) had MRI-determined surgical lesions.

Table 2 shows the total sample mean age was 53 years (SD=16.4; range 16-91), 61.2%
(n=638) were female. SBST data were available for 82.4% of people assessed. Missing SBST
data were higher in the non-surgical subgroup.

The subgroup with surgical lesions was older (58 v 51 yrs), had more males (48% v 35%), had
greater pain scores for all 3 VAS’s [lumbar, right and left leg] done (6.8, 6.7, 6.6 v 6.1, 4.9,
4.8), and higher mean SBST total (5.9 v 5.4) and subscale (3.1 v 2.9) scores than the nonsurgical group.

Tables 2 shows the distribution VAS scores of SBST total and SBST subscale scores and the
distribution of (Table 3) for the four main samples. The profiles are relatively similar across
these measures for the surgical and non-surgical samples. The surgical sample has lower
percents with lower scores and higher percents with higher scores. The differences are
relatively small.

Discussion

Our results question using SBST to triage people with back pain in primary and secondary
care. Over 80% of people with MRI identified surgical lesions considered to account for at
least some of their symptoms were either at high or medium “risk”. Medium risk identifies
individuals with unfavourable prognoses, high levels of physical prognostic indicators,
appropriate for physiotherapy. High risk identifies individuals with very unfavourable
prognoses, consistently high levels across psychosocial prognostic indicators, appropriate
for management by a combination of physical and cognitive-behavioural approaches. All
these people had surgical explanations for their symptoms.

The SBST simply indicates the extent of some impacts of back pain, higher scores indicate
greater impact. It comes as no surprise to us that greater levels of pain have greater
physical, mental and psychological health impacts than lesser levels of pain. However, a
symptom severity questionnaire cannot, by definition, have diagnostic accuracy.

It is entirely appropriate for service providers to seek efficient ways of allocating limited
resources. START back’s developers recognised a “one size fits all primary care strategy was
suboptimum because it ignores the heterogenicity of patients”, and set out to, “test
whether stratified care according to the estimated risk of poor prognosis (defined here as
persistent disability because of back pain) improves clinical outcomes while remaining cost
effective.”5

We have a different view. From our perspective the SBST represents a fundamental
departure from standard accepted medical practice where diagnosis guides treatment. Our
data show that neither the SBST risk groups, total scores nor subscale scores distinguish
people who have structural lesions likely to be responsible for their pain, from those who do
not. In our view, the established principle of making a diagnosis provides a “one size fits all”
strategy which recognises patient heterogeneity and enables stratification.

Departing from the principle of basing treatment on diagnosis has significant implications
raises important issues. In the absence of a diagnosis, it is not possible to collect robust
evidence supporting the value of interventions prescribed for non-specific symptoms. There
is a risk that ineffective management will be promoted and people for whom effective
treatments are available will be missed or delayed. How correct is it to prescribe

interventions without diagnoses? It is a reflection of the magnitude of the problem facing
society that this largely untested approach features so prominently in national guidance
(NICE and commissioning guidance produced by the BOA & SBNS)?

We consider that the accepted standard of care is to make a diagnosis on which to base
treatment and prognosis. Challenges to this standard are encouraged but should be based
on firm foundations. In their paper, claiming SBST’s efficacy, the developers provide a single
reference supporting their statement that a “novel approach, gaining interest in other
medical specialties, but not yet tested in the management of back pain, is to test whether
stratified care according to the estimated risk of poor prognosis (defined here as persistent
disability because of back pain) improves clinical outcomes while remaining cost effective.”8
This is one in a series of papers describing the use of prognostic models to “estimate the risk
of future outcomes in individuals based on their clinical and non-clinical characteristics”.
Whilst we agree that diagnosis is not be the only variable important in determining
prognosis, it is hard to think it is not a principle factor.

We are not aware that such a prognostic model has been successfully applied to a symptom
in the absence of a diagnosis. The SBST’s developers’ proposition is that prognosis can be
estimated, and effective treatment prescribed from a symptoms severity questionnaire with
no regard for diagnosis. It uses binary responses to non-specific questions including “I have
had pain in the shoulder or neck at some time in the last 2 weeks” and “It’s not really safe
for a person with a condition like mine to be physically active”. If it were possible to
diagnose and prognosticate on the basis of such simple questions and answers it would
certainly simplify healthcare provision. This might explaining its very early adoption by

commissioning authorities. However, we are concerned that the rationale is flawed
conceptually and supporting evidence is weak.

We believe a central problem is that it has become acceptable to label people suffering
from lumbar spine related pain as suffering from “non-specific low back pain”. This term is
then used as a diagnosis rather than a symptom. We consider that all pain will have an
explanation and the best chance of helping people in pain is to understand the underlying
cause, i.e, make a diagnosis. Our experience, and published work, shows that people with a
surgically amenable structural explanation for pain are frequently not recognised because
the symptoms of nerve root compression rarely conform to textbook and guideline
descriptions or clinical expectations. In our published series of consecutive people
undergoing surgery for lumbosacral disc disease, only 1 of 123 (0.81%) had a clinical
presentation consistent with that documented in clinical guidances and textbooks.9 These
factors are not consistent with diagnostic accuracy in primary care. We think similar
scenarios probably apply to people with psychosocially or psychiatrically mediated
symptoms for which more specific treatments may be suitable. For example, 80% of people
with fibromyalgia referred for specialist psychiatric assessment were found to have a
diagnosis.10

Lumbar pain is the final common pathway of multiple potential diagnoses. The vast majority
will probably resolve spontaneously, and the cause is not important. However, for those
with persistent disabling symptoms in whom we wish to prescribe treatments a diagnosis is
required. Currently, we are unable to separate accurately the diagnoses of lumbar pain on
clinical grounds, in part because this has not been studied carefully. The SBST measures

severity across 9 ambiguous questions (e.g: “In general I have not enjoyed all the things I
used to enjoy”). No one question is attributable to any one diagnosis. We have a choice:
invest in understanding if it is possible to separate diagnosis accurately on clinical grounds in
primary care; or, recognise that a diagnosis requires imaging and a specialist opinion so that
treatable structural lesions are identified.
