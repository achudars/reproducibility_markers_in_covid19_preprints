Abstract

7

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown to be highly effective in reducing the risk of HIV infection

8

in gay and bisexual men who have sex with men (GbMSM). However, PrEP does not protect against other

9

sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In some populations, PrEP has also led to riskier behaviour such as

10

reduced condom usage, with the result that the prevalence of bacterial STIs like gonorrhea has increased.

11

Here we develop a compartmental model of the transmission of HIV and gonorrhea, and the impacts of

12

PrEP, condom usage, STI testing frequency and potential changes in sexual risk behaviour stemming from

13

the introduction of PrEP in a population of GbMSM. We find that introducing PrEP causes an increase in

14

gonorrhea prevalence for a wide range of parameter values, including at the current recommended frequency

15

of STI testing once every 3 months for individuals on PrEP. Moreover, the model predicts that a higher STI

16

testing frequency alone is not enough to prevent a rise in gonorrhea prevalence, unless the testing frequency

17

is increased to impractical levels. However, testing every 2 months in combination with sufficiently high

18

condom usage by individuals on PrEP would be successful in maintaining gonorrhea prevalence at pre-PrEP

19

levels. The results emphasize that programs making PrEP more available should be accompanied by efforts to

20

support condom usage and frequent STI testing, in order to avoid an increase in the prevalence of gonorrhea

21

and other bacterial STIs.

Introduction

23

Sexually transmitted infections have long been a public health concern in the GbMSM (gay and bisexual

24

men who have sex with men) community, especially since the sexual liberation movement and the emergence

25

of sex clubs and bath houses in the late 1970s [1, 2]. At around the same time, the Human Immunodeficiency

26

Virus, known as HIV, started spreading and the first cases were recorded. HIV patients progressed to AIDS

27

(Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) and subsequently died. An AIDS pandemic began in the 1980s.

28

The origins of HIV are still debated in the scientific community and multiple theories have been laid out

29

[3, 4]. Nevertheless, it is a virus that disproportionately affects sexually active gay and bisexual men in

30

Canada and North America.

31

HIV has two main types (1 and 2) and several subtypes [4]. The strain that affects most gay and bisexual

32

men is type 1 subtype B [5]. HIV is a retrovirus–a class of viruses that quickly mutate–thus making it

33

difficult to cure with antiviral drugs [6]. As the pandemic accelerated, research began to understand the

34

modes of transmission. HIV virus particles (known as virions) are mainly found in pre-ejaculatory fluid and

35

semen and are transmitted through anal intercourse and oral sex [7]. For a long time, condoms have been

36

identified as the main tool for HIV prevention. Condoms lower the transmission risk of HIV by 60% to 90%

37

[8, 9].

38

Testing for HIV became available in 1985 [10]. Public health agencies and physicians recommend frequent

39

testing, especially for highly sexually active individuals. If an individual tests positive for HIV, they initi-

40

ate ART (Anti Retroviral Therapy) or HAART (Highly Active Anti Retroviral Therapy) treatment which

41

consists in taking daily pills (Truvada in combination with other medications) to bring viral loads to unde-

42

tectable levels: lower than 50 copies of virus particles per milliliters of blood. Once the patient achieves the

43

undetectable status, they can no longer transmit the virus [11].

44

Other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia are also mainly

45

transmitted through anal intercourse and oral sex. The three aforementioned diseases are bacterial and are

46

usually treated with antibiotics [12]. However, if they are not diagnosed in their early stages, they can lead

47

to complications resulting in severe health issues [13]. Condoms also act as a prophylactic measure against

48

them. Individuals can be co-infected by HIV and other STIs [14]. If an individual is already infected by one

49

STI, it is easier to contract another STI. gonorrhea is becoming resistant to antibiotics [13] and drug-resistant

50

gonorrhea is becoming a public health concern.

51

In recent years, a treatment protocol based on antiviral drugs called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)

52

has been implemented, and has been shown to strongly reduce the transmission of HIV [15, 16]. Recent

53

studies have shown that PrEP can protect well above 90% [17]. However, PrEP doesn’t protect against other

54

STIs, such as gonorrhea. Studies have associated the use of PrEP with an increase in risky sexual behaviour

55

(such as reduced condom usage) [18, 19, 20] as well as an increase in bacterial STIs including gonorrhea [21].

56

Physicians, nurse practitioners and public health agents prescribe PrEP for 3 months and require the user

57

to return with negative results for an inclusive STI testing for a refill.

58

PrEP is currently in the market and is being prescribed to individuals deemed at risk determined by

59

their sex practices. It is covered by most health insurance companies and provincial and federal governments

60

[22]. A very high PrEP uptake could potentially result in larger than average outbreaks in gonorrhea.

61

HIV transmission and the impact of interventions such as antiviral drugs, condoms, and hypothetical

62

vaccines have been a frequent topic of mathematical modelling efforts [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. A

63

few of these models have also considered interactions between HIV and other infections, such as the effects

64

of tuberculosis coinfection with HIV [23]. Mathematical models can be useful for anticipating undesirable

65

dynamics that emerge in the wake of infectious disease interventions, and how to best counter them, such as

66

exemplified by increases in congenital rubella syndrome incidence under certain rubella vaccination policies

67

[31]. The observed increase in gonorrhea due to use of PrEP in some populations is another example of

68

an undesirable side effect of increased PrEP uptake. Here, we develop a model of the HIV and gonorrhea

69

transmission in a population of GbMSM, including STI testing, condom usage, and PrEP adoption. The

70

model is parameterized with data from Canadian and United States GbMSM populations. We use the model

71

to study the relationship between STI testing frequency and gonorrhea prevalence after the introduction of

72

PrEP, with a particular focus on how much STI testing frequency needs to be increased in order to counter

73

a potential rise in gohorrhea due to reduced condom usage among individuals taking PrEP. The model is

74

described in the following section, followed by the results and finally a discussion section.

2.1

77

We introduce a system of ordinary differential equations that describes the spread of human immunodefi-

78

ciency virus (HIV) and gonorrhea (GC) in the presence of a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) regimen in a

79

population of gay and bisexual men. The population is divided into eight compartments and each individual

80

can belong to only one compartment at a time. The compartments and the possible transfers between them

81

appear in Figure 1.

84

and are also on PrEP. We assume that PrEP users strongly adhere to the regimen recommended by their

85

physicians. The most popular recommended dosage is a daily pill of Tenofovir(TDF)/Emtricitabine(FTC).

86

Studies have shown that strong adherence reduces the transmission of HIV by 94% [17, 32]. A more recent

87

study of HIV transmission among serodiscordant couples has shown 0 cases of transmission when PrEP was

88

administered as recommended [33]. We therefore assume that strong adherence prevents the transmission of

89

HIV. We furthermore assume that PrEP patients stay on PrEP and do not discontinue its use.

90

Pg (t) is the proportion of individuals who are infected by gonorrhea while on PrEP. They can recover

91

when they test positive for gonorrhea and start medication with efficacy g . Ig (t) represents the proportion

92

of individuals who are infected by gonorrhea only. Ih (t) is the proportion of individuals who are infected

93

by HIV only. Igh (t) represents the proportion of individuals who are infected by both HIV and gonorrhea.

94

Even though simultaneous co-infection is a possible outcome of a sexual act, we will neglect this outcome and

95

assume that individuals are first infected by one pathogen, and then independently infected by the other.

96

T (t) represents the proportion of individuals who are on treatment for HIV infection. Individuals who

97

are on an HIV treatment protocol do not transmit HIV [11]. They can, however, contract gonorrhea and

98

move to the Tg (t) class. We assume that individuals infected by HIV do not progress to AIDS due to the

99

availability of HIV medication provided by governments and the fact that it can take up to 10 years for HIV

100

to progress into AIDS [34]. The system of differential equations describing the transfers between these eight

2.2

Parameterization

104

Five parameters (ρ,αp ,αt ,βg and βh ) were fitted to empirical values of disease prevalence to generate the

105

baseline parameter values listed in Table 1 (all parameters that represent time rates are in units of per

106

day, unless otherwise specified). The calibration process was carried out in two steps. The first step sets

107

ρ = αp = 0 and P (0) = Pg (0) = 0. HIV prevalence in Canada among men who have sex with men

108

(MSM) is roughly 19%. This number was obtained after weighing the prevalence of HIV in the main 3

109

metropolitan cities in Canada: Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal [35, 36]. Therefore, at equilibrium, we set

110

Ih + Igh + T + Tg = 0.19. The same studies reported that roughly two-thirds of HIV positive individuals

111

are on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) or highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) and therefore we set

112

Ih + Igh = 0.06 and T + Tg = 0.13.

113

Gonorrhea prevalence in MSM populations was more difficult to obtain, mostly due to disease surveillance

114

being performed at the level of the general population (i.e., not specific to MSM). However a clinical study

115

in California [37] reported that 15% of patients visiting a sexual health clinic were infected by gonorrhea. At

116

equilibrium, we set Ig + Igh + Tg = 0.15. The study also filters gonorrhea infection by HIV status. Taking

117

into account only HIV negative individuals (we discarded unknown HIV status), we obtained, at equilibrium

118

Ig = 0.10. We are left with Igh + Tg = 0.05. Finally, at equilibrium S = 1 − 0.19 − 0.1 = 0.71.

119

We performed a three dimensional grid sweep in order to minimize the error between computed equilib-

120

rium values and those obtained from the references. We started by scanning the parameter space for regions

121

where the least squares error between data values and simulated values is minimal. We narrowed it down

122

to the following: αt ∈ [3, 4], βg ∈ [0.0014, 0.0016] and βh ∈ [0.0012, 0.0014]. The grid sweep was performed

123

in MATLAB using ODE45. We also tested the model with other solvers (ODE23S, ODE15S) and obtained

124

very similar results. Initial conditions (aside from P and Pg ) were randomly selected, since our focus was

125

on equilibrium values.

126

We are left with calibrating ρ and αp . We started by replacing S = 0.71 by S + P = 0.71 at equilibrium.

127

We have also replaced Ig + Igh + Tg = 0.15 by Ig + Igh + Tg + Pg = 0.15 and Ig = 0.1 by Ig + Pg = 0.1.

128

Current estimates of PrEP users average to 5% [38, 39, 40, 41, 42]. Therefore, we added P + Pg = 0.05.

129

When calibrating ρ and αp , we fixed the previously found baseline values for αt = 3.875, βg = 0.001475 and

130

βh = 0.001275. The baseline parameter values appear in Table 1.

Results

132

The simulation results are presented in the form of parameter planes and time series in the next two sub-

133

sections.

134

3.1

135

Increasing PrEP uptake rate increases gonorrhea prevalence. While PrEP prevents the trans-

136

mission of HIV, it is ineffective against other STIs. Therefore, we examined the equilibrium prevalence of

137

gonorrhea (Ig + Igh + Pg + Tg ) for different rates of PrEP uptake. In particular, we were interested in optimal

138

combinations of testing frequency for PrEP users (fp ), and condom use or other preventive strategies (αp )

139

in order to minimize the prevalence of gonorrhea.

Parameter planes

140

We ran a two dimensional grid 101 × 101 of values for fp ranging from 0.001 (testing roughly once every

141

3 years) to 0.04 (testing once every 25 days), and for αp ranging from 0.0 (abstinence from sex, very high

142

condom use or any other preventive strategy) to 20.0 (less precautions, lower condom use). We conducted

143

this simulation for 4 different values of ρ: 0.0 (no PrEP uptake), 2.375 × 10−6 (baseline value), 3.562 × 10−6

144

(50% higher than baseline value) and 1.1875 × 10−5 (5 times higher than baseline value).

145

For the baseline parameter value of PrEP uptake (Fig 2a), we observe that an increase in risky behaviour

146

(αp ) causes a significant increase in gonorrhea prevalence. For example, the baseline increase in αp from 1 to

147

12.75 causes an increase in gonorrhea prevalence from approximately 10 % to 16 %. On the other hand, an

148

increase in the testing frequency (fp ) causes a decrease in gonorrhea prevalence (for αp unchanged). Lines of

149

constant gonorrhea prevalence run approximately linearly across the parameter plane, such that the baseline

150

increase in αp would need to be accompanied by an increase in fp far in excess of 0.04 (testing every 25

151

days). Unfortunately, this suggests that an increase in gonorrhea prevalence in a population where PrEP is

152

widespread is very difficult to prevent, for realistic testing intervals.

153

When ρ = 0 (no PrEP uptake, Fig 2b), we observe a slight variation of about 0.5% in the prevalence of

154

gonorrhea in the (fp , αp ) plane, as expected (note the vertical scale of subpanel 2b). This is due to the fact

155

that we have chosen non-zero initial conditions for P and Pg . In particular, we have set P (0) = 0.08 and

156

Pg (0) = 0.02. We have examined the case when P (0) = Pg (0) = ρ = 0 and there was no variation in the

157

levels of gonorrhea in the population.

158

With information propagating through social media and awareness campaigns, more individuals are

159

becoming aware of PrEP and its efficacy in HIV prevention. We suspect that the PrEP uptake rate will

160

be on the rise within the next decade. We have therefore investigated scenarios where the uptake rate is

161

increased by 50% from the baseline value (Fig 2c) and is 5 times higher than the baseline value (Fig 2d). This

162

inevitable increase in ρ can be potentially problematic since greater increases in the prevalence of gonorrhea

163

are observed for higher values of ρ. For instance, when ρ is 5 times larger than the baseline value, gonorrhea

164

levels can reach 35% of the entire population if no precautions are carefully taken into account (yellow regions

165

in Fig 2c,d).

166

On the other hand, this increase in the uptake rate offers a wider area in the (fp , αp ) parameter plane

167

where gonorrhea prevalence remains low (compare black regions in Fig 2c and Fig 2d). In fact, under these

168

scenarios of higher PrEP uptake, the testing frequency does not need to be increased as much as under the

169

baseline PrEP uptake, in order for gonorrhea prevalence to remain unchanged. This flexibility allows for

170

better control and the prevention of outbreaks. If αp is too high, the focus would be on increasing the testing

171

frequency to maintain sub-epidemic levels of gonorrhea in the population.

172

We also noticed a linear border between regions of higher and lower gonorrhea prevalence. The border

173

separating yellow regions from red regions is much steeper than that separating red regions from black regions.

174

This is an indication of the importance in maintaining a minimum testing frequency to keep gonorrhea from

175

infecting a greater proportion of the population.

176

Sufficiently frequent STI testing controls gonorrhea prevalence. Before starting a PrEP regimen,

177

every individual needs to go through a series of tests. The individual should test negative for HIV as a first

178

step to qualify. They also have to test for common STIs such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis. If the

179

results come back positive for any of the STIs, an anti-bacterial treatment is prescribed first, and pending

180

recovery, PrEP qualification is revisited. Finally, testing the liver and kidney functions is also essential before

181

starting PrEP. The pills can have damaging effects on the liver [43]. If ALT (alanine aminotransaminase)

182

and AST (aspartate transaminase) levels are too high, a nurse practitioner (or a physician) recommends

183

lowering the levels before starting PrEP.

184

Public health agencies in Canada have set testing frequency for PrEP users to be once every 3 months

185

[44]. This is standard follow up procedure and PrEP is only prescribed for 3 months only with no refills. A

186

PrEP user needs to visit their physician and test negative for all STIs before they receive another 3 months

187

prescription. Testing is usually subsidized by local governments or paid for by insurance companies (in the

188

case of very specific tests). In this section, we examine several scenarios of testing frequency ranging from

189

once every 2 months (more frequent than the current recommended frequency), twice per year, and once

190

every 5 years. We run a 2-dimensional 101 × 101 grid sweep of the two parameters ρ and αp . The parameter

191

ρ ranges from 10−6 to 5 × 10−5 . The parameter αp ranges from 0 to 20.

192

The parameter planes illustrate that frequent testing is essential in order to maintain a lower prevalence

193

of gonorrhea. Gonorrhea infections can reach levels as high as 60% of the population when individuals on

194

PrEP are tested only once every 5 years (Fig 3d) and 50% when tested twice every year (Fig 3b). Under both

195

testing scenarios, black regions are very thin and therefore we would require extreme measures to control

196

the propagation of the disease.

197

On the other hand, testing once every 2 months (Fig 3c) not only minimizes gonorrhea infections but

198

allows for more flexibility in parameter combinations to maintain low gonorrhea prevalence. The black region

199

in Fig 3c indicates that despite lower than necessary levels of condom use, we can still keep gonorrhea in

200

control and prevent outbreaks at baseline PrEP uptake, as long as risky behaviour does not increase too

201

much under PrEP (αp . 8). However, more frequent testing may be cost prohibitive for ministries of health.

202

Also, more frequent testing may reduce adherence since PrEP users would be required to visit their physician

203

more often and do more blood work, in this case 6 times per year (versus 4 times per year under current

204

recommendation).

205

The barrier between darker regions and lighter regions is nonlinear in these parameter planes. Moreover,

206

the parameter planes show a region of rapid increase in gonorrhea prevalence as risky behaviour (αp ) increases

207

from the pre-PrEP value to the baseline PrEP value of 12.8, for realistic testing frequencies. This shows

208

that small increases in sexually risky behaviour may not change gonorrhea prevalence very much although a

209

further increase could shift the system into a region where gonorrhea prevalence increases suddenly. Hence

210

we expect that increases in gonorrhea prevalence under PrEP may be highly dependent on the population

211

under consideration. Also, this emphasizes the importance of increasing the usage of preventive strategies

212

such as condoms.

213

Increasing condom usage in combination with increasing the testing frequency is the most

214

effective and realistic way to control gonorrhea. Here we constructed a 101 × 101 grid for ρ ranging

215

from 10−6 to 5 × 10−5 and fp ranging from 0.001 to 0.04 under four different scenarios for the value of

216

αp , representing the increase in risky behaviour after introduction of PrEP due to decreased condom usage,

217

for instance. Recall that αp = 1 corresponds to no change in risky behaviour due to PrEP, while αp > 1

218

represents an increase in risky behaviour. αp = 6.375 represents an increase in condom use (or other

219

preventive strategies) by 50% compared to the baseline value αP = 12.8, whereas αp = 25.5 represents a

220

50% decrease. αp = 63.75 represents a 5 times decrease in condom use.

221

These parameter planes confirm some of the observations of Figure 3. For instance, gonorrhea prevalence

222

decreases sharply for an intermediate range of values for the testing frequency fp . Most importantly, the

223

parameter planes show that a combination of decreasing risky behaviour through greater condom usage

224

relatively to the baseline scenario, and changing testing frequency to once every two months (Figure 4b),

225

can keep gonorrhea prevalence close to pre-PrEP levels. This is crucial since, as pointed out in the previous

226

subsection, high frequency testing may be cost prohibitive and/or may incur low adherence rates. An

227

interesting feature of Figure 4b is the switch of location of black regions from lower ρ and higher fp values

228

when αp is greater than the baseline value to higher ρ and lower fp values when αp is lower than the baseline

229

value (Figure 4a,b versus Figure 4c,d). This furthermore indicates that condom use can be very critical in

230

determining optimal policies to reduce gonorhhea prevalence.

231

Contrariwise, very low rates of condom usage (high αp , Fig 4c,d) result in very high prevalence of gonor-

232

rhea, unless the testing frequency is impractically high. Hence, condom use remains essential in the preven-

233

tion of other transmitted STIs such as gonorrhea, despite increased STI testing frequency when individuals

234

start PrEP.

235

3.2

236

Time series indicate the temporal evolution of HIV and GC prevalence, showing that changes in prevalence

237

unfold on different time scales depending on both the diseaes and the intervention scenarios (Figs 5, 6).

238

Upon the introduction of PrEP, HIV prevalence decreases exponentially from 4% to lower than 0.1% within

239

50 years, consistent with experience on the ground with PrEP programs (Fig 6a).

Time series analysis

240

Exponential behaviour, as opposed to oscillatory behaviour, is also observed for gonorrhea. All simula-

tions have resulted in a spike in gonorrhea followed by an exponential decrease to stable values (Fig 5,6).

242

The values depend on the choice of social parameters. There are exceptions to this trend. When PrEP

243

uptake rate is five times greater than baseline value, gonorrhea prevalence increases steadily until it reaches

244

a stable value of about 22% (Fig 5f). The baseline value for PrEP uptake rate reflects the current trends in

245

PrEP awareness. PrEP awareness is increasing with information being dissipated through social networks.

246

Immediate decline in gonorrhea prevalence, despite current PrEP uptake rate, is obtained when the efficacy

247

of gonorrhea treatment is 100% (Fig 6f). The efficacy of treatment is related to early diagnosis and other

248

biological factors. Interestingly, there is a situation under which we observe oscillatory behaviour in gonor-

249

rhea prevalence. If condom use is doubled for individuals who are treated for HIV, or if they get tested twice

250

as often, gonorrhea prevalence oscillates (Fig 6d,e black curves).

251

Gonorrhea prevalence increases to a maximum within a decade and then it starts dropping to a stable

252

value (Fig 5,6). The maximum increase depends on the combination of parameters. Highest levels of

253

gonorrhea prevalence range between 20% and 25%. This represents an increase of up to 60% from current

254

values. Those levels are observed if people on PrEP get tested less frequently, for example twice per year

255

(Fig 5b,e) or if their condom use is reduced by a factor of 3 (Fig 5a,d). The interesting observation, however,

256

is that the period of time until gonorrhea prevalence decreases is uniform for many parameter combinations.

257

Even if people on PrEP get tested once every month and a half or they start using condoms more often, we

258

still observe an initial spike in gonorrhea prevalence (black curves in Fig 5a,b).

259

There exist a value of PrEP uptake rate somewhere between the baseline value and 5 times the baseline

260

value where the qualitative behaviour of gonorrhea prevalence changes (Fig 5c,f). This indicates, that

261

under current social behaviour, if PrEP uptake increases, then there would be a 70% increase in gonorrhea

262

prevalence (from 16% to 22%) at equilibrium value.

263

Testing frequency is essential to maintain lower levels of gonorrhea prevalence. Individuals on PrEP, as

264

well as those who are treated for HIV, must get tested frequently otherwise gonorrhea prevalence rises (Fig

265

6e). While there are no testing policies and requirements for individuals treated for HIV, simulations show

266

that when they get tested once every 3 months versus once per year, gonorrhea prevalence falls by 60%. This

267

shows that gonorrhea prevalence is not only affected by individuals on PrEP but by other members of the

268

community as well. The average testing frequency for gay and bisexual men is roughly once every two years

269

in some populations, which is considered very low. PrEP is not the only way to prevent the transmission

270

of HIV. Even though HIV is experiencing a decline [45, 46, 47], if members of the community are tested on

271

average once per year (Fig 6b red curve), HIV will decline further.

272

4

273

Here we developed and analyzed a compartmental model of HIV and gonorrhea transmission including

274

allowances for behavioural changes upon the introduction of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) against HIV

275

infection. We found that gonorrhea prevalence increases for a wide range of parameter assumptions, due to

276

a likely increase in risky behaviour from the introduction of PrEP. Our results show that STI testing for

277

individuals on PrEP once every 3 months is not enough to prevent an increase in gonorrhea prevalence, for

278

our baseline assumptions about the impact of PrEP on risky behaviour. Moreover, increased STI testing

279

frequency alone is not enough to prevent a rise in gonorrhea prevalence because the testing frequency would

280

have to be increased to impractical levels in order to be effective. However, testing somewhat more frequently

281

than every 3 months, in combination with sufficient condom usage by individuals on PrEP, would be successful

282

in maintaining gonorrhea prevalence at pre-PrEP levels.

Discussion

283

Our model highlighted the importance of testing freqency. Testing frequency in many populations without

284

mechanisms for recall (e.g. postal or phone reminders about when it is time to get tested) can be as low as

285

once every two years. Our model predictions show that massive reductions in prevalence are possible when

286

moving from testing every two years to testing every year. This suggests it might be worthwhile to better

287

incentivize frequency STI testing.

288

Our findings about the importance of both condoms and STI testing to keep gonorrhea under control in

289

the PrEP era do not replace other good advice. For instance, STI testing once every 6 months is recommended

290

for individuals being treated for HIV infection every time they have a follow up with their physician on their

291

viral loads and overall health. Other preventive strategies include having regular partners, asking sexual

292

partners about their testing frequency and sexual habits, abstinence, adhering to treatment protocol when

293

infected by an STI, and informing sexual partners when infected with an STI.

294

We developed this model for gonorrhea, although the model assumptions are similar to those that would

295

be made for other bacterial STIs such as chlamydia or syphilis. Hence, we expect qualitatively similar

296

findings for all bacterial STIs.

297

Our model made simplifying assumptions that could influence its predictions. For instance, gonorrhea

298

and HIV, like many pathogens, are currently developing more drug resistance [48, 49, 50, 51, 52]. Gonorrhea

299

treatment efficacy is connected to early diagnosis and adherence to the medication [53]. Hence if treatment

300

for gonorrhea becomes less effective due to drug resistance, gonorrhea prevalence in many populations will

301

rise more than our model has predicted.

302

Similarly, both social dynamics and contact network structure can play a significant role in the spread of

303

infectious diseases, including HIV and gonorrhea [27, 28, 54, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61]. In future work, our

304

study design could be refined by using network simulations that account for social dynamics concerning HIV

305

and gonorrhea transmission. The continued persistence of HIV in the gay and bisexual men’s community,

306

along with the resurgence of gonorrhea and other bacterial STIs, suggests a continued and urgent need for

307

mathematical modelling studies that can help inform recommendations to result in better infection control.

Figure 2: Gonorrhea prevalence heatmaps. Testing frequency for PrEP users (fp ) and gonorrhea transmission
risk factor for PrEP users (αp ) are varied and all other parameters are held at baseline values. Different
values of PrEP uptake rate (ρ) are considered. (a) PrEP uptake rate baseline value: ρ = 2.375 × 10−6 .
The white dot locates baseline values for αp and fp . (b) No PreP uptake: ρ = 0.0. The white dot locates
values for the pre-PrEP era: fp = f and αp = 1. (c) PrEP uptake rate 50% greater than baseline value:
ρ = 3.562 × 10−6 . (d) PrEP uptake rate 5 times greater than baseline value: ρ = 1.1875 × 10−5 . Black
regions represent regions of lower gonorrhea prevalence. Yellow regions represent regions of higher gonorrhea
prevalence. Note the difference in vertical scale between the four subpanels.

Figure 5: Time series of gonorrhea prevalence over different time scales. In each subfigure, all parameters
but one are kept at baseline values. (a,d) gonorrhea transmission risk factor for PrEP users (αp ) is varied:
baseline value in red (12.75), reduced by a factor of 2 in black (6.375), augmented by a factor of 3 in yellow
(38.25). (b,e) Testing frequency for PrEP users (fp ) is varied: baseline value in red (1/90: once every 3
months), testing once every 1.5 months in black (1/45), testing twice per year in yellow (1/182). (c,f ) PrEP
uptake rate (ρ) is varied: baseline value in red (2.375 × 10−6 ), No PrEP uptake in black (0), PrEP uptake
rate 5 times greater than baseline value in yellow (1.1875 × 10−5 ).

Figure 6: Time series of gonorrhea and HIV prevalence over long time scales. In the first row, we compute
HIV prevalence. We vary (a) PrEP uptake rate ρ (no PrEP uptake ρ = 0, basline value PrEP uptake rate
and 5 times baseline value), (b) testing frequency for individuals in the susceptible class f (once every two
years, once every year, twice per year), (c) efficacy of HIV treatment h (90% effective:baseline value, 100%
effective, 60% effective). In the second row, we compute gonorrhea prevalence. We vary (d) gonorrhea
transmission risk factor for individuals who are treated for HIV (αt = 3.875 baseline value, twice lower than
baseline value, three times higher than baseline value), (e) testing frequency for individuals who are treated
for HIV ft (twice per year, once per year, once every 3 months), (f ) efficacy of gonorrhea treatment g (83%
