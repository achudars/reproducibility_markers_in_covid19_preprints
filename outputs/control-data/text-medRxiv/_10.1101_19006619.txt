An analysis of 409,693 UK Biobank participants recently published in Nature Medicine
identified a relative 21% increase in all-cause mortality among participants who were
homozygous for the Δ32 deletion in the C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 gene (CCR5).1 This is a
timely and potentially cautionary result in light of He Jiankui's controversial germline editing of
CCR5 to induce mutations that putatively mimic the effects of Δ32, which is known to reduce the
risk of HIV infection. To provide additional evidence on the association between the Δ32
deletion and mortality and assess its generalizability, we present results from three large-scale
population-based US cohorts: the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS),2 the NHSII and the Health
Professional Follow-Up Study (HPFS).3
We followed 37,650 participants (NHS 18,496; NHSII 8,276; HPFS 10,878) who donated blood
samples circa 1990 (NHS), 1994 (HPFS) and 1996 (NHS2). These participants were genotyped
as previous genome-wide association studies of several chronic diseases (including breast and
colon cancers and Type 2 Diabetes); all participants were disease-free at blood draw. Two
variants (rs113341849 and rs113010081), were used as proxies for CCR5-Δ32 (rs333) (‫ݎ‬2=0.97
and 0.94 in European 1,000 Genomes Project samples, respectively). Participant deaths were
identified via multiple sources, with documented 98% accuracy through July 2019. We used Cox

proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of death in relation to CCR5-Δ32
homozygosity (Δ32/Δ32 vs. Δ32/+ or +/+), counting person-time from age at blood draw to death
or end of study period, whichever occurred first.
During a median 21.8 years of follow-up, we documented 12,530 deaths (NHS 7,146; NHSII 306;
HPFS 5,078). In contrast to Wei et al.’s report with 13,831 deaths, neither SNP deviated from
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in our samples at blood draw: the ratio of observed to expected
heterozygotes was 1.00 for both rs113341849 and rs113010081 (P=0.64 and P=0.85). We did not
find strong support for heightened mortality among CCR5-Δ32 homozygotes in our pooled
cohorts (rs113341849: HR=1.08 [95%CI: 0.89-1.32], P=0.44; rs113010081: 1.05 [0.85-1.29],
P=0.68). Analysis within the all-female NHS and NHS2 cohorts provided little evidence for
association with mortality (rs113341849: 0.99 [0.76-1.30], P=0.95; rs113010081: 0.94 [0.701.25], P=0.66). For the all-male HPFS, we observed an apparent 20-22% increased mortality rate,
although with substantial statistical uncertainty (rs113341849: 1.22 [0.91-1.65], P=0.19;
rs113010081: 1.20 [0.89-1.63], P=0.24). There was little evidence for differences in mortality
associations between females and males (heterogeneity P=0.31 and P=0.25).
Overall, we did not find compelling evidence for a link between CCR5 deletion and shortened
lifespan. Our cohorts and UK Biobank share similarities, including European-ancestry
participants, prevalence of exposure (CCR5-Δ32 allele frequency ~10%) and comparable number
of deaths. Several differences may explain discrepancies in results. While Wei et al. used
directly genotyped markers as proxies to identify CCR5-Δ32, we used imputed markers
(imputation ‫ݎ‬2=0.69-0.84). Although disease-free at blood draw, our subjects are an ascertained
sample who lived long enough to be diagnosed with a disease or selected as an age-matched
control. Still, most deaths occurred after the ages at which our target diseases were diagnosed (75%
of deaths in these cohorts occurred after age 76), and the distribution of age at death in our
analytic sample is similar to that in the underlying full cohort; this minimizes the likelihood and
magnitude of bias due to ascertainment. In conclusion, we do not find strong evidence supporting
an association between CCR5-Δ32 homozygosity and mortality in a large sample from three USbased cohorts, suggesting that if present, the mortality association is weaker than estimated from
the original report.
