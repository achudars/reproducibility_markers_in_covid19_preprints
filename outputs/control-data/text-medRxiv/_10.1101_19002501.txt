ABSTRACT
Introduction
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common among older surgical patients, and delirium is a frequent and
serious postoperative complication. Emerging evidence suggests that OSA increases the risk for postoperative
delirium. We hypothesize that OSA is an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium, and that in patients
with OSA, perioperative adherence to positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy decreases the incidence of
postoperative delirium and its sequelae. The proposed retrospective cohort analysis study will use existing
datasets to: (i) describe and compare the incidence of postoperative delirium in surgical patients based on
OSA diagnosis and treatment with PAP; (ii) assess whether preoperatively untreated OSA is independently
associated with postoperative delirium; and (iii) explore whether preoperatively untreated OSA is independently
associated with worse postoperative quality of life. The findings of this study will inform on the potential utility
and approach of an interventional trial aimed at preventing postoperative delirium in patients with diagnosed
and undiagnosed OSA.
Methods and Analysis

Observational data from existing electronic databases will be used, including over 100,000 surgical patients
and ~10,000 intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. We will obtain the incidence of postoperative delirium in
adults admitted postoperatively to the ICU who underwent structured preoperative assessment, including OSA
diagnosis and screening. We will use doubly robust propensity score methods to assess whether untreated
OSA independently predicts postoperative delirium. Using similar methodology, we will assess if untreated
OSA independently predicts worse postoperative quality of life.
Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the Human Research Protection Office at
Washington University School of Medicine. We will publish the results in a peer-reviewed venue. Because the
data is secondary and high risk for re-identification, we will not publicly share the data. Data will be destroyed
after 1 year of completion of active IRB approved projects.

Article summary
Strengths and limitations of this study, (containing 5 short bullet points, no longer than one sentence
each, that relate specifically to the methods)
• Our granular database includes routine structured preoperative screening for OSA, processed laboratory
results, and verified comorbid diagnoses.
• We have limited information on the severity of most comorbidities, creating the possibility for substantial
residual confounding.
• Our database includes near-universal and standardized nurse-driven delirium evaluations at multiple timepoints as well as clinician diagnoses.
• Compared to prior studies, the large sample size will allow for more aggressive confounder adjustment
utilizing linked structured medical histories, intraoperative records, and administrative data.
• Selection bias and confounding by indication are important limitations, which we will address using
advanced statistical methods.

INTRODUCTION
Delirium is described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition as a disturbance
in attention, awareness, and cognition that develops over a short period of time and tends to fluctuate in
severity over the course of a day.1 It is a common postoperative complication with important costs. The
reported incidence of postoperative delirium in older adults ranges from 10-70%, depending on context.2
Patients with postoperative delirium require longer intensive care unit (ICU) stays,3 experience greater
institutionalization and death after discharge,4 and report decreased quality of life (QoL).5 As a result,
postoperative delirium is associated with a substantial increase in healthcare costs.6 7 Delirium has been
proposed as an indicator of quality of care in older adults,8 and will affect an increasing proportion of patients
as the population ages.

The current literature contains suggestive evidence that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common9 10 and
independent risk factor for postoperative delirium.11-15 In a small prospective study, Flink et al. reported that

OSA is an independent predictor of postoperative delirium in older adults undergoing total knee arthroplasty
with an odds ratio of 4.2.11 A prospective study of 92 patients undergoing cardiac surgery found that a
preoperative apnea hypopnea index of 19 or higher was associated with increased risk of postoperative
delirium (odds ratio, 6.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.6 to 15.4).15 A large observational study found that patients
with undiagnosed OSA had worse postoperative outcomes than those with diagnosed OSA.16 An exploratory
114-patient randomized trial of preoperative positive airway pressure (PAP) found no impact of the intervention
on delirium, but did find that OSA severity predicted postoperative delirium.12 A retrospective study14 and case
report13 also offer support for the relationship between OSA and postoperative delirium. Several plausible
biological explanations for this relationship exist, including hypoxia, chronic inflammation, and disruption of
normal sleep architecture as mediators.17 18 However, the studies linking OSA and postoperative delirium have
been small, and it is important to confirm or refute the association in a larger and more diverse sample.

We have previously investigated perioperative risks conferred by OSA. In the Barnes-Jewish Apnea
Prevalence in Every Admission Study (BJ-APNEAS),19 a cohort of 14,962 elective surgery patients, we found a
12.9% (n = 1939) prevalence of previously diagnosed OSA. Depending on the screening instrument, roughly
10-40% of patients without a diagnosis were identified as high risk for OSA.20 We validated a new diagnosis in
about 80% of tested patients screening as high risk.21 Therefore, the true overall prevalence of OSA was about
20-25%. Both a history of OSA and a positive OSA screen were associated with admission to the ICU
postoperatively.19 Patients with known OSA, but not those screening high risk, had longer ICU stays. Patients
screening high risk had significantly higher 1-year mortality than those with low risk scores.19 However, delirium
was not routinely assessed at that time. Others have found that these patients are at increased risk of serious
pulmonary,22 23 cardiac,14 24 and neurological18 postoperative complications.

The gold standard therapy for OSA, PAP, reduces hypoxic events, reduces markers of chronic inflammation,
and improves sleep.25-27 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) practice guidelines28 recommend the
optimization of PAP therapy prior to surgery. Unfortunately, adherence to prescribed PAP therapy is low. It is
estimated that 30% of patients who have been prescribed PAP never initiate therapy,29 and many eventually

discontinue therapy or have suboptimal adherence.30 At our preoperative assessment clinic, approximately
50% of surgical candidates with OSA report adherence with PAP therapy. Similarly, Guralnick et al. found that
only 33% of adult surgical patients with moderate or severe OSA used PAP for ≥4 hours per night.31

Our proposed retrospective cohort study has two co-primary hypotheses: (i) the presence of OSA (diagnosed
or suggested by high-risk screen) increases the incidence of postoperative delirium and (ii) adequate treatment
of OSA with PAP therapy reduces the risk of postoperative delirium. Secondary hypotheses are (i) high-risk
screenings for untreated OSA in the preoperative period are independently associated with increased risk for
postoperative delirium and (ii) untreated OSA in the preoperative period is independently associated with
decreased postoperative QoL.

Methods
Data sources and Setting
The cohort will include all adults admitted postoperatively to either our general surgical or cardiothoracic ICUs
(SICU, CTICU) between August 2012 to August 2018 who have any postoperative delirium assessments and a
pre-anesthesia evaluation (where our primary exposure is reported). Data from electronic medical record
databases at Barnes Jewish Hospital will be obtained and combined. This will include the preoperative
anesthesia assessment, preoperative laboratory values, the day-of-service inpatient record with home
medications reconciliation, the intraoperative anesthesia record, the inpatient record (providers’ notes, nursing
assessments, laboratory values, vital signs, medication administration record), and administrative records.
Although detailed socio-economic data will not be available, we will use administrative data on insurer, race,
ethnicity, and link home addresses to census-level socioeconomic measures. For some of the patients, we will
also use data from our ongoing SATISFY-SOS registry study, which tracks the intermediate term postoperative
health and well-being of unselected surgical patients (NCT02032030).32

Based on typical admissions rates to our SICU (~3,200 patients per year) and CTICU (~1,200 patients per
year), we estimate conservatively that the final dataset will include >10,000 patients. SATISFY-SOS is a

prospective registry study; we estimate that about 2,500 patients will be available for this analysis, based on
enrollment and survey completion rates.

Main Outcomes and Exposures
The main outcome will be the incidence of postoperative delirium. Several years ago, our institution
implemented routine delirium assessment in our ICUs and trained all ICU nurses to administer the Confusion
Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU).33 Patients in the SICU and CTICU are now
assessed twice daily for delirium. Scoring on the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) is also
assessed regularly and recorded, typically at the same time as the CAM if it is being performed. Patients will
be coded as delirious if they have any positive delirium assessment during their ICU stay. Each episode will be
characterized as hyperactive (RASS >0) or hypoactive (RASS ≤0).34 Secondary exploratory analyses will
examine for differences with delirium type. Although delirium occurs outside the ICU, at our institution it is
assessed is a non-systematic fashion. To avoid selectively recorded data and ascertainment biases related to
the decision to perform a CAM on the wards, we will only analyze ICU assessments. Note extraction for chart
diagnoses is not possible with this dataset and billing diagnoses do not specify a chronicity.

Previous OSA-related data from our preoperative assessment clinic (Table 1 and Figure 1) and published
literature19 20 35 were used to generate the estimated numbers of patients in each category in Figure 2. We
routinely screen with the STOP-BANG (Snoring, Tiredness, Observed Apnea, High Blood Pressure, Body
Mass Index > 35 kg/m2, Age > 50, Neck Circumference > 40 cm, Male Gender) criteria to determine OSA
risk.20 We shall implement recent modifications of the STOP-BANG instrument (e.g., including Age, BMI and
Neck Circumference as continuous rather than dichotomous variables) that have been shown to improve its
predictive value and specificity.27 36 37 PAP adherence is patient reported and documented in the preoperative
assessment. Patients will be categorized as “adherent” if they report “routine PAP use”. We will investigate if
patients with in-hospital PAP use are more similar to those with good adherence in terms of outcomes and
covariates. Hours of PAP use in the ICU are recorded in the EHR; however, this outcome is a mixture of

factors and postoperative mental status, so we do not intend to use it as a covariate or outcome.

Out of a random sample of 7,730 patients at our preoperative assessment clinic, 1,000
carried a prior diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. Treatment usage was reported for
928 of these patients. Compliance was assumed only for those who reported routine
usage of continuous positive airway pressure.

Figure 1. This figure shows data from 14,962 patients at our preoperative assessment clinic who did not carry
a prior obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosis.19

Figure 2. This figure shows a predicted breakdown of patients based on previous data from our preoperative
assessment clinic. Approximately 1,300 (13%)19 of the approximately 10,000 patients in the study cohort will
carry a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), of whom about half (~650) will have reported nonadherence to home PAP therapy (Group B). Of the remaining 8,700 patients, based on the current STOPBANG criteria, about 870 (≥5 out of 8 positive criteria) are very likely to have moderate or severe undiagnosed
OSA (Group C).20 Approximately 3,480 patients (3 or 4 positive criteria) might have undiagnosed OSA (Group
D), and ~4,350 patients (<3 positive criteria) are unlikely to have undiagnosed OSA (Group E).

SATISFY-SOS tracks intermediate-term postoperative outcomes; patients complete postoperative surveys
(approximately 1 month and 1 year after surgery) that includes the Veterans Rand 12 Item Health Survey (VR12), a validated measure of QoL. QoL will be a secondary outcome in this subset of patients; based on our
prior work with SATISFY-SOS, 1500-2000 responses (versus ~100,000 extracted the EHR) will be available
for analysis.38 We will not link to delirium or other assessments from independent studies conducted during this
period at BJH (ENGAGES, PODCAST).

Covariates
Our models will include demographics (age, race, ethnicity, sex) as well as census-tract level economic
variables. In prior work we identified several predictors of delirium: average volatile anesthetic dose, units of
blood products transfused intraoperatively, and ASA physical status.39 EuroSCORE, a measure of severity of
comorbidities, was also found to be predictive; however, it is only used for cardiac surgery, and we will
substitute the Charlson comorbidity index.40 Other predictors will include preoperative use of sedating
medications, alcohol and other intoxicants, surgery performed, baseline laboratory values (hemoglobin,
creatinine, hemoglobin A1C, INR, bilirubin, albumin), baseline pain score, history of cognitive impairment, and
preoperative psychiatric diagnoses. We will categorize procedures into a small number of “types” and use
existing calibrations between surgery code and mortality.41 Based on our prior data19 the most common
surgical types with be orthopedic (~20%), general (~10%), urologic (~10%), gyecologic (~10%), otolarygologic
(~8%), cardiothoracic (~6%), and neurosurgical (~6%). Our prior data do not contain good estimates of the ICU
admission rates for these specialties; however, we can anticipate a substantial enrichment of cardiothoracic
surgeries (at least 25%) based on the total admission rate to the CT-ICU versus SICU and a substantial
decrease in neurosurgical cases as many patients are excluded from CAM measurement. Several intra- and
postoperative variables will also be used: duration of surgery, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, total
intraoperative vasopresor and inotrope (norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, dobutamine, phenylephrine
and vasopressin) doses, intraoperative urine output, intraoperative fluids transfused, duration of coma,
mechanical ventilation, use of sedatives, opioids, hypnotics, and organ dysfunction scores.42 SATISFY-SOS
patients will additionally have multidimensional preoperative measures of anxiety, pain, functionality, stroke,
visual impairment, and cognition.43-45

Primary analysis plan and bias reduction
In our dataset there are no plausible sources of exogenous variation in OSA exposure or CPAP adherence to
eliminate bias due to unmeasured confounders. For the primary analysis, we will use a propensity-score based
approach and semi-parametric regression adjustment to reduce bias due to measured variables. We will create
propensity scores for OSA diagnosis or high STOP-BANG using non-parametric regression. We will use the

fitted propensity score and covariates in a flexible regression method based on an ensemble of decision trees
(Bayesian Adaptive Regression Trees, BART46); this two-stage approach has been shown to be valid and
robust,47-49 accounting for the uncertainty in the mechanisms of exposure and allowing nonlinear effects,
interaction terms, and heterogeneity of treatment effects.50-53 As a sensitivity analysis we will compare the
average treatment effect on the treated from our primary analysis with propensity score matching based
estimates of the same with greedy 1:1 matching.54-56 Treatment effect estimates will be reported with 99%
credible / confidence intervals. We will compare the above method to logistic regression with all variables
entered linearly for the propensity and adjustment model. We will calculate a c-statistic as well as other overall
fit statistics to assess the fit of this final model and will use the model to calculate odds ratios (with 99%
confidence intervals) associated with each predictor. In the final regression model, statistical significance will
be assumed for p values <0.01. Fitted rates in each group and the absolute risk difference (average treatment
effect on linear scale) with credible interval will also be reported.

Because some variables are plausibly on the causal pathway connecting OSA and CPAP adherence and
postoperative delirium (eg postoperative opioid and anxiolytic use could be less in those with untreated OSA
because they have OSA, leading to less delirium) simply treating them as confounders would produce biased
estimates 57 and we will initially exclude them and examine for mediation if the overall association is notable.

Secondary Analyses
We will use a similar regression method to report variables associated with PAP adherence and in-hospital
initiation of PAP. We will use a similar technique to estimate the effect of PAP on delirium given an OSA
diagnosis. QoL outcomes will be handled with a similar regression model. We will also conduct exploratory
analyses. For example, we will investigate possible mechanistic associations with delirium, if relevant data
(e.g. oxygen saturation data) are available. We will also investigate whether outcomes are different between
those who carry a diagnosis of OSA and those who screen positive for OSA. We plan to explore stratifications
according to OSA severity.

Missing Data and Loss to Follow Up
We expect that some data will be missing in the proposed study, especially as we plan to combine multiple
data sources. Depending on the types, patterns and frequencies of missing variables, we will select accepted
statistical approaches in order to minimize omission of patients from the analyses. Multiple imputation has
been shown to be robust to the violation of normality assumptions and has produced appropriate results in
similar contexts. We will conduct sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of our results with and without
imputation. There will be no imputation for the main risk factors of interest (OSA diagnosis or treatment) or for
the primary outcome of the study (incident delirium).
For our primary outcome, loss to follow up will be a negligible problem as patients are rarely discharged
while still at risk for new onset delirium. For the SATISFY-SOS cohort, efforts to minimize true loss to follow up
have been described elsewhere. 32

Power analysis
Based on the estimated numbers in each group in Figure 2, this study will be adequately powered (>80%) for
the three most relevant comparisons (i.e., delirium incidence in Group A vs. Group B; Group A vs. Groups
B+C; and Groups A+B+C vs. Group E). For example, for the comparison between the smallest groups (Group
A vs. Group B), with one sided alpha < 0.05, there is >80% power to detect a 6% difference (from 26%
observed in ENGAGES58 to 20%) in delirium incidence.59 We will not adjust the p values for multiple
comparisons. However, when assessing variables for independent associations with delirium, we shall use a
more stringent alpha value < 0.01.
Ethics and Dissemination
The Human Research Protection Office at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis has approved
this study (IRB #201311088). The conduct and reporting of this observational study will follow STROBE
guidelines.60 Once the investigation has been completed, we intend to publish the results in a peer-reviewed
publication. We also intend to present the results of this work at professional conferences for the
anesthesiology community. The nature of the dataset (high resolution clinical histories linked to administrative
records) makes de-identification a serious risk, and we do not plan to publicly share the data. Encryption will be

used for any web-based information transmitted. The data will be stored on private protected network storage.
Access will be restricted to research team members in a role-specific manner. Individual patient identifiers will
be destroyed after the linking process is complete. Because the data are purely secondary, no formal data
sharing is planned unless investigators obtain a separate approval for its access with Washington University’s
IRB. Primary outcomes will be pre-specified, as will analytical techniques. Additional not pre-specified analyses
will be treated as hypothesis-generating.

Patient and Public Involvement
No explicit patient or public comment was sought in the design of the study. Patient-centered research has
previously identified ICU delirium as a life-changing event with major consequences to quality of life; examples
of patient experiences can be found at icudelirium.org. Because this is a retrospective database study, no
attempt will be made to directly contact patients with the findings.
Discussion
This large observational study will clarify if there is an independent link between OSA and postoperative
delirium in the ICU. It will also show if this hypothetical increased risk is mitigated by treatment with PAP. It is
important in science to replicate previous findings,61-63 which in the case of this study is the reported
association between OSA and postoperative delirium,11 12 although this time in a broader surgical population.
Because of its large size, this study will be useful for comparison between and among groups based on other
risk factors.

This study will have important strengths compared to the existing literature, most notably the very large and
granular database including routine structured preoperative screening for OSA, and postoperative delirium
detection in the ICU setting. The sample size will allow for a more aggressive confounder adjustment
compared to smaller studies. The population will be diverse in both comorbidities and surgery performed,
allowing a more tailored identification of patients who benefit from PAP and greater generalizability. As with
other large retrospective studies, purely statistical error will be small in magnitude. We have a relatively high
quality assessment of medical confounders due to our experienced preoperative clinic and a well-implemented

assessment of delirium reducing measurement error in key variables. We have largely pre-specified our
analysis, reducing the potential for "analyst degrees of freedom" introducing spuriously high confidence after
multiple comparisons. The statistical approach should provide a strong predictive model and reduce the degree
of “overfitting” compared to common techniques like stepwise selection. 64-68

There are important limitations to the approach we are taking in this observational study. Foremost is selection
bias. Patients who seek and adhere to treatment are different in many difficult to observe ways from those who
do not. For example, PAP diagnosis and adherence (conditional on severity) is likely associated with
socioeconomic status, care of other chronic conditions, and coping strategies. Presence of OSA or nonadherence to prescribed PAP could induce surgeons to not offer highly invasive procedure options (reducing
surgical severity), cause patients to present later (increasing surgical severity), or cause patients with an
otherwise lower burden of morbidity to be more aggressively admitted to the ICU where they are eligible for
delirium assessments. OSA severity is likewise associated with both PAP diagnosis and adherence, making
the net direction of confounding difficult to predict. Differing from selection bias, downstream indirect effects of
OSA such as additional supplemental oxygen, higher usage of telemetry monitoring, and avoidance of
sedating drugs may be protective. Although our preoperative clinic assessments are routinely thorough
medical histories, we will have limited information on the severity of most comorbidities, leaving residual
confounding. Most comorbidities are reported simultaneously, meaning that we will not be able to distinguish
between confounders and mediators; simply adjusting for them may increase or decrease bias. Our
intraoperative measures suffer the same difficulty.

The common problem of missing data can reduce the statistical power of a study and can produce biased
estimates and invalid conclusions if severe. There are measurement errors for both the primary exposure and
outcome which will decrease the validity of the associations. These analyses rely on subjective patient
reporting of OSA history and PAP adherence. The STOP-BANG screening while reasonably accurate, is
imperfect and may create false positives. We will try to confirm the diagnosis of OSA in our study subjects with
the data available to us. Unfortunately, objective measures of PAP adherence from the actual PAP devices will

not be available. Because patients tend to over-estimate their own adherence,69 70 we expect that using selfreported adherence will tend to under-estimate its influence on postoperative delirium rather than suggest a
falsely positive association. We will attempt to obtain information from the electronic health record on inhospital use of home PAP devices, since this may signify home adherence with PAP therapy. Treatment with
alternative modalities, such as mandibular advancement devices, is not being assessed. OSA severity may be
a key parameter which will be unable to obtain; others have found that apnea-hypopnea indices greater than
15 71 or 30 72 associated with postoperative complications. We have undertaken substantial efforts to
standardize assessment of delirium in our ICUs as described above; however, there is doubtless error due to
busy nursing staff and subjective elements in the assessment. Because PAP and OSA symptoms could
influence delirium assessment, these errors may be informative and create additional bias.

The most rigorous way to answer whether treatment of OSA prevents postoperative delirium would be to
conduct a prospective randomized, controlled trial of perioperative PAP in patients already diagnosed with
OSA who are scheduled for elective surgery. However, given the established benefits of PAP in these patients,
it would be unethical to randomize patients (especially those already prescribed PAP) to a non-treatment arm.
Therefore, a large observational study is likely to be the most appropriate initial design for addressing this
question.

Evidence of an independent risk association between untreated OSA and postoperative delirium would
strongly warrant further investigation. An important question for future prospective study would be whether
efforts at diagnosing OSA in the immediate preoperative period could mitigate postoperative delirium and its
sequelae. We believe that this would be feasible, since we have already demonstrated within our institution
that it is practical to identify patients with probable undiagnosed OSA using simple, economical screening
methods.19 This study will further identify patients likely to benefit from focused interventions.

If we find that PAP non-adherence and untreated OSA are independent risk factors for postoperative delirium,
this would inform two key priorities. First, it would reinforce the importance of promoting adherence to

perioperative PAP therapy. Second, it would provide a strong impetus for conducting a randomized controlled
trial in elective-surgery patients with undiagnosed OSA, which we could not ethically implement in patients who
already carry a diagnosis of OSA. We hope to use the foundational work proposed in this observational study
to guide the design of such a trial, with the goals of reducing postoperative delirium and improving associated
outcomes for the large number of patients at risk due to OSA.
