Abstract
Background

Antibiotic resistance is an important global public health issue, perpetuated by increases
in antibiotic use. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), tackling antibiotic
resistance bacteria is especially challenging. Due to high rates of infectious disease and
continuing high mortality from untreated bacterial infections, policy must balance
tackling both antibiotic access and antibiotic overuse. This paper investigates the social
and health-seeking determinants that impact appropriate and inappropriate antibiotic
use in Vietnamese children under 5 for Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI).

Methods

Descriptive analyses and logistic regression models were performed on country-wide
household data from UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in 2006, 2011, 2014.

Results

Results show that antibiotic overuse is higher in those who sought care from a
healthcare provider than those who self-treated. In 2014, children who sought care at
private facilities and government facilities were more likely to overuse antibiotics for
mild respiratory infections (OR 6.1 and OR 3.8 respectively) than those who did not seek
care at private and government facilities respectively. Furthermore, higher
socioeconomic level was associated with both appropriate antibiotic use for pneumonia
and inappropriate for mild ARI. Children in the poorest households in 2011 and 2014
were less likely to appropriately use antibiotics than those from other socioeconomic
levels (OR 0.37 and 0.025 respectively). And children in the poorest households in 2014
were less likely to inappropriately use antibiotics for mild ARI than all other
socioeconomic levels (OR 0.36).

Conclusions

These findings support, challenge, and broaden current understandings of antibiotic
usage in Vietnam. Our results suggest that inappropriate antibiotic use arises from the
provider and institutional level. Consequently, we argue that community education
efforts and enforcing antibiotics as prescription-only is insufficient. Instead, more focus
should be made on reducing financial incentives and infrastructural weaknesses at
hospitals and health centres. Furthermore, our results show the need to provide the
poorest households with sufficient access to antibiotics. Health policy should tackle the
issue of inappropriate use of antibiotics for mild ARI among higher socioeconomic
groups.

Antibiotic Resistance

Background

Antibiotic resistance, the ability of bacteria and other microorganisms to resist
the effects of an antibiotic, is a global epidemic (Levy 1998). Antibiotic resistance occurs
naturally but exposure to antibiotics accelerates the biological process (Ventola 2015).
The prominent forms of misuse in communities and primary health-care in Asia include
using antibiotics for viral infections and buying antibiotics over-the-counter without a
prescription from a qualified health worker (Levy 1998).
Antibiotic resistance poses a unique, complex, and pressing issue in low- and
middle-income countries (LMICs). Since the first introduction of antibiotics, they now
constitute the single largest group of drugs purchased in most LMICs (Larsson et al.
2000). The burden of infectious disease remains high in LMICs, accounting for 25% of
deaths worldwide and 45% of deaths in LMICs (WHO 2000). Antibiotic resistance is
therefore a low priority in LMICs compared to the immediate challenges of infectious
diseases (Kotwani and Holloway 2011). The threat of the loss of antibiotics in the future
does not pose the same urgency as current deaths. However, without concern for the
issue of resistance, current antibiotics will soon be insufficient to combat future
epidemics.
Thus, LMICs such as Vietnam face a dual challenge: combatting their high
burden of infection and mitigating antibiotic resistance. Research and policy for these
nations must consider both the issue of drug access and resistance.
Antibiotic resistance in Vietnam is high. Escherichia coli in rural Vietnamese
preschool children fecal samples has high resistance to ampicillin (65%), tetracycline
(74%) and co-trimoxazole (68%) (Dyar 2012). And in hospital wastewater, 83% of
Escherichia coli isolates were resistance to at least one antibiotic and 32% were multidrug resistant (Lien 2017). In Vietnam, 91% of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were
found to be resistant to macrolides and 38% to penicillin (CDDEP 2019). In comparison,
in the UK, the resistance percentages for penicillin and macrolides in Streptococcus
pneumoniae bacteria were 5% and 6% respectively (CDDEP 2019).
Acute Respiratory Illness in Vietnam
Acute respiratory illness (ARI) prevalence is high in LMICs such as Vietnam.
Pneumonia, (ARI with severe symptoms), can be caused by bacteria such as
Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Without diagnostics such as
point-of-care or laboratory testing, antibiotics are prescribed or sold for any respiratory
infection with pneumonia-like symptoms. Pneumonia is the 3rd top cause of mortality
in Vietnam, the 2nd most common cause of death from infections, and the 2nd leading
cause of mortality in children under 5 (GARP, 2010).

Health Infrastructure
Hospital infrastructure in Vietnam contributes to inappropriate antibiotic use in
various ways. One way is due to the rapidly-developing network of over 60,000 private
pharmacies and unlicensed drug-sellers, which allow patients to self-medicate,
bypassing the public health system to obtain medications. Self-medicating is especially
common in rural and lower income individuals, who have limited access to healthcare
facilities (GARP 2010). On the other hand, wealthier households have greater access to
hospitals, which provide better healthcare and consume a larger share of health services
(GARP 2010). Only larger facilities such as provincial and national hospitals have
capacity to perform bacterial culture, identification, and susceptibility testing.
Furthermore, there is a shortage of trained staff in the health care sector, with a
low nurse-to-doctor ratio, lack of specialists and trained managers, and many vacancies
in rural and remote areas. The shortage means that healthcare providers often do not
have enough time to educate patients on correct medication usage.
Poor infection prevention and control in hospitals is an additional driver of high
antibiotic use, which perpetuates resistance.
Purchasing Practices
As in many countries, causes of antibiotic misuse in Vietnam include the
perceived expectations of patients, physician? time constraints, lack of knowledge, lack
of diagnostic capability, and financial benefits for the prescriber (GARP 2010). The
availability of antibiotics as over-the-counter drugs and poor enforcement of pharmacy
regulations exacerbates misuse. In 2014, after issuing of the 2005 Drug Law, which
required antibiotics to be sold with prescription only, antibiotics were sold without a
prescription in 88% of randomly surveyed urban drug sale transactions, and 91% of
rural transactions (Nga et al. 2014).
Consumer habits may explain why over-the-counter antibiotic sales are so high.
Urban and rural respondents report that patients avoid visiting doctors due to
inconvenience in cost and time, and prefer visiting private pharmacies for mild diseases
(Nga et al. 2014; Duong, Binns, and Le 1997). It is unclear whether this habit applies to
children. Any mild illness may cause parental concern and financial constraints are less
limited due to universal health insurance for children under 6.
Economic Incentives
Antibiotics were the most common drug sold in both urban and rural Vietnamese
pharmacies (Nga et al. 2014). 31% of urban and 35% of rural sites admitted that the high
profitability of antibiotic sales contributed to their inappropriate sale (Nga et al. 2014).
And rural and urban pharmacists reported that they feared losing customers and felt
pressure from patients to inappropriately dispense antibiotics.

Knowledge Amongst Healthcare Providers and Caretakers
Misconceptions about antibiotic use has changed in the urban population due to
better economic conditions and higher education levels (Nga et al. 2014). However,
rural customers consider antibiotics to be a miracle drug and often request it for a
private stock for self-medication (Nga et al. 2014). In fact, only 13% of caregivers from
Bavi, Vietnam (a rural district of Hanoi) demonstrated correct knowledge of ARI
management according to standard guidelines (Hoa et al. 2011). But knowledge was not
correlated with caregiver practice (Hoa et al. 2011). Instead, it is likely that caregivers
follow healthcare provider recommendations, indicating that healthcare providers play a
large role in antibiotic practices (Hoa et al. 2011).
Self-Medication versus Health Care Provider
It is unclear whether the more important driver of inappropriate antibiotic use is
self-medication or health care providers. On one hand, self-medicating individuals may
be more likely to use antibiotics than those who seek advice from health professionals
(Okumura, Wakai, and Umenai 2002; GARP 2010). On the other hand, seeking
healthcare for mild ARI at any health facility may increase the risk of unnecessary
antibiotics (Larsson et al. 2005; Hoa et al. 2011). Further investigation using nationwide
data is therefore important to clarify the root source of misuse.
Purpose and Research Questions
No publications that we are aware of have investigated country-wide antibiotic
use and care-seeking over time in Vietnam. Nor have there been nationwide
investigations for children under 5. Current research has also neglected to assess
specific social and healthcare determinants that impact antibiotic use on a country-wide
level. Our research aims to fill this gap in knowledge. By further understanding the
structural and cultural factors that contribute to antibiotic use in Vietnam, policymakers can create targeted and effective interventions.
We aim to answer three main questions:
1) Was there a change in antibiotic usage in children under 5 between 2006 and
2014?
2) Was there a change in the type of healthcare provider sought for antibiotics in
children under 5 between 2011 and 2014?
3) What are the social and health-seeking determinants of care-seeking, correct
antibiotic use and antibiotic misuse?

Methods
Data sources
Our research uses publicly available datasets to look at antibiotic usage for ARI in
Vietnamese children under 5. We used UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey
(MICS) datasets for the years 2006, 2011, and 2014. These were nationally
representative household surveys, conducted using stratified clustered sample designs.
Survey data were weighted for all three years in order to better reflect the general
population characteristics of Vietnam (UNICEF 2019).
Indicators and Variable Definitions
We included data for all children under five years for whom data was available.
The definitions used for outcome variables, healthcare providers and social
determinants are given in detail in Table 1. We attempted to follow the most recent
IMCI guidelines as closely as possible and defined self-reported “signs and symptoms of
pneumonia” as cough with fast or difficulty breathing, related to a problem in the chest.
We were unable to identify signs and symptoms of severe pneumonia as questions about
danger signs or stridor were not included in the questionnaire. We were unable to
distinguish between bacterial and nonbacterial pneumonia due to lack of confirmatory
tests. We defined mild ARI (not pneumonia) as those that either had 1) only cough (and
no rapid or difficult breathing), or 2) cough and difficulty breathing but not related to a
problem in the chest. Any antibiotic use for mild-ARI cases was classified as
“inappropriate antibiotic use.”
Social Determinants
Healthcare facilities were classified as government facilities, private facilities, and
private pharmacies. Individuals who obtained antibiotics on their own accord without
going to a formal healthcare provider, are defined as performing “self medication.” This
included individuals who went to a pharmacy but no other healthcare provider.
Throughout the paper, these individuals will also be distinguished through the term “no
resource.” The MICS survey data contained five socioeconomic classes: Lowest, Second,
Middle, Fourth, Highest. 2006 MICS Data contain data regarding the gender of the
household head. 2006, 2011, and 2014 data all contain gender of the child. We included
maternal education as a known determinant of socioeconomic level and child’s health.
Education and wealth are correlated but not 100%. The MICS maternal education data
contain five categories: Primary, Lower secondary, Upper secondary, Professional
school, College/university.

Statistical Analysis
Logistic regression models were developed to analyze the main effects of
social/health-seeking determinants on correct antibiotic use and antibiotic misuse. The
exponentiated regression coefficients were interpreted as odds ratios. The independent
variables investigated were urban/rural, socioeconomic class, maternal education, child
age, child gender, government facility, and private facility. Socioeconomic class and
maternal education were treated as categorical variables due to their seemingly nonlinear relationship with antibiotic use.
Ethics
All analyses were based on secondary analysis of publicly available data from
national surveys and no separate ethical approval was required.
Availability of data and materials
The datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available in
the UNICEF MICS repository, MICS UNICEF Surveys under Viet Nam.
Role of the funding source
There was no external funding for this study during study design, data collection,
data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author
had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to

Results
General Characteristics Trends
Children with symptoms of pneumonia decreased from 4.3% of total children
under 5 population in 2006 to 1.2% of total children with cough in 2014 (Table 2). And
the proportion of children under 5 with symptoms of pneumonia who correctly used
antibiotics increased from 63% in 2006 to 83% in 2014 (Table 2). In 2014, the incorrect
use of antibiotics for mild ARI was as high as correct use for pneumonia - 82%
compared to 83% respectively (Table 2).

Determinants of Appropriate Antibiotic Use (for cough with pneumonia-like
symptoms)
Children from households in the highest socioeconomic level in 2006 and 2011
were about 4 times more likely than all other levels to use antibiotics for pneumonia
(Table 3). In 2011, children in the fourth socioeconomic level (second highest) were 7
times more likely to use antibiotics for pneumonia. On the other hand, children from the
lowest and second-lowest socioeconomic levels in 2011 were 63% and 73% less likely to
use antibiotics for pneumonia (Table 3). In 2014, the poorest families were 98% less
likely to use antibiotics for pneumonia (Table 3).
A higher proportion of children from households with a female head used
antibiotics for pneumonia than those in households with a male head in 2006 (83%
versus 54% respectively) (Figure 1).

Determinants of Inappropriate Antibiotic Use (for mild ARI)
Children who sought care from a health care provider had a significantly higher
proportion of antibiotic use for mild ARI than those who did not (86% versus 71%)
(Figure 2). The higher misuse in those who sought care is present in both urban and
rural children: 81% versus 49% in urban settings, and 83% versus 36% in rural settings
(Figure 2).
The highest socioeconomic level was more likely to use antibiotics for mild ARI
(OR = 1.6, p = 0.07) (Table 4). And the lowest socioeconomic level was less likely than
all other socioeconomic classes to use antibiotics for mild ARI (OR = 0.36, p < 0.005)
(Table 4). Children who sought care at private facilities were 6 times more likely than all
other socioeconomic classes to misuse antibiotics (OR = 6.1, p < 0.005) (Table 4).
Children who sought care at government facilities were 3.8 times more likely to misuse
(OR = 3.8, p < 0.005) (Table 4).

Discussion
Our nation-wide analysis indicates that Vietnamese healthcare providers may be
perpetuating, rather than mitigating, antibiotic misuse. Thus, inappropriate antibiotic
use in Vietnam is not only due to lack of knowledge in the community but also provider
and institutional level problems. Our results also show disparities in antibiotic use
amongst socioeconomic levels, with the lowest socioeconomic levels still less likely to
obtain antibiotics for pneumonia than higher levels. However, higher socioeconomic
levels were not only more likely to correctly use antibiotics but also to overuse the drugs
for mild ARI cases.
Healthcare Provider
Our results suggest that those who seek advice from a healthcare provider are
more likely to use antibiotics for mild ARI (Figure 2, Table 2). This is evident in the
lowest socioeconomic level, and in both rural and urban settings (Figure 2). The results
complicate the current assumptions that self-medication in low-income rural areas is a
contributing factor to inappropriate antibiotic use (GARP 2010). Our nation-wide
analysis indicates that Vietnamese healthcare providers may be contributing to
antibiotic misuse rather than reducing it. So misuse is due to not only lack of knowledge
in the community but also issues such as financial incentives in providers and
infrastructural inadequacies.
Socioeconomic Level
Lower proportions of children from low socioeconomic households are using
antibiotics for pneumonia compared to higher socioeconomic levels. The pattern of
increased use between 2006 and 2014 reflected “elite capture”, with the most well-off
families gaining better access first. In 2014, among all socioeconomic levels except the
poorest, more than 80% of children with pneumonia received antibiotics (Figure 1C).
Antibiotic access increased first for the highest socioeconomic level, with levels already
high in 2006. The second highest socioeconomic level experienced a large increase in
antibiotic usage for pneumonia from 2006 to 2011 (51% to 95%). The middle
socioeconomic level increased their antibiotic use more gradually between 2006 and
2011 and again between 2011 and 2014. The second-lowest socioeconomic level had
their largest increase in antibiotic usage later, from 2011 to 2014 (46% to 95%).
However, the lowest class did not change in their correct antibiotic usage between 2006
and 2014, with less than 75% of children obtaining antibiotics. Logistic regression
results support this descriptive analysis, with the highest socioeconomic level more
likely to use antibiotics for pneumonia in 2006 and 2011 compared to all other levels

(Table 2). And children from the lowest and second-lowest levels are less likely to
correctly use antibiotics compared to those of other levels. Thus, in the fight against
antibiotic overuse and resistance, it is important to remember that there are children
from poor families who still fail to obtain antibiotics when needed.
Antibiotic use for mild ARI (inappropriate use) is also significantly higher in the
highest socioeconomic level compared to the lowest (Figure 2C). And children from the
highest socioeconomic levels are 1.6 times more likely to inappropriately use antibiotics
compared to other socioeconomic levels, while children from the lowest socioeconomic
levels are 64% less likely to misuse antibiotics compared to other levels (Table 4). These
results indicate that having the financial means to obtain antibiotics not only increases
propensity to use antibiotics for pneumonia (correct use) but also to use them for mild
ARI (inappropriate use). This trend may reflect the cultural view of antibiotics as a cureall. It also suggests a lack of knowledge of correct antibiotic usage in higher
socioeconomic levels in spite of their higher education levels.
Household Head
A higher proportion of children in households with a female head used antibiotics
for pneumonia than those in households with a male head (83% versus 54%
respectively). It is possible that households with a female head have other
characteristics that make it more likely for their child to have access to antibiotics.
Further research is needed to clarify this result.
Urban-Rural Divide
No significant differences in correct antibiotic use and misuse were found in
urban versus rural locations. The lack of significant differences suggest that antibiotic
use for children is more impacted by socioeconomic constraints than barriers in
transportation and physical access.
Broader Implications
Overall, this paper’s nationwide results show that healthcare-seeking and high
socioeconomic levels increase the propensity for inappropriate antibiotic use. Therefore,
improving antibiotic stewardship efforts in health departments, hospitals, and
healthcare providers are just as important as improving community-level
understanding. Of course, it is impossible to completely disentangle healthcare
inadequacies from insufficient information at the community level. A trickle-down effect
is likely to occur, wherein infrastructural inadequacies contribute to misinformation in
the community. Patient expectations are also known to contribute to incorrect
prescription practices (Vinker, Ron, and Kitai 2003; Macfarlane et al. 1997; MangioneSmith et al. 2001). Furthermore, parenting style may contribute to a distinct parental
demographic in those who sought care from a provider. This nuance is a potential
confounding influence, but does not detract from the reality of the general trend.

Limitations
There were some limitations to this analysis. Although UNICEF surveys use
similar methodology and questionnaires at each time point, there were some small
differences. Only 2014 data provided information about inappropriate antibiotic use for
mild ARIs. In 2006 and 2011 questionnaires, the question about antibiotic usage was
skipped for those with mild ARI.
Different seasons will affect disease prevalence especially in ARI, which are
greater during the wintertime. Only 2014 surveys indicated the season (Dec 2013 – April
2014) during which the questionnaires were distributed. Therefore, our comparison of
2006, 2011, and 2014 general trend characteristics were made under the assumption
that the 2006 and 2011 surveys were conducted during similar seasons. However, given
that there is a decreasing trend in ARI and the 2014 survey was conducted during the
peak ARI season, decreases in ARI over time are likely to be real. Furthermore,
antibiotic use decisions for those with ARI should not be influenced by season.
Furthermore, the UNICEF data provides information only on whether a child
obtained antibiotics for pneumonia-like symptoms or mild ARI. The duration of
antibiotic usage is unknown. Therefore, “correct” antibiotic use assumes that anyone
who obtained antibiotics for ARI is using it according to prescription instructions. This
paper could not assess lack of adherence to drug instructions as another form of
antibiotic misuse. The data also lacks the class and type of antibiotic use, so we are
unable to discern whether the narrow or broad spectrum antibiotics were used.
Additional limitations of the research stem from the nature of survey data. Survey
data is self-reported to the interviewer, so response bias and inaccurate caretaker recall
are possible. Furthermore, pneumonia and ARI are diagnoses normally made by
medical professionals that may not fully correlate with the indicators used here.

Conclusion
Our findings support, challenge, and broaden current understandings of
antibiotic usage in Vietnam. In fact, our results suggest that inappropriate antibiotic use
arises from the provider and institutional level. Consequently, we argue that community
education efforts and enforcing antibiotics as prescription-only is insufficient. Instead,
more focus should be made on reducing financial incentives and infrastructural
weaknesses at hospitals.
Furthermore, even in the midst of antibiotic overuse and resistance, the issue of
antibiotic access should not be overlooked. Policy efforts should improve access to
primary care, such as transportation and hours of service, in order to increase access to
antibiotics for those who need it in low income groups.
