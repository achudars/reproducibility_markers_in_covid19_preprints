Abstract
PURPOSE:
CR-1 (CR-1) is an oncofetal protein with its role as a key factor in early process of carcinoma
has been evaluated in cases of various cancers. However, very few studies have reported its
role in oral cancers, which is the sixth most common cancer around the world, particularly
with high prevalence in developing countries. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the
most predominant (90%) of all the histological types of oral cancer. Late detection,
associated with increased morbidity and mortality, is mainly attributed to non-availability of
a suitable biomarker for the disease. In the present pilot study we have evaluated the role of
soluble CR-1, in serum as a potential tumor marker for OSCC.
METHODS:
CR-1 was estimated using sandwich ELISA in serum samples of 50 biopsy proven OSCC
patients (pre and post treatment) along with age and gender matched healthy controls.
Immunohistochemistry was also done in corresponding tumor tissue sections to check the
expression of CR-1.
RESULTS:
Pre-treatment CR-1 was found to be 2.25 fold higher in serum of OSCC patients as compared
to control (p<0.0001***), which was reduced to 1.6 folds post treatment (p=0.0006***). CR1 levels were comparatively higher in early stage of disease. Upon IHC 80% of the cases
were found to be positive for CR-1.

CONCLUSION:
This study provides evidence that serum levels of CR-1 are elevated in patients of Oral
Squamous Cell Carcinoma, which decrease post treatment. Also, the association of
expression of protein with tumor progression predicts CR-1 as a molecule that can be further
evaluated as a potential tumor maker in OSCC.

1. Introduction
Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) accounts for about 90% of neoplasm originated
from oral cavity and is the sixth most prevalent cancer in the world [1]. The annual estimated
incidence is around 300,000 globally of which 62% cases occur in developing countries
[2].The risk factors associated with the disease are smoking, alcohol consumption or tobacco
consumption [3–5]. A significant genetic-environmental interaction and viral association such
as HPV have also been marked as potential risk factors [6–13].
Despite the fact that oral cavity is easily accessible for regular clinical examinations, OSCC
is mostly detected at late stages [14]. Tissue biopsy with histopathological evaluation is the
most reliable method for diagnosis of OSCC till date [15, 16]. With the progress in the
medical and basic sciences, there has been improvements in the management strategies with
better understanding of the pathogenesis of OSCC at molecular level. However, the survival
rates have not improved over the last several decades [17], mostly attributed to nonavailability of suitable tumor marker.
Thus, identification of a potential tumor marker for OSCC is definitely be beneficial to
diagnose the disease at earlier stages and presumed to result in better outcomes.
Cripto-1 (CR-1) is an oncofetal protein encoded by gene located on chromosome 3p21 [18].
It belongs to EGF-CFC (epidermal growth factorCR-1-FRL-1-Cryptic) family [19]. CR-1,
like other EGF-CFC proteins, found to play a role in embryogenesis, where it functions along
with nodal, TGF-β (transforming growth factor-β ) and GDF-1/GDF-3 (Growth and
differentiation factor 1 and 3) as their co-receptor [20]. During embryogenesis it is found to
be involved in gastrulation, specification of endoderm and mesoderm, cardiogenesis etc. [21].
In vitro studies, reporting induction of transformation of a variety of cells by overexpressed
CR-1, provide the evidence of its oncogenic activity [22, 23]. Structurally, CR-1 consists of

four major domains which are; a signal peptide domain at amino terminal, an Epidermal
Growth Factor-like domain, a cysteine-rich domain and a short domain, present at carboxyl
terminal (hydrophobic in nature), containing sequence for glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)
anchorage and cleavage [20]. The GPI anchorage and cleavage sequence is responsible for
existence of CR-1 in two distinct forms, i.e. membrane bound form and soluble secretory
form. Although both the forms have been found active in tumorigenesis, membrane bound
form, is proposed to be the key player in this process. Various studies have shown
involvement of membrane bound CR-1 in process of early carcinogenesis, growth and
survival of tumor tissue, metastasis etc. [21]. Studies carried out in a number of tumor tissues
of various biological sites viz; breast, colon, gastric, lung, liver suggest this role of membrane
bound CR-1 [24]. On the other hand, soluble/secretory form has been proposed to be related
to the disease progression and prognosis.
There is only one study showing relevance of CR-1 in Oral Cancer. Yoon H.J. et al, in 2011,
reported high expression of membrane bound CR-1 in tumor tissue of oral squamous cell
carcinoma (OSCC) patients [25]. However, the study did not include the expression analysis
of soluble form of CR-1. As the estimation of soluble CR-1 from serum is much easier by
using methods like ELISA than IHC from tumor tissue as reported by Yoon HJ, it may be
used for repeated measurements aiming to the response to the therapy as a prognostic marker.
In present pilot study we evaluated soluble form of CR-1 from serum of the histologically
diagnosed patients of OSCC as a potential diagnostic and/or prognostic marker for the first
time.

2. Materials and methods
2.1 Patients and specimen collection
After ethical approval by Institutional Ethics Committee, patients and healthy volunteers
were included in the study after obtaining written informed consent. Fifty biopsy proven
OSCC patients attending the Department of Radiotherapy were included in the study. Patients
intended for curative radical radiotherapy with 60Gy fractionated doses were included in the
study. As there is no prior scientific literature available regarding the levels of soluble CR-1
in serum of OSCC patients, we planned the study to be pilot study and included 50
consecutive patients matching our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients received prior
treatment or planned for palliative treatment were excluded. Blood samples from patients and
healthy controls (age and sex matched) were collected. Serum was separated and stored in 80˚C for further use for estimation of soluble CR-1 by ELISA. Histological biopsy sample of
the corresponding patients were also processed for confirmation of diagnosis as well as
immunohistochemistry (IHC) to check expression of membrane bound CR-1 levels.
2.2 Clinical parameters of the patients
Clinical parameters of each patient were noted including age, gender, tumor differentiation, T
stage, N stage and TNM stage. All the patients were followed up for their grade and stage of
disease and disease relapse (if any) and survival were recorded on the basis of follow-up.
2.3 ELISA
A sandwich type serum ELISA was done using DY145 ELISA kit for CR-1 by R&D
system™ USA, following manufacturer protocol. Briefly, 4µg/mL of capture antibody was
coated in a 96-well plate. 100µL of neat serum samples followed by 500ng/mL of detection
antibody were incubated at room temperature for 2 hours respectively. Signal detection was

performed by incubating streptavidin-HRP and colorized by ortho-phenylenediamine
substrate solution (Hi-media, MB-204, India). Human recombinant CR-1 (provided in the kit)
was used as standard. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm to determine the colorimetric
signal.
2.4 Immunohistochemistry
Parafinized tissue section was fixed on poly-L-Lysine coated glass slides. After
deparafinization, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked. Further, antigen retrieval was
undertaken by boiling in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for half an hour. The CR-1 antibody
(ab19917 Abcam, USA) was used. Detection was done by HRP conjugated antibody by
DAKO (Real EnvisionTM Denmark) and colorized by DAB. Pancreatic tissue was used as
positive control. The results IHC were analyzed by two independent observers.
2.5 Statistical analysis
For statistical analysis, GraphPad Prism 6 software was used. Mann Whitney test and
Wilcoxon matched pair test were used to check the significance of the results, p ≤ 0.05 is
taken to be significant for all tests.
ROC curve analysis was done to find out the specificity and sensitivity of the test.
3. Results
Fifty histologically confirmed OSCC patients were included in the study. Most of the patients
were male (49, 98%) with age between 30-80 years (median ~54 years). The control
population involved was age and gender matched (Table 1). Clinical stage was T1/T2 in 46%
(n=23) of cases and T3/T4 in 54% (n=27) cases; N0/N1 in 60% (n=30) cases and N2/N3 in 40%
(n=20), however none of the cases enrolled in our study had any distant metastasis.

3.1 High levels of serum CR-1 in OSCC patients
We have previously shown that serum CR-1 levels of cancer patients were found to be
increased by 2.25-fold as compared to control (Fig 1A) with a mean value of 365.10pg/mL
and 167.36pg/mL respectively (p=0.0001***) [26].
CR-1 levels and association with clinical variables
Association between serum CR-1 levels and cancer staging and grading was also evaluated.
CR-1 levels were found to be increased significantly both in early (T1&T2; p<0.0001***) and
late stage (TNM classification) of the disease (T3&T4; p<0.0001***). Moreover it was also
found that there was more increase in CR-1 level in early stage (T1/T2) than the late stage
(T3/T4) (Fig 1B). CR-1 levels were increased significantly in all the stages as per tumor size
(T stage) i.e., T1 (p=0.0021**), T2 (p<0.0001***), T3 (p=0.0002***) and T4 (p=0.0204*),
nodal involvement (N stage) i.e. N0 (p<0.0001***), N1 (p=0.0029**) and N2 (p=0.0045**)
and histological grading i.e. moderately differentiated (p<0.0001***) and poorly
differentiated (p=0.003**)(Fig. 1C, 1D & 1E).
CR-1 levels decreased in patients post treatment
The mean level of CR-1 in patients which was 365.10pg/mL decreased to 260.18pg/mL after
treatment with radiotherapy and/or surgery suitable for grade and stage of tumor (Fig 2A)
with a significance level of p=0.0002***.
Both, early (T1&T2; p<0.01*) and late stage (TNM classification) of the disease (T3&T4;
p<0.01*) showed significant decrease in CR-1 levels upon treatment (Fig 2B). Though the
levels decreased in all the histological grades, however only in moderately differentiated

histological grades of tumor tissue, levels were significantly decreased post treatment
(p=0.03*) (Fig 2C).
Increased CR-1 levels were associated with all the stages of tumor size (T staging) and lymph
nodes involvement (N staging). The decrease in levels were found in all the stages of tumor
size (T staging) and lymph nodes involvement (N staging) post treatment, however the
decrease was statistically significant only in earlier stages i.e. T2 stage (p=0.0024**) and No
stage (p=0.0010***) (Fig 2D & 2E).
CR-1 levels do not decrease in patients with post treatment residual disease
Upon follow-up patients were divided into two categories based on their disease status, one
group included patients with no evidence of disease (denoted as NED) after treatment by
clinical and radiological examination and the other included patients with residual disease
(denoted as RD) after treatment. It was observed that patient group with no evidence of
disease reflected significant decrease in CR-1 levels after treatment with respect to their pretreatment status. However, decrease in post treatment CR-1 values in residual disease group
was non-significant (Fig 2F) (Table 2).
CR-1 was overexpressed in the tissue of OSCC patients
In addition to estimation of soluble CR-1 in serum, we also checked the tissue expression of
CR-1 by immunohistochemistry for expression of membrane bound non-soluble component
CR-1. (Fig 3). 80% of the cases were positive for the CR-1 expression at tissue level. 50% of
the cases were weakly positive for CR-1 expression, 23% and 7% cases showed moderate
and strong expression respectively. 19% cases were found to be negative for CR-1
expression.

ROC curve analysis showed that CR-1 shows a sensitivity and specificity of 74% and 78%
respectively at a cut off of 202.5pg/mL. Area under the curve was 0.80 with a statistical
significant value of p<0.0001*** [26].
Survival curve analysis
The patients were followed-up from the time of their enrollment in the study till the
completion of the study. The overall survival and disease-free survival of the patients with
CR-1 values below and above 202.5 pg/mL (cut off value) was compared. However, the data
was not significant statistically (data not shown).
4. Discussion
Although CR-1 plays a key role during embryogenesis, it ceases to express in all tissues
barring some, like developing mammary glands [27], soon after birth. However, differential
expression of CR-1 in various cancerous cells like colon carcinoma, breast cancer, gastric
cancer, glioblastoma, etc. has also been reported. Despite the evident literature contributing to
the understanding of mechanism and expression of CR-1 in various tumor tissues, expression
status of this oncofetal protein has not been explored much in OSCC, except by Yoon H.J. et
al in which author studied only the membrane bound expression of CR-1 in OSCC tumor
tissue [25]. While membrane bound CR-1 has already been shown to be associated with
OSCC, it was hypothesized that the soluble component, which is released in serum after
cleavage of GPI linkage, can be more easily estimated in serum than tissue. Moreover,
repeated estimation before and after the treatment as well as during follow up makes soluble
CR-1 a better suitable candidate as a marker than its membrane bound counterpart.
We found that serum CR-1 levels were increased by more than two folds in OSCC patients as
compared to healthy controls with a p value of <0.0001***. These results are consistent with

the previous finding for other cancers like breast and colon cancer [28]. Significant decrease
in the CR-1 levels (p<0.0006***) upon successful treatment supports the fact that OSCC
tumor population is significantly rich for the expression of soluble CR-1. This is also
supported by the fact that there was minimal or no decrease in cases of remaining residual
diseases after therapy. The exact role of CR-1 in oral oncogenesis cannot be concluded from
our study, however it is suggested that it might be playing an important role as evident by the
increased abundance of both membrane bound and soluble component of CR-1. In vitro and
in vivo studies have already been conducted in the past to show the oncogenic role of CR-1 in
cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor angiogenesis during tumorigenesis [29, 30].
Epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a crucial step for metastasis of tumor cell has also been
shown to involve CR-1 as a key player. The same is postulated to be true in cases of OSCC
also.
Correlations of serum CR-1 levels with clinical variables reveal that higher CR-1 levels are
associated with earlier disease conditions. It was observed that serum CR-1 levels were more
increased with respect to the control group in early stage (TNM classification) cohort of
patients (fig 1B). Similar pattern was observed for staging based on tumor size (T staging)
and lymph nodes involvement (N staging) (fig 1C & 1D). This suggests that soluble CR-1 is
more active and functional during early stages of carcinogenesis. It has been reported in other
cancers that CR-1 is being expressed in cancer stem cell population, termed as cancer stem
cell marker, and this population of cancer cell is involved in progression and invasion of
cancer tissue, in the early stage of cancer [19]. Our observation of association of higher
serum CR-1 levels in early disease conditions can be explained by this.
Immunohistochemistry of the OSCC tumor tissue, in our study, reveals that 80% of the cases
showed positivity for CR-1. This expression is more than that reported earlier for OSCC in
literature [25]. However, we could not find significant correlation between tissue expression

of CR-1 with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, or recurrence as also reported
by Yoon H.J. et al [25].
OSCC being the sixth most common cancer worldwide and third most common in developing
countries like India is an important health issue and the poor 5-year survival rate associated
with the disease, exacerbate the scenario. Multiple risk factors like tobacco consumption
(smoking or chewing), betel quid consumption, and alcohol consumption are highly prevalent
in the developing countries, which increased the risk of OSCC. Oral cavity, in-spite of being
easily available to access and review for disease symptoms, the disease is not detected in
early stages in most of the cases. This is because the symptoms are often too vague to be
considered as cancer or in other cases ignored due to unawareness or sometimes the
phenotypical symptoms don’t appear to be noticed in physical examination. Thus, in this
scenario a biomarker, levels of which can be measured easily from an easily accessible body
fluid like blood, urine or saliva may be a good diagnostic and/prognostic marker of disease
conditions.
Our study for evaluation of serum CR-1 levels is an effort towards identification of a
potential biomarker for OSCC. Increased serum CR-1 levels which go down upon treatment
and correlation with early disease conditions suggests that this can be a potential prognostic
or diagnostic marker for OSCC. The survival analysis was done which was found to be
insignificant and this may be explained by the small size of study population. As our study is
a pilot study and proof of concept in nature with limited number of patients, further studies in
larger patient cohorts with different stages are required to strengthen our observation
regarding the expression pattern of the soluble CR-1 protein in OSCC. However, the study
has been conducted and reported in accordance with the REMARK (REporting
recommendations for tumor MARKer) criteria [31].

Moreover, the role of CR-1 in oncogenesis of OSCC also need to be explored for future
prospective. This will not only help to establish a biomarker for the disease but can also help
to understand the role of CR-1 in the disease progression and can help to find a therapeutic
measure by targeting the CR-1 protein.
