Abstract
Objective: The aim of this study is to identify the most appropriate threshold for
Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) diagnosis and the impact of potential
changes in diagnostic rules on prevalence levels in the community.
Methods: Trained psychologists evaluated 3,562 adolescents from the 2004 Pelotas Birth
Cohort with the Development and Well-Being Behavior Assessment (DAWBA). The
clinical threshold was assessed in three stages: symptomatic, syndromic and clinical
operationalization. The symptomatic threshold identified the response category in each
DAWBA item which separates normative misbehavior from a clinical indicator. The
syndromic threshold identified the number of irritable mood and outbursts needed to
capture children with high symptom levels. Clinical operationalization compared the
impact of AND/OR rules for combining irritable mood and outbursts on impairment and
levels of psychopathology.
Results: At the symptomatic threshold, most irritable mood items were normative in their
lowest response categories and clinically significant in their highest response categories.
For outbursts some indicated a symptom even when present at only a mild level, while
others did not indicate symptoms at any level. At the syndromic level, a combination of 2
out of 7 irritable mood and 3 out of 8 outburst indicators accurately captured a cluster of
individuals with high level of symptoms. Analysis combining irritable mood and outbursts
delineated non-overlapping aspects of DMDD, providing support for the OR rule in clinical
operationalization. The best DMDD criteria resulted in a prevalence of 4%.
Conclusions: Results provide information for initiatives aiming to provide data-driven and
clinically-oriented operationalized criteria for DMDD.

Introduction
Temper outbursts and irritable mood are common manifestations of typical
development. When outbursts and irritable mood are intense, frequent, last for significant
periods, occur in several contexts, and are associated with behaviors not seen in typically
developing children, they often require clinical attention 1–3. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation
Disorder (DMDD) is a new diagnosis designed to capture pathological manifestations of
irritable mood and temper outbursts 4. Given the newness of DMDD, data-driven approaches
based on epidemiological evidence are needed to evaluate appropriate thresholds for DMDD
and consider the need to refine criteria. The current report provides such data.
DMDD has its origins in the mid-2000s when Leibenluft and colleagues 5,6 defined a
syndrome called severe mood dysregulation (SMD). SMD involved severe, chronic grouchy
mood and heightened reactivity, along with symptoms of hyperarousal 6. The syndrome was
defined to distinguish children with severe irritability from those with classic bipolar disorder
(BD), in light of increasing numbers of children diagnosed with BD 7,8. The results of those
studies converged to differentiate SMD from classic bipolar disorder based on course and
familial aggregation 9–11. For DSM-5, SMD was modified to create DMDD.
Alternative thresholds for defining DMDD have been only partially considered in the
current literature. Some previous studies have focused on irritability as a dimensional trait,
which is broader than DMDD as a diagnostic entity. These studies provide an important
framework for investigating clinically-relevant thresholds for specific behaviors. Wakschlag
and collaborators 12 used item response theory analysis to disentangle normative misbehavior
from clinically significant problems by studying the 'symptomatic threshold', i.e.,
investigating which response category in each item from a questionnaire separates normative
misbehavior from a clinical indicator. They found that some behaviors are normative and

only represent problems when their frequency is high or very high, whereas others always
indicate a significant problem that requires clinical attention. This and similar research efforts
in preschoolers

13

inform attempts to evaluate varying boundaries for the definition of

DMDD. Other studies focused more specifically on varying DSM-5 criteria for DMDD in
pre-adolescents 14,15 and adolescents 14–16. They found the prevalence of temper outbursts and
negative mood are much lower than what is found in preschoolers and that applying exclusion
criteria such as frequency and hierarchical diagnostic rules affects DMDD prevalence rates
considerably

14–16

. There was no evidence that clinical markers changed between pre-

adolescents/early adolescents (9-12) to middle adolescents (13-16)

15

. Nonetheless, it is

important to continue to identify appropriate diagnostic thresholds for distinct developmental
periods, given that normative levels of irritability clearly vary across the lifespan 14–16.
Another important step towards evaluating such varying boundaries involves
quantifying the number of abnormal behaviors required to characterize a valid diagnosis i.e.,
identifying the 'syndromic threshold' for a given diagnosis. Data-driven clustering
approaches such as latent class analysis derive groups that differ in the number of clinical
indicators endorsed

17

and thus inform attempts to set syndromic thresholds. Such efforts

need to be balanced with clinical applicability in real world settings, which require practical
decisions such as how to combine clinical indicators from distinct domains (i.e., irritable
mood and outbursts). The latter can be achieved by investigating whether domains explain
overlapping or distinct aspects of DMDD latent structure and related impairment, thus
determining whether “and” or “or” rules should be used to provide a ‘clinical
operationalization’ of the diagnosis. Previous research in pre-adolescents and adolescents
suggests irritable mood and temper outbursts predict each other over time. However, while

each of them are associated with increased risk for disrupted functioning in adolescents15,
current criteria require both to be present for a diagnosis to be assigned.
The aim of this study is to evaluate alternative clinical thresholds for the DMDD
diagnosis (see Figure 1 for an overview of the analytic strategy and Methods for details). We
investigate 3,562 pre-adolescents/early adolescents aged 10-12. First, we used Confirmatory
Factor Analysis (CFA) to identify item-level thresholds differentiating normative from
clinical problems (the symptomatic threshold). This was used to dichotomize response levels
as clinically significant or not. We next used these binary clinical indicators as input to a
latent class analysis (LCA) that assigned individuals into clusters with high and low levels
of clinical indicators for each domain. This was followed by receiver operating curves (ROC)
to detect the number of clinical indicators needed to predict class membership from the LCA
and to translate the data-driven results to DSM-5 symptom counts (the syndromic threshold).
We then compare the impact of AND/OR rules on impairment and dimensional levels of
psychopathology (clinical operationalization). Finally, we investigate the impact of varying
definitions on DMDD prevalence and comorbidity profiles in a population-based sample.

Methods
Participants
Participants of this study were pre-adolescents/early adolescents aged 10-12 from the
2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort Study. All births occurring in the city of Pelotas, from January 1st
to December 31st, 2004 were enrolled and followed over time. Pelotas is in southern Brazil
and has a population of 328,000. For a full description of the methods, see

4231 live births in the city in 2004 whose mothers lived in the urban area and agreed to
participate in the longitudinal study were considered eligible. Follow-up home visits were
performed when the subjects had reached the ages of 3.0 months (SD=0.1), 11.9 months
(SD=0.2), 23.9 months (SD=0.4), and 49.5 months (SD=1.7). When the subjects were, on
average, 6.8 years old (SD=0.3) and 11.0 years old (SD=0.4), additional follow-up visits were
conducted at a research clinic run by the Postgraduate Program of Epidemiology (Faculty of
Medicine, Federal University of Pelotas, Brazil). Of the 4,231 subjects in the original birth
cohort, 3,562 (84.1%) were included in our analysis, which used all available data from the
10-12 years of age assessment. The sample comprises 2,353 participants aged 10, 1,206 aged
11 and 4 aged 12. The prevalence of DMDD in this sample using current criteria associated
with clinical ratings was 2.5% (95% CI=2.0–3.0) 19. The study was approved by the Research
Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Pelotas and by the Research Committee of the
University of São Paulo School of Medicine. Written informed consent was obtained from
all subjects.

Instruments and Diagnostic Assessment
The parent-version of the DMDD section from the Development and Well-Being
Assessment (DAWBA) questionnaire

20

was administered by certified psychologists. This

questionnaire uses open and closed ended questions to identify the occurrence of clinical
indicators in children and adolescents aged 5-17, based on the DSM criteria. The closed
ended questions start with two skip questions about the frequency of temper outbursts and
irritable mood. Parents who answered that temper outbursts and/or irritable mood occurred
at least once a week were probed to answer specific questions that characterize all DSM-5
criteria for DMDD.

A total of 593 parents of participants answered the DMDD section on irritable mood,
representing the top 17% of irritable mood frequency. This section includes 9 items
characterizing the threshold for experiencing anger, intensity of anger if compared to peers
of the same age, duration of anger during the day, whether irritable mood is perceived by
others, setting in which anger occurs (at home, at school, with peers) and number of anger
weeks throughout the year. A total of 425 parents answered the DMDD section on outbursts,
representing the top 12% of frequency of outbursts. This section includes 15 items describing
behavior during outbursts (slamming doors, shouting, swearing, saying mean things to
others, saying negative things about self, physical aggression to others, deliberate self-harm,
breaking things), setting in which outbursts occurred (at home, at school, with peers) and
triggers (recognizable and easily triggered). We do not use the item "outbursts free-gap in
the last year” in our analysis (DSM requires that there is not a period higher than 3 or more
consecutive months without irritable mood and temper outbursts). The rationale for
excluding this item is that it is unclear whether we would expect this item to be monotonically
related to the overall latent construct given short periods of irritability with large gaps could
also inform episodes of irritability (a marker of severity and bipolar disorder).
Lastly, 686 mothers or caregivers that completed either the outburst or irritable mood
sections were asked to also complete 4 items about impairment (functioning in daily
activities, friendship, learning, and leisure activities). After the impairment questions,
mothers or caregivers answered the open-ended questions that allow qualitative description
of the symptoms, frequency, and other characteristics of the disorder. All questions and
response categories from the DMDD section are depicted in Supplemental Table S7.
The DAWBA was administered to mothers or caregivers by trained psychologists.
The forty-hour training included lectures, role playing, and supervised clinical interviews

with pediatric and mental health outpatients at the Federal University of Pelotas. The clinical
evaluation of the total sample was performed by a psychologist, and a second independent
psychologist evaluated 10% of the study sample. Both were trained in how to apply the
DAWBA, in a standardized manner, by the child psychiatrist who had translated and
validated the questionnaire for use in Brazil 21. The inter-rater agreement was 91.2% for the
presence of any psychiatric disorder, 75.9% for any anxiety disorder, 73.5% for any
depressive disorder, 72.7% for ADHD, 72.9% for conduct disorder, 85.6% for any autism
spectrum disorder, 59.5% for any eating disorder, and 52.4% for any tic disorder. Details of
the questionnaire can be found online and in other studies 22.
The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to measure dimensional
psychopathology. The SDQ is a 25-item behavioral screening questionnaire with five
domains, each of which contain five items (emotional, conduct, hyperkinetic, peer
relationships, prosocial behaviors and impact scores). The overall SDQ total scores had a
Cronbach's alpha of 0.82, which is considered high. Internal consistency for the SDQ
subscales were low to moderate ranging from 0.48 (peer relationships) to 0.78 (hyperkinetic).
Despite low reliability, we maintained results from subscales in the supplemental material
for their descriptive nature.

Statistical Analysis
Symptomatic threshold
The fourteen items on outbursts, eight items on irritable mood and four items on
impairment were included in three CFAs testing unidimensional models for each construct
(n= 593, 425 and 685 respectively). CFA models estimate item level factor loadings (λ) and
response category thresholds. Factor loadings represent the strength of the relationship

between the latent trait and the item, i.e., they indicate how well each item discriminates
different severity levels of a given construct. Category thresholds indicate the expected value
of the latent factor at which there is a 50% probability of endorsing a given category or higher
i.e., the category threshold indicates the severity level at which the transition from one
response category to the next is likely to happen (e.g., from ‘No’ to ‘A little’ or higher, or
from ‘A little’ to ‘A lot’).
To distinguish normative misbehavior from behavior that would meet a diagnostic
criterion, we used category thresholds from the CFA. CFAs were performed only in subjects
with a frequency of irritable mood and outbursts greater than once a week. In this sample, a
value of 0.5 represents a half standard deviation above the mean of the distribution of subjects
with a frequency of irritable mood and outbursts greater than once a week. Therefore, we
interpreted values below 0.5 as typical development (normative) and values at or above 0.5
as ‘clinical indicators’ (a proxy for symptoms or problem indicators). The latter represents
approximately the top 5% most symptomatic pre-adolescents/early adolescents in the
population, which is a threshold used in other diagnostic investigations 12. For details about
the CFA, see Supplemental Material.

Syndromic threshold
Before data analysis, each questionnaire item was dichotomized at the value of the
category threshold defined in the symptomatic threshold analysis described above in subjects
with at least one clinical indicator. Dichotomized items were chosen to enter the LCA
analysis because our intention was not to characterize varying levels of irritability in the
community, but to identify groups that differ in their number of clinical indicators. Three
Latent Class Analyses (LCA) were used to create empirically derived groups with different

levels of clinical indicators for irritable mood, outbursts and impairment. Next, we used three
Receiving Operating Curves to predict the most accurate number of clinical indicators for
detecting participants with high levels of symptoms (as defined by latent class analysis) with
regard to irritable mood, outburst and impairment. ROC analysis was used as a way to
translate results from the syndromic thresholds of the LCA to the reality of clinical practice,
which uses symptom counts. Thus, the ROC identifies a simple rule to allow the
identification of patients that are likely to be members of the cluster that exhibit a high level
of clinical indicators. The optimal cut-off was estimated using the Younden’s J Statistic,
which maximizes both sensitivity and specificity 23.

Clinical operationalization
Four analytical strategies were used to determine the most appropriate rule for clinical
operationalization: the ‘OR’ rule vs. the ‘AND’ rule. First, we compared the fit of CFA
models (n=398), putting the selected dichotomized clinical indicators into a unidimensional
model of irritability and a correlated model of irritability with two domains (irritable mood
and outbursts). Second, we tested whether meeting criteria for the irritable mood group and/or
for the outbursts group have distinct or overlapping associations with the impaired
functioning group using a multiple logistic regression. Third, we used left censored
regressions to compare skewed SDQ dimensional scores between subjects meeting criteria
only for irritable mood, only outbursts, either, or both and compared with a group of
participants with other DSM disorders except for DMDD and typically developing
comparisons. Fourth, for both OR and AND groups, we used a matching procedure to
compare levels of SDQ scores between a group that differed in DMDD status (yes vs. no
DMDD) but were otherwise fully matched for comorbidities.

Epidemiological impact
Finally, using the relative frequency, we investigated the impact of these AND/OR
rules and combinations for impairment requirements on the prevalence rates of DMDD in
the community and on the comorbidity profile.

All analysis were performed in R version 3.6.1 24, including applications
implemented in the packages lavaan 0.6-5 25, poLCA 1.4.1 26, pROC 1.15.3 27, CensReg
0.5-26 28 and MatchIt 3.0.2 29. The R markdown codes for the symptomatic, syndromic and
clinical operationalization thresholds of current analysis can be found in the Supplemental
Material.

Results
Symptomatic threshold
All eight items of irritable mood were found to be normative in their lowest thresholds
and clinical indicators (proxy for symptoms) in the highest thresholds, except “irritable mood
that happens at home”, which was found to be normative in all response categories. For the
six items that describe intensity, the response option “A little” indicated normative behavior,
while the response option “A lot” or “A great deal” indicated a symptom. For the duration
item, irritable mood lasting less than an hour indicated normative behavior, whereas
irritability lasting a few hours or most of the day indicated a symptom. For the frequency
item, irritable mood occurring less than 3 times a week indicated normative behavior,
whereas irritable mood occurring every day indicated a symptom (Supplemental Table S2).

For outbursts, threshold varied substantially across items. For some items, their
occurrence even at mild levels indicated a symptom, while other items did not indicate a
symptom at any level. Outbursts that include self-harm, breaking things or saying negative
things about self, or those that occurred in the classroom are indicative of a symptom if they
occur at any level (i.e., “A little” or “A lot”). Outbursts that occurred with peers, include
physical aggression, or are easily triggered indicate a symptom when they occurred “A lot”,
but were normative when they occurred “A little”. Outbursts that occurred at home and
included the pre-adolescents/early adolescents saying mean things, slamming doors,
shouting, or swearing did not indicate a symptom irrespective of the level endorsed. Also,
whether the triggers were recognizable or not was not relevant to symptom designation.
Regarding frequency, only outbursts that occurred daily indicated a symptom (Supplemental
Table S3).
For impairment, “impact on family life” is normative when “A little” and indicate a
symptom when “A medium amount” or “A lot”. Impairment that occurs in the other settings
(friendship, learning or leisure) indicate a symptom at any level (Supplemental Table S4).
See Figure 2.

Syndromic threshold
The prevalence of each clinical indicator is presented in Table 1. The three LCA
analyses (irritable mood, outbursts and impairment) indicated that the two-class solution was
the best for each of the three domains (Supplemental Table S5). This indicates that, in each
of the three domains, the population is divided into two groups characterized by high vs. low

symptoms (Supplemental Figure S1). We next performed three Receiver Operating Curve
analyses (irritable mood, outburst, impairment) to determine the best number of clinical
indicators (i.e., those items identified by the CFA) to use to predict membership in the high
vs. low symptom classes identified by the LCA. Younden’s J demonstrates that subjects in
the high symptom irritable mood and outburst classes are most accurately characterized by 2
out of 7 irritable mood symptoms and 3 out of 8 outburst symptoms. As for impairment, the
subjects with high level of symptoms in LCA are most accurately characterized by significant
impairment in at least two settings (Table 2 and Supplemental Figure S2).

Clinical operationalization
First, a model with two correlated domains (irritable mood and outbursts) provided a
better fit than a unidimensional model encompassing both domains (

diff=7.3,

df=1,

p=0.007; Supplemental Table S6). Second, both irritable mood and outbursts were associated
with clinical impairment, even after adjusting for each other in a multiple model (irritable
mood crude OR=41.71, adjusted OR=18.2, p<0.001; outbursts crude OR=76.1, adjusted
OR=23.63, p<0.001). Third, comparisons between irritable only, outbursts only and
combined groups with typically developing comparisons and with a group of patients with
other DSM disorders (except for DMDD) showed all three DMDD groups had higher scores
on all SDQ scales than typically developing comparisons and higher total SDQ total scores
than subjects with other DSM diagnosis (Supplemental Figure S3; Supplemental Table S8).
Fourth, left-censored regressions comparing groups matched for comorbidity (any anxiety,

any mood, any hyperkinetic and any disruptive behavior disorder) showed that, using either
the OR or the AND rule, the DMDD group showed higher total, emotional, conduct,
hyperactivity, peer relationship and impact scores than did the non-DMDD group with
matched comorbidities (Supplemental Figure S4; Supplemental Figure S5).

Epidemiological impact
When using an “OR” rule, the optimal criteria from the ROC analysis (2 of 7 irritable
mood symptoms, 3 of 8 outburst symptoms, impairment in at least two settings) resulted in
a prevalence of 3.0%: 1.12% have only irritable mood, 0.64% only outbursts and 1.23% have
both irritable mood and outbursts (Table 3). Both the "OR rule” and the "AND rule” resulted
in higher levels of psychiatric comorbidities compared to the current DMDD clinical criteria
(Supplemental Table S9).

Discussion
This study provides important information to guide a revision of the diagnostic
criteria for DMDD. Using CFA, we found that seven of the eight irritable mood items were
normative when endorsed in the low response categories and clinical indicators in the high
response categories. The one exception was “irritable mood that happens at home”, which
was always normative. For outbursts, the threshold for a clinical indicator varied substantially
across items. For some items, such as outbursts with self-harm, their presence indicated a
problem even at only mild levels. Others, such as shouting, were not clinical indicators even
when present at the highest threshold. ROC analyses indicated that a combination of 2 of 7
irritable mood symptoms, 3 of 8 outburst symptoms and significant impairment in at least

two settings would best predict membership in the “high” vs. “low” LCA-based symptom
classes. The four clinical operationalization analysis converge to demonstrate that the two
domains differ from a latent perspective; they are independently associated with impairment;
and OR-rule groups show comparable or even higher levels of impairment then other DSM
disorders. Matched analysis showed that results cannot be attributed to comorbidity. The
most accurate solution resulted in a prevalence of 3% in the fully automated operationalized
criteria (1.12% only irritable mood, 0.64% only outbursts and 1.23% combined).
Our findings are consistent with the limited literature examining irritability
dimensionally in the population. Each set of findings suggest that normative outbursts differ
from clinical indicators in frequency, duration, quality, context, and triggering events

30–33

.

Wakschlag et al. 12 found that outbursts characterized by high frequency, “long duration”, or
“aggressive components”, or those that occurred “with nonparental adults” or “out of the
blue” were clinical indicators. Wiggins and collaborators 13 also used an empirical approach
to identify irritable behaviors indicative of problems in preschoolers. They examined 22
temper loss behaviors from the criteria for oppositional defiant disorder, DMDD and other
depressive disorders in the DSM-5 and found two informative items. Similar to our work, the
item “easily frustrated” indicated a symptom only when present nearly every day, but the
item “break/destroy” indicated a symptom even when at lower frequencies. Nevertheless,
those thresholds might vary substantially in distinct age ranges and cultures, which highlights
the need for developmentally sensitive studies.
Clinical operationalization analysis suggests that an OR rule is most appropriate to
capture cases in need of treatment. This algorithm identified pre-adolescents/early
adolescents with either irritable mood or outbursts who manifested associated impairment,
elevated symptoms, and functional impairment. This resulted in a prevalence rate of 3%,

which is higher than the prevalence rate of 2.5% by the current diagnostic criteria. Of course,
it is not possible to identify the “true” prevalence of DMDD in the population with one study;
rather the current analyses inform nosologists’ attempts to weigh the strengths and
weaknesses of various diagnostic thresholds.
Our study has important strengths. First, we relied on a large representative
population sample and implemented assessment methods that could mimic clinical
assessment in the real world, as far as possible in an epidemiological investigation. Second,
we applied Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Latent Class Analysis and Receiver Operating
Curves Analysis, applying a similar framework used in other disorders

34,35

to a new

syndrome that lacks empirical investigations to guide operationalization. However, this work
has also some important limitations. First, our analysis is focused on internal validators.
Further studies investigating course, family history, treatment response, and other external
validators are needed to demonstrate the validity of the operationalized syndrome. Since
associations between symptoms and irritability-related impairment were investigated using
the same DAWBA DMDD section, the size of the associations is likely to be overestimated.
However, the value of these odds ratios may be helpful in understanding whether the two
aspects of irritability capture distinct or overlapping aspects of irritability-related
impairment. Second, our subjects were all 10-12 years old, and our data might not be
generalized to other developmental stages. Third, because of the skip rule questions, the CFA
parameters were estimated for subjects with irritable mood or outbursts that occurred at least
once a week. Analysis were modeled to consider these characteristics, but this might have
biased the parameter estimates for some items. Also, our approach assumes irritable mood,
outbursts and impairment are distinct domains, which is still an empirical question to be
further tested. Fourth, our analysis is restricted to parent reports, and no information was

acquired from pre-adolescents/early adolescents themselves. Lastly, our approach is
restricted to a single sample and it is unclear whether those results can be replicated in other
samples.
Advancing understanding about DMDD diagnostic criteria is a major concern in
children and adolescent psychiatric practice. Our findings are a first step towards defining
parameters to alert the clinician when to be (and when not to be) concerned with irritable
mood and outbursts as a way to inform the presence of DMDD diagnosis. Future research
that examines these patterns with measures specifically designed to differentiate normative
versus non-normative patterns and that include developmentally sensitive items might be an
important step forward to advance the field of DMDD, specifically. Prospective longitudinal
investigation that applies this framework beginning at earlier ages can elucidate the origins
of pathologic irritability and inform developmentally-based prevention.
