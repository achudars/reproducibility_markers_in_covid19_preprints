Abstract
In our increasingly interconnected world, it is crucial to understand
the risk of an outbreak originating in one country or region and spreading to the rest of the world. Digital disease surveillance tools such
as ProMED and HealthMap have the potential to serve as important
early warning systems as well as complement the field surveillance during an ongoing outbreak. Here we present a flexible statistical model
that uses data produced from digital surveillance tools (ProMED and
HealthMap) to forecast short term incidence trends in a spatially explicit manner. The model was applied to data collected by ProMED
and HealthMap during the 2013-2016 West African Ebola epidemic.
The model was able to predict each instance of international spread 1
to 4 weeks in advance. Our study highlights the potential and limitations of using publicly available digital surveillance data for assessing
outbreak dynamics in real-time.

Increasing globalization of commerce, finance, production, and services
has fostered rapid movement of people, animals, plants, and food [1]. With
the transportation of people and goods comes the widespread dispersion of
pathogens that cause infectious diseases and the vectors that may spread
them [2]. Outbreaks that begin in the most remote parts of the world can
now spread swiftly to urban centers and to countries far away with dangerous,
global consequences [3]. For instance, population mobility across borders
played a critical role in the spread of Ebola virus in West Africa during the
2013-2016 Ebola epidemic [4]. A more recent example is the 2016 yellow
Fever outbreak in Angola [5]. Infected travellers from Angola reached China,
representing the first ever reported cases of yellow fever in Asia [6].
Early detection and monitoring of infectious disease outbreaks through
passive or active collection of surveillance data can help public health officials initiate interventions such as removing contaminated food sources,
isolating affected individuals or launching vaccination campaigns. However,
any data collection method involves trade-offs between speed, accuracy and
costs. Data collected through traditional surveillance, for example via public
health infrastructure, are generally reliable but are resource intensive and are
therefore typically available for upstream analysis with an (understandable)
delay [7].
In the past three decades, the internet has grown at a staggering pace,
with approximately half of the world’s population accessing internet in 2017
[8]. The rapid growth of the internet has fostered a corresponding increase

in tools for internet based disease detection and monitoring that lie at the
other end of the spectrum. Digital disease surveillance consists of monitoring online information sources to collate relevant information about diseases.
The sources of information can be formal such as advisories posted by a
ministry of health, or informal such as news media items, blogs or tweets.
Digital surveillance makes data collection less expensive and time consuming
but the acquired data often contain more noise than those collected through
traditional public health surveillance. While traditional surveillance systems
report on select pathogens and depend on a well-functioning public health
infrastructure, digital surveillance in contrast typically monitor a wide range
of pathogens using little to no additional infrastructure. Thus, digital surveillance tools can play a significant role in the rapid recognition of public health
emergencies [9, 10].
The Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED, www.promedmail.org)
was one of the first entrants in the field of digital disease surveillance. ProMED
was created in 1994 as a surveillance network to provide early warning of
emerging and re-emerging infections [11]. ProMED collates information from
various sources that include media reports, official reports, local observers,
and a network of clinicians throughout the world. The reports generated
through bottom-up surveillance are reviewed by a team of subject matter
experts before being posted to the ProMED network. ProMED now provides free email based reports on outbreaks to over 70,000 subscribers in at
least 185 countries.
HealthMap (www.healthmap.org) is another widely used tool for disease
outbreak monitoring. In addition to ProMED alerts, HealthMap utilises
online news aggregators, eyewitness reports and other formal and informal
sources of information and allows for visualisation of alerts on a map [12].
The surveillance data collected by HealthMap has been incorporated into the
Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources (EIOS) surveillance system, developed by WHO. Both ProMED and HealthMap are used by key public health
bodies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and
the World Health Organisation (WHO).
Some other examples of digital disease detection tools include MediSys
(http://medisys.newsbrief.eu/), H5N1 Google Earth mashup (www.nature.com/avianflu/googleearth), and Emerging Infections Network (http://ein.idsociety.org). These
tools provide a unique opportunity to rapidly detect new outbreaks and follow their evolution in near real-time.
Collating timely data, while critical, is only the first step in the disease

surveillance process. Compiling the data, conducting analyses, and generating reports that are easily understood and actionable are equally important.
For instance, one of the ProMED outbreak analysts reported in March 2014
on the likely spread of Zika to the Americas [13], well before the epidemic
surfaced in South America in February 2015. However, lacking an easy to
use and openly accessible tool to quantify and visualize the reported risk
of disease spread, this report did not have any significant impact on public health resource allocation and decision making. While there has been a
growing interest in using various internet data streams for epidemiological
investigations [14, 15] and in using data from digital surveillance tools [16],
there is as yet a dearth of a framework that can automatically combine such
data with other streams of information, analyse them in a statistically robust
manner, and produce actionable reports, particularly in real time during an
outbreak where such analyses would be most useful.
In this study, we propose a new statistical framework to estimate and
visualize risks posed by outbreak events using digital surveillance data. Our
approach relies on a relatively simple statistical framework that integrates
multiple data streams to predict the future incidence trajectory, and quantifies spatial heterogeneity in the risk of disease spread. In this paper, we
present the model implemented in this framework and as a case study, we
report the analysis of ProMED and HealthMap data for the 2013-16 West
African Ebola epidemic. To assess the robustness of the digital surveillance
data, we also applied the framework to the data collated by WHO and made
available at the end of the epidemic. We present a comparison of the near
real-time ProMED/HealthMap data with the retrospective WHO data and
the results of the spatio-temporal analysis carried out on these three data
sources.
Our analysis based solely on epidemic data available through ProMED/HealthMap
provides a realistic appraisal of their strengths and weaknesses, especially if
used in near real-time forecasting.

Results
Incidence time series were computed from ProMED, HealthMap and WHO
data (see Methods) for the three mainly affected countries, Guinea, Liberia
and Sierra Leone, and are shown in Fig 1. We pre-processed the data from
ProMED and HealthMap to remove inconsistencies and to fill gaps (see Meth4

ods for details). The raw and processed data from ProMED and HealthMap
for all countries included in the feed are available in the Github repository
for this article. There were substantial differences between the incidence
time series derived from the three data sources, particularly at the peak of
the epidemic. There may be multiple reasons underpinning such discrepancy, including potential variability in digital surveillance reporting during
the course of the epidemic. It is also worth highlighting that the WHO data
used here are an extensively cleaned version of the data collected during the
epidemic [17,18], published more than a year after the epidemic was declared
to be over. Moreover, while ProMED and HealthMap did not record probable cases for this epidemic, the WHO data contained confirmed, probable and
suspected cases. However, despite these discrepancies, the weekly incidence
derived from ProMED and HealthMap was moderately to highly correlated
with that reported by WHO later (Pearson’s correlation coefficients aggregated across the three countries 0.44 and 0.74 respectively, p value < 0.001,
also see Fig 2 for weekly trends).

To broadly assess the extent to which such discrepancies in incidence
would impact the quantification of transmissibility throughout the epidemic,
we estimated the time-varying transmissibility, measured by the reproduction
number Rt (the average number of secondary cases at time t per infected
individual [19]), using the incidence from each of the three data sources
(Fig 1). Rt was estimated independently for each country using the R package
EpiEstim [20] over a sliding time window of 4 weeks. There were substantial
differences in the estimates of Rt according to the incidence data source used
(Fig 1B). The correlation between the median Rt estimates on sliding 4-week
windows from ProMED or HealthMap data with the estimates from WHO
data varied from weak (0.30, between reproduction number from WHO and
ProMED in Guinea) to very strong (0.72, between reproduction number from
WHO and ProMED in Sierra Leone, Fig 3).

Since HealthMap uses ProMED alerts in addition to other online data
sources, ProMED represents the more conservative data source between the
two. Therefore we present the results based on ProMED data in the main
text, unless otherwise specified. The analysis based on HealthMap and WHO
data are presented in the Supplementary Information (SI Sections 3 and 4).

Short term forecasts
To forecast incidence at time t in location j (Ijt ), we fitted a spatially explicit
branching process model to the daily incidence in all locations up to t − 1,
using an extension of the renewal equation as the likelihood [19]:
Ijt ∼ P oisson

n
X

pi→j Rit

t
X

!!
Iit−s ωs

s=1

i=1

where the matrix pi→j characterises the spatial spread between locations
i and j based on a gravity model [21], Rit (the reproduction number) reflects
transmissibility in location i at time t, and ω is the typical infectiousness
profile of a case over time after infection (see Methods for details).
The ability of the model to robustly predict future outbreak trajectory
was limited and depended on the data source (Fig 2) as well as on the time
window used for inference (calibration window) and the forecast horizon.
Results using a 2-week calibration window and a 4-week forecast horizon
using ProMED data are presented in the main text (see Figs 6 and 7 for
other forecast horizons and calibration windows). Overall, 48.7% of weekly
observed incidence across all three countries were included in the 95% forecast
interval (49.3% and 57.5% for HealthMap and WHO respectively, SI Table 1).
Typically, model forecasts were 0.5 times lower or higher than the observed
incidence (95% CrI 0.0 - 32.0) based on the median relative mean absolute
error (Fig 3D), see Methods for details). We found no evidence of systematic
bias in any week of the forecast horizon (median bias 0.12, Fig 3A).
Typically, individual forecasts were within 17.0% (95% CrI 0 - 80%) of
the median forecast (based on the median and 95% CrI for relative sharpness,
Fig 3B, see Methods for details).
As expected, the robustness of forecasts (both accuracy and precision)
decreased over the forecast horizon (Fig 3C). In the first week of the forecast
window, 58.0% of observed values (across the three countries) were within the
95% forecasts interval, reducing to 49.4%, 42.3% and 45.0% in the second,
third and fourth weeks of the forecast horizon.
The model performance varied depending on the country and the phase
of the epidemic, defined as “growing”, “declining”, and “stable” depending
on Rt estimates (see Methods). In general, the model performance was best
in the stable phase with 66.7% of the observations contained in the 95% forecasts interval (versus 40.2% and 30.8% in the declining and growing phases

respectively, SI Table 1). However the forecast uncertainty was largest in
the stable phase and smallest in the growing phase (Fig 3B). Importantly, in
the growing phase the model tended to over-predict while under-predicting
in the declining phase (Fig 3A).
Overall, the model performed moderately better using WHO data compared to ProMED and HealthMap data (Fig 33) and with shorter calibration
windows (Fig 32).

Risk of spatial spread
Although our model was not always able to robustly predict the future incidence in the three mainly affected countries, we found that it allowed to
robustly predict the presence or absence of cases in all countries in Africa
up to a week in advance. For each week and each country in Africa, our
model generated an alert if the predicted incidence (using a predetermined
percentile of the forecast interval) was greater than 0. We classified an alert
for a given week as a true alert when the observed incidence was also greater
than 0, as a false alert when no cases were observed, and as a missed alert
if cases were observed but were not predicted by the model. Using different
percentiles of the forecast (e.g., the median or the 95th percentile) yielded
different rates of true, false and missed alerts, which were summarised in
a ROC curve (Fig 4A). Overall, our model achieved high sensitivity (i.e.,
true alert rate) but variable specificity (i.e., 1 - false alert rate). Maximising
the average between sensitivity and specificity led to 93.7% sensitivity and
96.0% specificity at 42.5% threshold (Fig 4A). The sensitivity of the model
remained high over longer forecast horizon while the specificity deteriorated
with more false alerts being raised 4 week ahead (Fig 47). Both the sensitivity and the specificity of the model remained high when the analysis was
restricted to all countries in Africa other than the three majorly affected
countries (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone). The average of sensitivity and
specificity was maximum at 92.5% threshold in this case with 85.7% sensitivity and 81.7% specificity (Fig 48). The model exhibited high sensitivity
(83.3%) and specificity (82.0%) in predicting presence of cases in weeks following a week with no observed cases in all countries in Africa (Fig 49) at
93% threshold (similarly chosen to maximise the average between sensitivity
and specificity). Out of the 9 one-week ahead missed alerts in this case, 3 are
in Liberia towards the end of the epidemic, after Liberia had been declared
Ebola free on two separate occasions [22, 23]. The serial interval distribution

that we have used does not account for very long intervals between infections
such as that associated with sexual transmission. Using the latest available
data on pairs of primary and secondary infections and models that allow for
more heterogeneity in the distribution of cases e.g., using Negative Binomial
distributions could potentially improve the assessment of risk of spread in
such cases [24, 25].
The choice of a threshold at which to raise an alert is subjective and
involves a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. In general, using a
high threshold to raise an alert leads to high sensitivity with a reasonably
high specificity (Fig 50). The cut-off for raising an alert can be informed by
the relative costs of missed and false alerts potentially using a higher cut-off
when the observed incidence is low. It is also worth noting that where our
model failed to raise an alert in a week, either a true or a false alert had been
raised in the recent weeks in all but one instance, indicating a potential risk
of spread of the epidemic to that country.
These results suggest that the model is able to capture and even anticipate
the spatial spread of the epidemic. Importantly, as the model is fitted to
data from any of the three data sources accumulating over the course of the
epidemic, it is able to predict the presence of cases relatively early in the
epidemic (Fig 51) when such inputs would be particularly useful.
Together with providing operational outputs such as the predicted shortterm incidence in currently affected countries or the risk of spread to neighbouring countries, our method also provides near real-time estimates of parameters underlying the transmission model. First, the reproduction number
Rt for each affected country is estimated over the time-window of inference,
here over the most recent two weeks (Fig 2), second row). We found that
these near real-time estimates of Rt were in good agreement with retrospective estimates obtained using the entire incidence time-series (Fig 2, bottom
row, correlation coefficients varying between 0.58 and 0.90, Fig 5).
The risk of spatial spread in our model relies on estimating movement
patterns of infectious cases. Our method also provides estimates of the probability of a case staying within a country throughout their infectious period,
and the extent to which distance between two locations affects the flow of
infectious cases between them. The real-time estimates of these parameters
over the course of the epidemic (Fig 34), suggest that while the relative flow
of cases between locations did not vary substantially over time, the probability of travel across national borders may have decreased after the initial
phase of the epidemic.

Finally, we quantify the relative risk of importation of a case into a country from any other currently affected country. The risk of importation is
proportional to the population flow into a country from all other countries
estimated using a mobility model (here, gravity model) weighted by the infectivity at each country (which depends on the number of cases and time at
which they were infected, see Methods). Our estimates of the countries with
higher risk of acting as source of importations are largely consistent with the
reported source of cases (Fig 5). In 4 out of the 5 reported cases of international spread of the epidemic in West Africa, the model correctly attributed
the highest relative risk of acting as a source of importation (relative risk
> 0.9 for importation into Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone and 0.49 in case
of Mali) to the actual source identified through retrospective epidemiological
and genomic investigations [26].

Discussion
In the context of increasing potential for movement of diseases between various regions of the world due to increased global connectivity, innovative
strategies for epidemic monitoring are urgently needed. In this study, we
propose a statistical framework that relies on digital surveillance data from
ProMED or HealthMap to 1) predict the short-term epidemic trajectory
in currently affected countries, 2) quantify the short-term risk of spread to
other countries and 3) for countries at risk of importation, quantify where
the risk comes from. We apply our model to data collected during the West
African Ebola epidemic of 2013-2016, curated by the outbreak analysts at
ProMED/HealthMap, and we compare the model’s outputs to those obtained
when using the data collated by the WHO and made available at the end of
the epidemic.
In spite of the manual curation of the data carried out by outbreak analysts at ProMED and HealthMap, substantial issues remained in the quality and consistency of the data feeds. Dealing with issues such as missing
data and inconsistent records will be a key challenge in using these data for
prospective real-time analysis. Despite these challenges, we show the potential of digital surveillance tools to 1) inform early detection, 2) characterise
the spread, and 3) forecast the future trajectory of outbreaks. Particularly
in an evolving outbreak scenario, when information from traditional surveillance is limited and only available with a significant delay, digital surveillance

data can be used to complement the information gap. For instance, during
the West African Ebola epidemic, the first situation report by the WHO was
published only at the end of August 2014 [27], reporting on cases between
January and August 2014. On the other hand, the first post on ProMED on
Ebola cases in Guinea appeared in March 2014 [28]. Development of tools
that can directly be plugged into the current digital surveillance ecosystem
should therefore be a growing area of focus.
In general, we found that, after systematic processing to remove inconsistencies, data from ProMED and HealthMap were in reasonably good agreement with the data collected through traditional surveillance methods and
collated by WHO. In particular, both the incidence time-series and retrospective national estimates of transmissibility over time were well correlated
across the three data sources. This suggests that digital surveillance data
are a promising avenue for quantitative assessment of outbreak dynamics in
real-time.
We used the ProMED/HealthMap data to perform a spatio-temporal
analysis of the spread of the West African Ebola epidemic. We fitted a spatially explicit branching process model to the daily incidence data derived
from ProMED/HealthMap feeds. The estimated model parameters were used
to simulate the future outbreak trajectory over 4, 6 or 8 weeks. The model
performs relatively well at short forecast horizon, i.e. up to two weeks. At
a longer time scale, the model performance starts to deteriorate. A likely
explanation for this is that our model assumes that transmissibility remains
constant over the entire projection window. This assumption may not hold
as we project over longer horizons, for example due to interventions being
implemented. Model performance was also highly dependent on the phase of
the epidemic in which projections were made. During the growing phase, the
model tended to over-predict. This is likely due to interventions implemented
throughout the growing phase to reduce transmissibility, leading to a reduced
observed incidence compared to our model’s expectation. In the declining
phase on the other hand, our model tended to under-predict the observed
incidence. This could be due to control efforts being relaxed too early as
case numbers decline. Another contributing factor could be super-spreading,
a phenomenon observed in many epidemics including Ebola epidemics [29,30]
whereby a small number of cases generate a large number of secondary infections, implying that when case numbers are small, epidemic trajectory may
be difficult to predict and not well described by Poisson likelihood. Models
using more complex likelihoods, e.g. using Negative Binomial distributions,

should be explored in future work, but will present additional challenges as
analytical results underpinning the estimation of the reproduction number
will no longer hold [20].
Such variability in model performance throughout an epidemic could have
important implications if the model predictions are used to inform resource
allocation. Model estimates should therefore be interpreted with caution,
particularly as an outbreak is observed to be declining, and if the forecast
horizon is long.
We have shown that our model would have been able to accurately predict
in real-time the international spread of Ebola in West Africa. Importantly,
our model has very high sensitivity, predicting all instances of observed international spread 1 to 4 weeks in advance. Choosing a cut-off to maximise
sensitivity led to low model specificity. On occasions the model predicted
cases in countries, such as Côte d’Ivoire, where neither WHO nor ProMED
reported any case. However this may also be due to imperfect case reporting. Thus our method could be used with a high cut-off as a highly sensitive
surveillance system with an alert triggering further epidemiological investigations and implementation of epidemic preparedness measures.
A key feature of our model is that it provides, for each country identified
as at risk, a map of where the risk comes from. Out of 5 observed instances
of international spread of Ebola in West Africa, our model correctly identified the source of importation in 4 cases while in the remaining case, the
model highlighted the source of importation while assigning it low relative
risk. This could help translating data collected through digital surveillance
into concrete operational outputs in real-time that could assist in epidemic
management and control.
The systematic collection, storage, organization and communication of
disease surveillance data were especially challenging during the West African
Ebola epidemic as the deficiencies in transportation and communication resources, surveillance data quality and management, human resources and
management structures posed unique challenges in this context [31]. The
collection of case incidence data and rapid dissemination through digital
surveillance systems was further hampered by the limited information technology and internet service in the countries most affected. Thus, for the
West African Ebola epidemic, ProMED and HealthMap data were available
at a coarse spatial scale with the sub-national level information for cases
missing in most of the records. This limited our analysis to the spread of the
outbreak across national borders only, although in principle our model could

deal with data at any spatial scale. Both ProMED and HealthMap collect
more granular data for most outbreaks. Utilizing these data to investigate
outbreaks and regions would provide further evidence of the ability of digital surveillance data to usefully complement data collected from traditional
surveillance. Another interesting research avenue would be to explore ways
of integrating timely data from ProMED and HealthMap with delayed data
from ground surveillance to generate timely insights into the spatial spread
of an outbreak.
The framework presented in this paper was developed as a proof-ofconcept to use digital surveillance data for near real-time forecasting of
the spatio-temporal spread of an outbreak. It has been implemented as a
web-based tool called “Mapping the Risk of International Infectious Disease
Spread” (MRIIDS) (see [32] for more information). To further develop such
approaches, it is important to establish an automated pipeline from data collection to curation to analysis, which currently requires manual intervention
at each of these steps. Another factor that could enhance the usability of
our model in near real time is to improve the running time of the fitting and
forward simulation. In the current implementation, the running time varies
from approximately 0.5 CPU hours when 100 days of incidence data are being
used to approximately 335 CPU hours using 462 days of incidence data using
a 3.3 GHz Intel Xeon X5680 processor. Although the West African Ebola
epidemic was of unusual scale and duration, there is a scope for optimising
the model implementation.
Importantly, many other open data sources could be included in our
framework to improve model performance. For example, data on human
mobility could be used to further inform the parametric form and parameter values of our mobility model. We have incorporated a simple and wellcharacterised model of population movement in the current work. In addition
to utilising other possible data sources, future work could consider other models of human population movement [33]. When relevant, spatially-explicit
data on population-level immunity to the circulating pathogen (e.g. following previous epidemics and/or due to vaccination) could also be used to refine
our transmission model. Finally, the impact of the health capacity of a region
to respond to a public health emergency could also be accounted for in future
iterations of the model. Ongoing efforts to collate quantitative information
on the performance of health systems and the ability of regions or countries
to respond to an epidemic [34], [35] can potentially provide valuable data for
future work. Here using a relatively simple modelling approach we provide

We used a set of curated ProMED and HealthMap records on the human
cases of Ebola in West Africa. The dates in the feeds ranged from March
2014 to October 2016. Each dataset recorded the cumulative number of
suspected/confirmed cases and suspected/confirmed deaths by country at
various dates in this period. We derived the country specific daily and weekly
incidence time series from these data after the following data cleaning and
pre-processing:
• We first extracted the total case counts as a sum of suspected and
confirmed cases (ProMED and HealthMap data did not record probable
cases for the West African Ebola epidemic).
• Each unique record in ProMED is associated with a unique alert id. An
alert id can correspond to various reports from different sources (news,
social media etc.) which might report different case numbers. In such
cases, we assigned the median of the case numbers to the record.
• In some instances, cumulative case count was inconsistent in that it
failed to be monotonically non-decreasing. We identified consecutive
dates (tk and tk+1 ) where the cumulative case count was not increasing.
If removing either tk or tk+1 made the cumulative case count increasing,

Figure 1: Comparison of national daily incidence trends and R estimates
from ProMED, HealthMap and WHO data for Guinea, Liberia and Sierra
Leone. (A) Daily incidence derived from ProMED (blue), HealthMap (green)
and WHO data (orange). Daily incidence that were not directly available
from ProMED and HealthMap data and which were therefore imputed (see
Methods) are shown in lighter shade of blue and green respectively. WHO
data were aggregated to country level. The y-axis differs for each plot. (B)
The median time-varying reproduction number Rt estimated using the WHO
data (orange), ProMED (blue) and HealthMap (green) data. The shaded
14
regions depicts the 95% credible intervals
(95% CrI) for the Rt estimates.
The reproduction number was estimated on sliding windows of 28 days with
a Gamma prior with mean 1 and variance 0.25, using the R package EpiEstim
[20]. Estimates shown at time t are for the 28-day window finishing on day
t.

Figure 2: Observed and predicted incidence, and reproduction number estimates from ProMED data. The top panel shows the weekly incidence derived
from ProMED data and the 4 weeks incidence forecast on log scale. The solid
dots represent the observed weekly incidence where the light blue dots show
weeks for which all data points were obtained using interpolation. The projections are made over 4 week windows, based on the reproduction number
estimated in the previous 2 weeks. The middle figure in each panel shows the
reproduction number used to make forecasts over each 4 week forecast horizon. The bottom figure shows the effective reproduction number estimated
retrospectively using the full dataset up to the length of one calibration window before the end. In each case, the solid black line is the median estimate
and the shaded region represents the 95% Credible Interval. The red horizontal dashed line indicates the Rt = 1 threshold. Results are shown for the
three mainly affected countries although the analysis was done jointly using
data for all countries in Africa.

Figure 3: Model performance metrics overall and stratified by week of projection and epidemic phase. The performance metrics are (A) the percentage of
weeks for which the 95% forecast interval contained the observed incidence,
(B) relative mean absolute error, (C) bias, and (D) sharpness. In forecasting
ahead, we assumed transmissibility to be constant over the forecast horizon.
If the 97.5th percentile of the R estimate used for forecasting was less than
1, we defined the epidemic to be in the declining phase during this period.
Similarly, if the 2.5th percentile of R was greater than 1, we defined the epidemic to be in a growing phase. The phase was set to stable where the 95%
Credible Interval of the R estimates contained 1. See Methods for definitions
of each metric.

False Alert Rate

Figure 4: Predicted weekly presence of cases in each country. The left panel
shows the True and False alert rates using different thresholds for classification for alerts raised 1 (violet), 2 (light violet), 3 (dark pink) and 4 (green)
weeks ahead. The black curve depicts the overall True and False alert rates.
On each curve, the dot shows the True and False Alert rates at 42.5% threshold. For a given threshold (xth percentile of the forecast interval), we defined
a True alert for a week where the xth percentile of the forecast interval and
the observed incidence for a country were both greater than 0; false alert
for a week where the threshold for a country was greater than 0 but the
observed incidence for that country was 0; and missed alert for a week where
the threshold for a country was 0 but the observed incidence for that country
was greater than 0. True alert rate is the ratio of correctly classified true
alerts to the total number of true and missed alerts (i.e., (true alerts)/(true
alerts + missed alerts)). False alert rate is similarly the ratio of false alerts
to the total number of false alerts and weeks of no alert (where the observed
and the threshold incidence are both 0). The right panel shows the True
(green), False (orange) and Missed (red) 1 week ahead alerts using the 42.5th
percentile of the forecast interval as threshold. The figure only shows countries on the African continent for which either the 42.5th percentile of the
predicted incidence or the observed incidence was greater than 0 at least
once. The first alert in each country is shown using larger squares. Alerts in
a country in a week where there were no observed cases in the previous week
17 weeks for which all observed points
are shown using triangles. In each case,
were imputed are shown in lighter shades. Country codes, shown on the yaxis, are as follows: CIV - Côte d’Ivoire, GHA - Ghana, GIN - Guinea, LBR
- Liberia, MLI - Mali, NGA - Nigeria, SEN - Senegal, SLE - Sierra Leone,
BFA - Burkina Faso. The alerts are based on forecasts using ProMED data,
a 2-week calibration window and a 4 week forecast horizon.

Figure 5: Relative risk of importation of the epidemic. For each country
with non-zero incidence, the figure shows the relative importation risk (see
Methods). Since we forecasted every 7 th day, the risk of importation was
estimated using forecasts closest to and before the date of the first case in
that country reported in the data used. The date on which risk was estimated
for each country is shown in the figure. Blue indicates low relative risk while
deeper shades of red represent higher relative risk of acting as a source of
importation. White is used to denote no risk. The estimates presented here
use ProMED data with a 2 week calibration window. The country for which
risk is estimated is shown in gray. The black circle represents the actual
source of importation as retrospectively identified through epidemiological
and genomic investigations. For each country, the figure shows only the risk of
importation from other countries and does not show the risk of transmission
within the country.

we adopted this option. If however removing both or none of them
resulted in a increasing series, we removed both tk and tk+1 . These rules
were applied iteratively until the cumulative case count was consistent.
• If an inconsistent point was at the end of the the cumulative case series,
applying the above rules led to the removal of a large number of points.
Hence, to remove outliers at the end, we used Chebyshev inequality
with sample mean [36]. Given a set of observations X1 , X2 . . . Xn , the
formulation of Chebyshev inequality by Saw et al. gives the probability
that the observation Xn+1 is within given sample standard deviations
of the sample mean. We defined Xn+1 to be an outlier if the probability
of observing this point given observations X1 , X2 . . . Xn is less than 0.5.
Fixing this probability allowed us to determine k such that P r(µ−kσ ≤
X {n + 1} ≤ µ + kσ) ≥ 0.5, where µ and σ are the sample mean
and sample standard deviation respectively. We deleted an observation
Xn+1 as an outlier if it did lie in this interval.
• Finally, cumulative incidence on days with no records was filled in using
log-linear interpolation.
An example of the pre-processing of ProMED feed is presented in the
supplementary text (SI Fig 1).

Data collated by WHO
We used the West African Ebola incidence data collated by the WHO during
the epidemic which was made available approximately an year after the end
of the epidemic [37]. This data set is referred to as “WHO data” in the
interest of brevity. The cleaned version of the WHO data consisted of cases
reported between December 2013 and October 2015 in the three most affected
countries - Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The location of residence of
cases was geo-coded to the second administrative level. We aggregated the
WHO data to national level to match the spatial resolution of ProMED and
HealthMap that were only available at the country level.
Since the data collected by ProMED and HealthMap are manually curated by outbreak analysts, we have used the word “curate” in referring to
their data collection process. Similarly, we refer to the data “collated” by
WHO as WHO coordinated the international response to the outbreak and

in this role, they collated the information from Ministries of Health, situation
reports from NGOs, and local and international medical teams.

Demographic Data
We used LandScanTM 2015 dataset grid [38] for population estimates and
centroids for all countries on African mainland.

Statistical Model
Our model relies on a well-established statistical framework that assumes the
daily incidence, It , can be approximated with a Poisson process following
the renewal equation [19]:
!
t
X
It−s ωs .
It ∼ P ois Rt
s=1

Here Rt is the reproduction number at time t (the average number of
secondary cases per infected individual) and ω is the distribution of the serial
interval (the time between onset of symptoms in a case and their infector).
We extend this model to incorporate the spatial spread of the outbreak
between n different locations. The number of incident cases at a location j
at time t is given by the equation

the probability of a case moving from location i to location j while they are
infectious. Rit is affected by a number of factors e.g., the intrinsic transmissibility of a pathogen or the health care capacity at location i (which could
influence for example the capacity to isolate cases). The model could be
easily extended to explicitly incorporate the dependence of the reproduction
number on such factors.
The probability of moving between locations is derived from the relative
flow of populations between locations. This latter quantity can be estimated
using a population flow model; here we used a gravity model [39], [21]. Under a gravity model, the flow of individuals from area i to area j, φi→j , is

Nj and inversely proportional to the distance between them di,j raised to a
power γ:

φi→j = γ .
di,j
The exponent γ, which modulates the effect of distance on the flow of
populations, was estimated. A large value of γ indicates that the distances
travelled by populations tend to be short.
The relative risk of spread at a location j from a location i is thus proportional to the population flow into location j from location i.

Here, we have assumed a single pstay for all countries on African mainland. For estimating the time-varying reproduction number for each country,
we split the duration of the total outbreak into intervals of equal width. We
assume that transmissibility in each location stays constant within each time
window and thus, within a time window, we estimated a single reproduction
number for each location. We varied the length of the time window to obtain
different models, with short time windows increasing the number of parameters in the model. To reduce the number of parameters in the model, we
divided the 55 countries on African continent into 5 groups and forced each
country in a group to have the same reproduction number in each time window. The first three groups correspond of the three mainly affected countries
- Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. The countries that shared a border with
these three countries were grouped together. These were Mali, Côte d’Ivoire,
Guinea-Bissau and Gambia. The rest of the countries were assigned to the
fifth group. A comparison of the performance of different models is presented
in the Supplementary Material (Fig 32).

We assumed a Gamma distributed serial interval with mean 14.2 days
and standard deviation 9.6 days [18]. For the reproduction number, we used
a Gamma prior with mean 3.3 and variance 1.5. This was informed by a
review of estimates of the reproduction number for Ebola Zaire in outbreaks
preceding the West African Ebola outbreak which reported estimates ranging
from 1.4 to 4.7 [40]. The mean prior 3.3 was chosen as the midpoint of this
interval, and the variance 1.5, was chosen so the 95% prior probability interval
contains the extremes of this interval.
For the gravity model parameters pstay and γ, we chose uninformative uniform priors. Since pstay is a probability, the prior was a uniform distribution
on the interval [0, 1]. γ was allowed to vary between 1 and 2 in the results
presented in the main text. We performed a sensitivity analysis where γ has
a uniform prior between 1 and 10. The results of this analysis are presented
in the SI (SI Section 8).
Model fitting was done in a Bayesian framework using a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) as implemented in the software Stan [41] and its R
interface rstan [42]. We ran 2 MCMC chains with 3000 iterations and burn-in
of 1000 iterations. Convergence of MCMC chains was confirmed using visual
inspections of the diagnostics (Potential Scale Reduction Factor [43] and
Geweke Diagnostics [44]) reported by R package ggmcmc [45]. An example
report produced by ggmcmc is included in the Supplementary Material.
For each model (i.e., for each choice of the time window), we made forward projections every 7th day, over a 2 week, 4 week and 6 week horizon.
To forecast incidence from day t onwards, we fitted the model to the daily
incidence series up to day t − 1. We then sampled 1000 parameter sets (reproduction numbers for each location in each time window and parameters
of the gravity model) from the joint posterior distribution, and for each parameter set, simulated one future epidemic trajectory according to equation
(1), assuming that future Rt is equal to the last estimated Rt value in each
location.

Model Validation
Given the retrospective nature of our analysis, we validated the incidence
projected using our model against observed incidence. In addition to the
accuracy of the forecasted incidence, the uncertainty associated with the
forecasts (e.g., measured by the width of the prediction interval) is an im23

portant indicator of model performance. A narrow prediction interval that
contains the observed values is preferable over wide prediction intervals. To
assess the performance of the model along both these dimensions, we used
four different metrics drawn from the literature.
In the remainder of this paper, we use the following notation. For a
location j, let Ijt be the observed incidence at time t and let Iˆjt be the set of
predictions of the model at time t. That is, Iˆjt = {Iˆjt,1 , Iˆjt,2 , . . . Iˆjt,N } is the set
of N draws from the Poisson distribution with mean Λtj (Equation 1) (here
N = 1000).

Relative mean absolute error
The relative mean absolute error (rmae) is a widely used measure of model
accuracy [46]. The relative mean absolute error for the forecasts at a location
j at time t is defined as:
PN
t
ˆt,s
s=1 |Ij − Ij |
t
t ˆt
.
rmaej (Ij , Ij ) =
N ∗ (Ijt + 1)
That is the mean absolute error at time t is averaged across all simulated
incidence trajectories and normalised by the observed incidence. We add 1
to the observed value to prevent division by 0. A rmae value of k means that
the average error is k times the observed value.

Sharpness
Sharpness is a measure of the spread (or uncertainty) of the forecasts. Adapting the definition proposed by [47], we used the relative mean deviation about
the median to evaluate sharpness. The sharpness stj of forecasts at at time t
at location j is


t,s
t
ˆ
ˆ
|Ij − median(Ij )|

 .
stj (Iˆjt ) = mean 
t
ˆ
median Ij + 1
We add 1 to Iˆjt to prevent division by 0. A sharpness score of k indicates
that the average deviation of the predicted incidence trajectories is k times
their median. Low values of sharpness therefore suggest that the predicted
trajectories are clustered around the median.

Bias
The bias of forecasts is a measure of the tendency of a model to systematically
under- or over-predict [47]. The bias of a set of predictions Iˆjt at time t at
location j is defined as

observed values exactly, the bias is 0.

Epidemic Phase
We defined the epidemic to be in a “growing” phase at time t if the 2.5th
percentile of the distribution of the reproduction number at this time was
greater than 1. Similarly, the epidemic was defined to be in “declining” phase
if the 97.5th percentile of the distribution of the reproduction number was
below 1. In all other cases, the epidemic was defined to be in a “stable”
phase.

Relative risk of importation
The total infectivity Λtj at a location j at time t is the sum of infectivity at
all locations weighted by the relative flow of cases into j from each location
i (Eq 2). We define the risk of importation of case from i into j as the
proportion of infectivity at j due to infectivity at i. That is,
import
rj←i
(t) =

where Λtj is as in Eq 2, and λti = Rit

Overview
In this supplement, we present the details of the pre-processing of ProMED
and HealthMap feeds (Section 1), the model results using ProMED, HealthMap
and WHO data and the impact of the datasources and model parameters on
the performance of the model. We varied the length of the time window
used for model fitting (see Methods for details). SI Sections 2, SI Section 3
and SI Section 4 present the forecasts using ProMED, HealthMap and WHO
data respectively using different calibration windows (2, 4 and 6 weeks) and
forecast horizons (4, 6 and 8 weeks). The model performance was moderately better with shorter calibration windows (Fig 32) and with WHO data
(Fig 33). We explored the impact of alternate priors for the gravity model parameter on the results from the model. The results of this sensitivity analysis
are presented in Section 8. We present additional analysis on the predicting
the spatial spread of the epidemic in Section 9.

1.1

Processing ProMED and HealthMap data
Data cleaning

The data from ProMED and HealthMap was pre-processed to remove inconsistencies and address missing data (see Methods). The data on cumulative
number of confirmed and suspected Ebola cases in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra
Leone, Senegal, Mali, Nigeria and Ghana were extracted from ProMED and
HealthMap feeds. The pre-processing workflow is illustrated using data for
Sierra Leone from ProMED.

Fig SI 1: Illustration of workflow for Processing ProMED feed. Raw ProMED feed
consisted of suspected and confirmed cases and suspected and confirmed deaths.
The top left figure (a) shows the suspected (teal) and confirmed (red) cases in
Sierra Leone in the raw feed. We used the suspected and confirmed cases to derive
cumulative incidence data (b). If there were more than one alert on a day, these
were then removed by assigning the median of the cases reported to this day. (c).
If there were outliers in the data, we removed them in the next step (d). We then
made the cumulative case count monotonically increasing (e) by removing inconsistent records. Finally, missing data were imputed using log-linear interpolation
(f). Imputed points are show in light blue. See Methods for details.

We processed the data from ProMED and HealthMap and derived daily and
weekly incidence. The weekly incidence series derived from the three data
sources were highly correlated (Fig 2).

Correlation between R estimates

The correlation between estimates of time-varying reproduction number estimated using ProMED, HealthMap and WHO data depended on the time
window used for estimation and the country (Fig 3). Restricting the analysis
was robust to using reproduction number estimates with lower uncertainty
(coefficient of variation less than 0.25, Fig 4) Similarly, for each data source,

the retrospective estimates of reproduction number in the Bayesian framework using the full incidence curve were in reasonably good agreement with
the real-time estimates. The strength of the correlation varied depending on
the country and the length of the calibration window (Fig 5).

Median(R) WHO

Fig SI 4: Correlation between time-varying reproduction number estimated from
ProMED, HealthMap and WHO data. Only estimates with a coefficient of variation less than 0.25 were included in this analysis. The reproduction numbers were
estimated using R package EpiEstim over a 4 week sliding window. Median estimates from WHO data are on the x-axis and the median estimates using ProMED
(blue) and HealthMap (green) data are on the y-axis. All correlation coefficients
were statistically significant.

Fig SI 6: Observed and predicted incidence, and reproduction number estimates
from ProMED data. The top panel shows the weekly incidence derived from
ProMED data and the 6 weeks incidence forecast on log scale. The solid dots
represent the observed weekly incidence where the light blue dots show weeks for
which all data points were obtained using interpolation. The projections are made
over 6 week windows, based on the reproduction number estimated in the previous
2 weeks. The middle figure in each panel shows the reproduction number used to
make forecasts over each 6 week forecast horizon. The bottom figure shows the effective reproduction number estimated retrospectively using the full dataset up to
the length of one calibration window before the end. In each case, the solid black
line is the median estimate and the shaded region represents the 95% Credible
Interval. The red horizontal dashed line indicates the Rt = 1 threshold. Results
are shown for the three mainly affected countries although the analysis was done
jointly using data for all countries in Africa.

Table 1: Percentage of weeks with observed incidence in 95% forecast interval.
In forecasting ahead, we assumed transmissibility to be constant over the forecast
horizon. If the 97.5th percentile of the R estimate used for forecasting was less
than 1, we defined the epidemic to be in the declining phase during this period.
Similarly, if the 2.5th percentile of R was greater than 1, we defined the epidemic
to be in a growing phase. The phase was set to stable where the 95% Credible
Interval of the R estimates contained 1.

Fig SI 7: Observed and predicted incidence, and reproduction number estimates
from ProMED data. The top panel shows the weekly incidence derived from
ProMED data and the 8 weeks incidence forecast on log scale. The solid dots
represent the observed weekly incidence where the light blue dots show weeks for
which all data points were obtained using interpolation. The projections are made
over 8 week windows, based on the reproduction number estimated in the previous
2 weeks. The middle figure in each panel shows the reproduction number used to
make forecasts over each 8 week forecast horizon. The bottom figure shows the effective reproduction number estimated retrospectively using the full dataset up to
the length of one calibration window before the end. In each case, the solid black

Fig SI 8: Observed and predicted incidence, and reproduction number estimates
from ProMED data. The top panel shows the weekly incidence derived from
ProMED data and the 4 weeks incidence forecast on log scale. The solid dots
represent the observed weekly incidence where the light blue dots show weeks for
which all data points were obtained using interpolation. The projections are made
over 4 week windows, based on the reproduction number estimated in the previous
4 weeks. The middle figure in each panel shows the reproduction number used to
make forecasts over each 4 week forecast horizon. The bottom figure shows the effective reproduction number estimated retrospectively using the full dataset up to
the length of one calibration window before the end. In each case, the solid black
line is the median estimate and the shaded region represents the 95% Credible
Interval. The red horizontal dashed line indicates the Rt = 1 threshold. Results
are shown for the three mainly affected countries although the analysis was done
jointly using data for all countries in Africa.

Fig SI 16: Observed and predicted incidence, and reproduction number estimates
from HealthMap data. The top panel shows the weekly incidence derived from
HealthMap data and the 8 weeks incidence forecast on log scale. The solid dots
represent the observed weekly incidence where the light green dots show weeks for
which all data points were obtained using interpolation. The projections are made
over 8 week windows, based on the reproduction number estimated in the previous
2 weeks. The middle figure in each panel shows the reproduction number used
to make forecasts over each 8 week forecast horizon. The bottom figure shows the
effective reproduction number estimated retrospectively using the full dataset up to
the length of one calibration window before the end. In each case, the solid black
line is the median estimate and the shaded region represents the 95% Credible
Interval. The red horizontal dashed line indicates the Rt = 1 threshold. Results
are shown for the three mainly affected countries although the analysis was done
jointly using data for all countries in Africa.

Fig SI 23: Observed and predicted incidence, and reproduction number estimates
from WHO data. The top panel shows the weekly incidence derived from WHO
data and the 4 weeks incidence forecast on log scale. The solid dots represent the
observed weekly incidence. The projections are made over 4 week windows, based
on the reproduction number estimated in the previous 2 weeks. The middle figure
in each panel shows the reproduction number used to make forecasts over each 4
week forecast horizon. The bottom figure shows the effective reproduction number
estimated retrospectively using the full dataset up to the length of one calibration
window before the end. In each case, the solid black line is the median estimate
and the shaded region represents the 95% Credible Interval. The red horizontal
dashed line indicates the Rt = 1 threshold. Results are shown for the three mainly
affected countries although the analysis was done jointly using data for all countries
in Africa.

from WHO data. The top panel shows the weekly incidence derived from WHO
data and the 6 weeks incidence forecast on log scale. The solid dots represent the
observed weekly incidence. The projections are made over 6 week windows, based
on the reproduction number estimated in the previous 6 weeks. The middle figure
in each panel shows the reproduction number used to make forecasts over each 6
week forecast horizon. The bottom figure shows the effective reproduction number
estimated retrospectively using the full dataset up to the length of one calibration
window before the end. In each case, the solid black line is the median estimate
and the shaded region represents the 95% Credible Interval. The red horizontal
dashed line indicates the Rt = 1 threshold. Results are shown for the three mainly
affected countries although the analysis was done jointly using data for all countries
in Africa.

Since changing the length of the calibration window modified the model complexity with shorter windows introducing more parameters in the model, we
assessed the impact of this length on the performance of the model (Fig 32).

Mobility Model Parameters

We estimated the parameters of gravity model - pstay which is the probability
of an infectious case staying within a country, and γ which measures the
extent to which distance between two locations influences the flow of people
between them (Fig 34).

Fig SI 34: Estimates of mobility model parameters during the epidemic. Population
movement was modelled using a gravity model where the flow between locations i
and j is proportional to the product of their populations and inversely population
to the distance between them raised to an exponent γ. The parameter γ thus
modulates the influence of distance on the population flow. pstay represents the
probability of an individual to stay in a given location during their infectious period.
The solid lines represents the median estimates obtained using WHO (yellow),
ProMED (blue) and HealthMap (green) data. The shaded regions represent the
95% CrI.

Sensitivity Analysis

For the results presented in the main text, we choose an uninformative uniform prior for the parameter γ with an upper bound 2. We also fitted the
model with a uniform prior for γ allowing it to vary from 1 to 10. In this section we present the results from the sensitivity analyses. Fig 34 presents the

estimates of the parameters over the course of the epidemic using the alternative priors. As the epidemic progressed, the parameter pstay assumed larger
values suggesting a decreased probability of travel over time (Figures 34, 35).
As pstay assumes large values, the estimated flow is more strongly influenced
by pstay than by γ. Furthermore, pstay is likely to depend on the spatial
scale of the model. Our analyses were carried out at the national scale; we
expect that γ will be more sensitive to pstay at a finer spatial resolution.
Overall, the flow between locations using the parameters estimated using the
two alternative priors did not vary much (Fig 36). Figures 37 to 45 present
the model forecasts using the alternative priors for γ and Figure 46 presents
a comparison of model performance metrics using the two priors. Although
the analysis was carried out for the three data sources (ProMED, HealthMap
and WHO), for brevity we present results using ProMED data only.

Risk of spatial spread

In this section, we present additional analyses carried out on predicting the
spatial spread of the epidemic. Classification of alerts raised 1, 2, 3, and
4 weeks ahead are shown in Fig 47. We also assessed the sensitivity of
the model when the analysis was restricted to countries other than Guinea,
Liberia and Sierra Leone (Fig 48). At 93% threshold, the model exhibited
high specificity (83.3%) and sensitivity (82.0%) in predicting presence of cases
in weeks following a week with no observed cases in each country (Fig 49). In
predicting presence of cases in countries with no or low incidence, or in a week
following a week in which no cases were observed, the sensitivity improved
at higher thresholds with a reasonably low false alert rate (Fig 50). Finally,
we find that the model is able to attain a high sensitivity and specificity
relatively early in the epidemic using all three data sources (Fig 51). Since
WHO data used here were only available for Guinea, Liberia and Sierra
Leone, we affixed data from ProMED for all countries other than these three
to WHO data for the purpose of classifying alerts.
For a given threshold (xth percentile of the forecast interval), we defined
a True alert for a week where the xth percentile of the forecast interval and
the observed incidence for a country were both greater than 0; false alert
for a week where the threshold for a country was greater than 0 but the
observed incidence for that country was 0; and missed alert for a week where
the threshold for a country was 0 but the observed incidence for that country
was greater than 0. True alert rate is the ratio of correctly classified true
alerts to the total number of true and missed alerts (i.e., (true alerts)/(true
alerts + missed alerts)). False alert rate is similarly the ratio of false alerts
to the total number of false alerts and weeks of no alert (where the observed
and the threshold incidence are both 0).

False Alert Rate

Fig SI 49: Predicted weekly presence of cases for each country in weeks following
a week with no observed cases. The left panel shows the True and False alert
rates using different thresholds for classification for alerts raised 1 (violet), 2 (light
violet), 3 (dark pink) and 4 (light pink) weeks ahead. The black curve depicts
the overall True and False alert rates. On each curve, the dot shows the True and
False Alert rates at 93% threshold. For a given threshold (xth percentile of the
forecast interval), we defined a True alert for a week where the xth percentile of
the forecast interval and the observed incidence for a country were both greater
than 0; false alert for a week where the threshold for a country was greater than
0 but the observed incidence for that country was 0; and missed alert for a week
where the threshold for a country was 0 but the observed incidence for that country
was greater than 0. True alert rate is the ratio of correctly classified true alerts
to the total number of true and missed alerts (i.e., (true alerts)/(true alerts +
missed alerts)). False alert rate is similarly the ratio of false alerts to the total
number of false alerts and weeks of no alert (where the observed and the threshold
incidence are both 0). The right panel shows the True (green), False (orange) and
Missed (red) 1 week ahead alerts using the 93rd percentile of the forecast interval
as threshold. The figure only shows countries on the African continent for which
either the 93rd percentile of the predicted incidence or the observed incidence was
greater than 0 at least once. The first alert in each country is shown using larger
symbols (square or triangle). Alerts in a country in a week where there were no
observed cases in the previous week are shown using hollow triangles. In each
case, weeks for which all observed points were imputed are shown in lighter shades.
Country codes, shown on the y-axis, are as follows: BFA - Burkina Faso, CIV Côte d’Ivoire, GHA - Ghana, GIN - Guinea, LBR - Liberia, MLI - Mali, NGA Nigeria, SEN - Senegal, SLE - Sierra Leone. The alerts are based on forecasts using
