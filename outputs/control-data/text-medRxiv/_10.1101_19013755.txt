Abstract

2

Identifying and correcting varus-valgus (V-V) malalignment of the tibial component is important when

3

balancing a kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Accordingly, the primary objective

4

was to determine whether the tibial forces or V-V laxities are more sensitive to, and thus more useful

5

for identifying and correcting, V-V malalignments of the tibial component that overstuff a

6

compartment. Calipered kinematically aligned TKA was performed on nine human cadaveric knees.

7

Medial and lateral tibial forces and V-V laxities were measured from 0° to 120° flexion with an

8

unmodified reference tibial component and modified tibial components that introduced ±1° and ±2° V-

9

V malalignments from the reference component to overstuff either the medial or lateral compartment.

10

Changes in the tibial forces were most sensitive to V-V malalignments at 0° flexion (medial = 118±34

11

N/deg valgus malalignment and lateral = 79±20 N/deg varus malalignment). The varus and valgus

12

laxities were most sensitive to V-V malalignments at 30° flexion (-0.6±0.1 deg/deg varus

13

malalignment) and 120° flexion (-0.4±0.2 deg/deg valgus malalignment), respectively. The maximum

14

average signal-to-noise ratios of the sensitivities to changes in tibial forces and V-V laxities were 8.4

15

deg-1 and 0.9 deg-1, respectively, based on reported measurement errors (i.e., noise) using current

16

intraoperative technologies (14 N and 0.7°). Because of the greater signal-to-noise ratios, measuring

17

tibial forces is more useful than V-V laxities for identifying and correcting V-V malalignments of the

18

tibial component that overstuff a compartment. Clinical Significance: The sensitivities of tibial forces

19

provide objective guidance to surgeons performing V-V recuts of the tibia.

Introduction
The surgical alignment goal of kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is to restore

26

the native joint lines with the ultimate functional goal of restoring knee function to native. Restoration

27

of the joint lines, in turn, closely restores the native alignments of the limb and knee and eliminates the

28

need for ligament releases1, 2. Kinematically aligning the femoral component is relatively straight

29

forward because the resection thicknesses can be measured using calipers (i.e., calipered kinematic

30

alignment3). However, kinematically aligning the tibial component is more challenging because the

31

resection plane must be correctly aligned in both the coronal and sagittal planes. The combination of

32

irregular geometry of the tibial articular surface4 and large amounts of cartilage and bone wear5 further

33

complicates the task of achieving correct alignment of the tibial resection plane.

34

In calipered kinematically aligned TKA, the varus-valgus (V-V) orientation of the tibial

35

resection is adjusted to balance medial and lateral soft tissues. The current intraoperative verification

36

check for proper V-V alignment of the tibial component is that the knee is stable in extension based on

37

a manual V-V laxity assessment by the surgeon6. However, because identifying an overly tight (i.e.,

38

overstuffed) knee by manually checking laxities is challenging7, it is important to consider more

39

accurate intraoperative technologies such as computer navigation for measuring laxities8 and sensors

40

for measuring tibial forces9, 10. The utility of these two technologies can be compared based on their

41

signal-to-noise ratios. The ‘signal’ is the sensitivity of changes in the laxities/tibial forces due to V-V

42

malalignment of the tibial component that overstuffs a compartment of the tibiofemoral joint. The

43

‘noise’ is the error in measuring the laxities/tibial forces using current intraoperative technologies.

44

Thus, the better of the two technologies for detecting V-V malalignments of the tibial component

45

would have a higher signal-to-noise ratio. Further, the sensitivities of changes in the better variable

46

would indicate to the surgeon the amount of adjustment necessary in the V-V orientation of the tibial

47

resection to realize a desired change in laxity or change in tibial force to achieve the desired soft tissue

48

balance.

49

Prior studies have indicated that changes in the tibial forces are sensitive to small V-V

50

malalignments of the tibial component in mechanically aligned TKA11. However, because there are

51

fundamental differences between the surgical alignment goals and surgical techniques to achieve the

52

surgical alignment goals between mechanically and kinematically aligned TKA12, it is important to

53

determine the sensitivity in changes in both the laxities and tibial forces to V-V malalignments of the

54

tibial component in kinematically aligned TKA. Additionally, because prior studies have shown wide

55

variability in both the tibial forces13 and laxities14 from knee to knee, it is important to determine how

56

much these sensitivities vary from knee to knee. If the sensitivities vary widely, then it might not be

57

feasible to determine the amount of correction for an individual patient based on a mean value.

58

Accordingly, there were three objectives. The first objective was to determine the sensitivities

59

of the tibial forces and V-V laxities to V-V malalignments of the tibial component that overstuff a

60

compartment. By comparing signal-to-noise ratios for V-V laxities and tibial forces based on

61

sensitivities and errors using currently available technologies15, 16, the second objective was to

62

determine whether the changes in laxities or tibial forces are more useful for identifying and correcting

63

V-V malalignments of the tibial component that overstuff a compartment. The third objective was to

64

determine whether the variability in sensitivities from knee to knee was sufficiently low so that the

65

amount of correction for an individual could be based on the mean value of the sensitivity.

66

Methods

67

Nine fresh-frozen human cadaveric knees (average age = 74 years, range = 57 to 93 years, 6

68

males) were included. With nine knees, strong relationships between V-V malalignments of the tibial

69

component and tibial forces/laxities (i.e., r2 > 0.55) could be detected with α = 0.05 and (1-β) = 0.817.

70

Each knee was free of radiographic signs of degenerative joint disease (i.e., marginal osteophytes, joint

space narrowing, chondrocalcinosis, and/or subchondral sclerosis) and evidence of previous surgery to

72

the knee.

73

After thawing overnight, each native knee specimen was dissected and aligned in a six degree-

74

of-freedom load application system18 in preparation for measuring the tibial forces and laxities using

75

previously described protocols14, 19-22. Briefly, to enable the application of muscle forces, cloth loops

76

were sutured to the tendons of insertion of the quadriceps, the biceps femoris, and the

77

semimembranosus and semitendinosus (sutured together due to shared line of action23). Subsequent to

78

a functional alignment procedure14, 19, the shafts of the femur and tibia were cemented within square

79

aluminum tubes using methyl methacrylate (COE Tray Plastic, GC America Inc., Alsip, IL) to rigidly

80

fix the position and orientation of the knee specimen relative to the load application system and enable

81

removal and reinsertion of the knee specimen during subsequent testing in the load application

82

system18. Before determining the full extension position of each knee (i.e., 0° flexion), each knee

83

specimen was subjected to a preconditioning protocol consisting of first cycling five times between ±

84

2.5 Nm in flexion–extension (F–E) and then extending under 2.5 Nm to define 0° flexion24.

85

Kinematically aligned TKA was performed using cruciate-retaining components (Persona CR,

86

Zimmer Biomet, Inc, Warsaw, IN, USA) and disposable manual instruments without ligament release

87

following a previously described technique3, 25. Briefly, the knee was exposed through a mid-sagittal

88

osteotomy of the patella26. The goal of maintaining the native the distal and posterior femoral joint

89

lines was accomplished by matching the thicknesses of the distal medial, distal lateral, posterior

90

medial, and posterior lateral femoral resections to within 0.5 mm as measured using calipers to the

91

corresponding condylar regions of the femoral component after correcting for the kerf of the saw

92

blade25.

93

Next a conservative tibial resection was performed with the V-V orientation and posterior slope

94

set visually by the surgeon to match the those of the native tibial plateau. After inserting trial

95

components, the V-V orientation of the tibial resection was adjusted until there was negligible V–V

96

laxity at 0° flexion as judged visually by the surgeon19, 25. The posterior slope of the tibial resection

97

was also adjusted via re-cuts until the anterior-posterior (A–P) offset (i.e., distance between the distal

98

medial femoral condyle and the anterior cortex of the tibia) measured with a caliper at 90° flexion

99

matched that of the knee at the time of exposure25. These checks have been shown to result in a V-V

100

orientation of the tibial component within 0.0° ± 1.8° of that of the contralateral healthy knee2 and a

101

posterior slope within -0.2° ± 2.5° of the pre-operative posterior slope1. The internal-external (I–E)

102

rotation of the tibial component was set parallel to the F–E plane of the knee, which is the plane in

103

which the tibia flexes and extends, using templates that have been shown to align the A–P axis of the

104

tibial component with a root mean squared error of 4° from the F–E plane of the knee27.

105

After the correctly sized trial components were determined and properly aligned based on the

106

previously described verification checks, the femoral component was coated with petroleum jelly and

107

cemented to the distal femur. The tibial baseplate was coated with petroleum jelly and cemented into

108

the proximal tibia after which the correctly sized tibial insert was attached. The petroleum jelly

109

allowed the components to be released from the cement mantles, which enabled accurate exchanges of

110

tibial components and the tibial force sensor described below. After the cement cured, the components

111

were removed. The patella was not resurfaced.

112

Varus–valgus malalignment of the tibial component was created by modifying both a

113

commercially available tibial baseplate (Persona CR, Zimmer Biomet, Inc.) for use while measuring

114

the laxities and the articular surface inserts of the custom tibial force sensor21 for use while measuring

115

the tibial forces (Figure 1). These modifications were performed using 3D modeling software

116

(SolidWorks 2014, Dassault Systèmes). To create malalignments that would be correctable by a V-V

117

re-cut, varus malalignments were made about the medial edge of the tibial baseplate, and valgus

118

malalignments were made about the lateral edge of the tibial baseplate. Thus, varus malalignments

119

primarily overstuffed the lateral compartment, and valgus malalignments primarily overstuffed the

120

medial compartment (Figure 1). Five tibial baseplates and five sets of articular surface inserts were 3D

Figure 1. Renderings show the design of the modified tibial baseplates used when measuring the
laxities (top row) and the design of the modified articular surface inserts used when measuring the
tibial forces (bottom row). For the tibial baseplate, the modifications consisted of rotating the
proximal features of the baseplate that secured the insert in place (solid black line) relative to the
distal surface of the baseplate that interfaced with the cement mantle (dotted black line). Because
the geometry of the distal surface was not changed, all baseplates could be implanted using the
same cement mantle in each knee. The geometry of the proximal locking features of the tibial
baseplate was also unchanged so the same standard UHMWPE (ultra-high molecular weight
polyethylene) liner could be used in all knees. For the articular surface inserts, the modifications
consisted of rotating the proximal articular surface (solid black line) relative to the distal surface
that secured the inserts to the tibial force sensor (dotted black line)21. The modified tibial baseplate
and articular surface inserts (left column) are an example of one of the four modified tibial
baseplate and articular surface inserts created for each size tibial component. In the example case
of a 2° valgus malalignment, the medial side of the tibial component is approximately 2 mm thicker
than the lateral side.

127

Tibial forces in the medial and lateral compartments were measured with each of the five sets

128

of 3D-printed articular surface inserts attached to the custom tibial force sensor21. The tibial force

129

sensor had the same exterior size and shape as the correctly sized Persona tibial baseplate and insert.

130

The tibial force sensor measured force independently in the medial and lateral compartments and over

131

the full surface area of the liner with a maximum root mean squared error of 6 N21; 39. Before testing,

132

each knee was passively flexed five times between 0° and 120° of flexion. The testing order of the five

133

sets of 3D-printed articular surface inserts was randomized. After inserting a randomly selected set of

134

3D-printed articular surface inserts, the patellar osteotomy was closed with two transverse screws. To

135

stabilize the TKA knee during flexion, constant forces of 26 N, 80 N, and 15 N were applied to the

136

tendons of insertion of the semimembranosus/semitendinosus, quadriceps, and biceps femoris,

137

respectively. These forces were proportional to the muscle cross-sectional areas28 and smaller than

138

forces used to stabilize the TKA in other studies29-36. The tibial forces in the medial and lateral

139

compartments were measured at 30° increments as the TKA was flexed passively from 0° to 120° and

140

back to 0°. After a test was completed for a set of 3D-printed articular surface inserts, the patellar

141

osteotomy was opened, a different set of 3D-printed articular surface inserts was inserted, the patellar

142

osteotomy was closed, and the test was repeated.

143

Next the varus and valgus laxities were measured with each of the five 3D-printed tibial

144

baseplates using a six degree-of-freedom load application system14, 18, 22. With the correctly sized

145

components implanted, each knee was subjected to a preconditioning protocol consisting of first

146

passively flexing and extending the knee five times from 0° to 120° flexion. Next, the knee was moved

147

to a flexion angle randomly selected from 0°, 60°, and 120° and then cycled five times between the

148

prescribed load limits for in four degrees of freedom in a random order37. The prescribed load limits

149

were ± 3 Nm for I–E rotation38, ± 5 Nm for V–V rotation39, ± 45 N for A–P translation40, and ± 100 N

150

for compression-distraction translation41. The limits of each load were selected to engage the soft

151

tissues sufficiently to load them beyond the initial toe region of the tibiofemoral joint’s load–

deformation curve39, 40. The protocol was repeated for the remaining two flexion angles. After

153

completing preconditioning, the V-V laxities were measured at 30° increments from 0° to 120° in a

154

random order. The V-V laxities were computed as the difference between the V-V position of the tibia

155

under ± 5 Nm and that in the unloaded knee22.

156

Repeatability of laxities and tibial forces was determined by measuring each variable over five

157

trials in three additional knee specimens. The greatest standard deviations of the V-V laxities and tibial

158

forces were 0.1°22 and 12.9 N20, respectively.

159

Following University of California policies, this study did not require institutional review board

160

(IRB) approval because de-identified cadaveric specimens were used.

161

Statistical analysis

162

To determine the sensitivities of the tibial forces and V-V laxities to V–V malalignment of the

163

tibial component, a simple linear regression with the intercept set to zero was performed for the

164

changes in the tibial forces and V-V laxities at each flexion angle. The changes were computed as the

165

difference between the tibial force/laxity with each modified component and that with the unmodified

166

reference component. The degree of either varus or valgus malalignment of the tibial component was

167

the independent variable, and the changes in each tibial force/laxity in all nine knees were the

168

dependent variables. The regressions were performed separately for varus malalignments and valgus

169

malalignments because each is likely to affect the medial and lateral structures differently due to the

170

differences in stiffness of the soft tissue restraints36, 38, 42. The slope of each regression line determined

171

the sensitivity of each tibial force variable/laxity to each direction of V-V malalignment of the tibial

172

component at that flexion angle.

173

To compare the sensitivities of tibial forces and V-V laxities to V–V malalignments of the

174

tibial component, the signal-to-noise ratios (i.e., absolute values of the ratios of the sensitivities to

175

previously reported measurement errors of either optical motion capture systems or intraoperative

176

tibial force sensors) were computed. Measurement errors (i.e., noise levels) of 0.7° were used for the

177

laxities15. Measurement errors (i.e., noise level) of 14 N16 were used for the tibial forces. The signal-to-

178

noise ratios were computed for each sensitivity at each flexion angle.

To determine the variability of the sensitivities of the tibial forces and V-V laxities to V–V

180

malalignment of the tibial component, the 95% tolerance limits, which bound the predicted range of

181

95% of the sensitivities in the population with a 95% confidence level43, were computed for the

182

sensitivity of each variable at each flexion angle (Equation 1). With nine knee specimens included in

183

the present study, the tolerance factor (𝑘𝑘) was computed to be 3.5543. Also, a simple linear regression

184

was performed for each knee independently with the degree of either varus or valgus malalignment of

185

the tibial component as the independent variable and the changes in each tibial force/laxity in each

186

knee as the dependent variable.

Results
Sensitivities of tibial forces to V-V malalignment of the tibial component were greatest at 0°

191

flexion (Table 1, Figure 2). Valgus malalignments caused changes in the tibial forces throughout

192

flexion, but varus malalignments caused changes only at 0° flexion. Valgus malalignments primarily

193

increased the medial tibial force. Varus malalignments primarily increased the lateral tibial force at 0°

194

flexion.

Figure 2. Plots show means (points) and standard deviations (error bars) of the changes in the medial
and lateral tibial forces caused by V-V malalignment of the tibial component. Dotted lines show the
significant relationships (p < 0.05) between the changes in tibial force variables and V-V
malalignments (Table 1). The shaded grey regions show the 95% tolerance intervals for the
sensitivities.
Unlike the sensitivities of tibial forces, which were greatest at 0° flexion, the sensitivities of V-

198

V laxities to V-V malalignment were greatest in mid to deep flexion (Table 2). Valgus malalignments

199

The signal-to-noise ratios of the tibial forces were often greater than those of the V-V laxities

(Figure 3). For the tibial forces, the greatest ratios occurred at 0° flexion. These were 5.6 deg-1 of varus

malalignment for the lateral tibial force and 8.5 deg-1 of valgus malalignment for the medial tibial

207

force. In comparison, for the V-V laxities, the greatest ratios were 0.9 deg-1 of varus malalignment for

208

the varus laxity at 90° of flexion and 0.6 deg-1 of valgus malalignment for the valgus laxity at 120° of

Figure 3. Bar plots show the mean signal-to-noise ratios (i.e., ratios of the sensitivities to previously
reported measurement errors of either optical motion capture systems or intraoperative tibial force
sensors) for the medial and lateral forces, and the varus and valgus laxities from 0° to 120°.

211

The sensitivities of both tibial forces and laxities to V-V malalignment varied widely from knee

212

to knee (Tables 1 and 2). For the tibial forces, the 95% tolerance limits of the sensitivities were widest

213

at 0° flexion (medial tibial force = -1 to 238 N/deg of valgus malalignment; lateral tibial force = 8 to

214

150 N/deg of varus malalignment) (Table 1, Figure 2). For the varus laxities, the 95% tolerance limits

215

for the sensitivities were widest at 90° flexion (-1.2 to -0.1 deg/deg of varus malalignment) (Table 2).

216

For the valgus laxities, the 95% tolerance limits for the sensitivities were widest at 120° flexion (-1.1

217

to 0.2 deg/deg of valgus malalignment) (Table 2).

218

Although the sensitivities varied widely from knee to knee, the strength of the linear

219

relationships did not. The coefficients of determination (r2) for the sensitivities of tibial forces across

220

the nine knees were most consistent at 0° flexion (range medial tibial force to valgus malalignment =

221

0.80 to 1.00 and range lateral tibial force to varus malalignment = 0.83 to 1.00) (Table 3). The r2-

222

values for the sensitivities were most consistent across the nine knees for the V-V laxities at 60°

Discussion

227

There were three key findings in the present study. The first key finding was that in general the

228

tibial forces were most sensitive to overstuffing near extension, and the laxities were most sensitive in

229

mid to deep flexion. The second key finding was that tibial forces are better than laxities for

230

identifying and correcting V-V malalignments of the tibial component that overstuff a compartment

231

because the signal-to-noise ratios are greater by about an order of magnitude. The third key finding

232

was that there was wide variability in the sensitivities of both the tibial forces and the laxities to V-V

233

malalignments between knees; however, each knee demonstrated strong linear relationships between

234

changes in tibial force/laxities and V-V malalignments.

235

The first key finding that tibial forces were most sensitive to overstuffing near extension and

236

the laxities were most sensitive in mid to deep flexion is consistent with the expected changes in the

237

tension of the soft tissue restraints. Overstuffing increases the length of the soft tissue restraints in the

238

overstuffed compartment, which in turn can increase the soft tissue tension or decrease the laxity

239

depending on the initial V-V laxity. If the initial V-V laxity is minimal, thus indicating some degree of

240

pretension in the soft tissue restraints, then overstuffing will further increase the tension and thus the

241

tibial force, which was observed at 0° flexion where V-V laxity is minimal22; the V-V laxities will be

242

relatively unaffected because the soft tissue restraints are stiff. However, as the V-V laxity increases

243

with flexion22 indicating that the soft tissue restraints become more lax, the effect of overstuffing on

244

tibial forces is mitigated, but the effect on V-V laxities is amplified because overstuffing makes the

245

knee less lax in the particular compartment overstuffed.

246

Regarding the second key finding, the signal-to-noise ratio indicates how well actual changes in

247

force/laxity can be detected in the presence of measurement errors. Because all the signal-to-noise

248

ratios for the changes in the V-V laxities were less than 1 (Figure 3), surgeons would have a difficult

249

time detecting actual changes from measurement errors. However, many of the signal-to-noise ratios

250

for changes in tibial forces, especially those at 0° flexion where the tibial forces w greatest20, are much

251

greater than 1. The relatively large signal-to-noise ratios indicate that actual changes in tibial forces

252

due to V-V malalignments of the tibial component should dominate over measurement errors (Figure

253

3). Therefore, tibial forces are better than V-V laxities for identifying and correcting V-V

254

malalignments of the tibial component that overstuff a compartment because guiding re-cuts based on

255

the sensitivities in tibial forces should lead to more accurate re-cuts.

256

The second key finding that the tibial forces are more useful than laxities for identifying and

257

correcting V-V malalignments of the tibial component that overstuff a compartment is supported by

258

prior clinical and biomechanical studies. A previous clinical study showed that it is challenging for

259

surgeons to detect high tibial forces using a standard gap-balancing approach for mechanically aligned

260

TKA7, which is based on the joint laxity. Without the use of an intraoperative tibial force sensor, TKAs

261

deemed to be correctly balanced exhibited mean compartment loads as high as 352 N, which are much

262

greater than those in the native knee that have been reported as 114 N on average13. Biomechanically,

263

because the soft tissues restraints are often already loaded into their linear high stiffness regions near

264

full extension39, 40, additional deformation due to overstuffing does not change their stiffness. Thus, the

265

laxity, which is a cumulative measure of the deformations of many soft tissue restraints, would also not

266

change (Table 2). Therefore, intraoperative laxity assessments are likely better for detecting an under-

267

stuffed compartment where gaps between the components can be detected visually.

268

Regarding the third key finding, the large but variable sensitivities of tibial forces to

269

overstuffing caused by V-V malalignments of the tibial component have important clinical

270

implications for balancing a kinematically aligned TKA. The wide tolerance intervals on the

271

sensitivities are supported by both the wide variability in the mechanical properties of the primary soft

272

tissue restraints44-46 and the wide variability in the tibial forces in the native knee13. As described

273

previously, balancing of the medial and lateral soft tissues in calipered kinematically aligned TKA is

274

performed by adjusting the V-V orientation of the tibial resection after confirming that the femoral

275

component is kinematically aligned19, 25. Thus, the sensitivities determined in the present study provide

276

quantitative guidance for how large of an adjustment is necessary to achieve a desired reduction in the

277

tibial forces when an intraoperative tibial force sensor is used. However, the wide variability of these

278

sensitivities raises concern with using the mean values for all knees. An illustrative example about how

279

this variability might increase the time and complexity of the balancing procedure is presented in

280

Supplement 1.

281
282

Because there was a strong linear relationship between changes in tibial forces and V-V
malalignments in all nine knees, a simple procedure might be useful to determine a patient-specific

283

sensitivity (Figure 4) to overcome the wide patient-to-patient variability. In this procedure, the surgeon

284

would first record the initial tibial force values. For example, assume that the initial medial and lateral

285

tibial forces are 300 and 65 N, respectively, and the surgeon desires to match the mean tibial forces of

286

the native knee (114 N in the medial compartment and 63 N in the lateral compartment13) by

287

performing a varus re-cut. Next, the surgeon would insert a trial that simulates a 1° varus re-cut and

288

again record the medial and lateral tibial forces. The difference between the medial tibial force before

289

and after inserting the 1° varus re-cut trial is the sensitivity of the medial tibial force to valgus tibial

290

malalignment. By determining this patient-specific sensitivity, the re-cut also would be patient-specific

291

(Figure 4). This approach would be useful in patients with OA because it is based on the current state

292

of the joint; thus, utilizing this simple patient-specific approach would overcome one methodological

293

issue with this study described below which is that the knees did not have OA.

Figure 4. Schematic shows representative examples of how patient-specific sensitivities can be
determined using a small trial re-cut (e.g., 1° varus) and then how the correct re-cut for that patient
can be determined based on the patient-specific sensitivity. Because the target tibial forces for a
specific patient are unknown, the mean tibial forces at 0° flexion in the native knee (medial force =
114 N and lateral force = 63 N ) 13 are used as the target for this example.
294
295

Three methodological issues should be acknowledged because of their potential to affect the

296

results. One methodologic issue concerns the alignment of the tibial component in the reference

297

condition. Tibial component malalignments in this reference condition relative to the native joint line

298

might change the initial tension in the soft tissue restraints. A pair of recent studies showed that (1) the
18

299

tibial forces after KA TKA are comparable to those of the native knee20 and (2) the laxities and neutral

300

positions were largely not different from those of the native knee22. Thus, if present, then V-V

301

malalignments of the reference tibial components were likely small as described previously in the

302

Methods section2. A second methodologic issue was that this study was performed in knees without

303

OA. Thus, the sensitivities might differ in knees with end-stage OA. Additional changes to the

304

mechanical properties of the medial and lateral soft tissue restraints that likely occur in some OA

305

patients would likely increase the variability in the sensitivities. However, while the exact sensitivities

306

might change in OA knees, the conclusions drawn in the present study that tibial forces are better than

307

laxities for detecting overstuffing should still apply to OA patients. Further, using the simple patient-

308

specific approach described previously would enable the patient-specific sensitivity to be determined

309

regardless of the condition of the soft tissue restraints. The third methodological issue is that only nine

310

knee specimens were included. While this number was sufficient to detect strong relationships between

311

V-V malalignment and changes in tibial forces and laxities, this group likely does not capture all the

312

knee-to-knee variability in the population. To best account for this issue, we computed tolerance

313

intervals to represent the predicted range because tolerance intervals take into account the sample size

314

when predicting the range of the population.

315

In conclusion, measuring changes in tibial forces is more useful than measuring changes in

316

laxities for identifying and correcting V-V malalignments of the tibial component that overstuff a

317

compartment. Because of the wide variability in sensitivities between knees, a patient-specific

318

procedure is needed to adjust the tibial resection when high tibial forces are registered due to

319

overstuffing of a compartment. Using the simple patient-specific procedure proposed in this study,

320

surgeons can determine patient-specific sensitivities of tibial forces to V-V malalignments of the tibial

321

component and use these patient-specific sensitivities to determine the re-cut necessary to correct

322

overstuffing caused by V-V malalignment of the tibial component. These patient-specific re-cuts

323

should reduce the risk of improperly tensioned soft tissue restraints and unnecessary ligament releases.

Supplement 1: Illustrative example of difficulty with using mean sensitivities to
guide balancing KA TKA
To appreciate the difficulty with using the mean sensitivities to guide corrections in all knees,

489

consider an illustrative case in which the surgeon measures a medial tibial force of 300 N and a lateral

490

tibial force of 65 N in extension. Because the ideal tibial forces for a particular patient are unknown, it

491

is reasonable to strive to achieve tibial forces comparable to the average in the native knee13, which are

492

similar to those measured in calipered kinematically aligned TKA in vitro20. Using the mean tibial

493

forces of the native knee as a target (114 N in the medial compartment and 63 N in the lateral

494

compartment13), the medial force is 186 N too high, and the lateral force is 2 N too high, which

495

indicates that there is a valgus malalignment of the tibial component (Figure 2, Table 1). Thus, a varus

496

re-cut should correct the valgus malalignment and reduce the medial tibial force with minimal changes

497

to the lateral tibial force (Figure 2, Table 1). However, the appropriate size of the varus re-cut remains

498

to be determined.

499

To understand the importance of considering knee-to-knee variability in the sensitivities of the

500

tibial forces, first assume that this patient has sensitivities equal to the highest determined in the

501

present study (213 N/deg valgus malalignment, specimen 1, Table 3). If the surgeon used the average

502

sensitivity to determine the appropriate re-cut, then a varus re-cut of 1.6° would be performed (186 N /

503

(118 N/deg) = 1.6°). However, in this high-sensitivity knee, a 1.6° varus re-cut would be much too

504

large because the actual decrease in the medial force would be 336 N. Because a decrease of 336 N

505

would be greater than the measured medial force, this re-cut would likely slacken the soft tissue

506

restraints in the medial compartment, which might cause excessive laxity post-operatively. Next,

507

assume that this patient has sensitivities equal to the lowest in the present study (35 N/deg valgus

508

malalignment, specimen 7, Table 3). In this low-sensitivity knee, the 1.6° varus re-cut would be too

509

small because the actual decrease in medial tibial force would only be 56 N. In both these patients,

510

additional surgical steps would be necessary to achieve tibial forces comparable to those of the native

511

knee, which is undesirable due to increasing time and complexity of the procedure.
