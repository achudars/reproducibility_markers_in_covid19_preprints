ABSTRACT
Rational
In 2014, local wildfires ignited a fire in the Morwell open cut coal mine, in south-eastern Australia,
which burned for six weeks. Limited research was available regarding the respiratory health effects
of coal mine fire-related PM2.5 smoke exposure.
Objective
This study examined associations between self-reported respiratory outcomes in adults and mine
fire-related PM2.5 smoke exposure.
Participants
Eligible participants were adult residents of Morwell, identified using the Victorian electoral roll.
Main outcome measures
Self-reported data were collected as part of the Hazelwood Health Study Adult Survey.
Mine fire-related PM2.5 concentrations were retrospectively modelled by the Commonwealth
Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Oceans & Atmosphere Flagship. Personalised mean
24-h and peak 12-h mine fire-related PM2.5 exposures were estimated for each participant. Data
were analysed by multivariate logistic regression.
Results
There was some evidence of a dose-response relationship between respiratory outcomes and mine
fire PM2.5 concentrations. Chronic cough was associated with an Odds Ratio (OR) of 1.13 (95%
Confidence Interval 1.03 to 1.23; p-value 0.007) per 10 μg/m3 increment in mean PM2.5 and 1.07
(1.02 to 1.12; 0.004) per 100 μg/m3 increment in peak PM2.5. Current wheeze was associated with
peak PM2.5, OR=1.06 (1.02 to 1.11; 0.004) and chronic phlegm with mean PM2.5 OR=1.10 (1.00 to
1.20; 0.052). Males, participants 18-64 years and those residing in homes constructed from nonbrick/concrete materials or homes with tin/metal roofs had higher estimated ORs.

respiratory health outcomes for adult residents of Morwell, approximately 2.5 years after the mine
fire?
What is the bottom line?
There was some evidence of a dose-response relationship between respiratory outcomes and mine
fire-related PM2.5 concentrations.
Why read on?
There is limited research regarding the health effects of coal mine fire-related PM2.5 smoke exposure

symptoms associated with smoke exposure from a coal mine fire.

INTRODUCTION
Coal mine fire smoke contains multiple pollutants known to be harmful to human health, including
particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and benzene,[1, 2].
The chemical profile of pollutants released varies with geographical location, coal composition,

meteorology and combustion conditions,[3]. Of these pollutants, fine PM2.5, being particulate matter
with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 µm, has been identified as the most harmful to human
health,[4]. PM2.5 are a mixture of solid and liquid particles created either as primary particles emitted
directly into the atmosphere, or secondary particles formed in the atmosphere from pollutant gases.

While multiple studies have found associations between adverse respiratory symptoms and both
wildfire,[5-7] and non-wildfire sources of ambient PM2.5,[8, 9], limited research is available
specifically regarding the respiratory health effects of coal mine fire-related PM2.5 smoke
exposure,[10]. Mine fire PM2.5 has been associated with increased medication dispensing for
respiratory health conditions,[11] and studies have found populations living in coal mining
communities are at increased risk of respiratory health conditions, even in the absence of fire,[12].
Additionally, as coal mine fires and wildfires are thought to have broadly similar chemical
emissions,[10], it is likely the organ systems affected by both would be similar.

In February 2014, local wildfires ignited a fire in the Morwell open-cut coal mine adjacent to the
Hazelwood power station and the town of Morwell, in south-eastern Victoria, Australia (Figure 1).
The mine fire burned for approximately six weeks. Hourly mine fire-related PM2.5 concentrations
were estimated to have reached 3700 µg/m3,[13] during the initial phase of the fire. The daily
average National Environment Protection Measure (NEPM) standard of 25 µg/m3 was breached on
27 days during February and March 2014 in the Morwell township,[13]. In response to community
concerns following the fire, the Hazelwood Health Study (HHS) was established to investigate the
potential long-term health effects of the mine fire on the local population. The current analysis
draws upon the Adult Survey component of the HHS, to examine whether there was an association
between mine fire-related PM2.5 smoke exposure and self-reported respiratory health outcomes for
adult residents of Morwell, approximately 2.5 years after the mine fire.

METHODS
Study Design & Setting
We conducted a cross-sectional study of self-reported respiratory outcomes following exposure to
coal mine fire-related PM2.5. The methods have been published elsewhere,[14, 15]. In brief, the
study was conducted in the Latrobe Valley, south-eastern Victoria, Australia. The exposure zone
comprised five Statistical Area 2 (SA2) districts: Morwell, Yallourn North, Moe, Churchill and
Traralgon,[16] (Figure 1). The region was semi-rural and the mine was located on the south-western
boundary of the Morwell township. The exposure period was defined as 9 February - 31 March 2014
and the recruitment period was May 2016 - February 2017.

Participants
Participants were residents of Morwell aged 18 years or older at the time of the mine fire. Eligible
participants were identified using the Victorian Electoral Commission (VEC) roll and were invited to
take part in the Adult Survey by mail to their last known address. Non-responders were followed up
via telephone, mail and public advertisements.

Variables
Data was collected via a self-report survey, over-the-phone, online or on paper. Variables included
participants’ demographic and socioeconomic indicators (age, gender, marital status, education level
and employment status). A modified version of the European Community Respiratory Health
Survey,[17] was used to identify respiratory symptoms in the previous 12 months and respiratory
conditions since 2014.

Participants reported any paid jobs held for at least six months, which may have involved exposure
to dust, fumes, smoke, gas vapour or mist. Participants also reported employment in the Latrobe
Valley coal mines or power stations, any paid or volunteer positions with the emergency services
and, specifically, fire-fighting in the Hazelwood mine fire Controlled Area. Based upon responses,
participants were divided into three occupational exposure categories: not exposed; coal mine or
power station; exposed but not coal mine power station. Respondents who had ever smoked at least
100 cigarettes or a similar amount of tobacco, in their lifetime were defined as smokers as per the
World Health Organization (WHO) definition,[18] and categorised as current or former.

Participants also identified the year of construction of their residence, the main building material,
type of roofing and any use of air conditioning during the exposure period. A time-location diary was
completed detailing participants’ day and night residential, work and any relocation addresses
during the 51 day/night exposure period.

Mine fire-related PM2.5 concentrations were retrospectively modelled by the Australian
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Oceans & Atmosphere
Flagship, using The Air Pollution Model (TAPM v4.0.5), combined with a chemical transport model
(CTM),[19, 20]. Modelled data were used due to a paucity of air quality monitoring at the time of the
fire,[1, 3, 13]. In particular, no data were available for the first 10 days of the fire in the residential
areas of Morwell closest to the mine. The modelling process was described in detail by Emmerson et
al.,[13].

Personalised mean 24-h and peak 12-h mine fire-related PM2.5 exposure metrics were calculated for
each participant based on the addresses listed in their time-location diaries. The Morwell SA2
consisted of 36 SA1s (Figure 2) and exposure was assigned to Morwell addresses at that scale.
Exposure was assigned to Churchill, Moe, Yallourn North or Traralgon addresses at the SA2 level
(Figure 1). The temporal scale was 12 hours: 6am - 6pm defined as day time exposure and 6pm 6am defined as night exposure. For each participant, their 51-day and 51-night PM2.5 concentrations
were averaged to obtain their cumulative mean 24-h exposure metric. Their peak 12-h PM2.5
concentration metric was the maximum SA1 or SA2 area level concentration assigned to the
addresses recorded in their diary.

Statistical Methods
Associations between mine fire smoke exposure and respiratory outcomes were investigated for
mean and peak PM2.5 concentrations using multivariate logistic regression. Analyses were conducted
using weighted methods of estimation to reduce the possibility of participation bias. The final
multivariate models included exposure variables (mean or peak PM2.5 exposure) and common
confounders of the respiratory outcomes, namely: age, gender, employment, education, marriage
status, smoking, employment exposure, roof materials, building materials, pre-existing asthma and
pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Interactions between PM2.5 exposure
and both housing and roofing type were tested to rule out the impact of smoke ingress on the true
exposure of participants.

Missing data for roofing type and building materials were completed using publicly available realestate websites and satellite images. Missing observations for remaining variables ranged between

0.06-1.3% (Table S1) and were accounted for using multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE),
with 20 iterations,[21, 22].

Overall effects were measured using the odds ratio (OR) for self-reported respiratory outcomes and
95% confidence intervals (CI), associated with a 10 μg/m3 increase in mean 24-h and a 100 μg/m3
increase in peak 12-h mine fire-related PM2.5 smoke concentration. Stratification to assess effect
modification by sex (male/female) and age (18-64/65+ years) was also conducted. Statistical analysis
was conducted using Stata 15,[23].

Ethics Approval
The protocol for the Adult Survey was approved by the Monash University Human Research Ethics
Committee (Project number 6066). Participants provided informed consent.

RESULTS
Recruitment results and bias assessment are detailed elsewhere,[14, 15]. In brief, 9,013 Morwell
residents were identified by the VEC roll as eligible. Of those, 3,037 (34%) participated, as well as 59
Morwell residents who had not been listed on the roll (N=3096). An assessment of sampling bias
found an over-representation of women and older people and differences in smoking patterns. To
account for potential bias, the analysis was conducted using weighted methods of estimation (Table
1). Recruitment rates were marginally higher for SA1s closest to the mine (Figure S1).

experienced the highest concentrations, and were also the most highly populated residential areas
(Figures 1 and 2).

Potential confounding and outcome variables across tertile categories of mean 24-h PM2.5 exposure
are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. Exposure for the period 9 February - 31 March 2014 was
categorised as: Low: 0-8.6 µg/m³, Medium: >8.6-14.1 µg/m³ and High: >14.1-56.0 µg/m³. Participant
age, marital status, smoking status, housing materials and roofing materials varied across exposure
categories, which highlighted the need for controlling these variables in the multivariate analysis
(Table 1).

Multivariate analysis showed a pattern of increasing respiratory symptoms with increasing PM2.5,
however often CIs were wide and statistical significance was not achieved (Figure 4, Table S2). For
each outcome the estimated OR for a 10 μg/m3 increment in mean PM2.5, was similar to the OR for a
100 μg/m3 increment in peak PM2.5, and CIs were wider for mean concentrations. The strongest
associations were for chronic cough, with ORs of 1.13 (95%CI 1.03 to 1.23; p-value 0.007) per 10

μg/m3 of mean PM2.5 and 1.07 (1.02 to 1.12; 0.004) per 100 μg/m3 of peak PM2.5. Current wheeze
was associated with peak PM2.5, OR=1.06 (1.02 to 1.11; 0.004) and chronic phlegm was associated
with mean PM2.5, OR=1.10 (1.00 to 1.20; 0.052). Those with pre-existing asthma or COPD reported
worse respiratory symptoms than those without (Table 1), but no interaction with exposure was
identified. A comparison using MICE and complete case analysis yielded essentially the same results.

The sex stratified analyses suggested that estimated ORs were generally higher for males compared
with females (Figure 5, Tables S3-S4). The highest ORs were observed in men with asthma since 2014,
OR 1.58 (1.10 to 2.29; 0.014) for mean PM2.5 and 1.43 (1.14 to 1.78; 0.002) for peak PM2.5, with little
evidence in women. Among men, the ORs for chronic cough were estimated as 1.20 (1.05 to 1.37;
0.007) for mean PM2.5 and 1.07 (1.00-1.14; 0.050) for peak PM2.5 and current wheeze 1.10 (1.03 to
1.17; 0.004) for peak PM2.5. Amongst females, the highest ORs were for chronic cough, OR 1.06 (1.00
to 1.12; 0.051) for peak PM2.5. Age stratification showed higher estimated ORs for participants aged
18-64 years, compared with those 65 and over (Figure 6, Tables S5-S6). For those 18-64, the highest
ORs were observed for chronic cough, OR 1.17 (1.04 to 1.30; 0.008), and chronic phlegm, OR 1.14
(1.02 to 1.28; 0.023), both for mean PM2.5. For those 65 and over all CIs incorporated the value one.

A protective effect of brick/concrete housing materials was identified in the multivariate regression
models for both mean and peak PM2.5, for wheeze, cough and nocturnal and resting shortness of
breath symptoms (Table S7). Two-way interaction analyses of home building materials and PM2.5
concentrations, found associations between nocturnal and resting shortness of breath outcomes
and the interaction variable for mean PM2.5 (Table S8). Estimated ORs between PM2.5 and respiratory
symptoms were higher for participants with non-brick/concrete housing compared with
brick/concrete housing (Figure S2). For participants with metal/tin roofing materials, the
multivariate regression models estimated increased odds for both mean and peak PM2.5, for nasal

symptoms and phlegm (Table S7). No interaction was identified between roofing materials and PM2.5
concentrations.

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine self-reported respiratory symptoms
associated with smoke exposure from a coal mine fire. Our findings showed some evidence of a
dose-response relationship between mine fire-related PM2.5 smoke concentrations and self-reported
respiratory outcomes collected about 2.5 years after the fire. The strongest relationship observed
was between chronic cough and mean PM2.5 exposure. Chronic cough and current wheeze were
associated with peak exposure, and chronic phlegm with mean exposure. Males, participants aged
18-64 years and those residing in homes constructed from non-brick/concrete materials or homes
with tin/metal roofs had higher estimated ORs.

Our analysis builds on the HHS Adult Survey volume 2 report,[14], which found an association
between chronic cough and tertile categories of participants’ mean 24-h mine fire-related PM2.5. In
our analysis, building and roof material types were included as additional predictor variables, age
and gender stratification were undertaken, peak 12-h exposure was examined and exposure was
analysed as a continuous variable. It is possible these factors have improved the statistical power of
the model, facilitating the identification of additional associations between respiratory outcomes
and mine fire-related PM2.5 smoke exposure.

Direct comparisons between our study and existing peer-reviewed literature are difficult, given the
limited published research regarding coal mine fire smoke exposures. Previous research conducted
by the HHS showed an association between the dispensing of respiratory medications in the Latrobe

Valley and mine fire-related PM2.5 smoke exposure,[11] and some comparison is possible with other
studies that have investigated wildfire PM smoke exposures. Associations were found between
wildfire PM10 exposure following an American wildfire and survey-reported respiratory symptoms in
children,[24]. An Australian study found an increased risk of emergency department attendance for
asthma during a 2006/7 wildfire,[6]. Several Canadian studies have found associations between
wildfire PM2.5 and asthma-related physician visits,[25-27], hospital admissions,[25] and the
dispensing of the reliever medication salbutamol,[26-28].

Cough is a physiological mechanism to clear inhaled particles from the respiratory tract and phlegm
an indicator of mucus production, so the associations found between PM2.5 exposure and these
symptoms are plausible. The finding that wheeze was more strongly associated with peak exposure
compared to mean exposure, may be because residents more prone to respiratory conditions were
more likely to take protective action such as relocating away from the fire,[24] or increasing inhaled
medications. Mine fire-related PM2.5 concentrations peaked on day two of the fire,[13] at which
point residents may still have been residing at their Morwell residential or work address and their
peak exposure value would reflect this. If participants subsequently relocated, they would have a
reduced mean exposure score making it more difficult to identify an association.

Stronger dose response relationships were observed in males and those aged 18-65 years. Possibly
these groups were more active outdoors and/or employed during the mine fire and had less
opportunity to relocate outside the exposure zone. Additionally, there may be an element of
survivor bias,[29] in the older age group. Relocation may also explain why gender stratification found
chronic cough in females was more strongly associated with peak compared to mean exposure, as
women may have had more flexibility to relocate. The stronger OR between PM2.5 and asthma since
2014 in males may reflect a combination of the mine fire triggering the diagnoses of previously

unrecognised asthma and/or small number instability (n=18) as reflected in the wider CIs [OR 1.58
(1.10 to 2.29; 0.014)].

There is mixed evidence in the literature regarding the age group most susceptible to PM related
respiratory symptoms. Stronger associations were found in the 20-34 years group, relative to other
ages, for the dispensing of respiratory medications following the Hazelwood mine fire,[11].
Henderson et al.,[25] found stronger associations for middle aged adults relative to older adults for
respiratory physician visits following a wildfire. However, other wildfire studies found the relative
strength of associations for different age groups varied for different respiratory outcomes,[7, 30].
Gender stratification has generally found women have stronger associations than males. Following
the mine fire, we found women had a slightly stronger association than men for the dispensing of
respiratory medication,[11]. Following wildfires, an increased risk of hospital admissions for asthma
in females was reported by Delfino et al.,[7] and mixed results for different respiratory-related
emergency department visits were found by Tinling et al.,[31].

Building materials of participants’ residences were associated with respiratory outcomes. Residences
constructed from brick/concrete were protective, possibly because relative to weatherboard houses
there was reduced penetration of PM2.5. Residences with roofs constructed from tin/metal were
associated with increased ORs, possibly because in the study area houses with tin roofs were often
constructed from weatherboard and houses with tile roofs from brick. While metal roofs may have
reduced PM2.5 penetration rates relative to tiles, the weatherboard house construction would have
increased penetration.

Wildfire studies have found particulate penetration rates are higher for homes with reduced airtightness,[32, 33] and that reducing indoor PM2.5 concentrations with air-filters reduces respiratory
symptoms,[34]. There may also have been some inter-relationship with socio-economic factors.
Weatherboard houses were generally less expensive and not always well maintained and studies
have found lower socio-economic groups may be more susceptible to wildfire smoke exposure,[35,
36]. The two-way interaction found between PM2.5 and housing materials for shortness of breath
may be a combination of socio-economic factors, pre-existing health conditions and possible indoor
exposure differences. Nocturnal shortness of breath can be an indicator of asthma or heart failure
and resting shortness of breath an indicator of severe COPD, and those from lower socio-economic
groups may be more prone to illness. While our study controlled for known socio-economic and
health confounders, it is possible some residual confounding remained. These study results
contribute to health policy responses in the event of future mine fire or wildfire pollution episodes.
Study participants included both males and females and adults of all ages, and therefore the results
would have external validity in other similar communities affected by pollution episodes.

Strengths and Limitations
A major strength of our study was the ability to gather individual level health data, confounding
factors, including residence construction materials, detailed hourly mine fire-related PM2.5
concentrations and time-location dairies for each participant. Additionally, the use of individual
exposure scores, rather than community level exposure measurements may have reduced the risk of
exposure misclassification and increased the power of the study to identify associations between
health and exposure,[37]. However, some uncertainties were associated with the use of modelled
PM2.5 concentrations, such as assumptions regarding emission characteristics, coal burn depth, local
wind conditions and smoke plume dispersion,[13]. Further, details regarding housing material and

roofing type were only collected for the principal residence of each participant and the proportion of
time spent at this location would have varied between participants.

There was a 26-month lag between the end of the mine fire (March 2014) and the commencement
of recruitment (May 2016) which may have led to some recall bias. Most respiratory symptom
questions referred to the previous 12 months, which would at minimum have been 14 months after
the fire period. Therefore, influences other than the mine fire may have contributed to symptom
reporting. Alternatively, it is possible the reporting of respiratory symptoms after an extended
period post the mine fire, may be an indicator of persistent or long-term impacts of the event.
Respiratory outcomes may also have been overestimated due to comorbidity between respiratory
symptoms and stress. Traumatic stress has been associated with the activation of a number of
neurobiological systems, including inflammatory cytokines,[38], which may in turn impact on airways
reactivity,[39, 40] and therefore stress may have presented as respiratory outcomes.

CONCLUSION
This study found dose response relationships between increments in coal mine fire-related PM2.5
smoke exposure and increases in respiratory outcomes in adults, including cough, phlegm and
wheeze, about 2.5 years after the event. The strongest associations were observed for males, for
adults under 65 years and participants living in non-brick/concrete residences. These findings
contribute to the formation of public health policy responses in the event of future major pollution
episodes.
