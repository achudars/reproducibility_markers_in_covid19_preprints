Abstract
Since the first Zika virus (ZIKV) infection was confirmed in Brazil in May 2015, several hundred thousand cases have been reported across the Americas. This figure gives an incomplete
picture of the epidemic, however, given that asymptomatic infections, imperfect surveillance,
and variability in reporting rates imply that the incidence of infection was likely much higher.
The infection attack rate (IAR)—defined as the proportion of the population that was infected
over the course of the epidemic—has important implications for the longer-term epidemiology
of Zika in the region, such as the timing, location, and likelihood of future outbreaks. To estimate the IAR and the total number of people infected, we leveraged multiple types of Zika case
data from 15 countries and territories where subnational data were publicly available. Datasets
included confirmed and suspected Zika cases in pregnant women and in the total population,
Zika-associated Guillan-Barré syndrome cases, and cases of congenital Zika syndrome. We used
a hierarchical Bayesian model with empirically-informed priors that leveraged the different case
report types to simultaneously estimate national and subnational reporting rates, the fraction of
symptomatic infections, and subnational IARs. In these 15 countries and territories, estimates of
Zika IAR ranged from 0.084 (95% CrI: 0.067 − 0.096) in Peru to 0.361 (95% CrI: 0.214 − 0.514)
in Ecuador, with significant subnational variability in IAR for every country. Totaling these
infection estimates across these and 33 other countries and territories in the region, our results
suggest that 132.3 million (95% CrI: 111.3-170.2 million) people in the Americas have been infected by ZIKV since 2015. These estimates represent the most extensive attempt to date to
determine the size of the Zika epidemic in the Americas, and they offer an important baseline
for assessing the risk of future Zika epidemics in this region.

Introduction
Zika virus is a mosquito-borne pathogen that was first identified in Uganda in 1947 (Dick et al.,
1952). Smaller Zika outbreaks have occurred in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific islands since its
discovery, but there had been no confirmed cases in the Americas (excluding Easter Island,
Chile) prior to the first confirmation of a Zika case in Brazil in May, 2015 (Fauci and Morens,
2016). Subsequent to its discovery in Brazil, the epidemic spread rapidly and cases were reported
throughout the Americas over the next two years (Pan American Health Organization (PAHO),
2018). The Zika epidemic generated a large amount of concern in the public health community
and the general public, leading to a declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February, 2016 (WHO, 2016), because of
the discovery of a link between ZIKV infection in pregnant women and congenital Zika syndrome
(CZS) in newborns (Brasil et al., 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016; Rasmussen et al., 2016; Brady et al.,
2019). Following the large epidemic from 2015-2017, substantially fewer Zika cases have been
reported in 2018 and 2019 (Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), 2018).
Now that the ZIKV invasion has run its course, there are a number of unanswered questions
about what will happen next. If the remaining population at risk is large, then additional
outbreaks in the coming years are still possible. On the other hand, modeling has suggested
that if a large proportion of the population is now immune, herd immunity will likely prevent
another large epidemic for more than a decade (Ferguson et al., 2016). This scenario could lead
to a slow buildup of new susceptible individuals over time, and of particular concern, an eventual
buildup of susceptible women of childbearing age if a ZIKV vaccine is not licensed and broadly
deployed (Ferguson et al., 2016; Lessler et al., 2016; Durham et al., 2018). The number of recent
ZIKV infections could also have relevance for the epidemiology of dengue virus (DENV) in the
region (Ferguson et al., 2016). There is evidence of an interaction between ZIKV and DENV
via the human immune response to infection with either virus (Stettler et al., 2016; Dejnirattisai
et al., 2016; Bardina et al., 2017; Andrade and Harris, 2018; Rodriguez-Barraquer et al., 2019).
If a ZIKV infection provides any temporary cross-protection to DENV, then the reduction in
dengue incidence in several Latin American countries over the past few years (Borchering et al.,
2019) could be followed by a large dengue epidemic as this temporary cross-protection wanes.
The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) reported suspected and confirmed Zika
cases for every country and territory in the Americas, but these reported cases vastly underestimate the total number of ZIKV infections due to inadequate surveillance, the non-specificity
of ZIKV symptoms, and the high proportion of asymptomatic infections (Lessler et al., 2016;
O’Reilly et al., 2018). Underreporting is particularly an issue for pathogens such as ZIKV where
the majority of infections are asymptomatic or produce only mild symptoms (Duffy et al., 2009;
Mitchell et al., 2019). Estimates of ZIKV infections from blood donors in Puerto Rico through
2016 suggest that almost 470,000 people might have been infected in Puerto Rico alone (Chevalier et al., 2017). High ZIKV seroprevalence estimates from several major cities with populations
of more than one million—46% in Managua, Nicaragua (Zambrana et al., 2018), 63-68% in Salvador, Brazil (Netto et al., 2017; Moreira-Soto et al., 2018), and 64% in Recife, Brazil (de Araújo
et al., 2016)—also suggest that the 806,928 suspected and confirmed cases reported by PAHO
represent only a small fraction of the total number of ZIKV infections.
In this study, we take advantage of several features of the recent Zika epidemic that allow us
to estimate national and subnational IARs throughout the Americas. First, due to the WHO
emergency declaration, surveillance for Zika began in most countries relatively early in the

epidemic, and all countries and territories in the Americas reported case data to PAHO. Second,
in addition to reporting suspected and confirmed Zika cases in the entire population, many
countries also reported Zika cases among pregnant women, CZS or microcephaly cases, and
Guillan-Barré syndrome (GBS) cases, providing additional information about the underlying
IAR. Third, a number of countries have published subnational Zika surveillance data, which
increases the sample sizes for estimation purposes. The subnational data also allows us to
capture spatial heterogeneity in ZIKV IAR within these countries. Using a hierarchical Bayesian
model fit to multiple data types we estimated the subnational IARs and reporting rates for each
data type. Estimated IAR and reporting rates were then used to extrapolate national-level case
data from the rest of the American countries and territories to provide an estimate of the total
number of ZIKV infections across this region.

Methods
Data
The cumulative numbers of suspected and confirmed Zika cases in each country and territory
in the Americas, as well as the number of confirmed CZS cases, were reported by PAHO on a
weekly basis through the first week of 2018 (Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), 2018).
In addition, PAHO also published country reports following epidemiological week 35 in 2017
that contained additional information, including the total number of cases of microcephaly and
Guillan-Barré syndrome (GBS) associated with Zika, where available (Pan American Health
Organization (PAHO), 2017a). Because ZIKV infection attack rates could vary significantly
within a country, we restricted our primary analysis to countries and territories where we were
able to obtain Zika data at a subnational level for at least one data type. In total, we were able
to estimate subnational and national ZIKV IARs for 15 countries and territories (SI Table 1).
The data types considered were confirmed Zika cases, suspected Zika cases, microcephaly
cases associated with a ZIKV infection in the mother, Zika-associated cases of GBS, and the
proportion of blood donors with a positive ZIKV infection (Puerto Rico only). In addition, due
to the risk of CZS in newborns, many countries also reported the number of pregnant women with
either a suspected or confirmed ZIKV infection, which we treated as independent data points
from the confirmed and suspected cases in the entire population. Reporting of Zika-associated
microcephaly and GBS cases varied by country, with some reporting only cases associated with
a lab-confirmed ZIKV infection and others both confirmed and suspected cases.
Where available, we obtained Zika data at the first administrative level (e.g., province or
state) within a country or territory. Lower level data were aggregated to the first administrative
level in cases where they were available. National and subnational population estimates were
generated from WorldPop 2015 population rasters for each country or territory (WorldPop, 2019;
Sorichetta et al., 2015). The number of pregnant women in each country potentially at risk of a
ZIKV infection was estimated using 2015 pregnancies rasters from WorldPop, and the number
of births at risk for microcephaly were estimated using the WorldPop 2015 births rasters (Tatem
et al., 2014). All of the data used in our analysis, along with model code, are located in the
Github repository https://github.com/mooresea/Zika_IAR.

Model
We estimated the national and subnational Zika IAR in each country using a hierarchical
Bayesian model with the number of total infections and symptomatic infections treated as latent variables (Figure 1). Short descriptions for each of the model variables and parameters are
presented in SI Table (2). The IAR in a population of size Ni in administrative unit i is the
Ii
proportion of the population that was infected, N
, where Ii is the number of infections. The
i
number of symptomatic infections in a population, Zi , depends on the size of the infected population, Ii , and the probability that an infection is symptomatic, ρZ , resulting in Zi ∼ Bin(Ii , ρZ ).
The number of confirmed Zika cases in a population, CT,i , depends on the number of symptomatic infections and the local reporting rate, ρCT,i , resulting in CT,i ∼ Bin(Zi , ρCT,i ). The
number of suspected Zika cases was similarly dependent on a reporting rate for suspected cases,
ρST,i , and the number of symptomatic infections in the total population, ST,i ∼ Bin(Zi , ρST,i ).
Because misdiagnosis could contribute to the number of suspected cases during an epidemic, we
also considered the possibility that there were more suspected cases than symptomatic infections
by using a Poisson distribution rather than a binomial distribution to represent the reporting
process for suspected cases. The results of this analysis are reported in the Supplementary Information (SI section 4). The numbers of confirmed or suspected cases in pregnant women, CP,i
or SP,i , were represented by binomial distributions dependent on the number of symptomatic
infections in pregnant women. The infection attack rate and probability of an infection being
symptomatic in pregnant women were assumed to be the same as that in the entire population.
The probabilities that a symptomatic infection was reported as a suspected or confirmed Zika
case, ρSx and ρCx , where x represents either the entire population (T ) or pregnant women only
(P ), were assumed to differ between administrative units within a country or territory. To estimate this within-country variation in reporting rates, we assumed that the probability of a
symptomatic infection being reported in administrative unit i followed a beta distribution with
hyperparameters αYx and βYx such that ρYx,i ∼ Beta(αYx , βYx ), where Y denotes confirmed (C)
or suspected (S).

The number of reported Zika-associated GBS cases was dependent on the number of symptomatic infections, Gi ∼ Bin(Zi , ρG ), where ρG is the probability that a symptomatic infection results in a reported GBS case. The number of microcephaly cases associated with Zika
was dependent on the total number of births in the population, Bi , and the IAR, such that
Ii
Mi ∼ Bin(Bi , ρM N
), where ρM is the probability that an infection during pregnancy results in
i
a reported microcephaly case. The number of blood donors with an active ZIKV infection, Ii ,
within a population of screened blood donors, Di , was related to the IAR by the parameter, ρI ,
which corrects for the fact that blood donation is only possible when an individual is asymptomatic and adjusts for the mean duration of viremia in asymptomatic individuals (including
pre-symptomatic individuals) relative to the duration of the collection period (Chevalier et al.,
2017). As a result, the number of infections among blood donors, Di , is assumed to follow a
Poisson distribution, Ii ∼ Poisson(Di NIi ρi I ) (see SI section 2 for details).
Subnational IARs were estimated for each country and territory using available data types.
The national-level IAR was calculated
Pnfrom the total number of subnational infections divided
Ii
by the national population size, N , i=1
. For Puerto Rico, Zika IARs were estimated at the
N
municipality-level (n = 78), due to availability of data at that scale. In addition, several datasets
there were aggregated at the regional level (n = 8), due to their availability at that scale. For
these data types, the regional-level IARs were estimated from the total number of infections
within all municipalities in a given region.
Prior assumptions
The IAR reported in previous Zika outbreaks has been as high as 73% on the Micronesian island
of Yap (Duffy et al., 2009). The IARs of Aedes-transmitted viruses in larger geographical areas
tend to be lower than in smaller island environments, such as Yap, because spatial heterogeneity in the presence and abundance of Aedes limits transmission potential within a portion of
the region (Keeling, 1999). Studies from several different Zika outbreaks have estimated basic
reproduction numbers (R0 ) of 1.4 to 6.0 (Kucharski et al., 2016; Towers et al., 2016; Lourenço
et al., 2017; Shutt et al., 2017; Villela et al., 2017). Based on the theoretical relationship between
R0 and the final epidemic size (Keeling and Rohani, 2011), these R0 values would correspond
to IARs of 0.286–0.833. However, IARs are typically lower at a given R0 value in populations
with heterogeneous contact patterns (Andreasen, 2011), as is typical with transmission by Ae.
aegypti mosquitoes (Liebman et al., 2014). To lightly constrain our ZIKV IAR estimates without
precluding the possibility of values anywhere between 0 and 1, we used a Beta(1, 2) prior for the
probability of an individual being infected (i.e., the IAR). This prior distribution had a median
value of 0.292 (95% range: 0.013–0.842). We also performed an analysis with a uniform prior
for the IARs. A comparison of posterior IAR estimates with and without the Beta(1, 2) prior is
included in the Supplementary Information (SI section 4).
Estimates of the probability of a ZIKV infection being symptomatic, ρZ , have varied considerably across studies (Duffy et al., 2009; Subissi et al., 2017; Mitchell et al., 2019). One recent
study estimated the symptomatic probability for three different locations (Yap Island, French
Polynesia, and Puerto Rico), taking into account assay senstivity and specificity, as well as the
possibility of Zika-like symptoms due to other causes (Mitchell et al., 2019). Median estimates
from that study ranged from 27% in Yap to 50% in Puerto Rico. To generate a single prior
distribution for ρZ in our model, we used the model and data provided in Mitchell et al. (2019)
to recreate the posterior estimates of ρZ from their analysis, and then fitted a beta distribution

to the combined posteriors using the ‘fitdistrplus’ package in R (Delignette-Muller and Dutang,
2015). The resulting distribution was Beta(3.88, 5.34), which has a median of 0.41 and a 95%
range of 0.14–0.73, and was used as a prior for each country. The hyperparameters αYx and
βYx for the reporting probabilities ρYx , where Y = C or S and x = T or P , were specified as
Cauchy(0, 25) priors. This distribution provides a weakly informative prior with the distribution
peaked at 0 and a long right tail. We assumed non-informative priors for the probabilities that
a symptomatic infection results in a reported Guillan-Barré case or that an infected mother
will give birth to a child with reported microcephaly. These probabilities represent not just the
probability that an infection leads to a syndromic case, but also that such a case ends up being
reported through the surveillance system.
The prior distribution of the incidence correction factor for the probability of infection in
asymptomatic blood donors, ρI , was estimated using the distributions for the incubation period
and viremic period described by Chevalier et al. (2017) and fitted to a gamma distribution
using the ‘fitdistrplus’ package in R (Delignette-Muller and Dutang, 2015). This resulted in a
Gamma(15.97, 0.42) prior. Full details of the estimation of the incidence correction factor are
provided in SI section (2).
Model implementation
Each country or territory model was fitted using the ‘rstan’ version 2.18.2 package in R (Stan
Development Team, 2018). For each country or territory, four chains of 5,000 iterations each
were run with a burn-in interval of 2,500 iterations. Convergence was assessed using the GelmanRubin convergence diagnostic (Gelman et al., 2013). The full model for Peru failed to converge,
so the reporting rates of confirmed cases (ρCT ) and confirmed cases in pregnant women (ρCP )
were estimated as single parameters for all administrative units, rather than drawing ρCi from
hyperparameters αC and βC . We considered this simplification to be justifiable because all
ZIKV confirmations were handled by either the national CNS laboratory or one of two regional
laboratories, so confirmation rates likely did not vary as widely between administrative units as
the reporting rates for suspected cases. Model diagnostic results for each country and territory
are provided in SI section (3).

Model validation
Posterior predictive checks
Posterior predictive checks were performed by comparing the empirical data to simulated data
from the posterior parameter distributions. Posterior predictive data was generated at each iterpre(k)
ation, k, of the MCMC, with Yj
∼ Bin(Nj , θjk ) for data type j ∈ {CT , ST , CP , SP , M, G, I}
and its associated parameters θj . At each iteration, the observed national total, Yj , was compre(k)
pared to the predicted national total, Yj
. This test statistic was used to calculate a Bayesian
p-value pB = Pr((Yjpre , θj ) ≥ (Yj , θj )|Yj ), which indicates whether the distribution of the modelgenerated data was more extreme than the observed data (Gelman et al., 2013). We also
compared the observed national totals for each data type to the predicted model output to
determine whether the observed data (across all case types and territories) fell within the 95%
credible interval (CrI) of the corresponding posterior distributions from the model.

Holdout analysis
To determine the sensitivity of model estimates to the inclusion of different data types, we fitted
the model while holding out one data type at a time. This analysis was restricted to countries
where all data types were available at a subnational level (Guatemala and Dominican Republic)
or at most one data type was only available at the national-level (Panama). For these countries,
we also fitted the model to one data type at a time to assess the benefit of using multiple data
types in the estimation process.
Seroprevalence estimates
As an additional check, we compared modeled IAR estimates to published seroprevalence estimates from the Americas, as these quantities should be comparable. Seroprevalence estimates
from at least one location were available for five countries or territories from ten published studies (SI Table 6). The majority of these studies were conducted in a single city and not across
a larger adminstrative area, in which case we compared the seroprevalence data to the IAR
estimate from the first-level administrative unit where that city was located.

Applying the model to settings with no spatially disaggregated data
Estimates from the 15 country-specific models were used to make predictions about IARs in the
33 other countries and territories in Latin America and the Caribbean where subnational data
was not available. The January, 4 2018 Zika report from PAHO included cumulative data from
52 countries and territories in the Americas (Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), 2018).
Canada, Bermuda, and Chile reported no locally-acquired cases, and the United States reported
only a few hundred locally-acquired cases in a limited geographic area, so these countries were
excluded from the analysis. For the remaining 48 countries and territories (including the 15
modeled territories), the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases, suspected cases, and cases of
microcephaly were used to estimate the national IAR. For each of the 48 countries and territories,
a national IAR estimate was obtained by drawing from the posterior distributions of the different
reporting parameters from each of the 15 country models. This allowed us to draw from across
the full range of estimated reporting rates from these 15 countries and territories in predicting
the IARs in the remaining countries and territories. For a given country or territory model, k, the
probability of a given IAR value in country or territory j was derived from the joint probability
for each of the different data types (Cj , Sj , and/or Mj ) that were used to fit that model. The
combined probability density function for IAR in country j was then taken as the sum of the
probability density functions using the parameter estimates from all K = 15 models. These IAR
estimates were used to calculate the total number of ZIKV infections that may have occurred
during the epidemic. Initially, the infections arising in the 15 modeled territories were derived
from country- or territory-specific model estimates and only the infections from the remaining 33
countries and territories were estimated from this pooled analysis. The territory-specific model
estimates were compared to the pooled model estimates for each of the 15 modeled territories to
assess the plausibility of the pooled estimates in the non-modeled countries and territories (SI
section 5).

Results
Infection attack rate estimates
Estimated Zika infection attack rates at the national level ranged from 0.084 (95% CrI: 0.067 −
0.096) in Peru to 0.361 (95% CrI: 0.214 − 0.514) in Ecuador (Figure 2, SI Table 4). There was
considerable heterogeneity in IARs (Figure 3). In Brazil, at the subnational level, the IAR varied
from 0.016 (95% CrI: 0.01-0.025) in the State of Paraná to 0.766 (95% CrI: 0.569-0.942) in the
State of Sergipe (Figure 3). In Mexico, the IAR ranged from 0 (95% CrI: 0-0) in the Federal
District to 0.793 (95% CrI: 0.524-0.963) in the State of Yucatán (SI Figure 17). Subnational
IAR estimates for all 15 modeled countries and territories are presented in SI figures (7-21).

icas, there were a total of 132, 278, 856 (95% CrI: 111, 305, 999-170, 156, 510) ZIKV infections
across Latin America and the Caribbean. The majority of these infections, 114, 112, 765 (95%
CrI: 99, 394, 311-128, 358, 749), were from the 15 modeled countries and territories, while the
other 33 countries and territories accounted for an additional 16, 160, 273 (95% CrI: 5, 426, 67951, 709, 310) infections. There were an estimated 53, 388, 206 (95% CrI: 40, 819, 653-64, 922, 428)
ZIKV infections in Brazil and 25, 599, 729 (95% CrI: 19, 237, 945-32, 690, 560) in Mexico. Venezuela
had the largest number of ZIKV infections (6, 633, 999; 95% CrI: 350, 008.3-31, 518, 000) out of
the countries that were not explicitly modeled (SI Table 4).

Parameter estimates
The median probability of a ZIKV infection being symptomatic across all countries was 0.15
(95% CrI: 0.02-0.55), which was lower than the prior estimate of 0.41 (95% CrI: 0.14–0.73). The
estimated symptomatic probability ranged from 0.03 (95% CrI: 0.01-0.17) in Guatemala to 0.33
(95% CrI: 0.15-0.6) in Colombia (Figure 4A). This shift in the posterior estimate relative to the
prior estimate of the symptomatic rate may be the result of identifiability issues between the
symptomatic rate and the reporting rate parameters for the different data types. Misdiagnosis
of symptomatic ZIKV infections as a different disease, such as dengue fever, could also lower the
estimate of the symptomatic rate.

(A) Posterior and prior symptomatic probability estimates for each country or

ZIKV infection in a pregnant woman results in a reported case of microcephaly. (C) Posterior
estimates from each country and territory of the probability that a symptomatic infection results
in a reported Guillan-Barré syndrome (GBS) case.
Reported rates of microcephaly in every country and territory were lower than recent estimates of the risk of microcephaly based on studies of ZIKV infection during pregnancy (Figure 4B). The probability that an infection in a pregnant woman resulted in a reported case of
microcephaly ranged from a low of 0.07 per 1,000 infections (95% CrI: 0.01-0.19) in Nicaragua
to 8.7 per 1,000 infections (95% CrI: 7.13-11.39) in Brazil. The probability that a symptomatic
infection would result in a reported Guillan-Barré case varied from a low of 0.16 per 100,000
symptomatic infections (95% CrI: 0.04-0.7) in Ecuador to a high of 93.06 per 100,000 symptomatic infections (95% CrI: 63.22-115.2) in Puerto Rico (Figure 4C). The large variability
between countries in reporting rates for microcephaly and GBS cases could be due to differences in case definitions among countries, differences in surveillance, or differences in underlying
dengue immunity that may have impacted the severity of ZIKV infections due to some form of
cross-reactive response (Bardina et al., 2017; Andrade and Harris, 2018; Rodriguez-Barraquer
et al., 2019).
The probability of a symptomatic infection being reported as a suspected or confirmed Zika
case was higher for pregnant women than the general population for all countries where separate
data on pregnant women were available, with the exception of suspected cases in El Salvador
and Honduras (SI Figures 26-29). The countrywide reporting rate in pregnant women was

as low as 0.002 (95% CrI: 0-0.012) for confirmed cases in El Salvador (SI Figure 29), and as
high as 0.289 (95% CrI: 0.041-0.989) for confirmed cases in Costa Rica and 0.276 (95% CrI:
0.056-0.727) for suspected cases in Dominican Republic (SI Figure 28). As with the variability
in reporting rates for GBS and microcephaly, this variability in confirming ZIKV infections in
pregnant women indicates that there were considerable differences in surveillance and testing
efforts among countries during the epidemic.
Countrywide reporting of suspected cases in the entire population ranged from 0.012 (95%
CrI: 0.006-0.041) in Peru to 0.933 (95% CrI: 0.632-0.999) in Puerto Rico (SI Figure 26). Countrywide reporting of confirmed cases ranged from 0.0004 (95% CrI: 0.0001-0.0023) in El Salvador
to 0.504 (95% CrI: 0.341-0.54) in Puerto Rico (SI Figure 26). The variation in reporting rates
among administrative units within a country or territory was largest in Colombia for suspected
cases (70.2% of variance was between administrative units vs. 29.8% due to within-unit variance),
suspected cases in pregnant women (63.8%), and confirmed cases in pregnant women (67.7%).
The largest between-administrative unit variance in reporting rates for confirmed cases in the
total population occurred in Puerto Rico (61.4% of total variance). Several countries showed
little variability in reporting rates among administrative units, with < 1% of total variance
explained (SI Figures 30-33).

Model validation
Posterior predictive checks
Our model did not generate predicted cases that were more extreme than the numbers of observed cases—as indicated by Bayesian p-values between 0.1 and 0.9—for each observed data
type in all countries and territories except Puerto Rico. For Puerto Rico, the total number of
reported confirmed cases (pB = 0.990), suspected cases (pB = 0.999), GBS cases (pB = 0.004),
and infections in blood donors (pB = 0.020) were outside the range of model predictions, but
the number of microcephaly cases was not (pB = 0.566) (Figure 5). The underestimation
of confirmed and suspected cases—and overestimation of GBS cases and infections in blood
donors—in Puerto Rico indicates that our model was not capable of reconciling estimates based
on different data types when the subnational reporting rates for these different data types did
not vary consistently. Therefore, the municipality-level IAR estimates for Puerto Rico should be
viewed with caution. The observed number of microcephaly cases, confirmed cases in pregnant
women, and suspected Zika cases in pregnant women fell within the 95% posterior predictive
interval (PPI) of the model for every country and territory that reported these data types (Figure 5). Beyond Puerto Rico, the number of confirmed cases in Guatemala was higher than
the 95% PPI (1,032 vs. 811-963), the number of suspected cases in Honduras was higher than
the 95% PPI (32,385 vs. 29,659-30,583), and the number of suspected cases in Brazil was
lower than the 95% PPI (231,725 vs. 240,240-243,040). Comparisons of the observed data to
subnational PPIs for each country or territory are provided in the project Github repository
https://github.com/mooresea/Zika_IAR.
Holdout analysis
Modeled IAR estimates were not overly sensitive to any one data type. Removing any one
data type from the estimation process did not significantly alter the national IAR estimate for
Guatemala, with median estimates within 1.0% of the median estimate from the full model of

estimates were all within the 95% CrI for the full model of 0.180-0.331 (SI Figure 35). For

relative to the full model for three countries or territories (Guatemala, Panama, and Puerto
Rico), and had increased uncertainty at both the national and subnational levels.
Comparison to seroprevalence studies
Our median IAR estimates for Managua, Nicaragua (0.538; 95% CrI: 0.244-0.928) and Guayas,
Ecuador (0.503 ; 95% CrI: 0.153-0.902) were close to seroprevalence estimates from those regions
that were withheld from the fitting process (Figure 3). Overall, the 95% CI for 15 of 18 seroprevalence estimates from published studies overlapped with the 95% CrI of the IAR estimates
from our model for the corresponding administrative unit. These two measures are not necessarily identical for every country or territory, because many of the seroprevalence studies were
either conducted in only part of the administrative unit for which we estimated the IAR (e.g.,
the city of Salvador within Bahia State, Brazil or the city of Santos within São Paulo State,
Brazil) or were conducted well before the end of the epidemic (Bolivia). The three estimates that
did not overlap were Tarija, Bolivia (seroprevalence: 0.005; 95% CI: 0.000-0.015 vs. IAR: 0.108;
95% CrI: 0.043-0.275), Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (seroprevalence: 0.006; 95% CI: 0.000-0.016
vs. IAR: 0.055; 95% CrI: 0.038-0.078), and Bayamon, Puerto Rico (seroprevalence: 0.347; 95%
CI: 0.292-0.412 vs. IAR: 0.539; 95% CrI: 0.483-0.620).

Discussion
Our results show that the vast majority of ZIKV infections in the Americas went unreported
during the recent epidemic. PAHO reported fewer than one million suspected or confirmed
Zika cases, whereas we estimate that 132, 278, 856 (95% CrI: 111, 305, 999-170, 156, 510) people
were infected. This discrepancy is due to the high number of asymptomatic infections, as well
as estimated reporting rates below 1% for both suspected and confirmed Zika cases in many
countries. The majority of ZIKV infections (114, 112, 765; 95% CrI: 99, 394, 311-128, 358, 749)
occurred in the fifteen countries and territories that we modeled subnationally, while an additional 16, 160, 273 (95% CrI: 5, 426, 679-51, 709, 310) occurred in the remaining American territories where national IAR estimates were extrapolated from the estimated reporting rates from
the modeled countries. These estimates of the national and subnational IAR and total ZIKV
infections represent the most extensive attempt to date to estimate the size of the Zika epidemic
in the Americas.
Our results show significant within- and between-country variability in IARs. This large
variability in IARs could reflect spatial heterogeneity in habitat suitability for Ae. aegypti
(Kraemer et al., 2015). Early projections of the epidemic also predicted that the IAR would
be highly heterogeneous due to the geographic distribution of Ae. aegypti as well as other
factors likely to influence transmission intensity, such as temperature and economic prosperity
(Perkins et al., 2016). The historical pattern of virus introduction and spread may have also
contributed to the high level of within- and between-country variability in IAR (Zhang et al.,
2017). Local outbreaks in geographic regions or municipalities that began near the end of the
local transmission season may have ended before epidemic fadeout would be expected due to
herd immunity (Ferguson et al., 2016; Huber et al., 2018). Determining the extent to which this
spatial heterogeneity is the result of ZIKV epidemiology versus historical contingencies will be
important for identifying current and future at-risk populations.

Although our IAR estimates closely matched estimates from seroprevalence studies in some
areas (e.g., Managua, Nicaragua, Guayas, Ecuador, and Pernambuco, Brazil), other estimates
diverged from published seroprevalence estimates. One potential reason for the discrepancy
between our IAR estimates and serosurvey-based estimates is a mismatch in the spatial scale of
the region that the IAR estimate covers. For example, our estimate for the Brazilian state of
Bahia (0.514; 95% CrI: 0.388-0.631), was slightly lower than the seroprevalence estimates of 0.63
(95% CI: 0.595-0.671),0.68 (95% CI: 0.600-0.744), and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.70–0.76) from Salvador,
the largest city in Bahia (Netto et al., 2017; Moreira-Soto et al., 2018; Rodriguez-Barraquer
et al., 2019). However, the overall IAR in Bahia might be lower than the IAR in Salvador
if rural areas outside of Salvador experienced a lower infection attack rate. Serosurvey-based
estimates might also underestimate IAR if the sensitivity and specificity of the serological assay
are not taken into account. Only Rodriguez-Barraquer et al. (2019) reported seroprevalence
estimates adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity, which increased their estimate from 0.63
(95% CI: 0.60-0.65) to 0.73 (95% CI: 0.70-0.76) for Salvador, Brazil. Another potential cause
of discrepancies is that several of the serosurveys were conducted prior to completion of the
ZIKV epidemic. For example, the published seroprevalence estimates for Bolivia from Villarroel
et al. (2018) were conducted from December, 2016 until May, 2017, but Bolivia had significant
ZIKV transmission activity throughout 2017 and 2018. As a result, our IAR estimates which
incorporated data from 2017 and 2018 were higher than those reported by Villarroel et al. (2018).
Finally, posterior predictive checks showed that Puerto Rico was the only territory for which
our model did not accurately predict several of the observed data types, which may explain why
our IAR estimate for Bayamon, Puerto Rico was significantly different than the seroprevalence
estimate from Lozier et al. (2018). Puerto Rico has more administrative level-one areas (78)
than the other modeled countries and territories, which suggests that our model may produce
overly precise estimates when there is a large sample size and variation in the reporting rates of
different case types that is not spatially consistent. Conducting further serosurveys in a range
of locations across the Americas would be an important step in determining current levels of
immunity and would further validate our model estimates.
The estimated reporting rates for microcephaly in each territory were significantly lower
than the reported risk of microcephaly or CZS during pregnancy from several different studies.
Our microcephaly detection estimates are significantly lower than estimates from epidemiological studies because we are estimating both the probability of a ZIKV infection resulting in
microcephaly, and the probability that a microcephaly case was diagnosed and reported. Our
estimates also depended on estimates of the annual number of births in a region, but this could
represent an overestimate of the number of births at risk in many regions because the duration
of the epidemic in most localities was less than one year. Overestimating the number of births
at risk would lead to an underestimate of the microcephaly rate in a region or country. Whether
this underestimate in the microcephaly rate would also affect the estimate of IAR would depend
on the influence of the other data types on the total likelihood. The risk of microcephaly or CZS
has been estimated as 0.95% (95% CI: 0.34-1.91%) during the first trimester in French Polynesia
(Cauchemez et al., 2016), 2.3% (2 out of 86 births) in Colombia (Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2018),
and 5% (95% CI: 4-7%) among fetuses and infants born to women with laboratory-confirmed
ZIKV infection in the U.S. territories (Shapiro-Mendoza, 2017). In a cohort study in Rio de
Janerio, 42% of children born to ZIKV-infected mothers were found to have central nervous
system abnormalities, although only 4 of 117 were diagnosed with microcephaly (Brasil et al.,

2016). Our estimates ranged from 0.1 per 1,000 infections (95% CrI: 0-0.2) in Nicaragua to 8.7
per 1,000 infections (95% CrI: 7.1-11.4) in Brazil. Changes in the reporting rates of both ZIKV
infections and microcephaly over the course of the epidemic could also complicate the estimation
of the true risk of CZS (Hay et al., 2018).
Rates of GBS also varied significantly, ranging from 0.04 to 8.51 per 100,000 total ZIKV
infections. A recent review estimated a rate of 20 GBS cases per 100,000 ZIKV infections
(95% CrI: 5-45 per 100,000), which is higher than our estimates (Mier-y Teran-Romero et al.,
2018). However, that analysis also estimated the IAR for each location included in their study
and estimated lower IARs for Bahia, Brazil (0.02), Salvador, Brazil (0.08), Colombia (0.09), El
Salvador (0.15), and Honduras (0.04) than our model. Their IAR estimates for Bahia State
and Salvador in Brazil were also much lower than seroprevalence estimates from three studies
(Netto et al., 2017; Moreira-Soto et al., 2018; Rodriguez-Barraquer et al., 2019) that more closely
matched our IAR estimates for Bahia State. Underestimating the number of ZIKV infections
would lead to an overestimate of GBS incidence per infection. For Puerto Rico, where our
estimate for IAR (0.316; 95% CrI: 0.288 − 0.345) is within the 95% CrI of the IAR estimate
(0.17; 0.08-0.46) by Mier-y Teran-Romero et al. (2018), our estimate of 8.51 (95% CrI: 6.9411.15) GBS cases per 100,000 ZIKV infections is also within the range of their estimate of 14
(95% CrI: 4-25) GBS cases per 100,000 ZIKV infections. This overlap suggests that our method
of simultaneously estimating IAR, reporting rates, and the risk of GBS produces reasonable
estimates for GBS risk and reporting.
The current status of population-level immunity throughout the Americas has important
implications for the future of Zika epidemiology in the region (Ferguson et al., 2016; Lessler
et al., 2016; Perkins, 2017). Our IAR estimates suggest that a number of areas have high levels of herd immunity, which has also been suggested by other studies (O’Reilly et al., 2018).
However, the high degree of heterogeneity in subnational IARs suggests that certain areas in
Central and South America that are suitable for ZIKV transmission may still contain a considerable number of susceptible individuals. While some areas experienced a low IAR because
of environmental conditions that limited local transmission, such as high-elevation locations in
Colombia and Peru, there are other areas that had a low IAR where conditions appear favorable
for ZIKV transmission. For example, the Brazilian states of Pará and Amazonas had median
IAR estimates of 0.077 and 0.164, even though both were believed to be high-risk locations
(Messina et al., 2016; Perkins et al., 2016) based on high suitability for Ae. aegypti (Brady
et al., 2014; Kraemer et al., 2015) and historical dengue incidence (Bhatt et al., 2013; Siqueira
et al., 2005). If the remaining population-at-risk is large in these areas, then local outbreaks in
the near future could still be possible. Modeling studies also suggest that the presence of multiple locations with incomplete herd immunity increases the chances that ZIKV becomes endemic
in the region in the next decade as new births replenish the susceptible population (Ferguson
et al., 2016). Although Zika incidence in the Americas in 2019 appears to be much lower than
during the epidemic, limited transmission has been reported in multiple countries and recent
Zika outbreaks have also been reported in Africa and Asia (ProMED-mail, 2019), leaving open
the possibility that ZIKV could be re-introduced into vulnerable populations. However, it is also
possible that there was significant transmission in these states prior to the detection of ZIKV
transmission in the Americas, in which case the actual IAR could be higher than we estimate.
Genomic data suggests that ZIKV was present in northeast Brazil by early 2014 and spread to
multiple countries before Zika surveillance began (Faria et al., 2017). Microcephaly data can re-

construct some of this missed portion of the epidemic due to the lag between maternal infection
and birth, but even this data will miss infections that occurred more than a year prior to the
first case reports.
Because of the high variation in estimated reporting rates among modeled countries, there
was a high degree of uncertainty in our projections of IAR in the non-modeled territories.
Previous studies have also found high variation in the probability of a ZIKV infection being
reported between countries (O’Reilly et al., 2018). This resulted in a fair amount of uncertainty
in our estimates of the total number of ZIKV infections (95% CrI: 111, 305, 999-170, 156, 510).
However, because most of the non-modeled territories were relatively small in population size
(the total estimated population size in the 15 modeled territories is 507.1 million versus 116.6
million in the 33 non-modeled territories) the median estimate is largely a reflection of infections
in the modeled countries. Because we were unable to precisely estimate IAR without estimating
territory-specific reporting rates, the publication of subnational totals for different types of
Zika cases (suspected, microcephaly, etc.) would help greatly in refining these estimates. The
publication of this data in conjunction with seroprevalence data would be particularly valuable
for examining differences in surveillance systems and the geographic variation in IAR throughout
the entire region (Ferguson et al., 2016).
The Zika epidemic in the Americas was a major public health concern that drew considerable
attention from both the public health sector and the general public. Despite this attention,
the majority of infections were not detected by public health surveillance systems. Using a
hierarchical Bayesian model with empirically-informed priors, we were able to leverage Zika case
reporting to simultaneously estimate national and subnational reporting rates, the fraction of
symptomatic infections, and subnational IARs. Our results indicate that fewer than 1% of ZIKV
infections in the Americas were reported during the recent epidemic. In the absence of detailed
seroprevalence data, our subnational and national IAR estimates are an important first attempt
at assessing current levels of ZIKV immunity throughout the Americas. Current levels of herd
immunity are a critical determinant of the probability of further Zika outbreaks—and potentially
the likelihood of dengue outbreaks as well—in this region in the next decade.

Zika data

We collected publicly available Zika data for the 15 countries or territories where we were able
to find subnational case counts for at least one data type (SI Table 1). The potential data
types considered were confirmed Zika cases (either lab or clinically confirmed), suspected Zika
cases, microcephaly cases associated with a ZIKV infection in the mother, Zika-associated cases
of Guillan-Barré syndrome (GBS), and the proportion of blood donors with a positive ZIKV
infection (Puerto Rico only). Many territories also reported the number of suspected or confirmed Zika cases in pregnant women. Where available, these counts were treated as independent
observations from the population-wide observations. Although cases in pregnant women and in
the entire population are treated as independent data points, we assume that the infection attack rate (IAR) is the same in both populations. A graphical representation of how IAR was
estimated from the observed data is provided in Figure (1) of the main text. Short descriptions
for each of the variables and parameters included in the model are presented in SI Table (2).
Where available, we obtained Zika data at the first administrative level (e.g., province or
state) within a country or territory. Where lower level data was available, it was aggregated to
the first administrative level. The majority of datasets were obtained either from governmental websites or from country reports produced by PAHO (Pan American Health Organization
(PAHO), 2017a). Details on the time period covered by each dataset and data sources are provided in SI Table (1). Where data totals were provided by epidemiological week, the start and
end dates for these reporting periods were obtained from the governmental report or assumed
to match the dates of WHO epidemiological weeks. Although we list the start and end periods
of reporting for each data type, in some instances there may have been gaps in reporting during
this period.

Blood donor infections

To prevent transfusion-associated transmission of ZIKV, Puerto Rico began screening all blood
donations for ZIKV in April, 2016 (Chevalier et al., 2017). Because this method has the ability
to detect asymptomatic infections in contrast to most of the other surveillance methods included
in our analysis, we used this data to estimate IAR in Puerto Rico. This data was available at the
regional level (n=8) through January 7, 2017 from Puerto Rico Health Department (2018b). The
number of blood donors with an active ZIKV infection, Ii , within a population of screened blood
donors Di , was related to the IAR by the parameter, ρI , which corrects for the fact that blood
donation is only possible when an individual is asymptomatic and adjusts for the mean duration
of viremia in asymptomatic individuals (including pre-symptomatic individuals) relative to the
duration of the collection period. As a result, the number of infections among blood donors is
assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, Ii ∼ Poisson(Di NIi ρi I ).
We followed the methodology of Chevalier et al. (2017) in estimating a prior distribution
for the incidence correction factor, ρI , with a few modifications to reflect the timeframe of our
study and additional data available since their study was published. To account for the transient
nature of viremia in an infected individual, the number of observed infections in blood donors
was scaled by the probability that a blood donor would have a detectable viremia at the time of
donation. The duration of collection (d = 41 weeks) is therefore divided by the mean duration
of ZIKV viremia (υ), resulting in a crude scaling factor of fB = d/υ (Busch et al., 2006).
This scaling factor is biased because symptomatic individuals are removed during the screening
process, meaning that only people with asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infections will donate
blood. The unbiased scaling factor assuming only asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals
donate is,
υ
ρI = fB
,
(1)
υpa + i(1 − pa )
where pa is the probability an infection is asymptomatic and i is the mean incubation period.
The prior distribution for ρI was estimated using the distributions for the incubation period
and viremic period described in Chevalier et al. (2017), and the probability of asymptomatic
infection in Puerto Rico from Mitchell et al. (2019) and fit to a gamma distribution using the
‘fitdistr’ package in R, resulting in a Gamma(15.97, 0.42) prior.

Model implementation and diagnostics

Each country or territory model was fitted using the ‘rstan’ version 2.18.2 package in R (Stan
Development Team, 2018) using the ‘No-U-turn’ sampling algorithm with four chains of 5,000
iterations and a 50% burn-in period. Smaller step sizes for the sampling algorithm were set by
increasing the adapt delta parameter from the default of 0.8 to 0.99. In addition, the maximum
tree depth was increased from 10 to 15. Convergence was assessed using the Gelman-Rubin
convergence diagnostic, Rc (Gelman et al., 2013). The Rc values for every parameter in each of
the 15 county or territory models were < 1.05, indicating that each model achieved convergence.
Traceplots of the log of the posterior distribution are provided in SI Figure (1).

Testing model assumptions

In the analysis presented in the main text, we used a Beta(1, 2) prior for the IAR in each
country or territory model. The intention of this prior was to lightly constrain our ZIKV IAR
estimates and prevent the model from converging towards extreme estimates without precluding
the possibility of values anywhere between 0 and 1. This prior distribution has a median value
of 0.292 (95% range: 0.013–0.842). To examine the sensitivity our IAR estimates to this prior
assumption, we also ran a model version for each territory with a uniform prior on the IAR. With
the uniform prior for the subnational IARs, the posterior IAR estimates at both the subnational
and national level were higher for all 15 modeled countries and territories except for Costa Rica
(SI Table 3; SI Figure 2).
In the analysis presented in the main text, we assumed that the reporting of symptomatic
ZIKV infections, Zi , as suspected cases, Si , followed a binomial distribution, ST,i ∼ Bin(Zi , ρST,i ).
The probability of a symptomatic infection being reported as a suspected case, ρST,i , in administrative unit i of a country or territory followed a beta distribution with hyperparameters αST
and βST . However, because there is considerable overlap between the symptoms of a ZIKV
infection and the symptoms of several other arbovirus infections—including dengue and chikungunya—the number of suspected Zika cases could exceed the number of symptomatic ZIKV
infections if other arbovirus infections were misdiagnosed as ZIKV during the epidemic. To
account for this possibility, we also considered a model where ST,i ∼ Poisson(Zi ρST,i ). The
reporting rate for suspected cases was allowed to range above one by drawing from a gamma
distribution, ρST,i ∼ Gamma(αST , 1/βST ). The gamma distribution hyperparameters, αST and
βST , were assigned truncated standard normal prior distributions. These hyperparameter priors
result in a mean of αST βST = 0.64, and a variance of αST βS2 T = 0.512 for the prior of the gamma
distribution.
The version of the model with a Poisson distribution for suspected cases was run for Costa
Rica, Guatemala, Panama, and Puerto Rico. These four countries and territories represented the
range of estimated suspected reporting rates that were observed for the model with a binomial
distribution, with Guatemala and Panama having relatively low estimates of ρST , and Costa
Rica and Puerto Rico having the second highest and highest estimates of ρST , respectively. The
values of ρST did not vary significantly between the models with binomial or Poisson distributions
for Panama (0.092; 95% CrI: 0.024-0.436 vs. 0.074; 95% CrI: 0.021-0.343) or Guatemala (0.027;
95% CrI: 0.001-0.194 vs. 0.040; 95% CrI: 0.0022-0.268) (SI Figure 3). In addition, the IAR
estimates for these two countries differed by <1% (SI Figure 4). The median estimate of ρST
for Costa Rica was lower with the Poisson distribution (0.14; 95% CrI: 0.029 − 0.768) than with
the binomial distribution (0.255; 95% CrI: 0.037 − 0.908) (SI Figure 3). This decrease in the
estimated reporting rate was only associated with a small increase in the IAR estimate from
0.092 (95% CrI: 0.019 − 0.193) to 0.102 (95% CrI: 0.026 − 0.206) (SI Figures 4-5). Puerto Rico
had the highest estimate of ρST when suspected cases were binomially distributed, with a median
of 0.933 and a upper 95% credible interval very close to 1 (95% CrI: 0.632 − 0.999). When we
assumed suspected cases followed a Poisson distribution, the median estimate of ρST was 0.299
(95% CrI: 0.099−0.958). The marginal posterior distribution for ρST with a Poisson distribution
was much broader than with the binomial distribution, and although the 95% credible interval
was below 1 the upper estimates from the posterior were greater than 1 (SI Figure 3). The
estimated territory-wide IAR in Puerto Rico was higher with a Poisson distribution (0.38; 95%
CrI: 0.325 − 0.437) than with the binomial distribution (0.316; 95% CrI: 0.288 − 0.345) (SI

distribution, but several estimates were lower than they were with a binomial distribution (SI

Infection attack rate projections

The territory-level IARs and number of ZIKV infections for all of the Americas were estimated by
extrapolating parameter estimates from the 15 modeled countries and territories to the remaining
countries and territories in the region. ZIKV IAR and the total number of ZIKV infections
were estimated for the 33 countries and territories that reported confirmed Zika cases (C),
suspected Zika cases (S), and Zika-associated microcephaly cases (M ) to the Pan American
Health Organization (PAHO) (2018). A national IAR estimate was obtained by drawing from
the posterior distributions of the different reporting parameters from each of the 15 country
models. This allowed us to draw from across the full range of estimated reporting rates from
these 15 countries and territories in predicting the IARs in the remaining territories. For a
given model, k, the probability of a given IAR value in country j was derived from the joint
probability of the probability density functions for each of the different data types (Cj , Sj ,
I
and/or Mj ) that were used to fit that model. The IAR, Nj,kj , for country j from model k
I

given Cj was estimated using a binomial distribution Cj ∼ Bin(Nj , ρCj,k ρZk Nj,kj ), where ρCj,k
was drawn from ρCj,k ∼ Beta(αCk , βCk ) using the posterior distributions for αCk and βCk from
Ij,k
Ij,k
Nj ) and Mj ∼ Bin(Bj , ρMi Nj ). These probability
I
densities were calculated across a range of Nj,kj from 0 to 1 based on 1,000 draws from the
I
posterior distribution of model k. The combined probability density function for Njj across all
P
I
K = 15 models was Njj = K
k=1 (Ij,k |Θj )/KNj .

model k. Similarly, Sj ∼ Bin(Nj , ρSj,k ρZk

Examples of the IAR probability distributions are presented in SI figures (22-25). The IAR
probability distributions for the remaining countries and territories are located in the Github
repository https://github.com/mooresea/Zika_IAR. The median IAR estimates and total
number of ZIKV infections in each country and territory are provided in SI Table (4). For the 15
modeled territories, these estimates use the modeled IAR estimates rather than IAR projections
based on the range of reporting rates observed across all 15 territories. A comparison of the
modeled IAR estimates versus the IAR projections for each of these territories is provided in
SI Table (5). The 95% CrIs for the projected IAR estimates include the mean of the model
posterior for the national-level IAR for all 15 modeled territories. However, for most territories
the 95% CrI for the projections is very broad, with a lower bound near 0 and an upper bound
at 1. These broad credible intervals are an inevitable result of the high variability in estimated
reporting rates among the modeled territories, which results in a high uncertainty in IARs when
sampling reporting rates from across the posterior distributions from every model. The median
projected IAR is very similar to the modeled IAR estimate for several countries (e.g., Brazil,
Honduras, Nicaragua), but drastically different for several other territories, including Belize and
Puerto Rico. These results suggest that the projections for non-modeled territories should be
interpreted cautiously. Fortunately, most of the non-modeled countries have small populations
and do not contribute significantly to the continent-wide estimate of ZIKV infections.
