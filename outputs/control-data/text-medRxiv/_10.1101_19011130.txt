Abstract

21

Background: Malnutrition especially under nutrition is the main problem that is seen over

22

people living with HIV/AIDS and can occur at any age. Multiple factors contributed to

23

malnutrition of HIV/AIDS patients and it need immediate identification and prompt action. The

24

objective of this study was to assess the nutritional status of patients and identify factors

25

associated with malnutrition among HIV/AIDS patients on follow-up care in Jimma medical

26

center, Southwest Ethiopia.

27

Methods: A cross-sectional study design was conducted from March-April, 2016. Data was

28

collected retrospectively from clinical records of HIV/AIDS patients enrolled for follow up care

29

in ART clinic from June 2010 to January 2016. Binary and multiple variable logistic regression

30

was done to identify independent predictor of malnutrition.

31

Results: Data of 971 patients were included in the study. The prevalence of under nutrition

32

(BMI<18.5) was (36.8%) (95% CI: 33.8%-39.8%) and out of which severe malnutrition accounts

33

9.7%. Overweight and obese was 8.6%. Malnutrition was more likely among widowed patients

34

(AOR=1.7, 95% CI, 1.034-2.798), patients in the WHO clinical AIDS staging of three

35

(AOR=2.3, 95% CI, 1.392-3.693) and four (AOR=3.2, 95% CI, 1.667-5.943), patients with CD4

36

cell count of <200 cells/mm3 (AOR=2.0, 95% CI, 1.463-2.837) and patients with a functional

37

status of bedridden (AOR=4.677, 95% CI, 1.761-12.419) and ambulatory (AOR=2.763, 95% CI,

38

1.833-4.165).

39

Conclusion: Both under nutrition and overweight are prevalent among HIV/AIDS patients

40

in Jimma Medical Center, Ethiopia. Malnutrition was significantly associated with clinical

41

outcome of patients. Hence, nutritional assessment, care and support should be strengthened.

42

Critical identification of malnourished patients and prompt interventions should be undertaken.

43

Introduction

44

Human immune deficiency virus (HIV) and malnutrition has multifaceted and multidirectional

45

relationships. Both are related each other in causing progressive damage to the immune system.

46

HIV compromises nutritional status and poor nutrition further weakness the immune system of

47

individuals, increasing susceptibility to opportunistic infections. HIV can cause or worsen

48

malnutrition by causing reduced food uptake, increased energy requirements and poor nutrient

49

absorptions(1–3).

50

Poor nutritional status is one of the major complications of HIV and a significant factor in a full-

51

blown AIDS. In many resource limited settings, many people who become infected with HIV

52

may already be undernourished due to factors such as unemployment and difficulty to procure

53

food. Food insecurity remains the major challenge in the progresses made to avert morbidity and

54

mortality attributed to HIV/AIDS. Food insecurity and malnutrition increase high risk sexual

55

behaviors, inconsistent condom use and multiple partnership. On the other hand, malnutrition

56

leads to ART non-adherence among HIV/AIDS patients (4,5).

57

In Sub-Saharan Africa region, malnutrition (both under nutrition and overweight) is prevalent

58

among HIV/AIDS patients enrolled in care (6–8). The prevalence of adult under nutrition is 19%

59

in Tanzania(6), 10% in Zimbabwe(7) and 19% in Senegal(9). The prevalence of malnutrition is

60

also high in Ethiopia; 25.2% in Butajira hospital(10) and 12.3% in Dilla university hospital(11).

61

The main determinants of malnutrition ranges from individual level factors to underlying factors.

62

Prevalence of malnutrition is determined by wealth index and educational attainment, where

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19011130; this version posted November 5, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

63

malnutrition decreased with increase in wealth index and educational attainment(12). A lower

64

CD4 cell count, sex, age, advanced HIV diseases, presence of opportunistic infections, adherence

65

concern, inability to access food and having social support were also significantly associated

66

with malnutrition (6,7,9,13). Malnutrition is less likely in Females and older ages (35-44 years

67

and ≥45 years) compared to 15-24 years. Having social support and informal care giving had

68

also reduced the odds of under nutrition(13). On the contrary, malnutrition is more likely in those

69

who had advanced HIV disease(6,7,9).

70

The high prevalence of HIV/AIDS(14) compounded by high rates of malnutrition remains the

71

main challenge of health systems in SSA region. Currently, beyond under nutrition, overweight

72

is also the main problem among HIV/AIDS patients. Despite improvement in treatment coverage

73

over time(14), treatment effectiveness remains low due to factors such as non-adherence, quality

74

and nutritional status of patients (15,16). The probability of mortality is highest among patients

75

with poor nutritional status, as malnutrition is the cause for damage in the immune system and

76

subsequent susceptibility to illnesses(17).

77

With encouraging effort from government and partners, Ethiopia has achieved encouraging

78

results by reducing HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality. Between 2000 and 2017, new HIV

79

infections reduced by 90% and AIDS related mortality among adults reduced by more than 50%.

80

While, HIV treatment coverage was reached to 71% in 2017(18). Though, the prevalence of

81

HIV/AIDS remains high (0.9%) (19) and in 2017 there were an estimated 613,000 people living

82

with HIV/AIDS, out of which 29% lacked access to treatments. Ethiopia remained one among

83

the 25 countries with the highest number of new HIV infections worldwide. Out of the 25

84

countries, 17 were located in Africa region(18).

85

HIV infection and poor nutritional status are interlinked and strengthening nutritional

86

assessment, care and support is essential to improve the effectiveness of HIV treatments. This

87

requires generating evidences on the prevalence of malnutrition and factors affecting it. Hence,

88

this study was aimed to estimate the prevalence of malnutrition (under nutrition) among adult

89

HIV/AIDS patients enrolled in HIV/AIDS care in the period between 2010 and 2016 at Jimma

90

Medical Center, a tertiary hospital in Ethiopia with an established HIV/AIDS treatment program.

91

Materials and Methods

92

Study setting

93

Jimma Medical Center, formerly known as Jimma University Specialized Hospital, was one of

94

the teaching hospitals in Ethiopia located in Jimma city administration, 355km Southwest

95

direction of the capital city, Addis Ababa. It is a government hospital which is an affiliate of

96

Jimma University providing trainings for health science students in a range of disciples. The

97

hospital also provides a higher level of clinical care for around 15 million catchment population

98

located in Southwest part of Ethiopia. The hospital has 36 departments, of which ART clinic was

99

one among them. Since 2005, the hospital has been providing highly active antiretroviral therapy

100

(HAART) for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). During the study period (July 2010 to

101

January 2016), about a total of 5554 patients were on HAART.

102

Study design

103

A cross-sectional study design was conducted. Data was collected retrospectively from clinical

104

records of HIV/AIDS patients enrolled for follow up care in ART clinic from July 2010 to

105

January 2016. Data was retrieved from Pre-ART and ART log books of adults (>15 years). Data

106

was extracted from March to April 2016.

107

Study participants selection

108

The study participants were cohort of HIV/AIDS patients on follow-up care who are eligible for

109

this study. The study participants were selected by using a systematic sampling strategy; where

110

the clinical records of ART clients from July 2010 to January 2016 was used as a sampling

111

frame. First, a sequential numbers starting from 1001 was provided to each records. The first

112

record of patient was selected using lottery method and every Kth records was identified for data

113

abstraction. HIV/AIDS patients who have a follow-up care on the same facility and that have key

114

baseline information’s such as demographic characteristics (age, ethnicity, and marital status)

115

and clinical information (such as CD4 count, viral load, WHO clinical stage, weight, height, and

116

hemoglobin level) were eligible for this study.

117

The sample size was computed using OpenEpi Version 3 sample size calculator for proportions

118

by using assumptions of a 95% CI, the outcome factor in the population of 46.8%(20) and

119

confidence limit of 3%. The calculated sample size yields 1062.

120

Measurement

121

A data abstraction tool, having the same structure with ART register and patient cards, was used

122

to collect data. The tool comprised of components such as patient back ground information,

123

immunologic status, clinical and laboratory examinations (CD4 count, viral load, WHO clinical

124

stage, weight, height) and antiretroviral regimen and opportunistic infection prophylaxis. Three

125

clinicians who had also trained on ART service provision were recruited for data collection.

126

Another clinician also supervised the overall data collection processes.

127

Statistical analysis

128

Data was cleaned for inconsistency and incompleteness. Then it was entered to epidata version

129

3.1 and imported to SPSS version 21. Descriptive statistics was conducted and variables were

130

presented using mean, frequencies and proportion. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as

131

weight in kilograms divided by the squares of height in meters (kg/m2). For the initial analysis,

132

BMI was stratified into the WHO criteria: <18.5 (under nutrition), >18.5 to 25 (normal nutrition)

133

and >25 kg/m2 (overweight and obese). In this study under nutrition or BMI (<18.5 kg/m 2) was

134

estimated (3). Independent predictors of adult malnutrition, such as socio-demographic and

135

clinical characteristics, were determined using binary and multiple variable logistic regression.

136

Covariates for the multiple variable analysis were selected using Backward LR method. While,

137

the model fitness (goodness) was assessed by using Wald test for individual variables and

138

maximum likelihood ratio test for overall model.

139

Ethical consideration

140

Research protocol was submitted to Institute of Health of Jimma university and get ethical

141

approval (Ref no. RPGC/26/2016; March, 2016). Research permission was obtained from Jimma

142

Medical Center. Confidentiality of patient information was maintained though use of codes,

143

where name and personal identifiers of patients was not recorded. Paper based data was kept in a

144

locked cabinet and computer based data was secured with passwords. Except the research team

145

member, any one couldn’t access patient data.

Participation

151

A total of 971 complete ART registrations and client records which incorporated basic

152

information’s were included in the analysis, making a document completion rate of 91%.

Socio-demographic characteristics

154

Table 1 shows the socio-demographic characteristics of patients on HIV/AIDS follow care. Most

155

of the study participants were Female (60%) and in the age group of <30 years (41%). Nearly

156

half (48.2%) of them were married and over half were followers of orthodox religion (58%).

157

While, 89% were unemployed and slightly over 4 in 10 (43.5%) of them had attended primary

158

education (Table 1).

Table 2 shows the clinical characteristics, HIV/AIDS disclosure status, access to spiritual care

161

giver and HIV support group, counseling and health education on HIV, and adherence concern of

162

patients on HIV/AIDS follow care. Majority of patients disclosed their status (87%) and slightly

163

over 3/4th of them had attended HIV related health education sessions (76.5%). Nearly a third

164

(29%) of them were in the WHO clinical stage of II and another 33% were at WHO stage of III

165

at start of ART. Moreover, slightly over half (55.8%) have CD4 count <200 and over 3/4th

166

(77.6%) of them had a working functional status at start of ART (Table 2).

Prevalence of Malnutrition

168

Table 3 shows the prevalence of malnutrition among the socio-demographic and clinical

169

characteristics of patients. The prevalence of malnutrition (under nutrition) in the study area was

170

357(36.8%) (95% CI: 33.8%-39.8%). Out of which, severe malnutrition accounts 94(9.7%) and

171

moderate malnutrition accounts of 263(27.1%). While, the prevalence of overweight and obese

172

was 8.6%.

173

Under nutrition was more prevalent in female (57.5%), <30 years age group (41.7%), married

174

(44.2%), orthodox religious follower (54.6%), primary education status (44%) and unemployed

175

patients (90.4%) (Table 3).

176

Socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with malnutrition

177

Table 4 and 5 shows binary and multiple variable analysis of different independent variables

178

associated with malnutrition, respectively. In the binary logistic regression, only marital status

179

was identified as a socio-demographic candidate variable for multiple variable logistic regression

180

analysis. The remaining variables didn’t show any statistically significant association. The

181

remaining were clinical variables including WHO clinical AIDS staging, CD4 cell count,

182

functional status, diagnosed for active TB and patient attended HIV related health education

183

sessions previously. In the multiple variable logistic regression, marital status, WHO clinical

184

AIDS staging, CD4 cell count and patient functional status were identified as independent

185

predictors of malnutrition.

186

With regard to marital status, a greater number of malnourished patients were found in the group

187

of the widowed (45.7%) followed by the single or never married ones (40.2%). Being a widow

188

was significantly associated with malnutrition (AOR=1.7, 95% CI, 1.034-2.798).

189

HIV/AIDS patients in the WHO clinical AIDS staging three (47.8%) and four (59.8%) were

190

more malnourished compared to patients in stage one and two. Being in the WHO clinical AIDS

191

stage of three (AOR=2.3, 95% CI, 1.392-3.693) and four (AOR=3.2, 95% CI, 1.667-5.943) were

192

significantly associated with malnutrition among adult HIV/AIDS patients in the study area.

193

Likewise, a greater number of malnourished patients had a CD4 cell count of <200cells/μL (45%

194

versus 26%) and were bedridden (70%) and ambulatory (61%) in their functional status. There is

195

a statistical significant association between patients CD4 cell count (AOR=2.0, 95% CI, 1.463-

196

2.837) and their functional status with malnutrition. Being bedridden (AOR=4.677, 95% CI,

197

1.761-12.419) and ambulatory (AOR=2.763, 95% CI, 1.833-4.165) were significantly associated

198

with malnutrition among adult HIV/AIDS patients in the study area.

199

In the binary logistic regression analysis, HIV AIDS disclosure status, being diagnosed for active

200

TB and attended HIV related health education sessions were significantly associated with

201

malnutrition. However, the association of these variables was not maintained after adjusting for

202

all independent variables (Table 4 and 5).

203

Discussion

204

This study was intended to estimate the prevalence of malnutrition and its determinants among

205

adult HIV/AIDS patients who were enrolled on care or who were on ART treatments. The study

206

had indicated that the overall prevalence of malnutrition (under nutrition) in the study area was

207

36.8% and out of which, severe malnutrition (<16 kg/m2) accounts of 9.7%. We found that,

208

patient marital status, WHO clinical AIDS staging, CD4 cell count and patient functional status

209

were significantly associated with malnutrition.

210

The prevalence of malnutrition was higher than a study conducted in different parts of Ethiopia;

211

12.3% in Dilla university hospital (11) , 25.2% in Butajira hospital (10), 18.2% in Arba Minch

212

area public health facilities (21), 30% in East Hararghe zone hospitals(22) and 27% in Nekemte

213

referral hospital (23). Likewise, the prevalence is also much higher compared to studies done in

214

different parts of the world; 19.5% in Tanzania(6), 10% in Zimbabwe(7) and 19.2% in

215

Senegal(9). The difference in prevalence of malnutrition might be due to difference in socio-

216

economic and other factors that may predispose the community to problem, such as food habit

217

and culture. However, the prevalence of severe malnutrition (BMI<16kg/m2) was comparable to

218

studies done at Tanzania (9%)(6) and Butajira hospital(9%)(10).

219

In our study under nutrition was more prevalent among female patients than male. This is

220

comparable with other studies done in different parts of Ethiopia; Southern (11)and Eastern

221

Ethiopia(22). Yet different from studies done in SSA countries (6,7) and slightly higher among

222

male patients in study done in Butajira hospital, Southern Ethiopia(10). This implies that under

223

nutrition is more common among females and this might be related to the socio-economic status

224

of women, access to information and other predisposing factors that may affect food intake of

225

women in the community. On the other hand, most women are already undernourished than men

226

in the general population. In Ethiopia, only 51% of female attended school compared to 65% of

227

men. Employment status was much higher among men than women. Likewise, most women

228

were not accessed to mass media and internet compared to men. In Ethiopia, 24% of women

229

aged 15-49 years were anemic and 22% were thin (BMI<18.5 kg/m2) (19).

230

Our study also indicated that, malnutrition is more prevalent in younger, married, primary

231

education level and unemployed patients compared to their counter parts. As the age of patient’s

232

increased, the prevalence of malnutrition was decreased in the study area. This is comparable

233

with studies done in different parts of the world (6,7) and Ethiopia(10,22), where under nutrition

234

is more prevalent among the younger adults and overweight is more prevalent among older

235

patients. Additionally, studies also supports the higher prevalence of malnutrition among

236

unemployed patients and patients in the lower educational status(11,24,25). While studies done

237

in Northern and Southern Ethiopia indicated contradicting finding in which under nutrition was

238

associated with greater age(11,26). Malnutrition was also much prevalent in patients on WHO

239

clinical stage three and four, CD4 cell count less than 200 and in patients with a past

240

opportunistic infections. This indicates interlink between HIV infection and poor nutritional

241

status. HIV compromises the nutritional status and poor nutrition further weakens the immune

242

system of individuals, increasing susceptibility to opportunistic infections(2).

243

In the multivariable logistic regression, patient marital status, WHO clinical AIDS staging, CD4

244

cell count and functional status were statistically associated with under nutrition in the study

245

area. In the binary logistic regression variables such as diagnosis of active TB, attending HIV

246

related health education sessions and disclosing HIV status were significantly associated with

247

malnutrition. Though, these variables didn’t show a statistical significant associations while

248

adjusted for other variables.

249

Our study revealed that, being a widow was significantly associated with malnutrition.

250

HIV/AIDS patients who were in the WHO clinical stage of three and four were two times and

251

three times more likely malnourished than those in the WHO clinical stage of one, respectively.

252

In addition, malnutrition was also more likely among patients with CD4 cell count of <200 and

253

patients with functional status of bedridden and ambulatory. Malnutrition was nearly five times

254

and three times more likely among bedridden and ambulatory patients compared to patients who

255

have a working functional status, respectively. Our finding was supported by other studies done

256

in other areas else(6,7,10,11,13,21,22,24–26).

257

Malnutrition is the major factor in ensuring treatment effectiveness and thus, nutritional

258

assessments, care and support for HIV/AIDS patients should be strengthened. Poor adherence is

259

caused by lack of access to food or food insecurity. On the other hand, poor treatment adherence

260

leads to infections and suppressed immunity of patients(9). Mortality is more likely among

261

immune compromised HIV/AIDS patients and supplementation of therapeutic food can improve

262

the nutritional status of patients(17).

263

Our study had assessed the prevalence of malnutrition on patients enrolled in care in the five

264

successive periods (2010 and 2016). Moreover, adequate sample size was used to estimate

265

malnutrition prevalence. Yet, our study has the following limitations. The study was based on

266

secondary data (chart review) and thus may not address all of the variables that may affect

267

malnutrition and may be subject to incomplete data bias.

268

Conclusions

269

This finding indicated that the prevalence of malnutrition (both under nutrition and overweight)

270

was high compared to other settings in Ethiopia. It was also indicated that WHO clinical AIDS

271

staging three and four, CD4 cell count <200, functional status and marital status were

272

significantly associated with malnutrition among adult HIV/AIDS patients. Though not

273

statistically significant when adjusted to other variables, HIV disclosure status and access to HIV

274

related health education were also associated with malnutrition. Hence, HIV treatment services

275

should be supported with nutritional assessment, supplementation, counseling, care and support

276

to patients. A comprehensive nutritional assessment and support should be provided for all
