Objective To evaluate whether socioeconomic inequalities in blood pressure (BP) have changed from
1989 to 2016—a period in which average BP levels declined and the detection and treatment of high
BP increased.
Design Repeated observational studies.
Setting 3 nationally representative British birth cohort studies—born in 1946, 1958, and 1970—and
21 nationally representative cross-sectional studies (Health Survey for England 1994 to 2016, HSE).
Participants 147,775 participants with BP outcomes at age 42-46 years (cohorts) or 25 years and
over (HSE).
Main outcome measure Absolute differences in systolic BP (SBP) by educational attainment
(cohorts and HSE) and early life social class (cohorts).
Results In both datasets, lower education was associated with higher SBP, with similar absolute
magnitudes of inequality across the studied period. Differences in SBP by education (Slope Index of
Inequality) based on HSE data were 3.0mmHg (95% CI: 1.8, 4.2) in 1994 and 4.3mmHg (2.3, 6.3) in
2016. Findings were similar for diastolic BP (DBP) and survey-defined hypertension. Cohort data
suggested that disadvantage in early and adult life had cumulative independent associations with BP:
cohort-pooled differences in SBP were 4.9mmHg (3.7, 6.1) in a score combining early life social class
and own education, yet were 3.4mmHg (2.4, 4.4) for education alone. In both datasets, inequalities
were found across the SBP distribution—below and above hypertension thresholds—yet were larger
at the upper tail; in HSE, median SBP differences were 2.8mmHg (1.7, 3.9) yet 5.6mmHg (4.9, 6.4) at
the 90th quantile.
Conclusion Socioeconomic inequalities in BP have persisted from 1989 to 2016, despite improved
detection and treatment of high BP. To achieve future reductions in BP inequalities, policies
addressing the wider structural determinants of high BP levels are likely required—targeting detection
and treatment alone is unlikely to be sufficient.

Introduction
Blood pressure (BP) is a key modifiable determinant of cardiovascular disease, with higher risk
continuing across its distribution beyond the thresholds for initiating treatment.1 Cardiovascular
diseases in turn remain leading causes of mortality worldwide,2 with substantial public health and
associated economic costs. Higher BP—particularly in midlife3 4—is also implicated in the occurrence
of dementia and related neurological outcomes.5 6 As such, monitoring of BP at the population-level is
important, as are understanding its socioeconomic inequality given its likely contribution to inequities
in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.7

While there is repeated evidence that more disadvantaged socioeconomic position (SEP) is correlated
with, and potentially causally linked with, higher BP,8-13 important gaps in understanding remain.
Effects of SEP on a given health outcome are likely to be context-specific and modifiable by societal
change and public health policy.14 15 In the UK and other high income countries, average BP levels
have declined from the 1970s onwards16—a change typically attributed to decreased salt intake in
foods17 and improved hypertension detection and treatment.18 How these and other changes such as
secular increases in diabetes and obesity (themselves socially patterned)12 19 have impacted on
socioeconomic inequalities in BP however, remains unclear. The most recent UK analysis of trends in
BP inequalities used repeated cross-sectional data from England in 1994-200812 and requires updating
using more recent data. It is also likely limited by 1) using an indirect area-based SEP indicator,
which may be biased due to measurement error or socioeconomic and health-related migration,20 21
and 2) not accounting for use of BP lowering treatment—an important consideration since increases
in levels of treatment for high BP across time in England and worldwide18 22 may have narrowed or
widened observed (post-treatment) inequalities in BP.

There are also uncertainties regarding the life course nature of inequalities in BP—that is, when in
life, exposure to disadvantaged SEP impacts on adult BP outcomes. Existing studies have suggested

that there are cumulative effects of disadvantaged SEP across life on higher BP (i.e. that there are
independent effects of exposure to disadvantage in both child and adult life),23 while other studies
have suggested that childhood SEP is particularly important for adult BP (among men).24 This
evidence is based on analysis conducted in separate British birth cohorts using different empirical
strategies.23-26 In contrast, a co-ordinated analytic approach across these cohorts can increase statistical
power, improve result generalisability, and enable testing of whether such processes have changed
across time.

A final limitation of the existing evidence—across all data sources—is that studies typically examine
SEP differences in average levels of BP (linear regression), or in binary outcomes (logistic
regression);13 it is therefore unclear how SEP differences relate to the population distribution of BP.
The consequences of BP inequalities are likely more pronounced if the magnitude of associations are
largest amongst those at highest risk—i.e., those with highest BP levels (the upper tail of the
distribution). While infrequently used in the epidemiological literature, quantile regression analysis
can inform this.27

UK studies of BP inequalities have used different data sources separately—such as repeated crosssectional12 or single birth cohort studies.10 24 25 28 29 This study is the first, to our knowledge, to conduct
co-ordinated analyses across national birth cohort studies and repeated cross-sectional surveys to
examine change across time in BP inequalities. A co-ordinated approach across these different data
sources has multiple advantages. First, given their independent sampling designs, the robustness of
the results and generalisability to the population is likely improved. Second, they have complementary
strengths which aid understanding—birth cohort studies contain prospective SEP data across life,
yielding insight into when in life exposure to disadvantage may affect BP outcomes in adulthood. The
availability of BP measures in midlife in each birth cohort (age 42-46 years) enables sufficiently
powered investigation of how inequalities have changed across time at this key life stage.3 4 30 Whilst

lacking information on early life SEP, use of nationally representative repeated cross-sectional data
enable investigation of how inequalities in BP have changed across all adults and period (annually
from 1994). Consistent with a fundamental cause model of health inequality,31 we hypothesised that
inequalities in BP have persisted across the studied period (1989 to 2016) since there are multiple
likely mediating pathways between SEP and BP, some of which are likely to have stubbornly
persisted over the last two decades (e.g., diabetes and obesity12 19). We also hypothesised that
exposure to disadvantage in both early and adult life would have persisting additive cumulative
associations with higher BP. Finally, we hypothesised that such inequalities would be largest at the
upper tail of the BP distributions, as previously found in the UK and elsewhere for body mass index
(BMI).27

Methods
Study samples
For each dataset, participants gave verbal and/or written consent to be interviewed, visited by a nurse,
and to have BP measurements taken during a home visit. Research ethics approval was obtained from
relevant committees.

Birth cohorts
Britain’s birth cohort studies—followed-up to adulthood—were used. These were designed to be
nationally representative when initiated in 1946 (MRC National Survey of Health and Development32
33

—1946c), 1958 (National Child Development Study34—1958c), and 1970 (British Cohort Study35—

1970c). The history, design, and characteristics of these studies have been previously described in
detail in papers32-36 and books;37 38 studies have also examined the characteristics of those lost due to
attrition.39-42 To aid the comparability of associations between SEP and BP across studies, analyses
were restricted to singleton births in mainland Britain from those born and included in cohorts in the
relevant weeks in March/April 1946c (N=5362), 1958c (N=16 989), and 1970c (N=16 216).
Subsequent migrants included in childhood sweeps of 1958c and 1970c were not included. The
analytic sample sizes were those with valid BP data from age 42–46 years—total N=18 657. Cohortspecific analytic sample sizes (Ns for those who responded but did not have valid BP data are in
parenthesis) are as follows: 1946c: n=3186 (3262); 1958c: n=8610 (8688); 1970c: n=6861 (7793). In
1970c, unlike the other cohorts, nurse visits took place following separate main stage interviews. Age
ranges at BP measurement in midlife were: 1946c: 42–44 (1988-1990; <1% in 1988, thus 1989 is
referred to throughout as the start date of analyses); 1958c: 44–46 (2002-2004); 1970c: 45–48 years
(2015-2018). All analyses using the 1946c were weighted to account for the stratified sampling
design.33 To reduce the potential impact of missing data on statistical power and the potential for
selection bias in longitudinal analyses, missing SEP data for those with valid BP data were replaced
using multiple imputation (n=10 datasets; analyses using imputed data are presented).43

Repeated cross-sectional studies
The Health Survey for England (HSE) is a cross-sectional, general population survey of individuals
living in private households, with a new sample each year randomly selected by address.44 Data
collection occurs throughout the year, via a health interview followed by a nurse visit. Twenty-one
sweeps of the HSE were used for the present analysis spanning 1994 to 2016 (no BP measurements
for participants in the general population sample were available in 1999 or 2004). The percentage of
eligible households taking part in the HSE ranged from 77% in 1994 to 59% in 2016. The analytical
sample included n=129 118 non-pregnant adults aged 25 years and over with valid BP, medication
and education data; 25 was chosen as the lower age limit to avoid bias in the classification of highest
educational attainment (see below). This represented 65% of all adult participants. Our study used the
general population samples only and so selection probabilities were equal. Starting from 2003,
weights have been created to minimise bias from non-response; the relevant weights for analysing BP
data were therefore used from 2003 onwards. Sensitivity analyses suggested no systematic difference
in results for weighted versus unweighted data.

Measurement of blood pressure
Birth cohorts
Trained nurses measured resting BP using a sphygmomanometer following a rest time of 5 minutes.
Specifically, in 1946c BP was measured twice using the Hawksley random zero sphygmomanometer
in the right arm; in 1958c three times using an Omron 705CP BP monitor in the left arm; and in 1970c
three times using an Omron HEM 907 BP monitor in the right arm. To account for differences in
device, as Omron devices provide higher estimates than sphygmomanometers, the 1946c readings
were converted to automated Omron readings via a previously derived formulae.45 Pregnant women
were excluded from BP measurement in the 1958c and 1970c. To aid within-cohort comparability, the
second BP measure was used, or the first if the second was missing. Use of medication was
ascertained in each cohort which was categorized as either BP lowering (1) or not (0); this was

derived using a single item on self-reported use of hypertension medication in 1946c and coded from
medication data in 1958c and 1970c using British National Formulary codes.46

Repeated cross-sectional studies
BP was measured with the use of Dinamap 8100 monitors before 2003, and Omron HEM 907 from
2003 onwards.22 We converted Dinamap readings into Omron readings using a regression equation
based on a calibration study.22 Across all survey years, three BP readings were taken from each
participant in a seated position at 1 minute intervals with use of an appropriately sized cuff on the
right arm if possible after a 5 minute rest. Participants who had exercised, eaten, drunk alcohol, or
smoked in the 30 minutes before measurements were excluded from analyses. The mean of the second
and third readings was used across all survey years. Details of which, if any, classes of
antihypertensive medicines were being taken were recorded by the nurse.

Socioeconomic position ascertainment
Given evidence in a recent meta-analysis for the particular relevance of education for social gradients
in BP,13 and evidence for its potential causal role,7 9 it was the main SEP indicator in this study.
Education for HSE participants was measured as the highest qualification attained (at the time of
interview). For the birth cohort studies, own highest education attainment was ascertained at ages 26
(1946c), 34 (1958c), and 33 (1970c). For both data sources, highest educational attainment at the time
of measurement was categorised into: degree/higher, A levels/diploma, O Levels/GCSEs/Vocational
equivalent, or none. In addition, a comparable indicator of early life (childhood) SEP was used in
analyses of birth cohort data. This was measured by father’s social class at age 4 in 1946c (occupation
at birth was not used to avoid WWII-related misclassification), and at birth in 1958c and 1970c. Data
at 10/11 years was used if missing at the earlier age. The Registrar General’s Social Class scale was
used with categories as follows— I (professional), II (managerial and technical), IIIN (skilled nonmanual), IIIM (skilled manual), IV (partly-skilled), and V (unskilled) occupations. To examine

cumulative associations (see below), the ridit scores for social class at childhood and own education
were combined into a single score and re-scaled.

Analytical strategy
The analytical sample size was 147 775—those with BP outcomes at age 42-46 years (cohorts) or 25
years and over (HSE). The primary outcome for our study was the continuous level of systolic BP
(SBP). In addition, analyses were repeated for diastolic BP (DBP) and the binary outcome of surveydefined hypertension (SBP≥140mmHg or DBP≥90mmHg or reported use of BP lowering
medication). A constant of 10mmHg (SBP) and 5mmHg (DBP) was added to the observed BP values
amongst those on BP lowering medication to approximate underlying BP (i.e. the BP individuals
would have if they were not on treatment);47 this method has been found to reduce bias in the
estimated effect of key determinants on continuous levels of BP due to the effects of treatment.48

The birth cohort and HSE datasets were analysed separately. Data from each source was analysed
overall (i.e., pooled across cohorts / survey years) as well as separately by birth cohort / survey year.
To provide single quantifications of inequalities in a metric recommended for use in national health
inequality statistics,49 the SEP indicators described above were converted to ridit scores (ranging from
0 to 1). The SEP coefficient in linear regression—the Slope Index of Inequality (SII)—is interpreted
as the estimated absolute (mean) difference (absolute inequality) in BP between the lowest and
highest SEP. For survey-defined hypertension, this forms a linear probability model50—the absolute
difference in the probability of hypertension between the lowest and highest SEP; our findings did not
differ materially when estimated using logistic regression. Use of ridit scores enables comparisons
across birth cohorts and survey years whilst accounting for differences in the proportion of
participants in each SEP category. Given the large age range in the HSE datasets, adjustment was
made for age in all models (entered as a categorical variable via 10-year age bands). No adjustment
was made in the birth cohort datasets as the age differences were small and were co-linear with birth

year. Our regression models were also gender-adjusted, since gender differences in SEP and BP
associations were not anticipated a-priori. Investigation of change across time in the SEP and BP
associations was performed by comparing the magnitude (and 95% Confidence Intervals) of the birth
cohort and survey-year specific estimates.

The life course nature of inequalities in BP: birth cohort analyses
To examine whether SEP across life had cumulative associations with outcomes, analyses in birth
cohorts were conducted before and after mutual adjustment for childhood SEP (father’s social class),
own education, and own social class at 42/46 years; mutual independence of association after
adjustment provides evidence for a cumulative association. In further analyses we used the combined
score for father’s social class and own education in the regression models: a larger effect size for the
combined score versus either in isolation also suggests a cumulative association.

Inequalities across the outcome distribution
To examine if the magnitude of inequalities differed across the BP distributions, conditional quantile
regression was used.51 Quantile regression facilitates estimation of inequalities at a given quantile of
the distribution. Using the same ridit scores as described above, estimates of the SII were obtained
and plotted at the 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th (median), 75th, 90th, and 95th quantiles. To facilitate interpretation
we show the quantile corresponding to the BP threshold for initiating treatment (140mmHg and
90mmHg for SBP and DBP respectively).

Additional and sensitivity analyses
To examine how medication use affected the direction and/or magnitude of inequalities in BP,
associations between education and BP lowering medication use were analysed using linear
probability models, before and after adjustment for SBP (to indicate treatment need). Main analyses
were repeated without adjustment for use of BP lowering medication in order to estimate inequalities

in observed rather than underlying BP. To examine the robustness of associations of early life SEP
with BP—to a different parental respondent and different dimension of disadvantage—maternal
educational status was used instead of father’s social class. This was measured via a binary indicator
of whether the mother had left formal education at the mandatory leaving age (14 years old from
1918, 15 from 1944, and 16 from 1972). To examine whether differences in missing outcome data
may have biased cross birth-cohort study estimates, analyses were repeated using multiple imputation
to additionally impute BP outcomes in the eligible target population (i.e., those alive and who had not
emigrated). Finally, gender-specific analyses were conducted to examine if any change over time in
BP inequalities differed by gender. Likewise, age-specific analyses (25-54, 55+) using the HSE
datasets was conducted to examine if age modified the magnitude of inequalities.

Results
Comparing 2016 with previous years, both cohort and HSE datasets indicated increased higher
educational attainment, more prevalent use of BP lowering medication, and lower mean SBP and
DBP (Table 1; differences in SBP in cohort data were more modest than those observed in HSE).
Cohort data indicated that the percentage of participants with fathers of manual social class decreased
across time (Table 1). The prevalence of outcome missingness in the cohorts, attributable to survey
loss to follow-up, migration, and premature mortality from birth to 42-46 years, was higher in each
subsequent cohort (40.6% in 1946c, 50.1% in 1958c, and 57.7% in 1970c).

Trends across time in socioeconomic inequalities in BP
In both cohort and HSE datasets, lower education was associated with higher SBP (Figure 1). In HSE,
the difference (SII) in SBP based on data pooled across survey years was 4.1mmHg (95% CI: 3.7,
4.5). The magnitude of the social gradient in BP changed little across time. For example, in HSE the
SII in SBP was 3.0mmHg (95% CI: 1.8, 4.2) in 1994 and 4.3mmHg (2.3, 6.3) in 2016. Estimates for
1946c were somewhat smaller than 1958c and 1970c, yet 95% CIs overlapped; Figure 1.
Disadvantaged early life social class was also associated with higher SBP in each cohort, with similar
patterns of association as with education (Figure 1). Findings of persistent inequalities across time in
SBP were similar for DBP, and for survey-defined hypertension (Supplementary Figure 1).

The life course nature of inequalities in BP
More disadvantaged childhood social class and lower own educational attainment were associated
with higher SBP, before and after adjustment for each SEP indicator and own adult social class
(Figure 1). These adjusted associations were weaker in 1946c than subsequent cohorts, yet 95% CIs
overlapped, and as expected, were most precisely estimated in cohort-pooled models (Figure 1, top
row). Associations between the composite score (early life social class and own education) and SBP
yielded higher effect estimates than either in isolation: in a cohort-pooled model, the difference in

SBP was 4.9mmHg (3.7, 6.1) using the composite score yet 3.4mmHg (2.4, 4.4) when considering
education alone, and 3.1mmHg (2.2, 4.0) when considering early life social class alone (Figure 1).
Findings were similar for DBP and survey-defined hypertension (Supplementary Figure 1).

Inequalities across the distribution of BP
In both HSE and birth cohorts, quantile regression analyses revealed SEP differences in SBP and DBP
across the BP distributions—below and above hypertension thresholds. However, the observed mean
differences in SBP and DBP were likely driven by the larger effect sizes at the upper tail of the
distribution (Figure 2). For example, in a cohort-pooled model the mean difference in SBP by
educational attainment was 1.3mmHg (0.1, 2.6) at the 10th quantile, 2.8mmHg (1.7, 3.9) at the
median, and 5.6mmHg (3.4, 7.9) at the 90th quantile (Figure 2). Estimates from pooled HSE analyses
were 2.1mmHg (1.6, 2.6), 3.9mmHg (3.5, 4.3) and 5.6mmHg (4.9, 6.4), respectively. We found
similar results albeit with lower precision when conducted in each birth cohort and HSE dataset
separately; data available upon request.

Additional and sensitivity analyses
Lower education was associated with increased likelihood of using BP lowering medication (before
and after adjustment for measured SBP)—the education related (SII) difference in treatment use after
adjustment for SBP was 3.9 (2.4, 5.2) percentage points in a cohort-pooled model and 4.6 (3.9, 5.3) in
HSE (Supplementary Figure 2). Main findings were similar when not adjusting BP levels for use of
BP lowering medication, yet the magnitude of SEP differences in SBP—as expressed by the SII—was
lower in magnitude in each data source (Supplementary Figure 3). Findings were also similar when
maternal education was used as an indicator of early life SEP instead of father’s social class—in a
birth cohort-pooled model, the SEP difference in SBP according to maternal education was 2.6mmHg
(1.7, 3.6), and 6.1mmHg (4.9, 7.3) in a score combining maternal and own education. Finally,
findings were also similar when imputing cohort SBP data (data available upon request), and when

conducted separately in men and women (Supplementary Figure 4; in HSE, the magnitude of SEP
differences in SBP were larger in females, but the persistence of associations across survey years was
found in both genders). Exploratory analyses in the pooled and year-specific HSE datasets by age
group (25-54, 55+) suggested that age did not modify the magnitude of inequalities (Supplementary

Discussion
Main findings
Using data from three birth cohorts and 21 repeated cross-sectional surveys—with data spanning 1989
to 2016—we found persisting socioeconomic inequalities on the absolute scale in adult SBP, DBP,
and survey-defined hypertension. We also found, using birth cohorts, evidence for persisting
cumulative associations of more disadvantaged SEP across life on these outcomes. Finally, our use of
quantile regression found that average differences in SBP and DBP were driven by SEP differences in
the upper tail of the BP distributions—i.e., higher inequalities amongst those at highest risk.

Comparison with previous findings
Our findings of persistent inequalities in BP extend prior analyses of area-based SEP differences in
high BP using HSE (1994-2008),12 and studies which identified mean differences in BP using 1946c
or 1958c.23-26 Our effect estimates for 1946c were smaller than those previously reported, a finding
which we found attributable to our use of weights to account for the stratified sampling design in this
cohort.33 While a previous study using 1946c concluded that child SEP may be particularly important
for adult SBP (among men),24 it used social class only (not education), and a different statistical
approach. Our co-ordinated analyses found consistent evidence—across 1958c and 1970c and among
both genders—for cumulative associations of early life social class and adult education on BP
outcomes.

A recent meta-analysis suggested that SEP and high BP associations were mainly evident for
associations with educational attainment;13 our findings, using prospectively assessed SEP data across
life, suggests that sizable inequalities exist net of education and adult social class. The magnitude of
inequalities in BP outcomes are therefore underestimated when solely examined using education as a
marker for SEP; this may have implications for future studies which seek to either monitor or reduce
inequalities in BP outcomes.

Explanation of findings
Effective policies to reduce inequalities improve health across all groups but with higher levels of
improvement amongst the disadvantaged groups. The apparent persistence of inequalities observed in
our study suggests that the population-level declines in average levels of BP from 1989 to 2016 (e.g.,
7.7mmHg and 11.8mmHg for SBP and DBP respectively based on HSE data; Table 1) did not
substantially differ by SEP. Multiple policies have been enacted across this period which could have
feasibly affected such inequalities. These include the attempts to standardise and improve the
management of chronic diseases such as BP screening in 2009 (the NHS Cardiovascular Health
Check programme in England for those aged 40-74 years), and the introduction of financial incentives
for UK general practitioners to regularly monitor BP in hypertensive patients in 2004.

Regardless of the impact of each specific policy,52 53 or SEP differences in the management of
hypertension,54 there are multiple reasons why increases in detection and treatment of high BP are
unlikely sufficient to reduce SEP inequalities in BP: 1) treatment is not applicable to those below the
BP thresholds for initiating anti-hypertensive medication, in which SEP differences in BP exist
(Figure 1); 2) amongst adults with hypertension, those of more disadvantaged SEP are likely to have
higher BP levels, such that treatment may not fully normalise BP levels across SEP groups; and 3)
across the studied period, inequalities in other factors that may mediate SEP and BP associations, such
as higher BMI12 19 and unhealthy diets, or are indications for BP lowering treatment, such as diabetes,
have likely stubbornly persisted over the last two decades, and these are expected to lead to
inequalities in BP.7 Consistent with this reasoning, we found that SEP differences in BP were still
present, albeit slightly weaker, when treatment for high BP was not accounted for. Additional
pathways which may persistently link SEP and BP include psychosocial or physiological processes
(e.g., chronic inflammation and stress).55 Both early life and adult SEP appear to have cumulative
independent associations with such determinants (e.g., BMI19) which likely results in cumulative
associations with BP in midlife. Future reductions in BP inequalities are likely to be achieved by

addressing these wider determinants beyond detection and treatment which influence change in the
upper tail of the BP distribution without having a major impact on average levels; these in turn are
likely to require structural changes to address, such as those incentivising lower salt and calorie
contents of foods.56

It is also possible that the persisting BP inequalities found in our study reflect non-causal effects of
SEP. For example, those of lower SEP may be increasingly selected on the basis of ill health or
factors such as cognition which predict worse subsequent health.57 58Such changes may counter-act
other favourable changes which would otherwise reduce the magnitude of the observed SEP
differences in BP. However, to the authors’ knowledge there is little empirical evidence that selection
differs markedly across time—SEP differences in childhood cognition for example appear to have
been similar in 1958c and 1970c.59

Strengths and limitations
Strengths of this study include the use of multiple comparable nationally representative datasets with
complementary advantages. Our co-ordinated analyses of these enabled investigation of long-run
trends in SEP inequalities in BP, the incorporation of data on BP lowering medication, and the use of
multiple indicators of SEP collected in both early and adult life. The use of a single analytical
framework across the 1946c and 1958c, and additionally including the 1970c, improved the available
statistical power and generalisability of our investigation of the life course nature of BP inequalities.
Finally, our use of quantile regression enabled us to move beyond a focus on average levels or binary
outcomes to identify that such inequalities were driven by differences at the upper tail of the BP
distributions.

While we aimed to optimise the comparability of exposure and outcome data, and minimise the
potential impact of missing data (via multiple imputation or weighting), we were unable to fully

exclude the potential that findings, and thus inferences regarding change in the SEP and BP
association across time, are biased due to unobserved predictors of missing data, or unobserved
methodological differences between the studies. A further limitation is that, as in other large-scale
datasets such as UK Biobank, the study samples were largely White; we lacked power to investigate
whether inequalities and their change across time are modified by ethnicity. Finally, while multiple
indicators of SEP were utilised, we were unable to investigate unmeasured aspects of socioeconomic
circumstances which may be particularly important—such as income-related food insecurity or
wealth.

Conclusions
From 1989 to 2016, socioeconomic inequalities in BP appear to have persisted in absolute terms, with
additive associations of early life social class and own education. Indeed, studies examining
inequalities in BP solely using education as a marker for SEP are likely to underestimate lifetime
inequalities in BP outcomes. This persistence likely reflects the net effects of secular increases in
socially patterned drivers of high BP such as higher BMI and diabetes coupled with improved disease
management. Assuming consistent causal relations between SEP and BP, our findings suggest that
prior strategies of reducing socioeconomic inequalities in these outcomes have been insufficiently
effective. Alternative strategies, targeting the wider structural determinants of high BP are likely
required.
