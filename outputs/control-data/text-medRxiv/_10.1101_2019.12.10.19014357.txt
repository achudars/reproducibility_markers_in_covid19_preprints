Abstract

14

Traditionally, subgroup analyses are used to assess whether patient characteristics

15

moderate treatment effectiveness with general disregard for issues of multiplicity. Using data

16

from The Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) trial in the United States, we aim to

17

identify a subgroup where all of its types of members experience a treatment benefit defined

18

as reducing the likelihood of a major cardiovascular event under an intensive lifestyle and

19

weight-loss intervention. We apply the credible subgroups method to a Bayesian logistic

20

model with a conservative prior that is sceptical of large treatment effect heterogeneity. The

21

covariate profiles for which there is sufficient evidence of treatment benefit are, coarsely,

22

middle-aged women, in poor subjective general health and with moderately to poorly

23

controlled diabetes. There is at least 80% posterior probability that the conditional average

24

treatment effect is positive for all covariate profiles fitting this description, which account for

25

0.5% of trial participants. Conversely, the covariate profiles that are likely to be associated

26

with no benefit are middle aged and older men in excellent subjective general health, with

27

well-controlled diabetes. These profiles apply to less than 2% of trial participants. More

28

information is required to determine treatment benefit or no benefit for the remainder of the

29

trial population.

1. Introduction

32

In general, healthcare providers aim to use information about a person to prevent,

33

diagnose and treat disease, or to promote wellness. This relies on the ability to translate

34

results from trials into clinical practice where the quantity of interest is usually the average

35

treatment effect (ATE). The experimental approach to the estimation of average treatment

36

effects involves random assignment of treatment followed by a comparison of the average

37

outcomes of treated to nontreated individuals that serve as controls [1]. However, ATEs only

38

provide a partial explanation of treatment effects particularly when they vary across

39

experimental units.

40

In randomised controlled trials, average treatment effects tend to be generalised to a

41

wider population and as such the results will be taken to apply equally to all patients in the

42

trial. Participants, however, will vary significantly in baseline predictive and prognostic

43

characteristics, and therefore each patient can report a unique effect with respect to a given

44

treatment. This treatment effect heterogeneity can be masked by the calculation of average

45

effects, leaving potential benefiters and non-benefiters of a given treatment unidentified.

46

Producing results on population averages without recognizing the underlying heterogeneity

47

could lead to welfare losses and increases in healthcare inefficiencies and costs [2, 3].

48

The standard approach for investigating treatment effect heterogeneity is to estimate

49

conditional average treatment effects, or treatment effects among homogeneous groupings of

50

experimental units. These homogenous subgroups are defined by baseline covariates. In order

51

to assess how causal effects vary across subgroups, researchers predict conditional average

52

treatment effects (CATEs) which are average effects conditioned on certain values of

53

observed covariates for which treatment effectiveness varies [4]. Conditional average

54

treatment effects are particularly useful when the researcher wants to explore the

55

heterogeneity of treatment effects in various subgroups defined by a single covariate.

56

Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, or systematically different outcomes

57

associated with treatment due to moderating patient characteristics, is typically relegated to

58

subgroup analyses that rely on simple treatment-covariate interaction terms [5]. In clinical

59

trials, however, researchers typically arenâ€™t concerned with just one subgroup but rather

60

subgroups across a series of standard covariates such as age, ethnicity, and sex. Multiple

61

interaction tests can be misleading as they are often underpowered, suffer from multiplicity

62

errors and do not allow for simultaneous inference [6, 7]. Moreover, subgroups tend to be

63

prespecified to avoid perceptions of data-mining or overfitting the data and therefore restrict

64

the ability of the researcher to test new unforeseen hypotheses [8].

65

There is growing recognition in the field of health economics that more nuanced

66

estimates of patient-specific heterogeneous treatment effects can be estimated and

67

conditioned on a variety of observable and unobservable risk factors. Some methods are

68

derived from the computer science discipline such as machine learning methods where the

69

focus is on predicting patient-specific treatment effects [9-11]. Other methods build on a

70

Bayesian framework where the parameter of interest is unknown but the model allows the

71

researcher to vary the degree of expected treatment effect heterogeneity through a priori

72

selection [6, 12, 13]. All of these methods provide insight into the reliability of incorporating

73

heterogeneity in treatment response.

74

Our work builds on a Bayesian framework to classify personalised treatment effects

75

(PTEs), or average outcomes under treatment and control for every covariate point. The PTEs

76

are used to classify covariate points into credible subgroups that allow for inferences about

77

the types of patients expected to benefit or not benefit from an intervention, while accounting

78

for the multiplicity arising from testing a hypothesis at every covariate point. This study is the

79

first major application of the Bayesian credible subgroups method to such a large clinical

80

dataset. Previous research and our own are discussed in the context of a large multicentre

81

randomised controlled trial called the Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD). In the

82

Look AHEAD trial, insignificant treatment effects for the whole sample and all prespecified

83

subgroups were reported, most likely resulting from latent patient heterogeneity [14].

84

In 2001 the Look AHEAD trial set out to model the long-term effects of an intensive

85

lifestyle intervention (ILI), one specifically aimed at weight loss on cardiovascular morbidity

4

86

and mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes who were also overweight or obese [14,

87

15]. The ILI included the following: individual and group counselling sessions on diabetes

88

control, aids for calorie management with the option of meal replacement supplements, and

89

supports to increase physical activity. Patients in the control group received diabetes support

90

and education (DSE) counselling only. Prior to the Look AHEAD trial, the effects of lifestyle

91

interventions on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were mixed at best. Some studies

92

reported no cardiovascular effect and others reported minimal benefits after two decades of

93

follow-up [16-19]. The effects of weight loss on reduced cardiovascular risk factors in the

94

short-run were well-documented, but the Look AHEAD trial set out to identify if significant

95

effects translated to reductions in a primary composite CVD endpoint over a long-term

96

follow-up. In September 2012 the Look AHEAD trial prematurely ended after a futility

97

analysis concluded the weight loss intervention did not reduce the rate of primary

98

cardiovascular events [14]. The median follow-up was 9.6 years. Data are available upon

99

request from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).

100

All participants in Look AHEAD provided written consent to allow their information to be

101

used in future research.

102

A possible explanation for a lack of statistical significance in Look AHEAD was the

103

presence of differing effects for different individuals or patient heterogeneity [14].

104

Secondary analyses were conducted to see if general health benefits resulted from the

105

lifestyle intervention. The documented health benefits range from weight loss, increased

106

physical fitness, better diabetes control, and reduced urinary incontinence [20-22]. A small

107

number of exploratory studies have examined the original CVD endpoint finding positive

108

treatment effects for subgroups defined by subjective general health and diabetes control [23]

109

and percentage weight loss in the first twelve months [20]. Using different methods, these

110

were all attempts to model treatment heterogeneity in Look AHEAD.

111

Behavioural responses and treatment uptake are notoriously heterogeneous with

112

varying degrees of weight loss being reported in the first year [24]. In the instance of the

113

Look AHEAD trial it is likely that patient heterogeneity was able to moderate treatment

114

effectiveness at two entry points: the effect of the intervention on behaviour and uptake, and

115

the effect of behaviour and weight loss on the primary CVD outcome [25]. In Baum et.al.

116

[23] a machine learning algorithm based on decision-trees was used to identify two baseline

117

patient characteristics believed to be instigators behind the trial-wide outcome neutral effects.

118

One covariate was HbA1c, or glycated haemoglobin, which is a measure of diabetes control.

119

The second instigator of treatment effect heterogeneity was a subjective general health

120

indicator derived from the SF-36 questionnaire. These covariates were determined to be the

121

most important variables for defining the range of patient heterogeneity. Defined by HbA1c

122

and subjective general health, two subgroups with positive average treatment effects were

123

identified. However, the HbA1c and subjective general health (SF-36) compositions within

124

these two subgroups were contradictory. One subgroup reported a significant absolute risk

125

reduction defined by the baseline covariates excellent subjective general health (SF-36 â‰¥ 48)

126

and well-controlled diabetes (HbA1c < 6.8%). After participants with an expected adverse

127

treatment response were removed from the analysis, a second subgroup with significant risk

128

reductions was defined by the baseline covariates HbA1c â‰¥ 6.8% or both HbA1c < 6.8% and

129

SF-36 â‰¥ 48. These results led to conclusions stating 85% of Look AHEAD participants

130

averted a cardiovascular event which would be a large overestimation of treatment benefit

131

compared to previous Look AHEAD studies [14, 20, 25, 26]. The mixed composition of these

132

subgroups support previous criticisms stating too much emphasis is placed on the coefficients

133

produced my machine learning algorithms and that they are not designed to collate patients

134

into subgroups. Rather, machine learning methods are better suited for examining unit-level

135

heterogeneity [27].

136

Machine learning methods are useful for detecting and analysing heterogeneity, but

137

they do not directly address the question of primary interest to the current study: specifically

138

whom does treatment benefit? Previously-applied machine learning methods do not adjust for

139

multiplicity or provide simultaneous inferences, defined as a situation where all types of

140

individuals within a subpopulation satisfy a common statement [6]. The most relevant

141

statement here is that all covariate points in the subgroup correspond to a positive PTE. We

142

use a Bayesian credible subgroups method for simultaneous inference that through careful

143

choice of priors on treatment-covariate interactions, allows us to tune our a priori belief in

144

the strength of treatment effect heterogeneity. Our model includes a conservative prior that is

145

sceptical of large treatment effect heterogeneity but still allows for strong evidence from the

146

posterior distribution to overwhelm the prior information.

147

The inferential goal of this analysis is different from previous secondary Look

148

AHEAD studies that confirm the overall treatment effect is neutral and any subsequently

149

identified subgroups are defined by estimated average treatment effects. These estimates

150

continue to apply assumptions of treatment effect homogeneity within all levels of selected

151

covariates. Instead, we aim to capitalise on inherent patient heterogeneity in order to identify

152

the subgroup consisting of only types of patients expected to benefit, not a subgroup of any

153

types patients that together yield a positive average effect. We explore the mechanisms

154

behind the statistical insignificance of the lifestyle intervention. This is done by examining

155

the possibility of a treatment-benefiting subgroup defined by the baseline covariates sex, age,

156

blood glucose percentage (HbA1c) and a measure of subjective general health (SF-36).

varying credible levels. Section 5 concludes with a discussion and suggestions for future

161

163

2. Methodology

164

Data provided by the NIDDK repository was fully anonymised before we accessed

165

them. Our research received ethical approval from University of Limerick application number

166

2017_12_19_EHS. All participants in Look AHEAD provided written consent to allow their

167

information to be used in future research.

168

This analysis uses the Bayesian credible subgroups method to construct two bounding

169

subgroups for a benefiting subgroup B that is unknown. The benefiting subgroup is defined to

170

consist of all covariate profiles with a conditional average treatment effect above a threshold

171

set to zero (  0, intended to capture all positive treatment effects regardless of magnitude.

172

Inferences about the subgroup B are made by constructing bounding subgroups, D and S,

173

similar to the procedure for making inferences about a scalar quantity by constructing interval

174

estimates. The bounding subgroups are constructed with the goal that one, the exclusive

175

credible subgroup (D), contains only covariate profiles with a positive treatment effect. The

176

other, the inclusive credible subgroup (S), is intended to contain all covariate profiles with a

177

positive treatment effect. In the construction of these bounds, treatment effects are estimated

178

and tested at all points throughout the covariate space, thereby introducing multiple testing

179

issues. However, by estimating a subgroup where all of its members satisfy some criteria,

180

such as having a treatment effect above some threshold of significance, this statement of

181

simultaneity accounts for multiplicity due to performing a hypothesis test at each covariate

182

point. The result is a decreased risk of conducting a family wise type I error.

183

The method of credible subgroups is a two-step regression classification method.

184

Parameters of a linear or non-linear regression model are estimated, and a simultaneous

185

credible band of some level around the regression surface is constructed. Covariate points

186

with a lower bound above some threshold form the exclusive credible subgroup (D), and

187

those where the upper bound is greater than the threshold become the inclusive credible

188

subgroup (S). As an example of the first step, estimation of a standard linear model includes

189

predictive and prognostic covariates generally described as follows:

Y is the response, x and z are vectors of prognostic and predictive covariates where predictive

192

covariates are those interacted with treatment allocation.  and  are the effect parameters

193

and  0,1 the treatment allocation. Additionally, the model includes a conservative prior

194

on  that represents the belief that treatment-covariate interactions are unlikely by shrinking

195

coefficients towards zero, but that still allows for strong evidence of treatment effect

196

heterogeneity from the posterior distribution to overrule this. The second step, classification,

197

comes from the posterior distribution of patientsâ€™ personalised treatment effects (PTEs).

198

These are used to classify all combinations of covariates in the covariate space according to a

199

credible subgroup pair: the exclusive credible subgroup (D) and the inclusive credible

200

subgroup (S). PTEs provide a clinically useful interpretation of the expected difference in

201

outcomes for patients that share the same baseline characteristics.

202

In our analysis the covariate space is comprised of age, sex, subjective general health

203

measured by the SF-36 general health questionnaire, and diabetes control measured a

204

glycated haemoglobin percentage (HbA1c). All of the covariates included in this paper are

205

standard medical and demographic variables included in studies examining behavioural

206

treatments for type 2 diabetes and the confounding effects of obesity [14, 17, 18, 20, 23, 28].

From the posterior distribution of personalised treatment effects the covariate space is divided

The objective of this analysis is to identify a credible subgroup pair such that, at a

3. Data

260

Look AHEAD was a multicentre randomised controlled trial that tested the effect of

261

an intensive lifestyle intervention focused on diet and exercise on long-term cardiovascular

262

disease outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes who were overweight or obese [14,

263

15]. Between August 2001 and April 2004 the trial recruited 5145 participants to undergo

264

randomisation. 2570 were assigned to the intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) group and

265

2575 were assigned to the diabetes support and education control (DSE) group. The

266

intervention was modelled on group behaviour programs tailored for obese and overweight

267

patients through individual and group counselling sessions. These sessions continued for an

268

initial 6 months and decreased in frequency throughout a 12-month follow-up. Intervention

269

design was tailored for a weight-loss goal of losing 10% initial body weight in the first year

270

and a total weight-loss of 7% (or more) initial body weight by trialâ€™s end. This would be

271

achieved by limiting caloric intake with the option of meal replacement supplements and

272

increasing physical fitness through weekly exercise regimes. The diabetes support and

273

education (DSE) control group provided nutrition and exercise training for a period of four

274

years after randomisation.

275

The primary outcome was a composite indicator of CVD morbidity and mortality

276

consisting of CVD death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke, and

277

hospitalization for angina [14]. The number of CVD events was a concern throughout the

278

trial resulting in the fourth CVD indicator, hospitalisation from angina, being added to the

280

being less than half the projected rate in the DSE control group, resulting in a very low

281

overall rate of events [14]. Insignificant treatment effects were reported for secondary CVD

282

composite measures and for all prespecified subgroups including age, sex and ethnicity.

4. Results

296

The credible subgroups method is used to divide the covariate space into a trichotomy

297

which will identify the profiles of patients expected to benefit from treatment, those expected

298

not to benefit from treatment and those for whom more information is needed. The Look

299

AHEAD trial is used in our analysis and includes an experimental intensive lifestyle

300

intervention (ILI) versus a diabetes support and education (DSE) control. The covariates are

301

believed to be both prognostic and predictive and are defined by baseline measurements for

302

subjective general health measured by the SF-36 questionnaire, age, sex and diabetes control

303

(HbA1c). The endpoint of interest is a binary composite indicator measuring the presence of

304

four possible macro cardiovascular events.

305

The first stage of the credible subgroups method is the estimation of a Bayesian

306

logistic regression with vague priors on prognostic effects and conservative priors on

307

predictive effects. From this stage our objective is to discuss treatment-covariate interactions

308

at the nominal credible level of 95% for which standard subgroup analyses were not powered

309

to detect. The model is fit with 10,000 Gibbs sampler iterations after 1000 burn-in iterations.

310

The posterior mean, standard deviations and credible bounds of effect parameters are

311

reported in Table 2. Significant effects are reported for the treatment-control interaction and

312

individual covariates general health and HbA1c. These results are not adjusted for multiplicity

313

and are considered incomplete because a lack of significance on the age and sex interaction

314

terms does not imply a homogeneous treatment effect across all levels of these covariates.

315

The estimates in Table 2 do not identify the covariate profiles of patients explicitly expected

316

to benefit and therefore do not directly address our research question. The interpretation that

317

we wish to avoid is that the treatment only interacts with general health and HbA1c and that

318

any potential treatment effect exists across all levels of the other covariates.

induce the curved boundaries of the credible subgroup [6]. The covariate profiles classified to

332

the exclusive credible subgroup D are middle-aged women in poor subjective general health

333

with moderately to poorly controlled diabetes. There is at least 80% posterior probability that

334

the conditional average treatment effect is beneficial  3 0 for all types of patients with

335

covariate points in D, accounting for multiplicity due to testing a hypothesis for each

336

covariate point, and thus promoting the lifestyle intervention as an appropriate treatment for

337

this subgroup. Conversely, the S-complement subgroup identifies the covariate profiles of

338

those who may not benefit, represented by either a null or adverse treatment effect ( " 0).

339

The covariate profiles of patients in this region are middle-aged and older men, in excellent

340

subjective general health with well-controlled diabetes. Therefore, the lifestyle intervention is

341

not to be considered an appropriate treatment for members of this subgroup. A figure of

342

similar threshold and credible level with a vague prior on predictive and prognostic effects is

included in the Supplement S_Fig1. This figure supports the conclusions presented in Table

356

the idea that the heterogeneity of patients with these covariate profiles could have been lost in

357

the original trial-wide average estimates. When applying the trichotomy of the covariate

space to 4893 observations in the Look AHEAD trial, there is sufficient evidence of benefit

359

for less than 0.5% of the Look AHEAD population. Likewise, there is sufficient evidence of

360

an expected null or adverse effect for less than 2% of the trial population.

level is included in the Supplement S_Fig2. As expected, when the credible level is relaxed,

379

the proportion of covariate points allocated to the exclusive credible subgroup (D) and S-

380

complement subgroup (Sc) increase. As the credible level is relaxed, the covariate

381

composition of the exclusive credible subgroup widens to include both men and women for a

382

wider range of ages. The two most important covariates for differentiating patient benefiters

383

from non-benefiters are having a low HbA1c percentage and having good subjective general

384

health. The similarity between these two covariates is to be expected as good control over

385

oneâ€™s diabetes, which is a physical health indicator, could translate to patientsâ€™ positive

386

subjective evaluations of their own health. This conclusion supports previous research that

387

has found HbA1c and subjective general health (SF-36) are two of the most important

388

covariates for determining treatment effect heterogeneity in the Look AHEAD trial [23]. The

389

HbA1c composition of the exclusive and inclusive credible subgroups is largely consistent

390

across sex, age and general health covariates.

391

At the 80% credible level, the application of the covariate profiles of the exclusive

392

credible subgroup, suggests evidence of treatment benefit for less than 0.5% of the Look

393

AHEAD population. Applying the covariates that constitute the S-complement subgroup

394

suggests evidence of a null or adverse treatment effect for 2% of the Look AHEAD

395

population. At the more lenient 50% credible level, the application of the covariate profiles of

396

the exclusive credible subgroup would render a subpopulation of less than 10% of the Look

397

AHEAD trial. While the true benefiting population may be larger, the expansive inconclusive

398

region across two credible levels does not provide supporting evidence of this. Our results

399

across all credible levels differ from previous controversial findings that suggested as much

400

as 85% of the Look AHEAD population benefitted from the ILI based on positive average

401

estimates [23].

5. Discussion

406

In this analysis of the Look AHEAD trial, we identified a subgroup that benefited

407

from an intense behavioural lifestyle intervention in terms of reduced cardiovascular risk.

408

The aim of the trial was to model the effects of a lifestyle intervention that focused on

409

weight-loss and physical activity on the long-term cardiovascular outcomes of patients with

410

type 2 diabetes who were overweight or obese. After the original trial reported no between

411

group differences in the occurrence of the primary CVD endpoint for patients randomised to

412

the treatment or control, commentators suggested this was the result of latent patient

413

heterogeneity. Recent developments in treatment effect estimation call for a move away from

414

ad hoc subgroup analyses and encourage the development of new methodologies designed to

415

capture the richness that patient heterogeneity provides. By fitting a Bayesian logistic

416

regression model, we were able to include prior information of the degree of treatment effect

417

heterogeneity and still allow for strong evidence from the posterior distribution to overrule

418

any assumptions. Using the credible subgroups method, we classified covariate profiles

419

according to a credible subgroup pair that allowed for the identification of a subgroup in

420

which all types of patients exhibit a positive treatment effect. This subgroup was coarsely

421

comprised of the following covariate profiles: middle-aged women in poor subjective general

422

health with moderately to poorly controlled diabetes HbAà¬µà­¡ " 6.5%. There exists at least

423

80% posterior probability that the treatment effect is positive for patients with these covariate

424

profiles located within the exclusive credible subgroup (D), accounting for multiplicity due to

425

testing a hypothesis for each covariate point. A second subgroup was identified as the S-

426

complement where its members exhibited a null or adverse treatment effect. The covariate

427

profiles of this group were middle-aged and older men, in excellent subjective general health

428

with well-controlled diabetes HbAà¬µà­¡ 3 6.5%. Applying the covariate profiles of the

429

exclusive credible subgroup to the Look AHEAD participants rendered an eligible

430

subpopulation of less than 0.5%. Members of this subpopulation would be expected to

431

experience a positive treatment effect.

432

The covariate composition of the exclusive credible subgroup is consistent with

433

studies from similar trials that reported women and those in poor health experienced the

434

greatest reduction in CVD mortality after participating in a weight loss intervention [17, 33,

435

34]. Additionally, the identification of a S-complement group supports previous findings that

436

a selection of patients can have null or adverse cardiovascular responses to weight loss

437

interventions [20, 34]. In our analysis, as the credible levels were relaxed, the covariates poor

438

subjective general health and poorly controlled diabetes were consistently the ones to have an

439

expected treatment benefit while the covariates good subjective general health with well-

440

controlled diabetes had an expected null or adverse treatment effect.

441

The innovation of this paper firstly comes from the inferences made possible by the

442

credible subgroups method: that there is a high posterior probability that all types of patients

443

within the exclusive credible subgroup D experience a positive treatment effect. This

444

addresses a different research question to previous publications that have explored patient

445

heterogeneity but relied on sample average calculations. Our findings compared to those

446

previous demonstrate that it is possible to calculate average estimates that do not capture the

447

responses of minority subgroups with treatment effects that deviate from the mean. Secondly,

448

the credible subgroups method allows us to make statements of simultaneity where all

449

subgroup members experience a treatment effect above some threshold that adjusts for issues

450

of multiplicity due to hypothesis tests in multiple subgroups. This helps to avoid the

451

perception of data dredging which underpins prevalent scepticism of standard subgroup

452

analyses.

453

Previous research has used exploratory endpoints and ad hoc subgroup analysis to

454

identify significant treatment effects reported in secondary studies. Using the original CVD

455

endpoint, our analysis shows that as the credible level is relaxed, the range of the covariate

456

profiles for exclusive subgroup membership expands. There exists a trade-off between

457

statistical confidence and subgroups too narrowly defined to represent any application in

458

medical care. As the credible level is relaxed from 80% to 50%, the proportion of covariate

459

points classified to the exclusive credible subgroup increases. Our research identifies a

460

minority subgroup consisting of covariate profiles with an expected treatment benefit. Based

461

on an 80% credible level, these covariate profiles are used to classify less than 0.5% of the

462

Look AHEAD trial who would simultaneously be expected to experience a positive treatment

463

effect. This contradicts previous research stating 85% of Look AHEAD participants did

464

benefit from treatment as identified by positive average estimates [23].

465

The findings of this secondary analysis are not meant to overshadow the conclusions

466

from the original Look AHEAD trial. Rather, we demonstrate an alternative method of

467

exploring treatment effect heterogeneity that does not suffer from the limitations of standard

468

subgroup analyses. The credible subgroups method defines subgroups, based on a number of

469

baseline covariates, which consist of all the types of patients expected to benefit or not

470

benefit from a given treatment while accounting for multiplicity. This research applies the

471

credible subgroups method to the Look AHEAD trial to illustrate the trichotomy of the

472

covariate space and identifies a large number of covariate points located in an uncertainty

473

region. This combined with the restrictive covariate profiles of those who would be classified

474

to the exclusive credible subgroup, explains how so few patients with an expected treatment

475

benefit could have been lost in trial-wide average estimates.

476

This analysis of the Look AHEAD trial has some limitations. At first glance the

477

output from the credible subgroups method may not be as straightforward to interpret

478

compared to standard subgroup analyses, but the fundamental objective of identifying

479

individual covariate profiles of patients expected to benefit cannot be achieved through

480

simple average calculations. Secondly, the credible subgroups method is not designed for

481

variable selection. Instead, the credible subgroups method requires a list of covariates

482

believed to have predictive value when interacted with treatment which requires a priori

483

knowledge of intervening factors. Thirdly, the credible subgroups method computationally

484

struggles with increasing covariates due to a reduction in statistical power and the inclusion

485

of many continuous covariates [6]. The possible biases produced by these limitations are

486

similar to those found in standard subgroup analyses. Regarding the biological plausibility of

487

the chosen covariates in particular, all are standard medical and demographic variables in

488

studies examining behavioural treatments for type 2 diabetes and the confounding effects of

489

obesity [14, 17, 18, 20, 23, 28]. We conclude that covariates previously identified as being

490

important for exploring treatment heterogeneity may only explain a small portion of the

491

entire covariate space that is useful for identifying positive treatment effects. In fact, variable

492

selection itself introduces multiplicity problems, and accounting for this source of

493

multiplicity as well would necessitate even more cautious conclusions. In particular, the

494

inconclusive region (D \ S) would need to be enlarged for any given credible level. Some

495

study of variable selection via Stochastic Search Variable Selection (SSVS) within the

496

regression step of the credible subgroups approach has been done [35], which shows this

497

effect in the sense that D \ S is larger when not conditioning on a selected model. As this

498

relates to the comparison with Baum et.al. [23], we have shown that accounting for only

499

some but not all sources of multiplicity does not allow as optimistic conclusions as the

500

previous analysis. This result would be made even more extreme by accounting for additional

22

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.10.19014357; this version posted December 14, 2019. The copyright holder for this

501

sources of multiplicity. Finally, point estimates for treatment effects in the selected subgroups

502

D and S-complement are biased away from zero due to selection bias. Thus conclusions

503

drawn from the credible subgroups method should be limited to hypothesis testing, and plots

504

such as Figure 3 should be interpreted only as diagnostics and not as post-selection effect

505

estimates.

506

There exists much scope for future research in the synergy of the credible subgroups

507

method into adaptive enrichment trial design. The objectives of adaptive trial design and the

508

credible subgroups method are the same: to increase the likelihood of identifying a true

509

subgroup of patients expected to benefit from a given therapy [36]. Adaptive trial design

510

includes prospectively planned analyses that can change the course of an on-going trial based

511

on accumulating the data of subjects within the trial [37]. Adaptive trial design stands to

512

benefit from the credible subgroups method if used throughout interim analyses and at early

513

stage enrolee selection. Sequential trial design permits stopping early for efficacy based on

514

interim analyses [38, 39], which could be defined by the trichotomy of the covariate space

515

using the credible subgroups method. Overwhelming evidence of treatment benefit or harm

516

would allow for early termination while the trial would continue to gain information about

517

the covariate space where classifications are uncertain. Additionally, the credible subgroups

518

method could be used in an adaptive population-enrichment design where biomarkers are

519

identified that would predict response or lack of response to a given therapy [40]. This

520

information could be used in confirmatory trials to limit entry of patients to stage 3

521

randomisation [41]. In this research, biomarkers for diabetes and obesity that are related to

522

the effectiveness of the lifestyle intervention would be of particular interest. Future

523

incorporation of the credible subgroups method into adaptive enrichment trail design can

524

magnify the potential treatment effect, reduce costs and increase trial efficiency.
