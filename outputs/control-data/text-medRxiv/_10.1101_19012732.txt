Abstract

27

Introduction: Chlorhexidine gluconate and mupirocin are widely used to decolonize patients

28

with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and reduce risks of infection in

29

hospitalized populations. The probability that a treated patient would be decolonized, which

30

we term per-application effectiveness, is difficult to directly measure. Quantifying the efficacy

31

of per-application effectiveness of CHG and mupirocin is important for studies evaluating

32

alternative decolonization strategies or schedules as well as identifying whether there is room

33

for improved decolonizing agents.

34
35

Methods: Using a stochastic compartmental model of an intensive care unit (ICU), the per-

36

application effectiveness of chlorhexidine and mupirocin were estimated using approximate

37

Bayesian computation. Extended sensitivity analysis examined the potential impact of a latent

38

period between MRSA colonization and detection, the timing of decolonization administration,

39

and parameter uncertainty.

40
41

Results: The estimated per-application effectiveness of chlorhexidine was 0.15 (95% Credible

42

Interval: 0.01, 0.42), while the estimated effectiveness of mupirocin was is 0.15 (95% CI: 0.01,

43

0.54). A lag in colonization detection markedly reduced both estimates, which were particularly

44

sensitive to the value to the modeled contact rate between nurses and patients. Gaps longer

45

than 24-hours in the administration of decolonizing agents still resulted in substantial reduction

46

of within-ICU MRSA transmission.

47
48

Discussion: The per-application effectiveness estimates for chlorhexidine and mupirocin suggest

49

there is room for substantial improvement in anti-MRSA disinfectants, either in the compounds

50

themselves, or in their delivery mechanism. Despite these estimates, these agents are robust to

51

delays in administration, which may help in alleviating concerns over patient comfort or

52

toxicity.

Introduction

56

Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus

57

aureus (MRSA) in hospitals1, it remains a targeted pathogen for infection prevention and public

58

health efforts. One intervention with increasingly widespread use is decolonization of patients

59

with MRSA using chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) baths for the skin and mupirocin for the nares.

60

While these interventions have shown to be effective in a number of randomized controlled

61

trials2, the results from some community-based studies have been more equivocal3. There are

62

several possible explanations for this discrepancy. The results from the randomized trials may

63

not generalize well to settings with lower MRSA incidence. Similarly, lower-incidence settings

64

may not be sufficiently powered to detect an effect of implementing decolonization programs.

65

Finally, there may be changes in implementation from the trial setting to everyday use that

66

decreases the overall effect of the intervention. Thus, infection prevention programs

67

considering these strategies in lower incidence settings must justify the cost of the

68

decolonization products and implementation effort in their hospitals. A better understanding of

69

effectiveness on the per patient application level may help weigh the implementation costs of

70

these interventions.

71

Evaluating these discrepancies requires a mechanistic understanding of the

72

effectiveness of decolonization – that is, what is the probability, if a patient is treated with a

73

decolonization agent, that they are indeed decolonized? This estimate is essential for a number

74

of potential uses: cost-effectiveness studies, quantifying the impact of a decolonization

75

protocol in conjunction with other interventions, or studying the future impact of changes in

76

effectiveness, due to new technology, emerging resistance to decolonizing agents, or other

77

factors. Obtaining such an estimate empirically, especially in a community setting, would be

78

difficult, requiring intensive and repeated sampling of patients with already complicated clinical

79

cases. Rather than directly measuring the probability of successful decolonization, a

80

mathematical modeling approach can define what probability best supports the results seen in

81

the clinical trials – and with what degree of certainty.

The aim of this mathematical modeling study was to estimate the per-application

83

effectiveness of both CHG bathing and CHG bathing in conjunction with mupirocin

84

decolonization of the nares.

Methods

87

MRSA Transmission Model

88

We adapted a previously published stochastic compartmental model 4,5 of transmission

89

of MRSA through an ICU. The model included compartments for patient colonization status and

90

the presence or absence of contamination on the hands or clothing of healthcare workers

91

(HCWs). Patients were modeled as being either presently uncolonized (PU) or colonized (PC).

92

were modeled as being either presently uncolonized (PU) or colonized (PC), while HCWs were

93

modeled as being either uncontaminated (SU) or contaminated (SC). The model assumed that

94

transmission occurred when a contaminated HCW came into contact with an uncolonized

95

patient, and contamination occurred when an uncontaminated HCW came into contact with a

96

colonized patient (Figure 1). As there is considerable evidence that MRSA can be spread via

97

surface-contamination as well as direct contact6, we modeled contact between a patient and an

98

HCW as a direct care task7,8 involving either interaction with a patient or their immediate

99

surroundings.

100

We simulated an 18-bed closed ICU assumed to be at maximum capacity, with a 1:3

101

nurse:patient ratio and a single dedicated intensivist. Because an intensive care unit is a highly

102

structured population, this model relaxes the random mixing assumption used in many

103

compartmental models, instead sub-dividing the patient population such that each patient is

104

cared for by a single nurse and that nurse exclusively cares for three patients. While this is a

105

simplification of the structure of an ICU, previous work has shown it to be a more conservative

106

assumption when compared to random mixing4. The intensivist was assumed to treat all

107

patients (Figure 2).

108

This model makes several simplifying assumptions intended to largely mimic the

109

environment of a hospital with no major outstanding failings in their infection control program.

110

Patients were assumed to be homogeneous in their risk of MRSA acquisition, and the contact

111

frequency between HCWs and patients, while non-random, was uniform (i.e. there are no

112

particularly difficult or contact-intensive patients). Patients were assumed to not interact with

113

each other directly and to be assigned to single-occupancy rooms. Hospitals were assumed to

114

follow standard contact precaution guidelines set forward by the CDC and to detect MRSA

115

colonization with perfect accuracy. Finally, all HCWs were assumed to wash their hands after

116

each direct care task and to change their gloves and/or gowns at a rate equal to when entering

117

and exiting the patient room. These assumptions are intended to largely mimic the

118

environment of a hospital with no major outstanding failings in their infection control program.

119
120
121

Parameterization and Model Calibration
The model largely used parameter values from a previously published model4,5. The

122

values of each parameter in the model, and the source they were drawn from, are detailed in

123

Table 1. The stochastic reaction equations that govern the model and code necessary to run the

124

simulations are available at https://github.com/epimodels/chg_effectiveness. The transition

125

terms are provided in Supplemental Appendix A. Where possible, parameters were drawn from

126

studies from large academic medical centers similar to the ones conducting large RCTs on

127

decolonization protocols.

129

Decolonization Intervention Efficacy Estimation

130

In order to estimate the per-application effectiveness of a CHG and/or a CHG-Mupirocin

131

combination intervention, we used a three-step fitting procedure: baseline, intervention 1 (CHG

132

baths), and intervention 2 (CHG baths plus nasal mupirocin). First, a baseline model of a pre-

133

intervention intensive care unit was fit using a single free parameter, y, that governs the

134

probability an uncolonized patient becomes colonized after contact with contaminated

135

healthcare worker. This parameter was tuned such that the model had an average incidence of

136

5.89 MRSA acquisitions per 1000 patient-days5,9. Second, we introduced a new parameter, d, to

137

represent CHG-based decolonization, when a patient moved patients from a colonized status to

138

an uncolonized status (Intervention 1). This parameter was assumed to result in a 0.748

139

incidence rate ratio compared to the baseline model, in line with a meta-analysis of CHG-only

140

studies by Kim et al2. Third, a second parameter which moved patients from colonized to

141

uncolonized, z, was fit to represent the addition of nasal decolonization with mupirocin

142

accompanying a CHG bathing protocol (Intervention 2), resulting in a combined incident rate

143

ratio of 0.578. This formulation assumes that the effects of CHG and mupirocin are additive and

144

that there is no synergistic effect between them.

145

Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) was used to fit these parameters. Details on

146

ABC for model fitting may be found elsewhere10,11. Briefly, ABC is a computational technique

147

that draws a candidate value from a prior distribution, simulates the model using that value,

148

and accepts the candidate value if the simulated result is within an error band around a given

149

summary statistic. In this case, we fit the model to incidence rates corresponding to the

150

baseline and the two simulated interventions. The distribution of these accepted values is an

151

approximation of a Bayesian posterior. In this study, all parameters were fit using 1,000,000

152

parameter draws from a uniform prior distribution bounded by 0.0 and 1.0. Candidate

153

parameters were accepted with an error term, e = 0.05, indicating that the simulated incidence

154

rates had to be within ± 5% of the target incidence rate on the log scale.

155
156

Sensitivity Analysis

157

Three separate sensitivity analyses were conducted. The first varied the frequency with

158

which decolonization was applied, comparing a baseline of no decolonization to applications of

159

CHG and mupirocin every 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours to see if a substantial portion of the

160

modeled efficacy is dependent on the typical schedule of a daily CHG bath.

161

The second was a global sensitivity analysis, simultaneously allowing each parameter to

162

vary uniformly ± 50% of its original value. For each parameter draw, 200 model runs were

163

performed and the joint efficacy of CHG and mupirocin (as a single parameter) was re-

164

estimated. This process was repeated 5,000 times, and linear regression was used to estimate

165

the relative impact of a single percentage change in each parameter value on the estimated

166

efficacy.

167
168

Finally, we conducted a structural sensitivity analysis examining the impact of assuming
– as our model did – that there is no latent period in MRSA colonization, wherein a patient is

169

colonized at sub-detectable levels. We added a latent period to our model, wherein patients

170

transitioned from Ps to a new compartment, PE – representing latent colonization–before finally

171

transitioning to the Pc colonized state. The rate of transition from PE to Pc varied randomly from

172

one to four days12. Patients in PE were assumed not to shed sufficient amounts of MRSA to

173

contaminate healthcare workers. Effectively, this creates a small pool of patients who, despite

174

being decolonized due to treatment, are not recognized as such, as their MRSA acquisition has

175

not yet been detected. The per-application efficacy of CHG and mupirocin were then re-

176

estimated using the same procedures as the main model.

177
178

Results

179

Per-Application Efficacy of CHG Bathing and CHG-Mupirocin Combinations

180

The estimated per-application efficacy of CHG bathing to induce colonization rates

181

similar to those seen in Kim et al. was 0.15 (95% Credible Interval (CI): 0.01, 0.42), meaning a

182

little under a sixth of all applications of CHG are expected to result in effective decolonization of

183

the patient. Mupirocin had an estimated per-application effectiveness of 0.15 (95% CI: 0.01,

184

0.54). The posterior densities of the efficacy estimates are shown in Figure 3. The addition of a

185

1 to 4-day latent period in between the transmission event and recognized MRSA colonization

186

reduced both efficacy estimates. In this case, CHG and Mupirocin had estimated per-application

187

efficacies of 0.11 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.30) and 0.10 (0.004, 0.34) respectively (Figure 3).

188
189
190

Model Sensitivity to Variation in Timing and Parameter Uncertainty
Despite this relatively modest per-application efficacy estimate, the results of the timing

191

sensitivity analysis showed that substantial decreases in MRSA acquisitions can be achieved at

192

much less frequent bathing intervals. Compared to a mean of 1.23 acquisitions per 1,000

193

patient-days in the control scenarios, a bathing protocol administering CHG and mupirocin

194

every 120 hours (5 days) resulted in a mean acquisition rate of 1.03 acquisitions per 1,000

195

patient days, a 16.3% decrease (p > 0.001) (Figure 4).

196
197

The model’s results were most sensitive to the value of 𝜌" , the contact rate between
nurses and patients. A 1% increase in the value of this parameter corresponded to a 0.73%

198

increase in the estimated combined efficacy of CHG and mupirocin (95% CI: 0.71, 0.75). Other

199

sensitive parameters included y, the probability of colonization given contact between a

200

contaminated HCW and a patient (0.43% (95% CI: 0.41, 0.44) and n, the proportion of

201

admissions colonized with MRSA (0.37% (95% CI: 0.35, 0.39). The sensitivity estimates for all

202

varied parameters is shown in Figure 5.

203
204
205

Discussion
Using a mathematical model to translate from population-level effect estimates to a

206

per-application effectiveness estimate, this study suggests that on a per-application basis both

207

CHG and mupirocin are at best mildly effective at decolonizing patients with MRSA. Under ideal

208

circumstances, the combination of the two compounds was estimated to be effective 30% of

209

the time. Under more realistic circumstances where there is some delay and uncertainty

210

between the acquisition and detection of MRSA, either due to biological processes surrounding

211

colonization or laboratory testing, this estimate drops dramatically to 20%.

212

These results should not be taken as a condemnation of the utility of CHG as an option

213

for reducing the transmission of MRSA within hospitals. Rather, it illustrates that even relatively

214

imperfect interventions may still have impact. Further, it suggests that there may be room for

215

substantial further gains by improving the methods by which we decolonize patients.

216

Importantly, this model cannot distinguish whether or not the effectiveness of CHG and

217

mupirocin are due to the compounds themselves or the way in which they are applied. This

218

means that, even in the absence of novel compounds, improvements to the methods of

219

applying CHG and mupirocin may reap considerable benefits13,14.

220

The results of the timing-focused sensitivity analysis show that considerable deviations

221

from an intensive 24-hour decolonization schedule can still result in substantial reductions in

222

the unit-level MRSA acquisition rate. Most healthcare-associated pathogens have relatively low

223

transmissibility15–17, and as such any reduction in the colonization pressure within an ICU, even

224

a modest one, can interrupt delicate transmission chains. This study suggests that deviations

225

from a daily CHG bathing schedule due to concerns over toxicity in pediatric populations,

226

patient-reported skin irritation, or other practical demands are still potentially useful

227

interventions. These results are also potentially useful for future studies, allowing facilities to

228

estimate the expected impact in their specific settings, allowing for the critical evaluation of

229

existing studies, and providing clear estimates that can be used to estimate the impact of

230

resistance to CHG, mupirocin, or both.

231

This study is not without limitations. Broadly, it assumes that the ICU represented in the

232

model, which is meant to represent the type of academic medical center where large-scale

233

intervention trials are most often conducted, is a reasonable representation of the environment

234

in which the studies were actually conducted. The parameter sensitivity analysis shows that the

235

model is most sensitive to errors in the contact rate between nurses and patients. Further, like

236

the meta-analysis by Kim et al. that was used to calibrate the model and estimate the per-

237

application effectiveness of CHG and mupirocin, this study assumes that the studies in question,

238

a mix of randomized trials and interrupted time-series studies, were capable of estimating the

239

population-level impact of decolonization without bias. Additionally, this model assumes there

240

is no cumulative benefits to repeated bathing – each application is treated as a separate and

241

independent event.

242

Despite these limitations, this study represents an innovative use of mathematical

243

modeling to estimate the effectiveness of a hospital epidemiology intervention using summary

244

statistics to estimate an individual-level effect. In particular, estimating the per-application

245

efficacy of these compounds would be difficult, if not impossible, to directly measure in a

246

working healthcare setting. It shows that there are still substantial prospects for improved

247

decolonization interventions to further reduce MRSA rates in the ICU, and that there is room

248

for deviation from intensive daily protocols in response to patient or clinician needs without

249

overly jeopardizing their impact.

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the compartmental flow of a mathematical model of
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) acquisition and CHG/mupirocin
decolonization. Solid arrows indicate possible transition states, while dashed arrows indicate
potential routes of MRSA contamination or colonization. Nurses and doctors are classified as
uncontaminated (NU or DU) and contaminated (NC and DC), while patients are classified as
uncolonized (PU) or colonized (PC). Figure by Eric Lofgren is licensed under CC BY 4.0.

Figure 3. Approximate Bayesian Posterior Estimates for Per-Application Chlorhexidine
Gluconate (delta) and Mupirocin (zeta) Effectiveness. Each panel shows the density of accepted
values (dark line) and the median of this density (dotted line). Densities were estimated using a
normal kernel. Left-hand panels show the estimates assuming acquisition is instantly detected,
while the right-hand panels show the estimates assuming there is a one to four-day latent
period where a patient may be colonized (and decolonized) but their acquisition is not yet
detected.
