Abstract

24

pattern of signs or symptoms to guide targeted genetic testing for confirmation of the

25

diagnosis. However, individuals displaying a few phenotypes of a complex syndrome may

26

not meet criteria for clinical diagnosis or genetic testing. Here, we present a phenome-

27

wide association study (PheWAS) approach to systematically explore pleiotropy of

28

common and rare alleles in genes associated with four well-described syndromic

29

diseases (Alagille (AS), Marfan (MS), DiGeorge (DS), and Noonan (NS) syndromes) in

30

the general population.

31

Using human phenotype ontology (HPO) terms, we systematically mapped 60

32

phenotypes related to AS, MS, DS and NS in 337,198 unrelated white British from the UK

33

Biobank (UKBB) based on their hospital admission records, self-administrated

34

questionnaires, and physiological measurements. We performed logistic regression

35

adjusting for age, sex, and the first 5 genetic principal components, for each phenotype

36

and each variant in the target genes (JAG1, TBX1, FBN1, PTPN11, NOTCH2, and

37

MAP2K1) and performed a gene burden testing.

The clinical evaluation of a genetic syndrome relies upon recognition of a characteristic

38

Overall, we observed multiple phenotype-genotype correlations, such as the

39

association between variation in JAG1, FBN1, PTPN11 and SOS2 with diastolic and

40

systolic blood pressure; and pleiotropy among multiple variants in syndromic genes. For

41

example, rs11066309 in PTPN11 was significantly associated with a lower body mass

42

index, an increased risk of hypothyroidism and a smaller size for gestational age, all in

43

concordance with NS-related phenotypes. Similarly, rs589668 in FBN1 was associated

44

with an increase in body height and blood pressure, and a reduced body fat percentage

45

as observed in Marfan syndrome.

Our findings suggest that the spectrum of associations of common and rare

Author Summary

52

characteristic pattern of signs or symptoms to guide targeted genetic testing for

53

confirmation of the diagnosis. This may lead to missing diagnoses in patients with silent

54

or a low expressed form of the syndrome. Here we take advantage of a rich electronic

55

health record, various phenotypic measurements, and genetic information in 337,198

56

unrelated white British from the UKBB, to study the relation between single syndromic

57

disease phenotypes and genes related to syndromic disease. We show multiple

58

phenotype-genotypes associations in concordance with phenotypes variations found in

59

syndromic diseases. For example, we show that mutation in FBN1 was associated with

60

high standing/sitting height ratio and reduced body fat percentage as observed in

61

individuals with Marfan syndrome. Our findings suggest that common and rare alleles in

62

SD genes are causative of individual component phenotypes present in a general

63

population; further research is needed to characterize the pleiotropic effect of alleles in

64

syndromic genes in persons without the syndromic disease.

Introduction

68

of phenotypes across multiple organ systems. The era of next-generation sequencing has

69

enabled substantial progress in linking syndromic disease to specific genetic loci, coupled

70

with public databases of genotype-phenotype relationships to facilitate the classification

71

of genetic variants from “benign” to “pathogenic” for use in clinical decision making. Large

72

population-scale databases of genetic variation without phenotypes, such as ExAC, have

73

provided additional context for characterizing genotype-phenotype relationships in

74

genetic disease[1]. For mutations previously thought to cause disease, population

75

databases have often suggested lower estimates of penetrance than initially

76

recognized[2,3].

Genetic syndromes are rare diseases defined by a specific and clinically recognizable set

77
78

The diagnosis or classification of an individual with genetic syndrome relies upon expert

79

recognition of a characteristic pattern of signs or symptoms or a set of defined diagnostic

80

criteria. However, individuals displaying single phenotypes of a complex syndrome may

81

not meet criteria for clinical diagnosis or genetic testing; expanding a binary definition of

82

syndromic phenotypes to phenotype scores can identify more individuals with Mendelian

83

disease patterns[4]. Similarly, individuals with clearly pathogenic mutations may be

84

affected with only a single component phenotype of a genetic syndrome[5,6]. Recent

85

descriptions of allelic heterogeneity, penetrance, and expressivity in syndromic disease

86

genes have focused almost exclusively upon rare or familial alleles[7,8].

87
88

Here, we present a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) approach to

89

systematically explore pleiotropy of common and rare alleles in genes associated with

four well-described syndromic diseases in the general population. Using the UK Biobank,

91

we linked individual-level medical and morphometric data to the characteristic phenotypes

92

of Alagille (AS), Marfan (MS), DiGeorge (DS), and Noonan (NS) syndromes. These data

93

allow a survey of the association of common and rare alleles to single component

94

phenotypes of each syndrome within the general (non-syndromic) population.

Results

98

using medical literature and other ontology-based systems[9] – we identified 196 HPO

99

terms related to AS, MF, DS, and NS. Of these 196 HPO terms, 53 were shared between

100

at least two syndromes, and seven terms were included in all four syndromes (S1 Table).

101

After grouping the HPO terms into categories based on affected organ systems, there

102

were 115 HPO terms of which 73 could be matched to 100 phenotypes available in the

103

UKBB. Most of the unmatched phenotypes were related to specific abnormalities of body

104

structure or the musculoskeletal system, which were poorly represented in clinical and

105

billing codes, or measurements such as impaired T-cell function, not available in the

106

UKBB.

122

abnormality (HP0001507), body mass index (abnormality of body mass; HP0045081),

PTPN11, FBN1, JAG1, SOS2, RIT1, RAF1, KAT6B, RASA2, MAP2K1, DGCR2 and

125

COMT (Figure 1a, Table 1). The top SNP- phenotype association in each gene are

126

reported in Table 1. Diastolic BP and systolic BP along with body mass index displayed

127

a genetic association in each of the four syndromes. Birth weight, subcutaneous adipose

128

tissue (body fat percent), and tall stature for MS or short stature for NS are common

129

phenotypes for MS and NS; while hypothyroidism, and growth retardation are reported in

130

NS and DS. After correction for multiple testing, several other phenotypes reach

131

significance at the gene level (Figure 1b). When assessing the association by group of

132

phenotypes in each syndrome, we observed different patterns of association.

association was suggestive (Figure 2a and S3 Table). All SNPs in FBN1 displaying

151

associations were located within the same LD block and were highly correlated

152

suggesting a single signal within the gene (Figure 2a and 2b). A common intronic variant

153

rs589668 displays the top signal with high standing/sitting height ratio (beta=0.03,

SNPs (rs11070641, rs4775760, rs363832 and rs140605) that reach genome-wide

178

MAP2K1 indicating that the association observed within each gene represents a single

179

signal (Figure 3b). Among SNPs with pleiotropic effects, rs11066309 in PTPN11 displays

180

a strong association with increased risk for hypothyroidism (ALT freq=0.40; OR [95% CI]:

184

(PTPN11), rs72681869 (SOS2), rs61755579 (SOS2), and rs112542693 (MAP2K2) were

185

linked to Noonan syndrome and a number of abnormalities including global

Discussion

220

the component phenotypes of syndromic disease. We hypothesize that in the general

221

population, common and rare alleles for syndromic diseases display pleiotropic effects

222

with the phenotypes related to genetic syndromes. Using the UKBB, we linked individual-

223

level data to the characteristic phenotypes of Alagille, Marfan, Noonan, and DiGeorge

224

syndromes, showing clearly the association of common and rare alleles to single

225

component phenotypes of each syndrome. While classical Mendelian forms of each

226

syndrome may be uncommon, individual phenotypes attributable to these syndromic loci

227

appear to be common within the general population. This finding support the findings of

228

Bastarache et al[4], suggesting a scaling of Mendelian disease phenotypes into a

229

continuous phenotyping score to improve the identification of individuals with rare

230

diseases.

Here, we systematically describe the association of variation at four syndromic loci with

231
232

Within families of individuals affected by syndromic disease carrying the same pathogenic

233

mutation,

234

individuals[10,11]. Here, we show that many common and rare variants at syndromic loci

235

existing in the general population may result in expression of traits and phenotypes

236

closely related to the syndrome of interest. For example, we observe associations of a

237

common intronic variant in FBN1 rs589668 (MAF=0.25 in Europeans populations) with

238

increases in blood pressure and height and decreased subcutaneous fat distribution. In

239

GTex[12], this variant is an eQTL strongly associated with decreased expression in whole

240

blood (p=1.7x10-37), which would be concordant with the known molecular mechanism of

241

FBN1 pathogenesis in MS: pathogenic alleles impairing gene function result in increased

242

height and abnormal fat distribution and increased arterial stiffness[13,14]. Modifiers of

243

penetrance and phenotypic expressivity in Marfan syndrome have been proposed,[15,16]

244

but our results suggest that common variants and local haplotype structure around

245

syndromic genes may deserve more attention[17].

246
247

Noonan syndrome is caused by mutations in PTPN11 and part of a group of related

248

disorders arising from activating mutations in RAS-MAPK signaling pathway known as

249

RASopathies which display many phenotypes across a variety of organ systems. A wide

250

phenotypic variability and genetic heterogeneity have also been described in individuals

251

with Noonan syndrome in relation to rare variants in PTPN11[18]. Here, we show that

252

even in the general population, common and rare variants in PTPN11 are independently

253

associated with phenotypes such as hypothyroidism, small birth weight and low percent

254

of body fat observed in some Noonan syndromes cases[19–21]. In GTex[12], numerous

255

variants in PTPN11, such as rs11066309, rs3741983 and rs11066322 were significantly

256

associated with a decreased expression in atrial appendage, adipose tissue, thyroid and

257

skin and esophagus. Although in consistent with the role of PTPN11 in thyroid function,

258

cancer and autoimmunity[22–24], these variants are instead described as eQTLs with

259

TMEM116, ALDH2 and MAPKAPK5-AS1 located up to 500kb upstream of PTPN11,

260

suggesting that the association observed with rs11066309, rs3741983 and rs11066322

261

may also be potentially linked to other genes.

262
263

Growth retardation, lower BMI and short stature are well-known characteristics of Noonan

264

syndrome, and a recent study reported a phenotype-genotype variability of growth pattern

265

in patients with Noonan syndrome[25]. In concordance with this study, we showed that,

266

in the general population, common and rare variants in RASA2, SOS2 and MAP2K1 are

267

independently associated with growth characteristics (body mass index, height and

268

growth abnormality) and the association driven by single or multiple haplotype in each

269

gene.

270
271

When performing genetic testing, allele frequency is often used as a marker to determine

272

pathogenicity of a genetic variant. Common variation in and around JAG1 has previously

273

been associated with such disparate phenotypes as pulse pressure, circulating blood

274

indices, and birthweight, and none of the variants included in our analysis appeared to be

275

directly associated with the component phenotypes of AS. However, the unifying

276

molecular abnormality in AS are defects in vascular formation which lead to each of the

277

component cardiovascular and liver phenotypes of Alagille syndrome[26,27].

278
279

Our study has some limitations. Our analysis was limited to phenotypes with more than

280

100 cases; therefore, diseases with relatively rare prevalence were not analyzed. In

281

addition, because our study cohort consist of adults from the general population, specific

282

phenotype targeting facial and skeletal dysmorphism, such as butterfly vertebrae or broad

283

forehead; specific abnormalities of organs, such as biliary disease; and phenotypes

284

observed during childhood, such as developmental delay or attention deficit and

285

hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were not present. However, to correct on the lack of some

286

of these phenotypes, we used certain phenotypes or measurement present in the UKBB,

287

such as head circumference as a proxy for broad forehead, education level for ADHD,

288

weight and height at age 10 as proxy for growth abnormality. That said, the complexity of

289

matching UKBB phenotypes to HPO terms may simply not capture some phenotypes,

290

despite manual curation.

291
292

Key strengths of our study include the ability to systematically test multiple phenotype-

293

genotype association and to highlight pleiotropy linked to syndromic genes. Our study

294

maps UKBB phenotypes to HPO terms and shows that common and rare variants in

295

genes responsible for Alagille, Marfan, Noonan, and DiGeorge syndromes, are also

296

independently associated with component phenotypes of these syndromes in the general

297

population.

298
299

Our findings suggest that the spectrum of association of common and rare variants in

300

genes involved in syndromic diseases can be extended to individual component

301

phenotypes in the general population. Further research is needed to characterize the

302

pleiotropic effect of alleles in genes in persons without the corresponding genetic

303

syndrome.

Materials and Methods

307

The study cohort was derived from the UK Biobank (UKBB), a large prospective cohort

308

study with comprehensive health data from over 500,000 volunteer participants in the

309

United Kingdom aged 37-73 years at recruitment in 2006-2010. The cohort has previously

310

been described in detail[28,29]. Information on the UK biobank participants was collected

311

at enrollment, and from electronic health record (EHR) information which includes

312

diagnostic codes (ICD10, ICD9) and procedural code (OPCS) from hospital admission

313

records dating to 1992, and cancer registries. Data collected at the assessment visit

314

included information on a participant's health and lifestyle, hearing and cognitive function,

315

collected through a touchscreen questionnaire and verbal interview. A range of physical

316

measurements was also performed, including blood pressure; arterial stiffness; body

317

composition measures (including impedance); hand-grip strength; ultrasound bone

318

densitometry; spirometry; and an exercise/fitness test with ECG. Samples of blood, urine,

319

and saliva were also collected. Medical phenotypes were aggregated as previously

320

described, incorporating available information including a broad set of medical

321

phenotypes defined using computational matching and manual curation of on hospital in-

322

patient record data (ICD10 and ICD9 codes), self-reported verbal questionnaire data, and

323

cancer and death registry data[30,31].

Phenotypes of target syndromes

326

We identified phenotypes related to syndromic diseases through the Human Phenotype

327

Ontology (HPO). HPO is an ontology-based system developed using medical literature,

328

and other ontology-based systems such as Orphanet, and OMIM[9]. HPO provides a

329

standardized vocabulary of phenotypic and abnormalities encountered in human

330

diseases. The HPO has link symptoms/phenotypes to diseases or genetic disorders, and

331

the causing genes. As an example, Alagille syndrome (AS) is linked to JAG1, and

332

NOTCH2 genes as well as all the phenotypes or symptoms observed in AS, such as atrial

333

septal defect, hypertelorism, and butterfly vertebra.

334
335

HPO terms were directly matched to UKBB phenotypes when phenotypes in both

336

systems had similar terminology. The direct phenotype matching was conducted using a

337

semi-automatic mapping system which combines semantic and lexical similarity between

338

word[32] followed by manual curation. When the HPO terms were not present, we

339

performed an indirect matching by hand to find in the UKBB, the phenotype that best

340

reflects the target HPO terms. For example, abnormality of body structure or body

341

morphology such as abnormal body height, reduced sub cutaneous adipose tissues, bone

342

density or broad forehead, were respectively matched to sitting/standing height ratio;

343

body fat percentage; bone mineral density, and head bone area. For psychiatric diseases

344

such as depression and neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit and

345

hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), we used a score of depressive symptoms and self-

346

reported educational level respectively as proxies for these terms.

347
348

To increase the number of subjects in some subgroup of phenotypes, we combined

349

subcategories of HPO terms into a group or category. For example, 39 HPO terms

350

representing an abnormality of head, ears, and eyes such as low-set ears, strabismus,

351

macrotia, webbed neck, short neck, abnormality of the eye, microcornea, down-slanted

352

palpebral fissure and other congenital abnormality of ears, were grouped into

353

“Abnormality of head or neck (HP0000152)” and mapped to icd10 targeting congenital

354

malformations of eye, ear, face, and neck and other organs especially facial appearance

355

(ICD10: Q10 to Q18 and Q87). Ten HPO terms for congenital abnormality of

356

cardiovascular system including Ventricular septal defect, Atrial septal defect, Tetralogy

357

of Fallot, Patent ductus arteriosus, Bicuspid aortic valve, Truncus arteriosus, Coarctation

358

of aorta, Tricuspid valve prolapse were combined into abnormality of the cardiovascular

359

system (HP0001626) and mapped to Congenital malformations of the circulatory system

360

(ICD10: Q20 to Q28).

Genotyping data

363

Genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix UK BiLEVE Axiom array on an initial

364

50,000 participants; the remaining 450,000 participants were genotyped using the

365

Affymetrix UK Biobank Axiom® array. The two arrays are extremely similar (with over

366

95% common content). Quality control and imputation to over 90 million SNPs, indels and

367

large structural variants was performed[33]. 5647 SNPs in 26 genes related to Alagille

368

syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Noonan syndrome, and DiGeorge syndrome were selected

369

for our study (table2). The selected SNPs had a MAF>0.005 and an imputation

Statistical analysis

380

SNP level

381

For binary traits, logistic regression with adjustment on age, sex, batch, and the top 5

382

principal components were used. First, regression was used in a situation of unbalanced

383

numbers of cases and controls, especially when the number of cases was very small (less

384

than 200 cases). For continuous traits, we performed linear regression with adjustment

385

on age, sex, batch, and the top 5 principal components. Our analysis was restricted to

386

individuals of Europeans descent, due to the relatively small number of individuals from

387

other ethnic groups in the UKBB.

388

independent tests was used to correct on multiple testing. Given the high correlation

389

between SNPs within gene or regions, Bonferroni correction is often stringent when to

390

number of tests considered is number of SNPS time the number of phenotypes. To take

391

in account the correlation between SNPs, we estimate the number of independent SNPs

Bonferroni correction based on the number of

in a block of 50 kb with a correlation > 0.8 using the pairwise pruning method implemented

393

in PLINK which estimated 2166 independent SNPs within our target regions. We apply

394

a threshold of 3.16x10-07=0.05/(2166x73) independent tests.

Gene Level

396

The Sequence Kernel association test (SKAT) was performed for gene-level association

397

using allelic frequency methods and weighted by the CADD score (Combined Annotation

398

399

analyzed using allelic frequency methods and weighted by the CADD score was applied

for multiple testing correction.
