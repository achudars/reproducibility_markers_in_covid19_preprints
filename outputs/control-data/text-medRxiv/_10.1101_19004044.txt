ABSTRACT

28

Background: Elderly patients, 65 years old and older, largely represent (>50 %) of hospital-

29

admitted patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Data are conflicting comparing efficacy

30

of early routine invasive (within 48-72 hours of initial evaluation) versus conservative

31

management of ACS in this population.

32

Objective: We aimed to determine the effectiveness of routine early invasive strategy compared to

33

conservative treatment in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events in elderly patients with

34

non-ST elevation (NSTE) ACS.

35

Data Sources: We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials through PubMed,

36

Cochrane, and Google Scholar database.

37

Study Selection: The studies included were randomized controlled trials that evaluated the

38

effectiveness of invasive strategy compared to conservative treatment among elderly patients > 65

39

years old diagnosed with NSTEACS. Studies were included if they assessed any of the following

40

outcomes of death, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, recurrent angina,

41

and need for revascularization. Five articles were subsequently included in the meta-analysis.

42

Data Extraction: Three independent reviewers extracted the data of interest from the articles using

43

a standardized data collection form that included study quality indicators. Disparity in assessment

44

was settled by an independent adjudicator.

45

Data Synthesis: All pooled analyses were based on fixed effects model. A total of 2,495 patients

46

were included, 1337 in the invasive strategy group, and 1158 in the conservative treatment group.

47

Results: Meta-analysis showed less incidence of revascularization in the invasive (2%) over

48

conservative treatment groups (8%), with overall risk ratio of 0.31 (95% CI 0.16-0.61, I2 =0%).

49

There was also less incidence of stroke in the invasive (2%) versus conservative group (3%) but

50

this was not statistically significant. A significant benefit was noted in the reduction of all-cause

mortality (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.55-0.72, I2=84%) and myocardial infarction (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.49-

52

0.79, I2=63%) but with significant heterogeneity.

53

Conclusion: There was a significantly lower rate of revascularization in the invasive strategy group

54

compared to the conservative treatment group. In the reduction of all-cause mortality and MI, there

55

was benefit favoring invasive strategy but with significant heterogeneity. These findings do not

56

support the bias against early routine invasive intervention in the elderly group with NSTEACS.

57

However, further studies focusing on the elderly with larger population sizes are still needed.

I. INTRODUCTION

63

Based on the World Health Organization’s Global Burden of Disease report, ischemic heart

64

disease (IHD) is the overall leading cause of death worldwide.1 Although the annual number of

65

hospital discharges for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in developed countries has declined

66

slowly over the past two decades, the number has increased in developing countries.2 In the

67

Philippines, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality.3 The Philippine

68

Heart Association ACS registry reported that ACS is prevalent in the age range 51-70, with mean

69

age group of 66 years old. 3

70

The most recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association

71

(ACC/AHA 2014) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC 2015) guidelines for non–ST

72

segment elevation ACS (NSTEACS) reflect medical advancements in therapeutics and strategies

73

of care leading to improved survival in ACS, but this was mainly observed in relatively younger

74

individuals (<65 years of age) and in men. These guidelines emphasize intensive and early medical

75

and interventional therapy, particularly for those at high risk.4,5,6

76

The 2014 AHA/ACC NSTEACS Guidelines generally recommend that older patients with

77

NSTEACS should be treated with goal-directed medical therapy, together with an early invasive

78

strategy, and revascularization as appropriate.5 The 2015 ESC Guidelines for the Management of

79

ACS, on the other hand, recommend that decisions on elderly patients with NSTEACS should be

80

based on ischemic and bleeding risks, estimated life expectancy, comorbidities, quality of life,

81

patient values and preferences, and the estimated risks and benefits of revascularization. 6 Despite

82

the guidelines, older patients are less likely to undergo procedures after an NSTEACS than younger

83

patients due in part to patient and practitioner concerns about the increased risk of

84

complications.7,8,9

85

Due to conflicting results of studies, lack of specific recommendations from the

86

abovementioned guidelines, and the paucity of data on early invasive strategy versus conservative

87

treatment for NSTEACS in elderly patients, this meta-analysis was conducted to focus on this

88

special population to compare benefits and risks of early invasive therapy versus conservative

89

management.

IV. METHODOLOGY

112

Study Registration

113

Prior to the conduct of the research, the study was registered and approved by the

114

Committee on Research (CORES) of Manila Doctors Hospital.

115

Criteria for considering studies for this review

116

The studies included were randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of

117

invasive strategy compared to conservative treatment among elderly patients > 65 years old

118

diagnosed with NSTEACS. Studies were included if any of the outcomes assessed were: death,

119

cardiovascular mortality, MI, stroke, recurrent angina, and need for revascularization.

120
121

Definition of terms:

122

1. Invasive strategy or early invasive strategy –Routine early (within 48-72 hours of initial

123

evaluation) cardiac catheterization, followed by PCI, CABG, or continuing medical

124

therapy, depending on the coronary anatomy.

125

2. Conservative treatment - Initial optimal medical management, with cardiac

126

catheterization reserved for patients with recurrent ischemia at rest or after a non-invasive

127

stress test, followed by revascularization if the anatomy is suitable.

128

3. Elderly patients – Patients aged 65 years or older (WHO, 2000), with or without

129

comorbidities.

130

4. Non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) – Unstable angina, with or

131

without ST segment depression on electrocardiogram with normal or raised blood

132

concentration of troponin T or I. Elevated troponin was defined as a value exceeding the

133

99th percentile of a normal population at the local laboratory at each participating site.

134
135

Search methods for identification of studies

136

Systematic computerized search (APPENDIX A) was performed using the Pubmed and

137

Cochrane databases. MESH and free text of the following main key terms were used: “randomized

138

controlled trials”, “elderly”, “non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome”, “invasive strategy”,

139

“conservative management”, “invasive strategy versus conservative strategy”, “major adverse

140

cardiovascular events”, “all-cause mortality”, “cardiovascular mortality”, “myocardial infarction”,

141

“stroke”, “recurrent angina”, “need for revascularization”. The last search was done on 10 August

142

2017.

143

Eligibility assessment was performed independently in an unblinded standard manner by

144

three reviewers. The literature search identified 322 possible articles. Of these, 69 were relevant,

145

particularly they involved studies related to ACS. Prospective cohort studies and post hoc analyses

146

were excluded. Of the 69 articles, 55 were excluded due to different intervention since they did not

147

involve comparing invasive versus conservative management in ACS. After assessing 14 articles

148

for eligibility, 8 articles with different population and methods were excluded (details for the titles

149

of the studies and reasons for exclusion are listed in APPENDIX D). One article was possibly

166

Data analysis

167

Review Manager 5.3 was used to analyze the data. Analysis of dichotomous data was done

168

using risk ratio, 95% confidence interval, and Mantel-Haenszel method with fixed effects model.

169

Heterogeneity between trials was tested using a standard Chi-square test and I2 statistics. The p-

170

value of <0.10 was considered to be statistically significant and I2 of ³50% is considered to have

171

high heterogeneity.

172
173

Description of studies

174

Five randomized controlled trials involving a total of 2,495 patients met the inclusion

175

criteria. The data on population characteristics, intervention type, and measured outcomes were

176

extracted from each trial (Table 1). Four of the trials included elderly patients with NSTEACS

177

aged > 70 years while one trial included patients > 65 years old.10 The studies compared the

178

effectiveness of early invasive strategy (treatment group) versus optimum medical treatment

179

(control group) in the management of NSTEACS in elderly patients.

Effects of intervention on outcomes of interest

201

A. All-cause mortality

202

A total of 242 among 1338 (18 %) elderly patients with NSTEACS died in the Invasive

203

Strategy Group; while 296 died among 1158 (26 %) patients in the Conservative Group (Figure 2).

204

The pooled analysis of all-cause mortality showed statistically significant benefit of invasive over

205

conservative strategy with an overall risk ratio of 0.63 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.72) but with significant

206

heterogeneity (p value of 0.0001, I2 =84%).

B. Myocardial infarction

213

In the Invasive Strategy Group, there were 89 events of MI among a total of 926 (10 %)

214

patients; while there were 142 among 912 (16 %) patients in the Conservative Group (Figure 3).

215

The pooled analysis showed that invasive strategy is beneficial over conservative treatment in

216

preventing MI with an overall risk ratio of 0.62 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.79) but with significant

217

heterogeneity (p value of 0.0001, I2 = 63%).

C. Stroke

223

Among the five trials, Savonitto et al. (2012), Tegn (2016), and Bach (2004) reported the

224

outcomes of stroke (Figure 4). In the Invasive Strategy Group, there were 13 events of stroke among

225

874 (2%) patients; while there were 24 among 858 (3%) patients in the Conservative Group. The

226

pooled analysis showed that early invasive strategy was favored over conservative treatment in

227

preventing stroke but no statistically significant benefit with overall risk ratio of 0.53 (95% CI 0.27-

228

1.03, I2 =0%).

D. Need for revascularization

235

In elderly patients with NSTEACS, there were a total of 10 patients among 435 (2%) who

236

needed revascularization in the Invasive Group while there were 34 patients among 441 (8%) in

237

the Conservative Group (Figure 5). The pooled analysis for need for revascularization showed

238

statistically significant benefit with an overall risk ratio of 0.31 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.61) with no

239

significant heterogeneity (p value of 0.0006, I2 =0%).

E. Outcomes for cardiovascular mortality and recurrent angina

245

Among the five trials, only one trial assessed the outcomes of cardiovascular mortality and

246

recurrent angina.13 The cardiovascular mortality incidence in the invasive versus the control group

247

was 10% and 11 %, respectively, showing a non-statistically significant benefit of invasive over

248

conservative treatment (RR 0.87, 95% CI, 0.49-1.56, p=0.65). Likewise, an invasive strategy

249

showed a non-statistically significant benefit over conservative treatment in reducing recurrent

250

angina (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.45–1.46, p=0.49).

251
252

VI. DISCUSSION

253

Meta-analysis of data from the five trials included in this study showed that an early

254

invasive strategy appears to be beneficial in suitable elderly patients > 65 years old with NSTEACS.

255

There was significantly less need for revascularization in the invasive strategy group compared to

256

the conservative treatment group. This finding implies that more patients in the conservative group

257

clinically worsened during their course in the ward, requiring revascularization. It is also possible

258

that early anatomic definition of the diseased coronaries may help the attending physician optimize

259

an appropriate evidence-based management of the patient. The studies that evaluated the outcomes

260

of revascularization stated that the indications for revascularization in the conservative group were:

261

positive pre-discharge stress test, poor in-hospital outcomes, recurrent ischemia, reinfarction,

262

malignant ventricular arrhythmias, refractory angina, and heart failure.12-14 Some patients who

263

subsequently required revascularization could have probably been better off with an early invasive

264

approach.

265

For the outcomes of death and MI, an invasive strategy showed a statistically significant

266

benefit over conservative treatment but with significant heterogeneity. The possible sources of

267

heterogeneity for the outcomes of death and MI may be the small number of events and sample

268

sizes. In two studies, the elderly population was just a subgroup analysis of the total population.10-

270

differences in the intervention and outcomes of interest. Furthermore, there were differences in age

271

cutoffs and follow-up period. Two studies had age cutoffs of 75 years11,13 while the other three

272

studies had age cutoffs of 65, 70, and 80 years.10,12,14 Possible clinical differences in outcomes may

273

exist in these age brackets of the elderly population. In terms of follow-up periods, two studies had

274

follow-up of 3 years11,12; one had follow-up period of 3 months to 3 years14; one had follow-up of

275

1 year13; while one had follow-up of 6 months and 1 year10. However, despite the heterogeneity,

276

data from these studies clustered on the direction towards benefit favoring invasive over

277

conservative strategy.

Hence, the population in the subgroup analysis may not be powered enough to detect the

278

In the reduction of stroke, invasive strategy showed benefit over conservative treatment

279

but this was not statistically significant. The outcomes for cardiovascular mortality and recurrent

280

angina were assessed only in one study13, which showed also a non-statistically significant benefit

281

of invasive strategy over conservative treatment among elderly NSTEACS patients.

282

Overall, this study does not support the relatively conservative tendency when dealing with

283

elderly patients with NSTEACS in real-life clinical setting. The elderly population is considered a

284

high-risk group wherein more than half the mortality in NSTEACS occur5 and a more aggressive

285

approach in suitable patients may be more appropriate and beneficial. Among people who die of

286

ischemic heart disease, 83% were >65 years of age.1 This mortality rate is expected to increase in

287

the forthcoming decades due to improving life expectancy of the elderly. Age is one of the most

288

important predictors of risk in NSTEACS. Each 10-year increase in age results in a 75% increase

289

in hospital mortality in ACS patients.15 Despite the relatively higher risk in this age group, elderly

290

ACS patients are under-represented in clinical trials such that subjects older than 75 years of age

291

account for less than 10%, and those older than 85 years account for less than 2% of all NSTEACS

292

subjects. 7 This highlights the need for more clinical trials and studies in this age group.

296

≥ 65 years who experienced an in-hospital major bleed had a 33% increased risk of 30-day

298

very elderly patients (≥ 90 years of age) with high success rates and declining major bleeding risk.17

VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

301

Results of this meta-analysis suggest some benefits with an early invasive strategy

302

compared to a conservative treatment approach in the management of elderly patients with

303

NSTEACS. There was a significantly lower rate of revascularization in the invasive strategy group

304

compared to the conservative treatment group. A statistically significant benefit favoring invasive

305

strategy was also noted in the reduction of death and myocardial infarction but with significant

306

heterogeneity. These findings do not support the bias against early routine invasive intervention in

307

the elderly group with NSTEACS.

308

Although an early invasive strategy may be favorable among elderly patients presenting

309

with NSTEACS, the certainty of benefit versus risk still needs to be supported by larger clinical

310

trials and registries with uniform age cutoff for elderly, particularly > 65 years old, to provide high

311

generalizability and statistical power. Current risk scoring systems such as the GRACE (Global

312

Registry of Acute Coronary Events) Score, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Risk

313

Score, and CRUSADE Bleeding Score are recommended in the initial evaluation of elderly patients

314

presenting with NSTEACS. A special risk scoring may be developed to more accurately identify

315

those who are suitable for an early invasive strategy, with an expected larger outcome and survival

316

benefit.
