Abstract

37
38

Purpose: The aim of this systematic review is to identify all the available data on human lens

39

proteomics with a critical role to age-related cataract formation in order to elucidate the

40

physiopathology of the aging lens.

41

Materials and methods: We searched on Medline and Cochrane databases. The search

42

generated 328 manuscripts. We included nine original proteomic studies that investigated

43

human cataractous lenses.

44

Results: Deamidation was the major age-related post-translational modification. There was a

45

significant increase in the amount of αA-crystallin D-isoAsp58 present at all ages, while an

46

increase in the extent of Trp oxidation was apparent in cataract lenses when compared to aged

47

normal lenses. During aging, enzymes with oxidized cysteine at critical sites included

48

GAPDH, glutathione synthase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, and

49

PARK7.

50

Conclusion: D-isoAsp in αA crystallin could be associated with the development of age-

51

related cataract in human, by contributing to the denaturation of a crystallin, and decreasing

52

its ability to act as a chaperone. Oxidation of Trp may be associated with nuclear cataract

53

formation in man, while the role of oxidant stress in age-related cataract formation is

54

dominant.

Significance of the study

58
59

The crystallins undergo extensive post-translational modifications in order to interact and

60

maintain the soluble basis for lenticular transparency. Severe perturbations of this balance of

61

modifications and interactions lead to inappropriate protein folding, association and

62

aggregation. Those protein aggregates, if a certain threshold is surpassed and perpetuated,

63

diffract incident light leading to lens opacification and cataractogenesis. In addition, the

64

crystallins in high concentration are more than physical structural components of the

65

crystalline lens, and their protein species have additional multiple catalytical or regulatory

66

functions affecting the transparency of the lens and thus, cataractogenesis. Therefore, it is

67

necessary to understand the dynamics of this protein superfamily. Proteomics research is an

68

ideal way to characterize the healthy lenticular protein constituents and elucidate the complex

69

factors involved in cataractogenesis, given that the lens consists mainly of proteins and water.

70

Although considerable advances have been made in the field, and significant proteomic

71

studies have been published to date, this is a systematic review of all proteomic studies on

72

cataractous human lens compared to healthy human lens. The present systematic review aims

73

to shed light on the complex pathophysiology of cataractogenesis and set the basis for future

74

research on possible prevention or even new non-invasive treatment of age-related cataract.

Introduction

77
78

Cataract is an opacification of normally clear crystalline lens that may cause a decrease in

79

vision or even blindness if left untreated (1). Cataract is responsible for the 33% of blindness

80

worldwide (2–4). Age is the most important aetiological factor of cataract, due to the

81

cumulative damage of environmental insults on proteins and cells of the crystalline lens

82

(5,6,7).

83

The lens fibers have a high protein content (~34%) and relatively low water content (~65%).

84

The crystallins are water-soluble structural proteins of the lens fibers. Human crystallins are

85

classified into three main types: alpha, beta and gamma crystallins. Beta and gamma

86

crystallins are similar in sequence and structure, so they are grouped as a protein superfamily,

87

the βγ-crystallins. The α-crystallin family and βγ-crystallins represent the majority of proteins

88

in the human lens fibers (8).

89

The crystallins need an antioxidant environment in order to remain soluble and maintain the

90

transparency of the lens (6,9). In order to elucidate the complex factors involved in

91

cataractogenesis, it is necessary to understand the dynamics of this protein superfamily and

92

proteomics research is an ideal way to do so.

93

With the progress in proteomic analysis, proteomic approaches have been applied to identify

94

proteins in various physiological or pathological conditions in the crystalline lens and analyze

95

the proteome of cataractous or normal lenses. Moreover, various investigations on different

96

aspects of the lens proteomics of different species have been carried out using a wide variety

97

of proteomic techniques (10).

98

In particular, many studies were focused on lens proteomics of various species, such as mice.

99

In 2002, Ueda Y. et al. suggested that partial degradation of α- and β -crystallins and

100

increased acidity of γ-crystallins may cause insolubilisation during aging and they created 2-

101

DE proteome maps of mouse lens proteins in order to be compared with maps of lens proteins

102

of mice with cataracts and facilitate the identification of cataract-specific modifications (11).

103

In 2006, Hoehenwarter W. et al. published a review of eye lens proteomics that summarized

104

crystallin modifications in the lens detected by proteomics techniques (9).

105

In 2013, the Human Eye Proteome Project initiated with a principal goal the characterization

106

of the proteome of the human eye. In 2013 there were 4,842 non-redundant proteins identified

107

in the human eye. In 2018, an updated resource of 9,782 non-redundant proteins in the human

108

eye was reported. Regarding the human lens, the number of known proteins in the human lens

109

and zonule system was increased from 273 in 2013 to 1,117 known proteins to date (12).

110

Although considerable advances have been made to clarify the pathophysiology of age-related

111

cataract formation, additional high-quality data focused on the human lens need to be

112

exported using proteomics. Thereby, it is necessary to collect and summarise all proteomic

113

researches to date that provide data on cataractous human lens compared to a healthy human

114

lens in order to elucidate the complex factors involved in cataractogenesis and suggest

115

possible prevention or even new non-invasive treatment of age-related cataract.

116
117

Objective

118
119

The present systematic review aims to identify all the available data on human lens

120

proteomics with a critical role to age-related cataract formation in order to elucidate the

121

different physiopathological states that lead to the aging of the crystalline lens and thus,

122

cataractogenesis.

128
129

Eligibility criteria

130

In this systematic review were included English full-text peer-reviewed articles that used

131

proteomics methodologies to study in vivo or in vitro human lens proteins and define possible

132

pathways for age-related cataract formation.

133
134

In particular, studies were selected according to the criteria outlined below.

135
136

Type of studies: original English studies that used proteomic analysis were included.

137

Regarding geographical location, publication status or year of publication there were no

138

limitations. Reviews and studies published in non-English language were excluded.

139
140

Information sources

157

Searching electronic databases identified all the available studies. Primarily, two major

158

databases were used for the purposes of this review, PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane

159

Database of Systematic Reviews. Further search on PROSPERO for on-going systematic

160

reviews was conducted. Besides, we hand-searched contents pages of Journal of Vision and

161

Journal of Investigative ophthalmology & visual science. In order to ensure literature

162

completeness, we screened additionally the reference lists of the studies that were included in

10

163

our search. The literature search in the present systematic review was restricted to the English

164

language and human subjects. References identified were imported in Mendeley Desktop

165

software for deduplication.

166
167

Search strategy

168

Two reviewers independently screened the titles and the abstracts against the eligibility

169

criteria. Our search strategy was based on proteomics and the biological context of interest

170

(human crystalline lens). Our literature search strategies were developed using medical

171

subject headings (MeSH) and free-text terms related to proteomics and crystalline lens. The

172

“English” filter was applied via the Filter section.

173

We used the following search terms in all databases: proteomics; proteome; “proteom*”;

174

“proteomic analysis”; “proteomic study”; “lens, crystalline"; "Anterior Capsule of the Lens";

175

"Posterior Capsule of the Lens"; "Lens Nucleus, Crystalline"; "Lens Cortex, Crystalline";

176

"Lens Capsule, Crystalline"; "Crystallins"; "Cataract" and "Cataract, Age-Related Nuclear".

Data management

181

Literature search results were uploaded to Covidence™. Our team members developed

182

screening questions based on the eligibility criteria. Citation abstracts and full-text articles

183

were uploaded to Covidence™ based on those screening questions.

184
185

Study Selection process

186

Two principal reviewers, independently working, screened the titles and abstracts of the

187

results retrieved from our search strategy. Full-text forms were obtained for the potentially

188

eligible studies or in case of any uncertainty. Then, the two reviewers assessed the full-text

189

forms and chose those that met the predefined inclusion criteria. In order to avoid data

190

duplication, multiple publications from the same research group were not extracted (if

191

reporting the same methodology and the same results); instead, the paper that provided the

192

most robust evidence was chosen as the primary evidence source.

193

Any potential disagreements were resolved through discussion with a senior reviewer. All the

194

reasons for excluding studies were recorded. Neither of the principal reviewers nor the senior

195

reviewer was blind to the journal titles or the study authors or institutions.

196
197

Data collection process

198

The two principal reviewers using a predefined standardized form for data extraction

199

accomplished data collection process. The first reviewer extracted the data from the included

200

studies and the second one checked the extracted data. Reviewers resolved any disagreements

201

by discussion; if no agreement could be reached a discussion with a senior reviewer was

202

planned. Study authors were contacted if any uncertainty was present.

Assessment of risk of bias

219

In order to assess the possible risk of bias for each eligible study while collecting data, we

220

created a risk of bias tool based on several questions. The assessment tool covered the

221

following domains: number of subjects, compliance with the manufacturer’ instructions while

222

applying the proteomic techniques, repetition of the experiment. The procedures that took

223

place in each study were described, for each domain of the tool. Studies were rated as of ‘high

224

risk,’ ‘low risk,’ or ‘unclear risk.’ Two independent reviewers conducted the assessment of

225

the risk of bias, and any disagreement was solved by discussion and by consulting a senior

226

reviewer.

227
228

Synthesis of results

229

A narrative summary of all the included studies was conducted. In case of missing data, we

230

intended to contact the original authors of the study. Results were presented alongside overall

231

judgments for concerns regarding the validity and imprecision of the result.

Study selection

236

A total of nine studies were identified for inclusion in our systematic review. Our search

237

provided a total of 328 citations. In particular, the search of Medline and Cochrane databases

238

provided a total of 300 citations. After adjusting for duplicates still, 300 citations remained.

239

Of these, 134 studies were discarded because they were irrelevant to our subject. After

240

reviewing the abstracts of the rest 166 studies it appeared that 103 papers did not meet the

241

inclusion criteria. The full texts of the rest 63 citations were examined in more detail. After

242

checking the references of located, relevant papers and searching for studies that have cited

243

these papers, 28 additional studies were identified. It appeared that further 82 studies did not

244

meet the inclusion criteria, as described. Thus, nine studies met the inclusion criteria and were

245

included in our systematic review. No unpublished relevant studies were obtained. The flow

246

diagram of the study selection is shown in figure 1. The reasons for exclusion of the 237

247

papers can be found in table 2. The reasons for exclusion of 82 references after reviewing

248

their full text forms can be found in table 3. The full list of 328 citations can be found in

249

Appendix 2. The exclusion reasons for each citation and the full list of 91 articles that were

250

studied in more detail, can be found in Appendix 3. The full list of articles excluded after

Study characteristics

263

The included studies were published between 2005 and 2017. Of those, three were conducted

264

in U.S.A and six in Australia.

265

Methods: All nine studies finally selected for the review were proteomic analysis studies

266

published in English. All of them used Mass Spectrometry.

267

Participants: The included studies involved human lenses.

268

Intervention: They performed proteomic analysis to compare normal human lenses to

269

cataractous human lenses.

270

Outcomes: The included studies obtained information on proteins with a key role in the aging

271

of the crystalline lens. In all studies, the primary outcome assessed was this information,

272

which was either identified proteins, or protein structural characteristics, or post-translational

273

modifications, or protein expression, or protein function, or protein localization, or protein-

274

protein interactions.

275
276

Risk of bias within studies

277

The conditions in basic science studies could be completely controlled, in contrast to the

278

clinical studies. As a result, the risk of bias is minimum in basic science studies. However, we

279

created a risk of bias tool to assess the included studies.

280

The results can be found in table 4.

previously unreported sites. Based on their results, large numbers of asparagine and glutamine

293

sites were found to be significantly more deamidated in the water-insoluble

294

proteins of aged lenses and deamidation was found to be the major age-related PTM. They

295

also confirmed the far greater extent of S-methylation known in lens, while there was no

296

methylation in the 3-day-old lens. They identified specific Carboxymethyl lysine (CML) and

297

carboxyethyl lysine (CEL) sites in lens crystallins, which are advanced glycation end products

298

and have been suggested as general markers of advanced age and oxidation, although these

299

modifications were far less abundant than deamidation or methylation.

300
301

Hains P.G. and Truscott R.J. (2007) (15) compared PTMs present in young, aged, and

302

cataractous lenses, analysing a total of six human lenses, two young lenses (34, 35 years old),

303

two aged (72, 77 years old), and two early-stage nuclear cataract (70, 80 years old). The

304

researchers found that the proteins from all lenses contained numerous sites of deamidation,

305

oxidation, Cys-methylation, and acetylation. Deamidation was the most common PTM. An

306

increase in the extent of Trp oxidation was apparent in cataract lenses when compared to aged

307

normal lenses. Methylation of Cys in lens proteins was also reported (five Cys residues were

308

detected as being modified in the young lens group, four in the old normal lenses, and three in

309

the cataract lenses). A new phosphorylation site, in γS-crystallin (S89) was identified in one

310

of the young lenses, while, no phosphorylated Ser residues were detected in αB-crystallin

311

from the cataract lenses, whereas up to four were observed in the young and aged normal lens

312

samples. Οne new βB1-crystallin truncation was identified in both the aged normal and

313

cataract lenses. No Arg+55 Da modifications were detected in the cataract lenses.

314

Finally, Carboxymethyl lysine was detected in all lens groups, two in young, and one each in

315

aged and cataract lenses.

Hains P.G. and Truscott R.J. (2008) (16) examined the lens proteome using foetal (two sets),

318

aged normal (three, 59, 65 and 80 year old), and advanced nuclear cataract lenses (three 60,

319

65 and 80 year old). They identified 231 proteins across all lens samples, of which 183 in

320

foetal, 103 in adult normal and 105 in cataractous lenses. Of those, 60 proteins were found to

321

be common to all lens, while 22 previously unreported proteins were identified in normal

322

aged and 29 in cataract lenses. They stated as well that for most of the proteins presented, the

323

relative abundance of foetal lens proteins was greater than either of the other lens groups, with

324

the exception of phakinin (BFSP2_HUMAN), protein DJ-1 (PARK7_HUMAN) and

325

phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1_HUMAN), where both cataract and aged normal lenses

326

had greater relative abundance.

327

In addition to this, they reported that several proteins had a high abundance in the foetal lens

328

group but a much reduced level in both adult lens groups, including betaine– homocysteine S-

329

methyltransferase 1 (BHMT1_HUMAN), bA2-crystallin (CRBA2_HUMAN), bB3-crystallin

330

(CRBB3_HUMAN), gC-crystallin (CRGC_HUMAN), glycer-aldehyde- 3-phosphate

331

dehydrogenase (G3P_HUMAN), per oxiredoxin-6 (PRDX6_HUMAN) and vimentin

332

(VIME_HUMAN).

333
334

Hains P.G. and Truscott R.J. (2010) (17) characterized the sites of deamidation in all the

335

major crystallins in the human lens using two sets of fetal lenses, each containing two lenses

336

(set 1, 2 lenses, 17 weeks’ gestation; set 2, 1 lens, 17.5 weeks’ gestation plus 1 lens, 19

337

weeks’ gestation), three normal (59, 65, 80 years) lenses, and three nuclear cataractous lenses

338

(60, 65, 80 years).

339

Firstly, they stated that the number of deamidated residues varies considerably between the

340

various crystallins. In βB2- and γC-crystallin, only one residue was found to be

341

deamidated in the aged normal lenses. By contrast, nine sites of deamidation were found in

19

342

βB1-, eight in βA4-, five in γ-S, and six in βA1/A3-crystallin.

343

Moreover, the researchers reported that the extent of deamidation varied substantially. Some

344

crystallins from older lenses contained sites that were almost totally deamidated. These

345

included βA1/A3-, βA4-, γS-, and γD-crystallins. In βB2-crystallins, the most highly

346

deamidated residue in older normal lenses was Gln146, and the extent of deamidation was

347

approximately 3%. In αA-crystallin, the most deamidated sites were Asn123 and Gln126, and

348

the extent of deamidation was approximately 10%.

349

They also observed that the sites of deamidation were often localized to discrete regions. In

350

αA-crystallin, deamidation was found only in the putative C-terminal domain. In βA1/A3-

351

crystallin, the most substantial deamidation was found at three sites contained within a region

352

spanning residues 103 to 133. In γC-crystallin, the only site of deamidation was localized to

353

the peptide bridging the two domains. In most cases, the most highly deamidated sites were

354

those of Asn residues.

355

Finally, in their study, some sites (αA, Q147; αB, N78, Q108; βΑ4, Q64, N82; βΒ1, Ν67,

356

Ν69; γC, N24; γD, N160; γS, N14, Q16, N76) showed increased levels of deamidation in

357

ARNC cataractous lenses.

358
359

Hooi et al. (April 2012) (18) studied age-dependent changes in one crystallin representative

360

from each of the two major lens protein groups (α and β/γ crystallin families). Τhe first was

361

an Asp residue in αA crystallin (Asp 151), because it had been shown to be significantly

362

racemised in old human lenses and the second was an Asn residue in γS crystalline (Asn 76)

363

because it was found to be almost twice as deamidated in 60- to 70-year-old cataract lenses as

364

in normal controls. The authors examined lenses across the age range and compared the

365

extent of modification at both sites. For αA-crystallin, there was no significant difference in

366

Asp 151 racemization between cataract and normal lenses. By contrast, in γS-crystallin the

367

degree of conversion of Asn 76 to isoAsp in cataract lenses was approximately double that of

368

normal lenses at every age.

369
370

Hooi M.Y. et al. (May 2012) (19) characterized a site of glutamine (Gln) deamidation in γS-

371

crystallin and monitored its rate of conversion to Glu92 as a function of time and compared

372

this with deamidation of Gln170 and Glns in b-sheet regions of the protein. They showed that

373

there was a linear increase in the proportion of deamidation until teenage years, while there

374

was no further increase for the next 50 years. They found no significant difference in the

375

extent of Gln92 and Gln170 deamidation between cataract and age-matched normal lenses.

376
377

Hooi et al. (November 2012) (20) investigated the racemisation of Asp 58 in the most

378

abundant structural protein in the human lens, aA-crystallin, comparing normal and

379

cataractous human lenses. They stated that there was a significant increase in the amount of

380

D-isoAsp58 present at all ages. This was most evident during the early years, when age-

381

related cataract is first observed (the average value for D-isoAsp in cataract lenses was almost

382

26 % compared to normal lenses, almost 12 %).

383
384

Fan et al. (2015) (21) created the LEGSKO mouse in which lenticular GSH was lowered by

385

knocking out the γ-glutamyl cysteine ligase subunit Gclc, in order to mimic the oxidative

386

process and formation of protein disulfides linked to low concentrations of glutathione

387

(GSH) in the nucleus of the human lens. These LEGSKO mice developed nuclear cataract by

388

about 9 months. In order to test whether sites of disulfide bond formation are similar in mouse

389

and human age-related cataract, the researchers performed the first comparative analysis of

390

the cataract prone LEGSKO mouse and human aging and cataractous lens crystallin

391

disulfidome, and compared the results with the disulfidome from mouse lens homogenate

392

oxidized in vitro with H2O2 as a model of crystallin aggregation and opacification. They used

393

as control 3 young normal human lens nuclei (at 15, 7, and

394

3 years of age), and 3 old normal human lens nuclei (at 74, 72, and 68

395

years of age). They used as well 9 cataractous lenses, 3 in each category of grade II-V of Lens

396

Opacities Classification System III. The age of grade II group was 64, 67, and 60 years old,

397

the grade III was 60, 59, and 69 years old, the grade IV was 56, 63, and 77 years old, and the

398

grade V was 75, 80, and 78 years old.

399

Fan et al. first studied which proteins are associated with intra- versus intermolecular

400

disulfide-bond in old normal versus young human lens, and they determined how these

401

compared with those detected in oxidatively stressed, precataractous LEGSKO mouse lens.

402

Then they studied how crystallin disulfides found in human cataracts compare with those

403

detected in glutathione-depleted LEGSKO mouse cataracts and mouse lens proteins

404

undergoing in vitro oxidation.

405

Based on their findings, there was evidence of age-related shift from intra- to intermolecular

406

disulfide formation in human and LEGSKO Mouse Lens Crystallins, since over 25

407

intramolecular disulfide bond protein spots and less than six intermolecular disulfide protein

408

spots were identified in 4 year old lens, whereas in 67 year old human lens, less than four

409

intramolecular disulphide and more than 20 intermolecular disulfide proteins spots were

410

identified, in combination with a similar shift in spot pattern in the old versus young WT

411

mouse and with the fact that the intra- to intermolecular disulfide shift had already occurred at

412

5mos in the precataractous, GSH suppressed, LEGSKO mouse lens when compared with the

413

5 months old WT lens.

414

Furthermore, 4 types of cysteine residues were identified based on their susceptibility to

415

oxidation with age and as a function of presence and severity of cataract graded from II to V.

416

The first includes cysteine residues that are mildly oxidized with age and not further oxidized

417

in cataracts (Cys67 in βB2, Cys19 in γD, Cys109 in γC, Cys99 in βA4 and Cys185 of βA1/3);

418

the second includes cysteine residues with mild oxidation in old normal lenses but massive

419

increase in cataracts regardless of cataract severity (Cys42 in γD, Cys52 and Cys170 in

420

βA1/3, Cys38 in βB2 and Cys83 in γS); the third includes cysteine residues with oxidation in

421

old normal lenses and further increase in cataract lenses (Cys33 in βA4, Cys80 in βB1, and

422

Cys23 in γC), and the fourth includes cysteine residues that are barely oxidized with age but

423

oxidized in cataracts, and also associated with cataract severity (Cys154 in γC, Cys117 in

424

βA1/3, Cys115, and Cys130 in γS, Cys33 in γD, Cys42 and Cys78/ Cys79 in γC).

425
426

Wang et al. (2017) (22) extented their previous study (Fan et al. 2015) in order to identify all

427

noncrystallin disulfides that are common to human and LEGSKO mouse cataracts and in their

428

in vitro oxidation, the sites and patterns of these cysteine residues that are oxidized during

429

aging and oxidation, and the potential impact on lens biology based on their molecular

430

functions. Their results showed that enzymes with oxidized cysteine at critical sites included

431

GAPDH (hGAPDH, Cys247), glutathione synthase (hGSS, Cys294), aldehyde dehydrogenase

432

(hALDH1A1, Cys126 and Cys186), sorbitol dehydrogenase (hSORD, Cys140, Cys165, and

433

Cys179), and PARK7 (hPARK7, Cys46 and Cys53). They stated that extensive oxidation was

434

also present in lens-specific intermediate filament proteins, such as BFSP1 and BFSP12

435

(hBFSP1 and hBFSP12, Cys167, Cys65, and Cys326), vimentin (mVim, Cys328),

436

cytokeratins, the majority of which were positively associated with degrees of cataract

437

severity (Cys51, Cys77, and Cys474 in keratin 6A; Cys42 and Cys489 in keratin 2; Cys25,

438

Cys66, and Cys427 in keratin 10; Cys55 and Cys474 in keratin 5; Cys432 in keratin 9; Cys40,

439

Cys18, and Cys389 in keratin 14; and Cys49 and Cys497 in keratin 1), as well as

440

microfilament and microtubule filament proteins, such as tubulin and actins.

Discussion

444
445

Summary of evidence

446

Deamidation was found to be the major age-related PTM and large numbers of asparagine and

447

glutamine sites were found to be significantly more deamidated in the water-insoluble

448

proteins of aged lenses. Some crystallins from older lenses contained sites were almost totally

449

deamidated, including βA1/A3-, βA4-, γS-, and γD-crystallins. Some sites showed increased

450

levels of deamidation in ARNC cataractous lenses. No significant difference in the extent of

451

Gln92 and Gln170 deamidation of αΑ-crystalin in D-isoAsp58 between cataract and age-

452

matched normal lenses.

453

There was a significant increase in the amount of αΑ-crystalin in D-isoAsp58 present at all

454

ages. This was most evident during the early years, when age-related cataract is first

455

observed.

456

An increase in the extent of Trp oxidation was apparent in cataract lenses when compared to

457

aged normal lenses. No phosphorylated Ser residues were detected in αB-crystallin from the

458

cataract lenses, whereas up to four were observed in the young and aged normal lens samples.

459

Οne new βB1-crystallin truncation was identified in both the aged normal and cataract lenses.

460

No Arg+55 Da modifications were detected in the cataract lenses.

461

Twenty-two previously unreported proteins were identified in normal aged and 29 in cataract

462

lenses. Phakinin, protein DJ-1 and phosphoglycerate kinase 1, where both cataract and aged

463

normal lenses had greater relative abundance comparing to foetal lenses. Several proteins had

464

a high abundance in the foetal lens group but a much reduced level in both adult lens groups,

465

including betaine– homocysteine S-methyltransferase 1, bA2-crystallin, bB3-crystallin, gC-

466

crystallin, glycer-aldehyde- 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, per oxiredoxin-6 and vimentin.

468

human and LEGSKO Mouse Lens Crystallins.

469

Four types of cysteine residues were identified based on their susceptibility to oxidation with

470

age and as a function of presence and severity of cataract graded from II to V. The first

471

includes cysteine residues that are mildly oxidized with age and not further oxidized in

472

cataracts; the second includes cysteine residues with mild oxidation in old normal lenses but

473

massive increase in cataracts regardless of cataract severity; the third includes cysteine

474

residues with oxidation in old normal lenses and further increase in cataract lenses, and the

475

fourth includes cysteine residues that are barely oxidized with age but oxidized in cataracts,

476

and also associated with cataract severity.

477

Enzymes with oxidized cysteine at critical sites included GAPDH, glutathione synthase,

478

aldehyde dehydrogenase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, and PARK7. They stated that extensive

479

oxidation was also present in lens-specific intermediate filament proteins, such as BFSP1 and

480

BFSP12, vimentin, cytokeratins, the majority of which were positively associated with

481

degrees of cataract severity, as well as microfilament and microtubule filament proteins, such

482

as tubulin and actins.

Limitations

485

The present systematic review should be interpreted within the context of its strengths and

486

limitations.

487

Outcome level: The main limitation of this systematic review is that the outcome of interest is

488

not the same across studies.

489

Study and review level: Our study has some limitations. The quality of the included studies

490

showed a low risk of bias although four studies included a small number of subjects/lenses.

491

However, all studies used proteomic analysis that has a tremendous favorable potential for

492

detecting candidate proteins and, so, facilitating the development of precision medicine for

493

diseases such as age-related cataract.

494
495

Conclusion

496

The results of Hooi et al. showed that in the case of Gln92 and Gln170, the degree of

497

deamidation did not differ significantly between cataract and age-matched normal lenses and

498

this may suggest that these particular modifications may contribute to age-related changes to

499

the physical properties of the human lens, but not to cataractogenesis. Their result that there is

500

a consistently greater extent of deamidation of Asn 76 in γS-crystallin in all cataract lenses

501

compared with their age-matched controls, suggests that this modification, along with others,

502

such as deamidation at Asn 14 and Gln16, could be associated with the development of age-

503

related cataract in human. In addition to this, there was a consistently greater formation of D-

504

isoAsp in αA crystalline from cataract lenses compared with age-matched normal lenses,

505

suggesting that it could as well be associated with the development of age-related cataract in

506

human. Such a dominant age-related modification may contribute to the denaturation of a

507

crystallin, and its ability to act as a chaperone.

508

Based on the results from their proteome analysis of human foetal, aged and advanced nuclear

509

cataract lenses, Hains and Truscott suggested there are no major differences between aged

510

normal and advanced cataract lenses in terms of proteins present.

511

The results of their other study showed that the level of Trp oxidation appeared to increase in

512

cataract lenses when these were compared to age-matched normal lenses and this may

513

indicate that oxidation of Trp may be associated with nuclear cataract formation in man.

514

Deamidation appears to be important for protein denaturation in the aging lens and it is

515

possible that the few sites they observed to be differentially deamidated in cataractous lenses

516

may be sufficient to cause opacification.

517

The results of Wilmarth et al. show that large numbers of asparagine and glutamine sites were

518

significantly more deamidated in the water-insoluble proteins of aged lenses, and since

519

cataract can be thought of as a crystallin insolubility disease, modifications exclusively

520

associated with water-insoluble proteins may have implications in cataract formation.

521

Finally, the results of Wang et al. and fan et al. support the important role of oxidant stress in

522

age-related cataract formation, and in particular, the importance of GSH and that

523

pharmacological GSH mimetics are probably needed to protect the aging lens from oxidation.
