Title: Gait differences in people with multiple sclerosis who have low or high levels of disability

2

Abstract:

3

Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) often results in gait impairment and disability.

4

Objective: To investigate differences in spatiotemporal gait characteristics of people with MS

5

who have low versus high levels of disability. Between trial and inter-limb consistency and the

6

association of gait variables with level of disability were also investigated.

7

Methods: Participants with MS who had either low-disability [n=7; 3 females; EDSS mean:

8

2.7±0.5, range 2.0-4.5; BMI=26.9±6.6] or high-disability [n=11; 6 females; EDSS mean:

9

2.7±0.5, range 6.0-6.5; BMI=27.8±1.5) performed 2 trials of self-selected walking on an

10

instrumented walkway. Differences in group, limb, and group by limb interactions were assessed

11

using analysis of variance, independent-measures t-tests, and Cohen’s d effect sizes (ES).

12

Between-trial consistency of gait were assessed with intra-class correlation coefficients (2, k).

13

Results: Participants in the high disability group had increased step time (ES=0.8), cycle time

14

(ES=0.8), and ambulation time (ES=1.2) while taking shorter strides (ES=0.9) and more steps at

15

a slower rate (ES=1.1). The high disability group demonstrated less between-trial consistency for

16

69% of gait variables when compared to the low disability group.

17

Conclusion: People with MS who have high levels of disability walk differently and with less

18

consistency than those with lower levels of disability.

22

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a degenerative, autoimmune disorder that affects the central

23

nervous system of approximately 400,000 individuals in the United States (Anderson et al.,

24

1992) and usually manifests in the second to third decade of life.(Noseworthy et al., 2000)

25

People with MS walk differently when compared to healthy individuals due to neurological

26

impairment. They walk at slower velocities with an increased cadence, (Benedetti et al., 1999;

27

Givon, Zeilig & Achiron, 2009; Sacco et al., 2011; Sosnoff et al., 2011; Sosnoff, Sandroff &

28

Motl, 2012; Socie et al., 2013; Lizrova Preiningerova et al., 2015) demonstrate shorter step

29

length,(Givon, Zeilig & Achiron, 2009; Sosnoff et al., 2011; Socie et al., 2013; Lizrova

30

Preiningerova et al., 2015) and stride length,(Benedetti et al., 1999; Sacco et al., 2011) and a

31

wider base of support.(Givon, Zeilig & Achiron, 2009; Sosnoff et al., 2011; Socie et al., 2013)

32

People with MS also take longer to complete a single step (Givon, Zeilig & Achiron, 2009;

33

Sosnoff et al., 2011; Socie et al., 2013; Lizrova Preiningerova et al., 2015) and to complete a gait

34

cycle.(Benedetti et al., 1999; Sacco et al., 2011) They spend more time in periods of

35

single(Sacco et al., 2011) and double limb support,(Benedetti et al., 1999; Sacco et al., 2011;

36

Lizrova Preiningerova et al., 2015) and a decreased percentage of the gait cycle in swing

37

phase.(Sosnoff et al., 2011) Sacco and colleagues (2011) also observed increased stride to stride

38

variability in individuals with MS. Gait changes have been observed in individuals with MS

39

who have varying degrees of impairment, with individuals with higher impairment

40

demonstrating decreased gait velocity, step length, and step time and increased periods in double

41

limb support.(Lizrova Preiningerova et al., 2015)

42

Clinically, the degree to which an individual is neurologically impaired and disabled is

43

rated using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).(Kurtzke, 1983) The EDSS is a

44

ranking of disability ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death) determined by physical examination

45

findings.(Kurtzke, 1983) The distance a person with MS can walk without rest breaks, support,

46

or reliance on an assistive device (AD) are substantial factors in determination of the EDSS

47

score.(Kurtzke, 1983) An EDSS score of 0 is representative of a normal neurological

48

examination and full function. As the EDSS score increases to 5.5, the ability to walk distances

49

without an AD is diminished to 100-m without rests or support. At an EDSS score of 6.0, the

50

patient is dependent on a unilateral AD to walk 100-m without rests. While previous studies on

51

the effect of AD use on spatiotemporal gait variables in participants with MS were performed

52

using individuals who were relatively high functioning (median EDSS=4.8),(Gianfrancesco et

53

al., 2011) further study is needed in participants with higher levels of disability. The purpose of

54

this cross-sectional study was to investigate differences in spatiotemporal gait characteristics of

55

people with MS who have low versus high levels of disability. Between trial and inter-limb

56

consistency of these gait variables and the association of gait variables with level of disability

57

were also investigated.

METHODS
Design
A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted using a sample of convenience of

62

participants with MS in which the independent variables were group [mild to moderate (low)

63

disability, high-disability] and lower limb (left, right) and the dependent variables were

64

spatiotemporal gait parameters.

65

Participants

66

Twenty-one participants diagnosed with MS were recruited from an MS Care Center.

67

Sample size calculations estimated that 5 participants per group were needed to demonstrate

68

large effect sizes for spatiotemporal gait variables in this population.(Benedetti et al., 1999) Prior

69

to recruitment, a physical examination was performed by a board-certified neurologist who

70

determined EDSS scores. Participants met inclusion criteria if they scored between 2.0 and 6.5

71

on the EDSS; demonstrated pyramidal or cerebellar symptoms on physical exam; and could

72

ambulate at least 20 meters with or without an AD and/or orthotics. Group assignment was

73

determined by EDSS score.(Kurtzke, 1983) Participants with mild to moderate disability (EDSS

74

2.0-4.5), who were able to walk 300-m without aid or rests, were assigned to the low-disability

75

group.(Kurtzke, 1983) Participants with severe disability (EDSS 6.0-6.5), who relied on an AD

76

to walk at least 20-meters, were assigned to the high-disability group.(Kurtzke, 1983)

77

Participants were excluded if they were cognitively impaired and unable to follow instructions,

78

pregnant, or had any medical condition that would substantially impair their ability to walk.

79

Participants who met inclusion criteria provided informed consent and the study was approved

80

by the Institutional Review Board at the College of Staten Island, City University of New York.

81

Procedures

82

All data collection was performed mid-morning to mitigate the effects of fatigue

83

commonly experienced by individuals with MS later in the day. Following enrollment,

84

participants provided demographic information and height, mass and leg length were measured.

85

Following familiarization with testing procedures, the subject walked the length of the

86

instrumented walkway at a self-selected pace utilizing the AD they depended on for ambulation.

87

Spatiotemporal gait parameters were collected using the GAITRite Walkway System (CIR

88

Systems Inc., Clifton, NJ), a portable instrumented 8.3 m x 0.9 m mat which contains imbedded

89

pressure-activated sensors and collects data at a sampling rate of 80 Hz. The GAITRite Walkway

90

system has been shown to be both valid and reliable in the assessment of spatiotemporal gait

91

parameters in adults with and without neurological deficit.(Nelson et al., 2002; Bilney, Morris &

92

Webster, 2003; Menz et al., 2004) Two walking trials were performed at a self-selected pace

93

separated by a 10-minute rest period.

94

Data Processing

95

Spatiotemporal gait variables were processed using the GAITRite software package (CIR

96

Systems Inc., Clifton, NJ). Prior to export of data from each trial, pressure readings introduced

97

by an AD were deleted from each trial using the software footfall editor. The main outcome

98

measures were spatial gait variables [Functional Ambulation Profile (FAP), a composite measure

99

of gait performance(Gouelle, 2014)], gait velocity, cadence, step count, step length, stride length,

100

width of base of support, toe out] and temporal gait variables (ambulation time, step time, cycle

101

time, percent of gait cycle in swing and stance phase, stance time, and percentage of gait cycle in

102

single and double limb support). Gait variable data represent the average of all footfalls across

103

two walking trials.

104

Statistical Analysis

105

Descriptive statistics were calculated for participant demographic and gait data. Group

106

differences were assessed using the point estimate and 90% confidence intervals (CI) of the

107

mean. Differences in group, limb, and group by limb interactions for gait variables that were

108

limb specific (normalized step and stride length, base of support, toe out, step and cycle time,

109

swing and stance %, and single and double limb support %) were assessed using a mixed

110

factorial ANOVA. Independent measures t-tests were conducted for the dependent variables of

111

FAP score, step count, cadence, normalized velocity, base of support, and ambulation time.

112

Cohen’s d effect size (ES) point estimates and associated 90% CI were calculated to estimate the

113

magnitude and precision of group differences. Effect sizes were interpreted ≥0.80 as large, 0.50-

0.79 as moderate, 0.20-0.49 as small.(Cohen, 2013) Association of level of disability (AD use,

115

EDSS score) to each gait variable was assessed using Spearman's  correlation coefficient;

116

interpreted ≥.75 as good to excellent, .50-74 moderate to good, .25-.49 fair, and 0-.25 little to no

117

association.(Portney & Watkins, 2009) Consistency of gait trials for the low-disability and high-

118

disability groups was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC, 2,k) and standard

119

error of measurement. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences

120

Version 23.0 (IBM, Inc., Armonk, New York, IL). The a priori level of statistical significance

121

was set at p ≤0.05 for all analyses.

122
123

RESULTS

124
125

The principle findings of this study were that there were differences in spatiotemporal

126

gait variables in participants with MS who had high compared to low levels of disability and that

127

there was an association between gait variables and level of disability.

128

Twenty-one adult participants with MS (10 males, 11 females) met criteria for inclusion

129

in the study. Data from 18 participants (9 males, 9 females) were available for analysis.

130

Participant demographic data are detailed in Table 1. One participant in the low-disability group

131

and all participants in the high-disability group utilized an AD for walking trials. There were no

132

significant differences between groups for age, BMI, or leg length. Gait data from three

133

participants was corrupted and was excluded from analysis.

134

Group means, standard deviations, range, group main effect, limb main effect, group by

135

limb interactions, and independent samples t-test results for spatiotemporal gait parameters are

136

detailed in Table 2. Participants in the high disability group took significantly more steps

137

(p=0.04) and required more time to walk along the 8.3-m walkway (p=0.02) than those in the

138

low disability group. There were no other significant main effects for group, limb, or group by

139

limb interactions.

140

Cohen’s d ES point estimates and 90% CI comparing spatiotemporal gait variables in the

141

high versus low disability group are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. Participants with high

142

disability took a longer time to complete a single step with the left foot (d=0.8), utilizing shorter

143

stride lengths with the left leg (d=0.9). They took more steps (d=1.1) at a slower rate (d=1.1) and

144

required more time to complete a gait cycle (Rt d=0.8, Lt d=0.9) and to walk the 8.3 m distance

145

(d=1.0). While not statistically different, there was a trend toward decreased FAP scores (d=0.6),

146

decreased normalized velocity (d=0.6), decreased normalized right stride length (d=0.7),

147

decreased percentage of the gait cycle in swing phase (Rt d=0.7), increased right step time

148

(d=0.8), increased percentage of the gait cycle spent in stance phase (Rt d=0.7), increased base of

149

support (d=0.6), and increased periods of double limb support (Rt d=0.7, Lt d=0.8) observed in

150

the high disability group (Figs. 1 & 2). These measures had moderate to large ES estimates, but

151

with CI that crossed the ‘0’ threshold indicating statistical equivalence.

152

In the low disability group, between-trial consistency was excellent for FAP scores,

153

cadence, normalized velocity, limb dependent and total base of support, cycle time, and double

154

limb support %, and fair to good for step count, ambulation time, and toe out (Table 3). The low

155

disability group demonstrated variability between left and right lower limbs for normalized step

156

and stride length, step time, swing %, stance %, and single limb support %. In the high-disability

157

group, between-trial consistency was excellent for FAP scores, step count, and normalized stride

158

length; fair to good for cadence, limb dependent and total base of support, toe out, ambulation

159

time, step time, cycle time, swing %, and stance %; and poor for normalized step length. Inter-

160

limb (left versus right) variability was noted in the high disability group for single limb support

161

% and double limb support %.

162

Associations between level of disability and gait variables are detailed in Table 4.

163

Significant moderate to good associations were observed for use of an AD with step time, gait

164

cycle time, and cadence. Association of higher disability, as measured by EDSS score, ranged

165

from moderate to excellent for cadence, normalized stride length, ambulation time, step time,

166

cycle time and percentage of time spent in double limb support.

168

DISCUSSION

169
170

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine inter-limb spatiotemporal gait

171

variables and consistency of gait in participants with MS with low versus high levels of

172

disability.

173

Gait differences

174

Our findings are consistent with results of previously published studies. Sosnoff and

175

colleagues (2012) found that people with mild MS walked slower, with fewer, shorter and wider

176

steps, and spent more time in double limb support than healthy controls. However, they did not

177

compare these findings to participants with high disability.(Sosnoff, Sandroff & Motl, 2012) In

178

another study, Sosnoff and colleagues (2011) found that MS participants with severe disability

179

walked slower, took shorter steps and spent more time in double limb support when completing a

180

cognitive task than participants with mild to moderate disability. Lizrova-Preiningerova and

181

colleagues (2015) demonstrated that participants with MS with high disability walked slower and

182

exhibited decreased step length, increased step time, and increased double limb support

183

compared to individuals with MS with lower levels of disability. Although we did demonstrate a

184

significant difference in step count and ambulation time between low and high disability groups

185

in the present study, the differences found in gait velocity did not reach statistical significance.

186

The larger sample size in the study conducted by Lizrova-Preiningerova and collegaues (Lizrova

187

Preiningerova et al., 2015) may account for their finding of decreasing gait velocity with

188

increasing EDSS scores.

189

The present study adds to these previous findings by also documenting inter-limb gait

190

differences in individuals with low versus high levels of MS disability. Although there was no

191

main effect for limb or group by limb interactions observed, there were significant differences

192

noted in the ES for certain gait variables in one limb (shorter left stride length and longer left

193

step time) and statistical equivalence in the contralateral limb. Wide CI observed in ES estimates

194

may narrow with a larger sample size, demonstrating more distinct differences between groups

195

for these gait variables. Knowledge of inter-limb differences in gait variables may be clinically

196

meaningful information for physical therapists conducting gait training with these patients. For

197

example, therapists could specifically address these inter-limb differences with therapeutic

198

exercise or locomotor training to improve overall gait pattern consistency.

199

Previous studies have found that asymmetric lower extremity motor impairment of

200

participants with MS adversely affects gait performance.(Chung et al., 2008; Sandroff, Sosnoff

201

& Motl, 2013) High variability in many spatial and temporal gait parameters was observed in

202

both disability groups in the present study. Socie and colleagues (2013) found decreased gait

203

velocity, shorter step lengths, and increased step length variability in participants with MS who

204

had higher disability compared to controls. Sosnoff and colleagues (2012) observed that

205

participants with mild MS demonstrated greater step time variability and single support time

206

variability than healthy, matched controls. Lizrova-Preiningerova and colleagues (2015)

207

suggested that gait variability was not associated with level of disability in individuals with MS

208

and may not be an appropriate outcome measure. However, the gait variability observed in the

209

present study and in others indicates that this may be an appropriate measure of MS gait and an

210

appropriate measure to use in intervention studies.(Sosnoff et al., 2011; Socie et al., 2013)

211

Consistency of Gait Parameters between Trials and between Limbs

212

Both groups showed consistency of gait parameters between trials, but the low disability

213

group was more consistent. Participants in the low disability group were more consistent in

214

cadence, cycle time, base of support, percent of the gait cycle spent in stance and swing in the

215

left leg, and in double limb support compared to participants in the high disability group. This is

216

in contrast to the fair consistency observed in the high-disability group for % of the gait cycle

217

spent in swing and stance phase. Socie and colleagues (2013) reported that participants with MS

218

had greater variability in step and stride length compared to healthy controls and that variability

219

increased with use of an AD. Inter-limb differences in consistency of normalized step length

220

were observed in the present study in participants with high disability. This phenomenon was

221

also observed for cadence, base of support, cycle time, and double limb support %, findings

222

unique to this study. It is not surprising that individuals with higher levels of disability

223

demonstrate less consistency and gait rehabilitation could be aimed at methods to specifically

224

reduce between trial and inter-limb variability.

Association of Gait Impairment and Disability
Assistive device use had a moderate to good association with cadence, step time and
cycle time. Disability, as qualified by EDSS scores, had a strong association with gait cycle time

229

and moderate to good association with cadence, ambulation time, step time, and double limb

230

support %. Givon and colleagues (2009) found that EDSS score had a moderate to good

231

association with FAP score, gait velocity, total base of support, and double limb support % in

232

individuals with MS. Only the latter (double limb support %) was consistent with our results.

233

Socie and colleagues (2013) found excellent association of EDSS score with gait velocity and

234

moderate to good association with step length and step time. We demonstrated that those with

235

higher disability took longer to walk than those with lower levels of disability, however,

236

normalized velocity was not statistical significance. The disparate findings across these studies

237

may be attributed to the heterogeneity of neurologic impairment unique to MS, which may

238

manifest very differently between participants.

239

Clinical Implications

240

Use of an instrumented walkway, in addition to observational gait analysis, may provide

241

more objective information about spatiotemporal gait parameters in individuals with MS.

242

Knowledge of MS gait patterns, particularly distinguishing those with low versus high disability,

243

may allow physical therapists to tailor rehabilitation to patient’s individualized needs. Based on

244

the findings of our study, clinicians evaluating patients with MS with higher levels of disability

245

should consider assessing for and providing gait training to address changes in velocity, cadence,

246

stride length, base of support, and proportion of time spent in stance and swing phase of gait.

247

Assessment of consistency between walking trials and inter-limb consistency may also provide

248

important insight into the patient’s ability to safely and efficiently execute the motor task of

249

walking. Interventions to address spasticity and impaired lower extremity strength, power,

250

endurance, and balance and providing appropriate assistive devices may help improve gait in

251

these patients.(Lord, Wade & Halligan, 1998; Gutierrez et al., 2005; Chung et al., 2008;

252

Cameron & Wagner, 2011; Sandroff, Sosnoff & Motl, 2013) Additionally, differences in gait

253

parameters amongst individuals with low versus high MS disability should be considered when

254

designing clinical trials.

255

Study Limitations

256

The current study has some limitations. The authors relied on the EDSS score as the

257

primary measure of disability, with additional delimitations of pyramidal or cerebellar deficit.

258

Thus, participants assigned to each group were heterogeneous in presentation with possible

259

differences in how they walked. This is evident in the wide CIs observed in the ES graphs in

260

Figs. 1 and 2. For future research, we recommend that investigators who study individuals with

261

MS with varying degrees of disability consider utilizing a patient reported outcome measure

262

validated for use with this population, such as the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale,(Schäffler et

263

al., 2013) to further qualify level of disability. Larger sample sizes and assessment of slow and

264

fast walking speeds are required to demonstrate definitive group differences and provide further

265

information about gait patterns in people with MS.

266
267

CONCLUSIONS

268
269

Individuals with MS who have high levels of disability walk differently and with less

270

consistency than those with lower levels of disability. Differences between left and right lower

271

limbs were observed for certain gait variables and a high level of gait variability within groups

272

and between gait trials were observed. Higher levels of disability were associated with shorter

273

steps, decreased cadence, increased time in double limb support, greater gait variability and

274

increased step time and gait cycle time. Clinically, it is important to delineate patients with MS

who have low versus high levels of disability when examining gait and in order to provide

276

tailored interventions to improve walking. More objective and longitudinal investigation of

277

changes in gait characteristics of individuals with MS is needed to determine the most

appropriate interventions at each stage of the disease.
