ABSTRACT

30

In a case-control study of patients with C. difficile infection we found no statistically significant association

31

between the presence of trehalose utilization variants in infecting C. difficile strains and development of

32

severe infection. These results do not support trehalose utilization conferring enhanced virulence in the

33

context of human C. difficile infections.

INTRODUCTION
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a health care-associated infection that can result in a range

59

of patient outcomes. Of greatest concern is the development of severe disease, defined as intensive care

60

unit admission, intraabdominal surgery (such as colectomy), and/or death attributable to the infection[1].

61

Specific patient factors such as age, antibiotic use, and female gender have been associated with severe

62

infection. The genetic background of the infecting C. difficile isolate may also influence clinical outcome.

63

Prior studies reported an increased risk of severe infection for ribotypes RT027 and RT078[2,3]. One

64

recently proposed mechanism for increased virulence of specific C. difficile lineages is the differential

65

capacity to utilize the dietary disaccharide trehalose[4]. These authors observed enhanced trehalose

66

utilization in strains of both RT027 and RT078, and demonstrated increased virulence of an RT027 strain

67

in a mouse model of infection when physiologically relevant quantities of trehalose were given. This report

68

also noted the coincidence between the introduction of trehalose as a food additive in 2000 and the global

69

emergence of RT027 and RT078 shortly thereafter.

70

Subsequently, Eyre et al. examined clinical C. difficile isolates for the ability to use trehalose,

71

noting that variants conferring improved trehalose utilization were not confined to successful epidemic

72

lineages. Moreover, Eyre et al. found no evidence of association between a trehalose utilization variant

73

and 30-day all-cause mortality in RT015, a ribotype in which enhanced trehalose utilization is variably

74

present[5]. Here, we set out to more comprehensively evaluate the potential contribution of trehalose

75

utilization to clinical outcomes by quantifying the independent contribution of trehalose utilization variants

76

to infection severity across ribotypes, when controlling for all clinical factors independently associated

77

with risk for severe infection.

METHODS

80

Study population

81

All subjects signed written consent to participate in this study. This study was approved by the

82

University of Michigan Institutional Review Board (Study HUM33286). We considered a cohort of 1144

83

cases of CDI from hospitalized adults diagnosed with CDI between October 2010 and January 2013 at

84

the University of Michigan Health System[2]. The following predictors of severe outcome were noted in

85

the window 24-48 hours post CDI diagnosis: age, gender, metastatic cancer, concurrent antibiotic use,

86

systolic blood pressure, creatinine, bilirubin, and white blood cell count. Of the 981 unique patients, 898

87

had complete clinical information. CDI was classified as severe if any of the following outcomes

88

attributable to CDI occurred within 30 days of diagnosis: admission to an intensive care unit,

89

intraabdominal surgery, or death[1]. Ribotyping was performed and 137 ribotypes were identified

90

(Supplementary Table 1).

91

Data analysis

92

Summary statistics, matching, modeling, and imputation were conducted in R version 3.5.0[6]. The R

93

code is available at: github.com/katiesaund/clinical_cdifficile_trehalose_variants.

94

Severe Outcome Risk Score Matching Unique subjects with complete clinical information (N=898) were

95

assigned a severe outcome risk score based on a logistic regression model with severe CDI outcome as

96

the response variable and the following predictors: age (years), female gender, metastatic cancer,

97

concurrent antibiotic use, systolic blood pressure (mm Hg), creatinine (>1.5 mg/dL), bilirubin (>1.2

98

mg/dL), and white blood cell count (cells/µL)[7]. Where possible, isolates were sorted into strata, each

99

with exactly one case (severe CDI outcome) and at least one and up to four controls (non-severe CDI

100

outcome), with control scores within ± 0.10 of case score. The matching process identified N=323 CDI

101

cases isolates, of which only N=247 C. difficile isolates were successfully grown, isolated, and

102

sequenced. Due to growth or sequencing failures only N=235 isolates were from N=59 complete strata

103

(strata with at least one control and one case).

104

Conditional logistic regression model for matched samples Logistic regressions were modeled with

105

severe CDI outcome as the response variable, conditioned on strata, and a trehalose variant as the

106

predictor. Bonferroni corrected P-values were reported.

107

Genomic Analysis

Genomic DNA extracted with the MoBio PowerMag Microbial DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen) from C.

109

difficile isolates (N=247) was prepared for sequencing using the Illumina Nextera DNA Flex Library

110

Preparation Kit. Sequencing was performed on either an Illumina HiSeq 4000 System at the University of

111

Michigan Advanced Genomics Core or on an Illumina MiSeq System at the University of

112

Michigan Microbial Systems Molecular Biology Laboratories. Quality of reads was assessed with

FastQC[8]. Adapter sequences and low-quality bases were removed with Trimmomatic[9]. Details on

114

sequenced strains are available in Table S1. Sequence data are available under Bioproject

115

PRJNA561087. For variant calling details see the Supplementary Methods. Pangenome analysis was

116

performed with roary[10] and the insertion putatively conferring enhanced trehalose utilization was

117

inferred based on the presence of four genes: treA2, ptsT, treX, and treR2 (Supplementary File 1).

RESULTS

120

Given the limited clinical data regarding the potential contribution of trehalose utilization variants

121

to CDI severity, we set out to test for an association between trehalose utilization across all strains of C.

122

difficile causing infection while comprehensively controlling for patient factors associated with severe

123

outcome. Patient factors associated with CDI severity in our clinical cohort (N=1144) were age, female

124

gender, metastatic cancer, concurrent antibiotic use, systolic blood pressure, creatinine, bilirubin, and

125

white blood cell count[2]. To quantify the independent contribution of trehalose utilization variants to

126

severe patient outcomes we implemented a retrospective, matched case-control study to control for these

127

patient factors. Each C. difficile episode was assigned a severe outcome risk score utilizing variables

128

available around the time of diagnosis, which is the patient’s predicted probability of having severe CDI,

129

based on a logistic regression model of CDI built from the eight patient factors. Unique patients were

130

grouped into strata based on their risk score. Each stratum contained one case (N=59, severe CDI

131

outcome) and up to four controls (N=176, non-severe CDI outcome; total N=235). The median number of

132

controls per case was 3 (range, 1-4). There were 61 RT027 isolates (19/59 cases; 46/176 controls), 5

133

RT078 isolates (0/59 cases; 5/176 controls), and only 1 RT015 (1/59 cases; 0/176 controls) in this

134

matched data set.

135

All of the C. difficile isolates in the matched data set with complete strata were sequenced

136

(N=235). We identified the presence of reported trehalose utilization variants: two amino acid

137

substitutions in the transcriptional repressor, treR, (TreR C171S and TreR L172I) and a set of four

138

accessory genes, called the four gene trehalose insertion, that contain an additional phosphotrehalase

139

enzyme and transcriptional regulator[4,11]. Consistent with previous reports, we found TreR C171S in all

140

4 RT017 isolates and 3 closely related ribotypes (Figure 1). Similarly, we found TreR L172I in all 61

141

RT027 isolates and in 7 closely related ribotypes. However, in contrast to Collins et al. who found the four

142

gene trehalose insertion only in RT078, we identified the insertion in 25 isolates that were broadly

143

distributed across the phylogeny[4].

144

To investigate if trehalose utilization variants were individually associated with severe CDI

145

outcome, we performed unadjusted logistic regressions conditioned on severe outcome risk strata (Table

146

S2). The presence of the TreR L172I trehalose utilization variant was associated with an increased, but

147

not statistically significant, odds of severe CDI outcome (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 0.84-3.05; P=0.52). The

148

presence of the four gene trehalose insertion was associated with decreased, but not statistically

149

significant odds of a severe CDI outcome (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.09-1.32; P=0.52). None of the other four

150

amino acid substitutions observed in TreR were significantly associated with severe CDI outcome (Table

151

S2). Due to low prevalence (N=7), we did not test for an association between the presence of the TreR

152

C171S trehalose utilization variant and severe CDI outcome.

153

To evaluate the overall effect of the three previously described trehalose utilization variants on CDI

154

outcome we combined the three variants into a single predictor of severe CDI outcome and performed a

155

logistic regression conditioned on severe outcome risk strata. When combined, the presence of any of the

156

three trehalose utilization variants does not significantly affect the odds of severe CDI outcome (OR, 1.10;

157

95%CI, 0.61-1.99; P=0.86). To evaluate whether these results translated to the original unmatched

158

cohort, we also tested for associations between trehalose utilization variants and severe infections using

159

severe risk score as a covariate rather than matching criterion. To determine trehalose utilization

160

genotypes in the larger cohort for which genomic data was unavailable, we performed an imputation

161

where the presence of trehalose utilization variants (TreR C171S, TreR L172I, and the four gene

162

trehalose insertion) was assumed to have the same distribution across ribotypes as was observed in the

163

matched cohort (see Supplementary Methods). We performed a logistic regression modeling severe

164

outcome with presence of any of the three trehalose utilization variants as a predictor and severe risk

165

score as a covariate. When combined, the presence of any of the three trehalose utilization variants does

166

not significantly affect the odds of severe CDI outcome (Median OR, 0.99; Range, 0.87-0.99; Median

167

P=0.97; Range, 0.64-0.99; N=586).

DISCUSSION
The ability to predict the clinical outcome of C. difficile infection based on patient and pathogen

171

characteristics could help guide therapy for this important nosocomial infection. An enhanced ability to

172

utilize trehalose was shown to be associated with increased virulence in mice, prompting us to evaluate

173

this relationship using a case-control study performed with a large clinical data set. Our controlled

174

analysis failed to detect a significant association between any of the previously described trehalose

175

utilization variants and severe CDI outcome. Our results from patients infected with a diversity of

176

ribotypes are consistent with Eyre et al.’s observed lack of association between the four gene trehalose

177

insertion and 30-day all-cause mortality specifically in patients infected with RT015. We also observed

178

that the four-gene trehalose insertion is not exclusive to RT078, but rather is found throughout the C.

179

difficile phylogeny.

180

The lack of association between trehalose utilization variants and severe CDI outcome in

181

hospitalized patients emphasizes the need to incorporate clinical results earlier into the genetic variant

182

discovery pipeline. Indeed, a more relevant hypothesis generating process could begin by identifying

183

genetic loci of interest first through comparative genomic analysis of clinical isolates followed by validation

184

in lab strains with molecular and animal studies. A critical component of this discovery work is to control

185

for both patient factors and strain background as both may confound analysis, which we did above in

186

separate analyses using two distinct modeling strategies. Given the association between ribotype, recent

187

acquisition, and CDI outcome, controlling for patient factors is critical for identifying the genetic variants

188

associated with severe CDI outcome[12].

189

While these clinical data cannot rule out a potential role of trehalose utilization variants in the

190

success of hypervirulent C. difficile lineages, they do emphasize the difference between human infection

191

and murine models. More broadly, generating hypotheses in controlled laboratory systems and having

192

them generalize to genetically and clinically heterogeneous human populations will limit insights to only

193

the most penetrant phenotypes. With increasing availability of electronic health record and microbial

194

genomic data, it is now becoming feasible to flip the script and generate hypotheses through analysis of

195

human data, which can subsequently be tested in appropriate animal and in vitro systems with a priori

196

knowledge of relevance to human disease.
