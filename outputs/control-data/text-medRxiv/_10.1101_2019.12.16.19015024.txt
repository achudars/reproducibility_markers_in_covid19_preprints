Abstract

16
17

Many cancer drugs only benefit a subset of the patients that receive them, but are often

18

associated with serious side effects. Predictive classification methods that can identify which

19

patients will benefit from a specific treatment are therefore of great clinical utility. We here

20

introduce a novel machine learning method to identify predictive gene expression signatures,

21

based on the idea that patients who received different treatments but exhibit similar expression

22

profiles can be used to model response to the alternative treatment. We use this method to

23

predict proteasome inhibitor benefit in Multiple Myeloma (MM). In a dataset of 910 MM patients

24

we identify a 14-gene expression signature that can successfully predict benefit to the

25

proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, with a hazard ratio of 0.47 (p = 0.04) in class ‘benefit’, while in

26

class ‘no benefit’ the hazard ratio is 0.91 (p = 0.68). Importantly, we observe a similar

27

classification performance (HR class benefit = 0.46, p = 0.04) in an independent patient cohort

28

which was moreover measured on a different platform, demonstrating the robustness of the

29

signature. Moreover, we find that the genes in the discovered signature are essential, as no

30

equivalent signature can be found when they are excluded from the analysis. Multiple genes in

31

the signature are linked to working mechanisms of proteasome inhibitors or MM disease

32

progression. In conclusion, our method allows for identification of gene expression signatures

33

that can aid in treatment decisions for MM patients and provide insight into the biological

34

mechanism behind treatment benefit.

38

For many anti-cancer drugs the response varies widely across patients. As many of these drugs

39

are associated with serious side effects, it is essential to identify which drug will maximally benefit

40

the patient. Tools that aid in such decisions, e.g. based on patient-derived genetic or

41

transcriptomic profiles have only been developed for a few treatments and diseases. Most efforts

42

in this direction focus on detecting specific mutations for which it is known that a targeted

43

therapy exists1. However, many patients do not carry any mutations that are known to be

44

actionable and in practice only 7% of patients can be matched to a targeted therapy with the

45

highest level of evidence2. Moreover, a range of efficacious therapies exist that are non-targeted

46

and can therefore not be matched to a specific mutation. Consequently, there is a clear clinical

47

utility for methods that can more generically predict - at the time of diagnosis - if a patient will

48

benefit from a certain treatment or not.

49
50

Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by a malignant proliferation of plasma cells, both in the

51

bone marrow and extramedullary sites. MM is considered incurable with a median survival of

52

approximately 6 years3. Several driver mutations have been identified in MM4, but in most

53

patients no actionable mutations are observed and targeted therapies are therefore not

54

commonly used in MM. Currently, proteasome inhibitors (PIs) are one of the most important

55

components of treatment in MM and since their introduction in the clinic survival has significantly

56

improved5. Since the immunoglobulin production of MM cells is higher than healthy plasma cells,

57

they are more reliant on proteasomal degradation of proteins, making them vulnerable to

58

proteasome inhibition6. After bortezomib, which was the first PI to be introduced in the clinic for

MM, second generation proteasome inhibitors like carfilzomib and ixazomib have recently been

60

approved.

61
62

Despite the success of PIs, there is still wide variability in PI response across patients. Substantial

63

efforts have been made to discover what distinguishes responders from non-responders. For

64

instance, several studies have implicated differential expression of genes involved in the

65

unfolded protein response7. Other studies describe complex changes in the entire energy

66

metabolism as a potential discriminating factor8. Several chromosomal aberrations have also

67

been found to influence bortezomib response, although this effect is still not fully understood

68

9,10. Despite all efforts, there is currently no biomarker capable of determining which patients

69

benefit from receiving a PI and which would not.

will

70
71

Most of the studies investigating PI response compare gene expression patterns of patients

72

responding well or poor to a certain treatment7, 11–13. The identified genes can then be combined

73

into a gene expression signature, which can be applied to classify newly diagnosed patients as

74

good or poor responders. However, a clinically more interesting question is whether a patient

75

will benefit more from a PI than from another treatment. This is a markedly different question

76

than identifying good and poor responders within one homogeneous treatment group. After all,

77

even patients with lower than average survival may still experience benefit from their treatment

78

as their outcome could have been even worse on another treatment. Conversely, a patient with

79

a good survival outcome, could have experienced an equivalently good or even better response

80

on any other treatment. As a result, it is impossible to assign patients to class ‘benefit’ or ‘no

81

benefit’ a priori, since response to another treatment cannot be observed. Therefore, standard

82

methods of identifying gene signatures and classifiers, which rely on the existence of such class

83

labels, are unsuitable for predicting treatment benefit.

84
85

In this work we propose a novel method, Simulated Treatment Learning signatures (STLsig), to

86

infer gene signatures that can predict treatment benefit for patients at the moment of diagnosis.

87

We apply STLsig to find a gene expression signature capable of identifying patients for whom

88

treatment with PIs results in better survival than treatment with an alternative treatment. First

89

and foremost, the gene signature should be capable of predicting PI benefit in an independent

90

patient cohort, a feat which has been shown challenging for prognostic classifiers 14 . A second

91

important objective of STLsig is to identify a simple, interpretable model which contains genes

92

that have biological relevance to the molecular mechanism underlying PI efficacy. To enable this,

93

we leverage the core concept of Simulated Treatment Learning (STL), which we proposed

94

previously15, that allows training classifiers without having a predefined labelling of patient in e.g.

95

a class ‘benefit’ and ‘no benefit’. However, while our previous method was successful in

96

identifying a model that can predict treatment benefit, these models rely on large numbers of

97

Gene Ontology sets together containing hundreds of genes. This makes interpretation of these

98

models complex. Moreover, many of the gene sets in the model can be removed without harming

99

performance, casting doubt on their importance in the molecular mechanism of PIs.

100
101

For these reasons we here propose a different approach which identifies small networks of genes

102

which can be used as a gene signature to predict PI benefit. To obtain a signature for treatment

103

benefit, we aim to form gene networks that combine genes that are complementary in their

104

ability to predict benefit. STLsig achieves this by assessing the predictive ability of all possible

105

pairs of genes and only combining those that achieve a better performance together than when

106

combined with other genes. STLsig is fully data driven and does not rely on any biological

107

knowledge or predefined gene networks as input.

108
109

We demonstrate the utility of STLsig on a 910 sample dataset combining three different Phase III

110

clinical trials with MM patients receiving either a treatment with or without the PI bortezomib

111

(from here on referred to as the HTT cohort). STLsig enables discovery of a 14-gene signature

112

that can accurately identify a subset of patients benefiting from bortezomib. We validate this

113

gene expression signature in independent data (the CoMMpass cohort) where we predict benefit

114

for bortezomib or an alternative PI, carfilzomib, demonstrating that the signature is robust and

115

generalizes to other data. Moreover, we established that the signature is unique, meaning that

116

when removed from the dataset no gene expression signature with a similar performance can be

117

found. The genes included in the signature are thus essential for predicting PI benefit. We find

118

that several of the genes in the signature are related to MM or the working mechanisms of PIs.

119

To our knowledge, this is the first approach capable of discovering treatment benefit specific

120

gene signatures without predefined labels.

125

STLsig relies on the idea that patients exhibiting similar gene expression profiles who received

126

different treatments, can be used to model response to the treatment they did not receive.

127

Similarity between patients needs to be defined by genes relevant to treatment benefit. STLsig

128

therefore derives treatment specific gene networks, which can be used to form a gene expression

129

signature capable of predicting treatment benefit. To train this signature we divide the HTT

130

cohort in a training set (n = 606) and a test set (Fold D, n = 304). The training set is further

131

subdivided into three equal parts, fold A, B and C. We then assess the ability to predict

132

bortezomib benefit for all 5,506,221 gene pairs arising from the genes with a high variance across

133

patients pre-treatment in the HTT training set (n = 3319).

134

For each patient j in fold A, we determine a z-score (zPFS) per gene pair describing the normalized

135

mean survival difference of patient j with its most similar neighbours in terms of gene expression

136

that received a different treatment than patient j. The survival difference is normalized to obtain

137

a z-score by comparing it to the survival difference found with randomly selected neighbours. A

138

z-score above 0 indicates a larger positive survival difference than expected, a score below 0 a

139

smaller difference. We then test the ability of the gene pair to predict the zPFS score for patients

140

in fold B. We also assess the performance of each gene pair when calculation of zPFS is performed

141

on Fold B and predicted on Fold A. Performance of each gene pair is defined as the mean

142

Spearman rank correlation coefficient between predicted and calculated zPFS values in both

143

folds. A gene pair is retained if it is synergistic, i.e. if the genes in the pair predict zPFS better

144

together than when they are paired with other genes.

145

We next form a consensus network by repeating the two-fold cross validation five times. Only

146

gene pairs that are found to be synergistic in all repeats and that exceed the median correlation

147

across all gene pairs and all repeats are retained. From this consensus network we extract gene

148

networks, i.e. all connected components.

149
150

A gene network can be used to classify patients by using its genes to recalculate a zPFS score for

151

each patient and classifying the top 25% of the patients as class ‘benefit’ and the rest as class ‘no

152

benefit’. To evaluate each gene network, we use this procedure to classify all patients in fold A

153

and B. Subsequently, gene networks are ranked based on the difference between the Cox

154

regression β’s found in class ‘benefit’ and class ‘no benefit’. To build the signature, we

155

sequentially add each network based on this ranking and evaluate the performance of the

156

combined networks on fold C. The different steps of the algorithm are summarized in Figure 1

157

and explained in detail in the Methods section.

158
159

Gene networks yield a 14-gene signature that can predict bortezomib benefit

160

The consensus network formed as described above contains 617 genes connected by 451 edges

161

and consists of 167 connected components, referred to as gene networks. Of these 167 gene

162

networks, 104 are individual gene pairs. The largest gene network contains 42 genes; the mean

163

number of genes per network is 3.7. We find that the optimal signature is formed by combining

164

the top two ranked gene networks, which are shown in Figure 2. Based on this signature we find

165

a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.49 (p = 0.09, 95% CI 0.22 - 1.11) in class ‘benefit’ (n = 50) and an HR of

166

0.91 (p = 0.74, 95% CI 0.54 - 1.55) in class ‘no benefit’ (n = 152), on fold C of the HTT cohort.

168

In clinical deployment of our classifier zPFS scores are not available, as survival of a patient is not

169

known at the moment of diagnosis. In order to assign a zPFS score to a new and unseen patient,

170

we calculate the distance in gene expression space between the new patient and every patient

171

in the training data, which we call the reference set. The predicted zPFS score of the new patient

172

is the weighted sum of the zPFS scores of the patients in the reference set. Weights are

173

determined by the inverse distance, i.e. more similar patients in the reference set contribute

174

most to the predicted zPFS for the new patient (see ‘Methods’ for details). In this manner, we

175

assess the ability of the 14-gene signature to predict benefit in unseen patients, using the 304

176

patients from the HTT cohort not included in training (Fold D). The HR in favour of bortezomib

177

found in the complete set of 304 patients is 0.75 (p = 0.11, 95% CI 0.53 - 1.06). Figure 3a shows

178

the HR in class benefit obtained using different zPFS thresholds. This shows that a range of

179

thresholds result in an HR below the HR observed in the total dataset, indicating that the

180

predicted zPFS is associated with bortezomib benefit. The optimal class ‘benefit’, i.e. the class

181

‘benefit’ formed when we select the threshold associated with the lowest HR, comprises 30.6%

182

of the patients which corresponds to a zPFS threshold of 0.326. Using this threshold to define

183

class ‘benefit’ we find an HR of 0.47 (p = 0.04, 95% CI 0.23 - 0.96) in class ‘benefit’ and an HR of

184

0.91 (p = 0.68, 95% CI 0.60 - 1.39) in class ‘no benefit’ (figure 3b). This establishes that our

185

signature can predict bortezomib benefit in unseen data from the same patient cohort,

186

demonstrating that the signature can be used prospectively to inform treatment choice. Our

187

results indicate that, despite the fact that nearly all MM patients receive a treatment regimen

188

that includes a PI5, approximately 70% of patients do not see benefit.

190

The 14-gene signature achieves robust prediction performance in an independent patient cohort

191

Gene expression signatures often suffer from cohort-specific fitting and cross-validation within

192

one dataset can thus lead to an overestimation of performance16. To obtain a more robust

193

estimate of performance it is essential to perform validation on an external and completely

194

independent cohort. Therefore, to assess the robustness of our signature, we validate its

195

performance in the CoMMpass trial (NCT145429), which represents a completely independent

196

patient cohort which was moreover profiled on a different platform (RNAseq). In contrast to the

197

HTT dataset, which is a randomized clinical trial, the CoMMpass dataset is an observational study.

198

In this study there is no interference with treatment choice and the treatment regimens present

199

in this study thus represent current clinical practice in MM. To bring the CoMMpass RNAseq data

200

in the same space as the microarray reference dataset, we employ a ComBat batch correction

201

(Supplementary Figure 2 and Methods). In the HTT cohort, bortezomib is the only PI used, but In

202

the CoMMpass cohort, two different PIs are used: bortezomib and carfilzomib. To assess the

203

ability of the signature to predict PI benefit, we define a PI treatment arm (n = 686) and a no PI

204

treatment arm (n = 61). When we classify these patients with the 14-gene signature using the

205

threshold optimized on fold D from the HTT cohort, we find an HR of 0.46 ( p = 0.04, 95% CI 0.22

206

- 0.97) in class ‘benefit’ (n = 150) and an HR of 0.79 (p = 0.2, 95% CI 0.55 - 1.13) in class ‘no

207

benefit’ (n = 597) (Figure 3c). Our signature is thus capable of predicting benefit in a completely

208

independent cohort and across platforms, indicating the signal picked up by our classifier is

209

robust and generalizes to the broader MM patient population.

211

We next assess the performance of the signature for each of the two PIs separately. The majority

212

of the patients in the PI treatment arm received bortezomib (n = 530), while 156 patients received

213

carfilzomib. In the dataset as a whole an HR of 0.75 (p = 0.09, 95% CI 0.54 - 1.04) in favor of

214

bortezomib is found, when compared with patients who did not receive a PI. An HR of 0.42 (p =

215

0.0004, 95% CI 0.26 - 0.68) is found in favor of carfilzomib. When we evaluate benefit for the

216

bortezomib patients only (excluding patients who received carfilzomib from the analysis), we find

217

an HR of 0.49 (p = 0.06, 95% CI 0.23 - 1.03) in class ‘benefit’ (n = 124) and an HR of 0.84 (p = 0.35,

218

95% CI 0.58 - 1.21) in class ‘no benefit’ (n = 467). When predicting benefit for the carfilzomib

219

patients only we find an HR of 0.31 (p = 0.06, 95% CI 0.09 - 1.02) in class ‘benefit’ (n = 38) and an

220

HR of 0.45 (p = 0.004, 95% CI 0.26 - 0.77) in class ‘no benefit’ (n =178). These results confirm that

221

our signature is capable of identifying a patient group with more benefit than the population as

222

a whole for each of the PIs separately. Nonetheless it should be noted that the carfilzomib ‘no

223

benefit’ class should rather be considered a ‘less benefit’ class, as a significant HR in favor of

224

treatment with carfilzomib remains, likely due to the highly significant overall carfilzomib HR

225

(0.42). We could not train a carfilzomib specific classifier, as it was absent in the HTT cohort and

226

sample size in CoMMpass is insufficient. Nevertheless, the observation that the bortezomib

227

derived signature can identify a patient group with substantially reduced HRs for carfilzomib

228

treated patients indicates that it is more broadly applicable to PIs in general and not only

229

bortezomib.

230
231

We observed that the number of patients classified as ‘benefit’ in the CoMMpass dataset is

232

somewhat lower than on the HTT dataset (20.1% of the patients compared to 30.6% of the

233

patients in fold D of the HTT cohort). When we calculate the HR on the CoMMpass dataset using

234

different zPFS thresholds to define class ‘benefit’, we find that for both bortezomib and

235

carfilzomib the class ‘benefit’ associated with the lowest HR contains approximately 30% of the

236

patients (Figure 3d,e), similar to what was observed in the HTT data. These results show that zPFS

237

score is also associated with benefit at different zPFS thresholds and suggests approximately 30%

238

of MM patients experience more benefit from PI treatment than the population as a whole.

239
240

Finally, we evaluated whether our model is specific to proteasome inhibitors and not more

241

generally predictive by testing its performance on lenalidomide, a drug with an

242

immunomodulatory mechanism. In the CoMMpass dataset, 411 patients received lenalidomide

243

and 336 did not (HR of 0.72 in favor of lenalidomide; p = 0.001, 95% CI 0.58 - 0.88). When we

244

define class ‘benefit’ according to the optimized zPFS threshold, 21.0% of patients are stratified

245

into the ‘benefit’ class. We find an HR of 0.80 (p = 0.35, 95% CI 0.51 - 1.27) in class ‘benefit’ (n =

246

150) and an HR of 0.68 (p = 0.001, 95% CI 0.54 - 0.86) in class ‘no benefit’ (n = 467), hence not

247

improving the HR observed in the lenalidomide dataset as a whole. This clearly shows the

248

signature is predictive specifically for PIs.

249
250

Selected genes and links between them are essential for performance

251

In the setting of prognostic classification in breast cancer, it is well known that, after removal of

252

the genes in the prognostic signature, a new signature can be found containing a completely

253

different set of genes, that performs equal to the original signature 17. This phenomenon casts

254

doubt on the value of interpreting the genes in the signature. If biological interpretation is the

goal, it is therefore important that no equally performing signature without these genes can be

256

found.

257
258

We first investigate the importance of the individual genes in benefit prediction. This is achieved

259

by permuting the expression vector for each gene in the signature 100 times (while the other 13

260

genes remain unchanged) and using this signature with one permuted gene to predict class

261

‘benefit’ in fold D of the HTT cohort. Figure 4a shows the mean reduction in HR in class ‘benefit’

262

after shuffling. These results indicate that each gene is important for the classification

263

performance. The largest effect is observed for DAB2IP, with a mean difference in validation HR

264

of 0.29 (se = 0.06). We also note that correlation between genes influence the decrease in

265

performance. For instance, while shuffling SHTN1 has the smallest impact on validation

266

performance, its expression is significantly correlated with more genes than any other gene (with

267

TPD52L1, NES and ST6GAL2, see Supplementary figure 3 for correlation matrices), and therefore

268

losing its information in the signature is less impactful. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate

269

that all individual genes are important for the validation performance, as none can be shuffled

270

without decreasing performance.

271
272

Next, we assess whether the relation between the genes, as captured in the edges of the inferred

273

network, are important for classifier performance. To this end, we shuffle the edges between all

274

genes in the network, while ensuring every gene remains linked to at least one other gene, and

275

then infer a signature with STLsig. This procedure is repeated 10 times. The mean HR found in

276

the hold out data in class ‘benefit’ is 0.74 (se = 0.05), which is approximately equal to the HR

277

found in the dataset without classification. This shows that, in addition to the individual genes,

278

also their connections are essential for the performance of the signature.

279
280

Lastly, we remove all 14 genes contained in the signature from the dataset and search for a new

281

signature by rerunning the entire STLsig approach. The new signature, which contains 312 genes

282

from 85 gene networks, results in an HR of 0.56 (p = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.23 - 1.41) in the training

283

data. This is a much worse HR than the original 14-gene signature. Also, the performance on the

284

patients in the independent Fold D, which requires optimizing a new zPFS threshold, yields a

285

worse performance (HR of 0.59; p = 0.06, 95% CI 0.34 - 1.01; n=130 in the ‘benefit’ class).

286

Moreover, changing this threshold to yield a differently sized class ‘benefit’ does not yield

287

performances that approach that of the original 14-gene signature (Supplementary Figure 1).

288
289

Together, these results establish that the 14 identified genes are essential to the performance of

290

the model. This is an important prerequisite for interpretability of the model; as this indicates

291

that the 14 genes may play a functional role in the proteasome inhibitor response.

292
293

Multiple signature genes are associated with MM or proteasome inhibition

294

Having established the genes in the signature are essential to the performance, we investigate

295

how the genes in the signature are involved in determining PI benefit. Interestingly, in addition

296

to having the largest impact when its information is lost, DAB2IP is also the only gene that is

297

significantly differentially expressed between class ‘benefit’ and ‘no benefit’ (p = 0.002). DAB2IP

None of the other signature genes are significantly differentially expressed between the classes

(Supplementary table 1). This lack of univariate association is to be expected, as our results show

304

that the combination of genes is essential for the benefit prediction. Several genes do have a

305

clear link to cancer or MM specifically. For instance, NES is a stem cell marker that is not found

306

in healthy plasma cells, but is found specifically in MM19. Moreover, NES has been associated

307

mechanisms of bortezomib is the downregulation of the production of IL-6 in the bone marrow

Together, this indicates that our signature is not only capable of identifying patients benefiting

320

from proteasome inhibitors, but also includes biologically relevant genes that aid in

321

understanding differential response to PI treatment.

322
323

Different cellular response to bortezomib in class benefit

324

For 142 patients in the HTT cohort tumor gene expression was measured again 48 hours after

325

receiving bortezomib. To investigate whether the cellular response to bortezomib is different for

326

patients classified as ‘benefit’, we performed a differential expression analysis between the gene

327

expression before and after treatment separately in class ‘benefit’ and class ‘no benefit’ using

328

SAM28. Because the number of patients in class ‘benefit’ for which a second measurement is

329

available is small, we relaxed our definition of benefit and stratify the patients into the ‘benefit’

330

class if the calculated zPFS>0 and to the ‘no benefit’ class otherwise. This results in 71 out of 142

331

patients being classified as benefiting. We find 12 genes that are significantly differentially

332

expressed before and after treatment in class ‘benefit’ but not in class ‘no benefit’. We also find

333

two genes that are significantly differentially expressed only in class ‘no benefit’. These 14

334

differentially expressed genes and their mean fold change after treatment are shown in figure

335

4c. To identify the genes that truly represent a different cellular response in class ‘benefit’ and

336

‘no benefit’, we compute the difference in fold change between both classes. To ensure that this

337

is not a random difference, we also compute this difference for all genes using 1000 random class

338

labellings. We find four genes - TNS3, PXN, C2CD4A and PSPC1 - where the difference between

339

‘benefit’ and ‘no benefit’ is larger than expected by random chance (p <0.05 after Bonferroni

340

correction for multiple testing). None of these genes have been described in the context of MM,

Discussion

350

In this work we propose STLsig, a method to identify interpretable signatures that robustly

351

predict patient benefit to PIs from a gene expression measurement at time of diagnosis. The 14

352

gene signature, derived with our method, validates on an independent patient cohort which was

353

moreover measured on a different platform, confirming the robust nature of the signature.

354
355

PIs play a major role in MM treatment today. Yet our results indicate that many patients do not

356

benefit from PI treatment and better selection of patients that do benefit is crucial. The signature

357

identified here has direct applicability in the clinic to aid in optimal treatment selection.

358
359

One of the main aims of constructing simple gene expression signatures is that the genes in the

360

signature may provide insight into the underlying biology. Interpreting the signature is, however,

361

only meaningful if the genes in the signature are essential and unique. Our signature adheres to

362

both these properties as substantial drop in performance is observed when one of the genes in

363

the signature is shuffled and no similar signature can be found when the original 14 genes are

364

excluded from the analysis. These findings reinforce the importance of the selected genes and

365

indicate the power of STLsig to further elucidate proteasome inhibitor specific mechanisms.

366
367

Several of the genes in the signature are already described to be involved in the proteasome

368

system or disease progression in MM. For instance, genes involved in the unfolded protein

369

response have been described before to play a role in bortezomib response 39. The fact that our

370

data-driven approach selects genes also involved in this process, indicates we can capture biology

371

without inserting biological knowledge into the model beforehand. Therefore, we propose that

372

the genes in our signature not yet described in the literature to be involved in PI efficacy, may

373

have an as of yet undiscovered role in determining proteasome inhibitor benefit and are

374

interesting targets for further research.

375
376

We found that our classifier, which was trained on bortezomib, also performed well in predicting

377

benefit to another PI, carfilzomib. This is impressive as the model had no opportunity to learn

378

carfilzomib-specific mechanisms. Although a carfilzomib signature that can be used in the clinic

379

would need more specific optimization, our results do indicate that at least some sensitivity

380

mechanisms overlap between bortezomib and carfilzomib.

381
382

STLsig can readily be applied to other diseases and drugs. A very potent application could be to

383

perform post-hoc analysis of clinical trial data for drugs which missed their endpoint. Such

384

analysis could reveal a subset of patients who would still benefit from the drug, thus potentially

385

extracting extremely valuable information from failed clinical trials.

Taken together, we provide a powerful machine learning approach to aid in treatment decisions

388

in the clinic, ensuring a more optimal treatment choice and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

390

Methods

391

Data

392

To develop the gene network and train the bortezomib benefit signature, we pool gene

393

expression and survival data from three phase III trials (referred to as the HTT cohort): Total

394

Therapy 2 (TT2, GSE2658)40, Total Therapy 3 (TT3, GSE2658)40 and HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4

395

(H65, GSE19784)41. The TT2 dataset includes 345 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma

396

(NDMM) samples, treated either with thalidomide and melphalan (n = 173) or melphalan

397

alone (n = 172). The TT3 dataset includes 238 NDMM samples treated with bortezomib,

398

thalidomide, dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin and etoposide (VTDPACE). The

399

H65 dataset includes 327 NDMM samples, treated either with vincristine, doxorubicin and

400

dexamethasone (VAD, n = 158) or bortezomib, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (PAD, n =

401

169). In our analyses of the pooled data two treatment arms are considered: a bortezomib

402

arm, which comprises the PAD arm from H65 and TT3, and a non-bortezomib arm, which

403

comprises the VAD arm from H65 and TT2. Combined, these datasets form the HTT cohort

404

and include 910 patients, of which 407 received bortezomib and 503 did not. Of these 910,

405

606 are used as HTT training data and 304 as HTT hold out data.

407

All samples have been profiled with the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 array.

408

Gene expression is MAS5 and log2 normalized. Batch effects resulting from pooling different

409

datasets are corrected with ComBat 42. Data is scaled to mean 0 and variance 1 per probeset.

410
411

For validation of both the bortezomib model and carfilzomib model, we use the CoMMpass

412

trial (NCT0145429) dataset generated by the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation

413

(MMRF). For 747 patients both RNAseq, survival data, and treatment information is available

414

(CoMMpass Interim Analysis 13). Of these patients, 61 did not receive any PI in first line

415

treatment, 530 received bortezomib and 156 received carfilzomib. Sequencing data is

416

processed with the Cufflinks pipeline (for details see researcher.themmrf.org). For validation

417

we combine the log2 normalized values from the HTT data and the FPKM values from

418

CoMMpass. We scale the combined data to mean 0 and variance 1 and then perform ComBat

419

batch correction, as performing mean-variance scaling before ComBat leads to better

420

overlap between the datasets in the tSNE. In ComBat batch correction H65, TT2, TT3 and

421

CoMMpass are defined as four separate batches.

422
423

For all survival analyses, we use Progression Free Survival (PFS) as an endpoint. Cox

424

proportional hazard models were fitted using the R package ‘survival’ (version 2.44). All HRs

425

are computed as PI vs no PI, which means a HR below 1 signifies a benefit from the

426

treatment. For the survival analysis in the HTT cohort we stratify for dataset of origin, to

427

correct for the significant survival difference between the Total Therapy dataset and the

428

Hovon65/GMMG-HD 4 dataset.

430

Constructing and evaluating gene pairs

431

We select only probe sets that meet the following requirements: (i) variance across the samples

432

> 2 in the training dataset before mean variance scaling, (ii) unambiguous mapping to one gene

433

and (iii) matching gene in the CoMMpass dataset. This yields n = 3319 genes. We then construct

434

all possible gene pairs from these 3319 genes, resulting in 5,506,221 gene pairs.

435
436

To train the gene signature we divide the HTT cohort (n = 910) into four folds, Fold A (n = 202),

437

Fold B (n = 202), Fold C (n = 202) and Fold D (n = 304). Fold A, B and C are used to train the

438

signature as described below, while fold D acts as hold out data to validate the signature and

439

optimize a threshold to use in independent validation data.

440
441

To determine treatment benefit, we follow the core concept of STL laid out in our previous work3,

442

where for each patient a score zPFS is defined that measures whether the patient survived longer

443

than expected compared to patients with similar gene expression that received another

444

treatment. More specifically, for genepair {n,m} and patient j we define:

445

𝜇𝑃𝐹𝑆𝑗𝑛,𝑚 =

𝐼
∑ 𝑃𝐹𝑆𝑗 − 𝑃𝐹𝑆𝑖
𝐾
𝑗
𝑖𝜖Π

446

where PFSj is the progression free survival time of patient j, I=1 if patient j received the target

447

treatment (a PI in this work) and I=-1, otherwise. Moreover, Π 𝑗 the set of K nearest neighbors to

448

patient j defined in terms of euclidean distance in the expression space spanned by genes n and

449

m and only considering patients that received another treatment than patient j. Throughout this

450

manuscript K=10. In the set Π 𝑗 , we discard patients for whom we cannot be sure whether they

451

survived longer or not (i.e. if both patients are censored). This leads to an average of 7 patients

452

being used in the calculation of μPFSj. Subsequently, zPFS is normalized to a z-score by comparing

453

𝜇PFS to a background distribution resulting from repeating this procedure M=1000 times with a

454

random Π 𝑗 . The zPFS score describes how much smaller (or larger) the survival of patient j is

455

compared to patients with similar gene expression but opposite treatment than expected by

456

random chance.

457
458

To score gene pairs, a 2-fold cross validation is employed using fold A (n = 202) and fold B (n =

459

202). Within each fold, a kNN-regression model (k = 10) is trained, which is used to predict zPFS

460

on the other fold. The gene pair score is defined as the Spearman correlation coefficient between

461

the predicted zPFS and calculated zPFS across all patients. The score for each gene pair is the

462

mean correlation of the 2 folds. We repeat this procedure 5 times with a different split in folds.

463
464

Gene network construction

465

We construct gene networks separately for all 5 repeats and then construct a consensus network,

466

which only contains the genes and edges found in all 5 repeats. To construct the gene networks,

467

for each gene, we rank all gene pairs containing that gene on the mean Spearman correlation

468

coefficient found. We then connect genes that are mutually synergistic, i.e. gene A should be

469

among gene B’s best partners and vice versa. We achieve this by requiring that AB is among the

470

top 5% of pairs including A and among the top 5% of pairs including B. However, if a single gene

471

is informative for treatment benefit, gene pairs containing this gene could be highly ranked even
22

472

if the second gene is uninformative. Including these gene pairs in our network and subsequent

473

signature would introduce noise, which would both harm biological interpretation of the

474

signature and potentially decrease the predictive performance in independent data. Therefore,

475

we also require the mean correlation of the gene pair to be above the median correlation of all

476

selected gene pairs. We evaluate all gene networks in the consensus network on their ability to

477

predict benefit and select the best performing combination to construct the signature.

478
479

Gene network selection and gene signature construction

480

After gene network construction, gene networks are selected using forward feature selection. To

481

rank gene networks, we determine the predictive performance for each gene network. To this

482

end, we calculate zPFS for each patient and each gene network separately on fold A and B

483

together (n = 404). The top 25% of patients (in terms of zPFS) are assigned to class ‘benefit’, while

484

the remaining patients are assigned to class ‘no benefit’. Subsequently, A Cox proportional

485

hazards regression on the treatment variable is performed within the ‘benefit’ patient group as

486

well as in the ‘no benefit’ patients. The performance of a gene network is defined by the

487

difference between the Cox’ regression β’s in class ‘benefit’ and class ‘no benefit’.

488

To select gene networks to use in the final model we perform forward feature selection using

489

fold C, which comprises 202 patients not used in fold A and B. Gene networks are added

490

sequentially based on their performance on fold A and B. Ranking of patients across more than

491

one gene network is done based on the sum of the zPFS scores of the individual gene networks.

494
495

To validate the signature in independent data, we use all training data (n = 606) as a reference

496

set where zPFS is known. For each patient in the validation set we compute the euclidean

497

distance to all patients in the reference set per gene network. We then use inverse distance

498

weighting to calculate the estimated zPFS of a validation patient j by

501

x, weights wi are given by

503

where d is the Euclidean distance between the expression data of gene x of patients i and j.

Figure legends

Figure 1. Overview of the construction and selection of the gene networks. First each gene pair
is scored on the correlation between predicted and calculated zPFS. Gene networks are then
formed by connecting synergistic genes, i.e. genes that are amongst the top 5% partners for each
other based on correlation coefficient. The gene networks are then ranked based on difference
between Cox regression β in class ‘benefit’ and ‘no benefit’. The signature consists of the
combination of gene networks that results in the largest difference in Cox’ regression β between
class ‘benefit’ and ‘no benefit’.
