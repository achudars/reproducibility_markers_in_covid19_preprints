ABSTRACT
Common genetic variants in 183 loci have been identified in relation to breast cancer risk
in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These risk variants combined explain only a
relatively small proportion of breast cancer heritability, particularly in Asian populations. To
search for additional genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer, we performed a meta-analysis
of data from GWAS conducted in Asians (24,206 cases and 24,775 controls). Variants showing
an association with breast cancer risk at P < 0.01 were evaluated in GWAS conducted in
European women including 122,977 cases and 105,974 controls. In the combined analysis of
data from both Asian and European women, the lead variant in 28 loci not previously reported
showed an association with breast cancer risk at P < 5 ×10-8. In the meta-analysis of all GWAS
data from Asian and European descendants, we identified SNPs in three additional loci in
association with breast cancer risk at P < 5 ×10-8. The associations for 10 of these loci were
replicated in an independent sample of 16,787 cases and 16,680 controls of Asian women (P <
0.05). Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and gene-based analyses provided evidence
for the possible involvement of the YBEY, MAN2C1, SNUPN, TBX1, SEMA4A, STC1, MUTYH,
LOXL2, and LINC00886 genes underlying the associations observed in eight of these 28 newly
identified risk loci. In addition, we replicated the association for 78 of the 166 previously reported
risk variants at P < 0.05 in women of Asian descent using GWAS data. These findings improve
our understanding of breast cancer genetics and etiology and extend to Asian populations
previous findings from studies of European women.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the leading cause of
cancer-related deaths in women worldwide1. Genetic linkage studies and family-based studies
have identified many high- and moderate-penetrance mutations in breast cancer predisposition
genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, PTEN, ATM, PALB2, and CHEK22. In addition, large-scale
genome-wide association studies (GWAS), conducted primarily in Asian and European women,
have identified more than 180 susceptibility loci for breast cancer risk3-8. These identified loci
explain a relatively small proportion of familial relative risk of breast cancer8.
The Asia Breast Cancer Consortium (ABCC) is the largest breast cancer GWAS
consortium conducted in Asian-ancestry populations. We have shown previously that GWAS
conducted in Asians could uncover cancer genetic risk variants that are either unique to the
Asian population or more difficult to identify in studies conducted in European women3,4,9-16. It
also has been shown that a large proportion of common susceptibility loci are shared between
Asian and European populations, although the lead variants in many loci may differ between
these two populations6,8. To search for novel breast cancer susceptibility loci, we conducted
Asian-specific and cross-ancestry meta-analyses combining the data of the ABCC and the
Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) with a total sample size of approximately
310,000 women (~82,000 Asians and ~228,000 Europeans). We herein report the discovery of
31 novel risk loci for breast cancer and the replication of a large number of known breast cancer
susceptibility loci in Asian women.

We identified 28 loci with at least one common variant at each locus showing a
significant association with breast cancer risk in the cross-ancestry meta-analysis (i.e., P < 5
×10-8) (Table 1 and Figure 1-a). None of these lead risk variants reside within a 500Kb region
flanked by any of the 183 previously reported breast cancer risk variants. No obvious inflation in
statistical estimates was observed for either Asian-specific or cross-ancestry meta-analysis after
excluding known loci (sample size-adjusted λ 1000 = 1.012 and 1.001, respectively;
Supplementary Figure 1). No evidence of heterogeneity in associations was observed between
the two racial populations except for rs2758598 and rs142360995 (Table 1, P heterogeneity < 0.05,
consistent in direction). The OR estimates for these 28 SNPs by study within the ABCC and
BCAC consortia are presented in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3. We explored pleiotropic
effects by assessing the newly identified lead variants and their correlated SNPs (in LD with r2 >
0.4 in either Asians or Europeans) from the online catalog of published GWAS (GWAS catalog).
Pleiotropy was found for seven of the 28 newly-associated SNPs (Supplementary Table 4).
All of the 28 SNPs showed a nominally significant association (P < 0.05) with ERpositive breast cancer risk (Table 2). Fourteen of the 28 risk SNPs were also associated with
ER-negative breast cancer risk in the cross-ancestry meta-analysis (P < 0.05). Heterogeneity
between ER+ and ER- breast cancer risk (P heterogeneity < 0.05) was observed for rs73006998,
rs7765429, rs144145984, rs78588049, and rs12481286.
Of the 28 SNPs, 22 were investigated in an independent set of 10,829 cases and 10,996
controls included in ABCC and an additional 5,958 cases and 5,684 controls from studies
conducted in Malaysia and Singapore (see Methods). A significant association at P< 0.05 was
found for 10 SNPs, all with the association direction consistent with our main findings
(Supplementary Table 5). Among them, five SNPs showed significant associations at P <
2.3×10-3 (0.05/22), including rs3790585 (1p34.1), rs73006998 (3q25.1), rs6940159 (6q27),
rs855596 (12q23.2), and rs75004998 (14q24.3).

To uncover possible secondary association signals in newly identified breast cancer
susceptibility loci, we performed analyses for SNPs within flanking 500kb of each lead SNP,
with adjustment for the lead SNPs within each dataset. We then conduced meta-analyses to
combine the results across studies of Asian women. Six potential secondary associations were
identified (conditional P < 1×10-4), and all correlated (r2> 0.1 in 1000 Genome East Asians)
except for rs7693779, at 4p12 (Supplementary Table 6).
Of the 28 SNPs newly identified to be associated with breast cancer risk, 13 SNPs are
intronic, one in UTR, and 14 in intergenic regions. Using data from ENCODE and Roadmap, we
found that the majority of these 28 overlapped with genomic functional biofeatures that were
indicative of promoters or enhancers (Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). Of the 28 lead SNPs,
four (rs3790585 at 1p34.1, rs6756513 at 2p13.3, rs10820600 at 9q31.1, and rs78588049 at
12q15) intersected with chromosomal segments annotated as strong enhancers or active
promoters in breast tissue-originated cell lines. When all SNPs that were in LD with the lead
SNPs with r2> 0.8 in either Asians or Europeans were evaluated, evidence of regulatory function
was found for an additional seven (i.e. 1q22-rs2758598, 3q25.1- rs73006998, 3q25.31rs11281251, 8q22.2- rs2849506, 14q24.3-rs75004998, 15q24.2-rs8027365, and 21q22.3rs35418111).

eQTL and gene-based analyses
To identify target genes of the 28 newly identified lead SNPs, we conducted cis-eQTL
analyses in four independent datasets in breast tissue. Nine eQTL associations were identified
with a P < 0.05 with same association direction in two or more independent sets
(Supplementary Table 9). Potential candidate genes identified in this analysis included
LINC00886, ybeY metallopeptidase (YBEY), snurportin 1 (SNUPN), mannosidase alpha class

2C member 1 (MAN2C1), T-Box 1 (TBX1), MutY DNA glycosylase (MUTYH), lysyl oxidase like
2 (LOXL2), stanniocalcin 1 (STC1), and semaphorin 4A (SEMA4A). SNP rs144145984 was the
eQTL for both LOXL2 and STC1 genes, but the association for STC1 is much stronger.
Similarly, SNP rs8027365 was associated with expression levels of two genes, MAN2C1 and
SNUPN.
With the exception of TBX1 and LOXL2, we were able to build breast-tissue and/or
cross-tissue models for all other eQTL-identified candidate genes with a prediction R2 > 0.01
(Supplementary Table 10). Expressions of LINC00886, YBEY, MAN2C1 and SEMA4A could be
predicted with a high accuracy by both breast tissue and cross tissue models (R2 > 0.09). We
imputed expressions of seven genes other than TBX1 and LOXL2 and showed that these genes
were associated with breast cancer risk in either the ABCC or BCAC data at P < 0.05
(Supplementary Table 10). Of these, genes hypothesized to have a tumor-suppressor function
included LINC00886, MAN2C1, SNUPN, and STC1, while YBEY, SEMA4A, and MUTYH may
have an oncogenic role in breast carcinogenesis based on their associations with breast cancer
risk (Supplementary Table 11)

Associations of previously reported risk variants in Asians
Of the 183 risk variants of breast cancer reported previously, 11 and 172 were originally
discovered in studies conducted in Asians and European-ancestry populations, respectively. We
were able to investigate 166 variants because 15 variants originally discovered in European
populations were (nearly) monomorphic in Asians and two in high LD with rs2747652 (ESR1,
6q25.1) were removed. Of the 166 SNPs, 78 were found to be associated with breast cancer
risk at P < 0.05, while 131 showed associations that were consistent in direction with those
originally reported (Supplementary Table 12). Associations for five variants achieved genome-

wide significance (P < 5 ×10-8, Asians), with two at 6q25.1 (ESR1 and TAB2), and one each at
15q26.1 (PRC1), 16q12.1 (TOX3), and 21q22.12 (LINC00160). Additionally, borderline genomewide significant associations were found in seven loci including 2q14.1, 2q35, 3p24.1, 5q33.3,
9q33.3, 12p13.1 and 17q22 (P < 1 ×10-6 in Asians).

Independent association signals within previously reported susceptibility loci of breast cancer
We searched extensively for additional independent associations in Asians by
conducting conditional analysis for variants located 500kb of the 166 previously reported SNPs.
A total of 820 SNPs from 21 loci were associated with breast cancer risk after conditioning on
known risk variants in Asians (Supplementary Table 13). Eight loci, 5q11.2, 6q25.1, 9p21.3,
10q21.2, 12q24.21, 16q12.1, 18q12.3 and 21q21.1, may harbor independent association
signals with genome-wide significance (Table 3, conditional P < 5 ×10-8 in Asians). Five of these
eight loci, including 5q11.2, 9p21.3, 12q24.21, 18q12.3, and 21q21.1, have not previously been
linked to breast cancer risk in Asian populations. Significant heterogeneity between Asian and
European-ancestry populations was observed (P heterogeneity < 0.05) at 5q11.2, 9p21.3, 12q24.21,
16q12.1, and 21q21.1, and the strength of the association was stronger in Asian than
European-ancestry women.

DISCUSSION
This large-scale meta-analysis, including approximately 310,000 women of Asian and
European ancestry and represents the largest GWAS to identify genetic determinants for breast
cancer. In addition to identifying 28 novel risk loci for breast cancer, we replicated in Asian
women 78 of the GWAS-identified risk variants for breast cancer. Since the risk variants initially

reported in European populations might not be the lead SNPs in Asians, we performed further
analyses to show that 21 known susceptibility loci may harbor additional independent signals, of
which 16 showed at least one stronger association than the originally reported risk SNP. Our
study has generated substantial novel information to improve the understanding of breast
cancer genetics and etiology and provides clues for future studies to functionally characterize
the risk variants and candidate genes identified in our study.
Similar to other GWAS, nearly all of the newly identified risk variants mapped to
intergenic regions or introns of genes. One exception was rs10820600, which is located in the
5’-UTR region of the SMC2 gene. SMC2 encodes the structural maintenance of chromosomes
protein-2, an essential subunit of the condensin complex I and II. The protein is critically
involved in chromosome condensation and segregation during cell cycles17. Emerging evidence
shows that SMC2 mutations and dysregulated expression are associated with multiple
cancers18.
Of the thirteen lead risk variants located in the introns of genes, six showed strong
evidence of cis-regulation for seven genes nearby, including YBEY, SNUPN, MAN2C1,
LINC00886, TBX1, SEMA4A, and MUTYH. For example, the locus at 21q22.3 (rs35418111)
showed compelling evidence of influencing expression of YBEY, a gene that encodes a highly
conserved metalloprotein. Our gene-based analysis indicated a potential oncogenic role of
YBEY in breast cancer development. Although the function of YBEY has not been fully
elucidated, dysregulation of its expressions caused by copy number variation has been found in
familial and early-onset breast cancer19, as well as colorectal cancer20. Further, we showed that
MAN2C1 may play a protective role against breast carcinogenesis in the gene-based analysis.
However, another study found that MAN2C1 promotes cancer growth via a negative regulation
of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) function in prostate and breast cancer cell lines21.
These results suggested that MAN2C1 may have distinct functional impact on cancer initiation

compared to that on tumor progression. Few studies have investigated the mechanistic roles of
LINC00886, SNUPN and SEMA4A in cancer initiation. Germline mutations in SEMA4A have
been linked to the predisposition of familial colorectal cancer type X22. Our study provides the
first evidence linking these two genes to breast cancer susceptibility.
Potential candidate genes were also revealed by the newly associated variants lying in
the intergenic regions between coding genes. LOXL2 and STC1 were pinpointed as cis targets
of rs144145984 at 8p21.2. LOXL2 is a member of the lysyl oxidase family of amine oxidases
and STC1 belongs to the glycoprotein hormones family. Research regarding the functions of
LOXL2 and STC1 in cancer development is limited. However, pre-clinical studies have
implicated LOXL2 and STC1 in the progression of breast cancer23,24. Inhibiting LOXL2 activity
shows a 55-75% decrease in primary tumor volume in female athymic nude mice, which were
implanted with MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells23. The reduction in tumor burden was
suspected to be mediated by the inhibition of angiogenesis. A recent study suggested the role of
STC1 played in the breast tumorigenesis could be subtype-dependent24. A cancer promoting
function was found in murine mammary tumor cells and human triple negative breast cancer
lines (MDA-MB-231), while an opposite function was shown in luminal breast cancer lines
(ER+/PR+, T47D cells).
The pleiotropy of rs855596 at 12q23.2 provided a plausible mechanistic link for the
observed genetic association with breast cancer risk. The minor (T) allele of rs855596 is
associated with decreased breast cancer risk and is linked to the minor allele G of the nearby
rs703556 (r2 = 0.94 in EA and 0.43 in East Asians). The G allele of rs703556 is associated with
lower mammographic dense area in women25. Mammographic density, an established risk
factor for breast cancer26, is a measure based on the radiographic appearance of the breast by
mammography. Several loci were related to other cancers or benign tumors. SNPs in 22q11.21,
1q22 and 4q12 were found to be associated with risk of prostate cancer27, testicular germ cell

tumor28 and leiomyoma, respectively29. We hypothesize potential underlying mechanisms via
hormone metabolism for these loci. Variants at 10p12.2 (PIP4K2A) indicated an association with
risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia30 and 6p22.3 (CASC15) with endometrial cancer31, lung
cancer32, and neuroblastoma33. These regions implicated in genetic susceptibility across
different types of cancers may serve as prioritized target of interest for future fine-mapping
studies.
Notable racial heterogeneity was found for the loci at 1q22 (rs2758598) and 8q24.11
(rs142360995), which may reflect the differential regional LD structures and allele frequency
between the two populations at these loci. The effect sizes in Asians are larger than those in
European populations for both SNPs, over four times for rs142360995 and two times for
rs2758598. The association at 3q25.1 (rs73006998) was dominant by estimates in Asians
(ABCC: 2.4×10-9; in BCAC, P= 5.8×10-3), although no heterogeneity was observed. Previously,
the same locus was reported to be associated with hormonal receptor-positive breast cancer,
with a borderline genome-wide significance in a Japanese population (rs6788895, LD r2 = 0.76
in East Asians)34. We found significant heterogeneity by ER status for this locus and the
association was primarily driven by ER-positive cancer. Racial heterogeneity was also observed
for many known risk variants initially reported in European populations. It may be attributable to
multiple factors including the Winner’s curse35, population-specific LD structure, and false
positives in the original GWAS.
In summary, in this large GWAS including 147,183 breast cancer cases and 130,749
unaffected controls, we identified 31 novel breast cancer susceptibility loci by meta-analyzing
data of two large consortia conducted in Asian and European women. Using an independent set
of 16,787 cases and 16,680 controls of Asian ancestry, we replicated ten of these loci. As many
of the associations were driven by GWAS of European women, the low replication rate is not
unexpected. Unfortunately, we could not include a further independent dataset of European

ancestry to optimize the power in the replication stage. Nevertheless, our study reveals many
novel loci and potential targeted genes that may influence breast cancer susceptibility, although
the possibility of false-positives cannot be completely ruled out. Future investigations are
warranted to replicate our findings.

METHODS
Study population
The overall cross-ancestry meta-analysis was conducted using data from two large
consortia, the ABCC and BCAC. Detailed descriptions of participating studies are included in
Supplementary Text 1 File. Briefly, in the ABCC, genome-wide SNP data were generated from
24,206 breast cancer cases and 24,775 unaffected controls recruited from studies conducted in
mainland China, South Korea, and Japan (Supplementary Table 1). The BCAC-Asian dataset
was composed of COGS (N = 10,716) and OncoArray projects (N = 14,337); twelve studies
contributed samples to either or both projects. The BCAC-European dataset consisted of three
sub-sets, GWAS (N = 32,498), COGS (N = 89,677), and OncoArray projects (N = 106,776)8.
Included as a replication set were an additional 10,829 cases and 10,996 controls of
Asian ancestry, recruited by eight studies from South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan
(Supplementary Text 1). There was no overlap in samples from participating studies.
Information on ethics approval and informed consent are described in detail for each cohort in
the Supplementary Text 1.

All of the genotyping and quality control procedures for GWAS, except for the expanded
MEGAEX chip, have been described elsewhere3,4,6-12,34,36,37 (Supplementary Table 1). The
MEGAEX chip contains approximately 2.04 million variants with an excellent genomic coverage
of common variants (a minor allele frequency of 0.01 or higher) across multi-racial populations.
We added to the MEGAEX chip ~80k variants selected from our GWAS of breast and colorectal
cancers and exome sequencing data for breast cancer cases in Asian-ancestry populations. In
total, 2.1 million variants were included on this array. We used the same quality control (QC)
procedure as described elsewhere.3,4,6-12,34,36,37 Samples were excluded if they (i) had
genotyping call rate < 95%; (ii) were male based on genotype data; (ii) had a close relationship
with a Pi-HAT estimate > 0.25; (iii) were heterozygosity outliers; (iv) were ethnic outliers. SNPs
were excluded if they had (i) a call rate < 95%; (ii) no clear genotyping clusters; (iii) a minor
allele frequency < 0.001; (iv) a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test of P < 1 ×10-6; (v) genotyping
concordance < 95% among the duplicated QC samples. All of the datasets were imputed using
the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 mixed populations as the reference panel, except for the
BioBank Japan (BBJ1) study, in which the HapMap Phase II (release 22) was used. Only SNPs
with an imputation R2 > 0.3 were included in the further analyses.
Genotyping of the replication set of cases and controls was completed using the iPLEX
Sequenom MassArray platform (Agena Bioscience Inc., San Diego, California, USA). One
negative control (water), two blinded duplicates and two samples from the HapMap project were
included as QC samples in each 96-well plate. Samples or SNPs that had a genotyping call rate
of<95%. We also excluded SNPs that had a concordance with the QC samples of<95%
or an unclear genotype call. If the assay could not be designed for the lead SNP, a surrogate
SNP which is in LD with the lead SNP with r2 > 0.8 in Asians (1000 Genome) was selected. Of
the 28 newly identified risk variants, 22 were successfully genotyped by Sequenom and
evaluated in the association analysis, while six failed in the probe designing stage. Additional

11,642 independent samples from MYBRCA and SGBCC studies (Supplementary text 1) were
also included in the replication stage in evaluation of the 22 newly identified risk variants.

Statistical methods
Logistic regression analysis were performed within each study of Asian women to obtain
a per-allele odds ratio (OR) for each SNP using PLINK2.038. Principal components analyses
were conducted within each GWAS dataset. Age and the top two PCs were included as
covariates for in all regression models. Study (COGS) or country/region (OncoArray) was also
included in the analyses of BCAC data8. A meta-analysis was performed using METAL39 with a
fixed-effects model to generate Asian-specific and cross-ancestry estimates. Heterogeneity was
assessed by the Cochran’s Q statistic and I2. For the cross-ancestry meta-analysis, we were
mainly interested in evaluating variants that were associated with breast cancer risk at P < 0.01
in the Asian-specific analysis (nsnp = 244,746). However, three additional lead SNPs that did not
meet this criterion can also be found in Supplementary Table 14. Inflation of the test statistics
(λ) was estimated by dividing the 50th percentile of the test statistic by 0.455 (the 50th
percentile for a χ2 distribution on 1 degree of freedom)40. We standardized the inflation statistic
to account for the large size of our study by calculating λ , (λ for an equivalent study with
1,000 cases and 1,000 controls)8. For the replication stage, analyses were conducted with an
adjustment for age and study.
Independent secondary association signals were evaluated within a flanking +/- 500kb
region of the lead variant in each of the newly identified breast cancer risk loci using conditional
analysis, with an adjustment for the newly identified lead risk SNPs. SNPs showing an
association with breast cancer risk at P conditional < 1 ×10-4 were considered independent
secondary association signals. We used GCTA software (option -COJO)41 to perform the

conditional analysis for the BBJ1, Seoul Breast Cancer Study (SeBCS), and BCAC European
studies, for which only summary statistics data were available. MEGA array genotyping data
was used as reference panel for LD estimation. The analysis was also performed within known
susceptibility loci. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Functional annotation
Novel risk loci were defined as those +/- 500Kb away from the lead risk variant reported
by previous GWAS conducted in populations of Asian or European-ancestry for breast cancer.
The lead risk SNPs newly identified in our study were defined as the variant showing an
association with breast cancer risk with the lowest P-value in a given locus in the meta-analysis.
Functional annotations of the lead SNPs and their correlated variants (r2 > 0.8 in 1000 Genomes
Project, East Asian or European populations) were performed using HaploReg v4.142. The
functional annotation of chromatin states from chromHMM, DNase I hypersensitive and histone
modifications such as H3K4, H3K9 and H3K27, were based on the epigenetic data in human
breast mammary epithelial cells (HMEC), MCF-7 cells, and other cell lines from the
Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project and Roadmap Epigenetics Project.

Expression quantitative loci (eQTL) analysis
To identify target genes, we performed eQTL analysis utilized four independent sets of
gene expression data derived from normal breast (N= 85, GTEx, women of European ancestry),
breast tumor (women of European ancestry, TCGA, N = 672; METABRIC, N = 1,904) and
adjacent normal tissues (women of Asian ancestry, SBCGS, N = 151). We focused on cis-eQTL

analyses for genes residing ± 500 Kb flanking each newly associated leading SNP. The details
of data processing were described in Supplementary Text 2.
A linear regression model was used to perform eQTL analyses to estimate the additive
effect for each leading SNP identified on gene expression levels. We additionally adjusted for
somatic copy number alteration and methylation levels in the regression model for the analysis
of TCGA data. We only adjusted for somatic copy number alteration in the analysis for the
METABRIC set.

Gene-based analysis
We recently conducted a transcriptome wide association study (TWAS) to investigate
associations of genetically predicted gene expression with the risk of breast cancer43. We
utilized the same approach to examine the associations with breast cancer risk of genes located
within flanking 500kb of each newly associated leading SNP. The breast-specific prediction
model was generated using the elastic net method as implemented in the glmnet R package (α=
0.5), with tenfold cross-validation43. To further increase statistical power, we also utilized 6,124
samples across 39 tissue types from 369 unique European individuals who had genome-wide
genotype data available to build cross-tissue models, as previously described44,45. The
expression of a gene for individual  in tissue  , , , is modeled as ,       , , where
 represents the cross-tissue component of expression levels for a given gene. The mixed

effect model parameters were estimated using the lme4 package in R. The predicted gene
expressions  in the breast-specific models and   in the cross-tissue models then were
evaluated for their associations with breast cancer risk in the ABCC and BCAC, using methods
implemented in MetaXcan46.
