Abstract
Objective: To describe the surgical journal position statement on data-sharing policies
(primary objective) and to describe the other features of their research transparency
promotion.
Methods: Only “SURGICAL” journals with an impact factor superior to 2 (Web of
Science) were eligible for the study. They were not included if there were no explicit
instructions for clinical trial publication in the instructions for authors and if there were
no RCT published between January 2016 and January 2019. The primary outcome
was the existence of a data-sharing policy in the instructions for authors. Details on
research transparency promotion were also collected, namely the existence of a
“prospective registration of clinical trials requirement” policy; a “COIs” disclosure
requirement and a specific reference to reporting guidelines such as CONSORT for
RCT.
Results: Among the 87 surgical journals eligible, 82 (94%) were included in the
analysis: 67 (77%) had explicit instructions for RCT and of the remaining, 15 (17.2%)
had published at least one RCT between 2016-2019. The median impact factor was
2.98 [IQR=2.48-3.77] and in 2016 and 2017, the journals published a median of 11.5
RCT [IQR=5-20.75]. Data-sharing statement instructions (primary outcome) were
ICMJE-compliant in four cases (4.88%), weaker in 45.12% (n=37) and inexistent in
50% (n=41) of the journals. As for data-sharing statements, no association was found
between journal characteristics and the existence of data-sharing policies (ICMJEcompliant or weaker). A “prospective registration of clinical trials requirement” was
associated with ICMJE allusion or affiliation and higher impact factors. Journals with
specific RCT instructions in their OIA and journals referenced on the ICMJE website
more frequently mandated the use of CONSORT guidelines.
Conclusion: Research transparency promotion is still limited in surgical journals.
Uniformization of journal requirements vis-à-vis ICMJE guidelines could be a first step
forward for research transparency promotion in surgery.

INTRODUCTION
Surgical journals have a key role to ensure transparency, openness, and
reproducibility1 – features that are expected to increase value and reduce waste in the
research they publish2. The highest editorial standards are expected when it comes to
randomised controlled trials (RCT) because their importance is paramount in drafting
guidelines that can impact medical practice worldwide. The latest breakthrough was
the adoption by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) of a
policy that encourages RCT data sharing and requires a data-sharing statement to be
included in the reports of published clinical trials3. Other aspects of research
transparency promotion have been previously promoted such as registration of the
trial4, adoption of the CONSORT statement5 and declaration of conflicting interests
(COI)6. However, transparent practices in the surgical community could be suboptimal
as suggested by the underreporting of COI7.
The aim of this study is to describe the surgical journal position statement on datasharing policies (primary objective) and to describe the other features of their research
transparency promotion.
METHODS
This survey of surgical journals was registered with a protocol in the Open Science
Framework on February, 25th 2019.
(https:// osf.io/d6bua/?view_only=6d0a6290df804f8a843ad8cddead81e5)
Eligibility criteria and Journal selection
Two reviewers (NL and AG) used Web of Science to select journals classified in the
"SURGICAL" category with an impact factor superior to 2. Surgical journals were not
included if there were no explicit instructions for clinical trial publication in the
instructions for authors and if there were no RCT published between January 2016 and
January 2019. Two authors (NL and AG) independently extracted the data.
Disagreements were resolved by consensus or in consultation with a third reviewer
(DB). The list of journals was extracted in December 2018 and the official instructions
for authors (OIA) were downloaded on January 13-14, 2019.
Our primary outcome was the existence of a data-sharing policy in the instructions
for authors. Types of policies for data sharing were described using the following

classification: “ICMJE compliant” (policies explicitly stating that the data-sharing
statement was mandatory), “Weaker policy” (policies stating a data-sharing statement
could be included in the paper), “None” (no mention of any data-sharing policy). Details
on research transparency promotion were also collected, namely the existence of a
“prospective registration of clinical trials requirement” policy; a “COIs” disclosure
requirement and a specific reference to reporting guidelines such as CONSORT for
RCT. Various journal features were also extracted (see Table 1). Journal impact factors
were extracted from the Web of Science data base and the number of RCT published
between January 2016 and January 2018 was extracted from Pubmed (we initially
planned to evaluate the number of RCT published in 2016, 2017 and 2018 but this was
not possible because at the time of data extraction, all RCT published were not fully
indexed in Pubmed). ICMJE “affiliation” was defined as journals referenced as
"Journals stating that they follow ICMJE Recommendations" at:
http://www.icmje.org/journals-following-the-icmje-recommendations.
Statistical analyses
Analyses of all included journals were performed using open source R statistical
software (http://www.r-project.org/). Quantitative variables were expressed with
median and the interquartile range (IQR) and compared with the Mann-Whitney U test.
Qualitative variables were expressed as a percentage and compared with a Chisquared test or Fisher test as appropriate. Univariate exploratory analyses were
performed to explore the associations between journal features and the various
transparency policies. Multivariate analyses were planned but not run owing to sparse
data.
RESULTS
Among the 87 surgical journals eligible, 82 (94%) were included in the analysis: 67
(77%) had explicit instructions for RCT and of the remaining, 15 (17.2%) had published
at least one RCT between 2016-2019 (Supp. figure 1 details the selection process).
The characteristics of these journals are detailed in Table1. The median impact factor
was 2.98 [IQR=2.48-3.77]. In 2016 and 2017, the journals published a median of 11.5
RCT [IQR=5-20.75]. The publishing model was “hybrid” in most cases (89.02%) and
North America was the principal geographical area of journal editorial committees
(56.10%) Data-sharing statement instructions were ICMJE-compliant in four cases

(4.88%), weaker in 45.12% (n=37) and inexistent in 50% (n=41) of the journals. COI
disclosure was mandatory in 77 journals (93.90%). A reference to CONSORT
guidelines was made in 24 journals (29.27%). Prospective registration of clinical trials
was mandatory in 53 cases (64.63%). Figure 1 presents the relationship between the
different research transparency promotion items and journal impact factors and the
number of RCT published between 2016 and 2018. The associations between journal
features and the different transparency policies are presented in Supp. Table 1. As for
data-sharing statements, no association was found between journal characteristics
and the existence of data-sharing policies (ICMJE-compliant or weaker). A
“prospective registration of clinical trials requirement” was associated with ICMJE
allusion or affiliation and higher impact factors. Journals with specific RCT instructions
in their OIA and journals referenced on the ICMJE website more frequently mandated
the use of CONSORT guidelines. No other association was found.
DISCUSSION
We noted low rates of implementation of data-sharing policies, i.e. 50 % of the journals
had no explicit policy included in their instructions for authors. When explicit, these
policies were rather allusive and weaker than the ICMJE recommendation that make
a data-sharing statement mandatory for RCT. Of course, we studied a moving target
and one could argue that the ICMJE position on data sharing was fairly recent (data
extracted 6 months after the ICMJE statement) and that a number of journals did not
have the time to implement it when our survey was conducted. However, this policy
was announced in 20178 and 35 (43%) journals are listed on the ICMJE website.
Interestingly, implementation of older policies was also suboptimal, even for making a
specific reference to reporting guidelines such as CONSORT for RCT which date from
19965. Except for COI disclosure, those policies were mostly non-binding. These
disappointing results are not new. In 2014, Chapman et al.9 warned about sub-optimal
transparency policies in 10 leading surgical journals.
We considered a journal’s policies presented on its website as a surrogate marker
of implementation of these policies. However, it is possible that editors of journals with
a policy do not implement them in an optimal manner10 or, conversely, that a journal
with no specific policy documented on the website requires authors to comply with
some of the features we explored. Of note, previous research has shown that journal

requirements can have a significant impact on changing researcher practices11 but an
obvious next step is to explore the transparency features of the published RCT in these
journals.
Of concern, we found no association of research transparency items with impact
factors nor with the number of RCT published except for prospective trial registration
among the surveyed surgical journals. This is of concern since impact factor (rounded
to the nearest two decimals) is misused as a surrogate to assess the quality of a given
journal and sometimes of an individual paper.12,13
CONCLUSION
As part of a wider movement14, we suggest that indicators of quality such as
prospective audits of policies and published papers must be used to assess journals
instead of journal impact factors. We encourage surgical journals to be part of the move
to improve their research transparency promotion. Uniformization of journal
requirements vis-à-vis ICMJE guidelines could be a first step forward for research
transparency promotion in surgery.
