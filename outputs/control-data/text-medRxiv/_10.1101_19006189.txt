Abstract
Background
Using UK Biobank data from baseline to the imaging study, our aim was to investigate
whether participants with comorbid psychiatric disorders suffer from higher risk of impaired
cognition over time compared to those without. There are several conventional statistical
techniques to examine whether this pattern indicates the increased risk of comorbidity of the
aforementioned, however, they carry certain inherent limitations. Machine learning (ML) has
shown specific advantages in examining potential predictors simultaneously in an unbiased
manner, especially its ability to identify patterns of information within useful features for the
prediction of an outcome of interest. We applied ML techniques on UK Biobank data to
examine whether anxiety and/or depression are important longitudinal predictors of impaired
cognition.
Methods
We used data from UK Biobank (n = 1.158) across three time waves to longitudinally
assess the effects of comorbidity (anxiety and depression, measured through self-report
scales) on cognition. Theta (Ө) measures for each mental health scale were computed using
item response theory (IRT) and intraindividual variability of reaction time performance (IIV) raw standard deviation - was used as a measure of cognitive performance. First, comorbidity
information was summarized to show the variation of impaired cognition for participants with
and without psychiatric disorders. A machine learning (ML) approach was then applied to
examine if psychiatric disorders and other putative covariate markers may be important
predictors of long-term cognitive decline.
Results
For participants with anxiety, the percentage of having impaired cognition constantly
increases through time from 35.09% to 42.15%; in contrast, an increase with less magnitude

is found for participants without anxiety from 36.10% to 40.03%. Likewise, for participants
with depression, the percentage of having impaired cognition constantly increases through
time from 35.49% to 41.67%; in contrast, an increase with less magnitude is found for
participants without depression from 35.64% to 40.52%. Using the area under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve it was observed that the anxiety model achieved the
best performance among all models, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.68, followed
by the depression model with an AUC of 0.64. The cardiovascular and diabetes model and
the demographics model had relatively weak performance in predicting cognition, with an
AUC of 0.60 and 0.57, respectively.
Conclusions
Using data from UK Biobank, this study provides empirical evidence which suggests
that psychiatric disorders are important comorbidities of cognitive decline. Furthermore, when
other comorbidities were included in the model these were not as important on long-term effect.
When the recurrent neural networks were trained for the psychiatric disorder features (anxiety
and depression) they showed improved performance in predicting cognition in comparison
with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and demographic factors. These findings suggest that
mental health disorders (anxiety and depression) have a deleterious effect on long-term
cognition, and may be considered an important comorbid disorder of cognitive decline. The
implications of this work is that the important predictive effect of poor mental health on
longitudinal cognitive decline should be considered in both research and clinical settings.

Introduction
The concept of comorbidity was initially operationalised by Feinstein when he was
concerned with the medicating confounds of treating patients with diseases such as rheumatic
fever who simultaneously suffered from multiple diseases (Feinstein, 1970). Conceptualising
comorbidity, however, has not proved so straightforward and since Feinstein, the absence of
a true definition has led to it constituting a heterogeneous term in the absence of its own
nosology. Moreover, it is used synonymously with multimorbidity, although the latter is more
commonly referred to when the co-existing disorders (diseases) are non-defined in their own
right, with comorbidity in contrast, seen as a ‘coexistence’ of diseases (Meghani et al., 2013).
Moreover, in psychiatry, psychology, and mental health counselling, comorbidity has been
referred to as the presence of more than one diagnosis occurring in an individual at the same
time (Cloninger, 2002). Here, we reflect on the definition and refer to it as the coexistence of
not only two or more diseases but also, diseases which might be defined as ‘chronic’ and
although they might be pathologically related to each other, they also act independently
(Kraemer, 1995).
Our interest is in the comorbidity of psychiatric disorders and impaired cognition.
Research suggests that poorer mental health is associated with cognitive deficits
(Bauermeister & Bunce, 2015), with higher baseline levels of depressive symptoms predicting
a steep decline in delayed recall and global cognition at follow-up (Panza et al., 2010) and
longitudinal slowing in processing speed (Bunce, Batterham, Christensen, & Mackinnon,
2014). Furthermore, with at least one in four older adults experiencing a gradual decline in
affective state with increasing age, there is a suggestion that along with age-related cognitive
decline, there could be a comorbid relationship of unclear temporality (Arve, Tilvis, Lehtonen,
Valvanne, & Sairanen, 1999). Using UK Biobank data from baseline to the imaging study, our
aim was to investigate whether those participants with anxiety and/or depression suffer from
higher risk of impaired cognition over time compared to those without. There are several

conventional statistical techniques to examine whether this pattern indicates the increased
risk of comorbidity of the aforementioned, however, they carry certain inherent limitations. First,
as hypothesis-driven models, they tend to have assumptions on data distributions. Above all,
the assumption of normally distributed independence of attributes or linear data behaviour are
often not met in large registries incorporating neuropsychological data. With the presence of
nonlinear high-order interaction effects, the statistical inference might lose precision (Breiman,
2001, 2017; Friedman, Hastie, & Tibshirani, 2001; Ripley, 2007; Shouval et al., 2014). Second,
high-dimensional data with noisy predictive variables, common in such data, is likely to
possess slow convergence of estimators to the true value of a smooth function defined on a
space of high dimension (Munshi & Chaudhuri, 2011). Therefore, preselection of variables is
often necessary to avoid loss of important information which may be relevant for outcome
prediction (Shouval et al., 2014).
On the other hand, machine learning (ML) has shown certain advantages in examining
potential predictors simultaneously in an unbiased manner - especially its ability to identify
patterns of information within useful features for the prediction of an outcome of interest, even
when complex high-dimensional interactions exist (Chekroud et al., 2016). A recent report
suggested that ML models developed from self-reports about characteristics of incident
episodes and comorbidities among respondents with lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD)
predicted MDD persistence, chronicity and severity with good accuracy (van Loo et al., 2014;
Wardenaar et al., 2014). Although ML methods have successfully been used to develop riskprediction schemes in other areas of medicine (Chang, Chen, Chang, Chung, & Lai, 2012;
Chao et al., 2012), applications to psychiatric comorbid disorders have so far relied on small
samples and thin predictor sets, failing to realize the full potential of the methods. Considering
this, here we apply ML techniques on UK Biobank data to examine whether anxiety/depression
are important longitudinal predictors of impaired cognition.

Methods
Dataset description
The UK Biobank recruited 502,664 participants who were registered with the UK
National Health Service (NHS), aged between 37 and 73 years. Participants undertook
comprehensive mental health, cognitive, lifestyle, biomedical, demographic and physical
assessments at 22 assessment centres throughout the UK between 2006 and 2010. Followup assessments were conducted for approximately 20,000 participants in 2013 (Sudlow et
al., 2015) and further follow-up assessments were collected for those participants taking part
in the imaging study which is ongoing. Ethical approval was granted to Biobank from the
Research Ethics Committee - REC reference 11/NW/0382 (Sudlow et al., 2015). All
analyses were conducted on the Dementias Platform UK (DPUK) Data Portal (Bauermeister
et al., Preprint) using data from UK Biobank application 15008. The analysis was conducted
in Python 3.6.7 and MATLAB R2015b.
We utilise a dataset which includes three time waves in UK Biobank: baseline (time
wave 1), first assessment (time wave 2) and imaging visit assessment data (time wave 3), to
longitudinally examine the role of depression and anxiety as comorbid disorders of impaired
cognition. Only participants who completed the three visits were included in the study to allow
two visits for performing sequence learning and an additional visit for backpropagation (Ghazi
et al., 2018). Participants with missing observations at any time wave were removed to obtain
1,158 subjects. Descriptive statistics are reported in Table 1.
Outcome measures
Cognitive performance was assessed using a ‘stop-go’ RT task in which participants
were shown two cards simultaneously on a computer screen. Each card had a symbol on it
and participants were asked to respond as quickly as possible using a button-box, if both
symbols matched. Reaction time, from the presentation of the cards to the press of the button,
was recorded in milliseconds (ms). Each participant was presented with 12 pairs of cards, the

first five of which were training sets. Data from these trials were discarded. Of the seven test
trials, cards with matching symbols were presented on four occasions selected at random.
Consistent with established methods (e.g., Lyall et al., 2016), participants with a reaction time
less than 50ms indicating anticipation of the stimulus were discarded, and those with reaction
times greater than 120ms were treated as the target stimulus had been withdrawn at this point
(Piumatti, Moore, Berridge, Sarkar, & Gallacher, 2018). Intra-individual variability (IIV) was
calculated as the standard deviation of each participant’s RTs over the test trials (Dykiert, Der,
Starr, & Deary, 2012). Participants with only one valid score at baseline or follow-up were
omitted. IIV showed log–normal distributions and were natural log transformed.
Comorbid disorders
This paper focused on two common psychiatric comorbid disorders: MDD and anxiety.
Participants completed a selection of mental health scales presented on a touchscreen
computer, including the Patient Health Questionnaire four-item version (PHQ-4) to capture
depression (Kroenke, Spitzer, Williams, & Lowe, 2009). Participants were required to rate on
a four-point Likert scale from zero (not at all) to three (nearly every day), their response to four
items: “frequency of depressed mood”, “frequency of unenthusiasm / disinterest”, “frequency
of tenseness / restlessness” and “frequency of tiredness / lethargy”. An anxiety proxy measure
was utilised using the 12-item neuroticism EPQ-R scale (Eysenck, Eysenck, & Barrett, 1985)
which suggests emotional instability and reactiveness. Participants were required to answer,
“yes”, “no”, “I don’t know” or “I do not wish to answer” in response to the 12 questions: “Does
your mood often go up and down?”, “Do you ever feel just miserable for no reason?”, “Are you
an irritable person?”, “Are your feelings easily hurt?”, “Do you often feel fed-up?”, “Would you
call yourself a nervous person?”, “Are you a worrier?”, “Would you call yourself tense or highly
strung?”, “Do you worry too long after an embarrassing experience?”, “Do you suffer from
nerves?”, “Do you often feel lonely?”, and “Are you often troubled by feelings of guilt?”.

Covariates
Diabetes and cardiovascular disease including heart attack, angina and stroke were
included as binary variables (yes / no). They were included as proxies for other potential
comorbid disorders (Biessels, Deary, & Ryan, 2008; Hassing et al., 2004). Other common
confounders of cognition and psychiatric disorders were also included as covariates (Arve et
al., 1999; Feart, Samieri, & Barberger-Gateau, 2010; Mathew, Hogarth, Leventhal, Cook, &
Hitsman, 2017; Piumatti et al., 2018). Educational attainment was included as a binary variable
(with or without a university or college degree), as was tobacco use status (smoker / nonsmoker), ethnicity (white / other), employment status (employed / not), and consumption of
fruit and vegetables (below 5 portions a day compared to equal or above). Body mass index
(BMI) was included as two binary variables with normal weight defined as ≤ 24.9kg/m2
compared to overweight 25.0 to 29.9kg/m2 and obese ≥ 30kg/m2. Categorical information on
annual household income was available: less than £18,000; £18,000 to £30,999; £31,000 to
£51,999; £52,000 to £100,000 and greater than £100,000. Age was included as a continuous
variable. Alcohol consumption was calculated as the summation of the multiplication of the
average number of consumed alcoholic drinks by the average grams of alcohol contained in
each type of drink using the UK Food Standard Agency’s guidelines (Roe, Pinchen, Church,
& Finglas, 2015).
Analytic Strategy
In this study, we examined whether participants have longitudinal increased risk of two
mental health disorders (MDD and anxiety) occurring together, in two steps:

Step 1 – Summarise the comorbidity information
We present an overview of whether mental health disorders and impaired cognition
are likely to occur together by examining how cognition varies for participants with/without
disorders, over time, using two approaches.

First, we follow Elixhauser et al. (1998) to stratify participants into two groups: those
with a disorder (depression/anxiety) and those without. The percentage of participants with
high/low IIV (above/below average) is calculated for each stratified disorder group in each time
wave. Second, we follow Charlson et al. (1987) to measure the unadjusted relative risks of
comorbidity. This assesses the risk of patients’ impaired cognition with a given comorbid
condition (anxiety/depression in this case) regardless of the presence of other comorbid
diseases. It is calculated as the division of the proportion of patients with anxiety/depression
who have impaired cognition by the proportion of patients without anxiety/depression who
have impaired cognition.
Theta (Ө) measures were computed for depression and anxiety separately using item
response theory (IRT) analysis, whereby the sample is first stratified into those with comorbid
disorders and those without. Specifically, an IRT graded response (GRM) model was applied
to the 4-item Likert scale (PHQ-4), and a depression latent Ө metric was derived for each
participant. A two-parameter IRT (2-PL) model was applied to the 12-item neuroticism binary
response item scale (e.g., Bauermeister & Gallacher, 2019), and a post-estimation
neuroticism latent Ө metric was derived for each participant. There are several advantages of
using Ө over using a summated score in longitudinal studies. First, as a standardised score,
the IRT Ө provides a more stable and reliable construct over time. IRT is able to provide
additional longitudinal information beyond just the score as it provides both within and
between-item information across longitudinal waves (Rock, 2012). Also, Ө is able to avoid
overestimating the repeated measure variance and underestimating the between-person
variance (Gorter, Fox, & Twisk, 2015). Moreover, it is suggested that the Ө latent metric may
be more sensitive to longitudinal change as it is computed along a continuum with multiple
measurement points, compared to a single summated score which may contain as many as
12 measurement points. Second, it has also been suggested that using an IRT-based latent
metric will produce smaller sample bias particularly in large cohorts (Lu, Thomas, & Zumbo,
2005). A positive Ө suggests possession or endorsement of the trait and a negative Ө

intuitively suggests absence or non-endorsement with most respondents recording values
between – 3 and + 3 (e.g., De Mars, 2010). The sample is stratified accordingly, for instance,
participants with positive neuroticism Ө are categorized into the anxiety group.

Step 2 – Identify the prediction pattern of mental disorders on cognition
A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural networks that is often
utilized as an effective prediction tool for longitudinal biomedical data. By exhibiting temporal
dynamic behaviour for time sequences, it allows for temporal dependencies between
measurements. As a sequence learning based method, it is able to offer non-parametric joint
modelling of longitudinal data (Ghazi et al., 2018; Pearlmutter, 1989).
Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an RNN architecture developed to deal with the
exploding and vanishing gradient problem during backpropagation through time. By employing
a constant error carousel: (1) a memory cell which maintains its state over arbitrary time
intervals, and (2) three nonlinear gating units (input, forget and output) which regulate the
information flow into and out of the cell, it is able to effectively capture long-term temporal
dependencies (Gers & Schmidhuber, 2001; Gers, Schmidhuber, & Cummins, 1999; Ghazi et
al., 2018; Greff, Srivastava, Koutník, Steunebrink, & Schmidhuber, 2017; Hochreiter &
Schmidhuber, 1997). This study applies the commonly used LSTM setup described by Graves
and Schmidhuber (Graves & Schmidhuber, 2005), which uses full gradient training and has
been shown to perform reasonably well among other approaches in practice (Greff et al.,
2017). This architecture is applied to longitudinally model the prediction abilities of psychiatric
comorbidity disorders on cognition via sequence-to-sequence learning.
The dataset was partitioned into two non-overlapping subsets: 75% of the within-class
subjects for training and 25% for testing. Data was rescaled [0 and 1] to meet the default
hyperbolic tangent activation function of the LSTM model. The Adam version of stochastic
gradient descent algorithm was applied to tune the weights of the network. This optimization
algorithm combines the advantages of Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad) and Root Mean

Square Propagation (RMSProp), thus being effective in handling sparse gradients on nonstationary problems (noisy). Furthermore, it compares favourably to other stochastic
optimization methods in practice (Kingma & Ba, 2014). The model was set to fit 500 training
epochs with a batch size set to the number of available training subjects. Mean absolute error
(MAE) and Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) were used
to assess model performance, respectively.
To evaluate whether depression and anxiety are important comorbid disorders of
cognition, we first ran model (I) which only included covariates as features and was used as
the reference model, then ran model (II) which included the neuroticism scales in addition to
model (I), and model (III) which included the depression scales in addition to model (I). We
also ran model (IV) which included diabetes and cardiovascular disease in addition to model
(I), which was used to compare their prediction abilities with those of the mental health
disorders. Given that major depressive disorder and anxiety have previously been considered
to be comorbid disorders of impaired cognition, we expected predictions based on comorbid
mental health disorders to outperform predictions based only on demographic variables.

Results
Figure 1 summarises the percentage of participants with high and low IIV in each
condition group and Table 2 reports the unadjusted relative risk under three time waves. For
participants with anxiety, the percentage of having impaired cognition constantly increases
through time from 35.09% to 42.15% for high IIV and 64.91% to 57.85% for low IIV; in contrast,
increase with less magnitude is found for participants without anxiety from 36.10% to 40.03%
for high IIV and 63.90% to 59.97% for low IIV. Likewise, for participants with depression, the
percentage of having impaired cognition constantly increases through time from 35.49% to
41.67% for high IIV and from 64.51% to 58.33% for low IIV; in contrast, increase with less
magnitude is found for participants without depression from 35.64% to 40.52% for high IIV and
from 64.36% to 59.48% for low IIV.

The unadjusted relative risk increases from 0.972 at time wave 1 to 1.503 at time 3 for
anxiety and 0.996 to 1.028 for depression 1 . These descriptive patterns suggest that
comorbidity of anxiety and depression may lead to impaired cognition in the longer-term.
Table 3 reports the performance measures of the LSTM network using different
features in predicting cognition, and Figure 2 represents the relational characteristics of the
comorbidities on a ROC curve. It can be observed that the anxiety model achieved the best
performance among all models, with an AUC of 0.68, followed by the depression model with
an AUC of 0.64. The cardiovascular and diabetes model and the demographics model had
relatively weak performance in predicting cognition, with an AUC of 0.60 and 0.57,
respectively. Among all models, the anxiety model prospectively identified 62.89% of patients
who eventually reached high IIV (i.e., sensitivity), and 53.27% of patients who kept low IIV (i.e.,
specificity). Correspondingly, the anxiety model had a positive predictive value (PPV) of
52.69%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 63.30%. The depression model achieved
slightly smaller yet still significant predictive performance in comparison with the other models.
The RNNs results suggest that the anxiety and depression model outperform the reference
model (model that only includes covariates as features). In general, the neuroticism and
depression scales helped improve the accuracy in capturing the pattern of reaction time, and
therefore may be important predictors of impaired cognition. The results suggest increased
risk of multiple mental health disorders occurring together, suggesting depression and anxiety
are potential comorbid disorders of cognition.

Discussion
In this paper, a longitudinal analysis of the comorbid predictors of mental health
disorders on cognitive decline was conducted using machine learning techniques. Using data

In order to preserve a dataset as large as possible, when summarizing comorbid information, we include
participants with no missing values on cognition and psychiatric disorders without considering covariates. The
total number of available participants are 3501.

from UK Biobank, this study provides empirical evidence which suggests that anxiety and
depression are important comorbid disorders of cognition but when cardiovascular disease,
diabetes and other demographic predictors were included in the model these were not as
significant on long-term effect. This suggests that poor mental health has a significant
deleterious effect on long-term cognition, and may be considered a comorbid disorder of
cognitive decline. The contribution of the present investigation is thereby three-fold.
First, this study used the community-based sample from UK Biobank with general
population large enough for identification of valid effects which might be implied across clinical
and research settings.. Clinical-based samples have been criticized for inconsistency in
diagnoses when patients are treated over time in a variety of facilities or at different times in
the same facility, or for failure to report all the comorbid diagnoses of a patient (Cloninger,
2002). In comparison, community-based samples, are based on a system in which a practical
number of criteria are rated, or collected and assessed on every patient, providing unbiased
prevalence or incidence rates of comorbidity, or unbiased estimates of risk factors for
comorbidity (Angold, Costello, & Erkanli, 1999; Cloninger, 2002).
Second, this study investigates the psychiatric comorbid disorders of cognition in a
comprehensive design in two stages. In the first stage, comorbidity information is summarized
using a commonly used analytical approach. The variation of cognition for participants with or
without psychiatric disorders through time shows an overview of the increased risk of mental
health disorders and impaired cognition occurring together. In the second stage, a ML
approach is applied to examine if psychiatric disorders as measured by self-report scales are
important predictors of impaired cognition. Unlike conventional statistical techniques which are
hypothesis-driven, the sequence learning based method is able to offer non-parametric joint
modelling, allow for multiplicity of factors and provide prediction models that are more robust
and accurate for longitudinal data (Ghazi et al., 2018).
Third, this study is conducted longitudinally. Disease progression modelling using
longitudinal data may provide clinicians with improved tools for diagnosis and monitoring of

diseases. We apply the widely used LSTM network to capture the long-term temporal
dependencies among measurements without making parametric assumptions about cognitive
trajectories. To our knowledge there are no studies which have employed the ML techniques
presented here to investigate the comorbidity of mental health disorders and longitudinal
cognitive decline using cardiovascular disease and diabetes as comorbidity covariates.
The implications of this work is that the important predictive effect of mental health on
longitudinal cognition should be noted and, its comorbidity relationship with other conditions
such as cardiovascular disease likewise to be considered in both research and clinical settings.
