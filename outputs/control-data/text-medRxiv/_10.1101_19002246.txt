Abstract
The co-circulation of different arboviruses in the same time and space poses a significant
threat to public health given their rapid geographic dispersion and serious health, social,
and economic impact. Therefore, it is crucial to have high quality of case registration to
estimate the real impact of each arboviruses in the population. In this work, a Vector
Autoregressive (VAR) model was developed to investigate the interrelationships between
discarded and confirmed cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in Brazil. We used
data from the Brazilian National Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) from
2010 to 2017. There were two waves in the series of dengue notification in this period,
one occurring in 2013 and the second in 2015. The series of reported cases of both Zika
and chikungunya reached their peak in late 2015 and early 2016. The VAR model shows
that the Zika series have a significant impact on the dengue series and vice versa,
suggesting that several discarded and confirmed cases of dengue could actually have
been cases of Zika. The model also suggests that the series of confirmed chikungunya
cases is almost independent of the cases of dengue and Zika. In conclusion,
co-circulation of arboviruses with similar symptoms could lead to misdiagnosed diseases
in the surveillance system. We argue that the use of mathematical and statistical
models routinely in association with traditional symptom-surveillance could help to
decrease such errors and to provide early indication of possible future outbreaks. These
findings address the challenges regarding notification biases and shed new light on how
to handle reported cases based only in clinical-epidemiological criteria when multiples
arboviruses co-circulate in the same population.

Author summary
Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) transmission is a growing health problem
worldwide. The real epidemiological impact of the co-circulation of different arboviruses
in the same urban spaces is a recent phenomenon and there are many issues to explore.
One of this issue is the misclassification due to the scarce availability of confirmatory
laboratory tests. This establishes a challenge to identify, distinguish and estimate the
number of infections when different arboviruses co-circulate. We propose the use of
multivariate time series analysis to understand how the weekly notification of suspected
cases of dengue, chikungunya and Zika, in Brazil, affected each other. Our results
suggest that the series of Zika significantly impact on the series of dengue and vice
versa, indicating that several discarded and confirmed cases of dengue might actually
have been Zika cases. The results also suggest that the series of confirmed cases of
chikungunya are almost independent of those of dengue and Zika. Our findings shed
light on yet hidden aspects on the co-circulation of these three viruses based on
reported cases. We believe the present work provides a new perspective on the
longitudinal analysis of arboviruses transmission and call attention to the challenge in
dealing with biases in the notification of multiple arboviruses that circulate in the same
urban environment.

Introduction

1

In recent times, the re-emergence and the rapid spread of arboviruses in urban areas
have become a serious problem that has concerned health authorities as well as the
general population in many countries. The magnitude of the epidemics, the occurrence
of severe cases with neurological manifestations and lethal outcomes, and severity of
congenital malformations associated with infections occurred during pregnancy are the
main threats of this new epidemiological situation [1, 2].
In Brazil, the co-circulation of the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV), together
with the emergence and dissemination of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus
(ZIKV), transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes (mainly Aedes aegypti ), has a relevant
negative impact on the health of the population and lead to an increase in the demand
on health and other support services. From their introduction, in 1986, to until arrival
and subsequent spread of CHIKV and ZIKV, DENV was the most important
vector-borne disease circulating in cities of Brazil, [3, 4]. In September of 2014, CHIKV
was detected in cities of the states of Amapá and Bahia. Although this disease causes
arthralgia with pain at a higher level than dengue, the other symptoms are similar,
which increased the likelihood of misdiagnosis [5]. In October 2014, an outbreak of an
undetermined exanthematous illness was registered in Rio Grande do Norte, in the
northeast of Brazil, when in April 2015, ZIKV was identified as the aetiologic agent [6].
Patients infected with ZIKV typically presented low (or no) fever and skin rash within
the first 24 hours of the disease onset, while DENV and CHIKV cause high fever
immediately. Also, CHIKV causes more intense arthralgia than DENV. However, the
other symptoms are similar, which confound and complicate their differentiation and
easily lead to misdiagnosis, [2, 7, 8].
The similarity of symptomatology has made the clinical diagnosis of arboviruses
difficult, especially in the course of epidemics with viral co-circulation, in which
laboratory tests are still unavailable for most patients. The misclassification and
incorrect diagnosis affect the risk estimates of these diseases since epidemiological
surveillance depends on the quality of the data to provide morbidity and mortality
information close to the reality lived by the population and, consequently, the
development of effective prevention strategies, [2, 7, 9]. Therefore, this study aims to

explore and understand how dengue notified cases were impacted by the introduction
and spread of chikungunya and Zika virus in Brazil.

Materials and methods

We used a multivariate time series analysis in order to understand how the classification
of notified cases of dengue, Chikungunya and Zika interact with each other in Brazil
from 2015 to 2017.

Data source

We use data from the Brazilian National Notifiable Diseases Information System
(SINAN). We collected weekly reported data of suspected cases of dengue (from 2010 to
2017), chikungunya (from 2014 up to 2017), and Zika (from 2015 up to 2017) viruses.
We only considered cases that presented non-null information about the temporal
variable, i.e., week of notification or week of first symptoms. We further separated the
cases into confirmed and discarded, following the final classification information as used
by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Confirmed cases are all suspected cases of disease,
excluding those discarded or inconclusive. This classification can be based on
clinical/epidemiological criteria, namely presence of clinical symptoms in the same area
and time as other probable cases, or on clinical/laboratory criteria, namely the presence
of clinical symptoms and a positive IgM ELISA result, viral RNA detection via PCR,
NS1 viral antigen detection, or positive viral culture [3]. Discarded cases are defined as
any suspected case that satisfies at least one of the following criteria: negative
laboratory diagnosis (IgM serology); a laboratory confirmation of another disease;
clinical and epidemiological compatibility with other diseases. Inconclusive cases of
dengue and Chikungunya were excluded from the analyses. However inconclusive cases
of Zika represented about 30% (110,656/361,396 registered cases) of all notified cases
from 2015 to 2017, accounting for about 56% (33,863/60,972 registered cases) of the
Zika notifications in 2015. Therefore, for the purpose of this study, we considered
inconclusive Zika cases as probable Zika cases.
To perform the study of time series analyses we collected the confirmed and
discarded reported cases of each arbovirus per epidemiological week in Brazil, from 2015
to 2017.

We construct a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model to uncover possible correlation and
causality effects between the discarded and confirmed cases of the three arboviruses.
Formally, a time-series is defined as random sequence, i.e., a collection of random
variables {Yt }, where the time-index assumes integer values only. A univariate
time-series {Yt } is said to be an autoregressive process if each Yt is defined in terms of
its predecessors Yp , for p < t, by the equation:

63
64

yt = ν + α1 yt−1 + · · · + αp yt−p + ut ,
where ν is a fixed constant of intercept terms allowing to the possibility of a non-zero
mean, and {Ut } is a white noise, i.e., a sequence of mutually independent random
variables, each with mean zero and finite variance σ 2 .
If a m-dimensional multivariate time-series is considered, a vector autoregressive
process (VAR) is defined as a generalization of definition of autoregressive process given
by:
yt = ν + α1 yt−1 + · · · + αp yt−p + ut

where now the bold letters represent a vector notation. Thus, Yt = (Y1t , · · · , Ymt ),
ν = (ν1 , · · · , νm ) are m-vector of constants, α1 , · · · , αp forms a (m × p)-matrix of
coefficients, and Ut is a multivariate m-vector white noise.
We say that (1) is a VAR process of order p, VAR(p), if α1p , · · · , αmp 6= 0 and
α1i , · · · , αmi = 0 for p < i, where p is the smallest possible order.
In this work, we consider a 6-dimensional multivariate time series, with each Yt
representing a vector (Z1t , Z2t , C1t , C2t , D1t , D2t ), where Z, D, and C denotes Zika,
dengue and Chikungunya respectively, the indices 1 and 2 stand for confirmed and
discarded cases, and the time t ranges from the first week of 2015 until the last week of
2017.
The steps to construct and analyse a VAR(p) model consist of: (i) setting the p (lag)
order, which is is automatically selected by the minimum of Akaike information
criterion (AIC); (ii) estimation of the VAR coefficients by a multivariate Least Squares
Estimation; (iii) test for normality of residuals, using a probability plot to assess how
the residual error depart from normality visually, and an analysis of the partial
(cross-)correlation function (PCF) between them; (iv) perform Granger test for causality
for the 6-dimensional estimated multivariate series.
Using the Granger causality F-test in a pair-wise way, we can check whether the null
hypothesis, stating that one series {Xt } does not affect the other one {Yt }, can be
rejected or not. If the hypothesis is rejected, then the time-series {Xt } Granger-causes a
time-series {Yt }. Thus, the past values of {Xt } can be used for the prediction of future
values of {Yt }. In other words, the values used for describing the autoregressive
equation for {Yt } have significant non-zero contribution of past values of {Xt }.
In the current context, when a series of discarded cases of disease 1 affects the
confirmed cases of disease 2, possibly there is evidence that individuals truly infected by
disease 2 were wrong notified as disease 1. However, when confirmed cases of disease 1
affect the discarded cases of disease 2, this can be interpreted as an increase (or
decrease) in the notification of disease 2, but not necessarily this notification could be
claim as a confirmed case of disease 1.
In order to carry out the analysis, we first rand the vector series {Yt } to a stationary
form, in such a way that its mean value and the covariance among its observations do
not change with time. Detailed information about the theoretical background for time
series analysis can be found in [10, 11].
We performed our statistical analysis using a Python software [12].

From January 2010 to December 2017, it was registered in SINAN 9,936,488 million
cases of dengue, from which 56% (5,570,157/9,936,488) were confirmed and 32%
(3,138,750/9,936,488) were discarded. From January 2014 to December 2017 it was
registered 501,202 thousands of cases of chikungunya, resulting in 63% (317,158/501,202)
and 27% (128,100/501,202) of confirmed and discarded cases, respectively. The
classified confirmed and discarded cases of Zika, from January 2015 to 2017, represented
76% (286,198/375,251) and 24% (89,053/375,251) of registered cases, respectively.
During the period covered by this survey, the confirmed cases of dengue had its peak
in early 2015, although the worst epidemy of the disease occurred in Brazil was

Table 1 shows the correlation matrix of the stationary series of confirmed and discarded

correlation according to the interval: ±.00 to ±.10 very low; ±.10 to ±.40 as weak; ±.40
to ±.60 as moderate; ±.60 to ±.80 as strong; ±.80 to ±.99 very strong; ±1.0 as perfect.
Summary of regression results are presented in S1 Appendix. The autocorrelation,
cross-correlations and probability plots of residuals are given from S2 Fig to S5 Fig.
The results of the Granger tests to explore associations between series are presented
in Table 2. They show that, at a significant level, the series of confirmed cases of Zika
affects the series of discarded cases of dengue (Test statistic = 2.807, p-value = 0.001),
discarded cases of chikungunya (Test statistic = 2.158, p-value = 0.011) and confirmed
cases of dengue (Test statistic = 3.222, p-value < 0.001). In the other way around,
there is a significant association between discarded cases of dengue and both confirmed
cases of Zika (Test statistic = 3.348, p-value < 0.001) and confirmed cases of
chikungunya (Test statistic = 3.444, p-value < 0.001). The series of confirmed Zika and
discarded dengue presented a positive weak linear correlation (0.37), which was stronger
than the other correlations for the series described above.
There is a significant association between confirmed cases of dengue and discarded
(Test statistic = 2.958, p-value < 0.001) and confirmed cases of Zika (Test statistic =
2.682, p-value = 0.001). These two series have a positive moderate linear correlation
(0.42 and 0.40, respectively). We also found that confirmed cases of dengue have a

The moderate positive correlation found in the analyses shows that the notification
series of dengue was significantly impacted by Zika, and vice-versa. The Granger score
only fails to evidence out a causal link between discarded cases of Zika and confirmed
cases of dengue. Reasonable interpretation is that an increase of individuals notified as
Zika contributes to an increase of wrong notification of dengue cases within two
scenario: people with Zika were wrongly classified as dengue (and vice-versa), or
perhaps both viruses infected the same individuals. The results also indicate that the
series of confirmed Zika cases increased the series of discarded dengue cases and that,
among those discarded, there were indeed confirmed Zika cases. The series of confirmed
cases of dengue affects significantly and positively (increasing) the series of discarded
cases of Zika, which can be explained by the awareness of the consequences accounted
by Zika at the end of 2015.
The notifications of Zika and dengue had overall weaker effects on the notification of
suspected chikungunya cases, as indicated by the smaller correlation values between the
corresponding series. The association of these values with Granger scores indicates
possible a causal relationship in 3 of the 12 possible combinations. Considering Zika and
chikungunya, it is possible to conclude that the increase of the reported cases of Zika
contributed to a meagre increase of suspected chikungunya cases. As to the mutual
influence of dengue and chikungunya notifications, Granger causality scores show that
possibly a tiny amount of discarded cases of dengue were confirmed cases of
chikungunya. They also show that an increase in the series of confirmed dengue cases
possibly contributed in a very small increase in the number of discarded cases of

chikungunya. In opposition to these three specific combinations, the remaining results
show either the failure to reject the null hypothesis, as in the result for discarded
chikungunya and confirmed Zika cases, or a very small correlation value, as for both
confirmed dengue and chikungunya cases. Thus, the remaining analyses between
confirmed and discarded Zika and confirmed chikungunya cases suggest that they did
not affect each other and probably their notifications happened as independent events
in Brazil. They also support the conclusion that the notifications of dengue and Zika
happened independently of the notification of chikungunya.
This study highlighted that in Brazil, from 2015 to 2017, the series of confirmed and
discarded cases of dengue, chikungunya and Zika presented, in most of the cases, linear
dependence. This reflects the epidemiological context presented by this country from
the second semester of 2014 on, when the simultaneous circulation of DENV, ZIKV and
CHIKV in densely populated urban spaces greatly hampered the correct record of each
case of these diseases [9, 13]. Although CHIKV and ZIKV emerged almost
simultaneously in cities in the same region of the country, the latter was only identified
at the end of April 2015 [6]. Thus, there was a delay in alerting the health services
network about the existence of this new clinical entity. In spite of the long experience in
dengue of the professionals of the network of health services of this country, the
circumstances presented above did not allow the adequate clinical and epidemiological
diagnosis of the cases of each of these three diseases, resulting, often than not, in
incorrect records [2].
In a scenario where only the notification of the diseases are available and laboratory
tests are scarce, we see that the notification of dengue and Zika are shown to be
independent of the notification of chikungunya. These findings are plausible, since
dengue and Zika present more similar clinical manifestations to each other as compared
to chikungunya [7]. The expressive joint manifestations produced by CHIKV infections
allow a more accurate clinical diagnosis, even when specific laboratory tests are not
available. Therefore, these results would not support the use of discarded cases of
chikungunya as complementary cases of Zika infection, as presented by [13]. However, as
the total number of chikungunya discarded cases was small (3.8 %) in comparison to the
universe of cases of the three diseases, that fact did not affect the temporal trend
presented for this and our study. Nevertheless, it is worth noticing that our results
should be nearest of the real, and thus contribute to construct more accurate prediction
models of future Zika epidemics, using only possible cases of dengue.
Another point that calls attention is that the lack of association between the series
of confirmed cases of dengue and confirmed chikungunya, and confirmed cases of Zika
and confirmed chikungunya might be due to spatial factors that are not considered in
this work, or to a hypothetical situation where one virus inhibits the proliferation of the
other.
Our studies based on a rather simplified linear model can be complemented by
future works, where the analysis proceeds either through non-linear methods or through
a more comprehensive and adequate model. A detailed study, probably based on the
symptoms presented by patients, may also contribute to having better estimations for
the quantity of cases that can be assigned for each disease. All suppositions made here
are based only on a temporal analysis of the time series of notifications. Therefore,
including a spatial analysis would clarify more issues regarding the surveillance of
co-circulation of arboviruses and how zones with higher incidences handled with the
notifications of the cases.
Overall difficulties regarding inadequate diagnostics and limited availability of
laboratory tests for the recent arboviruses outbreak have been pointed out for other
authors. However, it is of crucial importance to be able to understand how the
arboviruses interact, as this allows to provide a better estimation of the risk and

propagation of the disease. At this stage of understanding, we believe that our results
raise a discussion of miss-reporting cases and suggest directions for the analysis to assist
such a difficulty.
In summary, we demonstrate two important interrelated aspects: the first one refers
to how the discarded cases, which resulted from reported cases of one arbovirus, can be
considered as part of complementary notifications of another; the second concerns how
the series of confirmed cases of one disease may affect the series of confirmed cases of
another. Thus, these findings address the challenges regarding notification biases and
shed new light on how to handle reported cases based only in criteria
clinical-epidemiologic when these three arboviruses co-circulate in the same population.
