ABSTRACT

30

Background: Therapists may use (more) implicit or (more) explicit motor learning

31

approaches to facilitate motor skill learning of stroke patients. The use of implicit motor

32

learning approaches has shown promising results in healthy populations.

33

Objective: To assess whether an implicit motor learning walking intervention is more

34

effective compared to an explicit motor learning walking intervention delivered at home with

35

regard to walking speed in people after stroke in the chronic phase of recovery.

36

Design: Randomized controlled single blind trial.

37

Setting: Home environment.

38

Patients: 79 people in the chronic phase after stroke (66.4 ± 11.0 years; 70.1 ± 64.3 months

39

after stroke; walking speed 0.7 ± 0.3 m/s; Berg Balance Scale score 44.5 ± 9.5) were

40

randomly assigned to an implicit (n=39) or explicit (n=41) group.

41

Intervention: Analogy learning was used as the implicit motor learning walking intervention,

42

whereas the explicit motor learning walking intervention consisted of detailed verbal

43

instructions. Both groups received nine training sessions, 30 minutes each, for a period of

44

three weeks.

45

Measurements: The primary outcome was walking speed measured by the 10-Meter Walk

46

Test. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline, immediate and 1-month post intervention.

47

Results: No statistically or clinically relevant differences between groups were obtained post

48

intervention (between-group difference estimated 0.02 m/s [95% CI -0.04 to 0.08] and at

49

follow-up (between-group difference estimated -0.02 m/s [95% CI -0.09 to 0.05], p=0,563).

50

Limitations: The treatment effects may have been diluted by “noise” accompanied with

51

research within real life settings, complex tasks and a representative sample.

52

Conclusions: Implicit motor learning was not superior to the explicit motor learning to

53

improve walking speed in people after stroke in the chronic phase of recovery.

INTRODUCTION

55

One of the most practiced motor skills in stroke rehabilitation is walking1. In general,

56

therapists use (more) implicit or (more) explicit forms of learning to facilitate improvement of

57

gait. Explicit motor learning can be referred to as a more conscious form of learning, that is

58

characterized by the generation of verbal knowledge (i.e. facts and rules about movement

59

performance) and involvement of cognitive resources2. In contrast, implicit motor learning is

60

assumed to take place without much knowledge of the underlying facts and rules of motor

61

skills and has been described as ‘learning that progresses with no or minimal increase in the

62

verbal knowledge of movement performance and without awareness’2(p2). Within current

63

clinical practice therapists tend to structure therapy in a more explicit manner or switch

64

between implicit and explicit learning approaches3–5. However, this might not always be

65

efficient. For people after stroke, who often experience cognitive impairments6, it can be

66

difficult to process large amounts of verbal explicit information. Implicit motor learning, on

67

the other hand, strives to minimize the involvement of cognitive resources, especially

68

working memory7 and may therefore be more feasible for people after stroke who apart from

69

physical constraints also suffer from cognitive impairments. Studies show that people after

70

stroke are able to learn implicitly and that performance of an implicitly learned task might be

71

more stable under dual-task condition and more durable over time8. However, there is still a

72

lack of studies comparing the effects of implicit motor learning post-stroke to explicit motor

73

learning within clinically relevant tasks. In order to be clinically meaningful, implicit and

74

explicit motor learning approaches need to be tailored to the individual needs of the patients

75

and performed in the real-life situations.

76
77

One practical approach to induce implicit motor learning is through the use of analogies. In

78

analogy learning, the learner is provided with one single metaphor (or analogy) that strives to

79

encompass all underlying (explicit) knowledge that is necessary to complete the motor skill.

80

For example, to facilitate step length a therapist could provide the analogy ‘Walk as if you

81

follow the footprints in the sand’9. Although no technical (explicit) instructions are given, the

82

analogy may facilitate for example a more symmetrical gait, the foot strike from heel to toe

83

and foot-clearance. Studies in athletes have shown that analogy learning led to better and

84

more stable performance under dual-task conditions10,11. Within the neurological population

85

first pilot studies reveal the feasibility of analogy learning and demonstrate its potential as

86

both clinically relevant and statistically significant changes in walking performance could be

87

obtained9,12,13. In the current study, the effects of analogy learning were compared to detailed

88

verbal instructions when training the clinically relevant task ‘walking’ in a real life setting

89

(home environment).

90
91

To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial that examines the effects of

92

implicit motor learning facilitated by analogies compared to explicit motor learning on a

93

functional walking task in people after stroke. Contrary to earlier studies examining implicit

94

motor learning using the same analogy for the entire group11 the current study also tailored the

95

interventions towards the individual needs, preferences and abilities of the patients. The

96

research question was: Is a 3-week implicit motor learning walking intervention (analogies)

97

more effective compared to a 3-week explicit motor learning walking intervention (verbal

98

detailed instructions) delivered at home with regard to walking speed in people after stroke

99

who are in the chronic phase of recovery? Walking speed was chosen due its integrated results

100

on other gait parameters e.g. step length14 and functional outcomes15. It was hypothesized that

101

implicit motor learning would result in greater improvements of walking speed post

102

intervention (especially at 1-month post intervention).

METHOD

105

Study design and participants

106

The study adopts a randomized, controlled, single-blinded study design and was approved by

107

the local ethics committee METC-Z in Heerlen, the Netherlands (approval number 17-T-06,

108

Netherlands Trial Register: NL6133). Full details of the study protocol have been published

109

elsewhere16. Recruitment of participants took place via community practices, rehabilitation

110

institutes in the region and through a local health-related newspaper. Participants were

111

included if they were > 6 month after stroke, had a self-selected walking speed lower than 1.0

112

m/s, were able to communicate in Dutch and to complete a three-stage command. Participants

113

were excluded if they were unable to walk a minimum distance of 10 meter, could not

114

ambulate on level surfaces without manual contact of another person (Functional Ambulation

115

Scale (FAC) < 3), had additional impairments not related to stroke that significantly

116

influenced their gait pattern (e.g. Parkinson’s disease). All participants signed a written

117

informed consent.

118
119

Randomization and masking

120

A randomization list was generated using a web-based randomization program and was only

121

available to an independent researcher, not involved in the delivery of the interventions or

122

measurements. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the implicit or explicit motor

123

learning condition (block size of four). The assessors were blind to the treatment allocation.

124

The therapists were aware of the treatment condition they provided. Patients were not told

125

which condition they received and were asked to not reveal details about the treatment to the

126

blinded assessors.

127
128

Interventions

129

In total nine training sessions were provided over a three-week long intervention period. Each

130

session lasted 30 minutes. Within a case-study this duration and frequency of sessions were

131

sufficient to result in clinically meaningful changes13. An intervention guideline outlining

132

how the implicit and explicit motor learning intervention should be delivered was developed

133

for therapists in the trial. The guideline was developed with physiotherapists and client

134

representatives and was based on the previous pilot studies and experiences9,13,16. Prior to the

135

trial, five standardization training sessions with the therapists took place to discus and

136

explicate the intervention guideline with example cases. In both interventions, therapist

137

examined the participants walking pattern and defined the underlying gait parameters which

138

could potentially influence walking speed. More details about the interventions and main

139

characteristics with regard to instructions and feedback are described in figure 116.

140
141

The implicit intervention

142

The main focus for the implicit intervention was creating a learning situation in which the

143

learner was not (or minimally) aware of the underlying rules of the practiced motor skill. The

144

concept of analogy learning formed the basis to guide the implicit intervention because 1) it

145

has shown to adopt characteristics of implicit learning10 and 2) it offers therapists a practical

146

and feasible tool to apply therapy12,13. The participants were provided with an analogy which

147

aimed to improve the walking performance and was meaningful to them.

148
149

The explicit intervention

150

The main focus for the explicit intervention was creating a learning situation in which the

151

learner is very aware of the learning process, e.g. in which he/she can precisely explicate the

152

underlying facts and rules that are necessary to perform the motor skill. Therefore, the

153

participant was provided with detailed explicit instructions on their gait performance.

Outcomes
Demographic information

161

The following demographic information and clinical characteristics were collected: age,

162

gender, time post stroke, affected side, use of walking aids, educational level, cognitive level

163

(Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA)17, static balance and fall risk (Berg Balance

164

Scale)18, mobility disability (Rivermead Mobility Index)19, and ability to make movements

165

outside the synergetic patterns (Fugl-Meyer assessment of the lower limb)20. To assess the

166

propensity for conscious motor processing, the Dutch version of Movement Specific

167

Reinvestment Scale (MSRS)21,22 was used.

168
169

Outcome assessment

170

The primary outcome measure was walking speed which was calculated by measuring the

171

walking time on a 10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT; 10m / time (s))23. Secondary outcomes

172

measures were the modified Dynamic Gait Index (DGI)24, motor and cognitive Dual Task

173

(DT) performance25, Movement Specific Reinvestment Scale (MSRS) adapted for gait16,26,

174

verbal protocol, Stroke and Aphasia Quality of Life Scale (SAQOL-39)27, Global Perceived

175

Effect (GPE) scale28 and verbal protocol.

176
177

Assessment of the dual task

178

Motor task performance was measured through calculating the Dual Task Effects (DTE)

179

according to the formula of Kelly et al29. The cognitive task performance was measured via

180

calculating the error scores as done before by Wilson et al25. The error scores were not yet

181

relative to single task. Therefore, the dual task error scores were subtracted from the single

182

task error scores. Both the motor and cognitive task performances were expressed in

183

percentages. Negative percentages indicate that performance deteriorated relative to single

184

task, whereas positive scores indicate relative improvements of the dual task performance.

185
186

Verbal Protocol

187

To assess the amount of explicit knowledge, a verbal protocol questionnaire was be

188

administered after the three-week intervention8. Explicit knowledge is assessed by examining

189

the number of explicit rules that the participant used during walking. More information of the

190

definition of ‘explicit rule’ is described elsewhere16. The answers of the verbal protocol were

191

screened by two independent researchers who were blind to the experimental intervention.

192
193

Sample size calculation and statistical analyses

194

The sample size calculation resulted in a minimum group size of 33 participants per group.

195

The power was set at beta 0.80, the significance level at alpha 0.05, and a standard error of

196

0.23m/s30. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 0.16 m/s for walking speed

197

was set as the minimal change31. Considering 10% of participants may be lost during (drop-

198

out) and another 10% after the intervention (loss-to-follow-up), this study aimed to recruit 40

199

participants per group. The statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS (version 24).

200

Baseline characteristics of the two groups were reported using frequency distributions and

201

descriptive statistics. For the intention-to-treat analyses data of all participants who received

202

the intervention were analysed according to their original treatment allocation. Treatment

203

effects on numerical data were assessed using a linear mixed model. The model represented

204

group, time and group × time as fixed factors. For the repeated measures (balanced design) an

205

unstructured covariance structure was used. The linear mixed model analyses uses all

206

available data, corrects for baseline differences and accounts for dependency of data.

207
208

Statistical analyses of the primary outcome was also described in relation to clinically relevant

209

differences between groups (MCID: 0.16 m/s)31. In the per-protocol analyses data of subjects

210

were excluded if they did not receive the intervention as intended i.e. when protocol

211

deviations occurred in two or more (of the nine) sessions. Possible protocol deviations were

212

self-reported (subjective) in therapists logs and randomly 10 gait training sessions were audio-

213

recorded (objective) and evaluated to detect protocol deviations. Furthermore, people who did

214

not meet the inclusion criteria or people who dropped out were excluded in the per-protocol

215

analysis. Descriptive sub-group analysis was performed on cognition to explore whether

216

cognitive abilities (MoCA ≤ 21) might influence the effect of the interventions. The verbal

217

protocol was only assessed once and an independent t-test was used to compare results

218

between the groups.

2018, a total 81 people were assessed for eligibility and randomized. Two participants (3%)

225

did not start with the study. One participant withdrew due to diagnoses with additional

226

impairments that severely influenced his gait. The other participant decided to stop due to

227

personal reasons. All participants (n=79) that started the intervention were included in the

228

primary intention-to-treat analysis. Demographics and baseline characteristics are presented in

Two participants (3%) deviated from the protocol with regard to the provided instructions (>2

244

goals related to gait and therefore discontinued with the intervention. Two participants (3%)

245

stopped due to other complaints not related to gait. Furthermore, the medical diagnoses of one

246

participant (initially stroke; 1%) was changed during the intervention. Due to pregnancy

247

another participant dropped out of the intervention. All available data of these 19 participants

248

(24%) were included in the primary intention-to-treat analysis but were excluded in the per-

Results of the intention-to-treat analysis

252

Table 2 presents the observed means (SD) per group and time point, the within-group

253

differences, and the estimated between-group differences of the implicit versus the explicit

254

group. Mixed linear models revealed no statistically significant differences between the

255

groups immediately after (difference estimate 0.02 m/s [95% CI -0.04 to 0.08], p=0.498) and

256

one-month post intervention (difference estimate -0.02 m/s [95% CI -0.09 to 0.05], p=0,563;

257

see table 2 and figure 3). Also, no clinically relevant (MCID: 0.16 m/s31) difference between

258

groups were observed. No statistically significant differences in favour of any group was

259

obtained on any of the other secondary outcome parameters (table 2). Over time, within

260

groups, positive changes were observed in outcome measures related to gait function (DGI,

261

DTmotor), and quality of life (SAQOL-39). Participants’ perceived effects with regard to the

262

intervention was similar for both groups (see figure 4). With regard to the verbal protocol, on

263

average, people in the implicit group accumulated significantly fewer explicit rules (M=0.38,

264

R= 0 to 2 rules, SE=0.10) compared to the explicit group (M=2.42, R= 0 to 6 rules, SE=0.27),

outcome (see lower graph figure 3 and supplementary data 2).

DISCUSSION
People after stroke in the chronic phase of recovery who received an implicit motor learning
walking intervention (analogies) under the guidance of physiotherapists in their home
environments, had similar effects on walking speed compared to those who received an
explicit motor learning walking intervention (verbal detailed instructions). No statistically nor
clinically relevant differences between groups were found as between group differences
(intention-to-treat ∆ 0.02 m/s; per-protocol ∆ 0.05 m/s) did not exceed the chosen clinically
relevant threshold of 0.16 m/s31. Similarly, based on the descriptive sub-group analysis on
cognition (MoCA <22) no trend in favour of the implicit intervention was observed (table 3).
No statistical sub-group analysis on cognition was performed based on small group sizes.

To our knowledge this was the first and largest trial in the field of stroke rehabilitation to
examine the effectiveness of implicit motor learning to improve the functional ‘walking’ task
within a clinically relevant context (home environment of the patient)32. The results of this
study did not replicate the more promising findings on implicit motor learning in stroke from
earlier studies, generally performed in more standardized, laboratory settings and/or with nonfunctional tasks e.g.33–35. A variety of factors related to the selection of participants (selection
bias), use of the 10MWT as primary outcome measure (information bias) and
operationalization of the intervention (contrasts) may have influenced the results and led to
these neutral findings.

First, a selection bias may have occurred. To increase generalizability of the results and to

gain a better insight into the potential effects in clinical practice, we chose to include a sample
of stroke patients, which reflects the heterogeneity of the stroke population as seen in
rehabilitation. The researched target population group therefore showed a large variability in
terms of demographics as well as physical and cognitive abilities. This heterogeneity may
reflect reality in practice but might also have diminished the results. Further, the erroneous
inclusion of ten participants whose baseline walking speed exceeded the inclusion criterion
may have led to a ceiling effect. This ceiling effect might explain the larger, but not
significant, trend towards implicit motor learning (see figure 3 lower graph) in the perprotocol analysis. In addition, the study was probably underpowered due to this deviation.

Second, the use of the 10MWT as primary outcome measure may have implications for both
the findings themselves and the interpretation in terms of clinical meaningfulness. The
10MWT was chosen as the primary outcome measure due to its validity, reliability and
feasibility within clinical practice36 but also to allow comparison with other studies37. The
advantage of using walking speed as a primary outcome is the integrated result on multiple
gait parameters such as step length and frequency14,15 and the direct relation to changes in
functional scales38. However, it could be argued that the 10MWT might not have been
sensitive enough to detect changes due to implicit learning if those underlying changes are
small or not obviously related to walking speed (e.g. improvement of confidence during
walking).

Another explanation for the neutral results could originate from the way the interventions
were operationalised. Contrary to earlier studies in more controlled settings and with nonfunctional tasks such as serial reaction time tasks32, it seems difficult to keep the contrast
between interventions equally large when including a functional task within a clinically

relevant environment. In contrast to other studies10,11 the exact number of rules were not predefined but tailored to the participants. For example, Lam et al used a fixed number of ‘eight’
verbal rules compared to ‘one’ analogy11. The provided number of explicit rules (explicit
intervention) may have been limited because of ethical reasons, potentially resulting in a
diminished contrast between groups.

Within this study we assessed the implicit nature of the intervention by asking participants to
report the number of explicit rules the learned (verbal protocol), assessing durability of
performance over a longer time period and dual task interference10,11. None of these measures
revealed a clear picture on the nature of the learning process. For instance, fewer rules were
accumulated in the implicit compared to the explicit group, but it remains unclear whether
these rules have been acquired through treatments before enrolment of this study. In addition,
for some participants the tone-counting task may have been too easy not leading to dual task
interference, whereas for other people the task was too difficult. Due to this large variation in
performance on the cognitive (tone counting) dual task it was not possible to further
legitimately interpret these results.
Finally, on average both groups slightly improved their walking speed after the intervention
(+0.08 m/s in the implicit group and +0.06 m/s in the explicit group) exceeding the threshold
for clinical relevant change of > 0.06 m/s for within group differences as established by
Perera et al39. It might be that using implicit or explicit motor learning does not make a
(clinically relevant) difference for the results of walking rehabilitation within the included
target group and setting of this trial. It is remarkable that the detected improvement (in both
groups) remained relatively stable at the follow-up test. This finding might be seen as a form
of retention and indicates that motor learning occurred rather than just a temporal
improvement in motor performance.

Future research
The design of this RCT was carefully prepared by research into underlying theories40,
feasibility and piloting testing12,13 of implicit motor learning41. Applying the RCT in its
cleanest form in clinical settings42 and with complex interventions was challenging as we
needed to balance between external validity (generalizability of the results for daily practice)
and internal validity (standardization and reliability of the results). Other designs may be
considered to evaluate effectiveness of long-term, highly individualized, and complex
interventions41, as needed in the field of motor learning. Two recent studies suggest that
tailoring motor learning interventions towards patient characteristics and preferences might be
important, promoting more pragmatic trials9,43. The interventions may also be applicable for
people with more severe cognitive impairments (MoCA <21) as equal trends in performance
were found within this sub-group. A logical next step would be to assess which patient
characteristics influence motor learning interventions and how these factors influence the
learning process. Therefore, cohort studies in which all potential influencing factors (e.g.
activity dependent plasticity, cognition, or individual preferences) are measured over time and
therapist document the used motor learning approach in detail might be an interesting
alternative to consider.

To gain more insight in the gait mechanisms and functional effects when applying implicit
motor learning, future studies may consider combining upcoming instruments for quantitative
gait analysis which can be performed outside laboratory settings (e.g. use of wearable
sensors44,45) with patient specific outcome measures which can detect functional relevant
changes within individualized goals (e.g., Patient Specific Functional Scale)46,47.

Conclusion and clinical message
In this study, no overall benefits of implicit motor learning over explicit motor learning for
improving walking performance in people after stroke in the chronic phase of recovery were
found. The treatment effects in this study may have been diluted by “noise” accompanied with
research within real life settings, complex tasks and a representative sample of the target
population. For tailored motor learning approaches more insight is needed on the patient
characteristics and preferences that influence the process of motor learning. While awaiting
further results, therapists may consider both motor learning approaches to facilitate walking
speed within the stroke population.
