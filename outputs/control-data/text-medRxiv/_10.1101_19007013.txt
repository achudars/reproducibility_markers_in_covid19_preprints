Abstract (245 out of 250)
Background: Previous literature has demonstrated a strong association between cigarette
smoking and suicide-related behaviours, characterised as ideation, plans, attempts and
suicide related death. This association has not previously been examined in a causal
inference framework and has important implications for suicide prevention strategies.
Aims: We aimed to examine the evidence for an association between smoking behaviours
(initiation, smoking status, heaviness, lifetime smoking) and suicidal thoughts or attempts by
triangulating across observational and Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses.
Methods: First, in the UK Biobank, we calculate observed associations between smoking
behaviours and suicidal thoughts or attempts. Second, we used Mendelian randomisation
(MR) to explore the relationship between smoking and suicide using genetic variants as
instruments to reduce bias from residual confounding and reverse causation.
Results: Our observational analysis showed a relationship between smoking behaviour and
suicidal behaviour, particularly between smoking initiation and suicidal attempts (OR = 2.07,
95% CI = 1.91 to 2.26, p<0.001). The MR analysis and single SNP analysis, however, did
not support this. Despite past literature showing a positive dose-response relationship our
results showed no clear evidence for a causal effect of smoking on suicidal behaviours.
Conclusion: This was the first MR study to explore the effect of smoking on suicidal
behaviours. Our results suggest that, despite observed associations, there is no strong
evidence for a causal effect of smoking behaviour on suicidal behaviour. Our evidence
suggests that further research is needed into alternative risk factors for suicide which might
make better intervention targets.

Introduction
There are more than 800,000 deaths from suicide each year1, and for each death,
there are 10-40 unsuccessful attempts2. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has
recognised this significant public health problem and the need for comprehensive suicide
prevention strategies, however at present there is limited evidence of sustained reductions in
suicides rates1. Studies of the relationship between cigarette smoking and suicide have
demonstrated a strong association between current cigarette smoking and suicide-related
behaviours characterised as ideation, plans, attempts and suicide related death3–20. These
associations have been shown to have positive dose–response relationships7,8,14 that remain
after adjustment for potential confounding variables such as psychiatric symptoms5, familial
risk factors17, socio-economic characteristics6 and alcohol consumption18. Smoking
interventions such as imposing cigarette taxes and smoke free air policies are reported to be
protective against suicide-related outcomes9.
A number of psychopathological and physiological hypotheses have been explored to
determine whether this association is causal. Even after controlling for specific confounding
variables, residual confounding could still be biasing our estimates6, for example as a result
of social deprivation, lower levels of education and higher levels of impulsivity8,11. Another
hypothesis is of reverse causation, that smokers with pre-existing mental illness may use
nicotine to self-medicate11, and in addition, their illness could lead to reduced motivation for
smoking cessation. However, there is an alternate possibility, that smoking acts as a
causative agent11. A number of possible biological pathways have been explored7, including
evidence that smoking lowers the levels of serotonin15 and monoamine oxidase A and B23.
Reduced levels of these neurotransmitters are related to depressive episodes and low levels
of serotonin are also linked to increased impulsivity15. Nicotine has been found to act as a
potent activator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and this has been linked to
suicidal behaviour24. There is evidence to suggest that chronic cigarette smoking has longterm neurocognitive effects which lead to increased impulsivity and difficulties with decision
making due to impairments in cognitive flexibility7,25.

A clear understanding of the relationship between smoking and suicide remains to be
established. A recent study demonstrated a causal link between smoking and risk of
depression using a Mendelian Randomisation (MR) approach26. MR can be implemented as
a type of instrumental variable analysis in which genetic variants known to be associated
with the exposure (smoking) are used as an instrument to test for an effect on the outcome
(suicidal ideation and suicide attempts). In this study, we apply MR techniques, using genetic
variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), to the relationship between
smoking and suicide. Previous observational research in this area could be biased residual
confounding and reverse causation, and MR is one way to overcome these limitations27. In
our analysis we looked at smoking initiation, smoking heaviness and lifetime smoking, using
a genetic instrument that takes into account smoking status, duration, heaviness and
cessation26.

Methods
Observational analysis
Sample. The UK Biobank is a research resource of health data collected on over
500,000 individuals from study centres located across the United Kingdom. Recruitment
occurred between 2006 and 2010. Participants were aged from 39 to 70 years at recruitment
(mean = 56.91 years, SD = 7.99 years) and 54% of the sample were female. Overall, 30% of
the sample had ever smoked (8% current smokers and 22% former smokers). Further
information is available elsewhere (https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/).
Measure of suicidal ideation. In the UK Biobank, participants were asked as part of a
questionnaire on depressive symptoms “Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been
bothered by any of the following problems? Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of
hurting yourself in some way" (field 20513). Participants could respond depending on
frequency of thoughts either “not at all”, “several days”, “more than half the days” or “nearly
every day”. We recoded these into a binary variable in which those who responded “not at

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19007013; this version posted October 25, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

all” were coded as 0 and everyone else was coded as 1. Individuals who responded “prefer
not to answer” were coded as missing.
Measure of attempted suicide. In the UK Biobank, participants were first asked "Have
you deliberately harmed yourself, whether or not you meant to end your life?" (field 20480).
If they responded yes, then they were asked “Have you harmed yourself with the intention to
end your life?" (field 20483). We used both of these measures to derive one binary measure
of suicide attempt in which participants were given a score of 0 if they responded negatively
to either question and a score of 1 if they responded affirmatively to both questions.
Individuals who responded “prefer not to answer” were coded as missing.
Measure of smoking behaviours. Participants in the UK Biobank self-reported their
smoking status (field 20116). All ever smokers were asked to report their average number of
cigarettes per day (fields 3456 and 2887). If participants responded “do not know” or “prefer
not to answer” they were coded as missing.
Statistical analysis. After restricting to individuals of European ancestry with genetic
data available (to make this analysis comparable with subsequent analyses), 337,053
individuals remained. We looked at the effect of four smoking behaviours on suicidal ideation
and attempts. These were: smoking status (ever v. never), smoking status (current v. former
within ever smokers), cigarettes per day (within ever smokers) and lifetime smoking score.
The latter is a combination of smoking duration, smoking cessation and smoking heaviness
described in detail elsewhere26. The effect of each of these smoking behaviours on suicidal
behaviour was estimated using logistic regression, controlling for age, sex and socioeconomic position (SEP). All analyses were conducted using R28.

Mendelian randomisation analysis using summary level data
Smoking instrument. This MR approach requires GWAS summary data from two
independent samples. The GWAS of suicide attempt was conducted in the UK Biobank,
therefore we were unable to use the lifetime smoking instrument because it was also
constructed using the UK Biobank26. Instead we used the smoking initiation (ever v. never)

GWAS conducted by the GSCAN consortium taking betas from the GWAS with UK Biobank
removed29. 23andMe had to additionally be removed because they do not allow their full
summary data to be released. GSCAN identified 378 conditionally independent genomewide significant SNPs associated with smoking initiation which explain 4% of the phenotypic
variance29.
Suicide GWAS. The GWAS of suicide attempts was conducted in the UK Biobank
using the question and method outlined above with 337,199 participants of which 2,433 were
cases30. The authors did not identify any genome-wide significant SNPs but the summary
statistics can be used as an outcome sample in summary level MR.
Statistical analysis. All analysis was conducted using the TwoSampleMR package31
in R28. We used five different MR methods: inverse-variance weighted, MR Egger32,
weighted median33, weighted mode34 and MR RAPS35. Each method makes different
assumptions and therefore a consistent effect across multiple methods strengthens causal
evidence36. If a SNP was unavailable in the outcome GWAS summary statistics, then proxy
SNPs were searched for with a minimum LD r2 = 0.8 and palindromic SNPs were aligned if
MAF<0.3. We also performed Rucker’s Q test of heterogeneity and the MR Egger intercept
test to estimate potential directional pleiotropy32. Finally, we performed steiger filtering to test
for possible reverse causation37.

Mendelian randomisation analysis using individual level data
Genotyping. UK Biobank participants provided blood samples at initial assessment
centre. Genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix UK BiLEVE Axiom array for 49,979
participants and using the Affymetrix UK Biobank Axiom® array for 438,398 participants.
The two arrays share 95% coverage, but chip is adjusted for in all analyses because the UK
BiLEVE sample is over represented for smokers. Imputation and initial quality control steps
were performed by the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics resulting in over 90
million variants38.

Individuals were excluded if there were sex-mismatches between reported and
chromosomal sex or aneuploidy (N=814). MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit filtering
restricted the sample to individuals of European ancestry based on the first four principal
components of population structure39. After excluding individuals who had withdrawn
consent, 463,033 of the participants remained39. We restricted our analysis to autosomes
only and used stringent filtering thresholds for SNPs of MAF<0.01 and info>0.8.
Conducting the GWAS. Participants from the UK Biobank were randomly allocated to
one of two split halves of the genetic data. We then generated lifetime smoking scores in
sample 1 of these two samples and ran a GWAS using the UK Biobank pipeline40 following
the exact method as described elsewhere26.
Genetic instrument. From the GWAS, genome-wide significant variants (p<5x10-8)
were clumped for independence at 10000kb and r2<0.001.
Instrument validation. We tested the validity of this instrument by creating a polygenic
score from these variants in the second sample from the UK Biobank. This was done using
Plink and weighting each allele by the effect size identified in the GWAS of sample 141. This
therefore provides an independent replication sample to check how much of the variance is
explained in lifetime smoking. If this significantly predicts lifetime smoking in the independent
second sample, then this can be used as an instrument in the individual level MR analysis.
Statistical analysis. We conducted individual level MR using instrumental variable
regressions run in R28 with the ivreg command from the AER package. The instrument was
the polygenic score from the GWAS in sample 1. We controlled for age, sex, and 10
principal components of population structure in all analyses apart from when we ran the
analysis separately in males and females. Then sex was removed as a covariate.

Single SNP analysis
Statistical analysis. Best guess genotypes at the SNP rs1051730 were extracted
using Plink41 in the UK Biobank full sample described above. This SNP in the gene cluster
CHRNA5-A3-B4 is known to be strongly associated with heaviness of smoking42–45. We

tested using logistic regression whether the number of effect alleles (A) of this SNP were
associated with risk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts again using the measures
described above. We controlled for age and sex in all analyses. The logistic regressions
were run in each category of smoking status separately (ever, current, former and never
smokers). A causal effect of smoking on suicidal behaviour would be characterised by an
effect of rs1051730 in all categories of smoking status apart from never smoking which
provides a negative control.

Sensitivity analysis
Smoking and impulsivity. We wanted to ensure that any effects of smoking on suicide
attempts were not the result of confounding from personality factors (e.g. impulsivity and risk
taking) rather than direct effects of smoking. Therefore, we conducted a follow up analysis
using bi-directional MR of smoking initiation on risk taking behaviour using summary level
data. As the instrument for smoking initiation we used the 378 SNPs from the GSCAN
consortium GWAS and effect sizes with UK Biobank removed29. For risk taking behaviour we
used the SSGAC GWAS meta-analysed across multiple cohorts of European ancestry46
which identified 124 SNPs associated with risk tolerance. These analyses followed the
method described above for summary level data.

Results
Observational analysis. Of the 109,649 individuals who had responded to the
question of suicidal ideation, 4,515 (4%) had had suicidal thoughts. Of the 110,035
individuals who had responded to the questions of suicide attempts and self-harm, 2,405

(2%) had ever attempted suicide. Using logistic regression, every smoking behaviour
increased odds of suicidal behaviour with the greatest effect being of initiating smoking on
odds of attempting suicide (Table 1).
MR analysis with summary level data. Of the 378 conditionally independent SNPs
associated with smoking initiation identified by the GSCAN consortium29, 321 were available
in the GWAS summary data for suicide attempt30. We first performed the Rucker’s Q test of
heterogeneity which did not provide evidence for heterogeneity (Supplementary Table S1).
MR Egger analysis could not be conducted because the regression dilution I2GX was below
0.6 (I2GX unweighted = 0.07). All of the other four MR methods showed the same direction of
effect with smoking initiation increasing the odds of attempting suicide (Table 2). The
strongest evidence was from the IVW and MR RAPS methods. The evidence was weaker for
the weighted median and weighted mode approaches which make different assumptions
about the nature of pleiotropy. However, the MR Egger intercept and Rucker’s Q tests
showed no clear evidence of bias from directional pleiotropy (Supplementary Table S2).
Steiger filtering estimated that over half of the genetic instruments explained more variance
in the outcome than the exposure suggesting that there might be reverse causation
(Supplementary Table S3).
MR analysis using individual level data. To conduct an MR of lifetime smoking
behaviour on risk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt using individual level data, we first
had to conduct a GWAS of suicide attempt in the one-half of the UK Biobank using a random
split. We identified 19 independent genome-wide significant SNPs associated with lifetime
smoking score. These were then extracted from the second half of the UK Biobank sample
(with no sample overlap) and weighted by the effect size to create a polygenic score for each
individual. The second half of the UK Biobank sample is 54% female with mean age 56.88
years (SD = 8.00 years). Mean lifetime smoking score in the second half of the sample was
0.342 (SD = 0.679). 4% of individuals had had suicidal thoughts (4% of females and 4% of
males) and 2% of individuals had caused themselves harm with the aim to end their life (3%
of females and 2% of males). We tested the association of lifetime smoking score and

polygenic risk score on the baseline confounders of sex, age, socio-economic position
(SEP), alcohol consumption and educational attainment (Supplementary Table S4). For all
confounders, the association was attenuated for the polygenic risk score compared to the
observed association.
We validated that the score predicts smoking behaviour by conducting a linear
regression of polygenic score on lifetime smoking behaviour in the second half of the UK
Biobank. It explained 0.171% (p<0.001) of the variance in lifetime smoking behaviour.
Finally, we conducted the individual level MR analysis of lifetime smoking polygenic risk
score on suicidal ideation and suicide attempt controlling for age, sex and 10 principal
components of population structure (Table 3). There was no clear evidence for an effect of
lifetime smoking on suicidal ideation or suicide attempt but a trend towards increased risk in
both analyses (Table 3).
Single SNP analysis. Finally, we extracted values for the SNP rs1051730 (A/G) from
individuals in the UK Biobank. We first confirmed that an increased number of effect alleles
(A) were associated with increased smoking behaviour (Supplementary Table S5) where we
observed the anticipated increase of ~1 cigarette more per day per allele within ever
smokers. We also showed that genotype at rs1051730 is not associated with smoking status
or the baseline confounders of sex or alcohol consumption (Supplementary Table S5).
However, there was some evidence to suggest that genotype at rs1051730 was associated
with educational attainment and age (Supplementary Table S5). There was no clear
evidence for an effect of rs1051730 genotype on suicidal behaviours controlling for age and
sex (Figure 1). There was weak evidence to suggest that the number of rs1051730 effect
alleles might reduce risk of suicide attempts with no effect in the never smokers and a small
protective effect in the ever smokers (Figure 1). If smoking is increasing risk of suicidal
behaviour, we would still expect to see no association in never smokers but the opposite
effect within ever smokers.
Smoking and impulsivity sensitivity analysis. We only saw evidence for smoking as a
risk factor for suicide attempts when the instrument was smoking initiation. One trait

associated with both smoking initiation and suicide attempts is impulsivity. Therefore, we
conducted a bi-directional MR of smoking initiation and risk-taking using summary level data
which have previously been shown to be genetically correlated46. There was strong evidence
of a bi-directional causal relationship between smoking initiation and risk-taking behaviour
suggesting that the smoking initiation SNPs might be capturing an underlying impulsivity
phenotype (Supplementary Table S6) and this could explain why we only observed effects of
smoking initiation on suicidal behaviour and not for the other smoking phenotypes. Rucker’s
Q tests showed some evidence of heterogeneity (Supplementary Table S1) and the MR
Egger intercept showed weak evidence of bias by directional pleiotropy (Supplementary
Table S2).

Discussion
The relationship between smoking and suicide-related behaviour is not clearly
understood and has important clinical implications1,2. In this study, our observational analysis
replicated previous observed associations between smoking behaviour and suicidal
behaviour, particularly between smoking initiation and suicidal attempts. We went on to
explore this association using a Mendelian Randomisation (MR) approach to understand if
the association is causal. Overall, the MR analyses, including the single SNP analysis, did
not support a causal interpretation. Therefore, despite past literature showing a positive
dose-response relationship, our results do not support a causal effect of smoking on suicide.
Our results show evidence of a relationship between smoking initiation and suicidal
ideation, but little evidence of an effect of lifetime smoking on suicidal ideation. Taken
together with weak evidence for a protective effect in the single SNP analysis, these
triangulated results overall suggest that there is only weak evidence for an effect of smoking
on increased risk of suicidal behaviours.
The potential role of impulsivity
The only evidence for smoking as a risk factor was when smoking initiation was the
genetic instrument. However, our follow up analyses suggest this could be due to the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19007013; this version posted October 25, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

instrument capturing underlying impulsivity. Smoking initiation is a complicated instrument
with both behavioural and biological components. This behavioural component is likely to be
related to impulsivity in part. This is supported by high genetic correlations between the two
phenotypes46. As there is a known correlation between impulsivity and suicidal behaviours,
we were mindful of this association. Therefore, to examine the impact of impulsivity on our
results we undertook a bi-directional MR of smoking initiation and risk-taking. We showed
strong evidence of a bi-directional causal relationship between smoking initiation and risktaking behaviour suggesting that our results might be capturing impulsivity and not smoking.
This is further supported by the fact that when we are using other instruments of smoking
behaviour (e.g. lifetime smoking and smoking heaviness) we did not see any evidence for an
effect.
Self-harm is the result of complex interactions of personality factors, including
impulsivity, social factors and mental state47. It is well established that impulsivity is an
important risk factor for suicidal attempts48. It has been shown that impulsivity increases with
exposure to nicotine, returns to a normal levels with abstinence and increases with rechallenge after abstinence49,50. The association with suicidal attempts is not found in former
smokers and this therefore supports the link between smoking and impulsivity7,13,14,51. This
interaction between impulsivity, smoking initiation and suicidal attempts is complex and
requires further research.
Recent theoretical models of suicide (i.e. integrated motivational volitional model52),
all fit with the ‘ideation to action’ framework which posits that the development of suicidal
ideation and progression from ideation to attempts are distinct processes with separate risk
factors and explanations53. This has clearly important implications in clinical practice and risk
management. Few studies have examined smoking within an ‘ideation to action’ framework.
A cross-sectional study found suicide attempters were more likely than ideators to be current
smokers54. However, in the National Comorbidity Survey, early onset nicotine dependence
was prospectively associated with suicide plans but not attempts amongst those with
ideation12. Our single SNP analysis would support the idea of suicidal ideation and attempts

being separate processes, differentially affected by smoking heaviness and this
differentiation is an important area which requires further research.
Strengths and limitations
This study has many strengths, being the first to our knowledge to use the method of
Mendelian randomisation to explore the association between smoking and suicide. We
triangulated across multiple methods, multiple smoking behaviours and multiple suicidal
behaviours to improve causal inference. However, the power of these analyses was limited
by sample size. The single SNP analysis, designed to test the effect of smoking heaviness
on suicidal behaviour, included small numbers of those experiencing suicidal thoughts and
suicide attempts and was therefore underpowered. However, if anything the trend of
association was in the opposite direction to what was hypothesised. It should also be noted
that the sample size includes only non-fatal suicide attempts, and therefore our definition of
suicide attempts is narrow. We were also limited by the UK Biobank questions asked for
suicidal ideation and attempt. Suicidal attempt questions refer to lifetime attempts but
suicidal ideation questions refer to symptoms. Another possible limitation is bias from
reverse causation. As attempts were unsuccessful, a pathway from attempts to smoking
initiation is possible. Furthermore, steiger filtering estimated that over half of the smoking
initiation genetic instruments explained more variance in suicide attempts than smoking
initiation.
Conclusion
This was the first MR study to explore the effect of smoking on suicidal behaviours.
Our results suggest that, despite observed associations, when we triangulate across multiple
MR methods, there was little evidence for a causal effect of smoking behaviour on suicidal
behaviour. It supports recent literature to suggest that suicidal ideation and attempts might
need to be thought of as different processes and it has highlighted the complexity of
unpicking the behavioural from biological components of smoking behaviours. Our evidence
suggests that further research is needed into alternative risk factors for suicide which might
make better intervention targets.
