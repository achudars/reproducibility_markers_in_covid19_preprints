Abstract
Background: Children with night cough but no wheeze might have a mild form of asthma
(cough variant asthma), sharing risk factors with children who wheeze, and possibly
developing wheeze later.
Methods: We compared risk factors of children with isolated night cough and children with
wheeze in the Leicester Respiratory Cohort study at ages 1, 4, 6, and 9 years. We also
compared prognoses of children with isolated night cough, children with wheeze, and
asymptomatic children.
Results: Among 4,101 children at age 1 year, 2,854 at 4, 2,369 at 6, and 1,688 at 9 years, the
prevalence of isolated night cough was 10% at age 1 and 18% in older children, while
prevalence of wheeze decreased from 35% at 1 year to 13% at age 9. Although many risk
factors were the same for cough and wheeze, day care, reflux, and family history of bronchitis
were more strongly associated with cough, and male sex and family history of asthma with
wheeze. Over one-third of pre-schoolers with cough continued to cough at school age, but
their risk of developing wheeze was similar to that of children asymptomatic at earlier
surveys. Wheeze tracked more strongly throughout childhood than cough.
Conclusions: Some risk factors for cough and wheeze were shared and some were not; there
was little evidence that children with isolated night cough have an increased risk of future
wheeze. This suggests that only a fraction of children with isolated night cough might have a
variant of asthma, if at all.

Introduction
Cough is common among children, accounts for many consultations, and can affect quality of
life.(1, 2) Most commonly caused by upper or lower respiratory tract infections, cough is
usually self-limiting. However, some children cough more frequently, also apart from
infections.(3, 4) Many of these children suffer from asthma and experience wheeze and
shortness of breath in addition to cough. Others have isolated frequent cough, without wheeze
or dyspnoea.(5, 6) In epidemiological studies, these are children who report dry cough at night
and cough apart from colds, but no wheeze. It has been postulated, that many of them have
cough variant asthma (CVA),(7-10) a phenotype of mild asthma with cough as sole
symptom.(11) Patients with CVA have been characterized as having a family or personal
history of atopy, eosinophilic inflammation, a high bronchial reactivity, a positive response to
bronchodilators, positive exercise provocation tests, cough triggered by exercise, and an
increased risk for developing wheeze or typical asthma later.(10, 12-16) The existence of
CVA as a disease entity is disputed, though, and several authors have said that isolated cough
is a poor marker for wheeze and asthma, and should not be treated as such.(8, 17-20)

The epidemiology of isolated cough in children is not well studied, while risk factors(21-23)
and natural history(24, 25) of wheeze have been described extensively. Previous publications
on isolated cough were mostly non-systematic reviews,(9, 10, 26) small clinical studies with
fewer than 50 patients,(13, 14, 27) or studies that focused on adults.(28-30) Studies that
compare children with cough to children with wheeze and asymptomatic children in the same
population are scarce.(18, 31, 32) Drawing on the dataset from the Leicester 1998 cohort
studies, we compared risk factors of children with isolated cough and those with wheeze, and
we compared prognoses of children with isolated cough, children with wheeze, and those with
neither symptom.

Materials and methods
Study design and population
We analysed data from a large, prospective population-based cohort, the Leicester Respiratory
Cohort (LRC).(33) Perinatal and growth data were collected from birth records and health
visitor records. The postal questionnaires collected information on cough, wheeze, and
environmental exposures from parents when children were aged 1 year (in 1998), and
thereafter at the children’s ages of 4 (in 2001), 6 (in 2003), and 9 years (in 2006). This study
includes all LRC children who were born between May 1996 and April 1997, and who
completed the baseline questionnaire in 1998 (4,101). Among these, 2,854 (70%) returned the
questionnaire at age 4 (in 2001), 2,369 (58%) at age 6 (in 2003) and 1,688 (41%) at age 9 (in
2006).
The Leicestershire Health Authority Research Ethics Committee approved the study (approval
numbers 1132, 5005, 4867).

Current wheeze and night cough
We used the questions on current wheeze and dry cough at night, apart from a cough
associated with a cold or a chest infection, from the ISAAC key questionnaire.(34) At each
survey, we distinguished three mutually exclusive groups of children based on their symptoms
during the previous 12 months: children with isolated night cough but no wheeze, children
with wheeze with or without cough, and asymptomatic children with neither cough nor
wheeze.

Risk factors
We compiled a list of potential risk factors for cough and wheeze from the literature.(18, 23,
31, 35) These included demographic factors (sex, ethnicity), family (parental) asthma,
bronchitis, hay fever, and eczema, exposure to infections (household crowding, day care
attendance, older siblings), environmental exposures (cooking with gas, tobacco smoke
exposure, pet ownership), socioeconomic factors (maternal education, Townsend deprivation
index(36)), and perinatal/early life factors (gestational age, birth weight, maternal age,
breastfeeding, reflux in infancy). We also considered clinical data at three surveys—atopic
diseases (rhinitis, hay fever, eczema) and ear, nose, and throat (ENT) symptoms (frequent
colds, snoring, otitis)—as potential predictors of wheeze and cough at the next survey.

Attendance at day care, reflux, ethnicity, family history, older siblings, and perinatal and early
life factors were only assessed at age 1 in 1998.

Statistical analyses
We calculated the prevalence of isolated cough and wheeze at ages 1, 4, 6, and 9 years, and
then investigated risk factors for isolated cough and wheeze at each age using multinomial
logistic regression. We calculated univariable relative risk ratios (RRRs) with 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) for isolated cough and for wheeze compared to the reference category of
asymptomatic children. In adjusted models, we included all risk factors that were associated
with either cough or wheeze in the univariable model (p<0.1). We used Wald tests to compare
whether RRRs differed between cough and wheeze.

We then investigated the prognoses of children with isolated cough, wheeze, and none of
these symptoms by calculating the proportion of children who had the same phenotype at the
next survey, and of those who transitioned to another phenotype. We did this for the three
different periods from ages 1 to 4, 4 to 6, and 6 to 9 years. We used an overall chi-square test
of independence between symptoms at baseline and symptoms at follow-up to assess whether
prognosis differed between children with isolated cough, children with wheeze, and children
with none of the symptoms. We subsequently performed a subgroup analysis to test whether
children with isolated cough had a higher risk of developing wheeze than asymptomatic
children using Fisher’s exact test.

Finally, we assessed potential predictors of prognosis, i.e. persistence of cough or incidence of
wheeze 2-3 years later, in children who had cough at baseline. We fitted univariable and
adjusted models including all variables that were associated in the univariable model (p<0.1).
In addition to environmental factors, we also investigated whether clinical data at baseline
(atopic diseases and ENT symptoms) helped to predict outcome at the next survey.(37, 38)
The layout of our study is shown in Figure 1.

Fig 1. Study design: prevalence of wheeze and isolated cough at ages 1, 4, 6, and 9 years, and
factors associated with prevalence and prognosis of these symptoms. The size of rectangular boxes
represents the respective number of children with cough, wheeze, or no symptoms, and the width of
the arrows semiquantitatively demonstrates the likelihood to stay in the same or change to a different
group at subsequent surveys.

We performed sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our findings. While the main
analysis included all children, who participated in the baseline survey at the age of 1 and one
or more of the following surveys at 4, 6, or 9 years, the sensitivity analysis included only
children who participated in all four surveys (1,318 children, 32% of 4,101). Results from this
sensitivity analysis were very similar to the main analysis (available from the authors). We
prepared and analysed the data using Stata 14.0 (Stata Corporation LP, Austin, Texas, USA)
and created the figures using R version 3.1.1 (Free Software Foundation, Boston, USA).

Results

The characteristics of the 4,101 participants of the 1998 survey are shown in Table 1.
Prevalence of isolated night cough was 10% in 1-year-olds and 18% in 4-, 6- and 9-year-olds
(S1 Table). Prevalence of wheeze declined from 35% in 1-year-olds to 17%, 14%, and 13%
respectively in children aged 4, 6, and 9 years.

Risk factors for prevalent cough and wheeze
Some risk factors were shared between children with isolated night cough and wheeze, others
differed, and risk factors also varied with age. Results are shown in Table 2 for children aged
1 year and S2-S4 Tables for children aged 4, 6, and 9 years. The tables report RRRs for
children with cough and wheeze compared to asymptomatic children and similarity p-values,
which indicate the difference in strength of association between children with wheeze and
those with isolated cough. Figures 2-4 and S1 Figure summarize the same results
graphically.

The risk factors that were shared for isolated cough or wheeze were family history of
bronchitis, low socioeconomic status, exposure to smoking, and reflux (posseting or vomiting
in infancy). Factors that were associated mainly with cough were South Asian ethnicity, day
care attendance (age 1), paternal smoking, and use of gas for cooking (age 4). Several factors
were more important for wheeze. Boys had a higher risk for wheeze at all ages, but a lower
risk for cough at ages 6 and 9. A family history of asthma or hay fever was associated with
wheeze only. Maternal smoking and presence of older siblings were more strongly associated
with wheeze at age 1. Low birthweight, preterm birth, and lack of breastfeeding were
associated mainly with wheeze. Similarity p-values suggested that associations differed
significantly between wheeze and cough for sex and family history of asthma at all ages;
ethnicity, day care attendance, and older siblings at age 1; and cooking with gas, exposure to
smoking, low socioeconomic status, and preterm birth at age 4 (Table 2, S2-S4 Tables).

Prognosis of isolated night cough and wheeze
Prognosis differed between children with wheeze, those with isolated night cough, and those
who had no such symptoms ˗ for all intervals studied from ages 1 to 4, 4 to 6, and 6 to 9 years
(overall p-values <0.001, Figure 5, S5 Table). The proportion of children with isolated
cough, whose cough persisted, increased from 32% (99/305) between age 1 and 4, to 42%
(160/381) from age 4 to 6, and 39% (97/249) from age 6 to 9 years. Wheeze was more
persistent than cough. Among children with wheeze at age 1, 31% (283/921) wheezed at age 4
years. Among 4-year-olds with wheeze, 48% (151/315) wheezed again at age 6, and among 6year-olds with wheeze, 59% (98/165) reported wheeze at age 9.

Fig 5. Prognosis and tracking of respiratory symptoms in children. Proportion of children with
wheeze, isolated night cough, or none of the symptoms, who have wheeze, cough, or are
asymptomatic 2-3 years later. This figure shows prognosis for 3 different development periods in
childhood (1 to 4 years, 4 to 6 years, 6 to 9 years).

The risk of developing new (incident) wheeze at the next survey was not higher in children
with isolated cough than in asymptomatic children, with the possible exception of infants,
among whom 17% with isolated night cough reported wheeze 3 years later compared to 9% in
asymptomatic children (p<0.001). In children aged 4 or 6 years, we found no evidence that
the risk of wheeze at the next survey differed in those with isolated cough and those with
neither cough nor wheeze.

Predictors of future symptoms in children with cough
Factors associated with prognosis of isolated night cough are shown in Table 3. Some factors
were associated with both persistent cough and incident wheeze, usually with stronger effect
sizes for later wheeze such as cough triggered by laughter (4 to 6) or by aeroallergens (6 to 9)
and hay fever (6 to 9). Persistence of cough was not strongly associated with any of the tested
environmental or perinatal factors from ages 1 to 4, 4 to 6 or 6 to 9 years (Table 3). Clinical
factors helped predict persistent cough in older children: from age 4 to 6 years, rhinitis, cough
triggered by laughter/crying, and snoring predicted persistence of isolated night cough; from 6
to 9 years, children with frequent infections (frequent colds, otitis) or allergies (hay fever,
cough triggered by aeroallergens) were more likely to have persistent cough 3 years later.

Some factors were associated with progression from isolated cough to wheeze, particularly in
older children. Children with isolated night cough who had a family history of asthma had an
increased risk of later wheeze in all age groups. Children whose cough was triggered by
aeroallergens or by laughter/crying at age 4 years had an increased risk of wheeze at age 6.
Children who had also rhinitis, hay fever, eczema, cough triggered by aeroallergens, snoring
or exposure to pets at age 6 years had an increased risk of incident wheeze at age 9 years
(Table 3).

Discussion
In this large population-based study, which compared risk factors and prognosis of isolated
night cough with wheeze in different age groups from infancy to school age, some risk factors
were shared for cough and wheeze, while others differed. Persistence of symptoms was
stronger for wheeze than for cough and was higher in older children. Overall, we found no
clear evidence that isolated night cough progressed to wheeze.

Risk factors for cough have been little studied, mainly in clinical settings,(1, 39, 40) and
rarely in the general population.(18, 31) A cross-sectional Danish study of 2,978 5-year-olds
reported male sex, low gestational age, maternal asthma, and housing conditions as risk
factors for wheeze, but not for isolated cough; it proposed that the aetiology differs for the
two phenotypes.(31) The Tucson Children’s Respiratory Study of 987 6-year-olds, identified
parental history of bronchitis and passive smoking as risk factors for cough without colds.(18)
Passive smoking and day care attendance have been reported as risk factors for isolated cough
by other studies.(41-43) A Finish study reported that 7 to 12-year-olds with isolated night
cough had an intermediate prevalence of parental asthma and allergies compared to children
with wheeze and asymptomatic children, and suggested that this supports the existence of
CVA.(44) In contrast, a cross-sectional Australian study of 1,165 schoolchildren found no
differences between children with persistent isolated cough and asymptomatic children with
respect to family history of asthma or allergy, parental smoking, and atopic status, and
concluded that children with isolated cough are unlikely to have asthma.(17) In our study we
found risk factors that were similar for cough and wheeze, like family history of bronchitis
and reflux, and others that differed (including ethnicity, sex, family history of asthma, and day
care attendance).

Prognosis of isolated cough in children also has received little attention in previous studies.
We found that both cough and wheeze tracked more strongly with increasing age. As depicted
by the width of the arrows, Figure 1 shows how wheeze tracked more than cough. But we
found no evidence that the risk of developing wheeze was higher in children with isolated
cough than it was in asymptomatic children. In the first LRC (482 children born 1985-90, no
overlap with our study population), 37% of 3-year-olds with cough without colds continued to
cough at age 6 years, and 7% developed wheeze.(45) This is similar to what we found from
age 4 to 6 years in the second LRC: 42% continued coughing and 8% developed wheeze.

Some studies have investigated whether children with night cough progress to wheeze or
asthma, but did not assess persistence of cough.(46-48) Among the 3,252 children of the
PIAMA birth cohort, less than 10% of children with isolated night cough at age 2-7 years
developed asthma at age 8, and this was comparable to asymptomatic children.(46) The
Tucson Children’s Respiratory Cohort found that cough without colds at age 2 persisted in
40% of children by age 6, and in 35% from age 6-11. Risk factors for cough persistence were
parental smoking from age 2-6 and atopy from age 6-11.(18) We found that schoolchildren
with isolated cough have an increased risk for future wheeze if they also suffer from rhinitis,
hay fever, or cough triggered by known asthma triggers. Overall, though, children with
isolated cough did not have a substantially higher risk of developing wheeze than
asymptomatic peers.

This is the first study to compare risk factors and prognosis among children with isolated
cough and children with wheeze in a large childhood cohort from the general population. It
employed consistent methodology with standardized questions to assess symptoms and
environmental factors in four surveys. It is also the first study to have investigated factors that
predict persistence of cough and incidence of wheeze. Among its limitations is its dependence
on parental reports, which may be prone to reporting bias.(49) This reflects however a reality
in primary care: the physician, too, must rely upon parental reporting of symptoms.

What do children with isolated night cough have in common with children who wheeze? The
possibility that CVA underlies isolated cough was a principal motivator of this study. While
CVA may be characterized with information on atopy, response to asthma medication,
bronchial reactivity, and later wheeze, our study could assess only parent-reported symptoms
and risk of later wheeze. We did not have information on bronchial hyper-responsiveness and
response to bronchodilators.

Our overall finding that risk factors for cough and wheeze in children only partially overlap
suggests that children with isolated night cough do not have an increased risk of future
wheeze. Only a fraction of children with isolated night cough, if any, might have a variant of
asthma.

S2 Table. Risk factors for prevalent isolated night cough and wheeze in 4-year-old children
(N=2,854). Association of different factors with cough and wheeze, compared to asymptomatic
children, in an unadjusted and adjusted model presented as relative risk ratio estimates with
confidence intervals. Cough was defined as isolated night cough (without wheeze).

S3 Table. Risk factors for prevalent isolated night cough and wheeze in 6-year-old children
(N=2,369). Association of different factors with cough and wheeze, compared to asymptomatic
children, in unadjusted and adjusted models presented as relative risk ratio estimates with confidence
intervals. Cough was defined as isolated night cough (without wheeze).

S4 Table. Risk factors for prevalent isolated night cough and wheeze in 9-year-old children
(N=1,688). Association of different factors with cough and wheeze, compared to asymptomatic
children, in unadjusted and adjusted models presented as relative risk ratio estimates with confidence
intervals. Cough was defined as isolated night cough (without wheeze).

S1 Fig. Risk factors for prevalent isolated night cough and wheeze at age 1 year (N=4,101).
Association of different factors with cough and with wheeze, compared to asymptomatic children, in a
fully adjusted model (adjusted for all covariates with p-values <0.10 for either cough or wheeze in
univariable models), presented as relative risk ratio estimates with confidence intervals. Cough was
defined as night cough without wheeze.

S5 Table. Prognosis of isolated night cough and wheeze from age 1-4 years, 4-6 years, 6-9 years.
Prognosis shown for all children who were aged 1 in 1998, and who replied to the questionnaires in
the respective surveys. Cough was defined as night cough without wheeze.
