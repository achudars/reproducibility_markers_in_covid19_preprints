Abstract
Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is marked by a loss of motor automaticity, resulting in
decreased control of step length during gait. Rhythmic auditory cues (metronomes or music) may
enhance automaticity by adjusting cadence. Both metronomes and music may offer distinct
advantages, but prior attempts at quantifying their influence on spatiotemporal aspects of gait
have been confounded by altered gait speeds from overground walking. We hypothesized that
when gait speed is fixed, individuals with PD would experience difficulty in modifying cadence
due to the concomitant requirement to alter step length, with greater changes noted with
metronomes compared to music cues.
Research Question: Can a metronome or music promote spatiotemporal adjustments when
decoupled from changes in gait speed in individuals with PD?
Methods: 21 participants with PD were instructed to time their steps to a metronome and music
cues (at 85%, 100%, and 115% of overground cadence) during treadmill walking. We calculated
cadence, cadence accuracy, and step length during each cue condition and an uncued control
condition. We compared the various cue frequencies and auditory modalities.
Results: At fixed gait speeds, participants were able to increase and decrease cadence in response
to auditory cues. Music and metronome cues produced comparable results in cadence
manipulation with greater cadence errors noted at slower intended frequencies. Nevertheless, the
induced cadence changes created a concomitant alteration in step length, with music and
metronomes producing comparable changes. Notably, longer step lengths were induced with
both music and metronome during slow frequency cueing.
Significance: This important change conflicts with conventional prescriptive approaches, which
advocate for faster cue frequencies, if applied on a treadmill. The music and metronome cues

Introduction:
The characteristic short, shuffling steps and tendency of individuals with Parkinson’s
disease (PD) to freeze during walking are often attributed to diminished automaticity [1-3].
Rhythmic auditory cueing is a well-established intervention intended to address these deficits in
gait automaticity by adjusting cadence [4]. Previous studies have used either music or a
metronome to provide the auditory cues [2, 5]. Despite the potential advantages to both
metronomes and music, prior attempts at quantifying their influence on spatiotemporal aspects of
gait have been confounded by altered gait speeds from overground walking [6]. Thus, it remains
unclear if either auditory modality can promote the intended spatiotemporal adjustments when
decoupled from changes in gait speed.
A key benefit of a metronome is that the beat is discrete, enabling synchronization
between the individual’s steps and the beat [5, 7]. Music, however, which may be more
enjoyable than a metronome and is used commonly during exercise, may be less effective than
the metronome due to the many layers of rhythms and beats that make musical sounds
continuous rather than discrete [8]. Any difficulty in identifying the beat of a song may make it
more challenging to adjust step timing appropriately. Nevertheless, several studies have
examined the effect of music on gait mechanics, and have found a generally favorable
association between the use of music cues and increased stride length [2, 9-11]. Potentially
confounding these promising results, however, is the fact that these studies typically used a
single musical track that was engineered to accentuate the rhythm to enhance detection.
Nevertheless, direct comparisons of gait mechanics while stepping to either music or metronome
cues are rare. In studies involving healthy older adults, metronome cues elicit greater
synchronization compared to music cues [7]. However, both music and metronome cues

effectively increased cadence, with only the musical cues leading to a concomitant increase in
stride length and gait velocity of healthy older adults [12].
Although the use of auditory cues has the potential to improve gait in individuals with
PD, we are unaware of evidence to support the preferential use of music or metronomes in this
population [5]. The purpose of this study was therefore to determine the difference in
spatiotemporal gait measures induced by stepping to the beat of a metronome and to music cues
of various frequencies. Importantly, prior work examining the use of auditory cues has involved
over-ground walking, [10] allowing participants to change gait speed in response to different
frequency cues. Because cadence and step length are both influenced by gait speed, [13] we used
treadmill gait to carefully assess potential changes in spatiotemporal gait parameters across
various auditory cue conditions, without the confounding influence of altered gait speed. Given
the shortened step lengths observed in individuals with PD [14, 15], we were particularly
concerned that individuals would exhibit difficulty in decreasing their cadence on the treadmill,
because this would require a necessary increase in step length. Because gait speed was fixed on
the treadmill, we hypothesized that attempts to decrease cadence (and increase step length)
would be more challenging than attempts to increase cadence (and decrease step length). We
further hypothesized that an inability to discern the tempo in the music accurately would reduce
cadence accuracy compared to stepping with a metronome [7]. As a result, we believe that
changes in spatiotemporal measures will be particularly evident with metronome cues compared
to music cues.

We recruited individuals from the UNC Movement Disorders Clinic and through local
support groups to participate in this study. Participants who met the following criteria were
included in this study: (1) medical diagnosis of PD [16] (Hoehn & Yahr I-III), (2) self-reported
ability to walk >10 m overground without physical assistance, and (3) self-reported ability to
walk on a treadmill for 14 minutes (with rest breaks as needed). Potential participants were
excluded due to a Hoehn & Yahr Stage IV or V, the presence of uncontrolled cardiorespiratory
or metabolic disease (i.e. uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus), other
neurological or orthopedic disorders that may affect walking, or severe communication or
comprehension impairments that would impede the ability to perform study procedures
appropriately. All participants signed an informed consent form approved by the Institutional
Review Board of UNC-Chapel Hill prior to participation. The project was listed on
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03253965).
Each participant completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at the beginning
of the testing session to characterize cognitive deficits. They then walked over a 6.1 m (20 foot)
Zeno pressure mat (Prokinetics, Haverton, PA) to measure comfortable overground gait speed
and cadence without the presence of auditory cues. We used the overground gait speed to guide
treadmill speed selection, and the overground cadence to determine the three target frequencies
for auditory cues: 85%, 100%, and 115%.
Testing consisted of having all subjects walk during each of the following seven
conditions on an instrumented treadmill: (1) no auditory cues (Control), (2) timing their steps to
a metronome set to 85% of over-ground cadence, (3) Metronome at 100%, (4) Metronome at
115%, (5) Music at 85%, (6) Music at 100%, and (7) Music at 115%. Each subject selected their
own songs that matched the target frequencies from www.bpmdatabase.com. Importantly,

participants selected a different song for each Music condition to correspond with the target
frequencies. This was necessary to play each song at its correct tempo, rather than artificially
slowing down or speeding up a single song. Conditions were block randomized for each
participant, by type of auditory cue (music or metronome). Frequencies were randomized within
each block. We always conducted the condition with no auditory stimuli (Control) first.
Participants were verbally instructed to “step to the beat” of the music or metronome, [17] but no
demonstration was provided. With each new condition, participants took ~15 seconds to adjust to
the tempo before we sampled one minute of data. Rest breaks were provided between conditions,
as needed. All participants had been on a treadmill at some point previously, but for safety
purposes, each subject wore a harness that attached to the ceiling over the treadmill. The harness
did not provide any body weight support and did not restrict limb motion. Handrails were
available on the sides of the treadmill, though participants were discouraged from using them.
Prior to walking on the treadmill (Bertec Corp, Columbus, OH), a single 14 mm retroreflective marker was taped to the posterior heel of each shoe. While walking, an eight camera
motion capture system (Vicon MX, Los Angeles, CA) sampled the 3D location of both markers
at 120 Hz. Ground reaction forces were measured simultaneously using the treadmill’s force
plates at 1200 Hz.
Data Processing & Outcome Measures
Marker trajectories and ground reaction forces were smoothed with a dual-pass 6 Hz and
20 Hz low pass Butterworth filter, respectively. A custom Labview program (National
Instruments, Austin, TX) calculated cadence and step length for each condition. Cadence was
measured as the inverse of step time, determined from successive heel strikes when the vertical
ground reaction force exceeded 20 N. We also computed a cadence ‘error’ as the difference

between the measured cadence and the target (intended) cadence. Step length was calculated by
measuring the anterior-posterior distance between the right and left heel markers at each heel
strike.
Data Analysis
Data analysis was performed using SPSS (ver 25, IBM, Chicago, IL). We first assessed
the cadence error using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA, repeated for cue type
(music/metronome) and frequency (85, 100, 115% of overground cadence). The actual cadence
was then compared to the intended cadence using paired samples t-tests. We then used a one-way
repeated measures ANOVA to assess the specific effect of cueing on cadence compared to the
uncued (control) condition. Finally, step length changes were assessed using a two-way repeated
measures ANOVA. In the presence of significant main effects, we performed one-way ANOVAs
or paired sample t-tests with a Bonferroni correction for post-hoc analyses, as appropriate. Prior
to recruitment, we conducted a formal power analysis using G*Power to determine the proposed
sample size. Our estimates were based on current literature and expected findings. In particular,
Wittwer and colleagues [12] evaluated the effect of both music and a metronome on similar
measures in unimpaired older adults. Although the population was different and they did not
evaluate different frequencies, we used their results to estimate that we would need 18
participants to observe an effect size of 0.4 with an alpha of 0.05 and power of .80. Given the
differences in test populations and the additional measures of frequency, we chose to be
conservative and slightly over-recruit.

Twenty-one individuals with PD participated in this study (13M/8F; age: 69.8±9.8 years,
MOCA: 27.0±2.9, UPDRS: 19.4±13.7). With an average time since diagnosis of 8.8±8.1 years,
we recruited five individuals classified as H&Y stage 1, nine individuals at stage 2, and seven at
stage 3. The average over-ground gait speed was 1.15±0.21 m·s-1 and the average treadmill speed
used for testing was 1.10±0.26 m·s-1 (p=.107; d=.37). Except for three participants who walked
slower on the treadmill than their typical overground speed, all other participants were able to
match their typical overground speed during treadmill testing.
We sought to determine how well participants were able to match their actual cadence
with the intended cadence. We observed a cue x frequency interaction in cadence accuracy
(p=.007, ߟ௣ଶ =.221, Figure 1). In particular, we noted greater cadence errors produced with music
compared to the metronome at the 115% target only (p=.003; d=.73). The metronome and music
cues produced comparable cadence accuracy at all other target frequencies (p>.243).
Nevertheless, participants were not able to achieve the intended cadence consistently.
Specifically, we observed a higher actual cadence than what was intended for the 85%
Metronome (p<.001; d=1.07) and 85% Music (p<.001; d=1.29) conditions. Additionally, we
observed a lower cadence than intended in the 115% Music condition (p=.002; d=.75).
Although participants were not consistently achieving the target cadence, the auditory
cues influenced cadence compared to walking without auditory cueing (p<.001, ߟ௣ଶ = .683, Figure
2). Compared to walking without auditory cueing, participants decreased their cadence while
stepping to the 85% Metronome (p<.001; d=1.21) and 85% Music (p<.001; d=.96) conditions,
whereas the 115% metronome condition elicited an increase in cadence (p=.004; d=1.47). Cues
at 100% of overground cadence (metronome: p=1.00; d=.19; music: p=1.00; d=.14) and 115%
music (p=.069; d=.86) did not alter cadence compared to walking without auditory cueing.

With regards to step length, a cue x frequency interaction was observed (p=.008,

ߟ௣ଶ =.215, Figure 3). Although there were no differences in step length between the music and
metronome at the 85% (p=.141; d=.33) and 100% (p=.478; d=.16) conditions, we observed that
shorter step lengths were observed with the metronome compared to walking with music at the
115% condition (p=.004; d=.71). Furthermore, walking with the metronome elicited longer steps
during the 85% condition (10% increase; p<.001; d=.48), and shorter steps during the 115%
condition (11% decrease; p<.001; d=.49) compared to walking with no cueing. Likewise, our
analysis of walking with music elicited 7% longer steps during the 85% condition (p=.003;
d=.34), and 6% shorter steps during the 115% condition (p=.017; d=.30) compared to walking
with no cueing. To put the change into context, we sought minimal detectable change (MDC)
values, but were only able to find within-session values for individuals post-stroke [18]. Notably,
19 of the 21 participants exceeded that MDC (i.e., 2.6 cm step length) during one of the 85%
conditions, with an average step length increase of 5.7 cm for the 85% metronome condition and
4.0 cm for the 85% music condition.

Discussion
This study sought to determine how metronome and music cues of different frequencies
would alter spatiotemporal gait parameters for individuals with PD. We observed clear responses
based on cueing frequency, but did not observe substantial differences between the metronome
and music cues. Therefore, we can reject our hypothesis that metronome cues would elicit a
greater response than music cues. We likewise reject our hypothesis that walking with slower
frequency cues would not yield a large decrease in cadence. Instead, we found that these slow
frequency cues (i.e., 85% of typical overground cadence) produced significantly slower cadence,

with the necessary concomitant increase in step length, despite the fact that participants did not
match the intended cadence. These findings have implications for identifying parameters of
auditory cues that are effective for facilitating longer step length in individuals with PD during
treadmill ambulation.
Step lengths are already notably shorter in individuals with PD [19]. Thus, therapists
require approaches that have the capability of reliably increasing step length. Indeed, we found
that walking on a treadmill with a slower (i.e., 85%) cue frequency generates a longer step
length, whereas faster cues (115%) lead to a shorter step length. Our findings may appear to
contrast with previous studies that demonstrated that faster cadence cues yield increased stride
length,[20] or that stride length does not change with cue frequency [21-23]. Of note, however, is
that these prior studies were performed overground and the resulting ability to change gait speed
could contribute to these discrepant findings. The results of our study extend prior work by
demonstrating that when we control speed with the treadmill, people with PD are able to take
consistently longer steps with exposure to metronome cues at frequencies slower than their
comfortable cadence. Future work will be needed to generalize these results to an overground
environment.
Prior work on auditory cueing advocates for the use of higher frequencies to increase
stride length and gait speed [5, 10, 24]. However, our data clearly suggest that if individuals with
PD practice walking on a treadmill, the use of higher frequency cues will result in shorter steps,
which may exacerbate their deficits. This is particularly relevant, because therapists commonly
use treadmills to provide relevant external physical cues to enhance the automaticity of gait [25]
and promote consistent stepping practice [26, 27]. Coupling treadmill walking with higher

frequency cues, however, would be counterproductive. Instead, we propose that pairing slower
auditory cues with treadmill walking would encourage longer steps.
For the purposes of applying these findings to therapy for individuals with PD, it is
noteworthy that we observed increases in step length, despite participants’ inability to
synchronize their steps to the beat. Surprisingly, the inability to step at the intended frequency
occurred with both music and metronome cues, and suggests that the observed error may have
had little to do with the cue itself. Instead, we attribute the cadence error to participants
underlying timing impairment [3, 28]. Research involving unimpaired participants suggests that
the ability to synchronize steps to rhythmic auditory cues is improved with faster music and
music that the individual is familiar with [7, 29]. In our cohort of participants with PD, we can
speculate that the increased cadence error at slower frequencies was due to the difficulty in
concurrently having to take a longer step. Such deficits in step length regulation may be due to
changes in the ‘gain’ of motor function [14], deficits in motivation or reward circuitry in the
basal ganglia, or a speed/accuracy tradeoff that influences energy cost [30].
Previously, musical cues have been associated with improvements in gait speed, cadence,
and stride length [9, 10, 24]. It was suggested that the continuity of sound inherent in musical
cues requires less cognitive demand than listening to cues that have a fixed beat, such as a
metronome [5]. Nevertheless, participants subjectively reported greater difficulty identifying the
tempo during music cues compared to the metronome cues. It is possible that some of the songs
were considered ‘low-groove music’ or that some of our participants exhibited deficits in beat
perception, which we did not measure [7]. Despite their perceived difficulty in identifying the
musical beats, we failed to identify consistent differences in gait parameters when using the

metronome or music cues. These data suggest that music may serve as a suitable surrogate to a
metronome in clinical practice.
Importantly, prior studies often used musical tracks that were designed specifically to
highlight the beat of the music to enable easy detection of the intended rhythm [11, 24]. This is
not always feasible or enjoyable to implement in the clinical or community setting. For this
reason, we allowed participants to select their own songs that coincided with the intended
frequency. Familiar music creates greater entrainment than unfamiliar music, perhaps due to less
cognitive demand [29]. Further, by allowing participants to select their own music, we believe
that we have a better representation of the effect of music use in a real world setting. Because
many people like to listen to music when they exercise or are active, this pragmatic approach is
easily translatable to clinical settings.
Limitations
There were several limitations to this study. First, is that some participants held onto the
rails while completing the walking trials on the treadmill. Although handrail use may alter stride
lengths for people with PD [26], all individuals requiring handrails used them consistently across
all conditions. This should presumably limit the effect on the within-subject comparisons that we
performed. Secondly, each participant selected different songs from potentially different genres.
It is also possible that we started these songs in a section where the beat may have been difficult
to distinguish. Because of our pragmatic design, we were unable to control this limitation
adequately without selecting a single song for use across subjects and conditions. Finally, we
tested a different number of participants for each Hoehn and Yahr stage, resulting in a slightly
larger number of participants classified as Stage 2 or 3. As a result, our results may not
generalize as well to individuals classified as Stage 1.

In conclusion, our study demonstrated that walking on a treadmill at constant speed with
slower auditory cueing could elicit reductions in cadence (with concomitant longer step lengths)
in patients with PD. This important change conflicts with conventional approaches, and was
apparent despite participant’s inability to synchronize their steps fully to the auditory cues. The
music and metronome cues produced comparable changes to gait, suggesting that either form of
cue may be effective at overcoming the shortened step lengths that are prevalent for individuals
with PD.
