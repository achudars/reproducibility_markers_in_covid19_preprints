Abstract

27

Objectives

28

We investigated the associations among blood pressure and cognitive functions across the

29

eighth decade, while accounting for anti-hypertensive medication and lifetime stability in

30

cognitive function.

31

Design

32

Prospective cohort study.

33

Setting

34

This study used data from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936) study, which recruited

35

participants living in the Lothian region of Scotland when aged 70 years, most of whom had

36

completed an intelligence test at age 11 years.

37

Participants

38

1091 members of the LBC1936 with assessments of cognitive ability in childhood and older

39

adulthood, and blood pressure measurements in older adulthood.

40

Primary and secondary outcome measures

41

Participants were followed up at ages 70, 73, 76, and 79, and latent growth curve models

42

and linear mixed models were used to analyse both cognitive functions and blood pressure

43

as primary outcomes.

44

Results

45

Blood pressure followed a quadratic trajectory in the eighth decade: on average blood

46

pressure rose in the first waves and subsequently fell. Intercepts and trajectories were not

47

associated between blood pressure and cognitive functions. Women with higher early-life

48

cognitive function generally had lower blood pressure during the eighth decade. Being

49

prescribed anti-hypertensive medication was associated with lower blood pressure, but not

50

with better cognitive function.

51

Conclusions

52

Our findings indicate an association between early-life cognitive function and later-life blood

53

pressure, specifically among women. However, we did not find support for the hypothesis

54

that rises in blood pressure and worse cognitive decline are associated with one another in

55

the eighth decade.

Strengths and limitations of this study
-

This study used direct blood pressure measurements to model a continuous blood

62

pressure score, as well as anti-hypertensive medication data, which were used to

63

adjust blood pressure measurements.

64

-

This study had comprehensive tests of cognitive ability measured in both childhood

65

and old age which allowed us to investigate whether childhood and old age cognitive

66

ability are distinctly related to blood pressure.

67

-

Latent growth curve modelling allowed us to evaluate whether changes in either

68

blood pressure or cognitive functions have downstream associations with one

69

another.

70

-

Larger samples and longer follow-up times, both from earlier and later in life, are

71

needed to understand the long-term relationships among blood pressure, anti-

72

hypertensive treatment, and cognitive functions.

Introduction
Hypertension is a major issue in middle and older age populations.1 2 Hypertension

77

has been consistently linked to cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease

78

(CAD) and stroke.1 3 It is also a risk factor for neurocognitive conditions such as age-related

79

cognitive decline, vascular dementia, and possibly Alzheimer’s disease.4 Accelerated

80

cognitive decline is associated with lower well-being, higher morbidity and mortality and, as

81

cognitive function worsens, the clinical conditions of mild cognitive impairment and dementia

82

can develop.5 Some of hypertension’s negative impacts on cognitive function have likely

83

causal pathways: hypertension disrupts cerebral blood vessel structure and function, and is

84

associated with stroke in relevant white matter regions.6 Worldwide, hypertension, age-

85

related cognitive decline, and dementia are on the rise.6 7

86

A major objective of modern gerontology is to understand how age-related cognitive

87

changes systematically differ between individuals and groups. Typically, hypertension is

88

thought of as a risk factor for later life cognitive decline. In some samples of older people,

89

hypertension is associated with lower cognitive functioning and faster decline.6 8 9 However,

90

there is also evidence for the relationship operating in the opposite direction, i.e. that higher

91

cognitive function in youth is associated with having lower risk of developing hypertension10

92

and experiencing hypertension-related stroke and coronary artery events later in life.11

93

These latter findings are part of a field known as cognitive epidemiology, which has found

94

that higher cognitive function in early life is associated with lower risk of a number of physical

95

and mental ailments later in life.12-16

96

Men are more likely to develop cardiovascular conditions than women,17 a reason

97

why men have been the subject of more intervention studies than women.18 Nevertheless,

98

cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both women and men.19 Some

99

differences in hypertension are biologically-based in differences between men and women,

100

e.g. through hormones and gene dosage from the sex chromosomes, and these differences

101

are consistent across different countries and ethnic groups.18 Additionally, traditional gender

102

roles are associated with men behaving in ways (e.g., higher smoking rates) that increase

103

their risk for physical health conditions, including hypertension.20 Previous work on the

104

cognitive epidemiology of hypertension, CAD, and stroke found significant interactions

105

between sex and cognitive function in youth: individuals with higher cognitive function were

106

at lower risk for hypertension, CAD, and stroke, and the associations were stronger in

107

women.11 21

108

In the present study we tested two hypotheses regarding the relationships between

109

cognitive functions, some of which steadily decline in mean level in older participants, and

110

hypertension, a condition that becomes increasingly common with age and is related to

111

cardiovascular health and cognitive impairment. First, we hypothesized that the association

112

between higher cognitive function at age 11 years and lower blood pressure in the eighth

113

decade of life is stronger in women than it is in men.11 Second, we tested the hypothesis that

114

cognitive function and blood pressure will be reciprocally associated with each other across

115

the eighth decade. We were able to test these hypotheses using multi-wave data from the

116

Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936), a narrow-age cohort of over 1000 community-dwelling

117

people, and longitudinal modelling of four waves of data that were collected from age 70 to

118

79 years. LBC1936 provides cognitive function data from age 11, as well as other control

119

variables, such as education, which has been implicated as a mediator in the relationship

120

between cognitive function in youth and cardiovascular risk,22-24 and a variety of related

121

behavioral and physical health variables.

Method

124

Participants

125

The Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936) is a community-dwelling sample of 1091

126

initially healthy individuals. All were born in 1936 and were at school in Scotland on 4 June

127

1947, when most took part in a group-administered intelligence test: the Moray House Test

(MHT) No. 12. They were followed up in four waves of one-to-one cognitive and health

129

testing between 2004 and 2017, at mean ages 70 (N = 1091), 73 (N = 866), 76 (N = 697),

130

and 79 (N = 550) years. Further details on the background, recruitment, attrition, and data

131

collection procedures are available.25 26 Participants provided written informed consent.

132

Descriptive statistics for the individual participating in each wave of the study are presented

133

in Table 1. Study completers only are described in supplementary table 1.

134

Cognitive functions

135

The Moray House Test No. 12 (MHT) is a broad cognitive ability test that includes

136

word classification, proverbs, spatial items, and arithmetic. The test correlated about 0.8 at

137

age 11 years with the Terman Merrill revision of the Stanford-Binet test, providing concurrent

138

validity.27

139

In older age, cognitive function is known to show decline across multiple, but not all,

140

subdomains.28 We assessed fluid cognitive ability, processing speed, and memory, all of

141

which decline on average with age. We also assessed crystallised ability, which remains

142

relatively stable in later life.29 There are strong correlations among the subdomains, and

143

because of this, cognitive function can be modelled hierarchically, with a general cognitive

144

function factor that captures overall ability. Beneath that general factor, specific subdomains

145

capture variation beyond general cognitive function.30 The relationships among cognitive

146

tests and subdomains are described in the Statistical Analyses section below. Cognitive

147

functions in waves 1–4 were assessed using 14 individually-administered cognitive tests at

148

the same clinical research facility and using the same equipment and procedure for all four

149

waves. The tests are fully described and referenced in an open-access protocol article.26

150

The fluid subdomain consisted of matrix reasoning and block design from the Wechsler Adult

151

Intelligence Scale (WAIS),31 and spatial span forward and backward from the Wechsler

152

Memory Scale (WMS.)32 Processing speed was measured through symbol search and digit

153

symbol substitution from the WAIS, plus four-choice reaction time33 and inspection time.34

154

Memory was assessed using verbal paired associates and logical memory from the WMS,32

155

and the letter–number sequencing and digit span backward subtests of the WAIS.31

156

Crystallised ability was measured through the National Adult Reading Test,35 Wechsler Test

157

of Adult Reading,36 and a phonemic verbal fluency test.37

160

Blood pressure
Blood pressure was measured six times at each wave, three times sitting and three

161

times standing. Blood pressure measurements were divided into systolic pressure

162

(maximum during one heartbeat) and diastolic pressure (minimum in between two

163

heartbeats).

164

Adjustments for anti-hypertensive medications were made to both systolic and

165

diastolic blood pressure. 15 points were added to systolic pressure and 10 points were

166

added to diastolic pressure38 if an individual was recorded as taking antihypertensive

167

medication, such as atenolol, lisinopril, bisoprolol, etc. at that wave.

168
169
170

Covariates
Sex and education were both included as covariates in all models. Education was

171

recorded as the total number of years spent in formal education. Age 11 cognitive function

172

was also included in all models, as was the interaction between sex and age 11 function.

173

Several behavioural and diagnosed health variable were included. Smoking status

174

was dummy coded with two variables, current smokers and ex-smokers, with non-smokers

175

as the reference group. Participants were genotyped for the presence of an APOE ε4 allele.

176

Cardiovascular disease and stroke history were both recorded for each wave; each was

177

coded as a binary variable, with a 1 indicating that the individual had a history of the disease.

178

Testing dates varied slightly for every individual at every wave, so the exact age of each

179

participant at testing was also recorded.

Statistical analyses
All four LBC1936 Waves were analysed in latent growth curve models (LGCMs), a

183

structural equation modelling technique that allows the user simultaneously to define and

184

analyse multiple latent and measured variables.39 For each variable modelled longitudinally,

185

LGCMs model level (i.e. an intercept) and slope (i.e. a trajectory of change) parameters. We

186

modelled blood pressure variables using a hierarchical ‘curve of factors’ model

187

(supplementary figure 1). At the bottom tier were individual systolic and diastolic readings

188

(only sitting readings were used for LGCMs), grouped by wave. For each grouping, both a

189

systolic and diastolic latent variable was specified, creating four latent variables each for

190

systolic and diastolic pressure, one each per wave. From these latent systolic and diastolic

191

variables, latent variables modelling growth were specified, in much the same way as with

192

cognitive function. To model overall blood pressure level, each of the eight lower-order latent

193

variables contributed its unit loaded value (i.e. x1). For blood pressure, the best fit models

194

were those that included both linear and quadratic slope latent variables. To model linear

195

slope of blood pressure, linearly increasing loadings were given as the average age at a

196

given wave progressed (x0, x2.96, x6.72, x9.79). To model quadratic slope, quadratically

197

increasing loadings were assigned (x0, x8.76, x45.16, x95.84).

198

We modelled cognitive function using a slightly different hierarchical ‘factor of

199

curves’ model, previously established with these data.30 For each cognitive test we modelled

200

a level (essentially the age 70 baseline) and a linear slope (the change between age 70 and

201

age 79, taking all four measurement occasions into account) with the same loadings as with

202

the age-respective blood pressure variables. For each cognitive domain (see Cognitive

203

Function above) a latent level and linear slope variable was correspondingly composed of

204

the individual tests’ latent level and latent slope variables. At the top of this cognitive

205

hierarchy, latent levels and slopes for general cognitive function were formed from the level

206

and slope variables of each cognitive domain. Similar models have been used and diagrams

208

variables and the associations among them is presented in supplementary figure 2.

209

Put simply, BP level is analogous to BP at the study’s beginning (age 70 years), BP

210

slope is analogous to the linear magnitude at which BP increases or decreases over the

211

following decade, and BP quadratic (slope) is analogous to the curvature of the change in

212

BP over the following decade. Cognitive function level is analogous to cognitive function at

213

age 70, and is known to be highly correlated with cognitive function at age 11,30

214

demonstrating some stability of individual differences in cognitive function across the life

215

course. Slopes of cognitive function represent the rate at which cognitive functions change

216

(mostly decrease, in fact) over subsequent waves, which is otherwise known as cognitive

217

decline.

218

Covariates that applied to all waves of data (sex, age 11 cognitive function, their

219

interaction, years of education, and smoking history) were associated with the intercept and

220

slope parameters for latent levels and slopes, including those for the domains of cognitive

221

function, but not onto individual cognitive tests’ levels or slopes. APOE ε4 status only applied

222

to cognitive function latent variables. Individual systolic and diastolic BP measurements were

223

associated with characteristics of individual waves: age at testing, cardiovascular disease

224

history, and stroke history.

225

Model parameters were estimated using full-information maximum likelihood, i.e. all

226

data were used for all participants, even individuals who did not complete all waves.

227

Standard errors were calculated using the robust Ruber-White method, and P-values were

228

computed using the Yuan-Bentler scaled test statistic.41 The false-discovery rate correction

229

for multiple testing was applied to the variables in each model that were not control

230

covariates, which included the associations between the latent variables of cognitive function

231

and its subdomains and BP, as well as associations from sex, age 11 cognitive function, and

232

their interaction. All analyses were conducted in the R programming language (version

233

3.3.2), using the ‘lavaan’ package for modelling.42

Results

240

Modelling blood pressure

241

The best fit model of BP was a good fit for these data (χ² = 2052.76, df = 259, P <

242

0.001, CFI = 0.931, RMSEA = 0.080). The correlations between the level, linear slope, and

243

quadratic slope latent BP variables were as follows: rlevel,slope = -0.466 (z = -10.216, P <

244

0.001), rlevel,quad = 0.323 (z = 5.525, P < 0.001), rslope,quad = -0.466 (z = -90.460, P < 0.001).

245

Blood pressure scores for each wave were derived from the latent variables and

246

illustrated in Figure 1. In both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, blood pressure

247

scores were similar at each age except for a notable but unsurprising difference in

248

magnitude: individuals with hypertension had much higher blood pressure than those who

249

did not have hypertension. Both groups show a quadratic effect, blood pressure rose

250

between ages 70 and 76, and then declined between age 76 and 79.

251
252

Blood pressure and cognitive function

253

The best fit model of both blood pressure and cognitive function included latent

254

variables for level and linear slope (χ² = 8911.01, df = 4023, P < 0.001, CFI = 0.928, RMSEA

255

= 0.033). Models including a quadratic factor of cognitive function change either would not

256

converge successfully or fit very poorly and could not be trusted to produce reliable

257

estimates for cognitive function, and thus were not included in our models. Blood pressure

258

was best modelled with a quadratic factor of change.

259

Overall, we found no associations between latent variables of cognitive function with

260

those of blood pressure in our bivariate growth curve (Model 1A, Figure 2 & supplementary

261

table 2). After correction for multiple comparisons, only three tested associations (out of 22)

262

survived. First, a correlation between eighth decade cognitive function level and slope (r =

263

0.326, SE = 0.059, P < 0.001), which suggests that individuals with higher overall cognitive

264

function have steeper cognitive decline over the eighth decade, likely because they have

265

more functional ability to lose. Second, there was a regression path from age 11 cognitive

266

function to eighth decade cognitive function level (β = 0.693, SE = 0.036, P < 0.001), which

267

reproduces a well-known phenomenon: cognitive function shows substantial stability of

268

individual differences across the life course,43 and different measures taken at different times

269

will still be strongly associated.

270

Third, a significant regression path was found from the interaction of age 11 cognitive

271

function and sex to eighth decade blood pressure level (β = -0.136, SE = 0.050, P = 0.047).

272

This interaction association indicates that women with higher cognitive function at age 11

273

have lower blood pressure in later life, and women with lower cognitive function have higher

274

blood pressure. The opposite was true for men, higher cognitive function men had higher

275

blood pressure and vice versa (Figure 3). No additional associations were found between

276

any specific cognitive domains and blood pressure variables. All these tested associations

277

are visualized in Figure 2.

278

Incorporating control variables into the LGCM (Model 1B, supplementary table 3)

279

reduced the regression weight from the sex and age 11 cognitive function interaction to

280

blood pressure level, so that it was no longer significant (β = -0.106, SE = 0.058, P = 0.215).

281

The variable that most likely caused this change in the model was smoking behaviour;

282

specifically, being a current smoker at age 70 had an association with eighth decade blood

283

pressure (β = -0.104, SE = 0.040, post-hoc uncorrected P = 0.009).

286

Diagnosis and treatment effects
In an effort to understand why we found no associations between cognitive function

287

and blood pressure in the eighth decade, we examined the role of medication in post-hoc

288

analyses. Most individuals diagnosed with hypertension in the LBC1936 were prescribed

289

medication for the condition. Following from Figure 1, though individuals with hypertension

290

would have had higher blood pressure were they not being treated, they are being treated,

291

and their blood pressure appears to generally decline over the eighth decade.

292

We fit linear mixed effect models to explore the associations of diagnosis and

293

medication with blood pressure. Using latent variables for blood pressure, we generated

294

blood pressure scores at each wave, but, by contrast with the previous analyses, the scores

295

were based on the raw, medication-unadjusted systolic and diastolic blood pressure

296

measurements. Using these scores, we first fit a mixed model predicting blood pressure

297

score from a 2-way model that included the wave of the study, whether an individual had a

298

hypertension diagnosis at that wave, and the interaction of the two (Model 2A, Table 2). We

299

found a significant main effect of wave on blood pressure score (β = -0.048, SE = 0.014, P <

300

0.001) and interaction between wave and hypertension diagnosis (β = -0.111, SE = 0.028, P

301

< 0.001), suggesting that individuals who are given a hypertension diagnosis have

302

decreasing blood pressure over time.

303

In a second mixed effects model we replaced hypertension diagnosis by wave with a

304

single variable indicating if a hypertension diagnosis was given at any wave, i.e. if a

305

participant was diagnosed with hypertension during the eighth decade. This

306

operationalization of diagnosis may capture more information than individual wave

307

diagnoses; for example, an individual who first reports a hypertension diagnosis at wave 3

308

might already have hypertension at wave 2, and even if they do not have hypertension at

309

wave 1, their blood pressure is likely to be elevated as they will be on their way to

310

developing clinical hypertension. By coding all this information in a single variable we reduce

311

the number of comparisons in the models as well as potentially improving our

312

operationalization. As a result (Model 2B, Table 2) we found similar associations as in model

313

2A, except that we also found a main effect of being diagnosed with hypertension at any

314

wave, which suggests that individuals with a diagnosis generally had higher blood pressure

315

as we would expect. However, the interaction suggests that over time, blood pressure

316

decreased among individuals with hypertension. This suggests that diagnosed participants

317

of this sample are taking their medication and this is having a significant, ameliorative effect

318

on their raised blood pressure.

319

We fit two additional linear mixed effects models to examine associations between

320

hypertension diagnosis and cognitive function. Because later life cognitive function is

321

strongly associated with early life cognitive function, we included age 11 cognitive function

322

as an independent variable in our regression models, and included all 2-way and 3-way

323

interactions with wave and whether an individual was diagnosed with hypertension.

324

These models (Models 3A & 3B, Table 2) reproduced several established effects 30

325

326

decade (β = 0.680, SE = 0.023, P < 0.001). Cognitive function declines across successive

327

waves (β = -0.154, SE = 0.007, P < 0.001). Individuals with higher cognitive function early in

328

life have more ability to lose, so declines are greater for these individuals across time (β = -

329

0.039, SE = 0.014, P = 0.006).

330

. Age 11 cognitive function is associated with cognitive function scores in the eighth

In the second model of this set of models (Model 3B, Table 2), there was also a main

331

effect of being diagnosed with hypertension at any wave and overall cognitive function level

332

(β = -0.105, SE = 0.029, P < 0.001). Having a hypertension diagnosis was associated with

333

lower cognitive function, which could not be fully explained by cognitive function scores from

334

earlier in life. This suggests that hypertension may be associated with negative cognitive

335

change between childhood and older age in this sample. Put another way, being diagnosed

336

with hypertension did not have any protective associations with cognitive function across the

337

eighth decade: it did not improve cognitive function or make up for the negative associations

338

between blood pressure and cognitive decline. In previous models (Table 2) being

339

diagnosed with hypertension was associated with reduced blood pressure over time.

340

Therefore, whereas hypertension diagnoses and anti-hypertensive medication appear to

341

successfully treat high blood pressure in this cohort, they do not appear to impact associated

342

cognitive deficiencies.

Discussion
Our results show that sex and cognitive function from early-life interact to predict

346

blood pressure level during the eighth decade. Women with higher cognitive function are

347

less likely than higher cognitively functioning men to have higher blood pressure, but the

348

opposite is also true: lower cognitive function women are more likely to have higher blood

349

pressure than similarly functioning men (Figure 3). This finding provides mixed support for

350

our first hypothesis and the existing supporting literature,18 21 as the effect was not robust to

351

the inclusion of covariates. Some of this association can be explained by health behaviors

352

and other health conditions, some of which stand out. Notably, whether one is a smoker or

353

not appeared to explain some of the same variation as the sex by cognitive function

354

interaction.

355

We did not find compelling evidence to support our second hypothesis. There were

356

no associations between high blood pressure and cognitive function, either in level or

357

trajectory of function, nor were any other health or sociodemographic variables associated

358

with change in either blood pressure or cognitive function in the eighth decade. As a null

359

result, this is a difficult finding to interpret. It may be that we did not have sufficient power to

360

detect such associations in our sample, although nearly 40% of the sample had been

361

diagnosed with hypertension by the initial wave at age 70. Another possibility is that

362

cognitive function is most impacted by side effects of hypertension before the eighth decade:

363

our findings tentatively support this, as individuals with a hypertension diagnosis tended to

364

have lower cognitive function, below what we would expect from baseline assessments at

365

age 11.

366

Another possibility is that anti-hypertensive medications were effective at reducing

367

hypertensive symptoms, which includes the connections between cognitive function and

368

hypertension. We were able to demonstrate that anti-hypertensive medication was effective

369

at lowering blood pressure, but we found no evidence that either medication or behavioral

370

changes that might result from being diagnosed with hypertension have a positive

371

association with subsequent cognitive function. In other words, treatment from

372

antihypertensive medication in the eighth decade did not impact age or hypertension-related

373

cognitive decline in this sample.

374

There is existing evidence for the importance of lifestyle factors in explaining the

375

associations between cognitive function and physical health. In the National Longitudinal

376

Study of Youth 1979, higher cognitive function women were less likely to be given a

377

hypertension diagnosis,21 an interaction that closely matches our initial finding in the

378

LBC1936. However, this effect was explained by income differences. The Aberdeen Children

379

of the 1950s cohort yielded results that were also similar to ours; specifically, associations

380

between childhood cognitive function and both stroke and coronary artery events were

381

present in both sexes, but stronger in women.11 However, in their analyses, the sex by

382

cognitive function interaction effects on stroke and CAD outcomes could be accounted for by

383

education. In both of these cases, there were socioeconomic factors that seemed to drive

384

the interaction between early life cognitive function and sex, whereas we found that

385

behaviors, specifically smoking, seemed to explain some of the interaction. These samples

386

vary in age and location, so chronological and geographic-cultural cohort differences might

387

explain the discrepancies.44 45

388

The present study is limited by a non-trivial proportion of missing data, particularly

389

from individuals who died over the course of the study, or were too frail or otherwise

390

unwilling to continue participating. Moreover, our analytic sample was more affluent than the

391

average population, and may thus limit generalizability. The diagnoses and medications

392

analyzed in the present study were self-reported and we were not able to cross-reference

393

these reports with any physician records. Although we took steps to treat these variables

394

conservatively in our analyses, self-reported diagnoses of hypertension tend to have lower

395

validity than those drawn from medical records.46

396

In general, our results are consistent with previous work that has indicated that the

397

effects of lower childhood cognitive function on hypertension are stronger and more

398

consistent in women.11 21 Despite there being known connections between high blood

399

pressure and cognitive impairment, we did not find any evidence for this in the eighth

400

decade. It appears that any cognitive lowering associated with hypertension may occur

401

earlier in life. Future research ought to corroborate this and, in general, investigate the

402

critical periods when hypertension might be detrimental to cognitive health.

Figure 1. Blood pressure trajectories in the eighth decade for individuals with and
without hypertension diagnoses. Only study completers, those participants who were
present at every wave of the study, were included in this plot. All study participants were
used in the statistical analyses. Blood pressure score was derived from the latent variable
that represent blood pressure in individual waves; the score is a standardized measure of
overall blood pressure magnitude. The upper green line illustrates individuals diagnosed with
hypertension at any wave (n = 337) and the lower red line illustrates normotensive
individuals (n = 204). The shaded areas represent 95% confidence regions.

Figure 2. Path diagram displaying the statistical tests in a latent growth curve model
of cognitive function and blood pressure. Circles represent latent variables and squares
represent measured variables. Double arrowed lines represent correlations. Single arrowed
lines (on the left side) represent regressions. Coefficients and SEs are the result of model
1A; numbers printed in bold indicate coefficients that were statistically significant after
correction for multiple comparisons.

Figure 3. Blood pressure in older age and its relationship with cognitive function at
age 11 years, sex, and their interaction. Blood pressure score was derived from the latent
variable that represent blood pressure in individual waves. The green dots and line represent
women, and the red dots and line represent men. The shaded areas represent 95%
confidence regions.
