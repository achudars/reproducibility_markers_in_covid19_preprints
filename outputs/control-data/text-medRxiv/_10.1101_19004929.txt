Abstract
Background: CBD products have risen in popularity given its therapeutic potential and lack of legal
oversight, despite lacking conclusive scientific evidence for wide spread over-the-counter usage for many
of its perceived benefits. While medical evidence is being generated, social media surveillance offers a
fast and inexpensive alternative to traditional surveys in ascertaining perceived therapeutic purposes and
modes of consumption for CBD products.
Methods: We collected all comments from the CBD subreddit posted between January 1 and April 30,
2019 as well as comments submitted to the FDA regarding regulation of cannabis-derived products and
analyzed them using a rule-based language processing method. A relative ranking of popular therapeutic
uses and product groups for CBD is obtained based on frequency of pattern matches including precise
queries that entail identifying mentions of the condition, a CBD product, and some trigger phrase
indicating therapeutic use.
Results: CBD is mostly discussed as a remedy for anxiety disorders and pain and this is consistent
across both comment sources. Of comments posted to the CBD subreddit during the monitored time
span, 6.19% mentioned anxiety at least once with at least 6.02% of these comments specifically
mentioning CBD as a treatment for anxiety. The most popular CBD product group is oil and tinctures.
Conclusion: Social media surveillance of CBD usage has the potential to surface new therapeutic usecases as they are posted. As FDA ponders regulation, our effort demonstrates that social data offers a
convenient affordance to surveil for CBD usage patterns in a way that is fast and inexpensive.

Introduction
Cannabidiol (CBD) is a well-known cannabinoid compound derived from certain strains of Cannabis
Sativa. It has been shown to have high potential for therapeutic efficacy and low potential for abuse and
dependency in humans (World Health Organization, 2017); however, evidence is not substantial enough
to warrant wide spread over-the-counter availability of CBD products for perceived therapeutic effects
(Cogan, 2019; Cohen and Sharfstein, 2019). As of now, FDA has approved a CBD based drug only for
epilepsy in June 2018 (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2018). Nevertheless, public interest in CBD
has skyrocketed in recent years. The 2018 United States Farm Bill, which became law on December 20,
2018, included a provision that removed hemp from Schedule 1 controlled substances. As a result, CBD
based products, derived primarily from hemp plant extracts, are now ubiquitous in the U.S. marketplace
for over-the-counter purchase (backed by major retailers including Walgreens, Kroger, and CVS) and
remain relatively unregulated (Reiley, 2019). Figure 1 presents the billboard sign of a local CBD shop
that recently opened in Lexington, Kentucky, clearly indicating a health benefit perspective. Even if there
is no long-term harm, aggressive marketing of CBD products (oils, edibles, topicals, and vapes) by the
cannabis industry could lead to significant cost burden to consumers as they may regularly buy products
for claimed/perceived health benefits without conclusive clinical evidence.

As more medical evidence is being generated and consolidated, it is critical to keep track of therapeutic
purposes that consumers indicate on social media to inform policy and prevention initiatives. In this first of
its kind study for CBD, we analyze perceived or expected therapeutic uses for CBD based on social
media discussions. Our precise rule-based method is used to ascertain the relative ranking of different
therapeutic reasons for the use of CBD according to public perception. We apply a similar method to
identify popular ways in which CBD is consumed. Given suitable anonymity properties, we chose the CBD
subreddit on the Reddit social platform for this effort. We additionally validate our method on a collection
of public comments submitted as part of a recent FDA request for comments (RFC Docket ID: FDA-2019N-1482) regarding regulation of cannabis-derived products. While traditional surveys and literature
reviews are powerful tools for assessing potential uses for CBD, we argue that automated surveillance of
social media platforms offer a fast and inexpensive alternative that could inform and complement more
traditional sources of surveillance. Specifically, it is possible to continually perform this kind of analysis in
a live or streaming fashion. Furthermore, this type of automatic analysis on CBD usage and effects may
facilitate the construction and deployment of traditional surveys by helping to populate survey choices.

Material and Methods
We perform our analysis on a collection of all comments posted to the CBD subreddit between January 1,
2019 and April 30, 2019 totaling to 64,099 individual comments. We validate our method on a secondary
collection of 3832 machine-processable comments1 submitted to FDA’s RFC on cannabis derived
products between April 3, 2019 and July 19, 2019. These platforms were chosen for our analyses
because of the tendency for comments to be verbose and focused with respect to the topic of cannabisderived products.
First, we use the MetaMap concept identification and normalization tool (U.S. National Library of
Medicine, 2019) to identify frequently mentioned psychological and physiological conditions at the

There were 4272 comments in total (https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=FDA-2019-N-1482) by the time the
comment period closed on July 16, 2019, and of them 3832 were machine processable comments as ASCII text
(mostly from consumers) while the rest included PDF attachments (some paper scans) that were not readily
processible, mostly including formal opinions from organizations that are in the stakeholder group for CBD
products. We exclusively focused on typed-in comments that were from consumers.

concept level. Based on the concepts found, we manually curate an exhaustive list of target conditions
(TCs); each TC is associated with a dictionary of terms (i.e., ways in which a condition is expressed)
through manual review of disease and disorder concepts frequently identified by MetaMap. For example,
for seizure disorders, we look for mentions of terms such as “epilepsy”, “epileptic”, and “seizure/s”. As the
CBD subreddit may contain “off-topic” discussion of ailments not directly related to CBD, we also
experimented with increasingly precise queries, based on regular expression patterns to match
comments that specifically mention the TC as well as CBD and some therapeutic trigger phrase. The
three type of queries corresponding to different levels of restrictiveness are as follows. For each
comment, we
1. search for mentions of the TC,
2. search for mentions of the TC and CBD within the same sentence,
3. search for mentions of the TC, CBD, and some therapeutic trigger phrase indicating treatment
where each mention is separated by at most 36 characters (half the observed average sentence
length). For example, when analyzing mentions of epilepsy, one regular expression pattern used
is “\b(cbd)\b[^\\/\.,;\-\(\)]{1,36}\b(treats)\b[^\\/\.,;\-\(\)]{1,36}\b(epilepsy)\b” which matches
occurrences of “cbd”, trigger phrase “treats”, and “epilepsy” in the given order separated by at
most 36 non-punctuation characters. We match on several variations of the aforementioned
pattern to allow matching on all possible orders, allow for synonyms of CBD including cannabidiol
and hemp oil, and allow for queries based on different trigger phrases.
Here, therapeutic trigger phrases come from a hand-crafted dictionary of 87 terms including “treats”,
“cures”, “helps”, “reduces”, “alleviates”, “relieves”, “eliminates”, “kills”, “stops”, “eases”, “aids”, “soothes”,
“inhibits”, “improves”, “destroys”, “reverses”, “suppresses”, “lowers”, “regulates”, “prevents”, “manages”,
“fixes”, “better” and their variants including conjugated forms. The queries are performed in a case
insensitive fashion and matches containing negation terms (including “never”, “not”, and related
contractions) are disregarded. We emphasize that frequency or count is defined as the number of unique
comments containing the term or matching a pattern-based query; that is, a term or pattern match is only
counted at most once per comment even if it occurs multiple times in some comments. By manually

examining 100 randomly sampled matches at the strictest (third) query type, we estimate our method to
be 96% accurate (more precisely, 96% positive predictive value rate) with a 95% confidence interval of
[90.16%, 98.43%]. However precise, we note that the frequency of pattern matches is an underestimate
of the true frequency.
To explore the modes of consumption for CBD products, we curated a list of popular CBD products based
on a manual review of popular CBD e-commerce websites. We group them into five broad product groups
including Oils/Tinctures, Vapes, Edibles, Pills/Capsules, and Topicals. Less obvious terms were obtained
by querying similar word vectors as induced by the distributional semantics software Word2Vec (Google
Code Archive, 2013) on the comment data; for example, by querying for words similar to “vape”, “vaping”,
we obtained additional terms such as “dab” and “wax” which are associated with a less well-known mode
of inhalation. As vaping, for example, may not necessarily be associated with CBD, we additionally
perform more precise queries to match for mentions of these products that explicit contain as a prefix
“CBD”, “cannabidiol”, or “hemp” such as “CBD tea” or “hemp lotion.”
Results and Discussion
We report our analysis of top ten mentioned conditions in Table 1, sorted by matching at the strictest level
on Reddit posts, where the second column is a list of terms for the TC along with their individual
frequencies (in parentheses). The next six columns are frequencies for matches of queries at varying
levels of restrictiveness, based on pattern rules, with an example at the last column. Based on these
results, anxiety disorders and pain are the two conditions dominating much of the discussion surrounding
CBD, both in terms of general discussion and as a perceived therapeutic treatment. This is consistent for
both comments posted to the CBD subreddit and comments submitted to the FDA’s 2019 RFC on
cannabis-derived products.
Given the match counts/frequencies are comment-unique (and underestimates the true frequency), it is
possible to assess, for example that 6.19% (3968 out of 64099) of comments posted to the CBD
subreddit mention anxiety, and that at least 6.02% (239 out of 3968) of these comments explicitly discuss
CBD as a potential or perceived remedy for anxiety; for pain, these percentages are 3.22% and 5.56%
respectively. On the other hand, 27.00% of comments to the FDA RFC mention some form of anxiety

disorder, and at least 15.39% of these comments explicitly mention CBD as a potential therapeutic
solution; for pain, these percentages are much more prominent at 47.57% and 16.18% respectively.
Overall, it can be observed that Reddit comments tend to focus more on mental conditions (anxiety and
stress) while FDA comments tend to focus more on physiological conditions (pain and headache).
Despite having an order of magnitude more Reddit comments than comments to the FDA, we note that
there is not a dramatic difference in the number of query hits between the two platforms. This may
indicate that comments to the FDA, as expected, are highly focused on CBD products and their perceived
therapeutic effects while Reddit comments are more likely to include off-topic discussions.
We use superscript (A) to indicate conditions covered in a recent review of human studies assessing the
potential of CBD (White, 2019) and superscript (B) to indicate conditions covered in a recent survey study
of CBD users (Corroon and Phillips, 2018). Among conditions frequently discussed on social media that
are not discussed in research literature are stress and nausea. Less frequently discussed conditions (not
shown in Table 1) for which there is little or no research evidence (as observed from PubMed searches)
include ADHD and autism, with users making comments such as, “I will say from my personal experience
that hemp flower and oil have really helped my ADHD.”
We similarly report popular modes of consumption in Table 2. We found that CBD oil and tinctures are
most popular, either as food additives or directly administered sublingually, with vaping being the second
most popular mode of consumption. Approximately 13% of the Reddit comments mention oil or tinctures,
and 25% of these are explicitly mentioned as a CBD product.
Conclusion and Limitations
CBD’s fast-growing popularity fueled by the current relatively unregulated landscape warrants a serious
and continuous exploration of perceived therapeutic claims by consumers. We took a first step in that
direction in this effort by mining CBD related social media chatter. Specifically, we analyzed social media
posts to the Reddit platform and comments to the 2019 FDA RFC regarding cannabis product regulation
to attain a relative ranking of perceived therapeutic uses for CBD. We analyzed these comments at
varying levels of granularity with respect to a target condition, including assessing whether the comment
simply mentioned the target condition or if there was an explicit mention of therapeutic effect related to

CBD usage. Additionally, using a similar method, we obtain a relative ranking of popular CBD products as
measured by discussion frequency. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to mine CBD related online
content. Given the precise nature of our methodology (and rule-based methods in general), our results
are in fact underestimates of the true population. However, we posit that our method is sufficient as the
goal is to obtain a relative ranking among popularly discussed conditions and not necessarily to obtain
absolute estimates of CBD users using it for a particular therapeutic reason. The latter estimate can only
be obtained by a conventional survey targeting a truly random sample of consumers and not just those
who post on Reddit. However, our effort has the potential to surface new therapeutic use-cases (as they
are posted), which can then be included as options in more traditional surveys that can be timed at
regular intervals as per resource constraints. As FDA ponders regulation, we believe our effort
demonstrates that social data offers a convenient affordance to surveil for CBD usage patterns in a way
that is fast and inexpensive and can be deployed in a live fashion, offering unique complementary
advantages to more traditional surveys.
