Abstract:
Purpose: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive primary brain tumor with a median overall survival of 15
months with standard-of-care treatment. GBM can have a cystic component, identifiable through magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). Previous studies suggest that cysts occur in 7-23% of GBMs and report mixed results
regarding its prognostic impact. Using our large retrospective cohort of 493 patients with first-diagnosis GBM,
we aim to elucidate this link between cystic GBM and survival.
Methods: Using pretreatment MRIs, we manually identified 88 patients with GBM that had a significant cystic
component at presentation.
Results: Compared to patients with noncystic GBM (N=405), patients with cystic GBM had significantly longer
overall survival and were significantly younger at presentation. However, among patients who received the
current standard-of-care treatment, cystic GBM (N=40) was not significant for outcome. We also did not observe
a significant survival benefit when comparing this standard-of-care cystic cohort to patients with cystic GBM
diagnosed before the standard was established (N=19), but the analogous result for patients with noncystic GBM
gives a sizeable benefit, as expected (N=144, N=111, respectively). We also report differences in the absolute
and relative sizes of imaging abnormalities on MRI and the prognostic implication of cysts based on sex.
Conclusion: Together, these results may explain later studies that note no significant survival benefit for patients
with cystic GBM receiving current standard-of-care. We discuss hypotheses for these observed differences,
including the possibility that the presence of a cyst could indicate a less aggressive tumor.

Introduction
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor with a median survival of only
15 months with current standard-of-care treatment [1]. The hallmark of GBM on T1-weighted MRI with
gadolinium contrast (T1Gd MRI) is a heterogeneously enhancing mass, often with a dominant central nonenhancing component, comprised of central necrosis. The margins of the central necrosis are characteristically
irregular and ill-defined (Figure 1A). T2-weighted (T2) MRI is used to identify edema, that typically surrounds
the T1Gd MRI enhancing region.
By comparison, a percentage of GBM tumors present with a central cystic component, rather than central
necrosis. As opposed to irregular margins of central necrosis, cysts are often defined by smooth, thin, sharply
defined margins of enhancement surrounding the non-enhancing cyst. Cystic fluid is typically isointense with
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on T2 and FLAIR MRI and has a notably smooth texture. While these cysts are more
common in lower grade gliomas (e.g., juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma, ganglioglioma) and non-glioma tumors
with good prognosis (e.g., hemangioblastoma), between 7-23% of GBM tumors can also present with a
dominant central cyst (rather than central necrosis) (Figure 1B) [2,3]. We will refer to these as cystic GBMs
and those without a significant cystic component as noncystic GBMs.
Current clinical practice does not consider the presence of a cyst when formulating treatment plans or
prognosticating patients’ survival. There have been a number of studies that have assessed prognostic
implications of cystic GBMs with inconsistent results. One retrospective review matched 22 patients with cystic
GBM with 22 patients with noncystic GBM treated between 1993 and 2002. The authors found an insignificant
trend for overall survival, and found that patients with cystic GBM had a significantly longer time to recurrence
[2]. Another study of 5 cystic GBMs and 32 noncystic GBMs treated between 1990 and 2004 also found that
patients with cystic GBM had a longer time to recurrence and a median survival time of 19.8 months compared
to only 12.8 months for noncystic GBM [4]. A smaller study of 7 cystic and 14 noncystic GBMs treated between
2000 and 2009 found that patients with cystic GBM lived significantly longer after surgery [5]. Another recent
study of patients with GBM treated between 2004 and 2014 found a survival benefit for those with cystic GBM
(41 cystic, 139 noncystic) [6]. However, two of the largest studies to date found no survival benefit associated
with presenting with a cyst. One of these studies reviewed 354 GBM patients (37 cystic, 317 noncystic) treated
consecutively between 2005 and 2009 at a single institution [7] and the other retrospectively reviewed 351
consecutive GBM patients (27 cystic, 324 noncystic) treated between 1997 and 2011 [8].
Given the higher prevalence of cysts in lower grade tumors, there have been a number of studies looking for
a mechanism behind the improved prognosis of patients with cystic GBM, including notable molecular
compounds present in cystic GBM fluid and histopathological differences between cystic and noncystic GBM.
One such study analyzed cystic GBM fluid and showed that it has similarities to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and
higher levels of substances known to enhance tumor growth, suggesting that cystic GBM fluid could act as a
nutrient reservoir for the tumor [9]. Another study found that brain tumor cystic fluid had an immunosuppressive
effect on cultured lymphocytes [10]. Other studies saw histological differences between cystic and noncystic
GBMs; cystic GBM had more well-defined tumor cell borders, suggesting that cystic GBM tumor cells are less
migratory [2,4]. Multiple studies have found that cystic GBM patients tend to be younger than noncystic patients
[4,5,7].

The lack of consensus about the prognostic value and biological indications of cystic components at GBM
presentation leaves uncertainty in the clinical interpretation of this phenomenon. Elucidating whether cysts
provide a prognostic benefit and better understanding the biological mechanism behind this phenomenon will
allow for more informed decision-making in these situations. In this investigation, we sought to determine
whether cysts provide a prognostic benefit and identify other image-based and clinical characteristics
associated with cystic GBM. Additionally, we looked for patient and tumor characteristics that could help explain
the biological mechanism of the development of cysts in GBM.

Methods
Patient Cohort
All patients from our in-house multi-institutional glioma repository that met the following criteria were included
in this cohort: A) first-diagnosis GBM, B) available age, sex, and overall survival (confirmed death, alive, or lost
to follow-up), and C) available pre-surgical T1Gd MR image. This resulted in a cohort of 493 newly-diagnosed
GBM patients (190 females and 303 males). For the patients with this information available in our repository,
extent of resection (N=350) and progression free survival were also collected (N=166). Extent of resection was
abstracted from surgical notes and radiological reports and is not uniformly determined radiographically. Since
many of the patients in our cohort were diagnosed before the current standard of care (SOC) for newlydiagnosed GBM was established in 2005 [1], the whole cohort did not receive the same SOC treatment. In
order to assess the impact of cysts on patients receiving the current SOC, as established in 2005, we created
a subset of patients who were known to receive maximal safe resection, concurrent XRT and TMZ, and at least
one cycle of TMZ after diagnosis and called these patients “current SOC patients” (N=184). We isolated
patients who were not known to receive current SOC and were known to have been diagnosed before the SOC
was established in 2005 and called these patients “not current SOC patients” (N=130).
Biomedical Imaging
The tumor-associated imaging abnormality on our patients’ pre-surgical MR images were segmented by
trained individuals. From these segmentations, we calculate the volume of the imaging abnormality (mm3).
Every patient in this cohort has a “T1Gd volume”, quantifying the size of the imaging abnormality on the presurgical T1Gd image that was closest to the date of surgery. “T1Gd volume” includes both the central
hypointense region of necrosis or cystic fluid and the surrounding contrast-enhancing region. The central
hypointense area of necrosis or cystic fluid is also segmented separately and used to calculated a
“necrosis/cystic volume”. For patients that had multiple pre-treatment T1Gd images (in a 10+ day interval), we
took the T1Gd volume of both images, converted them to radii using a spherically-equivalent volume, and
calculated a “T1Gd radial growth velocity” (mm/day) (N=68). Most patients also had an available pre-surgical
T2-FLAIR MRI (or T2 MR image if T2-FLAIR was not available) (N=326), which we used to calculated a
“T2/FLAIR volume”.
Identification of Cysts
All cystic GBM and noncystic GBM patients were identified using pre-surgical MR images by two trained
individuals and a randomly chosen subset was vetted by a neuroradiologist. Cysts were defined by smooth,
thin, sharply defined margins of enhancement surrounding the periphery of the non-enhancing cyst. Where
available, the T2/FLAIR MRI region corresponding to the hypointensity on T1Gd was clearly defined, consistent
with CSF, and smooth in texture. In order to be deemed a “cystic GBM” patient, the cyst needed to be
comparable in size or larger than the rest of the tumor-related non-enhancing abnormality. Patients that did
not fit this definition were deemed as “noncystic GBM”. Examples of T1Gd and T2 MRIs for both a cystic and
noncystic GBM are shown in Figure 1.
Statistical analyses
Kaplan-Meier curves were used to visualize differences in survival between two groups and log-rank tests were
used to assess the significance of these differences. Cox proportional hazards models (CPH), both univariate
and multivariate, were also used to assess the impact of patient variables on overall survival. Two-sided
independent t-tests with Welch’s corrections were used to test whether the means of a particular variable were

statistically different between two groups. All statistical tests and figures were generated using R [11] and the
packages survminer [12], ggplot2 [13], and survival [14]. In order to assess the role of sex differences in this
investigation, all tests were also performed separately on male and female patients. Any of the results from
this sex differences analysis that are not reported in the main text are listed in the supplement. Additionally,
the age-adjusted rate of the formation of cysts in newly-diagnosed GBM was calculated using the CBTRUS
2011-2015 GBM population [15] as the “standard population”. For each age group, age-adjusted rate of cyst
is calculated as (cysts in our cohort in that age group)/(number of GBM patients in CBTRUS data in that age
group). The resulting “rate” is not intended for prediction of cyst prevalence, but to allow for the comparison of
cyst frequency across age groups in a way that normalizes for the frequency of GBM in that age group
(Supplement 2).
Study approval
All patients included in this investigation were consented prospectively or approved for retrospective research
by institutional review boards.

Results
Patients with cystic GBM have significantly longer overall survival among patients receiving all
treatments, but not among current SOC patients.
In our patient cohort, cystic GBM patients (N=88) have a significantly longer overall survival (OS) than noncystic
patients (N=405) (log-rank, p=0.0012), but there is no significant survival difference among patients that
received the current standard of care (p=0.29, N=184) (Figure 2). When controlling for age as a prognostic
factor among all patients (N=493), the existence of cyst remained significant in predicting survival in a
multivariate CPH analysis (HR = 0.753, p=0.032). Among all patients with known extent of resection (N=350),
we performed a multivariate CPH controlling for cyst status, age, extent of resection and treatment with current
SOC. In this setting, we found that the presence of cyst approached significance (Cystic: yes = 1) (HR=0.751,
p=0.052), independent of other variables like age at diagnosis (HR=1.03, p<0.0001), extent of resection (biopsy
= 1, STR = 2, GTR = 3) (HR=0.681, p<0.0001), and treatment protocol (Current SOC: yes = 1) (HR=0.553,
p<0.0001). Comparing 5-year survival rates between cystic and noncystic GBM yields significant differences
(chi-squared p=0.011). We see a 20% 5-year survival rate for cystic GBM patients (N=18 of 88) and an 11%
equivalent in the noncystic GBM cohort (N=43 of 405). We do not see the same significance within the SOC
patients (chi-squared p=0.67). The 5-year survival rate for cystic GBM receiving SOC is 23% (N=9 of 40), while
the corresponding noncystic GBM rate is 19% (N=28 of 144).

Patients with cystic GBM are younger, tend to have slower tumor growth velocity, and have relatively
less T2/FLAIR abnormality.
We present a summary of our comparisons between cystic GBM and noncystic GBM patients in Table 1. Cystic
GBM patients are significantly younger than noncystic GBM patients at the time of diagnosis (t-test, p=0.0016)
(Figure 3A). We calculated an age-adjusted rate of cystic presentation in GBM using the CBTRUS 2011-2015
population as our “standard population” of GBMs, which allows us to normalize the frequency of cystic
presentation in a particular age group to the frequency of GBM diagnosis in that age group (more details on
this method in Supplement 2). This calculation showed that cysts are much more common among younger
patients, particularly among patients 20-34 years old, and were least common among patients 75-84 years old
(Figure 4). Using tumor volume data from multi-modal MR images, we found that cysts have larger volumes of
T1Gd abnormality (p<0.0001) (Figure 3B) and insignificantly tend to have larger volumes of T2/FLAIR
abnormality (p=0.053) (Supplement 3). This was expected since cysts tend to be larger than necrosis at
presentation, supported by the larger necrosis/cyst volume in cystic patients (p<0.0001) (Supplement 3), and
the cystic volume is a component of the T1Gd and T2/FLAIR abnormalities. When comparing the relative sizes
of the T1Gd and T2/FLAIR volumes (T1Gd/T2FLAIR), we found that cystic GBM have a smaller relative
T2/FLAIR component compared to noncystic GBM (p=0.0003) (Figure 3D). Cystic GBM patients also have a
significantly slower (p=0.039) pre-surgical T1Gd growth velocity compared to noncystic GBM patients (Figure
3C).

Fig. 3 Compared to noncystic GBM patients, (A) cystic patients were younger, (B) had larger tumor volume on
T1Gd MRI, (C) had slower pre-surgical growth velocity on T1Gd MRI, and (D) had less volume on T2/FLAIR
MRI relative to volume on T1Gd

Fig. 4 Cysts are more common amongst younger GBM patients.
Age-adjusted rate of presentation with cyst among GBM patients
using CBTRUS 2011-2015 GBM population as the “standard
population.” Age-adjusted rates are given as cystic cases per 10
GBM cases. The resulting “rate” is not intended for prediction of
cyst prevalence, but to allow for the comparison of cyst
frequency across age groups in a way that normalizes for the
frequency of GBM in that age group. Comparing the rates across
age groups shows that cystic GBM is most common among 2134 year olds and least common among 75-84 year olds

Patients with cystic GBM do not significantly benefit from current SOC, while those with noncystic
GBM show the expected survival benefit.
When comparing cystic current SOC patients to cystic not current SOC patients, we surprisingly do not see
significant OS differences (log-rank, p=0.28 Figure 5A). As expected we see a very significant OS benefit in
the analogous result for noncystic GBM patients (p<0.0001, Figure 5B). Among current SOC patients, cystic
patients did not have improved OS compared to noncystic patients (p=0.29) (Figure 2), but among not current
SOC patients, cystic patients did have significantly longer OS compared to noncystic patients (p=0.049)
(Supplement 4).

Fig. 5 (A) Cystic current SOC patients (median OS: 750 days) do not have improved survival compared to
cystic not current SOC patients (median OS: 691 days). (B) Noncystic current SOC patients (median OS: 678
days) do show an expected survival benefit compared to noncystic not current SOC patients (median OS: 370
days)

Female patients with cystic GBM have less of a prognostic benefit compared to males
When males and females were combined, cystic patients had a survival benefit compared to noncystic patients
among patients receiving all treatments, but this difference was not significant among current SOC patients. In
order to identify potential sex differences, all of the tests in this investigation were also run on male and female
cohorts separately (Supplement 1). Among males, the survival difference between cystic and noncystic
patients is significant among patients with all treatments (log-rank, p=0.0006), and is insignificant but visually
trending towards significance among current SOC patients (p=0.095). Among females, there was no significant
survival difference between cystic and noncystic patients among patients receiving all treatments (p=0.29), but
cystic patients do have improved median OS (cystic median OS: 589 days, noncystic: 454 days). Among

female current SOC patients, there is no survival difference (p=0.63) and unexpectedly the noncystic patients
had longer median OS than the cystic ones (cystic median OS: 681 days, noncystic: 858 days) (Figure 6).
Additionally, when males and females were combined, cystic patients had relatively less T2/FLAIR volume
compared to noncystic (higher T1Gd/T2FLAIR ratio, cystic mean: 0.504, noncystic mean: 0.386, p=0.0003).
When the patients are separated by sex, this difference in relative volume was much more notable among
females (T1Gd/FLAIR ratio, cystic mean: 0.555, noncystic mean: 0.397, p=0.006) than it was among males
(T1Gd/FLAIR ratio, cystic mean: 0.461, noncystic mean: 0.380, p=0.027) (Supplement 1). The female cystic
ratio was not significantly different than the male cystic ratio, but tended to be (p=0.091).

Fig. 6 Overall survival comparisons between cystic and noncystic patients, both among all patients (top row)
and current SOC patients (bottom row), separated into males (right column) and females (left column). Cystic
males had improved survival compared to noncystic males among the entire cohort and they tended to have
better outcomes among the current SOC patients. Among females, cystic GBM did not have longer overall
survival compared to noncystic GBM
Among the patients with available histological information, we did not observe a difference in the prevalence
of IDH1 mutation or MGMT methylation between cystic and noncystic patients. In our cohort, 115 patients had
IDH1 mutation status available, including 103 IDH1 wild-type patients (32 cystic and 71 noncystic) and 12 IDH1
mutant patients (6 cystic and 6 noncystic) (Fisher’s exact test, p=0.21). 89 patients had available MGMT
methylation status, including 29 unmethylated patients (7 cystic and 22 noncystic) and 60 unmethylated
patients (10 cystic and 50 noncystic) (Fisher’s exact test, p=0.40). Additionally, 52 of the cystic patients from
our cohort had detailed notes from the diagnosing pathologist available for review. While all cystic patients in
our cohort were diagnosed with grade IV glioblastoma by a pathologist, we reviewed these notes for evidence
of unique pathological features in these tumors. We found that four cystic patients had features of giant cell
GBM, three were diagnosed as gliosarcoma, and three showed evidence of developing from lower grade
glioma. Two patients were observed to have oligodendroglial components and one patient had several
characteristics that were suggestive of astroblastoma.

In a cohort of 493 patients, we identified 88 with cystic and 405 with noncystic GBM. We have seen an OS
benefit for cystic GBM patients compared to noncystic GBM patients, which could be attributed to a variety of
biological mechanisms. Another study has analyzed the fluid in cystic GBM for various nutrients [9]. The
authors noted a variety of nutrients were present in cystic GBM fluid at similar or higher levels than in CSF.
Particularly, glutamate, lactate and inorganic phosphate, which was significantly higher than in CSF, were all
found in cystic GBM fluid and have been shown previously to act in a similar manner to growth factors for tumor
cells [16–21]. These results suggest that cystic fluid could act as a nutrient resource for GBM. If this is the
case, then a nutrient-rich center of a GBM that is otherwise palisading necrosis could give a very different
microenvironment to the tumor cells. Other papers have shown histological differences between cystic and
noncystic GBM tumor cells; cystic tumor cells were less invasive into the brain parenchyma. This lack of
invasion could lead to a better prognosis, tumor cells are less likely to migrate into other regions of the brain
and lead to a less aggressive tumor overall.
We found that patients with cystic GBM had relatively less T2/FLAIR abnormality (higher ratio of
T1Gd/T2FLAIR volumes), which supports the research suggesting that cystic GBMs are less invasive.
Additionally, this difference was more pronounced among females, which could suggest that the mechanism
impacting invasion in cystic GBM is impacted by sex. Interestingly, presentation with a cyst did not seem to
have the same prognostic value among female patients as it did among male (Figure 6). We also observed
that cystic GBM had a more equal distribution of males and females (1.15:1 M:F ratio), while the distribution in
noncystic GBM had considerably more males (1.72:1 M:F). Previous studies on sex differences in GBM have
found differences in the impact of tumor invasion on outcome [22], but our literature search did not find any
studies that looked at sex differences in cystic GBM.
We have shown using T1Gd growth velocity that cystic GBM tumors grow significantly slower than noncystic
GBM tumors in our patient cohort. The observed slower growth for cystic GBMs is indicative of a less
aggressive tumor. Other studies have suggested that a GBM presenting with a cystic component could be an
indication that the GBM is secondary, in that it developed from a low-grade glioma. One paper has analyzed
27 cystic GBMs for IDH1 mutation and did not find a significant proportion with IDH1 mutation (2/27) [8],
whereas another paper found a higher prevalence of cystic GBM within IDH1 and IDH2 mutants [3]. We did
not find a significant IDH1 mutation prevalence in our cystic GBM cohort. From review of the available
pathology reports for cystic GBM, we found evidence that a few exhibited features of giant cell GBM,
gliosarcoma, GBM with oligodendroglial components, and GBM that were suspected to evolve from lower
grade gliomas; these features might be indicative of slower growing and/or less aggressive tumors and may
be a contributing factor in our observed OS benefit for cystic GBM patients. Another possible explanation for
our observed OS benefit is that cysts lead to earlier symptom presentation in the course of the disease; this
could be a result of pressure in the brain caused by the cyst, which would otherwise be solely caused by a
tumor mass.
Collectively, previous studies have shown mixed results on the OS benefit of cystic GBM against noncystic
GBM patients. The majority of studies observing an OS benefit for cystic GBM contain patients diagnosed
before the current SOC [2,4,5,23] more recent publications tend not to observe an OS benefit [3,7,8]. As
described above, we have shown a significant increase in OS for cystic GBM patients when compared to
noncystic GBM patients. However, the same analyses on only current SOC patients does not show the same
significant result for OS. On a similar thread, the 5-year survival rate is significantly higher for patients with

cystic GBM within the whole cohort but not amongst current SOC patients. These results could be interpreted
to suggest that the current SOC protocol affects noncystic GBM patients differently than cystic GBM patients.
Indeed, we note a significant increase in OS among noncystic GBM patients, however, we find a non-significant
increase in OS for cystic GBM patients when comparing current SOC patients to not current SOC patients
(Figure 5). This result naturally brings into question whether the potential underlying biological differences
between cystic and noncystic GBM lead to a difference in responsiveness to current SOC therapies.
The precise biological mechanism of cyst formation in GBM is unclear. However, there is a consensus in the
literature that edema acts as a precursor to cysts in both glioma and other tumors of the central nervous system
[24,25]. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known to be upregulated in GBM and plays a role in the
breakdown of the blood brain barrier [26,27]. VEGF has been shown to be expressed at high rates in GBM
cyst fluid, which could be a contributing factor in GBM cyst formation [28,29]. VEGF has also been linked to
the presence of edema and cysts in other CNS tumors [30]. A two-hit mechanism has been proposed for cyst
formation in glioma: edema occurs as fluid extravasates from the leaky blood brain barrier at a faster rate than
it is reabsorbed, and microcysts form due to microvascular phenomena which lead to a macroscale cyst over
time [24].
Another noteworthy observation of this paper is the significantly younger age at presentation of those with
cystic GBMs. This is not due to the earlier presentation of cystic GBM, as we have shown through an age
adjusted rate in Figure 4. While the median age at diagnosis of GBM patients is about 65 years old and the
age-adjusted incidence rate of GBM is highest among people 75-84 years old [15], we used age-adjusted rates
to observe that cystic presentation was most frequent among GBM patients ages 20-34. Other papers have
also found that cystic GBM patients tend to be younger than their noncystic counterparts [4,5,7]. We also note
that cystic GBM remained as a significant prognostic indicator when accounting for age in a multivariate Cox
proportional hazard model.
Limitations and future work
Although the patient cohort presented in this work is large, the findings of this study are caveated by some
inherent limitations. This study is retrospective with incomplete records. Retrospective cohorts can generally
bring the potential for retrospective biases, such as patient selection bias. Additionally, while we collect as
much information as possible on our patients, we do not have complete molecular testing or clinical records
for all patients. This patient cohort was diagnosed between 1993 and 2016, which covers a time period of a
variety of treatment schedules as well as the introduction of a new treatment paradigm; this is inherent to any
study of this nature but can introduce unexpected variability into our results. A prospective study would be
better suited to provide conclusive evidence on the survival benefit of cystic GBM patients. Such a study could
take image-localized biopsies from cystic and noncystic GBM patients and determine corresponding
histopathological, RNA sequencing, and genome sequencing analyses on the collected tissue samples. These
would provide further evidence of potential biological differences in cystic and noncystic GBM tumors.
Conclusion
While there has been previous evidence that cysts are a relevant prognostic indicator, since the introduction
of the current SOC, others have not found this to be the case. We find that cystic GBM is significantly beneficial
to survival but do not see the same trend in patients receiving current SOC. Cysts seem to be indicative of less
aggressive tumors that may preferentially benefit male patients.
