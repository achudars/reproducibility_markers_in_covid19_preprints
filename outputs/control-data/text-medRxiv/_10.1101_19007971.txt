Abstract (word limit: 300)

27

Recent years have seen rising incidence of dengue and large outbreaks of Zika and chikungunya, which

28

are all caused by viruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. In most settings, the primary

29

intervention against Aedes-transmitted viruses is vector control, such as indoor, ultra-low volume

30

(ULV) spraying. Targeted indoor residual spraying (TIRS) has the potential to more effectively impact

31

Aedes-borne diseases, but its implementation requires careful planning and evaluation. The optimal

32

time to deploy these interventions and their relative epidemiological effects are not well understood,

33

however. We used an agent-based model of dengue virus transmission calibrated to data from Iquitos,

34

Peru to assess the epidemiological effects of these interventions under differing strategies for deploying

35

them. Specifically, we compared strategies where spray application was initiated when incidence rose

36

above a threshold based on incidence in recent years to strategies where spraying occurred at the same

37

time(s) each year. In the absence of spraying, the model predicted 361,000 infections [inter-quartile

38

range (IQR): 347,000 – 383,000] in the period 2000-2010. The ULV strategy with the fewest median

39

infections was spraying twice yearly, in March and October, which led to a median of 172,000

40

infections [IQR: 158,000 – 183,000] over the 11-year study period, a 52% reduction from baseline.

41

Compared to spraying once yearly in September, the best threshold-based strategy utilizing ULV had

42

fewer median infections (254,000 vs. 261,000), but required more spraying (351 vs. 274 days). For

43

TIRS, the best strategy was threshold-based, which led to the fewest infections of all strategies tested

44

(9,900; [IQR: 8,720 – 11,400], a 94% reduction), and required fewer days spraying than the equivalent

45

ULV strategy (280). Although spraying twice each year is likely to avert the most infections, our

results indicate that a threshold-based strategy can become an alternative to better balance the

47

translation of spraying effort into impact, particularly if used with a residual insecticide.

Author Summary (150-200)

49

Over half of the world’s population is at risk of infection by dengue virus (DENV) from Aedes aegypti

50

mosquitoes. While most infected people experience mild or asymptomatic infections, dengue can cause

51

severe symptoms, such as hemorrhage, shock, and death. A vaccine against dengue exists, but it can

52

increase the risk of severe disease in people who have not been previously infected by one of the four

53

DENV serotypes. In many places, therefore, the best currently available way to prevent outbreaks is by

54

controlling the mosquito population. Our study used a simulation model to explore alternative

55

strategies for deploying insecticide in the city of Iquitos in the Peruvian Amazon. Our simulations

56

closely matched empirical patterns from studies of dengue's ecology and epidemiology in Iquitos, such

57

as mosquito population dynamics, human household structure, demography, human and mosquito

58

movement, and virus transmission. Our results indicate that an insecticide that has a long-lasting,

59

residual effect will have the biggest impact on reducing DENV transmission. For non-residual

60

insecticides, we find that it is best to begin spraying close to the start of the dengue transmission

61

season, as mosquito populations can rebound quickly and resume previous levels of transmission.

62

Introduction

63

Dengue incidence is rising [1]. Current estimates indicate that over half of the world’s population is at

64

risk of dengue virus infection (DENV) [2]. The last decade has also seen explosive outbreaks of Zika

65

and chikungunya viruses, which are transmitted by Aedes aegypti, too. Because the only licensed

66

dengue vaccine is contraindicated in individuals without prior DENV exposure [3], and there are no

67

therapeutic options for Zika and chikungunya, the only intervention available to address these diseases

68

in most settings is vector control. The most common method for controlling adult Ae. aegypti is ultra3

69

low volume (ULV) spraying, defined as a treatment with minimum effective volume of the active

70

ingredient [4–6]. It can be implemented outdoors by plane [7] or trucks [8], or indoors by handheld

71

devices. Indoor application is considered most effective, because Ae. aegypti lives primarily inside

72

human habitations [4,9]. In Iquitos, Peru, where our study was focused, ULV is the most commonly

73

used method and has been repeatedly applied city-wide in response to past Aedes-transmitted virus

74

outbreaks [10].

75

Apart from the Western hemisphere-wide Ae. aegypti control program, which focused on

76

yellow fever prevention during the 1950s and 1960s [11], there have been two vector control programs

77

that have successfully controlled dengue: Cuba, which used ULV spraying complemented by larval

78

source reduction [12], and Singapore, which utilized larval source reduction and community

79

engagement [13]. A 2010 systematic review found five studies on indoor ULV [4], with generally high

80

(up to 100%) mosquito mortality effects that were sustained for only about one month [14–17]. An

81

exception was a study in Thailand, which found a sustained drop in Ae. aegypti landing rates out to six

82

months [18]. A more recent 2016 systematic review found no randomized controlled trials assessing

83

the impact of ULV spraying. A recent study in Iquitos reported that city-wide indoor ULV spraying

84

reduced the Ae. aegypti population by 60%, but effects were only sustained for a short period, also

85

about one month [9]. The sum of all this evidence indicates that indoor ULV spraying is effective at

86

reducing adult numbers in the short term [14–16], but with mixed evidence on its impact on virus

87

transmission and disease [4,19,20] and a lack of information on best practices for how to deploy ULV

88

at a city level [19,21].

89

Traditionally, indoor residual spraying (IRS) has been widely used against malaria, but has not

90

been recommended for control of Aedes-borne diseases [4]. In recent years, however, there has been

91

increased interest in utilizing IRS to combat Aedes-borne diseases. A 2016 systematic review found no

92

evidence of an effect of IRS on DENV infection risk [19], though only two studies were included in

93

that analysis. A more recent study using contact tracing reported a large epidemiological effect,

94

reducing the probability of future transmission by 86-96% in Cairns, Australia [22]. A study of IRS in

95

Iquitos found more than 80% mosquito mortality in 24 hours for eight weeks after spraying [10].

96

Recent work to develop targeted IRS (TIRS), where insecticide is sprayed only where Ae. aegypti are

97

likely to rest, led to gains in speed of application, without significant declines in effectiveness [23].

98

Increased speed coupled with the relatively small size of Iquitos makes it a feasible location to

99

undertake city-wide TIRS spraying. The primary drawback is that, there are no published details on

100
101

best practices for undertaking this approach.
Field trials to measure effectiveness and compare different strategies are logistically

102

challenging and in some cases prohibitively expensive due to the complex interplay of mosquito

103

population dynamics, seasonal dynamics, human movement, and fine-scale heterogeneities [19,24–32].

104

Mathematical modeling can be helpful in multifaceted cases like this for predicting the best

105

intervention strategies. Additionally, the rebound in adult mosquito abundance following spraying

106

[9,16,19], due to immature emergence and movement, and feedbacks caused by reduced egg-laying due

107

to increased adult mortality, mean that it is important to capture mosquito population dynamics when

108

modeling vector control strategies. For example, models have been used for many diseases to analyze

109

causes of outbreaks and to help optimize response strategies; increasingly, this is happening in real-

110

time during outbreaks [33]. Examples include diphtheria among Rohingya refugees [34], where real-

111

time modeling informed resource allocation and transmission mechanisms; the 2013-16 west African

112

Ebola outbreak [35,36]; optimum vaccination strategies in response to measles outbreaks [37–40]; and

113

seasonal malaria prophylaxis [41,42]. Recent modeling studies evaluated the impact on dengue of

114

outdoor, truck-mounted ULV spraying in Porto Alegre, Brazil and IRS in Merida, Mexico [8,43]. The

115

former reported that 24% of cases were averted and the latter found that IRS strategies initiated early in

116

the transmission season were generally superior to those initiated late in the season.

117

One challenge associated with ULV and IRS campaigns is determining the criteria for initiating such a

118

response. Brady et al. [44] discussed a variety of ways to determine when a dengue outbreak is

119

occurring, predominantly based on comparison of current incidence from patterns in recent years. An

120

alternative to initiating an intervention when a threshold has been exceeded would be to start the

121

intervention at the same time each year in an effort to prevent transmission from reaching outbreak

122

levels. Hladish et al., considered campaign start date for IRS, finding that deploying IRS four months

123

before the seasonal peak produced the greatest impact on infections [43]. Several studies of malaria

124

also found that IRS timing was important [42,45], and one study assessed ULV timing in relation to

125

Triatoma dimidiata, the vector for Chagas disease [46]. Few studies have compared alternative

126

methods for initiating outbreak response though, and none, to our knowledge, did so for the impact of

127

indoor ULV on dengue. An added complication is the characteristic variation in seasonal patterns of

128

DENV transmission [20], which along with the aforementioned complex interplay of heterogeneities

129

can result in vector control strategies with the biggest impact on mosquitoes not necessarily

130

corresponding to the biggest reduction in human infections.

131

To address these challenges, in this study we used a transmission model to investigate the

132

optimal application of indoor ULV or TIRS for dengue control in Iquitos, Peru. Because the timing of

133

DENV transmission seasons can vary considerably across years, we sought criteria that were optimal in

134

the sense of being robust across multiple years, rather than optimizing outbreak response for a single

135

outbreak year. We compared several possible threshold-based strategies, based on a variety of outbreak

136

definitions, to strategies in which insecticide was sprayed regularly on the same date, either once or

137

twice a year, starting at different times each year.

Methods

139

Study area and synthetic location generation

140

Our model was calibrated to data from Iquitos, which has a population of about 450,000 people in the

141

Peruvian Amazon [47,48] and where all four DENV serotypes are endemic. Our analysis focuses on

142

the period 2000-2010, in which DENV-3 and DENV-4 were introduced (in 2001 and 2008,

143

respectively). Locations and coordinates of almost half (40,839/92,891) of the locations in the city were

144

collected during surveys conducted as part of prospective cohort studies [49]. For the remaining

145

locations, we randomly assigned them to ministry of health zones, so that the total number within each

146

zone matched that recorded in past citywide spraying campaigns [9]. The location type (e.g., home,

147

shop, etc.) of each of these new locations was randomly assigned so that the final distribution of

148

location types matched that from the aforementioned surveys. Their positions were distributed using

149

the rSSI algorithm in the spatstat package in R [50,51], so that they were evenly distributed, and at least

150

5 m separated each location.

151

Model overview

152

We simulated outbreak response strategies using an established agent-based model of dengue virus

153

dynamics in Iquitos. This model has been shown to accurately recreate the dynamics of all four DENV

154

serotypes in Iquitos, and has previously been used to answer questions relating to DENV vaccination

155

[47,48,52]. Human agents in the model move according to realistic movement patterns in Iquitos [53].

156

Household composition and demographic patterns match those seen in Iquitos and Peru as a whole,

157

respectively. Mosquito agents move with fixed probability of 0.3 to a nearby location [54] and have a

158

propensity to bite that depends on temperature, the host’s body size, and whether it is the mosquito’s

159

first bite. Four stages of mosquito development are explicitly modeled (eggs, larvae, pupae, and female

160

adults), with density-dependent mortality occurring in the larval stage. Mosquito population dynamics

161

were calibrated, via an additional mortality rate acting on pupae and larvae, so that adult female

162

abundance matched a spatiotemporal estimate of abundance in Iquitos [49]. The model assumed that all

163

four DENV serotypes can be transmitted when either a mosquito or human is infectious, the other

164

susceptible, and the mosquito takes a bloodmeal. Transmission occurs with probability 0.9 from

165

mosquitoes to humans and a time-varying probability from humans to mosquitoes [55,56]. Following

166

infection with one DENV serotype, human agents exhibit permanent immunity to that serotype and

167

temporary immunity to the other serotypes for a period of 686 days on average [57]. The rate of

168

introduction of each DENV serotype into the population was calibrated so that serotype-specific

169

incidence of infection matched that predicted for Iquitos in a previous study [58]. All features of the

170

model have been thoroughly described in a prior publication [47], and further details are described in

171

the Supplementary Material.

172

Hypothetical spraying protocol

173

We set in place an outbreak response intervention based on a zonal spraying strategy. Spraying takes

174

place on Monday through Saturday. There are 35 Ministry of Health zones in Iquitos, and the outbreak

175

response sprays these 35 zones in batches of a fixed number, until all zones are sprayed (Figure 1).

176

After a period of time, another cycle of spraying the 35 zones in batches is initiated, and this process is

177

repeated until a fixed number of cycles have been completed. The number of houses to spray per day is

178

limited by a maximum number of houses that can be sprayed each day. The probability that occupants

179

will be at home and allow the outbreak response team to spray is represented by a compliance

180

probability. The form of vector control is assumed to be an adult insecticide that increases the baseline

181

mortality of mosquitoes by a fixed hazard, called thoroughness. For ultra-low volume (ULV) spraying,

182

the increase in mortality decays exponentially following spraying with a half-life of one day. The most

183

realistic parameterization, based on records of past city-wide spraying campaigns, involved attempting

184

to spray 11,000 houses per day on average, of which ~6,800 (62%) were compliant. Six or seven zones

185

were sprayed simultaneously so that each zone was sprayed three times over a 3-4 week period. There

186

was no training period, no waiting periods between spray cycles, and no repeat visits to houses. We

187

calibrated the intervention thoroughness such that the intervention campaign would generate an

188

approximately 60% drop in total city-wide mosquito abundance following spraying, consistent with

189

empirical estimates for Iquitos by Gunning et al. [9].

193

We also simulated city-wide TIRS spraying. In this case, we changed the number of houses

194

sprayed per day, the thoroughness (i.e., the increase in mosquito mortality), and the residuality of the

195

insecticide. Based on the estimate that it takes 5-6 times longer to spray a house using TIRS compared

196

to ULV (~3 minutes vs. ~15 minutes) [23], we used 2,000 as an upper limit on the number of houses

197

sprayed daily for TIRS. We calibrated the thoroughness and the residuality so that the 24-hour

198

mortality matched that observed for TIRS in Dunbar et al. [23]. This led to a function which had an

199

increase in mosquito mortality of nine deaths/mosquito-day (i.e., increased the daily risk to close to 1),

200

which decayed exponentially after 90 days following treatment, with a half-life of 11 days (Figure 2).

201

In the TIRS scenario, each campaign consisted of just one city-wide cycle, compared to three spray

202

cycles for ULV campaigns.

207

once yearly, or twice yearly. In the threshold-based strategies, spraying is initiated when the weekly or

208

monthly incidence rises one or two standard deviations above the mean incidence from the

209

corresponding week or month from the previous five years (henceforth, adaptive threshold strategies),

210

or when weekly or monthly incidence rises above a fixed threshold (henceforth, fixed threshold

211

strategies) [44]. This leads to a total of four possible adaptive threshold strategies. Note that for the

212

purposes of initiating threshold strategies, incidence represents cases that are symptomatic, whereas in

213

the results, we generally report the number of infections a particular strategy leads to, irrespective of

214

symptoms. The yearly and twice yearly strategies begin at the same time(s) each year. We tested yearly

215

spraying starting in each month (12 strategies) and twice-yearly spraying in each pair of months (66

216

strategies) (Table 1). Due to the residual effect of TIRS and the longer roll-out of the campaign we did

217

not explore twice-yearly strategies for this intervention. We compared the number of infections

218

predicted under each of these initiation strategies to the number predicted had there been no spraying

219

over the years 2000-2010. To focus on the effect of the strategy for initiating spraying, we sprayed the

220

Ministry of Health zones in the same order in each simulation. For the same reason, we used the same

221

time series of DENV introduction in each simulation; namely, the trajectory associated with the highest

222

likelihood following the calibration procedure. We chose the number of simulations so that in the

223

absence of spraying, the change in the coefficient of variation of the number of human infections as

224

new simulations were added was less than 0.1% (about 400 simulations) [60]. For model outputs we

225

present the median and the interquartile range (IQR). We use the IQR as the model is highly stochastic

226

and this measure of dispersion is robust to the presence of outliers.

228

Sensitivity analysis

229

For each of the optimum adaptive threshold, yearly, and, in the case of ULV, twice yearly strategies,

230

we undertook a global sensitivity analysis of the total number of human infections and mosquito

231

abundance. For each of the parameters governing spraying (thoroughness, delay between cycles, for

232

ULV only, and compliance), we selected a range of plausible values using the sampling approach of

233

Saltelli et al. [61], and simulated the best outbreak response strategies for each of these [62]. We then

234

decomposed the variance in the output into first and higher order effects of the sampled parameters

235

using the SALib package in Python [63]. Because the data used to parameterize the TIRS strategy were

236

from a controlled experiment, we also reduced the thoroughness in the TIRS adaptive threshold

237

strategy to the value used for ULV spraying (1.5) and to half this value (0.75), while keeping all other

238

parameters the same. Finally, we simulated the adaptive threshold strategies for both IRS and ULV in

239

scenarios where (a) only 10% of cases were reported, and (b) there was a lag of 2 weeks between

240

infection and notification.

241

Results

242

Unsurprisingly, TIRS was able to prevent more cases overall than ULV (Table 2). The best adaptive

243

threshold strategies for TIRS started more quickly following a rise in incidence than the best ULV

244

strategies and earlier in the year for the best yearly strategy. Due to its higher efficacy and long-lasting

245

effect, TIRS had an order of magnitude greater impact than ULV on the number of infections predicted.

Ultra-low volume spraying

250

In the absence of spraying, the model predicted a median of 361,000 infections [IQR: 347,000 –

251

383,000] across the four serotypes in Iquitos in the period 2000-2010. The adaptive threshold strategy

252

performed best when the incidence was monitored on a monthly basis and when spraying was initiated

253

when incidence exceeded the mean plus one standard deviation from the last five years (254,000

254

infections; IQR: 210,000 – 277,000). The difference in the impact on incidence between the adaptive

255

threshold strategies was small (Figure 3a). When spraying was initiated yearly, our model predicted

256

that starting in September would lead to the fewest cases (261,000; IQR: 250,000 – 277,000), although

257

spraying in October produced slightly higher, but similar results (262,000; IQR: 253,000 – 275,000)

258

(Figure 3b). In the case of yearly spraying, timing was important; we saw large differences between the

259

best and worst strategies. It is also worth noting that the yearly strategy which led to the lowest average

260

mosquito abundance was spraying in November, not September (Supplementary Figure 1). The best

261

strategy for spraying twice yearly was spraying in September and November (172,000; IQR: 158,000 –

262

183,000) (Figure 3c). Generally, undertaking the first spray in August or September (typically, just

263

before the dengue season) and the second in October or November (typically, near the start of the

264

dengue season) led to the fewest cases (Figure 3c). In this case, the strategy that led to the fewest cases

277

Comparing the best strategies, spraying twice yearly (in October and March) averted the most

278

infections, but required the most spraying campaigns: 22 campaigns of spraying, spending a median of

279

549 days spraying in total over 11 years. The best adaptive threshold strategy typically led to fewer

280

cases than the best yearly strategy, but required more spray campaigns (a median of 14 [IQR: 14 - 15]

281

compared to 11 for a yearly strategy). In seasons with a large outbreak (2000-01, 2001-02, 2002-03,

282

2008-09, and 2009-10), the adaptive threshold strategy typically performed better than the yearly

283

strategy (Figure 4, Supplementary Figure 2). In years without a large outbreak, the adaptive threshold

284

strategy performed worst, even worse than not spraying at all, because herd immunity was reduced

285

from previous years of spraying, while no spraying happened in that year because the threshold was not

286

met (See, for example, the 2003-2004 and 2006-2007 seasons, Supplementary Figure 2).

290

quartile range. The vertical dotted lines represent the start of city-wide ULV campaigns (not displayed

for the threshold strategy, as in this case campaigns start at differing times depending on incidence).

292

When we initiated spraying with a fixed threshold (i.e., one that does not depend on the mean

293

and standard deviation from recent years), then the number of infections had a nonlinear relationship

294

with the magnitude of the threshold (Figure 5). Counterintuitively, we observed higher numbers of

295

infections at lower thresholds for spraying than at higher thresholds, even though for low thresholds we

296

sprayed more (Figure 5, top and bottom rows). We saw what appeared to be two regimes: declining

297

numbers of infections as we increased the threshold for spraying until about 400 infections per month

298

(or 130 per week), and a more modest increase in the number of infections as we increased the

299

threshold above that number. To explore this pattern, we stratified the simulations into those for which

300

the threshold was below 400 cases per month (or 130 cases per week), and those where the threshold

301

was above this (Figure 6). When the threshold was low, spraying often occurred too soon, before

302

outbreaks began in earnest, and, because we were limited to two spray campaigns per year, we

303

effectively used up our quota by the time the outbreak occurred (Figure 6; top row). At higher

304

thresholds, spray campaigns more closely corresponded to times when transmission was ongoing and,

305

consequently, the subsequent incidence was lower even though fewer days spent spraying were

306

required (Figure 6; bottom row).

320

Targeted indoor residual spraying

321

The strategy for beginning city-wide TIRS that led to fewest cases was to begin when the weekly

322

incidence was one standard deviation above the mean, resulting in 9,900 infections (IQR: 8,720 –

323

11,300). This strategy reacted more quickly than the best adaptive threshold ULV strategy (i.e.,

324

monitoring incidence monthly). The result was many fewer infections (17-fold) than the best ULV

325

strategy, which led to a median of 172,000 infections. Because spraying the whole city once with TIRS

326

took longer than spraying the whole city three times with ULV (35 days vs 25 days), the yearly strategy

327

required spraying for more days for TIRS than for ULV. When using an adaptive threshold strategy

328

though, fewer days were spent spraying than any other strategy tested (median of 280 days), despite it

329

also having the largest impact on number of infections (Table 2). The best yearly strategy was to begin

330

spraying each September, which resulted in 11,800 cases (IQR: 9,750 – 14,100). There were smaller

331

differences between the yearly TIRS strategies than for ULV spraying, particularly for the yearly

332

strategies (compare Figure 7 to Figure 3). Overall, all TIRS strategies had a much larger impact on the

333

number of infections than did ULV strategies, and were able to almost completely avert some

334

outbreaks in later years (Figure 8). This is because repeated applications of IRS almost eliminate Ae.

335

aegypti from Iquitos (Supplementary Figure 3). When initiating TIRS after incidence exceeded a fixed

336

threshold, the number of predicted cases increased approximately linearly with the threshold (Figure 9).

Sensitivity analysis

358

Keeping all other parameters the same, we jointly varied the thoroughness of spraying (i.e., the increase

359

in the daily mortality rate), the compliance of houses, and, in the case of ULV strategies, the delay

360

between spray cycles. For the best adaptive threshold strategy, surveillance effort did not have a large

361

effect on the predicted number of cases. This is because our threshold is based on incidence from recent

362

years, so if only a proportion of cases are notified, then the threshold will be that proportion of its value

363

if all cases were notified, and the time at which spraying starts will be similar. Increasing the

364

thoroughness of the spraying (or, equivalently, the efficacy of the treatment) leads to fewer cases

365

averted for small values of thoroughness (Figure 10, left column). However, for values of thoroughness

366

above 3 (a daily mortality risk of about 95%), increasing the thoroughness further does not lead to

367

further gains. The probability that a household complies with spraying has a strong negative

368

relationship with the number of infections predicted for all strategies (Figure 10, right column).

369

In the case of TIRS, reducing the thoroughness of spraying did not have a strong effect on the

370

number of infections (Supplementary Figure 4). Even for low thoroughness of 0.5, all TIRS

371

implementations lead to fewer than 80,000 infections, a more than 4.5-fold reduction from the baseline

372

number of infections (361,000). For the adaptive threshold strategy, reduced household compliance did

373

not have a large effect on the number of infections above a compliance of 0.4 (much below the

374

observed compliance of 0.7). Compliance had a stronger impact on the number of infections for the

375

yearly strategy, in which improved compliance generally led to fewer cases. For both TIRS and ULV

376

spraying campaigns, the variance in compliance determined more than half of the overall variance in

377

the number of infections in all cases except for the adaptive threshold TIRS strategy (Supplementary

378

Figure 5). In the case of adaptive threshold TIRS, there was a substantial interaction between

379

compliance and the thoroughness of the spraying, with the interaction between these terms determining

380

for 39% of the variance in the output.

381

When we reduced thoroughness of TIRS to 1.5 (i.e., the same as that used in ULV spraying),

382

then the best reactive threshold strategy was the same as when the thoroughness was 9: spraying when

383

weekly incidence is more than one standard deviation above the mean. Moreover, it had only a small

384

impact on the number of infections we predicted: 12,800 infections (IQR: 12,000 – 14,100) compared

385

to 9,900 in the baseline case. When we reduced thoroughness further (to 0.75), the best threshold

386

strategy remained the same, and the impact of the number of infections was still large: we predicted

387

14,300 infections (IQR: 13,500 – 15,700). In the case of the once yearly strategy, reducing the

388

thoroughness to 1.5 or 0.75 led to predictions of 35,800 (IQR: 32,500 – 38,500) and 45,300 (IQR:

389

41,900 – 49,700), respectively, and changed the best month to spray to August (compared to September

390

in the baseline case).

391

In the baseline case, we assumed that 100% of symptomatic cases were notified when

392

calculating whether the threshold for response was reached. However, as the adaptive threshold was

393

itself based on past incidence of notified cases, it indirectly included reporting rate, and so a fixed level

394

under-reporting should not greatly affect response timing, beyond increasing stochasticity. We tested

395

this logic by decreasing the reporting rate to 10%. In this case we observed 248,000 (IQR: 197,000 –

396

275,000) and 6,370 (IQR: 5,030 – 7,620) infections for city-wide ULV and IRS campaigns,

397

respectively (recall this is the total number of infections and so is unaffected by reporting rate). These

398

values were both below the baseline median prediction for full reporting. The best strategies in both

399

instances remained the same as in the baseline, full-reporting case. If surveillance of cases lagged by

Discussion

414

We used an agent-based model of DENV transmission in Iquitos, Peru, to compare strategies for

415

initiating city-wide spraying with either ULV or TIRS. None of the city-wide ULV spraying strategies

416

were able to prevent outbreaks, but the best strategies reduced the total number of infections over an

417

eleven-year period by around a half. Strategies that used TIRS were able to almost completely

418

eliminate Ae. aegypti from Iquitos, and so prevent an order of magnitude more infections than ULV.

419

The best strategy for ULV spraying was to spray twice per year, in September and November. Spraying

420

yearly in September prevented slightly fewer infections, but required spraying slightly less, than the

421

best adaptive threshold strategy. The yearly and twice yearly strategies also tended to lead to fewer

422

infections than the adaptive threshold strategies in those years when there was not a large outbreak. The

423

best strategy tested for TIRS was an adaptive threshold one, which had the biggest impact on the

424

numbers of infections of all strategies tested. Moreover, it also required the fewest days spent spraying

425

compared to all other strategies (280 days over 11 years).

426

When considering initiation of a city-wide ULV campaign, two factors stood out as optimizing the

427

impact of outbreak response: (1) begin spraying when the monthly incidence is one standard deviation
27

428

above the mean, and (2) use a relatively high fixed threshold (for Iquitos: ~400 cases/month) for

429

initiating outbreak response. Taken together, these observations indicate that after an initial increase in

430

incidence, not reacting too quickly can result in a more effective city-wide ULV response. This makes

431

sense, due to the short-term effect of ULV spraying and the capacity of Ae. aegypti populations to

432

rebound rapidly. If we instead consider TIRS, our results indicate that timing is less important, due to

433

the residual effect of the insecticide. Moreover, reductions in vector abundances and numbers of

434

infections would be even further reduced with longer lasting insecticides, such as those with 150-day

435

effects that are now becoming available [43].

436

Our sensitivity analysis indicated that the level of surveillance effort did not have a strong effect on the

437

predicted number of cases, due to the fact that the adaptive threshold calculation inherently captures

438

this under-reporting, if it occurs at a constant rate. This would not be the case, however, if the rate of

439

under-reporting changed over time. For instance, if reporting rate increased through time, then

440

thresholds would be based on a smaller proportion of cases than the current year’s incidence, which

441

would lead to us spraying too soon due to an artificially small threshold. This could happen if, for

442

example, reporting of DENV infections became more frequent as awareness of symptoms grew among

443

the public and/or clinicians. In addition, a lag in reporting did not have a big impact on our model's

444

results about the number of infections prevented by a city-wide TIRS campaign. This was not the case

445

for ULV, though. In that case, a lag of two weeks actually led to fewer infections, implying that, if

446

there is not an inherent lag in reporting, it may be worthwhile to wait once the threshold has passed

447

before beginning a city-wide ULV campaign.

448

Reassuringly, the impact of a city-wide TIRS campaign was robust to more pessimistic assumptions

449

about the thoroughness with which the insecticide is sprayed (or its efficacy) and the compliance of

450

households, in addition to under-reporting and lags in reporting. This means that, even when the

451

increase in mosquito mortality caused by TIRS at baseline was an order of magnitude below that

452

observed by Dunbar et al. [23], or when half as many houses were treated as observed in city-wide

453

ULV campaigns, then the effect of a city-wide IRS campaign was not greatly impacted.

454

Because the seasonality of DENV transmission is highly irregular in Iquitos [20], a characteristic of

455

DENV transmission in general, yearly strategies can be expected to perform very well in some years

456

(e.g., 2002-03) but poorly in others (e.g., 2001-02), especially if spraying occurs too soon. This implies

457

that caution should be taken to not overinterpret our result that September seemed to be the best month

458

to initiate ULV spraying. September was largely best because application at that time strongly

459

mitigated the 2002-2003 season, which was specific to the particular importation patterns that sparked

460

local transmission during the 2000-2010 period of our analysis. Generalizing across ULV strategies

461

though, it seems that strategies that initiate just before or early in the season perform best.

462

Although we have compared results of city-wide ULV spraying with results of city-wide TIRS, there

463

are some caveats to this comparison. First, we parameterized ULV spraying using a study of actual

464

city-wide spraying campaigns in Iquitos, while we parameterized TIRS using a controlled study from a

465

different country. It is possible that in reality TIRS may have lower effectiveness, although we saw in

466

our sensitivity analysis that if we reduced TIRS to the level of thoroughness used for ULV, the impact

467

on the number of infections was still much greater for TIRS. Secondly, it may not be feasible to

468

undertake city-wide TIRS campaigns, due to the greater cost and time commitment associated with

469

city-wide spray campaigns. On the other hand, our results show that, in the long-term, we would

470

actually need to spray less using TIRS due to the reduced case-load and large reduction in mosquito

471

abundance.

472

Our prediction that the optimal indoor ULV strategy could lead to a reduction of infections by up to

473

around 50% exceeds an estimate from a recent modeling study from Porto Alegre, Brazil, which

474

reported that outdoor truck-mounted ULV spraying reduced the number of secondary infections by

475

around 25% [8]. At the same time, our estimate is lower than the 85% reduction in cases due to outdoor

476

ULV spraying reported by Wahid et al. [64] in Malakar, Indonesia, although ULV was applied there in

477

conjunction with other interventions (reactive ULV, larviciding, and larval source reduction) [64]. A

478

previous modeling study of IRS spraying in Merida, Mexico found that proactive strategies (i.e., before

479

the season) outperformed reactive strategies [43]. That is commensurate with our results, as each of our

480

threshold strategies and the best performing yearly strategies all involve spraying before the season.

481

The observation of Hladish et al. [43] that campaigns that start after the peak in incidence can still have

482

a large effect is consistent with our result that the month when we started TIRS was less important than

483

for ULV. Our prediction of a 97% reduction in the number of infections for repeated TIRS campaigns

484

with about 70% coverage each year is greater than that found by Haldish et al. [43] (79% reduction in

485

caseloads over 5 years with 75% coverage in Merida, Mexico) and Vazquez-Prokopec et al. [22] (86%

486

reduction in transmission in treated houses in Cairns, Australia). Comparing to Hladish et al. [43], our

487

higher predicted impact may be because our model incorporates a more detailed entomological

488

component with immature stages and spatial heterogeneity. This means that feedbacks caused by fewer

489

mosquitoes laying fewer eggs, and stochastic local fade-out of adult mosquitoes, allow the Ae. aegypti

490

population to be reduced to very low numbers after several years of TIRS application.

491

For all ULV strategies, the approach that led to the fewest cases was not necessarily the same as the

492

strategy that reduced mosquito abundance the most, reemphasizing the point made by previous studies

493

of the importance of measuring epidemiological endpoints when assessing vector control [65,66]. This

494

difference is likely due to DENV transmission being the result of a complex interplay of factors, not

495

simply a direct, positive relationship with Ae. aegypti abundance. The best strategy also differed by

496

year. In years with low incidence, the adaptive threshold strategies performed poorly, because a

497

response was not triggered.

498

A limitation of our study is that there are few published results on the impact of ULV or TIRS on

499

dengue incidence with which to validate our model [65,66]. This is mitigated somewhat by our model’s

500

incorporation of mosquito population dynamics that match observed patterns from Iquitos [49], as well

501

as matching ULV mortality effects to a study carried out in Iquitos and IRS effects to a controlled study

502

in Mexico [9,10]. A second limitation is that, because our model reproduces the seasonal patterns

503

observed in the period 2000-2010, our results may be somewhat specific to DENV transmission and

504

mosquito population patterns at that particular place and time. While our results regarding threshold

505

spraying strategies are likely to be robust to this this concern, our predictions for when regular spraying

506

should begin may be less robust, and could, for example, differ if importation rates peak at different

507

points in the transmission season. On the other hand, grounding of our model in data from Iquitos,

508

which is an extremely well-characterized site for DENV transmission and Ae. aegypti population

509

dynamics, is a notable strength. Another strength is our model’s level of detail, which is something that

510

enables us to capture the interplay of two important feedbacks in mosquito population dynamics

511

following spraying: (1) density-dependent mortality in the larval stage causing the population to

512

rebound and (2) reduced egg-laying by adults. We are also able to capture local mosquito population

513

depletion to zero due to demographic stochasticity and subsequent population rebounding due to

514

mosquito movement.

515

Our results indicate that the city-wide ULV and TIRS campaigns would have reduced the number of

516

DENV infections in Iquitos by up to half relative to the baseline scenario that we modeled. Although a

517

well-timed campaign could be expected to mitigate transmission in a particular season, it would be

518

difficult to prevent an outbreak altogether using ULV or TIRS. Similarly, selecting a single strategy

519

that consistently mitigated outbreaks across multiple years proved to be difficult. For example, our

520

adaptive threshold strategies performed well during the 2001-2002 transmission season, but poorly in

521

2002-2003. The opposite was true of the yearly strategy. With indoor ULV spraying, the best strategy

522

was with a fixed threshold of around 400 infections per month. A downside of this approach is that it

523

requires accurate, timely, and potentially expensive surveillance. More field work is needed to better

524

understand the feasibility and effectiveness of city-wide TIRS, including its spatially targeted

525

application in combination with ULV. We predict, however, that city-wide TIRS, if feasible, will have

526

a greater impact than ULV without asking significantly more from surveillance.

Supplementary Text S1. Agent-based model of dengue virus
transmission.

561

An ABM consists of “agents” (in this case, people and mosquitoes) who interact with each other in a

562

shared environment. The environment of our model was represented by climate conditions and a set of

563

locations, such as houses, schools, parks, cemeteries, and churches. Climate conditions affected

564

mosquito biting frequency, survival, and incubation time of DENV. Locations represented all 92,891

565

buildings in the city. For about 38,835 of these locations, mainly in the central portion of the city, we

566

had data on exact coordinates and location type. For the remainder, we randomly distributed the

567

locations and randomly assigned a location type. Agents represented approximately 450,000

568

individuals that live in this area [47].

569

Our synthetic population realistically portrayed the population of Iquitos in terms of demographic

570

characteristics of how people are distributed across houses and over time. Specifically, the

571

demographic profiles of the modeled households were consistent with survey data collected during a

572

previous study [31]. The population-wide sex and age distributions were consistent with U.N. estimates

573

for Peru. To represent population changes in time, we simulated human births and deaths that match

574

those estimated by the U.N. for Iquitos, while simultaneously preserving realistic household

575

compositions by placing newborn children in houses with appropriately aged mothers as determined by

576

U.N. estimates of age-specific fertility of Peru [47]. For each person, we simulated daily human

577

movement patterns with a model previously described by Perkins et al. [53], which was fitted to data

578

from retrospective, semi-structured interviews of residents of Iquitos [67,68].

579

We modeled three immature mosquito stages (eggs, larvae, and pupae) deterministically at each

580

location. Development and mortality rates for each of these stages, along with adult mortality rates and

581

the rate at which pupae emerged as adults, varied daily, and are based on empirically derived

582

temperature-dependent relationships and weather data from Iquitos [54,69]. Additionally, larval density

583

dependent mortality and an additional rate of death in both the larval and pupal stages are calibrated so

584

that adult mosquito abundance matches the spatio-temporal heterogeneity predicted by a previous study

585

from Iquitos [49]. Adult mosquitoes blood-fed on humans who were co-located with a mosquito during

586

its time of blood-feeding at rates informed by empirical relationships with temperature [69,70]. Each

587

day, mosquitoes moved to adjacent locations based on a probability of 0.3, consistent with another

588

agent-based model of Ae. aegypti population dynamics in Iquitos [54].

589

The transmission of DENV to humans, and to mosquitoes, occurred through mosquito bites. The

590

probability of transmission from humans to mosquitoes was determined by the viremia levels of the

591

infecting human at the time of the bite [71]. After completion of a temperature-dependent extrinsic

592

incubation period [72], infectious mosquitoes transmitted DENV to susceptible humans with a fixed

593

probability of 1.0 [55]. Infected humans became infectious and, with a probability informed by

594

empirical studies [73], developed symptoms following a latency period linked to the timing of peak

595

viremia [72]. After recovering from infection, humans gained permanent immunity to the infecting

596

serotype and temporary immunity against heterotypic infections for a period of time. The duration of

597

temporary immunity was exponentially distributed across people with a mean of 686 days, as estimated

598

by a previous model-based analyses of serotype-specific dengue incidence time series [57]. We

599

assigned the initial level of population immunity to each serotype in the population based on estimates

600

by Reiner et al. [58].
