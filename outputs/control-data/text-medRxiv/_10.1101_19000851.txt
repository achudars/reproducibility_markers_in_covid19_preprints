ABSTRACT
Most people begin their sexual relationship during adolescence and some get involved in risky
life threatening behaviors such as unwanted pregnancies, abortions and sexually transmitted
infections. This study was therefore designed to understand the patterns of female adolescents
sexual behaviours and sexual coercion experience.
A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among 1227 in-school adolescents in the
three senatorial district of Osun State, Southwestern Nigeria. Multi-stage sampling technique
was used to select the respondents, and data were collected with pre-tested, semi-structured
questionnaires. The data collected were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences
(SPSS version 21).
Three hundred and thirty seven (27.5%) were sexually exposed with a mean age of sexual
initiation of 14.88±2. 46 years. Of the 337 that were sexually exposed 153(56.5%) initiated sex
early between the ages of 10-15 years, while (4.7%) had uses drugs or take alcohol before sexual
intercourse. Findings revealed that of those that were sexually exposed, 122(11%) were forced
to have sex, 101(9.1%) played sex willingly, while 29(2.6%) felt threatened and 3(0.3%) were
convinced with money. The proportion of the respondent who reported rape and abduction was
(2.6%).
Finding from this study is consistent with earlier studies conducted in many other Nigerian cities
which showed that in-school adolescents to be sexually active. There is the need to step up
campaigns to address this noticed lapse in behavior among the students in order to arrest the
usual consequences of such risky sexual behavior.

INTRODUCTION
One of the fundamental human rights, according to the United Nations Education Scientific and
Cultural Organization-UNESCO is the right to protection from harmful influences, abuse and
exploitation (United Nations Children Emergency Fund, 1989).

United Nations Children

Emergency Fund-UNICEF reiterated that its mission is to advocate for the protection of
children’s rights, especially children under the age of 18 years, to help meet their basic needs and
to expand their opportunities to reach their full potentials. These rights among others include the
right to protect children from sexual harassment and abuse, and right to be educated (United
Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization, 1978).
The period of adolescence is one of the most intriguing and difficult transitions in the life span of
a mankind (Adegoke, 2003). Adolescence is defined as a period characterized by an series of
challenges and confusion both to the adolescents and the adults who are supposed to show
understanding (Moronkola, 2003). According to (Krost, et.al, 2001), the period of adolescence is
the most controversial of all the three developmental stages due to experimental risky behaviors
associated with it.
Most people begin their sexual relationship during adolescence and some get involved in risky
life threatening behaviors such as unwanted pregnancies, abortions and sexually transmitted
infections (Action Health Incorporated, 2003). This can be attributed to ignorance in interpreting
and managing self in response to the upsurge of hormones during this period. Contributory
factors also include lack of information on sexual health and HIV, low levels of condom use, and
high levels of sexually transmitted infections (UNGASS, 2010)
Adolescents in Nigeria were seen as a healthy segment of the population and received low
priority for services until recently. In Nigeria adolescent have high burden of reproductive health
problems and this assertion is supported by surveys conducted on sexual behaviours of
adolescents which shows that Nigerian adolescent (15‐19) almost half of the females (46.2%)
and about a quarter of males (22.1%) have engaged in sexual intercourse (National Demographic
Health Survey, 2013; FMOH National HIV/AIDS and Reproductive Health Survey 2007; FMOH
Integrated Biological and Behavioural Surveillance Survey, 2010).

Bothersome still is data from the Federal Ministry of Education in 2009 which found that 21% of
upper primary school children surveyed indicated they have been involved in sexual intercourse
yet only 40.6% who had two or more sexual partners in the past 12 months reported using a
condom during their last sexual intercourse (National Demographic health Survey, 2008). A
study conducted in Nigeria by WHO and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) revealed
that about 2,400,000 and 2,600,000 people at 15 years of age had HIV/AIDS in 2003 and 2005,
respectively (UNFPA, 2014).
Also in Nigeria, where the policy on population specifies the reduction of teenage pregnancy as a
target to be met by the year 2010, the gravity of the problem is highlighted by result of the 2008
Demography and Health survey (DHS) which revealed that 23% of women aged 15 – 19 years
are already mothers or are pregnant with their first child (NPC, 2009). According to the Federal
Republic of Nigeria (FRON, 2012), twice as many girls than boys engage in sexual activity
before the age of 15 years. Adolescents are exposed to high risk of sexually transmitted
infections (Ergene, et.al., 2005). The situation becomes worse in a country like Nigeria where
the concept of sex cannot be openly discussed even while the young people are clearly sexually
active.
Female adolescents have sexual and reproductive health needs that remain poorly understood or
adequately attended to worldwide (WHO, 2004). It can be seen from the foregoing that
neglecting this population has serious implications on the future of any nation. Sexual activities
of female adolescents predispose them to adverse effects including unwanted pregnancies, unsafe
abortions and sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS. In Nigeria, both the brothel
and non-brothel female sex workers rank first on the most at risk to HIV infections group
(Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2012). According to (Wellings et.al., 2006), the use of condoms
has increased among adolescents but levels of use are still not sufficient to substantially reduce
the spread of HIV (Central Intelligence Agency World Fact book, 2010).
Sexual coercion is an increasingly common experience among female youth throughout the
developing world and Several studies have suggested that the experience of sexual coercion
leads to a greater likelihood of risky sexual behavior, such as early sexual debut, many sexual
partners, and inconsistent condom use (Garoma et.al., 2008; Hovsepian et.al., 2010).Sexual
coercion refers to an array of encounters that compel an individual to have sex against his or her

will. These encounters include violence, threats of violence, verbal threats and insistence,
deception, or economic conditions that leave an individual with a lack of an ability to choose not
to engage in sex (Heise et al.,1995).
Sexual coercion among young people encompasses a range of experiences, ranging from
noncontact forms such as verbal sexual abuse, kissing, caressing, petting, genital touching,
attempted rape, forced penetrative sex (vaginal, oral, or anal), and any other sexually laden
behavior that makes the victim feel uncomfortable. It also includes sex obtained as a result of
intimidation, pressure, blackmail, deception, forced alcohol and drug use, and threats of
abandonment or of withholding economic support. Transactional sex through money, gifts, or
other economic incentives (especially in the context of extreme poverty) often has a coercive
aspect as well (Shireen et.al., 2003; Michael et.al., 2004).
The consequences of sexual coercion are alarming: they are short and long-term; and have
physical, psychological and social effects. School performance can also be affected. It has
negative association with social and health outcomes, and it therefore, is an important public
health issue. Significant number of young people experience sexual coercion (nonconsensual
sex), such coercion is a violation of a person’s rights and can have severe physical, mental and
reproductive health consequences including the risk of unintended pregnancy and HIV and other
sexually transmitted infections (Shireen et.al., 2003; Michael et.al., 2004; WHO, 2004).
The level of sexual coercion has now become a matter of concern not only to guidance
counselors, social workers but also those who are interested in the sexual reproductive health of
adolescents and children. The preponderance occurrence of sexual coercion is noticeable recently
by in Nigeria. Igbokure in Sunday Punch April 28, 2007 reported that some female students in
the primary and secondary schools protested to the then Minister of education Dr. (Mrs)
Ezekwesili over sexual harassment which they have been experiencing from their male teachers.
The students urged the minister to let the male teachers know that the students came to the
school to learn and not to be sexually harassed and intimated. Girls and women at all stages of
their lifes are often the victims of sexual coercion. However it seems much of sexual coercion in
Nigeria occurs to children and adolescents especially the females.
In many parts of the world, sexual coercion has been linked to risky sexual behavior, implying
that there may be common causal pathways in the psychological reaction to serious violations of

an individual’s integrity: The society believes that a male could force sex on female if he has
spent a lot of money on her. Even if the woman reports any violence, the society tends to blame
the female. It seems the economic crisis and poverty in Nigeria is making the female increasingly
vulnerable to sexual coercion and making them to unable to resist pressure from old men who
provide money and gift in exchange for sex. In some cases parents even force their female
children to marry people who offer them money even if the marriage is against the girl’s wish.
In Nigeria, as elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa, studies confirm that a large proportion of
adolescents have unmet reproductive health needs. Evidence of unmet need is reflected in the
fact that some adolescents and other young person’s lack adequate knowledge and understanding
of the reproductive process. Although, these researches have contributed to our understanding of
the reproductive health behavior of young people but Public concern over the reproductive health
problems among Nigerian youth is still drawing attention of researchers, non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) and policy makers to examine the driving force behind the upsurge in
adolescent sexual activity. The concern of this current research is to understand the patterns of
female adolescents sexual behaviours and experiences of sexual coercion.

METHODS
Study Area
The study was carried out in Osun State. The State of Osun has three senatorial districts namely
Osun Central, Osun West, and Osun East, each comprising 10 local government areas (LGAs)
(making 30 LGAs) and one area office, located in Osun East senatorial district. The 30 LGAs are
grouped into 18 rural and 12 urban LGAs. In the rural areas, majority of the inhabitants are
farmers while in the urban areas, they are mostly traders, artisans, cloth dyers, and civil servants,
hence having differing socio-economic status. The following Local Government area selected for
collection of data were: Osun Central: Orolu, Irepodun, Osun East: Ilesa east, Ilesa west, Osun
West: Ede north, Ede south

Study Design
This was a descriptive cross-sectional study, carried out among 1227 in-school female
adolescents in Osun State.
Target Population
All of the adolescents in the area were the target population. Eligible students were 15–19 years
old and who were presently enrolled in school.

Sample Size Determination
Sample size was determined using Fischer’s sample size formula as shown below:
Minimum sample size(n) = w2 x P x q

However, to increase representativeness in each of the senatorial districts and to improve the
quality of the work, the sample size was tripled which added up to 1227

Sampling Technique
Multi-stage sampling technique would be used.
Stage 1: Selection of six (6) Local Government Areas, two (2) from each of the three senatorial
districts in Osun State through simple random sampling (with balloting with replacement). The
following Local Government Areas were selected: Osun Central: Orolu, Irepodun, Osun East:
Ilesa east, Ilesa west,Osun West: Ede north, Ede south
Stage 2: Selection of a ward from each of the local government areas using simple random
sampling.
Stage 3: A list of Secondary schools in each local government was obtained from Osun State
Ministry of Education. Schools was selected at random; one from each of the wards in each local
government, selected.
Stage 4: From each the schools chosen, a proportionate sample was taken from each school by
systematic random sampling using the formula below:
Proportionate probability= No. of students in each school
aged 15-19 years

x Desired Sample size

Total number of the student in each school

Data Collection
The research instruments used were a pre-tested, semi-structured and self-administered
questionnaire containing both open and closed ended questions. The questionnaire had different
sections. The first section contained the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents,
the second section contained sexual behaviours and practice and the third section contained

knowledge of sexual and reproductive health issues. Data were collected by trained research
assistants and on different days of each school.
Data Management
Data were analysed using descriptive statistics such as frequency, percentages, mean, and
standard deviation with the use of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 21).
Level of significance was considered at p < 5% for all inferential statistics.
Ethical Considerations
Ethical approval was obtained from Joint University Of Ibadan/UCH Ethical Review Committee.
Administrative approval was also obtained from the principals of each school selected for the
study. Informed consent was obtained prior to the study. Participation in the study was voluntary
and the questionnaire was administered by trained research assistants only. Privacy and
confidentiality were ensured as the school teachers were not present during data collection, also,
only serial number was used on the information collected rather than a name. The nature and
purpose of the research and expectations from the students were duly explained to the students.

and mean age of 16.31±1.18 years. Table 1 shows that 33.7% of the respondent were from Osun
central while 33.3% and 33% of the participant were from Osun west and Osun east respectively.
The major religious affiliation among the respondent was Islam (73.1%), while (26.2%) was
Christian and (0.6%) were traditional worshipper. Most of the respondents (99.4%) were single
and only (0.6%) was married. Very Few (1.4%) of the respondents had a child and (98.6%) had
not given birth at all. Most of the father’s (65.3%) of the respondents were self-employed, while
(29.1%) and (5.6%) were employed and unemployed respectively. Majority of the mothers
(79.4%) of the respondents were self-employed while about (16.5%) and (4.2%) were employed
and unemployed respectively.
Most of the respondent’s parent (79.5%) lives together while only about (20.5%) do not live
together. More than half (52.2%) of the respondent were from a monogamous family while
(47.8%) were from polygamous family.
Figure 1 shows the prevalence of sexual exposure of the respondents. 337(27.5%) were sexually
exposed with a mean age of sexual debut 14.88±2.46 years.

Sexual Behaviours and Practice
Table 2 shows the sexual behaviours and practice among the respondents. 337(27.5%) were
sexually exposed with a mean age of sexual debut 14.88±2.46 years. Of the 337 that were
sexually exposed 153(56.5%) initiated sex early between the ages of 10-15 years while
118(43.5%) initiated sex late between the ages of (16-19), sixteen (4.7%) had uses drugs or take
alcohol before sexual intercourse while 315(95.3%) do not take alcohol before sexual
intercourse.
Among those who those who had sex in the last 12 months preceding the study, 250(81.2%) had
only one sexual partner, 37(12%) had two partners, 5(1.6%) had 5 partners, 7(2.3%) had four
partners, 8(2.6%) and 1(0.3) had five partners and six partners respectively. Among respondents

birth control pills to prevent pregnancy, 88(7.2%) used condoms, 17(1.4%) used withdrawal
method and 17(1.4%) used other methods to prevent pregnancy.
Most of the respondents (94%) had not been pregnant, while 67 (5.8%) of the respondent had
been pregnant once and 2(0.2%) twice. Of the 69 respondent who had pregnancy, 23(2%) gave
birth, 19(1.6%) had abortion, 15(1.3%) had miscarriage and only 12(1%) were currently

DISCUSSION
In this study socio-demographic characteristic of the participants showed that majority of the
respondents were Muslims. All the respondents were aged between 15-19 years. Adolescent
stage is a transition period to adulthood which is linked with series of issues that affect their
body, behavior and social interactions (Duru et.al., 2010; Omobuwa et.al., 2012). The
behaviours that are acquired during this transition period have great implications for their health
and wellbeing and also they are likely to have proclivity for sexual experimentation and most of
them initiate sexual activity during this period (Cherie and Berhane, 2012).
The findings of this study revealed that (27.5 %) of the respondents had had sexual intercourse
before. This is in agreement with the findings by Asekun-Olarinmoye et al, in Osun State,
Nigeria who reported that 27.6% of the in-school adolescents studied were sexually exposed
(Asekun-Olarinmoye et.al.,2011) and Moharson-Bello et al. who reported 28.3% in a study
carried out in Ibadan, Nigeria (Moharson-Bello et.al.2008).
In this study, the prevalence of sexually exposed adolescents is higher than the 13.0% reported
among adolescents in Northeastern Nigeria (Ajuwon et.al., 2006) and South Africa (Peltzer,
2006). Higher prevalence rates were reported in studies by Slap et al. who reported 34% in
Plateau State (Slap et.al.,2003), Owolabi et al. who reported 63% in Osun State (Owolabi et.al.,
2005) and Olugbenga-Bello et al. who reported 31.5% also in Osun State, Nigeria (OlugbengaBello et.al., 2009). This variation in the proportion of adolescents who have been involved in
sexual intercourse agrees with the findings in a review of studies on the sexual behavior of
school students in sub-Saharan Africa with Nigeria inclusive, the prevalence of first sex was
reported to vary from 3% to 93% (kaaya et.al.,2002). This variation may be due to the different
values attached to the issue of adolescent sexuality by different people and people.
The mean age at sexual at first sexual intercourse was 14.88±2.46 years, this is similar to the
findings by (Duru et.al., 2010 and Olugbenga-Bello et.al., 2009) who reported mean ages at
sexual debut of 15.08±0.2, 15.2±1 years respectively in Nigeria. Other studies by (Masatu et.al.,
2009; Chartsbin, 2008) conducted among in-school adolescents in Tanzania showed mean age at
sexual debut to be 14.6 and 15.5 years respectively.

The major reasons for sexual exposure was pressure of partner/boyfriend and self-desire, this
agrees with (Kora and Haile 2007) who noted that the most common reasons for youths
experimenting sex before their 18th birth day include personal desire and peer pressure.
Of those that had sexual intercourse in the last 12 month preceding the study, about 19% of the
respondents had had sexual intercourse with more one partner, and 10.6% had received money,
school fees, shelter, others (such as different types of gifts) in exchange for sex. 4.7% out of the
27.5% that had had sexual exposure took drugs/alcohol before sex. This pattern of high risky
behaviours has been well established by precious studies, though the findings vary from place to
place.
A finding in Osun state by (Olugbenga-Bello et.al., 2009) found that 14.6% of the secondary
school students surveyed had more than one sexual partner while another study found out in
Osun state that of the sexually active students that were surveyed, 48.4% had multiple sexual
partners (Asekun-Olarinmoye et.al.,2011). Also a study carried out among secondary schools
student in Ilorin, Kwara state found out that 24.2% of the respondents had received gifts in
exchange for sex, while 45% had more than one sexual partner. This high levels of risky sexual
behavior have made adolescents particularly vulnerable to and at risk of STI and HIV infections,
and hence, the reason why evidenced-based interventions should be directed at this age group.
From this study, out of those who had had sexual exposure, it is something of concern that just
only (15.4%) used condom for the last sexual experience and this is similar with other findings
that reported this poor preventive culture among adolescents. In a study conducted in Osogbo,
Southwestern Nigeria, it was found that less than a third of the sexually active adolescents used
condoms by (Olugbenga-Bello et.al., 2009) and while Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey
reported that among young people that had sexual intercourse in the 12 months preceding the
survey, 94.5% of male adolescents had high-risk intercourse and only 36.3% of them used
condom (NDHS, 2008).

This low rate of condom use among respondents may be due to poor comprehensive knowledge
about contraception, STIs and related issues among adolescents (Olugbenga-Bello et.al., 2010;
Asekun-Olarinmoye et.al.,2011; Oyo-Ita et.al., 2005).

Teenage pregnancy is one of the most unfavorable and usually unplanned outcomes of
adolescent sexual activity. In this study about 6% of the respondents had been pregnant, this is a
little higher than the findings of (Olugbenga-Bello et.al., 2014) in Osun state that found that
4.3% had been pregnant, while the majority of those who had been pregnant gave birth and had
had an abortion. Having an abortion has a lot of implications for reproductive health including
septic abortions, damage to reproductive organs, blood borne infections, uterine perforations, and
mortality. In addition, having a baby while in school may lead to school drop-out, and reduced
opportunities to continue schooling, poor cohesion among families, rejection by the family and
society, lower education, early marriage, and soaring fertility.

CONCLUSION
Finding from this study is consistent with earlier studies conducted in many other Nigerian cities
which showed that in-school adolescents to be sexually active. In fact, one can conclude from
this study that at least one out of every four in-school adolescents in Osun state is sexually active
and most engaged in unsafe sexual practices, therefore, this makes them vulnerable to various
medical complications including STIs, HIV/AIDS and genital cancers. There is the need to step
up campaigns to address this noticed lapse in behavior among the students in order to arrest the
usual consequences of such risky sexual behavior. Interventions including peer education,
training of teacher's and development of youth friendly centers are recommended to meet the
reproductive health needs of adolescents
