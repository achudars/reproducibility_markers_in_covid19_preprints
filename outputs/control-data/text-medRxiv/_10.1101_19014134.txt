ABSTRACT
Background:
The Cochrane Collaboration has been publishing systematic reviews in the Cochrane
Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) since 1995, with the intention that these be
updated periodically.
Objectives:
To chart the long-term updating history of a cohort of Cochrane reviews and the
impact on the number of included studies.
Methods:
The status of a cohort of Cochrane reviews updated in 2003 was assessed at three
time points: 2003, 2011, and 2018. We assessed their subject scope, compiled their
publication history using PubMed and CDSR, and compared them to all Cochrane
reviews available in 2002 and 2017/18.
Results:
Of the 1,532 Cochrane reviews available in 2002, 11.3% were updated in 2003, with
16.6% not updated between 2003 and 2011. The reviews updated in 2003 were not
markedly different to other reviews available in 2002, but more were retracted or
declared stable by 2011 (13.3% versus 6.3%). The 2003 update led to a major
change of the conclusions of 2.8% of updated reviews (n = 177). The cohort had a
median time since publication of the first full version of the review of 18 years and a
median of three updates by 2018 (range 1–11). The median time to update was
three years (range 0–14 years). By the end of 2018, the median time since the last
update was seven years (range 0–15). The median number of included studies rose
from eight in the version of the review before the 2003 update, to 10 in that update
and 14 in 2018 (range 0–347).
Conclusions:
Most Cochrane reviews get updated, however they are becoming more out-of-date
over time. Updates have resulted in an overall rise in the number of included
studies, although they only rarely lead to major changes in conclusion.

Background
Systematic reviews use explicit formal methods to identify and analyse studies on
specific research questions, and synthesise the findings of these studies. (1)
Reviews’ findings can become outdated if they are overtaken by new studies or data,
missing studies or errors in the review or included studies are identified, or
methodology improves in critical ways. In a 2007 paper, Shojania et al reported on
the need for updates in 100 systematic reviews from 1995 to 2005. (2) They
concluded that around half may have been out-of-date, with a signal for required
updating within two years of the evidence search in 11% of reviews. The median
period without a signal suggesting a need to update was 5.5 years (95% confidence
interval (CI), 4.6 to 7.6 years).
The intention to keep reviews up-to-date was a cornerstone of the Cochrane
Collaboration. Named for Archie Cochrane, this international network aimed to
achieve a goal he articulated by filling the need for: “a critical summary, by specialty
or subspecialty, adapted periodically, of all relevant randomized controlled trials”.
(3) The Cochrane Collaboration began publishing systematic reviews of the effects
of healthcare interventions based on clinical trials in the Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews (CDSR) in 1995. (4) Its organisers wrote in an introductory
brochure in the 1990s that evidence reviews “must be prepared systematically and
they must be kept up-to-date to take account of new evidence”. (5) A Cochrane
review, they wrote, “is updated and amended as new evidence becomes available
and errors are identified”.
The original expectation was that reviews would be updated at least annually, but in
2000 it was agreed that this was unsustainable, (6) and the expected update interval
was changed to every two years, unless a reason was given for a different schedule.
(7) However, this also proved to be unsustainable, and in 2016 the organisation
moved towards updating by perceived need or priority, preparing a consensus
document on updating systematic reviews. (8) With the publication of a revision of
the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Cochrane Handbook)
in 2019, there is no longer any default interval at which Cochrane reviews are
judged to be out of date, and the possibility of retracting reviews deemed outdated
will cease. (9)
Cochrane reviews are the result of a unique large-scale and long-term effort to stay
systematically up-to-date with health and social care evidence across a broad
spectrum of topics. This collection of reviews also provides an opportunity to study
the practice of systematic reviewing and growth of evidence across time.
We assembled a cohort of Cochrane reviews, comprising all the reviews flagged as
updated in the CDSR in 2003, and assessed these across 15 years at three time
points: 2003, 2011, and 2018. The aims of our study were to describe the cohort of
updated reviews in relation to all other Cochrane reviews that were available at the

end of 2002 and, in 2011 and around 2018. We also charted and followed up on the
updating history of the 2003 update cohort. We assessed how often the 2003
updates led to a major change in reviews’ conclusions. In addition, we charted the
growth in the number of included studies in the reviews over time.

Methods
Study aim 1: Describe the cohort of reviews in the CDSR updated in 2003 in relation to
all Cochrane reviews available at the end of 2002, 2011, and around 2018.
The cohort was established in 2003 by searching each of the four issues of the CDSR
published that year for reviews flagged as updated. The issue(s) in which each
review was flagged as updated was recorded.
(a) Subject scope.
Systematic reviews in different subject areas might become outdated more quickly
than others. (2) Cochrane reviews are produced and maintained by editorial groups
called Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs). These cover one or more subject areas, and
have their own editorial policies. Differences in editorial practice could also affect
updating. The number of CRGs grew throughout the early years of the Collaboration,
with some merging in later years.
In order to gauge how similar in subject and editorial scope the 2003 cohort reviews
might be to Cochrane reviews overall, we compared the spread of reviews among
CRGS. A list of CRGs in 2019 was collected from the Cochrane website. (10) The
names of the CRGs in each year from 1995 to 2002 were collected using the Internet
Archive, (11) from a combination of archived issues of Cochrane News (12) and the
Cochrane website. (13) The original CRG names were retained, and also normalised
to the current CRG name, and mergers of groups were noted.
The CRG base for each of the reviews in the cohort was collected, noting where CRGs
which have since been merged into another CRG. We compared the number of CRGs
represented in the cohort with the number of CRGs in 2002 and 2019.
To compare the subject mix of the 2003 cohort with current Cochrane review
production and maintenance, we gathered the number of new and updated reviews
by CRG from the online Cochrane Library, collecting data for both 2017 and 2018 to
reduce the impact of annual fluctuations. As the search function does not enable
separation of new and updated reviews, the totals of new and updated reviews from
2017 to 2018 were collected from the dashboards on Cochrane’s website. (14)
(b) Likelihood of being updated.

In 2011, data was collected to enable comparison of updating history between the
2003 cohort and other Cochrane reviews. In the time since 2003, the CDSR had
moved from publication on CD-ROM to online publication, and had a change of
publisher. (4,15) It became apparent that many previous versions of Cochrane
reviews were no longer published in the CDSR and so we used PubMed to establish a
cohort of reviews that had been published in the CDSR by the end of 2002,
supplemented by a search of CDSR for reviews still dated pre-2003. The number of
reviews that had been published by the end of 2002 was available from another
project, (16) but that did not provide identifiers for those reviews.
In 2011, the status of each review that had been available in 2002 was identified
using both PubMed and the latest version in the CDSR. There were three possible
status designations of Cochrane reviews in 2011 at that time: ongoing, designated
stable (no further update required), or withdrawn. Which of these had been applied
to each review was recorded. As some of the reviews were no longer included in the
CDSR without any withdrawal notice, we assigned that as a fourth category. The
CDSR is unusual in having a large number of records withdrawn that could mean
either the publication is out of date or that it “contains a major error”, and the
reason for withdrawal is not routinely stated. (7) Another journal that also
withdraws out-of-date publications classifies these all as retracted. (17) Opinions
about whether all CDSR withdrawals constitute retractions vary. (18–20) In this
study, the categories withdrawn and no longer included without notice were
classified together as retracted.
Both PubMed and CDSR were used to establish whether the reviews had been
updated between 2003 and 2011. Dates of updates were defined as the date of
publication of a new citation version of the review, and date of search or
incorporation of new data if no new cited version was published. When a version of
a review involved only a software update, we did not count this as an update.
To compare updating and status between the reviews available in 2002 which had,
and had not, been updated in 2003, we analysed the rate of ongoing, stable, and
retracted reviews. We also analysed the proportions of ongoing reviews that had
not been updated since 2002, those which were updated in 2003 only, and those
which had been updated at least once between 2004 and 2011.
Study aim 2: Describe the updating history of the cohort, major changes in conclusions
in 2003, and the growth of included studies over time.
All reviews flagged as updated in 2003 were collected. To assess the changes to the
reviews’ conclusions, one author (HB) assessed all of these updates, and another
(JD) assessed those published as updates in two of the four issues of the CDSR. Both
authors agreed on a final group of reviews that had a major change in their
conclusions following the update.

The first follow-up of the 2003 cohort of reviews was done in 2011. Using the first
issue of CDSR in that year (published in April), the number of years from the
review’s last reported search for eligible studies to April 2011 was recorded. After
publication of the fourth and final issue of the CDSR for 2011, as complete as
possible an updating history of the 2003 cohort was assembled. For each review in
the cohort, PubMed was searched for previous records of the review. The version of
the review published in issue 4 of 2011 was reviewed for information about updates
in the three parts of the review that were expected to report the review’s history:
What’s New, history, and notes. (21) As practice in what constituted an update had
changed since 2003, two types of events were recorded as updates: the year of
publication of a new citation of a version of the review in PubMed, and the year
reported in the review for an update search or incorporation of new data even if no
new cited version was published.
In March 2019, we added the year for each update from 2012 to the end of 2018.
This was again based on PubMed searches and the information recorded in the
reviews’ What’s New, history, and notes sections. In addition, we added the year the
review was first published and the most recent PubMed identifier for the review.
This final data collection for the 2003 cohort alone included an assessment of the
status of these reviews at the end of 2018, using the same categories as previously.
However, we added a category for 2018: republished after previous retraction. For
reviews that were stable, retracted, or republished after previous retraction, we
recorded the years of these events.
When we originally identified reviews as updated in 2003, we recorded the number
of studies included in that update, as well as the number included in the prior issue
of the review. For one review, the updated version of the review was the only one
available for assessment. We subsequently recorded the number of included studies
in the versions of each review at the end of 2011 and the end of 2018.
Data management and analysis
One author (HB) undertook all data collection, curation, and visualisation. Data for
the first collection in 2003 was originally recorded in document tables, and added to
an Excel spreadsheet in 2019. All other collections were recorded in Excel. Data was
analysed using RStudio 1.1463 running R 3.5.2. (9) Packages tidyverse and (24)
reshape2 (25) were used for analyses and data visualisation. Summary statistics
were used to describe the cohort. Data for this project, including analytic code, are
available at Github. (26)

Results
2003 cohort in perspective: subject scope.
We identified 1,532 Cochrane reviews via PubMed and the CDSR that were available
at the end of 2002. This was fewer than the number reported by the Cochrane
Collaboration since the beginning of the CDSR in 1995 (1,558). (16) Some reviews
had been indexed in PubMed after 2002 (n = 13), and this is likely to be the case for
more of the shortfall of 26 reviews. Other reviews may have been retracted prior to
the indexing of the CDSR in PubMed in 2000. (15) A total of 177 reviews were
flagged as updated in the CDSR in 2003. As the first version of four of these was also
published in 2003, the update rate in 2003 of 1,532 reviews indexed in PubMed to
the end of 2002 was 11.3%.
There were 49 Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs) with editorial responsibility for
Cochrane reviews in 2002, compared with 53 in 2019. Table 1 shows the rise in the
number of CRGs between 1995 and 2002, as well as annual review production based
on Cochrane-supplied data and the years of first publication of the 173 reviews in
the update cohort reviews that had been published by the end of 2002. CRGs had a
median of two reviews updated in 2003, ranging from none to 27 (interquartile
range (IQR): 3).

Only four CRGs had been in existence for less than four years in 2002, and 19 were
no more than five years old. At that time annual updating of Cochrane reviews was
expected, but only 42 of the 49 CRGs (85.7%) flagged reviews as updated in 2003,
and only 11.3% of the reviews published by the end of 2002 were updated during
2003.
To gauge how similar the subject scope of reviews in the 2003 update cohort are to
the current subject scope of Cochrane reviews, we compared the spread of reviews
among CRGs in the 2003 update cohort with the spread of new and updated reviews
published in 2017/18 (Table 2). The CDSR does not enable breaking these down
into new and updated reviews but the 2017/2018 totals reported in Cochrane
dashboards online show that 44.8% of these reviews were updates. (14) (The
dashboards report fewer total new and updated reviews for 2017/2018: 1,353
versus 1,369 returned by CDSR search).

Cochrane reviews in the 2003 update cohort were distributed across a narrower
range of CRGs, and therefore topic areas, than the new and updated reviews in
2017/18 (Table 2). The extent of this shift is illustrated in the case of the oldest
CRGs. Of the 18 CRGs that had formed by 1995, two later merged. Those 17 CRGs
were responsible for 57.6% of the 2003 update cohort (102 of 177 reviews), and
48.0% of the new and updated reviews in 2017/18 (657 of 1,369 reviews). The
individual CRGs, based on their 2019 names and grouping, are shown with their
proportion of reviews in both time periods in Figure 1.

at least once between 2003 and 2011. The retracted reviews included those with a
withdrawal notice as well as six reviews that were no longer in the CDSR, with no
record to explain their absence.

The proportion of 2002 Cochrane reviews that were ongoing in 2011 and had been
updated at least once between 2004 and 2011 was high, whether they had been
updated in 2003 (85.3%) or not (81.4%), suggesting that the 2003 update cohort is
not markedly different to the other 2002 reviews in regard to subsequent updating
over the following eight years. However, the 2003 cohort had higher rates of
retraction and being declared stable than other reviews from 2002 by 2011 (13.3%
versus 6.3%). By 2019, the overall rate of non-retracted Cochrane reviews being
declared stable was 6.6% [Chapter 4], compared with 6.8% for our 2003 update
cohort (11 of 161 non-retracted reviews). In regard to the number of included
studies, the 2003 update cohort include two reviews with no included studies in
2011 (1.1%), which was a lower proportion than Yaffe et al found for all Cochrane
reviews in 2010 (8.7%). (27)

Updating history of the 2003 update cohort from publication to 2018.
The reviews in the 2003 cohort were first published as full Cochrane reviews
between 1995 and 2003, with a median time since first publication of 18 years by
the end of 2018 (range: 15 to 23 years; IQR 3) (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Years since first publication of reviews to the end of 2018 (n = 177).

From first publication until 2018, the median number of updates per review was

Among the 177 reviews in the 2003 update cohort, 150 were ongoing in 2018: the
other 27 were either retracted (n = 15) or designated stable (n = 12). One review
had been retracted in 2010, but was updated and republished the following year,
and is included among the 150 ongoing reviews.
The median time to each update of these reviews was three years (Table 4). The
shortest was zero in the case of the first update, as some reviews were updated
during the year they were published. The longest interval between updates was 14
years between the first and second updates of one review.

Impact of updating over time.
In 2003, the updating of a review resulted in major changes to its conclusions for
five reviews (2.8%). We compared the number of included studies in the updated
review with the number in its prior version (excluding one review had been
retracted without leaving a copy of the original review in CDSR, leading to a single
missing baseline value). Some updates did not lead to the inclusion of further
studies, but the number of included studies grew substantially over time (median: 8
from the version before the 2003 update to 14 in the version of the review at the
end of 2018) (Figure 5).

Discussion
Our study describes the updating history over 15 years of a cohort of 177 Cochrane
reviews that were first updated in 2003. For most of this period, the Cochrane
updating policy was a recommended two-year interval until a review was regarded
as out of date. By that measure, reviews in this cohort could be considered out of
date for more than half of their publication life. However, in another study Shojania
et al concluded that the median life of a systematic review before it became outsided
was 5.5 years (CI, 4.6 to 7.6 years), based on a sample of 100 systematic reviews. As
the median time between updates for the Cochrane reviews in our 2003 update
cohort was three years, most of this cohort were likely to be up-to-date most of the
time.
However, this cohort has been getting more out of date over time. The median time
to first update was three years, but by the end of 2018, more than half the reviews
were more than seven years since their last update (range 0–15 years). This is
reflective of Cochrane reviews more generally, as more new reviews are published
than updated and the legacy of existing reviews now exceeds 8,000. If indeed the
interval between review updates continues to increase in the long term, or more
and more reviews are never updated, up-to-date Cochrane reviews will become the
exception, not the rule.
Until recently, Cochrane policy allowed for withdrawing a review from publication
when it was seriously out of date. This resulted in a high retraction rate for our
cohort (6.9%), relative to its fellow Cochrane reviews that were not updated in 2003
(4.3%). With the introduction of a new update classification system that aims to
phase out the withdrawal of outdated reviews, (28) the retraction rate in future is
likely to be considerably lower. The proportion of reviews showing as apparently
current in the CDSR but which are seriously outdated will be correspondingly
higher.
Our cohort had a higher rate of updates than other Cochrane reviews from the early
2000s. In addition, they included a particularly low rate of “empty” reviews in 2011
(1.1% without included studies) compared to the 8.7% rate Yaffe et al reported for
all Cochrane reviews in 2010. (27) In our study, the median number of included
studies prior to the 2003 update was eight. Mallett and Clarke reported that the
median number of included studies in all Cochrane reviews at the beginning of 2001
was six. (29) The 2019 Cochrane Handbook advises authors of reviews to consider,
among other things, whether new eligible studies are likely to be found before
deciding to update. (9) Our results are consistent with Cochrane groups already
concentrating updating effort on research questions that were generating new
studies.
Our results for the earlier years are similar to the results from studies with shorter
follow-up than ours. We identified 13 other studies of updating in Cochrane reviews

or protocols that addressed some similar outcomes (overview in Appendix). (30–
42) Mean or median times to updates were comparable to those in our study. Our
finding that a major change in conclusion after update is rare (2.8%) is also
consistent with others’ results. Jaidee et al found a 2.0% rate of major changes in
their conclusions at the first update of 101 Cochrane reviews. (39) Bashir et al found
a 3.9% change in their conclusions in 8 out of 204 reviews with a meta-analysis for a
primary outcome. (42) The highest rate was found by French et al, (34) who found a
9.1% change in review conclusions in 23 out of 254 reviews, but these changes were
not necessarily major.
There have been two studies with similar analyses of updating non-Cochrane
evidence syntheses. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
reported on updating of their systematic review-based clinical practice guidelines.
(43) For 11 guidelines, the median time to update was 5.3 years (range: 3.3 to 6.5
years), with major changes in recommendations in six of them. Peterson et al
studied 41 comparative effectiveness reviews of drugs, finding a median time to
update of just over two years. (44)
Our study has several important strengths, particularly its long-term follow-up and
open data that could enable others to extend this longitudinal study. The collection
of cross-sections of data in 2003, 2011, and 2017/2018 was valuable. By
maintaining a historical collection of data and using PubMed as well as the CDSR, we
established that the updating and version history of Cochrane reviews in the CDSR
has important gaps. While most older versions of reviews are online in the CDSR,
some complete reviews and some update versions of reviews have been removed
from the CDSR without leaving any public record other than PubMed. Some updated
versions of Cochrane reviews were never submitted to PubMed. In some cases this
may be in error, but it may also be a matter of policy. (7) This has left no complete
public record of all Cochrane reviews, their updates, versions, and retractions. Not
submitting updates for indexing at PubMed has critical implications for searches:
reviews with misleadingly older dates will not be retrieved by searches that are
limited to more recent records.
The inadequate historical record was one of the limitations of our study. We also
relied on manual collection of data and quality assurance by a single author. In
assessing the growth of included studies, we did not collect data on eligible studies
awaiting inclusion and we do not know if this would have affected our results.
Our study raises some issues for Cochrane and others to consider. We could find the
date of last search clearly reported in 92.7% of the reviews in 2011. In a study
published in 2013, Beller et al found that only 90.0% of a sample of systematic
reviews from PubMed reported the date of last search. (45) The availability of that
date is critical for users to assess the currency of evidence and the adequacy of
overlapping periods in update searches.

In 2002, Koch drew attention to the poor quality of update reporting in Cochrane
reviews, (31) and we found this to be an ongoing problem. Contributing factors
include missing versions of Cochrane reviews in the CDSR, and reviews not carrying
forward events from “What’s New” and other notes sections into the history of each
subsequent version of the review as Cochrane advises. (7) Automation of that
process could improve this situation.
A further critical gap is the lack of reporting of searches undertaken before it is
determined that an update is needed. Although searches that found no new studies
were generally reported as updates to the reviews in early years when annual or
two-yearly updates were expected, these are no longer as visible. (8,9)
Transparency of this element of updating activity is important for users, including
other systematic reviewers and producers of clinical practice guidelines and health
information generally. A survey of health organisations producing systematic
reviews (and often clinical practice guidelines) by Garritty et al in 2010 had 114
respondents (30% of them from Cochrane). Only eight of the organisations did not
have any updating activity, but resources for updating for those that did were
stretched, and the groups regarded too many of their reviews as too far out of date.
Sharing the results of searches is critical in this context to prevent large numbers of
groups using resources on the same futile searches.
In 2010, two of us advocated that major changes were needed to keep up with the
evidence, given the massive rise in clinical trials and increasing complexity of
systematic review methods, with constrained resources. (16) Prioritisation of
systematic reviews, reduction of avoidable waste, and “leaner and more efficient
methods of staying up-to-date” were stressed. Since then, the rise in clinical trials
has escalated: ClinicalTrials.gov amassed over 96,000 trials in its first decade to
2010, and the total nearly doubled in the next five years. (46,47) It now stands at
over 320,000 (as of November 2019).
Progress in streamlining methods and avoiding waste are not moving as fast.
Methodological expectations for Cochrane reviews have increased, (9,48) and trial
registry entries have been added to Cochrane’s trial database as the organization
grapples with the implications of incorporating unpublished trials and data. (49)
There has, however, been a concerted effort to develop and implement methods for
prioritisation of updating for Cochrane reviews. (8) With this transition to targeted
updating, new questions about processes and impact need to be tackled. Are the
right systematic reviews being updated? Are people being harmed by reliance on
outdated systematic reviews?
