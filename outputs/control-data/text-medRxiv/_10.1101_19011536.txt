Abstract
Background We aimed to examine evidence for a causal effect of overall and abdominal
adiposity on carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR).
Methods The exposure included genetic instruments comprising independent variants associated
with body mass index (BMI) (n=322,154), a proxy for overall adiposity, and waist-hip ratio
adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI) (n=210,082), a proxy for abdominal adiposity. Associations of
these variants with CTS were obtained from a genome-wide association study (GWAS)
conducted in UK Biobank (12,312 CTS cases / 389,344 controls). Causal effects were estimated
using inverse-variance weighted regression and conventional MR sensitivity analyses were
conducted to assess for horizontal pleiotropy. In follow-up analyses we determined whether type
2 diabetes (T2D) or hyperlipidemia mediated the observed effects.
Results A 1-standard deviation (SD, ~4.7kg/m2) increase in genetically instrumented BMI
increased the risk of CTS (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.48-2.02, p=2.68e-12), with consistent effects
across sensitivity analyses. This effect translates to an absolute increase of 17 CTS cases per
1000 person years amongst US working populations [95% CI 11.0-23.5]. Univariable MR was
consistent with a causal effect of T2D (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03-1.11, p=5.20e-05), and the effect
of BMI was partially attenuated (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.38-1.68, p=2.85e-08) when controlling for
T2D liability in multivariable MR. In contrast, no effect was observed of WHRadjBMI on CTS
(OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.74-1.33, p=0.83).
Conclusion These data support a causal effect of overall adiposity on susceptibility to CTS that
is only partially mediated through T2D, suggesting that efforts to reduce obesity may mitigate
the population burden of CTS.

Key messages
-

A one-standard deviation increase in body mass index, a proxy for overall adiposity,
increased risk of carpal tunnel by 73%. In contrast, no effect of waist-to-hip ratio adjusted
for BMI, a proxy for abdominal adiposity, was observed on risk of carpal tunnel
syndrome.

-

The effects of BMI on carpal tunnel syndrome risk were partially attenuated when
accounting for mediation through type 2 diabetes, suggesting that the majority of the
causal effect operates independently of diabetes risk.

-

These data suggest that efforts to reduce rates of obesity could reduce the incidence of
carpal tunnel syndrome.

Introduction
Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common entrapment neuropathy, with an estimated
prevalence ranging from 1-5%1. CTS accounts for a large proportion of lost work time related to
disabling injuries, and medical care for CTS has been estimated to cost more than $2 billion
annually2. In light of this clinical and economic burden of disease, efforts have been made to
delineate factors contributing to risk of CTS3.

Elevated body-mass index (BMI), a proxy for overall adiposity4, has consistently emerged as a
modifiable risk factor for CTS3,5. A meta-analysis of 58 observational studies related obesity to a
doubling in odds of CTS, and a 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI to an adjusted odds ratio of 1.076.
Associations were also observed of waist circumference with CTS, suggesting additional
contributions of abdominal adiposity. However, given the observational nature of these studies, it
is unclear whether the association of BMI with CTS is causal7. For instance, BMI is strongly
influenced by underlying health conditions such as hypothyroidism8, which may confound the
relationship of obesity with CTS. Understanding causality has important clinical implications for
the prevention of morbidity associated with CTS, as well as for reducing the population burden
of work-related disability and healthcare costs.

Some of the limitations to observational research may be overcome by an instrumental variable
method termed ‘Mendelian randomization’ (MR)9. MR uses genetic variants as proxies for
epidemiologic exposures to test for causal effects on outcomes. This method leverages the
random assortment of genetic variants at gametogenesis which, at the population level,
randomizes individuals to different levels of any given heritable exposure. This substantially

reduces confounding and minimizes the impact of reverse causality7,10. To date, no MR study has
examined potential causality between adiposity and CTS. We thus aimed to leverage MR to
determine whether effects of overall adiposity (proxied through BMI) and abdominal adiposity
(proxied through waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI) were causally linked to CTS. We further
assessed the extent to which these effects were explained by the metabolic consequences of
adiposity, including diabetes and hyperlipidemia.

Methods
Exposure datasets
The genetic instrumental variable comprised genetic variants relating to BMI and WHRadjBMI.
Associations of these variants with the phenotypes were obtained from genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) conducted by the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT)
consortium on participants of European ancestry. For BMI, this comprised a meta-analysis across
80 cohorts, collectively contributing data on up to 322,154 participants of European ancestry11.
For WHRadjBMI, this comprised a meta-analysis across 101 cohorts, collectively contributing
data on up to 210,088 participants of European ancestry12. The effects in both studies are
provided in relation to a 1-standard deviation (SD) increase in the respective adiposity measures.
For BMI, this represents a 4.7 kg/m2 increase, which approximately represents the transition
from overweight to obesity13. For WHR, this represents a change of 0.08 units. Both genetic
instruments have been shown to strongly associate with BMI and WHRadjBMI in independent
cohorts14,15.

The outcome data source was a GWAS of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) conducted using the
population-based UK Biobank (UKB) cohort. Extensive details of UKB have been previously
reported16. In short, approximately 500,000 participants were recruited across 22 assessment
centers from 2006-2010. At baseline assessment, the volunteers completed a standardized
questionnaire and interview with a study nurse, and blood was collected for genotyping. Cases of
CTS were defined as participants meeting any of the following criteria: self-reported history of
CTS, ICD-10 code for CTS, operation code for carpal tunnel release or revision of carpal tunnel
release, and self-reported history of carpal tunnel surgery. In total, 12,312 CTS cases and
389,344 controls of White British ancestry with suitable genetic data were identified for analysis.
The contribution of each data source to the total case count is given in Supplementary Table 1 of
the GWAS17, with the primary ICD-10 code G560 contributing the greatest number of cases
(n=9,139). GWAS was conducted using BOLT-LMM to account for relatedness within the UKB
cohort, with LMM beta coefficients converted to log-odds using the prevalence of CTS in
UKB17.

Data harmonization and power calculation
Using raw summary statistics files, we extracted variants associated with BMI and WHRadjBMI
at genome-wide significance (p < 5e-08, representing a Bonferonni correction for all independent
comparisons across the genome). This threshold is selected to satisfy the assumption of MR that
the instrument is strongly associated with the exposure. Moreover, this threshold approximately
corresponds to an F-statistic of 30, which is greater than the F-statistic cutoff of 10 to mitigate
weak instrument bias7,18. From this variant list, we identified variants also present in the CTS
GWAS that could be matched on the basis of allele frequency (using the ‘harmonise_data’

function in the TwoSampleMR package). To generate a set of independent genetic variants, we
clumped this set of variants at an R2 (measure of linkage disequilibrium) of 0.001 using the 1000
Genomes European reference panel (using the ‘clump_data’ function in the TwoSampleMR
package).

Power was calculated using the mRnd power calculator (http://cnsgenomics.com/shiny/mRnd/).
We utilized previously described methods for calculating percent variance explained using
summarized data19. Notably, the percent variance explained of the genetic instrument relates to
the power, but not validity, of the MR analysis.

Primary MR analyses
To obtain an estimate of the causal effect of the adiposity exposures on CTS, we regressed the
SNP-outcome associations on the SNP-exposure associations, and weighted the effects by the
inverse of the variance (IVW) in the SNP-outcome association under a random-effects model20
(utilizing the ‘mr_ivw’ function in the TwoSampleMR package). Heterogeneity was assessed
using Cochran’s Q. We compared the genetically instrumented effects of BMI to previously
reported observational estimates6 using a formal test of heterogeneity. We converted effect
estimates to absolute risk increases using the following equation15: absolute risk increase = (OR1)*absolute incidence. Incidence estimates were obtained from a pooled analysis of US working
populations, as part of the upper-extremity musculoskeletal disorder consortium (23 CTS cases
per 1000 person-years21).

To determine whether any observed associations were mediated through hyperlipidemia or T2D,
both putative risk factors for CTS22,23, we first tested for associations of these risk factors with
CTS. Association statistics for T2D were obtained from a GWAS meta-analysis of 26,676 T2D
cases and 132,532 controls of European ancestry24. Consistent with prior work, the effect of
diabetes liability on CTS was scaled to represent a doubling in the odds of diabetes25.
Associations with low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and
triglycerides were obtained from GWAS conducted by the Global Lipid Genetics Consortium
(GLGC, n~180,000). Associations identified in univariable MR, were followed by
multivariable26 MR to determine whether the effect of BMI was attenuated when controlling for
the putative mediator (i.e. T2D). This regression was fit with both exposures simultaneously
using the default parameters in the TwoSampleMR ‘mv_multiple’ function. As previously
recommended for multivariable MR analyses of dichotomous outcomes in MR27, we report the
total (unadjusted) and direct (adjusted) effects of BMI, but not the indirect effect.

Model-based sensitivity analyses
The strongest assumption made in an MR analysis is the absence of horizontal pleiotropy, where
genetic variants influence the outcome through pathways independent of the exposure of interest.
We therefore conducted a range of model-based sensitivity analyses that produce valid estimates
under weaker assumptions. In concordance with prior recommendations, we only conducted
these sensitivity analyses when conventional univariable MR provided evidence of a causal
effect28. Technical details of the assumptions made in these models can be found in their
respective reports. These models included: robust, heterogeneity-penalized IVW analysis, MR
Egger29, the weighted median estimator30, the robust adjusted profile score (RAPS)31, and a

recently developed Bayesian weighted MR (BWMR) method32. In addition to producing an
effect estimate, the MR Egger intercept provides a measure of unbalanced horizontal pleiotropy.
Finally, we utilized the Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MRPRESSO) method to detect and remove potentially pleiotropic variants33. Given the varying
assumptions regarding pleiotropy in these models, we considered consistent effects across the
sensitivity analyses to greatly strengthen evidence for causality.

Non-model-based sensitivity analyses
We conducted three additional non-model-based sensitivity analyses to assess the causal effect of
BMI on CTS. First, we re-estimated associations after removing the highly pleiotropic variant in
the ‘Fat mass and obesity-associated protein’ (FTO) gene34. To further examine confounding, we
utilized the PhenoScanner35 database to identify genetic variants associating with height17 or with
grip strength at p < 1e-05 (default setting), and re-estimated IVW associations after removing
those variants. Height was selected on the basis of evidence that height causally impacts CTS in
prior MR analyses17. Grip strength was selected as a proxy for lean mass to mitigate confounding
of adiposity by muscle mass. Finally, we plotted IVW estimates after systematically removing
one variant at a time in the instrument to determine whether outliers were driving the causal
effect.

Software and statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted using R version 3.5.0. We utilized the TwoSampleMR36,
MendelianRandomization37, and PhenoScanner35 packages. All summary statistic data used for

analysis are available at the corresponding consortia websites. All statistical tests were twosided.

Results
The BMI instrument comprised 69 SNPs which collectively explained 2.27% of the variance in
BMI. The WHRadjBMI instrument comprised 36 SNPs and explained 1.19% of the variance in
WHRadjBMI. On the basis of these estimates, we had 80% power to detect a causal OR of 1.17
for a SD increase in BMI, and 1.19 for a SD increase in WHRadjBMI.

[Insert Figure 1 here]

A 1-SD increase in BMI was associated with an increased risk of CTS (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.482.02, p=2.68e-12; Table 1, Figure 1). This effect translates to an absolute risk increase of 16.8
additional CTS cases per 1000 person years [95% CI 11.0-23.5]. This effect was stronger than
the previously reported meta-analytic effect size across 58 observational studies (p=0.03).
Moderate heterogeneity was observed in the MR estimate (Q=112, p=6.7e-04). In contrast, a 1SD increase in WHRadjBMI was not associated with CTS, however estimates were less
precisely estimated relative to effects of BMI (OR 1.03, 0.77-1.39, p=0.83; Table 1, Figure 1).

We examined mediation for the effect of BMI on CTS by first testing for univariable MR effects
of T2D and circulating lipids on CTS (Table 1). A doubling in the odds of T2D was associated

with increased risk of CTS (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03-1.11, p=5.20e-05). Model-based sensitivity
analyses provided consistent causal effect estimates (Figure 2). In contrast, effect estimates for a
1-SD increase in LDL (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96-1.12, p=0.35), HDL (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93-1.13,
p=0.62), and triglycerides (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.93-1.16, p=0.53) were all consistent with the null.
The direct effect of BMI on CTS was partially attenuated in multivariable MR adjusting for T2D,
suggesting partial mediation through T2D (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.38-1.68, p=2.85e-08; Table 1).

[Insert Figure 2 here]

Six lines of evidence support the robustness of the causal effect of BMI on CTS. First, the MR
Egger intercept, a measure of horizontal pleiotropy, did not differ from the null (Beta = -0.009,
p=0.21). Second, a range of sensitivity analyses with varying instrumental variable assumptions
produced highly consistent effect estimates (Figure 2). Third, no pleiotropic variants were
detected by MR-PRESSO. Fourth, estimates were materially unchanged when removing the
variant within the highly pleiotropic FTO gene (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.41-1.97, p=1.36e-09). Fifth,
IVW effects were consistent when removing variants from the BMI instrument nominally
associated with height (13 SNPs; OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.44-2.05, p=1.49e-09) or with grip strength
(5 SNPs; OR 1.70, 1.44-2.00, p=1.76e-10), suggesting minimal pleiotropy by these traits (Figure
2). Six, leave-one-out analyses did not indicate that results were driven by a single outlier variant
(Figure 3).

Discussion
In this large-scale MR study utilizing data from 12,312 CTS cases and 389,344 controls, we
identified evidence for a causal effect of BMI, but not of WHRadjBMI on CTS. These effects
were consistent across a range of sensitivity analyses for horizontal pleiotropy, and were partially
mediated through T2D but not through circulating lipids. These results support several
conclusions.

First, these results provide the strongest evidence to date for a causal effect of greater BMI on
development of CTS. Moreover, we found that, relative to observational estimates, genetically
instrumented BMI had a stronger effect for a given unit increase in the exposure. This difference
may be a consequence of the impact of genetic variation on lifelong increases in levels of an
exposure7. This is in contrast to phenotypically measured BMI, which may be more reflective of
one particular time point in an individual’s life. However, caution should also be taken in
interpreting this difference in effects, due to the impact of non-collapsibility of the odds ratio on
instrumental variable analysis38. It is important to note that these findings relate to CTS etiology
rather than progression. While it is highly plausible that BMI is also a causal risk factor for
progression of CTS, testing this hypothesis would necessitate a GWAS of CTS progression39,
which is not presently available. Taken together, these findings collectively support clinical
investigation of weight loss as a potential tool to mitigate the burden of CTS in high-risk
occupations40.

Next, our results suggest that effect of BMI on CTS is partially mediated through T2D, but not
through hyperlipidemia. We demonstrated through univariable MR that liability to T2D has a

causal effect on CTS. Diabetes has long been associated with CTS22, with putative mediators
including oxidative stress and extracellular protein glycation6. More broadly, neuropathy is a
well-established complication of T2D. In multivariable MR, the point estimate of BMI on CTS
was reduced from 1.73 to 1.53, suggesting that the majority of the BMI effect is not accounted
for by increased liability to T2D. Importantly, since genotypes are precisely estimated, there is
unlikely to be residual mediation due to measurement error in the mediator. These results suggest
that efforts to reduce the population burden of T2D will only partially mitigate the causal effect
of BMI on CTS, and that obese individuals remain at elevated risk for CTS regardless of their
T2D status. Given the strong causal effect of WHRadjBMI on liability to T2D and
cardiometabolic health15, it is surprising that there was no association between WHRadjBMI and
CTS. However, the confidence intervals of the effect estimate are potentially consistent with a
small causal effect that may be revealed in future analyses. Triangulating this result with the
strong effect of BMI on CTS suggests that, apart from T2D, metabolic dysfunction is not a
strong contributor to CTS risk. As further support for this conclusion, genetically instrumented
elevations in circulating lipids had no causal effect on odds of CTS. Insofar as CTS is
representative of peripheral neuropathies, these results also suggest that LDL lowering is
unlikely to be a causal risk factor for neuropathy41. These null effects suggest that associations
reported in prior studies may have been driven by residual confounding, potentially by BMI or
T2D23.

Apart from the partially mediated effect through T2D, precise mechanisms for the link of overall
adiposity to CTS remain speculative. A direct compressive effect of adipose tissue within the
carpal tunnel, or of increased hydrostatic pressure throughout the carpal canal42, has been

suggested6. Alternatively, the link may be explained through increased endoneurial edema43 or
through increased rates of hand osteoarthritis44 in obese patients45. Additionally, one may intuit
that BMI is not a direct measure of adiposity and thus lean mass could be a primary causal
factor. This concern was explicitly addressed in a prior study utilizing data from the Avon
Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children4. Here, the authors found that BMI is tightly
correlated with objective measures of adiposity, and that the health effects of BMI closely mirror
the effects of more precisely measured adiposity; on the basis of these results, they concluded
that BMI is a highly suitable metric for assessing the health effects of adiposity. Moreover, the
MR effects of BMI on CTS were consistent when removing variants nominally associated with
grip strength, a proxy for lean body mass. At present, all GWAS data available on grip strength
and CTS are from the same dataset (UKB) which precludes the use of two-sample MR; however,
as additional cohorts become available, future studies may be able to more accurately
characterize what, if any, causative role lean mass has on the development of CTS.

The major strength of this analysis is the use of Mendelian randomization, with consistent results
identified across a range of sensitivity analyses. Given the random allocation of variants at
gametogenesis7,10, these results are unlikely to be strongly biased by confounding or reverse
causality. Additionally, the use of two independent samples for measurement of exposure and
outcome associations avoids bias due to sample overlap. Due to the use of large sample sizes, we
were powered to detect small effect sizes in both univariable and multivariable MR. Finally, the
exposure and outcome SNP associations were both measured in participants of European
ancestry, minimizing the potential for confounding by population stratification. There are also
limitations to acknowledge. Although results were highly consistent across a range of sensitivity

analyses, horizontal pleiotropy may account for the observed associations7. As a consequence of
the low response rate for study participation, volunteers in UKB are generally healthier than the
general population46. This may reduce generalizability of disease associations or induce collider
bias47. Despite a similar prevalence of CTS (3.2%) relative to prior estimates1, this phenotype
may be underascertained due to the lack of availability of primary care diagnostic codes at the
time of the CTS GWAS. The resulting contamination of the control group would be expected to
dilute the estimated causal effect. Finally, replication of these results in an independent cohort,
and in participants of non-European ancestry, will strengthen confidence in the causal effect of
BMI on CTS.

In conclusion, the present results are consistent with a causal effect of higher BMI, but not of
WHRadjBMI, on odds of carpal tunnel syndrome. These results further the understanding of the
pathophysiology of carpal tunnel syndrome.
