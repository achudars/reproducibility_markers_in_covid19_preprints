Abstract

49

Background: Metagenomic sequencing of respiratory microbial communities for etiologic pathogen identification

50

in pneumonia may help overcome the limitations of current culture-based methods. We examined the feasibility

51

and clinical validity of rapid-turnaround metagenomics with NanoporeTM sequencing of respiratory samples for

52

severe pneumonia diagnosis.

53
54

Methods and Findings: We conducted a case-control study of mechanically-ventilated patients with pneumonia

55

(nine culture-positive and five culture-negative) and without pneumonia (eight controls). We collected

56

endotracheal aspirate samples (ETAs) and applied a microbial DNA enrichment method prior to performing

57

metagenomic sequencing with the Oxford Nanopore MinION device. We compared Nanopore results against

58

clinical microbiologic cultures and bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In nine culture-positive cases, Nanopore

59

revealed communities with low alpha diversity and high abundance of the bacterial (n=8) or fungal (n=1) species

60

isolated by clinical cultures. In four culture-positive cases with resistant organisms, Nanopore detected antibiotic

61

resistance genes corresponding to the phenotypic resistance identified by clinical antibiograms. In culture-

62

negative pneumonia, Nanopore revealed probable bacterial pathogens in 1/5 cases and airway colonization by

63

Candida species in 3/5 cases. In controls, Nanopore showed high abundance of oral bacteria in 5/8 subjects,

64

and identified colonizing respiratory pathogens in the three other subjects. Nanopore and 16S sequencing

65

showed excellent concordance for the most abundant bacterial taxa.

66
67

Conclusion: We demonstrated technical feasibility and proof-of-concept clinical validity of Nanopore

68

metagenomics for severe pneumonia diagnosis, with striking concordance with positive microbiologic cultures

69

and clinically actionable information offered from the sequencing profiles of culture-negative samples.

70

Prospective studies with real-time metagenomics are warranted to examine the impact on antimicrobial decision-

71

making and clinical outcomes.

Introduction

75

Pneumonia is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality among adults, leading to more than one million

76

hospitalizations every year and high rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission in the US (1). The mainstay of

77

pneumonia management is early and appropriate antimicrobial therapy targeting the causative pathogens,

78

balanced with preventing antibiotic overuse and emergence of resistance (2). Thus, timely and accurate

79

identification of causal pathogens is imperative yet remains challenging due to reliance on culture-based

80

methods with low sensitivity and long turnaround times (48~72 hours to actionable results (3)). Recently

81

developed rapid polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) tests represent a significant advancement in the field (4), but

82

these tests can only detect the presence/absence of selected panels of pathogens, and thus are not

83

comprehensive enough in breadth or resolution. Culture-independent methods using next-generation

84

sequencing of microbial communities may help overcome the limitations of current diagnostic testing (5–7).

85

Our group and others have provided proof-of-concept evidence that sequencing of the bacterial 16S

86

rRNA gene (16S sequencing) in clinical respiratory specimens can provide diagnostic insights beyond standard

87

microbiologic cultures (5,8–10). Nevertheless, standard 16S sequencing is not clinically applicable due to limited

88

resolution (providing only genus-level bacterial identification) and lengthy sample processing, library preparation

89

and data acquisition timelines (11). The advent of Nanopore metagenomic sequencing (Oxford Nanopore

90

Technologies [ONT], UK) has offered unprecedented capacities for real-time, detailed profiling of microbial

91

communities at species level (including viruses and fungi) (12–15). With recent technical improvements to

92

overcome the high amounts of contaminating human DNA in clinical respiratory samples (16), Nanopore

93

metagenomics may allow for the development of a novel diagnostic approach for pneumonia.

94
95

In this study, we sought to evaluate the technical feasibility and clinical validity of Nanopore metagenomic
sequencing for etiologic diagnosis of severe pneumonia in mechanically-ventilated patients in the ICU.

Study design and Participants

From June 2018 – March 2019, we carried out a nested case-control study from an ongoing registry

101

enrolling mechanically-ventilated adult patients with acute respiratory failure in the Medical Intensive Care Unit

(MICU) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) (5,17). Exclusion criteria included inability to

103

obtain informed consent, presence of tracheostomy, or mechanical ventilation for more than 72 hours prior to

104

enrollment.

105

We diagnosed clinical pneumonia based on consensus committee review of clinical, radiographic, and

106

microbiologic data per established criteria (18). We selected 14 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia

107

(nine with culture-confirmed diagnosis [culture-positive pneumonia group] and five with negative cultures

108

[culture-negative pneumonia group]). Culture-positivity was deemed when a probable respiratory pathogen was

109

isolated in clinical microbiologic cultures of respiratory specimens obtained at the discretion of treating physicians

110

(sputum, endotracheal aspirate [ETA], or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [BALF]). In culture-positive cases,

111

antibiotic susceptibility testing was done as per standard practice at UPMC’s clinical microbiology laboratory,

112

and results were interpreted based on Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute criteria (19). We also included

113

eight subjects (controls) who did not have evidence of lower respiratory tract infection and were intubated either

114

for airway protection (n=5) or respiratory failure from cardiogenic pulmonary edema (n=3). From enrolled

115

subjects, we collected ETAs for research purposes (sequencing) within the first 48hr from intubation. In two

116

subjects, we utilized ETAs obtained on the fifth day post-intubation (instead of their baseline samples) when

117

there was clinical suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (Case 10 and 15). From plasma samples

118

taken at the same time with ETAs, we measured plasma procalcitonin levels (17). We recorded demographic,

119

physiological, and laboratory variables at the time of sample acquisition, from which we calculated clinical

120

pulmonary infection scores (CPIS) (20), and reviewed the antimicrobial therapies administered for the first 10

121

days from intubation.

122

This study was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board (Protocol

123

PRO10110387). Written informed consent was provided by all participants or their surrogates in accordance with

124

the Declaration of Helsinki.

125

Microbial DNA sequencing approaches

126

We focused our sequencing approach on DNA-based organisms (i.e. excluding RNA viruses) and aimed

127

to perform agnostic profiling for microbes (bacteria and fungi) present in the ETAs obtained from the patients in

128

the ICU. However, metagenomic microbial DNA sequencing in clinical respiratory samples is technically

129

challenging because of the high amounts of contaminating human DNA that can overwhelm the sequencing

130

output (ratio of human:microbial DNA >99:1 (21). Therefore, we applied a human DNA depletion step in ETA

131

samples that utilized a detergent-based (saponin) method for selective lysis of human cells and digestion of

132

human DNA with nuclease, as recently described (16). We extracted genomic DNA with the DNeasy Powersoil

133

Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and assessed the efficiency of human DNA depletion by comparing quantitative

134

PCR (qPCR) cycle threshold (Ct) of a human gene (Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase - GAPDH) and

135

the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (V3-V4 region) (22) between samples subjected to depletion vs. not (depleted vs.

136

undepleted samples).

137

From extracted DNA in depleted samples, we prepared metagenomic sequencing libraries with a Rapid

138

PCR Barcoding Kit (SQK-RPB004) and then ran on the MinION device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT),

139

UK, UK) for five hours. We basecalled the output (i.e. converted the sequencing device output into nucleic acid

140

base sequences) with the Guppy software and used the ONT platform, EPI2ME, for quality control, species

141

identification [What’s In My Pot (WIMP) pipeline] and antimicrobial resistance gene analyses [ARMA workflow].

142

Samples that generated fewer than 300 high-quality microbial reads were excluded from further analyses. As an

143

internal quality control for the reliability and reproducibility of Nanopore sequencing, we performed sequencing

144

on two samples with extracted DNA from a mock microbial community with known composition (ZymoBIOMICS

145

Microbial Community Standard) and compared derived vs. expected abundance of microbial species.

146

To further validate the results of Nanopore sequencing for bacterial DNA, we performed standard 16S

147

rRNA gene (V4 region) PCR amplification and sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq Platform as a reference method

148

for bacterial DNA sequencing (23). We processed 16S sequences using an in-house pipeline developed by the

149

University of Pittsburgh Center for Medicine and the Microbiome (CMM) (24–29). Samples that generated fewer

150

than 100 bacterial reads were excluded from further analyses.

151

Ecological and statistical analyses

152

From sequencing reads obtained from Nanopore and 16S sequencing, we calculated alpha diversity by

153

Shannon index, performed permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) testing to assess

154

compositional differences between sample types, and visualized compositional dissimilarities between samples

155

with the non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) method using the Bray-Curtis index. All analyses were

156

performed with the R vegan package (30).

Cohort description

160

We enrolled 22 mechanical-ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure: nine with retrospective

161

consensus diagnosis of culture-positive pneumonia, five with culture-negative pneumonia, and eight controls.

162

Clinical characteristics and outcomes for the three groups are shown in Table 1. Cases with culture-positive

163

pneumonia had significantly higher CPIS and a trend for higher procalcitonin levels compared to controls (Table

164

1, Fig S1). At the time of enrollment, empiric antibiotics had been prescribed for all 14 patients with clinical

165

diagnosis of pneumonia, as well as for 5/8 of control patients (Table 1, Fig S3).

Technical feasibility of Nanopore sequencing in clinical samples

179

Pre-processing of the ETA samples with the saponin-based human DNA depletion protocol resulted in

180

relative enrichment of bacterial DNA by an average of 1260-fold (Fig S2). This microbial enrichment step allowed

181

for generation of sufficient numbers of microbial reads by Nanopore sequencing in depleted samples (median

182

6682 reads, average proportion 48% of total reads), whereas in undepleted samples the sequencing output was

183

overwhelmed by human DNA (only 1% of reads were of microbial origin) and effectively was unusable (Fig 1A).

184

Importantly, the depletion protocol did not appear to alter the underlying bacterial communities, because

185

ecological analyses of depleted and undepleted samples by 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated no

186

significant differences in alpha or beta diversity (Fig 1B, C).

222

Nanopore results for detecting the culture-identified pathogen(s). By focusing on the three most abundant

223

species (bacterial or fungal) by Nanopore sequencing, we were able to identify all culture-confirmed pathogens

224

with high relative abundances.

225

In eight culture-positive bacterial pneumonias, Nanopore profiles showed high abundance of the same

226

bacterial species isolated in cultures (Fig 3A). These highly abundant causative bacterial pathogens had on

227

average 90 times higher relative abundance compared to the species ranked second in abundance in each

228

community (Fig 3B). Nanopore sequencing also revealed high abundance of additional potential bacterial

229

pathogens in 2/8 of samples that were not detected by cultures (E. coli in subject 1 and H. influenzae in subject

230

8), suggesting the presence of a polymicrobial infection despite the isolation of a single pathogenic bacterial

231

species on standard cultures (Fig 3A).

232

These eight culture-positive cases with clinical antibiograms allowed for examination of the potential

233

predictive utility of antibiotic resistance gene detection with metagenomic sequencing (Table 2). In the single

234

case of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, case 2, Fig S3), Nanopore detected 4 reads aligned

235

to the responsible mecA gene, whereas in the three cases of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA, cases 3, 5

236

and 6), no mecA gene reads were detected. Similarly, in the two cases of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and

237

E.coli, Nanopore detected genes that explained the observed phenotypic antimicrobial resistance profile (Table

238

2).

239

We also tested the performance of Nanopore sequencing in one case with probable invasive fungal

240

infection. Subject 9 was a lung transplant recipient who had been receiving antifungal therapy for a positive

241

sputum culture for Aspergillus fumigatus. Clinical decompensation with acute respiratory failure raised concern

242

for bacterial co-infection and initiation of intensive broad-spectrum antibiotics. BALF culture grew again

243

Aspergillus fumigatus, which was the dominant pathogen detected by Nanopore, without any other sequencing

244

evidence of bacterial infection (Fig 3C). Thus, in this case with probable invasive fungal infection, Nanopore

245

sequencing only identified a confirmed fungal pathogen and ruled out the presence of bacterial pneumonia.

246
247

Culture-negative pneumonia

248

Nanopore sequencing provided diverse representations of microbial communities in cases of clinical

249

suspicion of pneumonia with negative cultures, and thus interpretation needs to be individualized for each case

250

(Fig S3).

251

In case 10 with an initial diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia caused by S. aureus and Klebsiella oxytoca

252

identified by BALF culture on day 2 post-intubation, clinical deterioration on appropriate antibiotic therapy and

253

new radiographic infiltrates by day 5 raised concern for VAP. However, repeat BAL culture on day 5 was

254

negative. Nanopore detected high abundance of both S. aureus and Klebsiella oxytoca on day 5 sample,

255

revealing that the culture-negative community consisted of abundant previously identified pathogens, which were

256

likely not viable at the time of the day 5 BALF acquisition due to ongoing antibiotic therapy. Moreover, low

257

procalcitonin level at the time of the day 5 sample (94 pg/μl) and absence of new pathogens by sequencing

258

made diagnosis of new VAP unlikely.

259

In another case of a lung transplant recipient (subject 11) with diffuse bilateral consolidations and

260

persistent clinical septic picture of undefined etiology, BALF culture was only positive for yeast and the patient

261

was empirically treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Eventually, the patient was proven to be fungemic with

262

delayed growth of Candida glabrata on initial blood cultures prompting addition of antifungal therapy. Nanopore

263

sequencing on ETA sample from day 1 post-intubation showed high abundance of Candida glabrata and

264

Candida dubliniensis with very low abundance of bacterial reads, confirming the absence of bacterial pneumonia

265

and demonstrating fungal colonization of the allograft. Of note, in two other culture-negative cases, Nanopore

266

also detected high abundance of Candida albicans (Fig 3D), whereas in the last case, both Nanopore and 16S

267

sequencing identified abundant oral bacteria with no typical respiratory pathogens.

268
269

Controls

270

Eight control subjects did not meet clinical diagnostic criteria for pneumonia on retrospective examination

271

of their clinical course. Despite not meeting diagnostic criteria, 5/8 cases empiric antibiotics were prescribed

272

empiric antibiotics early in their course for initial consideration of possible pneumonia. Five samples were

273

dominated by common oral bacteria, such as Rothia and non-pneumoniae Streptococcus species (31,32).

274

However, in the other three samples, Nanopore and 16S sequencing detected potential respiratory pathogens

275

(e.g. S.aureus, H. influenzae or S. pneumoniae) that were likely airway colonizers not causing clinical infection,

276

notion supported by clinical improvement despite early discontinuation of antibiotics and/or low procalcitonin

277

levels (Fig S3). No significant fungal DNA presence was detected by Nanopore sequencing in the control group

278

(Fig 3E).

Discussion

311

In this nested case-control study, we provide proof-of-concept evidence that untargeted, shotgun

312

metagenomic sequencing with the MinION device can provide clinically useful information for etiologic diagnosis

313

of pneumonia in mechanically-ventilated patients. We demonstrate feasibility of metagenomic sequencing

314

directly from clinical respiratory specimens by applying a saponin-based protocol for human DNA depletion prior

315

to sequencing. Our analyses demonstrated global microbial community structure and species-level

316

compositional diﬀerences associated with culture-positivity and clinical diagnosis of pneumonia. Nanopore

317

sequencing had striking concordance with cultures by detecting high abundance of the causative pathogenic

318

bacteria in culture-positive cases and refuting bacterial pneumonia diagnosis in selected culture-negative cases.

319

Nanopore metagenomic sequencing holds promise as a potential infection diagnostic tool due to its

320

comprehensive scope, high resolution and real-time data generation (6). However, contaminating human DNA

321

has been a rate-limiting step for clinical implementation of direct-from-sample sequencing in respiratory

322

specimens. By applying a recently validated protocol with saponin-based, human DNA depletion (13), we

323

demonstrate that this approach is feasible, reproducible and effective for maximizing the microbial signal in

324

clinical samples and providing reaching reliable diagnostic output. With further technical improvements, process

325

automation and cost reductions of metagenomic sequencing, this approach could be introduced in the clinical

326

microbiology laboratories as part of the diagnostic pipeline.

327

Nanopore sequencing showed high accuracy in pathogen identification in culture-positive pneumonia.

328

Obviating the need for ex-vivo growth for organisms, direct-from-sample sequencing can offer comprehensive

329

snapshots of the component microbes of the communities at the time of sample acquisition. Sequencing methods

330

are thus robust to specific growth condition requirements or the impaired viability of organisms due to antecedent

331

antimicrobials, factors that can lead to the ‘great plate count anomaly’ of culture-based methods, i.e. the absent

332

or limited growth of bacteria in cultures despite abundant visualized organisms on specimen gram-staining (33).

333

In exploratory analyses of the sequencing output, Nanopore also provided antibiotic resistance information by

334

detecting clinically relevant resistance genes that matched the phenotypic resistance on antibiograms (e.g. mecA

335

detection/absence in MRSA/MSSA cases, respectively). Overall, rapid metagenomic sequencing closely

336

matched the results of current, reference-standard diagnostic methods in our cohort, which typically take 2-3

337

days for allowing appropriate antibiotic adjustments to occur. Thus, with further external validation in additional

338

cohorts, nanopore metagenomics hold promise for rapidly accelerating the diagnosis of etiologic pathogens and

339

shortening the time to appropriate therapy selection in cases where diagnosis currently relies on cultures.

340

Invasive pulmonary fungal infections represent a major diagnostic challenge due to the poor sensitivity

341

and slow turnaround times of cultures and the need for invasive samples with histopathology for diagnostic

342

confirmation (34). In the single case of Aspergillus fumigatus infection, Nanopore confirmed the high abundance

343

of Aspergillus fumigatus in the community and ruled out concomitant bacterial pneumonia. Such results can

344

directly influence clinical practice, as unnecessary and potentially harmful antibiotics could be discontinued with

345

antimicrobial therapies focused on the causative fungal pathogen (35).

346

In cases of culture-negative pneumonia and in controls, the main compositional pattern consisted of

347

diverse communities with oral bacteria abundance (5), similar to clinical microbiology reports of normal

348

respiratory flora. In such cases, early de-escalation or discontinuation of antibiotics could be further supported

349

by sequencing results, if available in real-time. Nonetheless, in 3/5 airway controls, potential respiratory

350

pathogens were detected in high abundance by both Nanopore and 16S sequencing, in the absence of other

351

supportive evidence of pneumonia. Such cases highlight that the high sensitivity of sequencing for identifying

352

pathogenic organisms missed by cultures could accentuate the existing clinical challenge of distinguishing

353

colonizing vs. infecting organisms in the airways of mechanically-ventilated patients. In such scenarios, the

354

distinction between colonization and infection cannot be based solely on microbial DNA sequencing outputs, but

355

needs to be an integrative one, incorporating clinical, radiographic, and systemic or focal host-responses (36–

356

38). At the same time, knowledge of colonizing organisms in critically-ill patients could facilitate more targeted

357

choices for initial antibiotic regimens in the event of a secondary infection, such as VAP.

358

Our study is limited by the single center design and the available sample size. W e did not perform

359

Nanopore sequencing and data analyses in real-time because of our retrospective study design, and our

360

objective of demonstrating proof-of-concept feasibility. Nonetheless, the method is implementable with short

361

turnaround times (~6-8hrs) (13). The results of antibiotic resistance gene sequencing should be interpreted

362

with caution, given that our analyses were exploratory, included a limited number of multidrug-resistant

363

bacteria that precluded a formal predictive modeling analysis. Thus, development of reliable predictive rules

364

for pneumonia diagnosis or resistance gene identification based on sequencing outputs will require

365

prospective examination of large cohorts of patient samples. Finally, the human DNA depletion method we

366

applied is not yet optimized for viral DNA detection (16). Nonetheless, most clinically relevant respiratory

367

viruses are RNA organisms, which are not within the scope of current DNA-based metagenomics, but can be

368

detected with available PCR-based panels. With evolving rapid metagenomic platforms that can also

369

sequence RNA molecules (39), the profiling of respiratory viruses as well as host transcriptomic responses

370

(37) will enable more comprehensive representations of the altered respiratory ecosystem in pneumonia.

371

In conclusion, our study demonstrates the technical feasibility and clinical validity of direct-from-specimen

372

metagenomics with a rapid protocol for human DNA depletion protocol and sequencing with the MiNION device.

373

Metagenomic approaches hold promise for the development of rapid and comprehensive diagnostic tools for

374

severe pneumonia that could transform the existing diagnostic paradigm. With real-time data generation and

375

turnaround times of 6-8hrs from sample acquisition to result, rapid metagenomics could conceivably allow for

376

targeted adjustment of initial empiric antibiotic regimens even before their second dose is due, and thus allow

377

for personalized antimicrobial prescriptions and antibiotic stewardship gains. Our results provide strong rationale

378

for a prospective, large-scale study with real-time application of metagenomics in order to measure the direct

379

impact on antibiotic guidance and clinical outcomes.
