Background: Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is a complication commonly
associated with invasive angiographic procedures and is considered the leading cause of
hospital-acquired acute kidney injury. CI-AKI can lead to a prolonged hospital stay, with a
substantial economic impact, and increased mortality. The DyeVert™ PLUS EZ system
(FDA approved and CE marked) is a device that has been developed to divert a portion of the
theoretical injected contrast media volume (CMV), reducing the overall injected contrast
media and aortic reflux and potentially improving long-term health outcomes.

Objectives: To assess the long-term costs and health outcomes associated with the
introduction of the DyeVert™ PLUS EZ system into the health care service for the
prevention of CI-AKI in a cohort of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3-4
undergoing Diagnostic Coronary Angiography (DAG) and/or Percutaneous Coronary
intervention (PCI), compared with current practice.

Methods: A de novo economic model was developed based on the current pathway of
managing patients undergoing DAG and/or PCI and on evidence related to the clinical
effectiveness of DyeVert™, in terms of its impact on relevant clinical outcomes and health
service resource use. Clinical data used to populate the model were derived from the
literature or were based on assumptions informed by expert clinical input. Costs included in
the model were obtained from the literature and UK-based routine sources. Probabilistic
distributions were assigned to the majority of model parameters so that a probabilistic
analysis could be undertaken, while deterministic sensitivity analyses were also carried out to
explore the impact of key parameter variation on the model results.

Results: Base-case results indicate that the intervention leads to cost savings (- £3,878) and
improved effectiveness (+ 0.02 QALYs) over the patient’s lifetime, compared with current
practice. Output from the probabilistic analysis supports the high likelihood of the
intervention being cost-effective across presented willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. The
overall long-term cost saving for the NHS associated with introduction of the intervention for
each cohort of patients is over £175 million. The cost savings are mainly driven by lower risk
of subsequent diseases and associated costs

Conclusions: Introduction of the DyeVert™ PLUS EZ system has the potential to reduce
costs for the health care service and lead to improved clinical outcomes for patients with
CKD stage 3-4 undergoing angiographic procedures.

1. Introduction
One common complication associated with angiographic procedures, and attributed to
radiocontrast media, is the contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) (1-3). CI-AKI is
defined as the impairment of renal function, measured as either a 25% increase in serum
creatinine (SCr) from baseline or a 0.5 mg/dL (44 µmol/L) increase in absolute SCr value
within 48-72 hours after intravenous contrast administration.
The development of CI-AKI can lead to prolonged hospital stay, additional financial burden,
and increased mortality (4, 5). In particular, the economic impact of CI-AKI in the UK is
significant. It is estimated that in 2010-2011 there were 977,116 excess bed days attributable
to AKI in the UK, with an associated cost of £304 million (4). CI-AKI is considered the
leading cause of hospital-acquired AKI and is responsible for one third of AKI cases (6). This
condition is closely related to angiographic procedures, where the incidence of CI-AKI in
patients undergoing angiographic procedures ranges between 1-2% for patients without prior
chronic kidney disease (CKD), and 30% for patients with a combination of risk factors (7-9).
Since there is no definitive treatment available for CI-AKI, the focus has been on the
prevention of the condition. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) published updated
guidelines on the prevention of CI-AKI (10), providing a framework for the use of evidencebased preventative strategies. Among these strategies, they recommend the identification of
patients at risk of CI-AKI, appropriate periprocedural hydration, and minimising contrast
volume in at-risk patients. Previous studies have shown that the CI-AKI is associated with
increased risk of death, myocardial infarction, bleeding, and recurrent renal injury after
discharge (11, 12).
The DyeVert™ PLUS EZ system (FDA approved and CE marked) is a device that adjusts
contrast media (CM) during manual injection. This is achieved by diverting a portion of the
theoretical injected contrast media volume (CMV), reducing the overall injected contrast
media and reducing aortic reflux (13). Reduction in CMV has been shown to be non-linearly
associated with decreased risk of CI-AKI, which can be linked to a reduction in short- and
long-term costs and consequences (14). This economic analysis aims to estimate the
cumulative difference in costs and effectiveness in patients undergoing Diagnostic Coronary
Angiography (DAG) and/or Percutaneous Coronary intervention (PCI) with the use of
DyeVertTM PLUS compared to the current standard of care.

2. Methods
A de novo economic model was developed reflecting the current management pathway of
patients undergoing DAG and/or PCI. The model was built upon evidence related to the
clinical effectiveness of DyeVert™ PLUS, measured as the reduction in contrast media (CM)
and subsequent incidence of CI-AKI, as well as economic evidence related to associated
NHS resource use. For each treatment arm, costs and outcomes were aggregated on the basis
of a series of decisions and events. The structure of the model remained unchanged between
the two treatment options.
The model was based on a hypothetical cohort of patients with CKD stage 3-4 undergoing

DAG and/or PCI. As per NICE requirements, and in order to fully capture the differences in
costs and benefits between the DyeVert™ PLUS EZ system and the comparator, a lifetime
time horizon was used in the base-case analysis (15). The recommended discount rate in the
UK (3.5% per annum) was applied for both costs and benefits (16). The model considered
all costs from the UK NHS and personal social services perspective, and was developed in
Microsoft Excel.

2.1 Model structure
The model structure comprises a decision tree followed by a Markov model with six health
states. This model has a lifetime time-horizon with costs and benefits estimated in the
decision tree for the first three months, and in the Markov model for the remainder of the
patient’s lifetime. The Markov model has a cycle length of three months. Figure 1 presents an
illustrative representation of the model structure. The model was used to simulate the
management of patients undergoing DAG and/or PCI with reduced kidney function (i.e.
eGFR 15 - 60 ml/min/1.73m2). In each strategy, patients may or may not experience a CIAKI requiring further treatment. Patients may then either remain in state ‘CKD stage 3-4’ (or
state ‘CKD stage 3-4 (AKI history)’ if they previously had CI-AKI) or progress according to
the natural progression of CKD to state ‘CKD stage 5’. Patients whose renal insufficiency is
not severe (i.e. ‘CKD stage 3-4’) can experience a recurrent AKI or a myocardial infarction
(MI) at any point. Patients who enter the ‘CKD stage 5’ are assumed to either remain in this
state or die, as they will be receiving dialysis and treatments to prevent an MI. Patients in
each model state will incur associated costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
Simulated patients are at risk of death from all causes during any given cycle period. Risk of
death is conditional on CKD stage, history of AKI and/or MI, and age. The all-cause
mortality rates were derived from general population mortality statistics reported in national
life tables (17) and were adjusted to reflect the extra mortality associated with CI-AKI and
renal insufficiency.

2.2 Model inputs
All inputs used to populate the economic model are described in the following section and are
presented in Table 2. Patients at model entry was those undergoing DAG and/or PCI with
some kidney function impairment (CKD stage 3-4). The base-case population was 72 years
old (14). The number of patients undergoing DAG and/or PCI was derived from NHS
reference costs activity of percutaneous coronary angioplasty (HRG code EY40-EY41) and
cardiac catheterisation (HRG code EY42-EY43) (18). It was assumed, based on Gurm et al.
(14) that 26% of these procedures would be DAG combined with PCI.

Evidence has shown that when DyeVertTM PLUS is used in patients undergoing DAG and/or
PCI the contrast media volume is significantly reduced (14). To estimate the reduction in risk
of CI-AKI after using DyeVertTM, we analyzed the CI-AKI rate based on the 0.5 serum
creatinine increase definition used in the development of the Mehran (9) risk score and ran
the Mehran risk score on the population to arrive at a projected risk rate for the population.
The projected rate was 14% and the actual rate was 11%. Therefore, the estimated risk
reduction was estimated to be 21.4%. The estimated risk reduction was used to adjust the risk
of CI-AKI in the intervention arm for the base-case analysis. Alternatively, the risk reduction
was estimated using the data from Gurm et al., 2016 and Gurm et al., 2018 (14, 19) (Table 1
below).

Transition probabilities
The incidence of CI-AKI in patients with CKD undergoing PCI was based on a cohort study
of 1,473 patients and was estimated to be 30% (3, 9). The baseline transition probability
associated with the progression of patients from CKD stage 3-4 to CKD stage 5 for different
age groups, was based on a ten-year cumulative incidence rate in a cohort study of 3,047
patients (20). The probability of transitioning to Stage 5 CKD following a CI-AKI after the
first cycle (first 3 months) was obtained from clinical guidelines from CG169 and James et
al., 2010 (21) and from the study by Valle et al., 2017 (12). The probability of MI for patients
with a history of CI-AKI was taken from Valle et al., 2017 (12). For patients who had not
experienced an AKI throughout the model, the probability of MI was 1.42% and 0.688% in
the first 3 months and the subsequent cycles respectively (12). For patients who had
experienced CI-AKI in the previous cycles, the equivalent probabilities were 2.581% and
1.291% respectively (12).
The probability of recurrent AKI was taken from the same study as the probability of MI
(12). Based on the cumulative incidence in the 3rd month and the first year of the study
follow-up, we estimated the probability of recurrent AKI in the first 3 months after the DAG
and/or PCI, and for subsequent 3-month cycles. For patients who had not experienced a CI6

3 months and the subsequent cycles respectively. For patients who had experienced CI-AKI
during the procedure, the equivalent probabilities were 6.83% and 2.431% respectively.

Probability of death
Standardised mortality ratios for each health state included in the model were applied to the
relevant age-dependent mortality rates and are shown in Table 2 below. These mortality

Costs
Resource consequences
Unit costs for all resource use estimates were extracted from the literature or obtained
through other relevant sources such as NHS reference costs (22), Personal Social Services
Research Unit (31), British national Formulary and manufacturer price list (32). Costs were
measured in Sterling (£) for the year 2018 and were discounted at 3.5% per annum, where
appropriate. All costs included in the model are shown in Table 2.
The choice of cost items was mainly informed by a NICE clinical guidelines model
developed for the evaluation of prevention strategies of CI-AKI using different hydration
methods (33). However, updated unit costs and dosages of drugs were extracted from the
literature. In the instances where unit costs of relevant outcomes were not available, the cost
of items used in the NICE guidelines model (CG169 (24)) were inflated to reflect current
prices. This was done by applying an inflation index provided by the National bank of
England (34).

Intervention cost
The cost of DyeVertTM PLUS technology was estimated to be £350, including the cost of the
smart syringe and module. The company has indicated that free training for using the
technology will be provided to clinical staff, and a smart monitor will be provided free of

For the estimation of CI-AKI event costs, two different methods were used in the model: (1)
For patients who have to be re-admitted to the hospital due to CI-AKI after a DAG and/or
PCI procedure, the cost of an index admission due to AKI was used. (2) For patients admitted
for DAG and/or PCI who have a prolonged length of stay due to CI-AKI, the cost of these
additional bed days was considered.

Patients in CKD stage 3-4 are expected to incur costs associated with consultations with the
nephrologist (33), combined with lab resource costs and an assumed 5-minute phlebotomist
time to measure the patient’s eGFR. Additional costs would include 9% of patients requiring
Epoetin-alfa to treat anaemia, as recommended by the clinical guidelines for anaemia
treatment in patients with CKD (33). Epoetin-alfa dosage was estimated for a 77kg individual
on average, according to ONS. To take into consideration the patients who require diuretics,
an assumption was made based on the guidelines model (33) that about a quarter of patients
(26%) in the CKD 3-4 stage were in CKD stage 4, 60% of whom would be on a 40mg daily
dose of Furosemide (24). The total cost of CKD stage 3-4 per cycle was estimated to be
£269.50.
Patients in stage 5 CKD will incur the drug costs. However, patients in this stage will also
incur costs associated with Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) or Conservative Management.
In this stage, patients are expected to incur costs such as RRT procedures, anaemia
management, specialist appointments, EGFR measurements and diuretics. In the first cycle
that a patient enters the CKD stage 5 state, it is assumed that the intensity of treatment will be
increased compared to later stages, as costs of initiating treatment are captured. It was

assumed, based on the NICE guidelines model (24), that 90% of patients would receive RRT
in this model state. For the estimation of RRT costs, a pooled average was taken from NHS
reference costs 2017-18 accounting for national usage of different treatment modalities, such
as haemodialysis and filtration (22). Patients entering the CKD stage 5 will receive an access
procedure, which will then allow for permanent access for RRT. In subsequent cycles, it was
assumed that there would be no further access procedure-related costs. Drugs and check-ups
are also required and are more frequent in ‘CKD stage 5’. It was assumed that all patients in
this stage would have an eGFR more frequently (on a weekly basis), and two nephrologist
appointments per three months. In this state, Epoetin was assumed to be administered to 33%
of the patients in the same dosage as for patients in CKD 3-4 stages (33). Patients on
conservative management (10%) will be receiving monthly home visits by a specialist nurse
as well as telephone calls on a weekly basis. It was assumed (33) that diuretics would be used
by 90% of the patients with a double dosage compared to CKD 3-4 stages (80mg). The cost
of AMI was taken from Walker et al., 2016 (27). In this study, the cost of AMI for the 1st
year was estimated to be £6,869 and £1,780 for subsequent years. These costs were inflated
to represent prices in 2018.

Utilities
Utilities for CKD stages were obtained from a Japanese study (28) used in both the NICE
guidelines (CG169) (24, 33) and an NHS report on kidney care (35). An adjustment for the
UK population was made by multiplying the values with the general UK population average
utility values for people aged 65 to 75. For the stage of CI-AKI, utility values were taken
from Sullivan et al., 2011 (30) who reported in a catalogue of UK EQ-5D derived utilities a
0.525 (n=194) utility value associated with kidney injury (‘renal failure’). For the MI state,
the same utility as in CKD 3-4 was assumed.

3. Analysis
A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted (10,000 iterations) to derive cumulative estimates
of costs and effects for each strategy in the model. Probabilistic distributions were assigned to
the majority of model parameters (Table 2) so that a probabilistic analysis could be
undertaken, while deterministic sensitivity analyses were also carried out to explore the
impact of key parameter variation on the model results. Total cost savings for the entire
cohort of patients receiving the intervention in the UK over a lifetime time horizon were also
calculated.

This section presents the results of the economic analysis; base-case results are presented first
followed by results of the sensitivity analysis.

Table 3 Base-case probabilistic results

Base-case analysis
Results of the base-case analysis presented in Table 3 indicate that the introduction of
DyeVert™ PLUS EZ system leads to cost savings of £3,878 per patient over a lifetime time
horizon. Additionally, the intervention leads to improved effectiveness over the patient’s
lifetime (+0.02). Therefore, DyeVert™ PLUS is considered a dominant strategy (less costly
and more effective) compared to current practice.
The scatter plot produced from the probabilistic analysis (Figure 2) shows that the vast
majority of points from the 10,000 iterations of the model are in the South-East quadrant of
the cost-effectiveness plane (less costly and more effective), while all simulations indicate
that the intervention is less costly than the comparator. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness
acceptability curve (CEAC) shown in Figure 3 (displaying the probability that the
intervention is cost-effective across a range of willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds)
indicates that the DyeVert™ PLUS EZ system has a 100% probability of being cost-effective
across all WTP thresholds presented. The overall long-term cost savings for the NHS for
cohort of patients is over £175 million (Table 4). Total cost savings are calculated based on
the total number of patients receiving the intervention in the UK over a lifetime time horizon.
The cost savings are mainly driven by lower risk of subsequent diseases and associated costs.

Sensitivity analysis
A number of model parameters were also varied in sensitivity analysis. Multiple one-way
sensitivity analyses were carried out to explore the impact of increasing/decreasing relevant
parameter values by 25%. Figure 2 presents the impact of varying each parameter value by
25% on the incremental cost of the intervention, compared to current practice. Parameters are
displayed in order, with those which have the greatest impact on incremental cost at the top
and those which have the least impact at the end. In the base-case analysis, the incremental
cost of the DyeVert™ PLUS EZ system was -£3,878. As seen in Figure 2 below, MI costs (in
first and subsequent cycles) have the greatest impact on the incremental cost of the
intervention (-/+ 12.3%). When this cost is decreased, cost savings of the intervention reduce
and when this cost is increased, cost savings increase also. However, in both cases,
DyeVert™ PLUS is still a cost saving strategy. All other parameters have minimal impact on
the incremental costs.

Figure 5 and Figure 6 below shows the change in net monetary benefit (NMB) associated
with varying each parameter by 25% and 100% in either direction. NMB is calculated as:

As in the previous analysis, varying the cost of the MI health state in the first and subsequent
cycles is the greatest driver of change in overall results. However, regardless of the direction
in which these costs are varied (± 25% and ±100%), the NMB of the intervention is still
positive. Indeed, for all parameters included in this analysis, the NMB of the DyeVert™
PLUS EZ system remains positive, meaning that it is preferable to current practice from a
health economic perspective.

This study provides an insight into the potential cost savings that could be made by
introducing the DyeVert™ PLUS EZ system into the UK health care system for use amongst
patients with CKD stage 3-4 undergoing DAG and/or PCI. CI-AKI is one of the most
common forms of AKI. The technology being evaluated is a device which acts by reducing
the CMV, which has been shown to be linked to this specific form of the condition. The
clinical efficacy of the technology has been demonstrated in previous clinical studies (13, 23,
36). Therefore, this innovative device has the potential to improve short-term health
outcomes, and lead to cost savings and improved clinical outcomes in the longer-term. In
order to assess costs and outcomes over the patient lifetime, a decision-analytic model was
developed.

The number of studies that have been conducted to assess the relative cost-effectiveness of
interventions to prevent onset of CI-AKI are limited. The National Clinical Guidelines Centre
UK developed a Markov model in 2013, as part of their guidelines on AKI (24), to assess the
cost-effectiveness of various different intravenous fluids for the prevention of the condition.
Results of this study indicated that the most cost-effective strategy involved infusion with
sodium chloride 0.9% and treatment with N-Acetylcysteine. Additionally, a study by
Hiremath et al., 2018 (37) was identified which focussed on assessing the cost-effectiveness

Results of the analysis presented here show the high likelihood that the DyeVert™ PLUS EZ
system will be cost-effective over the lifetime of the patient. The probabilistic results were
conclusive in that the device had a 100% probability of being cost-effective following 10,000
iterations of the model in a Monte Carlo simulation. Similarly, results of the deterministic
sensitivity analyses indicated that the intervention would still be cost saving, and result in a
positive net monetary benefit, in all scenarios assessed. Cost savings associated with
introduction of the intervention are primarily related to the impact it has on the occurrence of
AKI. Not only are there immediate cost savings associated with reducing the likelihood of
experiencing an AKI, but there are also longer-term savings due to the relationship between
AKI and development of CKD. See et al., 2018 (5) found that individuals who experienced
AKI were at a heightened risk of experiencing new or progressive CKD. These long-term
cost savings are captured in the model.

of utilising an iso-osmolar agent, iodixanol, compared to a low-osmolar contrast agent.
Results of this study indicated that the iso-osmolar agent dominated the low-osmolar agent,
i.e. was less costly and more effective over the patient’s lifetime. However, no economic
evaluations focussing on the cost-effectiveness of interventions designed to divert an amount
of the injected CMV were identified, which makes the study presented here unique.
There are limitations to the analysis presented. A number of assumptions were made in
populating the model due to lack of appropriate data. Firstly, it was unknown how different
the risk of developing CI-AKI would be depending on whether the patient had received
DAG, PCI or a combination of both. Therefore, in the model it was assumed that this risk
would be the same, regardless of which of the interventions was initially received. This may
have the effect of over- or under-estimating the risk of developing this complication,
depending on which initial intervention is received, and the direction of this effect is
unknown. Secondly, there were no data to inform the utility value of patients with CKD stage
3-4 who have experienced a MI. Therefore, for the purpose of this analysis, it was assumed
that the utility value of these patients would be same as the utility value of patients with CKD
stage 3-4 who have not experienced this adverse event. Although the data used to inform the
effectiveness of the DyeVert™ PLUS EZ system were derived from robust, published
clinical evidence, the number of studies available to inform the clinical effectiveness of the
device were limited. Ideally, when modelling the impact of a healthcare technology on
clinical outcomes, multiple data sources would be available to verify the clinical efficacy data
being used, and that was not the case for this analysis. Finally, although evidence exists on
the relationship between AKI and long-term clinical outcomes (5, 12), information is limited
which means there is also a degree of uncertainty around the relevant data included in the
model. However an extreme sensitivity analysis was performed to address this limitation and
the main input parameters were changed by ±100% but the conclusion remained stable.
Additional minor assumptions were made in populating the model but none of these were
likely to have a major impact on the final model results.
Despite the limitations highlighted above, a robust decision-analytic model was developed.
The model was informed by clinical guidelines, published literature and expert clinical input,
and any assumptions that were made in this analysis can be rectified by using more robust
data in later studies, as a model now exists for re-analysis once additional information
becomes available.

6. Conclusion
The economic analysis presented in this study has shown that introduction of the DyeVert™
PLUS EZ system has the potential to reduce costs for the UK health care service, and lead to
improved quality of life and clinical outcomes for patients with CKD stage 3-4 undergoing
angiographic procedures.
