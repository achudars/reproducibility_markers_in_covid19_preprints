ABSTRACT

Objectives: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the centromedian thalamic nucleus (CM) is
an emerging treatment for multiple brain diseases, including the drug-resistant epilepsy
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). We aimed to improve neurosurgical targeting of the
CM by (i) developing a structural MRI approach for CM visualisation, (ii) identifying the
CM’s neurophysiological characteristics, and (iii) mapping connectivity from CM-DBS
sites using functional MRI (fMRI).

Methods: Nineteen patients with LGS (mean age=28 years) underwent pre-surgical 3
tesla MRI using magnetisation-prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echoes
(MP2RAGE) and fMRI sequences; 16 proceeded to bilateral CM-DBS implantation and
intraoperative microelectrode recordings (MERs) from the thalamus. CM visualisation
was achieved by highlighting intrathalamic borders on MP2RAGE using Sobel edgedetection. Mixed-effects analysis compared two MER features (spike firing rate,
background noise) between ventrolateral, CM, and parafasicular nuclei. Resting-state
fMRI connectivity was assessed using implanted CM-DBS electrode positions as
regions-of-interest.

Results: The CM appeared as a hyperintense region bordering the comparatively
hypointense pulvinar, mediodorsal, and parafasicular nuclei. At the group-level, reduced
spike firing and background noise distinguished CM from the ventrolateral nucleus;
however, these trends were not found in 20-25% of individual MER trajectories. Areas

Conclusions: In the largest clinical trial cohort of LGS patients undergoing CM-DBS
reported to date, we show that accurate targeting of the CM is achievable using 3 tesla
MP2RAGE MRI. MERs may provide additional localising features in some cases,
however their utility is limited by inter-patient variability. Therapeutic effects of CM-DBS
may be mediated via connectivity with brain networks that support diverse arousal,
cognitive, and sensorimotor processes.

INTRODUCTION

Deep brain stimulation(DBS) of the centromedian thalamic nucleus (CM; also termed
céntre median nucleus) is an emerging treatment for diverse neurological and
psychiatric diseases including epilepsy, Tourette syndrome, neuropathic pain, and
disorders of consciousness[1].

The CM is a spheroid-shaped nucleus approximately 10mm in diameter that forms part
of the posterior intralaminar thalamus together with the parafasicular (PF) and central
lateral (CL) nuclei[1]. Evidence of its connectivity is limited in humans[2]; however,
animal studies show connections with the basal ganglia (chiefly the striatum),
brainstem, and select cortical regions including sensorimotor, premotor, and limbic
cortex[3]. The CM’s connectivity is theorised to play a key role in a range of arousal,
cognitive, and sensorimotor processes[1].

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe form of epilepsy for which CM-DBS has
shown potential efficacy. LGS typically begins in childhood and is characterised by
multiple seizure types, generalised interictal epileptiform discharges on scalp
electroencephalography (EEG), and cognitive and behavioural impairments that worsen
over time[4]. Several placebo-controlled[5 6] and unblinded[2 7-9] trials of CM-DBS
have been performed in LGS, with mixed results. Positive outcomes appear dependent
on accurate positioning of electrodes within the CM[7].

Current opinion within the epilepsy DBS community is that the CM is not directly
visualisable using structural neuroimaging[10]. Instead, pre-surgical targeting is typically

performed indirectly[6 7 9], where a two-dimensional stereotactic atlas of the thalamus,
such as the one published by Schaltenbrand and Wahren in the 1970s[11], is
superimposed on a CT or MRI scan relative to coarse anatomical landmarks including
anterior and posterior commissures.

However, indirect targeting poorly accommodates inter-patient variability in thalamic
anatomy, which can lead to inaccurate placement of DBS electrodes, suboptimal
therapeutic response, and increased frequency of surgical complications and adverse
side-effects[12]. These risks are of particular concern in LGS, given that up to 50% of
LGS patients have structural brain abnormalities[13], with their neuroanatomy likely
deviating from stereotactic-based atlases.

In DBS surgery for other diseases, targeting is commonly aided by microelectrode
recordings (MERs), where electrode positions are refined intraoperatively according to
neurophysiological ‘signatures’ of the stimulation target. For example, in Parkinson’s
disease, MERs show that the subthalamic nucleus is distinguishable from surrounding
structures by changes in neuronal spike firing and background noise[14]. Comparatively
few studies have assessed the utility of MERs in localising stimulation targets for
epilepsy[15].

We aimed to (i) develop a structural MRI approach for pre-surgical visualisation of the
CM in LGS; (ii) assess whether MERs assist with intraoperative identification of the CM;
and (iii) investigate functional connectivity from CM-DBS sites using resting-state fMRI.

Patients

Nineteen patients with LGS (mean age=28 years) were recruited for the Electrical
Stimulation of the Thalamus for Epilepsy of Lennox-Gastaut Phenotype (ESTEL) study: a
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of CM-DBS at Austin Health in

HREC/16/Austin/139). Written informed consent was obtained from each patient’s
parent/guardian.

Pre-surgical MRI

Pre-surgical MRI was acquired in 3 tesla Siemens Skyra scanners. Eight patients were
scanned using a Siemens transmit-receive (Tx/Rx) CP head coil; seven using a
Siemens 64-channel head/neck coil; and four using a Siemens 32-channel head/neck
coil. In all, we acquired a magnetisation-prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echoes
(MP2RAGE) sequence[16], and a magnetisation-prepared rapid gradient echo
(MPRAGE) sequence with intravenous gadolinium contrast; the latter served as the
primary reference for neurosurgical trajectory planning. MP2RAGE differs from
MPRAGE by acquiring two volumes with different inversion times which are combined

into a unified volume that shows improved grey/white matter image contrast[16]. In 14
patients only, resting-state fMRI was also acquired in a separate pre-surgical scan.

MP2RAGE processing for CM visualisation

An edge-detection method (Sobel operator) was used to highlight intrathalamic borders
visible on MP2RAGE. The Sobel operator computes the gradient magnitude at each
image point (i.e., change in signal intensity from one voxel to the next), where areas of
high gradient indicate likely ‘edges’. Voxel intensities within each of the MP2RAGE and
Sobel-processed images were converted to z-scores, and then a novel ‘edge-weighted
MP2RAGE’ image was calculated by summing together the two z-score images: this
weighted each MP2RAGE voxel by its likelihood of indicating a border between areas of
differing signal intensity (i.e., border voxels became ‘brighter’ in the summed image,
whereas non-border voxels became ‘darker’).

Comparison with three-dimensional thalamic atlases

We compared the CM’s location on edge-weighted MP2RAGE to two three-dimensional
atlases in asymmetric Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)152 2009b template space
(Figure 1): the ‘Krauth/Morel' atlas[17], which represents a digital mean across six
specimens of the human thalamus and is available as a set of 72 binary masks; and the
‘BigBrain’ atlas[18], which displays histology of a complete human brain. Comparisons
were achieved by calculating nonlinear spatial warps between patients’ MP2RAGE
scans and MNI space.

For each patient, whole-brain fMRI connectivity was calculated from two spherical
regions-of-interest (ROIs; radius=3mm; one per hemisphere) centred on the DBS
electrode contacts selected for monopolar stimulation (in most patients, the secondmost inferior contact [i.e., contact 1] was selected). MNI coordinates of each ROI are
provided in Table 1. For left- and right-hemisphere ROIs separately, we assessed
whether mean connectivity strength across patients at each voxel was different from
zero using non-parametric one-sample t-tests[19], with significance assessed at
p<0.005 (family-wise error corrected) following threshold-free cluster enhancement[19].
ICN_Atlas software[20] was used to identify the ‘BrainMap’ intrinsic connectivity
networks (ICNs) with which CM-DBS sites showed maximal functional connectivity[21].

DBS and post-surgical reconstruction of lead trajectories

Sixteen patients proceeded to bilateral implantation of quadripolar DBS leads
(Medtronic 3389). Surgical planning was performed using a StealthStation navigation
system (Medtronic, Ireland). Implantations (and thus also MERs) were performed under
anaesthesia maintained using combined isoflurane (0.5-0.7% end-tidal concentration)
and remifentanil (0.1-0.3mcg/kg/min).

The typical trajectory entered the thalamus at the level of the ventrolateral nucleus (VL),
passed through the CL and CM, and terminated near the CM/PF border (Figure 3). CM
target selection used a three-step approach: (i) initial estimation based on established
coordinates[7 9 11]; (ii) estimation of CM outline using the Krauth/Morel atlas[17]
nonlinearly warped to the patient’s brain; and (iii) patient-specific direct targeting of CM
by identifying a hyperintense region on the edge-weighted MP2RAGE image consistent

with locations determined by (i) and (ii). This allowed us to position electrodes such that
2-3 of the 4 contacts were typically inside CM (Table 1).

Post-surgical CT scans were used to confirm accuracy of DBS electrode positions. Lead
trajectories were reconstructed from CT using lead-DBS software v2.1.8.1[22]. To
visualise electrode positions in a common space (Figure 3), reconstructed leads were
warped to MNI space. MNI coordinates of all patients’ DBS electrode contacts are
provided in Table 1.

Intraoperative MERs

Single-channel MERs were acquired with a LeadPoint system (Medtronic, Ireland).
MERs were performed along 32 surgical trajectories from 16 patients, yielding 410
recording sites. Average recording duration across individual sites was 7s (range=312s). An average of 13 MERs were acquired per trajectory, typically beginning 1012mm above the target and advancing in 1mm steps until reaching a depth of 1-3mm
below target. MERs’ anatomical locations were determined by plotting their depths in
mm (with respect to the target) along the CT-reconstructed lead trajectories[22], and
then assigning them to the closest nucleus defined by the Krauth/Morel thalamic
atlas[17].

Most MERs (361/410) were located in three nuclei sampled along the trajectory: 135
were in VL, 170 in CM, and 56 in PF. We excluded the remaining MERs from further
analysis because they were located in other nuclei that each contained <5% of the total
number of MERs. Three-dimensional coordinates of all included MERs are plotted in
Figure 4A.

Comparison of MER features between thalamic nuclei

MERs were analysed offline to assess whether they differentiate the VL, CM, and PF.
For each MER, we computed background noise (using the mode of the signal envelope
approach[23]) and spike firing rate (using the ratio between the number of spikes and
the MER length in seconds[15]).

Using R v3.4.4, we performed group-level mixed-effects analyses to assess whether
MER features varied by thalamic nucleus while accounting for variance due to MER
sampling from different patients. Analyses were performed on log-transformed values of
MER features. Type-II Wald F-tests tested for a main effect of nucleus, with significance
assessed at p<0.05 (Bonferroni-corrected). Post-hoc tests were then used to compare
each pair of nuclei via their estimated marginal means, with significance assessed at
p<0.05 (Tukey-corrected).

To explore whether group-level results were seen at the individual level, we plotted
spike firing rate and background noise for each MER trajectory separately. We only
plotted trajectories where all three nuclei of interest were sampled and where
representative spiking activity (≥5 spikes) was observed for at least one MER site per
nucleus: thus 24 of the total 32 trajectories were plotted.

Intraoperative microstimulation

After MERs, the microelectrode tip was withdrawn to target depth and stimulation was
applied (130Hz, 60μs, 1-6mA) to determine the stimulation threshold at which clinical

motor effects were elicited, reflecting the tip’s position with respect to the internal
capsule[24]. No patients had any clinically detectable movement or change in muscle tone
at <4mA current. At 4-6mA, subtle facial contractions or changes in contralateral limb tone
were observed for three of the 32 target locations. Twelve target locations were
additionally stimulated at higher currents (9-10mA), and similar motor effects were
observed in seven. No target positions were adjusted as a result of these test stimulations.

RESULTS

CM visualisation on edge-weighted MP2RAGE

Orthogonal views of edge-weighted MP2RAGE are provided for six example patients in
Figure 2, and the average across all 19 patients (after warping to MNI space) is
displayed in Figure 1. The CM appeared as a hyperintense region, and on axial views
its medial and posterior boundaries were demarcated by two comparatively hypointense
regions consistent with the mediodorsal and pulvinar nuclei. Coronally, its medial and
superior boundaries were identifiable by two hypointense areas consistent with the PF
and mediodorsal nuclei. Its lateral boundary was less clearly defined, however on select
coronal views a thin descending line of hyperintensity, consistent with the myelin-rich
internal medullary laminae and CL, suggested an approximate lateral extent. The CM’s
location on edge-weighted MP2RAGE visually corresponded with its position
determined by Krauth/Morel[17] and BigBrain[18] atlases. Visualisation was possible
across patients scanned using 64-channel, 32-channel, and Tx/Rx CP head coils.

Across all trajectories (left and right combined), the target coordinates were an average
distance, with respect to the mid-commissural point determined in each patient’s native

brain space, of 8.1mm lateral (range=6.7-10.6), 9.8mm posterior (range=2.4-12.6), and
1.1mm superior (range=-4-2.9); and the trajectory had an average rotational angle of
30.5° from the mid-sagittal plane (range=18.8-42.1) and 50.5° from the axial anterior
commissure-posterior commissure(AC-PC) plane (range=35.3-70.7).

In several patients, our method for CM targeting clearly outperformed the
‘Schaltenbrand and Wahren’ stereotactic atlas-based method[7 9 11], where a twodimensional atlas is superimposed (without nonlinear deformation) on the patient’s scan
with respect to AC-PC landmarks. In particular, for patients with structural abnormalities
(e.g., malformations of cortical development), the Schaltenbrand and Wahren atlas was
grossly inaccurate for thalamic targeting (Figure 5).

Intraoperative MER features

At the group-level, a main effect of nucleus was found for both spike firing rate(F2,306
=10.7, p<0.0001) and background noise(F2,344=4.9, p<0.01). Post-hoc tests (Figure 4BC) showed that spike firing rate was lower within CM relative to VL(t310=4.2, p<0.0001),
and within PF relative to VL(t307=3.5, p<0.01), but no difference was found between CM
and PF(t303=0.4, p>0.9). Background noise was also lower within CM relative to
VL(t345=3.1, p<0.01), but no difference was found between VL and PF(t345=1.8, p>0.1)
nor between CM and PF(t344=0.5, p>0.8).

However, analysis of individual MER trajectories revealed some variability (Figure 6).
Consistent with the whole-group results above, 80% of the individual trajectories
showed lower mean spike firing within CM relative to VL; 80% showed lower mean
spike firing within PF relative to VL; and 75% showed lower mean background noise

within CM relative to VL. However, the remaining 20-25% did not follow these group
trends. Relative differences between nuclei also showed variability: in some cases,
there was a large difference in mean values between the VL and CM and between the
VL and PF, whereas differences in others were more subtle.

fMRI connectivity from CM-DBS sites

Figure 7A displays group-level fMRI connectivity calculated from CM-DBS electrode
positions. For both left and right sides, positive subcortical connectivity was found with
the cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem (midbrain and pons), striatum (caudate and
putamen), and sub-thalamic nuclei. Cortically, positive connectivity was prominent in
auditory cortex, pre- and postcentral gyri, premotor cortex, cingulate cortex, parahippocampal/fusiform cortex, and insular cortex. No areas of negative connectivity were
found. Spatial similarity with ‘BrainMap’ ICNs (Figure 7B) showed that connectivity was
greatest with brain circuits associated with emotional/interoceptive, motor/visuospatial,
cerebellar, and auditory/motor speech processing[20 21]. In contrast, connectivity was
less apparent with default-mode, fronto-parietal, and visual circuits.

DISCUSSION

We aimed to provide a comprehensive account of neurosurgical targeting for CM-DBS
in the largest clinical trial cohort of LGS patients reported to date. We showed that the
CM can be visualised pre-surgically using a novel 3 tesla MP2AGE MRI approach, and
that MERs may in some cases provide additional localising features. Using resting-state
fMRI connectivity calculated from sites of DBS electrode implantation, we also identified
plausible pathways that may mediate therapeutic effects of CM stimulation, including

connections with intrinsic brain networks that normally support a range of arousal,
cognitive, and sensorimotor processes. In addition to immediate clinical applications in
LGS, our findings are relevant to the heterogenous group of neurological and
psychiatric diseases for which the CM is considered a potential therapeutic target[1].

The CM’s position on edge-weighted MP2AGE corresponded with multiple sources of
atlas and histology information[17 18]. Atlas data suggest the CM lies ~10mm lateral to
the midline and is bordered superiorly by the mediodorsal nucleus, medially by the PF,
and posteriorly by the pulvinar (Figure 1). In this location, edge-weighted MP2AGE
showed a hyperintense region, presumably the CM, that bordered comparatively
hypointense structures consistent with the mediodorsal, PF, and pulvinar nuclei.
Visualisation of CM is likely based on the high sensitivity of MP2AGE to intrathalamic
variations in grey and white matter (which appear hypo- and hyperintense,
respectively)[16], and the greater mix of tissue types within CM relative to adjacent
nuclei. This is supported by Nissl preparations of the human thalamus, in which CM is
faintly stained and shows a sparse neuronal cell density of ~2200/mm3, whereas
mediodorsal, PF, and pulvinar nuclei are darkly stained with higher neuronal densities of
~3200-5000/mm3[25 26].

Few studies have described MRI approaches for identifying CM. At high field strength (7
tesla), both susceptibility-weighted imaging(SWI)[27] and track-density imaging(TDI;
derived from diffusion-weighted MRI)[28] have shown potential for visualising multiple
thalamic substructures, including CM. Clinical and safety considerations, including
anaesthesia requirements and the presence of implanted devices, limited the feasibility
of 7 tesla MRI in the patients we studied. Despite this, we acquired SWI and TDI at 3
tesla in a subset of our patients; however, we found the quality of CM visualisation to be

less reliable than edge-weighted MP2RAGE (unpublished data). A study using 3 tesla
proton density-weighted MRI also reported delineation of the CM in controls[29];
however, the need for coarse slice thickness (~3mm) to achieve sufficient signal-tonoise ratio may limit the method’s neurosurgical suitability. Functional approaches for
localising CM, such as task-based fMRI paradigms that activate CM specifically[30] or
thalamic segmentations based on resting-state fMRI connectivity[31], may assist with
refining the visualisation achievable by structural MRI; however, further clinical
validation is needed.

Prior DBS trials have targeted CM using indirect, stereotactic atlas-based approaches[2
5-9]. The results of our study, which illustrate that indirect targeting could in some cases
lead to a gross misplacement of electrodes outside CM (Figure 5), cast some
uncertainty on the accuracy of targeting in prior trials. This may contribute to some of
the variability reported in the efficacy of CM-DBS for epilepsy, where seizure
suppression ranges from 0-100% across different studies[2 5-9]. Given this potential
inaccuracy, outcomes from prior studies may not be directly comparable. Hence it is
important for future trials to use more direct targeting methods, and to report final
electrode positions in a common reference space (e.g. MNI152 2009b space used here;
Table 1).

To our knowledge, the utility of MERs for CM-DBS had not been systematically
investigated before our study. However, our observation of reduced spike firing rate and
background noise in the CM is consistent with a small number of reports in humans[6]
and

attention, arousal, and multimodal sensory processing[1], functions that are presumably
inhibited during states of reduced awareness such as intraoperative anaesthesia. This
is supported by thalamic recordings in patients with disorders of consciousness, where
CM spike firing is lower in vegetative/unresponsive patients than those who are
minimally conscious[33].

However, some caution should be applied when considering the overall utility of MERs
in LGS, given they are not without risks: MERs lengthen surgical time and may increase
the frequency of intracranial haemorrhage[34]. Hence they should only be acquired
when doing so leads to an unambiguous improvement in accuracy of electrode
positioning. Due to inter-patient variability and subtle differences between nuclei in
some cases (Figure 6), MERs did not lead to a refinement of the neuroimaging-based
target in our study. Their utility was further limited by the possible confounding effects of
anaesthesia[35], the impracticality of performing awake recordings in patients with
cognitive impairment, and the lack of established methods for evoking spiking patterns
specific to the CM (as commonly used in Parkinson’s disease, for example, where
passive movement of patients’ limbs alters MER activity within the sub-thalamic nucleus
and can thus assist with target identification). Intraoperative stimulations using the
microelectrode tip (testing for internal capsule effects)[24] also did not lead to a
refinement of our target coordinates. These limitations reinforce the importance of direct
targeting methods for LGS.

The pattern of fMRI connectivity calculated from positions of implanted electrodes
provides new insights into network mechanisms via which CM-DBS may exert
therapeutic effects. Consistent with tracing studies in animals[1 3] and diffusion MRI
tractography studies in humans[2], we found connectivity between the CM and the basal

ganglia, brainstem, and sensorimotor, premotor, and cingulate cortex. We also found
connectivity with additional areas not commonly described in previous studies, including
the cerebellum and insular cortex. Although the analysis approach we used does not
allow us to infer the CM’s directional or modulatory effects, our results support the view
that the CM is connectomically well-positioned to influence networks implicated in a
variety of brain diseases[1]. For example, limbic, basal ganglia, and sensorimotor areas
are affected in some neuropathic pain syndromes[36], while basal ganglia, cerebellar,
limbic, and sensorimotor regions are thought to generate motor and vocal tics in
Tourette syndrome[37].

Interestingly, however, the CM’s pattern of cortical connectivity shows some key
differences to the pattern of brain activation we previously observed during epileptic
activity in LGS. Using simultaneous EEG-fMRI[4] and single-photon emission computed
tomography[38], we found prominent activation of fronto-parietal association cortex
during tonic seizures and generalised paroxysmal fast activity. We also found that,
relative to controls, patients show abnormal fMRI connectivity in the fronto-parietally
distributed default-mode and executive-control networks[31]. In contrast, here we found
that the CM’s cortical connectivity was greatest with sensorimotor, premotor, and limbic
cortex, whereas fronto-parietal connectivity was less apparent.

This result raises the hypothesis that anti-seizure effects of CM-DBS in LGS are not
primarily mediated via direct connections with cortical networks through which the
epileptic process is maximally expressed. One possibility is that CM-DBS modulates
affected cortical areas indirectly, perhaps via dense projections to the dorsal striatum[1],
which in turn connects with prefrontal and parietal cortex; or via sparser projections to
other thalamic nuclei (e.g., reticular, ventral, and anterior intralaminar nuclei)[3], which

likely provide multiple pathways for modulating the cortex more diffusely. This is
supported by a previous study in pigs showing that CM-DBS induces fMRI signal
inhibition in regions the CM directly projects to (basal ganglia, sensorimotor, and limbic
cortex) as well as regions the CM likely influences indirectly, particularly prefrontal
cortex[39].

In contrast to LGS, the epileptic network in genetic generalised epilepsy(GGE) involves
several areas directly connected to the CM. EEG-fMRI studies[40] show that seizures in
GGE prominently activate the striatum and motor/premotor cortex, the CM’s principal
efferent targets[1]. This may partly explain the results of a recent CM-DBS trial in 11
patients with a range of epilepsy syndromes, where the four patients with GGE showed
the greatest mean seizure suppression[6]. Such knowledge of disease-specific
networks may therefore assist with rational selection of patient groups who are most
likely to benefit from CM-DBS.

Accurate targeting of the CM for DBS is achievable using a novel ‘edge-weighted
MP2RAGE’ MRI approach at clinically available field strength (3 tesla). Intraoperative
MERs may in some cases provide neurophysiological indicators of the CM’s location,
including reduced spike firing rate and background noise; however, their utility is limited
by inter-patient variability and impracticality of non-anaesthetised recordings in
cognitively impaired patients. Therapeutic effects of CM-DBS may be mediated via
connectivity with multiple intrinsic brain networks normally associated with diverse
arousal, cognitive, and sensorimotor functions.

FIGURE CAPTIONS

Figure 1: Group-level visualisation of centromedian nucleus on mean edgeweighted MP2RAGE and comparison with thalamic atlases. (A) Mean image
computed across all patients’ (n=19) pre-surgical edge-weighted MP2RAGE scans
following spatial warping to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)152 2009b template
space. Axially (upper row), the centromedian nucleus (CM) appears as a hyperintense
region bordered medially by the comparatively hypointense mediodorsal nucleus (MD)
and posteriorly by the hypointense pulvinar nucleus (PV). Coronally (lower row), the CM
is positioned inferior to the MD and medial to the hypointense parafasicular nucleus
(PF), while the CM’s approximate lateral extent is suggested by a thin line of
hyperintensity consistent with the centrolateral nucleus (CL). It is best appreciated ~3
mm superior and ~6 mm anterior to the posterior commissure (PC). (B-C) Atlas
comparisons. Interpretation: Location of the CM on edge-weighted MP2RAGE showed
good correspondence with the CM’s position determined by ‘Krauth/Morel’[17] and
‘BigBrain’[18] atlases.

Consistent with the group-level mean image (Figure 1), the centromedian nucleus (CM)
appears as a hyperintense region and is best appreciated on axial views (far left two
columns) ~3 mm superior to the posterior commissure (PC), and on coronal views (far
right two columns) ~6 mm anterior to the PC. To assist identification, a binary mask of
the CM from the Krauth/Morel atlas[17] has been nonlinearly spatially warped from
Montreal Neurological Institute space to each patient’s own brain. Outlines of the
resulting patient-space CM masks are displayed for each image in yellow.

width, contact size, and inter-contact distance for the Medtronic 3389 model. Each lead
has four stimulation contacts (C0, C1, C2, and C3) spaced 0.5 mm apart. (B) Example
reconstruction (from post-surgical CT; n=1) showing the typical lead trajectory and
anatomical positions of contacts within thalamic nuclei (defined by the Krauth/Morel

nucleus (CM), with the most inferior contact positioned near the border between the CM
and parafasicular nucleus (PF). (C-D) Bilateral lead reconstructions for all patients
(n=16), shown separately for the left and right CM (shapes in yellow). A sagittal view is
provided for each brain side, as indicated by the directional arrows in the bottom left

Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)152 2009b template space. (B-C) Box plots
showing post-hoc pairwise comparisons of spike firing rate and background noise
(expressed as log values) between the VL, CM, and PF. The lower and upper ends of
each box correspond to the first and third quartiles (i.e., spanning the inter-quartile

the median. The lower and upper whiskers extend to the smallest and largest values no
further than 1.5 times the IQR below the first quartile and 1.5 times the IQR above the
third quartile. Outliers, defined as individual recording values beyond the whisker ends,
are displayed as black circles. Interpretation: Both the CM and PF showed reduced
spike firing rate compared to the VL, while background noise was lower in the CM
compared to the VL (***=p<0.0001; *=p<0.01).

atlas. Indirect targeting based on this method alone would likely lead to misplacement of
deep brain stimulation electrodes outside thalamic targets (e.g., in the examples shown,
some atlas-determined nuclei locations are within cerebrospinal fluid).

Figure 6: Individual-level analysis of intraoperative microelectrode recordings.
Line plots showing spike firing rate and background noise (expressed as log values)
from eight individual example microelectrode recording trajectories (one trajectory is
shown in each row labelled A to H). The x axis of each plot shows the Euclidean
distance (mm) between a given recording site and the ‘final’ site (i.e., values on the left
of each plot are from more superior thalamic sites, whereas values on the right are from
more inferior sites). Recordings are coloured by their thalamic locations defined by the
Krauth/Morel atlas[17] (green, yellow, and red areas=recordings within the ventrolateral
[VL], centromedian [CM], and parafasicular [PF] nuclei, respectively). The dotted
horizontal line within each coloured area indicates the mean value across recordings
within the nucleus. Interpretation: Consistent with the group-level results (Figure 4),
most trajectories showed lower mean spike firing rate in CM and PF relative to VL and
lower mean background noise in CM relative to VL (e.g., trajectories A-F); however, a
minority (20-25%) deviated from the group-level trend in spike firing rate or background
noise (e.g., trajectories G and H).

transformation of voxel-wise p values. The x and z coordinates indicate axial and
sagittal voxel positions (mm) in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)152 2009b space,
respectively. (B) Polar plots quantifying spatial similarity between the connectivity maps
in (A) and each of 20 intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) derived from the ‘BrainMap’
(BM) meta-analytic database of >1800 prior task-related neuroimaging studies[20 21].
Spatial similarity is expressed as a value ranging from 0-1 (larger wedges in the plot
indicate high similarity with the BM ICN; smaller wedges indicate low similarity). Each
wedge is coloured according to the hypothesised functional role(s) of the BM ICN, as
indicated by the figure legend in the lower right. Interpretation: Connectivity of CMDBS

electrode

positions is maximal

with

BM ICNs

that

normally support

emotional/interoceptive, motor/visuospatial, cerebellar, and auditory/motor speech
processing; in contrast, connectivity is less apparent with fronto-parietal, default-mode,
and visual BM ICNs.
