Abstract
Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component. High
heritability of SCZ suggests a major role for transmitted genetic variants. Furthermore, SCZ is
also associated with a marked reduction in fecundity, leading to the hypothesis that alleles with
large effects on risk might often occur de novo. In this study, we conducted whole-genome
sequencing for 23 families from two cohorts, Taiwan and Shanghai, with matched unaffected
siblings and parents. Two nonsense de novo mutations (DNMs) in GJC1 and HIST1H2AD were
identified in SCZ patients. By performing DNM-based burden test, we found that DPYSL2,
NBPF1, SDK1, ZNF595, ZNF718, GCNT2, SNX9, AACS, KCNQ1 and MSI2 genes carried more
DNMs in SCZ patients than their unaffected siblings. Developmental expression analyses
revealed that the loss-of-function DNM genes and DNM-burdened genes showed significantly
higher expression in prefrontal cortex in prenatal stage. The biased high expression of GJC1 and
SDK1 in prenatal stage were preserved in other brain regions and conserved across species. Data
from genome-wide association studies suggested that common variants in the GJC1,
HIST1H2AD and SDK1 genes may contribute to the risks of SCZ and SCZ-related traits.
Analyses on GJC1 revealed that genes co-expressed with GJC1 were involved in SCZ, SCZassociated pathways and drug targets. GJC1 may be a potential target for SCZ in prenatal and
early neurodevelopment.

Introduction
Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder that profoundly affects cognitive, behavior
and emotional processes, yet its etiology and pathophysiology are still largely unknown. The
high heritability of SCZ suggests that genetic risk factors contribute to a significant proportion of
the etiology 1, 2. However, the marked reduction in fecundity in SCZ patients suggests the
removal of risk variants with the largest effects from the population by natural selection. Thus
these variants often occur de novo. Indeed, the strongest genetic risk factors for SCZ identified
so far are de novo large copy number variants (CNV) 3.
The availability of next-generation sequencing permits the detection of de novo mutation (DNM)
events at the genome level. Through large-scale sequencing in parent-offspring trios, DNM have
been increasingly discovered from an array of severe neurodevelopmental disorders, including
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) 4, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) 5 and
epileptic encephalopathy 6. For SCZ, Xu et al. showed a large excess of de novo nonsynonymous
changes and DNMs presented with greater potential to affect protein structures and functions in
SCZ patients 7; Girard et al. reported increased exonic DNM rate in SCZ patients 8; and Fromer
et al. found that DNMs in SCZ implicated synaptic networks and DNM-affected genes in SCZ
overlapped with those mutated in other neurodevelopmental disorders 9. Whole exome
sequencing (WES) was applied predominantly in DNM identification thus far, however, few
DNM studies have been based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) as WES remains a costeffective strategy.
Unfortunately, only 1.22% of DNMs are within exonic regions 10 and meaningful mutations may
occur outside of exons, such as in regulatory elements (i.e. transcriptional promoters, enhancers
and suppressors) thereby altering expression level of governed genes. Similarly, mutations

within exon-intron junction regions may influence splice sites and thus lead to inappropriate
expression of particular isoforms 11. Emerging roles of non-coding RNAs such as microRNA,
circRNA and lncRNA further call for attention to explore DNMs in non-coding regions.
We therefore conducted WGS on two cohorts of Chinese families with matched patient-sibling
to capture all classes of DNMs and to more fully describe the genetic architecture of SCZ. This
study was conducted to identify potential DNMs in SCZ in the Asian population, adding to the
growing body of information regarding ethnicity-specific DNMs.
Methods
Subjects
Subjects were drawn from two distinct cohorts, Taiwan and Shanghai, of Han Chinese origin.
Recruitment of subjects from the Taiwan cohort was described in previous publications 12, 13.
Briefly, families with at least three siblings, two of whom were diagnosed with SCZ, were
recruited in the Taiwan Schizophrenia Linkage Study (TSLS) from 1998 to 2002. All recruited
subjects were interviewed using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS) 14,
accompanied with the Family Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (FIGS)
(https://www.nimhgenetics.org/resources/clinical-instruments/figs/list-of-figs). Final diagnostic
assessment was based on the criteria of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual (DSM-IV), joined with the record of DIGS, FIGS, interviewer notes, and hospital
anamnesis. For the Shanghai cohort, families from the Bio-x SCZ Biobank with at least three
siblings, two of whom were diagnosed with SCZ, were selected. All families from the Bio-x SCZ
Biobank were recruited from the city of Shanghai and the provinces of Hebei, Liaoning and
Guangxi from 2001 to 2003. All individuals with SCZ were interviewed by two independent

psychiatrists and diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria. A total of 23 families (10 from
Taiwan and 13 from Shanghai), with SCZ patients, matched unaffected siblings and parents,
were used in this study (Figure 1). For detailed demographic characteristics of all individuals in
the 23 families, please refer to Supplementary Table 1. All subjects gave written informed
consent with the approval of the local research ethics committees.
Whole genome sequencing
For the subjects of Taiwan cohort, whole blood samples were collected with anticoagulant
(EDTA) tubes and sent to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Repository and
Genomics Resource (RGR). Lymphocytes from the whole blood samples were transformed into
immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines and stored. The DNA samples extracted from the cell
lines were used for WGS. WGS was carried out on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform using
paired-end chemistry with 75 base-pair read length through NovoGene, Inc. (Beijing, China). For
detailed description please refer to previous publication 15. WGS data for the subjects of Taiwan
cohort can be accessed in BioProject of NCBI:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA551447. For the subjects from Shanghai cohort,
whole blood samples were also collected with anticoagulant tubes. DNA was extracted from
blood lymphocytes by standard procedures using FlexiGene DNA kits (Fuji). DNA libraries
were prepared using protocols recommended by Illumina (Illumina, San Diego, CA). WGS was
performed on Illumina HiSeq-X Ten platform with 150 base-pair read length through Cloud
Health Genomics Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
Quality control and variant calling

FastQC (v0.11.8) was used to perform quality checks on all samples across Taiwan and Shanghai
cohorts (Supplementary Figure 1).
The GATK best practices of variant calling were applied to process all raw reads from both
Taiwan and Shanghai cohorts 16. Raw sequencing reads in FASTQ format were aligned to the
GRCh37 build of the human reference genome with BWA-mem 17. Then the aligned reads in
BAM format were sorted, indexed and marked with duplicate reads with Picard Tools. Reads
containing indels were realigned with GATK’s IndelRealigner tool. Next, GATK was used to
perform Base Quality Score Recalibration (BQSR). Quality control after alignment was
performed using Picard (v2.20.4) CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics (Supplementary Table 2).
Variant calling was performed across all samples with GATK (v4.1.1.0) HaplotypeCaller. For
detailed variant calling pipeline, please refer to Supplementary Figure 2.
Kinship analysis, DNM calling and annotation
We used PLINK to perform kinship analysis 18. Briefly, for a given family, if the father was
shown to be within the third degree relative to the mother, the family would be excluded; if the
child was not shown to be the first degree relative to the parents, the child would be excluded.
To ensure the DNM calls with high confidence, three tools, GATK PhyseByTransmission (PBT),
TrioDeNovo (v0.0.6) and DeNovoGear (v.develop), were used to evaluate the calls 19-21. Only
DNMs called by all three tools consistently were considered as candidate DNMs.
PBT was run with the following command:

java –jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -T PhaseByTransmission -R human_g1k_v37_decoy.fasta -V
parent_child_trio.vcf -prior 1.0e-8 -mvf PBT_result.vcf

TrioDeNovo was run with the following command:

triodenovo --ped parent_child_pedigree.ped --in_vcf parent_child_trio.vcf --mu 1.0e-8 --out_vcf
TrioDeNovo_result.vcf

DeNovoGear was run with the following command:

dng dnm --ped parent_child_pedigree.ped –vcf parent_child_trio.vcf -s 1.0e-8 --write
DeNovoGear_result.vcf

After obtaining consistently called DNMs, the following five criteria were applied to retain high
quality calls: (1) quality score is greater than or equal to 30; (2) genotypes of the parents are
homozygotes; (3) genotype of the child is heterozygote; (4) phred-scaled maximum likelihood of
heterozygote for the parents is less than 50; and (5) phred-scaled maximum likelihood of
heterozygote of the child is 0. DNMs with MAF greater than 0.01 in East Asian populations were
further excluded by querying gnomAD (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) and EXac
(http://exac.broadinstitute.org/). Please refer to Supplementary Figure 2 for detailed pipeline of
DNM calling. Remaining DNMs were annotated using ANNOVAR 22.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based Sanger sequencing validation
For the families where candidate DNMs were found, DNA from all members of the family was
subjected to PCR-based Sanger sequencing by capillary electrophoresis according to standard
molecular biology practices (ABI 3130 genetic analyzer, ThermoFisher Scientific). Primer3Plus
was used to design the PCR primers 23. For the GJC1 mutation, the forward primer sequence was
5’-TTAGGTTTGGGTTGGCTCTG -3’ and the reverse primer sequence was 5’CACGGTGAAGCAGACAAGAA -3’. For the HIST1H2AD insertion, the forward primer

sequence was 5’- CTCGTTTTACTTGCCCTTGG -3’ and the reverse primer sequence was 5’ACAACAAGAAGACCCGCATC -3’.
Reactions were performed on an Eppendorf MasterCycler (Eppendorf North America, New York,
USA) under the following cycling conditions: denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles of
95 °C for 15 sec, 55 °C for 20 sec, 72 °C for 30 sec, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min.
Sanger sequencing data was then analyzed using Chromas software
(https://technelysium.com.au/wp/).
Identification of genes implicated by coding DNMs in SCZ
As the spontaneous background mutation rates vary greatly between genes, those carrying
relatively more protein-coding DNMs in cases are not necessarily implicated by DNMs 24. To
identify those genes implicated by protein-coding DNMs or of which the DNMs occurred higher
than the background mutation rates, the R package denovolyzeR was used to analyze proteincoding DNMs based on a mutation model developed previously 24. Briefly, denovolyzeR
estimates underlying mutation rate based on trinucleotide context and incorporates exome depth
and divergence adjustments based on macaque-human comparisons over a ± 1-Mb window and
accommodates known mutational biases, such as CpG hotspots. By applying the underlying
mutation rate estimates, denovolyzeR generates prior probabilities for observing a specific
number and class of mutations (synonymous, missense, nonsense, splice-site and frameshift) for
a given gene.
DNM burden test
To determine whether some genes carry more DNMs in SCZ patients than expected by chance,
we performed the DNM burden test for each gene potentially implicated by DNM. Human brain-

specific gene enhancer information was included from PsychENCODE
(http://resource.psychencode.org/) and human-specific gene promoter information from
Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD, https://epd.epfl.ch//index.php) 25, 26. For a given gene,
DNMs occurred in its gene body, brain-specific gene enhancer and gene promoter regions were
considered as burdens. For a given gene, we compared the number of DNMs mapped to these
regions in SCZ patients with the number of DNMs mapped to these regions in unaffected
siblings, and then assessed the significance of the comparison using 10,000 within-sibship casecontrol label-swapping permutations. P value was calculated as the proportion of permutations
with relative risk (RR) as or more extreme than in the observed data.
Developmental expression of DNM-implicated genes
Multiple lines of evidence showed prenatal maternal infection, malnutrition and stress are risk
factors for SCZ 27-29. The neurodevelopmental model of SCZ posits that a perturbation in early
brain development leads to an altered brain developmental trajectory that is sensitive to
molecular changes associated with development and environmental experience, consequently
converging on the emergence of SCZ in early adulthood 30. It was hypothesized that DNMs
drove dysfunction of genes in early brain development and that this dysfunction confers risks for
subsequent SCZ. To determine whether DNM-implicated genes (loss-of-function DNM genes
and DNM-burdened genes) were involved in early brain development, human brain
developmental expression data from BrainCloud and BrainSpan was evaluated 31, 32. The
expression data of BrainCloud consisted of data derived from the prefrontal cortices of 269
individuals 31, whereas the expression data of BrainSpan consisted of 42 brain specimens across
13 developmental states in 8-16 brain structures 32. BrainCloud expression data was examined by
comparing the expression of a DNM gene in prenatal stage to the expression in postnatal stage

and BrainSpan expression data was evaluated by leveraging the developmental effect scores
curated in a previous publication 33. A developmental effect score measures the effect of age on
expression per gene per brain structure, with a higher developmental effect score of a gene in a
given brain structure indicating a stronger involvement of brain development in that structure. By
10,000 gene label-swapping permutation, P value of a DNM gene for a given brain structure was
calculated as the proportion of permutations with developmental effect scores as or more
extreme than the observed value. DNM genes were then further evaluated in brain developmental
expression data from other species (macaque and mouse) 34, 35.
Genetic susceptibilities of DNM-implicated genes in SCZ and SCZ-related traits
To determine whether DNM-implicated genes are among the loci found by the genome-wide
association study (GWAS) of SCZ or SCZ-related traits, we used GWAS summary statistics
from SCZ 1, ASD 36, ADHD 37, bipolar disorder (BD) 38, major depressive disorder (MDD) 39,
intelligence 40, educational attainment (EA) 41, cognitive performance (CP) 41, and smoking and
drinking 42. The criterion for annotating a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to a given gene
was that the GWAS SNP is located within 10 kb of the gene boundaries.
Co-expression and enrichment analysis
To explore the potential functions or pathological pathways affected by DNM-implicated genes,
expression data from BrainCloud was leveraged by retrieving genes highly co-expressed with the
candidate DNM genes. To identify enrichments in gene ontologic features, biological pathways,
diseases and drug targets, WebGestalt was used (http://www.webgestalt.org/) 43. In WebGestalt,
genes co-expressed with the candidate DNM gene were input as the target gene set and all genes

in the BrainCloud expression data were input as the reference gene set. Enrichments with B-H
FDR-corrected P values less than 0.05 were considered significantly enriched.
Cell-type specific expression analysis
To examine cell-type specific expression of DNM-implicated genes, brain tissue single nucleus
RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data of middle temporal gyrus (MTG), of which the cells have been subtyped from Allen Brain Atlas (https://celltypes.brain-map.org/rnaseq) and single cell expression
data from PsychENCODE were utilized. Single cell expression data from PsychENCODE were
merged from multiple brain regions, including frontal cortex, visual cortex and cerebellar
hemisphere 44. Raw read count data was normalized by log-transformation using R package
Seurat 45. For a given DNM gene, the dominant cell type(s) with high expression were
determined by pair-wise Wilcoxon test.

Results
The goal of our study was to identify DNM disturbed genes, of which the dysfunctions can
contribute to the pathogenesis of SCZ. We identified coding DNM-implicated genes and genes
carrying more DNM burdens in SCZ patients than their unaffected siblings. These DNMimplicated genes were detrimental and subsequent analyses were performed to explore their
pathological effects (Figure 1).
Identification of DNMs and genes implicated by DNMs
To ensure parental unrelatedness and that the children are indeed biological offspring of their
parents, kinship analysis was performed for each individual family. For the Taiwan cohort, one

family (Family ID: 35-04560) was excluded as the father is within the third degree relative of the
mother, one family (Family ID: 35-93405) was excluded as the father was not found to be related
to any of the children and one child in one family was excluded as he was found to be unrelated
to his parents (Individual ID: 35-02497-01) (Supplementary Table 1). Three children from
Shanghai cohort were excluded as they were unrelated to their parents (Individual IDs:
CHG000225, CHG000236 and CHG000246) (Supplementary Table 1).
In this study, 70.71 ± 6.83 de novo point mutations and 6.31 ± 3.64 de novo indel mutations with
high confidence per individual were identified. The observed de novo point mutation rate of
1.145 × 10-8 was consistent with the neutral expectation of 1.140 × 10-8 (P = 0.95, two-sided
exact binomial test) 21. The observed de novo indel mutation rate of 1.022 × 10-9 was consistent
with the neutral expectation of 1.420 × 10-9 (P = 0.50, two-sided exact binomial test) 21. All
DNMs were checked visually by Integrative Genomics Viewer. Overall, the DNMs occurred in
non-coding regions predominantly in intergenic regions (Supplementary Figure 3). No obvious
difference was observed between unaffected siblings and SCZ patients with regards to the
distributions of DNM locations relative to genes (Supplementary Figure 3). The
nonsynonymous-to-synonymous ratio in SCZ patients was not found to be different from the
ratio in unaffected siblings 46, which might be attributed to the limited sample size. Two
nonsense loss-of-function DNMs implicating GJC1 and HIST1H2AD respectively were
identified in SCZ patients (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 4). The two loss-of-function DNMs
were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Figure 6 and 7) and visual verification is
shown in Supplementary Figures 4 and 5. To examine whether the occurrence rates of nonsense
loss-of-function DNMs in GJC1 and HIST1H2AD in SCZ patients were higher than expected by
chance, we compared the nonsense mutation probabilities of GJC1 and HIST1H2AD to those of

all genes calculated in Samocha et al. 47. Nonsense DNMs were not prone to occur in DNA
regions of GJC1 and HIST1H2AD (Supplementary Figure 8). No loss-of-function DNMs were
identified in unaffected siblings on the whole genome scale (Supplementary Table 3).
As DNMs occurred in coding regions may change protein structures physically, we focused on
the DNMs in coding regions to find damaging DNMs (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 3). A
detailed list of these DNMs are shown in Supplementary Table 4. To identify genes implicated
by these protein-coding DNMs, denovolyzeR was used. Due to the relatively small sample size
of this study, Bonferroni correction was used to reduce the false discovery rate. Only GJC1 and
HIST1H2AD carrying nonsense DNMs were significantly identified to be implicated by DNMs
(Supplementary Table 5). We applied another background mutation rate-based model, referred to
as the chimpanzee-human divergence model, which also showed GJC1 and HIST1H2AD were
significantly implicated by the nonsense DNMs (P value = 1.56 × 10-5 for GJC1 and P value =
1.82 × 10-5 for HIST1H2AD) 48. Of note, the GJC1 nonsense DNM was predicted to be
extremely close to the most severe 0.1% of mutations by combined annotation dependent
depletion (CADD) (Supplementary Table 4; mutations with CADD phred-like scores greater
than or equal to 30 is the most severe 0.1% of mutations) 49.
Identification of genes burdened with DNMs in SCZ patients
99% of the DNMs occurred in non-coding regions 10. DNMs occurring in regulatory regions can
potentially disturb the bindings of transcriptional factors and thus influence gene expression. If a
gene or regulatory regions of the gene carry more DNMs in SCZ patients than their unaffected
siblings, this gene may have a role in disease predisposition. Based on this assumption, for a
given gene, we compared the number of DNMs that occurred in brain-specific enhancer,
promoter and gene body in SCZ patients to the number of DNMs in unaffected siblings by

within-sibship case-control label-swapping permutation. Before calculation, to reduce the falsely
identified genes by chance, we excluded genes with low total DNM counts in both SCZ patients
and unaffected siblings (≤ 3). Due to the relatively small sample size, Bonferroni correction was
used to reduce the false discovery rate. Ten genes, DPYSL2, NBPF1, SDK1, ZNF595, ZNF718,
GCNT2, SNX9, AACS, KCNQ1 and MSI2, were identified to carry more DNMs in SCZ patients
than their unaffected siblings. Multiple DNMs implicated enhancers for DPYSL2, NBPF1, SNX9
and MSI2 (Supplementary Table 6), suggesting the dysregulation of these genes, especially in the
prenatal stage, may predispose an individual to SCZ. One single enhancer can regulate the
expression of multiple genes. Therefore, single DNM implicating an individual enhancer can
disturb the expression of multiple genes. We leveraged transcription factor (TF)-enhancer-target
gene linkage data from PsychENCODE to establish the gene regulatory network disturbed by the
DNMs implicating the enhancers identified by DNM burden test (Figure 2). For detailed list of
the DNMs found in the ten genes reported here, please refer to Supplementary Table 6.
Interestingly, no DNM occurred in promoters of the ten genes.
DNMs occurred in genes involving in early brain development
In the following analyses, coding DNM-implicated genes (GJC1 and HIST1H2AD,
Supplementary Table 5) and DNM-burdened genes (Table 2) were served as detrimental DNM
genes to explore their potential functions that are potentially related to SCZ.
Early neurodevelopmental events have been implicated in pathogenesis of SCZ 30. Genes
implicated in SCZ function in processes important to fetal brain development 46, 50. To determine
whether the detrimental DNM genes, including GJC1 and HIST1H2AD implicated by nonsense
mutations (Supplementary Table 5) and genes carrying more DNMs in SCZ patients (Table 2),
involved in brain development, we leveraged the developmental expression data of prefrontal

of the 13 detrimental DNM genes, including the two loss-of-function DNM-implicated genes
GJC1 and HIST1H2AD, and seven DNM-burdened genes DPYSL2, NBPF1, SDK1, ZNF595,
ZNF718, KCNQ1 and SNX9, showed biased higher expression in prenatal stage compared to that
of the expression in postnatal stage (Figure 3). The proportion of 9/12 detrimental DNM genes
with higher expression in prefrontal cortices was more than expected by chance (Supplementary
Figure 9, P = 0.05, hypergeometric test). We next sought to examine whether the involvements
of detrimental DNM genes in PFC development were preserved in other brain regions. The genes
with available developmental data in BrainSpan were analyzed. It was found that GJC1, SDK1
and GCNT2 were still involved in the developments of other brain regions (Supplementary
Figure 10). To examine whether the involvements of detrimental DNM genes in human brain
development were conserved across species, we first queried the brain developmental expression
data of macaque, a primate species evolutionarily close to Homo sapiens. Only DNM genes with
expression data of macaque were analyzed. GJC1, HIST1H2AD, DPYSL2, SDK1 and MSI2
showed higher expression in prenatal stage than the expression in postnatal stage (Supplementary
Figure 11). We then queried the brain developmental expression data of mouse. Since the
developmental data of mouse were limited in postnatal stage, we applied linear regression to
examine the change of DNM gene expression level with time. The expression levels of GJC1,
DPYSL2, SDK1 and AACS significantly decreased with time (Supplementary Figure 12), which
implied their involvements in prenatal neurodevelopment of mouse. Specifically for GJC1,
Leung et al. showed that GJC1 displayed high expression in embryonic stage followed by a
massive postnatal decrease in the rat midbrain-floor, where dopaminergic neurons were mostly
populated 51.

Common variants in detrimental DNM genes may influence risks of SCZ-associated traits
To determine whether the detrimental DNM genes are involved more broadly in SCZ, we asked
whether common variants present in the DNM genes confer risk for SCZ and SCZ-associated
traits. We extracted all SNPs that occur within 10 kb of the DNM genes. For a given trait, the
SNP with the minimum P value mapped to the gene was used to represent the gene risk on the
trait. Genes with minimum SNP P values less than the suggestive threshold of 1 × 10-5 were
considered as risk genes for the trait. Interestingly, except for HIST1H2AD close to HLA locus 52,
the DNM genes influence risk for SCZ-associated traits, including intelligence, educational
attainment, cognitive performance, smoking and drinking primarily (Supplementary Table 7). Of
note, GJC1, HIST1H2AD and SDK1 even confer risks for multiple SCZ-associated traits with
SNPs passed the genome-wide significance threshold of 5 × 10-8.
GJC1 co-expressed with multiple potassium channel genes and is a potentially target for SCZ
Next, we focused on the loss-of-function DNM gene GJC1, a member of the connexin gene
family, which showed strong evidence of SCZ susceptibility (Supplementary Table 8). DNMs in
other brain-associated connexin genes were also found in psychiatric patients (Supplementary
Table 9). GJC1 showed higher expression in prenatal stage than the expression in postnatal stage
in PFC and multiple other brain regions, and its involvement in early brain development was
conserved across species (Figures 3; Supplementary Figures 10, 11 and 12). Moreover, common
variants present in GJC1 confer risks for intelligence, educational attainment, cognitive
performance and alcohol abuse, which were associated with SCZ (Supplementary Table 7) 53-56.
To explore the pathogenic effects of GJC1, we first sought to identify the genes that might be
impacted by the dysfunction of GJC1. We performed co-expression analysis with Pearson

correlation coefficient greater than 0.8 or less than -0.8 in PFC to identify these genes (Figure 4A
and supplementary Table 10). Then we leveraged the genes co-expressed with GJC1 to perform
enrichment analysis to identify functions or pathways involved by GJC1. Interestingly, the genes
co-expressed with GJC1 were enriched in SCZ, SCZ drug zuclopenthixol and SCZ-associated
functions or pathways, including potassium ion transport (Figure 4B and Supplementary Table
11). Of note, multiple potassium ion channel genes were negatively co-expressed with GJC1
(Figure 4A), suggesting their dysfunctions may be subsequent to the dysfunction of GJC1.
To determine whether the expression of GJC1 was specific to a certain cell type, we performed
cell type specific analysis of GJC1 expression. GJC1 was predominantly expressed in
glutamatergic excitatory neurons (Figure 4C and 4D, refer to Supplementary Tables 12 and 13
for pair-wise P values among different cell types derived from Wilcoxon rank sum test). This
should be interesting as glutamatergic dysfunction has long been implicated in SCZ 57.

Discussion
In this study, we used two matched SCZ-sibling family cohorts of Han Chinese origin to
investigate DNMs and DNM-implicated genes in SCZ. By integrating this information with
publicly available data, including brain developmental expression profiles and summary GWAS
statistics, we identified DNM-implicated genes that were involved in fetal neurodevelopment.
These genes may confer risks for SCZ or SCZ-associated traits, and are potential drug therapy
targets for SCZ.
Connexin 45 (Cx45) encoded by GJC1 is a component of the gap junction channel. It is one of
the two connexin genes expressed particularly in neurons 58. Our results showed GJC1 was

expressed predominantly in glutamatergic excitatory neurons in the human brain (Figure 4C and
4D). Particularly for the nonsense mutation case in our study, its occurrence might trigger the
activation of surveillance pathway nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), which reduces
aberrant proteins to be formed 59. The reduction of GJC1 may perturb the co-expressed genes
and thus influence the functions and pathways involved (Figure 4A and 4B). Krüger et al.
reported Cx45-deficient embryos exhibited striking abnormalities in vascular development and
died between embryonic day 9.5 and 10.5 60. Kumai et al. reported Cx45-deficient embryos
displayed an endocardial cushion defect in early cardiogenesis and died of heart failure at around
embryonic day 9 61. Nishii et al. showed mice lacking Cx45 conditionally in cardiac myocytes
displayed embryonic lethality and the requirement of Cx45 for developing cardiac myocytes 62.
This evidence indicates the critical role of Cx45 in embryonic development. Our results showed
that GJC1 displayed biased high expression across multiple brain regions in prenatal stage,
suggesting it is required for neurodevelopment. The high expression of GJC1 in prenatal/early
stage in other species indicated its involvement in development is phylogenetically conserved.
The dysfunction or loss-of-function can cause lethal effects, thereby such mutation would be
eliminated by natural selection in evolution. Interestingly, all potassium ion channel genes were
negatively co-expressed with GJC1. Therefore, the reduction of GJC1 indicates an increase or
overactivity of potassium channels. Miyake et al. reported overexpression of Ether-a`-go-go
potassium channel gene KCNH3 in the forebrain can impair the performances of working
memory, reference memory and attention 63. Ghelardini et al. reported administrations of
potassium channel openers bring out amnesic effect which can be reversed by potassium channel
blockers 64. This evidence suggested the cognitive or memory deficits in the particular case were
caused by increased expression of potassium channel genes subsequent to the reduction of GJC1

activity (Figure 5). The various connexins of gap junctions may be capable of differentiating
between the operation qualities of the cognate synapses defined by the neurotransmitter types 65.
Mitterauer et al. raised a hypothesis that if the function of glial gap junction proteins is lost, the
brain is incapable of distinguishing between the same and different qualities of information
processing and thus cause severe cognitive impairments in SCZ 65. Our findings supports these
hypotheses. Overall, the loss-of-function of Cx45 may be a driver for pathogenesis of some SCZ
cases.
HIST1H2AD, the other nonsense DNM gene close to HLA locus, encodes the member D in
histone cluster 1 H2A family. Studies have demonstrated that several SCZ candidate genes are
especially susceptible to changes in transcriptional activity as a result of histone modification 66,
67

.Therefore, a deficit in the histone itself can implicate multiple SCZ candidate genes. Moreover,

epigenetic regulation effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors were potentially suggested to treat
SCZ 68, which implies the fundamental role of histone in the pathology of SCZ.
Gene level DNM burden test identified a list of genes carrying more DNMs in SCZ patients than
unaffected siblings. Here we show the experimental or clinical evidences demonstrating their
potential association with SCZ. One of the DNM-burdened genes, DPYSL2, is a member of the
collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP) family. CRMP forms homo- and hetero-tetramers
and facilitates neuron guidance, growth and polarity. It also plays a role in synaptic signaling
through interactions with calcium channels. Lee et al. revealed that DPYSL2 was downregulated
in the PFC and hippocampus of prenatally stressed (PNS) adult rats that underperformed in
behavioral tests 69. Bruce et al. conducted potassium channel-targeted SNP association analyses
with SCZ and SCZ-associated phenotypes. rs8234 in KCNQ1, a DNM-burdened gene in our
study, was associated to processing speed 70. Geschwind et al. found that patients with voltage-

gated potassium channel complex antibody (VGKCC-Abs) had particular impairment in memory
and executive functions when they evaluated cognitive function and imaging data in patients
with VGKCC-Abs associated encephalopathy 71. Interestingly, the impaired brain functions
coincide with the two most implicated brain regions in SCZ, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and
the hippocampus 72. Luan et al. reported SNPs in MSI2, another DNM-burdened gene, are
strongly associated with SCZ in the Chinese population 73. In the GWAS of PGC, the SNPs in
MSI2 were also associated with SCZ (Supplementary Table 7). This evidence demonstrated the
efficacy of our DNM burden test by incorporating enhancer and promoter regions into
consideration. It also indicated DNMs contributing to the genesis of disease are not limited in
coding regions, underling the value of WGS.
Except for HIST1H2AD, common variants in these identified DNM genes were not strongly
associated to psychiatric diseases. However, a few of them, GJC1, HIST1H2AD and SDK1, were
strongly associated to SCZ-associated traits, including intelligence, educational attainment,
smoking and drinking. It suggested the significance of these DNM genes in neurodevelopment
and that the lethal mutations occurred in these genes were eliminated by marked reduction of
fecundity in psychiatric patients.
The associations of these identified DNM genes, especially GJC1, with SCZ or related traits
were strongly supported by subsequent functional analysis. However, the results should be
interpreted with caution due to the limited samples in the pilot study. More samples with family
design sequenced at whole genome scale should be incorporated and functional experiments
should be carried out to validate our findings in the future.
In summary, we identified a list of DNM-implicated genes which are involved in prenatal
neurodevelopment. Common variants in these DNM-implicated genes had been previously

reported to be associated with SCZ and related traits in previous GWASs, which is consistent
with our analyses. DNMs implicating the enhancers may contribute to pathogenesis of SCZ by
dysregulating the expression of genes. GJC1 is one of these DNM-implicated genes that is
primarily expressed in glutamatergic neurons and may be involved in the modulation of ion
channel functions, which has also been implicated in SCZ in previous studies 74, 75. Overall, our
study provided new evidence that DNMs have a significant role in SCZ. Further study of these
DNM-implicated genes with functional analyses could lead to better understanding of the
pathology of SCZ.
