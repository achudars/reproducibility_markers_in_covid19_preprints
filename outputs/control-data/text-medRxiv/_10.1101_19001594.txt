Abstract
Objective. To characterize changes in the plasma metabolic profile in newly
diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients upon commencement of
conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (cDMARD) therapy.
Methods. Plasma samples collected in an early RA randomized strategy study
(NCT00920478) that compared clinical (DAS) disease activity assessment with
musculoskeletal ultrasound assessment (MSUS) to drive treatment decisions
were subjected to untargeted metabolomic analysis. Metabolic profiles were
collected at pre- and 3 months post commencement of non-biologic cDMARD.
Metabolites that changed in association with changes in the DAS44 score were
identified at the 3 month timepoint.
Results. A total of ten metabolites exhibited a clear correlation with reduction in
DAS44 score following cDMARD commencement, particularly itaconate, its
derived anhydride and a derivative of itaconate coA. Increasing itaconate
correlated with improved DAS44 score and decreasing levels of CRP.
Conclusion. cDMARD treatment effects invoke consistent changes in plasma
detectable metabolites, that in turn implicate clinical disease activity with
macrophages. Such changes inform RA pathogenesis and reveal for the first
time a link between itaconate production and resolution of an inflammatory
disease in humans. Quantitative metabolic biomarker based tests of clinical
change in state are feasible and should be developed around the itaconate
pathway.

Key Messages
What is already known about this subject?
Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with perturbations in metabolic activity,
which have also been associated with response to certain treatments. In vitro
work on immunometabolism has recently revealed itaconate as a key
metabolite controlling macrophage activation.

What does this study add?
In newly diagnosed RA, commencement of csDMARD therapy is associated
with changes in the levels of ten metabolites (especially itaconate and its
derivatives) that correlate to a corresponding fall in disease activity
Pathway analyses suggest these metabolites are associated with
macrophage activation.

How might this impact on clinical practice?
Changes in metabolite levels in response to treatment provide additional new
insights into RA pathogenesis that suggest a focus on macrophage activation
state. The association of increased itaconate with decreased inflammation
point to possible routes of intervention in RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, destructive, immune mediated
inflammatory condition that predominantly affects synovial joints. In genetically
susceptible individuals, mucosal exposure to external stimuli (e.g. cigarette
smoke)

triggers

persistent

systemic

autoimmunity,

and

subsequent

inflammatory cell articular recruitment, leading to tissue damage (1).
Constitutional features, such as weight loss, malaise or fever are prevalent in
RA patients and RA patients exhibit an increased resting metabolic rate (2),
which may in part be related to increased immune cell activation and turnover.
Many data now suggest that circulating leukocyte subsets exhibit altered
phenotypic and functional properties in the context of RA (3). Chronic synovitis
is associated with angiogenesis and consequent increased mediator release
e.g. prostanoids and chemokines that may be detected in the circulation.
Cardiometabolic disease is a common co-morbidity, reflected particularly in
dysregulation of lipid metabolism (4) and has been attributed to an interaction
between conventional risk factor pathways and systemic pro-inflammatory
cytokines (1). Thus, it is possible that changes in disease activity state may be
reflected in measurable changes in biochemical activity that is demonstrated
through detailed characterization of metabolite profiles.
Metabolomic technologies provide a detailed description of the relative
abundance of individual metabolites within a single tissue or biological system
(5,6). At an individual level, these metabolomic ‘signatures’ are the final
expression of a complex process of gene-environmental interactions, gene and
inflammatory cell activation and protein synthesis (5). Analysing metabolomic
profiles across a group of individuals can offer insights into disease
pathogenesis when common associations with clinical phenotype emerge. The

increased ability to measure quantities of a wide range of different metabolites
has permitted detailed description of metabolic profiles across a range of
complex, polygenic disorders (7). NMR and LC-MS based metabolomics are
being increasingly employed to understand the biochemical changes
associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (5,8–15). For example, plasma
metabolic profiles, obtained using 1H NMR, differentiated patients with different
RA disease activity and showed treatment with TNF-alpha inhibitors modified
the baseline metabolic profiles associated with active RA to resemble those of
patients in remission (16). Further, Serum metabolite profiles obtained using
1H NMR at baseline and at 24 weeks after treatment also distinguished
responders from non-responders to methotrexate treatment (17).
Herein we used an LC-MS platform to characterise changes in the plasma
metabolomic profile in newly diagnosed RA patients commencing first line nonbiologic conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic (cDMARD) therapy.
Through an untargeted approach we aimed to determine whether the levels of
individual metabolites correlated to disease activity following initiation of
treatment and whether changes in disease activity were also reflected in
changes in the level of certain metabolites.

Patients and Methods
Study Population
This study was conducted using clinical data and samples from 79 patients
recruited to the Targeting Synovitis in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (TaSER)
study, a randomised clinical trial that compared the effectiveness of using either
clinical (DAS28) or musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) assessment of disease
activity to drive an intensive early treatment strategy (18,19). Briefly, at
recruitment, all patients had active RA (DAS44>2.4) and both groups followed
the same step-up sequence of DMARD escalation. In the DAS28 group,
treatment was escalated until low disease activity was attained (DAS28<3.2)
and in the MSUS group treatment was escalated until 1 or no joints of a limited
14 MSUS joint set exhibited any power Doppler (PD) signal. At the start of
treatment patients were treated with methotrexate, or sulphasalazine if
methotrexate was contraindicated, and combinations of intra-articular and intramuscular corticosteroids. Disease activity assessments, using the 44-joint
disease activity score (DAS44), were conducted at baseline and every 3
months by a metrologist (AS) who was blinded to group allocation and
treatment. The earliest that study group allocation could influence ongoing
treatment was after 3 months of follow-up. The study protocol was approved by
the West of Scotland Research Ethics Service and was registered with
ClinicalTrials.Gov (NCT00920478). All patients provided written consent to
participate and for their disease activity results and tissue samples to be used
for research purposes. All study activities were conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki.

Sample Collection and Preparation
All patients donated additional blood samples for research purposes at baseline
(group A), 3 months (group B) and 18 months of follow-up (group F) using a
standard operating procedure for sample harvest and processing. Blood was
collected into lithium heparin vacutainers and stored on ice. Samples were
centrifuged at 4oC (1100g, fixed angle rotor) within 4 hours of venipuncture and
500ul aliquots of plasma were stored at -80oC until required for analysis.

Metabolomics
Samples were analysed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography
(HILIC) -mass spectrometry (LC–MS) (UltiMate 3000 RSLC (Thermo Fisher,
San Jose, California, USA) using a 150 x 4.6 mm ZIC-pHILIC column (Merck
SeQuant, Umea, Sweden) running at 300 ll/min and Orbitrap Exactive (Thermo
Fisher) detection. Mass spectrometer parameters were: 50,000 resolving
power in positive/negative switching mode. Electrospray ionisation (ESI)
voltage was 4.5 kV in positive and 3 kV in negative modes. Buffers consisted
of A: 20 mM ammonium carbonate in H2O and B: Merck SeQuant: acetonitrile.
The gradient ran from 20 % A: 80 % B to 80 % A: 20 % B in 900 seconds,
followed by a wash at 95 % A: 5 % B for 180 seconds, and equilibration at 20
% A: 80 % B for 300 seconds.
The LC-MS data was processed using a combination of open source tools run
though R. Vendor-specific raw LC-MS files were converted into the mzXML
open format using MSConvert from the proteowizard pipeline (20). During
conversion the m/z data was centroided. Chromatographic peaks were

extracted from the mzXML files using the centwave detection algorithm from
XCMS and converted to PeakML files. Subsequently, PeakML files
representing replicates were aligned and combined using mzMatch.R (21) after
filtering out all peaks that were not reproducibly detected within groups. The
combined PeakML files were subjected to additional intensity filtering, noise
filtering and gap-filling to produce a set of reproducible peaks. These peaks
were then corrected for instrument drift over time using an in-house Gaussian
process regression algorithm modelled on the pooled samples. Peaks were
manually checked for consistency and integrated using QuanBrowser (Thermo
Fisher) where appropriate. Identifications were based on the Metabolomics
Standards Initiative proposed minimum reporting standards.

Statistical Analysis
Demographic and disease activity outcome data was collected from the TaSER
study records. Tests of significant differences between peak levels were
calculated using t-tests, and controlled for by correcting the p-values for
multiple testing by calculating q-values. Relationships between disease activity
and metabolite levels were modelled using linear regressions and tests of
significance were controlled by calculating q-values. Correlation coefficients
were calculated using Pearson’s product-moment method. Full metabolome
correlation analysis was performed using partial least-squares analysis of the
full set of features on DAS44. Statistically highlighted features were manually
assessed for peak shape to determine if they correspond to genuine metabolite
related signals. Metabolite identification was carried out by first calculating an

accurate molecular formula for the m/z value within 3ppm. This formula was
then compared to a list of authentic standards and assigned as a match if the
retention time and peak shape were comparable. The list of authenticated
standards is included as supplementary material (Supplementary File 1). If
not found in the authentic standards a putative assignment was made based
on the retention time of the feature and the chemistry of the LC column using a
curated list of 41,623 metabolites contained within the IDEOM database
(http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/ideom.html), as detailed by Creek et. al. (22).
The study dataset has been uploaded to the online Metabolights repository
(www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights)

Results
Study Population
Table 1 summarises the baseline characteristics of the patients included in this
study. At baseline, 75 patients commenced methotrexate and 4 commenced
sulphasalazine After 3 months follow-up we detected a significant improvement
in disease activity, with a mean reduction in DAS44 from baseline of 2.1 (SD
1.4). Thirty-five patients were exposed to corticosteroid treatment (1 oral, 9
intra-articular only, 19 intra-muscular only, 6 intra-articular and intra-muscular)
prior to donating research blood samples.

Metabolomic analysis
Plasma from patients was subjected to untargeted metabolomics analysis using
LC-MS (23). A PCA plot (Supplementary File 2) reveals no appreciable global
separation from baseline to 3 months. Nevertheless some individual peak
changes were evident and those relating to the biggest differentiators in the
PCA loadings were checked against lists of common contaminants (24) and
assessed chromatographically as a safeguard against the observed separation
being due to a sample handling/processing factor.

Metabolite Comparisons
Comparisons were performed between individual peaks at baseline and 3
months, to see if there were any significant differences. These comparisons
used a basic t-test to calculate a p-value and log fold-change difference. The
p-values were used to control the false discovery rate, by calculating q-values.
Those differences with a value of q < 0.05 were reported as significant. Out of
3042 peaks in the dataset, 464 were reported as different between baseline
and 3 months. These values can be seen in the accompanying spreadsheet
(Supplementary File 3).

Relationship between changes in metabolite levels and changes in DAS44
To determine whether changes in disease activity were matched by changes in
metabolomic profile, differences in DAS44 and metabolite levels between time
points were calculated, for all patients. A linear regression was then performed,

regressing DAS44 change on change in peak levels, for the baseline to 3
months. Each set of regressions admitted an effect size and p-value. These pvalues were used to control the false discovery rate by calculating q-values.
Between baseline and 3 months, 9 significant effects were found for values of
q < 0.05. A volcano plot of all the peaks is shown in Figure 1, with information
on the significant peaks in Table 2. Indicative plots of these data and models
are shown in Figure 2. E.g. looking at the model for Peak.n.724, the slope of
the line is -0.5, which indicates that a doubling/halving of the concentration after
treatment, is associated with an extra change in DAS44 downwards/upwards
of approximately 0.5. This extra change is on top of the average DAS44 change
in the whole population. Once identified as significant effects, these signals
were manually assessed to determine peak quality and identity (where
possible).

by cis-aconitate decarboxylase (cADC) which is then converted to itaconyl-CoA via
succinate thiokinase (STK). Itaconyl-CoA is converted to citramalyl-CoA by
methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase (MGTK) which is then converted to pyruvate and
acetyl CoA (34) .

In order to verify the feature-by-feature analysis, a partial least-squares (PLS)
analysis was performed on the peak change of the full set of features against
change in DAS44. This analysis indicated one component and zero
orthogonal components. The Q2Y metric was given as 0.125, with a p-value
of 0.01 after 1000 permutations of the samples. The top 9 features from this
analysis corresponded exactly to the 9 features given by the feature-byfeature analysis.
These results were then checked against those peaks that had a significant
difference between baseline and 3 months, to find those peaks where there
was both a significant difference between peak levels in the population, and
also where there was a correlation between the change in DAS44 and the
difference in peak levels. There were three peaks with this property, Peak.p.133
(annotated as ser-ser-ala or gly-ser-thr), Peak.p.209 (annotated as LPC(15:0))
and Peak.n.1157 (mass of 281.7500, retention of 203 s). n.1157 was not
matched to any known metabolite, it presents as a doubly charged [M-2H-]2peak with a predicted formula of C30H61N9O.

included in a number of composite disease activity measures such as
DASCRP-28 and SDAI.

In this study, change in CRP levels correlated

positively with change in DAS44 score (r=0.41, p=9.4x10-4), diminishing as
disease activity reduced. Conversely, change in itaconate correlated negatively
with change in DAS44 (r=-0.49, p=9.6x10-5). Besides being correlated with
DAS44, CRP and itaconate are also negatively correlated (r=-0.44, p=4.9x104

). These associations are shown in Figure 4.

Discussion
Metabolomics is emerging as a tool to identify biomarkers for disease, response
to treatment and also indicators of pathogenesis that may offer routes for novel
interventions. In the past few years a number of studies using both NMR and
mass spectrometry based approaches have been applied to study RA (5–
17,25–27). The use of an untargeted LC-MS platform has several benefits over
the use of other platforms, such as NMR. Whilst the reproducibility and
quantitation provided by NMR allows standardization across laboratories, the
technique is hampered by poor sensitivity and the inevitable overlap of strong
signals (such as water) with weak ones (including many metabolites of interest).
Mass spectrometry is capable of detecting, and identifying, a much broader
range of metabolites and combining it with a suitable LC set up optimised for
small, polar metabolites will provide a much more complete picture of the
metabolome (23). Mass spectrometry also allows for better identification of
unknown metabolites; signals that do not match a known metabolite in any of
the databases (28).

We therefore adopted this approach to seek novel

biomarkers of state and response in patients with new onset RA.
Our results demonstrate a clear association between short term changes in
DAS44 scores and levels of a panel of 9 metabolites. Principal amongst these
is itaconate, its derived anhydride and a putative itaconate coA derivative.
Further, the correlation between DAS44 score and itaconate is slightly more
robust than that between DAS44 score and CRP, indicating the itaconate might
be as good a marker of improved patient status as CRP (both, however,
remaining less good than DAS44 score alone).

Itaconate has recently emerged as a primary moiety of interest in the
pathogenesis of inflammatory disease and macrophage activation to an M1 /
inflammatory phenotype. Initially an ability to inhibit succinate oxidation by
succinate dehydrogenase was proposed as the key driver on its
immunomodulatory effect (29). Recently however, it has been shown that
itaconate impacts directly on the anti-inflammatory transcription factors Nrf2
(30, 31) to underpin its immunomodulatory activity. Itaconate is also the most
pronounced marker of inflammatory arthritis in a murine model (32). A recent
study in the Tg197 murine model of inflammatory arthritis described itaconate
to be a key marker of the disease, and elevated levels were found in afflicted
mice that reversed upon TNF blockade with infliximab (32). In other studies,
itaconate appears to be involved in regulation of inflammation, its elevation
leading, ultimately, to suppression of the inflammatory response (33) and
although functional roles in human inflammatory disease have yet to be
reported, our studies indicate levels are elevated as inflammation is diminished.
Our data reveals increasing itaconate associated with decreasing DAS score
after cDMARD (primarily methotrexate) treatment, which is consistent with its
anti-inflammatory role. However, the analysis in Tg197 mice indicated that
elevated levels of itaconate were found during disease manifestation and these
declined upon anti-inflammatory treatment with the anti-TNFa monoclonal
antibody infliximab. This observation appears to be contradictory to ours.
However, a number of differences between the studies need to be considered.
Our work used human plasma while hind limb tissue extracts and synovial
fibroblast extracts were found to be the optimal material to find metabolite
changes the transgenic mouse model. Our first comparison point to baseline

came at three months while the mouse comparator point was at six weeks and
our study did not include a cohort of healthy controls to compare itaconate
levels at the start of the experiment. Comparing cDMARD based therapy and
biological-based therapy may be another confounding factor since different
therapies work via different mechanisms to diminish inflammation and therefore
may have differing influences on itaconate levels. Notwithstanding, having
demonstrated a clear link between itaconate levels and response to treatment
in RA, future studies using a wider range of variables will ultimately reconcile
our understanding of the role of this pathway in inflammatory disease.
This study cannot distinguish whether itaconate production is a result of
improved condition due to treatment or is in itself responsible for that improved
condition. Nor can it determine what impact exposure to specific treatments has
on itaconate expression. The initial observation requires validation in an
independent RA cohort and within cohorts of patients with other inflammatory
diseases. However, as the first indication that there is a clinically evident
association between itaconate levels and disease activity levels, the need for
additional

to

pharmacologically offers a route to intervention in RA is of major importance.
The findings suggest that further study of the itaconate pathway and
macrophage activity may reveal additional important insights into immune
function regulation and RA pathogenesis and may also reveal new, clinically
relevant, markers of disease activity and treatment response. Finally, this study
provides proof of concept that additional insights to disease pathogenesis can
be identified through analysis techniques that combine highly detailed
descriptions of metabolite expression with clinical data.
