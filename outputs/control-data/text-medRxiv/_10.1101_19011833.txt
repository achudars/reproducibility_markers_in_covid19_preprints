Abstract
Background
Despite recent efforts, a single factor underlying the gut microbiota dysbiosis in intestinal
diseases is not identified. We hypothesized that compromised intestinal barrier (CIB) could lead
to increased host-derived contents including human cells in the gut, change its physio-metabolic
properties, and globally alter gut microbiota and their metabolic capacities.
Results
Consistently, we found human DNA contents (HDCs), calculated as the percentage of
metagenomic sequencing reads mapped to the human genome, were significantly elevated in
colorectal

cancer

(CRC)

patients;

HDC

correlated

with

microbial-

and

metabolic-pathway-biomarkers of CRC, and was the most important contributor to patient
stratification. We found similar results in Crohn’s disease (CD); additionally, patients treated with
diet and drug intervention showed reduced HDC levels over time, and were accompanied by
reversing changes of many CD-signature species.
Conclusions
Our results suggested that host-derived contents may have greater impact on gut microbiota than
previously anticipated, and CIB could be an ideal treatment target that could reverse dysbiosis
globally and precisely.

Background
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 3rd most common cancer worldwide and the 2nd leading cause of
cancer-related death in the United States [1, 2]; in recent years, the incidence of CRC has been

increasing in young adults in major western countries [3, 4]. Similarly, Crohn’s disease (CD) is
also increasing worldwide and can be attributed largely to industrial urbanization and Western
life-styles [5]. As genetics could only explain limited proportions of the CRC [6, 7] and CD [8]
incidences, researchers have recently linked it to environmental factors, life styles and gut
microbiota dysbiosis [8-13]. By contrasting gut microbiome profiles of CRC and CD patients to
that of the healthy controls, researchers have identified bacterial species that were specifically
enriched in CRC [10-12, 14] and CD [13] respectively; many of the CRC-enriched species were
recently found to be consistent across populations, according to two meta-analysis studies [15,
16]. In addition, microbial genes involved in various biological pathways were also enriched in the
gut microbiota of CRC [10, 15, 16] and CD [13] patients. Both the differential species and
pathways can be used as non-invasive markers for patient stratification [10, 11, 13, 15, 16]. These
findings greatly improved our understanding on the potential roles of gut microbiota in the
pathogenesis and/or development of these intestinal diseases, and implied a global alteration of
the local gut environment in the patients. However, a single dominant factor that underlies (e.g.
globally correlates with biomarkers of) the gut microbiota dysbiosis associated with these
diseases has not been identified.
Compromised intestinal barrier (CIB) has been shown to associate with many intestinal
diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) [17] and CRC [18, 19]. CIB could increase
the amount of host-derived contents, including epithelial cells and blood to be shed into feces [20],
alters the physio-metabolic properties of the gut environment [21] and consequently leads to
global alterations in gut microbiota composition (dysbiosis). We thus hypothesized that CIB could

be a major factor underlying the gut microbiota dysbiosis in CRC and CD: the severity of which
may correlate with the extent of the dysbiosis.
Previous researches have detected increased human DNAs in feces from patients of various
diseases using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. For example, patients
with inflammatory or pathogenic agents such as

Clostridium difficile

infection were found with

higher human DNA content in feces and lower microbial diversity [22, 23]. Since fecal
metagenomics are obtained using whole-genome shotgun sequencing and contain unbiased
survey on bacterial, viral and host DNA contents, we could directly calculate the human DNA
content (HDC) as the percentage of the gut metagenomics sequencing reads mapped to the
human genome (see Methods) for each fecal sample and use it as a proxy of CIB.
In this study, we collected eight metagenomic datasets from two most common intestinal
diseases. We confirmed our hypothesis that not only HDC was significantly elevated in the
patients, but also they were significantly correlated with disease-signature species and metabolic
pathways. HDC could improve the performance of patient stratification models, and ranked as the
most important contributing factor. More importantly, we found that HDC can be used as a better
biomarker for effective treatment, because it signified the global recovery of altered species in
Crohn’s disease. Together, our results suggested that host derived contents, as proxied by HDC,
had greater impact on gut microbiota than we previously expected; treatment targeting the source
of increased host contents, i.e. CIB, can reverse gut dysbiosis in a global and precise manner.

Results
Increased human DNA contents (HDCs) in CRC patients.

We first focused on CRC. As expected, we found that HDCs were significantly higher in feces of
CRC patients than that of the healthy controls in all seven datasets (Fig. 1a, Tables S1 and
Tables S2). We identified in total 21 species that were significantly correlated with HDCs in more
than two datasets (Spearman Rank Correlation, Fig. 1b; see Methods and Table S3). Among
which, eleven overlapped with the CRC microbial signatures identified by the two recent
meta-analysis (referred to as CRC-signature species below) [15, 16], including ten CRC-enriched
and one CRC-depleted species (Fig. 1b). We also identified sixteen metabolic pathways that were
significantly correlated with HDCs (Table S4); among which, five were previously identified
metabolic-pathway-biomarkers for CRC (referred to as CRC-signature pathways below). These
results validated our hypotheses that CIB, as indicated by HDCs that can be directly quantified
from gut metagenomics data, underlies the dysbiosis in CRC patients.

Increased HDC underlie altered species and metabolic pathways in CRC and contributed
significantly to patient stratification.
We next tested if HDC and correlated species and pathways (referred as to HDC-species and
HDC-pathways respectively) could contribute to patient stratification in CRC. Similar to Wirbel et

al

[15] and Thomas

et al

[16], we performed a leave-one-dataset-out (LODO) analysis [24] in

which Random forest classifiers were trained on the combined datasets of all but one, and tested
on the one that was left-out; we did this for each dataset in turn. As shown in Fig. 2a and 2c, for
models trained using species and pathways abundances, including HDCs could improve
prediction performance. More importantly, HDC was ranked as the most important feature in
models trained with HDCs (Fig. 2b and 2d). In addition, in the taxonomic-based models, all of the

top ten features were HDC-species (excluding HDC itself if it was used in model training); by
contrast, only six were CRC-signature species described by the previous meta-analyses (Fig. 2b,
see also ref [15, 16]). Similarly, in the pathway-based models, nine out of the top ten features
were HDC-pathways, while six of them were CRC-signature pathways. These results indicated
the HDC-correlated features could contribute substantially to patient stratification and diagnosis.
It’s worth to note that models trained on HDC-species and differential-species identified using
Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test (see Methods) did not differ significantly in their predictive performance
(Fig 2a), implying redundant roles of some species in model training; similar results were found in
HDC-pathways (Fig 2c).

Similar results were found in CD.
We then checked if similar results could be found in CD. A previous study reported elevated fecal
HDCs in pediatric CD as compared with healthy controls [13]; the authors used quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) method to quantify HDCs by targeting human beta-tubulin
coding-sequences. The authors also calculated HDCs from the metagenomics data and reported
that the QPCR results were positively correlated with metagenomics-data-derived HDC values (r
= 0.81 Pearson’s correlation, p = 9.3 x 10-11; see ref [13]). We re-calculated the HDCs using our
methods and found they were highly correlated with theirs (r = 0.977 Pearson’s correlation, p =
4.16 x 10-109; Table S5). These results further validated the reliability and accuracy of
metagenomics-derived HDCs.
We identified 40 HDC-correlated species, most of which were also differential-species
(CD-signature species) that showed significant abundance changes between healthy controls and

untreated patients (Control+Baseline group, Fig 3a, Table S6 and Table S7). We also built
Random forest classifiers using species abundances for CD and did 20 times repeated 10-fold
cross-validation. Similar to CRC, we found that adding HDC to the input data could improve
prediction performance (AUC increased from 0.938 to 0.953); also similar to CRC, we found that
HDC was ranked as the most important feature, and top ten features were all HDC-correlated (Fig
3b). Interestingly, although overlapped significantly, these species are quite different from those in
CRC (Table S8) in terms of their changes and importance in patient stratification (Fig. 3b), likely
due to the fact that CD occurred at the small intestine (ileum) and colon, while CRC occurred at
more downstream of the intestinal tract. Nonetheless, it appears that elevated HDC is a common
feature of intestinal diseases, while different diseases can be distinguished by their different gut
dysbiosis profiles.

HDC signified clinical treatment outcomes and recovery of disease-altered species.
The CD patients were treated with diet intervention and anti-TNF antibodies; the outcomes were
evaluated with fecal metagenomics sequencing at week 1, 4 and 8 after the interventions [13]. We
found that the HDCs were significantly decreased over time (Fig 4a). Strikingly, we found majority
of the HDC-correlated species showed coordinated changes with HDC, i.e. species that were
positively (negatively) correlated with HDC in the Control+Baseline group decreased (increased)
with the decreasing HDCs (Fig. 4b-f, Figure S1), suggesting that the intervention that reduced
fecal HDCs could globally reverse the gut dysbiosis in a species-specific manner. Such a
conclusion was further supported by the observation that the correlations between HDC and
many of the species were consistent in the Control+Baseline, Week1, Week4 and Week8 groups

(Fig 3b). As expected, HDC correlates significantly with fecal calprotectin (FCP; Pearson’s
correlation = 0.518,

p

= 1.4ൈ10-23, Figure S2), a clinical indicator of intestinal inflammation.

However, the correlations between CD-signature species and FCP were much lower than that of
the HDC (Figure S3). These results indicated that HDC is a better biomarker for the disease and
effective treatment.

Discussion
Together, our hypothesis driven method identified compromised intestinal barrier (CIB), indicated
by elevated human DNA contents (HDCs) in feces, as a major factor underlying the gut microbiota
dysbiosis in patients with intestinal diseases. CIB can increase the host-derived contents
including epithelial cells and/or blood to be shed into feces, alter the local gut environment and
lead to gut microbiota dysbiosis. Due to the reciprocal relationship between gut microbiota and
the host [25, 26], the latter may lead to more severe CIB conditions. So far researchers have
mostly focused on the impact of CIB on the host [27-30], much less on the other way round; our
results demonstrated that the increased host-derived contents in the gut due to CIB may have
greater impact on gut microbiota that we previously anticipated. Our results suggested that CIB
could be an ideal target for treatment and intervention: by targeting the molecular processes that
might cause the elevated HDC, and/or reversing the physiological and metabolic changes that
CIB brought to the feces, we should be able to first improve the gut local environments and then
reverse the gut microbiota dysbiosis in a global and precise manner. Of course, more
experiments should be performed on CRC and other intestinal diseases in order to further
validate our results.

We are the first to take advantage of metagenomics-data-derived HDCs and used it as a
valid indicator of patient stratification via meta-analysis.

In silico

removal of host DNAs from

metagenomics data is a recommended procedure [31], however, a quantitative definition of a
contaminated sample is still illusive. Our results indicate that the metagenomics data can validate
itself by looking at the correlated changes in HDC and related gut microbial species: a sudden
increase in HDC without matching alterations in related bacteria is a strong indication of
contamination. This line of reasoning can be applied to any host-produced molecules identified
from feces, such as DNA, RNAs, proteins, metabolites and even cells, and would pave the way
for extracting more host related information directly from fecal samples using multi-omics
techniques and making use of them without worrying too much about contamination. As we have
shown in this study, host related information directly extracted from fecal samples is reliable and
useful.

Conclusions
In summary, we found that compromised intestinal barrier, as indicated by elevated human DNA
contents (HDCs) in feces, is a common feature of intestinal diseases; HDC could be a promising
biomarker for intestinal diseases because it signified the abundances changes of most of
disease-related species, ranked as the top contributor to machine learning models for patient
stratification, and was a better biomarker for effective treatment than fecal calprotectin (FCP).
These results suggested that host derived contents may have greater impact on gut microbiota,
and called for more attentions to be paid to possible impacts of host derived contents to the gut,

the underlying mechanisms, and their possible roles in intestinal diseases, as most of current
research focused on the impacts of gut contents to the host.

Methods
Metagenomics data analysis
A total of 354 CRC patients, 87 CD patients and 382 controls from eight fecal metagenomics
datasets were included in this study. More details, including the nationality and age of these
subjects, can be found in Table S1. To remove adapters and low quality of bases, raw reads were
filtered and trimmed by Trimmomatic [32] v3.6, using the Truseq3 adapter files and option with
MINLEN cutoff 50. To estimate the human DNA contents (HDC) in metagenomics sequencing
reads, the remaining reads (clean reads) were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19)
using bowtie2 [33] (version 2.3.4.3); the HDC of a sample was calculated as the percentage of
mapped reads out of total clean reads in the sample. The human DNA contents measured by
quantitative PCR (QPCR) results in CD dataset were obtained from the corresponding publication
by Lewis and colleagues [13].
Reads mapped to the human genome were removed before subsequent analyses.
Taxonomic abundances of all metagenomic samples were quantified using MetaPhlAn2 [34].
HUMAnN2 [35] was used to calculate relative pathway abundances via mapping reads to
ChocoPhlAn database and full UniRef90 database.
In each project, species with max abundance <1% in all samples as well as species whose
average abundance across all samples below 0.01% were removed from further analyses.

Similarly, pathways with maximum relative abundances less than 1× 10-6 in all samples of a
project were also removed.

Statistics and modeling
All processed data were loaded into R (https://www.r-project.org) and analyzed. Wilcoxon Rank
Sum Test was used to detect significant between-group differences in relative abundances of
taxonomic- and pathway- features; features with P-value < 0.05 were deemed significant.
Spearman correlation was used to find HDC correlated species and pathways, features with
P-value < 0.05 were selected as significantly correlated features.
The SIAMCAT package (https://bioconductor.org/packages/SIAMCAT/) in R was used to
build mathematic classification models (classifiers) that are capable of distinguishing patients and
tumor-free participants, extract features that can be used to discriminate different phenotype
groups and calculate feature importance scores. Random forest algorithm implemented in
SIAMCAT was used for model training and classification.
For the CD data, 20 times repeated ten-fold cross-validation (200 models would be obtained)
implemented in the SIAMCAT package was used to assess the within-dataset accuracy of the
resulting classifiers. For the CRC data, a so-called leave-one-dataset-out (LODO) analysis was
also performed in order to evaluation cross-study performance of the obtained classifiers. In
LODO analyses, all datasets except the one used for model testing were pooled as a training
dataset which would be implemented the within-dataset ten-fold cross-validation; LODO was
performed for each dataset in turn and were repeated 10 times, for all the seven CRC datasets.
The LODO training dataset prediction accuracy was measured through ten times repeated
ten-fold cross-validation.

Fig. 1 | Human DNA contents (HDCs) were significantly elevated in feces of CRC patients, and
correlated with microbial- and metabolic-pathway-biomarkers. a, HDCs, calculated as the
percentage of gut metagenomics sequencing reads mapped to the human genome, were
significantly higher in CRC (dark red box) than healthy controls (grey box) in seven recently
published datasets (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, see Methods). b, Species that were significantly
correlated with HDCs in two and more CRC datasets (Spearman Rank Correlation, see Methods).
Correlations were calculated using both CRC patients and healthy controls. Red: previously
identified microbial- biomarkers of CRC [15, 16]. c, Metabolic pathways that were significantly
correlated with HDCs in three and more CRC datasets. Correlations were calculated using both
CRC patients and healthy controls. Red: previously identified pathway- biomarkers of CRC [15,
16].

Fig. 2 | HDC and correlated species and metabolic-pathways contribute significantly to patient
stratification in LODO analysis in CRC. a, Predictive performances as AUC values obtained using
leave-one-dataset-out (LODO) analysis by training the models on the species abundances. The
AUC values were averaged from repeated results of 10-fold validation analysis. Dif-species:
species whose abundances are significantly different between CRC and controls in at least one
dataset (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, see Methods); HDC-species: HDC-correlated species; see
Methods for details. All-species: models build on all species. b, Ranking of feature importance in
the HDC + All-species model. The models were trained by using HDC values and relative
abundances of all species as input. The importance scores were reported by the LODO models.
The features were ranked according to the median importance scores from 100 repeated results

significantly to patient stratification. a, Species that were correlated with HDCs in the group of
healthy controls and untreated patients (Baseline + Control). Also plotted are the correlation
coefficients between HDCs and species abundances in patients at three time-points after they
were treated (Week1, Week4 and Week8). Correlation coefficients were color-coded according to
their significance levels.
