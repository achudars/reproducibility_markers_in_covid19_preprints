ABSTRACT
Setting: Obesity, once considered an epidemic of the developed world, is now becoming an even more
prominent problem than underweight in low and lower-middle income countries (LLMICs). Ample literature
has shown that as a country’s income increases, the burden of obesity shifts from the rich to the poor. Many
studies have explored the effects of various social determinants of health on obesity, but few have studied the
association between obesity and education. Additionally, while some data exists on the association in men, there
have been limited comprehensive studies focusing on the relationship in the female population of LLMICs.
Objective: Globally, adult females have a higher prevalence of obesity and the obesity shift occurs more
quickly for women than for men. We aim to address this disparity and explore the association of education and
obesity in women.
Design: In this cross-sectional study, we used a multi-national and multi-year database from the publicly
available Demographic and Health Surveys program with data from 34 LLMICs.
Results: Our age-adjusted analysis shows that women in LLMICs with higher education have a significantly
greater prevalence of obesity than women with no education. We analyzed this phenomenon by individual
nations, continents, and income classifications. Educated women living in low income countries are 5.12 times
more likely to be obese than uneducated women (APR, 95% CI=4.75, 5.32) and 3.48 times (APR, 95%
CI=3.37, 3.60) more likely in lower-middle income countries.
Conclusion: These findings highlight a need for more studies and policy attention focusing on female education
levels to understand, predict, and prevent obesity in LLMICs.
ARTICLE SUMMARY
Strengths and limitations of this study
• A rigorous sample size of 836,721 adult females in 34 LLMIC countries was utilized to study the
association between adult female obesity and education level.
• Age-adjusted prevalence ratios of obesity were analyzed based on 34 individual nations, three continents,
and two income categories.
• This study is limited by the relatively small number of countries for which data is available through the
DHS dataset, and thus, further research will be needed to show whether these results are generalizable to
other LLMICs.
• The results cannot be generalized to higher-income countries or to men in LLMICs, and do not account for
intra-national variability.
INTRODUCTION
The worldwide prevalence of obesity has nearly tripled since 1975. [1] Once an epidemic of developed
countries, obesity is becoming increasingly problematic in low and lower-middle income countries (LLMICs),
surpassing the issue of underweight.[1] According to the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors
Study in 2017, high body mass index (BMI) has had a greater relative increase in exposure since 1990 than
most of the other 83 risk factors that were evaluated.[2] Obesity is a primary risk factor for various medical
conditions including ischemic heart disease and stroke, both of which are among the top 5 causes of deaths in
LLMICs.[3; 4] In 2015 alone, overweight and obesity were associated with 4.0 million deaths globally.[5] BMI
is a modifiable risk factor, and thus, obesity is both a treatable and preventable condition. Understanding where
and why it occurs is important in improving health outcomes.
It is well-evidenced that the burden of obesity shifts from the rich to the poor as a country’s income level
increases.[6] In low income countries, the poor are “protected” against obesity, while in high income countries,
they are more susceptible. The shift in obesity has been seen to be associated with wealth, socioeconomic status,
and education.[7] Furthermore, adult females have a higher prevalence of obesity, and the intra-national shift of
obesity from rich to poor occurs more quickly for women.[8] There have been limited comprehensive studies

focusing on the relationship between obesity and education in the female population of LLMICs, and we aim to
address that disparity in this study. We focus on the paradoxical phenomenon between obesity and education in
adult females of LLMICs by analyzing the relationship by individual nations, global regions, and World Bank
income classifications. We hypothesize that this association can be generalized to other LLMICs globally.
Objective
Unlike in high income countries, we hypothesize that higher levels of education are associated with higher
levels of obesity among adult women in LLMICs.
METHODS
Population
Five inclusion criteria were used: (a) Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) results were available since
2008, (b) the survey results included body-mass index (BMI) values, (c) the survey results included education
levels, (d) the country was classified by the World Bank as a “low income” (Gross National Income per capita
of less than 995 USD) or “lower-middle income” (Gross National Income per capita between 996 and 3895
USD) economy,[9] and (e) survey results were from women of reproductive age (ages 15 to 49). Women who
were pregnant were excluded from analysis.

Patient and Public Invovlement
Patient and public involvement (PPI) were not directly included in this study. However, the DHS database used
in the study was developed with PPI in the form of survey responses.
Data Sources
Data were obtained from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program. The DHS program is a multinational and multi-year publicly available database funded by the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID). The DHS program has collected data from greater than 400 surveys in over 90
developing countries or countries receiving foreign aid from the United States. Sample weights were used by
the DHS program to adjust for over- and under-sampling within different regions of each country to ensure
proper representation. Education is categorized as no education, primary, secondary, or higher than secondary
and is reported as the highest level of education attended. Surveys are generally conducted every five years.[10]
Data from the most recent surveys available at the time of analysis were used for this study ranging from 2008
to 2018.
Data Elements
The main outcome variable is body mass index (BMI). The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies
obesity as BMI above 30 kg/m2.[11] Covariate variables including country name, urban or rural category, age,
education level, and household wealth index were studied. Urban or rural category has been explored in our
previous study, showing that urban disadvantage is associated with more obesity than rural disadvantage, and
therefore is omitted in this study. [12] The income class of each country was based on the World Bank Atlas
Method for the 2019 fiscal year.[13] Of the 836,721 surveys available, 109 contained missing records on BMI

and education. Missing data was ommitted from analysis. Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies
in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines were used [14].
Data Sharing: Dataset is available through the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program.
Statistical Methodology
In step one, we used descriptive statistics to explore the data for each of the the 34 countries. The mean (+/- SD)
of BMI was calculated for each country along with the total number of women included in the analysis. BMI of
greater than 60 kg/m2 were excluded from analysis as these values are most likely reported in error. In step two,
the crude prevelance ratio of obesity by education level was caculated at the individual country, continent, and
country income classification levels. Household wealth index and education were found to be colinear variables.
Thus, we excluded household wealth index from our analysis. Finally, a generalized linear model with binomial
distribution and logarithmic link function was used to estimate the age-adjusted prevalence ratio (APR) of
obesity for females with higher than secondary, or high school equivalent, education and females with no
education in LLMICs. Age was adjusted for as a confounding factor due to its variability with different age
groups.[15] In addition to the APR, the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the APR was presented. A two sided
0.05 alpha level of significance was used to determine the statistical significance of the results. A 95% CI of the
APR that does not include one was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed
using SAS software 9.4.[16]
RESULTS
A total of 34 countries fit our inclusion criteria. To analyze the relationship between education level and obesity
in women in LLMICs, we began by searching the DHS database and found data covering 19 low income
countries and 15 lower-middle countries (Table 1). Using this dataset, we compared obesity in women with no
education to those with post-secondary level education to calculate the age adjusted prevalence ratio (APR)
(Figure 1) and confidence interval (CI) for each country.
Our results show that women in LLMICs with higher than secondary education have a significantly greater
prevalence of obesity than women with no education (APR=3.71, CI=3.58, 3.85) (Table 2). We found statistical
significance (P-value < 0.001) of this phenomenon in 28 of the 34 countries analyzed, with the exceptions being
Comoros, Cote d’Ivoire, Sao Tome, Tajikistan, Timor Leste, and Bolivia. After adjusting for age, we found that
highly educated women living in low income countries are 5.12 times more likely to be obese than uneducated
women (APR=5.12, 95% CI=4.73, 5.53). Highly educated women living in lower-middle income countries are
3.48 times more likely to be obese than uneducated women (APR=3.48, 95% CI=3.37, 3.60). The highest
disparity is seen in Burundi (APR of 27.36, 95% CI=13.59, 55.05), and the lowest significant disparities are
seen in Honduras (APR=1.75, 95% CI=1.51, 2.04) and Pakistan (APR=1.50, 95% CI=1.29, 1.75). Of the
nations analyzed in Africa, the average APR is 4.98 (95% CI=4.66, 5.31); in Asia, the average APR is 3.67
(95% CI=3.53, 3.82); and in Latin America, the average APR is 1.67 (95% CI=1.51, 1.88).

DISCUSSION
This study confirmed our hypothesis that, contrary to the findings in high income countries, higher levels of
education are associated with significantly higher levels of obesity among women in the majority of the
analyzed LLMICs. These findings are consistent with available literature.[7; 17-18] The greatest disparities
were found in Africa and in low income countries. The strengths of this study include the large sample size of
nearly 1 million adult females in 34 LLMICs that were analyzed to explore the association between adult
female obesity and education level. Additionally, the study uniquely categorizes the analyses of age-adjusted
prevalence ratios of obesity for each of the 34 nations, three continents, and two income classes.
The study is limited by the relatively small number of countries for which data is available through the DHS
dataset, and thus further research will be needed to show whether these results are generalizable to other
LLMICs. Additionally, our results cannot be generalized to higher-income countries or to men in LLMICs, as
we are complementing the existing literature studying similar relationships among those populations. The
limited available data also does not allow us to account for intra-national variability. It is important to note that
BMI does not distinguish between muscle mass, bone density, and excess fat, and may vary based on body type
and race. However, it is the current best standard for determining obesity and is the metric used by the
WHO.[11] Even with these limitations, the evidence that obesity is more prevalent in women with higher
education in LLMICs is an interesting and important first step towards guiding future research in addressing and
preventing female obesity.
Many factors may be contributing to the relationship found in this study. Higher levels of education may
provide higher income opportunities allowing for greater access to surplus food. Food scarcity is higher in
LLMICs, possibly resulting in lower food intake in the less educated and presumably less wealthy population,
thus “protecting” this population from obesity. Higher education may also provide job opportunities that are less
manual labor-intensive and therefore, less energy expenditure is required. Because of this potential relationship
between education and income potential, we identified household wealth index and education as colinear
variables. The relative contributions of each factor could not be disentangled by our analysis. Further study is
needed to determine the contribution of household wealth on obesity. Additionally, some countries have a
cultural association between higher status with larger female body size, which may contribute to obesity in the
more educated population as studied in countries including Ghana, Tanzania, and Uganda.[19; 20] Studies have
also shown discrepencies between self-perception of normal body weight versus actual overweight and obesity
in developing countries.[21-22]
High prevalence of obesity leads to adverse implications for obesity-related disabilities and mortality, societal
health consequences, and economic consequences. Our results indicate that more educated women in LLMICs
face a higher prevalence of obesity. This knowledge may allow for political implementation of changes to
counter this increase such as incorporating nutrition, accurate body-weight perceptions, and physical fitness into
the education system. Clinicians can also play an invaluable role in educating female patients on proper
nutrition, realistic body-weight perceptions, and increasing energy expenditure.
CONCLUSIONS
The finding that obesity is more prevalent in women with higher education is contrary to what is seen in high
income countries, highlighting a need for more studies and public policy attention focusing on the reasons
leading to the shift of the obesity burden in LLMICs. The multi-factorial relationship between female obesity
and education in LLMICs requires additional investigation to determine the primary causes of this phenomenon
and initiatives to address this problem. As obesity rapidly grows as a public health threat, understanding
associations between obesity and education, particularly in women, will be invaluable in predicting and
preventing the disorder in LLMICs.
