ABSTRACT

54

Objective:Artificial

55

characterization, and monitoring of tumors during cancer imaging. However, major AI

56

explorations in digestive endoscopy have not been systematically planned, and more

57

important, most AI productions are based on Single-center Studies (ScSs). ScSs result

58

in data scarcity, redundancy as well as island effects, which leads to some limitations

59

in applying it on endoscopy. We investigate the disadvantages of picture processing

60

which may effect the AI detection, and make improvements in AI detection and image

61

recognition accuracy.

62

Design: Current investigation aggregates a total of 2,500 gastroenteroscopy samples

63

from various hospitals in multiple regions and carries out deep learning.

64

Results: It is found that factors inconducive to AI recognition are common such as: (a)

65

the gastrointestinal tract is not cleaned up completely; (b) shooting angle (from left to

66

right and the top of polyp are unexposed clearly), shooting distance (too close or too

67

far to shoot causes the lump to be unclear), shooting light (insufficient light source or

68

overexposed light source in mass) and unstable shooting lead to poor quality of pictures.

INTRODUCTION

76

In the year of 2018, the Global Cancer Research Center (GCRC) estimated incidence

77

and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries, and it reported that incidence

78

and mortality rates of colorectal cancer were 10.2% and 9.2%, respectively. Morbidity

79

of colorectal cancer is the third highest and its mortality is ranked as the second1. It is

80

urgent for earlier screening, prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. Previous

81

investigations find that nearly a quarter of existing colonic adenomas could not been

82

detected and diagnosed during a screening colonoscopy, while the percentage is up to

83

40% in recent studies2. Missed adenomas are a consequence of multiple factors such

84

like poor bowel preparation3, insufficient time for colonoscopy withdrawal4, lack of

85

expertise5, multiple polyps. With the development of big data-based artificial

86

intelligence (AI) technology, AI is undeniably valuable in tumor detection,

87

characterization, and monitoring in the diagnosis of lung cancer, brain cancer, breast

88

cancer and prostate cancer6. AI is being leveraged and applied for colorectal cancer as

89

well7-8. A hospital in Yokohama, Japan, has successfully developed a 500-fold

90

endoscope that integrates AI technology to identify cancerous polyps in 0.3 seconds.

91

The reference system makes a real-time judgment on whether the polyp is good or bad,

92

following which the clinician can make EMR or ESD on the spot. It is known that the

93

system uses more than 60,000 tumor cell images of more than 3,000 diagnosed cases

94

in various hospitals in Japan to established database. The automatic cancer recognition

95

function is formed through the deep learning analysis of tumor images in the image

96

database. AI detects abnormalities in the lesions by defining their shapes, volumes, and

97

surface texture. It can accurately measure the size of polyps, which will provide an

98

objective basis for the selection of polypectomy methods. It performs histopathology

99

to assess the disease stage, or analyze spectra to indicate suspected lesions as well as

100

monitor period, which determine the prognosis or response to treatments over time. It

101

greatly shortens the screening time and reduces the subjectivity of the artificial

102

judgment, which will highly improve the tumor diagnosis efficiency as well as

103

prognosis accuracy. Furthermore, it reduces the requirement threshold of the

104

endoscopist experience, which can decrease the misdiagnosis rate of junior doctors. It

105

is beneficial to popularize endoscopic technique in middle and lower level hospitals.

106

Although AI can help clinicians quickly identify and diagnose cancers, several

107

factors limit its broad applications. The premise of AI diagnosis is deep learning that

108

fit data but provide little insight into the process, so reliable and high-quality inputs are

109

mandatory. However, the accuracy of AI feature extraction is affected by the quality of

110

pictures owing to the subjectivity of doctors' diagnosis and the uneven distribution of

111

medical resources in various hospitals, especially the major AI researches of digestive

112

endoscopy have not been systematically planned, which are lack of standardised

113

methods for data collection and most of data are based on ScSs, resulting high data

114

heterogeneity. Above all, data scarcity and island effect is the main problem of AI

115

applications. Then, there is a lack of the robustness and the scalability in AI diagnosis.

116

It is urgent to set standards for specialized AI robots so as to improve the recognition

117

accuracy as well as the diagnosis and treatment efficiency.

121

The current investigation collects a total of 2,500 gastroenteroscopy images from

122

different hospitals in multiple regions. It is found that the factors inconducive to AI

123

recognition are common, for instance, the gastrointestinal tract is not completely

124

cleaned up, and the photography quality is low. It is troublesome to objectively and

125

consistently evaluate the AI diagnostic efficiency in the same level. At present, a

126

multicenter cooperation has been established among the three medical institutions from

127

provincial, municipal and county levels. In order to take advantage of this opportunity,

128

it is suggested that a set of standards should be taken.

129

The requirements of the angle of shooting

130

To take photos from multiple angles of the polyp, fully exposing the root of the polyp

or lump, the base and top of the polyp, and to clear glandular ducts for more information.

132

At least five pictures are mandatory, which include four from left to right and one from

133

the top (Figure 1).

134

Clarity requirements for colonic polyps images

135

The polyp surface should be fully cleaned and rinsed. The process needs to avoid the

patients to do preparation strictly following the guidelines: (a) firstly, carry out fluid

138

diet one day before the operation; (b) then take polyethylene glycol isosmotic solution

140

to make sure that Boston bowel preparation scale (BBPS)9 is above 6 points. (BBPS

141

is shown in Figure 2.)

142

In order to effectively remove the bubbles produced in the intestinal preparation process,

143

dimethyl silicone oil 120-240 mg (3-6 ml) or 30% solution 45 ml is taken with

144

polyethylene glycol during intestinal preparation. Illustrations of incomplete intestinal

under the shakines. It's necessary to set standards to promote the development of

192

diagnosis for colon cancer. We are in the progress of calling on more institutions to

193

establish a multicenter partnership in medical AI. We hope to have more and more

194

experts to elucidate and discuss the application of AI in digestive endoscopy, so that

195

the technology can be more standardized. To promote the development of this industry,

196

AI can truly benefit both patients and doctors.

198

DISCUSSION

199

This result shows that AI recognition to polyps and adenomas can be more accurate by

200

establishing standards to improve the quality of pictures. It requires at least five pictures

201

from left to right and top to expose polyps completely, so as to make sure that no

202

surrounding lesions are missing. The top of polyp is necessary owing to the canceration

203

rate at the top of polyp is higher according to statistics. AI recognition to polyps would

204

be defective owing to the cover of feces and foreign matter, so it’s essential for good

205

preparation of gastrointestinal tract and a detailed history taking. Image acquisition

206

machines with high quality and experienced operators can improve pictures quality.In

207

addition, the shooting light and distance is very important. Small and medium

208

adenomas can be captured completely and recognized. While larger adenoma.should

209

acquire different angles of image by adjusting the body position and shooting angle,

210

because endoscope lens is limited by far image.

211

The study is among the first in China to set rules and regulations for AI recognition. It

212

can be better utilized for identification and improve efficiency. It would provide the

213

basis for digital pathology with AI and promote the development of pathologic

214

diagnosis, gene detection, immunity diagnosis, microbial diagnosis, as well as drug

215

efficacy test, which will benefit the precision oncology and result in personalised care

216

plans for patients10.

217

The development of medical products needs to emphasize ethics and data security. we

218

need to emphasize the data monitoring since errors would require experts to discuss the

219

source. In case machine learning algorithms or robotic systems are designed to use these

220

tools go awry, the end user (the physician or the hospital) is always responsible to

221

determine the responsibilities. The fault is classified as product liability due to

222

equipment failure, and there should be a clear requirement for instructions on how to

223

use and share the data. We currently depend on the institutional review board (IRB) and

224

the ethics committee in the institution to guide these process. Due to the fact that the

225

checks and balances of the IRB are not available in all hospitals and around the world11,

226

we may need laws to standardize the usage of personal data in health care applications,

such like the General Data Protection, to ensure that companies and individuals are

228

always aware of patient privacy12.

229

METHODS

230

The medical ethics committee in Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University approved this

231

study (Serial Number: XMZSYYKY_ER; Acceptance No. ky2019027).

232

We collected 1.6 million gastroenteroscopy images for AI recognization. It is found

233

that 500 images didn't meet the standards by BBPS and visual observation in the

234

random sample of 2,500 images from various hospitals in multiple regions. After strict

235

screening, the collected images will be resized to the appropriate zoom size and RGB

236

channel normalization, then we make segmentation and multi-labels classification of

237

the image. Lastly, input them into the deep learning network.

238

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the gold standard for image analysis. It

239

takes advantage of the local structural relationships in the image and create

240

progressively more complex abstract representations from layer to layer. In comparison

241

with other algorithms, CNNs incorporate very little preprocessing and it learns the

242

filters that were previously hand-engineered in more traditional algorithms. A CNN

243

model was used in this study13. Overall workflow of feature extraction are shown in

244

Figure 8.

tell if a polyp or early cancer from the side view. f, The top of lump is incompletely

318

shown. But this six polyps is not exposed completely.

Figure 2 Clarity requirements based on the BBPS. The BBPS divides the colon into

320

the left colon (including the sigmoid colon and rectum), the transverse colon (including

321

hepatic flexure and splenic flexure of colon), the right half colon (including the cecum,

322

the ascending colon) he cleanliness is into 4 grades: 0 There is solid stool that could not

323

be removed in the colon, and the mucosa could not be seen. It was found in the people

324

who were not prepared before operation.1 The part of the mucosa in the intestinal

325

segment is clearly shown, and some of the mucous membrane is not clearly displayed

326

due to feces and untransparent liquid. 2 There are a small amount of feces and

327

untransparent liquid remaining in the colon, and the mucous membrane is shown to be

328

cleared. 3 all the mucosa showed clear, there is no fecal or untransparent liquid residue

329

in the colon. The score is the sum of the three segment colorectum scores.

Figure 3 Clarity requirements for colonic polyps images.Each picture includes

331

before and after AI identification. a,b,d,Polyp is partially covered with untransparent

332

liquid. c,d,Thepolyp is influenced by air bubble. f,There are still some feces covering

333

in the mucus; I've got something in sight, so we the lump is deficient. BBPS for a/b/d/e

Figure 5 Requirements for shooting distance. a, It's too close that the lump to fully

339

exposed. b,c, It's so far that information about the mass is hidden in the picture, we can't

340

see the details of the mass.

Figure 6 Requirements about photographing machines and technology. a-c, The

342

process of shooting is unstable,so there are some blurred image under the shakiness.

Figure 7 Pictures taken in accordance with this standard. There are six images taken

344

by department of Gastroenterology, Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University, which

345

strictly accords with requirements above. It includes four images taken from the sides

346

and one from the top.See the supplyment for more examples.
