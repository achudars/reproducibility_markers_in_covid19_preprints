Abstract (word count: 247)

Asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) is a common clinical syndrome, yet there is no single objective

definition. We hypothesized that Immunoglobulin E measurements could be used to refine the

definition of ACO. In baseline plasma samples from 2870 subjects in the COPDGene Study, we

measured total IgE levels and specific IgE levels to six common allergens. Compared to usual

COPD, subjects with ACO had higher total IgE levels (median 67.0 vs 42.2 IU/ml) and more

frequently had at least one positive specific IgE (43.5 vs 24.5%). We previously used a strict

definition of ACO in subjects with COPD, based on self-report of a doctor’s diagnosis of asthma

before the age of 40. This strict ACO definition was refined by the presence of atopy,

determined by total IgE >100 IU/ml or at least one positive specific IgE, as was a broader

definition of ACO based on any asthma history. Subjects will all three ACO definitions were

younger (mean age 60.0-61.3), were more commonly African American (36.8-44.2%), had a

higher exacerbation frequency (1.0-1.2 in the past year), and had more airway wall thickening

on quantitative analysis of chest CT scans. Among subjects with clinical ACO, 37-46% did not

have atopy; these subjects had more emphysema on chest CT scan. Based on associations with

exacerbations and CT airway disease, IgE did not clearly improve the clinical definition of ACO.

However, IgE measurements could be used to subdivide subjects with atopic and non-atopic

ACO, who might have different biologic mechanisms and potential treatments.

Many patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) also carry a diagnosis of

1

asthma, termed asthma-COPD overlap (ACO).

ACO has been associated with increased

symptoms, increased exacerbations, and greater healthcare utilization. Given the high

prevalence and clinical relevance, multiple groups have proposed consensus definitions.

2-4

The

Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) and the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease

(GOLD) developed a document that uses lung function and clinical factors to determine if an

individual patient with airways disease has features more consistent with asthma, COPD or the

5

overlap.

However, many of these factors are subjective and may be difficult to apply in

epidemiologic studies or clinical trials.

We have previously reported on ACO within the COPDGene Study, a large observational study

6,7

of smokers with and without COPD.

We defined ACO based on smoking history of at least 10

pack-years, airflow obstruction on spirometry (post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC<0.7 and

FEV1<80% predicted) and self-report of a physician diagnosis of asthma before the age of 40.

Compared to usual COPD, subjects with ACO were younger and were more commonly female

and African American. They have a greater number of COPD exacerbations and less emphysema

and more airway disease on quantitative analysis of chest CT scans.

Asthma, especially asthma with onset in childhood, has a strong atopic predisposition. The

Dutch Hypothesis, put forward in 1961, proposes that there are common host factors for

8

asthma and COPD, including airway hyperresponsiveness and atopy ; disease manifestations

also depend on external factors, such as exposures. Cigarette smoking and atopy likely increase

The finding of a bronchial epithelial type 2 inflammatory gene expression signature in

some COPD subjects suggests shared mechanisms with asthma.

However, since bronchoscopy

is not part of the standard evaluation in COPD or asthma, a bronchial epithelial gene expression

is unlikely to be a clinically-applicable biomarker for ACO.

Therefore, we hypothesized that IgE could be used as a biomarker to refine our previous

definition of ACO, which was based on clinical history and spirometry. To test that hypothesis,

we measured total and specific IgE levels in a subset of the COPDGene Study, examining clinical

and imaging features of subjects with ACO and elevated IgE and/or allergic sensitization.

Methods

Study Subjects

The Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is an observational study conducted at

12

21 clinical centers across the U.S.

COPDGene enrolled non-Hispanic white and African

American subjects with a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years. Subjects with previous lung

resection and other significant lung diseases, except for asthma, were excluded. The baseline

study visit included questionnaires on demographics, medical history, and disease related

quality of life, using the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire.

walk test. Inspiratory and expiratory chest CT scans with quantitative image analysis were used

to assess emphysema (low attenuation areas at -950 HU), gas trapping (-856HU on expiratory

14

scan), and airway wall thickening (wall area percent of segmental airways).

Blood was drawn

15

for genetic analysis and measurement of biomarkers. In the longitudinal follow-up program,

subjects were asked to complete a telephone or web-based questionnaire every six months,

assessing incident comorbidities and COPD exacerbations. Exacerbations were defined by the

16

use of antibiotics and/or systemic steroids for a chest illness

; severe exacerbations led to an

emergency department visit or hospitalization.

All subjects provided written informed consent. The COPDGene Study was approved by the

Institutional Review Boards at all participating centers.

Immunoglobulin E measurements

We selected 2874 COPDGene subjects in four groups defined by the presence or absence of

COPD (FEV1/FVC<0.7 and FEV1<80% predicted, corresponding to GOLD spirometry grades 2-4)

and self-reported asthma: asthma, COPD, ACO and controls. Control subjects had normal

spirometry (FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.7 and FEV1 ≥ 80% predicted) and no history of asthma. Plasma

samples were send to Phadia Immunology Reference Laboratory (Portage, Michigan) for

measurements of total IgE levels and six specific IgE levels using Immunocap assays: cat dander,

dog dander, dust mite (D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus), German cockroach and mold mix. For

10

the specific IgE assays, we selected indoor aeroallergens based on a previous COPD study.

To express total IgE as a quantitative outcome, values less than the lower limit of detection (<2

IU/ml) were set as half the lower limit (1 IU/ml) and values greater than assay (>5000 IU/ml)

were set at the upper limit of detection (5000 IU/ml). We examined two thresholds for elevated

total IgE levels. We used the common clinical cutoff of 100 IU/ml as well as a threshold of 30

17

IU/ml based on the prescribing information for omalizumab,

a monoclonal antibody against

IgE which is indicated for asthma treatment. For five of the specific IgE assays, we defined

positive sensitization by a value >0.35 IU/ml. Mold mix was already reported by the lab as

positive or negative. For subsequent analyses, atopy was defined by a total IgE level >100 IU/ml

or a positive specific IgE to at least one allergen.

Statistical analysis

In subjects with COPD, we defined “broad” ACO by a self-report of asthma and “strict” ACO by

self-report of a doctor’s diagnosis of asthma before the age of 40, as per our previous studies.

6,7

These groups were further subdivided by the presence of atopy, defined by IgE levels as above.

Clinical and imaging features between groups were compared using t-tests or Chi-square tests,

as appropriate. The frequency of exacerbations and the outcome of a severe exacerbation were

analyzed using linear and logistic regression, respectively, adjusted for age, sex, race, smoking

history, and FEV1 percent predicted. Analysis of wall area percent of segmental airways used

linear regression, adjusted for age, sex, race, current smoking, body mass index, and chest CT

scanner model.

Study Subjects and IgE measurements

Of the 2874 subjects selected, four subjects were excluded due to spirometry values that did

not meet the definitions of COPD or control. Table 1 shows characteristics of study subjects

based on COPD and self-report of asthma. Compared to usual COPD, subjects with the broad

definition of ACO were younger and more commonly female and African American. Despite

fewer pack-years of smoking history, they had lower FEV1 and more exacerbations. On

quantitative chest CT scan analysis, they had less emphysema and more airway wall thickening.

Subjects with ACO had higher total IgE levels than usual COPD, as did subjects with asthma

alone compared to controls without airflow obstruction (Table 1). Over 2/3 of ACO subjects had

total IgE >30 IU/ml and nearly 40% had total IgE > 100 IU/ml. In ACO, the prevalence of

sensitization to the six allergens ranged from 14 to 24%, and over 40% of subjects were

sensitized to at least one allergen (Table 1, Supplemental Table 1). These frequencies were

higher than usual COPD, but slightly lower than asthma without COPD.

In each of the four subgroups based on COPD and asthma, we tested for concordance between

having at least one positive specific IgE and an elevated total IgE, using two thresholds

(Supplemental Tables 2, 3). Overall, there was better concordance in the subjects with asthma,

with or without ACO, and there was better concordance using the higher total IgE cutoff of 100

IU/ml. Based on these results, this threshold was used for subsequent analyses. Due to the

18

potential effects of smoking on IgE levels,

we examined the concordance between elevated

total IgE and positive specific IgE stratified by current vs. former smokers (Supplemental Tables

4, 5). A higher proportion of current smokers had both elevated total IgE and at least one

positive specific IgE.

Asthma-COPD overlap

We then examined the various definitions of ACO. Supplemental Table 6 shows the clinical and

imaging characteristics of subjects with the strict ACO definition, based on self-report of

doctor’s diagnosis of asthma before age 40. The results are generally similar to those for the

broad ACO definition based on any self-report of asthma (Table 1) and similar to those that we

7

have previously reported in the entire COPDGene Study.

Of the 831 subjects with the broad definition of ACO, 450 were atopic based on total IgE >100

IU/ml and/or at least one positive specific IgE (Table 2). Compared to subjects with COPD

without asthma and without atopy, the subjects with atopic ACO were younger and more

commonly African American, though there was no longer a gender difference. These subjects

had lower FEV1 and more exacerbations. They had a higher prevalence of chronic bronchitis

symptoms, and more than half reported a history of hay fever. Chest CT scans showed less

emphysema and more airway thickening.

We then examined the 381 subjects with ACO without atopy. Compared to atopic ACO (Table

2), these subjects were more commonly women and non-Hispanic white. They had a greater

lifetime smoking intensity but fewer were current smokers. They had lower FEV1, but

exacerbation rates were not different. This group had a lower prevalence of hay fever

compared to atopic ACO, but higher than COPD without asthma or atopy. Compared to atopic

ACO, non-atopic ACO had more emphysema, but no difference in airway wall thickening. When

subjects with strict ACO definition were subcategorized by atopy, the results were generally

similar to broad ACO with atopy (Table 3).

Figure 1 demonstrates the overlaps between the subjects with asthma, COPD, and atopy. There

is high overlap between asthma and COPD (N=831 broad definition ACO), which was one of the

selection criteria for this COPDGene substudy. As above, a substantial number of subjects with

ACO did not have atopy (N=382). Conversely, there are many subjects with atopic COPD, who

also have the diagnosis of asthma (N=450). Figure 2 shows similar results, using the strict

asthma definition.

Comparison of ACO definitions

We tested three possible ACO definitions for association with exacerbations: COPD with strict

asthma, COPD with asthma and atopy, and COPD with strict asthma and atopy. Each definition

was similarly associated with number of exacerbations (Table 4) or the presence of a severe

exacerbation (Supplemental Table 7) in the year prior to enrollment, using linear or logistic

regression models respectively. Only the first two definitions were significant predictors of

exacerbations or severe exacerbations in the longitudinal follow-up (Table 4). All three

definitions were similarly associated with airway wall thickening on chest CT scans

(Supplemental Table 8).

Discussion

In this study, we measured total and specific IgE levels in a large epidemiologic study of

smokers with and without COPD, which included subjects with a history of asthma. We used

the presence of atopy to refine the definition of ACO, either based on COPD with any asthma

history or our previous ACO definition based on self-report of a doctor’s diagnosis of asthma

before the age of 40. Similar to our previous results, ACO subjects by any definition were

younger, more commonly female or African American, and had similar levels of lung function

6,7

impairment despite lower lifetime smoking intensity.

ACO subjects had more symptoms of

hay fever and chronic bronchitis. Despite different subjects meeting each of the ACO criteria,

each definition was associated with COPD exacerbations and airway wall thickening on Chest CT

scans. IgE levels did not clearly refine the clinical diagnosis of ACO. However, we did identify a

subgroup of ACO without atopy, who were more likely to be non-Hispanic white women with

higher lifetime smoking intensity but less current smoking, lower lung function, more

emphysema but similar airway wall thickening and exacerbation rates.

Previous studies have examined IgE levels in ACO. Soler-Cataluna devised a definition of ACO,

based on expert consensus, that included high IgE as a minor criterion, though no specific IgE

to a panel of allergens largely similar to those in the present study.

In a longitudinal study of

831 COPD patients in Spain, Cosio et al. defined ACO by the GINA/GOLD criteria, augmented

22

with major and minor criteria, the latter of which included total IgE >100 IU/ml.

As expected,

subjects with ACO had higher IgE levels than no ACO. Almost all subjects with ACO continued to

meet criteria at 1 year follow-up and had better survival than non-ACO subjects.

Even when using a strict definition of ACO based on clinical history and spirometry, we found

subjects with and without atopy. Asthma is recognized to be a heterogeneous condition, and

1

our study adds evidence to support that ACO is likely to be heterogeneous as well.

In a study of

109 ACO patients, less than half were considered to have Th2-inflammation, based on blood or

sputum eosinophilia.

Barnes proposed subdividing ACO into eosinophilic, neutrophilic, and

paucigranulocytic subtypes, based on sputum inflammatory cell patterns, and has suggested

therapies for each subtype.

subgroups of asthma and COPD patients, based on sputum cytokines.

Interleukin (IL)-17 is

subjects with an IL-17 bronchial gene expression pattern may be less responsive to inhaled

Agusti et al. introduced the concept of treatable traits, which favors the use of treatable

28

phenotypes over specific diagnostic categories of airway disease, such as COPD or asthma.

Elevated total IgE is a treatable trait in asthma, which can be targeted with omalizumab, a

monoclocal antibody to IgE. Omalizumab has been shown to be effective in the treatment of

We have previously shown that an eosinophil threshold >300 cells/ul had the

strongest association with exacerbations in COPDGene, but had limited overlap with a clinical

32

definition of ACO.

However, the eosinophil counts were measured at the COPDGene Phase 2

(5-year) visit, so we could not directly compare with the IgE levels in this study, which were

measured at the baseline visit.

Besides the inability to directly correlate IgE levels with eosinophil counts, there are several

limitations to our study. We relied on a self-report of asthma, which could be subject to recall

bias or diagnostic misclassification. However, we have used this definition of ACO in previous

studies in COPDGene, identifying both clinical and genetic associations.

33

Our study focused on indoor aeroallegens, since outdoor

allergens may vary more by season and by region in the multi-center study, and since COPD

34

patients usually spend more time indoors.

Perhaps because of the limited panel of specific IgE

tests, we found that elevated total IgE captured the majority of the atopic ACO subjects

(Supplemental Table 3). In future studies, it would be relevant to examine a larger panel of

specific IgE measurements, along with corresponding assessment of allergen exposures, which

was not available in COPDGene.

By measuring total and specific IgE in a study of smokers with and without COPD, we identified

subjects with atopic asthma-COPD overlap, who were similar to subjects with a clinical

definition of ACO. IgE did not improve prediction of exacerbation rates or airway wall

thickening on chest CT scans. Total and specific IgE measurements allowed us to subdivide ACO

subjects into those with and without atopy; the latter were more likely to be white men with

greater lifetime smoking intensity, lower lung function and more emphysema on chest CT

scans. It is likely that atopic ACO subjects represent a subtype of COPD with a different

mechanism of disease risk and progression, who would benefit from alternative therapeutic

considerations. Further investigation using the wealth of molecular data in COPDGene will be

required to identify biologic mechanisms underlying non-atopic ACOS. Currently, IgE levels are

not a standard test in COPD management, nor are they included in consensus definitions for

2,4,5

ACO.

However, peripheral eosinophilia is increasingly recognized as a treatable trait in

28,35

COPD.

Future studies will be required to determine the overlap between atopic ACO and

eosinophilic COPD and whether IgE testing should be considered as part of the evaluation and

management of a COPD patient.

Table 3: Subjects with “strict” asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) and atopy. Strict asthma-COPD overlap is defined by FEV1/FVC<0.7,
FEV1<80% predicted, and self-report of a doctor’s diagnosis of asthma before age 40. Atopy is defined by total IgE>100 IU/ml or at
least one positive specific IgE. Mean (SD) or N (%) is shown.

Strict asthma-COPD overlap is defined by FEV1/FVC<0.7, FEV1<80% predicted, and self-report
of a doctor’s diagnosis of asthma before age 40. Broad ACO is defined by defined by
FEV1/FVC<0.7, FEV1<80% predicted, and self-report of asthma. Atopy is defined by total IgE>100
IU/ml or at least one positive specific IgE. All models are adjusted for age, sex, race, current
smoking, pack-years of smoking and FEV1 % predicted.
