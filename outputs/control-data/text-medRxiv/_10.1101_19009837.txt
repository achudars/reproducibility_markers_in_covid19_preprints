Abstract

Malaria in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) is thought to be hugely caused by Plasmodium
falciparum and very infrequently by P. ovale, P. malariae, with P. vivax not even being
considered to be of any significant role. However, with the availability of very sensitive
diagnostic tool, it has become more clear that, the percentage of non-falciparum malaria in
this sub-region has been underestimated. P. vivax was historically thought to be absent in
sSA due to the high prevalence of the Duffy null antigen in individuals residing here.
Nevertheless, recent studies reporting the detection of vivax malaria in Duffy-negative
individuals challenges this notion. Following our earlier report of P. vivax in Duffy-negative
individuals, we have re-assessed all previous samples following the classical PCR method
and sequencing to confirm both single/mixed infections as well as the Duffy status of the
individuals.
Interestingly, fifteen additional Plasmodium infections were detected, representing 5.9% in
prevalence from our earlier work. In addition, P. vivax represents 26.7% (4/15) of the new
isolates collected in Nigeria. Sequencing results confirmed, all vivax isolates as truly vivax
malaria and their Duffy status to be that of the Duffy-negative genotype. The identification of
more vivax isolates among these Duffy-negative individuals from Nigeria, substantiate the
expanding body of evidence of the ability of P. vivax to infect RBCs that do not express the
DARC gene. Hence, such geno-epidemiological study should be conducted at the national
level in order to evaluate the actual burden of P. vivax in the country.

INTRODUCTION

Malaria is a critical infectious disease of public health importance that provokes
considerable mortality in all endemic countries. The tremendous gains seen in cases and
mortality reduction is as a result of deliberate intervention strategies (1). However, the
observed benefits has seen a plateau in the last two years especially in Africa where the
greatest burden of disease is mostly impacted. In sub-Saharan Africa (sSA), majority (99%)
of the infections is thought to be due to Plasmodium falciparum and very infrequently by P.
ovale, P. malariae, with P. vivax not even being considered in the picture as one of the
players (1). With the availability of tools that are more sensitive, the detection of nonfalciparum and even vivax human malaria parasites has gained more attention in sSA (2–6).

Historically, P. vivax prevails in Asia, (7,8), South America (9,10) and has some scanty
presence in the Horns of Africa such as in Djibouti (11), Eritrea (12), Somalia (13,14),
Ethiopia (15–18) and

Sudan (19,20). Thus P. vivax has a much wider geographical

distribution unlike falciparum malaria which in a more specific term, can be said to have a
much focal distribution in Africa.
Hence, the former notion is that, P. vivax originates from Asia and South America and
gradually finds its way into Africa through the trade-route corridor. However, there are some
current evidences supporting the hypothesis that P. vivax could have originally evolved from
a vivax-like strain detected in non-human primates in Africa (21,22) and from there,
dispersed to other continents during the period of human migration. Although, both
hypotheses (whether from Africa to Asia or Asia to Africa) require further validation.
However, it seems likely that there might be an interplay of both hypothesis, in which case,
simultaneous occurrence takes place and balancing selection of the Duffy negative gene in

sSA might have resulted in the absence of vivax malaria in the region . Nevertheless, later reintroduced when individuals expressing the Duffy gene travels between continents and
countries.

The Duffy (gp-FY; CD234) gene is the fourth red blood cell (RBC) gene after thalassemia,
sickle cell anaemia and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) associated with
resistance to Plasmodium species (23) with particular protection against vivax malaria. Also
known as the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), is a variable receptor usually
expressed on the surface of the red blood cell (RBC) and employed by P. vivax merozoites in
gaining access in the RBCs and establishing its erythrocytic infection (24). The DARC,
located on chromosome 1 has two exons, and a single nucleotide substitution from a thymine
(T) to a cytosine (C), upstream in the promoter region nullifies the expression of this gene on
the RBCs, resulting in the FYO* allele (25). This FYO* null allele predominates amongst
sSA inhabitants as with African-Americans but has a very sparse representation in
individuals of other ancestry (26). Thus, the FYO* null allele has been postulated to confer
protection against P. vivax infection in this sub-region. Nevertheless, 11 countries in this
region (Oboh et al unpublished data) have reported the occurrence of P. vivax, making it
more real that vivax malaria might be gradually finding its way into sSA, thus it can be
postulated that hidden transmission is occurring in this region. In some of these studies, such
as in those conducted in Angola, Cameroon , Kenya, Madagascar, Mali and Mauritania, the
Duffy status of the infected individuals was characterized and they were found to be mostly
Duffy negative (3,4,27–30).

In others,

however, the investigators just stopped at

identification of P. vivax without stating the Duffy status of the infected individuals (5,31–
33). Interestingly, all studies were carried out amongst indigenous individuals with little or no
travel history to vivax endemic areas, ruling out the possibility of imported infection.

In Nigeria, P. falciparum is responsible for > 95% of malaria infection, with P. malariae and
P. ovale contributing a meagre < 5% of infection (1,34). Data implicating P. vivax infection
in Nigeria includes its detection in a visiting pregnant female (35), two microscopical cases
(36,37), both of which were not confirmed by any molecular technique and our previous
study (6) which detected five Duffy negative individuals to be infected with P. vivax isolates
and were subsequently confirmed by capillary sequencing.

Thus, as a follow-up to our previous study, we have re-evaluated all past samples using the
classical PCR method, to confirm additional P. vivax isolates (both single and mixed
infection) by sequencing as well as determined the Duffy status of the individuals. The
importance of such genomic epidemiological studies cannot be undermined in this era of
malaria elimination, as attention also needs to be given to non-falciparum infection, if the
ambitious albeit, achievable 2030 elimination goal is to be reached.

Materials and Methods
Blood samples were collected from symptomatic patients attending four different
hospitals in Lagos (Gbagada, Ikorodu, Akodo and Ikate) and two in Edo (Central and Stella)
states respectively, and quickly subjected to malaria rapid diagnostic test kit, employing the
manufacturer’s instruction (Pf-HRPII- Care Start®, Access Bio Inc, Batch number
M014L04-M014M10) followed by microscopy (results for both not shown here).Two dried
blood-spots per patient (436 in total), irrespective of their status (positive or negative by any
of the technique above) were made on Whatmann® (GE Healthcare, Life Sciences) filter
paper and brought to the ICMR-National Institute of Research in Tribal Health (ICMR-

NIRTH), Jabalpur, India, after obtaining appropriate ethical clearance (IRB/16/347) from the
Nigerian Institute of Medical research.
Employing the Qiagen®kit (the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit; Hilden, Germany), genomic
DNA was re-isolated from all 436 samples and subsequently subjected to nested PCR
diagnostic protocol targeting the 18S rRNA to identify all four Plasmodium infecting species
using primer pairs as designed earlier (Snounou and Singh, 2002) (Supplementary Table
1).For each PCR run, a negative control (nuclease free water) and positive controls
(sequenced confirmed Plasmodium species-for all four species) were added. Additionally, a
part of the Duffy gene promoter region (for isolates that are P. vivax positive) was PCR
amplified and sequenced in order to determine their Duffy status using protocols and primer
sequence detailed in Supplementary Table 2.
Representative isolates of Plasmodium species (P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and P.
ovale) were purified (using FastAP alkaline phosphatase and exonuclease I) and processed for
sequencing by Sanger method (an in-house facility of ICMR-NIRTH, Jabalpur) in both
direction (2X).Sequencing was performed on the purified PCR products in a volume of 10µl
with 0.5µl of Terminator ready reaction mix (TRR), 1.6 pmol of gene specific primer and 5X
reaction buffer with a cycling condition of 96°C denaturation for 10secs (25 cycles),
annealing at 50°C for 5sec and an extension of 60°C for four minutes. Base calling of
nucleotide and chromatogram visualization was achieved with the use of the sequence
analysis software accompanying the DNA analyzer, while sequence alignment was carried
out using BioEdit sequence alignment editor v.7.0.5.3. Contiguous sequence were aligned
with their respective reference strains (P. vivax -SAL-1 accession number U03079.1; P.
falciparum- 3D7 accession umber XR_002273095.1; P. ovale- accession number L48987.1;
P. malariae- accession number NG_011626.30 and, the Duffy gene; accession number
NG_011626.30).

Results and Discussions
Plasmodium genomic DNA was amplifiable in 62.2% (271/436) of the isolates,
representing a 5.9% (15) increase in the PCR amplifiable products from previous study
(58.7%; 256/436) (6), with P. falciparum being the highest detectable species (40%: 6/15),
interestingly followed by P. vivax (26.7%:4/15), P. falciparum/P. ovale mixed infection
(26.7%:4/15) and only one 6.6%)P. malariae was additionally identified. In attempts to rule
out false positive, the gDNA of the newly identified P. vivax isolates were re-extracted and
amplified twice following same protocol earlier used (see supplementary Table 1). Gel
documentation of all newly identified isolates is presented in Figure 1.

Authentication of the PCR results were followed by sequencing (in the forward and reverse

Sequences were edited and aligned (using BioEdit) with their respective reference strain: P.
vivax with the Sal-1 strain (accession number U03079.1), P. falciparum with the 3D7 strain
(accession umber XR_002273095.1), P. ovale (accession number L48987.1) and P. malariae
(accession number NG_011626.30). Surprisingly, all sequences showed perfect homology

(100% similarity) with their references as expected (Figur 2- for P. vivax and supplementary
Figures 1, 2 and 3). This is not unexpected as cases of P. vivax have been identified in many
countries in sSA (3–5,29,33,39–42) including Nigeria (6), where it was thought to be absent
due to the non-expression of the DARC gene on the RBC of majority of the population.Thus,
this is adding to the growing evidence of the proposed gradual incursion of P. vivax into sSA
sub-region (data unpublished).

Figure 2: Multiple sequence alignment of P. vivax isolates and its Sal -1 reference
sequence

In order to discern the Duffy status of those P. vivax infected patients, a portion of the DARC
gene (precisely the promoter region covering the T33C point mutation) was amplified and
sequenced follwing previous protocol (43). Unanticipatedly, all four additional P. vivax
isolates carried a single cytosine (C) peak at the 33rd nucleotide position upstream (Figure 3).
Thus, confirming that none of them expressed the Duffy gene on their RBCs and as such are
Duffy negative. All sequences from the current study have been submitted to Genbank
(……).

the –T33C nucleotide change which validates their Duffy negative status

The identification of more P. vivax isolates among these Duffy-negative individuals from
Nigeria, substantiate the expanding body of evidence of the ability of P. vivax to infect RBCs
that do not express the DARC gene. Although a very recent findings point to another receptor
on the reticulocyte- transferrin receptor 1 as a specific P. vivax receptor (44), which is being

proposed to be an alternate route of entry into the RBCs, this however is subject to further
verification. This is one of the proposition being made to support the observation of P. vivax
in sSA (45). Another hypothesis which relies on the first conjecture (assuming it is agreed
that P. vivax at least possesses alternative invasion pathway), is that the Duffy positive
carriers in northern part of Africa and the Afro-Asiatic populations of Sudan, Somalia (20,46)
and Ethiopia (47,48) serve as reservoir to effect transmission to Duffy negative individuals in
those areas as well as other countries (in sSA) through migration. Albeit, this particular
hypothesis at play here is yet to be determined. One thing is clear here however, that the true
epidemiological situation of P. vivax in sSA in particular and Africa in general is yet to be
ascertained. Therefore, such genetic epidemiological studies should be conducted in other
areas (for example this study covers only two states out of the thirty-six in Nigeria) of the
country as with other sSA countries. This will aid in putting in place appropriate control
strategies to combat the menace of malaria infection in this most affected population (Africa)
and also prevent further spread of P. vivax in Africa.
