Abstract

50

Background: Child eating behaviors (EBs) are highly heterogeneous and their longitudinal

51

impact on childhood weight is unclear. The objective of this study was to characterize EBs

52

during the first ten years of life and evaluate associations with BMI at age 11 years.

53

Method: Data were parental reports of EBs from birth to age 10 years and standardized body

54

mass index (zBMI) at age 11 years (n=12,048) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents

55

and Children. Latent class growth analysis was used to derive latent classes of over-, under-,

56

and fussy eating. Linear regression models for zBMI at 11 years on each set of classes were

57

fitted to assess associations with EBs trajectories.

58

Results: We identified four classes of overeating; low stable (70%), low transient (15%), late

59

increasing (11%), and early increasing (6%). The early increasing class was associated with

60

higher zBMI (boys: β=0.83, 95%CI:0.65, 1.02; girls: β=1.1; 0.92, 1.28) compared to low

61

stable. Six classes were found for undereating; low stable (25%), low transient (37%), low

62

decreasing (21%), high transient (11%), high decreasing (4%), and high stable (2%). The

63

latter was associated with lower zBMI (boys: β=-0.79; -1.15, -0.42; girls: β=-0.76; -1.06, -

64

0.45). Six classes were found for fussy eating; low stable (23%), low transient (15%), low

65

increasing (28%), high decreasing (14%), low increasing (13%), high stable (8%). The high

66

stable class was associated with lower zBMI (boys: β =-0.49; -0.68 -0.30; girls: β =-0.35; -

67

0.52, -0.18).

68

Conclusions: Early increasing overeating during childhood is associated with higher zBMI at

69

age 11. High persistent levels of undereating and fussy eating are associated with lower

70

zBMI. Longitudinal trajectories of EBs may help identify children potentially at risk of

71

adverse weight outcomes.

Introduction

74

Child EBs have received attention, especially due to their potential association with weight.

75

However, previous cross-sectional and a limited number of longitudinal studies produced

76

inconsistent findings. Previous research has suggested that some EBs are stable across

77

childhood, as indicated by moderate correlations between EBs at age 4 and 10.(1) However,

78

some EBs, such as fussy eating, which is the tendency to eat only certain foods and to refuse

79

to try new foods, are common and potentially more transient(2). One third of children show

80

some fussiness during the first four years of life, but many tend to remit by age six with about

81

4% being persistently fussy.(3)

82

Cross-sectional studies (4-6) have primarily suggested that EBs, such as responsiveness to

83

external food cues or emotional overeating are associated with higher child weight. Other

84

EBs, such as fussy eating and responsiveness to internal satiety cues are associated with

85

lower weight (7-9). However, other cross-sectional studies have not replicated these findings

86

(10, 11). Longitudinally, EBs measured at 5-6 years are weakly associated with body mass

87

index (BMI) at about 6-8 years (12) . In earlier ages, between 3 months and 9-15 months, a

88

bidirectional association between child eating and weight has been reported.(13) More

89

recently, the bidirectional association between child eating and later BMI was replicated in a

90

sample of Norwegian children, aged 4 to 8 years(14). Furthermore, children who display

91

fussy eating appear to be at higher risk for developing underweight in childhood, but may be

92

at increased risk for later overweight(15, 16) . However, some studies report no or only weak

93

longitudinal relationships(17-19).

94

Overall, childhood EBs and childhood weight outcomes and the longitudinal development of

95

child EBs remains poorly understood. Longitudinal studies often focus on overall mean

96

scores, ignoring heterogeneity and transience of child EBs. We, therefore, aimed to

97

investigate repeatedly measured EBs in a large population-based birth cohort using latent

98

class modeling to identify longitudinal trajectories during the first ten years of life.

99

Furthermore, we examined their relationship with age- and sex-standardized zBMI at age 11.

100

This age was selected as the outcome measures, due to the proximity to the derived

101

trajectories and to ensure the largest and most representative sample of prepubertal children.

102

Our hypothesis was that persistent EB patterns in childhood would be more strongly

103

associated with child zBMI than transient ones.

104

Methods

105

Participants

106

Data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a population

107

based, longitudinal cohort of mothers and their children born in the southwest of England (20,

108

21) were analyzed. All pregnant women expected to have children between the 1st April 1991

109

and 31st December 1992 were invited to enroll in the study, providing informed written

110

consent. From all pregnancies (n = 14,676), 14,451 mothers opted to take part; by one year

111

13,988 children were alive. When the oldest children were approximately 7 years of age, an

112

attempt was made to bolster the initial sample with eligible cases who had failed to join the

113

study originally (referred to as Phase 2), however these participants were not included in

114

these analyses. The phases of enrolment are described in more detail in the cohort profile

115

papers (20, 21). One sibling per set of multiple births, was randomly excluded from these

116

analyses to guarantee independence of participants.

117

Eating behaviors

118

Repeated measures of parent-reported child EBs were available at a maximum of eight time

119

points around the age of 15, 24, 38, 54, 62, 81, 105, and 116 months. Parents were asked if

120

they were worried about their child overeating (“How worried are you because your child is

121

overeating”), and undereating (“How worried are you because your child is undereating”).

122

The remaining questions probed the child’s tendency to be fussy (“How worried are you

123

because your child is choosy”, “How worried are you because your child has feeding

124

difficulties”, “How worried are you because your child is refusing food”). Parents were given

125

the following response options: “no/did not happen”, “not worried”, “a bit worried” and

126

“greatly worry”. The two top categories (“a bit worried” and “greatly worry”) were combined

127

to avoid very low frequencies.

128

Anthropometric data

129

Weight and height were measured during clinic visits when the children (n = 4,885) were 11

130

years old (mean=128.6 months, SD=1.64). Height was measured to the nearest millimeter

131

with the use of a Harpenden Stadiometer (Holtain Ltd.). Weight was measured with a Tanita

132

Body Fat Analyzer (Tanita TBF UK Ltd.) to the nearest 50g. BMI was calculated by dividing

133

weight (in kg) by height squared (in m). Age- and sex-standardized BMI z-scores (zBMI)

134

were calculated according to UK reference data, indicating the degree to which a child is

135

heavier (>0) or lighter (<0) than expected according to his/her age and sex(22).

136

Covariates

137

The following indicators of socioeconomic status of the family were used: Maternal age at

138

birth (years) and maternal education status (A-Levels or higher, lower than A-Levels) and

139

parental occupational status (manual, non-manual labor of the highest earner in the family).

140

Further birthweight (grams) and gestational age at birth (weeks) of the children were also

141

used. In addition analysis of pre-pregnancy maternal BMI was also considered. The

142

indicators of socioeconomic status were treated as potential confounders for the analyses of

143

zBMI and as predictors of missing data for parent-reported EB data. Details of all data are

146

Statistical analyses

147

Analyses were conducted from October 2017 to May 2018 and included two stages in line

148

with the classify-analyze framework (23).

149

First, Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) was used to identify subgroups (“latent

150

classes”) of children who share the same trajectories of EBs (24). In comparison to Growth

151

Mixture Modelling, an alternative approach to identifying these latent classes, LCGA

152

constrains the variation within each class to zero, reducing the number of parameters and

153

simplifying model estimation (24). LCGA was conducted using Full Information Maximum

154

Likelihood (FIML) (25), incorporating indicators of social class (maternal age, maternal

155

education, and manual or non-manual labor of the highest earner in the family) as auxiliary

156

variables to account for the missingness (including attrition) affecting the longitudinal data,

157

as previously described in ALSPAC (20). FIML assumes data are missing at random (MAR),

158

once these auxiliary variables are accounted for and therefore children with at least one

159

measure of eating behavior at any time point. Analyses were stratified by sex to examine

160

possible effect modification. Stratified results were compared against unstratified using

161

combined data using Likelihood Ratio Tests. As the number of classes is not directly

162

estimated, alternative specifications with increasing number of assumed classes were

163

compared using the following model fit indicators: Akaike Information Criterion (AIC),

164

Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), adjusted Bayesian information Criterion (adj BIC),

165

selecting the lowest values, and entropy, aiming for the highest. In addition to these model fit

166

indicators, the class size and interpretability of the classes were taken into account as

167

recommended by Muthén (25). After selection of the best number of classes, estimations

168

were repeated using 1000 random starts to avoid local maxima.

169

In the second stage, participants were allocated to their most likely classes according to their

170

posterior probabilities using the maximum-probability assignment rule (26). These predicted

171

classes were then included as explanatory variables in regression analyses of zBMI scores at

172

age 11, which also controlled for the following a priori confounders: maternal age,

173

gestational age, birthweight, and maternal education at birth. Results are reported in terms of

174

adjusted regression coefficients (β) for each class in comparison to the first (reference) class.

175

Since not all children with EB data had data on zBMI, because of attrition affecting later

176

ages, the characteristics of study participants with/without zBMI were compared in order to

177

assess their representativeness of the original study membership. LCGA was conducted in

178

MPlus Version 8 (27). Regression analyses were conducted in Stata 15 (28).

179

Ethical approval

180

Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee

181

and the Local Research Ethics Committees. All procedures were performed in accordance

182

with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later

183

amendments.

Results

191

Summary statistics of the study population at baseline are listed in Table 1. Prevalence of the

192

different EBs varied at the different time points (Figure 1). Overeating was uncommon, with

193

the majority of parents reporting that their children never engaged in this behavior (77-85%

194

across the 8 time points). Being choosy about food was the most common child behavior,

195

especially at 54 months, when a fifth of the children were described as choosy to a worrying

196

extent.

Eating behavior classes

200

Comparisons of alternative number of classes for the three LGCA models identified four

201

classes for the overeating longitudinal data, and six classes for both undereating and fussy

202

eating according to our pre-specified criteria (eTable 1a-c). Overall, separate models for boys

203

and girls fit the data better than when analyzed jointly (eTable 2).

204

Most children were assigned to the “low stable” class of overeating, marked by the absence

205

of high levels of overeating across time points (Figure 2). Undereating was more

206

heterogeneous; the most common class was “low transient”, characterized by low levels of

207

undereating, which attenuated completely by age 10. Similarly, the most common class for

208

fussy eating was the “low transient” group, with increasing numbers of parents reporting

209

fussy eating beginning at around 3 years. Figure 3a-c illustrates the class trajectories for

210

overeating, undereating, and fussy eating.

211

When comparing maternal and gestational age at birth, birthweight, and maternal education

212

across classes we found that, for overeating, boys and girls in the “early increasing“ class had

a higher mean birthweight than those in the “low stable” class; eTable 3). Children in the

214

“high stable” class of undereating and fussy eating had a lower mean birthweight than their

215

respective “low stable” classes. In addition, the percentage of mothers with A-Levels or

216

university degree was lower in the “low stable” class of fussy eating compared to the “high

217

stable”. Child zBMI scores per eating behavior class ranged widely within all classes

218

(eFigure 1a-b).

Sensitivity analyses

222

Not all children included in LCGA had zBMI data at 11 years. Class frequencies derived

223

from all participants were compared to the frequencies among the children who had complete

224

BMI data at 11 years. Class sizes and distributions were similar (eTable 5).

225

Association between EBs and zBMI at age 11

226

Overeating

227

In comparison to children who were reported to never overeat (“low stable”), all other classes

228

were positively associated with greater zBMI at the later age of 11 years: “low transient”

229

(boys: coefficient β=0.26, 95%CI:0.13, 0.39; girls: β=0.32, 95%CI: 0.19, 0.44), “late

230

increasing” (boys: β = 0.94, 95%CI: 0.8, 1.09; girls: β=0.94, 95%CI: 0.82, 1.07) and “early

231

increasing” (boys: β=0.83, 95%CI: 0.65, 1.02; girls: β=1.1, 95%CI: 0.92, 1.28; Table 2).

232

Undereating

233

In contrast, undereating classes were associated with lower zBMI, in comparison to the “low

234

stable” class. The magnitude of associations in the “high transient” (boys: β=-0.25, 95%CI:-

235

0.41, -0.08; girls: β=-0.24, 95%CI:-0.38, -0.09) and “high decreasing” (boys: β=-0.27,

236

95%CI:-0.5, -0.05; girls: β=-0.21, 95%CI:-0.45, 0.03) classes were similar. “Stable high”

237

undereating was most strongly associated with lower zBMI (boys: β=-0.79, 95%CI:-1.15, -

238

0.42; girls: β=-0.76, -1.06, -0.45; Table 2).

239

Fussy Eating

240

Similarly, fussy eating was associated with lower zBMI, for both boys and girls. “Stable

241

high” fussy eating was most strongly and negatively associated with zBMI (boys: β=-0.49,

242

95%CI: -0.68, -0.30; girls: β=-0.35, -0.52, -0.18; Table 2). In contrast to boys, amongst girls

243

“low transient” and “low increasing” fussy eating were not associated with zBMI at 11 years.

244

Interactions between class and sex in their effects on zBMI at 11 were not supported for any

245

of the EBs. Results from unadjusted regression models are available in eTable 6a-c.

Discussion

258

In this study, differential developmental patterns in EBs across childhood were identified and

259

found to be associated with later child zBMI. This is the first study to address this question,

260

by establishing longitudinal trajectories of EBs during the first ten years of childhood and

261

investigating their association with childhood zBMI at age 11. Results suggested four

262

different trajectories of overeating and six trajectories each for undereating and fussy eating,

263

respectively.

264

The majority of children were not described as overeaters by their parents. However, two

265

trajectories (16% of children) were marked by gradual increases in overeating and showed

266

similar positive associations with child zBMI at age 11. The tendency to overeat is likely to

267

result in larger portion sizes, which have been suggested to have enduring effects on child

268

weight (29, 30). Recent longitudinal analyses of dietary data in a UK child cohort highlighted

269

that eating larger portions a few times per week accelerates early childhood growth (31).

270

In contrast to overeating, undereating was more common and more heterogeneous. By 15

271

months, parents reported that children engaged in various levels of undereating, with about

272

10% of boys and girls reported to undereat at a worrying level. However, undereating

273

behavior of most children attenuated with time, indicating that parent-perceived undereating

274

in children under the age of two years may represent a normal pattern of development. Only

275

2-3% of children engaged in persistent high levels of undereating. This persistent pattern of

276

undereating was negatively associated with child zBMI at age 11. Parental reports of

277

undereating might be an indication of satiety sensitivity (32). Previous research has suggested

278

that children who were attuned to their internal satiety cues ate smaller portions (33), and

279

grew at a slower rate than their less satiety-responsive siblings (34).

13
280

Similarly to undereating, fussy eating behavior was highly heterogeneous in early life. Using

281

LCGA, we identified, a small but substantial group of children (8%) who were persistently

282

fussy throughout the first ten years of life. These results add to previous studies suggesting

283

that some fussiness around food is common during childhood, with one third of children

284

reported to be fussy at some point, but only a small percentage of children remaining highly

285

fussy eaters across development (3). More persistent fussy eating trajectories were negatively

associated with child zBMI at age 11.

287

The relationship between food fussiness and weight is complex as fussy children might

288

undereat certain food groups (e.g., fruits and vegetables) but overeat others (e.g.,

289

carbohydrates and fats). Previous cross-sectional studies proposed that fussy children ate

290

fewer vegetables and less fish, but consumed more savory and sweet snack foods at 14

291

months (35). However, a longitudinal study indicated that persistent fussy eating in childhood

292

was associated with higher prevalence of underweight in children aged six years (16).

293

This study supports the prospective association between EBs and weight in children.

294

Individual differences in weight have consistently been shown to be influenced by genetic

295

factors (36). The behavioral susceptibility to obesity theory (37) suggests that EBs might act

296

as a mediator between genetic risk for obesity and exposure to the current obesogenic

297

environment. Previous studies proposed that increased genetic risk for obesity is associated

298

with decreased responsiveness to satiety cues, as well as greater responsiveness to external

299

food cues in ten year old twins (38). Subsequent research has replicated these findings in

300

Finnish (39), UK (40) and Canadian adults (41). However, previous studies only included

301

single measures of EBs and it remains unknown how genetic risk for obesity influences

302

longitudinal trajectories of EBs across development.

303

Apart from weight, EBs have been implicated in diet quality and as potential risk factor for

304

eating disorders. Especially, food fussiness has been associated with poor diet quality,(42)

305

such as low consumption of vegetables (43). Food fussiness has received attention in the

306

context of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) (44). ARFID is a recently

307

defined diagnosis and little is known about its onset, development, and effect on health and is

308

characterized by extreme food fussiness affecting growth, weight, and physical health (45)

309

and that a large proportion of adolescents diagnosed with ARFID were persistent fussy eaters

310

during childhood (46). More research examining the impact of early food fussiness and

311

undereating on feeding and eating disorders risk is needed. It is possible that the persistent

312

fussy and undereating associated with low zBMI in this study may be ARFID presentations,

313

or risk factors for other eating disorders marked by restrictive eating, such as anorexia

314

nervosa. Further, child food fussiness has been found to be moderately heritable (47) and

315

future research is needed to uncover its genetic basis, as well as the role of fussy eating in

316

neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder.

317

Strengths and Limitations

318

To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive longitudinal study of child EBs in a large

319

sample. Data were from a population-based cohort and person-centered statistical analyses

320

allowed us to clarify the heterogeneity of EBs. Height and weight were objectively measured

321

during clinic visits. However, measures of EBs were parent reported and subject to reporting

322

bias. For example parents might be influenced by their own eating behaviors, their prior

323

experiences with other children and might be observing their children more closely in early

324

life. As children grow up and enter school, they will have an increasing numbers of meals

325

outside the family home. Therefore parents might be less aware of their children’s EBs.

326

However, relying on parental report remains the most commonly used measure of child EBs,

327

given that young children are not able to report their own behavior reliably, and standardized

328

direct observational measures are costly and time-consuming, and would be infeasible for

329

large cohorts such as ALSPAC. Additional support for the use parental reports comes from

330

research validating parent reported child eating against behavioral measures of eating such as

331

eating rate, energy intake at meal, eating without hunger and caloric compensation (32).

332

Additionally, analyzing the effect of estimated class membership on an outcome includes

333

some degree of uncertainty. Classes derived from LCGA are unobserved and hence class

334

membership is inferred. We used maximum-probability assignment, which allocates each

335

participant to the class they are most likely to belong to, carrying this class membership

336

forward to further analyses. This method has been suggested to attenuate the effect of class

337

on distal outcomes, due to uncertainty in class assignment (48). Hence, effect sizes estimated

338

from the regression analyses may be conservative.

339

Conclusions

340

We identified four trajectories of overeating and six trajectories each of fussy and

341

undereating in the ALSPAC sample, providing a thorough examination of child EBs. EB

342

trajectories were differentially associated with child zBMI, with persistent behaviors having a

343

stronger effect on BMI. Characterizing the heterogeneity of early life EBs is an important

344

component to understanding behavioral risk factors for common conditions, such as obesity.

Figure 3a: Trajectories of parental reports of overeating behaviors from 15 to
116 months for boys and girls (6186 boys, 5817 girls)

Probability to score the highest category of overeating

Caption: The y-axis shows the probability of scoring in the highest category of overeating (“great
worry”) at each of the eight time points. Trajectories for boys are in dashed lines. Trajectories for girls
are in solid lines. The legend shows the name of the class for boys (Bs) and girls (Gs), followed by
their percentages in brackets.
