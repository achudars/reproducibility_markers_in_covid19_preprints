Abstract
Despite focus on preventing 30-day readmissions, early readmissions (within 7 days of
discharge) may be more preventable than later readmissions (8-30 days). We assessed how well
a previously validated 30-day readmission prediction model predicts 7-day readmissions. We rederived model coefficients for the same predictors as in the original 30-day model to optimize
prediction of 7-day readmissions. We compared model performance and compared differences in
strength of model factors between the 7-day model to the 30-day model. While there was no
substantial change in model performance between the original 30-day and the re-derived 7-day
model, there was significant change in strength of predictors. Characteristics at discharge were
more predictive of 7-day readmissions, while baseline characteristics were less predictive.
Improvements in predicting early 7-day readmissions will likely require new risk factors
proximal to the day of discharge.
Background
Despite intense focus on preventing 30-day readmissions, early readmissions within the
first 7 days of hospital discharge may be more preventable than later readmissions (8-30 days
post-discharge) [1–6]. Early readmissions are more closely related to potential gaps in care
during the index hospitalization [4] or reflect premature discharge. Identifying patients at risk for
early, rather than later readmissions may be a more effective strategy to tailor resource-intensive
transitional care interventions to prevent readmissions. However, current risk prediction models
only identify patients at risk for 30-day readmission and often fail to use electronic health record
(EHR) data to allow for real-time operationalization of the model. Therefore, we assessed how
well a validated 30-day EHR-based readmission risk prediction model [7] would predict early 7day readmissions, and whether there were differences in the strength of predictors for 7-day
versus 30-day readmissions.
Methods
We conducted an observational cohort study of consecutive hospitalizations by adults
≥18 years from November 2009 to October 2010 using electronic health record (EHR) data from
6 diverse hospitals in north Texas, including safety-net, academic, and community sites. Details
of this cohort have been previously published [7]. The primary outcome was all-cause nonelective 7-day hospital readmissions within a 100-mile radius of Dallas, Texas. We split our
cohort 50-50 into derivation and validation sets. We used the derivation cohort to re-derive
model coefficients for the same predictors from our previously validated 30-day readmission
model (also developed from the same cohort) to optimize prediction of 7-day readmissions [7].
We used the validation cohort to compare the discrimination (C-statistic) and calibration of our
7-day readmission model with our original 30-day model to predict 7-day readmissions. We
calculated the categorical net reclassification improvement (NRI), which is the absolute net gain
in correctly reclassified predictions of high (top 2 risk quintiles) and low risk (bottom 3 quintiles)
for the 7-day readmission model compared to the 30-day model [8]. To examine which factors
were more (or less) predictive of 7-day readmissions, we evaluated the percent change in
coefficients between the two models, using the 30-day model as reference.
Results
Of 32,922 index hospitalizations among unique patients, 4.4% had a 7-day readmission
and 12.7% had a 30-day readmission. Patients with a 7-day readmission tended to be older (65

vs. 62 years old, p≤0.001), have Medicaid (10.4% vs 6.5%, p≤0.001), more prior ED visits
(mean 1.3 vs. 0.6 visits in last 12 months, p≤0.001), greater comorbidity burden (mean Charlson
comorbidity score of 1.7 vs. 0.9, p≤0.001), and longer length of stay (median 5 vs. 4 days,
p≤0.001). Our original 30-day model had modestly lower discrimination for predicting 7-day
versus 30-day readmission (C-statistic of 0.66 vs. 0.69, p≤0.001). Our 7-day readmission model
had similar discrimination as the original 30-day model for predicting 7-day readmissions (Cstatistic of 0.66, p=0.38) but improved calibration, particularly for the highest risk quintile
(Figure 1B). The 7-day model did not have better reclassification (NRI=0.006, 95% CI: -0.104 –
0.116).
When comparing strength of predictors between the two models, clinical characteristics
at discharge, such as sodium and vital sign instability, were more strongly predictive of 7-day
readmissions compared to 30-day readmissions. Baseline characteristics (Medicaid, widow, prior
utilization), were less predictive of 7-day readmissions. Factors on admission and during the
hospital stay also tended to be less predictive (Figure 1A; Table).
Conclusions
A previously validated, multi-condition 30-day EHR-based readmission risk prediction
model can also be used to predict 7-day readmissions. Model performance was not substantially
different compared to a re-derived 7-day readmission model. Reweighting predictors led to
slightly better calibration, but risk stratification and reclassification of risk were similar. While
overall model performance was similar, strength of predictors for 7-day versus 30-day
readmission differed. Characteristics at discharge were more predictive of early 7-day
readmissions, while baseline characteristics were less predictive. This is consistent with prior
research suggesting that early readmissions are more likely to be related to clinical stability on
discharge than 30-day readmissions [1–6].
Our study benefitted from the large, multicenter diverse cohort and high-quality
ascertainment of readmissions beyond the index hospital. The use of rich, ubiquitous EHR data
allows for real-time operationalization of the model. Furthermore, since we used the original
cohort from which the 30-day readmission model was developed [7], we were uniquely
positioned to isolate the ability of a 30-day readmission model to predict early 7-day
readmissions by avoiding any differences in model performance stemming from changes in the
population itself. Study limitations include uncertain generalizability to other settings and use of
data before federal penalties for hospital readmission were in effect.
To further optimize model performance, future 7-day readmission risk prediction models
should incorporate additional risk factors proximal to day of discharge such as the quality of
transition of care planning (e.g. timely outpatient follow-up, medication reconciliation, and
dispensing on discharge). Further optimizing risk prediction would enable hospitals to more
efficiently target and reduce those readmissions that are potentially the most preventable.

variables listed in the table separately for our re-derived early model and our original validated
30-day readmission model. For both models, we included index hospitalizations of patients who
were alive 30 days post-discharge. Patients who died in the hospital, were transferred to another
hospital, or left against medical advice were excluded.

1A. Change in Strength of Predictors

The percent change in β coefficients between the original 30-day model and the re-derived 7-day
model is shown for each predictor included in the model. Predictors are grouped according to the
timing of their availability, including baseline characteristics prior to the index hospitalization
(red dot), factors on hospital admission (light blue dot), factors during hospital stay (gold dot)
and factors on discharge day (dark blue dot). Values to the right of the vertical dashed line at 0,
shaded in green, indicate factors that are more predictive of early readmission. Values to the left
of the dashed line, shaded in red, indicate factors that are less predictive.

The new 7-day prediction model had better calibration than the original 30-day prediction model
across all quintiles of risk, but risk stratification was similar.
