ABSTRACT
Background. Efficient prevention and control of healthcare associated infections (HAIs) is still
an open problem.
Objective. To design efficient hospital infection control strategies by reorganizing nurse
scheduling.
Design, setting, and participants. Proof-of-concept modeling study based on high-resolution
contact data from wearable sensors between patients, nurses, doctors, and administrative staff
at a short-stay geriatric ward of a University hospital.
Methods. We considered isolation and contact removal to identify the most important class of
individuals for HAI dissemination. We introduced a novel intervention based on the
reorganization of nurse scheduling. This strategy switches and reassigns nurses‚Äô tasks through
the optimization of shift timelines, while respecting feasibility constraints and satisfying patientcare requirements. We evaluated the impact of interventions through a Susceptible-ColonizedSusceptible transmission model on the empirical and reorganized contacts.
Results. Isolation and contact removal produced the largest risk reduction when acting on
nurses. Reorganizing their schedules reduced HAI risk by 27% (95% confidence interval
[24,29]%) while preserving the timeliness, number, and duration of contacts. More than 30%
nurse-nurse contacts should be avoided to achieve an equivalent reduction through simple
contact removal. No overall change in the number of nurses per patient resulted from the
intervention.
Conclusions. Reorganization of nurse scheduling offers an alternative change of practice that
substantially limits HAI risk in the ward while ensuring the timeliness and quality of healthcare
services. This calls for including optimization of nurse scheduling practices in programs for
better infection control in hospitals.

Healthcare associated infections (HAIs) are increasingly widespread, with an estimated 4 million
individuals affected each year in Europe, representing approximately 6% of all hospitalized
patients (1). These infections have a substantial impact on morbidity and associated costs for
the healthcare system, potentially leading to failure of treatment, longer illnesses and
hospitalizations, and deaths. Rising antimicrobial resistance in hospitals has also increased the
threat to human health, as resistant pathogens may cause serious infections that cannot be
treated with available drugs (2).
Common HAIs spread through close-range proximity or physical contacts between individuals.
Several studies highlighted the importance of contacts for HAI diffusion (3‚Äì9), showing how
larger variety and duration of contacts are associated to an increase in HAI risk (10,11). These
factors lead to the well-known paradox that healthcare workers play a key role in pathogen
dissemination because of their frequent and persistent contacts with individuals of different
categories (12). Being at higher risk for HAI colonization, healthcare workers may act as
transient superspreaders and transmit the infection to the large number of individuals they get
in contact with, especially in the vulnerable population of patients (12‚Äì14).
Infection control strategies targeting healthcare workers require careful design, to avoid
interfering with their ability to carry out their core healthcare responsibilities. Hygienic
measures such as hand sanitizing are the primary strategy to prevent HAI diffusion, aiming to
reduce the per-contact risk of transmission (15). The efficacy of these measures is however
limited by low compliance rates, as reported by several studies especially under conditions of
emergency or understaffing (12,16‚Äì18). Even low compliance by a few individuals can have a
disproportionate impact on the risk of HAI diffusion in the hospital, given the presence of
potential superspreaders (11,12,19,20). Other approaches for infection control have therefore
considered the use of personal protective equipment (e.g. face masks and gloves) (21),
vaccination (22), isolation, or nurse cohorting (i.e. assigning nurses to a limited number of
patients during a given working period) (23). Their effectiveness, however, is still matter of
debate (23,24). Most importantly, some of these measures may only be applicable in reaction to
outbreaks, as they are rather costly and disruptive. It may thus prove difficult to integrate them
into day-to-day hospital activities.
Routine operations in a hospital are ensured by adequate healthcare workers staffing and
scheduling. Their organization has been extensively studied for several decades in operations
research, management, and computer science (25,26) and is generally known as the ‚Äònurse
scheduling problem‚Äô. It typically involves the optimization of single or multiple goals while
satisfying a set of hard constraints ‚Äì i.e. features that need to be respected at all costs, e.g.
feasibility, workload, length of shifts, required personnel or skills ‚Äì and a set of soft constraints ‚Äì
i.e. aspects that are desirable but may not be met in order to achieve a solution, e.g. preferences
for a day off. Mathematically described by the constrained minimization of a potential function,
the solution to the scheduling problem aims to optimize human resources‚Äô efficiency, patient
safety, quality of medical services, costs, and staff satisfaction. Despite the great interest in the
topic, research has so far addressed it exclusively from the management and computational
perspectives (25,26), with no regards to its potential role in infection control.
Here we propose a proof-of-concept modeling study for hospital infection control based on the
reorganization of care in a hospital ward through changes in the schedule of work shifts of
nurses. Using high-resolution temporal records on contacts in a hospital ward (3), our approach
switches tasks between nurses by altering their work schedules through the optimization of a

potential function, similarly to models for nurse scheduling. The reorganized schedule maintains
full staff capacity at any given time, preserves all time-referenced contacts recorded in the
dataset without affecting quality standards of medical services, and respects basic occupational
constraints (weekly workload, length of a work shift). The study is applied to a short-stay
geriatric hospital ward in Lyon, France, where contact data were collected through automated
sensors (3). We model the circulation dynamics of hand-transmitted pathogens such as
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE)
in the ward, and evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by measuring the risk for HAI
diffusion.

METHODS
Contact data
We used publicly available anonymized data collected during 4 days and 4 nights (December 6
to 10, 2010) at a short-stay geriatric ward of a hospital in Lyon, France (3,27). Using wearable
RFID sensors, the system tracked face-to-face proximity contacts over time between 75
participating individuals, including 27 nurses (N), 11 doctors (D), 8 administrative staff (A), and
29 patients (P). The dataset was first analyzed in Ref. (3); Figure 1 reports its basic properties.
Nurses and doctors had the largest cumulative duration of contacts, and most frequent contacts
were observed between nurses (NN), and between patients and nurses (PN).
HAI risk estimate
The time-resolved contacts are represented in the form of a temporal contact network (28),
where nodes correspond to individuals and links to proximity encounters. Time evolution
occurs at an hourly timescale. We model HAI diffusion in the hospital ward through a
Susceptible ‚Äì Colonized ‚Äì Susceptible transmission dynamics on the temporal contact network
(6,8,19,29,30). Colonized individuals transmit the pathogen with probability ùúÜ per contact. Their
average colonization duration is fixed at 10 hours for healthcare workers, assuming a
spontaneously clearing transient colonization at the end of a work shift. The duration is longer
for patients and corresponds to 10 days, hypothesizing a weekly bacterial screening, followed by
3 days to obtain test results and implement a decolonization therapy, as in (6,19).
To assess the risk of transmission of the infection in the ward, we estimate the condition for
circulation of MRSA or VRE on measured contacts through the infection propagator approach
(31‚Äì33). This theoretical framework was introduced to study epidemics spreading on temporal
networks and identify the critical value ùúÜ" of the transmissibility above which the pathogen
spreads in the host population (i.e. if ùúÜ > ùúÜ" an outbreak is predicted to occur). The Appendix
reports a full description of this approach, and the available software tool.
Intervention through isolation or contact removal
To assess the role that each class of individuals has on HAI risk, we simulate two interventions
based (i) on the isolation of individuals belonging to a given class, and (ii) on the removal of
contacts established between two classes (e.g. contacts between patients and nurses). Each
intervention is made comparable across classes or pairs of classes, through the isolation of 8
individuals (i.e. the smallest size class) or the removal of 5% of the total duration of contacts in
the dataset, respectively. Interventions are repeated to account for the stochasticity in the choice
of the node to isolate or of the contacts to remove.

Intervention based on reorganization of nurse scheduling
We introduce an activity variable ùëé% (ùë°) associated to nurse ùëñ during hour ùë°, so that ùëé% (ùë°)=1 if the
nurse is at work and establishes contacts in that hour and ùëé% (ùë°) = 0 otherwise (Figure 2a). For
each nurse, we compute the shift duration ùë† defined as the number of consecutive work hours,
and the workload ùë§ corresponding to the total number of hours worked in the dataset.
The proposed intervention switches and reassigns the tasks performed by two nurses in a given
hour ùë°. Tasks consist in contacts that nurses establish, as they perform their duties in interaction
with other individuals (e.g. caring for a patient). They correspond to possible transmission
events. The reorganization is driven by the minimization of the following potential function:
0

ùëâ = ‚àí 1 ‚àë% ‚àë46 ‚àë45 ùëé% (ùë°3 )ùëé% (ùë°1 )(ùë°3 ‚àí ùë°1 )1 .

(2)

ùëñ runs on all nurses, ùë°3 and ùë°1 run on the whole timeline, and ùëò determines the tendency of the
potential (ùëò = ¬±1). ùëò = ‚àí1 shows a tendency to create regular individual schedules (periodic
activity patterns), and ùëò = 1 a tendency for irregular individual schedules (erratic activity
patterns) (Fig.2b).
This strategy preserves the number, type, and exact timeline of contacts, differently from the
intervention through contact removals. The minimization of the potential is additionally subject
to feasibility constraints on shift duration and workload of nurses:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

Model ùëÜ: the exchange is allowed as long as each working shift lasts at most s=10 hours,
as measured empirically.
Model ùëäùëÜ: in addition to the constraint on shift duration, the exchange is allowed only if
it preserves the empirically measured workload w of each nurse.

Each model is run with both values of ùëò, for a total of 4 reorganization options
(ùëÜ=3 , ùëÜ?3 , ùëäùëÜ=3 , ùëäùëÜ?3 ). The Appendix reports a detailed description of the minimization
algorithms. Despite being synthetic, these interventions have an increasing degree of realism to
show the potential of this proof-of-concept study for possible applications in real situations.
Evaluation of interventions
We evaluate the effect of interventions by comparing the resulting HAI risk estimate (ùúÜ@AB
" ) with
the one estimated on the empirical pattern of contacts (ùúÜCDE
).

the

as the relative variation of these two quantities ((ùúÜ@AB

), so that a positive risk

"
"
reduction corresponds to interventions improving the control of potential HAI diffusion in the
hospital ward (the opposite for negative values). Fluctuations in the HAI risk reduction are
obtained from the variations resulting from the stochastic trials.
Effects of the reorganization of nurse scheduling on contact patterns
To test whether the proposed reorganization of nurse scheduling leads to nurse cohorting (23),
we measure the variation in the number of distinct nurses assigned to each patient following the
intervention compared to the empirical value. Negative values of this variation correspond to
nurse cohorting (i.e. an average reduction of the number of nurses per patient).
We also measure the variations in the nurses‚Äô degree (i.e. number of distinct connections each
nurse establishes) by comparing average degree and associated fluctuations before and after the
reorganization.

RESULTS
Intervention through isolation or contact removal
Complete isolation of 8 randomly chosen patients corresponds to a drop of 8% in the cumulated
duration of contacts, while isolating 8 nurses reduces it by 31% (Figure 3a). In the latter
situation, it leads to an approximate 35% median reduction of the HAI risk (Fig. 3c), whereas the
same intervention applied to other classes has negligible impact.
When removing a certain fraction of contacts between classes, the largest risk reduction is
obtained by acting on nurse-nurse contacts (median reduction of 13%), corresponding to
deleting 15% of nurse-nurse contact duration (Fig. 3b, d). Interventions on contacts between
nurses and doctors or administrative staff, which are proportionally more disruptive, have
almost no impact on the risk.
Both theoretical interventions highlight the central role played by nurses in the hospital ward
under study, supporting the design of a more realistic intervention that could act on nurse
activities without disrupting the ward functioning and the provision of medical and nursing
services.
Intervention based on reorganization of nurse scheduling
Minimizing the potential while constraining only the maximum shift duration leads to two
different profiles of the workload distribution (Figure 4). Model ùëÜ=3 shows approximately half of
the nurses not working (ùë§ = 0), and the rest distributed quite evenly from short to very long
workloads (Fig. 4a). Model ùëÜ?3 tends instead to homogenize nurses‚Äô workload around the
average value (16 to 23 hours in the 4-day timeframe, Fig. 4c).
Shift duration distributions are rather similar in all models, and qualitatively comparable with
empirical data (Fig. 4b, d, f, h). Small variations on 1-hour shifts (higher probability in ùëäùëÜ
models) and 8-9-hour shifts (more marked increase in the ùëÜ models) are observed.
Model ùëÜ?3 achieves the largest reduction of HAI risk (median 27% reduction, 95% CI [24,29]%),
followed by ùëäùëÜ=3 (21%, [20,24]%) and ùëäùëÜ?3 (19%, [16,20]%) (Figure 5a). Equivalent risk
reductions would be obtained by contact removal if more than 30%, 25%, and 20% duration of
nurse-nurse contacts were to be removed, respectively (Fig. 5b). Model ùëÜ=3 instead increases
HAI risk of 5%.
Models ùëÜ?3 , ùëäùëÜ=3 , and ùëäùëÜ?3 , which decrease risk, show a reduction of the fluctuations in the
number of distinct contacts established by nurses, without substantially altering their average
number of contacts or the number of distinct nurses assigned to each patient (Figure 6). Model
ùëÜ=3 , which increases risk, raises cohorting levels with a median of 4 less nurses assigned to each
patient and strongly increases nurses‚Äô degree fluctuations.

DISCUSSION
The key role of healthcare workers in the transmission of healthcare associated infections is
widely recognized (12‚Äì15). Low compliance and limited sustainability of recommended
strategies hinder efficient infection control. Our study proposes an alternative change of practice
through the reorganization of nurse work shifts to reduce HAI risk. Using sensed contact data in
a hospital ward, we show that reassigning tasks to nurses minimizing a potential function on

their timeline of activity can reduce the risk of HAI diffusion by about one third. Our findings
show the potential of planning nurse schedules to improve infection prevention and control.
The key advantage of the proposed intervention is that it preserves the number, type, and
duration of contacts at each time. This ensures the timeliness and quality of medical and nursing
services provided. An equivalent impact on risk reduction could be achieved by limiting the
interactions viable for transmission. Uninformed removal of contacts would be however rather
disruptive, with one third of contacts deleted among nurses, at the expense of standards of care.
Patient isolation, staff cohorting, and increase in staff levels were shown in previous work to be
effective in limiting transmission, by directly or indirectly acting on the interactions (18,23,29).
Fully isolating about 30% of patients in the ward, however, had no impact on the risk of
transmission in this study. Also, the highest improvement in infection control (ùëÜ?3 ) was due
neither to cohorting nor to an increase in staff levels. However, this intervention led to the
strongest reduction in the fluctuations in the number of distinct contacts per nurse.
Homogenizing nurses‚Äô contact patterns around 40-45 contacts per nurse removes the presence
of potential superspreaders (11,12,19,20) that could otherwise act as risk amplifiers. The
reduction in the degree fluctuations is indeed observed only in the models reducing HAI risk.
Adequate staffing levels and reasonable workloads are established factors promoting infection
prevention in hospitals (12,18,34). Reorganizing nurses‚Äô shifts just respecting the maximum
shift duration constraint (model ùëÜ=3 ) results in our study in approximately half of the staff not
working, while nursing care is assigned to the remaining half, thus forcing unrealistic work
schedules (up to 80 hours of work per nurse in 4 days, i.e. an average of 20h/day). Such
reorganization of work has a negative impact on infection control, in line with empirical findings
that recognize high workloads, understaffing, and the presence of superspreaders as key risk
factors for MRSA circulation in healthcare settings (12,34). In addition, poor infection control
would be here associated to an increase of cohorting levels, which simply results from lower
staffing. All other models lead instead to an important reduction of HAI risk, with the
reorganization being able to break potential chains of transmission through the swapping of
tasks. Improved control is achieved by reducing the presence of superspreaders in the ward,
under both regular and irregular individual work timelines of nurses, and with different shift
and workload distributions. These findings uncover the practical mechanism for improved
control and highlights the robustness of the proposed strategy to different requirements on the
organization of the workforce.
Mathematical models have already been used to improve our understanding of hospital
epidemiology (35,36). They are nowadays increasingly data-driven thanks to remote sensing,
allowing an automated collection of close-proximity interactions between individuals, not
affected by reporting or observer biases inherent to other approaches (37). This type of contacts
was recently shown to explain the diffusion path of several HAIs (6,7,10,38). For this reason, our
findings extend to pathogens other than MRSA and VRE, spreading along the same routes, under
the hypothesis of relatively rapid decolonization (6,19). Durations of the order of months that
are empirically observed in absence of interventions (39) were not examined here because
considered inappropriate in the hypothesis of decontamination taking place.
Prior modeling work generally relied on numerical simulations of HAI spread (35). We used the
infection propagator approach to estimate HAI risk reduction in a reliable and computationally
fast way. This approach was already used to estimate the risk of disease persistence in other
epidemic contexts (32,33), and has the advantage of being flexible to the integration of

heterogeneities in the force of infection that may depend, for example, on class-specific
transmissibility.
The proposed reorganization of staff schedules focused on the class of nurses, as theoretical
results on isolation or contact removal clearly identified nurses as the category of healthcare
workers who mostly contribute to the transmission risk in the ward. This can be traced back to
the larger number and longer duration of contacts established by nurses, commonly required by
nursing care, and it is in line with previous observations and modeling works proposing nurses
as target group for prevention measures (7,9,22).
Our findings show the potential to integrate infection prevention into the nurse scheduling
problem, originally designed to optimize hospital workforce. However, some steps are still
needed to carry this novel paradigm into practice, in the form of a roadmap to a future hospital
protocol. First, contact data collection on a longer timeframe is required to provide a
comprehensive measurement of the functioning of the healthcare setting under study. Moreover,
collecting metadata on the type of clinical interventions performed in the ward, the specific roles
of subclasses of personnel (e.g. nurse types), the type of patients admitted, and the standard and
organization of care (e.g. scheduling practices along the 24 hours) is key to improve the
parameterization of the epidemic transmission model and define the conditions for task‚Äô
reassignments (e.g. by swapping similar tasks, or tasks that can be handled by the same staff
type). Most importantly, such additional data will help constrain the potential function to patient
needs and staff requirements. We list, for example, the length of shifts, the number of weekends
worked, the number of on/off days, the role of additional personnel (e.g. physical therapists,
nutritionists, with different working patterns), the use of part-time and temporary nursing
personnel (thus introducing staff for substitute shifts). Integrating these elements would make
the re-scheduling feasible, without altering the core of the strategy proposed here.
We presented modeling evidence that reorganizing nurse scheduling while maintaining the
number, timeliness, and quality of medical services provided by nursing staff can strongly
decrease the risk for HAI diffusion in the hospital ward. Our study provides the theoretical basis
for a new control paradigm, showing its potential for integration in future nurse scheduling
practices for the implementation of successful infection control programs at the hospitals.

APPENDIX
1. Infection propagator approach to evaluate the HAI risk
We represent the time-evolution of contacts in terms of a temporal network with adjacency
matrices ùê¥4 , with ùë° running on the 1-hour time steps. The entry ùëñ, ùëó of ùê¥4 is equal to one if nodes
ùëñ, ùëó establish a contact during time step ùë°, zero otherwise. We model the spread of the pathogen
using a Susceptible ‚Äì Colonized ‚Äì Susceptible model. A colonized node in the network transmits
the pathogen to a connected node with probability ùúÜ (transmissibility) at each time step. It also
clears the pathogen with a probability ùúá at each timestep. ùúá=3 is then the average carriage
period. There exists a critical value of transmissibility ùúÜ" ‚Äì called epidemic threshold ‚Äì that
determines the global behavior of the outbreak. If transmissibility is higher than the epidemic
threshold (ùúÜ > ùúÜ" ), introducing the pathogen into the hospital ward is likely to cause a largescale outbreak. Instead, if transmissibility is lower than the epidemic threshold (ùúÜ < ùúÜ" ), the
outbreak is likely to affect few individuals. Therefore, computing changes in the epidemic
threshold is a a synthetic and easy-to-interpret way to weigh the impact of any policy, on the
vulnerability of the ward to the pathogen considered. If the epidemic threshold increases
following intervention, the ward becomes more resilient to pathogen introduction. Oppositely, if
the epidemic threshold goes down, the ward becomes more prone to large-scale outbreaks. This
is the rationale behind our definition of HAI risk reduction: (ùúÜ@AB
‚àí ùúÜCDE
)/ùúÜCDE
. In order to
"
"
"
compute it, we need to compute the epidemic threshold before and after intervention. To that
end, we employ the infection propagator approach (31‚Äì33), which can compute the epidemic
threshold on any arbitrary temporal network, for the spreading model used here. The infection
propagator is the following matrix:
ùëÉ (ùúÜ, ùúá) = ‚àè4 (1 ‚àí ùúá + ùúÜùê¥4 ).
It contains both the time-evolving structure of the contact network (ùê¥4 ), and the parameters of
the spreading model (ùúÜ, ùúá), and measures the chains of infection between individuals along
which the pathogen can spread. We prove in (31‚Äì33) that the epidemic threshold is the smallest
value of ùúÜ for which the largest eigenvalue of ùëÉ equals one.
We provide a Python library to compute the epidemic threshold of any empirical temporal
network in the following repository: https://github.com/eugenio-valdano/threshold

2. Implementation of switch and reassignment of nurses‚Äô tasks and minimization of the
potential
We minimize the potential using the Metropolis algorithm. It is an iterative process based on the
following steps.
Version for ùëÜ?3 , ùëÜ=3 :
1)
2)
3)
4)
5)

Choose two nurses (ùëñ ‚â† ùëó), and one time step (ùë°);
If neither nurse is active during ùë°, go to 1);
Swap tasks between ùëñ, ùëó during ùë°;
If the swap breaks the ùëÜ constraint, go to 1);
Compute the potential;

6) If the swap decreases the potential, accept the swap. If the swap increases the potential,
accept it with probability ùëí =‚àÜR , where ‚àÜùëâ is the change in potential due to the swap;
7) Only if the swap is accepted, update nurses‚Äô task assignments, and potential;
8) Go to 1).
Version for WùëÜ?3 , ùëäùëÜ=3 :
1) Choose two nurses (ùëñ ‚â† ùëó);
2) Choose two time steps (ùë°, ùë†), so that ùëñ is active during ùë°, and not active during ùë†, and ùëó is
active during ùë†, and not active during ùë°. If this is not possible, go to 1);
3) Swap tasks between ùëñ, ùëó during both ùë°, ùë†;
4) If the swap breaks the ùëÜ constraint, go to 1);
5) Compute the potential;
6) If the swap decreases the potential, accept the swap. If the swap increases the potential,
accept it with probability ùëí =‚àÜR , where ‚àÜùëâ is the change in potential due to the swap;
7) Only if the swap is accepted, update nurses‚Äô task assignments, and potential;
8) Go to 1).
