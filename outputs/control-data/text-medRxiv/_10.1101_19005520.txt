Abstract

20

We proposed and tested a feminist social-ecological theory about daughters’ experience of

21

female genital mutilation/cutting (FGMC) in Egypt, where over 90% of women ages 15–49 are cut.

22

FGMC has potential adverse effects on demographic and health outcomes and has been defined as a

23

human-rights violation. Contextual factors are important determinants of FGMC, but an integrated

24

theory is lacking, and quantitative multilevel research is limited. We theorized that more favorable

25

community-level gender systems, including gender norms opposing FGMC and expanded

26

opportunities for women outside of the family, would be associated with a daughter’s lower risk of

27

FGMC and would strengthen the negative association of a mother’s opposition to FGMC with her

28

daughter’s risk of cutting. Using a national sample of 14,171 mother-daughter dyads from the 2014

29

Egypt Demographic and Health Survey, we estimated multilevel discrete-time hazard models to test

30

these relationships. Community gender norms opposing FGMC had significant direct, negative

31

associations with the hazard that a daughter was cut, but women’s opportunities outside the family

32

did not. Maternal opposition to FGMC was negatively associated with cutting a daughter, and these

33

associations were stronger where community opposition to FGMC and opportunities for women

34

were greater. Results provided good support for a gender-systems theory of the multilevel influences

35

on FGMC. Integrated, multilevel interventions that address gender norms about FGMC and

36

opportunities for women in the community, as well as beliefs about the practice among the mothers

37

of at-risk daughters may be needed for sustainable declines in the practice.

Introduction

39

Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGMC) refers to “procedures involving the partial or total removal of

40

the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons”

41

(1). The practice—especially its more extensive forms–is associated with various health and

42

demographic outcomes, including elevated risks of an earlier age at first sex (2), sexual trauma and

43

dysfunction (3, 4), primary infertility (5), obstetric complications (6, 7), and marital dissatisfaction,

44

instability, and dissolution (2, 6, 8). The United Nations recognizes FGMC as a violation of human

45

rights (1), and Sustainable Development Goal 5.3 has established a global mandate to encourage

46

abandonment (9). Alongside legal and programmatic efforts to end FGMC (10), its prevalence has

47

declined in some places, remains common in at least 29 mostly African countries, and remains nearly

48

universal in eight countries, including Egypt (11, 12).

49

Community context influences various outcomes in childhood and adolescence related to

50

health (13, 14), sexual behavior (15), and early marriage (16). Research on FGMC has found that

51

community characteristics are associated with the practice among girls (17, 18), and most of this

52

research has focused on the normative context specific to FGMC. Yet, norms about FGMC are only

53

one aspect of a community gender system that includes structural constraints on women’s

54

opportunities outside of the family.

55

We advance research on FGMC in two ways. First, we offer an integrated explanatory

56

theory, focusing on two elements of a community-level gender system: the collective practice of FGMC as

57

a gender norm that upholds patriarchal family systems, and the structural opportunities for women outside

58

this family system. This framing highlights the salience of gender systems as an explanatory theory

59

of demographic (19-22) and life course (23, 24) processes. Defining and testing these elements of a

60

gender system also addresses debates about normative versus structural drivers of demographic and

61

behavioral change (25, 26), especially for gender-related outcomes, such as skewed sex ratios at birth,

62

girls’ excess mortality, child marriage, and lowest-low fertility. Second, we apply rigorous multilevel

63

methods to assess how the elements of a community-level gender system are associated with the risk

64

that a daughter is cut, directly and by moderating the influence of a mother’s FGMC attitudes and

65

experience.

66

Our study site is Egypt, where FGMC remains widespread despite legal prohibitions of the

67

practice. The 2014 Egypt Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) provides rich data on FGMC

68

for all women respondents and their daughters (12, 27). This study fills conceptual and empirical

69

gaps in debates on the community influences on FGMC in what scholars have called the classic

70

patriarchal belt of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Our framework and findings

71

offer insights for multifaceted community interventions to further the abandonment of FGMC, and

72

other practices harmful to women and girls.

73

Background

74

Prevalence, trends, and determinants of FGMC

75

An estimated 200 million women and girls in 30 countries have experienced FGMC (28), although

76

estimates for the number affected vary (29). On the African continent, FGMC is practiced in at least

77

29 countries, with prevalence ranging from 1% in Cameroon and Uganda to 98% in Somalia (29).

78

Across 87 national surveys for 29 African countries, the prevalence of FGMC has declined

79

somewhat in more than half the countries; however, declines have been more pronounced in

80

countries with low-to-moderate prevalence than in countries with near-universal prevalence, such as

81

Egypt (11, 12, 29, 30).

82

Studies of the determinants of FGMC have focused on family or household

83

characteristics—a girl’s immediate social context. In diverse settings, the daughters of mothers with

84

more schooling (31, 32) and living in wealthier households (11, 33) less often have been cut. Other

85

salient social contexts include religious and ethnic identities, social networks among women, and

86

marriage markets (17, 18, 34-36).

87

Few studies have examined the community-level sources of variation in FGMC. Yet, even

88

neighboring villages can harbor different attitudes and practices related to FGMC, suggesting an

89

influence of community context on girls’ experiences (37). In the first multilevel analyses of FGMC,

90

the community prevalence of FGMC was directly, positively associated with a girl’s risk of cutting in

91

Kenya (17) and modified the individual-level association of religious identity on this risk in Burkina

92

Faso (18). FGMC tends to be less common in urban than rural areas (11); however, such differences

93

may be reduced or reversed after accounting for other factors (17, 18, 32). The influences of gender-

94

related community characteristics are undertheorized and understudied.

95

Community gender systems and FGMC: Integrating social norms

96

and feminist theories

97

We propose an integrated, feminist, social-ecological framework, in which a community-level gender

98

system is our explanatory model (Fig 1). We describe how two elements of this gender system—gender

99

norms about FGMC and extra-familial opportunities for women—may influence a daughter’s risk of FGMC,

100

directly and by conditioning the influence of maternal beliefs about and experience with the practice.

103

Community gender norms about FGMC

104

A social norm is a collective practice in a referent group that is motivated by two social expectations in

105

the group: the empirical expectation that others practice the behavior, and the normative expectation that

106

others think the practice should be upheld (38-41). A social norm is maintained through social

107

influence, or expectations that compliance will be rewarded with social acceptance, and non5

108

compliance will be punished with social rejection (41). Thus, complying with a social norm can be a

109

marker of social belonging (42-44), and sustaining the norm is a way to uphold these social ties as

110

distinct and valued (36).

111

In the case of FGMC, social norms theorists argue that the decision to cut or not to cut a

112

daughter will depend on parental perceptions of the collective practice and of the community’s

113

social beliefs (42, 43). A mother (usually the parent most directly involved in decisions about

114

FGMC) may personally believe that FGMC is unnecessary or even harmful, but she may have her

115

daughter cut if she perceives that: FGMC is practiced in her community, others think it should be

116

practiced, and non-compliance will have negative social consequences for her daughter. That said,

117

this mother may not have her daughter cut if she believes that her uncut daughter will be socially

118

accepted. Social norms approaches, therefore, imply an interaction between personal beliefs and

119

community characteristics. In communities where normative expectations are strongly enforced,

120

opposing personal beliefs will have little influence on behavior. As normative expectations weaken, a

121

“tipping point” will be reached where the influence of personal opposition to FGMC can be

122

observed (42).

123

Social norms approaches to FGMC have some empirical support. The community-level

124

prevalence of FGMC, a proxy for empirical expectations about the practice, has been positively

125

associated with the risk of cutting a daughter in parts of Africa (17, 18). In communities in Egypt

126

and parts of Africa, public denunciations of FGMC have signaled changes in normative expectations

127

about the practice and have been thought to spur declines in prevalence (11, 45, 46). Such evidence

128

suggests that community-level empirical and normative expectations about FGMC matter; however,

129

the joint influences of these expectations are understudied, including whether a tipping point in

130

community opposition to FGMC is needed for maternal opposition to have an influence on a

131

daughter’s risk of cutting (47, 48).

132

A limitation of social norms theory is its cursory discussion of FGMC as integral to norms

133

of womanhood. In many practicing societies, FGMC is performed to achieve normative

134

expectations about sex differentiation, feminine beauty, and women’s sexuality (3, 8, 49, 50). First,

135

women achieve social recognition by becoming less like men physically (49); thus, by removing the

136

“male parts” and sometimes enclosing the “female parts,” FGMC “feminizes” a girl’s body (49-51).

137

Second, FGMC helps to realize the feminine aesthetics of purity, smoothness, and cleanliness (49,

138

51). Third, by de-emphasizing (or controlling) women’s sexuality, FGMC accentuates women’s

139

reproductive role (49). In these ways, the collective practice of FGMC acts as a gender norm, involving

140

empirical expectations that most women are cut, normative expectations that good women are cut, and

141

enforcement by requiring it for marriage in a patriarchal family system.

142

Community extra-familial opportunities for women

143

The gender norm of FGMC also may persist alongside institutionalized gender inequalities that limit

144

women’s opportunities outside the patriarchal family (31, 52-54). These structural inequalities are

145

multifaceted, arising in social, economic, and political domains (55). Women’s social inequality

146

involves a lack of access to education and the means to act on their sexual and reproductive choices.

147

Women’s economic inequality involves a lack of access to activities and institutions involving the

148

production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services (56). Together, these

149

institutionalized gender inequalities limit women’s access to social and economic resources and

150

identities outside of the family, cementing women’s dependence on the security provided by (male)

151

family members and conformity to practices that uphold this system. The strength of

152

institutionalized inequality can be measured by the availability of extra-familial opportunities for women,

153

that is, by women’s access to social and economic resources outside of the family. In lower- and

154

middle-income settings, evidence of extra-familial opportunities for women may include higher

155

average schooling attainments, later average ages at first marriage, lower rates of arranged marriage,

156

and higher rates of participation in market work.

157

The availability of opportunities like these at the community level may allow mothers to see

158

real alternatives to having their daughters cut (31, 39, 57). Thus, a direct association may exist

159

between community extra-familial opportunities and a daughter’s risk of FGMC. Social norms

160

theorists have questioned the influence of women’s extra-familial opportunities on the risk of

161

FGMC, citing patriarchal settings where FGMC is not practiced and women’s involvement in its

162

continuation (58). These arguments ignore feminist theory (59). First, different forms of patriarchy

163

exist and are upheld by different gender norms, which may or may not include FGMC. Second,

164

women’s complicity in upholding harmful practices may reflect a survival strategy under patriarchy

165

(59), where mothers pursue the best available “options” for their daughters in the absence of real

166

alternatives. To the extent that greater extra-familial opportunities at the community level signal a

167

broader system of alternatives for women, they may reduce the perceived costs of violating norms

168

favoring FGMC. Thus, an interaction also may exist between personal beliefs and community

169

context, whereby mothers feel able not to have their daughters cut in contexts where women have

170

sources of social and economic security outside of marriage and the marital family.

171

The Egyptian context

172

In Egypt, FGMC remains nearly universal and a majority of women favor continuation. In 1995,

173

97% of ever-married women 15–49 years were cut, and the median age at cutting was 10 (60-63).

174

Since the criminalization of FGMC in 2008, the adjusted prevalence of FGMC in girls 15–19 years

175

declined little, from 94% in 2008 to 88% in 2014 (64). More than half of ever-married women 15–49

176

years supported continuation in 2008 (62%) and 2014 (58%) (64).

177

Here, FGMC is closely tied to expectations about gender identification, feminine beauty and

178

purity, and control of women’s sexuality (32, 65-68). In Egyptian social systems, like many African

179

social systems, family and community are core institutions whose interests override those of an

180

individual. Patriarchal control and family honor are constructed through marriage and are sustained

181

through the social and sexual control of women. By ensuring a girl’s virginity and conformity to

182

expectations of feminine modesty and aesthetics, FGMC is thought to enhance a daughter’s

183

prospects for a suitable marriage (32). This way, FGMC operates as a gender norm that reflects and

184

reinforces a patriarchal family system.

185

In recent decades, minority Christian groups have begun to abandon FGMC while Islamist

186

groups have promoted FGMC as part of authentic Muslim womanhood (36). Thus, higher

187

percentages of Muslim than Christian women practice FGMC, intend to cut their daughters, and

188

view FGMC as desired by religion, “good” for the girl, cleansing or purifying, and protective against

189

sexual transgressions (32). Findings from the 2014 Survey of Young People in Egypt confirm that

190

Christian women and men are much less likely than Muslim women and men to report favorable

191

views about the practice (69). Thus, the emergence of FGMC as a symbol of authentic Muslim

192

womanhood has transformed the practice from a widespread gender norm to a gender norm aligned

193

more narrowly with Muslim identity (36).

194

In this context, opportunities for women outside the family remain limited. In 1981, Egypt

195

ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women

196

(CEDAW), but with reservations to the article on equality in marriage and family life (70). Child and

197

consanguineous or blood marriage remain common, and divorce remains rare (27). Namely, more

198

than 17% of women 20–24 years were married as children, and among the poorest and least

199

educated women, the median age at first marriage remains less than 19 years (27). One third (31%)

200

of ever-married women report consanguineous marriage, of which more than half are first-cousin

201

marriages (27). Child marriage and cousin marriage have been associated with women’s lower

202

influence in household decisions (57, 71), which in turn, has been related to a woman’s higher intent

203

to cut a daughter (72). Although women and men legally can seek divorce under certain conditions

204

(73), divorce remains stigmatized and rare, with less than 3% of women 35–49 years divorced in

205

2014 (27). Alongside women’s social dependence on marriage, their economic dependence also

206

remains high, as evidenced by lower rates than men of high school completion (33% versus 38%)

207

(27) and market work, especially after marriage and childbearing (74, 75).

208

Summary and hypotheses

209

In sum, an integrated feminist social-ecological theory situates the decision to cut or not to cut a

210

daughter within a community gender system. This system includes gender norms that uphold or challenge

211

patriarchal marriage systems and extra-familial opportunities available or not available to women. Both

212

elements of this gender system will directly influence a daughter’s risk of FGMC and will condition

213

the influence of a mother’s opposition to FGMC on the risk that her daughter is cut. Specifically:

214

H1.

A daughter will have a lower adjusted hazard of FGMC in communities (a) that have a lower

215

prevalence of FGMC and more strongly oppose the practice, and (b) where women have more

216

extra-familial opportunities.

217

H2. A mother’s opposition to FGMC and non-cut status will be associated with a lower hazard of

218

her daughter being cut in communities (a) that have a lower prevalence of FGMC and more

219

strongly oppose the practice, and (b) where women have more extra-familial opportunities. In

220

communities with less favorable gender systems, maternal opposition to FGMC will not be

221

associated with a daughter’s risk of FGMC.

Method

223

Sample and data

224

The data source for this analysis was the 2014 EDHS. The DHS collects nationally representative

225

data from women of reproductive age and their households on household socioeconomic

226

conditions, women’s marriage and birth histories, schooling and work, and FGMC, among other

227

data. The DHS typically use a two-or three-stage probability sampling design, in which small

228

geographic areas are selected, followed by households and respondents within households. These

229

small-sample areas can serve as effective proxies for villages or neighborhoods (76).

230

The Ministry of Health and Population provided ethical approval for the 2014 EDHS, and

231

respondents provided verbal informed consent to participate (77). The data for this analysis were

232

publically available, de-identified secondary data provided by permission from Measure DHS.

233

Emory University’s Institutional Review Board, therefore, considered this analysis exempt.

234

The 2014 EDHS included 883 sample clusters after excluding 42 (<1%) in Sinai for security

235

reasons. On average, 25 households per cluster were sampled Within each household, all ever-

236

married women 15–49 years were interviewed, for a total sample size of 21,762 women. Because our

237

outcome was the FGMC experience of daughters, we treated the mother-daughter dyad as the

238

individual-level, or level-one, unit of analysis. The sample cluster was the community-level, or level-

239

two, unit of analysis. For mothers with more than one daughter, we randomly selected one daughter

240

for the analysis. Women with no daughters were included only in constructing level-two measures

241

(see below). After dropping mother-daughter dyads with missing data (n=26), the final sample size

242

was 14,171 mother-daughter dyads within households nested in 881 communities. On average, these

243

clusters included 16 mother-daughter dyads (ranging from 1 to 78 across clusters, with a standard

244

deviation of 8). Less than 1% of clusters included only 1 woman, 7.5% had ≤5 women, and 27%

245

had ≤10 women. For primary exposure variables, the community-level sample averaged 24 ever-

246

married women 20–49 years per cluster (ranging from 1 to 127 across clusters, with a standard

247

deviation of 13).

.

248

The 2014 EDHS collected three general types of data on FGMC. All ever-married women

249

15–49 years self-reported their experience with FGMC, including type and timing, and their personal

250

attitudes about FGMC. All ever-married mothers 15–49 years reported their daughters’ experiences

251

with FGMC, including age of the event for cut daughters.

252

Main variables

253

Outcome: Daughter’s FGMC status

254

Our outcome was the daughter’s experience of FGMC. For each daughter aged 20 years or younger, the

255

mother reported whether her daughter was cut. If the response was “yes,” the mother reported the

256

daughter’s age at cutting in years.

257

Individual (level-one) exposure

258

A measure for maternal opposition to FGMC was derived from a factor analysis of four items that

259

captured non-cutting and disfavorable attitudes about FGMC. The first item captured whether the

260

mother reported to be uncut (0=no, 1=yes). Inclusion of cutting status was justified conceptually and

261

empirically. First, the cut or uncut status of the mother arguably captured a preference for the

262

practice among her own parents (78, 79). Second, evidence from Egypt has shown a strong, positive

263

association of maternal FGMC status with maternal intent to cut a daughter and a daughter’s risk of

264

being cut (32). We treated this item as dichotomous because self-reports of any versus no cutting are

265

reasonably reliable (60, 80, 81). The second and third items captured whether the mother believed

266

FGMC was not required by religion (0=no, 1=yes) and should not continue (0=no, 1=yes). For both

267

questions, the original response option ‘don’t know’ was recoded as 0 so that unfavorable attitudes

268

about FGMC were clearly distinguished. Because of the strong association of Christian religion with

269

unfavorable attitudes about FGMC and non-cutting in Egypt (32, 36), we added a fourth item for

270

whether the mother was Christian (=1) or Muslim (=0). In random split-half samples, we used

271

exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to assess whether these

272

items reflected a unidimensional construct. A single-factor CFA model with all four items had an

273

adequate fit to the data (factor loadings 0.53–0.98, Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation

276

Community (level-two) exposures

277

We considered four items to capture community-level gender norms opposing FGMC. Items were created

278

using data from all ever-married women 20–49 years in the community, a separate, non-overlapping,

279

cohort from the daughters ages 0–20 on which the outcome was observed. One measure of

280

empirical expectations about FGMC was the proportion of women in the community who were

281

uncut.

282

agreeing that religion does not require FGMC and that it should not continue. The proportion of

283

women who were Christian was considered for the reasons described, above. In random split-half

284

samples of communities, we performed EFA and CFA to assess whether these four items reflected a

285

unidimensional construct. The proportion Christian did not adequately load and was dropped. A

286

single-factor CFA model with the remaining three items (85) had an adequate fit to the data (factor

287

loadings 0.72–0.99, RMSEA=0.12, CFI=0.93, TLI= 0.90, α = 0.89). Although the 2014 EDHS had

288

a men’s sample, we used women’s responses to capture community gender norms about FGMC

289

because men often report less favorable attitudes about FGMC than do women (86, 87).

Two measures of normative expectations about FGMC captured the proportions of women

290

We also created a factor score for women’s community-level extra-familial opportunities. This score

291

was based on the proportions of ever-married women ages 20–49 in the community who had

292

completed secondary school or higher, had first lived with a spouse at age 18 or older, had married a

293

non-cousin, and had worked for cash or kind in the prior year. We considered adding a measure for

294

women’s ownership of land, but less than two percent of ever-married women 15–49 years owned

295

land in 2014 (77). We also considered aggregate scores for women’s freedom of movement and

296

influence in household decisions; however, questions on freedom of movement were not asked in

297

the EDHS 2014, and measures for freedom of movement and decision-making capture women’s

298

agency (54), not alternatives to marriage, a core element of our theory. In Egypt, women’s age at

299

first marriage, schooling, and market work are positively associated with their agency (57). We

300

performed an EFA and a CFA in random split-half samples. A single-factor CFA model with all

301

four items had an adequate fit to the data (factor loadings 0.57–0.84, RMSEA=0.12, CFI=0.93,

302

TLI=0.90, α=0.68).

303

Level-one control variables

304

We controlled for mother-daughter characteristics that have been associated with a daughter’s risk

305

of experiencing FGMC. We included the daughter’s birth year in calendar years to control for cohort

306

differences in FGMC risk (64), daughter’s birth order among daughters (32), mother’s age in years

307

(18, 32), father’s schooling attainment (1=completed secondary or higher, 0=less than completed

308

secondary) (32, 88), and a DHS-created household wealth score dichotomized to capture the

309

wealthiest two quintiles (top 40%) versus the bottom 60% of households (29, 32).

310

We also controlled for a composite level-one measure for maternal opportunities. This

311

measure was derived from a factor analysis of four items: maternal reported age at first residence

312

with a spouse (0=17 or younger, 1=18 or older), non-cousin marriage (0=no, 1=yes), schooling

313

attainment (0=less than completed secondary, 1=completed secondary or more), and work outside

314

the home for cash or kind in the prior year (0=no, 1=yes). In random split-half samples, we

315

performed EFA and CFA to assess whether these items reflected a unidimensional construct. Non-

316

cousin marriage loaded poorly and was dropped. A single-factor CFA model with the remaining

317

three items had an adequate fit to the data (factor loadings 0.40–0.99, RMSEA=0.02, CFI=0.99,

318

TLI=0.99, α=0.48).

Level-two control variables

We controlled for three community-level characteristics that could confound the relationship

321

between community norms, women’s opportunities, and a daughter’s risk of FGMC: the proportion

of households in the wealthiest two quintiles, defined above (17); urbanicity using DHS definitions

323

for urban versus rural locality (11, 32); and the proportion of ever-married women 15–49 years who

324

were Muslim (11, 36). All ever-married women 15-49 years were used to construct the last two

325

variables to control for a community’s religious and urban composition with all available data.

326

Analyses

327

The analysis was of de-identified secondary data, so the study was exempt from IRB review. We

328

began with descriptive analyses showing the characteristics of mother-daughter units in the sample

329

and variation in the characteristics of these units according to community-level opposition to

330

FGMC. All level-one descriptive statistics were weighted, and robust standard errors were estimated

331

to account for the stratified, cluster-sample design. We also presented point estimates and ranges for

332

community-level characteristics (unweighted because the DHS does not provide cluster-level

333

weights).

334

We used multilevel discrete-time hazard models to estimate associations of a daughter’s

335

hazard of FGMC with factor scores for maternal FGMC attitudes and status, community FGMC

336

norms, and community opportunities for women (89-91). Event-history models predict the

337

likelihood of FGMC at each age, accounting for the possibility that girls uncut at the survey may be

338

cut in the future. To facilitate model estimation, we used age-risk-sets, or multi-year periods of

339

exposure, rather than person-years as the unit of analysis. The multilevel structure of the models

340

accommodates the hierarchical nature of the data and avoids the problem of biased estimates of

341

precision that result from ignoring clustering within communities. All models were estimated using

342

STATA 14.1 (92).

343

Let ηijt denote the log-odds of the baseline hazard of FGMC for the daughter of mother i

344

living in community j at daughter’s age t. Let Aijt denote the daughter’s age risk set, specified as

346

risk sets for FGMC in this setting (89-91, 93). Since the model estimated was a limited dependent

347

variable hazard model, we included all four age risk sets capturing ages 0–20 to provide maximum

348

information to estimate the hazard for each age risk set. Although the median age of cutting in 2014

349

in Egypt was 10.5 years among ever-married women ages 15–49 (77), the probabilities of cutting at

350

individual ages before age 10 ranged from .01 to .05 and were substantial enough that we did not

351

truncate the sample of girls to those ages 10 to 20. Let FGMCij denote the mother’s FGMC attitudes

352

and status, Nj the community FGMC norms, and Oj the community extra-familial opportunities for

353

women. A general two-level discrete-time hazard model can be depicted as:

Equation (1) shows ηijt as a function of the age risk set t of the daughter of mother i in community j;

357

main exposure variables at level-one and level-two and their interactions; and random community-

specific contributions, uj, which are assumed to be normally distributed with variance δ. The γ ’s

359

identify the logit hazard curve, and γF ,γN, γO, γFN, and γFO, identify the effects associated with the

360

exposures and their interactions. Controls at level-one and level-two are added to Eq. (1) but are not

361

interpreted (94). Level-one variables were cluster-mean centered, and level-two variables were grand-

362

mean centered. The magnitude and significance of coefficients of the community-level attributes

363

provided tests of hypothesis 1, regarding direct community effects. The magnitude and significance

364

of coefficients of the interaction terms provided tests of hypothesis 2, regarding conditional

community effects.

To assess the “tipping point” hypothesis (42, 43, 95), significant cross-level interactions were

probed to detect the range of values for the community exposures for which maternal opposition to

368

FGMC was significantly associated with her daughter’s FGMC risk (96). Social norms theory

suggests that when community support for FGMC is high, even mothers who oppose the practice will

have their daughters cut; conversely, when community opposition to FGMC is high, and a new and

371

self-sustaining norm against FGMC emerges, the influence of maternal opposition to FGMC is

372

observed. The “tipping point” refers to the boundary levels of community opposition to FGMC or

373

community opportunities for women at which maternal opposition to FGMC is related significantly

374

to a daughter’s hazard of FGMC.

375

To assess the proportional odds assumption of these models, that all covariates have the

376

same effects for all age risk sets (93), we tested the significance of two-way interactions of all

377

covariates with the age-risk-set indicators (available on request). Our final models controlled for two

378

covariates with non-proportional effects, maternal opposition to FGMC and daughter’s birth year,

379

by retaining their interaction terms in the final model. For Muslim and living in an urban area, we

380

attempted to test the proportional error assumption that the logit-hazard curves of the communities

381

were parallel to one another, holding constant all predictors (93); however, the algorithm could not

382

produce estimates, perhaps because less than 1% of observations on these two variables were in the

383

last age-risk set.

384

We did not apply multilevel sampling weights to account for the unequal probabilities of

385

cluster and participant selection because the DHS does not provide cluster-level sampling weights

386

(97). In a similar single-level analysis that incorporated individual-level sampling weights and

387

stratification information, inferences were robust to the inclusion or exclusion of weights.

Characteristics of the mother-daughter sample

390

On average, daughters were eight years old at the time of the survey (born in 2005), and either the

391

first- or second-born daughter (Table 1). At the time of the survey, 20% of daughters had been cut,

392

and, as expected, this prevalence was monotonically higher across age groups of daughters, with less

393

than 1% of 0–1 year-olds, 6% of 2–11 year-olds, 49% of 12–16 year-olds, and 65% of 17–20 year17

On average, mothers were 34 years old, married (95%), Muslim (96%), living in a rural area

398

(65%), and had a spouse who completed secondary school (56%) (Table 1). A majority of mothers

399

had completed secondary school (52%) and were age 18 or older when they began living with a

400

spouse (82%). Only 15% had worked for cash or kind in the prior year. All mothers had heard of

401

FGMC, most were cut (93%), and a majority felt FGMC was required by religion (53%) and should

402

continue (60%).

403

The characteristics of daughters and mothers differed across communities with the lowest,

404

middle, and highest opposition to FGMC, measured as tertiles of the community proportion of

405

ever-married women 20–49 years believing that FGMC should not continue (Table 1). Only 7% of

406

daughters were cut in communities with the highest opposition to FGMC, compared to 21% and

407

35% of daughters being cut in communities where opposition to FGMC was moderate or low,

408

respectively. Also, the percentages of mothers who were cut (99% to 96% to 77%), believed that

409

FGMC was required by religion (70% to 54% to 28%), and believed that FGMC should continue

410

(85% to 61% to 26%) were monotonically lower with higher community opposition to FGMC

411

(Table 1). Maternal secondary schooling, work for cash or kind, and first spousal co-residence at age

412

18 or older were more common in communities with high opposition to FGMC than in

413

communities with low or moderate opposition to FGMC. Mothers whose spouse had the least

414

schooling, who lived in the poorest households, and who lived in rural areas tended to be in

415

communities with the lowest opposition to FGMC (Table 1).

432

In Models 1–4, the hazard of FGMC among daughters was higher among 2–11 and 12–16-

433

year-olds than among 0–1-year-olds (the reference group). The hazard was comparable between 17–

434

20 and 0–1 year-olds. In unconditional models with single-year age dummies (available on request),

435

the hazard of FGMC appeared to peak at age 12.

436

In Model 2, consistent with hypothesis 1 regarding community influences, community

437

FGMC norms were negatively associated with the hazard that a daughter was cut. Specifically, a

438

daughter living in a community with less favorable FGMC norms among women had a lower hazard

439

of experiencing FGMC. However, living in a community with more extra-familial opportunities for

440

women had no significant direct association with the hazard that a daughter was cut. Stronger

441

maternal opposition to FGMC (her non-cutting and more unfavorable attitudes) was associated with

442

a lower hazard of FGMC for her daughter.

443

In Model 3, both cross-level interactions were at least marginally significant, meaning the

444

association of maternal opposition to FGMC with her daughter’s hazard of FGMC depended on

445

community FGMC norms and opportunities for women. In Model 4, with controls, associations of

446

interest were robust, and sometimes larger, such as the interaction of community FGMC norms with

447

maternal opposition. This finding suggests that some covariates, such as the community proportions

448

urban, Muslim, and with the wealthiest 40% of households, may be negative confounders.

449

Based on Model 4, we graphed the simple slope (or estimated coefficient) and its 95%

450

confidence bands for the relationship between a mother’s level of opposition to FGMC and her

451

daughter’s predicted logit hazard of FGMC, conditional on the level of community opposition to

452

FGMC (Fig 2). These estimates were generated for the age-risk-set 2–11, with the highest risk of

453

cutting, and other covariates in the model were held constant at zero. Fig 2 shows that the slope for

454

maternal opposition to FGMC was more negative in communities with stronger opposition to

455

FGMC. Specifically, maternal opposition to FGMC was more protective against a daughter’s risk of

456

FGMC in communities that more strongly opposed FGMC. Using the online tool of Preacher and

457

colleagues (96), we found that the relationship of maternal opposition to daughter’s FGMC was

458

significant in communities where opposition to FGMC was 3.18 SD below the grand mean or

459

higher (Fig 2). Thus, in communities where opposition to FGMC was weakest (3.18 SD below the

460

grand mean or lower), maternal opposition to FGMC was unrelated to her daughter’s FGMC

461

hazard, consistent with the idea that opposition to FGMC must reach a “tipping point” before

462

mothers who oppose FGMC enact their preferences. In this sample, only one community would

463

have a value less than 3.18 SD below the community grand mean of FGMC opposition, however.

466

467

Fig 3 shows a similar plot for the relationship of a mother’s level of opposition to FGMC

468

with her daughter’s predicted hazard of FGMC across communities with different levels of

469

opportunities for women, for the age-risk-set 2–11. The downward slope in the plot shows that the

470

coefficient for maternal opposition to FGMC, again, was more negative in communities with more

471

opportunities for women. Specifically, maternal opposition to FGMC was more protective against a

472

daughter’s risk of FGMC in communities where women had more opportunities outside of

473

marriage. The coefficients for maternal opposition to FGMC were significant in communities with

474

extra-marital opportunities 2.79 SD below the mean level of opportunity or higher. Thus, in addition

475

to a critical mass of opposition to FGMC, as predicted by social norms theory, there appears to be a

476

“tipping point” of women’s opportunity, as well. In communities below this tipping point, mothers

477

who oppose FGMC are less likely to enact their preferences. Again, in this sample, only two

478

communities would have a value less than 2.79 SD below the community grand mean of women’s

479

opportunity. Results for the other age risk sets are consistent.

Discussion

484

This analysis was the first to test an integrated gender-systems theory for the community-

485

level influences on the hazard that a daughter experiences FGMC in a North African country that

486

historically has adhered to a classic patriarchal family system (59). We examined to what extent

487

norms opposing FGMC and more extra-familial opportunities for women in the community were

488

associated with a girl’s lower risk of FGMC. We also assessed to what extent maternal opposition to

489

FGMC was more strongly associated with the hazard of cutting a daughter in communities with

490

more unfavorable FGMC norms and greater extra-familial opportunities for women. We leveraged

491

rich data on FGMC from the 2014 Egypt DHS, which is well suited for multilevel analyses of

492

community characteristics.

493

As expected, more unfavorable FGMC norms in the community were directly associated

494

with a lower hazard that a daughter was cut (H1). However, extra-familial opportunities for women

495

in the community were not directly associated with this hazard. Still, as expected, maternal

496

opposition to FGMC was more negatively associated with the hazard that a daughter was cut in

497

communities with more unfavorable FGMC norms and greater extra-familial opportunities for

498

women (H2). These findings were robust to the inclusion of controls, and therefore, provide good

499

support for a gender-systems theory of the multilevel influences on FGMC. Thus, mothers who

500

oppose FGMC are less likely to have their daughter cut if they live in a community that more

501

strongly opposes FGMC and offers more opportunity for women outside the family.

502

Results were mixed about there being a “tipping point” in community FGMC norms and

503

women’s opportunities above which maternal opposition to FGMC reduces a daughter’s hazard of

504

FGMC. In most age risk sets, the coefficient for the relationship of maternal opposition to FGMC

505

with a daughter’s risk of FGMC was significant and negative, even in communities that strongly

506

favored FGMC and had limited opportunities for women, relative to the average community in

507

Egypt. Evidence supporting a “tipping point” was strongest only for the youngest age risk set (0–1),

508

in which the probability of FGMC was very low.

509

Egypt provides a salient test case for our theory, being the country with the largest number

510

of girls and women who have been cut and a persistently high prevalence of FGMC (11). In

511

countries where more variation in the practice of FGMC exists, and thus a wider range of

512

community normative contexts, we might expect an even stronger association of an unfavorable

513

community gender system with daughter’s risk of FGMC. Yet, some distinctive features of the

514

Egyptian context may make it difficult to generalize results across all countries where FGMC is

515

practiced. Egypt has a strong national identity dominated by a single ethnic group and a single

516

religion, although with visible minority groups (36). Thus, the nature of social identity and the

517

relationship of FGMC to a sense of group belonging may differ in Egypt than in the multiethnic

518

states that dominate sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, although there is a large rural population in

519

Egypt, the Egyptian economy is more diversified and less dependent on subsistence agriculture than

520

are the economies of other countries where FGMC is common. The greater economic opportunity

521

outside family-based agriculture, coupled with persistent elements of classic patriarchy that reinforce

522

women’s economic dependence on male family members (59), may make expanded opportunities

523

for women outside the family more consequential in Egypt than in other contexts (34). Comparative

524

research to address these questions is warranted. Also, conditions surrounding the practice of

525

FGMC in diaspora communities, where the maintenance of gender norms is tied to questions of

526

cultural preservation and immigrant integration, may be distinct and require specific theorization.

527

Limitations and implications for research
25

528

This analysis was not without limitations, which can inform recommendations for research.

529

First, the cross-sectional design of the DHS limited our ability to establish the timing of community-

530

level characteristics before the onset of a daughter’s risk of cutting. We addressed this limitation by

531

constructing community-level factors using data from ever-married women 20–49 years, an older

532

cohort than the one for which the FGMC outcome was observed. Still, if the composition of a

533

community changed substantially or if families moved between a daughter’s birth and the survey,

534

our community-level measures may have misrepresented the salient factors at the time of decision-

535

making about FGMC. This measurement error would tend to reduce the precision of estimates and

536

downwardly bias coefficients. Re-estimating final models without the oldest daughters (15–20 years)

537

confirmed that the relationship of community FGMC norms with a daughter’s risk of FGMC was

538

stronger. Thus, longitudinal surveys are needed to measure time-varying community characteristics

539

before the onset of a daughter’s risk of FGMC.

540

Second, the DHS sample cluster was a proxy for “community.” The DHS is not designed

541

for aggregation at the cluster level, and sample averages may produce imprecise estimates of true

542

cluster characteristics, especially when the number of women per cluster is small and the intra-class

543

correlation (ICCs) of the predictors is low (98). Depending on the characteristic being estimated,

544

sample means also may produce biased estimates if the degree of precision is related to other

545

community characteristics. In this sample, the mean cluster size was 24 ever-married women 20–49

546

years (range 1–127, SD 13). Estimated ICCs for community opportunities and community norms

547

were .30 and .27, respectively, above the .20-level at which bias becomes unacceptable for the

548

standard DHS cluster size of 25 respondents (98). Still, the average cluster size was small, so we

549

cannot state definitively the level of the bias of cluster-level estimates without conducting

550

simulations. Prior simulations have shown that the bias produced by using DHS sample clusters to

551

estimate community characteristics is small (98). Surveys intended for multilevel analyses should

552

draw separate within-community samples that are large enough to construct unbiased estimates of

553

community-level characteristics that are measured by aggregating individual responses (99).

554

Third, a conceptual concern with using the DHS sample cluster as the measure of

555

community is that the cluster may not capture the multiple social communities in which mother-

556

daughter pairs are embedded (38). Network, spatial, and qualitative data to measure women’s

557

overlapping activity spaces and social-group memberships would offer a more nuanced

558

understanding of the relevant socio-contextual influences on a daughter’s risk of cutting.

559

Fourth, our measure for women’s community-level opportunities relied on indicators of

560

schooling attainment, engagement in market work, and age at first residence with a spouse. These

561

measures are important but may not capture the range of women’s local opportunities, nor women’s

562

experience of opportunity. More contextualized community-level measures of women’s

563

opportunities, or empowerment, may influence more strongly a daughter’s risk of FGMC.

564

Fifth, the community-level exposures of interest were correlated, such that communities

565

tending to disfavor FGMC also tended to have more opportunities for women. Our theory of

566

gender systems predicted some correlation among these measures and their distinct influences; still,

567

distortion due to multi-collinearity may be a concern. In descriptive analyses, these community-level

568

exposures had an estimated Pearson pairwise correlation of 0.64; however, in models using only one

569

of the two community-level exposures, standard errors for the two community measures changed

570

very little in these models, suggesting that collinearity was not a major problem. Thus, these

571

constructs arguably were correlated but distinct components of a community gender system.

572

Finally, our analysis focused on two levels–the mother-daughter pair and the community.

573

Yet, the influences of regional or national conditions warrant consideration. In sensitivity analyses,

574

results for primary explanatory variables were robust to including region fixed effects in our final

575

model. Since our primary interest was in community norms, community opportunity structures, and

576

cross-level interactions, we retained the more parsimonious model without regional dummies. In

577

future analyses, comparing individual, community, and national influences on a daughter’s FGMC

578

risk would reflect a comprehensive ecological model of change.

579

Implications for policies and programs

580

Our findings have several implications for policies and programs. Community-level

581

opposition to FGMC had a direct association with daughter’s FGMC risk and strengthened the

582

protective effect of maternal opposition to FGMC. This finding corroborates evidence from

583

TOSTAN, a quasi-experimental intervention study of the relationship between a human-rights-

584

based community empowerment and educational curriculum and girls’ risk of experiencing FGMC.

585

In TOSTAN, communities were engaged in participatory dialogues and community-based activities

586

grounded in the principles of human rights, democratic processes, and women’s health, among other

587

topics. At the completion of these dialogues, communities deliberated and spearheaded collective

588

decisions about abandoning harmful practices, including FGMC, and engaged neighboring

589

communities to adopt the same new norms. The study showed evidence of diffusion of

590

abandonment from program participants to non-participants and more unfavorable attitudes about

591

FGMC and lower prevalence of cutting girls in intervention than comparison areas (100). Thus,

592

interventions aimed at changing collective perceptions of FGMC—such as community pledges to

593

reject FGMC—may have multiplicative impacts on daughters’ outcomes.

594

Community-level opportunities for women were not directly associated with daughter’s

595

FGMC risk, but our results imply that improving opportunities for women may reduce the risk of

596

FGMC among daughters whose mothers oppose the practice. Thus, future community-based

597

interventions might consider joint activities that involve informal educational opportunities and

598

training in income-generating activities for mothers. Future research should explore the joint

599

influence of community FGMC norms among men on the risk of FGMC among daughters and

600

whether engaging men in community-based programs would help to accelerate the abandonment of

601

FGMC. Going forward, practitioners should consider intervention packages that address community

602

gender norms specific to FGMC and that provide enabling resources to mothers, which empower

603

them collectively to imagine alternatives to dependence on marriage in the life course trajectories of

604

their daughters. Any effort to shift gender norms and opportunity structures will be most effective if

605

it attempts to respect the values of local communities.

606

Despite the importance of community context, we also found that maternal opposition to

607

FGMC was protective for daughters at most ages, even in communities that strongly opposed

608

change. Thus, even where community-level interventions are infeasible, interventions focused on the

609

beliefs of individuals may support change. Individual-level interventions might include provider

610

support for non-cutting during clinic visits, or one-on-one support from outreach workers or

611

religious leaders.

612

Conclusion

613

Results provide good support for a gender-systems theory of the multilevel influences on

614

FGMC. Integrated, multilevel interventions that address community-level gender norms about

615

FGMC, community-level opportunities for women outside the family, and personal beliefs about

616

FGMC among mothers of at-risk daughters may be needed for sustainable declines in the practice.
