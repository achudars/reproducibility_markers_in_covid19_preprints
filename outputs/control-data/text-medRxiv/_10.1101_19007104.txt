Abstract

49

Study Objectives

50

To determine the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults with

51

Down syndrome (DS), to investigate factors related to OSA severity and to identify

52

which sleep questionnaire is the most appropriate for the screening of OSA in this

53

population.

54

Methods

55

Cross-sectional study that consecutively included 60 adults with DS. All patients

56

underwent type III polysomnography and clinical and laboratory data were collected;

57

sleep assessment questionnaires were applied. Multiple linear regression models

58

evaluated the associations between OSA severity (measured by the respiratory event

59

index - REI) and clinical and laboratory data and sleep questionnaires (Epworth

60

Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, BERLIN and STOP-Bang

61

questionnaires).

62

Results

63

Results show that 60 (100%) adults with DS had OSA, with moderate-severe

64

OSA identified in 49 (81.6%). At the multivariate linear regression, REI significantly

65

correlated with hematocrit levels, BMI and STOP-Bang questionnaire (SBQ) results (P

66

<0.001). The positive STOP-Bang ≥3 points) showed 100% of sensitivity (95%CI:

67

92.75-100%), 45.45% of specificity (95%CI: 16.75-76.62), positive predictive value of

68

89.09% (95%CI: 82.64-93.34%), negative predictive value of 100%, accuracy of 90%

69

(95%CI: 79.49-96.24%) and OR of 24.29.

71

Adults with DS have a very high prevalence of OSA. Hematocrit levels, BMI

72

and SBQ showed a strong correlation with OSA severity. The SBQ performed well in

73

identifying moderate to severe OSA in this population. Considered together, these

74

results point to the need to perform OSA screening in all adults with DS, and STOP-

75

Bang may play a role in this screening.

Introduction

97

Down syndrome (DS) is the most prevalent chromosomal abnormality, with

98

approximately 5.4 million affected individuals worldwide[1], with 206,000 of these

99

patients in the United States[2]. In the last decades, the life expectancy of individuals

100

with DS has considerably increased and currently exceeds 60 years in developed

101

countries.[1] A common comorbidity in adults with DS is obstructive sleep apnea

102

(OSA), of which prevalence ranges from 78-100% in these individuals.[3-8] Moreover,

103

when compared to the general population, the OSA is more often classified as severe

104

and is associated with more significant hypoxemia in individuals with DS.[3] In turn,

105

OSA-related hypoxemia has been associated with decreased verbal IQ, executive

106

function, visual-perceptual skills and increase in mood disorders in patients with DS.[9]

107

The higher prevalence and severity of OSA in patients with DS is related to the

108

phenotypic characteristics of DS itself. These changes include upper airway hypotonia,

109

midface hypoplasia, mandibular hypoplasia, glossoptosis, lingual tonsil hypertrophy,

110

pharyngomalacia, laryngomalacia, and tonsil / adenoid hypertrophy. Additionally,

111

factors such as obesity and hypothyroidism, which are also frequently observed in

112

individuals with DS, favor OSA onset.[3,9,10]

113

Despite the high risk for OSA in individuals with DS, recommendations for

114

OSA screening and polysomnography in this population are not well established. The

115

American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that polysomnography be performed in

116

all children with DS up to the age of 4, or earlier, if OSA symptoms are present.[11] As

117

for adult patients with DS, the recommendation is also to perform OSA screening, but it

118

is not clearly defined how the screening should be performed (e.g., using a

119

questionnaire or through polysomnography), nor the periodicity of this screening (e.g.,

120

annual or biannual assessment). Another important issue is that, for the adult population

121

with DS, there are no validated questionnaires for OSA screening and there is no

122

specific recommendation on which questionnaire should be applied to this special group

123

of patients.

124

Considering that in the overall population, adequate OSA treatment helps to

125

reduce the incidence of comorbidities and improve neurocognitive functions[12], the

126

identification of OSA in patients with DS is essential to ensure a better neurological

127

prognosis.

128

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate OSA prevalence and

129

factors associated with OSA severity in adult patients with DS. Moreover, we

130

investigated which questionnaire is the most appropriate for OSA screening in this

131

population.

132
133

Methods and materials

134

This study was carried out from October 2017 to October 2018 and included 66

135

adults with DS attending the Down Syndrome Reference Center (CRISDOWN) of

136

Hospital Regional da Asa Norte (HRAN) linked to Faculdade de Medicina da Escola

137

Superior de Ciências da Saúde (ESCS), Brasília, Federal District, Brazil.

138
139

Subjects were sequentially recruited and submitted to type III polysomnography,
anthropometric data collection, laboratory tests and sleep assessment questionnaires.

140

The inclusion criteria comprised individuals with DS treated at our service, of

141

both genders, good overall health status, aged 18 years and older, capable to understand

142

and accept the study and its procedures. The following were excluded: (1) individuals

143

under 18 years of age; (2) patients undergoing treatment for sleep disorders; (3) patients

144

with a history of conditions that could affect brain structure or function (such as

145

cerebrovascular accident or head trauma); (4) those who refused to participate in the

146

study.

147

A researcher explained the study in details to all participants with DS and their

148

proxies. Those who agreed to participate in the study signed the free and informed

149

written consent form. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of

150

Fundação de Ensino e Pesquisa em Ciências da Saúde (FEPECS) according to Opinion

151

number 1,656,332/2016 and followed the principles established by the Declaration of

152

Helsinki.

154

Data Collection and Research protocol

155

After the study participants were defined, a structured interview was carried out

156

to collect the following data: age, gender, BMI, neck circumference (NC), Mallampati

157

class and comorbidities. Venous blood samples were obtained for analysis after a

158

fasting period of 12 to 15 hours. Laboratory tests included complete blood count,

159

thyroid

160

aminotransferase (ALT), uric acid, urea, creatinine and sodium levels.

stimulating

161

The following questionnaires were also applied for sleep assessment: Epworth

162

Sleepiness Scale (ESS)[13,14], Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)[15], BERLIN

163

Questionnaire (BQ)[16,17], and the STOP-Bang Questionnaire (SBQ)[18,19].

164

In the sleep assessment questionnaires, due to the absence of cutoff points

165

specifically defined for the adult population with DS, the ones defined for the overall

166

population were used, as follows: (1) probable presence of excessive daytime sleepiness

167

in the ESS (total score> 10)[13]; (2) poor sleep quality in the PSQI (total score >5)[15];

168

(3) risk for OSA in the BQ (two or more positive categories)[17]; (4) risk for OSA in

169

the SBQ (3 or more affirmative answers)[18]. These questionnaires were answered by

170

the patients’ proxies, in agreement with other studies in individuals with DS.[4,5,20]

171

Moreover, all research subjects underwent type III polysomnography according

172

to international guidelines.[21] This type III polysomnography has been previously used

173

in OSA studies in individuals with DS[22] and in other populations[23,24].

174

In the present study, the equipment used to perform the type III PSG

175

assessments was the ApneaLink Air (ResMed Germany Inc.), which has been

176

previously used in other important studies.[23,24] This equipment allowed monitoring

177

with the use of nasal pressure cannula (for airflow and snore detection), chest

178

piezoelectric strap (for respiratory effort detection) and pulse oximetry (to monitor

179

peripheral arterial oxygen saturation - SpO2 and heart rate).

180

The total recording time was used as the denominator to calculate the respiratory

181

event index (REI).[21,25] The PSG was assembled by a specialized technician from the

182

Sleep Laboratory of our service. The patient was then referred to a temperature-

183

controlled and quiet bedroom, to undergo the all-night test, without the technician’s

184

supervision. All patients were accompanied by a proxy during the examination, who

185

slept in a separate bed, but in the same room. Recording of sleep examination records

186

started at 8pm and stopped at 7am in the following morning.

187

The respiratory events were defined as follows: (1) hypopnea, when there was a

188

≥30% reduction in airflow for at least 10 seconds, observed through the nasal cannula,

189

associated with a decrease in SpO2 of at least 3%; (2) obstructive apnea, due to the

190

absence or reduction ≥ 90% of airflow for at least 10 seconds in the presence of

191

respiratory effort; (3) mixed apnea, due to the absence or reduction ≥ 90% of airflow,

192

without the presence of respiratory effort only at the beginning of the event; (4) central

193

apnea, due to absence or ≥ 90% reduction in airflow for at least 10 seconds associated

194

with absence of respiratory effort throughout the event.[26]

195

The OSA was then classified as mild, moderate or severe. It was classified as

196

mild OSA when the REI was between 5 and 14.9 events / hour, moderate when the REI

197

was between 15 and 29.9 events / hour and severe when the REI was 30 or more events

198

/ hour (detected by type III polysomnography).[26]

199

The polysomnography exams were manually reviewed by a single physician

200

according to AASM standardized criteria.[26] The examiner was blinded to any patient

201

clinical data. The PSG examinations were considered valid when there was ≥ 4 hours of

202

adequate recording without significant loss of sensor signal (nasal pressure cannula,

203

pulse oximetry and chest strap).[27-29]

205

Statistical Analysis

206

Numerical data are presented as mean and standard deviation. Categorical data

207

are presented as absolute numbers and percentage. The statistical analysis was initially

208

performed with simple (univariate) linear regression analysis to identify factors

209

correlated with REI. Subsequently, variables with p-values <0.15 were considered for

210

the multiple linear regression analysis, using variable selection according to the

211

backward technique. A p-value <0.05 was used as the criterion for the retention of

212

variables in the final multiple linear regression model.[30,31] Logarithmic

213

transformation was used to obtain the dependent variable distribution normalization.

214

estimating the variance inflation factor (VIF), with VIF >5 being used as an indication

217

of multicollinearity in the multiple linear regression analysis.[31]

218

The adjusted coefficient of determination R2 was used as a measure of fit

219

quality. Normality was assessed by visual inspection of histograms and by applying the

220

Shapiro-Wilk normality test.[32,33]

221

The sleep questionnaires that remained in the final multiple linear regression

222

analysis model were used as categorical variable (positive or negative questionnaire)

223

together with moderate to severe OSA (present or absent) in 2x2 contingency tables.

224

Consequently, odds ratio (OR), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV),

225

negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy were calculated.

226

The R software (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) was used for statistical data

227

analysis.[32,33] All hypothesis tests were bilateral. Values of p <0.05 were considered

228

significant.

229
230

Results

231

During the study period, 66 adults with DS were included in the research. Of

232

this total, 60 completed and 06 patients (9%) dropped out of the study out of their own

233

will. Ten percent (6 subjects) had to undergo the PSG again due to technical problems,

234

such as loss of signal from one of the sensors.

235

Table 1 shows the participants’ demographic characteristics (N = 60). A total

236

of 33 men (55%) and 27 women (45%) participated in the study and the mean age of the

237

sample was 27.7 ± 9.1 years. Obesity and overweight were observed in 27 (45%) and 14

238

(23%) subjects, respectively. Oropharyngeal examination showed that 52 (86%)

258

When performing the type III PSG, it was observed that the 60 (100%) study

259

individuals had OSA (REI ≥ 5 events / h), with moderate to severe OSA in 49 (81.6%).

260

Central sleep apnea syndrome (> 5 events / h) was not observed in any of the subjects.

261

At the simple linear regression analysis (Table 3), several variables showed a significant

262

linear association with the dependent variable (REI), such as uric acid, glucose,

263

hematocrit, HOMA-IR, BMI, ALT, neck circumference, Mallampati class, BQ, ESS,

264

PSQI and SBQ. However, the multiple linear regression analysis (final model), as

265

shown in Table 4, identified only hematocrit, BMI and SBQ as independent predictors

266

of REI. On average, for every 1-unit increase in the hematocrit or BMI variables, and

267

for SBQ to go from negative to positive, the REI response variable increased by 0.073,

268

0.028, and 0.616 respectively. None of the other sleep questionnaire scores (BQ, ESS,

269

and PSQI) demonstrated a significant positive linear association with REI.

As the SBQ remained in the final multiple linear regression model, the

276

contingency table analysis (2x2) with moderate to severe OSA was performed. Positive

277

SBQ (3 or more affirmative answers) showed 100% of sensitivity (95%CI: 92.75-

278

100%), 45.45% of specificity (95%CI: 16.75-76.62%), 89.09% of PPV (95%CI: 82.64-

Discussion

282

The present study contributes with important findings. First, when compared to

283

previously published studies[3-8], it included the largest number of adults with DS.

284

Second, it evaluated for the first time the role of the SBQ in OSA screening in this

285

population. Moreover, this was the first study to evaluate the prevalence of OSA in

286

adults with DS in Brazil.

287

Thus, we demonstrated that the prevalence of OSA in individuals with DS in our

288

sample was 100%. Moreover, 81.6% of the subjects had moderate to severe OSA.

289

Interestingly, participants with DS were included in the present study regardless of

290

whether or not they had significant complaints of sleep-disordered breathing. This fact

291

supports the idea of performing active OSA screening in all adult individuals with

292

DS[3,5] during routine consultations. Compared to other OSA studies in adult

293

individuals with DS, the prevalence of OSA was also high and ranged from 78 to 100%.

294

It is noteworthy that the number of individuals included in such studies was usually

295

small, the smallest with 3 patients and the largest with 47 individuals[3-8].

296

The difference in OSA prevalence between studies possibly derives from

297

heterogeneities between them, such as different types of polysomnography for OSA

298

diagnosis, as well as sample characterization and size.

299

Our results also demonstrated that BMI is positively correlated with OSA

300

severity indicated by the REI. This correlation corroborates the high prevalence of the

301

observed moderate to severe OSA, based on the fact that 68% of our adult patients with

302

DS were obese or overweight. This correlation between BMI and REI has been well

303

documented in the overall population[34] and in adults with DS[3,5,6].

304

Interestingly, the hematocrit level is also correlated with OSA severity. This

305

correlation has been previously identified in individuals in the overall population with

306

OSA[35,36]; however, this finding had not yet been demonstrated in the population of

307

adult individuals with DS. This correlation possibly reflects the presence and greater

308

severity of nocturnal hypoxemia that stimulates increased erythropoietin synthesis, with

309

consequent elevated erythrocyte production and increased hematocrit levels[35,36].

310

Regarding the use of questionnaires for OSA screening, our study was the first

311

to identify a questionnaire capable of playing a significant role in OSA screening in

312

adults with DS. The sensitivity and accuracy of the SBQ for detecting moderate to

313

severe OSA was 100% and 90%, respectively.

314

This result indicates that the SBQ should be applied to all adult individuals with

315

DS, thus helping to prioritize individuals who need to undergo the polysomnography.

316

This recommendation becomes important as we observe that the international guidelines

317

indicate OSA screening in adults with DS, but do not clearly indicate how this screening

318

should be performed[37-39].

319

Finally, regarding the results of the BQ, ESS and PSQI questionnaires not

320

showing a role in relation to OSA in our study, that is in accordance with the results of

321

the study by Giménez et al[5].

322

Our study shows some limitations. First, the individuals were submitted to a type

323

III PSG and not to a full PSG test. Consequently, we did not have information related to

324

sleep architecture, and OSA severity (REI) may have been underestimated. However,

325

the type III PSG has been used in DS with good results.[22,40-42] Moreover, the

326

number of technical problems that required the type III PSG to be repeated was small

327

(10% in our study), which is in accordance to previous studies in DS or not (3–

328

18%).[21,22,43-45] The present study was performed in a single center for DS patients

329

from a reference hospital. Therefore, it is possible that our results may represent a

330

specific population of adults with DS, since DS patients treated in a community care

331

institution were not included.

332
333

Conclusion

334

In conclusion, our study confirmed the very high prevalence of OSA in adults

335

with DS. Additionally, the SBQ, hematocrit levels and BMI showed a strong correlation

336

with OSA severity. Furthermore, the SBQ showed high sensitivity and specificity in

337

identifying moderate to severe OSA in this population. Taken together, these results

338

indicate the need for OSA screening in all adults with DS. Nevertheless, considering the

339

limited access to polysomnography for all patients, the use of hematocrit levels and

340

BMI, and especially the application of the SBQ can select the individuals at higher risk

341

for OSA who should undergo the polysomnography. However, further studies with a

342

larger population of patients with DS are needed for more definitive conclusions to be

343

drawn.
