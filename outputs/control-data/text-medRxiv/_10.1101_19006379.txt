Abstract:
Many genetic/genomic disorders are caused by genomic rearrangements.
Standard methods can often characterize these variations only partly, e.g. copy
number changes. We describe full characterization of complex chromosomal
rearrangements, based on whole-genome-coverage sequencing of long DNA
reads from four patients with chromosomal translocations. We developed a new
analysis pipeline, which filters out rearrangements seen in humans without the
same disease, reducing the number of loci per patient from a few thousand to a
few dozen. For one patient with two reciprocal chromosomal translocations, we
find that the translocation points have complex rearrangements of multiple DNA
fragments involving 5 chromosomes, which we could order and orient by an
automatic algorithm, thereby fully reconstructing the rearrangement. Some
important properties of these rearrangements, such as sequence loss, are
holistic: they cannot be inferred from any part of the rearrangement, but only
from the fully-reconstructed rearrangement. In this patient, the rearrangements
were evidently caused by shattering of the chromosomes into multiple
fragments, which rejoined in a different order and orientation with loss of some
fragments. Our approach promises to fully characterize many congenital
germline rearrangements, provided they do not involve poorly-understood loci
such as centromeric repeats.

Introduction
Various germline DNA sequence changes are known to cause rare
genetic disorders. Many small nucleotide-level changes (one to a few bases) in
4,143 genes have been reported in OMIM (https://www.omim.org/) (as of Aug
24, 2019), which are known as single gene disorders. In addition to these small
changes, large structural variations of the chromosomes can also cause
diseases.
Previous studies on pathogenic structural changes in patients with
genetic/genomic disorders found chromosomal abnormalities by microscopy, by
detecting copy number variations (CNVs) using microarrays1, or by detecting
both CNVs and breakpoints using high-throughput short read sequencing2.
However, there are difficulties in precisely identifying sequence-level changes
especially in highly similar repetitive sequences (e.g. simple repeats, recentlyintegrated transposable elements), or in finding how these rearrangements are
ordered3. Long read sequencing (PacBio or nanopore) is advantageous for
characterizing rearrangements in such cases, and is recently beginning to be
used for patient genome analysis to identify pathogenic variations4-6. In addition,
if rearrangements are complex (e.g. chromothripsis), long read sequencing
(reads are more than 10 kb in length) has a further advantage because one
read may encompass all or much of a complex rearrangement7. Chromothripsis
is a chaotic complex rearrangement, where many fragments of the genome are
rearranged into derivative chromosomes. Current approaches to analyze
chromothripsis usually need manual inspection to reconstruct whole
rearrangements. Detection and reconstruction methods for complex
rearrangements are needed to characterize pathogenic variations from whole
genome sequencing data.
In order to understand rearrangements between two sequences (e.g. a
read and a genome), we must determine equivalent positions, i.e. bases

descended from the same base in the most recent common ancestor of the
sequences. This is not necessarily easy, due to sequences that are similar but
not equivalent (e.g. alpha-1 and alpha-2 globin). If we compare two sequences
that have both undergone deletions, duplications, and rearrangements since
their common ancestor, it seems hard to reliably determine equivalent bases.
To make the problem tractable, we impose an assumption: that we are
comparing a derived sequence (a DNA read) to an ancestral sequence (the
genome)8. This means that every part of the read is descended from (equivalent
to) a unique part of the genome. (The exception is "spontaneously generated"
sequence not descended from an ancestor: this is rare, and we allow for it by
allowing parts of the read to not align anywhere.) Thus, we need to accurately:
divide the read into (one or more) parts and align each part to the genome. To
do this, we first learn the rates of small insertions, deletions, and each kind of
substitution in the reads9, then find the most-likely division and alignment based
on these rates8,10. We can also calculate the probability that each base is
wrongly aligned, which is high when part of a read aligns almost equally well to
several genome loci. This approach was previously used to characterize
rearrangements that are “localized”, i.e. encompassed by one DNA read8.
Here we extend this approach, to: find arbitrary (non-localized)
rearrangements, subtract rearrangements found in control individuals, then
order and orient rearranged DNA reads to fully reconstruct complex
rearrangements in derivative chromosomes.

Results
Nanopore sequencing of 4 patients with chromosomal translocations
We sequenced genomic DNA from 4 patients with reciprocal
chromosomal translocations using a nanopore long read sequencer,
PromethION (Supplementary Table 1). Clinical information of these patients is
described in the Supplementary methods and elsewhere11-14. We applied newly
developed software, dnarrange (https://github.com/mcfrith/dnarrange) to find
and characterize DNA sequence rearrangements in these patients. dnarrange
finds DNA reads that have rearrangements relative to a reference genome, and
groups reads that overlap the same rearrangement (Supplementary Methods).
Then, it filters out rearrangements that are seen in any of 33 control individuals
(Fig1, Supplementary Table 1). The number of read groups decreased
exponentially with the first several controls, then stabilized, which suggests that
there are numerous commonly shared rearrangements in the population (Fig2b,
Fig3b, Fig4b, Fig5b, Supplementary Table 2). Next, we merged (a.k.a.
assembled) the reads of each group into a consensus sequence using
lamassemble (https://gitlab.com/mcfrith/lamassemble), and realigned to the
reference genome. Representative examples of detected rearrangements are
shown with raw reads and consensus sequences in Supplementary Fig 1.
Computational time counts for this method (including filtering 33 controls) are
shown in Supplementary Table 3. After filtering, we used dnarrange-link to
infer the order and orientation of multiple groups, to understand the whole
rearrangement (Fig2c, Fig3c, e, Fig4d, e).

Patient 1
Patient 1 (Nishimura et al. described as Case2, and Bano et al. case
report)11,12 has de novo reciprocal translocation between chr2 and chrX,
46,X,t(X;2)(q22;p13) (Fig2a). The breakpoints were not detected by short read

sequencing15 though they were detected by more-painstaking breakpoint
PCR11, so we tested whether we could find this rearrangement with long reads.
We performed PromethION DNA sequencing (112 Gb), and found 2,773 groups
of rearranged reads compared to human reference genome hg38. After
subtracting rearrangements present in 33 controls, we found 80 patient-only
groups, of which two involve both chr2 and chrX (Fig2b). These are exactly the
reciprocal chr2-X translocation (Fig2c, Supplementary Fig 2). The breakpoints
agreed with reported breakpoints determined by Sanger sequencing11.
The other 78 groups of rearranged reads are mostly: tandem
multiplications (duplications, triplications, etc.), tandem repeat
expansion/evolution, large deletions, retrotransposon insertions (five L1HS, four
AluYa5, two AluYb8, three SVA, and one or two ERV-K LTRs), and other nontandem duplications (Fig2d-e, Supplementary Table 4, 5, Supplementary Fig 3).
These types of retrotransposon are known to be active or polymorphic in
humans16-18. One case appears to be an orphan 3’-transduction from an L1HS
in chr20: the L1HS was transcribed with readthrough into 3’ flanking sequence,
then the 3’-end of this transcript (without any L1HS sequence) was reversetranscribed and integrated into chr10 (Fig2e). Such orphan transductions can
cause disease19. We also found an insertion of mitochondrial DNA (NUMT) into
chr2 (Fig2e). Some of these rearrangements have been previously found in
other humans, e.g. the ERV-K LTR inserted in chr1220. Thus our subtraction of
rearrangements found in other humans was not thorough, especially because
patient 1 is Caucasian whereas most of our controls (32/33) are Japanese.

Patient 2
Patient 2 (Nishimura et al. described as Case1)11 has reciprocal
chromosomal translocation between chr4 and chrX, 46,X,t(X;4)(q21.3;p15.2)
and a 4 kb deletion of chrX and a 7 kb deletion of chr4 (Fig3a): these were

found previously by Southern blot combined with inverse PCR sequencing11 but
not by short read sequencing15. We performed PromethION DNA sequencing
(117 Gb), and found 3,336 groups of rearranged reads relative to the reference
genome, which reduced to 33 groups after control subtraction (Fig3b). Only 2
out of 33 groups involve both chr4 and chrX: they show a reciprocal unbalanced
chromosomal translocation exactly as described previously

11,15

(Fig3c,

Supplementary Fig 4). Another of the 33 groups shows a 43 kb deletion near
the translocation site at chrX:107943791-107986323 (Fig3c, Supplementary Fig
4), which eliminates the TEX13B gene (Supplementary Fig 4), and was not
previously described15. About half of the other rearrangements were tandem
multiplication and retrotranspositions (Fig3d, Supplementary Fig 5,
Supplementary Table 4, 5). Three of the 33 groups lie near each other in
chr11q11 (Fig3e): they have a unique order and orientation that produces one
linear sequence, whereby we fully inferred the structure of this previouslyunknown rearrangement (Fig3e). The alignment dotplot (Fig3e) can be read
from top to bottom, showing where each part of the rearranged sequence
(vertical) comes from in the ancestral sequence (horizontal). This
rearrangement has translocated and inverted fragments, and three deletions,
including a 10kb deletion that removes most of the TRIM48 gene.

Patient 3: complex rearrangements at chr7-chr15 translocation
We next analyzed Patient 3 whose precise structure of chromosomal
translocations was only partly solved before13,15. Patient 3 was reported to have
two reciprocal chromosomal translocations between chr7 and chr15 as well as
between chr9 and chr14, t(7;15)(q21;q15) and t(9,14)(q21;q11.2) (Fig4a), and
has 4.6 Mb and ~1 Mb deletions on chr15 and chr7, respectively, which were
predicted by microarray, although the precise locations of breakpoints were not
detected in detail. We performed whole genome nanopore sequencing (95 Gb)

on this patient and found 3,351 groups of rearranged reads relative to the
reference genome, which reduced to 43 groups after control subtraction (Fig4b).
Fifteen out of 43 groups are involved in the two translocations: dnarrangelink found a unique way to order and orient them without changing the
number of chromosomes (Fig4c, Supplementary Fig 6). At first, there seem to
be two groups involving both chr9 and chr14, which accurately indicate the
balanced chr9-chr14 translocation described previously15. However,
dnarrange-link additionally identified a complex rearrangement for
t(9,14)(q21;q11.2). A part of chr4 was unexpectedly inserted to derivative chr9
(Fig4d). This rearrangement was not investigated in the previous analyses, as
chr7q21 was the primary locus for split-foot. In addition to this, dnarrange
identified 8 out of 43 groups involving chr7 and chr15 (Fig4c, Supplementary
Fig 6). The order and orientation of these groups was difficult to determine
immediately by manual inspection, but dnarrange-link found only one
possible way to connect them without changing the number of chromosomes
(Fig4c). Finally, dnarrange-link could automatically reconstruct the whole
rearrangements (Fig4d, e). The reconstructed rearrangements show that 3
fragments (breakpoint-to-breakpoint, asterisks in Fig4d, e) from chr4 and 1
fragment from chr14 were inserted into derivative chr9 (Fig4c, d), and 3
fragments from chr7 and 6 fragments from chr15 were inserted into derivative
chr15 (Fig4c, e). They show 677 kb and 4.7 Mb deletions on chr7 and chr15,
respectively, which were detected by microarray (Fig 4e). Note that these
deletions are not present in any part of the rearrangement, but only in the fullyreconstructed rearrangement: they are holistic properties of the complex
rearrangement. One candidate gene for split-foot, SEM1 was not disrupted, nor
had altered expression in lymphoblastoid cells (Supplementary Fig 7a, b,
Supplementary Results).

A striking feature of these rearrangements is that the rearranged
fragments come from near-exactly adjacent parts of the ancestral genome
(Fig4d, e). This suggests that the rearrangements occurred by shattering of the
ancestral genome into multiple fragments, which rejoined in a different order
and orientation with loss of some fragments. Such shattering naturally explains
why the fragments come from adjacent parts of the ancestor8.
We performed Sanger sequence confirmation for all 18 breakpoints
(Supplementary Fig 8, primer sequences: Supplementary Table 6). There were
only minor differences (usually 0 or 1 bases) between Sanger sequenceconfirmed breakpoints and dnarrange predicted breakpoints from
lamassemble consensus sequences (Supplementary Fig 9).
The other rearrangements are mostly local tandem-duplication or
insertions (Supplementary Table 4, 5, Supplementary Fig 10). We found one
processed pseudogene insertion, where exons of the MFF gene were inserted
into chr15 (Fig4g). Interestingly, there is also an AluYa5 insertion into chr15
nearby (Fig4g). Both Alu and processed pseudogene insertions are thought to
be catalyzed by LINE-1 encoded proteins: thus we speculate that these two
insertions did not occur independently.

Patient 4: difficult case with translocation breakpoint at centromere repeat
Patient 4 had a reciprocal translocation between chr1 and chr9
(Fig5a). Breakpoints in chr1 were previously described at chr1:206,401,153 and
chr1:206,402,729, which disrupted SRGAP2, by intensive investigations using
fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), Southern hybridization and inverse
PCR14, or short read whole genome sequencing15. Chr9 breakpoints have not
been found and were suspected to reside in repetitive centromeric
heterochromatin. We performed PromethION DNA sequencing (41 Gb), and
found 2,523 groups of rearranged reads relative to the reference genome,

which reduced to 14 after control subtraction, none of which indicate chr1-chr9
translocation (Fig5b, c, Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Fig 11). Dotplot pictures of reads that cross the chr1 breakpoint suggest that there is a
reciprocal translocation, but the other half of the read aligns (with low
confidence) to satellite or simple repeat sequences at centromeric regions on
multiple different chromosomes (Fig5d, two example reads are shown). This
limitation might be overcome by obtaining reads long enough to extend beyond
the centromeric repeats, or perhaps by obtaining a reference genome that is
more accurate in centromeric regions.

Discussion
We analyzed a variety of chromosomal translocations in 4 patients,
who were selected because previous studies had difficulty in determining
precise breakpoints by conventional approaches including microarrays and
short read sequencing. Especially, complex rearrangements in Patient 3 were
not solved even by intensive analysis13,15. Our method could not only precisely
detect breakpoints but also characterize how shattered fragments were ordered
and oriented. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no method to filter
patient-only rearrangements, and connect them to reconstruct rearranged
chromosomes by an automatic algorithm.
Recently, long read sequencing is becoming available for individual
genome analysis due to a decrease in cost and increase in output data size.
Accordingly, there have been a few approaches to use long read sequencing to
detect structural variations7,8,21, including tandem-repeat changes in rare
genetic diseases6, providing evidence that long read sequencing has a clear
advantage in precisely detecting rearrangements. We observed that multiple
breakpoints were jointly detected in a single read in Patient 3 (Supplementary

Fig 8d, e), because long enough reads can cover several breakpoints, which is
helpful to phase and order rearrangements. There are continuous efforts to
obtain longer nanopore reads, however, in case of complex rearrangements
(e.g. chromothripsis), it is not easy to cover whole rearrangements, as seen in
Patient 3, by current long read sequencing read length. Our new tool,
dnarrange-link is useful to infer a complete picture of complex
rearrangements. In addition, dnarrange-link can provide a clear
visualization of reciprocal chromosomal translocations, inversions or complex
rearrangements with or without loss of sequences as seen in patients 1, 2 and
3. Most importantly, sequence loss was indicated after reconstructed derivative
chromosomes were compared to the reference genome. We have shown that
sequence losses in patient 3 agree with previously described microarray results.
Previous studies on Patient 3 predicted 802 kb deletion (microarray could only
suggest ~1Mb deletion due to low resolution), because a small inversion (arrow
in Fig4e) was missed by previous studies using long PCR. We also presented
an example in Patient1, who has an inverted duplication on chr16, which was
only understood as copy number gain, or simply inversion, by microarray or
conventional sequencing technologies (Supplementary Fig 3, Supplementary
Table 5). In summary, our approach using dnarrange and long read
sequencing is superior to conventional approaches (e.g. microarray) because: it
can 1) connect multiple rearrangements, 2) subtract shared rearrangements,
and 3) detect balanced chromosomal rearrangements (e.g. inversion).
Our approach in this study narrowed down patient-only
rearrangements using 33 controls. The number of rearrangements decreased
exponentially with the first few samples to a few hundreds. This may be due to
the presence of common rearrangements in the population. We suspect large
numbers of controls will not be needed if there is a target rearrangement locus
(e.g. 4p15.2) because the number of candidates is small. In all 4 patients,

patient-only (not present in at least 66 autosomal alleles of 33 controls)
rearrangements were fewer than 100. If we were to further narrow down to
ultra-rare variations that may cause rare congenital disorders, a larger number
of controls may be considered. Patient 1 has more patient-only groups of
rearranged reads (80) than the other patients (33, 43 and 14). This is because
the patient is Caucasian and most of the control data used were Japanese
(32/33 datasets). Applying ethnicity-matched controls, or parents or other
relatives, will be useful to further remove benign rearrangements.
We noticed that large fractions of these rearrangements are insertions
or tandem multiplications (Supplementary Table 4). Perhaps surprisingly,
patient-specific simple inversions were uncommon. There are several types of
insertions which are also known to cause diversity of human genomes22 e.g.
transposable element (TE) insertions, especially L1HS, AluYa5 or AluYb823,
ERV24, nuclear mitochondrial DNA insertions (NUMT)25, or processed
pseudogene insertions26 (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig 12,
Supplementary Table 7). Interestingly, most of the inserted sequences were
aligned to TEs. TE insertions may be a common type of rare variation seen in
individuals. In addition to TE-insertion, we detected rare processed pseudogene
insertion in 3 patients. Two of these insertions were previously described with
allele frequency 1-10% in Japanese (MFF) and 1-10% in non-Japanese
(MATR3)26. We also observed non-tandem duplications that do not seem to be
retrotranspositions: interestingly, about half of these are localized, i.e. a copy of
a DNA segment is inserted near (e.g., within a few kb of) the original segment8
(see blue highlighted loci in Supplementary Table 5).
Our analysis proves useful despite its dubious assumption that the
reference genome is ancestral to the DNA reads. This may be partly because
we focus on disease-causing rearrangements, which are likely to be derived.
Also, incorrect rearrangements due to a non-ancestral reference may be found

in both patients and controls, thus filtered out. It would be useful to construct a
reference human genome that is ancestral (and complete), as far as possible,
because this simplifies the relationship between the reference and extant
human DNA sequences8.
Our method in combination with subtracting shared rearrangements in
control datasets has a great strength in precisely detecting chromosomal
rearrangements, including inversions, translocations, TE insertions, NUMT and
processed pseudogene insertions. There has been no method that can
effectively subtract rearrangements shared in the population, thus we believe
our method is useful to analyze complex rearrangements in a clinical setting
(i.e. rare genetic disease or perhaps cancer genomes). We also showed a
limitation of our method: detecting rearrangements in large repetitive regions
beyond the length of long reads in Patient 4. These regions are still elusive and
highly variable between individuals. To date there is no good method to detect
rearrangements in large repetitive regions (e.g. centromeric or telomeric
repeats) genome-wide. We hope our understanding of these still-intractable
regions will expand as sequencing technologies advance.
In conclusion, we developed an effective method to find chromosomal
aberration, with precise breakpoint identification, only from long read
sequencing. Our method also provides an automatic algorithm for
reconstruction of complex rearrangements. Long read sequencing may be
considered when chromosomal abnormalities are suspected.

Methods
Samples and ethical issues
All genomic DNA from patients and controls were examined after obtaining
informed consent. Experimental protocols were approved by institutional review
board of Yokohama City University under the number of A19080001.

dnarrange
dnarrange finds DNA reads that have rearrangements relative to a reference
genome, and discards "case" reads that share rearrangements with "control"
reads (Supplementary Methods). It takes one or more files of read-to-genome
alignments, where each file is a "case" or a "control". It assumes the alignments
have this property, which is guaranteed by last-split: each read base is
aligned to at most one genome base. dnarrange first performs these steps, for
cases and controls:

1. In order to recognize large "deletions" as rearrangements, if an alignment
has deletions >= g (a threshold; default 10kb), split it into separate
alignments either side of these deletions.

2. Get rearranged reads. We classify rearrangements into four types: interchromosome, inter-strand (if a read’s alignment jumps between the two
strand of a chromosome), non-colinear (if a read's alignment jumps
backwards on the chromosome), and "big gap" (if a read's alignment jumps
forwards on the chromosome by >= g).

3. Discard any "case" read that shares a rearrangement with any "control"
read. (Two reads are deemed to share a rearrangement if they have similar

rearrangements that overlap in the genome: the precise criteria are in the
Supplementary methods, Supplementary Fig 13, 14.)

It then performs these steps, for cases only:

4. Discard any read with any rearrangement not shared by any other read.
Repeat this step until no further reads are discarded (so that dnarrange
has the useful property of idempotence).

5. Group reads that share rearrangements. First, a link is made between any
pair of reads that share a rearrangement. Then, groups are connected
components, i.e. sets of reads linked directly or indirectly.

6. Discard groups with fewer than 3 reads.

dnarrange-link
dnarrange-link infers how the rearranged fragments found by dnarrange
are linked to each other, and thereby reconstructs the derived chromosomes. It
uses (the alignments of) one representative read per group. The representative
could be one actual read, or a consensus sequence. Based on the alignments,
the two ends of each read are classified as "left" if the alignment extends
rightwards/downstream along the chromosome starting from that end (shown as
"[ " in Fig6a) or "right" if the alignment extends leftwards/upstream ("]"). Two
ends may be directly linked only if:

* They are on the same reference chromosome.
* One is left and the other is right.

* The left end is downstream of (has higher reference coordinate than) the right
end.

In order to infer the actual links, we require some further information or
assumption. We make this assumption: there are as many links as possible, or
equivalently, the derived genome has as few chromosomes as possible. For
example, in Fig6a, B1 may be linked to C2, but in that case it becomes
impossible to link C1 to anything, and D1 to anything. Based on our
assumption, we instead link B1 to C1 and D1 to C2. In this example,
dnarrange-link infers two derivative chromosomes: one is reconstructed
from two reads by linking A2 to E1, the other is reconstructed from three reads
by linking D1 to C2 and C1 to B1 (Fig6b).

The two types of end, with linkability relationship, define a bipartite graph. To
infer the links based on our assumption, we find a "maximum matching" in this
graph. If there is more than one maximum matching, one is chosen arbitrarily,
and a warning message is printed. In Fig6, there is only one maximum
matching.

In Fig6a, the left and right ends occur in an alternating pattern along each
reference chromosome. In this case, we get a unique maximum matching by
linking adjacent left and right ends. This alternating pattern seems to occur
often in practice.

lamassemble merges overlapping DNA reads into a consensus sequence, by
these steps (details in the Supplement):

1. Calculate the rates of insertion, deletion, and substitutions between two
reads by "doubling" the rates from last-train, because errors occur in both
reads.
2. Use these rates to find pairwise alignments between the reads with LAST.
LAST also calculates the probability that each pair of bases is wrongly
aligned (which is high when there are alternative alignments with near-equal
likelihood).
3. Use the LAST alignments in descending order of score to define a tree for
progressive alignment by MAFFT.
4. Constrain the MAFFT alignment by anchoring pairs of bases that were
aligned by LAST with error probability <= 0.002.
5. Make a consensus sequence from the MAFFT alignment. Omit alignment
columns with gaps in > 50% of sequences covering that column. For each
column, get the base that maximizes prob(base|column), using the last-train
substitution probabilities.
Some results using a prototype of lamassemble were published previously6.

Nanopore sequencing using PromethION
DNA was extracted from patients’ blood cells. Libraries were prepared for
nanopore sequencing using DNA ligation kit (SQK-LSK109) then subjected to
PromethION sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Techonologies) using one PRO-002
(R9.4.1) flowcell according the manufacturer's protocol. Base-calling and fastq
conversion were performed with MinKNOW ver1.14.2. Control datasets were also
sequenced by PromethION. Base-calling and fastq conversion were performed
with MinKNOW ver1.11.5.

PCR primers for breakpoints estimated from rearrangements were designed
using primer3 plus software (Supplementary Table 6). PCR amplification was
done using ExTaq (Takara) and LATaq, then amplified products were Sanger
sequenced using BioDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit with 3130xl
genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA).

Figure legends
Figure 1. Schematic diagram of chromosomal rearrangement analysis
pipeline.
Long DNA reads are aligned to a reference genome using LAST (blue box),
then dnarrange finds rearranged reads, and groups reads that overlap the
same rearrangement (pink box). lamassemble merges/assembles each group
of reads into a consensus sequence (yellow box). When there is a “complex”
rearrangement (more than one group of rearranged reads is needed to
understand the full structure of the rearrangement), dnarrange-link was
used to infer the order and orientation of the groups, and thereby reconstruct
derivative chromosomes (green box).

The two ends of each read are arbitrarily labeled 1 and 2.
b. Derivative chr R was reconstructed by linking A2 to E1 (left). Derivative chr S
was reconstructed by linking B1 to C1, and D1 to C2 (right). B1 can also be
linked to C2, but in that case it is impossible to link C1 to anything, and D1 to
anything, thus this possibility was suppressed.
