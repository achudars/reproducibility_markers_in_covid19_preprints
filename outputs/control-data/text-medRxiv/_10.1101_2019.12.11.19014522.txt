Abstract
Background: Smoking is a likely risk factor for dementia, and smoking behavior has a strong genetic
component. In this study, we jointly test the associations between cumulative genetic risk for smoking,
smoking behavior, and cognitive status using a Mendelian randomization framework.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using the 2010 wave of the Health and Retirement Study
database. Individuals aged between 50 and 90 were included. Smoking status was self-reported. Polygenic
scores (PGSs) were calculated by weighting participant genotype by published smoking genome-wide
association estimates. Cognitive status (normal, impaired, dementia) was measured using multiple
assessments. A Mendelian randomization framework was used to infer causal relationships between
smoking behavior and cognitive status via genetic instruments.
Results: Among European ancestry participants (N = 8,735), current smoking behavior was positively
associated with cognitive impairment (OR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.29, 2.01) relative to normal cognition. Using
smoking PGS as an instrumental variable, a causal relationship was observed between current smoking
and cognitive impairment (OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.07, 2.18). There were no associations between smoking
PGS, smoking behaviors and cognitive status in the African ancestry study sample (N = 2,511).
Conclusions: Current smoking is a modifiable risk factor which causes cognitive impairment. Promotion
of smoking cessation is important for public health. Further studies on dose and duration of smoking
behaviors on cognitive impairment are critically needed, as well as in research other ancestries.

Introduction
Dementia is a serious neurodegenerative disorder characterized by difficulties in a person’s daily
life though memory loss, impaired language function, challenges in problem-solving, and changed
cognitive status.1 In the United States (US), 14% of people over age 71 have dementia and the total
medical care cost for all individuals with dementia was estimated at $277 billion in 2018.2,3 The most
common type of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which accounts for an estimated 60% to 80% of
dementia cases.4 Given the large public health burden of dementia, understanding risk factors is extremely
important.
Multiple environmental factors contribute to the incidence of dementia, such as internal
environment factors like diabetes and obesity, as well as external exposures like environmental
chemicals.5,6 Cigarette smoking is one of the most prevalent, but inconsistently, identified risk factors
associated with dementia. In the US, with a prevalence of 15.5% among adults aged 18 years and older in
2016, smoking behavior contributed to 10.8% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 3.0%, 19.8%) of the cases
of dementia.7,8 However, the results of associations between cigarette smoking and dementia in a number
of studies were contradictory.9–11 Further study of smoking as a risk factor for dementia and the
characteristics that contribute to likelihood of smoking, such as genetics, are essential areas of
investigation.
Smoking behavior is partially heritable. According to a former twin study, smoking initiation was
37% due to genetic factors.12 A previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified several
genes associated with smoking behavior, including a synonymous 15q25 single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) in the nicotinic receptor gene CHRNA3 (rs1051730[A]), two 10q25 SNPs (rs1329650[G] and
rs1028936[A]), and one 9q13 SNP in EGLN2 (rs3733829[G]).13 A total of 566 genetic variants in 406
loci were recently detected in relation to smoking initiation, cessation, or heaviness.14 A single SNP,
however, only accounts for a very small fraction of variability of the incidence of the disease or
behavior.15 Researchers have proposed capturing the cumulative genetic risk across loci by using

polygenic scores (PGSs). PGSs summarize an individual’s genetic association with a given trait into a
single score and increase the amount of variation explained in a trait over single variants.16,17
The causal relationship between smoking behavior and cognitive impairment has not been
rigorously assessed. Mendelian randomization is a method for genetic instrumental variable analyses,
which can be applied to observational epidemiology studies.18 Because smoking behavior has a large
genetic component, genetic sequences are established in early life, and child genotypes are a random
sorting of parental genotypes, genetic predisposition to smoking can be used as an instrumental variable
to infer causality testing with cognitive status. In the US nationally representative aging cohort, the Health
and Retirement Study (HRS), we examined smoking behavior, genetic predisposition to smoking
behavior, and cognitive status in European and African ancestry study samples. We first quantified the
association between cumulative genetic risk for smoking and smoking behavior. Then we tested the
association between smoking behavior and cognitive status. We next tested the assumption that
cumulative genetic risk for smoking was not associated with cognitive status. Finally, we conducted a
Mendelian randomization analysis to assess a potential causal relationship between smoking and
cognitive status, using genetic risk for smoking as an instrumental variable.

Methods
1. Health and Retirement Study
The HRS is a national longitudinal panel study of individuals over age 50 in the US.16 The HRS
has collected data on health and economic information related to aging every two years since 1992. More
than 43,000 individuals have participated to date.19 HRS data are publicly available
(https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/). This cross-sectional analysis used the 2010 wave of HRS to maximize the
number of cognitive impairment cases in a single wave. Asset and Health Dynamics among the Oldest
Old (AHEAD) and Asset and Health Dynamics among the Oldest Old (CODA) are two sub-studies of
HRS which included the oldest people in HRS.20 We excluded participants who were in these two studies

as well as those younger than 50 or over 90 at 2010, because the diagnostic challenges, risk factors, and
underlying neuropathological features of dementia are considerably different compared to octogenarians
and younger.21 Our final study sample included 11,246 participants. (Supplementary Figure 1).

2. Cognitive status outcome assessment
The main outcome, cognitive status, was categorized in three levels as normal, cognitive
impairment-non dementia (CIND), or dementia. The categorization method depended on whether the
respondent could participate in the interview themselves, or due to physical or cognitive problems
required a proxy respondent. Self-respondent categories were based on performance on a 27-point scale,
including an immediate and delayed 10-noun free recall test, a serial 7 subtraction test, and a backward
count from 20 test.22 The proxy categories were based on an 11-point scale. The proxy categorization
used the proxy’s assessment of the respondent’s memory, whether the respondent had limitations in five
instrumental activities of daily living (managing money, taking medication, preparing hot meals, using
phones, and shopping for groceries), and whether the respondent had difficulty completing the interview
because of a cognitive limitation. Cognitive status cut points were established by Crimmins et al. and
have been validated clinically and empirically. The sensitivity of the cognitive outcome status variable
was estimated as 78%.23

3. Exposure assessment and demographic characteristics
Smoking status was retrieved from the RAND HRS Longitudinal File.24 Participants were
classified into never smokers, former smokers (reported ever smoking in the previous waves but not
smoking at 2010), and current smokers (reported smoking at 2010).
Other demographic covariates used in the analysis included age, sex, years of education,
rural/urban residence, body mass index (BMI), average exercise level, ever drinking alcohol, history of
hypertension, diabetes, and/or depression, and stroke status. Age (yrs), sex (male/female), ever drinking
alcohol and stroke history (Yes/No) were self-reported. Years of education was a continuous variable

representing total number of years in school. Urban/rural residence was based on the 2003 Beale RuralUrban Continuum Code, which divided living areas into urban, suburban, and ex-urban.25 BMI
(kilograms/meters2) was generated by self-reported weight and height. Average exercise level was created
from self-reported physical activity variables (vigorous, moderate, and mild) in the HRS. The original
exercise variables were coded in a 5-point scale (1= every day to 5 = hardly ever or never). We reverse
coded and averaged the three scores to represent an individual’s average exercise level. Hypertension,
diabetes, or depression status (Yes/No) were generated from the self-report question of “Have you ever
been told by doctor that you have … (the disease)?”. All variables were assessed at the 2010 HRS wave.
4. Genetic Data
Respondents provided saliva samples after reading and signing a consent form during an
enhanced face-to-face interview in either 2006, 2008, 2010, or 2012 waves of the HRS. Details of the
genotype collection and quality control are available elsewhere.26 Genotype measures were obtained using
the Illumina HumanOmni2.5 BeadChip and genotyping was conducted by the Center for Inherited
Disease Research. Genotype data that passed initial quality control were released to and analyzed by the
Quality Assurance/Quality Control analysis team at the University of Washington.
A PGS is a single quantitative measure of genetic risk, which aggregates multiple individual loci
across the human genome and weights them by effect sizes derived from the GWAS. The PGSs for AD
and smoking initiation were downloaded from a published dataset by the HRS. The construction of PGSs
for each phenotype was based on a single, large, replicated GWAS. The smoking PGS was created using
results from a 2010 GWAS conducted by the Tobacco and Genetics Consortium.13 The AD PGS was
created using results from a 2013 GWAS conducted by the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s
Project.27 Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is an important independent risk gene for AD.28 We used the AD
PGS without the two variants that contribute to APOE status (rs7412, rs429358), in addition to a binary
variable of whether the individual is an APOE-ε4 allele carrier in our fully adjusted model in the
sensitivity analysis.29 APOE-ε4 allele carrier was defined as individuals who have any copies of ε4.

Population stratification, that is, the allele frequency differences due to ancestry, could cause
spurious associations between PGSs and the outcome of interest in disease studies.30 To control for
confounding from population stratification and ancestry differences in genetic structures within
populations, we conducted analyses separately by ancestry and adjusted for a set of five ancestry-specific
principal components (PCs), as suggested by the HRS Documentation.29 Genetic ancestry (European or
African) was identified through the union of PC analysis on genome-wide SNPs calculated across all
participants and self-identified race/ethnicity.

5. Statistical Analysis
5.1 Descriptive Analysis
All analyses were conducted in R version 3.5.1.31 The distributions of demographic, genetic, and
behavioral factors were characterized using univariate analysis within included and excluded samples
separately. Bivariate analyses were used to describe the distributions of covariates by outcome and
exposure levels. For categorical variables, counts and frequencies for different cognitive or smoking
levels were calculated. Chi-square tests were conducted to test for homogeneity between exposure or
outcome groups. For continuous variables, means and standard deviations were calculated and a t-test or
Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to assess differences between groups, as appropriate. Pearson
correlations between each pair of variables were calculated and visualized using a heatmap. We further
compared the smoking PGS and AD PGS using LD Hub to check for pleiotropy, defined as one gene
which codes and controls the phenotype or expression of two or more different and unrelated traits.32,33
All data analyses were stratified by genetic ancestry.
5.2 Regression Analysis
We used multivariable regression to test the associations between smoking PGS and smoking
behavior on cognition status (Supplementary Figure 2). The cognition classification (normal, CIND,
dementia) first suggested an ordinal analysis. We observed violations of the proportional odds assumption

at all variables, except the smoking PGS. Thus, we elected to perform logistic regressions with the glm()
function in the stats package for each level of cognition.34 We considered never smokers and those with
normal cognition as the reference groups. In Model 1, we tested for an association between smoking PGS
and smoking status. In Model 2, we tested for an association between smoking status and cognitive status.
In Model 3, we tested for a direct association between smoking PGS and cognitive status, adjusting for
smoking status. We conducted four sets of exposure/outcome comparisons in each model: A) former or
never smokers with CIND or normal cognitive status; B) former or never smokers with dementia or
normal cognitive status; C) current or never smokers with CIND or normal cognitive status; D) current or
never smokers with dementia or normal cognitive status. We computed crude, unadjusted models. Our
primary models were adjusted for age, sex, years of education, rural/urban residence, and five ancestryspecific PCs. Our primary analysis was in the European ancestry group. Population attributable fractions
(PAFs) were also calculated for significant associations. We considered P value < .05 for statistical
significance. We reported odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI.
5.3 Mendelian Randomization Analysis
We used Mendelian randomization to examine whether the relationship between smoking
behaviors and cognitive status is causal in our analysis. Our regression results met the three key
assumptions of Mendelian randomization: 1) relevance assumption: the genetic variants associate with the
risk factor of interest; 2) independence assumption: there are no unmeasured confounders of the
association between genetic variants and outcome; 3) exclusion restriction: the genetic variants affect the
outcome only through the effect on the risk factor of interest.35 Mendelian randomization was conducted
in the same subsets (A-D) as the regression analyses. We used mr_input() and mr_ivw() functions from
the MendelianRandomization package to build input and conduct estimation of causal effects.36 Within
the function, we specified “Model 1” with smoking PGS as the exposure and smoking status as the
outcome, and “Model 2” with smoking PGS as the exposure, and cognitive status as the outcome. The

models were not adjusted as Mendelian randomization is not subject to confounding.37 ORs for the causal
effect, along with their 95% CI and P value were reported.
5.4 Stratified Analysis
We investigated whether the association between smoking PGS and cognitive status varied by
smoking status. We tested for an association between smoking PGS and cognitive status, stratified by
smoking status (never, former, and current), and visualized the association using scatter plots, with all the
covariates set to the mean or reference group. We further tested for an interaction term between smoking
PGS and smoking status on cognitive status.
5.5 Sensitivity Analyses
We performed several sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings. First, we
incorporated supplementary health risk factors. In addition to the covariates in the primary regression
models, we adjusted for BMI, average exercise level, ever drinking, history of hypertension, diabetes,
and/or depression, and stroke status. We next performed a set of sensitivity analyses including dementia
genetic risk factors. In addition to the covariates in the primary regression models, we adjusted for AD
PGS and any APOE-ε4 allele carrier status.
To examine potential recall bias, defined as a systematic error resulting from differences in
accuracy of recollections recalled by study participants,38 we compared the self-reported smoking statuses
in 2008 (previous wave) to 2010 (primary analytic wave). We also compared the cognitive status in 2008
and 2010 to assess phenotype robustness.
Finally, all regression analyses were conducted in the African ancestry study sample. Code to
produce all analyses in this manuscript are available (https://github.com/bakulskilab).

Results
1. Descriptive analysis
Our primary analytic sample (N = 11,246) was 56.1% female, 77.7% European ancestry, with an
n
average age of 65.0 years and 13.2 year of education. Participants included in our study sample did not
differ from excluded samples with respect to hypertension, depression history or AD PGS
(Supplementary Table 1). Our study sample had a lower mean age and education years, was more likely
ly
to be former smokers and be classified as having normal cognition than the excluded samples.
In the European ancestry study sample (N = 8,735), cognitive status differed by smoking
categories (P value < 0.001, Table 1). Current smoking was associated with higher proportion of CIND
participants. Former smoking was positively associated with cognitive impairment.

Older age, lower educational attainment, rural residence, stroke, APOE-ε4 allele carrier, higher
AD PGS, lower BMI, never drinking, lower average exercise level, hypertension, diabetes, and
depression were associated with cognitive impairment. Smoking PGS was not associated with cognitive
status. Younger age, lower education, stroke, ever drinking, lower average exercise level, hypertension,
diabetes, and depression were associated with higher levels of smoking behaviors. Higher smoking PGS
was associated with former and current smoking behaviors (Table 2).
No correlation >|0.4| was observed between any two covariates (Supplementary Figure 3).
Specifically, there were minor correlations observed between AD PGS and smoking PGS (r = 0.04, p <

0.01), and between AD PGS and smoking status (r = 0.02, p = 0.07). Those findings were consistent with
h
results provided by LD Hub (r = 0.101, p = 0.649).39

2. Regression analyses
In the European ancestry sample, smoking PGS is highly associated with smoking status (Table 3,
3
Model 1). In the primary adjusted model, a one standard deviation unit increase in smoking PGS was
associated with 1.27-1.28 times higher odds of former or current smoking behavior relative to never
smoking. These findings were robust to additional adjustment for health status and AD genetics
(Supplemental Table 2). PAF results suggested that 19.74% (95%CI: 11.03%, 28.46%) of the current
smoking cases were attributed to smoking genetics, after adjusting for age, sex, years of education,
rural/urban residence, and five ancestry-specific PCs (Supplemental Table 3).
Smoking behavior was associated with cognitive status in the European ancestry sample (Table 3,
3
Model 2). In the primary adjusted model, current smokers relative to never smokers had 1.62 (95%CI:
1.29, 2.01) times odds of CIND relative to normal cognition. 11.35% (95%CI: 5.87%, 16.83%) of the
CIND cases were attributed to current smoking, according to PAF analysis (Supplemental Table 3).
After additional adjustment for health status, current smokers relative to never smokers had 1.38 (95%CI:

1.09, 1.75) times odds of CIND relative to normal cognition. These positive associations were even
higher when additionally adjusted for AD genetics (OR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.29, 2.08) (Supplemental
Table 2). No associations were observed between current smoking and dementia, or between former
smoking with either CIND or dementia.
Smoking PGS was not associated with cognitive status directly (Table 3, Model 3). This reflects
an important assumption of Mendelian randomization, that the instrumental variable (smoking PGS) is
only associated with the outcome through the primary exposure and not independently.

3. Mendelian randomization analyses
We observed strong positive association between smoking PGS and smoking status, positive
association between smoking behavior and cognitive status, and no association between smoking PGS

and cognitive status, which jointly met the key assumptions of relevance, independence, and exclusion
restriction for Mendelian randomization. A test of inferred causality of smoking behavior on cognitive
impairment was conducted using smoking PGS as the instrumental variable. According to Table 4,
current smokers relative to never smokers had 1.53 (95%CI: 1.07, 2.18) times risk of CIND relative to
normal cognition. However, no significant causal effect was found for current smoking on dementia, or
former smoking on either CIND or dementia. Current smokers relative to never smokers had 1.07 (95%CI
CI:
0.47, 2.45) times risk of dementia relative to normal cognition. Former smokers relative to never smokers
rs
had 0.97 (95%CI: 0.70, 1.36) times risk of CIND and 0.71 (95%CI: 0.37, 1.34) times risk of dementia
relative to normal cognition. Taken as a whole, there is a causal relationship only between current
smoking and cognitive impairment.

4. Stratified analysis
We did not observe an association between smoking PGS and cognitive status in the European
ancestry group, in any of the smoking strata (never, former, current) (Table 5). Regardless of statistical
significance, current and never smokers with higher smoking PGS had higher probability of CIND or
dementia versus normal status. We observed a significant interaction between former smoking status and
smoking PGS on CIND cognitive status (β = -0.200, p value = 0.02).

5. Sensitivity analyses
We assessed consistency in response to smoking questionnaires. There was no observation
reported as never smoker in the 2010 study sample who reported former or current smoker status in 2008,
8,
indicating lack of smoking misclassification. We further assessed sensitivity of cognitive status measures
over time. In 2008, there were 318 (4.2%) CIND and 9 (0.1%) dementia observations that had normal
cognitive status in the 2010 study sample (Supplemental Table 4).
The African ancestry analytic sample included 2,511 participants. We combined the CIND and
dementia groups to increase the power of the analysis. No associations were observed between smoking
PGS and smoking status, smoking PGS and cognitive status, or smoking status and cognitive status
(Supplemental Table 5). The regression results did not meet the Mendelian randomization assumptions,
thus, we did not pursue further causal inference testing.

Discussion
The present cross-sectional study was conducted among older adults from the HRS wave 2010.
To our knowledge, this is the first study using Mendelian randomization framework to examine the
relationship between smoking behaviors and cognitive status with a genetic instrument of cumulative
genetic risk for smoking behavior. In the European ancestry individuals, after adjusting for age, sex, years
of education, rural/urban residence and five ancestry-specific PCs, we found a strong positive association
between smoking PGS and smoking behaviors – one standard deviation increase in smoking PGS was
associated with 1.27-1.28 times odds of former or current smoking behavior relative to never smoking.
We also observed a positive association between current smoking and CIND relative to normal cognition:
current smokers had 1.62 times odds of CIND (95%CI: 1.29, 2.01) relative to never smokers. No
association was found between smoking PGS and cognitive status. A significant causal relationship was
found between current smoking and CIND.
Smoking PGS was positively associated with smoking behaviors in the European ancestry sample
only. The GWAS of smoking behaviors conducted by Tobacco and Genetics Consortium in 2010 focused
exclusively on participants of the European ancestry.13 Given that our methods for computing the
smoking PGS depended on summary statistics from this GWAS, risk alleles identified from this study
may be specific to the European ancestry and result in limited generalizability to other ancestral groups.40
Furthermore, only 2,511 individuals were included in our African ancestry analysis, versus 8,735 in the
European ancestry analysis. Thus, with the sample size and the European ancestry reference GWAS, we
were not surprised by the null association between smoking PGS and smoking behaviors observed in the
African ancestry sample.
We found current smokers compared with never smokers were at increased risk of CIND in the
European ancestry sample, which was consistent with previous studies.41–43 Potential biological
mechanism for this relationship could implicate elevated chronic oxidative stress in the brain and other
organ systems of smokers which may trigger the AD-pathophysiological process. Computed tomography

and magnetic resonance based studies also found supportive evidence of abnormalities in brain
morphology, perfusion and neurochemistry in smokers.44 Our null associations between former smoking
behavior and cognitive impairment were also similar to some previous studies.45,46 In addition to
examining the association, we also tested the causal relationship between smoking behaviors and
cognitive status in the European ancestry using Mendelian randomization. This method, which limits the
possibility of confounding, and the using of multiple variants (PGS) increased the power and test
assumptions.18
Mortality selection is a concern for both dementia and smoking. Smokers may die prematurely
from other smoking-related diseases before developing dementia. According to a study on HRS samples
from 1992-2005, the genotyped HRS respondents were longer-lived as compared with their nongenotyped respondents.47 Thus, the analysis of smoking and dementia was subject to survival bias; that is,
the samples in the study were biased toward healthier smokers – individuals who survived or did not
experience significant smoking-related morbidity.48,49 Furthermore, in reference to Supplementary Table
1, our study sample captured a lower proportion of dementia (included vs. excluded: 3.22% vs. 10.2%)
individuals. And the development of other smoking-related morbidity, such as cardiovascular diseases
and cancer, may also impede participation in the longitudinal HRS study. These could result in a selection
bias in that the study sample is not representative of the smokers in the general older population. Both the
survival and selection bias will bias the association between smoking behaviors and cognitive impairment
toward the null. Therefore, the smoking-related risk for cognitive impairment was likely underestimated
in our study.
In our current study, smoking status was categorized cross-sectionally using retrospective
assessments, and information on the number of cigarettes consumed or duration of smoking or cessation
was not included. Further studies, with more expansive smoking variables, will be needed to test the dose
effect of smoking on cognitive status. A similar study should be replicated in an African ancestry with a
larger sample size and PGSs based on GWASs among the African ancestry. These results could also be
strengthened by a longitudinal assessment of incident dementia.

Unlike genetic factors, smoking behaviors are modifiable, which can be effectively altered, and
promote a significant decrease in cases of dementia. The significant causal relationship found in our study
provide evidence to support current smoking as a risk factor for cognitive impairment in later life. The
null effect of former smoking suggests, while preliminary, a plausible protective effect of smoking
cessation. Thus, promotion of smoking cessation could be the most effective strategy for lowering
dementia prevalence over time at the population level.
In conclusion, in a cross-sectional analysis of the HRS, we found evidence of causality of current
smoking as a risk factor on cognitive impairment using genetic instruments. Additional studies on dose
and time-span effect of smoking behaviors on cognitive impairment are critically needed, as well as
studies in other ancestries. Public health campaigns should make explicit the connection between current
smoking and dementia as yet another reason to quit.
