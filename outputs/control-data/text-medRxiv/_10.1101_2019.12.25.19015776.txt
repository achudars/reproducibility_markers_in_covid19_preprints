Abstract
Background
Screening for Trypanosoma cruzi among blood and organ donors is essential to reduce Chagas disease
transmission. The World Health Organization (WHO) has prioritised curtailing transmission in blood
banks (BBs) and transplantation centres (TCs) by 50% by 2025 and 100% by 2030. This study aims to
update the situation on T. cruzi screening strategies in BBs and TCs to evaluate the evolution of
seroprevalence and the achievement of screening milestones globally.
Methods
We used published articles and government reports on seroprevalence data and screening policies in
BBs and TCs across the world. We conducted meta-analyses of T. cruzi seroprevalence estimates by
who region, endemicity status, and country, and used meta-regression to identify the covariates
influencing the estimates. Publication bias and sensitivity analyses were also conducted.
Results
Based on 99 studies and reports and found a global pattern of increased universal screening policies
(USPs) in BBs from 1990 to 2018. We found information for 50 countries, of which 44 (88%) have
implemented USPs and 21 (42%) achieved 100% coverage by 2015. Out of the 21 Chagas-disease
endemic countries, 20 are in advanced USPS stages, and 18 achieved 100% coverage by 2015. Latin
America (LA) was the first region to start USPS since the 1990s and 19 countries are in advanced stages
of implementation and by 2015 there is evidence of 100% coverage in 15 LA countries. In the Caribbean
Region, USPs are still in early implementation stages and by 2015 only five out of 24 countries have
achieved 100% coverage. Outside Latin America and the Caribbean, there are USPs only in the USA,
which initiated in 2007 and with 100% coverage in 2016. In Europe, there are no USPs, but some
countries have implemented selective screening of at-risk donors in the UK, Spain, France and
Switzerland. Whereas Sweden and Italy have implemented a deferral system. For TCs, national
guidelines have been produced in some European countries since the 2000s; in the USA, USPs started
since 2002, but 100% coverage is yet to be achieved. There is a global decrease in T. cruzi
seroprevalence among blood donors from the 1970s to 2010s, particularly in endemic countries, where
the T. cruzi pooled seroprevalence decreased from 2.42% (95% CI 0.75%-7.53%) in the 1970s to 0.38%
(95% CI 0.30%-0.60%) in the 2010s. Seroprevalence in non-endemic countries has remained relatively
stable between 1990s and 2010s around 0.01% (95% CI 0.01%-0.03%). Country and decade were
identified as the two major predictors of seroprevalence in BBs. Data on TCs was scarce.
Interpretation
Despite global progress in T. cruzi screening policies, both USPs and 100% coverage are yet to be
achieved. Seroprevalence in BBs have decreased in endemic countries, likely due to a combination of
vector control, increased USPs and voluntary donation, and improved diagnosis. To achieve the
proposed WHO goals by 2025 and 2030, USPs in TCs must become available in all endemic countries. In
BBs, USPs should be a priority in the Caribbean region as well as non-endemic countries where
migration from endemic countries is important.

Introduction
Chagas disease (CD), also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a disease caused by
Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasitic protozoan mainly transmitted by triatomine vectors (“kissing bugs”). It
can also be transmitted via food contamination, blood transfusion, organ transplantation, or
congenitally 1. During the chronic phase of CD, 20-30 % of those infected may develop life-threatening
complications, including cardiac and neurological disorders that can lead to death 2–4
Approximately 8 million people are infected with T. cruzi worldwide 3. The Pan-American Health
Organization (PAHO) estimates that currently about 6 million people are infected with T. cruzi in Latin
America, with 28,000 new cases and 12,000 deaths occurring per year5. Due to recent rising international
travelling and migration, the epidemiological profile of CD in non-endemic countries is changing. In
2015, it was estimated that there were 42,000 cases in Spain, 1,712 in France, and 1,324 in the United
Kingdom 6. Currently, the CDC indicates that there are >300,000 cases in the USA7.
In the 1990s, the governments of the six CD-endemic Southern Cone countries (Argentina, Bolivia,
Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay) where Chagas disease is endemic initiated the integrated efforts
to eliminate T. cruzi vectors via insecticide spraying and housing improvement (known as the Southern
Cone Initiative). As a result, vector infestation was significantly reduced in these countries 8,9. Following
the initial success of vector-control programmes, blood transfusion from infected untreated donors
emerged as the second most common transmission route 10–12. In response, governments mandated the
serological screening for T. cruzi of blood donations or donors after the Southern Cone Initiative and,
by 2005, twelve of the CD-endemic Latin American countries had achieved 100% screening coverage.
With the increasing cases of transfusion-transmitted infections, governments of non-endemic countries
have recognized the importance of implementing strategies for controlling the transmissions 13,14; the
UK, France, Spain, and the USA have initiated screening of blood banks (BBs) since the early 2000s 14.
Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) goals for CD include achieving complete
interruption of T. cruzi transmission in BBs and transplantation centres (TCs) by 2030 15. Despite the
availability of national guidelines for T. cruzi screening in BBs and TCs, it remains unknown whether
such guidelines have been implemented and (or) to which extent recommendations have been
followed, making it difficult to evaluate progress towards the WHO 2030 goals. Therefore, we conducted
a systematic review and meta-analysis of screening policies and seroprevalence data in BBs and TCs
globally to quantify and compare progress in the implementation of such policies.

Methods
Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
We conducted a systematic review on screening policies and T. cruzi seroprevalence data and
subsequent meta-analyses of the obtained data from in BBs and TCs, with no restrictions on language,
country, time, age or gender. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses) guidelines and checklist were used (appendix pp 2).

We systematically searched databases including Medline (a subset of PubMed), Web of
Knowledge, Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciencias da Saúde (LILACS), Google Scholar
and Excerpta Medica (EMBASE) databases. We included studies describing country’s implementation of
T. cruzi-screening strategies, presence of T. cruzi seroprevalence data, and any relevant model-derived
estimates of T. cruzi seroprevalence among blood donors, organ donors and recipients. Inclusion and
exclusion criteria are available in appendix pp 2. Our search algorithm combined the search terms: 1)
blood bank, 2) blood bank screening 3) blood donor 4) transfusion, 5) transplant, 6) organ
transplantation, 7) Chagas disease, 8) Trypanosoma cruzi (appendix pp 4-5).
We imported the selected citations into the online software Covidence 16. All titles and abstracts
were reviewed by two independent investigators and conflicts were resolved by a third person.
Abstracts were screened in Spanish, Portuguese, English, and French. Full-text screening was also
conducted in the same manner.
Data extraction
Each paper selected for full-text screening was reviewed carefully and the relevant quantitative
and qualitative information was extracted regarding screening policy and seroprevalence. Extracted
data included the information on year of screening policy implementation, type of screening policy
(universal screening, selective screening, permanent deferral), country of policy implementation, and
any changes on the existing screening policies. For seroprevalence, relevant extracted data included
year of publication, year of study, country, city/region, CD endemicity status (endemic/non-endemic),
pre-test risk of infection, name of the BB/TC, case definition, pre-screening criteria, sampling method,
age range, diagnostic technique, number of conducted tests, and number of positives. When point
estimates were not provided in the papers, these were calculated using the extracted data. We classified
the screening policies into four categories: a) deferral (i.e. deferred from blood donation when person
may think was at risk), b) selective screening of at-risk populations, universal policy screening (USP)
and d) not clear (Table S3, appendix pp 6). USPS was classified according to achieved coverage.
Data quality assessment was conducted based on a checklist of criteria used by Ding et al 17. We
evaluated the research question, sampling method, study period, diagnostic method, and any potential
bias within the selected studies. For each study, the criteria were considered to allocate a score to
classify the data as of high, moderate, or low-quality (Table S4, appendix pp 8).
Data analysis
Data analysis consisted of three components: meta-analysis, publication bias assessment, and
meta-regression. Taking into account that each study may differ in geographic location, pre-test
infection risk, and CD endemicity, a random-effects model was used. We estimated the overall and
decade-specific seroprevalence. Differences in the seroprevalence between decades was considered
significant if test for group differences X2 had a p value < 0.05. We report I2 statistic as the proportion of
observed variance among the study results due to heterogeneity 18 and tau-squared (τ2) to indicate the
extent of between-study variance 18.
In addition to an overall meta-analysis, we also conducted meta-analyses by the WHO subregions for which we could find the data within selected papers (Europe, North America, Meso America,

Caribbean and South America), endemicity, and country. Within the meta-analyses by CD endemicity,
non-endemic countries include North American and European countries, whereas endemic countries
include Meso American and South American countries. Meta-analyses by country include the countries
with at least five reports on seroprevalence at blood banks. We conducted the statistical analyses of
collected data using R v.3.5.3 19.
Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger’s regression asymmetry test 20. We
also used a trim and fill technique to identify and correct the asymmetry in funnel plots by firstly
removing the smaller studies causing the funnel plot asymmetry, secondly estimating the true centre
of the funnel, and finally filling the missing studies around the centre to calculate the adjusted study
effects.
We conducted a meta-regression to identify the covariates that may influence the pooled
seroprevalence values and produce a model that best predicted the variability of effect sizes. We
selected the model that maximised maximum likelihood, minimised the Akaike Information Criterion
(IC), and explained the highest percentage of the variance of the dependent variable (R2 ).

Findings
The systematic literature search identified a total 2,830 studies, which were identified according
to the selection criteria. Ninety-nine studies were selected for data extraction, of which sixty-two
studies were based on seroprevalence data from BBs, nineteen studies from TCs, and seven studies
from reports on transfusion-transmitted infections. Eleven references were selected for review of
screening policies across countries (Figure 1). Further details on selected studies are available in
supplementary materials (Table S6, appendix pp 11). The references for all studies used in the analyses
are also listed in supplementary materials (appendix pp 19).
From the data-quality assessment, of 99 selected references, 1 showed low quality, 32 showed
moderate quality, and 63 showed high quality. See supplementary materials (Table S5, appendix pp 8)
for the full quality assessment. A summary of the total number of reports on seroprevalence and
individuals included per country according to WHO region, sub-region 21, and country, is presented in
Table 1.
Universal Screening Policies in Blood Banks and Transplantation Centres
From the selected eleven papers and reports which described the evolution of T. cruzi screening
policies, we found information for 50 countries out of which USPs has been implemented in 44. The
evolution T. cruzi USPs implementation over time shows a clear pattern of increase since 1990 to 2015
(Figure 2). However, out of 50 only 21 countries have achieved 100% coverage by 2015. Importantly, all
21 Chagas disease endemic countries are in advanced states of USPs implementation. By 2015, 18 of
them have reached 100% coverage.
In North America, the USA initiated the USPs in 2007 21, reaching 100% of coverage in all BBs
by 2016 22. Canada began screening the at-risk donors in 2010, using the questionnaires assessing the
risk factors11.

Latin America was the first region to start USPs, of which all countries have initiated since the
1990s 11, but each country has reached 100% of coverage in different years 23–25. By the year 2015, we
observed the achievement of 100% coverage in universal screening in most of the Latin American
countries, except for Mexico and Peru.
In the Caribbean region, most countries have initiated USPs in the 2010s, but only five out of 24
countries reached 100% of coverage 25. By 2015, there is evidence of the achievement of 100% of
coverage in universal screening in Belize, Guyana, Suriname, Martinique, and Trinidad and Tobago.
There currently is no USPs in Europe, but some countries have implemented the selective
screening of at-risk donors in BBs using the risk factor questionnaires in the UK, since 1995; Spain, since
2005; France, since 2009, and Switzerland, since 2013. In Sweden, systematic screening of blood donors
has not been implemented; however, all donors who have lived in endemic countries for more than 5
years are permanently deferred from blood donations 11,14.
Italy, Spain, and the UK have created the national guidelines on controlling the CD transmissions
by organ transplantations via routine T. cruzi screening starting from the year 2012, 2004, and 2011,
respectively 14. Since 2002, organ procurement organizations in the USA have initiated partial coverage
of universal screening for all tissue donors26. See supplementary materials for the map (Figure S1,
appendix pp 19).
Seroprevalence in blood banks
We were only able to find seroprevalence data on European, North American, and Latin American
and Caribbean regions. The overall meta-analysis, conducted with all studies, showed a decrease in
seroprevalence from 2.42% (95% CI 0.75%-7.53%) in the 1970s to 0.38% (95%CI 0.30%-0.49%) in the
2010s. During this period, differences between decades were statistically significant (p < 0.001). The
pooled seroprevalence over a five-decade period (from 1970s to 2010s) was 0.48% (95% CI 0.39%0.60%) (I2= 100%, τ2=3.05, p < 0.001) (Figure S2 appendix pp 20)
[ 3.20; 6.42]
In endemic countries there is a significant (p < 0.01). decrease in seroprevalence from 4.55%
(95% CI 3.20%-6.42%) in the 1980s to 0.49% (95% CI 0.40%-0.60%) in the 2010s (Figure 3A, and Figure
S3 appendix pp 20). By contrast, when analysing only non-endemic countries, including Canada,
France, Japan, Spain, Switzerland, and the USA, there is a non-significant decrease (p=0.33) in
seroprevalence from 0.04% (95% CI 0.01%-0.26%) in the 1990s to 0.01% (95% CI 0.02%-0.03%) in the
2010s (Figure 3B, Figure S4, appendix pp 21).

In the South America region, including Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador,
Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela, showed a statistically significant (p < 0.01) decrease in
seroprevalence from 4.00% (95% CI 3.95%-4.06%) in the 1970s to 0.50% (95% CI 0.38%-0.67%) in the
2010s (Figure 3C and Figure S5 appendix pp 21).

The Meso America region, included Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,
Nicaragua, and Panama, showed a statistically non-significant decrease in seroprevalence from 0.90 %
(95% CI 0.62%-1.29%) in the 1990s to 0.57% (95% CI 0.44%-0.73%) in the 2010s (Figure 3D and Figure S6
appendix pp 22).
In the Caribbean region, including Belize, Guyana, Bermuda, Guadeloupe and Martinique there
was only one report available in the 1970s and 10 reports for 2010s. The current seroprevalence for the
region was estimated at 0.01% (95% CI 0.004% - 0.12%) (I2 = 96% %, τ2 = 6.4, p = 0.04) (Figure S7
appendix pp 20).
The North America region, including Canada and the USA, showed a statistically significant (p
= 0.03) decrease in seroprevalence (of 50%) from 0.04% (95% CI 0.01%-0.26%) in the 1990s to 0.02%
(95% CI 0.01%-0.09%) in the 2010s (Figure 3E and Figure S8 appendix pp 23).
The Europe region, including France, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK, showed a similar
seroprevalence of 0.03% (95% CI 0.00%-0.37%) in the 2000s to 0.04% (95% CI 0.01%-0.12%) in the 2010s.
The pooled seroprevalence over a two-decade period (2000s and 2010s) was 0.03% (95% CI 0.01%0.16%) (I2 = 91%, τ2 = 3.03, p < 0.01) (Figure 3F and Figure S9 appendix pp 23).
With the 15 countries from where at least five reports were available, we conducted individual
country meta-analysis. Among them, in endemic regions, the highest contemporary (2010s) seroprevalence was found in Argentina 2.77% (2.34%-3.26%), followed by Bolivia at 2.33 % (1.92%-2.83%)
and El Salvador at 2.08 % (1.66-2.68). Whereas in non-endemic countries, estimates where only
possible in one country, the US with seroprevalence at 0.01% (0.01%-0.02%). Individual country
results are presented in Table 3.
Analysis of publication bias indicated that such bias has a stronger influence when the time
component is not considered and is less evident when the analysis is separate into decades (Table 3).
See supplementary materials (Figure S10 appendix pp 24) for funnel plots.
From five meta-regression models the combination of variables ‘decade’ and ‘country’ best predicted
the pooled T. cruzi seroprevalence (Table S7 and S8 appendix pp17).

Discussion
With the aim to evaluate the degree of achievement of CD screening goals in BBs and TCs, our
study has identified and extracted the relevant data to provide overall trends in T. cruzi seroprevalence
and implementation of screening policies in both endemic and non-endemic countries over the past
five decades. Despite the evident progress in the number of countries that have initiated or
consolidated USPs, the essential implementations are yet to achieve their universal coverage. Out of 50
countries analysed, USPs have been implemented in 44 countries but only 21 have achieved 100%
coverage.
Our study indicates a gradual and positive trend towards implementation of screening with
increasing coverage across decades in North American and Latin American countries, as well as a few a

few Caribbean and European countries. By 2015, most Latin American countries and the USA reached
100% coverage of universal BB screening for T. cruzi whereas the remaining countries established other
screening or control measures. Among the policies regarding the control of transmissions by organ
transplantations, we are only able to report the implementation of national guidelines in Italy, Spain,
and the UK. However, due to paucity of data it is not possible to learn to which extent these
recommendations are being followed by the health authorities of these countries.
From the overall meta-analysis, we estimated a global pooled seroprevalence of 0.48% (95% CI
0.39%-0.60%), but with markedly significant differences between the geographical regions and over five
decades studied. Testing for differences between decades within the overall meta-analysis indicated a
statistically significant difference in seroprevalence (p < 0.001). Such observation was consistent
throughout the majority of country-level meta-analyses, which showed a general decline in the T. cruzi
seroprevalence from the 1970s to 2010s. In particular, dramatic changes between and after the year
2000 imply possibly the impact of the interventions implemented by the Southern Cone Initiatives—we
detected the greatest difference in the meta-analysis on endemic countries, where the T. cruzi pooled
seroprevalence decreased from 4.52% (95% CI 2.96%-6.85%) in the 1980s to 0.70% (95% CI 0.59%0.84%) in the 2010s.
Nevertheless, we hypothesise four possibilities to explain the estimated changes in the
seroprevalence rates, the high heterogeneity and the significant decade effects. Firstly, the late 20th and
early 21st centuries were marked by the regional initiatives to prevent CD transmission in Latin America,
consisting in vector control programmes that markedly reduced domestic infestation indices, followed
by legislation on T. cruzi universal screening in BBs, both impacting T. cruzi transmission8,9. Second,
screening policies in blood banks may have first started in areas with the highest prevalence and as
universal coverage is achieved, also lower endemic areas become included and so diluting the
seroprevalence. Third, an increase in a number of voluntary non-remunerated blood donors (VNRBDs)
could have contributed to improving blood safety. Since 2012, PAHO have reported an increase in the
proportion of blood donations from voluntary and also repetitive donors in the Americas and also
repetitive donation 23–25. Thus, low pooled seroprevalence estimates in the decades 2000s and 2010s
across countries may also be due to the promotion of blood donations from the VNRBDs. Lastly,
combinations of serological assays to test IgG against T. cruzi over the last five decades had varying
degrees of sensitivity and specificity, with a trend for their diagnostic performance to improve over
time. For example, the low specificity from T. cruzi crude antigens may have contributed to a higher
rate of false positivity in CD diagnosis 27–29. Starting from the late 1980s, however, the quality control
programmes for laboratory performances of serological tests encouraged the use of purified and
recombinant antigens 29,30. Variations in types and quality of diagnostic assays and their qualities in
different periods may, therefore, may also explain some of the reductions in the pooled seroprevalence
estimates over time.
The change in seroprevalence in endemic countries shows also a very important step forward
in screening policies in endemic countries where the seroprevalence shows an evident decrease and so
a separation from the true population seroprevalence. This means the policies for voluntary and
repetitive donations are having an effect on the risk of Chagas transmission via donations. Interestingly,
this also means we cannot estimate Chagas population prevalence from screening in BBs, as we would
be underestimating the true prevalence. Nevertheless, we could say that the true Chagas
seroprevalence in these countries is at least as low as estimated in blood banks.

Although the study identified nearly a hundred articles for data extraction, there still remain the
limitations on data availability, and particularly for TCs. Additionally, other variables, such as age,
gender, types of blood donor, or sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic assays were not investigated
due to this type of information missing in some of the studies. Notwithstanding these limitations, our
study has several strengths. To our knowledge this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis
conducted to answer the question on the progress of blood bank screening policies for Chagas disease
worldwide. We also made efforts to minimize study biases with the meta-analyses by different
variables, producing the results at both regional and national levels that were consistent with the
chosen meta-regression model.
This study provides an in-depth view of the global status of screening policies as well as of T. cruzi
seroprevalence in relation to BBs. Despite global progress in T. cruzi screening policies, both USPs and
100% coverage are yet to be achieved. Seroprevalence in BBs have decreased in endemic countries,
likely due to a combination of vector control, increased USPs and voluntary donation, and improved
diagnostic tests. To achieve the proposed WHO goals by 2025, USPs in TCs must become available in all
endemic and non-endemic countries where migration from endemic countries is important.
