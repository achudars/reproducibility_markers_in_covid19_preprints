Abstract

21

The relationship between antibiotic stewardship and population levels of antibiotic resistance

22

remains unclear. In order to better understand shifts in selective pressure due to stewardship, we

23

use publicly available data to estimate the effect of changes in prescribing on exposures to

24

frequently used antibiotics experienced by potentially pathogenic bacteria that are

25

asymptomatically colonizing the microbiome. We quantify this impact under four hypothetical

26

stewardship strategies. In one scenario, we estimate that elimination of all unnecessary outpatient

27

antibiotic use could avert 6 to 48% (IQR: 17 to 31%) of exposures across pairwise combinations

28

of sixteen common antibiotics and nine bacterial pathogens. All scenarios demonstrate that

29

stewardship interventions, facilitated by changes in clinician behavior and improved diagnostics,

30

have the opportunity to broadly reduce antibiotic exposures across a range of potential

31

pathogens. Concurrent approaches, such as vaccines aiming to reduce infection incidence, are

32

needed to further decrease exposures occurring in “necessary” contexts.

Introduction

35

Antibiotic consumption is a known driver of antibiotic resistance. In developed nations, over

36

80% of antibiotic consumption for human health occurs in the outpatient setting (European

37

Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2018; Public Health Agency of Canada, 2018; Public

38

Health England, 2017; Swedres-Svarm, 2017), and US-based studies conducted across different

39

subpopulations have estimated that 23-40% of outpatient prescriptions may be inappropriate

40

(Chua, Fischer, & Linder, 2019; Fleming-Dutra et al., 2016; Olesen, Barnett, MacFadden,

41

Lipsitch, & Grad, 2018). Inappropriate antibiotic use leads to increased risk of adverse events

42

(Linder, 2008; Shehab, Patel, Srinivasan, & Budnitz, 2008), disruption of colonization resistance

43

and other benefits of the microbial flora (Buffie & Pamer, 2013; Khosravi & Mazmanian, 2013),

44

and bystander selection for antibiotic resistance, with little to no health gains for the patient.

45

Recent work on bystander selection estimates that, for 8 of 9 potential pathogens of interest, over

46

80% of their exposures to commonly used antibiotic classes in the outpatient setting occur when

47

the organisms are asymptomatically colonizing the microbiome, not causing disease (Tedijanto,

48

Olesen, Grad, & Lipsitch, 2018). A corollary of extensive bystander selection is that reductions

49

in use will prevent antibiotic exposures for species throughout the microbiome.

50
51

We use publicly available data to quantify potentially avertable exposures of bacterial species to

52

commonly used antibiotics under hypothetical changes in prescribing practice. The set of

53

scenarios included here are intended as thought experiments to explore the upper bounds of

54

avertable antibiotic exposures. Reductions in antibiotic consumption have historically had

55

variable impacts on resistance levels, likely dependent on setting, baseline consumption and

56

resistance patterns, and fitness costs (Andersson & Hughes, 2010; Lipsitch, 2001). In addition,

57

treatment strategies are primarily guided by randomized controlled trials assessing immediate

58

clinical outcomes, with less careful consideration given to the microbiome-wide effect of such

59

decisions. We apply analytical methods to parse out species-level effects of changes in

60

prescribing practice in order to better understand the potential impact of antibiotic stewardship.

61
62

Methods

63

Scenarios of interest

64

This analysis includes sixteen antibiotics that are frequently prescribed in the outpatient setting

65

and nine potentially pathogenic bacterial species that are commonly carried in the normal human

66

microbiome. For each antibiotic-species pair, we estimate the proportion of antibiotic exposures

67

experienced by that species that could be averted under four hypothetical scenarios. The

68

scenarios range from broad elimination of unnecessary prescribing to focused modifications of

69

antibiotic use for specific indications as follows:

70

1) Eliminate unnecessary antibiotic use across all outpatient conditions.

71

2) Eliminate all antibiotic use for outpatient respiratory conditions for which antibiotics are

72

not indicated.

73

3) Eliminate all antibiotic use for acute sinusitis.

74

4) Prescribe nitrofurantoin for all cases of cystitis in women.

75

Based on previously published work, we consider viral upper respiratory tract infection,

76

influenza, non-suppurative otitis media, viral pneumonia, bronchitis, and allergy and asthma to

77

be outpatient respiratory conditions for which antibiotics are not indicated (Fleming-Dutra et al.,

78

2016). Due to the self-limiting nature and infrequent bacterial etiology of acute sinusitis, there is

79

weak evidence to support antibiotic treatment (Burgstaller, Steurer, Holzmann, Geiges, & Soyka,

80

2016; Rosenfeld et al., 2015). However, antibiotics continue to be prescribed at over 80% of US

81

outpatient visits with a primary diagnosis of acute sinusitis (Smith et al., 2013). In contrast,

82

antibiotics are always recommended for urinary tract infections (UTIs). Despite being

83

recommended as a second-line therapy for cystitis due to concerns about resistance,

84

fluoroquinolones are the most common treatment, prescribed at 40% of outpatient visits for

85

uncomplicated UTI (Kabbani et al., 2018). We explore the hypothetical scenario of treating all

86

cases of cystitis in women with nitrofurantoin, a recommended first-line therapy with good

87

potency against common uropathogens, low levels of resistance, and decreased risk of collateral

88

damage to the intestinal microbiome due to its propensity to concentrate in the bladder (Gupta et

89

al., 2011; Gupta, Scholes, & Stamm, 1999; Stewardson et al., 2015).

90
91

Data sources and methodology

92

Extending our recent work on bystander selection (Tedijanto et al., 2018), we used the 2015

93

National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care

94

Survey (NAMCS/NHAMCS), the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) (Huttenhower et al., 2012;

95

The Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012), and assorted carriage and etiology studies

96

to estimate national outpatient antibiotic exposures by drug, species, and condition.

97

NAMCS/NHAMCS are annual cross-sectional surveys designed to sample outpatient visits in

98

the United States, and up to five diagnoses and thirty medications may be associated with each

99

visit. We used methodology developed by Fleming-Dutra and colleagues (Fleming-Dutra et al.,

100

2016), and applied in other studies (Olesen et al., 2018), to group diagnosis codes into conditions

101

and link antibiotic prescriptions with the most likely indication. For this analysis, visits with a

102

diagnosis of acute cystitis (ICD-9-CM: 595.0), unspecified cystitis (595.9) or unspecified UTI

103

(599.0), without a concurrent diagnosis of pyelonephritis (590.1, 590.8), renal abscess (590.2), or

104

kidney infection (590.9), were considered to be associated with cystitis. In this analysis, we

105

maintain the assumption that one antibiotic prescription is equivalent to one exposure; antibiotic

106

exposures experienced by a given species and associated with a given condition are roughly

107

estimated as the product of antibiotic prescriptions for that condition and species carriage

108

prevalence, which is dependent on disease etiology (target exposures) and asymptomatic carriage

109

prevalence (bystander exposures) (details in Appendix Table 1). For diagnoses where etiology

110

was not readily available, we assumed that none of our species of interest were causative agents.

111

These assumptions have been enumerated in detail in prior work (Tedijanto et al., 2018).

112
113

We applied proportions of unnecessary antibiotic prescribing by condition and age group

114

estimated by Fleming-Dutra and colleagues based on expert opinion, clinical guidelines, and

115

regional variability in use (Fleming-Dutra et al., 2016). Since these estimates were reported for

116

oral antibiotic use in the outpatient setting, we excluded antibiotics that are typically

117

administered topically or parenterally. For relevant scenarios (1 and 2), we applied the

118

proportions of unnecessary use evenly across all antibiotic prescriptions.

119
120

The proportion of avertable antibiotic exposures for each species is defined by Equation 1. The

121

equation adopts previously described notation (Tedijanto et al., 2018) with modifications. A

122

listing of all variables and descriptions can be found in Appendix Table 1. Let a represent

123

antibiotic, s represent species, i represent ICD-9-CM diagnosis code, and g represent age group.

124

Prescriptions with i=0 were not associated with any ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes, and throughout

125

the analysis we have weighted outpatient visits to be nationally representative. Let Xas be the

number of avertable exposures by antibiotic and species, Tas be the total number of exposures by

127

antibiotic and species, daig be the number of prescriptions of antibiotic a associated with

128

diagnosis code i in age group g, psig be the carriage prevalence of species s among those with

129

diagnosis code i in age group g, and qaig be the proportion of avertable exposures by diagnosis

130

code and age group in the given scenario. For example, in the scenario assessing elimination of

131

all unnecessary antibiotic use, qaig is the proportion of avertable antibiotic use by diagnosis and

132

age group (Fleming-Dutra et al., 2016). Alternatively, in the scenario assessing elimination of

133

non-nitrofurantoin treatment for cystitis, qaig is 1 when a is not nitrofurantoin and i is a diagnosis

134

code associated with cystitis, and 0 elsewhere. Carriage prevalences (psig) are assumed to be

135

constant within three age groups (under 1 year, 1-5 years, over 5 years old) (Tedijanto et al.,

136

2018), while proportions of avertable antibiotic use (qaig) were reported for three different age

137

groups (0-19 years, 20-64 years, 65 years old and over) (Fleming-Dutra et al., 2016). G is the

138

smallest set of age groups that accounts for this granularity (under 1 year, 1-5 years, 6-19 years,

139

20-64 years, 65 years old and over).

142

In scenarios where unnecessary use is eliminated (1 and 2), we assume that only bystander

143

exposures are affected. Equivalently, this presumes that perfect discrimination between bacterial

144

and non-bacterial etiologies is possible. This results in a slight modification to Equation 1 -- psig

145

is changed to ps0g as all eliminated exposures would have occurred during asymptomatic

146

carriage. For cases where esig is 1, we assume zero avertable exposures. In addition, we make

147

slight modifications to qaig when we estimate the proportion of bacterial cases to be larger than

148

the proportion of necessary prescriptions (Appendix Table 2). As a sensitivity analysis, we

149

include the proportion of avertable exposures for each species-antibiotic pair under Scenario 1 if

150

antibiotic use was eliminated equally across both target and bystander exposures (Appendix

151

Figure 1). All analysis was conducted in R version 3.5.1.

152
153

Results

154

Results for all four scenarios are depicted in Figure 1. We estimate that elimination of

155

unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions across all outpatient conditions would prevent 6 to 48%

156

(IQR: 17 to 31%) of antibiotic-species exposures (Figure 1A). The smallest reduction is

157

associated with S. pyogenes exposures to cefdinir and the largest with H. influenzae and E. coli

158

exposures to azithromycin. If all unnecessary antibiotic use could be prevented, over 30% of

159

exposures to amoxicillin-clavulanate, penicillin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, and

160

doxycycline across most potential pathogens of interest could be averted. As expected, the

161

proportion of avertable exposures when all unnecessary outpatient use is eliminated is positively

162

correlated with previously reported estimates of bystander selection (Appendix Figure 2)

163

(Tedijanto et al., 2018).

164
165

Across all scenarios, the proportion of avertable exposures appears to be primarily driven by the

166

drug considered. For example, in both scenarios assessing broad elimination of unnecessary

167

antibiotic use, every species can expect azithromycin exposures to decrease to the greatest extent

168

as it is the most commonly used antibiotic for respiratory conditions for which antibiotics are not

169

indicated (Figure 1B). The estimated reductions in azithromycin across species range from 37 to

170

48% when all outpatient conditions are considered and from 24 to 32% when limited to the

171

subset of respiratory conditions for which antibiotics are not indicated. High estimates of

172

avertable exposures for a particular antibiotic reflect both frequent use for the impacted

173

syndrome(s) and concentrated use for those conditions relative to other indications. Consider the

174

indication-specific scenarios: ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim are the most

175

frequently prescribed antibiotics for cystitis other than nitrofurantoin and have relatively large

176

estimates of avertable exposures (23 to 44% and 7 to 26%, respectively). While clarithromycin is

177

only the eighth-most-prescribed antibiotic for acute sinusitis among the included antibiotics, its

178

concentrated use for acute sinusitis compared to other indications results in relatively large

179

expected reductions in exposure (up to 9% for P. aeruginosa and S. pyogenes) compared to other

drugs.

196

exposures. Species that are common causes of the affected condition(s) naturally have larger

197

predicted reductions in exposure. For example, an estimated 33%, 36%, and 44% of

198

ciprofloxacin exposures to E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa, respectively, could be

199

averted under the cystitis scenario, compared to 23 to 27% across all other organisms. Although

200

E. coli is the most common cause of UTIs, its estimated exposure reduction in this scenario is

201

lower than that of P. aeruginosa, likely due to the larger number of bystander exposures incurred

202

by E. coli during asymptomatic carriage. Infrequent carriage prevalence in the normal

203

microbiome is also generally associated with lower proportions of avertable exposures across all

204

antibiotics (e.g. S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, M. catarrhalis).

Discussion

207

We quantify the species-level impact of changes in antibiotic consumption as the proportion of

208

antibiotic exposures experienced by common bacterial pathogens that could be averted under

209

four hypothetical scenarios. In the scenario where unnecessary antibiotic use for all outpatient

210

conditions is eliminated, we find that up to 48% of exposures (of H. influenzae and E. coli to

211

azithromycin) could be avoided. In addition, impact of the intervention across antibiotics and

212

species is widespread, with half of antibiotic-species pairs expected to experience a reduction in

213

exposures of over one fifth (22%). For conditions which require antibiotic treatment, such as

214

UTIs, switching to antibiotics with decreased collateral damage to the microbiome, such as

215

nitrofurantoin, may be an effective strategy for reducing antibiotic exposures across species.

216
217

In three out of four situations we assess, antibiotics are considered entirely unnecessary for some

218

or all cases. This is a strong assumption in the case of acute sinusitis, as a small number of cases

219

are truly bacterial and antibiotics are indicated for patients with persistent, severe or worsening

220

symptoms (Rosenfeld et al., 2015). These scenarios are explored in sensitivity analyses

221

(Appendix Figure 3). In the future, this method may also be extended to measure net changes in

222

exposures resulting from more nuanced scenarios where one antibiotic is substituted for another.

223

We did not assess such changes for nitrofurantoin, as its effects on the microbiome outside of the

224

bladder are thought to be minimal (Stewardson et al., 2015). The reductions in use presented here

225

may be practically infeasible due to challenges including similar clinical presentation of viral and

226

bacterial infections, individual considerations such as allergies (Sakoulas, Geriak, & Nizet, 2018)

227

or heightened risk of adverse events, misdiagnosis (Filice et al., 2015; Tomas, Getman, Donskey,

228

& Hecker, 2015), and patient-driven demand (Vanden Eng et al., 2003). Even if elimination of

229

unnecessary use were fully realized, our results imply that the majority of species’ antibiotic

230

exposures occur in the context of “necessary” antibiotic use. These findings underscore the

231

importance of considering bystander effects and the need for a multi-pronged approach to

232

programs aimed at controlling antibiotic resistance. Rapid diagnostics, diagnostics that

233

accurately discriminate between bacterial and non-bacterial causes, patient education, and

234

improved decision-making tools and other interventions to motivate changes in clinician

235

behavior can enhance responsible antibiotic consumption; these should be implemented

236

simultaneously with prevention measures such as infection control, access to clean water and

237

sanitation, safe sex interventions, and vaccination, which aim to reduce infection incidence and

238

thus any antibiotic use.

239
240

At the time of this analysis, NHAMCS data from hospital outpatient departments was not yet

241

available for years after 2011. In the 2010-2011 NAMCS/NHAMCS data, visits to hospital

242

outpatient departments accounted for 36% of included sampled visits, but just 9% of all

243

antibiotic mentions. The proportions of avertable exposures including and excluding these visits

244

for 2010-2011 were similar (Appendix Figure 4); thus, we assumed that antibiotic use and

245

diagnoses in the existing 2015 data without hospital outpatient department visits was

246

representative. Additional limitations of the included datasets and method for estimating

247

antibiotic exposures have been previously enumerated (Tedijanto et al., 2018). Notably, the

248

NAMCS/NHAMCS does not provide information to link medications with diagnoses, so we

249

adopted a published tiered system to pair antibiotic use at each visit with the most likely

250

indication (Fleming-Dutra et al., 2016). For visits with multiple diagnoses, all antibiotic use was

251

attributed to the single most-likely indication. This method tends to overestimate antibiotic use

252

for conditions for which antibiotics are almost always indicated, which may lead to clinically

253

unusual diagnosis-treatment linkages. In the same way, antibiotic prescriptions are

254

underestimated for diagnoses for which antibiotic use is not indicated, potentially leading to

255

downward bias in avertable exposures for these conditions. Additionally, NAMCS/NHAMCS

256

antibiotic use data does not include prescription details such as duration or dose. However, the

257

correlation between these factors and selection for resistance requires further study; prescriptions

258

may be a sufficient measure (Bruyndonckx et al., 2014; Lipsitch, 2001).

260

At the time of this analysis, Fleming-Dutra et al. remained the most up-to-date source of

261

unnecessary antibiotic prescribing by condition. Recent work with slightly different methods

262

found a lower proportion of inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions overall (23.2% compared to

263

30%) but did not report their estimates by condition (Chua et al., 2019). Although comparable

264

estimates of unnecessary prescribing over time are unavailable, multiple studies have shown that

265

declines in antibiotic use from approximately 2011 to 2016 in the United States have been

266

primarily due to pediatric prescribing, implying that, at least for adults, levels of unnecessary

267

prescribing likely remained similar (Durkin et al., 2018; King, Bartoces, Fleming-Dutra, Roberts,

268

& Hicks, 2019; Klevens et al., 2019; Olesen et al., 2018). Finally, we assume that the proportion

269

of unnecessary use is constant across antibiotics used for the same condition as it is difficult to

270

identify specific antibiotic prescriptions that were unwarranted without detailed chart review. A

271

study among outpatients in the Veterans Affairs medical system found that among prescriptions

272

for community-acquired pneumonia, sinusitis, and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, the

273

highest proportion of macrolide use was inappropriate (27%), followed by penicillins (22%) and

quinolones (12%) (Tobia, Aspinall, Good, Fine, & Hanlon, 2008). Similar studies are needed to

275

understand which antibiotics are frequently used inappropriately for other indications and

276

settings.

277
278

Reductions in antibiotic consumption are necessary to preserve the potency of these drugs.

279

Quantifying changes in species-level exposures due to stewardship programs is one more step

280

towards understanding how changes in antibiotic use correspond to antibiotic resistance at the

281

population level. Further research, integrating knowledge from clinical, ecological, and

282

evolutionary spheres, is needed to elucidate this relationship (MacLean & San Millan, 2019).

283

The methods presented here may be easily extended to incorporate other data sources, such as

284

claims, or to assess more specific stewardship programs. We show that while improved

285

prescribing practices have the potential to prevent antibiotic exposures experienced by bacterial

286

species throughout the microbiome, complementary efforts to facilitate appropriate antibiotic

287

consumption and decrease overall infection incidence are required to substantially avert

288

exposures.

Sinusitis
While acute sinusitis is rarely bacterial,
bacteria are believed to play a much
more prominent role in the etiology of
chronic sinusitis (Brook, 2016). Thus,
we assume that antibiotic use would only
be eliminated from acute sinusitis and
maintain the overall estimate of
unnecessary use reported by FlemingDutra et al. (Fleming-Dutra et al., 2016)
when possible.

A. Use estimates of bacterial etiology to approximate appropriate antibiotic use for acute
sinusitis. The following upper bound estimates for the proportion of acute sinusitis cases with
bacterial etiology were used: 2% for adults and 13% for children (applied to 0-19 year old age
group) (Sande & Gwaltney, 2004; Snow, Mottur-Pilson, Hickner, & for the American College of
Physicians–American Society of Internal Medicine*, 2001; Wald, Guerra, & Byers, 1991).

B. Use estimates of bacterial etiology among those presenting to primary care clinics.
Patients visiting the clinic are likely to have more persistent, severe, or worsening symptoms,
which may be indications of bacterial etiology. Studies have estimated that approximately 38%
of adults and 17% of children (upper bounds) visiting primary care for symptoms of acute upper
respiratory tract infection have bacterial rhinosinusitis (Aitken & Taylor, 1998; Benninger,
Holzer, & Lau, 2000; Williams, Simel, Roberts, & Samsa, 1992).
