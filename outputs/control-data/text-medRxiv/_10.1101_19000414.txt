The effectiveness of digital technology interventions to reduce
loneliness in adult people: A protocol for a systematic review and
meta-analysis
ABSTRACT
Introduction
Loneliness is an emerging public health problem, which is associated with social, emotional, mental
and physical health issues. The application of digital technology (DT) interventions to reduce
loneliness has increased in recent years. The effectiveness of DT interventions needs to be assessed
systematically.
Methods and analysis
Aim: To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of digital technology
interventions to reduce loneliness among adult people.
Design: systematic review and meta-analysis.
Data sources: Five leading online bibliographic databases: PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE,
and Web of Science.
Publication period: 1 January 2010 to 30 April 2019.
Inclusion criteria: Primary studies involving the application of digital technology interventions to
reduce loneliness, involving adult participants (aged 18 years and more) and published in the English
language.
Search strategy: Literature searches using a priory list of keywords, involvement of two independent
researchers in article screening, short listing and data extraction using a predefined template based on
the population, intervention(s), comparator(s) and outcome(s) (PICO) framework.
Synthesis and meta-analysis: A narrative summary of the characteristics of included studies,
findings by the type of DT intervention, and the age, gender and ethnicity of participants. A metaanalysis by the type of DT intervention and determination of effect sizes.
Quality of evidence and bias: Quality of evidence assessed the RoB 2.0 (revised tool for Risk of
Bias in randomized trials) and ROBINS-I (Risk Of Bias in Non-randomized Studies - of
Interventions) tools for randomized control trials and non-randomized studies respectively.
Heterogeneity between studies determined by the I2 and Cochran’s Q statistics and publication bias
checked with funnel plots and the Egger’s test.
Patients and public involvement: None
Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval was not required for writing this protocol. The findings
will be disseminated through the publication of research articles and conference presentations.

Article Summary
Strengths and limitations of this study
• The main strength of this study includes a systematic assessment of evidence on the effectiveness
of digital technology interventions to reduce loneliness, which is imperative from the health and
social care and public health perspectives.
• Another strength of the study is the involvement of two independent researchers (and a third
researcher as an arbitrator) involved in the identification, screening, inclusion and extraction of on
a predefined template using the PICO framework.
• Limitations may include missing identification of additional relevant studies due to the application
of selection filters such as the publication years and English as the publication language.

INTRODUCTION
Definitions
Loneliness is defined as a feeling of distress which develops in an individual when the social
relationship is perceived as less satisfying than the desired level.[1] Loneliness refers to a gap between
the desired and the actual social relationships of an individual.[2] Loneliness and social isolation are
often reported together in the literature; however, there is a difference between these two terms.
Loneliness is a subjective feeling while social isolation is an objective feeling and the former arises
because of the perceived gap between the actual and the desired social relationships while the latter
develops due to the absence of social contact with the society, individuals,[2] family and friends.[3]
Nonetheless, loneliness and social isolation are different from each other[3] with distinct pathways to
adverse health effects.[4,5] Tackling both loneliness and social isolation is important because they are
associated with adverse health effects.[3]

Burden of loneliness
Loneliness is increasing, especially in the developed countries[6] such as Australia,[7] Japan,[8] the
UK[9] and the US.[10] Loneliness is an epidemic[5] and a rising public health problem[11] because it
leads to social, mental and health problems.[12–14]
Loneliness and demographic factors
Loneliness can affect individuals of any age and members of any community.[2] It is prevalent in
young children and adolescents[15] who are more susceptible to loneliness as they go through social
and personal transformations.[16] In children and adolescents, loneliness is associated with chronic
physical conditions.[17] In older adults, loneliness is statistically significantly associated with female
gender, older age, poor income, lower educational level, living alone, low quality of social
relationships, poor self-reported health, poor functional status, marital status as unmarried[18]
including people who have never been married, are widowed or divorced.[19] In older people,
loneliness is common because they are more vulnerable because of age-related changes and losses.[20]

Loneliness and physical and mental health
Loneliness is associated with health and mental health risks.[20] Loneliness is also positively
associated with chronic conditions such as cancer[19] and cardiovascular disease[21] and it has a
negative influence on the quality of life, health and survival.[22] In old age, loneliness is associated
with reduced quality of life, poor health, maladaptive behaviour, and depressed mood[23] as well as
increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.[24]
Loneliness is associated with mental health such as depression, low self-esteem, anxiety, perceived
stress[16,25], psychosis,[26] shame and fear,[18] incident dementia,[27] sleep disorders such as severe
insomnia[28] and suicidal ideation in older adults.[29]
Thus, loneliness increases risks not only to the physical health[5,30] and mental health[12–14] but also
increases risk of early/premature mortality and all-cause mortality[5] especially in older men and
women.[31]
Loneliness and social and environmental factors
Loneliness is also associated with social and environmental factors such as boredom and inactivity,
the role of the recent losses of family and friends, inaccessible housing, inadequate resources for
socialising, unsafe neighbourhoods, migration patterns and environmental barriers.[18] In addition,
loneliness has a positive association with lack of psychological or social support,[19] low economic
level and living arrangements.[32]
More importantly, not only adults at the risk of loneliness are increasing but at the same time costs
associated with loneliness are also increasing.[33] It is therefore imperative to tackle this double edge
sword like situation created by loneliness through a range of interventions and strategies.

Interventions to tackle loneliness
Tackling loneliness requires improvement of social skills, increase in social support, enhancement of
social contact opportunities and tackling the maladaptive social cognition.[33] Intervention applied to
reduce loneliness could be broadly divided into two categories i.e. social interventions and
technological interventions.
Social interventions applied to reduce loneliness include befriending, residential and school-based
camps, reminiscence therapy, animal interventions, gardening, physical activity, and technology of
many kinds.[34] In addition, interventions focusing on social network maintenance and enhancement
have also been applied and found useful to combat loneliness.[20] Social interventions could also be
combined with the application of the technology such as online peer-to-peer interactions and support
groups through social media platforms to alleviate loneliness especially in persons with psychotic
disorders.[35] However, loneliness in older people can create serious problems that could not be
alleviated with the social support only[32] but it requires other types of interventions such as
technological interventions (e.g. digital applications (apps), online social networks and social robots),
which could enhance perceived emotional support and social interaction and thereby help in
promoting health in older adults.[36]
Digital technology interventions
The term ‘digital technology’ (DT) refers to the technology, equipment and applications that process
information in the form of numeric codes, usually a binary code, which is processed and used by
many devices such as computers, smartphones and robots.[37] Research in DT has become imperative

for various reasons such as rapid development in DTs, social change and ubiquity of computer
technologies, which are an integral part of the daily life of many people.[38] There are many kinds of
technology interventions that could be applied to reduce loneliness.[34]
We therefore focus on DT interventions to reduce loneliness. We will assess any intervention that
involves the application of DT to reduce and alleviate loneliness in the adult population.

Previous systematic reviews on technological interventions for loneliness
There are some systematic reviews on technological interventions for tackling loneliness. For
example, Pearce et al. (2012) undertook a systematic review on the availability and use of robotics by
older people and reported that robotic technologies could support older people and those with
disabilities in independent living; however, they suggested that there was a need for further research
to achieve the full potential of robotic technologies on social connectedness.[39] In addition, a metaanalysis on the effectiveness of computer and Internet training interventions intended to reduce
loneliness and depression in older adults by Choi et al. (2012) reported that computer and Internet
programs were effective in managing loneliness among older adults.[40]
Morris et al. (2013) conducted a systematic review of literature on the effectiveness of smart-home
technologies i.e. passive sensors, monitoring devices, robotics and environmental control systems for
promoting independence, health, well-being and quality of life, in older adults and found only one
study on the effectiveness of smart-home technologies and they suggested further research in this
domain.[41] A literature review of Hagan et al. (2014) investigated the effectiveness of social
therapeutic interventions to reduce loneliness in older people and included three studies on new
technologies and one on a group work intervention and identified significant reductions in
loneliness.[42] Miler et al. (2014) report a systematic review on the effectiveness of virtual reality and
gaming system on enabling physical activity in older peoples living at home and reported a high risk
of bias and weakness in the studies included in their review.[43]
In addition, a systematic review by Morris et al. (2014) evaluated the effectiveness of smart
technologies such as tailored internet programs to improve or maintain the social connectedness of
older people living at home and found that digital/smart technological interventions have positive
outcomes compared to traditional social care interventions.[44] In addition, Morris et al. focused on the
effects of smart technologies, which they reported as computers and the internet, on improving or
maintaining social connectedness in older people living in homes and reported that these technologies
improved social connectedness in these people.[44]

Rational
Technology can provide opportunities for social connectedness and thus help in reducing loneliness in
older adults; however, studies involving technological interventions to alleviate loneliness in frail and
institutionalized older adults are limited. [45]
For example, a systematic review of Pearce et al. (2012) focused only on robotic technologies and
their effectiveness in independent living by older people and suggested that the effect of robotics on
older peoples’ safety and social connectedness needs further research.[39] These findings suggest that
assessment of the effect of robotic technologies on loneliness needs to be undertaken.
In addition, a systematic review by Morris et al. (2013) involved assessment of the effectiveness of
smart-home technologies: passive sensors, monitoring devices, robotics and environmental control
systems for promoting independence, health, well-being and quality of life in older adults; however,

this study was limited to finding only one study on the effectiveness of smart-home technologies and
their focus was not on loneliness but on independent living in older people.[41]
Another systematic review by Morris et al. (2014) on smart technologies for improving or maintaining
social connectedness has limitations such as a narrow definition of smart technologies, which they
searched as ‘computers’ and the ‘internet’ and combined with assistive technologies. [44] The other
weakness in the study by Morris et al.[44] was their focus on social connectedness and older people
living in homes, and they also searched articles published between January 2010 and January 2013. In
addition, Morris et al. suggested a need for further research regarding smart technologies for reducing
loneliness in older adults.[44]
We anticipate the publication of new research studies from 2013 to present and a need to assess the
latest research involving digital technologies to reduce loneliness in older people. This is imperative
because the technology evolves very rapidly and new technologies (e.g. smart speakers, new sensors,
new robot versions, etc.) are being developed and becoming available and adopted very rapidly
popular and we need to assess their potential impact on adult people with loneliness.
In addition, evidence of technology-assisted interventions to reduce loneliness and their effects on the
social health and well-being of older people is limited.[23] Moreover, there could be the latest research
interventions involving newer digital technologies to reduce loneliness in older people that need to be
assessed.[42] It is also imperative to identify technological interventions that are effective in reducing
loneliness[23] and how technological innovations can be promoted, marketed and implemented to
benefit older people with loneliness.[44]

As a result of our preliminary search query, we captured 100 articles, which were reviewed
independently by two reviewers (SGSS and DN), who screened titles of all these articles and
recommended relevant articles to be included in the second stage of screening i.e. reading the
abstracts.
List of keywords
We noted subject terms reported in all articles that the two reviewers recommended for the second
stage. We reviewed these keywords and prepared a refined list of keywords. We noted that there were
very few keywords about various types of digital tools and technologies that we thought could be
relevant for identifying digital interventions for addressing the issue of loneliness. Therefore, we
divided keywords into two categories, i.e. conditions/issues and intervention / technology (Table 2). A
full list of keywords is shown in Table 2 and we will use these keywords for our full literature
searches and identifying relevant articles. We will search for these keywords in the titles, abstracts
and author keywords fields in the selected databases.

Running of literature searches
Systematic literature searches will be undertaken in the selected five online bibliographic databases
using the pre-identified list of keywords.
The literature will be searched using the keywords that will be searched in only the ‘title’ and
‘abstract’ searched fields in the selected bibliographic databases. The keywords will be used firstly in
the ‘subject headings’ such as Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) major terms in the PubMed or
equivalent in other databases.
The searches will be filtered by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We will identify
literature using the keywords and applying the Boolean operators, i.e. ‘OR’, ‘AND’ and ‘NOT’ whilst
searching for literature in different selected electronic/online bibliographic databases, as reported in
the next section.
In addition to searching through selected online bibliographic databases, we will search for relevant
articles through searching references’ lists of all selected articles.
We will seek support from the Bodleian library staff for running of literature searches.
Management of study records/references
We will keep a record of amendments in the protocol, if any, using an Excel spreadsheet. All records
found in searches through the selected databases will be directly downloaded and exported to the
RefWorks software, which is a web-based bibliography and database manager.[51]
We will have a quick look at all articles to check whether any information is missing ensuring
completeness of bibliographic details. Also, we will note the total number of articles downloaded.
Thereafter, we will identify and remove duplicate articles using the RefWorks software as well as
manually. We will note the total number of duplicate articles and all duplicate articles will be deleted
and the total number of articles remaining will be noted again.
Thereafter, we will create a list of all unique articles in an Excel spreadsheet to facilitate articles
screening and shortlisting independently by two researchers (SGSS and DN). In addition, we will use
an Excel spreadsheet for extracting data from shortlisted articles on a predefined template (Table 3).
For citing articles in our papers and publications, we will use the Zotero software, which is an opensource and free research tool for references management and citations.[52]
We will use the PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 1 for the identification, screening, eligibility and
inclusion of relevant studies and data extraction,[53] as explained in the following sections.
Selection of articles
Screening by title
After deleting duplicate articles, we will prepare a list of titles of all articles that will be independently
screened by a team of two researchers (SGSS and DN), who will independently determine the
suitability of articles for the second stage of screening by the abstract. At this stage, all article titles
marked as ‘to be excluded’ by both researchers will be removed and all articles marked as ‘to be
included’ will be saved as a different file for further screening by the abstract. For articles where the
recommendations of both researchers involved in title screening differed from each other, the third
reviewer (HCvW) will review the articles and have the final say in either including or excluding an

article. Thereafter, a list of all included articles will be prepared for the second screening by reading
the abstracts.
Screening by abstract
We will read abstracts of all articles retained after the initial articles screening by title will be screened
further for relevance to the aim and objectives of the study. The screening of abstracts will be
undertaken by the same two researchers (SGSS and DN) involved in the title screening. The process
for short listing of articles through abstract screening will be the same as reported under the article
screening by title stage.
Screening by reading full-text
We will collect the full text of all articles that will be shortlisted at the abstract level screening. A
team of two researchers who were involved in the title and abstract screening stages will review the
shortlisted articles and will decide whether an article should be included in or excluded from the
study. It might be possible that some articles will be found not relevant to the study aim and
objectives; hence, such articles will be excluded from the study; while the remaining articles will be
included in the last phase of article selection.
Selection and inclusion of studies
All of those articles that the two researchers (SGSS and DN) will independently identify as relevant to
the study will be included in the systematic literature review and meta-analysis. Any differences
between the two researchers will be resolved by the third reviewer (HCvW). Thereafter, full text
copies of all articles included in the systematic review will be obtained and read for data extraction as
reported below.

Data extraction process and items
Two independent reviewers (SGSS and DN) will thoroughly read the full text of shortlisted articles.
The two reviewers will independently extract information from the shortlisted articles on a
predetermined data extraction template (Table 3). Since, avoidance of bias and reduction of errors in
the data extractions is imperative in systematic literature reviews and meta-analysis;[49] hence, after
the completion of data extraction, the two data extraction forms will be compared and any differences
and discrepancies will be reconciled with discussion and in the case of non-agreement between the
two reviewers, a third researcher (HCvW) will be involved for arbitration and the final decision.
Since our systematic review will assess the effectiveness; we will therefore extract thorough details of
interventions, which is important for the reproducibility of effective interventions.[54,55] We will not
extract data at the level of individual patients but the cumulative data from the study, which will be
used for the synthesis and inclusion in the meta-analysis as explained below. We will not contact the
original researchers with regard to any queries regarding the data reported in their published articles.
Identification of multiple reports and publication of the same data could be possible whilst
undertaking a systematic review.[49] To deal with the duplicate or multiple reporting of the same data,
we will only report the data once that we will find to be comprehensive and reported in a detailed
form.
We will extract data on various items as shown in the data extraction template (Table 3), which we
have developed a priory in house using an Excel spreadsheet. With regard to the outcomes and

DATA SYNTHESIS AND REPORTING RESULTS
There are two options for reporting data in a systematic review on effectiveness statistical synthesis
(meta-analysis) and narrative summary (narrative synthesis).[48] We will extract and analyse data at
the study level, and we will also pool data from studies that will be sufficiently homogeneous. We
will report findings using a summary of the characteristics of included studies and the findings by the
type of digital technology intervention, the age, gender and ethnicity of participants, if possible. In
addition, we will undertake quantitative synthesis and descriptive/narrative synthesis for quantitative
and qualitative studies respectively. Moreover, we will exclude studies with missing values from the
meta-analysis.

Meta-analysis
In the meta-analysis, we will use the effect sizes as measured by common quantitative indicators such
as the risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and odds ratio (OR) for the dichotomous outcomes and the
weighted mean difference (WMD), and standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous
outcomes.[49] For every study included in our systematic review and meta-analysis, we will calculate
the effect size as reported by Masi et al.[33] In addition, we will report a statistical synthesis of our
meta-analysis using a statistical summary of RRs, ORs, WMDs and SMDs using the forest plots.[56]
For our meta-analysis, we will run the random-effects model as the statistical model[57,58] that is based
on the assumption that the true effect size varies between studies and follows a normal distribution
around the mean, which is opposite to the fixed effect model based on the assumption that all studies
have the same true effect size.[33] We will calculate the Q statistics and p –values for checking the
assumption of the homogeneity of effect sizes, and we will determine the T2 statistics for estimating
the magnitude of the variance of the true effect sizes between studies.[33]

Assessment of research quality, bias and heterogeneity
Two researchers (SGSS and DN) will independently assess the research quality and bias in the
selected studies using the validated tools (Table 4). Any discrepancy or disagreement among the
reviewers will be resolved by discussion and consensus between them or through arbitration of the
third reviewer (HCvW). We will evaluate heterogeneity i.e. variation in study outcomes/effect sizes
between studies by the Cochran’s Q test with a significance level of ρ < 0.05.[33,59] We will calculate
I2 statistic[33,60] to determine the proportion of variation in effect size across studies due to
heterogeneity considering I2 of 25% as low heterogeneity, 50% moderate heterogeneity[33,60] and 75%
as a high heterogeneity/variance between studies.[12,60] If the heterogeneity was substantial (I2
≥50%).[49] We would not run the meta-analysis and therefore we will report only a narrative synthesis.
For checking the publication bias in the studies included in our systematic review, we will use two
methods: graphical method using funnel plots and statistical method using the Egger’s test.[56,61] In
assessing the quality of research, we will apply the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.[62]

PATIENT AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT
The involvement of patients and public has been suggested in systematic reviews.[66] We could not
identify any patient diagnosed with loneliness or a suitable member of public to involve them in the
development of this protocol. As such there was no patient and public involvement at the protocol
stage in our study, like other published research protocols.[4,67]

ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION
This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of published research. Hence, we will not seek an
ethics approval because we will neither recruit any patients nor analyse data at an individual
participant level; however, we will pool data that will be analysed at the study level. We will
disseminate our findings through conference papers and presentations and publication of open access
articles in peer-reviewed journals.

DISCUSSION
We believe our research protocol includes a robust research strategy that will enable us to identify and
appraise the recent empirical research on digital interventions to reduce loneliness in adult people.
Our systematic literature review and meta-analysis will provide the latest evidence on the
effectiveness of digital interventions in reducing loneliness among adult people.
We will discuss our findings in relation to our aims and objectives as well as compare and contrast
our findings with the current knowledge in the existing body of evidence. We will highlight the

contributions, strengths and limitations of our study. In addition, we will discuss the significance,
applicability, generalisability and implications of our findings. In addition, we will suggest directions
for further research in the domain of loneliness with reference to the application of digital technology
interventions.

CONCLUSION
We anticipate that using this research protocol, we will find primary research using digital
interventions to reduce loneliness in adult people. We believe our robust research methodology and
analytical strategy will enable us to meet the objectives of our systematic review and meta-analysis.
We conclude that appraising the latest empirical research on digital interventions used to reduce
loneliness among adults could contribute in informing health and care and public health policy and
possibly other stakeholders and private entities (e.g. health insurers) aiming to tackle loneliness in the
adult population.

summary

INTRODUCTION
Rationale

3

Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.

2-5

Objectives

4

Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to
participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design
(PICOS).

6

Protocol and
registration

5

Indicate if a review protocol exists, if and where it can be accessed (e.g.,
Web address), and, if available, provide registration information including
registration number.

1 and 5

Eligibility
criteria

6

Specify study characteristics (e.g., PICOS, length of follow-up) and report
characteristics (e.g., years considered, language, publication status) used as
criteria for eligibility, giving rationale.

6-7

Information
sources

7

Describe all information sources (e.g., databases with dates of coverage,
contact with study authors to identify additional studies) in the search and
date last searched.

7-8

Search

8

Present full electronic search strategy for at least one database, including any
limits used, such that it could be repeated.

8

Study selection

9

State the process for selecting studies (i.e., screening, eligibility, included in
systematic review, and, if applicable, included in the meta-analysis).

9-10

Data collection
process

10

Describe method of data extraction from reports (e.g., piloted forms,
independently, in duplicate) and any processes for obtaining and confirming
data from investigators.

11

Data items

11

List and define all variables for which data were sought (e.g., PICOS,
funding sources) and any assumptions and simplifications made.

6, 11

Risk of bias in
individual
studies

12

Describe methods used for assessing risk of bias of individual studies
(including specification of whether this was done at the study or outcome
level), and how this information is to be used in any data synthesis.

12-13

Summary
measures

13

State the principal summary measures (e.g., risk ratio, difference in means).

12

Synthesis of
results

14

Describe the methods of handling data and combining results of studies, if
done, including measures of consistency (e.g., I2) for each meta-analysis.
