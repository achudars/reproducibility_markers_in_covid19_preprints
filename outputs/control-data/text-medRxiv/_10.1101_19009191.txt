KEY POINTS
Question: In the U.S., how has the escalation of
both firearm sales and firearm death rates affected
the country’s youngest population?

Findings: While the steadily increasing rate of
sales and concomitant availability of, and access to,
firearms in the U.S. has increased since 2004, fatal
firearm accidents in 1 to 4 year-olds increased
exponentially and at a rate greater than all other
evaluable causes of death in the age group.
Interpretation: The ominous acceleration of
firearm deaths and injuries among young
Americans requires urgent, definitive solutions
from multiple stakeholders to effectively reduce
firearm access.

ABSTRACT
Background: In the United States (U.S.), the
overall death rate in 1-4 year-olds had been
steadily declining until 2011, after which it
ceased to improve. To understand this trend
reversal, we investigated trends in the causes of
their deaths.

Methods: Mortality data were obtained from the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Institute for
Health Metrics and Evaluation, firearm
background check data from the National Instant
Criminal Background Check System, and civilian
firearm prevalence from the Small Arms Survey.

Findings: In 1-4 year-olds, the rate of fatal
firearm accidents during 2002-2017 increased
exponentially at an average rate of 6.0%/year
(p=0.0003). The rate of increase was the greatest
of all evaluable causes of death in the age group.
Both the rate increase and most recent absolute
rate in firearm accidental deaths in young
children were correlated with the concurrent
corresponding rate of firearm background checks
(p = 0.0002 and 0.003, respectively). Also, the
firearm accidental death rate in countries with
high civilian firearm prevalence was correlated
with the number of guns per civilian population
(p=0.002).

Interpretation: Prior to 2004, the childhood
firearm death rate did not increase during the
Federal Assault Weapons Ban. Since 2004 when
the Ban ended, the steadily increasing rate of
sales and concomitant availability of, and access
to, firearms in the U.S. has been associated with
an increase in fatal firearm accidents in its
youngest children. The acceleration of firearm
deaths and injuries among young Americans
requires urgent, definitive solutions that address
firearm prevalence.
Funding: No external funding.

INTRODUCTION
According to the Institute for Health Metrics and
Evaluation (IHME) Global Disease Burden (GBD)
database,1 the United States (U.S.) has had a much
slower reduction in the overall death rate in 1-4 yearolds since 1997 than all other countries of high sociodemographic index. By 2014 the rate was 43%-46%
higher in the U.S. (Fig. 1B) and highly statistically
significant (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1A).1 As of 2017, only
Brunei of the 39 other countries of high sociodemographic status had a higher rate.1 Even more
concerning, the death rate among 1-4 year-olds in the
U.S. ceased to decline since 2011 (Fig. 1B). Why has the
death rate in the youngest Americans failed to improve
while it has continued to do so in other countries?

2

Cunningham and colleagues reported that in
2016 firearms were the most common cause of death
in urban U.S. children and teenagers.2 They reported
the rate to be 37 times higher in the U.S. than in 12
other high-income countries and 5 times higher than
seven low-to-middle-income countries. A recent
study in Los Angeles County found that
unintentional firearm injuries were more common in
younger children, more frequently caused by a
firearm from within the home, and more likely to
involve friend/family.3 We therefore examined U.S.
and global firearm mortality data and found that the
firearm accident fatality rate increased exponentially
since the early 2000s in children <5 years of age.
We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that increasing
firearm prevalence in the U.S. is a cause of the
firearm accident mortality rate increase in young
children.
METHODS
Death rates and causes. We obtained annual
mortality data available since 1999 for the U.S. from
the CDC Wide-ranging ONline Data for
Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER)4 and for
other countries from the IHME GBD.1 The CDC
WISQAR database4 provided injury mortality data
for the U.S. prior to 1999. The International
Classification of Disease (ICD) 10 Codes5 for type
of firearm death were W32-34 for unintentional;
X93-95 for assault, Y22-24 for
unspecified/undetermined, W32,X93,Y22 for
handgun, W33,X94,Y23 for larger firearms, and
W34,X95,Y24 for other/unspecified firearm.
Firearm sales and civilian firearm prevalence.
We estimated national firearm sales from firearm
background checks since 1999 published by the
National Instant Criminal Background Check
System.6 Global data on estimated civilian gun
prevalence were obtained from the Small Arms
Survey.7
Trend analysis. We analyzed time trends with
the Joinpoint Regression Program8 that identifies
when a trend changes to another trend, the
probability range of the inflection, and the average
annual percent change (AAPC) and p-value for each
trend detected. We applied joinpoint analysis with
weighted least squares option, logarithmic
transformation, standard errors for annual death
rates, and constant variance (homoscedasticity) for
death rates without standard error values.

RESULTS

3

Firearm Death Rate Trends in 1 to 4 Year-Olds in
the U.S. during 1999-2017
The national firearm death rate in American 1-4
year-olds fell progressively during 1999-2003, after
which it increased exponentially (AAPC = 3.0, p =
0.003) (Fig. 2A). During 2003-2017, 60% of the
increase in the firearm death rate in 1-4 year-olds was
due to fatal accidents (unintentional causes), 27% to
homicides, and 13% to undetermined and other causes
(Fig. 2A). During 2002-2017 the firearm accidental
death rate in 1-4 year-olds increased exponentially at
an average AAPC of 6.0 (p = 0.0003) (Fig. 2A).
Compared to the rate during 1999-2004 before the
increase in the firearm background check rate, the
firearm accidental death rate in 1-4 year-olds increased
to 2.5 times higher in 2016-2017, according to the area
under the death rate vs. age curves (Fig. 3A). For ages
2, 3 and 4, the 2002-2017 AAPC was 9.1, 11.0 (p <
0.05), and 8.5 (p < 0.05), respectively (Fig. 3B).

Given the 2002-2017 era as having a continuously
increasing accidental firearm death rate in 1-4 yearolds, this cause of death was compared in Table 1 with
all of the leading causes of death in the age group
during those years. For causes that had more than 50
deaths in the age group during 2002-2017, firearm
accident fatalities had the greatest increase of the
leading 43 evaluable causes of death (Table 1), 40%
more than the cause with the 2nd greatest increase. The
3rd greatest increase was firearm deaths due to causes
other than accidents, primarily undetermined causes
and some homicides. It is likely that some of the
undetermined causes were accidents that were not
witnessed and thus not certain enough to be classified
as an accident. Of the 43 leading evaluable causes,
motor vehicle accidents in which 1-4 year-olds died as
occupants had the greatest decrease (AAPC = ̶ 8.14, p
< 0.0001). Since 1999-2004 when 1-4 year-olds were

>4 times likely to die in a motor vehicle than of a
firearm, the former declined at an AAPC of -10.5 (p <
0.0001) such that by 2014-2017 1-4 year-olds died
from bullets at the same rate as from motor vehicle
accidents (Fig. 4). During 2016-2017, one in every 122
deaths that occurred in 1-4 year-olds occurred as a
result of a firearm accident (Table 1).

Correlation of Firearm Death Rate Trend in 1-4
Year-Olds with Firearm Sales
The national firearm background check rate also
began to increase after 2004 and, thereafter,
accelerated exponentially at an average AAPC of 8.7
during 2004-2017 (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2B), concurrent
with the increases in overall firearm death (Fig. 2) and
fatal firearm death rates among 1-4 year-olds
(Fig 2A). During those years, the firearm accident
death rate in 1-4 year-olds and the annual firearm
background check rate were directly correlated (R2 =
0.70, p = 0.0002) (Fig. 5A). The firearm accident
death rate in 2017 for each legal jurisdiction (state and
District of Columbia) was also correlated with its
firearm background check rate for 2015-2017 (R2 =
0.17; p = 0.003) (Fig. 5B).

Type of Firearm Used in Deaths of 1-4 Year-Olds
(Supplemental Fig. S1)
The available CDC WONDER data has handguns
as the cause in 20%-30% of the fatal accidents, larger
firearms (rifles, shotguns, assault weapons, etc.) in
5%–10% of the deaths, and 60%–80% not specified as
to the type of firearm. The available data do not
suggest changes in the proportion of types of firearm
during 1999-2017. However, gun-related homicides in
the age group do have a trend, with unspecified
weapons increasing from 70%–80% during 1999-2004
to 90% by 2014.

Firearm Death Rate Trend in 1-4 Year-Olds and the
Federal Assault Weapon Ban
The U.S. had a Federal Assault Weapons Ban
from 1994 until 2004 when it was not renewed
because of equivocal evidence during the Ban that
firearm deaths had decreased. In retrospect, firearm
background checks decreased during the last 6 years of
the Ban (Fig. 2B) and 1-4 year-olds had rate decreases
during the Ban of fatal firearm accidents (AAPC = ̶
6.7, p < 0.0001), firearm homicides (AAPC = ̶ 4.5, p =
0.02), and overall firearm deaths (AAPC = ̶ 5.5, p =
0.001) (Supplemental Fig. S2). The year after the Ban
expired and the national firearm background check
rate began to exponentially increase, the rates of
overall firearm deaths, firearm suicides, and fatal
firearm accidents in 1-4 year-olds concurrently
increased (Supplemental Fig. S2).

Global Ranking of Firearm Accident Rate Trend in
1-4 Year-Olds
In terms of rate trends since 2002 when in the U.S.
the firearm death rate in 1-4 year-olds began to increase
(Fig. 2A), the U.S. had the greatest rate increase in the
world during 2002-2017, according to IHME GBD data
(Supplemental Table S1). Only 9 other countries had a
consistent increase and each of the 189 countries in the
rest of the world had a decrease (Supplemental
Table S1). The U.S. increase (AAPC = 6.01, p = 0.006)
was greater than all of the countries with an increase,
with the next greatest increase in Dominica (AAPC =
3.90). In terms of absolute rates during 2016-2017, the
U.S. had the 2nd highest firearm death rate
(203/100,000) among 1-4 year-olds of 58 countries in
Europe, North America, Australasia, and high-income
Asia (Supplemental Table S2). Montenegro had the
highest rate (217/100,000) and Greenland third

(150/100,000). The 2017 national firearm accidental
death rate in 1-4 year-olds was also directly correlated
with the estimated civilian gun prevalence in the 18
countries with the highest rates of civilian gun
ownership during 2017 and more than 2 million
population (Fig. 5C) (p = 0.002).
DISCUSSION
Our results indicate that an exponential increase in
the firearm death rate of America’s youngest children
explains in part why their overall mortality rate has
ceased to improve like it has in other sociodemographically advantaged countries. Since 2014, 14 year-olds in the U.S. were as likely to die of bullets
as in motor vehicle accidents. Most of the firearm
mortality increase in 1-4 year-olds was due to fatal
firearm accidents that also increased exponentially
during 2004-2017. If the trend continues, one in
every100 deaths among 1-4 year-olds in the U.S.
during 2019 will be due to firearm accidents. That
both the overall and accidental firearm death rate
increased while the overall and majority of causes of
death decreased adds greater significance to the
firearm problem.
Since 2004 when in the U.S. the Federal Assault
Weapons Ban ended and firearm sales began to
accelerate, the accidental firearm death rate in 1-4
year-olds was directly proportional to the increase in
firearm background checks. The most recent absolute
rates in firearm accidental deaths in the age group was
highly significantly correlated geographically (at the
state and D.C. level) with the concurrent
corresponding all-age rate of firearm background
checks. Also, the firearm accidental death rate in
countries with the high civilian firearm prevalence was
significantly correlated with the number of guns per
civilian population. We therefore hypothesize that the
increasing firearm death rates in young children that
we obsevered was due to increasing firearm
prevalence. Increasing violence displayed in video
games and on television may have contrbuted to
firearm death causation but only if firearms were
accessible.
A critical limitation of our study is the ecologic
limitation of attributing death rates to firearm sales rate
in a cause-effect relationship. Although the correlations
are not proof of causal relationship, the striking
similarity of the joinpoint regressions of the overall,
accidental, and undetermined firearm death rate profiles
with the gun sales rate and the high degrees of
correlation of accidental firearm death rates and firearm

6

background check rates (0.0004 ≤ p ≤ 0.003) are highly
suggestive of a causal relationship. Firearm accident
mortality rates, including pediatric deaths, have
previously been specifically linked to firearam sales and
Google searches for buying and cleaning guns.9
Statistically significant or not, firearm prevalence and
accidents is a logical synergism. There is also the
assumption that firearm background checks are a
surrogate for firearm sales. Background checks likely
underrepresent the number of guns actually purchased
since denials occur for <0.5% of checks, an approved
buyer may purchase multiple firearms, and few states
require checks for purchases from private parties. That
the number of firearms in the home is not as predictive
of suicide risk as the presence or absence of firearms10
also makes correlations more difficult to interpret to the
extent that the increase in gun sales increased the
number of guns per home more than the proportion of
homes with guns. Also, the data available were not
sufficient to analyze the role of other potentially
important factors such as race and socioeconomic status.
Multilple comparisons have found states with more
restrictive firearm legislation to have lower pediatric,
unintentional, suicide, and overall firearm-related fatality
rates, and more slowly rising suicide rates.11-15 A casecontrol study of firearms in events identified by medical
examiner and coroner offices from 37 counties in
Washington, Oregon, and Missouri, and 5 trauma centers
in Seattle, Spokane, Tacoma, and Kansas City found that
4 practices of keeping a gun locked, unloaded, storing
ammunition locked, and in a separate location are each
associated with a protective effect for firarm injuries in
homes with children and teenagers where guns are
stored.16 Having a gun in the home is associated with an
increased firearm death risk for everyone in the home,
including <5 year-olds.17 General Social Survey gun
ownership data indicates that handgun ownership in
American families with young children increased to 72%
in 2016 and is correlated with the increased death rate
among young children from 2006 to 2016.17 Broadly
reducing access to firearms has lowered firearm
mortality in other countries.18
The Federal Assault Weapons Ban has been
recently shown to have reduced mass shootings19 but
not, to our knowledge, unintentional firearm deaths
homicides in children. Assault weapons would not
seem to be major cause of accidental deaths in young
children. On the other hand, both handguns and long
guns had progressively lower rates of permits issued
during the last 6 years of the Ban (AAPC = –8.6, p =
0.03; AAPC = –4.8, p = 0.04, respectively)
(Supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting that handguns

The dramatic decrease in motor vehicle accident
deaths, with the most recent data indicating that it is
safer for 1-4 year-olds to be in cars than in homes with
firearms, raises the issue of vehicle and firearm death
comparisons. Federal funding of research was
available to study vehicle deaths and prohibited for
firearm research. Compared to requiring seat belt use,
special safety seats for infants, airbag installation,
power brake improvements and many other
automobile safety features, firearms have had little
such development. Requiring all drivers to be licensed
and requiring motor vehicles to be parked in safe spots
and their owners to be cited for parking violations has
no parallel in the firearm world. These comparisons
suggest what could be done to achieve a comparable
reduction in firearm deaths.

were also affected by the Ban. Since the national
firearm background check program began in
November 1998, firearm sales may have been
suppressed during the initial years of the ban, but the
synchronicity of the Ban and sales also suggests that
the Ban also suppressed sales of both handguns and
long guns. Also, the low rate of handguns specified to
have caused accidental deaths in 1-4 year-olds implies
larger firearms were a primary method. In addition, the
decreasing rate of handguns and increasing rate of
unspecified weapons used in homicides of 1-4 yearolds suggests that the age group has been increasingly
killed by larger firearms. The homicide trends are
consistent with an increasing availability and use of
larger weapons since the Federal Assault Weapons
Ban expired in 2004. Thus the non-specified
proportion of firearm accidental deaths may include an
increasing proportion of larger weapons. Finally, with
16,000,000 1-4 year-olds in the U.S. and at least 16
million assault weapons (called modern sporting rifles
by the National Shooting Sports Foundation20) in
private ownership in the U.S.,20 the average of 1
assault weapon for every 1-4 year-old suggests that
assault weapons by themselves could have contributed
directly to the fatal firearm accidents in the age group.
That the AR-15 (M16 style) rifle has become the most
popular single model of rifle in the country21 adds to
the feasibility of assault weapons accidentally killing
the country’s youngest children.

The prominence of firearm deaths in American
children requires addressing the problem of the
country’s gun plethora.22 Of the world's population,
the 4% that live in America own nearly half of the
entire global stock of 857 million civilian firearms.23
Eleven health professional organizations and the
American Bar Association have recommended
numerous national interventions that included
protecting children from gunshot injuries.24-28 The
American Academy of Pediatrics has conlcuded that
“the absence of guns from homes and communities is
the most effective measure to prevent suicide,
homicide, and unintentional injuries to children and
adolescents”.29 Because the gun lobby in the U.S.
influenced legislation prohibiting government during
the past 25 years from allocating resources to study the
problem, the state of the science of firearm injuries
among American children has lagged behind other
areas of injury prevention.30 In 2017, the Firearm
Safety Among Children and Teens (FACTS)
Consortium, a National Institute for Child Health and
Human Development-funded group of scientists and
stakeholders, was formed to develop research
resources for a pediatric-specific research agenda for
firearm injury prevention.31
Ultimately, the non-fatal injury rate, which is
multiple times higher than the death rate, must also be
considered. In one study, for every person <18 years of
age who died of bullets, 4 to 5 more were treated for
gunshot wounds.32 The overall human and financial
cost of firearm injuries and deaths in the U.S. is
extraordinary.

CONCLUSION
Young children in the U.S. have not had a
decreasing mortality rate when compared to other high
socio-demographic countries. A major reason is their
rate of firearm deaths and especially fatal firearm
accidents. Prior to 2004, the childhood firearm death
rate did not increase during the Federal Assault
Weapons Ban. Since then, the steadily increasing rate
of sales and concomitant availability of, and access to,
firearms in the U.S. has been associated with a
dramatic increase in fatal firearm accidents in young
children. The acceleration of firearm deaths and
injuries among young Americans has become a
national public health crisis that requires urgent and
definitive solutions to address firearm prevalence.
Twelve health professional organizations and the
American Bar Association have provided multiple
recommendations, including funding of the CDC and
National Institutes of Health to determine the most
effective solutions. Ignoring these recommendation s
and thereby allowing the increasing firearm death rate
in young children to continue to increase is not a
responsible option.
