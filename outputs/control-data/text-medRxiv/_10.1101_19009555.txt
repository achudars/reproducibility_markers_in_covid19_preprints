Abstract
The recent emergence and established presence of Aedes aegypti in the Autonomous
region of Madeira, Portugal, was responsible for the first autochthonous outbreak of dengue in
Europe. The island has not reported any dengue cases since the outbreak in 2012. However, there
is a high risk that an introduction of the virus would result in another autochthonous outbreak
given the presence of the vector and permissive environmental conditions. Understanding the
dynamics of a potential epidemic is critical for targeted local control strategies.

Here, we adapt a deterministic model for the transmission of dengue in A. aegypti
mosquitoes. The model integrates empirical and mechanistic parameters for virus transmission,
under seasonally varying temperatures for Funchal, Madeira Island. We examine the epidemic
dynamics as triggered by the arrival date of an infectious individual; the influence of seasonal
temperature mean and variation on the epidemic dynamics; and performed a sensitivity analysis
on the following quantities of interest: the epidemic peak size, time to peak and the final
epidemic size.

Our results demonstrate the potential for year-round transmission of dengue, with the
arrival date significantly affecting the distribution of the timing and peak size of the epidemic.
Late summer to early autumn arrivals is more likely to produce larger epidemics within a short
peak time. Epidemics within this favorable period had an average of 22% of the susceptible
population infected at the peak, at an average peak time of 82 days. We also demonstrated that
seasonal temperature variation dramatically affects the epidemic dynamics, with warmer starting
temperatures producing peaks more quickly after introduction and larger epidemics. Overall our
quantities of interest were most sensitive to variance in date of arrival, seasonal temperature,
biting rate, transmission rates, and the mosquito population; the magnitude of sensitivity differs
across quantities.

Our model could serve as a useful guide in the development of effective local control and
mitigation strategies for dengue fever in Madeira Island.

Introduction
Dengue is notably the most important mosquito-borne viral disease, with approximately
half the world’s population at risk of infection [1]. This arboviral disease, caused by a virus of
the Flaviviridae family, has gained renewed global attention due to its wide geographical spread
and increased burden in recent years. The spread of the disease is in concordance with the
geographical expansion of its primary vector (i.e. Aedes aegypti), characterized by the presence
of a suitable climate and increase in global trade and travel [2, 3].

A paradigmatic example of the recent spread of dengue and of its epidemic potential was
demonstrated in Madeira Island, an autonomous region of Portugal. A. aegypti was first detected
in Funchal, the capital city of Madeira Island, in 2005 and by October 2012 the island reported
its first autochthonous case of Dengue serotype 1 (DENV 1) [4]. The importance of this
epidemic is demonstrated by three main reasons: (1) It was the first sustained autochthonous
transmission of dengue in the European Union since the 1920s [5]; (2) its size, with 1080
confirmed cases (of the 2168 probable cases reported) and 78 cases reported in 13 other
European countries in travelers returning from Madeira [6]; and (3) the rapid time course of the
epidemic, that peaked within a month after the official report of the first case in October [7].

To understand the complexities of this outbreak, Lourenco and Recker [8] developed an
ento-epidemiological mathematical model to explore the ecological conditions and transmission
dynamics. Their findings suggest the virus was introduced over a month before cases were
reported (in August). In their model, asymptomatic circulation occurred before the two initial
autochthonous cases were reported in October, maintaining the virus in the population.
Furthermore, their findings indicate that the transmission dynamics and eventual epidemic
burnout was driven predominantly by the influence of temperature on the life history traits of the
mosquitoes (incubation period, mosquito mortality and aquatic developmental rates). The
seasonal drop in autumn temperatures led to a reduction of the vectorial capacity and effectively
stopped the virus propagation.
Their findings are consistent with previous experimental work addressing the strong
influence of temperature on the life history traits of the mosquitoes and arbovirus transmissions

[9-12]. Likewise, many existing mechanistic transmission models have integrated the effects of
temperature on mosquito traits to understand how it influences the probability and magnitude of
dengue transmissions [13-17]. Other recent work examined the influence of seasonal variation in
temperature on the epidemic magnitude and duration [18, 19]. These models emphasize the
strong, nonlinear (often unimodal) influence of temperature and seasonality on dengue
transmission and epidemic dynamics.

Expanding on previous work, we here explore the impact of seasonal temperature
variations on the potential epidemic dynamics on Madeira Island. It is imperative to explore the
influence of seasonality, as Madeira Island presents with a range of contrasting bioclimates as a
result of its heterogeneous landscape and strong influence from the Gulf Stream and Canary
current [20]. The southern coastal regions of the island (including Funchal), at low altitudes,
have higher annual temperatures in comparison to the northern coastal regions or inland regions
with higher altitudes [20, 21]. In addition, though the island has not reported any dengue cases
since the outbreak in 2012, it is likely that new introductions would result in local transmission
given the presence of the vector and permissive environmental conditions. A recent vector
competence study with A. aegypti from Madeira reported virus transmission potential (virus in
saliva) from 2 Madeira populations, although the proportions transmitting were low
(transmission rate of 18%, 14 days post-infection) [22]. This demonstrates the potential risk for
the local transmission of dengue 2 serotype (DENV 2) if introduced on the island. With an
increase in co-circulation of all dengue serotypes (DENV 1-4) worldwide [23, 24], and
Madeira’s increasing lure as a popular year-round travel destination, a potential introduction is
likely [25].

We incorporate a standard deterministic SEI-SEIR transmission model parameterized
from existing literature and available field data. The main goals of this model are: (1) to examine
the epidemic dynamics in Funchal, Madeira as triggered by the arrival of an infectious individual
at different timepoints during the year; and (2) to examine the influence of seasonal temperature
mean and variation on epidemic dynamics. To do this, we employed a different modeling
framework from that of [8], in that our model explicitly accounts for seasonality and temperature
dependence in the transmission dynamics. Likewise, we explore epidemiologically relevant

outcomes of epidemic size, peak incidence and time to peak, rather than basic reproduction
number or vectorial capacity, which are more complex measures of epidemic dynamics.

Methods
Model framework
We adapt a deterministic compartmental vector-host transmission model exploring
chikungunya virus invasion in Florida, USA with A. aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes,
from Lord et al. (unpublished work). This was adapted into a standard SEI-SEIR transmission
model with one vector, similar to others used in modelling dengue transmission (e.g. in [26-29]).
The SEI component of our model describes the vector population, represented as
susceptible (𝑆𝑣 ), exposed (𝐸𝑣 ), and infectious (𝐼𝑣 ). Our models explicitly consider a single vector
and a single life stage, i.e. adult females of A. aegypti. Mosquitoes enter the susceptible class
through a recruitment term, based on observed seasonality patterns from field data in Funchal
[30]. The recruitment term does not explicitly model the aquatic (eggs, larvae, and pupae) stage
of mosquitoes and is not linked to current population size, but explicitly includes seasonality in
recruitment to the adult female population. A susceptible mosquito moves into the exposed class
(𝐸𝑣 ), after biting an infectious human and becoming infected with dengue virus. After a
temperature dependent extrinsic incubation period, surviving mosquitoes get transferred to the
infectious class (𝐼𝑣 ). They remain in the infectious class until death, due to the assumption of the
absence of immune response. Mosquitoes leave the system through a temperature dependent
mortality function. We assume the virus infection does not affect the lifespan of the mosquitoes
and that there is no significant vertical transmission.
The SEIR component of our model describes the human population represented as
susceptible (𝑆ℎ ), exposed (infected but not infectious) (𝐸ℎ ), infectious (𝐼ℎ ), and recovered
(immune) (𝑅ℎ ). Our model assumes the human population (𝑁ℎ ) to be constant, not subject to
demography as we considered a single outbreak with a duration in the order of a year. A
susceptible individual enters the exposed class (𝐸ℎ ) after being successfully infected, by an
infectious mosquito bite. We do not explicitly account for repeated biting, interrupted feeds or

alternative host preferences. We also assume that not every infectious bite leads to successful
human infection. Once a human individual is exposed, they enter an intrinsic incubation period,
until they become infectious. They then move to the infectious class (𝐼ℎ ) and can transmit the
virus back to a susceptible mosquito. We assume that humans stay infectious for a period after
which they recover. Once a human individual enters the recovered/immune class (𝑅ℎ ), we
assume a lifelong immunity, as multiple co-circulating serotypes of dengue virus are not
considered. A resulting schematic representation of the model is shown in Fig 1.

estimation of the relative importance of the total recruitment; 3 Mosquitoes optimal survival range: (15 > 𝑇 <

Mosquito recruitment. The coefficient (𝜌) in equation (1) above is the daily recruitment
term of susceptible mosquitoes. The total number of female mosquitoes recruited into the
population over the year is divided into two main phases: baseline, year-round recruitment, and a
unimodal peak season recruitment. This is based on the seasonal pattern of mosquitoes on the
island observed from the A. aegypti mosquito entomological surveillance by the Institute of
health administration, IP-RAM and the Funchal natural history museum [30, 45]. Weekly
mosquito trap data is geo-processed and spatial analyzed to identify areas with mosquito activity
based on the presence/absence of eggs, the number of eggs and adult mosquitoes captured [30].
Visual inspection of the entomological data for the years 2012 – 2019 (weekly timeseries graphs of the cumulative number of eggs and adult mosquitoes) [33] demonstrate a
unimodal seasonal pattern for mosquito activity during the entomological season. The unimodal
peak starts around June through to early December, with other months of the year (i.e. January to
May) having little to no activity. Using a Gaussian curve, we estimated the timeline for our
unimodal peak recruitment to reflect this seasonal pattern as best possible.

Actual quantifications of mosquito population density remain a grey area. However, the
majority of dengue models [8, 27, 31, 32, 46] have adopted the use of a mosquito-to-human ratio
of 2:1. We adopted this framework for setting the estimated number of mosquitoes recruited
during the unimodal peak season (𝑟𝛿 ). From the derived number of mosquitoes recruited during
the peak season, we assumed an additional 5% to be added in the baseline, year-round
recruitment (𝑝𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 ). The recruitment of susceptible mosquitoes is specified by the following
equations:

𝜌(𝑡) = 𝜌𝑏 (𝑡) + 𝑅𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 𝛿(𝑡)

Here, 𝜌(𝑡) represents the number of adult female mosquitoes recruited per time step;

during the unimodal peak season; 𝜌𝑏 (𝑡) is the number of mosquitoes added to the population at
intervals (𝑖𝑣) during the all-year round recruitment. 𝑅𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 is the total number of mosquitoes
recruited during the unimodal peak season; 𝑅𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 is the total number of mosquitoes recruited
during the baseline, year-round recruitment; 𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡 is the total number of mosquitoes recruited into
the population over the year.

Seasonal forcing. To introduce seasonality in our model, we allowed temperature to vary over
time by sinusoidally forcing [47]. The daily mean temperature was modelled as a cosine curve
with a period of 365 days as specified below:

𝑇 (𝑡) =

𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥 −𝑇𝑚𝑖𝑛
2

∗ (− cos (

2𝜋(𝑡− 𝜔)
365

)) + 𝑇𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛

(16)

Here, 𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥 , 𝑇𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 , and 𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥 are the average daily maximum, mean, and minimum
temperatures over the year, (𝑡) is time measured in days and (𝜔) is the phase shift to align the
cosine function with the seasonal factors in Funchal. For our temperature model calibration, we
extracted a 10 year (2008 – 2018) historical daily temperature data for Funchal from Weather
Underground [44]. Utilizing the mean of the minimum, average and maximum daily mean
temperatures, we set estimates for our seasonality parameters. The mode minimum temperature
across the years occurred on February 15; hence we set our phase shift at this point to reflect the
long-term average conditions in Funchal, Madeira (𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 22° C, 𝑇𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 = 20°C, 𝑇𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 17°C).

Temperature dependent parameters. The extrinsic incubation period (𝛾𝑣 ) is modelled to be
temperature dependent, modified from [48]. Using a linear temperature function, specified by a
slope (𝛾𝑣𝑠 ), the rate near the midpoint of the plausible temperatures range for vectorial capacity
(set at 22.5°C), and a defined lower temperature threshold (set at 10ºC, at which point (𝛾𝑣 ) equals
zero). Mortality rates (𝜇𝑣 ) for mosquitoes was modelled as a function of temperature using a
mechanistic thermal response curve as described in [13]. They fitted their data as a complex
polynomial resulting in a basin- shape curve, with optimal temperature for mosquito’s survival
set at a range of 15℃ > 𝑇 < 30℃. Based on a preliminary exploration of changes to the
mortality function, we modified the fitted polynomial to a piecewise linear curve with fixed,
minimal mortality in the same temperature range. Mortality rate then increases quickly and
linearly at temperatures outside this lower and upper bound, as specified by the function slope
(𝜇𝑣𝑠 ).
Starting conditions
The model requires an estimate of each state variable (humans and mosquitoes in each
class), along with estimates or values chosen from distributions for each parameter. Our
parameter values are based on multiple citations from reviewed literature of previous empirical
studies or lab trials and expert opinion. We emphasize previous studies within the context of
Funchal, Madeira Island (since our main objective was to parameterize the model for the island)
and chose parameter ranges to reflect conditions in Funchal.

The model assumes a homogeneously mixed population, with a total human population
set at a constant 30,000 (representative of the population of the most populous civil parish –
Santo António – in the municipality of Funchal and the island) [43]. Since the human
components of the transmission cycle are not seasonal, we set the intrinsic incubation (1⁄𝛾ℎ ) and
the infectious period (1⁄𝜂ℎ ) to constants of 6 and 5 days respectively. For this model, we
considered only a single dengue serotype. Based on our mosquito recruitment term, the initial
susceptible mosquito population is set as the number of females (𝜌𝑏 (𝑡)) added to the population
at intervals (𝑖𝑣), as calculated in equation (12) above. With all infectious classes for both human

and mosquitoes set to zero, an infection is triggered by the arrival of one infectious human on a
specified day (𝑡𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 ) into the fully susceptible population. The default initial conditions are thus:
(𝑆ℎ ; 𝐸ℎ ; 𝐼ℎ ; 𝑅ℎ ; 𝑆𝑣 ; 𝐸𝑣 ; 𝐼𝑣 ) = (𝑁ℎ ; 0; 0; 0; 𝑝𝑏 (𝑡); 0; 0) where 𝑁ℎ = 30,000.
Simulations were set to start at the coldest day in the annual cycle (i.e. February 15) and
ran for 730 days thereafter (allowing for simulation with 𝑡𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 later in the year). We set an
arbitrary cut-off value for the infectious human, exposed and infectious mosquitoes classes: if
(𝐼ℎ , 𝐸𝑣 , 𝐼𝑣 , all <0.5) the simulation is terminated and restarted with the classes set to zero. This
cutoff is necessary otherwise extremely low levels of infection may persist for long periods; in
the natural system, there would be a high probability that the virus would go extinct [49].

We performed a preliminary exploration of parameter values to determine their effects on
transmission. The choice of the final parameter values was based on permissibility for
transmission. The preliminary exploration also informed the initial conditions (described above)
and parameter ranges for sensitivity analyses (Table 2).

Model simulations were performed using the governing systems of differential equations
of MATLAB’s inbuilt routine “ode45” [50]. Simulation outputs were processed in the R
Programming Language version 3.5.3 [51].

Quantities of interest
Given that a simulation evolves into an epidemic (defined as (𝐼ℎ > 2), after the virus
introduction), we analyze each simulation for the following quantities of interest (QOI): the
epidemic peak size (maximum human infected (𝑚𝑎𝑥𝐼ℎ ) at any given point during the
simulation); time to peak infection in humans (time from introduction to 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝐼ℎ , as 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥𝐼ℎ ); the
final epidemic size, which represents a measure of epidemic suitability (cumulative proportion of
humans infected, 𝑐𝑢𝑚𝐼ℎ ⁄𝑁ℎ , at the final time step).

Initial introduction and epidemic dynamics
Firstly, we examine the variability in epidemic dynamics, as a result of different arrival
dates of an infectious human in a susceptible population. To do this, we ran simulations for all
365 calendar days of the year (𝑡𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 = 1, 2, 3…365), with all other parameters fixed at their
default values and initial conditions (Table 2). Each simulation was started on February 15 (the
phase shift in the annual cycle) and ran for 2 years.

Seasonal variance and epidemic dynamics
Next, we examine the epidemic dynamics as a function of seasonal temperature variation.
Utilizing the same compartmental framework with default initial conditions and parameter
values, we ran sets of simulations under two different temperature regimes [18]. First, we
simulated a set of temperature regimes as observed in the historical decadal data for Funchal,
Madeira. The mean temperature varied from 19.0 ºC to 21.0 ºC in increments of 0.2 ºC, while the
temperature range (i.e. 𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥 − 𝑇𝑚𝑖𝑛 ) varied from 4.0 ºC to 6.0 ºC, in the same increments of 0.2
ºC, resulting in 121 simulation runs. The variability in epidemic dynamics is then examined as a
function of starting temperature. Starting temperature is defined as the temperature on the day of
introduction of the virus (𝑡𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 ), as derived from the temperature curves.
Next, we simulate a wider set of temperature regimes to examine plausible future forcing
scenarios based on near-term projections of seasonal temperature changes in the region of
Madeira Island [52]. Mean temperature was varied between 15.0 ºC to 30.0 ºC in increments of
0.2 ºC, while range varied from 0.0 ºC to 15.0 ºC in increments of 0.2 ºC (i.e. a total of 5776
simulation runs). It is worth noting that most of the temperatures in this regime are outside
projected changes for the island’s region, and very unlikely to occur in Funchal. However, by
simulating a wider set of temperature regimes, we are able to characterize uncertainties and
probable outcomes of a local epidemic across other regions on the island. This also allows us to
simulate similar extreme temperature conditions already recorded on the Funchal in recent times
(for example, high temperatures of 37.8ºC on August 5, 2016, and 26.5 ºC on December 5, 2018
[53, 54].

Model sensitivity analysis
To characterize the model parameters exerting the most influence on our quantities of
interest, we performed a variance-based global sensitivity analysis, using a combination of Latin
hypercube sampling (LHS) and a multi-model inference on regression-based models. LHS is a
stratified Monte Carlo sampling technique, where specified parameter distributions are divided
into (M) equiprobable intervals, and then sampled, here (M) is the sample size. The entire range
of each parameter is explored, by sampling each interval for each parameter only once without
replacement. Parameters values are then randomly resorted into sets to use for simulation. The
LHS method assumes that the sampling is performed independently for each parameter, thereby
allowing for an un-biased estimate [55, 56]. Parameter ranges for sampling were derived from
existing literature, expert opinion and field-based data (Table 2), we assumed a uniform
distribution for all parameter values. LHS sampling was programmed in MATLAB.

Multi-model inference on a generalized least square (GLS) regression was used to
estimate the relative importance of the input parameters. Multi-model inference uses the
information-theoretic approach to offer a more objective way to assess the relative importance of
input variables by inferring all possible models from a defined candidate set [57, 58]. A vector of
the input parameters (𝑥𝑝 ) were fitted into all possible unique models and then ranked from best
to worst, based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) values. An estimate of the relative
importance of a single parameter (𝑝) was then calculated by summing the Akaike weights (𝑤)
across all fitted models where parameter (𝑝) occurs. Akaike weights are normalized, such that
the sum over all models considered is 1. The relative importance of parameter (𝑝) was quantified
by the sum (𝑤) for the parameter. The larger the sum of the weight (between 0 and 1 by
definition) the more important the parameter is, relative to the other parameters [58]. Input
parameters were then ranked in terms of their importance to the quantities of interest. Multimodel inference analysis was done using the glmulti R package [59].

Our analysis considered two separate candidate model sets, one with main effects only
and one with main effects and pairwise (first order) interactions of input parameters on our

quantities of interest. The first analysis (i.e. main effects only) utilized all possible unique
candidate models through an exhaustive screening method. However, the second analysis
utilized only a subset of all possible candidate models, using a genetic algorithm [59], as it was
infeasible to consider all. Our confidence set (for both analysis) was defined as all models within
two Akaike information criterion (AIC) unit difference (ΔAIC) from the best model (see
appendix for more details). Models in the confidence set are averaged to produce the relative
importance and coefficient estimates of input parameters. Note, before the multi-model inference
fitting, we normalized the input parameters (by centering on zero and scale to unit variance) to
allow comparison of resulting model-averaged estimates on a common scale.

Results
Initial introduction and epidemic dynamics
We examined the timing and size of the epidemic peak as a function of different arrival
dates of an infectious human into the susceptible population. An epidemic outbreak occurred for
all simulated arrival dates in the year, with varying epidemic peak size and time to peak,
indicating that the default parameter values used for simulations were permissive for
transmission. Most simulations responded unimodally with peaks occurring few weeks after the
arrival of an infectious human, this was typical for summer (June – August) arrivals (Figs 2A
and 2B). However, some simulations responded bimodally, i.e. an initial small outbreak, then a
prolonged low-level transmission until another outbreak occurs (Figs 2C and 2D). This
prolonged transmission was typical for arrival dates at the start of the winter (i.e. arrival dates of
the 12 to 19 December).

We examine this behavior further by comparing the disease progression in the human
population with that of the mosquito population (Fig 2D). Simulations with a late arrival of the
infectious human in December had a lower chance to evolve into a large unimodal outbreak,
because of the depletion of the mosquito population. Following the initial outbreak, a low
transmission is maintained until the next seasonal peak recruitment of the mosquitoes, before
another outbreak. This means the dynamics of the epidemic, is also modulated by the temporal
dynamics of the mosquito population, however, this is not the focus of our analysis.

Fig 3 shows our QOIs, for all dates over a calendar year (simulation start date of

arrival, with shorter epidemic peak timing, producing higher peak incidence and vice versa.
Epidemic peak time monotonically decreases as a function of the date of arrival until October
(mid- autumn season), then reverses to an increase, with a steep spike in mid-December and
reverts to a decrease (Fig 3). Similarly, epidemic peak size monotonically increases until
October, then reverses to a steady decline until mid-December and reverts to an increase (Fig 3).

In part, these discontinuities are reflections of scoring each run for a single peak; and
corresponds to the model behavior shifts from the classical rapid unimodal epidemic, to the
bimodal and prolonged epidemics.

arrival of an infectious human, simulation start date of February 15. The blue square points represent the time to peak infection in
humans (in days). The red diamond points represent the maximum number of humans infected at any given point during the

represented as the proportion of humans infected (rather than number). Simulations for arrivals on the 12 to 19 December,
resulted in a prolonged low-level transmission, with bimodal peak, while other dates had a classical unimodal peak.
Note: We examined the fluctuation in the epidemic peak time and size on August 15, for a possible shift in model behavior, there
was no change from the classical unimodal peak behavior observed around this date.

Overall, the shifts in epidemic dynamics are driven by the seasonal change (autumn and
winter seasons) and its effect on transmission dynamics. Epidemic peak size was highest (with
23% of the susceptible population infected), for an arrival date on September 3rd, with a short
time to peak of 90 days (Fig 2A). Epidemic peak size was lowest (with 0.04% of the susceptible
population infected) for an arrival date on December 12th, with a longer time to peak of 339 days

(Fig 2C). All simulations ultimately infected 100% of the human population, except for arrival
dates in mid-December, with a final epidemic size of 97% of the population (Fig 3).

These results show that under the conditions used here, an epidemic potential exists in all
seasons of the year, with most favorable seasons for a large outbreak being in late summer/early
autumn season. Epidemics occurring within this favorable period had an average epidemic peak
size of 22% of the susceptible population infected, with a time to peak of 82 days. Arrival dates
of an infectious human, in mid-autumn and early-winter season, can dramatically affect the
epidemic dynamics.

Seasonal variance and epidemic dynamics
To examine the epidemic dynamics as a function of the seasonal temperature variance,
we simulated two different sets of temperature regimes, with a fixed arrival date in mid-summer
(August 15). In the first set of temperature regimes (historical; 𝑇𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 varied from 19.0°C to
22.0°C and 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒 varied from 4.0°C to 6.0°C, both in increments of 0.2°C), the timing and
magnitude of the epidemic peak vary inversely as a function of starting temperature (calculated
for August 15 from 𝑇𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 and 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒 using equation 16). Epidemic peak size increases
monotonically with an increase in starting temperature, i.e. warmer temperatures at onset
produce large epidemic peak size with a short peak time and vice versa (Fig 4A). The final
epidemic size was insensitive to starting temperatures, as all simulations within this regime
produced final epidemic sizes of 100% of the population infected.

identical for simulations with the same starting temperatures and overlapping points are not visible on the graphs.
The default parameters from Table 2 were used for these simulations.

In the second set of temperature regimes (future; 𝑇𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 varied from 15.0°C to 30.0°C
and 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒 varied from 0.0°C to 15.0°C, both in increments of 0.2°C), epidemic peak time and
size show similar inverse variation as a function of starting temperature, although the overall
behavior is different. Epidemic peak size had a unimodal distribution with its peak at ~30 ºC and
declines rapidly afterwards (conversely the time to peak decreases until 30 ºC). At this peak of
~30 ºC, the epidemic peak size was at 26% of the susceptible population infected, within a short
peak time of 55 days. On the other hand, the final epidemic size steeply increases as a function of
starting temperature, and plateaus at 20 ºC to 34 ºC (with 100% of the population infected),
before steeply declining (Fig 4B). No epidemic occurred at lower starting temperatures of 15-17
ºC.

To further examine how mean temperature and seasonal variance combined to influence
the epidemic size, Fig 5 shows the variation in the final epidemic size across the annual
temperature bands. Thermal environments of mean annual temperatures between ~18 ºC to 28 ºC
support high epidemic size, at both low and high seasonal variance. Mean annual temperature
bands between ~28 ºC to 30 ºC supports a high epidemic size at low seasonal variance, this
steadily diminishes as seasonal variance increases. No epidemic was produced at low mean
annual temperatures of 15 ºC to ~17 ºC and corresponding low seasonal variance. In general,
under the conditions used here, the dynamics of the epidemic are largely driven by the seasonal
variation in temperature.

0°C to 15°C, a total of 5776 simulations. Default parameters from Table 2 were used for these simulations, except
for temperature parameters.

Model sensitivity analysis
Model sensitivity was characterized using 500 simulations runs for dengue parameter
ranges as given in Table 2. All parameters were uniformly distributed for the LHS sampling. The
conditions here were also permissive for epidemics, with (𝐼ℎ > 2) in 498 of the 500 simulated
parameter sets. The epidemic progression in these parameter sets was consistent with the general
model behavior seen in Figs 2A and 2C (i.e. a combination of unimodal and bimodal responses).
The distribution of the QOIs had a wider range of values ( i.e. 𝑀𝑎𝑥𝐼ℎ =18 to 9537 humans
infected; 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥𝐼ℎ = 20 to 689 days from 𝑡𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 ; 𝑐𝑢𝑚𝐼ℎ = 72% to 100% of the population infected),
thus providing more variation in the sensitivity analysis.

Table 3 shows the relative importance of the input parameters to our QOIs, using uniform
LHS distributions for dengue parameters (Table 2). Considering the main effects only, under the
parameter variation used, epidemic peak characteristics were sensitive to the arrival date of the
infectious human and mean annual temperature. The final epidemic size was more sensitive to
the mosquito life history trait parameters. Other influential parameters on all the QOIs were the
mosquito biting rate, transmission rates, and mosquito recruitment. Our QOIs were least
sensitive to the temperature range parameter (Table 3).

Relative importance and model averaged parameter coefficient from best-supported models (confidence set of
models, see appendix for details). The relative importance of parameters on a scale between 0.00 and 1.00; the
model-averaged coefficients for parameters in parentheses - effects are summarized by their direction (+|−),
positive indicates the QOI increases as the parameter increases, while negative indicates QOI decreases as the
parameter increases. Before model fitting, parameters were centered on zero and scaled to unit variance, to
normalize parameters within the same range, hence coefficient estimates are within the range of 0.0 to 1.0. QOI is
denoted by: 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝐼ℎ = the epidemic peak size; 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥𝐼ℎ = time to peak; 𝑐𝑢𝑚𝐼h = final epidemic size. Notations and

influential to all QOIs include interactions (terms) between arrival date of an infectious human
and the mosquito life history trait parameters (i.e. biting rate, transmission rates, and

Discussion
We extend the Lord et al. (unpublished work) model for chikungunya in A. aegypti and A.
albopictus mosquitoes in Florida to a deterministic compartmental model for dengue fever in in
A. aegypti in Madeira Island. This SEI-SEIR model explores dengue epidemic dynamics as
triggered by the arrival of an infected person in Funchal, Madeira and the effects of seasonally
varying temperature on transmission. Our analysis focused on three quantities of interest: time to
epidemic peak, epidemic peak size and the final size of the epidemic. We then used a global
sensitivity analysis to determine which input parameters were most important to quantities of
interest.

With the simulations of our model, we show that the date of arrival of an infected human
in a susceptible human population dramatically affects the timing and magnitude of an epidemic
peak. Given the default parameter values used here, the arrival of an infected person at any time

within a calendar year in Funchal can evolve into an epidemic producing a sizable outbreak.
Outbreaks starting with the arrival of the infected human at the beginning of winter (i.e. in
December), took a longer time to peak, with a resulting bimodal outbreak response. These
arrivals coincided with the depletion of the mosquito population; hence an initial small outbreak
occurs, then a prolonged low-level transmission until the number of susceptible mosquitoes is
replenished (at the next seasonal peak recruitment), then another outbreak occurs. This suggests
the temporal dynamics of the mosquito population is important in determining the epidemic
dynamics. This also suggests that the virus can remain viable within the population at low rates,
until the next favorable season for transmission.

In contrast, arrival at the end of summer (late August), and early autumn (September and
October) produces epidemics with a much faster peak rate and a corresponding large epidemic
size. These transient epidemics are indicative of a higher transmission potential at this point of
the year and are consistent with the scenario of the 2012 outbreak [6]. In this outbreak, the
epidemic peaked approximately one month following the initial cases, with a resultant large
epidemic size [7]. This also further reiterates the conclusions of [8], regarding the time point in
the year with the highest epidemic risk and when local control strategies should be intensified.
The overall model behavior in response to the timing of virus introduction within the susceptible
population is similar to other previous dengue models [26, 60]

Furthermore, we showed the interaction between seasonal temperature mean and range in
determining the timing and size of an epidemic peak. The historical decadal weather data for
Funchal, Madeira had an annual mean temperature of 20ºC and an average seasonal temperature
range of 5ºC, a highly suitable thermal environment for the vectorial capacity of A. aegypti
mosquitoes and arbovirus transmission. As expected, all our model simulations for this set of
temperature regimes evolved into an epidemic. Both epidemic peak size and time to peak
responded monotonically to starting temperature, with warmer temperatures at onset producing
high prevalence and faster peaks. Subsequently, when we widened the temperature regimes the
epidemic peak size responded unimodally to starting temperature, with a peak at ~30ºC.

Extending the temperature regimes allowed us to demonstrate the nonlinear influence of
the interaction between annual mean temperature and range on epidemic dynamics. At a low
annual mean temperature (15ºC to 17ºC) and range (0ºC to ~10ºC), no epidemic occurred;
however, this temperature band becomes suitable for transmission as the temperature range
increases beyond this point. Intermediate annual mean temperatures (~18ºC to ~28ºC), supported
epidemic transmission at both low and high temperature range (i.e. 0ºC to 15ºC). Epidemics
introduced within these temperature regimes had the highest epidemic suitability (using final
epidemic size as a measure of epidemic suitability). Lastly, at high annual mean temperatures (>
28ºC to 30ºC) and range (0ºC to ~10ºC), transmission was supported with high epidemic
suitability. However, epidemic suitability diminishes as temperature range increases.

To reiterate, most of the simulated temperatures are very unlikely to occur in Funchal,
with the exception of sporadic extreme summer temperatures and heat waves. Such sporadic
extreme events have been documented, with recent abrupt changes in temperatures on the island
[53, 54]. Hence our simulations give an estimate of epidemic suitability in the presence of these
extreme temperature conditions. Overall these distinct thermal responses are similar to those
discussed in the works of [17] and [18], which investigated the effects of temperature on dengue
transmission. Other models (e.g. [13, 19, 61] have shown that the influence of temperature on
other mosquito life history traits (e.g. biting rates and population size) can contribute
significantly to transmission dynamics. Although we did not consider these factors, our results
provide insights about suitable thermal environments for dengue transmission and potential
epidemic suitability in Funchal, Madeira.

Our sensitivity analysis further characterizes the variability in epidemic dynamics as a
function of the arrival date of one infectious human into the susceptible population and the
seasonal temperature regime. There was a significant difference between the sensitivity of the
quantities of interest to the parameters. The timing and magnitude of the epidemic peak were
more sensitive to parameter variation in arrival date and mean annual temperature, than the final
epidemic size. So, slight changes in the parameter values will have more effect on the epidemic
peak characteristics. Overall the quantities of interest were sensitive to the biting rate,

transmission rates, and mosquito population size. This is consistent with other modeling studies
that highlight the importance of the mosquito dynamics on epidemic outcomes [27, 62, 63].

Our sensitivity analysis went one step further by characterizing the interaction effects
between the parameters on the epidemic dynamics. Though this was not the focus of our
analysis, it can be useful for improving understanding of the complex processes that interact to
determine epidemic dynamics. Likewise, from a control and mitigation perspective, the
interaction term effects are useful to understand how the implementation of a specific control
strategy can have dramatic effects on the mosquito life history traits and in turn the overall
epidemic dynamics. A cautionary note, our sensitivity analysis varied only the mosquito portion
of the transmission cycle and does not account for the variance in the human transmission and its
combined influence on the epidemic dynamics.

Putting this all together, our model could be used as a mathematical tool to study
different epidemic scenarios and shifts in epidemic suitability for other regions in Madeira
Island. Near term projection for seasonal temperature variation for the region of Madeira island
(i.e. the North Atlantic, Europe and Mediterranean region), predicts a warming of ~2°C in annual
mean temperature, with summer months of June, July and August (JJA) temperatures warming
up to ~2.9°C [52, 64]. Considering the implications of this in view of our results, we can
speculate that the south coast region of Madeira Island (where Funchal is located), would
continue to support potential year-round transmission, with possible higher epidemic suitability.
The north coast and inland regions of the island, where current climate suggests limited or no
epidemic suitability could have an increased potential to support transmission in extreme
summer months. It is important to note that these projected shifts in epidemic suitability will also
be influenced by other factors like rainfall, humidity, and anthropogenic activities. Thus,
seasonal temperature variation must be considered jointly with these factors.

It is worth reiterating that the default parameters values used in our model were
permissive for epidemics and likely more permissive than the real world. Likewise, our model
made several assumptions for convenience and does not cover the full complexities of
mechanistic drivers of an epidemic. We did not consider rainfall, which would play an important

role in the mosquito seasonality and life traits in relationship to climate change. We also did not
consider the scenario of multiple serotypes of dengue co-circulating in the population, and thus
prior exposure can lead to immune interactions (a possibility for Funchal, given the circulating
serotype for the 2012 outbreak was DENV I). We also assumed a non-dynamic human
population, however, human movement could play an important role in patterns of transmission
and introduction (given the constant influx of tourists all year round on the island). We also did
not consider vector surveillance and control measures implemented on the island, which is an
important factor in limiting mosquito density.
In summary, the model presented here is relevant for the introduction of a new dengue
serotype into Funchal, Madeira Island and the interaction between mean temperature and
seasonal variation to drive the epidemic dynamics. Our results demonstrate the potential for all
year transmission of dengue, with varying levels of epidemic suitability, following an
introduction of the virus. Overall, we demonstrated that epidemic dynamics are strongly
influenced by variation in the date of arrival, seasonal temperature, biting rate, transmission
rates, and the mosquito population. The model sensitivity analysis provides insight into the
relative importance of these parameters and their interactive effects as mechanistic drivers of an
epidemic. These results can be a useful guide in the development of effective local control and
